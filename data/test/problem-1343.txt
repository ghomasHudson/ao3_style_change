his arse.
The other Aurors started to wake up from their Confunded state now that Dargan was out of play, eyeing at the chaos that was the store. The room looked rough, dozens of spell marks across the walls and a few places that were completely blown up. Harry hoped Mr Mulpepper had insurance. Now he turned to Ridgenorth, who was lying on the floor, an empty look in his eyes. He wasn’t speaking, he was kind of just… lying there, not struggling. While Rivers and Buckthorn came over to pick him up, Harry grabbed the empty vial at his feet and held it up to Patrick, who just said “Memory potion.”
The man sighed, and paused for a few seconds before talking, “Well, first of all, you’re going to have to spend the night, I’m sure the Healer that took care of you will be back later today to explain to you the specifics,” Harry was just about to interrupt him, when Patrick raised his hand signalling that he was not done, “second of all, the Minister ordered for you to take a full week off before returning to your duties, you will probably receive an owl before tomorrow, and before you interrupt me I’ll say this too, it may be that he’ll retire you from the case.”
“All right, people, here’s what’s going to happen,” Evergrey stepped a few notches upwards on the staircase so that he could be seen by everyone, even Harry at the very back, “we’re going to spread out, Buckthorn, Twigs, you go to the first floor, Rivers, Griffiths, go outside to observe and block any attempts at escaping through the front door, Crooker, McGallon, you hide behind the counter, Blackburn, Jenkins, you stay here. Me and Harry are going to be in the back room.”
Now the git took a deep breath and shot a mean glare at Harry from under his eyebrows. “Listen, she told me that you’re off her case, and as much as I hate to say it, I don’t trust anyone else at that Ministry than you, as infuriatingly law-abiding as you are, to clear my mother’s name from this whole mess,” Malfoy obviously tried to pace himself from speaking too quickly and showing any kind of nervousness or desperation about the situation. Harry thought it was lovely how the wanker called it
Still, Harry felt uncomfortable, and grabbed the nearest shirt from the back of a chair. It was an old tee from Auror training, an ugly grey colour with yellow seams and a yellow Ministry logo that was peeling off from the corners. The shirt nicely contrasted his blue and white pyjama pants, making him look like he was covered in Gargoyle vomit. How stylish.
They stood up and Rosie peered over Harry’s shoulder at Malfoy, who had been monitoring the situation from the doorway, his expression unreadable. Harry was just about to sink into another internal back-and-forth about whether he should ask him about having kids, when Rosie’s voice pulled him out of his thoughts. “A-ha, Dwaco Malfoy,” she stated like she had just identified a rare bird or a flower.
“You’re right, I’m fucked,” Harry groaned.
“It could be possible that he is operating alone,” Patrick said and eyed Theseus’ portrait suspiciously, as if he was expecting to get interrupted again, “see, what we know is that the
Even with hating, no,
Narcissa spoke again, “Just so you know, if you feel uncomfortable, he can take a hint.”
Narcissa must have heard it too, because she lifted an eyebrow at Harry, “It might have been a coincidence, it might not have been. Draco might have been shopping for me that day, but he certainly saw you, Harry Potter, go into a pub alone.” She didn’t elaborate further. Harry got a stomach ache. How did she know all of this? Also… Malfoy had followed Harry into the pub to talk to him? To try to… what, befriend him? Harry wanted to know what Malfoy wanted, but Merlin forbid he’d interview his damned mother about it. No, this was something he’d have to do face to face. Now he just had to find a way to talk to Malfoy alone without it being painfully obvious what he was doing.
“I guess so,” Malfoy replied quietly. He was looking at Harry, but there was something soft in his eyes that Harry wanted to get closer to.
Now Harry had to struggle to keep a neutral face, learning all these intimate details about Malfoy, why was he telling Harry all of this? Was the beer really that strong? He tried his best to look like all of this was not incredibly vexing, which it was.
“Well… thanks, heh,” was the only thing Harry could say while still being fully convinced that he was utterly fucked with ever convincing anyone to date him. He ran his hand through his hair awkwardly.
“Ah, your logic once again is impeccable, my dearest one,” Draco rolled his eyes sarcastically, “what is the point of eating since you have to do it again anyway? What is the point of ever dressing when you’re going to undress again in the evening? The answer to this, of course,” Draco continued before Harry could cut him off with some tenuous comment about how ‘it wasn’t the same thing’, “is that the time in the middle matters, my point being, Christmas won’t come unless you make it yourself.”
Narcissa gave a light snort and shook her head slightly. “It’s not mad at all, I remember what it’s like to be young and in love, it’s a fire you cannot extinguish.” Harry was sipping on the creamy tea again, it somehow calmed his nerves, a gentle warmth spreading to his limbs. At the same time, he hoped that Narcissa was not referring to being madly in love with Lucius, he wasn’t sure if he could process the image as it was, and he certainly did not want to hear more about it. Fortunately, it didn’t seem like Narcissa was going to continue.
Harry sighed and stayed quiet for a while. He wasn’t sure how comfortable he was sharing intimate details of his life with his ex-girlfriend. Then again, nobody knew him better than Ginny, so he decided to carefully go for it, “I’m not sure,” he admitted. What was Malfoy? ‘Potential interest’ was perhaps too strong of a description.
?” from within his chest erupted such a fantastically mocking laugh it couldn't have been more appropriate if he rehearsed it, “They’re already in prison, Kingsley, that was their punishment
“Oh, honey I thought I heard your voice!” Molly spun Ginny around before letting her back on the ground, “Here, let me take that love,” she took Ginny’s cloak from her hands to put away, “oh and when you two are done chatting could you help me set the table dear,” Molly directed her question at Ginny, who nodded quickly. She had turned a shade of red from her mother’s eager welcome.
“Sorry Potter, there was no other way to get him,” the Auror named Evergrey apologized. He looked like he was waiting on orders, which invariably followed.
Harry realized he hadn’t prepared at all what he should say. He had confidently paraded here, determined to save a cockroach of a wizard from execution he didn't fully disagree with. “I was,” he started, voice grumpier than he meant it, but for once thought it served the purpose, “then I heard that you’re planning on offing the lot of Death Eaters currently in Azkaban, tell me, you didn't think to run it by me?” he pressed. Suddenly, he felt very left out. Indeed, why had Kingsley made such a sudden decision without saying a work to him, even before he left? It had only been a week for Merlin’s sakes.
Draco Malfoy who had sided with Voldemort. Alas, a small voice in Harry’s head added that he was also
Harry leaned forward and put his clasped hands on the table. “They
Before Harry had the time to properly despair, Malfoy tangled his hand into Harry’s hair, and firmly said, “Shut up,” before pulling him into another snog. He had a point: to take advantage of the situation that was still present, and not worry about the future too much. At least that’s what Harry would have thought, if he would have been capable of forming any coherent thoughts while the man’s tongue was licking the inside of his mouth.
“Oh, and this arrived for you,” the woman pulled out a Ministry envelope from her pocket and handed it to Harry, who thanked her. She didn’t stick around to find out what the letter said, but politely left the room.
They dove around in the clear water, trying to do hand stands and somersaults until their mouths and ears and eyes were full of salt water, and they had to walk all the way back to the beach, skin cool, and the wind making their arm hair stand up in goose bumps. Harry felt like a kid again, a kid he never got to be, goofing off in the water, sun on his hair and his face.
Harry spun around, victorious, “We’re going to ask Hermione for help, she’ll know what to do, she always knows,” a huge wave of relief was washing over Harry, but the feeling was obviously not reflected in Draco’s face, which now turned a tad nauseous.
Where Harry had expected Draco to roll his eyes or glare at him, he turned to Harry, looking very gentle, and said, “That’s more than enough for me.” Before Harry could blush, or splutter, or otherwise produce any other type of reaction, Draco smiled, and rolled over to trap Harry under him, and kiss him very slowly, but possessively, like for the first time it actually meant something.
The next paragraph already changed the subject, and Harry, with his shaky hands, was left wanting to know more. What mistake? Was he talking about them sleeping together? Because if it was so, Harry would hope the ground to swallow him at any moment now. But he did say ‘for the second time already’, what was he referring to? Why did have to be so cryptic, even in letters to his own mum? Harry checked the date, it was a few days after Malfoy had left England, and it still didn’t quell his anxiety about the time that had already passed.
Harry wound up Apparating them straight into his bedroom, pulling off clothes as fast as he could. After a few dozen seconds of panting and a hurricane of clothes flying off, they were standing in front of each other in their pants, and the awkward thought of
“How’s Longbottom doing these days? I though he became an Auror, too,” Malfoy closed the paper and pushed out the chair without getting up, he just turned to Harry curiously and leaned his elbow on the table, propping up his head on his hand. Why was he being so… companionable all of a sudden? Was it because he couldn’t storm out once he had thrown some horrible insult in Harry’s way like usually? To be honest, Harry would prefer that, at least then he’d know where he stood. Dealing with a sociable Malfoy was new territory for him, it was ominous in the same way as a calm before the storm.
Harry thought about it for a while. Why didn’t he want to be Head Auror until retirement? It was too much, too much responsibility, too much paperwork, too much action. “Erm, well,” Harry started, and decided to begin with a benign example, “it’s a lot of paperwork, and…” he drifted off for a few seconds, trying to compose his next sentence in a way that wouldn't scare Malfoy away, “and I just don’t want to have a job that risky when I have a family.”
The Ministry was quiet on a Saturday morning. It was early, too – too early to be up by far. Harry was making his way across the Atrium, saying
like that. Malfoy looked positively pained at having to be in this position, which invariably raised the question, why had he come?
better at being hated than me, cheers,” Malfoy emptied the last of his pint and almost slammed it on the table.
The man looked hesitant, then took Harry’s hand, very gently, into his own, “I don’t know,” he admitted, looking a bit embarrassed, since Harry clearly had things planned out, “and I haven’t the faintest clue as to why you fancy me, honestly, but I don’t want it to stop.” Harry felt himself going completely red listening to the words coming out of Malfoy’s mouth. He gave the man’s hand a gentle squeeze.
sympathetic for it not to sound suspicious… “I saw Patrick the other day and he said you’ve been acting odd, is everything okay?” So Harry’s instincts had been right, Hermione did have an ulterior motive behind her little outing.
Now he got flustered by the question and ran his fingers through his hair to… what? Make it seem less bushy? A hopeless undertaking. He picked up a pillow from the bed to hold so that his hands wouldn't be continuously fidgeting, giving away his agitation. “Well, I was. It’s just… it’s not customary for the Head Auror to visit people’s houses personally, delivering messages,” now he was fidgeting with the pillow instead, rolling its corner in and out.
“Right.” Malfoy’s face looked weary as he fished his wand from his robe pocket. Harry was surprised to see that his uniform wasn’t so immaculate anymore – it was crumpled here and there, and Malfoy’s collar was wonky. “Which leg?” he asked, and pointed his wand towards the one Harry wiggled painfully. Harry could feel a tingling sensation of the diagnosis charm on his left ankle. “Been duelling criminals at work again?” Malfoy asked, but it sounded more like an attempt at polite rapport than sarcasm.
Harry sighed,
“Is it weird that I don’t find this weird?” Harry asked after a while. He felt like he was talking to an old friend of sorts. Not that they were ever friends, just two people brought together through shared trauma. What a romantic way to put it.
Malfoy kept his promise that night, shagging Harry’s brains out. The man murmured
He turned to look at Malfoy, sleeping peacefully beside him. It was mad how quickly they had gone from acquaintances to… lovers? Granted, it had been brewing for several months at that point, and Harry was up to his ears sweet on Malfoy. He just wanted to be with him more, it felt as though there weren’t enough hours in the day for him to be with the man. But eventually, he would have to leave. Leave Draco’s golden hair and slight stubble, his gentle kisses, and their still fumbling romance. He didn’t want it all to end, he didn't want it to end so much that his chest felt heavy with the weight of the inevitable. Harry sighed and spread his limbs out straight. There was nothing for him to do, except give it time, hope everything would be okay in the end. After painfully turning around in the bed, the sheets scratching his burnt skin, and staring at Malfoy’s sleeping figure, he finally fell asleep.
“It’s okay,” Harry said softly, as they were walking along the wide path. He decided to tell Malfoy that he was actually the person who gave Fred and George his winnings from the Triwizard Tournament to enable them to start WWW, after the Diggorys refused his offer to give the money to them. Malfoy was astonished at the piece of information, especially hearing how much it was for.
Harry slowly opened his mouth to speak, but kept his eyes shut. “What a shit fever dream, I really wished my unconscious would get some new material already,” his voice sounded like it was coming from someone else’s mouth, it echoed inside his head and sounded completely strange.
“Will do,” Patrick nodded, “so, I have to admit my memory is a bit fuzzy about the events of the other day, mind filling me in?”
“Calm down, I merely have to perform some standard checks on you before a decision can be made about when you’ll be discharged. So, if you’d be so kind as to disrobe your chest so I can have a listen,” Malfoy explained with terrifying nonchalance as he lifted the stethoscope to his ears and held up the round end in his long fingers.
“Well, you know,” he scratched the back of his head and put the menu down, “I don’t know, like, beers at a pub or something of the sort.” He was having a hard time concentrating on talking because he was suddenly very aware of how clearly he could make out Malfoy’s bicep through his jumper. Harry had gotten off work at ten past ten, trying to hurry out of the office as fast as he could, not wanting to keep Malfoy waiting. But it had been a bit hard with Ron on his heel, talking his ear off. Normally Harry wouldn’t have minded, but he had been trying to figure out how to explain to Ron that he was going
here?” Harry inquired.
Draco took a deep breath like he was trying to steady himself, which he probably was, judging on the very visible bulge in front of his jeans. Harry bit his lip at the sight. “When are you free next?” Draco asked quietly. There was a determined fire behind his eyes.
While the lot were peeling off their layers, Noah ran down the steps, wearing his deep blue Weasley sweater with a large N on the front of it. His hair was already a mess, but Draco decided to let it go, it was Christmas Eve after all. He remembered too many holidays from his childhood that included horribly itchy woollen robes and extra strong hair gel. His son could whatever he wanted, and not worry about his hair, and now he and Hugo were already running back up the steps to play in his room. They were the same age, and would go to Hogwarts at the same time. Sometimes Draco wondered if they’d be in the same house, and which house his son would make it to. He always concluded that it wouldn’t matter to him, as long as he was happy.
you have a family?” came Malfoy’s immediate reply, his tone a tad more surprised than Harry would have liked it to be.
“I suppose that’s a valid point. Continue,” Malfoy leaned back in the booth and eyes Harry curiously.
Based on the expression on Patrick’s face, it wasn’t clear whether he accepted the explanation, but at least his didn’t pursue the matter any further. “Right, well, do what you got to do, and, er, feel better,” he nodded at Harry and turned towards the door to leave.
That evening, Harry left the Malfoy residence, not with a peaceful mind, but with a stormy one, now gripping another piece of parchment in his hand. Only this time, it was Draco Malfoy’s address in Tuscany.
he looked down, and then up again, and said, “Fine, but only for the good luck.” And before Harry could give back a sarcastic quip, his heart hammering, Malfoy had already closed the gap between them and stepped into the pool with a splash. Next, he cast Nox, leaving them both to stand there, in the darkness. Harry found it quite hard to breathe, let alone reply to whatever Malfoy had just said, he had already forgotten. Fortunately, the man didn’t make him wait long, before grabbing Harry from the waist and pulling him into a very passionate kiss. Harry responded eagerly, wrapping his arms around the man, and letting himself be practically lifted from the water by Malfoy. His heart felt like a little bird trying to get out of his chest, his head felt cloudy aside for the very clear fact that he was, once again, snogging Malfoy, and once again, he couldn’t imagine doing anything else.
just feel like shit.”
Now Penelope was squirming in her seat. “I suppose not, no,” she confirmed, the red spreading from her ears to her face as she was trying to make subtle glances at the other board members for help. They didn’t jump to her aid.
Then he withdrew from the kiss and sat astride on Harry’s waist. He slowly took off Harry’s glasses and placed them on the side table. “Don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this,” he mumbled.
“Suppose that’s fair,” Harry admitted, then decided to return the remark: “like you had any hobbies,” he said. It was still a tad unclear to him what Draco did his entire school career, except bully everybody into being his lackeys. Harry only remembered him being on the Quidditch team on and off. On the other hand, Draco hardly had any idea what Harry had been doing the whole time, either. They would hopefully have much more time to talk about it.
"Macmillan asked me to give you this for your cold."
"It's close to three o'clock." But there's some snow so it's not that noticeable I think."
Harry nods. Then Draco notices the huge trunk floating behind him. No one carries a trunk that size for a visit. Especially he must have noticed by the absence of the Auror uniform that was replaced by muggle casual wear.
Draco smirks not knowing exactly what to say to a Ron Weasley who is being too nice to him. Until then he had been all neutral, with cordial greetings and including him in the conversation from time to time, but never like this. "Teddy is good, but he's not even close to mimicking the Macbeth Witches, he's calmer, he gives a resemblance to Gina Spektor, though. He's good, but he always insists on singing some ... uhm-"
Draco snorts. Yes, of course, and now that Harry Potter laughs because he has no talent even to coach a school Quidditch team well. Thanks, Longbottom.
Shit, he can even imagine the headmistress with a pocket watch in her hand counting down the minutes until Draco deigns to face his fate.
"Do you want to come, Potter?" Ernie asks.
Harry extends a hand to Draco, and he's held tightly by feeling Harry's warmth in the touch and brings his skin with his fingers by accident and wonders why his skin is so soft to the touch. He blushes immediately because he does not care about Harry Potter's skin, he does not give a fuck.
Harry gives him permission with a shake of his head and he takes the necessary liberty to give the room some life.
"Silver? But silver burns their bloody skin! What the fuck?"
Harry smiles sadly at him probably for taking the first step, then Draco shows him where the bathroom is making a joke about how he could get lost in his apartment, Harry laughs slightly, but still seems quite lost.
"We have practiced tirelessly every day. Gryffindor is not even that good." Gilbert Clearwater yawns. Scoundrel.
Draco bites the inside of his cheek and sighs heavily. "Don't think I care so much about you, Potter."
Harry clears his throat and asks for his glasses back. Draco curses himself for thinking of kissing him when he's done with whatever his relationship with Blaise Zabini has been in his life just the day before.
"Are you telling me you're not one bit interested in the Quidditch league?" Ron asks in that high-pitched voice Draco remembered from his arguments in the middle of the great hall. Neville denies. "Not even the Russian one? Boys are handsome."
Then Harry Potter with all that false look of ignorance goes to his classroom and asks him how he realized that men are for him and he just... explodes. His head has been spinning since that last time because it's definitely too much for him, and the same question is repeated in his mind relentlessly like in one of those muggle gadgets that Neville got last year for Christmas that repeated the same song in the same minute without a break, how did you know you're gay, Draco? The question sticks to the tip of his tongue and is colored in the same tone in which Potter asked him, his palms itch and his stomach churns as if he were about to spit out his intestine through his chest to his lungs, depleting him of oxygen.
"Once she put a spell on him so that her hair was a bird's nest, you could already see it all over the school being chased by the little birds." Harry laughs in fascination.
"Remus would have liked to see this... the change that is being made. Sirius would probably have a Fire Whiskey party and everything to celebrate." Harry's cheerful tone falters for a second, but the smile doesn't leave his lips.
"I'm sorry I scared you." Draco snorts and laughs.
"We need to talk." Draco opens his eyes looking quite affected by the interruption.
"Oh yeah, the intrepid Alice, she liked The Beatles, Neville." Remus nodded, holding a small cup of tea between his long, slender fingers. "George looked a lot like your father, he even imitated his hairstyle in seventh year."
"Oh hello. You woke up."
"They are the reports that must be signed for the permits to go out to Hogsmeade, the director asked me to give them to you, I suppose it is part of your punishment for playing rock star."
"Shut your mouth," he said as soon as he saw Neville's intentions to laugh. The man smiled and nodded, pretending to close his mouth with a latch.
"Oh, so... good job Professor Malfoy, that was a great lineup."
Draco nods. "Mr. Tremlett, please call Professor Flitwick, I need him to discuss a matter about one of your students."
"From you, Potter, I'm not surprised."
That damn gossip.
The two are silent for a moment until Neville asks again. "What did you have planned for your future Draco?"
Connor nods. They both get up to leave, but Connor stops to thank him for the support. Draco tells him that he has nothing to be thankful for, but that the boy is giving him his best kept secret and the power to completely destroy him.
"What happens?" Harry laughs at Neville's sudden behavior. He turns and takes it by the lapel of his coat.
"Is this formation okay, Draco?" Neville points to the boys in front of them. At the front Captain David Everly who held his ancient fire bolt in his hands and beside him his striker, Paris Green. The rest of the team was scattered in a strange combination where the seeker, Wolfgang Goldstein was in the background.
"What's going on here?" Potter comes through the crowd, fixing his gaze on Jeremy and Michael and then turning to Draco for answers. "Is everything in order?"
Draco sighs. "Girls aren't swamp creatures, Lupin, they are, girls. The thing is, Gilbert is an idiot who doesn't know how to open his mouth to have a damn conversation with his girlfriend." Teddy laughs. "Make sure you get to know Victoire first, then we can talk about love, okay?"
He takes one of the notes Principal McGonagall gave him and hands it to Jerome, who mutters some stupid thing that Draco isn't in the mood to ask him to repeat, the least he needs to do is babysit a child in detention.
"I don't care."
"Do you really notice if boys are handsome, Weasley?" Draco asks mockingly, but actually he's rather surprised. Did Weasley like men? The only thing he could remember was that emotion that filled his face when Viktor Krum arrived at Hogwarts, but no more.
"I got a letter on Saturday from the Magical Student Chorus Committee." Haven Kingsley leaps into place excitedly taking Evan by the arm, Connor watches her, but looks away quickly at Teddy. "I'll read it to you, listen carefully, okay?" The children nod, Draco clears his throat. "
"What was the color?" The woman insists.
And Harry doesn't give Draco good news.
"Madame Hooch," Draco says, straightening up in his place. Rolanda nods her head in greeting. "We were just playing around a bit. Something wrong?"
"It's not too many, not even a table will be filled for Christmas. Worry about not staying for the Easter holidays. All seniors stay, even junior Ravenclaws." Neville paces the room, eyeing the desks one by one. "Remember when we hated each other in school?"
"Harry! What a joy to see you here." A tall man approaches Potter with outstretched arms and the two embrace. "I never thought I saw you, well... in a place like this."
Draco sighs because yes, it is a problem if it is "Malfoy" and not just Draco to him.
"Is everything okay? It's the third week, don't tell me you've already gotten into trouble." Joked. The boy didn't laugh, but shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Draco's smile faded from his face, something was going on. "Connor?"
"Yes..."
Pathetic.
"The necessary ones to have the opportunity to pass with Exceed Expectations, because I don't expect less from my students and if I have to send them more homework during the year, believe me I'll, and I wont be happy to waste my free time grading assignments that shouldn't be necessary. Now, get out your cauldrons and ladles because we'll talk about how to properly mix a purple garlic to practice dissolving dragon scale substitutes. Quickly!"
“Very well,” Judge Bones uttered and lowered his reading glasses even further on his nose to peer at the stack of parchments in front of him, “I understand the Ministry wishes to rescind the death penalty, and reduce Mr Malfoy’s sentence to time served, is that correct? Mrs Ackerman?” Bones was a man in his thirties, but with a thin set of hair in his head and bags under his eyes that indicated that he’d been in the job for thirty years too long.
might have heard,” he pressed, somewhat impatiently, “the Ministry issued an execution order for all convicted Death Eaters, that includes you.” There was the premise of why he was there. Lucius was facing execution, and Harry was here to tell him it was going to be stopped.
Evergrey seemed to think along the same lines, but thankfully held his tongue. “Good, went to fly for a bit with the family in the Quidditch pitch outside the city, they open it to the public for a few hours every Saturday, you can rent a broom there so… yeah… how about your weekend?”
Malfoy made a humming sound as a sign of him processing the information, sprawling his legs lazily and staring into the distance. “Well, I’m sure you’ve found a suitable bride to continue your mediocre lineage.”
“Right, er, thanks,” Harry mumbled awkwardly once Malfoy had deemed him fit to be discharged. He felt the red of his chest rising on his face as he pulled the hospital robe back on at lightning speed.
“Well, first of all, you were lucky that Gunther Ivanovski didn’t remember your name when we interrogated him,” Harry started, “you were lucky that Narcissa Malfoy was released from Azkaban just in time for you to frame her with Dubois, then, when you managed to escape from that muggle neighbourhood, a stroke of luck again,” Harry listed, he knew he was pressing Ridgenorth’s buttons, “How fortunate that the Marigold had your back after all these years, isn’t it… Dargan?” Harry didn’t stop pacing so as to not give the man any more reason to be suspicious.
The second course was a creamy yellow risotto, that was placed on the bottom of a very large plate. It was heavenly, and for a moment, Harry forgot why he didn’t feel like eating. He was sad when the dish was gone in a few forkfuls, and hoped that the waiters weren’t rolling their eyes at him for his boorish behaviour. “Do you know what?” he said suddenly, Malfoy still chewing on his rice but now directing his attention to Harry, “I’m not going to ruin my own night,” he declared, “I’m here, in a lovely restaurant, in Italy, with this incredible view, and this mouth-watering food, with the man I love, so cheers.” He clinked Malfoy’s wine glass with his own, and was halfway to bringing it to his lips, when he heard the man’s incredulous voice.
Malfoy took a deep breath like he was gearing up to something. “Because… you seemed different too,” he confessed, looking at his hands like they were the most interesting things in the world. He was turning one of his silver rings around his finger absentmindedly, “slightly less annoying… and maybe I happened to see you without a shirt on when they first wheeled you into the hospital,” he lifted his head to smirk at Harry nervously, “not bad”.
Just when Harry thought he’d go mad from seeing one more parchment asking for permission to release someone from custody, a memo floated onto his desk and unfolded itself. It was a permission slip from Evergrey to arrest Dargan Ridgenorth, and it already featured Kingsley’s signature. Before Harry could wonder what it meant, Patrick opened the door to Harry’s office with a bang, already wearing his Ministry cloak. “So? Are you coming or what?”
Patrick just snorted, he was also holding his wand at the ready. “Don’t tempt me, Potter. I am just as fine working under a brilliant wizard like you.” The kinds words were surprising and, in Harry’s opinion, completely undeserved. He didn’t know what to say for a while, the seconds ticked away in the clock.
“Good news Harry, we have a name,” Isaac smiled at him reassuringly and ruffled the papers he was carrying, finding the right one, “the wand belongs to one Dargan Ridgenorth, the splinched finger confirms this.” Buckthorn was peering at the piece of parchment in his hand before nodding to himself and handing the document over to Harry.
“Or… you know,” Harry bit his lip again, “you could come straight here?” In any other situation he would have hated to sound so desperate but, right now, he couldn’t have cared less. He wanted Draco, quite fucking badly.
– “but they give the truly hopeless cases to us rookies.” So, Malfoy was still a fairly fresh Healer out of training then? Harry had no idea how long the Academy lasted, only that it was extremely selective of its candidates ­– clearly, someone had bungled there. “Tell me again exactly
“It’s quite alright,” Malfoy said, smiling politely, “she’s rather impressive.” Harry’s stomach didn’t seem to calm itself down, and he found himself wondering once again if Draco would ever want kids himself. They hadn’t talked about it yet, hell, they’d only been together for a week, but Harry couldn’t shake it out of his mind. He thought that Draco would make a good dad, a million times better than Lucius ever was to him.
Malfoy gave Harry an evaluative look, lifting his chin and scanning him up and down. “But you wrote it?” he raised his eyebrows again, questioningly. Harry had been right about the treacherous nature of letters, they were too exposing, for fuck’s sake. He felt his palms starting to sweat again, it was too warm in the room.
Harry decided to go straight to the point, “Is it mad that I want to go see him?” His voice was filled with exasperation, but he needed to know that he wasn’t making the matter bigger in his mind than it was. Was it mad that he was asking Malfoy’s
“I’m shocked,” Malfoy expressed in a tone that expressed how thoroughly un-shocked he was, he seemed amused toying with Harry, “I would imagine that anyone who raised you must have been as unbearably heroic as you turned out to be.” His face was mocking but his stare was attentive, and Harry couldn't help but wonder what his agenda was with the whole thing, starting with him showing up at his house.
“Brilliant, that’s the last of my questions, do you have something to add? Any questions?” Harry’s quill dove back into the bottle of ink in between the notes. Malfoy shook his head. “Let’s sign this then,” Harry continued and the parchment gently floated in front of Malfoy with the quill following. Malfoy grabbed it mid-air and scribbled his signature on the line. When it was Harry’s turn to sign, he scribbled his hasty signature under Malfoy's, which was of course penned down in perfect cursive letters, Harry expected no less.
Harry nervously cleared his throat, the cordial tone of the conversation unsettled him. “Yes, well, maybe I’m suffering from a temporary mental aberration, or something,” he shrugged, still not daring to sit down with Malfoy.
The search for the ring’s meaning had to wait, though, because an hour after Harry had arrived to work on Wednesday morning, Evergrey busted into his office. He looked hurried and was wearing an outer robe. Harry jumped a little when his door opened with a thump, and quickly closed a book about the Sacred Twenty-Eight that he had been leafing through.
The prison clerk checked his ID, and a guard motioned Harry to join him. Both of the employees looked about twenty years older than they were, and Harry thought how there was probably nothing anyone could give him to work here. As they went deeper into the prison, however, the dementors’ affect cleared a bit, and Harry felt like he could think straight again. He followed the guard along a corridor to an elevator, and they went up for what felt like forever, at least fifteen floors if not more, before the door let out a sad
“Fine, but please quit the lawyer talk, I hate that slanted tone,” Hamish huffed and rolled his eyes, “I will agree to a vote, but on one condition,” he nodded towards Patrick, “Evergrey here will be suspended from it, he’s biased because he’s working for you.” Everyone around the table were nodding in agreement, except for Kingsley, who still hadn’t participated in the conversation. Evergrey just shrugged and pushed his chair further away from the table.
“Do you think that’s the best idea? I would guess Granger would happily side with the Ministry on this one,” Draco hesitated.
Kingsley leisurely lifted the paper and conjured his reading glasses from the side table to read the task description. Harry tapped his foot impatiently and scanned the office: it was larger than his, but it also featured a personal fireplace connected to the Floo Network, some maroon armchairs, a chessboard, a bookcase, and no portraits of the Minister’s predecessors. Harry reckoned he also wouldn’t want a portrait Cornelius Fudge or Rufus Scrimgeour looking over him every day, or worst case, Pius Thicknesse, though he figured that any portrait made of the former Death Eater was surely already destroyed. A cold shiver still ran down his spine.
“Oh yes, they had a guest bedroom too, but this was an extra room for Dudley’s toys,” Harry nodded eagerly, he knew he had Malfoy hooked now. For once, Harry enjoyed having the man’s undivided attention, do anything he liked with it, say anything and he would earn his recognition.
“The Boy Who Lived? The Saviour of the Wizarding and Muggle World as we know it?” Malfoy supplied helpfully. “I bet it must have been very hard for you to be admired by everyone,” his tone dripped with sarcasm.
Harry gave Ron a mischievous grin, “Wouldn’t dream of it.” That was the last time they ever discussed the matter.
“Signore Malfoy!” A short, plump man with grey curly hair and a black button down with a matching apron was making his way towards them. His face was red from the heat of the room, but he seemed cheerful to see Malfoy. “Back so soon? Ah, I see you bring a date, I like it, I like it,” the man was nodding eagerly, already motioning them to follow him. Harry couldn’t help noticing how Malfoy didn’t correct him about them being on a date.
Narcissa nodded slowly. “I see, come on in, please,” she moved aside to let Harry pass, and then closed the door behind her. The house was more furnished now, there was a rug on the floor, and closets for outerwear. The drawer Narcissa had pulled the Malfoy family ring out of had moved to the other side of the hall along with the mirror. The hallway ended in stairs that went upstairs, and Harry couldn’t help wondering if Draco’s room would be at the end of that flight of stairs. Even having seen the man naked, he couldn’t have resisted an offer to see his room, something so inherently intimate. Although, what Harry then realized, was that he had probably stayed in a guest room, since this was mainly his mother’s house.
“Is that the real reason?” Harry persisted still. His voice was steady, but his hands were twisting under the table. Harry knew that pressing Malfoy like this could have volatile consequences, and he tried to tread lightly.
Malfoy was already rolling his eyes at Harry. “Merlin, you really do enjoy the finer things in life, don’t you?” But before Harry could protest, he added, “Fine, have it your way.” Then he proceeded to recite his order to an old lady who had suddenly appeared to hover next to their table. Harry remarked from the menu that the one Malfoy opted for was a rose petal tea with some other flower or herb he’d never heard of either. Malfoy also ordered fresh scones with jam.
. How’s this for romance: fourth year, when I first heard about the Yule ball, my first thought was to ask you. Naturally, it was an impossible idea to entertain, and I ended up going with Pansy, who sat next to me the whole night while I brooded over you in your ridiculous dance robes, wanting to be up there with you,” Malfoy’s expression was a mix of disdain and something more vulnerable, “fifth year, I joined Umbridge’s ranks because I wanted to get your attention, and because I was so insanely jealous of that cow Cho Chang. Sixth year–“
“Isaac, do you think it would be possible to get a special permission from the Minister for the Department of Mysteries to brew a small batch of Veritaserum for our difficult detainee?”
Narcissa was giving a horribly evaluative look at Harry, like she was assessing whether he was boyfriend material or not, whether Draco would still care about him or not. She then leaned forward, and pulled a small woven basket from the lower level of the coffee table. Harry saw that it was full of letters, of which Narcissa now pulled out one. She handed it to Harry and gave him a look of ‘go on, open it’. The envelope had already been neatly opened with a paper knife, and now Harry pulled out a smooth letter of two pages. “The second paragraph,” Narcissa said simply, and was eyeing Harry attentively. Harry folded the letter open and directed his attention over the first paragraph, which seemed to be a description of his journey and arrival home, downwards on the paper. In incredibly meticulous penmanship, it said:
Harry opened the seal with the Ministry’s symbol on it, and quickly glanced the neat handwriting on the other side that said
“Come on, it was only from the first floor, it wasn’t that bad,” Harry tried to sound nonchalant and waved his hand in the air to get the message across that he didn’t mind being tossed around once in a while. He wasn’t quite sure why he was trying to impress Malfoy, but he had a feeling that he was under a lot of painkiller potions at the moment.
“I was meeting a real-estate agent, finalising a purchase of a house for my mother, released from Azkaban later today, surely you’re aware,” Malfoy stated, looking into the mid distance, avoiding Harry’s gaze. Of course, how could Harry have forgotten that? It was just on the
Harry took off his outer robe and hung it on the stand, he flopped down on one of the armchairs in front of the fireplace. He had thought about the numbers, and had a guess, though it might have been a reach. “Well, I reckon, today is February 29
“Cheers, mate,” Harry said and when he heard the door close behind him, he Incendio’d the fireplace. He slouched back on the chair and extended his legs. Harry had really had enough of mysterious initials and hunting down things… for the day, at least. Maybe forever.
Malfoy was quiet for a few seconds. “Right, except that bit,” he said quietly. Harry didn’t have parents, Malfoy had a dad who didn’t love him and a mum who wouldn’t protect him from his dad. On the biological family front, then, they were both pretty fucked. But it wasn’t about being an orphan.
put you in the cupboard at first?”
Unfortunately, Harry didn’t know any Italian, so he started to stutter something out in English, “Er, sorry, I’m, er, looking for Draco Malfoy? Do you know him?” he felt awkward standing there, in the middle of the room, hoping that the store clerk would understand what he was saying. Why hadn't he brought a dictionary or something? He realized that he might have made a mistake coming to the place, beautiful as it was, he seemed to have forgotten some essential things, like that Italians spoke Italian.
, Harry had thought upon recalling that James and Snape had also been at odds back in school. He wished that Malfoy wouldn’t treat his kids, or anyone for that matter, the way Snape had treated Harry.
“You think so?” Harry couldn’t hold back his question.
Now Malfoy scowled and brushed his hair from his face forcefully. “We all know, Potter, you saw Cedric Diggory die when you were fourteen, you saw the rebirth of Voldemort, if there’s anyone in Britain that’s been through some horrid shit, it’s you,” his voice was biting and merciless.
Malfoy’s face scrunched up in thought. “Right, the year Umbridge took over,” he mumbled, but then cleared his throat, “I must say that there was a lady who knew how to get results.”
Malfoy want Harry to be sexy? He would be quite disappointed, because Harry had no idea how, if he ever got that far. Now Harry jumped up from the bed and followed after Malfoy. The hallway was unlit, because Harry had already gone to bed once that night, and he only saw the man’s silhouette going down the stairs, white hair catching whatever light was gently seeping in from the windows.
“Apparition would cause too much of a ruckus, so we’re Flooing to their basement,” Patrick explained.
He had sat up on the bed, and looked around the room. The walls were a pale sandy colour, and in the far wall, the chimney of the downstairs fireplace travelled along the wall and through the ceiling. There was a shelf on the right side of the chimney, next to the bed, with some books and a plant on it. On the left side, near the huge windows, there was a comfortable looking lounge chair. Outside the windows, there was a tiny balcony, just narrow enough for someone to stand on and admire the scenery. To Harry’s left, opposite to the stairs, there were two doors, but he hadn’t known where they led to.
Harry shook his head in frustration, they should be going in already, not drawing more attention to themselves by standing in front of the entrance in fucking
, she would be Harry’s path to convincing the others – he already had his next question lined up. “Would you agree it important information to have, not only historically, but practically?” Harry continued. Investigating the unknown dark magic behind the symbol might well be Lucius’ way to freedom, or at least, back to life.
Draco rolled his eyes dramatically. “
after every kiss he placed on Harry’s body, and Harry had no choice, and no will to have a choice, but to respond
Malfoy turned to look at him, curiously. Harry wasn’t sure why he’d opened his mouth, but it seemed like the thing to do when one was sitting in a restaurant in Italy with someone they very much liked. “I get why you don’t want to leave this place and go back home, Merlin’s beard,
since
Malfoy shook his head to himself, “I knew I wanted to hex your arse off, heh” he raised his eyebrows and finally looked back at Harry, a smile flickering in the corner of his mouth, “I knew I’d never felt something so strong about anything, or anyone, and I hated you for that.” Suppose it was fair. Draco had had quite the pressure from his dad to continue the family lineage, and realizing you’re fancying the one person you’re supposed to hate, it must have been unpleasant to say the least.
never want to leave, and I’ve only been here for less than a day.” Harry took a large gulp of his water, only to remember that it was carbonated.
“Wait, does that mean that I’m the only one having wine?” Ron gave the bottle an evaluating look, it was a Friday after all, but then seemed to catch himself as if he had slipped out something important and gave a guilty glace at Hermione. She gave Ron a disappointed look, but smiled and turned to Harry, “Might as well tell you right away, and keep in mind that it is very new, but…” she gave Ron a grin across the table, “Rosie is getting a sibling later this year.”
. “My only clothes were whatever my cousin Dudley would care to discard on to me,” Harry continued, and started to get a taste of the storytelling, he sat up in his chair more, “they moved me to Dudley’s other room to stay when I turned eleven.”
Harry hugged her back. “Do what?” he asked suspiciously. If it wasn’t an emergency, why was Hermione in his office? Maybe she had a case for him from the Department of Magical Law, they sometimes consulted Aurors to back up their evidence, or even requested someone to be detained.
with him. That was way more serious than Harry felt okay with – it was about real feelings, something he was piss poor at. Apparently Draco was, too, since he’d been a right sod the whole time. And now Harry was painfully aware that he was thinking about Malfoy as
Now Draco had had his orgasm, and they were both lying on the bed, Harry’s head on the man’s chest, and his fingers fondling Harry’s hair absentmindedly. The birds outside were chirping eagerly, and the few pine trees that were visible from the bed were swaying gently in the warm morning breeze. Malfoy’s skin was hot under Harry’s ear, and he ran his finger on his chest and on his side, sometimes travelling to brush on his balls, and caress his inner thigh. Draco seemed to take the hint and gave a quick kiss on Harry’s temple, before moving downwards on the bed, and slowly removing his briefs covering his erect cock.
“Very much,” Harry replied, keeping his eyes sternly at Malfoy and reached to brush the hair from his face. The man made an expression that signalled that he was simultaneously amused and put off by the mawkish comment, but kept looking at Harry. He extended his arm to caress Harry’s spine, and Harry carefully pulled the blanket downwards, placing his hand on Draco’s hot skin, on his side, then on his inner thigh. That’s when he’d noticed that the man had had a raging hard on.
“Er, no. I…”
“Funny enough, I find it more effective than any sunblock spell, better water resistance,” Malfoy shrugged nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t just fundamentally altered his image in Harry’s eyes, “here, let me,” he said and grabbed the bottle back, popping the lid open and squeezing some of the white lotion in his hand. He then proceeded to spread it on Harry’s neck and shoulders, it was cold. Malfoy continued onto his back, his movements gentle and pleasant, Harry wished he’d never stop. The man’s hand very discreetly visited to fondle the upper part of Harry’s ass, before returning to rub the lotion on his sides. “Just making sure I’m getting it everywhere,” he smirked when Harry jerked his head to look at him in surprise, a bit flustered.
Now Malfoy’s face turned from bitter to scowling, he looked away from Harry. “She went to see my father in Azkaban,”
.” Harry blamed himself for not making a move earlier, and he blamed Malfoy for being a cowardly sod.
Draco snorted dryly. “That must be it,” he muttered, “you were raised by just regular narcissists.” The remark made Harry smile, it felt good being with Malfoy, just being with him, talking about regular things… well, semi-regular. Hearing his voice, being able to look at him without having to worry what he’d think.
suffering from an acute mental disturbance with hallucinations, because there was clearly no way that Draco Malfoy had just called him good looking, was there?
sprang into Harry’s mind, but he didn’t think it best to go too much into that memory, so he tried to be as vague about it as possible. “Er… I think this might be a case of an apology from his side,” he articulated carefully, “I think Draco’s on foot to right some wrongs, doubt you’ll be next though.”
However, when Syrena Ackerman entered the room with Lucius in her footsteps, Draco looked like he was about to be sick. Something deep inside Harry’s stomach turned, and he tore his eyes off Draco to look at Lucius now taking a seat in the large chair in the middle of the room. He had shaved, and his hair looked cleaner, his robes changed from prison garments to a simple black outfit which he seemed to hate wearing with every fibre of his being. Despite these adjustments, he still looked rough, the dark circles under his eyes visible even to Harry, who was sitting high up in the crowd, and his presence somehow worn from what it had once been.
He nodded slowly. So Slughorn was retiring then, Harry was surprised that it had taken him this long, Horace wasn’t a young man when Harry and Dumbledore had gone and tried to convince him to return to Hogwarts as the Potions Master, and that was twelve years ago. Maybe it was good that he was finally re-entering his retirement days, good for the students, especially. Then Harry realized something. “That would make you the Head of Slytherin house, too, no?”
Rosie gave Harry a gentle hug before being carried away by Ron. They exchanged goodbyes and slid out of the door, Rose waving at Harry from Ron’s shoulder.
“Next weekend,” Harry replied.
Malfoy snorted. “Mhm, suppose you’re half right, then,” he muttered, and that ended up being the end of that discussion. Harry decided to let it go, and moved carefully closer to Malfoy, giving him a light kiss on his temple, but not staying to cuddle as to not make him feel too stifled. Harry tried to balance between showing his support and attention, and giving Draco the space he needed.
name from this mess. “And… by extension,
Harry took a seat in the other chair on the balcony. “Good, er, how long was I asleep?” it felt as though he had been unconscious for hours on end, he hadn’t woken up once, not even to change position on the sofa. His body felt heavy, even though the fruit in his stomach was now waking up his system again. He felt awkward thanking Malfoy for presenting him with all this food, and just hoped that he knew he was grateful for the gesture.
Malfoy did not look happy that Harry was making conversation, but then again, he wasn’t happy when Harry didn’t make conversation so… it might have just been Harry that he was not happy about. Somehow Malfoy still decided to take Harry up on the offer and said, “I was just running some errands for my mother, I remember this pub was nice enough so I decided to drop in for a traditional English pint, haven’t had those in a while.”
Ron turned to look at Harry, eyes wide with a mixture of horror and suspicion. “Dare I ask what on Merlin’s green earth is
“Thanks, er, what’s upstairs?” Harry asked, looking at the other staircase, next to the first one, leading into the second floor. He went to pick up his bag and swung it over his shoulder once more, with some awkwardness.
But, alas, it had all gone to shit, for when Harry had gotten home, an hour late when the dinner was already cold, Draco didn’t care: instead of yelling at him, or giving him the silent treatment, he had decided that he just didn’t want to do that sort of thing anymore, he wanted something else entirely, and he had sunken on his knees right there, in the corridor, and fumbled for the ring in his pocket to present to Harry, hands shaking, and nervously mumbled something in the direction of ‘Harry Potter, will you please marry me?’ and Harry, cheeks red from the cold air outside, still wearing his outer robes, had looked at him dazed, eyes wide, and then extracted another ring box from his own pocket, also going down on his knees, and presenting Draco with the most beautifully subtle silver ring, asking him to be his husband. That night had been a blissfully chaotic bungle of a romantic proposal, but they had both ended up frantically nodding and somewhere between a snog and a hug, before pissing off to have sex upstairs, the rings already on their fingers.
“Do you think if I had kids I’d be sitting in a pub alone on a Saturday night?” Harry huffed, shaking his head a little. There it was again, the kids. He really wanted to be spending a Saturday night with his kids, not sitting alone at a pub in London. Correction, not alone, with
Now Malfoy shrugged, not seeming surprised about the question, but not very intrigued about it either. “It was normal, a bit late in my father’s opinion, came with the mail one day, mother was pleased, she wanted me to go to Hogwarts anyway.” Harry thought back to his first encounter with Malfoy, in Madam Malkin’s, when he had been shopping with Hagrid, and Malfoy had had his robes fitted. What an insufferable git he had been. “I suppose your horrid aunt and uncle were glad to be rid of you?” Malfoy asked in return, and Harry couldn’t hold back a snort.
The blond man gave him a one last glance, something hiding behind his eyes, a dark fire. A determined look someone gets when they have decided to do something bold. He stood there for a few seconds too long, and just when Harry thought he had changed his mind, and was going to… do
“I will,” Harry nodded firmly. As of yet, he didn't have any good reasons, but that bit would have to come later.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it,” Harry protested, somehow Malfoy always knew how to turn things around to feel sorry for himself. Harry hated that to be honest.
“That’s great Ginny!” Harry nodded, “You know we’re all going to be there to see you play,” surely if the Magpies made it to the World Cup the whole extended family of the Weasley’s would be there to cheer Ginny on, doubt she’d get that many complimentary tickets to give out, though, “How’s Scotland?”
“I agree,” Malfoy admitted quietly, soaking a scone in his pale pink tea, “I find myself rather shocked that you don’t appear to annoy me beyond compare these days.” His words were his usual repertoire, but something about his expression looked like he didn’t really mean it.
“And what is the argument behind this appeal?” The judge asked in a tired voice.
Harry had agreed before he had time to think of the consequences of such an action. There was surely a shitstorm to be dealt with what it came to Draco Malfoy being overly protective of his mother who was just released from prison. A small price to pay to never see him again. Although lately Harry hadn’t felt the regular wave of nausea when thinking about the bastard.
“I haven’t unshrunk it yet,” Draco said with a chuckle. “I thought we could take it into the lounge tonight and eat there.”
“I have no idea, really,” Draco replied, slightly taken aback at being addressed so casually. “I… wasn’t really trying to.”
“Oh, that sounds good,” Draco nodded.
“Why didn’t you tell me that I was agreeing to a dance with
“Probably,” Draco said, shrugging slightly. “I honestly haven’t thought about it. This ham is delicious, don’t you think?”
Harry laughed again. “Go ahead. I’ll eat mine too,” he said, picking up his fork.
“No. No way,” Harry shook his head vigorously. “I can’t
“If you’re sure,” Ron said.
“Come on, let’s go in there and grab something,” Ron said, nudging Harry’s arm and pointing at the McDonald’s that they were just passing. “You know I like the burgers.”
Harry smiled. “Thank you, I will look forward to the next time.”
Draco rolled his eyes and followed.
tonight,” Harry replied, another frown creasing his forehead. “I want to enjoy this with you. I’ve been looking forward to it all day.”
“Well, let’s just say we don’t have it anymore,” Draco sighed. “I was going to try and repair it, but the pieces were so small, it wasn’t worth it.”
amazing though.”
“Glad to hear it. I’d have had to give you a disciplinary if I thought you were doubting our ability,” Draco said with a laugh. “I think next week looks a little bit easier. No weddings.”
“Mmhmm,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s neck lightly. “Does that help?”
Draco shook his head. “No, thank you. I think we’ve got everything else we need.”
“The artefact he went to investigate was more dangerous than anyone knew,” Hermione continued. “As soon as he was within two feet of it, he couldn’t move away. He was compelled to pick it up.”
Harry ducked his head, smiling. “I am too, especially given my behaviour recently.”
“Good,” Harry replied. “I think my fingers are about to fall off. They’re numb.”
Two weeks after the New Year’s Eve party, Harry walked into his bedroom to find Draco standing in front of the mirror and making a face at his reflection. Upon spotting Harry behind him, he whirled around.
fighting,” Harry replied, rolling his eyes as they continued on their way to the table where Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were waiting for them. “I really think we should have stayed at home to sort this out.”
“Destination?”
“People are still bothering you, then?” Ron asked, giving him an amused look as he paused in his report writing.
Harry groaned. “How are you so good at this?”
“Well. That’s certainly odd,” he mused. “He never leaves the washing up for that long.”
“I’ve been
Draco rolled his eyes and shook his head before taking a bite of his own turkey sandwich.
They worked quickly and before either of them really knew it, they were walking into Bookworms and Brews, where the barista greeted them with a smile. They ordered their coffees and avoided elaborating on why they hadn’t been in for a few weeks by using the busy days at work as an excuse. Within a few moments, they had their coffee and headed down the aisle for an alcove.
Draco snorted softly. “It’s a good thing this wasn’t one of the things you had to face in that battle.”
a top Quidditch player than date one,” Harry replied with a shrug.
“It is absolutely the truth,” Draco exclaimed. “Harry’s friends keep arranging blind dates for him that always turn out terribly and he’s getting a bit fed up with it. But he’s also too nice to say no to them. So I told him that next time they asked, he should turn them down and I’d arrange something instead.”
“Yeah, I think it did, actually,” Harry nodded. “I know I’m not a failure just because I’m not in a relationship right now.”
“Exactly,” Harry said, grin still in place. “Right, I am going this time. See you in the morning,” he added, waving a hand as he walked backwards for a few paces.
“What?” Draco asked in mock surprise. “You mean I can’t hold this over Weasley next time he comes in?”
“Enjoy your dinner,” Draco replied, waving a hand as he turned to walk in the opposite direction. It always amused him that Harry still disliked Apparating so much that he was willing to walk all the way to the opposite end of the alley to leave via the Floo Network.
Harry laughed. “Not really. Unless you want me to be, anyway. I’m sure they wouldn’t mind you coming with me, given that Ginny brought Zabini.”
“Really?” Harry asked, his eyebrows lifting until they disappeared under his fringe. “I wouldn’t have put those two together.”
“So do you,” Harry replied as they parted slightly. “Should we take this upstairs?”
“Oh,” Pansy replied in a hushed voice, her mouth forming an o shape. “I’m… do you want me to be sorry?”
Draco snorted. “I can imagine. Well, you know where I am if you need me. We still have that book to finish.”
Draco groaned. “Please don’t elaborate anymore. I can already imagine what you’re referring to.”
Harry nodded, taking another bite of the treacle tart.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
“Oh, a secret vote. I like it,” Harry said, nodding again. “May the best man win.”
As he ran his eyes down the list of dishes, he felt a light tickle on his leg. Frowning at the menu, he shook his leg to get rid of whatever it was. A moment later, the tickling feeling was back, but making its way further up his leg. He shook his leg again, tutting.
Harry rolled his eyes and lifted his cup again, draining it quickly.
Pansy smirked again. “You should try it sometime. It can be quite exhilarating.”
“No, I didn’t get to that before you came back,” Harry said, glancing up at him. “If you want to check it?”
“Really?” Draco asked, looking up with a frown. “I wonder where the other one is. Well, it looks like we’ll have to share doesn’t it?”
“I hope she wouldn’t have,” Harry said, turning and heading into the back room. “I will be having words with her later though.”
Harry shook his head once more. “Nope.”
“Right, it’s all done,” Harry said, emerging from the back room once more. “What time are we on?”
“See you soon,” Draco replied, returning the kiss.
“I would have, of course I would have,” Draco protested. “How could you think I wouldn’t?”
“Absolutely. Did you see his eyes? They remind me of yours,” Draco said with a smile. “Well, the colour, anyway.”
?” Draco yelped, looking at Harry in surprise.
When they were done, Draco got up and went to get their books, bringing them back and handing one to Harry. “We could borrow these, you know. They’re from the library section.”
“It was nothing,” Draco replied, his cheeks flushing as he concentrated on his chocolate cake again.
Harry shrugged. “For a little while, according to Ginny. Didn’t you know?”
Harry’s eyes blinked open and he rolled onto his side before giving a start. “Draco?” His voice was sleepy.
At once, both Harry and Draco began speaking.
They made their way from the main aisle along to the squashy armchairs. As they sat down, Harry suddenly felt nervous.
“Thanks,” Harry laughed, heading up the steps and into the café. “Sandwiches first?”
Harry smiled. “Hopefully we can get back to normal from now.”
“We were both invited, so we came,” Harry replied. “We didn’t think anyone would notice us at midnight, considering most people were kissing someone else.”
Harry smiled and also reached out to stroke Mr McGregor gently. “He’s so soft.”
Harry laughed. “Don’t worry, I won’t blame you. If we get busy, I will take full responsibility.”
He pushed the kitchen door open and headed for the stairs, sticking his head into the living room on his way past. Frowning again, he climbed the stairs two at a time.
Harry snorted. “Good point. Alright, well, let’s get everything sorted so we can get out of here.”
Draco tilted his head, considering Harry’s words for a moment. “Fair point. Alright, shall we have a little competition? You do one arrangement and I’ll do one, then the customers can decide which looks better.”
“Much later than school,” Harry said, also shifting in his seat slightly. “Ginny and I made a go of things for a couple of years after school, but somewhere around my twentieth birthday things changed.”
the time. Just sometimes.”
! We’re supposed to set an example to the students!”
On Sunday the fourteenth of February, Draco flipped the sign on the door to ‘closed’ at five o’clock and turned to face Harry. “I am exhausted.”
“Baking is boring, Harry,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “The men would be a far better idea.”
“Well,
“Yes!”
“No, I’m happy with things the way they are,” Harry replied. “It’s nice not having to share you. What about you?”
“Ah, uh, yeah,” Harry said, his cheeks flushing until they were the colour of the tulips that sat in a vase on the counter. “I’ve got a date.”
Harry trailed behind, an amused look on his face.
Harry grinned as he gazed at Draco. “You look nice too. Not that you don’t normally.”
Harry laughed and made his way around the room to hand the remaining bunches of flowers to Ginny and Angelina. “No Blaise, Ginny?”
Draco laughed. “Ah, I can’t argue with you there. I like it when she tells me I’m a good worker too, to be fair.”
partly true. At the beginning, I was just happy to have something that kept everyone from setting me up. But the more ‘dates’ we went on, the more I realised that it wasn’t just that that I liked. I liked spending time with you, I liked reading the books, and I liked coming here. When my friends stopped setting me up, I realised that if they stopped forever, it meant I wouldn’t get to enjoy all of that with you anymore. So I did the first thing that came to mind. I lied and told you that Ginny had tried to set me up. And then I just kept on lying.”
“I can imagine, “ Molly smiled. “Anyway. Let’s go through. Lunch is almost ready.”
“That would have been the perfect time to talk to her then,” Draco said, looking at Harry out of the corner of his eye. “You could have complained properly. With swear words and everything.”
Ron grinned and led the way into the building.
“I don’t mind,” Draco said, draining his own coffee cup. “Which would you rather do?”
They worked quickly through all of the fresh stock, checking the quality of each bunch of flowers before depositing them into their display buckets. Before they knew it, all of the stock was out on display and they could make a start on their dried arrangements.
Harry watched him go, shaking his head slightly. He perched on one of the chairs and picked up the menu card that was on the table, studying the list of sandwiches.
“Hi Tim, I’m Harry,” Harry replied as he rounded the table, his hand outstretched. First impressions were good. Tim was clean-looking and well-dressed, with dusty brown hair and a crooked smile.
“I do, you’re right,” Draco nodded with a grin. “It’s just funny winding you up.”
“Well, I have to say I wasn’t expecting that,” Harry said, sitting down. “Wow, these chairs are soft.”
“I know, darling but it’s been a while, you might have forgotten,” Pansy said with a wink.
Harry laughed and stood up. “Alright. Did you dead-head the flowers too?”
“Thanks, I hadn’t noticed,” Harry said sarcastically before sighing. “Sorry. I know.”
“I know,” Draco replied, the corner of his mouth twitching. “But it’s nice to hear, all the same.”
“Absolutely, but I don’t suppose there are many flowers that could give you a third degree burn while you’re tending to it,” Charlie replied.
“Any time,” Charlie smiled., standing up and carrying his mug over to the sink. “Let me know how it goes with Malfoy, yeah?”
“It’s in the backroom in a temporary pot,” Draco said, shaking his head. “We’ll have to see if we can get a new one to replace the one I broke.”
“With good reason, I’d say,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Anyway, we’d better start the clean up. It’s almost closing time.”
“Alright. You’re on,” Harry said, nodding. “Thank you.”
“Ah, you liked my surprise then?” Draco asked with a smirk.
Harry didn’t say anything.
“Are we reading while we’re there tonight?” Draco asked, looking thoughtful. “Or just having coffee?”
“It’s all the leftover property from Sirius’ family. I’ve never had a reason to get rid of it,” Harry replied, looking pained. “I wish I had now.”
Draco shook his head. “Absolutely not. I do, however, think it might be best if we end our evening here. I’m not really in the mood to carry on with the book right now.”
“Go!”
“Ah, the mysterious Arlo,” Draco replied. “And the dragon tamer. I finally get to meet them.”
“As long as you’re sure then,” Harry said, giving him a smile. “I will try and make sure they’re kept to a minimum, just in case.”
“Don’t mention it. You might not enjoy those nights either,” Draco replied with a grin. “But I think you’ll like them better than the dates you’ve had so far.”
Draco moaned softly into the kiss, tightening his hold on Harry.
Harry tutted and folded his arms across his chest. “Well, I suppose it made it easier for us.”
“Oh. Where should we try?” Harry asked with a frown as he turned to Draco.
“Yeah, alright then.” Harry grinned. “Just like the old days.”
Draco shook his head. “No, thank you. BDSM is so far from being my thing that I might as well be a… a… Muggle.”
“Pansy? No, we don’t have any pansies either,” Harry replied with a frown.
Ron picked the bouquet up in one hand and the paper bag in the other and left the shop.
Draco groaned and pushed himself away from the counter. “You’re right. Sitting like this is no good. Alright, let’s draw.”
him at school,” Harry said thoughtfully. “Same as Malfoy.”
Harry laughed. “Have fun.”
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell me this sooner,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Like, ten years sooner.”
“You can tell me when I cook for you one day,” Harry said, smiling.
going to call Harry.
Harry obliged, taking hold of the key and attempting to pull it out of Draco’s grasp.
“No. Molly would be insulted if we did.” Harry grinned. “Although she doesn’t usually complain if I take a bottle of wine or something.”
The rest of the meal passed without any more questions about his love life and Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d laughed so much. Before he knew it, it was nine o’clock and he was on his way home. He wished he could have stayed later, like he would have done when he was younger, but things had changed. Ron and Hermione had the kids to get home, just as George and Percy did. As much as he loved Molly and Arthur, it would have been weird for him to stay with them when the others left. So here he was, coming home alone to a dark and empty Grimmauld Place.
“Yeah, you’d owe me big time,” Ron grinned.
Harry laughed. “I’m sure we’ll get back to it soon. Can you come and have a look at this? I’m not sure it’s quite right.”
“I don’t know, this is the problem!” Harry exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air.
“I’m happy for you,” Harry said with a smile. “Who’s the lucky man? Anyone I know?”
“Paris, yes,” Draco smiled. “I thought we could start the day by French kissing in France. Sorry we missed the sunrise, I didn’t think you’d appreciate being woken up while it was still dark.”
“Bookworms and Brews?” Harry repeated, looking up at the shop front. “A bookshop?”
“Of course,” Draco replied with a chuckle. “It’s the only way to read.”
“I agree, as it happens,” Draco replied. “We’ve always been thrown together in the strangest of circumstances, so why should this be any different? I think this could be something special. If we give it a chance.”
“Is it a bad thing?” Harry asked, turning to look at him. “I mean, it’s a steady income…”
“See you in the morning,” Draco chuckled, turning and heading in the opposite direction.
“Yes, but do you honestly not see yourselves as anything other than friends?” Pansy asked, raising one eyebrow.
date.”
Hermione laughed. “Why? What happened?”
“He must have a reason for coming then?” Harry asked as he and Molly made their way into the kitchen where he knew the rest of the Weasleys would be.
“Look, I’m
“This is amazing,” Harry murmured. “
“Yeah,” Draco murmured, closing the gap between himself and Harry. “And what better way than by doing some international kissing?”
“The bows are the worst part,” Harry agreed. “You’d think we’d be used to doing them by now.”
Harry shook his head slightly as he allowed himself to be chivvied along. He knew they wouldn’t get much work done this afternoon, but he had to admit that it was nice to have a bit of downtime after such a busy couple of weeks.
Harry nodded. “Yes, I’ve got another couple of pages of chapter two to read before I can start chapter three.”
“These?” Harry said, aghast as he picked at the loose material. “They’re ancient!”
“Potter… it’s her shop,” Draco said wryly. “I’m not sure she’d take kindly to me giving her some of her own stock.”
“Very well. In fact, I think we deserve a prize.” Harry grinned, picking his book up too.
Harry snorted again. “Of course I will. But it won’t,” he said, pulling Draco towards the door. He paused as they reached it and turned to look at Draco. “It’ll be noisy. Just so you know.”
“I’m pleased for them too, honestly,” Draco said. “It was just a surprise. I wonder if Pansy knows…”
“I don’t know,” Draco replied, gathering up their coffee cups and depositing them in the bin. “It’s the same date every year.”
“I want to talk to you about this ‘date’,” Narcissa replied, sitting down at the table. She patted the surface opposite her.
“What?” Draco asked, blinking as he reached out to take the other cup from Harry.
“No, neither did I really. I mean, it started off really well, so I suppose we should have known,” Harry said with a shrug. “But I’m quite glad I was sceptical because this is gripping.”
“Absolutely,” Draco replied, his own breathing still laboured as he recovered from his orgasm. “What about you? Did that remind you of what you’ll be missing if you take that mission?”
Harry made a face. “Nasty. Give her my regards next time you hear from her then. Hopefully she’ll recover quickly.”
“I can do that,” Harry said with a grin. “Come through.”
In between making up all of the arrangements that were needed to decorate the wedding venue, they also had their regular customers to attend to. The winner of their dried flower competition was drawn and Draco had tried very hard not to gloat when his arrangement was deemed to be the best.
“ No. The
“Of course she does. Do you honestly think you’d still be here if she didn’t think that?” Draco said, raising one eyebrow.
“Well, if that happens, it’ll be a good thing,” Charlie said, nodding. “But have you thought about what you’ll do if it doesn’t?”
“I think so. Or perhaps they’re made earlier and kept under a charm to ensure they stay fresh,” Draco replied, lifting his sandwich off the plate and taking a bite.
which stuck itself to the bucket. Realistically, he knew that they weren’t likely to get any buyers if they put a higher price on them.
“Let’s get out of here then,” Ron said. “Hermione will be wondering where I am by now, I suppose. I didn’t realise it was so late.”
“Alright, alright,” Harry said, holding his hands up. “I’ll meet you here.”
Ron shook his head. “No. I forgot to extend it to cover me. The deliveries were all safe though.”
“It smells divine, darling,” Pansy said as her hand disappeared beneath the table to pat Theo on the leg.
“Who knows,” Molly sighed. “I’ve given up trying to understand these boys of mine!”
At five o’clock, having gone home first to drop off all his newly acquired presents and take a quick shower, Harry landed on Draco’s doorstep. He glanced around, smiling at the decorations and lights that had been installed along the row of houses. Everything was twinkling merrily and the snow that was starting to fall made it look like something from a film.
“What do you normally do?” Ron asked, his eyes wide.
“Oh, we’re fine,” Pansy said as she shut the door behind him. “It’s been a busy few weeks though.”
Harry snorted softly as he lifted his cup to take another drink.
Draco waved a dismissive hand in Harry’s direction as he left. Then he set about watering the plants.
The next day passed quickly. As Harry had hoped, they weren’t inundated with too many customers at once, but business was steady going all day. Eventually, they were closing up the shop again and preparing to head for Bookworms and Brews for their date.
Harry was still laughing as their lips met. He wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to Draco’s spontaneity or his fondness for celebrating something that he’d just read about in a Muggle newspaper, and if he was honest, he wasn’t sure he ever
Harry nodded, concentrating on the sign as he began to cast the spell. After a few moments, he was finished and put his wand away. He carefully set the sign up again and stepped back, watching to see whether anything would happen.
Draco snorted again. “Alright, so… ? You’ll have to think of something because I’m not as familiar with acceptable Muggle names.”
The conductor complied and the jaunty music disappeared, being replaced once more with a slow waltz. Breathing a sigh of relief, Draco turned back to Harry and fixed him with a look. “Potter, allow me to show you the
George shrugged. “Maybe. “
“Oh, really? And why couldn’t that discussion have waited?” Lucius asked, throwing an enquiring look at Harry, who opened his mouth to reply.
Draco smiled and kissed him again, bringing one hand up to cup the back of Harry’s neck.
“Exactly. Except you’re all settled down now, and even Ginny has a boyfriend, so there’s only me for her to worry about,” Harry sighed. “I don’t want her to worry about me. I’m
Draco shook his head as he pushed his chair in. “No, I’ll do them later on. There’s only the two plates we’ve used so they won’t take long.”
“Ah, I see. That makes sense,” Harry nodded. “Does the electricity not interfere with the magic?”
The next few seconds were silent as they concentrated on ripping the paper off.
Draco nodded, gesturing for Harry to go ahead of him through the shop. He checked the delivery door as they passed, making sure it was locked.
“Oh, please. That’s what you
Draco shrugged. “I’m happy for him. If he’s found someone that he’s ready to settle down for, then it can only be a good thing, can’t it?”
“Normally it makes me laugh,” Harry replied, turning back to the scene in front of him. “Not make me wash every single pot in the house before I can make a cup of coffee.”
that I will outbid everyone there. You’ll be in no danger.”
“Oh. Good thinking,” Harry said, smiling. “So, what will the prize be? A free bouquet or gift vouchers?”
Hermione laughed. “I wouldn’t expect anything else. I’ll call you both after I’ve finished my shift.”
“I didn’t know he’d react like that!”
Draco nodded. “We’ll write them off as wastage. Which, technically, they would be if we left them here over Christmas.”
“No, but I don’t think Mrs Weasley is the worst one,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “We’ve still got to tell George.”
“No problem. And just a regular latte,” Harry said, sitting back down in his chair. “Hope that’s okay.”
Harry laughed. “Alright, if you’re sure. Anyway, it’s your lunchtime. Should we put the sign out before you go?”
of all people. I don’t know if I should be offended that you’re choosing him and not me,” Charlie said, his grin widening.
Draco exchanged a look with Harry.
Turning, Draco rested his back against the door for a moment and breathed a sigh of relief. “I am exhausted,” he announced. “I’m so glad Valentine’s Day is only once a year.”
Harry nodded. “I will. He’ll be fine, don’t worry.”
“No problem. I’ll be back in a moment,” Draco said, heading back along the hall to the kitchen.
Harry tried to catch Draco’s eye, but Draco was very determinedly looking anywhere else but at Harry. Grimacing, Harry began to eat again, but as soon as his fork was on its way to his mouth, he felt Draco’s toes move again. This time, they traced the outline of his cock through his trousers (which were decidedly more uncomfortable than when they started eating). He swallowed the mouthful of lasagne, along with the groan that wanted to make itself known as his cock twitched.
“Well, which one was it?” Draco asked, his eyes wide. “You can’t just drop a bombshell like that on me and expect me to leave it alone.”
The rest of the week, as Harry had predicted, was mostly spent checking the sales receipts until they’d identified the flower-buying trends of the wizarding public. By the time the weekend came, Harry would have been quite glad if he never saw another sales receipt again. He and Draco had drunk copious amounts of coffee throughout the week and he felt like he might not sleep for the whole weekend.
Draco shook his head. “Of course I didn’t. I was just helping a friend out, nothing of the sort occurred to me,” the said, blinking. “I…”
They parted and settled themselves to watch as the sky changed from bright blue through a range of oranges, pinks and purples, Harry leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry shrugged. “That’s alright. You know I don’t mind helping with the display.”
Harry did so and the badge changed from reading ‘Support Cedric Diggory’ to read ‘Potter isn’t so bad’ and he laughed again. “I’m not so bad?”
Harry smiled and nodded. “Yeah… I’m not late, am I?”
Draco shook his head, looking smug.
Draco smiled. “Well, it was a bit of a surprise, but I’m kind of glad that you did it.”
Draco nodded, squeezing the mop out before beginning to swirl it around the floor, starting at the door.
Draco ran out of the kitchen and up the stairs again, heading straight into the bedroom. Harry was still lying motionless where he’d left him. Shaking his head again, Draco dropped back to his knees. He uncorked the vial and gently tipped Harry’s chin up until his mouth opened slightly, then he carefully trickled the antidote in.
“Have you gone out with him since?” Ron asked, jiggling Hugo around on his knee.
“Talk to Potter!” He heard Pansy call as he pulled his head back out of the fire. One thing was for certain, he was
“Healthy living is a good thing, isn’t it?” Draco asked with a frown as he broke a bit of his own Danish off and popped it into his mouth.
“I didn’t…” Ron muttered, looking around. “But, now you mention it, I’ll just have a look at the potted plants. I might take one of them for Hermione.”
“Me,” Narcissa replied. “I thought I would join you in your quick meal. If that is alright with you?”
“Ginny, believe it or not,” Harry said, shaking his head as he recalled the quick story he’d come up with the night before. “One of her team-mates apparently has a ‘thing’ for me.”
Draco laughed and slid one arm across Harry’s stomach. “I think I can do that. It would only be fair.”
“You’re my best friend! Best friends are supposed to listen!” Harry exclaimed, but he was laughing as he grabbed his cloak from the stand by the door. “Thanks again, Ron. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
The rest of October and November passed in a haze of stilted conversations and working on separate projects in the shop. If it wasn’t him on the receiving end, Harry would have been impressed at Draco’s ability to carry on a perfectly civil conversation while simultaneously giving Harry the cold shoulder.
Ron nodded and pulled a handful of coins out of his pocket. He counted out seven Galleons and dropped them into Harry’s outstretched hand. “Thanks, Harry. Enjoy your date and we’ll see you another day.”
“Me too,” Harry replied. He was currently behind the counter, wiping it over with a damp cloth to ensure any spills and dropped pollen were cleaned up. “Have you got any plans for tonight?”
As April ended and May began, Harry and Draco found themselves getting busier as the Spring wedding season got under way and the orders began building up. And so, it was on the second Wednesday of the month that Harry was surprised by Ron appearing in the shop.
Ron snorted. “You were playing ‘I Spy’ with Malfoy?”
Harry nodded. “It usually
“And that was the point of the charm,” Draco said, lifting his chin slightly. “Babbitty stays. You will have to deal with it.”
“Why in Merlin’s name are they so interested in us?” Harry asked with a sigh.
“Did he give you a chance to explain, or did he just leave?” Charlie asked.
“No, you’re not,” Charlie replied, shaking his head. “You’ve done what anyone would have done in your situation. Merlin knows I thought of doing something similar when I was younger. Mum was obsessed with me settling down with someone. But I also had six brothers to distract her from me.”
“A lot has changed over the years,” Harry said. “Whoever would have thought we would be friends with some of those Slytherins, eh?”
Harry shook his head at once. “No way. I wouldn’t enjoy that at all. Maybe it’s a sign I’m getting old, but I like being able to hear you when I’m talking to you.”
“Sounds good,” Harry said with a smile. “Do you see many people we know in here?”
Harry laughed. “Well then, that bodes well for when you do tell her.”
“Well, I’ve got all of my clothes, of course,” Draco replied, putting the box down. “And all of my books, school things and just general belongings.”
“Do you really want to?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
“No, funnily enough, there aren’t,” Harry laughed. “At least not in our shop. I can’t speak for others.”
“It was good,” Harry nodded. “We had a nice night.”
As the bell chimed once more when the door shut, Draco turned to Harry. “Make sure you revise your backstory for Adam before you go to The Burrow.”
Harry laughed, finally shaken from his stupor by the notion of George asking him out. “No, they’re solid as a rock. He asked if I wanted to go out with him and Angelina
relationship. He didn’t even know if they
Hermione smiled brightly at him. “I will. What, er, what were you two doing when I came in? You looked very happy about something.”
Harry watched him go, chewing lightly on the inside of his lip. He felt his stomach do a flip as he realised that things were going to be different for a little while. He understood, of course, but it didn’t make it any easier. Sighing, he took another bite of his sandwich, trying to finish it before the delivery arrived.
“Nothing would surprise me anymore,” Harry sighed. “I just hope this one is better than the last.”
“Oh good,” Harry said. “You’ll be able to do the baby one first thing then, and I’ll do the birthday one after. Do you think gold ribbon for the bow?”
“Another one? Who this time? A troll?” Draco asked, his eyebrows lifting in surprise.
“I am helping out a friend,” Draco said firmly. “There is nothing going on between Harry and I. And even if there was, we wouldn’t let it affect our work.”
Draco snorted. “That does make me feel a little bit better, yes. But it can wait a bit longer while we have coffee.”
“The sauce should be ready by now,” Draco said, leading him back along the hall to the lounge. “Sit yourself down and I’ll get you a drink. What would you like?”
“Alright, when you put it like that,” Harry replied, frowning again. “I suppose I can. Maybe we should have just met at one of our houses.”
it’s done.”
Draco laughed softly. “Like I wouldn’t recognise you. What do you take me for?”
Draco rolled his eyes and smiled. “Come on then. Let’s get it done so we can get out of here. It is Friday after all.”
“No, that’s good enough for what we want right now,” Draco nodded. He took out his own wand, casting the same spell as Harry had done. “Now let’s see what these bouquets look like.”
“Shush,” Harry muttered. “I know it’s not.”
“Who said anything about forever? We’re talking about a date,” Draco said as they watched the van reverse up to the door. “It only has to be forever if you want it to be.”
He pulled out his wand and flicked it, sending his cloak soaring across the room to the cupboard. Then he strode across to the cupboard in the lounge where he kept the few bottles of alcohol that he had. He pulled out a bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky and poured himself a large measure before carrying it across to his armchair which he slumped into.
“That’s the spirit,” Draco replied, grinning back before drinking the rest of his coffee.
Ron shrugged. “Don’t worry about it. I’m getting used to him, I think.”
“Really,” Draco replied, getting up and sitting on the edge of the bed. “I want to be here to see you every day after work, not just the weekends. I won’t care how tired you are, or how hurt you are, I just don’t want
Harry laughed. “Alright, so do you want me to nip back out and get us coffee before the delivery gets here?”
Harry snorted, then coughed as he choked on the mouthful of food he was eating. “Let me guess, there was washing on it at the time?”
“There’s your receipt,” the witch said, handing Harry a small piece of paper.
! Look, even Charlie has got someone now,” Hermione exclaimed, gesturing at Arlo who flushed slightly.
Saturday arrived quicker than either Harry or Draco had imagined it would, and no sooner had they walked into the shop that morning, it seemed that closing time was upon them.
Harry nodded slowly. “Alright, I suppose I can give it a go. I hate the thought of losing his friendship most of all. Who would have predicted that, eh?”
Draco broke the kiss briefly with a gasp. “Here?”
“What? But that’s dangerous,” Harry said incredulously. “He knows not to pick anything up if he doesn’t know the origin.”
“Well, we could do a voting thing. Put a box on the table and label each arrangement and get customers to vote on which one they like best. Then at the end of the week, or month or whatever, we count the votes and pick one person at random from the votes for the most popular arrangement to win a bouquet or arrangement of their choice,” Harry said. “Or we could offer gift vouchers?”
“I’ve just got back from a date,” Draco started, suddenly wondering if he really wanted to do this.
“Harry!”
“Of course I don’t. I’ll see you then,” Harry replied as he held Draco’s cloak out to him.
“Not just a bookshop. A café too,” Draco said. “They do the most exquisite pastries, and the coffee is good. I come here all the time.”
“Yeah, Jordan,” George replied with a nod. “He’s alright, loves Quidditch. I think you’d get on with him.”
Harry laughed, sliding one arm around Draco’s waist. “Oh yeah?”
Harry shook his head. “No, not at all. Half six is fine. I’m looking forward to it.”
“The delivery will be here shortly,” Draco said, screwing the paper wrapping from his sandwich into a ball. “We should have all of our supplies for the dried Christmas arrangements arriving today. We’ll be able to make a start on those this week. We need a display board put together to advertise them too, if you wouldn’t mind taking care of that.”
“It’s a bit different coming into a room full of people you didn’t get on with at school though, isn’t it?” Harry replied, picking up one of the tureens and taking off the lid to reveal a pile of steaming carrots. “Carrots?”
“Alright, alright, do continue. What will you be doing?” Draco said with a laugh of his own as he squirmed away from Harry’s prodding finger.
Charlie gave him a sympathetic look. “Ideally, yes but not everyone is good at talking about things like that. What will happen when you go back to work?”
Harry smiled and nodded. “I’m sure you will. Alright, have a good night, everyone,” he said with a wave.
“I know we both already have plans, but I would like to see you tomorrow,” Draco said, looking down at Harry from where he was perched on top of the stepladder. “What time will you be going to The Burrow?”
“Exactly. We can do a poster or a sign to put outside,” Harry said. “We might even get new customers.”
Making his way slowly to the bed, Draco looked around to see if there was anything suspicious. Shaking his head, he dropped to his knees at Harry’s side and watched him carefully. Upon seeing Harry’s chest rise and fall, he breathed a sigh of relief. “Okay, you’re not dead,” he muttered, looking around again. “What in Merlin’s name have you done though?”
“No, I don’t think so,” Draco said, picking his book up again and flipping through it. “It wasn’t as controversial as I thought it might be.”
The beautiful final artwork piece is by Peachbabypie.
Draco blinked and followed her into the warmth of the hallway, shrugging off his cloak. “How are you?”
“Probably. It just seemed like it would be fun,” Draco said. “I don’t go out often, as you know, but New Year’s Eve is always a totally different kettle of fish.”
“Harry, they’re both gorgeous!” Ginny exclaimed. “It was so hard to pick a favourite.”
Within moments of everyone sitting down, the hot tureens of vegetables began floating into the room.
Draco shook his head. “No, not yet. I was just thinking of brightly coloured ones. Maybe sunflowers if we can get some.”
“Well, when you put it like that, neither did I,” Harry said with a huff of laughter. “It was nice though.”
Ginny nodded. “Yes. He’s nothing like I remember him from school.”
“Of course not,” Draco chuckled. “We’ll go back to where we arrived. It’s secluded enough.”
“Definitely. I have a written description of what they want, but I’ll need to sketch it out tomorrow,” Draco replied, following Harry out onto the street and pulling the door closed behind him.
“Because I didn’t have the proper face to be bad,” Harry replied without missing a beat. “Unlike you.”
Alice hovered in the doorway for a few moments until Draco looked over at her. “We’d like to take him, please.”
“What’s wrong with you?” Draco asked, watching as Harry flung the cupboard door open and hung his cloak inside, a little bit more aggressively than was necessary.
Draco laughed. “I certainly hope so. I think we might finish that book today, you know.”
“Then don’t say anything, just kiss me again,” Draco said with a grin.
“Through work. He came in for some flowers for his mother’s birthday,” Harry said immediately.
“It’s two weeks until Christmas, do you think we’ll be this busy until the actual week?” Harry asked, pushing his hair off his forehead as he concentrated on weaving the dried flowers into his arrangement.
“But if it works out, then you’d have the best of both worlds,” Pansy said. “Lover, best friend and colleague all rolled into one.”
Draco nodded slowly. “That’s good. I know we normally do the spring bouquets and they always go down well. I’ve never thought about doing dried arrangements on the same theme.”
“See you soon, Harry,” Charlie said warmly, taking a handful of Floo powder from the tin on top of the fireplace.
“Ah. No. That is not my style at all,” Draco said, shaking his head. “After spending so long looking at all that mahogany and dark paint, I vowed to have something completely different when I bought the place. Do you like it?”
“Yeah, I know what you mean,” Harry said as he opened the notepad. “Some things are just a surprise hit, I suppose.”
“I was just thinking about how I’ve never seen this street empty,” Harry said, grinning. “And I was admiring the fairy lights.”
“Well, I wasn’t thrilled as you can imagine,” Ron said with a snort as he dolloped mashed potato onto his plate. “But from what I can tell, he’s not too bad. Better than I remember from school anyway.”
As the Portkey glowed ever brighter, they were suddenly whisked away from their kitchen and Harry closed his eyes. He found it helped with the nausea as they spun. A few moments later, he felt their momentum slowing and he opened his eyes again, thankful that he had managed to learn how to land softly now.
Shrugging his cloak off and hanging it in the cupboard, he walked back through the house, lighting the lamps with a flick of his wand. He grabbed a plate from the cupboard and set about dishing up his chow mein. Then he went to the fridge and poured himself a glass of water from the jug. He looked at the table, considering whether he wanted to eat in the kitchen, or take his plate into the lounge to eat on the sofa. A split second later, his decision was made and he was walking through the hall and into the lounge.
Monday morning arrived and Harry walked into Paperwhite’s at six-thirty on the dot.
Harry blinked again and looked down at the notepad. Draco’s looping handwriting covered the page, listing all of the details of the order. Then, without another word, he headed into the back room.
“No, it’s not too bad,” Draco said, nodding. “Right, let’s see if we can fix this hinge.”
When they parted, Draco rested his forehead against Harry’s. “We have time for some breakfast here before the key activates again. Fancy a croissant?”
“To share?” Draco asked, looking at Harry out of the corner of his eye.
As he took a drink, he wondered what had possessed Harry to do what he’d done. While he knew he hadn’t exactly been honest with Harry about his own feelings, he hadn’t outright lied to him. Apart from the treacle tart. Sighing, he tipped his head back against the chair. He’d meant it when he’d told Pansy that he was afraid of ruining the friendship between himself and Harry by attempting a relationship, but it looked like that had been managed before anything had even happened. Could they possibly get past this?
Draco shook his head slightly as he gathered the old display flowers into small bunches, putting the best ones into a bucket. With a flick of his wand, he conjured a sign reading
“Well of course we can. A colour theme for the display is a good idea though,” Draco replied. “What did you have in mind?”
volunteer to be auctioned! Then I can bid on
“That… actually sounds good,” Harry said slowly. “You wouldn’t mind?”
Draco turned to look at the clock. “About time we started the clean up. I don’t think we’ll get anyone else in today.”
Angelina’s cousin.”
Hermione jumped slightly and turned to face him. “Oh, Harry, we–”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, absolutely fine. I liked it there, it was nice and cosy, and easy to have a conversation. Not like some of the bars.”
“What name are you thinking?”
Charlie watched him for a moment, chewing quietly on one of the biscuits. “So, what is it that you needed to chat about?” he asked, swallowing.
Charlie nodded and disappeared for a moment before the flames roared again and he was stepping out of the fireplace. Brushing himself off, he turned to Harry and held out a hand.
“Oh,” Harry said, swallowing the mouthful of pie he had in his mouth, and instantly regretting it – the gravy inside the pie was scalding hot. He made a sort of squeaking noise and grabbed his glass of water, taking a big drink before nodding his head. “Yeah, it was… it was good.”
“You’re joking, right?” Ron asked hopefully.
“No? Alright,” Harry replied, the corner of his mouth twitching into a smile as he looked past Draco. “Table?”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked immediately, noticing the frown. “Surely Rosa Lee didn’t mess up your sandwich?”
“You sweep and I’ll mop?” Harry suggested, not managing to suppress the smile that was creeping onto his face.
Finally everyone at the table had served themselves and they began to eat. They hadn’t been eating for five minutes when Molly turned to Harry from her place at the head of the table. “So, Harry, Hermione tells me you had a date at the weekend? How did it go?”
“Glad to hear it. I have better things to do with my time than rearranging dinner appointments with you,” Lucius remarked with a sniff.
Before they could reminisce any further, there was a knock at the door.
“No I know it’s not,” Ron replied, shaking his head. “But Hermione was on about doing things for our parents
“For six months? You would not have. You’d have tolerated it for maybe two, then you would have told me to buck my ideas up and get back out on the scene,” Pansy said, gesturing at him with a glass that she’d picked up. “What makes Potter so different?”
“Exactly,” Draco replied with a grin of his own. “Oh, look, we’re here.”
Draco snorted. “Wait until he’s been in the business for a few years. He’ll become as jaded as you.”
“I think you’d be surprised. They don’t really hold grudges,” Harry replied. “Well, Ron does but you’ve already got past that with him. The rest are easy.”
“Yes. It seemed the safest option considering the position of the flat,” Draco replied, swallowing the mouthful he’d just taken. “I didn’t want to accidentally break the Statute because a Muggle happened to glance in my window just as I’m using my wand to light the lamps or something.”
“I know what you mean,” Draco chuckled. “Working with the dried stems is definitely tougher than working with fresh.”
“Hey, don’t bring us into this!” Charlie protested, shaking his head. “I’ve already given you my opinion on this.”
Harry stood up and followed Draco back into the kitchen where there was now a small dining table sitting to one side. It was set for two. “This wasn’t here before.”
a table and you’re not eating off a tray in the lounge,” Harry replied with a grin. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that either, I suppose.”
“Why was it in place?” Draco asked with interest. “The war?”
“Here, this way,” Draco said, slipping past Harry as they reached the end of the aisle and guiding him to the left. “There’s a slightly cosier alcove down here. Not many people come down this way.”
“That would look nice,” Harry nodded, grabbing the sweeping brush and beginning to sweep the floor. “There’s a nice pink ribbon in the drawer too, plus plenty of white.”
“So it would appear,” Draco murmured, raising his eyebrows as he stood up, ready to follow Pansy into the dining room.
“Harry.”
“Look. I am happy for you, I promise. But it’s nearly one o’clock in the morning and I’ve had way too much to drink to be able to process this properly right now,” Ron said, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I need to go home.”
“I don’t think any of them are the same as they were at school,” Harry said, picking up the nearest gravy boat and beginning to smother his food. “Same as we probably aren’t.”
Molly flushed, though she looked very pleased with the compliment. “Oh, don’t be silly. You’ll have to forgive me, Charlie didn’t mention that he was bringing a guest,” she said, giving Charlie a stern look.
“I don’t mind. What do you want to do?”
“Of course we are. Half six at Bookworms,” Draco said, picking up the two bouquets to carry them into the back room. “Unless you had a different time in mind?”
“I know,” Harry said, sitting back beside Draco, their shoulders pressing together again. “I mean, we’re still a few months away from it being a whole year, but yeah. I can’t believe we’ve been doing this for so long.”
Draco smiled, shuffling close to Harry and resting his head on the pillow, one arm draped across Harry’s stomach.
Ron shook his head, his arms folded across his chest.
“I know. I promise you, I am fine,” Draco said. “I am very happy with my life at the moment. Everything is going well.”
The rest of the week was quiet, as far as the pre-orders went and before they knew it, Monday arrived and, yet again, Harry was walking into the shop with a face like thunder. This time though, Draco was prepared. He was in the back room as Harry stomped through the door and, instead of greeting him as he normally would, Draco simply held out a takeaway cup of coffee.
“Fake,” Draco muttered, ignoring the look that Theo was giving him. “Obviously.”
“Really? Do you not think it would be better to choose something that begins with a different letter?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “How easy would it be to say my name instead of David?”
“Oh, of course,” Charlie said, nodding. “Did you last the night or end it early?”
Draco gave him an innocent-looking grin. “Do you? Even though they’re trugs?”
“Find a seat first,” Harry replied. “Just in case it’s busy.”
Draco smiled and nodded again. “I know. It is
Harry pulled his wand out too and stepped forward. “I’m sure I know a spell.”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, looking at Harry in surprise. “I think these look great.”
Harry and Draco looked at each other.
“Okay,” Harry nodded. “I’ll sort it, don’t worry.”
“Oh. Not what I expected,” Ron said, making an impressed face.
Two hours later, they closed their books with a sigh of satisfaction.
Harry shook his head. “Not at first. I knew I shouldn’t be doing it, but it was already too late. I thought that if I told you the truth you might put a stop to the dates. So I was selfish. The dates were a bright spot in my week, or month, and I didn’t want to lose them. I really can’t apologise enough. I should have been able to talk to you about what I was feeling.”
“We don’t have any poppies,” Harry said. “They haven’t come in yet.”
“Take as long as you want, you’ve earned it after all,” Draco replied with a shrug. “I’ll be alright on my own. I can’t see us having a mad rush this afternoon.”
“He’s taken a potion,” Draco replied. “But he doesn’t have the antidote.”
Draco nodded. “Yes, I suppose it did. Even if you did help it along a little bit.”
“No, I don’t want to think about it, really,” Harry replied. “But I suppose I’ll have to. I don’t want to push him to talk about it if he’s not ready.”
“I wish I had been!” Ron snorted. “Rose isn’t well, so Hermione stayed home to look after her.”
Harry shook his head, laughing to himself as he carried the sign to the door and putting it outside the entrance to the shop. He made sure not to block the pavement or the actual doorway and then stepped back to admire the sign again briefly before heading back into the shop.
“Definitely,” Harry nodded. “I’ll get them this time though. Cake too?”
“That makes sense,” Harry nodded. “And, for what it’s worth, your efforts are definitely paying off.”
“We’ll see what happens when we get there, shall we?” Harry suggested with a smile.
Molly smiled warmly at him before looking down at her plate and continuing to eat.
Draco flushed slightly. “Thank you. I’m glad to hear you think that. I’ve worked hard to put those days behind me since we left school.”
Draco grinned. “My thoughts exactly. I think we’ll like the book I’ve picked. The blurb grabbed me straight away.”
“So, this charity thing,” Draco began, running a hand up and down Harry’s arm as they laid in bed. “I was thinking we could do an auction.”
Charlie laughed too. “I know, I’m just kidding. I’m glad you still consider me a good enough friend to talk to me like this.”
They turned away from each other and headed for home.
“Oh, sorry,” Harry said, turning back to the counter. “Two chicken salad sandwiches and two lattes please.”
“I wasn’t sure if you might have changed your mind,” Draco said, carefully climbing down the stepladder.
“Working,” George replied, making a face. “She doesn’t have to work Sundays very often, it just happens that this is one of them. I’ll take her a plate of food home, though.”
“Lead the way,” Draco replied. “And promise to protect me if this all goes wrong.”
“Of course,” Draco said with a snort. “Surprise me.”
“Nothing wrong with that,” George chipped in from his place on the sofa behind Ginny. “Look how long it took me and Angelina to get together.”
“Good choice, Potter,” Draco said with a grin as he took a sip of his coffee. “You can go again another time.”
The next day, Harry stomped into Paperwhite’s with a face like thunder, making Draco jump.
“What? Draco, why not?” Pansy demanded.
“Right, I’ll see you tomorrow,” Harry said, turning and walking backwards away from Draco. “You don’t need me in early, do you?”
Molly looked at him in confusion. “What do you mean? I thought…”
He continued on his way, passing a few other people on their way to work. It was the same every morning, they smiled and nodded at each other and Harry was grateful for the familiar routine to distract him from what may happen when he walked into Paperwhite’s. Halfway along the alley, he entered the coffeeshop and ordered two coffees and two bacon sandwiches, hoping that Draco hadn’t eaten yet.
“No, seriously, I know that Mother didn’t hire you because you’re Harry Potter. She hired you because she knew you’d work hard,” Draco continued. “The fact you are Harry Potter might have helped at times, but believe me, if the bouquets you made were shit, you’d know about it.”
Draco laughed. “You’re not getting old, well, you are but it’s fine, it’s happening to us all. If it makes you feel better, I like being able to have a proper conversation too.”
“Good. You’re the only one in this place that doesn’t look at me as though I’m going to cast an Unforgiveable any second,” Draco muttered. “Well, apart from Pansy, anyway.”
Charlie rolled his eyes. “In small doses, yes. Anyway, I hate to drink my tea and run, but I really should be getting back. Are you okay now?”
Draco laughed softly. “You’ve got it all planned then. And here I was thinking that I was the sneaky one, saving you from bad dates.”
“Around our age, yes. I think that’s the most believable?” Harry said, tilting his head slightly.
“We could, I mean, we
“Then we’ll do that. It’ll be good,” Draco said, a small smile appearing on his face as he turned away from Harry, walking into the back room.
“Yeah, of course,” Harry said, nodding. “Have you eaten? I could do you a healthy fry-up too… although it will be without eggs now.”
Draco smiled. “I know. It’s alright, I appreciate that you worry about me. But this is fine. I do need to get something to eat before I meet him though.”
“I know, I remembered,” Draco smiled as he took a bite of his cake. “You mentioned it at work once.”
Hermione smiled as she took the flowers. “Merry Christmas to you, too. These are lovely, Harry.”
“Definitely. I always like adding a new regular to our books,” Draco replied, smiling. “And if they want to sing our praises to all their friends, then even better.”
“Well, when you put it like that, I see your point,” Ron said with a laugh. “Certainly sounds like an easier life than the Aurors anyway.”
“Well, maybe not right now,” Harry conceded. “In a few minutes.”
“Sounds good to me,” Harry nodded, opening his book too. “We can discuss as we read though, yes?”
started it!” Harry exclaimed, his voice rising enough to cause a few of the other patrons to turn towards them.
“Then I look forward to trying it,” Arlo replied.
Ron sighed again. “I can’t believe this,” he muttered. “Why
“You bet your arse I am,” Draco replied. “I’ve had to share you all afternoon. I want some time alone with you now.”
“Alright, if you insist,” Draco said, holding his hands up. “While you’re gone, I’ll make a start on watering everything.”
Harry groaned and collapsed onto one of the stools that were behind the counter.
“Don’t I know it.” Draco grinned. “Alright, enough talking about the table. Come and get some food.”
“Yes, please,” Harry said, leaning forward to put his plate on the low table. “Let’s get another chapter read.”
When they parted, Harry felt an immediate sense of loss. The explosion of butterflies in his stomach slowly calmed down as he continued to gaze back at Draco. “Well?”
wanted me to leave.”
“At least we’re on the same page, then,” Draco said, returning the smile. “Okay, how do you want to do this? Do you want to open first? Or should I go first? Together?”
Ronald gives them a strange look before coughing. "Harry, Malfoy sure is busy too."
"We talk sometimes, yes."
"Professor Malfoy, you may retire. You and Professor Potter look tired, I'll take care of this." She smiles at him wearily. Draco doesn't have time to apologize because what did Potter have to do with the conversation?
"Do you want to go get something for breakfast?"
"Well, it seems we lost, what a pity." Neville shrugs before walking down the bleachers to congratulate Potter who is waiting with the Gryffindor boys.
Point.
The alcohol rose through his veins, he felt like a layer under his skin that burned, as if he had been injected with adrenaline and all he could feel is the rising heat in his blood, a fervent need to shoot all his energy into something.
"I took the Defense Against the Dark Arts position this year, I'm a teacher now." Seamus hits him friendly as a congratulation.
"Neville sent me for his potion."
They knock on the door, the number thirteen, it takes two seconds to open until a black woman opens the door. She wears a scarf that covers her head like a tiara. She takes off her reading glasses slowly and gasps several times before either of the three can speak.
Harry cringed internally and thought that it would really be a supreme time for the ground to swallow him forever. “
When Harry stepped into the shower on the other side of the wall from Malfoy’s bedroom in the second floor, he realized that he’d, despite of the sun cream, gotten a bit of a sunburn on his shoulders and waist. It stung in the warm water and was red under his touch. Harry dried himself, dabbing carefully over the burned part with the towel, and returned to the bedroom. The outside doors were open, and Malfoy was standing on the small balcony, looking over the sea in thought. His golden hair was gently swinging in the salty breeze, and his blue cotton shirt was moving back and forth around his body. He looked so peaceful, Harry hated to interrupt it.
gave you this statement? I thought Blackburn was yanking my chain the other day when he said Malfoy was one of the wizards there, bloody hell,” the man was shaking his head in disbelief. Harry was still a bit wound up about his encounter with Malfoy the previous day, and didn’t know the appropriate response to offer. He was just hoping Patrick would say something else. “Haven’t seen that git in almost a decade and he shows up now in the middle of a bloody investigation. Can we trust him, do you reckon?”
for advice in the matters of the heart that concerned her own son? Clearly it was, but lately Harry had been feeling like he was drowning in a sea of his emotions, and that Narcissa was a life raft he desperately needed to get his head from under the water. Some of Malfoy’s dramatics had clearly rubbed off on Harry.
In the afternoon Harry found himself thinking about Malfoy again. He didn’t know how it happened, the git was just always in the back of his mind, lurking, waiting for the right opportunity to hijack Harry’s thoughts. Did Malfoy like Harry? Did he
in his head.
“Ey, what’s that supposed to mean? Are you taking the piss?” Ron furrowed his eyebrows menacingly at Harry, who instantly remembered that Ron had only made the team in his fifth year, and would not have made the cut the year after if it wasn’t for Hermione’s Confundus Charm she used on Cormac McLaggen.
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled, ashamed, and noticed that his pizza didn’t taste as wonderful as it had before. It had gone a bit cold, too. Harry was chewing on the dough that was just rolling around in his mouth, not making its way to his stomach. He hated how insufferable he always had to be.
for Malfoy to be his… dance partner at this point, and anything else beyond that point. None of it was in Harry’s control, he had wanted to get rid of Malfoy from the start, but he would have never guessed the cost at which his wish would come true.
“You can relax, your beloved Weasel is still intact, he and Granger have been visiting you every day, despite the Healers telling them you’d only be waking up beginning of this week, insufferable loyalty in my opinion.” Malfoy placed the clipboard back on the foot of Harry’s bed. “Now, if you don’t mind sitting up some more…” he fished out a stethoscope and flung it around his neck with routine, before giving Harry a meaningful look.
The next day Harry returned to work wearing simple dark maroon robes, he had had enough of the scratchiness of the silver embroidery. Besides, today he wouldn’t have to see anyone outside the employees of the Ministry.
“I can imagine,” Harry nodded, “I have to confess I haven’t flown in a good while.” He didn’t even own a broom currently, and he had just given up his gift card to QQS, not that he couldn’t afford one himself.
The case itself was pretty clear-cut: someone had thrown a brick through the shop’s window the past Saturday night and managed to escape with multiple professional racing brooms. Harry had to shake his head at the crude style of the break-in; one would think that magic folk would have some sort of creativity when it came to robbing things, at least vanishing the showcase or something. Anyone could Reparo a window!
“Ivanovski was quite easy to crack, he admitted to having sold memory potions for a good price to some people at Knockturn Alley a few days ago. However, he’s a small player, only a middleman to one distributor. After some persuasion he revealed that there are several distributors all around London, who are apparently getting the potions from one source.” Evergrey was hectically going through his parchments and handed one over to Harry, “A copy of his statement.”
Narcissa was quiet for a long time. She handed Harry the teacup and sat back down in the armchair, absentmindedly stirring the tea with a dainty silver spoon. “So, you read the letter, then,” she said, and took a careful sip, before turning her gaze back to Harry. Her expression was expectant. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and nodded, he went around the coffee table and sat back down on the edge of the sofa.
“Are you ready?” Malfoy asked, extending his arm, and it took Harry a second to realize that it was in offer of a side-Apparition. Harry was still a tad groggy from his long nap, and reckoned that Apparition would probably make him feel worse, but he swallowed any argument he might have had, and grabbed Malfoy’s arm firmly. The last thing before they sent off swirling through space, was Harry’s realization that he could feel the man’s bicep under the shirt.
“Fine,” Malfoy scowled, “I suppose you have a point. Didn’t think you’d still be so bitter about the pins though,”
After they had eaten, and Harry had insisted he’d get the check, after a long debate with Malfoy, they emerged from the small restaurant back onto the street. It had quieted down, but it seemed that all the people were now gathered in the restaurants. It had become dark outside, and the pair had to rely on streetlights to see where they were going. The Italian night still seemed livelier and more radiant than any British night ever, and the men agreed to walk back to Malfoy’s place instead of Apparating. Harry was full of energy after napping earlier, and didn’t mind a long walk back.
Upon answering the door, Malfoy seemed almost taken aback by Harry’s disordered appearance, his eyes widening for a millisecond, and his lips parting slightly, but he composed himself quickly, his expression hardening. It was probably important to note that Malfoy was rather awkwardly holding a potted plant in his hands. This must have been the second or the third time the git had appeared at Harry’s place after announcing that they’d never see each other again. Despite his indifferent manner, Harry now knew why Malfoy was there, although the plant did confuse him, and Harry was glad he was there; he didn’t want to leave things how they had been a few days ago, when he was angry at Malfoy.
When he arrived in his office, Evergrey was already there. “Any news on Dubois?” Harry asked tiredly even though he already knew the answer, barely 15 minutes had passed. Patrick seemed to guess his thoughts, “The day is still young, Blackburn and Twigs are getting on it now.”
, story. There’s no excuse for acting like a shithead! However, before Harry had the time to express these thoughts, Malfoy continued, “I thought you were off the case though, so what are you doing loitering in my mother’s yard?”
“Trust me, I know her,” Harry said confidently, “she’ll help us, I’ve never been more sure of anything.”
“I know,” Malfoy replied, his response quiet but immediate, Harry realized that he wasn’t the only one feeling the finality of the moment, “I’m sorry, I’ve got to go.” Whereas Harry wanted to drag out the time, Malfoy had decided to end their torment, coldly but mercifully. Leaving now meant that they could both start processing the past weeks quicker, to get over them faster.
“Are you still on about that? I’ll be fine, it’s been what…
Both of them were quiet for a long while. Harry was still fidgeting with his keys, and the bitter damp air started getting inside his coat and freeze his bones. It was half an hour to midnight, and the cold combined with his fatigue made him tremble most slightly. To his horror, Malfoy seemed to notice this, and astonishingly extended his heating charm on Harry with a discreet swish of his wand. A warm wave of dry air filled Harry immediately, and he lowered his arms from where they were, clutched around him to keep the heat inside. That was probably the nicest thing Malfoy had ever done for Harry, except for saving his life that one time, but this was quite remarkable nonetheless. Harry nodded as a thank you, because his jaw was still numb with cold.
Draco looked taken aback, like Hermione had just personally promised to break Lucius out of jail. “I… thank you,” he stammered, and gave a nod at her. Maybe, for the first time, he was starting to see a light flickering at the end of what was admittedly turning out to be a very long tunnel.
“Yes, although I don’t know him that well, at all, really,” Hermione sat up straight in her chair and cleared her throat, “but it seems that he’s trying to get your attention, and the ball is now in your court.” The ball? What ball was she talking about? Did she mean that it was up to Harry to make the next move? Bollocks, he knew he would get horrible advice from Hermione, she was too sensible to ever suggest something as ineffective as ‘just let it go’.
Now Hermione let out a frustrated sigh and gave Harry a very final stare. “Look, even if he doesn’t feel the same way, you’ll feel loads better having explored the option than if you’re left to wonder.” Harry hated when she made good points, because they never let him off the hook.
“W-what?” Harry stumbled.
“Are you even hearing yourself?” Harry was essentially shouting now, trying to form words so quickly he would be able to shower Kingsley with a lecture of a lifetime, Harry tried to frantically come up with a way to change his mind, “It’s not a ‘win-win’, you’re murdering a bunch of people for political gain, that’s what’s happening here,” he tried to make Kingsley realize the reality of what he was about to do, “I don’t even recognize you anymore.”
That night he couldn’t sleep, it felt like every time he was drifting off, a stinging pain from one of the damaged bones woke him up, and he had to admit to himself that a little drop of the painkiller he had gotten from the hospital wouldn’t hurt. He took a small gulp of the bitter liquid and within minutes it had taken effect, minutes after that Harry was already asleep in his bed.
Harry raised his eyebrow and crossed his arms on his chest, his shirt about thirteen years too tight, he’d have to change it as soon as Malfoy got in. He was already disappointed in himself knowing that the git would come in one way or another, he always got what he wanted, the bastard. “Well, I was planning on going to the gym, for starters,” Harry protested weakly.
“Good times,” Malfoy replied dryly, “but
“Uhh… so, your mum told me that you used to be… well, obsessed with me,” Harry blurted out and regretted it immediately, he should just have kept his mouth shut to begin with, although he had to add, “I swear I didn’t pry, she just kind of said it.” Now Malfoy was turning a deep shade of red, and immediately looked away from Harry, he smoothed his hair and put his hands in his pockets, then took them out, then rocked side to side switching which leg to stand on. Harry didn’t know what to say, but he was pretty sure that nothing he would say would make the situation better, it would most definitely make it worse.
Judging on the look that Kingsley now gave to Harry, he saw right through his little act. “Who would’ve known you’d grow up to be such a schemer.” He was shaking his head to himself.
After, the pair got out of the fountain, and dried themselves up, all without saying anything. The moment was perfect as it was, and in a way, they were both afraid that if they were to say something, it would break the illusion. So, they walked home in silence, hand in hand, through the warm, dark, Italian night.
After some more cursing and rubbing his eyes, Malfoy ripped open the letter, squinting at the text. Harry was monitoring his expression, to try and figure out what the letter said. After a few seconds, Malfoy went white under his tan, and then a tad green. His hands started to shake as he squeezed the piece of parchment tightly.
Harry couldn’t finish his question before the man darted forward, black robes behind him, grabbed Harry’s face and kissed him forcefully. Harry let out a surprised whimper, his eyes closing reflexively. He must have been dreaming, right?
A furious red spread from Malfoy’s ears to his face and his expression tightened again to something heated. “I just like to look nice, that’s all,” he murmured through gritted teeth, his stare piercing.
“Maybe next time I’ll stay for tea,” Draco hummed and took a step towards Harry, making him lightheaded of the implications. Harry felt himself swaying were he stood, he felt extremely aware of how small the gap was between him and something very tempting. “You know…” Draco continued, his nose almost nuzzling Harry’s now. “If you’ll still have me–“
Right, what was Harry going to do with two pairs of Extendable Ears and chocolates laced with love potion?
He admits that it's normal to have a crush with a teacher, he himself had it, but sometimes the students exceeded it. Like that time, at Christmas his first year as a professor where Mathilda Lambert gave him a box of chocolates with amortentia. That was a severe afternoon of talking with her parents and student tears. McGonagall prohibited her from doing it again unless she wanted to be expelled. Of course she didn't stop him in the hallways again, but she still feels their gazes as she passes by the large dining room.
In reality, vacations are just more work outside of school, planning and reviewing homework, what he has in mind for the end of the year when his students finish their studies at Hogwarts, and what plants would be more interesting to freshmen who seems less interested in Herbology than they might be in Charms. He doesn't know what he was thinking about when he decided to leave two essays on lava paprika to the second-year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws.
Draco laughs. "Like you care." Harry frowns in imitation.
November, 2006.
"Miss Kingsley, I didn't expect to have you here," he says politely, but hopes the slightly stern tone will stop the girl. She still had third-year Gryffindor class essays to score, and the conclusions about ginger in healing potions were mixed. Especially if you had Emmeline Vance's daughter in your class, as upright and strict as her mother, but clearly less introverted.
Today he was grading an essay he commissioned on oak seeds in his own classroom because the last few weeks Potter had decided that the staff room was the best place to spend his free time. They had the same hours, except Monday and late Friday, where sometimes, if he was lucky, he decided that going flying on his broom was a better idea than staying in the staff room to grade essays and homework.
Harry nods, arranging his hair in a vague attempt to keep it decent. "There's a place, I mean... Uh there's a place in my hotel room, if you want ..."
"He'll never be interested in me that way, will he?" Harry purses his lips and drapes an arm over his shoulder to pull him into a hug. "What a fool I am! Who would date a dumb herbology professor with Atticus as a friend? Surely they are boyfriends... Oh no, they are boyfriends and they are the perfect couple. Atticus Bulstrod and his beautiful brown hair, why would Ernie want another blonde?"
They don't talk to each other during the New Years Eve party, they don't hug each other at midnight, and neither looks at each other during the toast, and for some reason, Draco feels guilty.
"Yeah, that sounds better."
"To have punishment at Hogwarts you have to study here, and I am expelling you right now." Jerome's face warps, changing the smug smile to a face of fear and outrage. "So go get your things or I'll send everything you got to be burned."
And this had to be a fucking joke.
Malfoy is silent as Neville checks the leaves of his crops. He firmly believed that Harry Potter was plotting a trick against his home, he was sure, what other reason would have him so happy to be the stupid referee of the match? The idiot was a Quidditch fan, but even he wouldn't be happy being a mere mediator in the game.
"M-may I ask...? How did my parents take on you and Remus and Sirius?"
"What happened? Why do you smell so bad?" Potter asks breathing through his mouth.
"You have to drink Flitwick's smoke liquor," he laughs. He notices Draco's presence and points it at him, he rolls his eyes. "Come in Harry, or are you also being a bitter fool?"
"Mr. Malfoy!" Principal Mcgonagall gets to her feet just as or more furious than Draco. "We'll call the Slytherin team to confirm or not their innocence. Argus, call the Slytherin Quidditch team. And you, you better calm down or I'll take my measurements."
"Jenna and Kevin can't agree on positions." And ask me if I know anything about Quidditch. I don't even know the basic rules! Ron was always there to explain to me what the hell was going on in the field."
Draco rolls his eyes. "Don't be stupid, Longbottom, if that guy doesn't realize how handsome and smart you are it's because he's too stupid and doesn't deserve you. Also, have you seen Atticus? He is not one of those who have a boyfriend."
"Tomorrow don't you'll come to ask me for help with your hangover, Longbottom." He points his finger at it. He rotates in his place ready to go to sleep, perhaps to give himself some attention, or whatever the dream he was feeling in his eyelids gave him.
Connor looks at him gratefully as he nods. Tears fall down his cheeks, but he doesn't cry anymore.
"Potter." Draco just nodded in greeting as he poured the potion into a vial. Harry took small, careful steps forward until he was in front of him. He was wearing a pair of Muggle jeans and a rather baggy old shirt with a pattern unrecognizable to him, a drawing of a mouse with red shorts and gloves on his big hands, rather silly, in his opinion.
"Have a wonderful first day!" Draco yells near Neville.
"You are better now?" He asks and Neville has to do his best to understand. The man seems to understand Neville's bewilderment because he smiles. "About your cold."
"I don't dislike him."
"It's David Bowie, Ron." Harry gets into the conversation by handing him a napkin that he greets with a smile.
"I do not think so." Harry snorted.
Neville and Draco sat together on the Hufflepuff bleachers. Neville had made a funny face after seeing how warm Draco was, with at least a sweater and a green corduroy coat. Not counting the scarf and thick woolen gloves.
"Damn it, Potter." Do you have to appear out of nowhere all the time?" He growls.
"Well, send someone, I don't know."
"Secrets aren't supposed to be told, bigmouth!" Teddy is walking up to Evan to give him a smack.
September, 2006
"I heard you the first time, Potter. I'm on it."
"Thanks for the invitation, Ernie, but I don't think it's ideal." Draco laughs sarcastically as soon as Harry finishes speaking.
And that must be the alcohol putting words in his mouth.
"What did you want to talk about?"
Draco opens the windows with a movement of the wand of him, but it is not enough. They can not stand retaining the breath a second more, so he moves his hands so that everyone leaves the classroom. Not without first throwing himself a spell to remove his smell.
At what point in a friendship is it reasonable to ask about the other's sexuality?
Of course the man was occupying his thoughts since the night of the bar, or since he saw him two years after the wizarding war, even since they met at that Ginny party. And Merlin, Merlin knows it was never his intention, but he hadn't been able to stop the train of thought even in the showers, when his hands run up his torso and he imagines that they are Ernie's rough fingers touching every corner of his. And sighs come out. And then his hands go down to the hair mat and he feels so guilty that he can't go on.
"Neville! Are you okay?" Man's heart stops when he hears that voice. He turns in the water feeling the drops fall hard on his body that is shivering with force. Ernie Macmillan, so handsome with his blond hair and hideous Muggle sweater, watches him with huge blue eyes and an expression of palpable concern.
How pathetic you are, Longbottom, Draco thinks, but doesn't say.
Frowning, Harry nods at him, pointing to the cauldron. The volcanic rock has already gone up, the potion is ready and if he give it to him quicker he'll soon get it out of his sight. He takes a container and pour as much liquid as he can into it. He makes a note with clear instructions and hands him the knob. He takes it and looks at it for a couple of seconds without bothering to thank. He wants to tell him to leave, but it's not necessary because Potter is already leaving the classroom until he stops in the middle and without turning to look at him he says:
This causes Draco to laugh out loud which is followed by Harry who leans over towards the box with decorations and falls almost crushing the decorations, causing both of them to laugh much more than before.
Draco can see Neville on the floor dancing alongside Ernie to one of those stupid Liam Hyland songs like they're really good. And he can't help but roll his eyes when Neville pretends to stumble to get closer to Ernie.
"How was your day today?" Draco hates him, wants him far, far away, and very quiet.
Harry laughs, as if what Draco said was the funniest shit he'd ever heard from him, and well, with friends like Weasley and Granger, he didn't doubt it. "Luckily he didn't say anything to me, so I can help."
Maybe this was just his chance to show Ernie MacMillan how good a fit Neville Longbottom was as a future boyfriend aka husband, aka father of his children. He would have to send a letter to Luna and Ginny to talk about this as soon as possible. Draco wasn't an expert on relationships and Harry had been single since that girl from the ministry three years ago.
Neville scowls at him, narrowing his eyes. Malfoy keeps his expression mocking.
"I'm sorry, Director!" Teddy's hair turns red again and the students laugh. "Hufflepuff misses this chance, but it doesn't matter, it looks like Hugo is over- Oh, damn, damn. John, that bludger is going to hit Victoire! Got damn."
He's hardly had time to sleep for a decent few hours, no doubt, but his back hurts the next morning. Draco has not had the same luck as before and it seems that his anger manages to totally attract Harry like a magnet because he finds him everywhere. Round the corner of a hallway, in the staff room, on the Quidditch pitch, and even in the bathroom, where he just huffs and rolls on his feet.
"It seems like the only thing you can say." He leans on the floor without help and turns to face him with the best smile he can make, but it's not as big or as square as the bartender's and still it hurts. "Hello, Harry."
"No, I'm not playing games, that's all." Harry says in his commanding tone. And if he was one of her stupid admirers he might be scared, but he isn't and he doesn't give a shit about anything Harry Potter can say or do so he reaches out to snatch the bottle from his hands. Between the struggle Draco ends up throwing the contents of the bottle on both of them and Harry snorts. Draco laughs for a second until his pants feel too sticky. "We better go clean up."
"Oh, of course! I forget you're leading the chorus, how's Teddy going? Did he get Remus's voice or Sirius's?" he asks enthusiastically, pouring the portion of puree into his mouth at once. Right away his cheeks turn red and his eyes sparkle as he mutters something that sounds like
"Will you be a teacher?"
"Gilbert Clearwater hits that bludger and almost hits Darrell Jones, he seems upset." The public boos Gilbert. "Calm, Leonor Byrne takes the lead on the field. And by the moon, fly like lightning! Is this the next professional Quidditch player to come out of Hogwarts? Hey, Jude!" A general laugh floods the field. "Jude Singh appears alongside Milton Li to block Leonor's passage ... and what's going on! Kyle finally wakes up from his dream! Watch him fly through the sky. It seems that good John Davies will have to take care of this boy's back if he doesn't want to lose the golden snitch."
"Like the bond of soul mates?" Teddy asks from the front, Draco smiles at him nodding.
"You won't believe what I'll do on vacation." Draco appears in the staff room with raised eyebrows and folded arms. Nothing to indicate a good new. "Now I am forced to spend my yule at Hogwarts and I have to take care of decorating all this crap."
A chorus of long "Yes, teacher" is heard as the boys make movements and settle on the steps one behind the other.
Nearly Headless Nick was on the Gryffindor table singing an old Halloween song.
"James Potter?" Dorcas asks with a laugh. "Lily's jokes only made everything worse, I was his partner in herbology, that Lily joke, I can't believe there is someone so brilliant, tangling Sirius and me hair so that we would walk side by side all day!"
"I will be the referee."
"Oh yeah." Neville cleared his throat. "They asked my permission, it's something between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, Professor Flitwick knows about that."
So the next morning he's glad to find Harry sleeping next to him in the armchair and is surprised that he didn't worry about changing his clothes from the previous day, but decides to continue sleeping on Harry's chest until eleven in the morning of the day After Christmas. Because Harry's arms are comfortable and keep him away from the idea of the piles of snow out there.
"Seriously? Or can't you really live without sticking your nose into other people's affairs?" Harry snorts.
Draco asks to lead the choir and they accept him.
Harry ignores him and enters the office without permission. Drop a couple of sheets on the desk.
The rock doesn't rise, perhaps if he look at it very closely it will.
"Although Seamus wasn't very quiet." Neville laughs.
Draco is finishing up chorus rehearsals with some Ravenclaw students who decided to join in at the last minute when he sees Neville walking in the rain accompanied by Ernie Macmillan. Neville looks embarrassed and if Draco weren't so surprised he would have laughed three long, loud laughs.
He would be less pathetic, at least.
One, two, three seconds and nothing, Draco wants to escape, but the door opens showing a pathetic Neville Longbottom with a red nose and watery eyes. Draco can hear The Witches of the Valley with his best known heartbreak song, "Broken hearts of Fire." Which could only mean one thing, Neville had another one of his fits of self-pity for Ernie.
The potion explodes and the room smells a strange mixture between garlic, onion and expired meat. A coral cry leaves its classroom and the first thing to appear is Potter that has an expression of worry painted on the whole face, as if I had seen who-no-should-be-named half the corridor giving you sweet to the first anus.
Harry keeps talking and Draco stops listening at some point when he's too focused on Potter's arms and how much he wishes he hadn't made that mark on his arm. If his parents hadn't been so careless to mess with forbidden magic, if he hadn't been a coward. And it is at times like this where he wonders, if he had gone to Dumbledore in time, if he had fled or taken refuge with Harry Potter, would something have changed? Would his life feel as miserable as it does now?
"Precisely what I want is to sleep. That is my way of 'enjoying the night' "
"What is happening is that you are putting Potter ahead of me because he is your childhood friend and you have been treating me for three years, what is that against more than a decade with the great Harry Potter?"
"I would never do something like that." Harry walks over to Draco with his hand outstretched. I found this in the field.
Draco clicks his tongue.
"Uhm ... yes, I am, I suppose."
"How long have you been here?" Draco asks taking his scarf off his neck and taking a seat in the armchair in front of the fireplace.
Oh, no. Merlin, not that, he had almost completely forgotten.
"Kirley is amazing," he mutters.
"What about werewolves?" The tone of uncertainty in his voice.
He wants to tell him that yes, he's probably no one else in all of Hogwarts who can understand him better than him. He wants to tell him that he lived through it and that now he's here to support him, but he doesn't know if he should or if he can.
Potter smiles, nodding. "Good to Know." The two are quiet for a couple of seconds, and oddly, Draco doesn't feel as uncomfortable as he would have hoped. "Do I help you? That looks tired"
"You have two kids here, Lupin, join me if you want to chat with a real adult," he says, standing up in the direction of the small kitchen to make some tea. Edward follows him impassively like a puppy taking a seat at the bar with a smile and a blush still painted on his face.
Neville snorts in scandal. "What the hell are you talking about, Malfoy?"
"I'll go find Pomfrey." Neville stands up as he leaves the room as fast as he can to avoid facing a Draco in a tantrum.
"You're a bloody gossip, that's my problem."
However, Potter and Weasley don't make Neville get up from his chair to abandon him. Rather, they directly sit next to them. Neville sits across from him as usual and the other two men sit at either end, surrounding him.
They enter the place where several glances are on both of them and the hisses do not take long to appear because it must be surprising shit to see Harry Potter walking in a bar with such a handsome man, of course.
"I didn't know you were still dancing."
"Okay, he sighs. The game is about to start, I will go to my sit. I hope they don't disappoint their peers."
The sound of footsteps pausing outside the room freezes him. He must look awful with his tousled hair and clothes from the day before, and he shit, his breath must be the worst part. Why are there no mints anywhere? Draco shuffles in his place trying to fix his appearance as much as possible under the influence of a drunken night.
"Well ..." Draco holds out the vial with his gaze fixed on him, testing him, an incredible desire for a fight growing in his body. "Thank you for this."
"Mr. Malfoy!" Haven Kingsley rushes into the great hall with a smile that spreads from ear to ear. "Mr. Malfoy!"
Shame grows in his body, the blood runs up his neck until his face feels hot, and he just wants to cry and disappear, sink into his misery or drown in this lake. Anything is better than having Ernie Macmillan in front of him when he's wet and with a balloon of mucus up his nose.
And his plan to tell the principal about the contest was pretty easy. They would make a presentation at the last supper before the students went home to their families and Draco would take it upon himself to convince her over the holidays by inviting her to tea. It was well known that Draco had a talent for afternoon tea, he was a pureblood after all.
"Yes, that's right, if you're not yelling at me, you're thinking of yelling at me." Neville shrugged. Draco now threw a ball of paper at him that landed right in the middle of his face and then landed on his potatoes. "Oi! Watch out for my crisps."
"Yes, don't worry, Professor Malfoy, we'll take care of this."
He opens the door for Draco, and lets him in.
"Is Potter staying too?" Draco tries hard not to sound annoyed. He hadn't fought Harry in a week, and apparently, they were on good terms since the bar incident and his drunkenness. Longbottom nods calmly. "And what is all this for?"
Draco had told him when Neville broke the news.
"I'm a professor of potions, Potter, of course I can," he says winking at him, what Harry responds with a laugh. Draco whispers an Accio in a low voice and the potions materials of him appear in front of him. "Listen well," he says, applauding. "On his way as Potions Students will find... severe situations, so I'll show you how to make a potion to imitate the dragon mucus. Does anyone want to be my assistant? I'll give ten points to the house of the one who comes."
"Oh! Dora, does she too ...?" Harry nods and Marlene looks down sadly. Dorcas takes her hand.
"It's Valentine's Day, learn to be shared."
"It was among the papers I took, I'm sorry."
Harry smirked, getting up to shake hands with the two men. "Well, I'm glad you're together now. I always imagined it, though I must say I'm surprised you're not in the fireworks business, Seamus."
Harry and Ron laugh in unison. "We are not surprised either. His parents' school record was a mess."
Another important fact that Neville had learned in life was not to appear near the Macmillan Botics, because of his stupidity he did not make the connection with the last name and soon discovered that it belonged to Ernie's family, specifically his sister. They were apparently a legacy from Slytherin where the black sheep ended up in Hufflepuff.
"Professor, professor! Charlie put two tablespoons." Jamal exclaims standing while he adjusts his glasses. Draco opens his eyes as dishes. The cauldron begins to bubble, a green smoke springs without limit.
The man nods moving to let him pass, Draco enters the room. It's warm and full of photos, muggle photos that don't move, and books about all kinds of plants.
"Did... what?"
"My punishment was to stay here, did you forget?" The smile on the teenager's face makes the blood in his body boil, but Draco is good at feigning serenity, so he seeks all the patience he has and smiles.
The door opens barely an inch, Harry Potter pokes his head out, which is more of a bundle of black hair as disheveled as possible, and blushes when he realizes that Draco is awake fully aware of his actions. .
Draco rolls his eyes and denies. "Ronald has a lousy taste in clothing, of course he would have for boys."
The woman nodded with the same expression as always. Even though they were adults now, Draco was still a bit intimidated by the woman. With her graceful posture and imposing aura, everything about her screamed that one wrong move could cost you dearly.
Evan nods excitedly.
"Salazar, Kingsley." Draco ran a hand over his face wearily. They hadn't started the choir long, barely a couple of months, and that was a lot to say, rehearsals were limited to half an hour a week during exam seasons. "You definitely aren't ready for a public performance, much less an international competition where to top it off Beauxbatons students would be the near-perfect at anything. Did you at least check with Principal McGonagall?"
"He's an idiot, after everything I did to him when we were kids."
"That doesn't mean you can't be homophobic. Marlene says that even gay people can hate themselves." Ron explains as if he was an expert. With that know-it-all voice that he surely got stuck with from Granger.
Draco laughs wryly. "No, because that would have been the last straw."
Draco walks into his living room as annoyed as can be and feels thirty-six pairs of eyes fix on him as he slammed the door. Draco regains some of the dignity that has fallen to the ground and snorts under his breath.
for Merlin’s sakes.
“So sorry, Potter, I regret having to make you do your job,” Malfoy sneered, back to normal already.
Harry just nodded in reply, he didn’t know much about the intricacies of Hermione’s work, so he thought best not to go deeper into it, besides, if she wanted to talk about it more, she would have. “Right,” Harry replied simply, “and how are you?”
Malfoy looked at the fireplace for a moment, looking in thought, like he was trying to decide something for himself, and then turned to Harry again. “Try me, I’m in a good mood today,” he declared. Malfoy in a good mood? This was a rare occurrence Harry had never encountered. Why was the man in a good mood? Because he was leaving? Maybe Harry had caught him in the middle of packing.
Harry snapped his mouth shut, there was a detail he did
“I said I was sorry about it!” Harry defended. “Besides, I didn’t know what I was doing!
After a few more moments of silence, Malfoy uttered, “So, what now?”
“Ahem,” Isaac cleared his throat clearly to snap Harry out of whatever inner monologue had been on, “all is not lost, there was a ring on the splinched finger,” Isaac reached into his pocket and pulled out a white lump, a cloth handkerchief, which he now handed to Harry. Harry placed it in his hand and opened it with the other, and inside of the handkerchief there was a ring. It was a bulky golden ring with an emerald green centre, and in the green middle, there was engraved the letter M with a swirly typeface.
The first course was a dish called the arugula salad, which featured mushrooms and prosciutto as the main ingredients. Even when Harry felt his appetite completely gone, he found himself scooping up the first dish, probably not the way this food should be eaten. The pair only shared some positive remarks about the flavour, and otherwise concentrated on not thinking the obvious. Harry just wanted to spend the evening like any other night, not feeling like he was about to give something up very soon.
“You could tell me why you’re here, for starters,” Harry lifted his eyebrows and noticed that sensation was returning to his face, he wasn’t going to let go of this question as long as Malfoy was there. It was such an obvious question to ask too, he couldn’t believe Malfoy was just blatantly
Now he grabbed the permission slip again and didn’t so much as sit down before walking into the fireplace and emerging from the green flames in Kingsley’s office. Harry lifted up the piece of parchment in his hand at the Minister who clearly was already used to Harry storming his office on the regular. “Denied?” Harry demanded.
Now Kingsley pushed his reading glasses to his forehead and sighed very tiredly, leaning back in his chair like he always did. Harry realized that he must have been exhausted, and felt a small pang of guilt having come to pester him this early in the morning on a weekend. No matter, he had to have the decision reconsidered. “I did send you a letter to your address, I expect you didn’t receive it,” the Minister muttered and pinched his nose with two fingers, “the meeting was on Wednesday, it all happened very quickly, the vote was almost unanimous.”
“Oh, come on, you know what I mean! George mentioned he gave you some chocolates with love potion in them, how vulgar,” she chuckled and shook her head, causing her hair to bounce with the movement.
“Well, er, I now realize I haven’t said that out loud yet, haven’t I,” Harry started, feeling the red spreading from his face to his neck and his ears, “but yes, I love you, it might be stupid and unfortunate but I can’t help it, and I don’t want to fight it either, because I haven’t felt that way in a long time, I know it sounds horribly cliché coming out of my mouth, but–“
“Well tell them they don’t have to do any overtime over this, a least,” Harry fished the note he had found out of his pocket and handed it to Evergrey, who grabbed it and examined it closely. “D.R. and N.M., who are they I wonder… and what are these bizarre number combinations? Vaults in Gringotts perhaps?”
He had never heard such ridicule. Kingsley had been an Auror himself for fuck’s sake, he of all people should know that when you have nothing to go on there’s nowhere to go. Did he think Harry was requesting this for the sheer fun? It would take a full month to brew too! Harry launched out of the chair to stand in the middle of Kingsley’s office. “We have no leads!” he yelled, “Kingsley, please, I know you want this potion out of the streets as much as I do. Think about the elections that are coming up, if we can’t close this case before the ballots go up it’s not going to bode well for you.”
“No heavy exertion for a week after being released, no exercise, no alcohol, no sex,” the Healer read from her list.
,” there it was, the oh-so-familiar spitting out his name. Malfoy was visibly shaking from rage, his grey eyes gleaming with the usual longing to strangle Harry at the spot.
Meanwhile, Draco was going greener by the minute, unable to look at either his father, or Harry, or the judge, and just opting to stare at his hands, whereas Lucius was getting redder and redder where he was sitting.
“Thank you for showing up anyway,” he continued, and was hoping he’d be able to finish his speech before anyone else talked over him, “I will go straight to the point. Today I want to put forth a proposition for a judge to reinstate Lucius Malfoy’s previous sentence of time served in prison, rather than an execution.” Harry’s hands were starting to sweat, and he tried to muster every bit of confidence he had to deliver his points. He would have to reap the majority’s vote in order to go forward, and right now it didn’t seem all too likely. The people in front of him didn’t look too happy to even be in this meeting, let alone question their original decision.
Immediately, his flow was interrupted, when Edward Scot started speaking. “Don’t thank us,” he chortled, “thank Kingsley for bloody forcing us to be here!” Edward was a short, plump man in his sixties, with a red face and a balding head. He was a man of reason and a fair judge of character, but his opening line did not encourage Harry about his mission. A light chuckle went across the room, Harry tried to go along with it.
Now Harry all but jumped up from his chair. “Patrick!” he yelped, but didn’t know what to do next, hugging would be a bit awkward, but a handshake would be too official. Harry just ended up nodding at the man. “By all means, come in, take a seat. How are you?”
Eventually, though, the heat had died down, and they had been left alone, the three of them, still getting used to each other. Draco had had trouble thinking of himself as a father, and calling Harry ‘dad’ in front of their son, but he supposed none of them really knew what they were doing – this became clear after various conversations with Granger and Weasley, who had to admit that they were also just winging it. So that’s what they’d been doing, just winging it, quite successfully so far, in Draco’s opinion.
“I know my son,” Narcissa replied simply, but then sighed, “I regret to say that I have not loved him the way he deserves to be loved, the same goes for my husband, he should be so lucky as to find someone like you.” Harry's heart was hammering, she had been on Harry’s side this whole time? She wanted Harry to go see Draco? Was this seriously an idea that he was entertaining? It was barking mad! To show up at Draco’s door, just like that, although not unlike Draco had done to Harry…
Of course! Harry stood up so fast he almost fell over. His view going dark and stars flickering in the edges of his field of vision. Malfoy looked at him, startled by the sudden movement, and disgruntled that his human pillow slash hair-fondler had left. “You know what we’re going to do?” Harry announced, ignoring Draco’s dramatic protests.
Now it was Harry’s turn to cross his arms. “So why are you being such a prick then?” he inquired, raising his eyebrows at Malfoy. He had been waiting to ask that question for over fifteen years.
Harry knew that he wouldn’t get a straight answer out of Malfoy, but he had to try, so he narrowed his eyes like he was interrogating a criminal and asked “What does that mean?” he tried to use his most authoritative voice.
be good, Harry hoped he wouldn’t be too good though, not good enough for Kingsley to replace Harry with him. There were still things that Harry wanted to do as Head Auror, things he wanted to make better, he had only been at the position for a year!
“So…” Patrick leaned back in the chair, “what does this mean for the case? We’re still prosecuting Dubois and Ridgenorth, obviously, along with all of the other distributors and sellers the others managed to catch, but what about other suspects that are not directly tied to the case… like Narcissa Malfoy?”
Kingsley rolled his eyes, “Oh, piss off, before I change my mind,” he muttered and shook his head at Harry, before returning to the enormous stack of papers on his desk, quill in his hand. Whatever he was doing, it did not look like pleasant work, and Harry swore again that he’d never want Kingsley’s job. Too much paperwork, too much of it.
“I won’t miss the weather, that’s for damn sure,” the man scoffed, and seemed irritated that Harry hadn't caught on to his little insinuation.
It was a large room for one person, with two armchairs forming a sort of sitting area in the far corner of the space. There was a vase of fresh flowers on the table in front of the setting, and the drawn curtains filtered gentle light onto the bed. Harry’s wand was placed on another side table just a bit out of reach from the bed he was lying in.
Harry thought about reaching out to Malfoy. How would he react? Would he storm away, or would he push him against the wall fiercely? How Harry hoped for the latter. He wanted to kiss Malfoy. More than ever before. The dark wrapped the two of them in a silent curtain of intimacy, a moment where anything could happen, if one would only gather their courage. And Harry was gathering his courage to follow his new urge. At any moment now, he would take the step needed to reach the man, to gently kiss his tan neck, to feel his warmth, to feel his hot breath in his ear. Harry wanted to let himself go, for the first time in a very long time. He felt that Draco’s severity could bring something alive in him, something raw, something personal. It was just a matter of one move, one touch, to make it all happen.
Draco’s mouth quirked into a coy smile. “I suppose that would require a second date, then, wouldn’t you say?”
Apparating straight into Harry’s bedroom did not hinder the conversation now picking up, even if Harry’s stomach was feeling a bit queasy from the Side-Along. “I tried to talk you into taking that position for Merlin knows how many times, now a few words from Hermione and you’re suddenly jumping at the opportunity? I’m positively wounded,” Harry scolded Draco, scowling, not sure if he was being entirely serious or not.
The streetlights and a bright glow from the shop windows illuminated the crowded street, the sun had long gone. Harry peered above the slow-moving crowd to see the entrance to the Jade Toad, a tad fancier pub located on the corner of a very posh building. The building itself was built from sturdy pale bricks, and many engravings, stone ornaments and statues, embellished it. The windows had numerous panes and they were meticulously clean. The building harboured not only the posh pub, but also one of the more respected upscale fashion shops, Madam Mooney’s.
Another week at work went by, and the memory potion case was not moving forward. Even though Harry wasn’t even on the case, he hated waiting around with nothing he could do about it. Of course, he had other things to worry about, like the seemingly endless stream of permission slips waiting to be signed finding their way onto his desk. Patrick had promised Harry that he could tag along in the interrogation once they were able to get around to do it. For now, they were just standing by, waiting for the Department of Mysteries to be done with the serum to counter the effects of the memory potion. Harry’s head was swarming with creative ways to get Ridgenorth to talk, however, the whole week went by with no news.
Kingsley gave an evaluative look around the people sitting at the table, meeting their expectant gazes. He did not change his posture from where he was casually sitting back in the chair, hands clasped together on the table. Harry’s heart was now hammering, waiting for the man to speak. “Well Harry,” came the low rumble of Kingsley’s voice, “I guess I would have to vote aye.”
Jameson, a round-faced woman in her thirties with dark curly hair, had only been the Head of her department for a few years, but was smart as a whip and a very capable researcher before joining the Ministry in the first place. Her academically directed interests made her the one person Harry knew he had the chance to persuade. Penelope looked around the room, like she was trying to find answers in the faces that were now turned to look at her instead of Harry. “Er, I guess… not much,” she admitted.
A calmness that told him that something quite wonderful was about to start.
Five minutes later, Draco and Narcissa descended down the steps from the ninth floor to enter the courtroom. Harry was there waiting for them with McGallon, both of them giving a polite nod at Narcissa, who didn’t seem to be looking too chatty. Harry thought it best to leave her to take a seat and calm down before the start of the trial. As Narcissa already went inside the courtroom, Draco looked at Harry hesitantly. “Can you give us a moment, Katherin?” Harry asked McGallon, who eyed the pair of them like she was trying to assess a possible threat, but then just nodded and disappeared inside.
thick, Harry would never have the suaveness to charm Draco. “Anyway,” he continued, and Harry was once again aware that he was calling Malfoy Draco in his head, “I’m not that kind of a man, and more importantly, you’re not either.”
“I know,” Harry said with his mouth full, partly because he didn’t want to stop eating, and partly because there was nothing more to say, really.
Judging on Malfoy’s face, his plan was not working. The git was measuring Harry’s face, like he was trying to read his mind of what the fuck he was going to say before, but thankfully seemed to renounce such efforts. “No, in fact I haven’t.”
It made Harry’s heart tighten in his chest a little, he wanted kids too, he wanted what Ron and Hermione had. “I’m happy to be here, Rosie,” he said softly and patted her frizzy head.
“Er… I don’t know–“ what the fuck was he supposed to say? “Less pale, I guess, maybe he moved somewhere warm, I dunno…” Harry had to snap his mouth shut right this second. Something must have possessed him, he was sure. He received weird looks from both Ron and Hermione, and decided to quickly change the subject, that’s what casual people do, right?
Once again they suffered through a long silence, filled with chirping birds and a car gassing away somewhere in the distance. At this point, Harry had nothing to say. He had now realized that the likelihood of him ever getting anywhere with Malfoy were extremely slim, the git had made that very clear, he just didn’t know why. It was like snapping out of a hypnotic state Harry had been in for the last few weeks; the truth was that Malfoy wasn’t interested in him and that was the bitter end of it. Harry didn't know what he had been thinking, and he immediately felt stupid – he and Malfoy had always been adversaries, and whatever made the man act like he had the past few weeks, Harry had clearly interpreted it wrong, and now wished he’d just shut up about the whole thing earlier. He hoped that the Ministry would finish their search of the Malfoys’ house sooner rather than later, and was relieved when Malfoy checked the time.
When Harry walked out of the fireplace in his living room, he saw Draco shoot up from the sofa, body rigid as he took a hesitant step towards him. Harry thought that the man would have stayed with Narcissa, assuming she was a wreck, and was a tad surprised to find Malfoy now standing in the middle of his house. He took another sceptical step towards Harry, a more of a motion than an actual intention, his eyes scanning Harry apprehensively, like he was trying to decide where they stood now. Harry thought that this was not the time to start recalibrating their dynamic together, so he walked over to Draco and wrapped him in a huge hug. Apparently, that’s what the man had been waiting for, because he melted in Harry’s embrace, long arms enclosing around him, his head falling into Harry’s neck.
, but Harry couldn’t be sure.
Malfoy looked almost amused, which irritated Harry to no end, but he fought to keep his tongue. He needed answers more than he needed to pick a fight, however refreshing it might feel. “So impatient, Merlin,” Malfoy murmured under his breath before glancing at the clipboard again, “you were brought here last Wednesday by the Weasel–, I mean, Mr Weasley. Apparently, you two had been on a work call when someone hit you with a Stupefy and flew you through a wall and two flights of stairs. If I may offer my
She gave an evaluative look up and down Malfoy’s slim figure, wrapped in black, which seemed to both confuse and amuse Draco. “Pleased to meet you mister Malfoy,” she uttered finally, and Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline, “I’m Rose Granger-Weasley, how do you do,” Rosie extended her right hand quite vigorously, and after some hesitant seconds, Malfoy grabbed to shake it. His hand was enormous compared with her tiny palm, but they seemed to manage.
“Dunno, but if we go grab her I’m sure we can squeeze an explanation out of her. There’s just one thing…” Evergrey was now nervously fiddling with the other piece of parchment he was holding, “and you’re not going to like it.”
“Well,” Malfoy raised his eyebrows and rolled on his back again, “let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Potter,” he said, faking nonchalance.
Edward Scot stood up at the front row. “Yes, sir, I mean, judge, I mean, Your Honour. Edward Herwood Scot, sir, Your Honour,” he announced in a faltering voice, wiping his sweaty palms in his robes.
“In the north? Why?” he asked. Hogwarts was so much closer, though he hated to realize that the thought of Malfoy in the Durmstrang uniform was indeed an immediate thought that he had. Harry tried to stop a blush from creeping onto his face again while he was measuring Malfoy with his gaze.

He grabbed his bag, and Harry could hear something fall over in there, though it didn’t seem to be very heavy. They made their way downstairs into the shop, and Malfoy locked the door to his apartment with a muggle padlock and a protective charm. He then left a short note for Moretti, stating that something had come up, and that they’d have to leave for London, not knowing when they’d be back.
