“No.” he said stubbornly. When he met Pansy’s unimpressed stare he ran his hand through his wet hair and tried again after a heavy pause. “Yes. Maybe? I don’t know. How can you love someone who hates you and everything your family stands for?”
“Here, I found this buried deep within the Black Archives. After I read through your family's books it made me curious.” Harry pulled out an ancient, black leather-bound book from his pocket and unshrunk it. “If you’ll reference the Genealogy Records from two centuries ago, you will find that the Peverell name died out because Quintus Peverelle never produced a male heir.” Harry opened it to the page he had marked before handing it over to Draco. “His daughter Temperance, however, married Cyrus Potter and thus continued the Peverelle bloodline, but not the name. The only reason this was even recorded in the Black Archives is that, during that same century, Dorea Black married Charlus Potter- therefore making the Potter bloodline important to them during that time.”
“Yeah, it’s brilliant actually. I hope you didn’t wait up for me too long.” Harry said as if it were normal to be questioned by your house elf.
When they reached the stairwell Harry turned and shot off several stunners in a row, managing to take two more down before they rushed up the stairs.
“I’m sorry I didn’t have the chance to get to know her.” Draco frowned, lowering his gaze to the tiled floor.
Draco carefully turned the page of the muggle novel Hermione had insisted on buying for him. He found muggle literature quite strange. What it lacked in wizarding traditions and any accuracy with magic, it more than made up for in imagination. The hour was growing late, but he was only a few chapters from finishing a riveting tale about a man who turned into another, more evil, version of himself without the use of a curse or polyjuice potion. He might as well stay up and finish the book. He had to know how it ended.
“It’s good to see some things never change.” Draco grinned. “Granger still an insufferable know it all.”
He couldn’t help but feel that he was being spoiled. Not that he minded, of course. Five date nights in a row was a tad opulent even by his standards. Frankly, he was surprised Harry hadn’t run out of ideas yet.
Deathly cold torrents flooded the chasm of his soul as a vision of Sirius falling, his last laugh still etched onto his handsome features played over and over again in his mind.
“Yeah.” He nodded as the hollow feeling invaded once more. With a loud crack, the two reasons he ever felt ok were gone.
"I can't believe you would keep something like this from me for eight years." His father closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose.
The unmistakable buzz of patrons filling the theater could be heard all the way backstage and Draco felt uncharacteristically nervous. He had been so preoccupied with avoiding Harry the past two days that he had forgotten to panic over his father attending opening night. The butterflies in his stomach worked double-time to compensate and Draco rather felt like he might be sick.
It worked. He quickly vanished the molded bits of soggy root and continued on his way. At long last, the tunnel started sloping upwards and he could see faint light filtering down from an oddly shaped exit hole. He scrambled up it, desperate to feel the wind on his face.
“It’s disgusting!” a middle-aged woman was shouting. “It’s unnatural! They should be ashamed of themselves.”
“I think it highlights the silver in your eyes and complements the rich color of your shirt.” Hermione came up behind him and caught his gaze in the mirror.
Dumbledore had raised him as a lamb for the slaughter, just like the evil git had said. Harry never even had a chance to choose for himself.
He was filled with a mixture of relief at having succeeded and dread at what he had to do next. He swallowed back the bile that had risen in his throat and touched his dark mark, letting the Dark Lord know he had finally accomplished the first half of his task.
“I’m starting to understand why this Tournament was discontinued two hundred years ago. I can't believe they brought it back...” Theo frowned.
No sooner had the thought crossed his mind than Ginny entered the kitchen looking like a vision in her pale gold bridesmaid dress. George and Fred were right on her heels, along with Gabrielle Delacour and Draco Malfoy.
They worked well together. Zack Gryffin had been his partner since they both joined the force and Harry had grown rather fond of them. They were level headed where Harry was reckless, and passionate when Harry was apathetic. They balanced each other out. Zack was also a genius at paperwork. Harry completed one document for every three of theirs. By the time Zack decided it was time for lunch they were almost halfway through the stack.
He set the bottle down on a convenient end table before being pulled into a formal dining room. Everything turned into a blur of voices and hands grabbing at him and he lost track of time. Whenever he thought he was almost free more people seemed to pour in to regale him with their war stories and to shake his hand. The whiskey thundering through his veins enabled him to smile and give bland responses instead of screaming. Just when he thought his head might explode from all of the pressure to play the friendly hero there was a brief lull.
He wanted to run to him. He wanted to be the one George was comforting. He wanted to be told to stay, that he was loved and needed and desired. That he didn’t have to die. He wanted so badly to reveal himself and give George one last kiss, but he would only stop him from doing what needed to be done. He pressed on, leaving George behind. This was a trip he had to make alone.
It is the second task and tensions are running high. Theo discovers a secret and Pansy reveals that she knows a lot more than she lets on.
“Of course I do.” Harry frowned, wondering where George was taking this. “I want you to be happy, too.”
Harry took that as a cue and took a sip of his too. It was bitter, but tart. He couldn’t decide if he liked it or not.
If Harry was gay that meant Draco had a chance. It was dangerous to let himself hope. It would be impossible for them to ever get together, even if he was. They had spent the past four years in a bitter rivalry. The notion of Harry being gay and falling for Draco was almost laughable.
“Oi, Parkinson! No talking until I can think without getting a bloody migraine!” Theo called, wincing at the loudness of his own voice.
“Of course that’s what it means.” Luna said brightly. “Isn’t it Harry? We’re going to fight for Hogwarts.”
On the drive home, they listened to music and Harry shared what it was like growing up in a home where he was seen as nothing more than an inconvenience and a burden. The more Harry shared the more Draco’s heart felt like it was breaking in his chest. No one deserved to be treated that way, least of all someone as kind as Harry. He placed a reassuring hand on Harry’s knee and did his best to convince him that he was incredible despite what his relatives made him believe. Each self-deprecating remark cut Draco like a knife. How could someone so caring care so little about themself? By the time they reached Harry’s complex, Draco thought he had at least managed to convince him that Draco thought he was extraordinary if nothing else. They exchanged a few parting pleasantries and Draco was relieved when he was able to make Harry smile with a lame pun. When Draco leaned in for their customary goodnight kiss Harry surprised him again by responding with an overwhelming amount of passion. Harry’s hand tangled in his hair as their lips moved desperately against each other. Harry’s kisses were unexpectedly hungry and Draco became lost in the heat of the moment. When Harry pulled back it took Draco an embarrassingly long time to recover and return to coherency. He was vaguely aware of being told to have a good night, then Harry was already halfway up the stairs leading to his apartment before Draco even realized he had left the car. He watched him disappear behind door 394 with a dazed expression and sat there for a long moment contemplating what had just happened and everything he had learned about his past.
“Cheers, Hopsin! Nice place you have here.” Ron managed to say with enthusiasm as he already started edging towards the kitchen.
Draco was rather pleased with how comfortable his new home had become. He had worked hard to make the place his own, and gazing around his kitchen he felt that he had succeeded. It felt warm and welcoming, almost calming. Draco was the farthest thing from calm. Hermione gave him a sympathetic smile and patted his hand reassuringly. Draco did not feel reassured in the least.
“I try to be.” Harry sighed, taking a sip of the wine. It was a little dry for his taste but still good.
Silence reigned for an uncomfortable moment before the head of the MLE nodded curtly and cleared her throat.
The arms of the button up were a little tight, but they made his biceps look bigger so he didn’t really mind. He saved himself the trouble of having to satisfy her curiosity with words and just went out to meet her.
“And then you come right back! GINNY! YOU HAVE TO COME BACK!” Harry’s voice filled the corridor again.
"Something like that, yeah." Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair, relishing in the feel of it.
Thoughts of Draco flooded his mind uninvited and Harry found himself wondering what he would want if it had been Draco storming out on them.
“Hold on Dobby, are you saying this….gilly weed will help me breathe underwater for an hour?” Harry dared not to believe it.
Strong arms suddenly wrapped around his shoulders, yanking him away from the veil. Harry barely registered the grim face of Remus Lupin before he stopped fighting and let the adults take over.
“Merlin, Potter. You don’t know who the sacred twenty-eight are? Sometimes I forget you were raised by muggles, then something like this happens.” He pinched the bridge of his nose.
Draco motioned for the others to go first, grabbing the gate and locking it behind them before trailing after the others. Harry and his mother were bantering back and forth so Draco fell into step beside Bill.
"Merlin’s beard, it's wonderful to finally meet you." Andromeda laughed breathlessly before letting him go. "You look extraordinarily like your mother. Except for your eyes." She placed her hand on Draco’s cheek and gently ran her thumb across his cheekbone. "You have your father's eyes."
Hello Lovely Readers! This chapter is a feels train and I hope you're prepared. There are two major warnings for this chapter, so strap in.
Draco just shook his head. A persistent feeling of dread had been hanging over him ever since he had figured it out. Karkaroff stalking Snape everywhere he went, both former death eaters holding their left forearms as if they pained them… his father’s barely concealed fear at the World Cup. None of it boded well. Delacour and Krum had both been disqualified and now it was just Diggory and Harry in there. It felt like a trap. Nothing had happened in far too long. The maze seemed to still before a bright flash of blue light flared in the center of the maze.
Moments later Draco was snoring softly on his chest and Harry looked down at the pale blond. All of the pain and worry had disappeared from his face. He looked so peaceful and Harry thought he hadn’t seen anything more beautiful in his life.
“Whatever you’d do on a normal date, but with another couple.” Dean giggled when Seamus nuzzled his neck.
Ok, A few things about this chapter. One: Kreacher. I love love love happy Kreacher! I hope you do too. It bothers me when fics exclude Kreacher like he doesn't love Harry. So I'm fixing that in my fic. Secondly, Zack Gryffin. They are gender fluid and go by the pronouns of they them and their. There is no "big reveal" or oddly placed explanation because there doesn't need to be. Being genderfluid is NORMAL. So I'm treating it like it is. Lastly; Supportive!Weasleys! I love it!! And I hope you love it too.
Harry pulled away with a sigh, settling next to Draco on the couch. He rubbed his face with his hands as he tried to find the words.
Draco leaned against the closest wall, gasping for breath. It was one thing to know the Dark Lord wanted Harry dead. It was another to hear him demand Harry be handed over to him on a silver platter like it was nothing.
“Thought you’d swan off and wouldn’t have to answer for your actions, eh boy?” The man glared at Harry.
“There they are!” Pansy giggled as the group parted to give her a clear line of sight. “You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!”
Vernon’s face contorted with rage and he hurled a racial slur at Blaise that made even his scrawny wife gasp in shock.
Harry takes Draco on a small tour of muggle London and Draco gets sentimental. There is Much Ado About Nothing and an anti-gay bigot makes a big scene. Narcissa is overwhelmed with contentment and her strange closeness with Harry gets somewhat explained.
“I’m sorry to hear that.” Irys’s voice drew her attention back to the Wizengamot. “Let’s talk about what happened in the forest. How were you able to lie and say that Mr. Potter was dead?”
“Shame he didn’t pay attention when they taught them how to stop it.” Ron snorted.”If he hadn’t tried to kill us, I might be sorry he was dead.”
The rest of the world slipped away and all Draco felt was white-hot hatred. His vision tunneled and all he could see was Vernon Dursley, his only driving thought was to make him pay. He wanted to make him hurt the way he hurt Harry. He needed to break him, humiliate him- even the score. An invisible force was holding him back. He thrashed and fought against it when he saw the abhorrent man strike out once more before casting Draco a look that was filled with both fear and revulsion. Draco watched helplessly as he grabbed his wife and beat a hasty retreat, disappearing inside a luxury sedan. After the sedan peeled out of the parking lot, Draco became aware of two pairs of arms holding him back. When he relaxed Blaise let him go, but Luna held fast, pulling him into her for a rather one-sided hug.
Draco looked over at Pansy and Hermione, hoping they could shed some light on the subject but they both just shook their heads.
“Yeah, right. One hundred and eleventh time is lucky, you think?” Harry was laughing, but the mirth never quite reached his eyes.
“There it is.” Pansy said grimly. All of her previous venom had leached away, leaving a sympathetic grimace in its place.
"How incredibly kind of you.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Now what is this muggle class you insisted we do for our fun day?”
The number of muggles on the ice slowly started to dwindle as it grew nearer to eight o'clock. Draco came to a stop by the wall gap that led back to the rental counter, bracing for impact when he saw Harry barreling towards him. Instead of slamming him into the wall, Harry used his momentum to wrap his arms around Draco in a forceful hug that almost drug them both down onto the ice but Draco steadied them before they could fall.
“In our fifth year, Delores Umbridge had me and my friends detained. Draco tried to reason with her when she threatened to use the cruciatus curse on me to extract information. His delay enabled Hermione to come up with an escape plan. Afterward, it was confirmed that he let Ginny Weasley overpower him so she could release the rest of my friends.” Harry recited in a professional tone.
The rest of the night was a little fuzzy, but he remembered dancing endlessly- with Draco, of course, but with Hermione and Pansy as well. Gods, that was embarrassing. He only hoped he hadn’t trodden on the girl's toes too badly. Neither one of them was quite as good of a dancer as Draco. Harry found he didn't seem to mind dancing as long as Draco was his partner.
As always, a huge shout out to My Darling, my best friend, and my super amazing beta reader AlexClio and my lovely, ethereal omen, fantastic beta reader SandZhark.
Hey all! I am so sorry that this update is MASSIVELY late. My sister tried to commit suicide and I've been dealing with the shockwave of that. She is living with me now, she's safe and I am here to support her. Hopefully, chapters will start going back to their usual bi-weekly updates now that she is safe and being taken care of!
A strange chill clung to the air as darkness descended on the Quidditch pitch. The band was still playing merrily, even though the last Champion had long since been swallowed into the depths of the maze. Excited chatter rippled through the crowd as the hedges swayed in the wind.
“It would have been too much to ask to spend an entire day without bigotry of some form rearing its ugly head.” He said instead.
"That kid never runs out of energy, does he?" Draco watched as he jumped in front of the Polar Bear's glass in a fierce pose.
Harry caught Ron's eye and they held a silent conversation while the others razzed each other. An immense sense of relief washed over Harry when Ron gave a small nod that meant Draco had his stamp of approval.
Draco just gazed at him helplessly for a moment before flinging himself into his lap and kissing him. Harry responded enthusiastically, smiling into the kiss.
“You called me back for this? To tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure.” The Dark Lord smirked.
They did have fun, he supposed. There were numerous bonding opportunities as they traveled across the continent together. There were quiet moments shared on a pier, a few night time excursions to famous pubs, and a convenient carnival that they were able to visit. Draco had never been to one before. It was a fantastic experience. They even shared stories from their pasts; tragic backstories Hermione called them. By the time he settled on a modest bi-level beach house on the coast of Rye, he felt he could honestly call Hermione Granger a good friend, if not one of his best friends.
“My condolences. Here, this shot is on me.” She set down one of the two shot glasses she was holding on the table.
“Oh, right. I guess that is kind of more of a muggle thing.” Harry flushed. “We don’t have to do that if you’d rather do something else.”
“That’s just Harry.” Granger looked shocked, but she took it in stride. “How much of that did you hear?”
“Of course I made it up, my mother was pushing me to give Skeeter a juicy spin so she could sell more copies. I delivered. She already was on about Granger dating Potter and Krum. I just… helped her along.” Pansy sniffed.
“Why didn’t you just check the genealogy records? You can trace back my bloodlines for centuries.” Draco stared into the setting sun.
Harry lapsed into a stony silence, refusing to rise to Snape’s obvious bait. As if he didn’t feel inadequate enough already. Regardless of what Dumbledore said, Snape was foul. He had loathed Snape from their first encounter. This past June, however, Snape had placed himself irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry’s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius.
Draco squared his shoulders and held his head high as he approached the entrance. He crouched down, spine still erect. If he was marching to his death, he would not let the last time his parents saw him be marred by cowering in fear. He crawled into the tunnel with as much dignity as he could. He was grateful when it turned into a steep slope, obscuring him from the other’s view. He heard his godfather move the crate back in front of the entrance and he gulped.
“I don’t know what they were thinking, bringing dragons to Hogwarts.” She tsked, vanishing the bloodied cloth and summoning a potion bottle to her. “A student could have died!”
He couldn’t. He didn’t want to be here. He didn’t want to be hugged or comforted. He just wanted to stop existing. Hermione and Pansy needed to feel like they were helping him so he allowed them to whisper empty reassurances for their sake. They didn’t need to suffer alongside him. He let himself weep until he couldn’t anymore.
“Thank you for listening, you have no idea how much it means to me.” He pulled her in for a quick hug.
“Death Eater scum!” A father of two snarled, shielding his sons as if the very sight of Draco was indecent.
"Yeah, fine. Just not hungry, I s'pose." Harry shrugged, breaking eye contact to grab at a pitcher of pumpkin juice.
“That you sound like quite the catch and that she’s glad you make me happy.” Draco shot him a quick wink and Harry flushed with pleasure.
Now that he thought about it, having no emotions sounded fantastic. If he could switch off all of the guilt and pain and anger….
“It’s kind of fun.” Harry waggled his eyebrows suggestively, earning a snort of amusement from Draco.
“Opal? I didn’t even want to bring her, but she manipulated me into it.” Neville’s expression turned dark for a moment and Ron felt a fierce protective streak flare to life. “She only wanted to use me to get to Harry.”
"It is? I'm not… broken?" He stumbled over the last word, embarrassed at finally having spoken that thought out loud.
“So the article wasn’t a hoax, then? It wasn’t the prophet just spouting off nonsense, you actually said all of that?” Dean looked scandalized.
“Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot, we are gathered today to pass judgment on the Malfoy Family. The charges are as follows:
“We’ll catch you later.” Dean narrowed his dark ocher eyes at his boyfriend. “I’ve got to get this one home before he passes out on me and I have to carry his arse.”
“I’ll explain everything once we’re in my dorm.” Pansy said evasively as they came up on the blank stretch of wall and led to her common room. “Tutandi Diligaris.”
“Good, maybe you can help me reign in my chaos then.” Harry snorted, joining Draco in the middle of the living room. “Ready to leave?”
Harry faded into the realm of unconsciousness and he found himself suddenly sitting at a long table in a dimly lit dining room. Firelight flickered from torches set in golden brackets on the walls, casting an eerie glow. He glanced around and was mildly alarmed to see Death Eaters all around him until a pale face caught his eye.
Harry ran without looking back, shooting off more stunners as he and his friends made their way back towards Dobby. His Aunt threw her knife just as all four of them disappeared with a deafening crack.
“You never told me you were good at billiards.” Draco turned his emerald green eyes to Harry who flushed under the attention.
He cast cleaning charms on the rest of the set and fixed a proper tea for the first time in weeks. He had never been so giddy to fill a sugar pitcher before. He didn’t even care that he was being ridiculous, it was the principal of the matter that he had his own sugar pitcher to fill so he did. When he felt awake enough to face the manor Draco pulled on a nice shirt and some slacks and was about to head out when he caught his reflection in the mirror.
Malfoy seemed to take that as encouragement because he bit harder, sucking the sensitive skin until Harry thought he could come just from that. Malfoy, apparently, had other ideas. While he was running his tongue over the teeth marks he had left in Harry's shoulder his hands were fumbling with the zip on his muggle jeans. Before he could think to offer his assistance Malfoy had it open and was pulling his prick out through the fly in his pants. Harry opened his mouth but his protests died in his throat as Malfoy fondled him.
“No, I’ve always been able to. Why, is that what happened to you?” Draco asked eagerly, then blushed. “I’m sorry, that was rude. It’s none of my business.”
“Er, not exactly.” Harry gave him a shy smile. “I wanted to do something nice for your birthday as a kind of ‘thank you' for helping me with all of the wizarding culture tutoring. I figured showing you some muggle culture would be a fair trade, but I didn’t think we would be spending the entire day together so Canterbury Cathedral is where the official planning ended.”
Move your wand in a figure-eight motion across the infected area while repeating the incantation until the wound is fully healed.
“Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the Weasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear That?”
Draco just stared at him, silver eyes alight with judgment, stubbornness and something else Harry couldn’t quite place. The silence stretched on but Harry refused to break it. He had asked a question and he wouldn’t say a word until it was answered. The dull tolling of the emergency alert was the only sound in the room.
Eventually, they made it downstairs where Kreacher had breakfast cooking and a pot of coffee ready for them.
“Actually, I do. So does Pansy, and even Ron. The only person who seems to think Draco still hates you is you. Get over it.” She didn’t bother to look up, sliding shirts down the rack as she discarded them.
Draco looked Harry directly in the eyes. He could tell Harry knew he recognized him, but there was still a pleading hope in those emerald green eyes.
“That’s alright, I don’t mind.” Bill seemed to relax. “I’m actually relieved to be done with all the pureblood formalities.”
“How could you possibly-” The Weasel started to ask but Harry nodded towards Pansy’s midsection. Draco blinked in confusion.
“Well, as long as they’re torturing us together, I think we will survive.” She gave him one of her infamous Slytherin smirks and Harry felt an answering grin spread across his face.
“Oh, is that how it’s done? And here I’ve been wearing every drink I’ve ever had. Boy, that’s embarrassing.” Draco quipped, trying not to grimace. That had definitely sounded better in his head.
He knocked four times in quick succession before stepping back. He stabilized the teetering pile of sketchbooks that were threatening to topple out of the box just as the door swung open to reveal a very confused Draco Malfoy.
Draco heaved a sigh then looked around helplessly for something he could bring back with him so he didn’t look like an idiot. He grabbed the closest bowl of crisps and followed Hermione. When he got back everyone was laughing at something his father had said and the bottle of mead had been opened. He quickly set the crisps down and accepted the red cup that Harry was handing him.
Hermione emerged victorious from her bag a moment later with a white tube, something that looked suspiciously like tan lipgloss, and a round compact with a bronze-colored powder. He stared forlornly at his ceiling as she dabbed at his eyes with an oddly shaped sponge.
"Let me finish getting ready." Draco pushed back from the table, casting his charcoal drawing one last critical glance before giving Harry his favorite half-smile. "I'll be back in a minute."
His hand jumped across the page as he abandoned Granger and started drawing his favorite subject. Harry was easy. Draco could probably draw him in his sleep. He smiled faintly at the thought as he sketched Harry’s heart-stopping smile. He was never more alluring than when he was laughing with his friends.
He summoned his favorite blanket and laid it out in roughly the same spot they had shared a bottle of fire whiskey before unpacking the picnic. The girls had supplied them with carefully wrapped plates of cheese, crackers, and summer sausage, clusters of white table grapes, cucumber and Caprese sandwiches, a bowl of wild berries, and a bottle of wine. In the very bottom of the basket were two plastic wine flutes
Turns out saving someone’s life didn’t make you feel less defiled when you find out there is a piece of Voldemort inside you. None of the Weasleys were able to look him in the eye for the rest of the afternoon and it was driving Harry spare. Did they think he was going to transform into the snake and attack them? He had taken to hiding with Sirius in Buckbeak’s room during the day. It was easier, not being around his friends. He didn’t have to try for Sirius. It was almost freeing.
“I’m fine.” He was wet, he couldn’t see, and he was cold. Bloody perfect. He glanced over at Draco and could just barely make out his elegant features from this close up. His expression shifted from one of concern to one of delight as he started laughing.
"No, I think that pretty much covers it." Draco basked in the relief of getting everything off his chest for a few moments before bracing for the worst.
“That was rude.” Draco was back to glaring at him as soon as she left, but with that eyeliner Harry found he didn't’ really mind.
Harry tried to think of a quick coping mechanism as they drew nearer to the front steps. He frantically cast his mind back, thinking of all of his chats with Sirius.
After a brief spat over who would use the bathroom first, they decided to get ready together. Harry brushed his teeth while Draco raided his potions cabinet, despairing over his lack of facial and hair care potions. Harry teased him about being high maintenance and Draco lectured him about the dangers of simplicity.
The war has ended. The light had won. The Death eaters have all been rounded up and given a FAIR TRIAL this time around. Why did it take almost a year to try the Malfoys? Harry makes a courageous (and very stupid) decision and it changes the course of the trial.
“Bellatrix Lestrange was no sister of mine. She might have been related by blood, but she was not my family.” Her face hardened at the thought.
“Can’t we do this later?” Draco winced. He didn’t have the emotional capacity to deal with any of this bullshit.
Nagini’s head fell to the grass with a final thud and several things happened at once. The Dark Lord let out a howl of rage and turned his wand on him, pointing it directly at his heart. With the killing curse dancing upon the Dark Lord’s lips, the ground started shaking. A tremendous roar could be heard in the distance and it looked like the mountains themselves were advancing on the castle.
“I appreciate your sympathy, Mr. Potter, but there is no use in pursuing the issue. It isn’t the bigotry of just one official. It’s the attitude of the vast majority of Wizarding Britain as a whole. Confronting one person isn’t going to help very much in the grand scheme of things, it’s just an unnecessary headache.” His father sounded resigned.
Draco’s heart fluttered when he heard a familiar knock on his door, practically leaping off the sofa to answer it. When he pulled it open to reveal a casually dressed and sheepish-looking Harry, Draco felt his lips curl into an involuntary grin. It didn't matter that it had only been since this morning that they last saw each other.
"Good?" Harry asked as he stood, his knees cracking their protest against kneeling on the hard kitchen floor for so long.
“Zank you for coming over, ‘Arry. I look forward to seeing much more of you.” Fleur beamed, grabbing his hand and giving it a firm squeeze before he moved out of reach.
“Thanks.” He rolled his eyes, but cracked the bottle open and gulped some down anyway. Flashbacks to making buttons and cold showers surfaced and he grimaced. “Oh, this is that stuff Blaise had back in fourth year.”
“Any suggestions on how to improve?” Draco kept his eyes fixed on her, not meeting the curious gazes he could feel burning the back of his skull from his friends.
Theo couldn’t possibly hold him accountable for what he said in his sleep. He would gladly be rid of his inane feelings for the Gryffindor. It wasn't his fault!
“It’s her way of warning me.” Draco snorted as they both settled back onto the couch with their mugs.
As soon as Harry got back to his dorm he threw himself at his trunk and started searching frantically for that damn mirror. He needed to talk to Sirius now. He finally found it and pushed himself onto the bed.
“He wasn’t, actually. He was a magic purist. He believed in keeping the magic in his house strong. Purebloods just usually have the strongest magic because it runs through their veins like blood.”
“Will you stay?” Draco’s voice was shaky, but when he pulled back to look up at Harry his silver eyes were set with determination.
As he watched her walk away a flash of bright hair caught his eye and his smile slipped from his lips. Draco was coming out of the bathroom alone, still buttoning his shirt back up. Before Theo could even register that, Draco was already ordering another drink and scoping out his next victim. He leaned casually against the bar, chatting up some ginger bloke with wide shoulders.
“I didn’t want you to die.” Harry felt a lump in his throat forming and he didn’t bother to even try to choke it back. "I didn’t want any of you to die. Fred, I’m so sorry,” He sobbed, sinking to his knees in the face of his dead loved ones. “And Remus, you just had a son-”
“What’s there to talk about?” he glared sullenly at the shower drain, watching the water circle it once before disappearing forever.
He closed his eyes and turned it over three times. With a soft pop, five white figures joined him on the edge of the forest. Harry couldn’t breathe for a moment. They were neither ghost nor living flesh. They more or less resembled the Tom Riddle that had been trapped in the diary, more substantial than a ghost and yet not truly there.
“If you truly care for the Malfoy’s well being, as you seem to, I suggest holding a press conference and sharing with the public the reason behind their release. Unfortunately, Mr. Farley is correct and there will be mass outrage for letting two marked Death Eaters go free.” She frowned at him as the rest of the room broke out into hushed whispers.
"Oi, sod off Potter." Draco exclaimed, but he didn't make any effort to withdraw from their cuddling.
"He yelled at me a bit, so I got defensive and yelled back. Then he told me he doesn't need me to protect him, called me a hypocrite, and stormed off." He said miserably.
Godric, what was happening? The way Draco’s eyes glinted with amusement and his lips curved made his heart stutter.
They were both breathing heavily but Draco was ginning as Harry put his ear to the door to listen for the security guard. Heavy footsteps thudded past and Harry could have sworn he heard him mutter something about meddling kids before his footsteps faded farther down the hall. He waited a few extra minutes, just to be sure. Harry didn’t know if they could be fined for sneaking into Westminster, but he wasn’t keen on finding out.
“My life isn’t perfect.” He spat dangerously. Hermione took a step back and he felt slightly vindicated.
“The genealogy records. In the library. All of the sacred twenty-eight bloodlines are meticulously recorded dating back almost nine centuries. Purebloods love proving how pure they are.” He scoffed.
Apparently, Harry was thinking along those same lines because at that exact moment he pulled back and pressed their foreheads together.
“That’s good to know.” Harry shivered as she pulled him into the blessedly warm house. The constant throbbing of bass made conversation difficult after that for which Harry was weirdly grateful. He liked Luna, and she was a good friend, but she was overly perceptive. He didn’t want to have an uncomfortable conversation about Draco Malfoy right now.
“I’m a marked Death Eater. None of us deserve to be pardoned. If you pardon anyone, it should be my mother.”
Draco glanced up at the staff table to check. Pansy was right, as usual. When they made eye contact Snape nodded in the direction of the dungeons, immediately got up and swept from the great hall. Draco sighed and buried his face in his hands.
Hello lovely readers! I'm sorry it's been so long since an update, but it was My Darling's birthday and I am writing her a short Ballerina!Draco fic. I worked tirelessly to get the first 4 chapters cranked out in time for her birthday, which sadly meant Home went neglected for a little over a month. But! Now Dirty Little Secrets is roughly halfway done and updates for Home will start picking back up! I can't believe it's been 8 months since I started this fic. If you've stuck with me this far words cannot express how grateful I am for you. Thank you.
“Absolutely. Now every time I see it all I’ll be able to think of is snogging you behind the clock face.” Draco loved the way Harry’s face crinkled with happiness at his words.
“Really?” Bill frowned. “I would have expected it to feel fouler. I heard the mark had to be burned into the skin.”
He desperately needed fresh air. He felt like he couldn’t breathe. As soon as he was free of the mass of people he made a beeline for the back door, not stopping until he was halfway down the path that led to the field they used for two-on-two Quidditch.
Even Theo had to admit the normally deliciously disheveled Gryffindor looked wretched. What had it cost Draco to make him look like that? He reached out and squeezed his thigh reassuringly and Draco flashed him a grateful smile, joining in the conversation again with just a little too much enthusiasm.
He was endlessly curious, and of course Hermione and Pansy would explain things if he asked, but he felt awkward about it. Perhaps it was because he had explained the intricacies of pureblood culture to Harry that it didn’t feel awkward to ask him about muggle culture. It seemed a fair trade, after all.
Draco had let Pansy tag along while he went furniture shopping and she provided some surprisingly helpful insight. They had spent the entire day looking at sofas and bed frames and end tables yesterday, and with Pansy’s help, they had found everything he needed. He had arranged it so that everything would be delivered to his beach house in Rye by the end of the week. Draco wasn’t sure if the feeling in his chest, like he had eaten ice cream much too fast, was excitement or dread.
Harry didn’t think twice, he just moved. He put his whole body into it, trying to move like liquid along with the harmonies within the song. When the song was over he opened his eyes and looked around for Draco. He was standing off to the side, his right arm supporting his left as he rested his chin on his fingers, eyes cool and calculating.
“Godric, you’re right. We would have spent all our time in the library.” She groaned in defeat. “Well, I’m glad we’re friends now. It would have been a tragedy to miss out on our friendship entirely.”
“I did what I could with the shoddy subject matter I was given to work with.” George sighed dramatically, only cracking a grin when Harry elbowed him in the ribs.
“I think it’s brilliant.” Harry shook his head, chewing his lower lip anxiously. “Oddly enough, it helps. It makes me realize that this,” he indicated the space between them. “As crazy as it is, it’s real.”
“Well, that just leaves us cool kids.” Blaise reached out to wrap an arm around Luna’s waist as she flitted to his side, decked out in a bright yellow and purple dress and red radish earrings. “Anyone up for a pint?”
“I’m your mother, I will always be here to help you.” She said sternly. “Why on earth were you trying to go in there? I had assumed you would never step foot in the library or the drawing-room ever again.”
“You saw Snape?” Hermione blinked. “You saw into his mind again, didn’t you? Oh, Harry! I told you to clear your mind!”
“This is a great cast- best I’ve seen in all of my time here. We are going to crush opening night.” Draco beamed at Harry as they finished changing back into their street clothes. “I don’t think I’ve ever been this excited for a production before.”
“Inviting you, of course.” Harry’s tone left little doubt that canceling on Draco had never been an option and it made his heart skip a beat. “If you’d rather not go, we can do something else.”
A group of people ran past them shouting back and forth, but it was all just noise to Draco. He didn’t really care to see who they were, he just stopped walking and kept as close to the wall as he could. He had cast disillusionment charms on the both of them before leaving the seventh-floor corridor. The last thing he needed was to get caught up in a duel. When the group had finally vanished around the far corner he sighed in relief.
Since when did Ron sound reasonable? Harry couldn’t deny he had a point, though. Harry hardly reacted well to being cut off from the wizarding world for a few months every summer. He could only imagine what Malfoy must be feeling after being cut off for a whole year.
They discussed the movie as they followed the crowd out of the theater and towards the front doors. Draco was slightly disoriented by how late it had grown while they were in the movie. It felt like they had been in a completely different world. Harry confidently lead them to the nearest apparation point and before he knew it Draco was back on his front porch with the waves crashing gently in the distance and the sweet smell of saltwater in the air. It helped him clear his head.
The sound of pencil scratching on paper filled Draco’s empty dorm room. Everyone else was down enjoying the Halloween feast. It was the perfect opportunity to get some drawing done. He frowned at the half-formed lines critically. Why was Granger’s hair so hard to emulate? He swore at the sketchbook, erasing the offending lines with vigor. He normally didn’t include Granger in his drawings and now he was starting to see why.
“Well, all of my friends think I'm a riot. This lot just doesn't get my sense of humor.” She shrugged.
“You’re full of surprises,” Draco smirked. “Yes, like the Peverell brothers- but that’s just a children’s story.”
Harry heard rather than saw when the last six came crashing in after them. When he reached the first landing Harry turned and fired off a barrage of spells and added a classic expelliarmus for good measure. He saw Zach cast a few solid body binds and stunners themself and let out an involuntary cheer when three more men went down.
“Congratulations!” Harry reached out to shake Bill’s hand as his brothers hooted and hollered, pounding him on the back.
“I erm, I saw one of Snape’s old memories….after you all took your OWLS… and I was just wondering…. Were you guys, you Lupin and Dad…. were you good people?” He tried to surmise his question as best he could.
She debated on waking them up and spending the morning nettling details of their night from them while they were too tired to be evasive but thought better of it. She retrieved a quill and a piece of parchment from Draco’s desk and wrote a quick note. When she was satisfied with it she placed it next to the kettle, cast a warming charm on the drinks, and let herself out.
TRIGGER WARNING: There are mentions of Conversion Therapy towards the end of this chapter and evidence of egregious physical abuse. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term, conversion therapy is when parents send their gay children to the church to be converted or "cured" of their homosexuality and turned straight. Some...methods of conversion are more volatile than others. If this is triggering to you skip from the sentence that starts "Burns and scars..." to when Harry shouts "Fuck you!".
As soon as Draco left the kitchen Harry started cleaning up their celebratory mess; washing the pie dishes and picking up the discarded tissue paper until everything was as pristine as when he walked in. Just as he was putting the last fork away the gleam of the stars on the teapot he had given Draco caught his eye. When he bought it he hadn’t expected Draco to like it enough to leave it on display. He wandered over to the counter and picked up the closest cup, smiling down at the Regulus constellation. The tea set brought up a strange wave of emotion and Harry realized just how strong his feelings had been for Draco before he even realized he had them. He jumped when a woman's voice called from the living room and he laughed at himself for being so easily startled. He gently set the cup back on its saucer and went to investigate the source of the noise.
“Well, they have the Dark Mark, don’t they? They were marked by You-Know-Who. By definition that makes them Death Eaters.” Dean crossed his arms stubbornly.
“I’m teaching Harry Potter about pureblood culture, filling in the gaps his muggle upbringing caused. He doesn’t even know about the Sacred Twenty-Eight so I said I would help him get up to speed.” He snuck a glance at her face and saw her expression soften.
She carefully reached into her bag and pulled her travel camera out. If they worked out this would be a perfect picture to start a scrapbook of their relationship. After she got a couple of shots from different angles (ever the photographer) she snuck into the kitchen to start some coffee and put the kettle on. No one could ever claim she wasn’t thoughtful.
Harry came downstairs with a wet shirt and a serene smile. It looked like Teddy had tried to style Harry’s hair because it too was wet in spots and even messier than usual.
Draco reached up, holding onto Greg with one arm. Harry grabbed onto him, but they were too heavy. Draco’s hand slipped from his grasp and he pulled back around.
“I figured you could use something to hold your muggle money in. Carrying it around in a big wad isn’t really the best idea. With this, people can’t see how much you actually have.” He explained in a rush as Draco examined the black leather and ran a finger over the intricate dragon design.
“Thank you.” He shot him a cheeky grin and Harry’s heart skipped a beat. “You look pretty fantastic yourself.”
He kept a couple on him at all times. One could never be too careful these days. Harry put one on, shrinking a couple of inches while his hair grew a bit longer, straightened out, and faded to a soft chestnut brown. Draco stared at him, mouth slightly ajar.
Harry let out an embarrassing moan at the feeling of Malfoy's lips on his. They were warm and soft and moved against his own so perfectly that the rest of reality seemed to melt away. It felt as if his world was on fire and the only people in existence were him and the abrasive blond that was currently snogging him senseless. When Malfoy deepened the kiss, tilting Harry’s chin for him with a gentle finger, Harry fully surrendered to the absurd situation. If he was going to only get one chance to kiss Draco Malfoy he was going to make it count. He slipped his fingers into Malfoy's silkly hair and tugged at it, pushing himself up onto his tiptoes when Malfoy tried to pull away. When he realized what Harry wanted he tangled his fingers in Harry’s hair and gave it a rough yank, eliciting a deep groan of satisfaction. Harry carded his fingers across Malfoy's scalp before allowing his hands to explore almost of their own accord. From his hair they moved down Malfoy's back, coming to rest over his arse. Malfoy groaned loudly when he gave it a firm squeeze and forcibly slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth. Harry leaned into the hot, open mouthed kiss, giving as good as he got until they were both disheveled and panting. When Malfoy pressed more firmly against him Harry realized he wasn't the only one with a ridiculously hard erection.
Snape curled his lip before backhanding Draco so hard Harry imagined he could feel it too. The sound echoed throughout the room and Draco stumbled back, holding his cheek with both hands.
"How is it that you're a Hippogriff in an Apothecary on the ground, but you can manage to keep your feet on ice?" Draco countered, arching an eyebrow at him.
Draco turned and followed the tail end of the crowd through the castle doors and into the Great hall. Small duels had broken out here and there, but the most ferocious battles took center stage in the middle of the hall.
He wasn’t sure why, but he detested change. New was daunting, there were too many unknowns. He’d had quite enough of uncertainty during the war- everything was constantly changing. There was no normal, no routine- and that’s exactly what Harry had grown to love. He braced himself for the worst and took a hesitant sip of Draco’s drink. Sweet and bitter flavors combined to create a unique taste that wasn’t half bad.
When he went to grab the kettle he realized he was still holding the item he had grabbed. It was the protective case his mother had gotten him for his prefect badge. He opened it and smiled down at the gleaming green pin nestled against the soft grey velvet and set it on the counter. It wasn’t important and he certainly didn’t need it, but it was nice to have it back for the sentimental value. It was incredibly thoughtful of Harry to get his things released and bring them by.
Professor Dumbledore had been teaching him about Voldemort’s past, and now he needed Harry to get a memory from Professor Slughorn before they could continue on any further. Harry had been trying for months and still hadn’t gotten anywhere.
The sound of soft voices caused his heart to hammer in his chest and he sped up. When he finally found his way into what might have been considered the living room of the shack he could feel himself noticeably relax.
Hello lovely readers! Two very important relationships develop in this chapter and we get to see Draco's version of his and Harry's wand fight in the bathroom. I greatly enjoyed writing this chapter, I hope you all like it! HUGE Shout out to my DARLING beta readers AlexClio and SandZhark! This entire fanfic would not be possible without their dedication and loving bullying.
“Thank you, Mr.Malfoy. You may step down from the stand.” Shacklebolt cut off the incessant buzzing of the Wizengamot.
Pansy and Hermione had somehow melded magic and muggle technology seamlessly into their home, and the magic seemed to negate the painful soundwaves of the electricity, he simply wanted no part of it. He had to admit that he felt strangely at ease here, but he still wanted all traces of electricity removed from his house before moving in. Although it had taken a bit longer than anticipated, they had finally finished gutting all of the wires and placing the necessary charms to compensate for it two days ago. All that was left was to furnish it and move in.
“Merlin’s beard, you actually were joking!” Fred laughed, kissing Harry on the top of the head before turning towards his no longer estranged brother. “I don’t think I’ve heard you crack a joke since you were-”
There was no reason to freak out. So why did it feel like he had spasmodic butterflies in his stomach that were trying to break free?
The entire high top erupted into stifled laughter and Seamus grumbled incoherently as he set Dean’s drink back down.
As always, HUGE thank you to my lovely beta readers, AlexClio and SandZhark! They are ethereal deities who deserve to be worshiped.
"Maybe you and Draco can kick their sorry arses." Neville snorted, sitting down in the chair Draco had just vacated.
“Thank Merlin,” Draco muttered as he snuggled into Harry’s chest. “Maybe I can finally get some sleep.”
“Oi, there he is!” Fred beamed, extending his bottle of butterbeer towards him in a mock salute before polishing it off.
“Lucius and Narcissa will be there. I feel the five of us can handle just about anything.” Harry offered.
His heart began pounding an erratic rhythm in his chest, pumping faster the more he thought about his death. It was ironic. His heart seemed to be trying to get a lifetime's worth of beating out before he sacrificed himself.
“Don’t you have to shift?” Harry protested feebly, rubbing circles on the back of Draco’s hand with his thumb.
Harry just looked at them mutely. He couldn't find the words to speak. Pain burned behind his eyes and his brain felt like it had just stuck a metal fork in a plug. Ron was too busy shoving food into his mouth, as usual, but he made prolonged eye contact with Hermione. He saw the intuition flash in her eyes when she understood what he was trying to say without words.
Harry made eye contact with Zach and tilted his head slightly, indicating that he would go around and take the back. Zach nodded to show that they understood and withdrew into the shadows. Harry pulled out his invisibility cloak and slipped it over his head, moving as quickly as he dared to the back of the derelict building.
“This is incredible.” He muttered to Harry, eyeing a rowdy group of muggle teenagers that were shouting excitedly in the gaming area warily.
“You’re both being ridiculous.” She snapped, levitating the cushion farther away from her and summoning it again.
“I follow instructions, Potter.” Draco scoffed. “Something you seem to have immense difficulty with.”
His hand started to tremble and he forced himself to push those dark thoughts away. He was powerless to change it. There was no use crying over spilled potion. At least that’s what he was trying to convince himself of. He took some deep, calming breaths as he gazed at the rough sketch in front of him.
“That makes me feel loads better.” Draco rolled his eyes before continuing. “‘You two looked so unbearably cute together I didn’t have the heart to wake you. I did, however, tidy up and make you both some coffee and tea. I’ll be back at some point, so try to keep your clothes on. If you need me before then I’ll be with Hermione. Love Pansy.’”
Harry looked over at him with a devastated expression and Draco’s resolve disintegrated. He reached out and pulled him into his arms, holding him tightly as he felt Harry release a shuddering breath.
“Well, yes.” Draco’s eyes flicked up and Harry held his gaze. “About damn time, too. I constantly thank Merlin and Morgana that my mother married outside of the family or I might have turned out as simple as Greg and Vince.”
“She wanted to use veritaserum on him. When Professor Snape informed her that she had already used it all to uncover their illegal dueling club she started weighing the pros and cons of using an unforgivable curse on a student. I tried to talk her down and offer alternatives. She fought me every step of the way until Granger pretended to cry and made up some crackpot story about a weapon being held in the forbidden forest, playing right into Professor Umbridge’s paranoia.”
“To save her son.” He replied, still not breaking eye contact with Narcissa. She nodded a curt thank you then released him from her gaze. He blinked rapidly and glanced around. Draco looked like he might have been crying but Harry couldn’t be sure.
“That’s good, then.” Draco knew he sounded like an idiot, but he couldn’t think of what else to say.
Draco smirked at his friends as the rest of the house broke out into whispers. He finally had a chance to show off the result of years of dance lessons he had been forced to endure before coming to Hogwarts. He shot a cocky wink at Pansy, sending her an air kiss. She rolled her eyes at him and shook her head. Unfortunately, Snape chose that moment to look in their direction.
“It was good, thank you for asking.” Draco looked slightly mollified by the small victory. “How was yours?”
“It’s alright, I know you had court. I don’t blame you, I know you would have been there if you could have.” He smiled sadly.
The curse breaker hesitated for only a moment before breaking into a wide grin and shaking Draco’s hand with all the force of a steam engine.
“That...makes sense, actually.” Draco was relieved to understand at least something. He had never heard tales of Black hanging around the Dark Lord, but Wormtail he was familiar with. “How did he…?”
Fleur giggled at the gasps and shrieks of delight that preceded everyone abandoning the table in a rush to congratulate her. Molly was beside herself, throwing her arms around Fleur and sobbing about beautiful grandchildren.
It was harder than it looked when he was watching the girls, but Draco caught on easily enough. It was like a more intense form of dance lessons, but instead of a grumpy instructor criticizing his every move he had a machine shouting praises at him. It was exhilarating. When he glanced over at Harry during a brief pause in the flashing arrows he cracked up laughing. Harry was frowning angrily at the screen and moving like his limbs weighed a ton.
“Oh, I’m sorry. How incredibly rude of me. Draco, this is Kreacher. Kreacher, this is Draco Malfoy.” Harry flushed.
Remus knew better, of course. He didn’t know why he was standing here, uselessly staring at this damned black veil. What was he supposed to do now?
“Absolutely absurd,” Hermione confirmed. “But Harry is infuriatingly inconsistent, so you’re allowed.”
“Thanks, Dobby! I don’t know how to repay you!” He grinned, already taking off for the lake. He was running late, but with Dobby’s gilly weed already in his cheek, he was confident his luck might be turning around. He might even win this thing.
“You were saying how there are different sources of magic, but that wizards today have all come to depend on channeling their magic through a conduit- our wands, which you feel is a betrayal of wild magic and the old ways.” Harry grinned.
“I can tell them to go. I know you and Ron don’t get along, and I’m sorry. He was just so sad, and Pansy said you wouldn’t mind, but-”
A commotion behind them broke Draco out of his daydream and they both turned to see what was going on.
“Potter.” Harry grinned when the man gave no reaction. He really loved the anonymity of the muggle world. “Harry Potter.”
Harry lined himself up, the tip of his cock teasing Drao's hole. Draco let ot and impatient groan and arched his hips, forcing his tip inside. They both let out a ragged gasp as Harry slowly pushed his prick inside of him. It was so tight Harry thought he might just come from the pressure alone. He moved slowly, not wanting to hurt Draco, but apparently, Draco had other ideas. He arched his back, driving Harry in deeper as he cried out in pleasure.
“You moved out of my house and threw yourself at the first abominable thing you could find, did you? Well, I’m not having it!” Vernon threw the paper on the ground and stepped on it, grinding it against the pavement for good measure. “No family of mine is going to flaunt their repulsive behaviors and bring shame upon MY house!”
Draco pulled a single fry out of the box and inspected it before trying a small piece. It was hot and very salty, and at first, Draco didn’t like it. Then Harry encouraged him to put the entire thing into his mouth and Draco discovered it was actually quite savory. Harry took the lid off his shake and started dipping his fries into it, slathering them with the thick sugary concoction before shoveling them into his mouth. Draco stared at him like he had lost his mind until he convinced him to try it with his own. The combination of salty and sweet was fantastic and he didn’t question Harry’s eating methods again. They split the two sandwiches and Harry eventually convinced him to try the horrific little brown bits that were supposedly once part of a chicken. He still doubted that the nuggets had ever even seen a real chicken, but they weren't half bad.
"Now I'm curious. How many people have wined and dined The Chosen One?" Draco smirked, a little relieved that Harry seemed just as embarrassed as he felt.
“I did. I didn’t really have any desire to go back to drawing.” He set the tray down next to the overflowing box. “I drew a bit in the Ministry holding cell, but that was the only thing I could do. Somehow I don’t feel like that counts.”
"In the flesh." Draco gave them a smile that looked more like a grimace and Ron felt a small stab of panic.
Harry ripped his hand out of Draco’s and drew his wand, pointing it at his face with a torn expression.
"Someone from the Auror department?" Dean asked, noting the familiar greeting between Draco and Ron.
He was buried underneath a load of rubble. His glasses were gone. He couldn’t see anything. Cold air hit his face and he became aware of a hot substance flowing from his temple. He was bleeding copiously. The corridor must have been blown wide open. A shaking pair of hands entered his range of vision and he suddenly was being pulled out from underneath the broken stone. He grabbed his rescuer’s shoulders, identifying her as Hermione through all of the dust that polluted the air.
“I’m sorry, I wasn’t watching where I was going.” She said automatically, reaching out to steady the person she had run into.
“I know. I know!” Draco got up and started pacing. It was a cowardly excuse not to look at Theo- to see the accusation in his eyes. “I don’t know what else to say. Nothing is ever going to make any of this okay! Salazar! I never meant to hurt you, Theo.”
His posh speech pattern sounded strange in the thick American accent and Harry couldn't help but laugh too.
"I know." Draco sighed. "I understand why he wants me to take over the firm. I wish I wanted to. I hate being a disappointment to him."
They had fallen into a pattern of studying pureblood traditions and customs one day and doing something relaxing or fun the next. Seeing Harry every day for almost two weeks was certainly not helping him get a grip on his unruly feelings for him. Harry seemed to be enjoying their time together, though, so Draco felt like it might be permissible. What did it matter that his heart would get ripped to shreds when this was all over as long as he could make Harry smile?
“Thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.” She shrunk the painting and put it safely away in her bag before digging out her coin purse.
“Sort of. Dragons are creatures of magic, but they can still be affected by the power of the ancient language. One's true name can only be spoken in the ancient language and if someone knows your true name they have the power to control you to a certain degree. It doesn’t matter what you are, everything has a true name. The word for something in the ancient language is its true name. That is what makes it powerful. Take for instance brisinger; it isn’t just the word for fire, it is fire. Brisinger is fire’s true name and that’s why a magician or an Elf or a Dragon rider is able to control it by speaking it. King Galbatorix used the power of Murtagh and Thorn’s true names to force them to swear fealty in the ancient language and the power of the ancient language forces them to uphold their oaths. That’s why they’re bound to him.” He explained as best he could, ignoring the glaring parallel of his relationship with his father. He could easily imagine Lucius as a tyrant king demanding everything be done by his design. Swap out the ancient language for family loyalty and it was a terrifyingly accurate metaphor.
“Right, so why don’t I try one last time on my own. If I don’t get it in class today, I can take a mouthful of Felix and try again this evening.” He finally nodded, placing the potion vial in his front pocket.
“Nonsense! You wouldn’t want to miss all the fun! Midnight is less than an hour away!” He waved him off, just like Harry knew he would.
Without warning his face was in Draco’s hands and he was being kissed soundly. He let out a moan of approval and immediately tangled his fingers in Draco’s hair, pulling him closer to deepen the kiss. Draco let him have his way for a moment but broke the kiss much too soon.
It had been the game he was looking forward to the most. He didn’t even care who actually won. So why had he acted like that?
Harry was cut off by a blaring alarm. The room went red and a smooth, disembodied male voice seemed to come from the walls.
“Why not?” Draco laced his fingers with Harry’s as the four of them headed towards the doors. “I’m game for anything.”
They arrived in one of the private rooms in the Three Broomsticks without incident and were directed out of the bar and down the lane. Of course the Dark Lord would want to set up camp in the Shrieking Shack. When they finally found a way inside Draco almost turned right back around. His murderer of a godfather and the other Death Eaters were already in council together. Draco was sickened by the sight of Severus. He supposed he should be grateful, if he hadn’t killed Dumbledore Draco would have had to. That logic failed to reach his churning stomach, but nevertheless, he had to endure. Sod the world, save himself. Harry too, if he could help it.
She said it with so much emotion that Harry felt a lump form in the back of his throat. He wanted so desperately to break down and tell her everything. To talk about all of the darkness eating him up inside.
She blinked a few times in surprise to find her two normally unaffectionate men snuggled up on the sofa, but she knew better than to mention it.
“Let’s get this over with, shall we?” Bill drew their attention back to the task at hand. “I’m sure my wife would appreciate it if I was home before dinner.”
“Er, I haven’t actually played this before. Dancing isn’t really my thing, so your guess is as good as mine.” Harry blushed as he decided on a song.
Draco let out a quiet sigh of relief and then leaned forwards to softly press his lips to Harry’s. It was a gentle, quick kiss, but it was enough to make Harry’s heart pound. Draco pushed Harry backward until they were both lying down and Harry held his breath.
“They just decided I was their boyfriend one day and didn’t bother to tell me.” Harry smiled nostalgically. “Which one do you want to try first?”
“I doubt it.” Harry squinted up at the rotating pods. “They’re supposed to hold, like, thirty-five people at a time.”
“Your mother tells me this is what you’ve been doing instead of Rugby.” His father's voice sent chills down his spine and Draco felt the blood drain from his face.
"Brilliant, actually. I broke things off with Anthony before the end of term and am quite enjoying my newfound freedom." Neville replied easily.
"It was in the paper." He didn't want to get his mother or Mrs. Greengrass in trouble for gossiping.
Draco sat back and watched Harry and Andromeda interact. They bickered playfully. Their relationship seemed to be a convoluted mix of mother and son intermingled with sibling rivalry. Draco counted himself incredibly lucky to have both of these amazing people in his life.
“Oh, Harry. It’s hard, but the right person is worth it. Victor and I constantly write letters and we visit each other on breaks. I spent this Christmas with him in Bulgaria, and this Easter he will be coming out to stay with me. My parents adore him.”
Teddy seemed to be in agreement. He spent longer at the penguin's habitat than any other animal, including the snake house. If Draco hadn't been so interested in the penguins the snake house would have probably been his favorite. There were so many different breeds and colors. Harry talked to all of the snakes and was able to give them incredible information none of the nameplates had. Draco learned that boa constrictors had a surprisingly morbid sense of humor and that the pythons were just as excitable as Teddy. He could probably spend an entire day there with Harry and not grow bored.
“That Potter is your mystery man? Yes, I figured that out.” Ari chuckled. “Go on, you crazy kids. I can manage closing up on my own.” When Draco hesitated with a torn expression he shoved him towards Potter playfully. “Go have fun, you have my blessing.”
“I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” Dumbledore’s voice turned from overly cheerful to pleading. The change in tone made Draco grimace. “Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you. I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you, but now, at last, we can speak plainly to each other. . . . it is never too late. . . . I can help you, Draco.”
“Not to worry, Miss Granger. We didn’t expect to be honored with his presence today. We are gratified enough to be in yours.” his father said charmingly, wrapping his arm around his mother’s waist.
Harry threw himself onto Sirius’s bed, glaring at the muggle bikini models as his thoughts strayed to Draco once more.
“Perfect, so think of Merlin and all of his immense magic, then triple that and you will have the kind of power that we believe the original three possessed.”
The Great Hall was draped in black, house cup forgotten in light of this tragedy. Harry had been in the hospital wing the past couple of days and Draco tried to convince himself that was a good thing. At least he’s getting looked after. He just couldn’t visit, of course. Wouldn't that be priceless, a Malfoy going to visit Saint Potter in the hospital wing? Nothing like a good scandal to distract the school from the cloud of darkness and uncertainty at their doorstep. Draco glanced over at the Gryffindor table more out of habit than anything else and was rewarded with his first sight of Harry since the third task. He looked horrible. His eyes had dark circles under them and he wouldn’t meet anyone's gaze for longer than a few seconds. Draco recognized that look. It was the same look he wore after spending… quality time with his father. He didn’t know how to help. He was in for a rough summer as it was, now that The Dark Lord was back. Draco tried not to let the fear control him. He was all but guaranteed to be meeting The Dark Lord this summer. The mere thought of it left him cold. What was he going to do?
"Everything. That I'm gay, that I'm a dancer, that I don't want to go to law school- all of it. I have a plan, but I need your help to pull it off." His hands were shaking but he was pleased that his voice was smooth.
Draco relaxed as he took his first sip of tea, groaning in appreciation. He wasn’t sure what it was, but his mother always made the best tea.
"I hope not." He muttered. "It will all work out, right? We will get through all of this and everything will be fine."
Brilliant sunlight heralded a perfect Saturday morning. It was already much too hot outside, but from the safety of the air-conditioned cafe, Draco found he could appreciate the beauty of it. He waited patiently for Harry to show up, trying to convince himself that the fluttering in his stomach wasn’t anticipation for seeing the Boy Who Lived. He was simply eager to have an enjoyable day off. When Harry walked into the coffee shop, however, all notions of Harry not being the highlight of his day went out the window. His heart leaped in his chest and his stomach felt like it had done a rather impressive backflip when Harry made directly for their usual table.
“Cheers, Potter. I thought we had made progress.” Draco winced, appearing offended. “Run along then. You can tell Healer Grey what a terrible healer I am next week.”
Harry laughed first, and soon the rest of their strange little group joined in. The atmosphere at the table became much more relaxed after that. By the time the server came back with Harry’s strange, bubbling drink they were all ready to order. Harry even went as far as to order them all something called a margarita, which was apparently a staple of Mexican dining.
“Good. Now that we have that all sorted, shall we get started? The smell is giving me a headache.” Bill broke them out of their little moment.
He had successfully managed to escape attending the first half of trials, but he had asked Kingsley to alert him when the Malfoys were next on the docket. Why did it have to be today of all days? More importantly, why had it taken the Ministry almost a year to try the Malfoy family?
Harry closed and locked the door with a relieved sigh. All things considered, the encounter could have gone worse. Draco could have hexed him. Or pushed him into the pool on purpose. Luna had said he looked distraught when Harry hit the water. That had to be a good sign. If he really hated him he wouldn't have been upset over it, right? There was still one tiny, insignificant little problem.
“Sort of.” Harry took a sip of his sugary soda. “I had a rough idea of where I wanted to take you, Hermione just helped me narrow it down and fed me interesting facts. I had originally planned on spending more time at Westminster. I thought checking out the palace and touring Parliament sounded brilliant, but that security guard sort of put a wrench in those plans.”
Harry pushed back from the table and set what seemed like an exorbitant amount of banknotes on the table before reaching out to take Draco’s hand. Draco interlaced their fingers and allowed Harry to pull him to his feet. He wondered idly if he would ever get used to the tingle that fizzled anywhere Harry’s skin touched his own. He hoped he didn’t.
“I see, what do you need? I can grab it for you in a moment, I just want to finish off this letter to my old mentor. He likes to keep in touch.” His father said distractedly, his attention focused on the parchment in front of him.
“I know! You’ll love me again when this is all over.” Her voice echoed over the walls of the changing area and Harry couldn’t help but grin.
He braced for impact as Daphne Greengrass rushed over to him and all but tackled him in a hug. She was soon joined by Tracy Davis who wrapped her arms around both of them.
Neville took another gulp of his sunrise before approaching the table with an intense look of concentration. Harry could already see the best shot but Nev was circling the table, occasionally squatting to get eye level with the balls. When he finally picked a position Harry had to hide a smile. All of that careful consideration and he had picked the hardest shot. It came as no surprise that he didn’t make it, but Harry clapped him on the back anyway.
A night out with his friends seemed to have been good for him. The unrelenting darkness was still there, hovering ominously, but it felt a lot more manageable with his old dormmates and his new boyfriend all getting along.
“May I ask for clarification?” He played for time. He wasn’t quite sure how to answer that. What if he was too conditioned by now to change his views? He couldn’t make any promises, but that was the last thing he wanted to tell the court.
She knelt next to the Potter boy and her heart softened just a little. He looked so incredibly young laying there. His untidy black hair and round-rimmed spectacles bespoke of strangely charming innocence and all at once she understood Draco’s secret flame for the boy. She touched his face hesitantly and almost jerked back in shock when she felt warm breath escaping from his nostrils. Curiosity had her pulling back his eyelid. His pupil dilated in the firelight and her breath caught in her chest.
“Oh, Draco!” Pansy rushed forward, leaving Granger to greet his parents as she enveloped him in a hug. “I’m so glad you’re back.”
What do you get someone you used to hate, that saved your life, and now you’re on awkward terms? It was a weird line to walk. He moved slowly through the aisles, occasionally picking something up to inspect it before discarding it as too shallow or too weird. He even gave some of the tea sets a cursory glance before moving on. They were all flowery and bright, garish colors. Malfoy would probably hate those. At the end of the aisle, a black set that was sparkling caught his eye and he had to back up because he almost passed it.
This was only their second date and he was already having dinner with the family? He suddenly cast a worried glance at Draco, unsure if he should have accepted Narcissa’s invitation without making sure Draco was comfortable with it first. He was smirking at his mother as they shared a few more pleasantries so Harry hoped it was fine. When she finally bade them farewell and the last emerald flames faded from the grate they both stood up, brushing shoulders.
“Spoilsport.” Dean rolled his eyes before swanning off to buy the next round and get change for the billiards tables.
“Am I to understand that you will be speaking in their defense, then?” A tall, thin witch in the very last row asked.
Malfoy and Nott didn’t look disgusting together. No one else seemed to regard them any differently than the other couples dancing around them. Properly paying attention now, he noticed numerous same-sex dance partners flouncing around the floor. No one seemed to think it was weird or indecent.
He was still staying with Pansy and Hermione until he could get his own home set up and livable. Both witches had been overly gracious, insisting that they didn’t mind housing him for the past couple of weeks. He counted himself lucky to have such wonderful friends. The area he had chosen was decidedly muggle and the house was tainted with their odd little contraptions. When Hermione had gone with him to receive his new keys he had been startled when she touched the wall and flooded the room with artificial light. All of the buzzing and low frequency humming grated on his nerves.
"What, like a double date?" Harry smiled at the mental image of Draco and Seamus playing air hockey to the death.
“Why do you think he saved you? Twice?” a sultry voice came from the middle of the purple robes masses.
“More like ‘Magical Me’.” Draco smiled a true, genuine smile for the first time since Harry had known him.
Draco’s heart soared at his words despite himself. It didn’t matter if he got sent straight to Azkaban after the trial. Harry understood. He understood everything. That fact alone would be enough to keep the dementors at bay for a while. Perhaps he wasn’t quite as oblivious as Draco had thought.
"It's a 'New You' amulet from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes." Harry explained in a light Scottish brogue. Draco gasped at his sudden rich baritone and Harry laughed. "They change your voice too. The complete package."
“Figure what out?” Draco’s voice sounded behind him and Harry shuffled over to make room for him. “Good morning, Mother.”
“Oh, but Potter doesn’t mean that, does he? That isn’t how you work. You’re a survivor, just like me. Who are you going to use as a shield this time? Hmm?” The Dark Lord jeered.
“And if I remember correctly, you’re the one who ended up saving me.” He snorted, trying not to think of Fiendfyre.
Not even the picture of Sirius, Remus, his dad, and Pettigrew could dislodge the feeling of dread that had settled over him, however, and he stared at the dusty chandelier with unseeing eyes.
Pansy sighed impatiently as they circled around the lake. It was the ideal path for a private conversation, yet there was no conversation being made.
“They just went down for lunch.” Harry shrugged, placing the document he had just finished on the top of the pile now crowding his outbox.
He pointed his wand at Longbottom, immobilizing him so he could force the sorting hat over his head. By unspoken consent, both sides drew their wands. They stood in a stalemate against each other with the Dark Lord and Longbottom in the middle of no man’s land.
The inside was even more grandiose; what appeared to be some kind of granite flooring paved the way to a counter displaying every type of candy and snack food imaginable and the smell of something delicious permeated the air. To the left of the entrance was a dimly lit arcade with an air-hockey table and to the right was a fully functional bar. Draco had never seen anything quite like it in his life.
He had no idea what he was going to say to him, but he knew he had to say something. He couldn’t just leave things the way they were. He skirted a gaggle of party-goers and carefully made his way around the pool until he was right behind Draco.
“It’s the elephant in the room.” Harry explained. “Our shared past is like a constant elephant in the room that we never really mention. We pretend like it isn’t there- like it doesn’t matter, but it does. We still went through it. Yet here we are, a year later. I’m really glad we’re friends now, so the elephant is a reminder of everything we’ve overcome to get to this point.”
He wondered idly just how much Pansy would kill him if he skipped out on his birthday dinner to spend time with Harry.
“Not at all, Mr. Potter. We more than understand that work comes first.” his mother said kindly. “We are merely grateful for your presence at all.”
"I wanted to give you some tickets for opening night. Give them to your friends and family. It's my way of thanking you for making this production a reality for me." She beamed, handing him two thick slips of rectangular paper.
Harry shuffled down the stairs of the Burrow, rubbing the sands of sleep from his eye. It was much too early to be awake, but today was the wedding. Mrs. Weasley would skin him alive if he wasn't up to help with the preparations and Harry was loath to disappoint her. When he reached the kitchen he went straight for the kettle. It was still hot so he poured himself a steaming cup of his favorite tea, leaning against the counter as he let it steep. He was more than a little surprised to have the kitchen to himself. The house was currently packed to its breaking point with the wedding party all staying over.
Harry's eyes flew open as he turned to see his two best friends standing in front of flickering green flames. His climax faltered and faded as he caught the looks on their faces. Malfoy pulled off his cock with an embarrassingly loud pop as he looked over at them in stunned silence.
Harry flushed under the vulgar praise and pulled back. Malfoy whimpered at the loss of his mouth and Harry decided to focus on the head. He licked along his slit and swirled his tongue around the sensitive skin, sucking on it hungrily before repeating the process. Malfoy's hips bucked and Harry hummed contentedly, pulling another moan from the debauched blond.
Inside were multiple rows of oil paints and every type of paintbrush Draco could imagine. Pansy must have cast an undetectable extension charm on it to fit everything in. There was a small note nestled behind the brushes and Draco pulled it out, grinning like a fool at Pansy’s thoughtfulness.
Harry immediately handed over a rather long, thin purple thing with the words ‘Nerds Rope’ stamped across it in large childish letters. Draco didn’t hesitate to open it, eager to see what strange confections muggles had thought up and how they measured up against wizarding candy. It was odd to both look at and touch; there were multicolored individual candies attached to a red length of something soft and pliable. With one last curious glance at Harry Draco nibbled a circumspect bite off the end. The tart sugar crystals dissolved on his tongue and the ‘rope’ Harry identified as a gummy was overly sweet.
Seamus snorted while Neville and Dean chuckled at Harry’s cheek. Draco just stared at Harry like he had hung the moon.
“Happy to help. This is Bill Weasley, one of the best curse breakers in the business. Bill, this is Draco.” Harry stuffed his hands in his pockets, slouching awkwardly.
“I will be. I’m fine, I promise. Nothing to worry about.” Harry wondered vaguely if his voice sounded as flat to her as it did to his own ears.
“I didn’t even want to break up with him! He brought it up!” His voice shook with poorly concealed distress as she backed him against the wall, wand poking his throat. “There was no reasoning with him, he was stark raving-”
The gallery was relatively empty, which was perfect. That meant Arimere would be available and that there would not be a wait to get his attention. The indirect lighting gave the gallery a warm glow and Pansy sighed in contentment. She always loved spending time here. It was strangely relaxing.
“Sublime, Sound Garden, Smashing Pumpkins, Styx. What kind of band names are these?” Draco flipped curiously through the row in front of him.
“What.” Pansy’s face paled and Theo didn’t want to meet his eyes. He knew they would react like this.
Harry flinched at the slur and Blaise’s jaw dropped at the brazen use of such foul language in the presence of two ladies. Rage boiled in Draco’s veins and he was about to give a scathing retort when Harry intervened.
“I realize this is a little… weird, considering our past.” He began slowly. “There is just something about you that draws me in. This past month and a half has honestly been the best string of Saturdays I’ve ever had, and no offense but I know it isn’t due to your superior mind healing. It’s… just you. I do like you, and I want to get to know you better. Outside of your office.”
Draco frowned and tried again, forcefully sending the ball up the incline. Apparently, it was too much power because the ball bypassed the circles and fell behind the scoreboard. He huffed in annoyance.
He inspected the sticks closely, testing their weight and sighting the lengths till he found one he apparently approved of.
“Thank you.” Harry took a tentative sip and Draco was gratified at the delighted expression that graced Harry’s face. “It’s fantastic.”
An incessant buzzing noise was the first thing Draco became aware of. He groaned and muttered the spell to silence his tempus charm, glaring at his clock. Why did they have to get started so early? Only the thought of seeing Harry got him out of bed and into the shower. The hot water relaxed his muscles as he fought off the grogginess that always accompanied rising with the sun. He would have to forgo tea today, he was in desperate need of a much stronger source of caffeine. The familiar scent of his apple shampoo helped wake him up and he soon fell into his usual morning routine. He finished showering quickly and dressed in comfortable black trousers and a long-sleeve black shirt. He paused when he grabbed his eyeliner, looking at the tube thoughtfully. His parents hadn’t seen him wearing it yet. Would they care? He had been wearing it almost daily since Harry had said it looked good on him, but he wasn’t sure his father would approve. He set it back down on the counter, deciding not to risk it, and went downstairs to make a pot of coffee.
“Interesting.” She narrowed her eyes. “Speaking of Draco…. Why did you drag me down to the Slytherin dorms again?”
Harry shot him a lopsided grin that made Draco’s heart melt. He let go of Harry’s hand in favor of wrapping an arm around his shoulder, pulling him close and kissing his hair as they stepped out into the early evening sun.
As soon as they swung outward Draco was assaulted by the vile stench of dark magic. It seeped out of the library, choking him as memories of being forced to torture other Death Eaters while the Dark Lord laughed consumed him. He wasn’t certain how long he stood there gasping for breath before his mother came around the corner.
“You have the right to remain silent.” Harry moved toward the man. “Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to a fair trial in front of Wizengamot should you contest the charges placed against you. You have the right to appoint an arbiter to represent you. If you cannot afford an arbiter but still wish to be represented, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you?”
“Oh, they know now. The three of us sort of...came out right before the final battle, and George and I were both in no condition to be discrete after…” Harry took a quick, steadying breath. “After Fred died, George and I saw no point in tiptoeing around.”
“This should be fun.” Draco took his place as Player 2 excitedly as the game started counting down to start the song.
It was strange, he reflected, that he would end up being friends with Hermione. No stranger than Harry Potter being friends with Pansy, he mused. It was certainly less strange than Pansy and Hermione falling in love, yet here they were.
“I did. It was wonderful, thank you.” Draco frowned, his silver eyes searching his face for something. "You didn't like it?"
“Don’t touch me.” He hissed, finally braking from his detached demeanor to yank his arm out of Harry’s grasp. It happened so suddenly that it caught him off guard, knocking him off balance.
“Ingenious,” Dumbledore smiled yet his expression was pained. “Forgive me . . . where are they now? You seem rather unsupported.”
“How did you know it was my birthday?” Draco stepped back and relieved him of the pie before ushering him into the kitchen.
One of the drawings caught his attention. It was blackened around the edges and somewhat smaller than all the others, suggesting fire damage. When he flipped it over his heart stuttered in his chest.
At long last, the blast of the gun sounded and all of the champions moved forward, leaving Harry standing alone on the beach still trying to chew the gilly weed. There was nothing for it. He would have to swallow it whole. He gulped the plant down and then gasped as pain seared in his neck. He gingerly felt behind his ears and was pleasantly surprised to find he had grown gills. He sent Dobby a quick prayer of thanks before diving into the icy water, confident and enlivened.
This started a trend of studying one day and getting to know one another better the next. It turned into a long string of lunches and non-dates. They saw each other almost every day for the next few weeks, and Draco was flabbergasted to discover that he could- in fact- fall even harder for Harry sodding Potter. They met at coffee shops and libraries every bit as often as they visited arcades or went flying. On a few occasions, they even took leisurely strolls through parks or museums.
"What's the matter, Potter? Got a cock in your mouth?" Malfoy sauntered into the kitchen and hoisted himself onto the counter next to where Harry was chopping ingredients for dinner.
“Well I suggest you try harder.” Draco said evenly, still resolutely gazing moodily into the distance.
It was no use. He wasn’t going to be able to sort his emotions out tonight, not while the wounds Ron had left were still fresh.
“The brush strokes are juvenile and the consistency of the paint is mediocre at best, but-” He frowned, running his fingers across the canvas “the color scheme is phenomenal and the raw emotion! It’s almost surreal. I feel like I am experiencing the artist’s anger and uncertainty and pain myself.”
“I can show you to your room, Lucius, Narcissa.” Pansy motioned for them to follow her up the stairs while Hermione grabbed Draco’s hand.
“Ze curse caught Mad-eye off guard and ‘ee… ‘ee fell backward off ‘is broom. Zer was no-zing we could do-” Fleur tried to be strong for her intended, but she broke down too.
“It’s Hopsin’s vacation home. Brilliant, isn’t it?” Hermione had clearly had a hand in the planning of this party. It was well put together and she was positively bristling with pride as green lights joined the blue and white, giving everything a strangely comforting glow.
“Master Harry, it is time for waking!” Kreacher’s gravelly voice was somewhat muffled through the door.
The combination of the beer and the liquid Devil’s Snare had Harry’s head floating rather quickly. It felt like running on air, which was a rather pleasant sensation. When the others were close to finishing their beers Harry decided it was time to buy the next round. He chose a crowd favorite that was guaranteed to get them all pissed. He had to borrow a tray from the bar to bring five Irish Slammers over to their little corner, but it was worth it when Seamus and Ron cheered and Neville and Dean complained loudly when they caught sight of what Harry had picked.
“I think I would like that, yeah.” Harry’s lopsided grin was back and Draco couldn’t help but return it.
“Well aren’t you polite?” Draco rolled his eyes at him and Harry couldn’t help the strangely familiar rush of affection he felt for the sodding Slytherin.
“Merlin, I-” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath. “No, that is not what I’m talking about. Magical power is something you’re born with. Sometimes it can run in families, but mostly it’s determined by your personal potential. Surely you’ve noticed that Hermione is much more powerful than the Weasel, yes? She can perform spells that he couldn’t hope to attempt in his dizziest daydreams?”
“Started liking you? I think so.” Harry didn’t have any trouble understanding his half-formed sentence. “The more I think about it though…”
Harry seemed to be petrified, rooted to the spot as panic started bubbling up inside of him. Now that he was standing behind him Harry had no idea what his next move should be. What was he doing? He had half a mind to turn around and go hide somewhere in the house, but Nott spotted him before he could make good on that plan.
“I really don’t.” Harry tried one last time. “This is ridiculous, can’t you transfer me to a different healer?”
The rest of the waiting room fell eerily silent as they all turned as one to stare. It seemed he couldn’t even visit a mind healer without people oggeling him. He truly, bitterly, and wholeheartedly hated being famous.
“Vince!” Draco cried in shock, eyes going wide at the jet of green light that had erupted from the end of his wand. Granger dove to the side and Harry sent stunning spells in their direction. Curses were flying every which way and Draco was appalled to see more green join the throng of reds and oranges.
“Why can’t I just be happy? Why do I have to feel like I’m a constant disappointment- an inconvenience to everyone around me?” Harry let out a shaky breath and Draco realized he was crying.
"The Globe Theater?" Draco asked excitedly as they dumped their rubbish in the bin and set their baskets in the designated receptacle.
“We will have to make a jump for it.” Tonks called over the roar of the wind as she opened the train door and leaped smoothly onto the platform.
Draco’s shoulders sagged as she withdrew her wand from his throat. Without any warning, he was falling face-first onto the decorative rug in the family room. Every muscle in his body was frozen.
“The art of paper folding. I think you’ll like it. In fact, based on that swan you sent me in third year, I’d wager you’re already rather proficient at it.” Harry babbled excitedly.
“My dorm.” Pansy said shortly, pulling her down a secret shortcut that dumped them out in the entrance hall.
“You should have thought about that before telling Pansy you would, then.” She rolled her eyes at him.
“Preferably strawberry-rhubarb or cherry. He prefers tart this time of year.” Harry smiled as he remembered their conversation about the capricious nature of Draco’s favorite pie. Could it really have only been two days ago?
Talking to Malfoy became surprisingly easy after that. It was both shocking and oddly nice. Harry found that when they weren’t hexing or insulting each other they actually got on rather well.  By the time the session was over, there was no hesitation in scheduling their next appointment for the following week. He couldn't be sure if this newfound camaraderie was genuine or strickly professional, but Harry still left feeling rather accomplished.
“No, because then she wins.” Draco refused to let him go. “We’re allowed to love whoever we want. I’m not ashamed of it, so why hide to make wankers like her feel better?”
“Because you looked lonely, Pott- er, Harry. And I wanted bragging rights for having danced with the boy who lived.” She shrugged, glossing over her little slip-up. “Don’t worry, it’s all in the leading. Salazar knows I’ve danced with Draco enough times. I can take care of us, don’t you worry your scarred little head.”
“Draco means a lot to me, and I know he has a history and a bit of a reputation, but he is one of the most genuine people I have ever met and I want to make sure you aren’t stringing him along or toying with his emotions. He deserves better than that.” Ari held his gaze.
“While I was searching for Ravenclaw’s lost Diadem he found me and tried to help me escape before the others arrived. He was worthy of wielding the sword of Gryffindor and destroyed the last horcrux. He stopped Bellatrix from killing two of my best friends and held his own in a duel against her- which is remarkable considering she had previously been dueling, and was on the verge of beating, three talented witches of the same age.”
“There’s nothing you can do?” Harry asked helplessly. The last thing he wanted to do was be vulnerable with Draco sodding Malfoy.
The villa was big, but it had an open floor plan so it was easy to find his way around. He was lounging by himself in a secuded corner at the poolside in no time. There were lanterns strung up across the entire area, giving the water a welcoming glow. There were a few people milling about and sitting with their feet in the water as they laughed and joked together. It was a miracle no one had noticed him yet. He was perfectly happy brooding in the shadows.
"We're outnumbered four to one." Harry said as he slipped the hood of the cloak off so Zach could see his face.
“I think I just needed to hear you say it.” Harry placed several chaste kisses on his lips, nose, and cheeks.
“I saw that back there.” She said quietly, pointedly avoiding his gaze. “You’re worried about him, aren’t you?”
Everyone took turns buying a round for the table, and, as was their tradition, the buyer got to choose what everyone else drank. They had a very specific order that they followed; Ron was first because he usually picked beer, Seamus went second because, of course, he always bought shots and they needed to chase whatever torture he inflicted on them with the last of their beer. Harry went next because he ordered based on whatever mood he was in, keeping things interesting and mixing it up. Dean usually deferred to cocktails, making for a nice palate cleanser after whatever Harry ordered. Neville went last because he tended to opt for what he knew everyone liked, ending the night on a high note. It was a relatively inexpensive way to get sloshed and it was always fun watching the other guys try different drinks.
No sooner had the words left his mouth than he lost his balance, throwing his arms out to try and steady himself.
Draco had to laugh at himself. One would think that after spending a year in a Ministry holding cell he would have gotten over his feelings for Harry. There had been zero contact. Draco hadn’t even drawn him since he had been given parchment and a quill. In fact, he did his damnedest to forget all about Harry bloody freaking Potter.
“Why didn’t you ask Hermione or Ginny to help you?” George heaved a long-suffering sigh but gave Harry a playful wink so he obviously wasn’t too put out.
“No, I don’t think it is.” He said firmly before retreating as fast as he dared. He was rather badly disfigured by the stinging hex. Probably Granger’s doing. That insufferable know-it-all was always just ahead of him in marks. She was definitely clever enough to think of such a sneaky way to avoid trouble.
Draco froze, unsure of what to do. He didn’t want to capture Harry. Or stop him from destroying the horcrux he was holding.
He had been confined to his room for the majority of the summer so far. Nothing to complain about when your family is entertaining The Dark Lord himself downstairs. Draco wore a path across his polished wood floor. He had The Dark Lord. In his home. What was he going to do? How could he break free now? At least Theo, Pansy, Greg, and Vince came over regularly….when their fathers had to attend… meetings. They mostly took tea in Draco’s room and gossiped about anything other than what was happening this summer. Perhaps if they pretended like their 17th birthdays were forever away, The Dark Lord would forget about them. Draco was not ready to accept what would happen to him if he didn’t.

Images flashed and there was suddenly music and voices larger than life surrounding the entire room. It was incredibly intense and Draco looked over at Harry with wide eyes.
“Thank you.” He felt his ears turn red. Was it weird to be talking with her like this about her son? “I’m not really sure, actually. It all happened rather quickly. I just realized I liked him; I came to confront him about my feelings for him and he told me he liked me- then in classic Draco fashion he called me a few names and I kissed him.”
“No, it’s fine. It’s good, actually, because I know Pansy is trying to get on better with him, so I might as well start too.” When Hermione gave him a disbelieving glare he sighed. “Look, we may never be friends, but it would be nice if our first instinct when we see each other isn’t to draw our wands.” Draco said bracingly.
“The entire war was circumstantial!” someone shot back. “Are you suggesting we release all of the Death Eaters because the crimes they committed happened during the war?”
Their jaws snapped shut and they nodded for him to lead the way. Draco took off without another word, already feeling guilty for yelling at them. He slowed as they approached the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and his ballerina trolls, motioning for the others to stay close to the wall.
“Good. That means I can do this.” Draco reached over to take his hand, resting his wrist against Harry’s knee.
He had given Draco a brief tour, begging his pardon for the mess of the nearly finished renovations. Since Draco hadn’t seen Number Twelve in all of its former ignominy Harry hadn’t expected him to be overly impressed, so Draco’s level of enthusiasm was a pleasant surprise. He had complimented the addition of a magical window in the basement kitchen and the minimal modernization of the kitchen equipment. They had to step around the debris of the wall that had once held Walabarga’s portrait on their way upstairs, but Draco didn’t seem to mind.  Harry had vanished all of the carpets on the first floor, opting for a more manageable hawthorn hardwood. It brightened the place up considerably when paired with the storm grey paint he had replaced the dark and dusty wallpaper with. Where once there were horrid portraits and prickly dark artifacts Harry had put pictures of his friends and Teddy. He had replaced the old grandfather clock that shot bolts at people when they walked by with a display case that currently held the snitch Dumbeldore had left him, the two halves of his old Holly wand that were still connected by Fawks’s tailfeather, the photo album Hagrid had made for him of his parents, and the ruddy paper swan Draco had given him after their origami class a couple of weeks ago. Draco noted the place of honor given to the folded bird with a satisfied smirk that had Harry pulling him up the stairs.
“So you started tormenting me more than ever because you liked me?” Harry couldn't stop the foolish grin from spreading across his face.
Salazar, he could be such a prick. Sometimes Draco wondered if he even had a heart. Or human emotions of any kind.
Draco swatted wildly behind him, trying to force her to go. She retreated back into the cubicle she had found him in, but she didn’t leave.
"Couldn't tell in all the confusion." The nearest Death Eater shook their head. "But he took off in a rage from what I heard so my best guess is no."
“Because…” In his desperation to start looking for the missing horcrux, or at least to discuss with Ron and Hermione privately what their next move should be, Harry found it difficult to focus. His emotions were like a raging hurricane. “Dumbledore left the three of us a job to do, and he didn’t want us to tell-” he paused, trying to be diplomatic as possible “we’ve got to do it on our own, just the three of us.”
“Of course not, Nev. I never mind helping you.” Harry punched him playfully on the arm, causing them both to sway unsteadily.
“I did. I was actually surprised because I didn’t even audition for the role.” Draco smiled, reflecting back on when the cast list had been posted. It caused a bit of a stir when Madame Juliette had given two male dancers the lead roles, but she made the point that it was about damn time that the LGBTQ community had some representation on stage in the ballet.
“Only the best for you, love.” Harry flashed him a lopsided smile and Draco’s heart fluttered at the use of the pet name.
Draco sighed, taking a large gulp and wincing slightly at the taste. It was possibly the most bitter thing he had ever tasted and it burned down his throat. It must be the good stuff. Cheap fire whiskey usually didn’t hurt to swallow. He passed it to Pansy and rolled up his sleeves.
“Some of you might be, understandably, upset over tonight's events." Dumbledore leveled the entire hall with a quelling gaze as if daring someone to argue. "It is with great displeasure that I announce the tournament will proceed as planned. The goblet constitutes a binding magical contract that cannot be broken. Therefore, all four champions will be competing. I suggest we all take the time to retire, reflect, and get a good night's sleep.”
“He’d hex me before I get the chance to even finish asking.” His silver eyes narrowed against thinly veiled panic.
The Dark Lord blinked in shock for only a moment before bringing up his wand and firing a curse at him. He had an almost bored expression on his face as if he had anticipated Draco’s betrayal. Draco dodged the purple jet of light and yanked the sword up. It sliced open the Dark Lord’s sleeve before decapitating the gigantic snake still writhing around his shoulders.
As always, a massive shout out to my awesome beta readers AlexClio and SandZhark! They make this entire fic possible.
The atmosphere was buzzing with excitement as they joined a group of people chatting in the drawing-room.
The mass of purple robes shifted uncomfortably in their seats and silence reigned for the better part of a minute. Draco didn’t look up at him once.
“That wasn’t so bad.” Harry nudged him in the ribs with his elbow as he watched the last of the black fade from Draco’s hair.
“Oi, that idiotic bird slashed me to the bone, I’ll have you know.” Draco huffed. “And it wasn’t my idea to have it executed. My father can be a little...extreme when it comes to protecting me.”
Ever since the dementors had swarmed the black lake in third year, nearly killing him and Sirius, Harry had started withdrawing more and more into himself. Hermione was worried. A small part of her feared that Harry would never get better. He was much too young to have so much responsibility thrust upon his shoulders.
“I’ll never join you.” Longbottom’s voice cut through the fog in his brain but he didn’t dare take his eyes off Harry. He might open his eyes again at any moment. “I’d rather die. Dumbledore’s Army!”
That had not been a part of the deal. She wasn’t sure Draco would ever agree to meet Arimere. He was always so secretive about his drawings.
“That’s an invasion of privacy. They can’t control how much they divulge. It’s unethical!” Harry hissed.
“Here’s to us, the best of friends, and if we tend to disagree fuck you, and here’s to me!” Harry grinned as they clinked their beers.
“Come on, we better get going before the rest of them show up.” Ron’s voice faltered only for a moment.
He inspected the simple iron rune, turning it this way and that before slipping it over his head. Draco shrunk about an inch while his hair receded back into his skull before turning a dirty dishwater blond. His grey eyes brightened into ocean blue and he sprouted some impressive facial hair as his sharp features softened and became more flat. Draco looked down in time to watch his long, elegant fingers shrink and fatten ever so slightly.
Was he joking? Draco narrowed his eyes and scrutinized his expression to see if there was any hint of deception, but Harry’s eyes were open and honest, if a little bloodshot from drinking.
“How thick are you? He had the Dark Lord in his sodding home! He was tortured mercilessly and forced to torture other people. You literally just told off the Wizengamot over it.” Pansy sneered and Harry prickled at being called thick.
He was on top of the astronomy tower with no real memory of having gotten there. Dumbledore was already there.
“Yeah, I’ll catch up to you later.” He promised, desperate to get away from her watchful gaze. He hadn’t told anyone about the fiasco with Draco and if he spent too much time with her he was sure she would suss it out.
“I only have one more question for you, Kreacher. It’s alright if you don’t know the answer, it’s just a burning curiosity. The Dark Lord had made a comment about Regulus and me… apparently, we were the only Death Eaters to feel pain while receiving the dark mark. Do you know why?”
“Shut it, Pansy.” He groused. The rest of the fourth years looked about as well off as he was. They were all staring in different directions, sipping tea, and eating copious amounts of greasy food without speaking. “How are you not?”
They also appeared to have struck up an unusual sort of friendship, though nothing on the level of Harry’s strange friendship with his mother.
“I mean, you’ve already cleaned each other's faces. I’m pretty sure the next step is marriage.” Ron smirked.
He walked numbly down the front steps and onto the grounds. Scores of people were running around, shouting, trying to treat the injured, and count the dead.
“Hi.” Harry smiled at her before looking up at the glowing signs above her head. “We’ll have a double cheeseburger, a ten-piece nugget with one of each kind of dipping sauce, a McChicken, two large fries, one large vanilla shake, and one large chocolate shake please.”
“Sorry if I was a little caught up in my own life. I’ve had my own issues to deal with without having to notice Malfoy’s.” He snapped.
"I never asked you to." Draco instantly regretted his words as soon as they left his mouth. Theo looked like he had just been backhanded.
“Really? You wouldn’t mind?” Neville flashed him that shy little smile that tugged at Harry’s heartstrings and he felt a surge of affection for his friend.
“Oh, you proposed on Christmas? That’s awfully brave.” Harry shot Nott a friendly grin which he returned almost instantly.
“My mum….she asked what he had ever done to you and you said it was more that he existed.” Harry let the statement hang in the air. Sirius at least had enough decency to look ashamed at that.
“An appraisal! How exciting.” He gave her an overly dramatic gasp as he pulled her over towards the counter. “What wonderful find did you bring me today?”
Draco couldn’t even find amusement in the fact that the power-hungry prat referred to himself in the third person. A soft whimper arose from the prone figure shaking on the ground.
Apparently, he didn’t make it convincing enough because Molly frowned, rubbed his cheek with her thumb, and kissed him again on the temple.
“Keep the questions relevant to Draco’s case.” The minister boomed, obviously fed up with having to keep reminding the court to stay on topic.
Draco had given it serious consideration. The way he saw it, there were two solutions to his Harry situation. Option one: he could quit the ballet, which would save him from both having to see Harry and having to come out to his father; but that also meant giving up something he loved over a boy which was asinine. Option two: he could spend as little time at Hogwarts as possible- show up mere moments before he had to be there, dance his heart out, and then disappear the moment the rehearsal or performance was over; but that would take precision and well-planned timing. The first option was very tempting. After careful deliberation, however, he ended up choosing the latter because he couldn’t bear to disappoint Madame Juliette. This line of thinking is what led him to sit in the studio parking lot reading his book instead of going inside until the last minute. He had even worn his dance costume beneath his street clothes so he didn’t have to waste time changing. When the clock read five till he got out of the Vantage, using the car to help him stretch. He knew he probably looked ridiculous to anyone who happened to drive by, but he would rather look ridiculous than have to face Harry.
"I see." His father frowned. "Anything else you need to get off your chest?" His voice was dangerous, but Draco couldn't quit now.
“They’re balloons. Muggles use them for celebrations like birthdays and anniversaries.” Harry tried to hide his amusement as Draco pulled experimentally on one of the strings and seemed overjoyed when it floated back up.
“No, you can’t, nobody can.” His voice broke on the last word so he cleared his throat.  “He told me to do it or he’ll kill my mother. I’ve got no choice.”
"I think that's a wonderful idea!" Andromeda clapped her hands together excitedly. "I must get going, but I would love it if you and your mother would come to mine for tea sometime. I haven't seen Narcissa in ages."
“You are so on.” Harry laughed, pulling the puck out of his end of the table and placing it on top. “Ready, Malfoy?”
“I don’t know when he got so good at billiards.” Seamus groaned fondly. “He wants to put a table in our spare room. I think he’s barking.”
“It’s decided then. One way or another, you’re getting that memory today.” Hermione said briskly to disguise the concern in her voice.
“Almonds.” Harry wrinkled his nose in disgust. “I hate almonds. I didn’t know Rocky Road had them in it.”
“Only you could ever think of something so off the wall to say. My subconscious is definitely not that clever.” He conceded.
His reflection looked haggard. He had stubble on his chin and his eyes had black circles underneath them. He needed to clean up if he was going to have to endure an entire night of people shaking his hand and clamoring for his attention. Maybe Hermione knew a spell to make him look better rested. He used his wand to shave quickly and even pulled a brush through his rat's nest that barely managed to pass for hair before scrubbing his face and brushing his teeth as quickly as possible. When he looked semi-presentable he pulled on the clothes that had been thrown at him and opened the door to find Ron and Hermione snogging on his bed.
“I was trying so hard to impress you, but every time I opened my mouth I just seemed to dig myself a deeper hole.” Draco chuckled mirthlessly at the memory.
“I can’t believe I hadn’t noticed till now.” Theo sounded shocked. Draco slowly emerged from his hands and was relieved to see that the attention was no longer focused on him.
Harry wasn’t magically cured of the darkness that had been plaguing him after their heart-to-heart last night, but he did seem to be doing better.
Pansy couldn’t breathe. Tonight was the night. Regardless of whether Draco fixed that bloody cabinet or not, Dumbeldore would die tonight.
"Listen, I don't want to continue to feel awkward around you, so I'm going to address the Hippogriff in the room. I’m sorry-"
“Yeah, I was wondering if you would mind bringing me a fresh change of clothes and my shower things. We’re going out for breakfast.” Harry smiled fondly at the elf and Draco was confused by their familiarity.
"You're not a disappointment, sweetheart." Her voice was thick with wistful sadness and Draco kicked himself for causing her pain.
“The second Wednesday of every month the guys all get together at the pub to catch up. It’s been a tradition for over a year and we've never missed one.” Harry flushed.
Harry didn’t rightly care at the moment. He was ecstatic when Ron showed them Potter Watch on the Wizarding Network. Hermione had been pleased to hear the voices of their classmates and friends, of course. But it was different for Harry. Each broadcast he would strain his ears for Fred or George’s voice. Hearing their generalized support of him didn’t count for much, but it made Harry’s heart soar.
“I thought-” he hesitated, trying to find the right way to express his feelings. “You said you stopped drawing after the war and picked up painting, and you’re super talented at both so I thought you might like using charcoal because it kind of combines the two. Best of both worlds, you know?” Harry scratched the back of his head anxiously, looking at the art kit instead of Draco.
“This is definitely the most challenging role I’ve been in.” Harry hummed in agreement. “But I don’t think I’ve ever been this confident, both in the rest of the cast and in myself.”
“Fine.” She narrowed her eyes at him and Theo resisted the urge to back away. She was dangerous when she looked like that. “Don’t think you can worm your way out of it tomorrow. You will either tell me everything or end up in the hospital wing. Understood?”
Merlin, he sounded like a lovesick martyr even in his own head. He really needed to get his shite together.
“Draco, I pulled everything I thought would help and a few books that he might like to read concerning his lineage as well.” His mother walked in with a rather large pile of shrunken books in her hands.
“Or…?” She prompted. She knew Weasley wouldn’t accept it if he didn’t figure the truth out for himself.
The wedding tent was set up in the quidditch field and Harry knew he would find Draco in there. He ran from the garden, suddenly desperate to see him. He couldn’t explain why, he just knew Draco needed him.
Theo, Pansy, and Macmillan were staring at him too, so Draco didn’t feel like he was cheating on his new resolution to stop looking at him.
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry happily welcomed Russian and French students into its halls for the first time in centuries. Live bats, jack-o-lanterns, and hundreds of floating candles set the ambiance for what was possibly the most exciting thing to happen to Hogwarts since the Chamber of Secrets had been opened two years prior. Hosting the Tri-Wizard tournament was a prestigious honor and the time for the champions to be chosen had come at last. The entire hall exploded with the cheers of each school as their champion was chosen. The Tri-Wizard tournament had officially begun and the atmosphere was positively crackling with electricity. Those who had entered and had not been chosen nursed their bruised egos while the rest of the students chattered excitedly.
“I can and I am. Unless you want a hair removal potion mixed in with your sleek easy when you least expect it, I suggest you sod off.”
“Do you believe Narcissa Malfoy should be pardoned?” A young wizard asked in a bored tone, obviously eager to speed the trial along.
“They’re the most relevant.” Draco cast the pile a wary look. “There are quite a bit more, but those are mostly just stuffy volumes full of prejudiced rhetoric or ancestral records for the Sacred Twenty-Eight.”
“Right then. Now, these little guys here seem to have some pent up energy, so today we’re goin’ ter try and walk ‘em.”
“Come along, Nott. We have work to do.” Pansy grabbed his hand with a determined expression before pulling him towards the parking lot.
As always, a HUGE shout out to my amazing beta readers AlexClio and SandZhark! They make my writing better and make these fics possible!
“Oh, but you’ve got to.” The ghost pouted. “You can’t very well let him kill your parents, can you?”
Draco just stared at her, unsure what to say. He hadn’t been aware they had ever been portraying such emotions. After a long awkward pause Luna spoke up from her place on stage right.
Harry’s head whipped around the room and hope blossomed in his heart when he saw it was an overwhelming majority.
"But I'm not depressed, I'm not sad all the time and I don't want to kill myself I'm...I'm just… unhappy, I suppose. There are people who have it way worse than me." Harry couldn't look him in the eye so he stared at his wine instead.
“Any wizard?” Ari pulled back and tried to flash him a mischievous grin. He wasn't very successful. “Does that include you?”
Draco couldn’t believe what he was hearing. The Order? Protect the Malfoys? He had to be joking. They would never accept them! He stared at Dumbledore.
“Do you believe Narcissa Malfoy was placed under the imperious curse?” Kingsley asked in hopes of getting the others to focus.
The shrill whistle of the kettle broke him out of his thoughts and he rushed to pour the tea. He finally had the chance to use the beautiful black and silver tea tray his mother had given him after the first time she had come over for tea. It matched the set Harry had gotten him perfectly. Draco moved quickly, suddenly eager to get back and make sure this all hadn't been an insanely realistic daydream.
“Believe me, I agree.” Ari huffed. “There isn’t anything to be done about it now, though. The damage is done.”
“Sorry, mate. We thought you’d be in there a bit longer.” Ron tugged on his earlobe in embarrassment.
“Well aren’t the Malfoy’s just a rotten bunch.” The Dark Lord hissed, slowly advancing on them. “You’re a disgrace to wizardkind, killing your own kin. I believe it is high time I took out the trash. Avada-”
He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would suggest he say something reassuring about Sirius to her, that it hadn’t been her fault. Every time he opened his mouth, however, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Of course he didn’t blame her for his godfather’s death. It wasn’t her fault. If anyone should be feeling guilt-ridden, it was him. He fell for Voldemort’s trap. If he hadn’t needed saving from rushing off to save Sirius he wouldn’t have had to die.
“Merlin, you gave me a heart attack.” Draco sighed, grabbing Harry’s cone and pushing his cup of cookie dough ice cream across the table. “Here, mine is most definitely almond-free.”
“Merlin, help me.” Pansy pressed delicate fingers to her forehead, rubbing at the vein that always started throbbing when she was feeling overwhelmed. “He’s with you, Theo. Do you think he would have started going steady with you if he didn’t like you back at least a little bit?”
Now he had another problem. How was he supposed to extricate himself from the very much still sleeping man beneath him? Just as the thought crossed his mind Harry shifted, pinning him against the back of the couch.
“But the way he looks at him- Pansy, we've been together for 3 months and he never looks at me like that.” Theo’s bottom lip trembled for only a second but Pansy caught it.
They had been friendly once upon a time. Narcissa supposed she must be upset to be interrogating someone she had once placed an amount of trust in, regardless of how small that trust might have been.
“You will listen to me, Theodore Nott, and you will listen well. Sod Potter. It doesn’t matter if he’s a damn Veela, Draco is never going to be with him. We’re on opposing sides of a war. So what if he still burns a small flame for the prat? He’s dating you." Why was everything so much more complicated this year? Theo didn't respond, choosing to stare out at the lake in silence instead.
“I never wanted to. The Dark Lord said he would force me to kill my parents if I didn’t kill him. Of course I chose to save my parents. When the time came and I had rendered him defenseless, I couldn’t bring myself to do it.”
“Here, I’ll go cheer him up with alcohol.” Draco took a glass from each side of the tray to keep it balanced and carried them over to the high top.
Pansy loved running the center, of course. Seeing scared little orphans, the forgotten or abandoned healing and growing and learning to thrive was far more rewarding than she could have ever dreamed. Some days she couldn’t believe she got paid to do this. She would have gladly done it for free.
Draco leaned towards him and claimed his lips in a searing, all-consuming kiss. Harry lost track of space and time. His entire world gave way to fire and he was no longer sure if it was the sun causing the red glow behind his eyelids or the electricity cracking between him and Draco.
There is a lovely tender moment between Draco and Lucius in this chapter and I really loved writing it. Lucius isn't so bad, often just misunderstood. I also quote the song "Kiss Me" by Ed Sheeran and these quotes will be in italics. I cherry-picked the best lines of the song (which is 98% of the song) so if you see missing lyrics that was done intentionally. Thanks for coming on this journey with me! I appreciate all of your support for this fic.
Bill and Fleur shared a meaningful glance and Harry was mildly put off by their silent communication. What did that look mean?
As always, a massive massive shoutout to my most devoted beta reader and gentle bully when I need it, AlexClio. This fic would not exist without her.
“Well, we’ve had plenty of practice taking orders from you.” Greg shrugged and guilt washed over Draco.
“Ari normally gives me Saturdays off, if you want to meet up tomorrow?” Draco hoped he wasn’t pressing his luck, but he felt like if he didn’t get a solid commitment now the coffee date would never happen.
“I came by to thank you for your wonderful housewarming gifts and I get assaulted.” He sighed dramatically. “Remind me to send a thank-you note instead next time.”
"The choreography was lovely, my darlings! Absolutely wonderful." Madame Juliette regarded them curiously. "Every move was perfect, but it was missing something. Where was the passion? The raging inferno of love and lust? What happened to that fire?”
“Then you better be on your way!” Draco hissed, shoving Harry away from him and towards his friends.
“I never said it was! But you can trust us, we are on your side. Everyone in this room has been fighting! We’ve all been driven here by the Carrows hunting us down. We’re loyal to you- to Dumbledore!”
“Come with me and I will tell you everything, I promise.” Her violet eyes sought Hermione’s brilliant hazel. When she finally held her gaze Pansy pulled her most devastating expression.
“We’ll send off a letter tonight, yeah?” Fred forced him to meet his gaze before pulling him into a fierce kiss that made Harry’s skin burn.
"It isn't fair. I've been so happy- I have no reason to feel this way.” Harry growled in frustration, pulling at his hair with the hand Draco wasn’t currently holding captive.
“That’s not-”  Harry paused, “actually that’s not half bad. It sort of...rolls of the tongue better, doesn’t it?”
The fire was devouring centuries worth of contraband, feeding on it hungrily and only growing with rage. Draco dragged one of them by the robes, hoping the other would follow until he found a pile of debris that looked climbable. When he reached the top of a pile of charred desks he turned to see that Greg was the only one with him.
This was the best part about being an Auror; being out in the field, getting his hands dirty, busting the bad guy.
“Everything went sideways on the sting and I ended up caught in an explosion.” Harry said, finally coming into his line of sight. His scarlet Auror robes were coated in dust and he had dirt smudged all over his face, yet he still managed to look appallingly handsome.
"Thanks, 'Mione." Harry's shoulders sagged with exhaustion. "I appreciate you. Thanks for…" Harry trailed off, struggling to put his immense gratitude into words. "being such a good friend."
"Really? Madame Juliette said it was a local writer." Draco blinked in surprise. "She gave us quite a bit of artistic freedom with the choreography."
Harry surrendered immediately, opening his mouth to accept Draco without complaint and Draco took full advantage. He plundered Harry’s mouth greedily, tasting the faint traces of sweetness from the bramble cocktail and the bitter bite of alcohol on his tongue when he sucked it into his mouth. Harry let out a soft groan and Draco took that as encouragement. He gently pushed Harry back until he was pressed up against the wall. He slowly wrapped his fingers around Harry’s wrists, giving him ample time to protest, before pinning them against the wall above his head. Harry's animalistic growl had Draco abandoning his lips in favor of trailing kisses along his jawline and down his neck. Harry shuddered beneath him and Draco slid one leg between Harry’s thighs, letting out an involuntary moan himself when he felt Harry’s arousal press against him.
“Salazar, it’s so good to see you!” Tracy laughed as he disentangled himself from the Slytherin girls.
“Harry…. The world isn’t divided into good people and Death Eaters. We all have a mixture of light and dark within us, fighting to break free. It is what we choose to act on that counts."
“Pansy.” He whined. “You can’t force me to ask out Potter and host a housewarming party. That’s just not fair.”
It didn’t matter. Right at that moment, the tunnel entrance opened behind him and people came rushing in.
“What happened in your sixth year?” the same bored sounding wizard from earlier cut off the others questions, clearly eager to keep things moving. Draco was immensely grateful. “Mr. Potter said he nearly killed you in a duel. Walk us through what happened.”
Harry waved him off and deepened the kiss just to spite him. Draco made a surprised sound but kissed him back, letting Harry pull him into his arms.
Harry piled his plate high with food while he recounted the whole terrible tale. They both gasped in horror and hummed in sympathy in all of the right places, but Harry still felt unworthy and alone. He was even more disheartened to realize he no longer had an appetite. It was a shame, he had been looking forward to the Welcome Feast all day. With a resigned sigh, he started picking at the food on his plate, pushing it around with a fork. He felt Ron's eyes on him again and looked up. Weary green met blazing blue and Ron's expression softened.
“Oh.” Harry blushed and fidgeted with the chip he was about to eat. “I, er, actually did a fair amount of research last night to find the best places to take you.”
“I think that’s a great idea, Harry.”  She gave his wrist a reassuring squeeze and he almost smiled.
“I know it is,” George pulled him away from the rest of the family. “If anyone understands, it’s me. You can’t cut yourself off though.”
“I hated being locked away and cut off from the world every summer. It was horrible, even when it was only for a month at a time. Coming back to Hogwarts always felt like...I don’t know, it was just a huge relief. Malfoy doesn't have that, there’s no Hogwarts for him to go back to. So I figured maybe a Slytherin night out would be good for him.” He was tearing a napkin to shreds while he talked, a telltale sign that he didn’t want to deal with whatever emotions he was feeling.
Draco’s silver eyes met hers for an instant before they were both running towards each other. The Dark Lord bellowed in fury at the loss of his most trusted, blasting his three opponents back into the crowd. He rounded on Draco and his mother, who were embracing.
No one had given them so much as a second glance with their New You amulets and Harry decided he owed George a huge thank you.
Apparently she had some catching up to do. Weasley had 4 empty glasses next to his elbow and she was not about to be out-drank by a sodding Gryffindor. She looked around hopefully and caught the eye of the bartender. She nodded at her when Pansy held up her glass and two fingers for a double refill. When she looked back at Weasley he was looking thoughtful again. His face progressed through a myriad of emotions before settling on incredulous and dumbfounded.
“We were all so worried about you.” his voice cracked on the last word and Draco rubbed his thumb over Theo’s cheekbone in a soothing repetitive motion. Silver eyes met gold and suddenly Theo was outright crying. Draco patted the bed next to him and Theo climbed in gingerly, careful to avoid jostling him.
Without stopping to think it through any further, he pushed past the students in front of him and grabbed the sword by its hilt. It vibrated violently in his grasp and he almost dropped it. He gripped it tighter and, after a moment, it seemed to accept him as its wielder. It stopped trying to shake itself out of his hands and started to feel more like an extension of his own arm. The words ‘Godric Gryffindor’ glinted in the moonlight before Draco raised it and charged at the Dark Lord.
“I defended him because he didn’t know what the curse would do. He said he had found it scribbled in a book. You should have seen his face when my blood started pouring out of my chest. He was horrified.” Draco risked a glance at Harry. He had a devastated expression on his face as he caught Draco’s eye. Draco nodded infinitesimally in acknowledgment of the apology Harry was wordlessly offering.
“I saw the git miming something to do with a nose earlier.” Ron hissed, shooting a glare across the hall to the Slytherin table. Malfoy was surrounded by his friends who were all laughing as he talked animatedly.
“You promised me embarrassing, Potter. Standing there like a lump isn’t embarrassing, it’s just sad.” Draco shot at him while he moved his infuriatingly attractive hips in rhythm with the pounding bass.
She apparated directly to the coffee shop as soon as she passed the gates of the center, not even bothering to freshen up. Draco was sitting in the window, watching the crowds walk by with an almost serene expression. His freshly cut platinum hair was arranged in careful disarray and his white collared shirt highlighted the tan he had picked up from living on the beach for over a week. Someone who didn’t know him as well as she did would think he was perfectly at ease. He glanced up automatically when she entered the cafe and flashed her a relieved smile.
“I see. Did your previous students ask you a lot of questions about the war and the role you played in it?” He inquired without looking up.
“Alright, so we are making ‘Support Diggory’ buttons. It’s decided then.” Theo flashed Draco a small smile as they arrived at their common room entrance.
Harry’s voice was all wrong and it threw Draco off for a moment. His normally velvet-like bass had become an irritating baritone when he drank the Polyjuice potion to turn into ‘Cousin Barny’ and Draco didn’t like it.
“Come here, son.” His father led him to the small sofa he kept by the fireplace, sitting down and patting the cushion next to him.

“I had to. It was what was expected of me.” Draco looked so regretful that Harry couldn’t help but believe him. “If anyone found out the Malfoy heir was gay for Harry sodding Potter…”
Harry found himself looking forward to their appointments at an alarmingly increasing rate. Six weeks later found him counting the days between sessions and he wondered vaguely if that was normal. He never felt quite this desperate to see Healer Grey.
“You’re not wrong.” He chuckled. “It’s why most Slytherins are such twats, actually. The halfbloods are alright because most of them didn’t have this shite pounded into them from birth.”
“At first.” Draco’s lip curled in disgust. “When he fell, my father was finally free...but being under the curse for so long had twisted his mind. He wasn’t the same.”
He was dressed to the nines in pale gold dress robes that matched Gabrielle and Ginny's bridesmaid dresses. It accentuated his pale skin with a warm glow, making his white-blond hair look damn near angelic.
“Thanks, Ari.” Draco gave him a small smile. “Speaking of posh pricks, how are things with Jeffery?”
“Morning, Narcissa. You look stunning today.” Harry came forward, taking his mother's hand and kissing it.
Draco tightened his grip on Harry's hand and flashed him a grateful smile. The hour and a half drive down to Poole seemed to fly by as they joked and chatted about the future. Draco noted that they both seemed to avoid talking about their future, and he wasn't sure how he felt about that. He knew, of course, that he wanted a future with Harry. The question was if Harry felt the same way.
“No, they’re not embarrassed. They just haven’t come out yet and they’re waiting for the right time.” He sounded somewhat defensive and Pansy rolled her eyes.
Something was very much not right. Why was Harry not rising to his bait? He normally jumped at the chance to square off against Draco. It was the one constant Draco could count on. If He couldn't be bothered to retaliate against his arch-nemesis there was something seriously wrong. Draco opened his mouth to goad him further but Hagrid chose that particular moment to emerge from behind his cabin with a teetering tower of crates in his arms.
“They were never my intended targets.” Draco faltered slightly. His wand arm inched slowly downwards.
"Don't you dare say fine." Draco huffed. "You don't have to talk if you don't want to, but don't insult me by lying to me."
He narrowed his eyes at Harry when something that suspiciously sounded like a snort of laughter escaped his lips.
“I was petrified and literally walked on. Yes, I really planned all of that out, right down to the broken nose.” Harry snarked back. Was he serious?
“It’s fine.” He cut her off, not wanting to make a fuss about it. “I’ll be alright. If I can’t have the prettiest boy in school, at least I’ll have the prettiest girl.”
It was currently one massive dorm room with cots and hammocks and house banners all over the place. Everyone was so happy to see them. They kept asking questions and Ron and Hermione were helping him to answer them as best they could. There was just too much that they couldn't share.
Remus absently climbed the rest of the way up the dais. The veil was fluttering and he had the strangest urge to reach for it, to just stick his hand through.
“A tea set that looks like the night sky. It’s quite beautiful actually, and he even charmed the cups to reflect the constellations of members of the House of Black. I thought it was a nice reminder that I’m also a Black.”
“It means that your feelings are valid. Let yourself acknowledge and feel them. They are your feelings, Harry, and you have a right to feel them.” Sirius put a reassuring hand on Harry’s shoulder as he took a sip of his wine.
Quiet chatter filled the hall as they waited for the hearing to begin. It set Harry on edge. After what felt like an eternity, but couldn’t have been more than five to ten minutes, the door opened and all three Malfoys were led in by someone he didn’t recognize in grey robes. All three of them were chained together and Harry wondered vaguely if they all shared a cell.
“I think you’ll pull it off.” Hermione sounded like she was trying not to laugh, which was not altogether encouraging.
He was still thinking about those damned eyes while the Minister gave him three drops of the wretched truth serum. He obediently swallowed, then shuffled over to the witness stand where he sat and waited for the potion to take effect.
“Erm, yeah.” Harry dropped his wrist now that he had his attention and Draco took a step back. “Listen, I wanted to say-”
Soulmates were rare in this day and age. It was practically unheard of, so the fact that Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were bonded was incredible. Ever since he learned about them he had fantasized about having one. After spending his entire childhood being neglected instead of cared for, Harry craved the unconditional love of a Soul Bond. He had been slightly disappointed that one didn't form when he kissed Ginny. Now he was grateful. He didn't even want to think about forcing someone to feel everything he felt and was bound to feel during this war.
“I had to have them added.” Draco’s voice brought him back down to earth. “There was originally wood paneling and rustic rafters, but I wanted to see the sky.” He was also gazing up at the stars and Harry found that he quite appreciated the look of wonder on his face.
Bright sunlight graced the highstreets of Hogsmead. Winter was finally over and spring was in full swing. Harry didn’t take the time to admire the glittering shop windows or enticing smells of food. He was on a mission.
“Kreacher took the liberty of picking proper clothes.” The elf bowed, presenting Harry with a bundle of neatly folded clothes and a toiletries basket.
"I see you have your mother's wit, as well." Andromeda chuckled. "She told me almost the exact same thing the night I left."
He slipped from the room and ran up the stairs, desperate to escape.  When he reached the top he blinked in momentary confusion. There were strobe lights flashing and loud music was vibrating the floor and walls around him. Then he remembered that the upstairs was the designated dance floor. A flash of blonde caught his attention and he almost had a heart attack until he realized it was Luna. She was dancing with Ginny in the most outlandish way possible and Harry couldn’t help but smile.
As usual, a huge shout out to my amazing, wonderful, and utterly incredible beta reader, best friend, and love of my life AlexClio.  She made this chapter possible and is the reason there is some smut at the end. I hadn't originally intended for it to happen, but she convinced me. So if you like the smut, you should thank her.
Steam was billowing past the compartment windows, obscuring the view of Hogsmeade by moonlight. The rumble beneath his feet confirmed what the smoke had only hinted at. They were gathering speed.
“I’ll take it too. I’ll take it with you. You don’t have to do this alone.” Theo clenched his fists.
People were still milling about, joking and hugging one another in celebration of the new year. Hardly anyone noticed the two boys running down the drive hand in hand. As soon as they were past the gates Draco apparated them away.
“Level two, Auror Headquarters” the smooth disembodied voice announced and Harry filed out with a couple of other wizards.
Draco gulped. Even utterly pissed he knew better than to cross Pansy when she used that tone. He nodded quickly to show he understood and sat back against the shower wall.
“It’s very you- shite!” Harry swore as the sketchbooks that had been on top of everything else went cascading to the floor. A few loose pictures fluttered out and Harry stooped to grab them after setting the box on Draco’s coffee table.
