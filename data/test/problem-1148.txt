Before Kreacher could reply, Draco heard the door open. Potter was looking at them with furrowed brows.
"Malfoy, have you ever had a friend - I don't know - not believe you -"
After showing the first years the sleeping quarters, Draco accompanied Pansy till she reached the stairs leading to her dorms. He was about to climb the stairs to his own dorm when, he was approached by Snape.
"Tomorrow, after you exchange vows with Potter, you will be back home with us and Potter will carry on with his life. Nothing will change."
"Yes, dear. He's been asking about you,  we had to lie that you were vacationing at our chateau in Marseilles - "
"What was I saying dear, ah yes, I've managed to obtain a meeting with Sirius. Kreacher did always adore me as a child - "
Draco couldn't be bothered to hear about how he would get to Hogwarts when his parents were hosting the Dark Lord. What if he found about the marriage, would he let them escape unscathed?
Draco hissed. Potter took a while to answer.
"250 galleons!" George cried and stood up.
The day of the auction was fast approaching, and Harry noticed that Draco was getting more and more eager to see what Harry was painting. Was he scared that Harry would win the bet? Harry focused on his painting, located in Ron and Hermione's shed. He had a brilliant idea for it that he was sure people would love.
Hermione laughed and shook her head. "You two are such a pair, how can you be married to him and not trust him?"
"60!" Ginny stood up just like Luna did.
win, we have a baby."
It was both sweet and weird, and Harry loved it. Now he wished he hadn't made the no-bidding on each other's paintings rule. He blushed at the thought that someone would be walking home with this painting, at least the painting stopped around the waist.
The room was still for a few minutes before the auctioneer cleared his throat awkwardly.
"Okay, let's start the bidding at 10 galleons."
Harry chuckled, running a hand through his black hair. "I trust him… mostly. I just know that he wants to win badly, and he will cheat if he has to." Harry would trust Draco with his life, he was the love of his life after all, but he didn't trust competitive Draco, he was too… Slytherin.
"30!"
"You planned this didn't you?" he whispered to him. He knew that both Ginny and Luna for some reason found it fascinating that the two of them were gay and together. He didn't fully understand it but Draco seemed to.
Draco winked suggestively. "You are an expert baker, after all."
"Let's start the bidding at 20 galleons!"
"20!"
Harry's first stop was for supplies. He would need a canvas, paint, brushes, and that board thingy, whatever it was called. He should have paid attention in art class in primary school. He stopped off at a Muggle art supplies store and marvelled at the array of products. Art was a lot more than painting apparently.
Harry enlisted Draco to help him clear up all the paint and glitter. He looked around, eager to leave the flat in its time capsule-like state. Draco moved over to pick up the pile of clothes by the bathroom and Harry stopped him. "No, that needs to stay there."
Harry stood paintbrush in hand just as he heard a rustle outside. He quickly covered his painting with a sheet and spun around. 'Is that a blonde head I see?' he wondered as he peered out the window. He swore he saw someone duck into the bushes but there was no-one there now.
"You wish! I have plans for what I want you to bake. Big plans."
Draco hesitated, but then nodded. "Okay, but if
"It's a surprise, love," Harry said as he began chopping the vegetables. "You'll see at the auction. Like everyone else."
"You will see on Saturday at the auction, like everyone else," Harry said, taking Draco's hands and then kissing him softly. Harry said with a grin, "Chin up! This is all just a game Draco, and I'm winning."
He followed the signs for the type of crafting he wanted to do. Watercolour seemed familiar, he vaguely remembered learning it in primary school and it was easy enough. Finger painting would have been even easier, but Harry was trying to win here.
Finally, the bidding stopped, and Draco's painting sold for a whopping 500 galleons to Luna Lovegood.
The room remained silent and Harry looked around, he could see everyone's eyes on George. Harry gripped Draco's hand in comfort.
Harry wandered down the aisle of the store and wondered what Draco was doing. His husband wouldn't think to go Muggle. He would probably buy expensive, exclusive supplies. Harry wasn't like that, quantity over quality this time, especially as he hadn't tried painting before.
Harry watched as the two girls went back and forth between each other, the bids getting higher and higher, much to everyone's surprise. He glanced over at Draco and saw him grinning with delight.
Harry's side of the painting was very light, streams of sunlight shone down on him and glistened on his hair and abs. Draco's was dark and moody. Their hands met in the middle where the light from Harry's side of the painting was creeping up Draco's arm, washing away the dark mark.
Harry's first few attempts weren't that great if he said so himself. He lifted up his first attempt which was little more than a load of squiggles on the canvas. He finally realised that he needed to sketch it first so that he had something to follow. He had decided to paint Hogwarts; it seemed fitting when it was the memorial auction, and he was sure that people would love it.
Sure enough when he got home, Harry was ambushed at the door. "Where have you been all day?" Draco asked, hand on hip, his thin lips pouty.
Harry used a spell to fog the windows and hide his actions from view and then shrunk his painting down into his pocket along with all his painting supplies. Harry would need to find a new place to paint, it seems that Draco may have found him.
"You want to bet?" Harry replied. "We each paint a picture and submit it to that auction coming up…"
"50!"
"I bet you that I could be an artist if I wanted to be," Harry said as he and Draco lay in bed one night. Draco sniggered and one look at Harry's horrified face and it turned into a downright roar.
"Yes… that." Harry nodded. "Then whoever sells their painting for the most money, wins."
"100!"
"Oh I think I will ask George for help." Harry was sure this would be a good idea, after all, he could use WWW products to booby-trap his new studio.
The painting was of the two of them and they were… naked.
Harry quickly packed away his painting and all his supplies. He wouldn't need to come back here again, once the painting was safely tucked away in his pockets, he opened the door. Only to see a livid Draco Malfoy standing there. "Potter…" he fumed. Draco was covered in red paint from head to toe and across his forehead, 'Gryffindor Rules' was written in golden glitter.
He purchased a selection of brushes, a large set of watercolours, a mixing palette (that was what it was called), several canvases and an easel. The next hurdle was making sure that Draco didn't see it before the auction. That meant that he couldn't paint it at home, not where Draco could and would find it. Harry knew his husband far too well. He would resort to dirty tactics to win if he got the chance.
Draco scoffed, "Well mine will be better anyway. I bet you used… muggle supplies and all, didn't you?" Harry saw in his eyes, that it was partly in jest. Draco had come a long way since they first got together. He was more accepting of Muggles and Muggleborns (particularly after Hermione beat him in every subject at school) but it was hard to slip out of a childhood full of prejudice sometimes.
Just then, Harry heard a crash, followed by a splash and then a scream. A very Draco-like scream.
Draco seemed to think for a while but nodded his head in agreement. "Fine…"
"Twice!"
"Next up for bidding is a painting by the Golden Boy, the Boy Who Lived, the saviour of the Wizarding World!" the auctioneer announced, and Harry felt himself blush.
Before Draco could go, they heard Mrs. Weasley's footsteps outside their room. The twins apparated with cracks, Weasley pulled up his covers. Potter forced him down on the mattress, before settling down, half on top of him. He clamped a hand on Draco's mouth. Mrs. Weasley opened the door a crack to check on them before leaving. As soon as she left, Draco bit Potter's hand.
"Wait. Harry, it's late. We will talk about this tomorrow, show him where he has to sleep."
"Don't be a prick Malfoy."
Draco tried to make sense of his father muttering, he seemed to have forgotten Draco. He cleared his throat suddenly.
"Fine."
"No more than you do."
"Potter, you better get to the hospital wing."
Potter and Granger waited patiently for Weasley who had turned a remarkable shade of red. His face was melding into his hair. Draco covered his laugh with a cough. He didn't do a great job though, because Potter gave him an affronted look.
Harry was going to work harder than ever to pursue this fake relationship and break Malfoys pathetic heart in the process
Harry began pacing the room "Is this just because i'm Bisexaul?? are you taking advantage of that?, how am i even suppose to know if he likes men for merlins sake"
then it hit him like a night bus  - a thought he didn't even think of
He cursed inwardly wondering why he didn't prepare more, but nothing could've prepared him for facing Malfoy no matter how much preparation
“Pans and i meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine, but considering her home circumstances she’s basically living here at this point”
Harry continued up the stairs a few steps behind him - out of breath at the end
“What are you doing” he slurred
"Up here Ron give me a second"
like in the garden when their figures brushed and Harry felt like the world was turning upside down while Malfoy clearly sent the same thing eyes going wide, he flushed
sounds about right
“Ughhhhh Draco its you and your Champagne Problems, i had to make you drag your arse up to Potters room just to ask him down to lunch like a polite host and now your off over sharing to him” turning around to speak to Malfoy as she spoke “and there’s nothing wrong with Theo he’s just off is all” now huffing back into the lounge chair
Parkinson shot Malfoy a glare through her thick rimmed glasses confused to why he was not rambling suddenly
"Top secret Fleur, you know how the Ministry can be, How's Bill?" He asked glancing to the side seeing he's not around
Then he sees it, an owl at his bedroom window at whatever hour of the night it is and disturbing his night sleep, he stretches and slips out of the bed and as he does every morning drags himself to wherever he should be going if only i was living in that dream he thought to himself as he stretched and yawned pulling open the window to see the owl - it was big and grey with specks of brown definitely a ministry owl
It was Harry’s turn to snarl and turn on his heel now - feeling heated at how much he pushed to get him out of a life sentence in Askaban because he thought he deserved a second chance, he thought he could learn from his past but clearly not
oh Harry was SO dead now
“Merlin sake Draco, get the poor man a towel instead of standing there looking at him”
Harry groaned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
he had never seen anything like it, with a long path and hedges either side along with fountains and benches to fill the front garden and archways giving it a nice touch
"Really Robards?? why would you put me on a case i wouldn't want anything to do with, i came here excited to finally get in a pro-
(See the end of the chapter for
Robards snapped Harry out of his daydream placing his coffee back down on the table
She winked "everybody wins then"
Harry snapped out of it, just physical contact with someone in a very long time is all it is he thought as he began creeping around the top floor exploring every nook and cranny for some evidence the wooden floors creaked loudly with every step and he knew if he got caught there was no making an excuse up then
"I wanted to come on a little vacation take my mind off somethings and-
Harry teased back now opening the door
“Lumos Maximo”
"Rose, Hugo i missed you guys" holding them tightly as they held him back chanting Uncle Harry Uncle Harry
"They believe they've been obliviated of their memories from a week back, after doing a couple of spells it was true they were in fact obliviated"
what could he say? oh hey Malfoy i haven't seen you in 6 years and i know you hate me but want to date!
and he stepped into the floo
Harry whips his head around the room to the tapping noise but the ballroom has faded and there's on a dark light
Robards turned the knob of the door with Auror Robards Office and stepped inside letting Harry come in and shutting the door with a click
Now he was panicking, what if it wasn't a dream but a glimpse and Harry's fear was becoming a reality that he did fall for the man with the grey eyes because the look he gave Harry captured it and the worst part of all was how he loved every bit of the dream and how it made him fall into a world and fix everything much better than any bar that he'd been to or the amount of beers and firewisky he would drink - he was simply drunk on the music and the eyes, although the waiter holding the tray of champagne and handing it out to the guests looked appeasing
"Nope nope mystery man and illegal potions is fine"
"Oh get on with it" Harry drawled out, how bad could it be that even Robards is losing his work ethic "i did live through a war and got a divorce with my wife
Keeping his stern face Robards glanced at Harry who returned a weak smile - "Look, i'm really sorry i was getting ready and Ro-
tap tap tap
She gave him an anxious stare and blanked for a few seconds before going "it'z around z'ee corner Harry just up z'the left and down z'ee road" and leaning in to giving him a quick peck on either side of the cheek and leaving
Robards winced
who could it be? he didn't know many purebloods unless Ron had a secret life of being an illegal potion stasher
Harry was greeted with a rough voice coming from Robards the man who looked like an older more wiser with a bit of young in his eyes version of Harry who was now checking his pocket watch with a stern face and looking frustrated - he was a nice man but when it came to work it was fairly masked for the most part
“Oh nothing, just er dropped something”
Perfect, a month and a half with an arse of a man, what could be worse? and Harry fell to sleep once again, dreamless
Harry had a tradition of ending up in a new muggle bar every night after a hard day at work it wasn't healthy or helpful but it took his mind off everything, gulping down the potion as he coughed at the burning sensation which he thought he would he used to be now, he pondered on how much he hates that job, every single bit of it, Robards making him wake up at 6 am for a shitty boring case, the canteens food, the late night shifts of getting owls from roofs
Is the man that bad that Fleur pales like Hermione and leaves abruptly? he was left dazed and confused
We are informing you today about the information for your trip to Château de Beaumont- le -Grey, you will floo at about 4pm and 6pm at latest to France
Harry had many questions like why am i the 'only man who can do this job' and why it's been going on for weeks with no Auror notice - but he kept quiet and listened
Hermione paused and paled
been single for the last 2 years what could he do bad that-
the water still dripping down him, drying himself off and wrapping a towel around his waist knowing his robes were downstairs anyways, he was pretty sure Ron couldn't care less about him coming down in just a towel after spending majority of his life in the gryffindor common room where you could see much more than towels around waists
Draco watched as his father was engulfed in green flames. He waited for his mother to go through before taking a deep breath.
Draco watched Potter's anger deflate in a matter of seconds. That's very interesting, he thought to himself. He hadn't realized how easy it was to circumvent Potter's anger from reaching the boiling point.
Draco's mouth twisted into a scowl, he had never remembered Potter to be this vindictive, but then again, his mother had never trapped him in a marriage before, either.
Narcissa seemed deep in thought. Her eyes closed, as she settled on the settee.
The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was wearing a hideous pink cardigan. Draco noticed with relief that Hagrid had been replaced by Prof. Grubby-Plank on the head table. He tried to catch Prof. Snape's eye without success, he wondered what he must have thought about his sudden marriage to Potter. Surely, he would know by now, he had been a frequent visitor to Grimmauld Place. Draco felt slightly hurt at the prospect, that Snape hadn't thought of checking up on him once.
Black sighed, his hand raked through his dark locks. He had been a handsome man once, when his spirit had not been sucked out of being locked up in Azkaban.
His tentative truce with Potter only aided his confusion. All the things he detested about Potter, his self-righteousness, his courage, his nosiness, he didn't find unbearable, except maybe the last one. His housemates seemed to have reluctantly accepted his new attitude towards the Gryffindors as a sign of maturity.
"You're so naive, Draco. Do you really think, he would protect us? He would lock us up with his Order. No, we need to hold the upper hand, by holding, what he values the most, the life of Harry Potter."
"Your mother has sent a message."
"Sorry, I'll just go down then - "
Across the hall, he saw Potter staring at him. He made an imperceptible gesture with his head. Draco sighed, he wished for simpler times, when Potter didn't treat him as his very own agony aunt. He excused himself and took a detour before falling into step with Potter.
*******************************************************************************************************************************
"Malfoy! Open the damn door - Malfoy!"
"Not good news?"
"Mione, Harry's finally lost it."
"I wonder, if your mother ever told you about me."
"Surely, you don't condone this Father?"
"It is O.W.L. year after all Nott, it wouldn't do to hang on to Potter's temper tantrums."
"What are you doing, Malfoy?"
"NO! You're mad if you think we would agree to your ridiculous - "
Draco was avoiding Black like the plague. He was afraid of being cornered like before. Mrs. Weasley had perhaps, not fully accepted his excuses on behalf of the twins. She usually paired him with Potter in the cleaning activities. Potter had not tried to be speak to him since his offer of a truce had been denied, which suited Draco just fine.
"Leave now, let me think."
Nott had always been a suspicious sort of fellow, he detested Draco being the unspoken leader of their group and tried to undercut him at each step. Draco loved him for it, it helped him to stay on his toes.
Draco replied sarcastically, his eyes narrowed in a clear sign of defiance. Black chuckled good-naturedly.
Draco was surprised by the way Black addressed his mother. Black looked suspicious, his hands shaking with adrenaline.
"They will come back for me, my parents love me - "
His father had launched a tirade against his indecision and cowardice.
************************************************************************************************************************
Draco made a frustrated sound as he straightened his robes. He couldn't believe Potter, he was such a bleeding heart. At this moment though, he seemed geared up for a fight. Draco had a sudden thought.
"Draco, your father and I, we've taught you better than that. This marriage won't mean anything, it's not going to affect your life in any way, it will be purely ceremonial. When the Dark Lord is defeated, I'll ensure that it's broken, you have my promise - "
"Don't be so dramatic, darling. Draco will listen to reason, he's a good boy, he will do whatever is necessary to ensure the safety of this family."
Draco wished he could get a moment of solitude in this godforsaken place. He turned around, meeting Black's unshaven face.
Draco looked at Potter, his hands were shaking in anger.
Draco felt rage at her pity, at her trying to include him in their mundane household chores. He walked away, leaving her spluttering, only to crash into Kreacher. Draco watched in disgust, as he took in the filthy rag tied around his body in the form of a loincloth.
"Fine, mother."
Draco tried to calm himself down. His hand knocked against the ring he wore around his neck. Potter and Draco had hidden their rings, Potter still wore his, on his finger, hidden under a glamour charm.
Narcissa looked amused at the events playing out in front of her.
. He seemed to be having quite an elaborate nightmare.
"Mr. Potter, I suggest you remain seated till I explain myself. Now what I'm proposing will benefit both parties greatly - "
The swirling cup came to a standstill. The light buzz of a silencing spell enveloped them.
"I spent most of it indoors."
"Well bully for you -"
"Yeah - would have been nice, if he talked to me later - but -"
"What's got you in a strop besides Snape?"
"I am so sorry, dear. I had never imagined Potter would - "
"No, I meant with your friends. Have they been asking a lot of questions?"
"I forgot now."
*************************************************************************************************************************************
"Why are you still here Potter? You should have left."
Narcissa's face barely concealed her glee, she watched as comprehension dawned on her husband.
Draco wiped his hands on his trousers before stretching out his palm. Black dropped a piece of parchment on his awaiting hand. It read -
Draco couldn't be bothered to reply, his heart was pounding at the prospect at being seated for breakfast across a group of highly trained Order members. Potter seemed to perceive his discomfort.
"Don't be so scared, Malfoy. Cast a Notice-me-not spell."
, Draco tried out the words in his head.
Narcissa's laugh interrupted him. She looked positively delighted.
"You were having a nightmare."
"Cissy, perhaps the excitement of the past week has addled your mind –"
***************************************************************************************************************************
"What?! But why -"
"We will be blood traitors, they will hunt us down -"
********************************************************************************************************************************
"Harry, what are you doing here? Go back to your room - "
"Follow me."
Prof. Umbridge's speech was so long and boring, Draco's attention wavered almost instantaneously. He watched Potter's face slump at the Gryffindor table, Draco hid his smile behind his goblet.
***********************************************************************************************************************************
Potter smiled sweetly at his mother.
Draco stared resolutely ahead and ignored him. The twins were showing Weasley a magazine with dirty pictures, Draco craned his head to look.
"She has had a long day, Draco."
Was that it? Draco crumpled up the piece of paper and shoved it into his robe pocket. He angrily shoved a piece of toast into his mouth. Black's gaze was following his movements.
"Cissy, why must we decide now? The boy hasn't even come of age, surely you're not suggesting the Dark Lord will call upon our underage son?"
"Well, anyway, 'night Potter."
"Master Draco, Kreacher is honoured -"
"What do you believe Draco? Do you trust me?"
Draco couldn't remember why he had been excited to meet his friends. He had to be very careful in not slipping up and revealing anything incriminating about the summer. Thankfully, the prefect's meeting helped him in avoiding Nott's probing inquiries.
"I want a word with Malfoy - er - Draco, that is."
"I think I'll pass."
"Wake up - wake up - Mum's calling you down for breakfast - "
"Get off my bed, Malfoy."
"Draco dear, I have had quite an enlightening day today. Come along now, I need your fittings for the ceremonial robes, I think blue would be lovely on you - "
"I knew Dumbledore would get you off -"
"You're not going anywhere, Malfoy."
"Yes sir."
"I will remove it, provided you listen to me patiently. Excellent."
"Mother, what's the purpose of this meeting - "
"Draco, darling. Don't you want your family to be safe? The marriage won't mean anything, you will be staying with us and Potter can go gallivanting on his self righteous missions.
Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat, she tapped her foot, awaiting an explanation. She must have heard him throwing up. After a minute, her face turned red.
"It's not like I'm dying to marry you, Potter. Besides, Mother has assured me that we will continue to live on as before, this means nothing -"
"Sirius, I've just come for a talk, that's all. A private chat - "
"Malfoy, I think you're wrong, you know."
Draco stopped in his tracks, he sighed, it had been worth a try. Narcissa's pinched expression was enough to make him walk back resignedly towards the manor.
"Malfoy, let's get this straight. Your mother blackmailed me into this - "
Draco's neck itched under his tailor-made robes, he felt significantly over dressed. The ceremony, as it were, was to take place in Weasley's home's backyard. His parents flanked him on either side. Potter looked constipated, his eyes darting between the three of them, as though he couldn't determine who he hated the most. Granger, Weasley, and his parents were standing by his side. Draco couldn't remember the name of the girl and the twins.
"It came to me in a dream. Draco will be instrumental in making this possible – "
"I knew you were here for a reason - what do you want?"
Draco stumbled through the Floo, in a disgruntled heap. Dumbledore, the old loon, smiled at him benignly. Personally, Draco, had always thought he was a few cards short of a deck.
Black and his mother were stuck in a staring match, Draco fidgeted in his seat. They were in a sitting room upstairs, the fraying upholstery was making him feel nauseous. A sharp knock interrupted them. Potter strode in without invitation, he looked agitated and Draco wanted nothing more to escape.
Potter showed him his hand. Carved on his skin, were the words
Potter grasped his wrist tightly, Draco struggled in his grip. For a thin, wiry boy he had considerable strength. He looked at his parents helplessly, his father had his wand drawn.
"Hogwarts!"
"I believe we have reached an impasse Headmaster. As kind as your offer may be, we couldn't accept it. Good day."
"Mad-Eye just showed me a picture - "
Narcissa's face turned expressionless again and she stroked his hair gently.
"Bully you? Hardly. Alright, I will concede, if you can give me one good reason, just one, why muggleborns don't deserve to be a part of the wizarding world. If your only argument is blood purity, then don't marry them, just allow them into a world which is as much their's as it's yours - "
"Your mother has his godfather's life in her hands. All these emotional fools - they always lose - "
Lucius harrumphed, he disliked being in the dark while Narcissa schemed.
Draco was so tempted to take Dumbledore's offer. Protection from the Dark Lord, without the repercussions of being tied down to Potter seemed perfect. He couldn't understand why his parents couldn't see it.
"Harry Potter."
Draco doubted the sincerity of his words due to the noticeable lack of his mother at his bedside. Lucius seemed to follow his thoughts.
"He's gone, you know - Hagrid."
"Aha! I knew it. I knew you had one of these. No one believed me -"
"I have detention with Umbridge today."
"Where's your wand Malfoy? Hand it over."
"Don't sass your mother Draco."
Potter released a bitter laugh.
"It's my scar, it hurts sometime."
Potter's shout echoed in the empty classroom. Draco was taken aback, he hadn't experienced Potter's anger in quite some time.
Draco awoke to a rough hand shaking his shoulder.
"He's an escaped convict from Azkaban, betrayed Potter's family - "
Draco looked up from the stubborn desk he had been trying to wrench open. Black had been keeping to himself, stuck for hours in his room with Buckbeak. He looked sympathetic, warm eyes centred on Draco. Potter's ears had perked up.
Potter was chewing his lip, Draco remembered how cross he had looked while leaving Potions. Did he have a disagreement with Granger and Weasley? He couldn't really think of any other reason. Potter looked surprised he didn't complete his sentence.
"So, Malfoy, didn't see you around much this summer. Where did you go off to?"
Potter was shaking his shoulder roughly. Draco looked outside, they had almost reached. The landscapes outside shrouded in darkness. He got up quickly, he couldn't believe he had fallen asleep without a care.
"Why has he been asking about me?"
"Draco, your mother has laid out the situation before me. I wish to know your opinion before I answer."
"Ah finally. Lucius dear, stop fretting, you look rather foolish."
"Harry, I think it would be in everyone's best interests if Draco left with his parents."
"Which is where you should be, so - "
Draco's finger was bruised from when Potter had roughly thrust the ring onto his finger. Their marriage, if it could be called that, was a brief exchange of rings, followed by signing on a magically binding contract.
An hour later, Draco could not bear Parkinson's company. She was still as dumb as rocks, which helped him circle around several sensitive topics. He wondered how she had been prefect. They joined the rest of their friends in a compartment at the end of the train. He was happy to be reunited with Crabbe and Goyle, he had been missing the security they brought with them.
"Listen, I don't have much time. Can you take a message to my mother - "
"Nah."
"How have you been holding up, Malfoy?"
"Draco, we are in the process of managing our affairs. The next time you hear from us, it may well be from fairer seas. Dear, you can't speak of this to a single soul, do you understand?"
Dumbledore raised his hand.
"Am I take your silence to mean, you disagree, Draco?"
"No."
Potter's silence spoke volumes. Draco muttered a healing spell, it didn't seem to affect the wound at all. He knitted his brows together.
Draco chewed on his lip nervously, his head began to pound. He tuned out his mother's insane rationalization, his eyes drifted to the ugly red phoenix perched near Dumbledore's chair. It seemed to peer at Draco disapprovingly. Dumbledore must have passed on his judgmental nature to the bird.
"What are you doing Malfoy?"
Draco stared back at Ginny Weasley, her red hair falling in cascades as she swerved away. He tried to remember her name - he was almost certain it was Jenny. He chuckled as he remembered her disastrous love sonnet for Potter, his smile slid off as soon as he realized where he was.
Potter huffed in annoyance. Draco lay awake for a long time before he could sleep again.
Weasley helped Potter take his trunk downstairs, Mrs. Weasley had banned spelling it downstairs since Ginny's injury. Draco looked at Granger anxiously, he couldn't remember a single civil exchange between them. He gulped loudly, hoping she would go away.  Granger bravely stood her ground.
Black seemed to be in a surly mood ever since Potter had been cleared. Draco had overheard Potter feeling guilty for leaving Black to stew in the house he loathed so much. Granger had harshly reprimanded him for it. Draco thought Potter was so self-absorbed, he probably thought even the sky was blue because of him.
"Father, it's just a prophecy, Dumbledore won't be blackmailed so easily -"
Malfoy's face became scrunched up from Harry eyeing everything about him
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry shouted from the hall
it made Harry shiver, it looked like a capture of the case he was working on, and the fact Malfoy picked up a brush and painted it added to why he was here
smiling to himself as he thought of how ridiculous that would be
He never liked people who only liked him for that, in fact Harry didnt like people praising him for it at all, after the war it left Harry with news reporters and the profit writing about him everyday, with names like "The chosen one" and "saviour" but it just brought back the words of his school enemy Draco Malfoy
He was cut off from a subtle smack on the arms and Hermione eyeing Harry suspiciously What was going on
“You’re a very strange man Potter, i was just coming to er you see me and a guest are having lunch in the garden if you would like it come”
"Uh Malfoy, who did the er paintings" Harry just wanted to break the ice, the sound of their footsteps echoing through the house in silence
Harry can be very out of it at times but that dream took him away, made him forget everything, his job that he hates, Ginny leaving him, any dwelled up feelings from the war or the lonely house he lives in, if he could he would live in that ballroom forever he thought as he began thinking back to the dream, the man with they grey eyes - how could he forget, he still had no idea why he felt like he knew them or why he couldn't make out his face but between the beautiful orchestra and the brightly lit room with a warm yellow twinge and the poliet guests and the-
they never spoke again since - but now he looked nothing like that peering up and down at the man that stood in-front of him, he grown out his hair so that his blonde locks flicked under his ears and had the top part in a middle split but all carefully brushed into place, he stood wearing emerald green robes that looked like they were made just for him - hugging him in all the right places, his face was masked from emotions but looked stunned, but his eyes Harry thought if he looked into them too deep he would fall in and drown in a pool of grey water,
"I think i better be off, you know Ron getting angry over his food" she forced out a laugh
"i haven't even met him, he could be the most awful person ever and Robards knows who he is and said he has bad past records and that i wouldn't do the case if he told me who it was, whatever that means"
He rolled from the bed throwing the duvet off and glanced around the room, it was a nice room. Harry decorated it during that time including the whole house, it reminded him too much of her, he sighed wishing he would just to stop feeling sorry for himself constantly.
he saw the grey eyes first
After his weird encounter with Hermione at the coffee shop he apparated home and dragged his feet up to bed, it was weird coming home and actually being sober for once and knowing where he was, considering the day he had he was quite proud of himself
"i er not exactly no, i actually spoke to Ron about it" Harry shot him a look
coming home from the bar
Robards gave Harry a
a guest? what if he was married or taken did Robards not think about that...not only am i coming into his home i’m potentially coming to destroy a relationship
tap tap tap
but the manor that's where his breath was really been taken away, it was elegant and modern and freshened up, but it was huge and wide almost like you could get lost just looking at it
He was cut off from his silly thoughts for the thousand time today as he bumped into a woman, clearly not watching where he was going
Harry crashed down flat on the bed staring up at the painted ceiling, the house was a dream truly but the person who he was sharing the dream with made it a nightmare, no wonder no body wanted to tell him who it was because it was right there is no way he would be lying here right now
He was startled by the sound of two voices in the garden as he followed the voices he was met by Pansy Parkinson, hair in a black bob and sunglasses that covered her entire face as she lounged back in the chairs in the front garden, Malfoy to her left doing the same, neither of them looked up at Harry as he sat in the third chair feeling awkward
"Alright i'll do it, but merlin Robards you owe me big time"
"I didn't even know you cooked muggle style, last time i was over u did it with magic and same with every time i've been over"
he sighed aloud, of course its bloody Ron, he loved Ron but he really wished he didnt have to come to his house at early hours of the morning when hes trying to get ready for another boring day at the Ministry. carefully stepping out of the shower and making sure not to slip in the process
"First of all, i'm strictly not allowed tell you who the man is, it's against the law of identity with these pureblood things and i think if i told you, you wouldn't want to participate"
Enjoy ~ Minister of Magic
Harry gave the Ministry owl a stroke down its feathers and took what the owl had for Harry - waving off the owl with a thank you and closing the window shut feeling the cold breeze get caught making Harry shiver as he climbed back into his warm bed, turning his lamp on and opening the letter, skimming over he realized
or what if it goes the complete opposite way and the man he's trying to woo for this case won't fall for it and Harry ends up in an extremely awkard situation, but Robards trusts Harry enough to be able to do it right? and he's not usually wrong and
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry happily obliged, glad he can finally rant about the case he was put on today
"Are you alright? you seem totally out of it"
the pitter patter or feet came and he was charged at by 2 young children
"Potter" he replied as if someone burnt his mouth the way his face curled
Ginny left 2 years ago to pursue her dreams of becoming a professional quidditch player. They could've worked out a long distance relationship but Ginny didn't want to, she told Harry she was no longer in love with him and that she hasn't felt like it for a while, it broke Harry. He loved Ginny and always has, sure he was only home in the evenings and for breakfast but that's how he thought it was for every couple and what happens when you grow up.
The way Draco angles his face slightly makes the afternoon sunlight from the glass wall fall softly on his cheek. And his high, well-defined cheekbone is fucking
“No, I’m really sorry. I wasn’t trying to make fun of you, and I’m sorry it came across like that. I didn’t mean to offend you,” Harry said sincerely, a little desperate to make Malfoy see his point.
“Shut up,” Harry muttered, feeling his cheeks heat up. Since he was in this far, might as well go all the way. “So, are you planning to take me out on a date or what?”
If anyone would have asked Draco why he chose to stay after all of that, he wouldn’t be able to come up with an answer. ‘
It felt different, Harry’s touch. So different yet still very familiar. It was still Harry, the man whose touch he learned to remember in the past years they met behind everyone’s back, but Draco could feel something was not entirely the same. Like a switch had been flipped inside him, and Draco automatically tuned himself to match him.
“Because,” Draco leaned in to press a kiss on Scorpius’s head, “the bad things make you stronger every time you overcome them.” He paused and put his palm on his son’s chest, waiting a few beats until he felt the familiar vibration under his hand. Draco smiled. “And the good things make your life worth living.”
, Harry wanted to spit out.
Harry seemed to catch on and hurriedly fumbled with his pockets, trying to find the key without taking one of his hands off Draco’s waist. Draco watched him produce the key after a long rummaging and struggled to open the lock, clumsily dropping the key to the ground after his failed second try. Growling in frustration, Harry bent down to pick it up.
It had stopped bothering him, that wound from the past, but now Potter had to get back and open it again, smearing salt all over it, letting Draco writhe in the never healing pain.
With a sharp cry, Malfoy made his final thrust, pushing his swollen cock deep inside him. And, Merlin, he was
Draco made a noise that sounded like a laughter, but it could be a sob as well, before he closed the small distance between them and captured Harry’s waiting lips. They kissed and kissed, not knowing or caring who deepened it first, who opened his mouth in invitation. They soon found themselves pushing each other, hands roaming every part of the other’s body.
The game stretched into a few more rounds. When the sun began to inch to the west and the children started to be Apparated back to their houses, Gita ended their quite rowdy game with the final score of 3 -1 to Draco’s team.
“About that night—”
He didn’t expect Malfoy to be angry at him like that. His intentions to talk to him lately were completely harmless. Why would Malfoy be that mad when Harry asked him to be his friend? It wasn’t a bad thing, right? Being friends?
“Pardon me?” Draco said as politely as he could amid his puzzlement, because that was what he was these days. Polite, laid back, and completely non-threatening. He was a little proud of himself that he could keep up the decent person facade in front of Potter.
“They used to be more of us here,” Gita told him while she was stirring a cauldron full of Sunblock Potion—made specifically for Draco and Harry as no one else here seemed to need it. “The population has been decreasing since the younger folks left this village for a job or education, but never returned. You’ll notice there aren’t many people my age, or your age, around here.”
Harry glanced at Ron for help but the red-head only shrugged and held his arms up, indicating his neutral stance on the matter.
No. Draco actually took him to a tiny cafe to have some tea and delicious cakes. They talked for hours about nothing and Harry did not even realise it was a date until Draco walked him back to his flat and asked if he could kiss him. He was even more baffled when the man left him with just one simple peck on his cheek. The intimacy had Harry blushing for days every time it crossed his mind.
But Potter wasn’t quite done.
“Draco?” he called softly.
Harry impulsively touched Draco’s hand, still playing with the velvet slap bracelet. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
He didn’t stop until he was right in Malfoy’s personal space. The blond man didn’t seem to mind as he met his eyes, his own crinkling slightly in the corners from his smile. Vaguely, Harry noticed Malfoy’s lips—red in contrast to his pale white skin—moved, but no voice was heard.
“It was actually a poor Korean witch.”
“I’ll take a roundabout route, okay?” Draco sighed. “A few stops in different countries. No one will know where you are.”
Harry, who had been watching him the whole time, jumped to ask, “what’s the matter?”
“If you can’t properly cast a Warming Charm like a good wizard, you should at least learn a thing or two about Muggle science,” Malfoy mocked him without malice. “Yes, Potter, diamond dust. They are just ice crystals formed near the ground. Apparently today is cold and clear enough for them to form.”
The man bent his head slightly to murmur close to his face. “The officiant is on that side of the room. Do you think you can walk all the way there or do I need to call him here?” he asked, his tone only half joking.
Surprised to suddenly have an upset Harry Potter on top of him very early in the morning, Draco could only meet the green eyes. Only a moment ago, he was swimming in his own thoughts, peacefully reminiscing the years he had spent with his husband, and now said husband was trying to smother him just to emphasize his point that he’s getting old. Like every normal living thing. A life with Harry Potter would never be boring.
But, of course, things could always be worse for Draco. From the corner of his eye, Draco saw a mop of unruly dark hair emerging from the end of his supposedly empty hallway. He tried to bite down a groan. Draco was too tired to run away from Potter right now. Maybe Potter was just walking by, he hoped silently as he slumped in his stance.
. The glow is not blinding or anything, but it's certainly unmistakable. Especially now when Draco grins at the small banter he's having with the waiter. His cheekbone is raised with all its shining glory.
Harry looked up to see Malfoy was staring intently at the thing with wonder in his grey eyes. He found that expression looked really well on the blond’s face. Childlike curiosity, almost innocent. His eyes got that childlike shine and there was a pretty flush upon his cheekbones. Had Malfoy always been this good looking?
. "You don't smell like a beta or an omega."
Draco gently put his hand on the side of Harry’s face, his thumb caressing the fading lightning scar on his forehead. “Harry,” he breathed.
“Well,
He didn’t realise the severity of this problem right until Slughorn almost kicked him out of class for not doing his work and Hermione made it her top priority to get him to understand how
“I want what you asked,” he said, turning to face Draco, letting him see the small smile on his face. “Us in the present.”
The sincerity of her words, still dripping with innocence, startled Draco. Her perceptiveness and gentle empathy reminded him so fiercely of Scorpius back at home that it took him completely off guard. Before he could keep his emotions in check, Draco felt tears running down his cheeks. Like a dam was broken, his emotions came pouring out unrestrained.
Harry felt like someone had dumped a bucket of cold water all over him.
“I’m serious!”
It was suddenly like the beginning of the Eighth year all over again.
Harry sighed again, long and suffering. He probably did deserve his boyfriend’s wrath, after all. He braced for what was coming.
Harry is losing it. "You're shining," he whispers.
Mostly, the pure, unfiltered intimacy of his actions was his affection, and Harry loved it.
“Thank you,” Gita beamed. “Ajawera literally means ‘don’t tell anyone’ in Balinese, the same term to say the secret teachings of Hinduism. The non-magical people use that to refer to our little wizarding community because, well, maybe they see us as a secret myth? People that shouldn’t exist? It’s also quite fitting, since we can’t disclose our identity to them,” she explained, her tone excited. “Anyway, I think that’s just a pretty cool thing to share about my village. Hopefully not the only cool thing here, though.”
were already stacked.
Draco let out a shuddering breath and took a deep inhale before he could smile slowly, meeting Harry’s eyes with utter amazement of the unspeakable wonder. “Draco,” he whispered.
After that, their dynamics barely changed. They talked as they always did, with the usual banters and occasional insults. They acted around each other as they always did except for a few kisses here and there, and even those were mostly done in private. Neither of them were actually trying to hide their relationship but it took people around them—and the Prophet—long enough to find out. It was nothing new for Harry to be quiet about his romantic relationships, but no one ever thought someone as open and dramatic as Draco would ever be silent about anything, including relationships.
fascinated? He explained that he got it from a Muggle toy shop as a bonus when he bought some gifts for Teddy. He didn’t give it to his godson as he thought the baby was too young for that kind of toy. At that, Malfoy hummed and slapped it onto his own wrist a few times. Eventually, he declared in a very solemn tone that
“Okay?” Draco mumbled uncertainly as he moved to gather his belongings on the table, preparing to escape from this bizarre situation.
A blush crept onto those pale cheeks. Malfoy scoffed. “I have not the slightest idea of what you’re talking about, Potter.” He turned around and continued to walk, his soft grey robe billowing from the chilly wind. It unsettlingly reminded him of the late Severus Snape.
Hermione, hands playing with her own slap bracelet, observed the two of them in silence. Her eyes glinted with a calculating look. “Why are you still Malfoy?” she asked absently, almost to herself.
“What’s the rush, Potter?” Malfoy asked, eyes twinkling in amusement. Nevertheless, he took the final step to be right in front of Harry, and without any more words, Malfoy kissed him.
“Have I ever told you how beautiful you are?” he whispered.
Harry wrapped his arms around his torso and turned him around to press Draco’s back to his chest. He landed a soft kiss on his neck. “I just hope you will be happier in the path you chose.”
“I’m asking you, Potter, are you trying to kill yourself?” Draco demanded angrily through gritted teeth.
Draco seemed to consider his offer, or maybe thinking of a reason why they shouldn’t do his ridiculous idea. Before he could come up with anything, though, Harry spoke again, “come on, aren’t you tired being holed up indoors all day? Let’s get some fresh air, yeah?”
Something had definitely happened to Potter’s head during the war.
The sun was steadily shifting to the west when Gita led them to a wide gazebo made entirely from wood, located between a vast rice field and an empty ground. In the gazebo, around twenty children from various ages were waiting for her, sitting leisurely cross-legged on the wooden floor. As Draco walked toward them, he observed that they were cheerfully chatting with each other in a language Draco recognized as the local tongue. The sight was somewhat picturesque, just a bunch of happy kids gathering with a stunning background of all green.
In a swift movement, Harry pulled both of Draco’s hands above his and then held the two bony wrists with one of his large hands, sneaking the other down to tilt up Draco’s face. Before Draco could process anything, Harry bent down to claim him with a kiss that was long and passionate. His mouth pliantly opened as Harry unceasingly nibbled at his lips.
“Oh,” Draco said weakly, because what else could he say? It felt like the invisible wound in his heart was torn open wider.
If the anger was simmering in him before, now fury was blazing through his veins at how this stranger was blatantly implying that Draco was a bad influence on Harry.
It started by being civil with one another, as they had Harry as a mutual friend and it was a standard rule of decency to be tolerably nice to your friend’s friends. They greeted each other awkwardly and tried some tentative talks at first. But really, it didn’t take Malfoy very long to fit into more comfortable and friendly dynamics with them.
“Inviting me here? What, you’re a local now?” Draco half scoffed.
“But you’re not just some bloke, are you?”
Harry stared at him wide-eyed, his breath labored like he was running.
Hermione’s eyebrows arched. “Did you know that Harry
Draco didn’t hate kids, he really didn’t, but being raised as an only child, he had no experience in handling them. He couldn’t barely deal with those who speak the same language as him, so he was certainly at a loss with the ones he couldn’t communicate with. As the girl moved even closer, reaching out her tiny hand while repeating the same foreign words from earlier, Draco tried to hide his horror.
Gita said something to Maya’s mother and the two seemed to debate for a moment until the older woman relented with a pout. Instead of offering her spicy chicken, she moved a basket of fruit near Draco. He took a tangerine with a smile, mostly out of politeness.
What made it even worse was certainly Malfoy’s reaction—of the lack thereof. While Harry was battling the last of his dignity over his unwanted arousal for him, Malfoy was as unaffected as he could be. Like this morning in the teachers’ lounge, Malfoy didn’t bother to give Harry more than an uninterested glance and a nod, as though he wasn’t aware of how troubled Harry was whenever he was around.
Silently, Draco stared at Harry’s messy writing, feeling as though his heart was bleeding. For some reasons, Harry’s explanation both sounded ridiculous and made perfect sense at the same time. He purposely gave seven years for Draco to properly move on before returning to his life only to remind him that they indeed shared happy memories together.
“You can’t do anything, but that’s fine.” Draco turned to him. “As I said, it’s not really about Lucius anymore. We—Mother and I—thought that there was a big chance he wouldn’t make it out of Azkaban alive again, either way. He wasn’t as strong as people thought.” He bit his lower lip in thought, contemplating his next words. “It’s… it just scares me.”
But Potter found him here, like he somehow always did lately, no matter how secluded Draco thought his hideaway was.
But he was here now and nothing else mattered. So, why couldn’t they be Harry and Draco, just two men with feelings more intense than anyone could explain, just lovers?
Without any other word, Harry returned his smile and pushed gently on his chest before taking his hand away. Before Draco could feel disappointed from the lost, Harry leaned in to land a kiss on his lips. It was just a chaste kiss, almost innocent since they were still in close proximity with other villagers, but it thrilled Draco nonetheless. He could feel the core of his magic thrummed gently the moment their lips touched.
, Draco thought to himself. “I should be the one asking that. Didn’t you two keep in touch with him all this time?”
“Yeah, you did,” Malfoy said and sat on his bed where Ron was before. “Slughorn was furious and it was pretty amusing if you ask me.”
Malfoy guided him all the way to his bed and gently helped him lie on it. “Okay,” he said quietly, voice so close to Harry’s ear as he bent down over him. “Now I’ll leave you to…” He tried to free the hand still gripping his robe, but Harry wouldn’t let go. “Potter.”
Harry slapped his gift on Draco’s wrist.
“What?” Harry’s hand shot up to his face, but instead of touching the skin of his cheek as he expected, all he felt was hair. “What’s happening?”
It’s not that Draco didn’t like exploring the world, discovering what it had to offer, he just relished in the consistency of home. How it had always been the grounding constant amid the chaos of his life. Until, of course, his home couldn’t contain all the disruption happening outside of it. Chaos infiltrated his home, the manor his ancestors built with pride and the school he thought would always be a safe sanctuary for him.
Draco ran around the field, trying to steal any opportunity to get to the square. The game continued on. Draco lost more of his team members, but they also managed to slowly make their way to the top of their stacks. There were only three
“No, no need to go to her. Just… just help me get to my room.”
And there they were, the pair of majestic grey eyes staring at him with so much clarity. So many unheard, private promises he reserved exclusively for Harry. So much trust and
He shouldn’t have gotten his heat, at least not now. Harry’s body worked like a clock and it was not the time for his cycle to return. But the way his body heated up and his cock started aching, it couldn’t be anything else.
Blinking slowly, Harry seemed to digest his words. “Do you think it’s similar?”
“Oh, an accident, huh? I’d very much like to be enlightened on how you ended up in that accident, oh dear great Invincible Savior,” he drawled dramatically, fuming with anger at his stupid, reckless boyfriend.
But Engel almost looked sheepish and cleared his throat. “Well, Mr. Malfoy, as you see, those golds are the last of the Potters’ monetary wealth. The Ministry hasn’t decided which other charities it should be donated to,” he said. “The personal belongings were separated into those crates. You can start going through them and decide which one you want to keep and what you will let to be destroyed.”
Before Draco could answer again, Harry thrust deeper, his hips faltering in their slow rhythm. Draco gasped as another wave of pleasure ran through his body like a shiver. Harry leaned down, his mouth finding the sensitive skin just below his ear, tickling Draco with his labored breaths.
"I knew they would clear you, you get away with everything, mate."
"You're being too noisy."
"Mr. Malfoy. You have put yourself in a very dangerous position this year."
The news about Potter's shouting match with Umbridge had spread fast even by Hogwarts standards. Draco shook his head as he listened to Zabini's dramatic rendition of the events. Nott nudged him in the side.
Kreacher gave Potter a short bow before shuffling away, muttering to himself. Draco felt frustrated as he watched him leave, he decided to corner him some other time. He nudged past Potter and entered the room, only to find Fred and George chatting with Weasley.
"Lucius, there's no place for sentiment in a marriage, it will be a marriage of convenience. Potter will get what he needs from Draco, and our family will be protected from the Dark Lord. Look how well it worked for us."
"No Malfoy, just go to sleep."
Granger looked disappointed, her dreams of inter house unity, were a long way from being fulfilled. Weasley seemed more at ease, now that Potter and Draco were sniping at each other. Potter cleared his throat.
Lucius scowled, he waited for her to continue.
Draco had barely ducked his head before Weasley's trunk soared down the stairs, knocking Ginny Weasley aside. Mrs. Weasley, was shouting, Ginny was bleeding, the twins were apparating and scaring the living daylights out of Granger.
Before Harry could complete his sentence, Hermione was hugging him.
"Why are you so far in the Magical Maladies section? Do you know how hard it was to find you?"
*********************************************************************************************************************************
Draco's eyes widened. He clutched at his mother's hands.
Draco checked that he wasn't being followed, he was carrying a rucksack with few clothes and his wand. He tiptoed down the stairs, this was the only opportunity he would have to escape from this marriage farce. The portraits snored as he shuffled past them. He had made it past the wards into the garden.
Fred Weasley twirled his wand in his hand dangerously.
Draco's hand clutched at the silver-green prefect's badge, his father would have been so proud. He sighed heavily. Weasley had been made prefect over Potter, Draco could read the disappointment all over Potter's face as he tried to be happy for his mate.
Draco felt an overwhelming urge to flee, his hands clenched at his knees.
Black turned his raging eyes to his mother, she didn't seem affected by his aggression.
"You don't realize the old man's foolishness when it comes to Potter, to ensure his safety, he would agree. And once we have Dumbledore, Potter will come along, willingly or not."
He had been hard at work for over an hour now. Potter dropped into the seat next to him.
***********************************************************************************************************************************
Fred flicked Ron on the nose. Potter was staring at Draco again. Ever since, he had been cleared, Potter seemed to be in better spirits. He edged closer to Draco before whispering.
By the time, he was done, only Potter was waiting for him. He was dangling his feet, buried in a very used copy of Quidditch through the Ages. He closed the book, when he saw that Draco was out.
One of the twins, Draco couldn't tell them apart, offered him a brightly coloured sweet. Draco knew them well enough not to accept anything they offered.
Her eyes glistened with unshed tears, her hands tightened on his shoulder. Draco blinked up at her, his eyebrows knitted in a frown.
"Did you just get off detention? It's rather late isn't it?"
"Even if you were to get Dumbledore to agree, force a protesting Draco down the aisle, do you think, that Potter of all people, would agree to this scheme of yours?"
"Isn't Father coming with us?"
"What the hell, Malfoy?"
Draco felt vindicated by ignoring him, tapping his fingers in a haphazard rhythm on the window ledge. Potter cleared his throat.
Potter scratched his nose, he was wearing a baggy shirt, torn jeans and dirty sneakers, Draco wondered if he was dressed like that in protest, but immediately corrected himself when he remembered Potter's usual attire.
"Is it always this chaotic?"
Draco hissed. Potter gave him a grateful look.
Draco saw nothing but honesty on her face. He felt relieved at her words, if all the marriage meant was wearing a ring, he could do that.
"Well, I guess, this is as good as a truce will be between us."
"Draco."
"Don't touch me, Mud - "
"And what if the Dark Lord kills Potter?"
"Mr. Potter, unhand Draco at once, or there will be consequences."
"Let me go back with you. Please, Mother. I hate it here."
Draco settled down again, his mind swirling with the new information about Potter. As his eyes closed, he thought
"I want to hear from your son."
Draco couldn't understand what a meeting with Black could achieve.
Draco shook his head to clear it of the haunting image of Diggory's lifeless eyes, seemingly piercing through his soul.  There was one thing he knew for certain, Potter was going to blow a gasket when he heard of his mother's inane plan. If only, for that reason, Draco, felt a rush of warmth.
Draco watched with derisive amusement as Granger hopped in eagerness to answer Prof. Grubby-Plank's questions. Beside him Parkinson was engaged in mocking Granger, he allowed a laugh to escape. Granger shot him a betrayed look.
"Draco, you had your mother worried - "
Potter loosened his grip but didn't let go entirely. Granger and Weasley pleaded with Potter, but he seemed hell bent on taking revenge on his parents for blackmailing him. Narcissa placed a hand on her father's arm and forced his wand down. Draco stuttered as he realized they were leaving without him.
Potter winked and walked away. Draco swallowed nervously before entering the dining hall. The only occupant was Black, Draco let out a shaky breath. Mrs. Weasley placed a plate with toast and eggs in front of him.
Potter changed the topic abruptly.
For the first time in five years, Draco set up locking charms on his curtains. He put up warding spells around his trunk. He knew how to protect himself, if not anything else. As he lay down on his bed, he pulled out the chain around his neck. His fingers traced the ring.
Draco insincerely offered to clear up before making a hasty retreat. As he went upstairs, he noted Kreacher skulking outside their room. Of course, why hadn't he thought of the house-elf?
"Alright, don't chew my head off. You will need Murtlap essence to fix that, Snape keeps some in his stores -"
Draco thought it was ridiculous that Potter was so frantic about the hearing, Dumbledore wasn't going to let him be expelled. He tried to imagine a Hogwarts without Potter, Draco smiled. With that pleasant thought in mind, he drifted back to sleep.
***************************************************************************************************************************
Before Draco could open his mouth to make a retort, Potter settled down beside him, craning his neck to see what he was reading.
His father was lost in his own thoughts now. Draco wished someone would knock him out, he could do with Potter's wild magic right now. He clenched his fists in his lap,
Draco snorted at her understatement, he didn't think his presence would help matters honestly.
Draco stood rooted to the spot.
"Don't dally boy!"
**************************************************************************************************************************
"Draco, I want you to be very careful. Promise me, that you will not try to aggravate your housemates and that you will exercise caution."
Once they crossed the barrier to platform nine and three quarters, Draco tried to maintain a distance from his present company. If any of his friends saw them with Potter and his friends, he would have a lot of explaining to do.
Draco sat down next to Potter and watched him from beneath his fringe. He felt awkward sitting in silence with Potter, without the usual push and pull of conversation to ease the situation. His fingers drummed out  a tune on the desk, his feet dangling in the air.
"Hmm."
"Mrs. Weasley? You didn't happen to get any post for me from my parents did you?"
"Lucius, enough. Dumbledore had no intention of agreeing, perhaps I overestimated his affinity for Potter. "
"No."
Draco felt adrenaline course through his veins. He was currently rummaging through Snape's stores. He had disarmed Snape's locks rather easily, he felt rather proud of himself. Potter was keeping watch. Draco's hand clasped around the bottle.
************************************************************************************************************************
Draco wished the ground would swallow him whole. Potter was staring at him, he could feel his eyes drilling a hole. An uncomfortable silence followed. Black's laugh echoed in the silence.
***************************************************************************************************************************************
He sat up in his bed.
"And left you here?"
"How unfortunate."
*************************************************************************************************************************
"Well, you will be rid of him either way."
She responded absent-mindedly while she placed the pots and pans in the sink.
She bit her lip, as though hesitant to speak her mind. Draco was not going to make it easy on her, he made to leave. She tugged at his robe, he wrenched his hand away.
Potter grinned.
"I don't need your pity -"
She cut him off by waving her wand in his face and fixing his bruises, she did the same for Draco.
Potter seemed to have suddenly noticed Draco's presence, he closed his mouth abruptly. Draco sighed dramatically, before trudging upstairs, sad that he had to leave, just when things were getting interesting.
Potter's nightmares were a real pain, Draco thought that Weasley was a lucky bastard for being such a deep sleeper. Potter released huge, shaky breaths before clutching at his forehead.
Draco raised an eyebrow quizzically.
"Why won't you agree to a truce?"
" - house filled with blood-traitors, what would Mistress think - "
"Mother - what if he finds out - you and Father must hide - "
"If you're expelled from Hogwarts, then this will be a short venture indeed -"
"Draco."
"Mother, Dumbledore was offering whatever we wanted, why couldn't we - "
"Sorry, mate. Malfoy bit me - "
It had been a week since the Dark Lord had returned. Lucius had been quiet ever since, only stepping in to make sure Draco understood the magnitude of the current scenario. Lucius sighed, his son didn't have the makings of a killer, he was too soft. He pinched the bridge of his nose before returning to the Daily Prophet. Harry Potter had been caught practicing underage magic in front of a muggle. Lucius snorted,
Potter pulled him by the wrist and trapped him against the wall. His eyes flashed with anger.
As he wandered in the corridor, Potter grabbed him by his hand and pushed him into an empty compartment.
Potter kicked at his chair.
"Fine, let's have a truce."
"I hardly think that's any of your business."
"Mother - you promised - Mother, Father, please don't leave me -"
"No, we're not, we are just on a truce."
Draco shut his book promptly and turned his face towards Potter. Potter had no concept of personal space.
"Don't make that ugly noise, how many times must I tell you?"
****************************************************************************************************************************************
"Don't be alarmed if you don't hear from us. Just know that, we are thinking of you - and - Draco, my darling - "
"Yes, Mother."
"Malfoy, I want you to know, that your opinion isn't worth anything to me."
Draco remembered the nights he had woken up in cold sweats, only half remembering the nightmare. Of course, his mother had been there then, easing him back to sleep. He felt a bitter taste in his mouth when he thought about her.
"Cissy, I've tried to train the boy, you know, I have. What are you suggesting?"
"Why are you obsessed with making it happen? You seem to labouring under the misconception that I have undergone a dramatic change of heart, I can assure you I haven't - "
Draco wiped the smile off his face, he tried to ignore the pang of guilt he felt. It wasn't fair how he was being forced to reevaluate his stance on blood purity, wasting sleepless nights encumbered with the same questions. He couldn't even write to his parents, Merlin knows where they were.
"Doing the mamba."
"Malfoy, get out of the way."
"Mister Malfoy. A word please."
"Night Malfoy."
Narcissa released a harsh laugh.
***********************************************************************************************************************************
"Boys! Enough -"
"Malfoy."
Potter grinned at him before he strode away, disappearing slowly under his cloak.
"Sirius? No -"
"Enough! I refuse to discuss this further, once you've calmed down enough, to see reason, we – "
Draco could not figure out who Potter was talking about, but the conversation from the afternoon was making sense to him slowly. They had almost reached the castle. It had started to drizzle.
Potter sprung to his feet, Draco could sense an angry tirade coming their way. His mother lifted up a pale hand.
"Mr. Potter, Draco will be leaving with us -"
Draco's mouth fell open. He stared at his father. He had been counting on Potter fighting tooth and nail and saving both of them from his mother's horrendous schemes.
"Headmaster, I think that's quite enough."
"Cissy! What you're talking about is sheer lunacy – "
Last year, had been confusing, one moment he was creating falsehoods about Potter and Granger's relationship to Rita Skeeter, and in the next, Potter had returned from the third task with Cedric Diggory's body, shouting to the skies of the Dark Lord's return.
He waited for Potter to leave, but Potter didn't seem to get the hint. Draco coughed.
Mrs. Weasley poked her head in.
"Somehow, I don't believe you -"
"How have you been dear?"
Potter twisted his arm painfully, Draco scratched at his hand with his free hand. Mrs. Weasley looked horrified at the events playing out in front of her.
"You don't seem to comprehend the power of a marriage bond. It creates a magical bank, if you will. No harm could befall Draco's partner while he remains alive – "
"Your father's friend has manged to glean that Sirius has been granted ownership of the Black ancestral house. It's all for the best, really, I never cared for it personally - "
Potter and Draco rushed to get away from Snape's quarters. They were in the dungeons, very close to the Slytherin dorms. Draco pulled Potter into a dark alcove before dousing his hand in the Murtlap essence. Potter hissed as his skin healed, leaving only the remnants of the words.
"We're going to meet your future husband, of course."
Potter was in the process of stuffing his clothes in his trunk, his glasses kept sliding down his nose. Draco looked horrified at the state of disarray in his trunk.
"Lucius, I need you to call in a favour with the man in the Ministry Archives. Ask him who gained ownership of Grimmauld Place."
Granger's lips were pursed into a thin line, clearly Draco's admission had done nothing to improve her opinion of him.
Draco tuned out as Potter argued with his godfather. He noticed a pair of huge ears listening from behind the door, that would be the house elf then. His heart hurt when he thought of the way his parents had abandoned him, but then consoled himself with the knowledge that his parents would come back for him, with reinforcements. There was no way, they would leave him alone in the lion's den.
"I said," Harry said while his fingers reached out to touch that shiny cheekbone. He definitely lost it. "You're fucking
For a moment, Draco dreaded that Astoria would push the matter, but he sighed with relief when the witch just nodded in silent understanding. She reached out to take Draco’s hand and pulled him inside, her other hand waving her wand to dry Draco’s drenched robe.
But tonight was not like that. They were standing in the dark, under the soft moonlight, and something stronger than lust was wrapping them together.
“Draco,” Harry whispered fervently, pronouncing his name like a prayer.
“Harry,” he moaned, half choked. “I’m close—”
“Come on, let’s go back,” Harry whispered to him, pulling him up and preparing to Apparate from the beach.
“No.” Draco felt invincible.
“It’s
“Any time before that.”
Not that Harry would admit he missed the old Malfoy.
Swiftly, Malfoy moved around him to see what Harry was seeing. In front of them, suspended in the air, were thousands of tiny magical orbs, glittering and reflecting the sunlight. It was not like anything Harry had ever seen. The little glitters were moving around in the air—or they were falling, Harry couldn’t be sure, their movements were too slow. The beauty of the scenery around them suddenly multiplied drastically with the flickering orbs, making it look almost eerie, radiating what felt like an ominous energy with how breathtaking it was.
The serene silence was broken by Draco’s quiet voice, “Lucius was murdered.”
Turning from the setting sun, Harry faced Draco with a tilted head. “The bride?”
Gita said Harry asked her to follow the local tradition for his burial, and that meant burning the body. Not surprisingly, Harry requested for his ashes to be thrown into the sea from the beach he had visited with Draco.
Quickly, Draco flipped through the pages. He was sure he never filled more than half of the journal in the past, but he found that the brown book was nearly full at the moment. The rest was written in that untidy handwriting he would recognize every time. Draco felt this chest constricted painfully as his heartbeat accelerated.
But people here didn’t have house elves or a ridiculously vast garden for their children to play at. The connection would be extremely useful for parents to go on their daily activities while still constantly watching their children. It was such beautiful, loving magic, and Draco couldn’t help but enving the strong bond the families shared here.
“Something’s the matter, Potter?” Malfoy asked, mildly irritated.
Closing the door behind him, Draco thought about how crazy this journey had been. Within five years, the Savior had gone from Potter, to Harry, to Draco, and now back to Potter again. A perfect circle.
“It was—,” Draco stopped to consider his answer. “It was an experience, I guess.”
Right before they left the Eighth year dorms, Neville approached them. “Malfoy. Professor McGonagall wants to see you in her office now,” he told them.
you, but you need to let me go.”
Harry was in shock of how much he could change his emotions like that, it startled Harry but what did he expect this is former death eater Draco Malfoy that clearly didn’t learn from his past stealing innocents money and making them forget after
Harry let him continue
Harry started to feel around looking for something on it
*Champagne Problems playing*
"Git" Harry said to the door
“So Potter, Draco tells me you are staying here for a good while” she said still not moving
"Harry"
"And stop stressing you never know maybe you get swept off your feet and he's not actually the man who's behind it"
"but hey you never know maybe you can put the fake relationship aside and take in the experience of the events and before you know it you've caught him and it will all be over"
"Ah yes, well you see the man also owns a b&b type thing in the manor that he holds the dinners and lets guests stay in for about 2 month or...or or a couple weeks" - seeing Harry shooting daggers at him "The point is you stay there we have the payment covered, he'll of course let you stay you are the famous Harry Potter and won't reject even considering...anyways"
Harry said quickly
Trunk spread on the floor, he was tearing out his wardrobe and shoving in whatever clothes he would find, he knew he had bad taste in clothing but he couldn't care less no matter how fancy these pureblood events were it wasn't worth spending his own galleons on, he went into the bathroom and threw whatever needed in to his trunk and from his drawers questioning wether to bring his 100 potions for every issue he has, he brought them
"Sorry for disturbing you Mate" he said approaching Harry looking genuinely sorry and exhausted while eyeing Harry's also worn out appearance
“Potter? what are you doing snorting the dust off the ground” Draco was stood against Harry’s bed eyeing him suspiciously
“Er shit is this not the bathroom, my bad” Harry said lying once again
checking signs which all read french and was no help to Harry, he kept walking but wasn't complaining the streets were beautiful after all - he was now wearing muggle clothes not wanting to startle the host at first arrival and making it look as if he was obviously working on a case as he turned a corner he noticed a hint of blonde hair, it was very familiar so he peered around to see who it could be
“Just making conversation, no need to get your knickers in a twist”
"And then he wants me to go to the fucking gits posh manor and try and get him to fall in love enough to get all the information"
Now Harry felt nervous, this case must be really serious if he didn't want anyone barging in during it
and then he remembered Hermiones face at the coffee shop and Ron's 'slimy git' comment, it was all adding up now - too bloody late
He was so done
“Go in there again Potter and i’ll hex your stupid face off”
"I did the paintings"
clearly nobody thought this through
Draco Sodding Malfoy
One month and a half, Harry slammed his head on his cushioned headboard, muttering 'Bloody Robards' thinking back to what he said in the office, of course he lied to him what did he expect
pulling her into a bone crushing hug, Harry is convinced she's a guardian angel sometimes
"It's fine, really don't worry about it if anything i was just more concerned about you" giving her a weak smile
but Draco's face formed into his signature smirk as he drawled
he now turned back at the voice he bumped into immediately recognizing the face
Robards continued
"morning Harry, follow me to my office" - Robards said not looking up at Harry who realized he's definitely late for a finally important case due to the morning disturbance
Getting sloshed in a muggle bar alone
“What do you mean acting different?” Harry asked with a hint of a sly grin
Sure Ron couldn't care about what harry was dressed like but the least he could do was shave and wash his face, he didn't need Ron pestering him with 100 questions on why he looked like he just fought the second wizarding war, he's
Robards was now flushed in the face
Malfoy is probably living with his gorgeous wife and bratty miniature malfoy kids in a posh pureblood countryside in France he snorted at the thought
palms now sweaty and a feeling of clammyness he gripped the trunk and shut his eyes to knock on the door, ur going to be fine harry he thought how bad could it be right? beautiful gardens, beautiful manor you just have to-
Harry has a terrible rambling habit
Harry sucked in the breath he exhaled
Harry ignored that, but gradually calmed down knowing he shouldn't blow up in his bosses face like that
It was like time had stopped suddenly, mind racing with so many questions and just wished Malfoy would step aside and the actual host would be standing before him, but he never came. all that stood was Draco Malfoy, paler than before and lost for words - Harry didnt blame him really they had not seen each other in 6 years, last time being at Malfoy's trials when he looked worn out and limp, strong cheekbones stronger than ever because his skin had become so thin, and the darkest circles under his eyes, his usual slicked back and white hair was dirty and everything but slicked back
"Sorry again Harry for walking out on our lunch like that" turning her head to face Harry with an apologetic look
Harry put on a green fleece jumper and some grey joggers, Ginny always said green brought out his eyes and considering the house he was in and who he was with maybe it could help with the plan
Harry was swirling his spoon in his tea at his dinner table thinking about how he would have to leave the house for over a month, it's been a while since he had to do anything like that - he would miss it
Ron stepped into the floo holding the powder "Anyways i'm off, back to my loud children and angry wife that also got awoken, enjoy the case"
the figure stepped into the light so Harry could see him
He was cut off by Malfoy, it was a terrible lie
"But this isn't some get together, these are the serious high top balls and dinners that only the richest of rich and purest or purebloods can attend, and the man who runs them...." He stopped looking for words to form the next sentence
"Buggering hell Harry, will you let me keep talking before i force someone else to do the job and get u on a new case, there's a nice one about a witch getting stuck in her chimney if you want to"
"Shit sorry in my own thoughts"
Harry felt sorry for him really during the time and wanted to help in anyway he could, he got him free from life in Askaban with Narcissa but Lucius locked up leaving Harry and Malfoy in conflict, he didnt think that was fair - all he wanted to do was make things better and patch up the war but in Malfoy's eyes Harry was doing more harm, shoving past Harry staring him right in eyes and muttering
until it clicked in his brain, ah yes he is wearing a towel that is soaking with water and currently dripping on his oak floors
she raised a look of concern trying to read Harry's eyes
he and got up out of bed, and groggily walked into his bathroom running the hot water in the shower and stepping in letting the water stream down him, showers always helped Harry relieve the pounding headache and stress of the night before and the day to come
should be good right?
Harry was going to push back on the comment but he remembered the plan
He springs up from the dream, panting heavily stretching out his arm onto the drawer against his bed and searching in it, for once not waking up for a hangover potion but for his wand - still heavy breathing he grabs it and casts a lumos trying to see where it's coming from
merlin this wouldn't be easy
putting a hand in his jean pocket and swiping the car the gates began to lift slowly with a nice flow as Harry stepped in and looked and the sight he was facing
"But Robards flooed me at about 5 in the bloody morning waking up Hermione and the kids to say there's been about fifty reports in of some posh purebloods being illegal potion smugglers - or something along the lines of that" he said stressfully running his hand through his hair
smelling the donuts and coffee as he passed the loud cafeteria that he hates, but merlin he would like to stop in for a coffee he thought - not the greatest idea when your boss is not in the mood for you
Since the death of Lucius, Draco suddenly became extraordinarily quiet. But, unlike the start of the year, he was now surrounded by an air of gloom instead of stifling caution. Harry, Ron, and Hermione repeatedly attempted to cheer him up but they soon realised their effort was quite counterproductive as it only forced Draco to fake uncharacteristic cheerfulness around them, which seemingly drained him a lot. In the end, they let him be.
