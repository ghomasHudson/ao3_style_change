And Harry definitely understood it, he gave it a few more moments of tongue fucking, squeezed Draco’s arse and bit at the bubbly flesh, then his cock slammed all the way in again, making Draco scream.
He didn’t want to be the liability to Potter, and this was his last resort. But then again, he really did want to see Potter again, and there were so many things in his life he hadn’t done yet, so many things he wasn’t ready to let go.
Draco’s heart tensed a little when Pansy asked the man what he did for a living. The man answered he worked as a bartender at a club, and Pansy reached to pull out the crimson silk tie the man was wearing: ‘That, my dear, is a hundred Galleon tie, and a colour I know for a fact Draco would never buy for his boyfriend. If you really just work at a club, you wouldn’t be able to afford it.’
The glamour of the man really was incredibly detailed. Down to the lightning scar, and the scar on the back of his hand. And very authentic too. He could recognise that ugly scribble of Potter’s anywhere.
He lowered his head, trying to conceal his reaction, but Potter had of course caught on to it, and narrowed his eyes: ‘As pretty as you are, Malfoy, I’ll still punish you if you are being a bad boy.’
Potter wasn’t trying to avoid crossing the wounds, just landing the whip all over Draco’s chest, stomach, back and thighs. The whip marks grew on Draco’s alabaster skin like branches of thorns, winding his lean body, showing it off in sacrificial beauty, as if the golden canary trapped in a rose bush.
That sounds really like some excuse to break up with Draco. Draco’s hands clenched into fists, he looked up at Potter, and Potter quickly added: ‘Sorry. I wasn’t clear —— after… after things go back to normal… well, not exactly normal, but it used to be, or something, I would like to ask you to give me a chance to start over, to explain, apologise, and to date you properly ——you don’t have to decide now! And I fully understand if you decide, then I wasn’t the right one for you.’
The pain seemed subsided at the spell, all that’s left it’s just a faint ring of redness. Potter closed his eyes and bit down on his lips for a moment, then answered: ‘It’s alright. It’s nothing —— just something confidential.’
‘No! Please I…’ Draco was so close, he looked back with glossy eyes only to see Harry smiled devilishly then put his mouth back on Draco’s hole.
It took a while for Draco to see the snitch, but after a few turns, Potter and he were neck to neck chasing right after it.
‘Because it’s easier than dogs, no need to walk them, and you kind of seem like a cat person.’ Potter said, ‘Kind of need a pet since the French minister’s wife liked her pets so much.’
‘Watch your mouth Malfoy.’ The man slapped his arse, but said with a smile, ‘Actually, the beating part is on you. You are the one wanted to be punished, no? I have a few Galleons in my vault to prove that. I only delivered what you desired. Taking care of you, as per your protest, is my doing. I’m not saying I don’t enjoy playing with you, Morgana as my witness I do. I love carrying out my carefully designed plans, seeing the swelling and the redness, hearing the sounds you make, knowing I caused it. I enjoy the power and control I have over you, but only because you let me have them, so I know I’m not a monster. Not…’
He was wearing a red plaid shirt and a pair of worn-out jeans, his athletic form vaguely showing through the rather nerdy outfit, and there’s something really cute about the way his head leaned on the couch, tilted and placid.
But just inches away, he could see the rage in Potter’s eyes smouldering, and the joy of winning was quickly forgotten. Only now did he realise how much trouble he was in. He had honey-trapped Potter, but more importantly, he had risked his safety. It seemed to happen a lot today, as he was subconsciously seeking thrill and maybe harm himself. If he learned anything by now, was that Potter would make him pay for that, and he flinched and looked away under Potter’s gaze.
Draco felt rebellious at Potter’s words for just a moment, before the cane came down harder than before right over his sit spot and shattered his resistance. He jumped and his hands reached for his arse instinctively, he couldn’t actually reach because of the handcuffs, but Potter brought the cane down on his hands lightly, just enough to prickle and startle Draco into clenching his hands, and warned coldly: ‘If this were your attitude of atonement, you can just get up and leave.’
Potter had used him, but that was it; he had came in his own hand, denying Draco the treat. And the first thing Potter did after hydrating Draco was summon a bit gag with a thin and soft bit and a leather mask that covered half of Draco’s face, and spelled it on. He gave Draco the ring from the set, put it on Draco’s index finger after some hesitation with the rather big emerald on the inside, then traced his finger along the strips of the bit gag, making sure Draco wouldn’t really be hurt, and explained: ‘Since you think communication was a bad idea, I’m taking your ability to communicate from you, and see if that changes your mind. Of course, at any point, you can still break the contract, just turn the ring, and all the restraints will be released.’
The man was amused, as it seemed that no matter how hard Draco was punished, and how sincere he was when he apologised, that unyielding attitude always return the second the punishments were over. That was actually something he enjoys — a rebellious sub. Always more fun than the meek obedient ones or the eager-to-please ones. He always enjoyed the process of educating and wrestling the rebellious smart ones. Sometimes he would let a few small mistakes slide, knowing that they would spiral into bigger mistakes that he could have more fun with.
‘You are a wizard. Cast a warming spell.’ Draco said, his posture rigid, he bit his lip before looking to Potter and asked: ‘Why?’
Draco yelped as he felt stinging in both palms, he knew it’s Potter punishing him for not following his order immediately. He knew he probably only had a few seconds at most to decide whether he was going to comply like Potter taught him, or was he going to fight Potter every step of the way. He had wanted Potter to suffer a little, burn in the fire of jealousy and endure the frustration of being pushed down into a disadvantaged position. But it wasn’t his intention to humiliate Potter. Potter probably didn’t care, but how he behaved would reflect on Potter as a Dom, and though he wanted to mess with Potter, Draco didn’t want Potter taken lightly as a Dom, because he really was a good Dom.
Bright red stripes stood out in contrast to his pale skin tone and the pink shade of his arse, swelling up to the point of painful stretch, threatening to break. But the sight was again incredibly beautiful, as he was so terrified and determined at the same time. Cowardly brave. And that made the man’s cool green eyes warm just a little.
Draco refused to do so. His senses had come back to him by now. He knew what he did to Longbottom was not right. And he knew Weasley was an honourable man despite the fact he had quite a few shortcomings. He did a bad thing calling him the weasel. Something a bully would do. Something he had sworn to himself that he would never do again. He couldn’t look up at the man, couldn’t handle Potter’s anger or disappointment right now. It would be too much for him. He kind of wish the man would just push him down and, he didn’t know, scold him, and whip him bloody or something.
If Pansy hadn’t flipped when Draco asked her to transfigure his uncomfortable hospital slippers into fluffy bunny slippers after she cut the apple into bunnies, with the way father had been acting and everything, Draco would doubt that he had actually died and gone to heaven.
Potter swung his arm, and the first strike landed across Draco’s chest, it stung like a lick of fire, raising a long, bright red welt. Draco groaned, and the beautiful muscles of his body strained at that, he struggled to hold still, unable even to notice that Potter had walked behind him until the next strike landed across his back.
‘He’s really a family man now. Remind me to send some diapers later.’ Draco sighed, ‘He picked a name for the unfortunate little menace yet?’
‘Use mine?’ Harry said as he picked up one and tossed it to Malfoy after casting a bubble charm around their work station to avoid cross contamination, ‘I already extracted it anyway.’
‘Merlin this is really difficult, way more than the normal events I attend. I really don’t know how you could do so well with these kinds of events.’ Potter said as he downed his glass, ‘And I got declined by your bartender when I asked for apple juice. But, I could use the alcohol.’
Luckily for Draco, Potter was more embarrassed and awkward than he was. Draco immediately felt more confident seeing Potter looking at him nervously through his thick eyelashes.
Draco looked back up before he thought Potter could spot him, but the switch still landed on his back: ‘Again Malfoy? You know, I would really like to reward you rather than punish you.’
‘You want me to fuck you?’ He said as he raised himself back up, pushed a stray strand from Draco’s face.
‘Then why are you keep framing these as questions?’ Pansy said as she pushed Draco’s hair behind his ear, holding Draco’s gaze as she said, she was rarely this gentle, but she could be a very good friend when she wanted to be, ‘You are a Slytherin, and a Malfoy, when are you ever against the spotlight or the fame? You loved it. You live by it. Anyone who can deal with it, it’s you. I only wonder why Potter didn’t hire you as his publicist or something a decade ago. You are not someone who can’t handle a high profile relationship. That is not why you broke up with Potter.’
‘Um, yeah, okay.’ The man said as he scrambled his pocket for his wand and cast the spell, his face shifting back to that of James Evans, ‘Sorry your birthday went like that.’
‘Er, good for him.’ Draco couldn’t think of why Luna would talk to him about Potter’s desire at fatherhood, but then again, nothing the girl said ever made any sense, so he’s just rolling with it, ‘He shouldn’t. As long as he devotes time and care, he should make a great father.Some things are just out of his hands. People who love him would understand.’
‘I took it a little too far. If you want to be able to sleep tonight and walk tomorrow —— it’s six o’clock now so maybe sleep this morning and walk this afternoon, I need to heal you a little.’ When the man spoke, it was about something unrelated, and as Draco didn’t protest, he held Draco close and chanted a spell, something ancient and powerful, all that’s left behind was the most pleasant amount of reminder for Draco.
‘Well, you almost stopped my heart. And your punishment is not over yet. It seems I let you off too easy last time, and I’m not making that mistake again —— I distinctly remember you saying you have some free time after the Yule Ball, so you are staying with me. You will have your reminder spanking after breakfast and before bedtime; hopefully, this time, you will learn.’ Draco blushed at that, but the man squeezed his arse to get his attention back, ‘But that’s not what I want to talk about.’
He was eager for more, and the man wasn’t petty. He drew his cock along Draco’s tongue a few times, then pushed into Draco’s mouth as far as Draco could take. Draco was never the one that liked getting on his knees when he was with other people, he had his practice, but it didn’t make him good at it. The man, of course, was special. Draco didn’t mind at all, if not too willing. He took as much as two third of the man’s cock into his mouth, before the man could see he was struggling with it, and drew out a little to give him room to breath before thrusting in again. The man was patient and composed as ever, as if it weren’t his cock in Draco’s mouth, just methodically forcing his cock deeper and deeper into Draco’s throat until Draco’s eyes teared up and he was finally able to take the full length of the man into his mouth.
One look at Weasley, Draco knew Weasley was thinking the same thing as he was: What the hell was he doing here?!
They focused on the parts of the wedding, talked about whether they want muggle pictures or magic pictures taken, how Potter wanted Ron to wear something similar to what Sirius was wearing, and teased Draco about he should wear a veil so Potter could lift it and kiss him under it. Draco, of course, smacked him for it.
The fact that this dungeon was a product of such high level magic was surprising, but reasonable. Clientele of this place and the nature of the activities taking part here required some caution. The man pinched Draco’s waist at the cursing: ‘Watch your mouth.’
Draco couldn’t believe it. But Forgecount had already cast a binding spell, and began pulling Draco to the hallway.
‘A golden snitch is worth one hundred and fifty points.’ Potter said coldly, ‘Apparently that was worth your health and safety.’
‘It seems I have indeed spoiled you.’ Potter said coldly, the whip broke the air with a loud crack, ‘Strip, or else.’
Then they breached the clouds, and was high in the deep blue sky, and the hippogriff finally started a smooth flight.
Draco said as he floated the chair, then dropped it, floated it again, then dropped it again. Again and again, the chair crashed into the floor of the courtroom; the horrifying sound bounced off the walls scratched at people’s ears.
‘Again and there will be extra punishment.’ Potter said as he pinched and kneaded the cheek, he just slapped.
Needless to say, there’s not much room to avoid overlap, and Draco had long slim hands with no redundant fat, so the ruler stung really bad, and easily made Draco’s palms burn red and swell up. Draco teared up at the first strike, reflectively took his hands back at the third, the man scolded him and started the counting from the beginning, but it was too painful, and Draco took his hands back at the first strike, tears fell, and he refused to stretch out his hands again.
Draco held it for a second, leaned down and gave it a shaky kiss, then dropped it on the ground and stomped on it.
Draco only realised it was the set of golden snitch accessories Potter gave him as Christmas present after he opened it.
Although the other two kidnappers were covering their face, Draco could tell the second kidnapper was looking at Crabbe angrily, but he eventually gave in.
‘We thank him for the event today, and we get a peek at how he sees the world: ministry officials serve and not above us, the house you sorted to shouldn’t hinder the development of a friendship or the success in the future career of your choosing. I had heard that the discrimination against some houses stopped, only to be replaced by discrimination against another. Headmistress McGonagall, of course, had dealt with that issue, but it pains me to see the same mistake made by me, personally, being made again. Wise men before us must have known the dispute between the houses was dangerous, so his house and mine were paired in all the classes, but we didn’t understand, just took it as an opportunity to rival each other in almost everything. Many blamed him for it, and he blamed himself, but I hold myself every bit accountable as he was. I believe it was my hope, as well as his, that as we move on, we walk the right path this time.’
It’s not below father. Or, he should have seen it coming. Father had been nice, too nice. It was to paralyse and ambush Draco. If father really asked him out of the blue, he would only have two choices: either randomly pick out a witch and get engaged, or make a scene and be a disgrace to his family.
Potter adjusted the length of the chain to a point Draco couldn’t straighten his back; it put a subtle strain on his arms that Draco knew is going to make the punishment harder as it proceeds. A cold leather paddle of Potter’s choosing drew a line up Draco’s leg, over his back, then under his chin, lifting his head. Draco didn’t look up, and heard Potter say: ‘I see you’ve learned. Now you may look at me.’
! She was muggle-born! How the hell was I supposed to know her maiden name?! My parents didn’t talk about her
Draco smiled, he wanted to reach behind his head and pull him into a kiss, but he was too tired and fell asleep right there.
‘Harry Potter, you are the stupidest fucking person alive!’ Draco didn’t know if he was yelling or crying, ‘Why would you do that? You’ll die, you’ll fucking die!’
He was beautiful like that, perfectly compliant and willing, his rosy arsehole blossoming just a bit between those pale, plump cheeks.
He said as he took one of Draco’s hand in his, played it, then kissed the back of Draco’s middle finger: ‘I could use a good prosecutor. If you ever consider a career change. The money won’t be as good.’
The man gently combed his fingers through the hair on Draco’s temple and asked hoarsely: ‘Would you like to do a scene now?’
Apparently, the beast was having a blast, as he then soared back into the sky, Draco almost fell off if Potter hadn’t caught him in time then switched places with him and helped him sit sidesaddle with that seeker reflex and strength of his, and held Draco in front of him with one strong arm and the harness in the other hand. Draco’s arse was still quite painful to sit on, and he couldn’t support himself with his legs anymore, so he had no choice but to cling to Potter tight with arms around Potter’s neck and face half-hidden in his shoulder. He could feel every strong muscle and their movements in the position, and every warm breath Potter took was right down his sensitive ear and neck.
The lights in Crabbe’s eyes flickered at his words; Draco could tell that despite everything, despite the desperation that Crabbe was calling a life didn’t have much to offer, he didn’t want to die.
‘Yes, sir.’ Draco sobbed as the man’s finger carefully rubbed his prostate, Draco was so sensitive that he was desperate to come again, his hands wrinkled Potter’s robe.
Draco cried out in pain and frustration, his body was still aroused, but was denied its release, never so clear did Draco feel he was something that existed solely to please Potter. There was so much pleasure, but his pleasure didn’t matter, what aroused him most was the pleasure he was giving Potter, and that he should devote all his effort to do, he pushed back for every thrust, tightening his hole to please.
‘No.’ Draco said, his voice broken and shaking, he blinked, and a tear fell from the tip of his long eyelashes to the back of Potter’s hand, ‘Finish it.’
‘Why?’ The man was surprised, ‘Sounds like she was a really close friend of yours. Really cared for you. And I wouldn’t put calling stripers beyond her. You might have a lot to lose.’
Then Draco remembered. The man had an abused childhood. According to what he said, he had to stay with that horrible family till his legal age. Hogwarts probably served as a safe haven for him, the first place he ever felt safe and free. It’s quite understandable why he would choose to set up his temporary bedroom as so. And Draco realised something, his eyes went wide: ‘
He held the man’s gaze, silver eyes looking closely at him, and the man looked back with ease, emerald eyes gentle and soft, laced with something complicated that Draco couldn’t tell: ‘Of course.’
famous man of the wizarding world, and it didn’t help he was young and handsome. Half of their year had a crush on him. It’s no different than fantasising a movie star except they studied together every day. Draco’s pretty sure that Astoria Greengrass used to have a crush on Potter and it didn’t stop her from being happily married to Theodore Nott.
This time, he was generous, aiming at the Omega's prostate. The Omega was already fucked for long hours without a release, and the scents of a strong Alpha like Harry was aphrodisiac for him; it wasn't long before that soul-sucking little hole was clenching down on Harry, the balls drawn up pleading for a release.
‘Who?’ Draco was getting irritated at the pain of sitting on the hardwood chair. He was only half listening to the man.
‘Um… not exactly.’ The man said, looking uncomfortable, ‘I wouldn’t be able to tell you if you are not on the security details of the memorial, but I guess I can now. Let’s just say… Mr. Potter always takes the most dangerous route himself, Hermione wasn’t exactly happy but conceded and calls it a double bluff. And if it’s really dangerous, like the Yule Ball, he would refuse to have doubles arranged against all suggestions from the Auror department and his security team.’
Understanding as ever, the man didn’t say anything until Draco said with a smothered voice: ‘The Ministry… I can’t explain. I got caught up in something, and they ceased everything I own until their search was done. Sorry I couldn’t bring the dress. I really liked it.’
The man looked in the same direction and laughed: ‘No. Those weren’t mine. This used to be Dudley’s toy room before I moved in. Petunia tried to move all of his old toys into my cupboard but failed. So a few of them stayed with me.’
Before Draco said anything, Potter spoke quietly: ‘Sorry about last time. I’m just… really bad at trying to connect to you. I just hope I haven’t completely screwed up our friendship?’
After a catching up with Goyle and Millicent, they got their own carriage to deal with the crying baby Vincent, Pansy and Blaise went to bang in their own carriage, just when Draco thought it might be a good idea to have some fun with the man themselves, he heard someone knocking and apologising to each carriage, and the annoying voice of Ronald Weasley: ‘How are we going to find… what do you mean by we’ll find him when we find
The belt already carried a good bite when the man wrapped it around his hand to shorten it. He couldn’t begin to imagine how painful it would be to be hit by the belt buckle. Not to mention, the man was awfully little when this all happened.
Draco looked up and into the kidnapper’s eyes as the kidnapper said: ‘Isn’t that why he would suddenly took an interest in you? You had always been one of his favourites. His power is growing back, and breaking the poor barrier of Harry. Isn’t that why you served him, Malfoy, because he had always been your true master?’
It was at the night Potter got appointed; Draco had a feeling Potter was coming, so he took a long relaxing shower and put on a burgundy coloured silk robe. Before he was able to still that bottle of wine, his doorbell rang, and he wasn’t surprised to see a shy and tipsy Potter at his door.
He was afraid of the upcoming punishment, shaking a little as the position put quite some strain on his limbs, trying to even his breathing. When Potter’s hand landed, it wasn’t a slap, but a gentle touch, the pads of his fingers dragging over Draco’s reddened skin carefully. Draco realised he was inspecting the ten harsher wounds, making sure Draco could take his punishment.
Potter really shouldn’t be holding any weight, not even that of his own body, so they flipped on the small bed, Draco straddling Potter’s thighs.
Maybe he was tipsy; maybe he was overwhelmed by an aroused Draco in his arms, the man apparated them to somewhere behind a hydrangea bush and under a window, with Draco on top of him.
Draco sighed and slipped off the man’s lap; the man gave him an apologetic look and opened the door. The man and woman outside the door were wearing masks, the man the mask of a wizard chess King and the woman wizard chess Queen, but there’s no doubt they are Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger judging by the red hair and brown curls.
They rolled to the floor with the man on top of him, his cock abused Draco’s prostate as his hands brutally squeezed his reddened chubby arse and skillfully stroked Draco’s cock, as Draco was screaming and cumming, he saw
Potter’s eyes didn’t so much as ripple: ‘I would like to formally apologise for that too, as I haven’t got around to it even though years had passed. This is my mistake, and we will talk about it later.’
Draco arched a brow, and Harry explained: ‘It was the insolation hold on the cup. It’s like a keycard; if you have it, the door leads you somewhere else.’
‘Oh please, I’m rather pricy. Mrs. Keepin would never give him that kind of gold to throw around. And however much influence she has of the judicial system, he could hardly use it for personal vendetta.’ Draco could feel his fingers trembling, so he hid them under the table, and he managed to keep his expression wry.
Draco bit down on his lip. This really is a bad idea. But when he found out about this dungeon, he just couldn’t resist.
George Weasley was also one of the happiest men in the crowd, probably because it had been a while since he was so happy. Draco had seen him hugging Potter —— himself quite ruined with green paint that you would think he’s a Slytherin —— before he left the auditorium and saying something that looked a lot like ‘thank you’.
What he and the man had wasn’t much, but weirdly, he trusted him. And he felt good enough about himself to face a terrifying demon in his memory.
The man let Draco sat uneasily for a while before laying down the documents and patting his thigh. Draco climbed onto them happily.
‘Ah,’ the man tilted his head, his fringe shifted a little, making his lightning scar visible: ‘…James.’ he said, ‘The name is James.’
Draco got his Slytherin seeker gear and ran towards the Gryffindor locker room. He got there right on time, as the man just stripped to his underwear and starting to put on the Gryffindor seeker gear. It was a delicious view. Draco missed the striptease, but had his fun covertly strip teasing the man to the point the man chastised him smiling: ‘If you give me a hard time putting on my cup Malfoy, I will make it difficult for you to sit on the broom.’
The Ten-year Memorial of the War of Hogwarts was of course, very difficult to plan. Draco made quite a few drafts before he decided on a masquerade, inspired by the man actually.
But. No one said being loved by Draco Malfoy was a flat road to happiness. He’s going to torture Potter just a little bit more.
That night, he went to have a drink, and as soon as he walked in, his eyes were drawn to a seat across from the pub——Potter.
Harry really wasn’t that good at potions, and he wasn’t interested in sabotaging Malfoy’s grade——or couldn’t resist free-riding, depends on how one looked at it, so he mostly just sat back and watch Malfoy do the heavy lifting.
He took a moment, just standing right where he was, then quietly walked up to it, one direct of his finger and the invisibility cloak hung by to give them a bit of privacy, then he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and began slowly wiping off the cum from the arse.
‘Yeah well, you would be the mother of two kids now if you took my advice in fourth year.’ Draco felt his heart warm up but said with a teasing tone, throwing the tie back.
Really. It wasn’t like Potter was trying very hard to hide who he was. Draco could recognise him when his face was barely recognisable as a face; he wasn’t fooling anyone saying he couldn’t recognise Potter when he was using his own face. He just didn’t want to admit, so he didn’t have to lose the best thing that’s ever happened. Draco only had himself to blame, and he was angry at himself, for being such a coward, and for after all this, his heart was aching so bad, still longing for Potter.
As always, the man controlled his emotions impressively well. He didn’t say anything, just took his time with Draco, put Draco over his knees, using his hand till Draco was sobbing and writhing on his lap, and admitted he had lied. Only then did he take out the hardwood paddle Draco had familirised himself with in the last two days, spanked Draco’s arse thoroughly till it glowed bright red. By then Draco was outright crying.
The second time Harry came across the Omega on the wall, he was out just after curfew, therefore the first one there.
‘I’m glad that we are here,’ It took him a while to say as he kissed Draco, ‘But somehow… I feel like I’ll always find my way to you, regardless. And please don’t feel bad just because I know you love me. It’s probably the best thing that’s ever given to me in my life, and you definitely shouldn’t feel bad when I love you as much, if not more.’
She looked good today, wearing her hair in a loose braid, and her face somehow had a rosy glow. When Harry went to sit by her side, Ron was busy filling her plate, and she was laughing, telling Ron she couldn't possibly eat that much.
The man stepped on Draco’s left shoulder until Draco slowly fell back and lied on his side, then moved his foot to Draco’s cock, treading lightly to make Draco moan and nudged Draco’s tight balls with his toes to torture him some more. Finally, he satisfied himself and said with a wicked smile: ‘Touch yourself.’
Draco yelped but didn’t stop snickering: ‘You don’t need to be so devoted to your job. That’s the exact replica of the Gryffindor dorm.’
Slytherins don’t respond to the true love conquers all bullshit. But strategy and advantage? They made sense. Now he had the chance of a lifetime to be with the man he desired for years, a chance he thought he would never have. One thing he knew he would never do again, no matter how Gryffindor that sounded, was to run away from who he really was, and who he wanted to be. If Potter was what he wanted, well, he just had to have it.
She snapped her fingers, made the decision for Draco and told the caterer the brand of champagne and wine they would use.
Potter listened to his words quietly and carefully, and when Draco finished, he walked back up to Draco, and stretched out his hand.
He opened the window and saw the old paper crane, looked down just in time to see Potter transforming back from his black wolf animagus form, the Malfoy crest still between his canine teeth——must be how he managed to slip back in.
‘Yes. It brought back some good memories.’ Potter looked at him, ‘It must not have been easy for you.’
Potter didn’t answer at first, his emerald eyes shimmering in the dark, then he said: ‘I remember you crying you almost lost your arm in third year. I thought… I thought you would need a lot of comfort and have a lot to complain about.’
‘Did you like them?’ Harry asked, grabbing the arse, ‘Did they remind you of me, of our night? Did you like wearing my mark, so everyone would know you are mine? Knowing I would be so pleased when I find out?’
‘Don’t be.’ The man’s voice still light, then he smiled a sarcastic bittersweet smile, ‘At least one other person was no smarter than you were. I’m pretty sure
Harry stilled at the use of his first name, then skillfully stuck the tip of his tongue into the opening of his urethra, giving it a tactical flick and Draco came again, white fireworks went off that he couldn’t think or move for a moment.
There’s just no way Potter should have so much influence over him, not when he’s so happily in love with James.
‘All I’m saying, is you seem like a changed man, Malfoy.’ Potter wasn’t affected by the appearance Draco put on, as if those emerald eyes could easily see through him, ‘You didn’t base your decision on profit, or the preservation of yourself. It would take a remarkably brave man to risk themselves for others.’
It’s actually weird because Draco couldn’t remember the last time he opened a door since he started officially dating Harry. And once he did, he saw a small room with four booths within, all with a wooden table and cream coloured couches.
To be honest, it’s the only thing he had been thinking about, really, the only thing that helped him through the pain. He tried to remember details about Potter, how his eyelashes draped over his emerald eyes when he was shy, the shade of his blush, the way he always smiled when he was truly happy, with that little dimple by his lips.
‘So what you are saying, is that I’m practically Gryffindor now?’ Draco sneered, ‘That’s hardly a compliment.’
'Great, actually.' Hermione couldn't help but smile at that, 'She's finally out of her dormant state, grew to stage two.'
‘I er…’ Draco took a deep breath and tried to pass it off, ‘I wanted to apologise for last time. You helped me out, but I was… I was ungrateful. I’m sorry.’
‘And you.’ He said, ‘I was not a likable child, I knew that. But you, you stood up for everybody but me. You didn’t say a damn word when Weasel laughed at my name.’
He was definitely in some dungeon, not the fun kind, bound tight to a chair, also not the fun kind, and his arse was killing him. He would even give his wand back if the kidnapper just let him cast a few cushioning charms.
The Omega complied, and Harry pulled himself out to get a better look, watched as the Omega used his right hand to reach down and grab his cock, to stroke it hard and fast. It was an extremely obscene sight, dark pink pretty cock fucked in and out of his pale hand, glistening in the moonlight. The Omega was desperate for his orgasm, but it’s clear that he’s not going to be able to reach it without Harry’s scents attacking him and his cock up his arse. Harry could see the starved little hole twitching and spasming as the itch he was unable to scratch grew more and more insufferable, if he could hear the Omega, he would surely be sobbing and begging right now, his arse writhing and trembling on the wall, begging wordlessly to be fucked.
This was a particularly difficult chapter for me, and it took me a long time to try to get it right. I hope you guys will stay with me for the future chapters.
And he didn’t want to think about the similar fantasy of his own, how sometimes, involuntarily, he would look at his wand and think about it was hold and cared for by Potter.
Draco picked up the delicate narcissus flower hair ring, smiled as it slowly dangled its petals, rolling the diamond dew: ‘I might just do that.’
Hermione pulled her lips tight, but Ron squeezed her hand and answered for her: ‘Thank you professor.’
He tried not to sound like he was about to cry, but he doubted he was successful. He just wanted to stop thinking. Stop having to decide his next move, his next word, his next step, because he felt he was drowning in despair, no matter what he did, there was just no way out of this.
‘Yes. Why?’ The man seemed confused, but he soon understood what Draco was concerned about, and he smiled a little, mostly because he really was fine and wanted to comfort Draco, ‘Yes. I’m alright. I overcame my psychological problem about it a long time ago. Actually, I first came to understand my desire as a Dom when I was about fifteen. I didn’t have any experience, couldn’t get any proper sexual education or find any how to guide, and Hogwarts didn’t have internet, so my fantasy worked with what I knew. Belt. It was where I started. Besides, belting for fun or pain play is greatly different from violence.’
Draco must have given him a frightened look as Potter couldn’t help but smiled a little before he continued: ‘It is also my rule that all added punishment would not be canceled or postponed to a next appointment. But I had a feeling you wouldn’t be able to take too much, so I didn’t specify how you should take your punishment. I have decided that I will punish you by my hand.’
He couldn’t answer at first, just watched as Potter tilted the bottle back with a delicious blush on his cheeks.
Draco didn’t notice the tempted darkness in the man’s eyes. He was too focused on the guilt that was about to swallow him whole, shaking as he felt chilled to the bones. To him, this was supposed to be punishment. When he hired the dom, it wasn’t to satisfy any sexual needs or actualise any sexual fantasies. It was for the sole purpose of punishment, with the hand of a professional. He did this to relieve some of his guilt, and that’s already despicable. And now this.
He remembered the boy testified at his trial——rather gaunt as the War was still eating at him, the black robe looked like a leaf of sail on him. Still, his back was straight; emerald eyes were bright and calm, every word he said was from a strong heart, a young man determined to lead the world on a new hopeful path of redemption, rebuilding, and a better future.
He said as he summoned one of the balls and put it in Draco’s hand, and Draco saw it —— a white-haired Harry, his face marked by time but no less handsome, wearing an elegant charcoal grey suit, holding a ridiculously large bouquet of red rose in his arm, and he was smiling and leaning in to… to kiss Draco.
The man laughed a little, his hands moving back down, pushed the blankets aside, and used a different potion that resembles essential oil and heats after massaging to relieve the soreness of Draco’s back and legs, taking extra time with Draco’s mile-long alabaster legs, especially the inner thighs: ‘That’s why your grade always came up second? That’s almost cheating.’
The second kidnapper wanted to cast more Crucios, but Crabbe stopped him; the kidnapper said almost frantically: ‘They already figured out he was missing, we need to know where Potter is fast.’
Potter was only too happy to comply, this time indulging Draco to come as many times as he could, and frankly, Draco’s second orgasm was so close to the third they could be just one, but then it would be an incredibly long orgasm, and he shot an insane amount of cum.
Draco wanted to get out of the uniform. He didn’t care if he would be naked. He would feel a lot less ashamed that way. He tried to compose himself, but was unsuccessful, and pleaded: ‘Please I…’
By then Draco’s arse was a beautiful and painful rosy red, swollen up and radiating heat. His face was kind of a mess too, wet by tears and flushed, but there’s something about Draco that always made him look more beautiful when he was vulnerable, makes the man torn between protecting him and ruining him.
Many thanks to Mika Toshino for proofreading and answering my questions about corsage for me. Real angel.
Draco was terrified, he even tried to fight, Potter couldn’t be that much stronger than him, but he was much more tactical, soon Draco had both of his arms twisted behind his back, held there easily by Potter’s left hand, both of his legs kept loosely under Potter’s right leg, and his arse raised high on the left.
The man with his childhood rival’s face was watching him strip, and that naturally makes each moment long and a torture. But he was wearing too much and clothes too fine to strip fast. He untied his tie, took off his dark grey robe, and went on to unbutton his waist coat and shirt, and paused.
Draco caught the tie and laughed, then she looked serious: ‘I just got someone reminded me how important it was, to be honest to oneself and the one you love. I know things are complicated, and we may very well screw up what we have and get our heartbroken if we try to love… But, there’s always risks in life. So, Blaise and I are dating now.’
Neville, as the herbology professor working at Hogwarts, was his inside man. As Draco stepped through the floo, Neville asked: ‘That’s all of them, you sure?’
Draco bit his lip a little to stop himself from moaning, the man finished his checking, tapped his arse lightly and said: ‘We need to talk.’
The man’s eyes darkened, but smiled: Theoretically, yes. However, I would only suggest that if you were able to handle me. And frankly, I doubt your ability.’
Draco couldn’t help but shudder as the man’s word sent fear and excitement down his spine, he clenched his teeth and nodded again. This time, the man said: ‘I don’t like repeating myself, and would appreciate you responding to my questions with clear answers, as a show of respect. And I would like you to refer me as “sir” when you are in this club and not in a scene. Let’s try this again. Was I clear about the age limitation?’
Only at the beginning, and only when he was playing the role of himself, was Potter this strict with him.
, aiming to use minimum magic to form the strongest restraint. When cast by a regular Auror, even Grindelwald couldn’t break free immediately. The only reason you broke it so easily was because I didn’t use much magic with it.’
He suddenly realised he was losing the grip on the fact that the man was just a glamour he hired. The real Potter probably still see him as the person he was before, and hate him as much as before.
He’s just the right amount of Gryffindor, brave, honest and sincere, but also the right amount of Slytherin, as part of him —— probably unconscious, but nonetheless part of him knows that’s the exact leverage Draco need to feel comfortable with him, that he was forever at fault, forever at a disadvantage, forever in Draco’s debt.
Potter’s finger rubbed Draco’s prostate in circles, and Draco came down Potter’s throat, screaming. But Potter wasn’t finished, he didn’t even stop for a second, just licked at Draco’s cock and balls, added another finger and fucked Draco through his refractory period, so hard that Draco could feel part of his leather glove fucking in and out of his rim. The intense sensation was both extremely pleasant that made Draco melt and too forceful that Draco wanted to escape, and Draco was crying out and begging for mercy. Soon Draco was hard again, and Potter went back to work. Gently this time, building up the pleasure, milking Draco for another orgasm.
The way Draco said it, playful and seductive, Potter arched a brow as he knew what Draco was getting at. He gets down on one knee anyway, looking a bit ridiculous in the hospital gown, but also good in a way it shouldn’t have been possible. He put Draco’s fluffy bunny slippers on, pulled Draco to stand, and traced the tip of his nose along Draco’s cock.
‘I’m glad you like the treacle tart.’ Draco said the first thing that came to his mind. Probably the stupidest thing in his life. It might just be Potter’s excuse, but treacle tart was Potter’s favourite dessert, everyone knew that. Thinking about it, maybe he subconsciously hired Grinchy specially for Potter.
For a second, he felt quite ridiculous, as people in this room were probably all obsessed with Potter in some way, and almost all the Potters were chased after like flowers that attracted bees, but none was wise enough to see the real diamond when it was just right in front of their eyes.
‘Listen.’ Draco said through gritted teeth, ‘I was drunk. Maybe I did got that tracking powder on Potter, but I sure as hell wasn’t working with any psychopaths. At the very least, in order to do that, I would have to have a way to contact them, no? Unless you found any evidence of that, I’m walking out of here.’
‘So you didn’t knock me into the walls then, did you?’ the man said coldly, and Draco immediately trembled a little as if cold under his stern looks, all resistance left him when he heard Potter’s words. Potter waved his wand and a rough cleaning spell scoured over him, leather shackles from the ground came up and locked around his ankles, another set of handcuffs from the wall held his hands behind his back, holding him firmly in place.
‘Oh, I guess that’s your prostate.’ Potter’s finger drew back and forth a few times, and the ball followed the motion of his finger, screwing over the point ruthlessly.
Of course, the man was very caring. Later, he carefully rubbed salve over Draco’s palm; he even blew lightly at Draco’s palm as he complained they felt like burning. Maybe it was the mentha spicata in the salve; the light blowing did make it feel cooler. And the man’s gentle, staid and serious profile in the warm yellow bedside lamp light moved Draco’s heart just a little.
Draco had a bad feeling about where this conversation might go, but he was rather sore, and his clothes were proper therefore needed a while to put on; there’s no avoiding the conversation, so he went along: ‘What do you mean.’
Mother had always been too spoiling; she used to cry over his broken knee sooner than he did. It was her way of overcompensating for father’s distant and abusive parenting. Frankly, it’s a bit embarrassing to watch her cry and listen to her cooing over him, but it’s nice to see her face and hear her voice after brushing over Death’s shoulder.
‘I need…’ Potter leaned back on the kitchen island and knocked open the tap, the sound of water flowing filled the kitchen, he startled as the cold water wet half of his arm, but then he wiped that cold, wet hand over his face again, then said, ‘You can’t marry me, because you love me? I don’t…I don’t see why that’s the reason…’
Rosier almost failed to proceed, but quickly schooled himself and said to Potter: ‘Get into the circle —— Your hands. I almost forgot. I know how good you are at wandless magic. They must go first.’
Potter paused, then answered: ‘Three. Before that was a healing spell, then another floating spell.’
And he remembered. This must be why he was being punished. Because he disobeyed Potter’s order to use the salve. He didn’t take good care of his toy. And the Dom wouldn’t tolerate that.
Despite his love and respect for his father, Draco couldn’t be so blind to say Lucius Malfoy did a spectacular job at parenting. He spoiled Draco, gave him everything Galleons can buy, but also terrorised Draco. Somehow Draco couldn’t blame him, because Lucius Malfoy was once the Malfoy heir just like he was, and someone else broke him, drilled family honour and bloodism into him —— as did the Malfoy before him, and the Malfoy before him. He couldn’t exactly pinpoint where the Malfoy family went wrong, but what Lucius Malfoy did to Draco was what he believed to be the best for Draco, and at some point it became Draco’s own responsibility to find out and walk on the right path of his life.
Draco blamed his second loss on his still sore arse —— the man spent most of his other spare time disciplining Draco, put Draco over his lap or on any surface convenient whenever Draco misbehaved, Draco’s arse was red and sore almost all the time.
‘Thank you.’ Draco said and decided not to push their luck; he proceeded to pull the man out when he passed over Dumbledore, he hesitated and said quietly, ‘I’m sorry. Sorry that… I interrupted, and disturbed you.’
‘So you don’t appreciate a bed?’ Potter arched a brow, ‘Would you rather it be an empty classroom, or you prefer the hallway? Should have known you were an exhibitionist Malfoy. Always made our little affair so public.’
interaction, where you be loud, know each other’s skeletons in the closet but never use it against them, and get firecalled to the next life-threatening adventure.
Draco suddenly looked to Potter, his silver eyes wide——Potter really was flirting with him. He never thought this would be happening.
I don’t think Harry was abusive, I think it’s just how a Dom kind of have to do when dealing with a bratty sub with this kind of psychological problems. Of course, how he reacted wasn’t perfect.
Although——Harry just regarded how the old Alpha saw himself as a joke. Although Ron had given Hermione his collar and claimed her as his wife, Hermione was impregnated before her collaring ceremony. If someone was really old school, they would harshly criticise Hermione for her breach of purity, which Slughorn had no intention to do. It’s not that Harry supported the old moral traditions, but he despise Slughorn’s flexibility, boarder line arse kissing when it comes to the so-called war heroes.
At that, Draco could feel himself boiling. It’s so much more embarrassing to face what he had done when he was no longer angry. He wanted to smother Potter with his pillow or something, but that would just embarrass himself further.
Spitting out the bad taste, Draco could barely hang himself by the arm of the chair by now, but he smiled: ‘You know, Millicent gave Goyle a son. He named him Vincent.’
Harry chuckled, left the swollen pink nipple and kissed further down to Draco’s groin, nudged at Draco’s hard cock with his cheek, giving it a few dirty teasing licks as he answered: ‘I’ve been told I would end up in a juvenile borstal institution. In fact, that’s what they told other people after I went to Hogwarts. But, pretty thing, you haven’t seen half of it yet.’
There’s one person the fake Forgecount had little chance of fooling no matter how little words Crabbe said, and someone had to cast this Auror restraining spell; Crabbe couldn’t just magically learn the spell by posing as Forgecount. There had to be another mole inside the department.
‘Yes.’ But Potter answered him, ‘I wasn’t there during the attack. From what I heard, they played late that night; the attackers probably waited till everyone went to sleep to attack, but had set off the ward and were noticed immediately. They used the defense set up at the burrow for me and fought them, no one was hurt, and they managed to catch a few attackers. Unfortunately, their leader got away. The few got arrested said the leader always had a mask on, and couldn’t identify him.’
A perfect family with the perfect girl, living up to his parents legacy and expectations of the Wizarding world.
A little talk after the safe word was used, with the happy ending of oral and masturbation. Draco got cleaned up and was allowed to stay over.
‘Then, why didn’t you?’ Draco cast a repellent spell, and Potter stumbled back, his hand nursing over his chest where the spell hit, ‘Is it so hard to just say “Hi. Sorry but I’m Harry fucking Potter”?’
‘Mr. Malfoy.’ the man said with a dominating tone that snapped Draco out of the easy-going image and his brief trance, and as if he knew what was on Draco’s mind, he explained, ‘You requested your Dom in the appearance of Harry Potter, to best serve our clients’ fantasies, we always wear our glamour from the beginning. Although it is unclear what your request of the age or other specifics are of me, so I took the liberty to use the glamour of Mr. Potter’s current age and the attire of my own selection. Will this suffice for today’s purpose of negotiation, or would you like me to adjust?’
Back then, it was just for fun. Who the fuck would have known Tom Riddle was really going to rise from the dead and came back full-blown psychotic? Despite everything father said, part of him didn’t care about anything political, and somehow, he always thought Potter would squash all conspiracy of Voldemort like he had been doing for years. He was used to running his mouth to push Potter’s buttons, not caring that Potter always wins in the end. Part of him even liked that Potter always bested him, and the other part, of course, was forever defiant.
The truth was he hadn't seen Ron and Hermione much lately, as they have been busy with both taking different classes for their N.E.W.T.s and the pregnancy. Fetuses of the Wizarding world didn't just grow with the Omega's nutrients, but also the scents and magic provided by the Alpha; otherwise, there's a chance they would miscarriage or become squibs. Hermione and Ron had missed the beginning of the pregnancy due to life-threatening situations, fortunately, as Hermione was a strong Omega, the fetus had gone dormant, and they had been visiting St. Mangos quite often to go through other magical procedures to supply magic to their child.
Harry, just to be cruel, pried one hand off. The hand was pliant in his hand, let him stroke and squeeze, only tightened suddenly when Harry laced their fingers.
happen to me.’ Draco draped his own eyelashes over his eyes, ‘Because I don’t think I can handle it if I ever lose it.’
Draco immediately felt naughty, he would toe off his shoe, but the man was sitting right next to him, so he settled for holding the man’s gaze and bit his fork, swirled his tongue a little, showing the pink tip of his tongue for just a moment, obscure enough neither Pansy nor Blaise picked up on it, but he knew the man would pick up on it, and yes, his eyes darkened at that.
Draco looked from the note to the dress, couldn’t help but ran his hand over the glimmering material.
After the kiss, Draco smiled through his tears and stroked Potter’s cheek: ‘Don’t you ever scare me again.’
‘And here’s another one from… James?’ Mother said, ‘I’ve never heard of him. A new friend of yours, Draco?’
Draco’s heart leapt, he tilted his head slowly and saw it was Potter’s cufflink, an exquisite golden snitch with his initials ‘H•P’ engraved on it. Being left behind, the cufflink was flapping its wings anxiously, knocking into the wine glass, making little ringing sounds.
It was a shockingly beautiful room, dark, but there must be millions of soft globes of lights in it, floating around freely, giving out a warm light yellow glow. Draco held his breath for a moment, and walked in. As soon as he walked in, some of the fluffy globes floated over, and as if recognised him, some danced around him, and others landed on him.
Draco rolled his eyes but transformed a handkerchief into a rope ladder and threw it over his window.
It was rather well-known that the Slytherin House had a wall of sluts back in the days. As an unmarked Omega can only be impregnated by the strongest Alpha, in ancient times, some Sire would let the Alphas take turns with the Omega to ensure a stronger offspring, marrying off the Omega of the family to the strongest Alpha only. Said tradition, of course, failed after the rising value of purity of the Omegas. The Slytherin wall of sluts started then with a bet between the brats from pureblood families; they would ‘persuade’ an Omega to go on the wall, take turns with them and get them pregnant, the Alpha of the child, as the winner of the game, would be admitted as the strongest Alpha and win a handsome amount of Galleons. It didn't always end well for the Omegas. Some got the wealth, status and better offspring as they wanted, but others, as they were soiled, being married as the wife of the Alpha was not an option; they were taken as concubines or even slaves, with their child as their only hope. Some were even forced to get an abortion and given compensation to the family instead, ending up in brothels or places even worse.
‘Once a slut always a slut, Potter——Good luck with that.’ Malfoy said as he quickly collected his things, submitted the vial and left.
When he did, he abruptly grabbed Draco’s hair and stood up, fucking into Draco’s mouth hard. Draco could hardly breath, he had to hold on to the rope that strung him up to stay in the place, but still he felt faint at the strong and graceful moves.
‘That’s a rather big mistake, even for you, Potter.’ Draco teased, ‘That’s going to be seen as rude at my birthday party. I thought I taught you better.’
‘A heavy, antique, engraved chaise you mean.’ Draco said, pulling his own chair from behind the table, ‘Would it be possible that all those confusing floating spells were used for something like this.’
Draco did as he was told, raised his arse up high, parted his arse cheeks and revealed his bright pink, shining wet hole, then felt Harry’s heavy cock line up, with no further preparation or lubricant. Draco panicked for a moment and felt Harry holding him down by the back of his neck: ‘Easy my pet; we have been playing for a while now, you must know you can take me right? Don’t you want a little pain? To feel me splitting you open, even days after? And you know I want it, I want to feel your tight virgin hole sucking my cock, even in pain, because that’s how good you are as my bitch, no?’
Draco pulled his perfect fake smile and teased: ‘So you are telling me, if I pay enough, I could have all the Potters?’
But his wrist suddenly burned bright red and Potter quickly grabbed his forearm and gasped in pain, a ring of thread-like magic appeared around his wrist, and it was searing into his flesh as if red hot iron.
The man paused, and smiled at Draco shyly, his emerald eyes sparkling like sunshine dancing on a creek: ‘It’s a date then. I mean —— not a ‘date’ date. But I’m impersonating as your date.’
‘He’s saying what I am thinking at the moment.’ Potter pointed a finger to his temple, to prove his point, he spoke in synchronise with Lee: ‘“The two had played against each other for several times, and indeed presented us with fine games. However, Harry had always won by close calls. Will Harry continue his history of triumph, or will Malfoy be able to get his first win?” —— Not really all my words but it’s fun imagining how Lee would exaggerate it.’
Potter was ruthless, by strike seven, Draco was outright crying, tears tainting his face, the cute little pucker deep pink and swollen, but he didn’t dare let go of his hands, just writhed in the pain and burning desire, and he was begging: ‘Seven! I’m sorry… please, I promise I won’t disobey you again —— Thank you…sir……’
‘What.’ Father said. The word rolled off his tongue condescendingly, a clear and frightening threat.
It was incredibly beautiful, him offering the most vulnerable part of his body so compliantly, in such a lewd position —— back bent backwards to a beautiful curve, long, lean arms stretched behind, legs parted wide and arse raised to the highest. Every angle and curve were to perfection as if a swan chained to the ground.
‘Were you following me Malfoy?’ Said the young voice of Potter’s, with suppressed anger, irritation and just a tad bit of amusement.
Draco’s handwriting was trained by his father’s cane. He could write beautifully with his eyes closed or half asleep, proven by the nights before deadlines back in Hogwarts. Except from needing his wand to repair the scratch on the parchment, he did his lines perfectly.
Part of him wanted to be there for Potter, but Ziegler made it clear she will snitch on Draco, skipping breakfast, skipping addressing his wounds and leaving the bed against her medical advice if that ever happens. It wasn’t much of a threat, really, but it was the excuse Draco needed to follow her medical advice. And, of course, part of him wanted Potter to come to him first.
Draco invited him to sit down and talk for a while, and the man sat quite rigidly, carefully kept his distance and fidgeting the coffee cup while he listened and answered Draco’s questions.
He came in the door right after Draco managed to take a seat at the couch and pretended he had been here for a while. The man smiled a little and apologised: ‘Sorry. Today is exceptionally busy for the club —— we are holding a “Potter’s night”. They were debating whether we should have a display of an orgy of a few Potters, and whether the customers could join if they pay enough.’
Hannah looked like she’s about to pass out, and Neville quickly held her, apologised and excused themselves.
They talked about a few things that night, and that became the breaking of an invisible dam between them. They talked about something everyday. It was weird, really, because their conversation either told Draco something he had already guessed about Potter or made him acknowledge something he didn’t want to admit about Potter.
‘Oh, relax.’ Draco complained, ‘It’s not like I don’t know you and Blaise fuck every chance you get.’
Draco could see the answer coming; he felt disgusted and terrified as he heard the kidnapper say: ‘Because it’s not him at all. It was the soul of our Lord seeping through.’
But Potter stopped at that, just holding Draco’s cock loosely in his mouth driving Draco mad, and looked up at Draco with his emerald eyes. When Draco didn’t respond, he gave a small lick like a cute puppy, and Draco knows exactly what treat he was asking for: ‘Fine. I guess I should treat you better when you have my cock in your mouth —— Harry, alright?’
‘Your place.’ Draco said with definite, ‘You’ve already been inside mine and it’s only fair you let me see yours.’
The red ring of magic burned at Potter’s wrist again, and he knelt down at the pain, losing his grip on Draco.
Harry thrust lightly through Draco’s orgasm, pulled out as their orgasm fully subsided. A bit of cum leaked with his motion of pulling out, shining the evil pearlescent glisten at the swollen red pucker. It was pretty, and somehow delicious.
‘Sounds like it went well.’ Potter smiled, giving up on getting that sobering potion, just squeezing onto the bed to hold Draco better.
Going to the wall once was an accident, twice was a coincidence, but the third? The fourth? Harry couldn’t just lie to himself and say it wasn’t intentional. After the fourth time he fucked the Omega, he held that pale hand in his and asked: ‘I know you won’t be rutting, but will you come back tomorrow, just for me?’
‘By telling me about your slut on the side?’ Malfoy was acerbic, ‘Brilliant. I don’t suppose you want me to join you on your fuck party?’
The man was biting back a laugh, only let on a warm smile, reached for Draco’s hair and ruffled it. Draco was even more angry at this point: grabbing his hair or combing through his hair with fingers was one thing, ruffling them and making a mess was another. He valued his hair. However, the way he looked up angrily at the man only reminded the man of an arrogant and spoiled cat, and was also quite pretty as he was naked, kneeling, with tears in his eyes and a fierce blush on his cheeks. He looked… lively. Contrary to the lifeless fake perfect he tried to pull or the pale solitary that leaks through the mask.
The curtain of Potter’s apartment wasn’t drawn, but it’s not like anyone could see them, since Potter’s apartment occupied the highest floor around the neighbourhood; the full moon looked as if it were framed by the window, silver light flowed into the room like water, poured on Potter’s naked glory on the bed.
Neville laughed as the man discreetly ran his hand over Draco’s still sore arse before pulling Draco into his embrace and warned: ‘
Part of the reason Draco didn’t go back in was he would have no reason to stay so close to Potter’s patronus. He knew the patronus couldn’t possibly be tangible and warm, but it was so comfortable that he didn’t want to move.
Draco just nodded. Potter stroked his hair twice before he left to get ready, and returned quickly with a crystal plug from the set: ‘Might not be entirely appropriate, same with the ring, but I don’t want to use anything less on you —— assume your position for me?’
Potter was also a bit quiet today, dealing with his wounds as gently and carefully as possible like last time. Somehow, the silence wasn’t as pleasant as the man seemed to want it to be.
! Such a pretty red. Maybe Potter should keep it that way. That’s the only time that naughty pet of his is obedient.’
Draco’s heart… let’s say shuddered at that. Then he got even angrier, as that bastard had the balls to look hurt after everything he did.
The sound of discussion was through the roof, but father was furious, he was not going to tolerate being challenged: ‘Move away Mr. Potter. This is family business. I am aware that you are my son’s boy toy, but that doesn’t give you any say in this.’
They had just got back from Draco’s bachelor’s party. Frankly, it was a disaster, Draco spent most of the evening fighting off the strippers Pansy hired, but all his friends had a lot of fun teasing him about marrying Potter, his childhood enemy and the Saviour.
Just get on with it for fuck’s sake! Draco shouted internally, but kept his mouth shut, settling with giving Potter a irritated look.
And he finally figured out why those silver balls looked so familiar. They were made the same way the golden snitches were made. With even more sophistication, one could say. Potter, as the first man whoever touched the balls, he had full control over them. With a snap of his fingers, Potter made the balls stick together, and sitting on the broom would make them sink deeper into him and right against his prostate. He had to alternate between hanging by his arms and sitting on the broom. Two minutes and he was almost desperate for release, but Potter had locked his magic around his cock, forbidding just that.
Potter didn’t say anything, just landed the next strike. Draco broke out a sob at that, braced himself till his knuckles were white while trying to relax as best as he could, and bore the full three strikes following it.
Draco’s eyes shot up, and those emerald eyes were waiting for him, they were shining in uncertainty but still deadly: ‘I wanted to tell you, for Merlin knows how many times, but each time I do, there’s something to stop me, your allergy, a life-threatening situation, a case made me doubt if I really understand what love is, if I’m capable of love, of making you happy… I wanted to be absolutely sure when I tell you, but then…you said Slytherins don’t do love.’
‘Not exactly.’ The man said, ‘Men or women, these concepts meant very little to me. Most social conventions did. I only care about their souls, if that’s the right word for it. Male, female or transgender or anything in between, I don’t have a preference. I believe they recently defined this as pansexual.’
Draco had rejected the man kissing him before. But that was mostly he didn’t want to admit to the man or himself that he liked the owner of that face a little too much. It wasn’t that he didn’t want the man to kiss him, or that he didn’t want to kiss him —— Merlin knows he wants to. Normally Draco wouldn’t care about kissing anyone, he couldn’t even remember most of the people he kissed, but kissing the man felt too intimate, too much, yet why, Draco didn’t know.
‘We are here today to remember the past. So the past is not forgotten, so the mistakes of the past shall not be committed again.’
‘That’s probably true.’ Potter said, taking off his belt, ‘But talking like that is just going to make things harder for you.’
Draco hesitated a moment before heading in, facing the man’s questioning look, he said: ‘Not… Mr. Malfoy. Just… Malfoy. He always called me that.’
Draco could hardly feel his physical pain right now. Potter was coming. To the Yule Ball he was planning. He never came to any of the Yule Balls before. That must be why the Aurors were so…
Draco just looked up, straight at him, his eyes defiant: ‘I will not. If that’s the condition of you seeing me as your son, I wave my right of succession.’
‘Then I would like you to strip before you enter the room.’ the man said casually, pointing to a low cabinet with a wand case on it by the entrance, ‘And do remember to refer me as sir. You will earn extra punishment for disrespecting me.’
Potter wasn’t provoked, just said calmly: ‘Since you came back, I want to start with apologising again for keeping you in the dark. Whatever reason I have, I hurt you deeply, that is inexcusable. However, I do believe our conversation was left unfinished last time, and no matter where our conversation leads to, we still need to talk.’
‘So early in the morning? It’s barely ten o’clock.’ Draco whined, ‘And I can’t just go talk to my boyfriend about my crush.’
Draco’s body tensed at the mention of the stage, and by the time Potter finished, his hands which he hid in his pockets were trembling a bit.
In the dungeon, the man always made it clear where the boundaries were, enter a door and Draco should be naked and on his knees and things like that. Here, Draco was not sure.
It was the first time Draco was ever fucked, he had always imagined he would be too sore for anymore after it, especially as Harry fucked him so hard, but it just felt it didn’t get enough, it wasn’t satisfied.
The paddling extended to Draco’s thigh, right where any bit lower would hurt too much. Draco wasn’t really complaining, as he knew Potter did so to avoid overlapping as much as possible. He still wasn’t very fond of canes, and taking it on already spanked arse was a first to him.
‘I… wanted you to take control.’ Draco eventually answered, ‘I don’t know what to do with the mess; I just wanted to show you how hurt I was, wanted to act out my anger, to… to hurt you. But I don’t want to ruin us; I just want to show you how I felt and get past it, so we could… Did I screw up, Potter? Merlin, I really don’t know how to deal with…’
She cast a privacy and shielding charm first —— though Draco suspected that shield couldn’t even stand against Potter’s
Indeed there were quite a few Aurors who weren’t exactly team Draco, but they were mostly people with a strong sense of morality and hero complex; there’s no reason to kidnap Draco out of the blue —— unless they bought the crap Witch Weekly sold and was strongly against Potter proposing Draco. It’s much more likely Draco got snatched by the mole who tracked Potter and attacked the burrow.
Because he was her boss. Because he paid her good money. Because Thanksgiving was not a mandatory holiday.
The man looked up at Draco, his eyes bright and smiling, but he tone hesitant: ‘I’m flattered? You don’t um, you don’t think very highly of Potter’s flying?’
‘About life and death, and for others, not when it comes to love and ourselves. You should see what Ron was like when he wouldn’t confess his love for Hermione, and that was after six years of friendship under life-threatening situations with no rivalry past. And what he was like before he asked her to marry him after years of a solid relationship.’ Potter said, his emerald eyes glistening, ‘You were my obsession, have always been a mystery to me, and no doubt by now, the love of my life. I was… I was scared. I should have told you this a long time ago——I love you, hopefully even after I greet death as an old friend.’
‘Into the circle.’ Rosier demanded, and Potter did, leaving a trail of blood as he walked into the circle.
‘No, I’m not the kind to share.’ Harry leaned on his hand under his chin, watching Malfoy with his gleaming emerald eyes.
‘I see you finally remembered.’ Potter said slowly, one wave of his wand and the chain slowly released to lower Draco into his embrace.
‘Yeah well, she was tough and mean to others, but all bark and no bite when it comes to people she really cared about.’ Draco shrugged, ‘It’s just that she and Blaise have been doing this dance for years. They were both crazy about each other, but too proud to say anything about it. They would fuck every time Pansy comes back or Blaise visits Paris, and pretend it doesn’t mean anything. Neither was brave enough to offer to move to the other’s city. And every time they want to see each other, they always drag me along as cover. Pansy’s birthday was January the 1st, and she always drags us to the New Year’s count down, pretending everyone was cheering for her birthday. You don’t know what it feels like to third-wheel those two fuckers, listening to them testing whether the other was screwing someone else, pretending not to understand they're flirting, or seeing them sweet in love. And they have the gut to tease me for being single,
The man, on the other hand, enjoyed Draco’s poor attempt at pretending as he was obviously awake as he had a fierce blush of embarrassment on those pale cheeks. His green eyes watched Draco getting dressed as if a wolf sizing up his pray, enjoying the view of Draco’s deliciously red arse.
‘Oh.’ The man also understood immediately, held the folder closer to himself, then he said, ‘About that, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about Draco’s clearance…’
He looked at it for a long time before he schooled himself and went to get his mother. She needed to know what was about to happen.
‘I got an offer today to plan the ten-year memorial of the war of Hogwarts, that’s like… I don’t know. Everyone wants to plan it to make a name of themselves, and there’s that sentiment…’ Draco rubbed at his temple, ‘I’m not sure I can do it. When I asked why me, they told me because Potter had a high evaluation for the Yule Ball I planned, and he completely trusts me with his security details. That’s just him. He didn’t really need to do anything, just one wrong word and the whole world would move to try to cater to him.’
He was silent for a while, then he covered his face with both hands: ‘Oh fuck. I’m drunk. I…wait. Um. You love me. You just said…Merlin, you just said you…love me.’
Someone got a picture of Potter kneeling in front of Draco in pain. But the picture was taken from a long distance away, of very bad quality, with branches and bushes shielding them, making it impossible to see Potter’s painful expression or Draco’s angry expression, the only thing one could tell from the picture was that Potter was kneeling on one knee in front of Draco.
She was afraid to ask for a day off, because he wasn’t a nice man, more so maybe, as he was extra moody lately.
‘It’s just an installed glamour.’ The man explained to Draco, ‘If you get on the stages you’ll find you can walk through everyone. But I shall say, the experience is authentic —— except for all the glamour of audiences and players are above the legal age and we removed the faculty stage because it’s too much of a buzz kill.’
The man also laughed, his emerald eyes discreetly yet wolfishly taking in Draco’s features as he laughed: ‘That’s ten extra punishment for you Malfoy.’
Together they ran to the third floor, the man pulled Draco into one of the boxes where they can have a direct line of sight to the stage, waved his wand, activated the spells installed, switched the glass window into a one-way mirror and muted the box both ways.
After a few seconds of rest, Draco used the last bit of his magic to free Forgecount, threw a few healing spells his way, and since there’s no way they can apparate out of here with only one working wand, he summoned Potter’s broken wand in the hope of repairing it, but no luck.
Thursday half rained half snowed in a very annoying way. Regardless, Draco had to go to the venue he booked for the Yule Ball, the Carmen Finca, yet all magical ways onto the property were forbidden before the Yule Ball for security reasons. He had to walk a considerable distance to get there in the icy rain. All the warming and drying charms he casted didn’t feel effective at all.
A door appeared on the wall near an Andrew’s Cross in the playroom to reveal that Gryffindor dorm room: ‘We can get to this room any number of ways. It’s a room I kept as constant for myself to rest or stay the night. You are the first person ever there.’
He took a deep breathe, letting out the air shakily, and said: ‘No. Please — I would take my punishment, sir.’
The wall pulled to both sides elegantly like the curtain of an opera, revealing a spiral of staircase leading downward.
Before the pain fully subsided, came the next strike, moving upwards. And then the next. Pain rained down on him, and he couldn’t help but groaned and tried to avoid it.
Potter stopped at that, kissed the back of Draco’s head, waited till Draco’s cry died down, and went back to paddling.
A truly noble, and determined man. No fame, fortune or power could waver his heart, not even a little. Sometimes when Draco remembered his slander behind Potter’s back and vile words said right to Potter’s face, he wondered how he could be so blind. How he wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole.
‘I’m not sure what you want, so I made a little of everything.’ The man said, ‘Eat whatever you want, I’ll have the rest.’
‘Well, you should have told me you wanted to come.’ The man said tentatively and a bit awkwardly, ‘I think I was just here… when I was gone earlier. I… Mr. Potter wanted to pay his respect to Dumbledore.’
It was then Draco finally realised that he wasn’t in a room of torture, but more like a office, with a large carved wooden table and chair placed in front of a bookshelf, across from a set of sofas and coffee table. The man was half-sitting on the table with his long lean legs folded at his sock-clad ankle, gesturing towards the sofa that is directly across from him with a long roll of parchment that Draco recognised as submitted by himself a few days ago: ‘This may take a while, as I see there are some blanks left on your contract, in addition to the confirmation we usually have to make.’
Who did Potter think he is? Something novelty plaything he could just screw? Draco’s face flushed red, and he said angrily: ‘I don’t know what you are talking about.’
He then tilted his head, taking a moment as if admiring the view: ‘You do look exceptionally good on your knees. Maybe you should do that more often.’
Draco screamed: ‘Ah! Eight, please! I’m sorry……Please it hurts so much…Ahhh! Nine, Potter! Please, please I’m sorry……Thank you, sir…Please Potter, I…’
Draco’s cheek was burning from the slap and pinch, he bit the inside of his cheek at the word, knowing Potter was reminding him if he decides not to take the punishment, their relationship would be over.
‘I’ll take that as a compliment.’ Draco felt his ears burning, ‘And I’ll be the prettiest thing you’ll ever see on their knees.’
But Draco could see he was getting pale; his left hand was bleeding a lot faster than his right. Potter tried an
Indeed the man was looking at him. Not that he’s not focusing on the game, and not just checking to see if Draco had found the snitch, but he was attracted to Draco. The way Draco handled the broom, he could be a medieval knight in silver armor on a white horse. And something was really suggestive with him having a broom between his legs and in his hands. Even more tempting when he was in full Quidditch gear than when he was naked.
Ok. He wouldn’t. But that spoke to how much he would like them right now. He really shouldn’t skip addressing his abused arse so that he could keep Potter’s mark on him longer. He’s pretty sure Potter wouldn’t force him to sit on his sore arse for such a long time.
‘Please, Draco.’ Potter took one step closer, not caring Draco’s wand was digging into his chest, ‘Can we please talk about this? I… I wanted to tell you. I tried to tell you. But you didn’t…’
‘Every word and more.’ Potter said, then laughed a little, ‘Sorry about the fireworks though. Probably gave you some trouble.’
‘You know how the ministry was like. They probably just didn’t want to take the responsibility of its escape, so they faked paperwork about its death. We were surprised when we heard Buckbeak was officially dead.’ Potter shrugged and smiled, somehow, he looked nostalgic and sad, ‘We had a hell of a night, but we managed to save him —— come on. Take a bow.’
He couldn't care less about Diggory. He wasn't even sure if 'Diggory' had one g or two when he was making the badges for Merlin's sake, and he certainly did not go to Diggory and show him what he had done. All he cared about was Potter. He might as well have just printed 'I have the biggest fucking crush in the entire history of Hogwarts on Harry Potter' on the badges. It was so fucking obvious. And he made sure everyone at Hogwarts knew about his grand gesture. He couldn't get anymore public than that.
‘Aha!’ She said triumphantly, jumped on Draco’s bed, abandoning Draco immediately, ‘That is why you broke up with Potter. Because you don’t think it will end well, so you bailed before it actually went bad. So what, you can be the one that got away, and you will always be the perfect man Potter can’t get?’
But it was then he suddenly realised something. As if the silver ball inside his arsehole suddenly weighted a little more, or maybe just shifted slightly as it slipped on cum. Its presence was suddenly very distinct, making Draco very aware that he was walking with Potter, with the man’s cum and the silver ball in his red, swollen arse.
This time something changed. Each strike felt like the last strike he could take, so painful that he was almost screaming, but as soon as it passed, somehow he felt so much pleasure that he couldn’t stop even though he was in so much pain, just hoping, even begging for the next strike.
That provoked Draco. He was flushed to the tip of his ears, and he shouted: ‘You are just taking it out on me because you lost! You don’t want to go through with the bet, is that it? You — sadistic ——
Soon the students rushed in, Slughorn dragged himself in the last second, and began his boring lecture: ‘Today we will be doing——Ms. Granger, Mr. Weasley, I believe you are familiar with it——the substitute potion for the magic and pheromones of the Alpha. As heartbreaking as it is, it’s a real possibility that an Alpha may decease or fell ill during an Omega’s pregnancy, thus unable to provide magic and scents for the pregnant Omega, or in some rare situations, like in Ms. Granger’s state, the body of a strong Omega decided the Alpha was strong enough to have an offspring with, but the current situation is not the best for bearing the child, they dormant the fetus, and the potion can help bring the fetus out of its dormant state with minimal stress on both the Alpha and the Omega.’
‘Oh, I’m sure he will love it.’ Pansy said sarcastically, taking a big gulp, ‘And I need this because you barged in early in the morning and scared me half to death ——
Draco could feel Potter was furious, normally he wouldn’t dare to challenge Potter again, but he was watched, by the entire school for Merlin’s sake, he couldn’t just yield, and after a few warming spanks, Potter started to unfasten Draco’s belt, Draco panicked and struggled fiercely: ‘No! Potter, Don’t you dare…’
‘Really? I can’t remember a thing about him from that time.’ Draco was intrigued, ‘How did you know him?’
The fake Potter went away. Draco slipped to the floor and ran his hand over his face. He felt weird talking to the fake Potter from room 7. Something just didn’t sit right.
Draco went weak at his knees and had to sit down and clad his hand over his mouth to stop himself from moaning. It was arousing, but it was also annoyingly unsatisfactory, as the balls were too small to tip him over the edge.
Draco recognised that rat-eyed man as Bard Keepin, only son of the Keepin family. The man had a notorious reputation as a misogynistic womanizer, committed quite a few shady acts and hid behind the prestigious family name, exactly like his father. If it wasn’t for his mother, Mrs. Keepin’s hard work recent years since her husband passed away, the Keepin family wouldn’t have its status today. The old lady however, was too spoiling when it comes to her only child.
Apparently, the man didn’t abide by stealing —— Draco would say pranking, at worst it's taking other people’s things without asking for consent’, and it’s not like the man didn’t enjoy thinking about Draco wearing it, or that he wouldn’t like it when he sees Draco wear it. Draco argued his point and got his sentence doubled to twenty strikes —— lightly. But that wasn’t the end of it. The bastard made him kneel back on the ground and stretch out both of his hands for another ten strikes.
Potter shrugged: ‘Her family was broke, he tricked her into marrying him right out of Hogwarts, never worked a day, both parents have a chronic illness, and two children in Hogwarts. I guess it was part of the reason why she couldn’t leave him. She doesn’t even know how to access his vault——’ He leaned in and said the next words close to Draco, his warm breath brushed over the shell of Draco’s ear, ‘I hear you are the best, and I happen to be able to afford you.’
‘You are… so beautiful like this.’ Potter ran a hand over his back, down his thigh, he threw away the broom and wrapped Draco’s legs around his waist, his hot breath tracing down the side of Draco’s neck, the tip of his nose brushing over the straining muscles of Draco’s flushed chest and stomach, almost kissing the red stripes, and Draco was so tempted to look down at him, desperate to the point of pain to see the man’s display of affection. ‘So delicate yet so powerful. In despair yet so resilient. You are the most beautiful creature I’ve ever…’
That shouldn’t have moved Draco’s heart, but it did. He took a deep breath, then bowed. He would have done it gracefully, if he wasn’t pumped full of cum by the man and had a silver ball up his arse, which just happened to shift as he bowed. It was a lousy and shaky bow, but the hippogriff wasn’t picky. It bowed back and lowered his head, motioning for Draco to come closer.
Granger was relieved, then someone called her, so she apologised again and excused herself, motioning to Lovegood to monitor Draco in her place.
Although Draco knew it’s Potter’s fault. They had some weird security arrangement going on, and the man had been called away, disappearing and popping back up all day.
Right. Draco pressed the heel of his hand to his throbbing temple. He was confused. That one at the Yule Ball was the real Potter. This one right here was his Potter.
‘I might… I might not be the right person to…’, and the man was back to his awkward self, blushing as he ran his hand through his messy hair, ‘Merlin I’m so sorry, I totally forgot… I shouldn’t. I really shouldn’t.’
Draco hissed at the pain, but he actually felt better at the man’s answer: ‘Why? You are a great Dom.’
‘Finally! He’s been spoiling that brat for too long. Maybe now Malfoy will finally learn to behave.’
It was a horribly compromising position, as his arse is now up in the air facing Potter, and his cock visibily dangling between his legs. The shackles prevented him from closing his legs, and even though he was in a rather relaxed stance, any wrong move will expose his virgin hole for Potter to see. It was also quite a sight, as the position brings out his long beautiful legs, and made his arse seem perfectly round and plump.
By this point, Draco had already known what warkspurtswere, but what golden arrowbees were, he had no fucking clue.
Draco held the back of the man’s neck, leaned in until they were forehead against forehead, his wand slowly pointed under the man’s chin, then whispered against the man’s lips: ‘Do you trust me?’
Potter looked like he wanted to say something, but no sound came out, he looked down at his hand and sighed. Draco was so embarrassed that he wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole, and he really needed to say something smart to get them out of this awkward situation.
magazines with Potter’s face on the cover hanging around the room——including the one he was fully naked and shot with Buckbeak to raise money for the charity foundation protecting the habitat of hippogriffs, of course, one couldn’t really see his private parts on the shot, but it got a lot of witches and wizards crazy, they had to reprint it three times and eventually had enough money to protect a few other magical beings too, that one had some cake on it——empty butter beers everywhere, and at least a dozen Gryffindors (a few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs too, the Slytherins among their friends were all at Draco’s party. Except for Blaise. He was head over heels for Ginevra and attended Potter’s to be with her. That traitor.) passed out everywhere.
He waited, and as Draco didn’t say anything, he looked up timidly and asked: ‘Does this mean I get to take care of you the rest of my life?’
Draco was shaking, but the man was still speaking. Draco knew from experience the man was able to pick up any changes in him, no matter how little, for the man to overlook his shaking, he must be very distracted: ‘In that case, it is vital to angle one’s body so the belt buckle wouldn’t hit anywhere important.’
‘Go get him, viper.’ She said as she saw the familiar expression of a confident and determined Draco Malfoy.
More than a few times, Harry saw his back hit by hoax stinging hexes, his step halted midway, but he wouldn’t even turn around, just went back to walking with his back straight in textbook manner, as if nothing had happened, while he easily deflected hexes and deducted points when other Slytherins were messed with.
It didn’t exactly hurt very much over the layers of clothes, but Draco felt his face burn up as the entire school was watching Potter spank him, there were already gasps and whistles and chatters as if a beehive was provoked, he jumped and fought to get away as the strong sense of shame hit him: ‘No! Let go of me!’
‘Sorry. I’m drunk. Don’t know what I was thinking.’ Draco tried to sit up, ‘But seriously, what could you be doing wearing that, holding a Weasley’s Christmas theme night?’
Harry couldn't help but chuckled darkly, lowering the platform a bit and stepped on it, pulled out his now fully erect cock and lined himself up, watched in amusement as the Omega shook as if he couldn't decide whether he wants to lean away or push back when he felt the hot head of Harry's cock against his entrance.
Really? Draco looked to the man suspiciously. The tension in his gut that was gone earlier came back again. The man was Gryffindor, seemed close enough with Weasley, Granger and Longbottom. He probably was a member of that Dumbledore’s army or something. And Hannah Abbott doesn’t recognise him?
Potter seductively roamed his hands over Draco’s arse, stroking the pretty pink shade he just painted there, grabbed them in his hands and kneaded and squeezed playfully. Draco was now fully hard, drowning in the man’s attention and caress.
It’s strange to see Potter in such a setting, the dim light danced on his face, but it was as if he was the source of light, sunshine would have radiated from him, and his emerald eyes were like a magnet, once he drawn Draco’s eyes to him, it was impossible to pull away.
‘For the hundredth time, I am not fucking dating Harry fucking Potter!’ Draco yelled to the interview letter sent by Merlin knows what magazine this time, ‘That means I’m neither fucking him nor dating him, clear?’
Draco answered a few questions for the man to show he knew a lot about him so as to convince Pansy they had been dating for a while: both parents deceased, did’t have a good relationship with his foster family, left as soon as he reached legal age, only exchange a few letters with his foster brother who had redeemed. Favorite sport was Quidditch of course, and he enjoyed muggle movies very much.
In the mirror, Draco saw himself in a full white suit; the material and colour complimented his platinum hair and his pale complexion. Pansy was good.
Despite his teasing, Potter was cautious, he combed his fingers through Draco’s hair in soothing motions, and his eyes were soft: ‘What do you want me to do about this?’
‘Anything you would like to say now?’ Potter lifted Draco’s chin, stroking teasingly, ‘No? I guess that’s progress then.’
She might have been tricking him into talking about Potter, the Slytherin she was. But more importantly, she knew him so well. She knew exactly who he always had obsessed with all his life. And of course, he stopped having the latest hot model or athlete on his arm at his birthday parties, right around the time Potter started coming to them. That time they almost got caught by her? It might not just because of luck.
He could see the thin string snap and his father raised his cane, Draco instinctively turned away and raised his arms to block it.
Then the man shifted in his sleep, pulled Draco back against his warmth, and Draco was asleep again.
The position was pulling him tight as a fully drawn bow, showing every muscle line of his body. Having his release denied so many times had put Draco on edge, his entire body shaking, those muscle lines and the red stripes decorating his chest, stomach, back, arse, and thighs fluctuated, dazzling as if the tassels of an erotic dancer. Add that to his ruffled platinum hair, red teary eyes, trembling rosy lips, and desperate, pleading yet forbearance expression, the man felt his blood hot as lava, he took a step forward, giving in to his desire.
Fuck. How was he still this tight. It was like hot, thick velvet, wrapped Harry tight and sucking at him, making Harry's breath shaky. He grabbed the globes of the Omega's arse and started fucking into him.
He had started looking forward to their play dates, he had even slept better, and found himself in a good mood even when the first class in the morning was potions.
‘Aaaaand GOAL!’ Came the recorded voice of Lee Jordan during the past game, ‘Gryffindor is now a hundred and twenty points ahead of Slytherin! Their only chance at winning is catching the snitch!’
‘You gave me too much credit. It was a calculated decision.’ Draco leered at Potter, his rosy lips curled up to a playful smile, ‘Sorry to burst your little bubble but I’m still a Slytherin.’
‘Good boy.’ Potter petted his head, ‘You did very well. Now I’m going to show you… why I like them so much.’
He could tell she didn’t buy his lie, but she tried to look like she did, holding back her tears. She cried for a little bit longer, holding his hand and comforting him with her magic, then she hesitated and said: ‘Your father… he’s… he’s here. I think he would like to talk to you. Do you want to…?’
Draco told her sincerely that she was a great headmaster, her light shone just as bright among her predecessors.
He tried to get away, as having his legs wrapped around Potter in front of the school really wasn’t decent, but Potter didn’t let him go, held Draco very tight as he lowered his broom till he could sit on the broom with his feet on the ground. Without any word, he put Draco over his lap roughly.
It was a full grown man, his frame taller and more filled with muscle than he remembered him to be, showed off elegantly by the cream-colored shirt and matching light grey suit pants and waist coat, yet dangerously seductive, as he wore no tie or cuff links, and let his collar loose and sleeves rolled up to his elbows, his collar bone and the lines of his strong arms were shown, and looked tantalisingly casual; his features more well-defined and somehow handsome in an unassuming way, black hair still untamable, but messy in a different way as if he just got out of bed after splendid sex rather than got up late for class; his expression was light and at ease, in stark contrast to the fact that they are in a dungeon for pain, and making him look even more cute, a bit bookish dorky also, due to those way out of style round-framed glasses.
‘Not that it matters, I’m very happy with James. Happier than I ever thought was possible.’ Draco couldn’t help but smile, then he sighed, ‘But like, the last words I said to Potter, after he got me out of the trouble with Aurors and Azkaban, was “what’s wrong with you”, and he put in a good word for me. Like, seriously what’s wrong with him. I just can’t deal with that man…’
All the revolutions of valuing protocols and changing laws didn’t exactly make Potter the most popular Auror in the department, but Potter was fine with it. Draco suspected that’s why Potter didn’t get promoted to Head Auror, but he got what he wanted——in the special victims unit, he got to lock up sexual predators and domestic violence perpetrators.
‘Not exactly.’ Draco said, pulling his tie loose as he poured himself a cup of water; his cheeks were still rosy from all the alcohol, ‘He was a hatstall. He could have been Slytherin.’
The man apparently, was back to his normal self and picked up on it immediately. He smiled knowingly, taking off his clothes as he went, leaving on only his trousers, sat where he sat earlier when spanking Draco with his legs apart, and demanded: ‘Kneel.’
‘I… Merlin, I —— ’ Draco fell to the ground, everything else was becoming numb, it wasn’t the same as when Potter hated him, when he didn’t see Potter for years, he couldn’t even start to imagine what the world would feel like without Potter, especially now he knew what he could have had, ‘Please don’t die, I love you, please please Harry, I can’t… I can’t…’
Draco whimpered. And Potter let go. The switch landed again. As it was just a thin and light switch, it didn’t cause too much pain, just enough to sting and leave behind a light stripe of red. The first one mostly just caught Draco by surprise. It landed all over him, twenty or maybe thirty strikes, he groaned and gasped, lost count in the process.
He was so terrified that he didn’t see the first strike coming, it landed right in the middle of his arse, and tears welled up in his eyes just the first strike. It was painful, but he could tell Potter was holding back. He knew a grown man with that kind of muscle would be capable of doing much more damage. Draco couldn’t see, but only a light but clear line of pink appeared on his alabaster skin. Suddenly, he wasn’t so afraid. But is was still painful, he could feel his blood rush into the wound, his skin swelling up just a little, stretching to be slightly painful. Such swelling in the eyes of the man almost resembled the blooming of cherry blossoms, and their bright green darkened a shade where Draco couldn’t see.
The third Dom came up —— Draco had flirted with a total of four of them, he’s seriously questioning his judgment right now —— and he picked a cane that was thinner than the first one.
Focus. He thought to himself, took out the memory he boxed in for the man, and opened it as if it were a present, played it as an immersive film.
Draco was tense with fear and rebellion, he didn’t want to move, but the man nudged him with a little smile: ‘Come on, come over.’
Draco was exhausted by now, so the man showered him and addressed his wounds as quickly as possible, put the collar on Draco and settled Draco in the bed. Draco wasn’t sure how he arranged it, but he then went to get breakfast for Draco. After Draco filled himself with French toast, the man helped him brush his teeth, so Draco didn’t need to get out of the bed, then got on the bed and held Draco close, gently playing with Draco’s furry ear.
A Crucio shot from Crabbe’s wand hit Draco’s chest; it didn’t really hurt that bad, so Draco knew Crabbe didn’t really have the heart to hurt him.
Buzz ran through the crowd immediately, everyone was confused, giving him surprised and weird looks. Draco spared a glance at mother, she had a hand pressed over her mouth and tears in her eyes, and Draco knew that even though she didn’t know what father was planning or what Draco was about to do, she knew this would eventually happen. No matter how hard she tried to mediate the differences between the Malfoy father and son, she couldn’t stop her son from becoming the man of his own. And she wasn’t going to.
Then he smiled as the first tear fell: ‘Fuck it. I probably would let you ruin me for anyone else. If that means I can have you for a moment. I probably would seduce you if I ever knew you were interested, convince you it’s just a fling, try to stretch it as long as I could… I would never let you know how I felt, because it felt humiliating just knowing you know I have feelings for you. I probably would never admit it to myself… I couldn’t deny it now. I already told you I love you; I couldn’t lie to myself.’
The only thing he remembered was Harry kissing him on his lips as the first light of dawn shone through, his silhouette golden and magnificent, and smiling in content.
The man pulled him up, and Draco stumbled to stand, grabbing at the blanket to cover himself as the man dragged him through the door. He held Draco’s hand as they went back to room 6. As he was opening the door, he turned back and smiled wickedly at Draco.
Draco clawed at the ugly mark on his forearm, the pain both eased him and made him tremble in ecstasy.
Draco looked over at Granger’s wand point and saw Pansy and Blaise outside the iron gate: ‘I told them to wait outside to preserve the crime scene, had to promise her at least sixteen times I’ll call them as backup if things go south, but they can side-along with you to St. Mangos.’
They won a war, some people celebrate their triumph, but Harry felt different. He didn’t manage to stop discrimination by killing Voldemort; he only changed the subject of discrimination. Every pureblood family and wizard was in fear of the future. The House of Slytherin had only a handful of new students this year, as many begged the sorting hat to be located in anywhere other than Slytherin.
‘What is your real name,’ he repeated, ‘I believe your real name will help me break the fantasy, thus suitable to be my safe word.’
The man didn’t say anything, he just wiped the tears off Draco’s cheeks, and held him against his shoulder. Maybe he didn’t want Draco seeing his expression, Draco was not sure.
‘Physically, it’s mostly fine. I just have to move around carefully, and no heavy lifting for at least three days, but the doctors suggested moving often to regain full function.’ Potter said, moving his arms to show Draco, the beautiful muscles on his arms flexing, ‘Magically, I have a long road of therapy ahead of me, so no wordless wandless spell anytime soon, and a lot of Wingardium Leviosas and Lumos as soon as I get my new wand. But they are positive that I should regain full function before September —— hopefully so, because I’ll be taking McGonagall’s job then. I need to at least best the first years.’
Potter looked at Draco with his eyes shining with mirth, but he schooled his expression to a slight smile: ‘Why would I be.’
Draco avoided the man’s clear green eyes and noticed the impressive bulge between the man’s legs. He couldn’t help but blushed a little, asking: ‘Do you need…?’
That was the last year they were just kids, the greatest worries of their lives were grades and whether their crush would go to the Yule Ball with them. Debatable for Potter, that is. He always had a few life-threatening moments added to those ordinary things, but by this point, it had become commonplace, just another day for him.
The good news was, Draco was kidnapped on his way to work, so if he were lucky, his clever assistant should figure out something was off before noon. Unless she thought he drowned himself in the bottles over his break up with Potter. Or thought he slept in after splendid sex with Potter.
‘Why are you doing this?’ Draco asked, turning to Potter, the lights in his silver eyes quivering, ‘Why are you trusting me, I am the one who got the tracking powder on you. Why did you post my bail, and why are you inviting me into your house? To a walk?’
It felt surreal, as Draco’s warm breath fogged over the glass, blurring Potter’s pretty face and emerald eyes.
He almost kneeled down if he weren’t holding on to the table so hard, so many tears he cried that he felt himself on the verge of dehydrating.
‘Seriously he told you his name was James Evans. There are no lamer aliases than that.’ Pansy smirked.
Draco smiled, but he quickly schooled his expression and tried to look as guilty as possible when Ziegler showed up at the door with both hands on her waist.
Draco’s thoughts strayed away —— He really was very sweet to Draco that night, brutal but paid every care necessary with that magical tongue of his. Later he did clean up, made breakfast, and when Draco complained about being too sore after another round, he gave Draco an oil massage.
He couldn’t believe that he was so blind. Or if he was honest to himself, that he lied to himself for so long. Just like he knew father couldn’t just simply be nice, but he wanted to believe their relationship was getting better, so he lied to himself, he did the same thing with Potter: he wanted to believe the perfect James loved him, so he turned a blind eye to all things screaming at him that he was Potter.
‘Yes.’ Draco said. They walked for a while, then Draco stopped at the back of the castle; a wave of his wand, and a giant glamour dissolved slowly, revealing a smaller stone house right by the castle.
He walked down the stairs, wearing a black robe with golden embroidery of antlers and lilies around the collar and cuffs and down his back, it was the same shade of his hair, and showed off his physique perfectly. Despite the robe being high-end and rather eye-catching to the point of dramatic, Potter managed to look modest and graceful.
Then Draco saw it. A weird curve on Rosier’s cloak, and something there —— a golden arrow, pointing at the familiar handle of Draco’s wand.
‘Who in their right mind would choose Gryffindor? They haven’t won house cup since forever.’ Draco was still talking as the man let him down in the bathtub and gestured him to strip, pouting but he wouldn’t admit, ‘Oh I know, it’s because of Potter isn’t it? You chose Gryffindor because he did.’
There was a suspicious blush on Potter’s cheeks that couldn’t be explained away by the fake ‘Whiskey’ he was holding. Did he just unconsciously flirted with Potter? Merlin no. He needed to stop himself.
Was this what Potter had to deal with? Draco tried to sit upright and thought inappropriately. He probably was the same, acting and talking in ways that contradicted his true thoughts and feelings.
‘Of course.’ Draco honestly didn’t know what all of everything was about, this whole thing with Potter felt absurd and confusing, but he felt better as soon as he thought about James, and hopefully, this would be less confusing, ‘We had just started dating, but… I feel like I know him without needing him to tell me everything. I really like him. He… he might be awkward, not famous or anything, but he’s the right one for me, I… I love him; I really do. I care deeply for him. The world hasn’t been fair to him, and I want to give him everything the world owed him. I wouldn’t trade the world for him.’
Right now, Draco was wearing only his tie, his hands bound and tied to a hook on the ceiling. Potter was cruel enough to hang him high above the ground, and he could only support himself by navigating the broom —— a Nimbus 2000 for Morgana’s sake, where did he even find such an old model?
Draco had never been touched there before, and white-hot sparkles shot up his spine, he almost came but Potter caught his cock in his hand just in time and squeezed firmly, cruelly denying him that: ‘No no, you haven’t earned your treat yet Malfoy.’
‘Sorry.’ The man lowered his head, fell silent for a second, then got up his courage, and said with a blush and suppressed sadness, ‘I’ll have to say… Outside the dungeon, I am awkward. I’ll um; I’ll understand if you decide our relationship should stay in there after today.’
‘Er, it’s a custom, that Dom gives their chosen sub a collar as a gift as a symbol of their claim, the more expensive the collar, the more cherished the sub.’ The man said, smiling nervously, ‘I wanted it to be symbolic, so I had this made for you, costs everything you’ve ever paid me… and then some.’
‘No. I’m sure Christmas at the burrow beats Christmas at the manor any time. Me and Ronald Weasley, I think we settled. I hold nothing against the family’ Draco shrugged, ‘Well, except for
‘That I am.’ Draco said, the world is still a mess and blur to him, ‘But I really need to know how he is.’
The party was a blur, endless flatters and congratulations——after all, he was marrying the hero of the Wizarding World, the would-be minister of magic, the man who had fame and fortune and everything, the golden bachelor for years.
‘I appreciate your concern. I…’ Potter pondered a while, then asked, ‘How do you feel about what madame Ruby said, pet?’
The man actually apparated somewhere and sent Draco to work with a bag of fresh croissants and a cup of coffee, saying: ‘I understand you are an adult with a career to pursue, that means it’s difficult for you to keep a healthy schedule, but I do not appreciate you lying to me. Also, it seems this punishment has put too much strain on your schedule. As much as I don’t like postponing punishments, I think we’ll have to pick it up at your next appointment. By then you will know, I don’t take lying to me lightly.’
Before he could figure out what, the fake Potter was back, he had a mug of hot cocoa in his hands despite Draco’s refusal. Apparently, all Dom’s were mind readers. Even the ones that weren’t authentic enough.
‘When it was with some random model or athlete you were shagging, no. But Potter?! You knew I need to know about that. Not the details, Merlin no. But anything that happens between you and Potter was like, big red flag.’ Pansy said as she gestured with her hands exaggeratedly, almost knocking over her cup of lemonade, ‘Merlin, I should have known once you stopped pulling those models and athletes years ago. Salazar Draco! You were supposed to tell me if
Not one day in Hogwarts did the young Malfoy not groom himself to perfection, never a hair out of place, never a wrinkle on his robe. But right now, he was as disgraceful as can be in that uniform. And he had indeed grown some since Hogwarts, still slim, but plimmed at just the right place, arse and thighs just the way the man liked them, soft and bubbly, long and lean, probably still a regular flyer as per the vaguely visible muscle lines. Somehow, as he forbore his shame and embarrassment to be held down and hold the humiliating position as he was told, the man felt as if he was shoving the Malfoy right now into the Malfoy he was and pulling him down from the altar for him to squeeze and screw however he likes.
Before he left, he walked up and kissed mother on both cheeks, as they both knew he wasn’t coming back to the manor for the night, and probably wouldn’t for a while.
Draco enduring pain was something more beautiful than he could ever imagine it to be, him lying prone on his bed, platinum hair loose and presenting a stark contrast to his red bedsheet, sobbing and apologising… he almost couldn’t resist it, leaned in without thinking to kiss away the tears.
Normally, Draco wouldn’t let anyone near his thoughts. But he was probably the best at Occulmency among living wizards. The man wouldn’t be able to see what he didn’t want the man to see even with the real Legilimency Charm.
As if she felt Harry's gaze, Ginny smiled at him. But that was what was weird, though. Harry used to feel something when he looked at Ginny; he used to like her smile. However, ever since the war, everything was different. Her fiery red hair used to light up his vision, but now, it was covered by a shade of grey like everything else; her floral scent used to make his heart jump, but right now, it was as if his heart was made of stone and struggled just to keep up his usual beat. It had nothing to do with her, Harry knew. It was just that his heart was like the castle, left broken and a ruin after the war, a wasteland of nothingness, he could shout, he could scream, he could try to smash and destroy, but his heart was unmovable, not a ripple could be made.
He looked up to see Potter pulling over a chair to sit in front of him, silently handing him a conjored cup of water, refilling the cup when Draco finished it with a rapid version of his noble manner.
‘What’s so important about why I broke up with Potter?’ Draco was annoyed, ‘We broke up! End of story! What do you expect, a happily ever after?’
He hesitated for a second, and asked quietly: ‘You sure about this? For you, after some point, It will be pure pain.’
Draco’s birthday party was a lot larger than mother initially estimated, as the recent scandal with Potter had made everyone suddenly very interested in coming. If Draco didn’t know better, he would think he cooked up his affair with Potter so the Malfoy family would gain more status, because it’s working like a charm. Though bad press about the Malfoy family was at the uproar, there are also people lining up at the Manor, hoping to get a piece of the glory.
‘Nice view, isn’t it?’ He said as he pushed and pressed Draco to the glass with his weight a bit harshly.
‘Great. That’s very reassuring.’ Draco said, still haven’t recovered from the scare, couldn’t help but sound a little bit sarcastic, but he quickly schooled himself and tried to be nice, ‘How’s um, how’s everything going for you?’
He was good at it as always, but nice and slow tonight, kissing it and caressing it through the clothes, then pulled the fabrics down and licked at it, soaking it to its full erection before taking it into his mouth. The man had an incredibly flexible tongue, and it swirled around Draco’s cock, traced the throbbing veins and thrusted at the leaking hole on top; one flick of his tongue and Draco almost lost it.
‘Father used to use it on me. Whenever I failed to achieve his standards of a Malfoy heir —— which is all the time —— that’s what I’d get.’ He said calmly, trying to seem less affected than he actually was.
Draco talked about what he learned, and needed a little comfort. He managed to get the man talk about himself, but the man cunningly used it against him.
Draco looked up, straight into Pansy’s eyes, his voice calm without any ripple and his eyes cold as frost: ‘If we just met on a case, then yes, I can tell you. But that? You know how things were like back then. What was I supposed to do? You know how things were like back then. Tell people he slept with
Draco hesitated for a second, then the man had his fingers in his platinum hair. For a brief second Draco wondered when the man applied a cleaning charm to his hands, as the fingers in his hair was warm and clean, but the thought was quickly discarded as the conversation they were having was too intense, and the combing motion of the man’s hand too enjoyable: ‘It’s alright if you don’t want to answer.’
His surgery took a total of eight hours; when Ziegler came to Draco, she sighed and said Potter really cut himself deep on his upper arm; they had to repair his magical flow first, then blood vessels, then the tendons and muscles. His right hand was in better condition as it didn’t forcibly use as much magic as his left hand did, while they barely managed to save the magical flow to Potter’s left hand. They had to get Hermione’s help with one of the spells and had to wake Potter up mid-procedure to use his own powerful magic to complete it. Even that, Potter’s going to have a bad scar.
Literally, sitting back and watch, while Malfoy stood there even during the long and boring stilling process.
‘He was a decent flyer. I would have died if he wasn’t… if he didn’t decide to save me.’ Draco watched as the man ran his hand along the wooden handle of the Firebolt at Draco’s words, ‘And Potter did win all the matches, even the tampered ones, so I guess no harm no foul —— except for the one against Diggory. But he totally would have won it if the Dementors didn’t interfere.’
Despite his effort to hold the sound in, Draco moaned, loud. Even louder when Potter curled his finger.
Self-hatred and desperation broke free from his mental walls, swallowing Draco as if flood water, putting him in so much pain as he felt he was deep underwater now, unable to breathe and crushed by the water pressure, he held the man's face in his hands, his tears fell and tainted it —— that beautiful face of Potter's, it was so close yet so far away. The emerald eyes that burned with cold fire of the fourth year Potter and those of the patient and understanding Potter at the Yule Ball merge together and were the colour of the flood that was ravaging his mental world.
‘Godfather.’ Draco said quickly, taking the man’s hand in his, ‘I just want you to know, I think I’m really happy with him.’
‘I saw the warkspurts and golden arrowbees all flying this way, so I came here to check it out.’ The crazy girl said with that daydreaming voice of hers as she pushed up the mask to reveal her face, ‘Of course, it would be you, Draco. Males from your family are often troubled around their third, ninth birthday.’
‘Um, either is nice.’ Draco said, trying his best to think of something to say, ‘They will have a wonderful childhood with that portable zoo you have. However, you might want to be careful. A lot of the things you keep are dangerous to little humans.’
Draco was silent. He never had much civil conversation with Potter, and this was new and interesting to him, like a child having mint candy for the first time, sweet and refreshing, every brain cell of his was cool and bubbling. Not to mention he had always been fascinated by that timid but confident, polite and gentle demeanor of Potter’s. And all of this was extremely shameful as he was very clearly aware he had the cum of another man in him.
He raised his tail and curled it around Potter’s wrist, pulling him shakily, Potter stroked his cheek one more time, holding his face in his hands, repeated Draco’s words as if he needed to do so to understand: ‘You want to take it. For me.’
‘And,’ she said as she swallowed a mouthful, ran her finger along the silver spoon, ‘If you have questions, you can ask him at your birthday party. You know it’s the third ninth birthday of yours, and your parents are making a huge deal out of it. Your father caught wind of your relationship improvement with Potter, and he was invited. And he’s going.’
Potter stopped when there was no space on his arse to land more strikes without overlapping, by then he was a sobbing mess, unable to support himself on his legs. In those green eyes, his arse was a delicious pink, just shy of red, as Draco was subconsciously tensing and relaxing, even swaying a little, it seemed like sweet seduction. As composed as the man were, his suit pants were getting tight, and when he reached to feel Draco’s arse cheeks, it weren’t all for examining the extent of the damage.
‘The least I can do.’ He couldn’t exactly apologise for his past behaviour so far into their friendship, and apologies only get you so far. There’s still compensation to do and a deeper relationship to build.
‘…Yes, sir.’ Draco answered once Potter let go, his fingers digging into his arms to remind himself to keep his head clear and not to make any more mistakes.
‘I told you, Rosier, I told you.’ Said the old Auror weakly. The old bastard must have been pretending for a while now, waiting for the right moment to use his last bit of magic.
It felt different from last time. Last time Potter’s arms and chest were firm, now, he could feel Potter’s clavicle distinct against his forehead. But it didn’t make the embrace less comforting. Draco leaned into Potter as close as possible, grabbing his collar tight.
Luckily Granger noticed he was awake, and quickly walked over, cast another testing spell on Draco while reassuring him: ‘Harry’s fine. Ron and George had just rushed him to St. Mangos for an emergency operation on his hands —— we are sending you there shortly too, as soon as your vitals stable enough for transportation.’
His heart warmed just at the thought of James. They were quite similar, actually. Maybe Draco had a type. Normally awkward but cute, but fierce and powerful when the situation requires. The only difference was James was just a normal guy, while Potter had everything and more. But Draco was fine with normal. The brand of an ex-death eater was still on his back, so normal was appreciated.
And even if he had known, he wouldn't have known how to love someone, to treat them the way they deserved, let alone how to have been a person who would deserve and have won Potter's attention, respect, and heart.
Also, something of the man’s words or expression turned him on immediately, right after he felt he was chilled to the bones. For all the years at Hogwarts, that face of Potter’s mostly alternated between irritation and detest when he was looking at Draco, sometimes resignation, or even bored. But never intrigued, never had he been able to get Potter’s full attention, no matter how far he pushed him.
He said, running his other hand through the soft, thick fur on Draco’s tail —— Merlin he had a tail now, flawlessly snowy white, not a single miscellaneous hair —— and it sent sparks right up his spine, making him moan. Draco could swear that tail was more sensitive than his cock.
Pansy wasn’t kidding about clothes flying off the shelves after Potter show up today. She had used the simplest lines, and the purest green on Potter, silver ivy branches decorated with kallaite down the front brought out Potter’s eyes distinctively, and added some solemnity to Potter’s awkward demeanor. Also, whatever spell she used to deal with Potter’s hair, Potter needed to learn it.
The man shifted on the bed to be face to face with Draco, moved closer and held Draco’s face in his hands: ‘My uh, I guess you could say foster mother, she loved her son very much, though she was too spoiling. She always kissed him good night. I never liked her very much, but I guess I always envied that. There’s this woman, the nicest lady in the world, her son is my best friend, I had a few sleepovers at their place, I see her as the closest I’ve ever had as a mother. She was very nice to me, but um, maybe it’s because she didn’t want to overstep any boundaries, ‘cause we were already more than little boys by then, and my friend rejected such intimacy with her, she never kissed me good night either.’
Draco also noticed something else: ‘How did you know I always came up second? Did we know each other?’
‘…Something like that.’ Potter said, walking up to Draco again, and Draco opened his arms unabashedly, urging Potter to pick him up.
The spell bounded Draco’s wrists, just tight enough for him to feel it there, Potter let him off the wall, smiling a little wickedly: ‘You wanted to know where we were? I’ll show you.’
In fact, Draco loved every second he spent with the man, how the man couldn’t keep his hands off him, how Draco was the only beauty to those emerald eyes, and the way the man awaits for his goodnight kisses on the forehead with glinting innocent eyes like a child.
