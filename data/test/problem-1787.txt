Draco cleared his throat. "I do not talk about you. He was trying to humiliate me in front of you. He knows of my... crush." Harry gaped back at the room they had just left with surprise. "Crush? So all this time you've been pushing me away?" Harry asked, not able to keep the big grin off his face even with his sad words. "No, that wasn't my intention..." Harry grabbed his hand. "I don't really care what your intention was." Harry stared at him intensely, watching in satisfaction as his body turned pink even as his eyes stayed a cool light grey. "I want to be with you, Draco. With you and your mother, and your son."
They got pretty much nothing done. The officer didn't even ask about the member who apparently came to Draco's house, or if they had already asked it must have been unimportant. Harry couldn't help but bring it up later, though. Later meant he had to ask
seen those castles. "This is Hogsmeade... Well, I see Hogwarts has already caught your attention. You'll be going there while I get you your wand and clothes." Harry suddenly felt ridiculously overwhelmed. Not only was this place full of things he had never seen before, but she was expecting him to go up to that huge castle?
with paperwork and even more training. Harry had not even realized how tangled up the Ministry was with the Aurors until Hermione had reminded him, and so Harry's slight with the head of the department about whether he had the authority to boss him around didn't help matters.
Harry had thought, hell, he couldn’t even envision himself being that. But through the rain as he talked to one he noticed a dark figure by another oak tree, one that got clearer as he dismissed the man and got closer. The figure was pale and it didn’t take much to know it was Malfoy. His head was bent down in respect, and he was slumped down on the tree quite possibly ruining his expensive robes. His robes were pulled back and the Dark mark was in full view, and his eyes were vacant as he stared at the funeral taking place.
"Gryffindor? Is that one of the houses, then?" Harry asked the redhead. "Yup. I have five other brothers, and one
Harry was regretting wearing what Hermione gave him. Hermione made him wear a dark green robe to 'match his eyes'. It made Harry look like a depressed leprechaun. He also had to wear his huge jacket over it, so he looked like a complete idiot. At least he was warm as he trudged up a hill with Hermione and Hagrid. "I don't understand... how this is getting us to Hogwarts." Harry huffed. "We're using a portkey." Hermione looked over at Harry. "It's a magical transportation device. Don't worry. It only feels a little bit weird. I first tried it a week ago." Hermione explained in her actually flattering robe and dress. Harry pulled his robe closer so they wouldn't see his hand-me-downs.
Malfoy started rambling about the ingredients needed for such an enchantment, and Harry’s mind went to more enjoyable things to think about, like snooping. He couldn’t stop thinking of the possibility of going through Malfoy’s stuff once he was gone, but the man never seemed to leave except for class or tea. He didn’t want to even think of what asking Hermione might do for his self-image. It wasn’t his fault the stupid Slytherin Prince was so mysterious, okay, in a way, he was interesting. And he couldn’t help his need to snoop.
"Are you angry at me?" Harry said, ignoring the way his heart flared up at the sound of Draco saying his own name. Draco looked confused and aggravated, and Harry wished he hadn't brung it up. "Angry about what?" Harry flinched and made himself ready for the inevitable. "About... me breaking your rule. Of not seeing each other again." Draco sighed and looked Harry in the eye, as if this wasn't becoming a entirely embarrassing encounter. "That isn't exactly what I was referring to when I said that." Draco raised an eyebrow in acknowledgement of the unsaid. Harry blushed stupidly and backed away from the cell.
Harry lifted up again, fearing it was already too late, when another figure came out and yelled his own spell at the woman. The wand flew out of her hands and into the woods.
Draco breathed roughly. "Maybe one day. But right now my father is being sent to Azkaban, and I'd rather not. I know why he's going, of course- he's a Death Eater. And I am too. The  only reason I'm not going as well is because of you." Draco looked at him with a mix of adoration and pain, as if he couldn't recognize the full complexity of his own emotions. "Draco, you're not going because you're not like your father. And that's a good thing." Harry told him, kissing him. Harry knew why he loved Draco then. It was not because of his stubborn nature, but because he was more than just his family, just like Harry was.
Blaise threw open the curtains and turned back to him. “Too bad. Because we’re talking about this before your interview. And we’re thinking this through.” Blaise said, pointing at a picture in his hand. “We need to get the upper hand, Draco.”
Draco decided to go with it and hope for the best. “As do you, with your recent history, you ought to know how I feel at this point in time.” He said, mockingly making a solemn face while nodding. But going with the flow was apparently not what the situation called for, as Harry had already started to get up to stand over by Draco and Greg’s desk.
"Harry, I'm sorry-" Draco began as soon as Harry got his coffee, and balanced himself on the freshly cleaned couch. Harry held up a finger like a exhausted professor. "Please no apologizing. I've had enough of that for a millennium." Arsehole. Draco rolled his eyes, less scared now that he was a bit pissed off himself. "Why are you here? Don't you have millions of girlfriends who will attend to you now?" Draco asked mockingly. Draco felt like a idiot, standing and watching him like this, but had nowhere to go as he was too uncomfortable to sit in the armchairs of the sitting room and Harry had already claimed the couch.
No, there was no good to think about that. Draco had mastered Occlumency by now- or so he had hoped- but thinking about anything he was scared of would not be wise with Voldermort involved. Including any thoughts that were against Voldermort specifically. Draco's only safe haven to hate Voldermort was in his dreams. Draco had found out Harry had not so good dreams, thanks to his now-becoming favorite muggle device. He assumed without Snape's help that the dreams he was describing were due to Voldermort's influence. Green lights? Draco shivered. When Harry found out, he would never be so innocent to call it a 'nightmare' again.
"Why are you here, Harry?" Draco whispered darkly across the interrogation table as the other Auror officer looked down at his paperwork. "Is there something the matter?" The officer interrupted before Harry could answer. They were being watched. Both by the officer and by the other side of the two-sided mirror. This was better than sitting in court, though, Harry thought. He could convince a bunch of Aurors that he had no relationship with Draco in any way. Even though he had been staying up looking at Draco's case for a week. They wanted to detain him for as long as possible. Corrupt bastards.
Harry swung Draco into his arms, which was no easy encounter, since Draco was about 5 inches taller than him and hard rock for someone so skinny, but he had managed it, and put a flabbergasted Draco back down before he could hurt himself. "What in the Merlin's hells is wrong with you?" Draco asked, chuckling as he tampered back his bangs that had came loose during the flight. "Just happy to be without work for a few months, that's all." Harry answered honestly. He was looking forward to summer for once, which seemed to only start after he had graduated from Hogwarts. Of course, now he wasn't expected to go back to the Dursley's or go fight off Dementors.
Draco swallowed and stepped closer. "I know. But I'm not going to hurt you, Harry. I can promise you that." Harry thought of all the suspicious things that had attempted to get into Hogwarts the whole year. "But what about everyone else? Draco-" "-You need to trust me. Harry, do you trust me?" Harry blinked back angry tears and shook. "Yes. But I'm not going to stop following you. I won't let them change you." Draco laughed darkly. "I'm already being watched by different people, Harry. I don't need you as a protector." Harry thought immediately of Voldermort, but Draco had said different people...
act like a dragon sometimes... "That isn't the point! I would've realized the importance of the situation!" Draco complained. Harry rolled his eyes. "Before or
“Ah, the old ‘I’m a Malfoy and Malfoy’s don’t need checking up on’ rant? I’ve heard that a couple times whenever Pansy and him have a go.” Blaise said and scanned Harry like he was looking for something off. Apparently, Harry was satisfactory enough because his coal eyes snapped back to Harry’s in a flourish. “It was more like a ‘get out of here before I hex you, you messy-haired prat’ but sure.”
Deserting the ring around the separating gates and walking up the steps that ended the employees-only work space and went into the bleachers, he headed up to the right-wing, steering clear of any Weasley's for now. Contrary to popular belief in the Weasley family, he wasn't looking for a fight with Harry's ex-girlfriend, especially when Harry would just blame him anyway. It didn't matter that the red-haired devil slut was constantly trying to take back what was currently his, if
stressed with you so close." Harry breathed, surprised at his honesty. Draco looked shocked, then he grinned and walked closer.
Harry’s thoughts kept wandering back to the breakup scene. He had told Hermione, and very hesitantly Ron, as Hermione suggested, before he had broken up with her, and she gave him a whole load of advice on what to do in every situation imaginable. Harry didn’t know what he was expecting, a rage fit? No, that was more of Ron and his forte. A weeping? No, that was Cho. But he hadn’t expected complete denial.
“Wait a second. What did Rowle do, exactly?” Draco held up a hand to stop him, project forgotten. “W-why I think he dealt with the children not in Potter’s level, right? Carrow’s and the others did our year.” Blaise answered, not used to having him part of the conversation. “Right. And was he there at the Battle of Hogwarts?” Blaise thought about it, chewed his muggle gum, and blew it out. “Yeah, pretty sure.” Draco sat back in his seat, confounded.
stop chasing Albus!" Harry said with the sharpest tone he could manage that would not get them kicked out of the store. Albus, even though he wasn't the one being addressed in the first place, stopped in front of a running James and caused the two of them to crash onto the red carpet. Albus's telltale screaming was heard, and Harry had to entrust that Lily would stay calm enough for him to step away and help the mop of children on the floor up. As he separated James and a crying Albus, another boy came around the corner. Harry couldn't see much because of the tangled toddlers in his arms, but he looked to be toddler aged as well.
"It is time, for the tenth coronation in Hogwarts history. Hogwarts first had kings and queens designated shortly after its creation, but King Gryffindor, King Slytherin, Queen Hufflepuff, and Queen Ravenclaw decided to pass on the throne after a hundred years not through heritage, but through the Sorting Hat. It is typically boys who will become the successor of Gryffindor and Slytherin and girls of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw...  but that might not always be the case." Dumbledore added on. Harry resisted the urge to snort. No wonder Professor McGonagall was so pissed. She didn't look the type who would appreciate gender exclusion. The Hat then began to whisper to Dumbledore. "Wait, please." Was all he said.
” The faster we get to class, the faster I can work on this Letter of Trade.” Draco said, waving a scroll at Harry. Harry, still not seeing the use, popped open a shaving vial and poured it onto his chin. It seeped through, leaving it silky, but not necessarily smooth. Harry grimaced at the mirror. When he looked back Draco was already smoothing out his cuffs, and sending dirty looks to Harry’s undesirable old tee and denim. Harry went to grab the nearest robe out of his drawers grumpily.
Harry paced from behind one of the hundreds of stores in Diagon Alley. He thought it might be a cauldron shop based off the awful stench, but he couldn’t be sure. Their assignment was to blend in with Wizard society, but so far, he had already lost his partner Ron in the crowds. Was that a good thing or bad thing? Harry put on yet another glamour, this one of a sourpuss old maid, and headed back into the shop. At first, he noticed that this was not a cauldron shop, and that the thing he smelled was far decayed but kept in a jar of organs. Scrunching his nose tight, he went deeper down into the store until he found the front, blissfully undisturbed by any other window shoppers.
"Yes... Wait- how did you- I-" Harry stumbled. How did she even know his size when he was wearing a big coat? Did she read the papers he gave to the receptionist "Tonks" when he looking? "Don't worry, Mr Potter. Someone will escort you there. And here he comes now." Harry looked in the direction Doctor McGonagall was looking at and saw what looked to be a giant with a long beard. "Uh, Doctor McGonagall-" Harry began. "Actually, it's Professor McGonagall, my dear. Doctor is only for the muggles." Harry didn't know who to gape at, as the tall man came towards them. "Muggles?-" "Harry Potter! You're really here, in the flesh! Did you tell him yet, Miss?" The giant asked.
Harry was thinking of ways to do this when he almost plunged broomfirst into a carriage heading towards Slytherin tower. A carriage? Seriously? Didn't wizards just stick to flying and apparation? Flying out of the way as the carriage stopped, Harry landed shakily on the ground, knowing he was going to get screamed at by some Pureblood. He just hoped they cared that he was king- it was his only form of defense these days. But he definitely wasn't ready for who came out. It was Draco's buggering father, of course he had to be the one Harry almost became a fly on the carriage for. Already wanting to run away, Harry steeled himself.
Draco, foolishly, had approached Harry without any regard of who he might have been sitting with, as Harry had been known to switch up his seating plans. There, of course, was sitting every one of Harry’s lackeys, and they were all staring wide eye up at him from their seats. Draco had to wonder, were they shocked because he called Harry, Harry or that he had even approached him at all? He almost dropped his plate of crepes and steadied it with his other hand.
Sensing a flying object coming his way, Draco grabbed onto the small paper and casted Aparecium onto the note before the old lady could see. It wasn’t like the other students would take notice, they were all taking care of the teeny animals that would probably be lethal if touched.  The note had all the arrogance of Potter himself and the irritating sense of a frustrated student, so he knew there was no mistaking it. It was short cut, simple, and to the point, and it irked Draco that Potter didn’t seem to be invested into the mystery as much as he was; but apparently not as much as partner, who was trying to grab hold of the monster was obviously looking for help. “Sorry, Sally Smith.” He said with as much charm as he could muster, which was considerably higher than normal as the girl had not seen much of Draco during their stint at Hogwarts. “Thanks, Draco.” She giggled. The girl comfortably placated and the worm-thing back at a normal tone, Draco formed a reply.
Draco fumbled with his gift for Harry, spelling the wrapping paper on with one hand and signing off his name with the other. He had been confused and stiffy about what to get him, but Weasley, in an angelic mood, had tipped him off about a signed muggle Irish Quidditch jacket from one of his years at school, Draco couldn’t remember now.
“Yes. Now,” -Malfoy slams down an advanced Potions book onto their conjoined desks- “Perhaps your girlfriend can help you find the enchantments necessary to brew that ugly creature they call a solution.” He said, taking the magazine out of Ginny’s hands. “You are here to support him, right?’ He said, doing his trademark I-call-bullshit-you-peasant smirk. “…Right. You know, Malfoy, when I heard you and Harry were studying together I thought Ron was off his rocker, but apparently not. You seem to make… an effective team.” She said, and Harry knew that look she was giving meant trouble. It meant that she was thinking of something potentially very dangerous for conversation.
Draco looked over at Harry, who was currently writing on a scroll by himself next to a window in Transfiguration. A bang fell back on his hair and Harry blew it out of his face, and Draco thought that his black hair really did look like brunet if you looked at it in the right lighting-
Draco thought. Draco took the snitch carefully and put it in his small satchel. Harry followed his movements and hugged Draco while he wasn't looking. "Now I
George laughed and threw the spirit stick in the air, and it sailed back down to him. “Don’t you see? Iota Mu Xi is going to enter in it! And, I made it, of course!” Harry felt his pride soar, despite the circumstances, and went in for a hug. “Congratulations, George, of course we’ll sign on.” Harry assured him, and Draco choked. “What? Is all your family nutters? Harry- “Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed Draco’s arm to pull him into the group hug. “This is not the end of the story.” Draco whispered. Harry smiled. “Just go with it.” He answered, not caring half a wit if all of Britain saw them hugging together. He was happy that George was doing something out of his shell. He was happy Draco was there along with it. And he would be prepared to face the consequences, including Blaise’s reaction when he found out they were doing business without his prior knowledge.
“Damn it! So close!” Harry moaned as Draco victoriously pushed him to his knees down on the ground. Draco whistled at him and held up the ball for the others to see. “Excellent job Draco!” Greg yelled. “Don’t get too cocky, Draco, this was just the kick-off.” Harry said, glumly. Draco laughed. “We’ll see about that.”
Harry thought he saw a grimace on Draco’s face in the low light. “It was like living a double life. I know you know that, but it truly was. It was like trying to be yourself, to know nothing while knowing everything. I was never a follower in school, as you know. But in there I was. And everything I said had to be measured beforehand, because I was living with a fucking murderer and his deranged friends in my house! Really does a number on my outlook on life.” He finished. Draco turned and faced Harry.
And okay, so he didn’t have to bring up the future so often. But he was looking forward to a pressure-free lifestyle for once. And blimey, he deserved to feel like one of those hippies for once! Harry knew, or at least, thought, he had the answer for Draco’s darkened face. He knew Draco loved spending time with him, as much as the git loved anything, but anything that was a reminder of time was a reminder of his parents and their unpredictable-ness. Or rather, their inevitable claims on Draco’s heritage.
“Ron, he knew that you would be this angry, if not angrier, at him. I think he even worried for the safety of Draco.” Ron snorted and Hermione knew he was considering his options. The look on his face that Hermione had mastered to know showed that he was warring with morals and avengement, and avenging almost always won. Surprising Hermione though, Ron stood still and looked thoughtfully. “I suppose I would have been a bit madder then. But he could have told me. What, does he think I hate queers? It’s not as if I’m religious or anything!” Hermione winced at Ron’s poor choice of words. She’d have a lot to teach him if he was ever going to confront their relationship.
Draco watched as George expertly, or maybe just wildly with a douse of luck, fielded and deflected all personal questions away from Harry. Draco watched as the tenseness gave way to ease each time. His heart, for his own part, pumped just as hard whenever they inappropriately asked about Harry's relationship with Draco. It made Draco's blood boil every time he saw Harry rub his eyelids under his glasses, a clear sign he was in fear of whatever question that bastard reporter was asking. He wanted desperately to attack them, make them respect him as much as they once did, but that was useless now. His name was destroyed.
, the one no one wanted to say the name of. If he was horrible, well, Harry wasn't scared. And if he started having more and more nightmares, well, that had nothing to do with it. Harry wasn't the only one having nightmares.
He made his way over and grinned widely, handing a butterbeer to him despite a disapproving snort. “I can’t believe Blaise is making you hand out this shite.” Draco commented, distracted by the beer to be his usual withdrawn self.
30 minutes later, shopping bags levitated and feeling very sure with himself, pointed a brooding Potter in the direction of an eyeglass store. “Why do I need new glasses again? I just got these, Malfoy.” Draco shook his head in mock disgust. “They don’t fit you. And don’t act like you couldn’t afford it.” Draco snorted and set to work on finding the perfect pair.
A few, and by few he meant many, lessons later, Draco was resting comfortably by a stone as Harry stood against him, trying to seek warmth. “You know, you’re awfully snobby.” Draco made a face and Harry pressed his nose to his to prevent any squelching. “Remember when we had to write that essay? For our entrance to the uni, I mean?” Draco nodded and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. “That ‘My Mark on the World shite?” Draco confirmed. “I think it’s not to be taken to so literally. That it doesn’t have to be so big, like saving the wizarding world. It can be a small thing, like helping Colin. Or leaving a good impression on new people.”
Harry wandered around the buffet before remembering the Indian food was by the East entrance. Ron was checking his flip-phone for any messages from Hermione, a habit they'd got into after they ended up with hardly any classes together. Harry hardly even looked at his flip-phone, something Hermione greatly admonished him about. But that wasn't important. What was important was getting some noodles down his belly. "Ron, got any spare change?" Harry asked, making Ron look away from his phone and grab for a few knuts in his robe pockets, barely even registering the question before looking back down again.
Finally rid of interruptions, Draco made his way to a non-magical tree on the Hogwart's grounds and sat down. Draco was relieved to see bars come up on the stupid phone, and punched in Harry's number before it could possibly not work again. Should he call? No, that would be just as forward as he was before, and Draco had in good mind not to do something as embarrassing as that ever again. Thankfully, Draco had already stayed up thinking about what his first words would be, and sent out a "Hey, it's the guy from the library. I'm Draco Malfoy." before throwing the phone on the grass. Draco let out a breath of air he didn't know he was holding.
“So, Potter. Did you talk to dear Ginerva about Colin?” He gave a knowing smile to the evil-looking scowl on Potter’s face. “I thought we weren’t talking about that.” Draco laughed and threw the duster into the basket. “Who said that? I’m concerned, Potter. All this talk about differing feelings… I can’t help but wonder if the problem lies in your interest.”  Potter just looked downright confused, and Draco wondered if they were ever going to get anywhere. “
Harry wondered if he had drunken any alcoholic beverages, but the migraine in his head didn't seem to be conjoined with any wooziness of a hangover. "Draco?" He called out, looking around for anyone else in the workroom. He was alone. Crap.
when he already had a lot on his plate was nauseating. At least Draco believed him. "Lots of weird things happen to you, Harry. This could be one of them. However, I doubt it was a accident." Harry didn't want to think about that right now though, so he decided to go with the lesser of two evils.
"Was something... bad supposed to happen?" Harry asked nervously, not sure if Draco was going to push him off his broom for even asking such a thing. Draco bit his lip. "No- I mean... Harry, just shut your big mouth about it, alright?" Draco said, the anxiousness in his words cancelling out the bite of his insult. It wasn't even clever like his usual ones were, which lead Harry to believe it definitely was bad. "Fine. Remind me never to get on your bad side." Harry sniffed. They were getting near to Hogwarts, and Harry would have to fly back to his room before Draco's own welcome back party saw him.
Harry chuckled and turned to Draco. “Rugby, then?” He asked. “I hear its hip now.” Hermione groaned and left them to their highly exaggerated giggles.
and instead preferred to endlessly argue with Harry over not being able to stand alongside him as a true helper of the WWW.
As Malfoy ran, his hair puffed up even more and Harry thought he looked like a white fluffy marshmallow. It would fit better if he was wearing something casual, but the arsehole was wearing something snobbish as always. There was not even a forced dress code at the academy, and he was still wearing fitted robes and a tie. But he didn’t look very high and mighty as he fought his way through to the tea, Harry thought and grinned.
Harry had finished another training session with Draco (yes, real patronus training, not just messing around like Draco had suggested) and was flying back down the Slytherin tower, as per Dumbledore's suggestion of sticking to well-known passageways. They had made
was not as cool and collected as he seemed. Harry poked Draco in the ribs as Hagrid began to talk, as Draco wasn't even listening. "You okay there, mate?" Harry asked, raising his eyebrows. Harry was a bit annoyed, to say the least, he was excited to see Hagrid teach and Draco himself said he couldn't wait to 'best the animals' as he called it. "I don't like birds. Any kind, really. Definitely not the big kind." Harry couldn't really call it a bird except for the head and wings, but it did seem rather frightening.
“It seems to require… physical interaction as well.” Draco whispered, licking his lips. Harry’s throat went dry as he watched. “Uh, what?” He asked nervously. Draco sighed and answered as if it bored him. “A kiss, Harry. I want a kiss.” Harry grinned. “Why didn’t you just say so?” He leaned in and locked lips, currently not giving a damn if anyone saw them in their secluded spot.
"Oh come on! The Potter I knew would never let that stop him." Draco chased him again until he caught eye of the snitch, hovering this time in clear view in the center of the false-pitch. Draco set off, and heard a huff of indignation before Draco sped up behind him. Draco looked back in time to see Harry flying as fast as Draco, grinning a toothy grin at Draco before lurching forward and snatching the snitch into his hands. Draco smirked. He had went easy on the bugger. "Good game." Draco said courtly, hovering down to the grass. "Couldn't have done it from my favorite enemy." Harry teased, flicking Draco's nose. "We can do this." He said confidently.
"Harry James Potter?" Harry heard the voice before he looked up and saw her. She was an old woman, yet somehow still looked completely healthy and focused. She looked like someone his family would be taunting, not entrusting a teen who practiced 'witchcraft' to. At least her outfit seemed normal, but it merely shadowed the fact that she demanded complete respect and attention. "Y-yes, that's me." Harry cowered, than winced.
Harry, at a lost for words, tried to examine Draco's bipolar expression. He looked for certain indifferent, but a twitch in his mouth and his slit eyes told a different story. "Draco, if I didn't
Harry laid out flat on Blaise's leather couch as Draco and Blaise talked in hushed tones standing near the door. Harry felt like the whole thing was silly, they had already done damage control to the best of their abilities and Blaise was dragging the whole thing out. Pansy had already
Blaise scowled at him and shoved the box of tickets to Harry and Draco when they came over. “I’m. Going. On. Break. It is way too hot to be in the middle of November.” Blaise huffed and went off to find his other cronies, Harry reckoned. “Hey! There are popsicles in here!” Harry showed to Draco, who was already laughing at Harry’s show of throwing out tickets to get to the popsicles at the bottom. “Figure we should take one before the rest find out?” Draco grabbed onto the green apple flavor and grinned. “I think we ought to, yes.”
Draco sneezed, quite loudly, as dirt was scuffed up by two Basketball players as they fought over the ball by Draco's side of the court. It wasn't
Draco hurriedly hid his collection of art away from prying eyes as Harry made his way over to the picnic table he was seated at in one of the many small lawns the old building had provided. Draco had protectively chosen one of the hastily installed picnic tables under an also hastily installed tree, and was partially shaded by it. He thought it made him seem mysterious and keep annoying former Hufflepuff’s away.
"You better not be thinking of ways to prank me, Mr. Malfoy." Harry purred, tightening his grip once he went back to Draco's thigh. Draco smirked and grabbed Harry's muggle sweater. "Wouldn't dream of it, Mr. Potter." He whispered, ducking him into a kiss. Harry's grip loosened off Draco's thigh and went instead to his hair. "Stop messing up my hair, prat." Draco whispered. Harry grinned and grabbed a tuft, messing up Draco's hair completely. Draco's nose reddened and he huffed. "Stop, dammit!" Draco screeched and tried to hit Harry's hand away like a angry cat. "Okay, Okay!" Harry conceded. "I love you, Draco." He told him in compensation. "I love you too, you bastard." Draco grumbled.
Draco loved the fleeting moments in which they spent cuddling, even if it was partially terrifying. It was thrilling; to wrap his own arms around Harry, in a way he could only dream about in the deepest of his mind. It might sound silly, but this seemed special to Draco. It wasn’t like Draco was a cuddly person, of course.  “I passed the first portion! They thought I showed so much promise that I’m already one of the top.” Harry gave his signature half-grin and Colin practically jumped out of the mirror. “That’s amazing! I knew it, I knew you could!” Colin grinned like a Cheshire Cat and Harry laughed like this was just a normal occasion out with friends.
"Oh Ms. Parkinson! Do not talk in such devilish ways! Mr. Potter was a dream come true to us, saving us with his testimony from Azkaban. Oh, he was such a service to us all." His mother stood on the other side, yet another Potter fan since his testimony in June. She acted as if it was a crime that he and Harry were not the best of friends yet, since their terse meeting after the Jury decided. He had apologized and thanked Harry, Harry had blanched in surprise at the polite talk, as if Draco was out of his mind. He stifled a cough and held out his hand, saying a small "It wasn't your fault. You did it for your family. Don't lie, what is true stays true. Your path is not defined by you. Hermione saw that in a book once." He smiled and looked in Draco's eyes, the obvious challenge in his own. But Draco was nothing but his ambition, so he stuck out his arm even though touching Potter might bring up some painful memories. But all that happened was a brief shake, and Draco had to ignore the spark it sent through him. Potter was quite attractive, he'd be blind not to notice. But it is what it is.
Harry smiled and held on tighter, and Draco knew it wasn't that successful. "I know, I'm just worried, alright?" Harry spoke, sweat frozen on his forehead from the cold climate of the sky elevation around them. Draco flew closer to Harry and put a hand on his back, knowing fully well his arm would hurt in the morning. "Harry, I promise that whatever you choose will be the right one. Because let's face it, you have me, and I'm a genius." Harry laughed and did a swoop in the air, almost knocking Draco off his own broom. "HARRY!" Draco screamed, righting himself and squeezing on tight to his potion bag. "Sorry, sorry." Harry smiled at Draco.
“WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, HARRY?” Hermione yelled, and sparks flew out of her wand. “The idiocy… I can’t believe you two… wandering around indecent in public like that…” She ranted. What in Merlin’s name is she on about? Harry began to shake in anger. “Okay, Hermione, they weren’t actually in public. They were in the woods, for Godric’s sake.” Harry’s shoulders untensed as Ron came to defend him. “Thanks, Ron.” Pansy spoke up. “Did you not hear any cameras?” She asked, more at ease then Harry thought she should be. “Yes, but I thought It was just twigs snapping from other couples.” Harry said woefully.
Harry realized he had been grossly neglecting his king duties when he was woken up late to tell the news. "Harry! Harry! Wake up! It's death eaters! They're storming Hogwarts!" Harry had rose instantly, blinking off another terrible nightmare that had just turned real. "Where's Ron? Where's Draco?" He commanded, racing to find his clothes. Hermione didn't even blush or turn away when Harry stripped. "Ron's with the others. Fighting. We didn't want you to do this Harry, but Dumbledore told me to get you." She looked defeated. "What? They wanted me to just sleep while you are all risking your lives? I can't do that!" Harry yelled, taking his broom once he dressed.
you with ease, so I doubt you'll have any problem doing the whole spell thing." Draco bristled against him. "I just..." Draco sighed. "You know what, I shouldn't lie to my savior. I can't kill anything. Deathly afraid of it, in fact." Harry wondered about what seemed to be a rare showing of genuineness from the boy. Harry decided to choose his next words carefully... or so he thought. "Really... don't worry about it-" Harry turned back and was struck by the worry on Draco's face. "-I'll help you do it."
“It’s… it’s a hit-or-miss, Greg. Does she feel the same?” Draco asked, and scowled when Sue Li took a seat next to Harry, obscuring his view. Greg, not noticing Draco’s dilemma, continued. “I think so. You know how Mills is sometimes. S’ times it feels like I’m talking to a wall! Women.” He said, shaking his head. Draco chuckled, knowing he had a fair share with Pans. Just then, Harry turned to give Draco an awkward wave. Draco’s insides squeezed. He saluted him back.
"Is Neville Longbottom alright? And Draco Malfoy? They were with me-" Harry stopped, not wanting to articulate the next words. He knew he could be hearing the most awful words ever said to him, and didn't know if he was even brave enough. "Neville has been already released, with nothing but a few curses. Draco, however, was in quite a unforeseen circumstance. I assume you already know of his... condition?" Mrs. Pomfrey asked, raising her eyebrow in question. Harry was now increasingly worried. She must mean... "Well, that look on your face is enough of an answer of any. Longbottom attested to seeing Malfoy turn into a dragon. And while 'Nagini' and Malfoy were fighting, Longbottom cut off Nagini's head."
The journey back to Hogwarts afterwards was much more fun than the journey to kill the thing. In fact, after Draco had killed it himself, he was in a much better mood, and they were flying through the air as if drunk off their mugs. Harry had a situation where he almost dropped his slipper off his foot, and Draco had laughed so hard as they both dropped to catch it that Harry was afraid they'd wake up every muggle and wizard in the area. "You should be a seeker." Draco said wistfully as Harry grabbed it before Draco could. "What's that?" Harry asked. "Oh, I forgot you're
He decided to fly his way up again, not wanting to be seen- most of all not by Hermione- while making his trek to the Slytherin castle. But someone else was in there,
He had been talking about a lot of things with Draco of late. After that meltdown, they seemed to be closer than ever. Draco treated Harry as more than a quick snog, and Harry was able to talk about more about himself than he did before, since Draco had already shared a lot. When they weren't discussing deep things, they were chatting about the unimportant part of their lives- like their schooling. Draco complained about studying, Harry didn't study at all, but somehow there was never a lack of something to talk about. It was if their complete lack of the same upbringing had no effect on Harry being with him at all, again and again.
Harry wished he didn’t. It was like one of those Witches Weekly ads, full of beauty product and a whole lot of hair gel. Nonplussed, he went to the bed, looking through the cracks for any secret belongings. And guess what, Master sleuth Harry was right! Inside the bed was aplenty of pictures, all of Draco in some way. Arrogant much, Harry laughed, but found it endearing more now. His personal favorite was Draco, at about 8, posing with the Egyptian pyramids by putting his hand under it. Harry wondered if he thought he was being clever or he had copied Muggle tourists. The world might never know.
when you could go with a respectable Slytherin? Honestly Harry, you're a failure in the dating department." Harry groaned, knowing that Draco would never budge. Maybe if he came to him glossy-eyed he'd set him up with the last Slytherin girl available if he couldn't find a girl.
Harry looked behind him at the younger boy who was now trying to read a picture book. "You're right. How old is yours?" Draco thought that Harry obviously knew. He had seen the prat with the Prophet in his hands more than once, though he had claimed to hate it. "I'm three." Scorpius answered for him. "Hey! That's how old Albus is!" The older boy said, before shoving the boy with his arm in a attempt to point him out. This didn't work out though, as he was quite smaller than him, and fell down on his own picture book. "James-" Harry said again, interrupted by what seemed to be a very dangerous sniffle noise made by the quiet child.
Draco was in barely-concealed rage and Harry knew it. He had to tread lightly, he knew that, but he had a tough time hiding his own challenge off his face. It wasn’t his fault that they were roomed together, and he wasn’t about to take any guilt thrown at him. “Sure, Potter, sure.” He growled and set his suitcase on the other bed before taking all the items out and setting them in his drawer with little patience. Harry had expected him to throw them, and just watched him in a frozen stupor. Draco put on an air of confidence and dignity but having known him so long Harry could see how much the war had affected him. The skinniness and dark eyes were gone, sure, but the shakiness in his body told all. That leaked out all the rest of Harry’s challenge and he let out a huff.
“Now that I think about it, that name does look familiar.” Colin said, eerily smiling for someone who was staring at his own possibly murderer. “Don’t look at me like that. I’m one step closer to peace.” He said, noticing Draco’s expression. “Do you honestly think peace will bring happiness?” He asked, never one who held their questions back. “For me, it will. And I think it will for you too, Draco. Maybe even with someone you know.” He smiled that smile again, and Draco, strangely, wondered what Potter was doing right now.
“Oh my, is that Janice trying to get a snog again?” They snorted, and Draco noticed the look of animosity between the two girls. He guessed that even Wizard drama extended to the Muggle world. “Sorry for her bothering you. I’m Freya. This is Bernie.” Bernie nodded at both and sat down with Freya a couple of chairs down. Draco leaned over to Harry. “They seem friendly.” Draco said ironically. Harry smiled. “Don’t they? See, Muggles aren’t that bad, at least not in these parts anyway.” He said, apparently not catching the sarcasm Draco was putting across. Draco himself caught the ‘at least’ part and was compelled to ask more, but was interrupted by them speaking up again.
Harry was humming annoyingly loud as they walked down the hallway to the breakroom, and if this was what it was going to be like walking to the cafeteria, he was about to permanently combust. Potter was dressed in a puffy pullover that looked two sizes too big, with cheap robes on top. The git had left the robe open at the top, letting his upper body look like a burnt marshmallow. Draco didn’t know if that was intentional or just accidental. On the way Draco saw Theo, and crowded to his side as if for protection. Draco could see him steal glances at them quizzically, as if it was a new secret he was trying to solve. Well, let him guess, then. At last, tea was in Draco’s view and he sprinted for the door, leaving Theo in his distracted talking about the latest scores and Potter in his annoying physique.
Yes I do. As I recall you never could go long without sending me a note. I was doing drills but I managed a ‘water break.’ We’re going to try and catch a real criminal soon (a guy who used magic in a muggle setting). No I didn’t injure myself, you dolt.
Harry groaned. "He had a fit with me yesterday. Said I was encouraging bad behavior in George. Essentially saying that the Universal Championships is a scam." Draco was taken back by this. Ron and him, actually having the same idea? It was absurd. "Sounds reasonable." Draco asserted. Harry glared at him again. "It's not. This is what George loves. We can't take that away from him." Draco knew that George loved his shop, but didn't know how far he would go. "Maybe we have to take full reign of this Universal Championships thing. Make sure he doesn't do anything crazy." Harry looked at him weird. "We already help out." Harry told him. Draco rolled his eyes. Harry was really clueless. "But we could also take full leadership of it. He'll be just the spokesperson with the shiny bow."
There was snoring heard from one of the beds in Draco's dorm. He assumed it was Crabbe. He knew his moral compass was skewed by anyone else's perspective, but he only cared about the people he was close to. He would have to save the people that mattered, and that was it. That included his family, his friends-even if he was not sure if they would do the same- and now Harry. The addition of another person he had to protect was unnerving. But he had signed up for it. He just hoped that he had the capacity to sacrifice himself. Finding tears on his eyes, he wiped them away with a charm.
“Now Draco, when did your feelings for Harry begin?” Harry’s eyebrow twitched as the certainty of Lima’s intentions arose. But Hermione and Pansy had already guessed this, so Draco already knew the answer. “Harry and I have had feelings for each other since around last year.” He smiled at Harry untruthfully, but he knew it was enough to unnerve them. “Alright. And who started this relationship?” He asked with a laugh. Harry felt revulsion as he faked a smile of his own. “I did.” Lima’s gaze switched to him. The writer boy wrote anxiously. Hermione nodded. Smith was silent.
The man didn't respond and instead pointed toward the other side of the room, with another large mirror. The boy scampered off to it, but not before noticing Harry at last. Although Harry was curious at what the boy looked like, he looked away quickly, not wanting to cause the boy to say something. He was already fearful of his father. The father nodded at him and told him he'd be back in a hour. Harry didn't know why he blindly trusted that the woman would come back, but the expensive-looking robes on the both of them told him that maybe they expected it. As soon as he left, the boy immediately started talking to Harry, without even turning away from the mirror.
Draco realized that sneaking out of Hogwarts to meet Harry was harder than expected. Snape had showed him how, and turned a blind eye, but actually getting away without fellow Slytherins noticing was the hard part. Draco could only imagine the blackmail that would ensue if someone found out he was leaving Hogwarts. Draco decided the only way he could possibly avoid blackmail was to be nicer to his friends than he had ever been before. "Did you just... save breakfast for me?" Blaise asked as he sat down in the dining hall way past meal time, as he almost always did when there was no special gossiping to be had.
Potter, I figure the mirror could be connected to the Erised, and the Portraits like we discussed. I’m guessing blending was involved, but that’s not the point. I think the family sent it for you to take care of.
It wasn’t that the prospect of doing it was so horrible, he knew that they would probably have a happy reunion and that she’d probably want to borrow the mirror, but he had grown attached to it, err, him, and he knew that they were still far behind in their mystery. It didn’t matter that Colin had assured them that they could take the entire year if they wanted, more excitement for him, because he knew that Ginny would not let the fact go that he had neglected in flooing her to tell her that her late friend was suddenly alive again.
Harry. Snape told him to look for black hair and green eyes, but it appeared he had found him first. Draco just couldn't see the scar, hidden behind long messy bangs. "Well, yes." Draco answered honestly. He watched as Harry's face turned to bewilderment, and it gave more time for Draco to study the differences in Harry's looks from his own.
It had all been well and good until Harry noticed just how quiet the walkway was. He wasn't in Hogwarts anymore, that was for certain, but should it really be this empty? Harry stopped his broom nervously, knowing there was something wrong. It WAS pretty late... (Harry had taken his sweet time leaving so he wouldn't come in contact with any crazed fans, which seemed to multiply by the day) He then felt something very bad as he noticed he couldn't see much of anything except for the road in front of him. Bugger... this wasn't a good idea. Harry felt as if he were being watched.
out already." Draco said when he didn't answer. Draco had been making fun of Harry ever since he learned of the crush on the Ravenclaw. "Just be quick, I've heard she's about to choose someone else." Harry blinked. He couldn't tell if Draco was just messing with him or not. It wasn't like Draco liked Harry's pick. He never did approve of anyone Harry found attractive, actually. So Harry would just have to rely on himself. Would an Owl work? Harry hadn't even talked to her much before the Tournament... "You think she'd say yes?" Harry asked nervously, catching eyes with the girl herself as she walked by with her friends.
"Are you serious?" Harry's mouth dropped, almost careening into a power line. "That's amazing, Draco!" Draco laughed at Harry's display and serenely adjusted on his broom, aiming it faster to their destination. "I know it is. It may not seem like a difference, but I'm getting paid this time." Draco smirked with mirth. Harry shook his head, and kept in pace with Draco's broom easily. "It makes all the difference. I'm so proud of you, Draco." Draco blushed, then tried to hide it by dropping suddenly to their apparation point. "Shite." Harry grunted to himself, then dropped as well. He would get back to that in time.
Mrs. Pomfrey agreed under one condition that she could check on him first. Harry relented, and finally after all the prodding she left to go to do what Harry hoped was firecall Draco what Harry had learned was the Hogwarts private infirmary. There was no one else in here, and Harry wondered if they had completely shut it out for him. "Potter, you stupid, infuriating, git!" Harry heard a yell, and turned to watch as Draco ran down from the right side of the curtains to him, out of breath it seemed. "You didn't have to be that fast." Harry told him, bewildered. "I was waiting for visiting hours to begin. Hard to do much else when your father has exiled you." Draco said with a wince.
"Ow, you twat!" Draco yelped as Harry kneed him right in the nether regions. "Sorry. Shouldn't have insulted my bits." Harry grinned as he had won. "Insulted? It's a fact!" Draco yelled with disbelief. "Oh, you're definitely not getting any now." Harry said before stalking off back into the kitchen. "At least clean while you're in there!" Draco told him before sighing. At last Harry was in a better mood than the day before. Draco might not be the affectionate type, but he knew at least how to inspire passion in Harry, even if it was just to piss him off. Draco knew they had a lot of work to do if they were going to live together.
Draco huffed, but apparently thought it wise to not anger the one who could kick him out after walking all that way, and walked through the door without a second glance to his helper. "Thanks, Miss... Granger." He said, irritated. Hermione gave Harry a lopsided smirked before closing the door on them. Draco waited for her to leave to sit down on Harry's window seat. "Woman and their extravagance. As if she didn't know what I meant by
Anyways, People were beginning to filter in slowly but surely. The teams were already making their runs, and while this Championships looked closely like the Olympics, which Harry didn't even know if George knew or not, it looked to be quite fun, and everyone was having a good time. There was a lot of cute men out there from Beijing, which he had told Draco, which promptly led to Draco elbowing him in the underarm. "Ouch!" He had cried, laughing at Draco's aghast expression. In truth, all he could stare at was Draco. He was dressed in his old Hogwarts Quidditch uniform, without the pads; of course, and was looking as naked as Harry had ever seen him before. He was standing with his arms crossed and one leg on the bottom bleacher, acting very concerned with the outcome of the training.
Harry changed the subject before Draco got to say anything. "We haven't even talked about Marvel yet. Do you go to school here, by the way?" Harry asked, and Draco had to rack his brain for where Harry currently lived, completely forgetting as Harry peered at him with his green eyes. "No, I've only just moved here. I'm homeschooled." Draco lied. How in Merlin's pants could he keep this lie? Did Harry know where everyone in this town lived? But Harry didn't ask where he lived, just nodded. "Too bad. I was hoping I could talk to you more." Harry said awkwardly. Draco wondered if Harry had friends other than that girl he seen before. "I might come and find you then." Draco told him with a smile.
Draco looked pissed off. "You think he's scary, wait until you meet He-who-must-not-be-named." Harry looked at him in shock. "You've met Voldermort?" Harry asked loudly, causing the librarian to look up angrily, all the way from across the hall. "Damn it. Come on, you git. Let's go." Harry didn't have any time to argue, as he was already being pulled away in the direction of the doors. Draco then pulled him all the way to a apparation point. "How do you even know how to apparate? Isn't that illegal?" Harry asked. "You've learned some things to survive, Harry, but I know some too." He answered cryptically before apparating them.
This chapter is filled with a lot more jokes than I thought there would be. Oops. (Livejournal: Maiwiz)
Harry's glasses were bent askew, probably due to Draco's grip on his hair, and he hurriedly fixed it for him, longing already for the lost touch. "I liked it." Draco smirked, hoping to gain some sense of control back. He already felt wobbly on his feet, he hoped Harry wouldn't step away suddenly, as he might trip and fall on his own newfound confidence. "I think it's obvious I want to see you again." Harry said innocently. Draco smiled sadly, Harry was purposely ignoring the fact that Draco and him had no choice but to see each other again. Because of... Him. At least, for now, Draco could see some hope in his future.
Now feeling like a toddler, himself, Harry ran his hair through his messy locks and turned to the window. “The view is amazing, though. Lots of rolling plains. We’re lucky with our location. Ron has a view of another building.” He laughed and turned back. “He has a room with Theodore Nott, you know. He threw a hissy fit before admitting at least that Theodore is a quiet one.” Harry had to fight himself to not mention the photo, stealing glances at it like a child. “You do not have to call my friends by their formal names. Theo quite hates it, in fact. Including Greg and Vince.” Harry noticed the obvious obliviousness to the fact that Vince had passed. He filed that in his head for personal questioning of Hermione.
Heading back to their dorm with a whole poster board now filled up, Draco quizzed Harry on all things concerning business. It seemed some of his business classes had come into use after all. "Now, if any reporters come to ask you questions about George, you..." Draco asked expectantly. "Fill their small-minded heads with facts about George Weasley and his Championships, but only the good ones that are still in developing. Leave them in suspense." Harry rolled his eyes at this. "Oh come on, Harry, this is serious. What if you end up just running away from the reporters instead of answering their questions, or worse, blowing up like you did when you were younger? We know they're going to attack George in front of you."
“Got to’ get out of here before they notice who we are.” Draco said In between huffs. He grabbed onto Harry’s hand to hoist him up but then pushed him back onto the grass. “Hey!” Harry yelped. “That’s for making my robes dirty, you prat.” He said, dusting off his poor robes. Harry huffed and got off his own bum again. “Am I in trouble?” He asked innocently, catching up to him. “Because I can’t thank you enough, Draco, for all the help you gave me and the tutoring, with that intelligent brain of yours.” He hopped back and forth between Draco’s two sides. “Keep walking, bucko. And I am a genius, thank you very much.” Harry barked and put his nose in Draco’s hair at the back of his head, thoroughly irritating Draco even more. “Wouldn’t forget it for the world.”
Now though, the thought made him shiver and he twisted more into Harry's arms. "What are you thinking about?" Harry asked as Draco rubbed his head trying to get into a more comfortable spot. "Just you." It was a lie, but Draco knew telling the truth would just lead to more talking he didn't want. It was the first day and he already wanted to move on. Time to convince Harry of that too. "Oh, really?" Harry smirked. Draco mouthed a
“Have you been talking to mother again?” Blaise put his hands in the air again. “What? She’s a nice bird. And from what I’m hearing, you’re getting nice with Harry as well.” Blaise raised his eyebrow and Draco knew he was in trouble for not divulging Blaise in this information. “What do I hear about being nice? You know, in a fraternity you can make nice with lots of people!” Draco winced. Justin’s peppiness was a lot to handle.
“That’s a usual one for me too. Being prisoner, I mean.” He said, fumbling over his words. He wondered if Draco would really share something with him. “How do you manage it? Nightmares.” Draco asked. Harry paused. “You can’t, really. It’s something that some people say will be done with time, but they didn’t go through what we did, did they?” He turned over. “But, I’m slowly learning that a dream is what it is. Just a dream.”
What made him feel even worse was that he had started to have feelings for not just Cho, but Cedric as well. Harry had kissed Cho once... and couldn't sleep afterwards. He was even in a good mood afterwards, but it didn't matter. He shouldn't have those feelings. Which was why he didn't think he could involve Draco in any of this. If he thought about their kiss once more he was going to lose it. And Draco had thought nothing of it, instead joking about it whenever Harry brought it up. He was much more of a experienced kisser than Harry had thought. Which made Harry wonder what Draco did with all the girls who swarmed him... or Pansy.
