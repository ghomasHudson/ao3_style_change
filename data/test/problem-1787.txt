He concentrated more and pushed harder, forcing the dark cloud into a smaller mass. Then, when it was finally packed tightly together, Harry surrounded it with his own magic, blanketing it, smothering it. His magic surrounded it and grew tighter and tighter around Voldemort's magic, forcing it to recede. Finally, it just disappeared. As soon as it did, Lucius' magic fought against Harry's and thrust the invader from Lucius' body.
“Harry, that's enough now,” Draco warned, standing behind him and placing a restricting hand on his arm.
“Harry is here?!”
your voice
And Draco did. Harry sighed in relief. He turned as Molly exited the floo. She immediately enveloped him in a hug. “Congrats are due! Or, almost anyways,” she said, looking into the bedroom where Draco still lay. “How far apart are the contractions, dear?”
“Rodolphusss! What have you to sssay about your missssssion?”
Draco went over their birthing plan again and again and again, ad nauseum. Mostly it was just to himself, but he did so out loud so that Harry and Severus heard it too. Snape wanted to take his paperwork to the Staff Lounge or the Great Hall to plan for the new school year. However, it was partially his job to stay nearby for when Draco went into labor. All he really needed to do was call Madam Pomfrey. From there, the mediwitch would take over and the whole thing would be done with in no time.
His placid attitude over everything shocked everyone in the room, Hermione most of all. She quickly followed him, questioning him until they were far out of hearing range of the young Slytherin.
“I’ll ask Theresa.” Blaise left to ask Theresa if Harry could move around. When he came back, he started helping Harry up. “As long as it’s slow and easy, she says. And no moving about until tomorrow. Conjure anything and everything you need until then.” Harry nodded and slowly made his way down the hall to his room with Blaise’s help. “Is there anything you need while I’m here?” Harry shook his head. “Do you want me to stay?” Again, Harry shook his head. “You know where my room is. Call Kipper if you need her.” Blaise walked out, taking one last look before he closed the door behind him.
“I didn’t mean its first or second names. I meant its last name,” she clarified. “Were you going with Potter or Malfoy?”
“Harry! Calm down!” Blaise interrupted with a slight shake to Harry’s shoulders. “Just go along with it for now. At tomorrow’s graduation, just talk to Draco. He’ll understand. He loves you and you love him. I know. Just, take a deep breath and we’ll get through this. Let Colin spread his rumors and go live your life with Draco. Who knows? Maybe this is a good thing. If they think you’re with me now, they won’t be focusing on you and Draco anymore.”
“Both of you shut up!” Draco snapped, wielding Harry’s wand into silencing them both. “I will deal with you later, Father. And you, Weasley, Harry will deal with later. Get out of my room!” With a burst of magic, he warded the room from Weasley’s presence, allowing the magic to push the redhead out into his professor’s sitting room. “Father, help me into that chair there.” Stunned, the elder Malfoy did as told.
“He sure is happy to dole them out,” Snape murmured, then fled the Headmaster’s office with a whirl of his robes. It was completely ludicrous that he had to
“No,” Lucius whispered, his head falling back in defeat. “Don’t... don’t be... like... me.”
“A quintaped?!” Madam Pomfrey gasped.
he repeated.
“Could you go in there and tell Harry that if he needs anything, he only has to ask me?”
“Look at some of these names!” Draco crowed. “Acton? Adair? Africa?! Who names their child after a continent?!” He flipped a few pages ahead. “Bogart! Ha ha ha! Can you imagine naming our son or daughter Bogart?! Bonadventure. Bonner. Botham. Boys?! How horrid!” Another few pages slipped past. “Frye? Fuchsia? Fulk? What is wrong with these people?! Oh no! Norina. Nowles. Nubia. … Saffron?! Sage?! You’re not making dinner, you’re making a child! Sammy. Sargent. Sassy?! Sayer. Seal. Senga. Look, I may or may not have weird family names,” Harry silently snorted at this, “but these names are ridiculous. Is this a muggle book? Please say this is muggle! I bet Granger gave this to you.”
“If you’re not gay, Blaise, then why did you marry Harry?” Dr. Morris asked.
“No, I mean like a rock hard. Feel for yourself.” He held one of Harry’s hands over where he’d been massaging and just waited for a moment. When McKay kicked, Harry hissed softly. “Harry? What was that?”
Harry conjured a pen and paper, then reached out for the vial. Carefully uncorking it, he wafted the scent for a moment, writing down a few things. He thought for a moment, then wrote down two more ingredients. He moved the vial closer to his nose this time and passed it under it a couple of times before writing down four more ingredients. He suddenly made a coughing motion, but didn’t make a sound. Quickly, he corked the vial, wrote down two more ingredients, and thrust the vial and the paper back at Snape with a glare.
Harry slowly stood and moved behind Draco so he was cocooned in warmth and love. One of Draco’s hands moved back to grab a fistful of Harry’s cloak to bring him closer, but wouldn’t let Snape step back either. The blonde held the other two close, despite how much they hated each other. After a few more moments like that, Draco backed away. He laughed softly. “Sorry. I guess I’ve finally hit the mood swing stage. Three months next week you know.”
Poppy seemed to think about that for a moment. “Okay. Yes, I can see that as well now. Five months of living moment to moment. Yes.” She trailed off lost in thought. Harry tried to think something to her, but she wasn’t paying attention to the parchment. A light touch to her forearm startled her from her thoughts. “Oh! Sorry Harry. You startled me. What is it dear?”
They were all quiet for a moment before Dr. Mitchsens spoke up. “I believe that a doctor who knows about male pregnancies would be best, of course. You and your husband will need the best of care and state-of-the-art of everything. I, personally, would tell the both of you everything straight up: care, warnings, news for the better or worse. I would not keep anything out, despite how small I think it is. If at all possible, I would cater to your every whim when it comes to your husband’s care,” he concluded.
Severus nodded. “Yes. That might work just fine. I cannot think of a potion in which tungsten is an issue. High melting point, relatively attractive, not malleable or weak. Yes, this will do.” He clasped the bracelet to his left wrist.
“Draco, we’ve been over this. Childbirth is a process. To mess with the process invites complications. The child will tell us when they are ready. With women and with men carriers, that ready moment is revealed through contractions. As you get closer and closer to five minutes, you’ll feel an urge to push. That tells me it’s time to act. If you were a woman, we’d begin the true labor process. Since you’re a man, I’ll get ready to retrieve the child myself. No worries! You’re not my first. Certainly won’t be my last. Oh! How long between those two now?”
She turned her back to them, doing some shuffling and clinking before turning back around with a vial in her hands, swirling it as one would a good glass of wine. “When it turns sky blue I will need some of Draco’s hair and some of Blaise’s hair to determine the paternity.”
“Fine. Basics only.”
After taking a sip, Draco smiled to Harry and continued. At the start of our seventh year, this past year, nothing was any different than it had been. On September 4th, we went to Care of Magical Creatures out on the grounds. Hagrid had procured several hippogriffs for the class. It wasn’t the first time he’d done so; we knew the rules for the beasts. But Harry and I had gotten into a fight and carried it over into class. We insulted one of the hippogriffs-”
Snape stared him down. He looked so calm and in control, but Harry could see the signs of the toll the pain was taking on him. The trickle of sweat at his temple; the twitch in his left eye; the muscles spasming in his arm. If he didn't act soon, the damage might be irreversible.
“I miss him,” she whispered. “It’s just not the same without him. He’s had training before, loads of times. Do you remember that time last year, when Moody came in to train him to keep his mind off Sirius? They trained four times a week in the Room of Requirement. Why couldn’t they do that this time? Hogwarts is the safest place for anyone right now. We have everything we need, and Harry knows this castle better than anyone. We have the Marauder’s Map. Ron! The Marauder’s Map! Maybe Harry really is still at Hogwarts and they just told us he wasn’t so that Voldemort wouldn’t be tempted to attack. Come on! We have to get it and see!”
“Sev!” a voice called out. “Sev, is he okay? What happened? Is he alive? Did they hurt him? I just got here. What is that? Who cares? What about Harry? He’s alive, right? They didn’t hurt him? If they did I’ll kill them all. The prophecy may have been for Harry, but I’ll kill Voldemort if he hurt him. Is he okay? What happened? He is alive, isn’t he?”
He also loved Harry’s hand at the small of his back. It rubbed and kneaded just when and where he needed it to. All without him telling his lover. Of course, just lying there meant he had a lot of time to think. So he thought about their marriage. It was an old hand fasting, something his father would have flipped shiz about had he witnessed it. Draco smiled. That was okay with him. Of course, thinking about his family got him upset. He wanted to see them again, even if it was only to be ridiculed and disowned before Harry jumped in to save him from their painful words. He wanted to see his mum, and his father. Severus had said that Lucius had tried to warn him, that he didn’t want his son to go through the pain and suffering that he himself went through. Surely that counted for something?
I know this has kinda been done before, but it was
“If I may, Mr. Weasley?” Dumbledore asked, reaching across his table for the parchment. Ron freely gave it. “I would like to see the Forbidden Forest please,” he asked the map. After a few seconds, he continued with, “All of the Forest if you please.” Another few seconds of silence. “It will not show me anything but the edge surrounding the school.”
Harry signed.
Albus merely steepled his fingers and eyes the pacing Potions Master before him. “Severus, come now. You know it’s not feasible to give them their own rooms. With young Mr. Malfoy pregnant and in his second trimester, he needs someone to look out for him. Someone who can freely communicate, and preferably someone with medi-wizard training, to be on hand in case something happens. It’s why you were chosen.”
“Are you okay? What’s wrong?” Draco asked, placing a hand on his arm. “You’ve been sitting there, silent, for nearly ten minutes now. You must have been thinking about something terribly important. And you haven’t spaced like that in a long time. I’m curious as to who else felt that wave of magic you just sent out.” Draco smiled and placed a hand on Harry’s arm. “Why don’t you–? Harry? What’s wrong?” Now he was concerned.
She walked into the Potion Master’s office without knocking and started to explain the situation in half sentences and jumbled up words. Severus, knowing it was better to just let her ramble than try to stop her, merely went back to grading the seventh years’ thesis for their midterm reports. So far, he hadn’t wanted to violently kill anyone. There were a few close calls, but nothing definite yet. Of course, he hadn’t gotten to the Gryffindor papers yet, so that may have been-
“You mean you don’t know where we’re going?!”
Harry decided to use the spell to write in the air in front of Draco so he wouldn’t have to move from his lounging position curled up behind his mate.
“He’s… making a slashing motion across his neck and drawing circles on his left forearm. Now it looks like he’s raking his fingers across his face. He’s holding his right hand over his heart. He’s taking his first two fingers on his right hand and moving them over his right cheek. That’s it. What’s it mean?”
Draco was sobbing, his head hanging between his arms. Only the headboard and Harry’s prick kept him raised up as he was. It had felt so good! He didn’t know why he was crying. He was so happy. When Harry tried to pull out to see what was the matter, Draco grabbed his hip to hold him still.
“What do you mean?!”
“Would you mind sharing those standards?” Dr. Morris asked.
“Of course, excuse me! I am Jennifer Morris. I’m sorry, there are too many of you. Who is who and why are you here?” she asked.
“Severus!” Draco cried, dropping his sweat-drenched head back on the pillow. “You made it!”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
Before the teacher took it, I read what he wrote.
“But things change, Blaise. Ask him again.”
“Oh, we have a pretty good idea when that event took place.” Harry and Draco smiled at each other, Harry giving Draco a warm hug for added comfort. “Anyways. I’m sorry about the emotional bit. I know it comes with the territory of being preggers, I just didn’t expect it to be so… so… fluid. I just went from happy to bawling sad in no time at all!”
“No Blaise. Thank-you. Harry?”
And with that, the first interview was done.
“Come on. I’m not as big as a hippogriff yet.” Harry quickly climbed into bed beside Draco and held him close, letting the feel and smell of Draco relax him. Without realizing it, he was quickly asleep. “You were more tired than you thought,” Draco whispered. “Just relax, and let me watch out for you this time.” He kissed the top of Harry’s head, hoping Harry a sleep without nightmares for once.
Harry jerked his hands free from Draco’s, which was still covering them, and gestured to his boyfriend. “He says his senses are already strengthened more than necessary, Severus. He doesn’t need a potion.”
“I’m not helping that git–!”
Harry shrugged, a bit sheepish.
“Ah, you know all about that already. She's driving me nutters. Almost makes me wanna bat for the other team, eh? Pregnancy hormones are a killer!”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“What is a blibbering humdinger?” Dimitri asked.
“A bunch, okay?”
PLEASE REREAD CHAPTERS 6 AND 7 BECAUSE I POSTED THEM OUT OF ORDER ORIGINALLY AND NOW THEY'RE FIXED!!!
There was really nothing left to do but wait, and neither Harry nor Draco were any good at that. Bedrest was a chore. Sleeping was a chore. Being awake was a chore. Having to pee all the time was a chore. Eating was a chore. Breathing was a chore. Draco whined constantly. His chest was heavy and sore despite the lack of mammary glands that usually accompanied the feeling. He was having hot flashes and cold sweats. When he was hungry, he couldn’t determine what he wanted. Usually he was just craving something to chew on to stay busy. Harry had taken to conjuring ice chips.
chapter? I rather liked it. It was a bear to write, but I think it was a good one. Let me know what you think in a review please!
Ron gasped behind her. “No way! There’s no way that… Harry… He is, isn’t he?” he asked, watching the faces of the adults around him. “Sweet Merlin. They’re lost in the Forbidden Forest and you didn’t tell us?! We’re his best friends! We deserve to know what’s going on! We should be looking for him! Let’s go!”
!” She threw herself on her best friend when she saw he was awake, aware, and standing. “Oh, how I’ve missed you! Are you okay? How do you feel? Do you need to sit down? How long have you been awake? Are you hungry? Are you hurt? Do you need anything?”
Sit up slowly, and I’ll help you to Theresa’s room.” He helped Harry up and then helped him down the hall to Theresa’s. Every time there was a contraction, they stopped until Harry nodded to go on. Blaise knocked on Theresa’s door and called out to her. “Theresa?! Harry’s in labour! Time to wake up!” Theresa was there in a heartbeat. “He was complaining of McKay kicking him too hard so he came to see me. When I was trying to soothe his stomach, he suggested it may be contractions. We came to see you immediately.”
But the whole week looked normal. There were two appointments for the whole week. One was on Tuesday; that was the one for Harry. He had needed to have an evaluation with the head Auror to go over how he was doing and if there was anything he wanted to discuss. The other was on Wednesday; that was the one for Draco. He had gone out with some friends to have a few drinks or whatever.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Apparently he didn’t because he saw that and then left, not telling anyone where he was going. Harry started to freak out. I told him I’d pretend to be his fiancé until we found Draco and explained things to him. But Draco didn’t want to be found, so we took our plans a step further. I married Harry to keep his pregnancy under wraps. We sleep in separate rooms in the same hallway in case he needs something. I hired one of the best medi-witches around to live here. She promised to keep everything quiet since this is Harry Potter.”
“It looks just fine to me baby,” Harry said.
“I am Blaise Zabini. I am under Veratiserum. I am the current husband, but wish to part with my husband in favour of bettering his life, his future husband’s life, and their child’s life. The child is not mine. I do not work either, currently, but was actually looking into a job just near where we were living in France. That’s not important, is it Dr. Morris?”
“Oh,” was all the nurse could think of as a reply.
“By all means, Mr. Potter-Malfoy,” Pomfrey said. She stepped back to allow Harry closer to the bed where Lucius and Snape were standing.
“That’s because you couldn’t see it under my robes. Most brides wear a blue garter or something of the sort. I got close enough I figured.”
Throughout the day, things were normal. He pushed papers, had lunch with co-workers, went over reports from a raid he and his team had done last week. He spoke with Tonks about Remus, and then reminisced about the “good ol' days” when everyone was together. They didn't mention the reason everyone was together was to take out a megalomaniac trying to take over the world.
“Okay.” He looked at the door once more before going to his own rooms. The next day was the same, and the day after that, and the day after that. Sunday evening, Harry brought McKay down of dinner in the dining hall. “Harry, how nice to see you. That’s a weird thing to say considering we live in the same house. Would you like something to eat?” He received a nod for an answer. Harry sat where he normally would and kept McKay in his lap the whole time. When he was done, he left the dinner table and returned to his rooms. The next day, he didn’t come out.
It was weird to hear the man refer to himself by name. It took a second for them to actually pay attention to what was being said by the unconscious man.
“Once your father let us know there was something wrong in Professor Snape’s room and Hermione let us know something was mortally wrong with Harry, the obvious conclusion was to come here via emergency floo,” the headmaster interjected before a fight could break out. “You know the rest since you were here. What of the past may I share with Miss Granger, Draco?”
Not much of a boyfriend
“Molly and Arthur. Professor Sinistra. Twins… Female twins. Oh, the Patil twins.” Harry pointed over to the other side of the crowd. “Male twins, for the Weasley twins. Hagrid. Oliver. Jack. Katie. Make sense to you now?” he asked everyone in general. Several people started talking at once to each other and to Draco. Nothing made any sense.
your arse and
“Of course.” He turned, and stalked out of the Headmaster’s office back to the dungeons. When he arrived, he immediately knocked on the slightly open bedroom door that would lead him to his godson. “The headmaster has agreed to the outline of things, with details to come. He will ask Poppy to witness and Minerva to stand with Potter this afternoon, and will floo in after dinner with their answers. Have your details ready to hand to him by then.”
Harry just looked at Draco. “Harry lost his glasses right around Christmas. He took them off when he went to sleep, put them close by like always. But then it snowed. It snowed heavily. Because it was such a heavy snow, I woke him and we moved. Neither of us noticed he didn’t have his glasses until we’d found a new spot to rest at. We tried to find the spot the next day, but couldn’t. His magic was slowly starting to fix his eyes so he wouldn’t have to rely on me for everything.
“You honestly thought we forgot, didn't you?” Draco said with a chuckle. “You really thought that your friends and family and co-workers forgot that you turned twenty-one today. Harry, you're famous! There are kids sitting at home right now wishing you a happy birthday.” He turned his dark-haired lover around to look into his eyes. “You foolish man,” he murmured and then kissed him long and hard.
Harry looked at Draco and then back at Poppy.
With gentle thrusts, Harry brought himself to completion within the blonde, tweaking Draco’s sensitive nipples at the same time. He wouldn’t be able to make Draco come again, but it would still feel good. And if the moans were anything to go by, it surely did.
are the best species of caterpillar to use and were the type used for this specific potion. Therefore, and I quote, ‘I win’. He’s right, the little bugger. We have to get these caterpillars special from the United States simply because the
“Ooh! Does that mean you’re thinking of us staying here? Because I like it here,” Harry said in between bites of fried ham. “This is really good Blaise. Is there anymore?”
From his crib in the next room, Corvus was staring at his parents with wide green eyes. His blonde hair was an absolute mess, just like Harry’s.
“Of course. It is ill-becoming a pureblood to do otherwise,” Snape sneered. “Draco also wishes a few decorations… in the Great Hall. Will the proper warding be manageable? It will have to be after the other students have gone on to bed, of course, but Draco says he is tired of being confined in my chambers. I told Potter to curb Draco’s enthusiasm before I left. He might have succeeded…”
“Hello Blaise,” Draco said, completely emotionless. He looked over where Blaise had looked and his muscles tensed for a brief moment. “I see you and Harry are perfectly happy together. Congratulations are in order, I guess.”
“No word, no news. I would like to know even if it’s just to say ‘Sorry kids. We have been investigating some people, but nothing has turned up.’ That would be better than nothing!” she sobbed. “I need him, Ron. I just… I can’t understand there not being the three of us. I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s so weird not having him around. He missed Christmas, Ron! He had presents waiting for him. I waited for him. I just want-”
The male doctor walked into the room and immediately seized Harry’s hand, pumping it furiously. “Mr. Potter, I mean Mr. Zabini it is a pleasure to meet you. I just want you to know that any care you receive from me will be the best this field has to offer. I’ve been working with male pregnancies for nearly twenty years, and my own wife has had four children in the past twenty years.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
!” he called back, obviously saying the last two words in a sarcastic manner. “I want nothing to do with them! They’re all the same anyways: I want to help
Man, I think I’m on to somethin’,

“Other than Potter being mute and blind, and Draco being pregnant you mean.”
“Magical depletion takes a fair amount to accomplish,” Ron stated in a normal tone of voice. Everyone’s head swivelled to see who had spoken; the adults had forgotten about the two young Gryffindors and Draco had not noticed their entrance due to his relief that help had finally come. “I know Harry’s powerful, but what did he do in such a short amount of time that his magic is nearly gone?”
As if on fast forward, his time in the Forbidden Forest ran through his head. The changes in Draco were so gradual at the time, but so obvious now. Draco was not the only one changed by the ordeal. Harry had undergone many changes himself, mostly due to his loss of vision and speech. Giving Draco his wand should have further hindered him, but it only made him stronger. That was another matter. His wand working for Draco so easily.
“Where do you think you’re going? Hagrid told us to stay right here.”
“That has nothing to do with the Mark,” Malfoy said. “It’s his war–”
Harry sat against the headboard and pulled Draco’s head into his lap so he could play with his husband’s hair. The strokes lulled the blonde to sleep, something he had trouble doing for long periods of time now. Between the discomfort of his belly and the need to pee every half hour, Draco had been taking naps off and on throughout the day rather than sleeping a full eight hours at night.
“Yes, I’m aware I’m as full as it gets already. Now get that prick in me or so help me- YES! Right there, love. Right there! Oh yes! That’s it!” He gave a long, low groan of satisfaction as Harry rubbed across his prostate as he pulled out. He was instantly moving back in however, using long, slow movements to distract and drive Draco to madness.
Choking on a sob, Draco tried to explain. “He came b-back here and I was so upset, I railed against him. That m-made him so very a-angry. He set me straight, taking m-my ramblings and mutterings d-differently than I meant them. After he used l-l-legillimancy, he just collapsed. I caught him at first, b-but he was too h-heavy for m-me and I-I had t-to dr-drop him!” He ended on a near-wail, burying his face in his hands.
“I’m having a strange sense of déjà vu,” Harry muttered. Blaise chuckled lightly and Draco looked at him with a confused expression. “When Blaise and I first got married,” a dark look passed over Draco’s face then, “he asked me what I wanted for dinner after waking from being sick because of portkeying to the house in France. I was amazed, thinking all purebloods would simply have a house elf do it for them. But Blaise said that his mum made sure he’d be able to handle all situations. And now you’re saying the same thing. Why do you know how to cook?”
“What about him? Is he pregnant as well? Excuse me for being frank, Harry, but I am a male pregnancy doctor, which means I work with wizards who are pregnant. While Blaise meets half those requirements, it is you who fits all of them. I am here to treat and care for you, not for Blaise. And I’ve told him that. It’s not him I’m worried about or for; it’s you. Should anything happen to Blaise, I can help him until a different doctor arrives. It is you I will be treating though.”
“What?! Why?” Harry asked, rocking McKay gently in his arms to get him to sleep.
“And we’ll have a white table cloth with white napkins. The napkin holders will be gold for you, the silverware silver for me. Each goblet will be rimmed in green or red, depending on the house. It will be perfect! Three Gryffindors and three Slytherins. The plates will be fine china with a combination of our house crests on it. No, not the Hogwarts houses. I mean Potter and Malfoy of course. We can even have little name cards to show where everyone is to sit. Should I do whole names or just surnames? I think surnames would work perfectly. I don’t want the professors to think I’m taking liberties with their names.
“I know that, and I won’t keep you long.” A quick look around showed too many people could overhear their conversation. “Walk with me.” They walked out of the room as calm as anyone, not drawing attention to themselves. It took a few steps, but Lucius finally started talking. “I am repaying my life dept to you, have been for some time now.” Severus’ steps faltered. “I know you are spying against the Dark Lord, Severus. Put your wand away, you fool. If I had wanted to turn you in, I would have some eight months ago. I’ve had suspicions for over a year; known about it for eight months.
Harry walked up close to Lucius, wanting to help him first. He placed one hand on his stomach and one on his forehead to ease the pain Voldemort was causing. He closed his eyes and forced his magic into the other man, searching for where the pain was striking.
“Yes. Why are you here?”
I no own, so you no sue. I don’t own any characters or settings from the Harry Potter books. Those belong to J. K. Rowling. I would be so very happy if she’d allow me the use of one or two… or three of them, but I know she won’t so don’t try anything. Thank you, that is all.
“You didn’t?” Harry asked, excited. “What did you get me? Can I have it? Please please please?!”
“–change everything! What am I supposed to do?! That’s all I’ve ever known, all I’ve ever been taught!”
“Draco is McKay’s father, and the only man I ever have and will have sex with.”
“Good. How long has this been going on, Harry?” Theresa asked.
Is that your hand on my boyfriend?
, Harry signed, then took Draco in his arms for a deep kiss. With no Dark Lord looming over their heads, he wanted to practice producing the next heir to their Houses.
The unmistakable tensing in Harry’s back and shoulders and the clenching of Draco’s hand a little tighter did not go unseen by Poppy. She kept her movements slow, with just the right amount of noise. “Good afternoon, Harry,” she greeted. “I was wondering if we could talk?” She received a curious and slightly amused look for an answer. “Oh yes, I realize that you can’t actually talk. I can get you a Quick Quote Quill, which writes based on your thoughts. Would you mind that?”
He cried out suddenly, as Harry bit down at the base of his neck along his shoulder line. It was just one of Harry’s ways of getting Draco’s attention. He must have been thinking too much. “Okay, okay,” he panted. “I’ll stop.” Harry just grinned then kissed his love, his
“Come on then. We need to tell my family. They’ll be shocked. And we can get married tomorrow. That way it stays quiet and we can be alone. We can go to another of my properties for our ‘honeymoon’. Everyone will expect it, but for us it will just be time for us to get used to one another and come up with some sort of routine. Okay?” Harry nodded. “Just be yourself and everything will be okay.” Harry nodded again and they went inside.
“How dare you imply that I am that vain?!” Draco shouted.
“Oh, please please please,” Draco chanted as he heard the cork on the vial of lube pop. “Yes, sweet Merlin, give it to me, please!”
Tersus leviter – clean gently – to remove the gunk from Corvus
“Draco!” Severus shouted, rounding on his godson. “Give your father a little credit will you? He withstood the Cruciatus Curse for near five minutes when he failed to produce you or give a reasonable excuse. He is in tremendous pain, and the potion isn’t doing much for him. He was never going to give you to the Dark Lord and you know it! He asked me to keep you from that fate, from the fate he served himself. I told you this when you first returned to us. I realize this is hard for you, Draco.”
“Indeed.” Snape raised an eyebrow and just looked at the two on the couch. “Are you serious about having a wedding? It would have to be a silent affair; no one can know about it. Albus can officiate. I will stand in for you. Minerva can stand in for Harry. Poppy can witness. No one else can know about it. The joining of Potter and Malfoy should be a wondrous occasion, but with the Dark Lord looming over us and the feud between the two of you legendary, I don’t think it would be a good idea. Maybe some years down the road, or once the Dark Lord is gone.”
“Night, Severus.” As Harry led him back to their room, he kept his hands on him at all times. “I’m sorry I scared you, love,” Draco apologized. “It wasn’t my intention. I just needed to use the loo. I’ll leave a magical trail next time, like I did in the Forest. How’s that?” His response was a nod, but Harry still wouldn’t let him go. Draco sighed. “Come here, Harry.” They crawled into bed together and Draco held him close, allowing Harry to see for himself with his hands and lips that Draco was perfectly alright. Once he reached that spot below Draco’s ear, it was all over.
“I asked what he would use, but he wouldn’t say anything. As we continued walking, I realized he kept getting a few steps ahead of me. I’d run to catch up with him, then he’d get ahead of me again. I accused him of speeding up, so he slowed down. But he kept getting ahead of me. Finally, when we were almost standing still, he looked at me funny. He said I was awfully pale. ‘Of course I’m pale,’ I spat back. ‘I’ve always been pale. It’s a Malfoy trait.’ But he shook his head and walked around me a few times. Then he shoved his hand down the back of my robes through the neck.”
!” Severus shushed harshly. “I need your Wizard’s Oath that what I am about to say will go no farther than the two of us. Do I have it?”
It really was best to just pacify Draco at this point.
After that was anybody’s guess though.
I got a review on
“Someone else? Someone who was there? A Death Eater. Why would you bring a Death Eater back to the school with you?! How could you betray Dumbledore like that?!” He turned and buried his face in Harry’s shoulder, crying his eyes out at the perceived betrayal.
Arms wrapped around him, offering him strength and comfort. While he accepted them at first, he suddenly realized that it had to be Harry. His sorrow and despair turned into a fighting need to rail against his husband and what comfort he’d gained in the last few seconds. With agility he didn’t know he possessed any longer, he whipped around and began beating his fists against Harry’s chest.
Draco lay discarded. At first, he was upset by this fact. Then Harry’s words truly sunk in.
Harry released Draco and then sat up so his legs dangled off the side of the bed, his back to Draco. It continued to stay silent, even after this.
“Thank you, Mr. Za- father.” He’d been asked to refer to them as mother and father, if he was comfortable with it. It would take some time, but he’d manage. “I’m ready whenever you are Blaise, dear.” He wrapped his arms around Blaise’s waist, then touched the portkey to activate it. The hook behind his naval nearly had him cutting off Blaise’s air supply. When they landed in the front room in one of the Zabini residences, Harry let go and said one word: “Bathroom!”
“That sounds great Harry. Where do you want to start?”
“Uh, yeah, Mum,” Ron murmured, looking away. “It was for their safety, ya know? We couldn’t say anything.”
Setting his Potions Journal aside, he asked Draco, “Did you want anything from the kitchens? I’m going to order some lavender tea.” So far, it was the only tea whose smell hadn’t made Draco nauseous.
“Nothing,” Harry whispered. He tried to leave.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
A second or two later, he was returning the kiss. They pulled apart and Harry stormed off to the Gryffindor common room. That night, Draco had found Harry in the hallway after curfew. They stumbled into the Transfiguration classroom and snogged for a few hours. Three nights later, Harry was begging for Draco to take him. From that moment on, they became lovers. It took a little while for the relationship to move past mindless shagging and into something akin to love, but eventually it did. Now the boys were inseparable.
“A whole plateful minus three pieces and the one you just ate.”
Harry merely gestured with his hand and the charms were set. Draco, meanwhile, never ceased talking and moaning. “I can feel it, Harry, can you? I’m so ready. I’m going to come on your tongue alone. You’re amazing. You’re perfect. No one else can do this to me, only you.”
“We are well, Harry,” Draco said with a smile. “We have talked much. He is truly upset at the pain he has caused me throughout my life due to his being the Dark Lord’s lackey. I had him explain his place in his army, and he told me everything. We are careful not to let him leave the castle, as we are still unsure of my mother’s true intentions. I’d like to think she is the same as my father, but if that were true, surely she’d have come here seeking sanctuary as well?”
“It is to me,” Harry answered, his face still buried.
“Please? Sing it, and then you’ll understand.”
“Anyways, what you need to do is get the marriage annulled.”
“Twenty-seven. I know who each one of them were, and I do not wish to disclose who they were.”
The question startled the witch. “Why do I want the job, Mr. Zabini? Because I am one of the foremost experts in male pregnancy and I believe that, under my care, everything will run smoothly for your first child.”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
“Hey! I would like for the record to state that Draco Malfoy is a vain ponce!” Harry said.
so that I may read in peace!” He stormed out, slamming the door shut behind him.
“I don’t have anything to say to you, Granger.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“Well, if that’s what you want dear. Your father and I will have no problems with that. We’ll owl you the paperwork to change the name from us to you two. Enough of that. How’s my son-in-law? You mentioned a medi-witch was living with you? Is everything okay? No one was hurt were they? I’ll insist you come home if you or Harry are hurt now.”
“Potter stop!” Snape cried out, grabbing Draco by the arms and pulling him toward him to look at him closely. Harry and Draco both froze, and look of shock and confusion on Draco’s face and one of loathing on Harry’s. “Your nose is bleeding, Draco. You can’t play so rough. You could get hurt. Or the baby. Here, use this until I can get a Blood Clotting Potion.” He handed Draco his handkerchief and made for his personal rooms. As soon as Snape let him go, Harry pulled him back to him, signing
“I am fine, simpleton! I said there is someone in the infirmary who needs this, not me.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Just as he went to turn away, a faint clicking sound was heard. Wand immediately in hand, Snape turned back to the door to see the knob twisting and the door opening so very slowly. He peeked in to see what was going on, only to find the two boys in bed, Harry curled around Draco. Then Harry’s eyes opened and looked directly at him. The message was clear, and the arms tightening around the sleeping blonde only cemented it.
“Well, of course. You are Harry Potter.”
“There are some things we need to tell them, Draco,” Dumbledore admonished. “A basic overview, perhaps?”
“Yes, your majesty,” Blaise answered with a deep bow before scampering off to pack his belongings.
Also from the Malfoy family, a personal house elf to take care of the baby. Harry wasn’t so sure about that last gift. The only real experience he had with house elves was Dobby, Winky, and Kreacher. None were exactly promising. But the longer this elf was around, the more Harry grew accustomed to it. It was very helpful to Draco. Being a nanny elf, it knew what expecting mothers needed most. Sometimes, she even knew what Draco needed before Harry did. She didn’t seem to mind when Draco suddenly changed his mind and needed the whole nursery moved around, repainted, new furniture, etc. Harry had learned not to interrupt his nesting husband and certainly not to question his choices.
that actually made me think of this. So, if I’ve offended you by semi-stealing your story just let me know and I’ll take it down. Her fic was
Harry blushed slightly.
“That is better. Are you capable of controlling yourself now?” In all his black glory, Severus Snape stood towering over his godson with an almighty scowl on his face. “Your husband was most insistent in gaining my attention and my help. I would appreciate it if it was not a repeated incident.”
Condicio cerebrum – condition brain – checking the status of Corvus’ brain
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“I assume you are referring to Harry Potter?”
In the time that Harry lay unconscious on his bed, Draco tried to come up with a future. They needed to complete schooling, that was for sure. They weren’t too far behind, thank goodness. It was only their seventh year that would need to be retaken. But with their money, private tutors wouldn’t be a problem. And his father was completely supportive of the two of them. That made things a bit easier.
“That’ll have to wait, professor,” Harry snarled, pushing the man out of the way as he advanced on the Dark Lord. “I am really sick and tired of you trying to kill me. It gets old after a while, ya know? You couldn’t beat me as a baby, you couldn’t beat me as a teenager, you won’t be able to kill me as an adult. I wasn’t even fully trained those first times you came against me! I’m still not! And yet, you never win. I have to kill you now because you’re an annoying thorn in my side. And because you threatened Draco. You see, I can’t have that happening. So while I
Harry nodded. “Why are you here?”
After a few quiet moments of flipping through the book and snickering, Draco closed the book. “I like the names we chose. I’m actually really glad you didn’t insist on name It after your parents. I’m also really happy you’re honoring the Black family tradition of using constellations for names. I think Cassiopeia Alexia and Corvus Armand are lovely names to add to the Black family tapestry. I think they’ll make all our family names proud.”
“Mother!”
And Harry James got caught passing me a note
“Exactly! May I borrow the memory?”
The professor left, leaving Madam Pomfrey to debate on whether or not she wanted to fight Harry on the sleeping matter. When he turned hardened eyes on her, she sighed and held up her hands in defeat. “I concede. For now,” she amended. “It will come time for you and Draco to sleep at the same time, you know. It can’t always be like this. But for now, I will allow this. Goodnight Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter.”
Before the teacher took it, I read what he wrote.
Having gotten absolutely nowhere with Draco, Harry turned to the only other person who could talk to his husband: Severus Snape.
“As for our robes, I think simple would be best. Our eye colour! Perfect! You look best in green anyways, you Slytherin in disguise. And I’ll wear silver, but not that shimmery, shiny stuff. No, that won’t due at all. Silver hemmed in black. You as well, hemmed in black. I think barefooted. Would you mind being barefooted, Harry? It’s an old tradition, one that’s rarely used anymore. But I’d like to use it. And we’ll join names at the alter, Malfoy and Potter, to become Potter-Malfoy. We agreed on that, right? You don’t want it to be Malfoy-Potter? Harry? Harry, are you listening?”
“Am not!” Draco argued back.
“I believe that is my part of the story,” Hermione cut in. “Harry spelled six charms two years ago, or so. Two for each of us. My necklace has a charm for Ron and a charm for Harry. Should either be in mortal peril, the charm will burn. It cannot truly hurt the wearer, but it is uncomfortable. Whatever has happened these past six months, his charm has turned warm many times.” Here, Draco scoffed. “But today’s was a searing pain, white hot. It was unlike any other time we’d felt it burn before.”
. Now then, how to kill you? Professor Snape? You wouldn’t happen to have that potion on you, would you? You see Tom,” he began, “Snape is a spy in your ranks. He’s been spying on you for me. And Draco too, kind of, since he’s not official. We came up with a potion that will bind your soul to your body so I can kill you and you won’t come back. Thank you professor.”
“I will have you know, Granger, that I was completely heterosexual before the whole Forest issue came about.” He looked over at Harry who was making hard and fast gestures of his own. “As was Harry, apparently.”
“Your father is the Dark Lord’s… lover, for lack of a better term. When the Dark Lord orders him to, he drops trou and bends over. He’s been doing it for years now, long before you were bourne. The Dark Lord told him that he wanted you to take your father’s place, that your father was to start conditioning you to be the perfect whore. He came to me after we’d been dismissed and begged me to keep you away, that he knew I was a spy and this was me repaying my lifedebt for him not telling about my spying. I told him you were lost in the Forbidden Forest, but that I would keep you away. And now that I know you are able to carry, there’s no way I will allow you to go back there and become his… brood mare. Not even as a spy like me.”
Harry rolled over suddenly and looked at Draco in shock. “Then why...?” He took in the things Draco was holding in his arms. Flowers, candy, and alcohol. Harry knew he was a sap, but he didn't know that Draco knew him that well. Okay, that's a lie too. After five years, he had expected Draco to know him that well. And he was upset when Draco hadn't even mentioned his birthday.
“Harry, I will explain everything I am doing as I do it, okay? I’m going to scan Draco again, deeper this time. This will tell me more specific findings, things like how he broke his wrist, how deep and infected the laceration in his leg is, when he conceived his child. I am assuming this is also your child, is that correct?” Poppy asked carefully, moving her wand to perform the scans she said she would. One eye was kept on Harry as he nodded in confirmation. “Do you know when it was conceived?” He nodded again. “I’m going to conjure some parchment and a quill, Harry. Can you write everything that happened for me?” He waited a moment, then nodded.
Harry had been writing back and forth with the Headmaster to come up with a plan to deal with the publicity of the attack, the results, the pregnancy, and his marriage. He was mostly worried about the fallout from his marrying a ‘death eater’ and what might happen to Draco. Harry had always hated the press and how they were so fickle when it came to him – one day he was The Boy Who Lived, Savior of the Wizarding World and the next he was the next Dark Lord or some crazy wizard who couldn’t control his magic or who knew what else they’d come up with in his absence.
The two men stared at the door in silence, then looked at each other. Harry shrugged, signaling his willingness to let the argument end. Draco sighed dramatically and rolled his eyes, but he too conceded. “Don’t think this means you won, Potter,” he quipped.
“Well it’s true,” Theresa muttered. “Harry I want you to push for me, see where that gets us.”
“You wanted to sleep with Blaise?!” Draco yelled. “You
“Yes Harry, if you wanted to. We have multiple properties, but this one was the farthest one away from England and away from all the press that seems to be your shadow. I thought you might enjoy the reprieve.”
“Harry, that’s great!” Blaise grabbed Harry and pulled him toward him in a hug. Harry returned it, utterly ecstatic now that someone else knew. Blaise set him down and Harry put one hand on his stomach again. They both smiled before Harry stood on his tip-toes and kissed Blaise’s cheek. Suddenly, there was a slight thud on the ground. Both looked over toward the main entrance to the Great Hall only to see Draco’s back and a little black box lying on the ground. Slowly, Harry walked over to the box, picked it up, and opened it. Inside sat two silver rings: both slightly thick silver banded with an emerald and a ruby on each.
“This is ridiculous,” Hermione hissed, slapping some turkey on her wheat bread. “They said they’d keep us informed. This is not keeping us informed! He’s lying!” Ron turned his head to look at the faculty table, but nothing looked out of the ordinary to him. “His eyes, Ron, his eyes. They weren’t twinkling when he made that announcement. It means one of two things: they’ve given up, or they found him and there’s no hope. I say we go see them after lunch. I will demand answers every week if that’s what it takes.”
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
“Regardless, Poppy prescribed it and I am giving it. Don’t argue.”
“Weren’t you paying attention this morning? All the potions classes were cancelled. We’re to go to the library and continue our research projects.” Hermione took a bite of her sandwich and chased it with a swig of Pumpkin Juice. “That means he’s been called or they’re having a meeting with Professor Dumbledore. I say we wait about five or ten minutes, then burst into his office again. Otherwise, we’ll never get answers.”
“Yes, of course.”
“I just got here. I heard you talking and decided to wait to knock,” Snape answered, opening the door. “May I enquire as to the topic of conversation?”
“His vision?” Luna asked. Harry was looking right at her, so she was confused.
shortly. Suffice to say, Harry and I are married and we are expecting our first child. We do not yet know the gender. I am due next month, after Harry’s birthday.”
The elf jumped off of her stool in the corner and rushed toward the pool/bath Draco was in. “Yes, Master Draco, sir?”
But they’d need to come to some kind of agreement sooner or later.
Draco stood at the side of the crib and looked down into it. A simple mattress with a tiny pillow, a knitted baby blanket, and Draco’s old stuffed crup lay waiting for It to arrive. There were two outfits on the rail of the crib, one in soft green and one in soft purple. The couple was trying to avoid House colors as well as the obvious blue for boys and pink for girls. Not that they didn’t have blue and pink, dark green and bright red stuff for the baby. Just … trying to keep it to a minimum.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She wouldn’t do that Harry,” Blaise said with a smile. “A divorce is just as scandalous as the true story in this case. Not only would we be ridiculed, but she and father as well. No, she wouldn’t do that. Besides, she likes you.”
“I see.” Harry smiled softly. “And who was I before I changed my name?”
Harry nodded, his cheeks slightly pink.
“I do love him, Father. It may have started out as survival, but it is now... I love him.” He looked straight into his father’s eyes as he said this, not backing down for any reason. This was an issue he would not be moved from. These were his feelings, his thoughts, his life here; not his father’s, not his professor’s, not anyone else’s. It seemed his father understood this, because his eyes shifted back to the prone form on the bed.
“Draco! They're our guests.
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
Everything had been set up as Draco had dictated. As Draco was one for tradition, he demanded that Harry not see him the night before or the day of their wedding until they met at the alter. Harry was not okay with these demands however. It caused a large argument, half silent though it was, and ended with Harry being stunned and then potioned to sleep. He would not let Draco out of his sight, much less for an entire night and day. No, the protective Gryffindor was having none of that. So Snape drugged him. Another room had been added onto their quarters for the time, so that Harry could stay in his coma and Draco could work with Dumbledore and Pomfrey on wedding plans.
“Harry and I never slept together,” Blaise said. “We want our marriage annulled so Harry can marry Draco and change McKay’s name to Malfoy, since he is a Malfoy. But, no one will believe that we haven’t had sex since we’ve been together over a year and a child was born. We need you to take a paternity test for McKay and a Veratiserum test for Harry and me to prove this is the truth. Can you do that? And stay silent about it?”
Draco was silently sobbing, tears running down his face unchecked. “Corvus Armand Potter-Malfoy,” he announced in a whisper. “You made it. You’re here. My beautiful boy, you’re here. Harry! Look at our son!” He carefully turned the baby’s head so he could look at his father.
Draco laughed softly. Harry had always been excited about presents because of his childhood. And Draco always made sure he had plenty to be excited about. “You can have it now, but we have to go down to the kitchen first. Do I need to help you get rid of anything first?”
Draco being so calm and collected was confusing to Harry. For the past two months he’d done nothing but gripe and complain, worrying himself into a stupor on occasion. Then, when the time finally comes, he’s as calm as the waters of the Black Lake. Draco wanted to sit in the rocker, so Harry helped him into it. But it didn’t last long; he said it was too uncomfortable. So they went back to bed.
“About two months ago when we stumbled upon a nundu.”
Lucius bowed. “No, My Lord.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“Bloody Hell Potter. You never do anything simple, do you?” Snape grumbled, laying his student on the ground slowly and taking his mask off.
say a word. They’ve been gone for a month now. They were given a detention with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest after fighting in his class so bad they ended up setting loose all the hippogriffs Hagrid had managed to capture for the lesson. That was after they pissed them off, I might add. They got separated, the boys from Hagrid and his mutt. And they were never found.”
“I don’t know. I was so emotional over losing Draco, because that’s what happened. I lost him. I was hysterical, not knowing what would happen to me or my baby. I grew up without knowing anything about my parents. I didn’t want that to happen to my baby as well.”
“We’re sorry, Madam Pomfrey,” Draco said, looking sheepish. “I told Harry that I wanted you to check to see if you could find out the gender of our baby today, but he said he didn’t want to know until it was bourn. We had an argument, then settled it. In the Forest, anytime we had an argument the wand settled it. We spun it and whoever it pointed to more won the argument. Sometimes that was a bad thing and sometimes that was a good thing. Either way, that’s the end of the argument. Harry won. This time.”
There was silence for a few moments. “That is quite the tale Harry. However, that doesn’t change my standings on anything I have said.”
, Draco couldn’t hardly stand anymore and sitting for long periods left him aching everywhere. He was essentially on bedrest until he gave birth. The first articles had gone over smashingly. Everyone was sending owl after owl with congratulations, gifts, and apologies for the harm done to Harry’s sight and hearing.
“Harry and I would like to set the record straight. Harry’s magic didn’t change so that his wand merely needs to be touching his skin,” he clarified. “Harry doesn’t use a wand at all. And I lost my wand in the Forbidden Forest, so I use his wand instead.” He pulled Harry’s wand from the holster on his own arm to show them. Several people gasped, then gasped again when Harry conjured a fireball in his right hand without using his wand. “All of his magic is wandless and wordless. He’s told me he doesn’t even think the spell in his mind, just the outcome he desires.”
“Draco!” he called out, running after him. “Draco, wait! It’s not what you think!” But he was gone by the time he got outside. He sank down to his knees in the Entry Hall and started crying. A few moments later, Blaise kneeled before him and pried the box from his hands. He looked inside, sucked in a sharp breath, and then looked down at his friend. “H-he thought I w-was ch-cheating on h-him!” he bawled.
And with that, another crisis was averted.
“Calm down, first of all.
“Of course!” Mrs. Zabini gushed. “Of course of course, you two just relax and enjoy yourselves. Do owl before you come back so we can have the place looking nice and be home. You know how hectic things tend to get when you least expect them to.” Harry’s face fell.
Hey! (Hey!) You! (You!) I could be your boyfriend
“I still reserve the right to look at my child and choose a different name,” Draco huffed, his hand going to his belly. “If the names we chose just don’t sit right once I see him or her, I have the right as bearer to change the name.”
“No way! I’m not letting you go back there if he knows you’re a spy! He’ll kill you!”
Silence was her answer. She looked up at a shocked Draco Malfoy, eyes wide and mouth open. “We never… We didn’t think about that. I’m having a child out of wedlock! Great Morgana, I’m a shame to all purebloods everywhere!” His eyes welled up with tears as he turned to look up at Harry. “What are we going to do? Whose name are we going to give it? What will people say? Whose heir will this be? What rights will it have to your ancestry, or my ancestry? Who-?”
“I love you too, Harry, but I don’t know if I’m ready for that. I don’t know them that well.”
So, what did you think of
(See the end of the chapter for
And Voldemort? Yeah, he didn’t stay quiet for long. Once the interviews from the couple appeared in
“Blaise!” Harry instantly said, turning to face him before turning back to the mysterious man. “That’s no way to talk-!” He froze when he saw Draco standing in the front room of the home. “D-draco?” he stammered. “Is it really you?” He didn’t wait for an answer before throwing himself at the blonde, bursting into tears. He sobbed and tried to talk as Draco led them to couches in the living room. “I thought you were gone and we couldn’t find you because you didn’t tell anyone where you were going and I was so worried and scared and mad because there was nothing for you to leave over and I cried so much and I was pregnant with your son because I’ve never slept with anyone but you even after I got married so McKay would have a name and I’m so sorry…” He kept going.
“Would you please elaborate?”
Harry shook his head in the negative after thinking for a moment.
you, I think I will imagine all the different ways to kill you.”
Nothing else though.
“I have no choice,” Severus growled, his wand still encased in a clenched fist. “Now may I go?”
“What did he write?” Draco asked, trying get a look at the paper.
It was beaten all to hell and back, as no wand should ever be. But it had survived nearly half a year in the Forbidden Forest. Before that, it had survived six years at a magical school full of teenagers. During those summers, Harry had told him that not all was well in the Muggle world. Add in that it was Harry Potter’s wand, and that means it had survived several duels with Voldemort, a run in with a werewolf, underwater adventures during the Tri-Wizard tournament, dementor attacks, and a number of other inconceivable goings-on. It was Harry Potter.
(I’ll watch you leave here limping).
Harry quickly deflated and turned to Draco, holding him close. He threw a dirty look to the man in the room over his shoulder. Madam Pomfrey began to talk to Snape in quiet tones. “I’ve told you before, Severus, that you have to be quiet and slow around Harry. He’s very skittish and very protective of Draco. If you cannot keep your temper in check, I will ask you to leave. And not allow you to return.”
However, it didn’t activate
“What was that about?” Draco asked. Harry merely lay a hand on Draco’s stomach. “Ah, I see. Okay, the detention. So Harry and I had fought in Hagrid’s class and were given detention in the Forbidden Forest as punishment. We went out with Hagrid leading the way, but it was only a few minutes before we were separated. He told us to stand still and that he’d be back in just a few moments. He’d heard something in the Forest and decided to check it out. When we could no longer hear him, I began mocking Harry. The usual.”
sitting in the gardens. They’re comforting, whether or not they’re snowed over. I have coats and heating charms on. You’re acting like my mother, which you’re also not. And you’re sure as hell not McKay’s father so just back off!” As soon as he said the words he regretted them and tears welled up in his eyes. Harry wished he had a Time Turner to go back just five minutes to make sure he didn’t say those words. Blaise had given so much to make sure Harry was okay, and then he went and said something so hurtful. “Blaise, I-”
“Severus!” he shouted. The Potions Master steeled himself and took a step forward, head bowed as the Dark Lord stopped pacing. “Why was I not made aware of the training the boy has obviously been put through?”
September second was another boring day. Severus was in classes all day. Harry was by Draco’s side. Draco was refusing to eat, again. Not even the ice chips could tempt him. Instead, he asked to get up and walk around. It was an uncommon request, but Harry helped his husband up and they made a few laps around the rooms. They ended up in the nursery, which wasn’t surprising. Anytime Harry would let him, Draco wanted to sit in the rocking chair Molly had gifted them. It was a comfortable chair.
While marking his territory, Harry’s hands moved around Draco’s front to his nipples. Through the robes, he teased the nubs carefully, aware of their acute sensitivity this late in the pregnancy. Draco loved nipple play. He could even come from it alone nowadays. But that wasn’t the plan right now. With the blonde moaning and humping the air, trying to find some friction for his hard and leaking cock, and Harry now unbuttoning his lover’s robes slowly, the pair was lost in their own world.
“You didn’t mention that last part, Potter,” Snape hissed.
“That’s none of your business!” Harry said. “And it won’t help
“No, I’m in the sitting room. Come join me for a moment?” Blaise answered.
“Harry? Are you awake?” Draco whispered, not daring to speak too loud in case it were a dream and he should cause himself to wake from it.
“I didn't realize you'd gone through so much so fast. I usually watch how much you drink.”
“Do you know where we are?”
“I thought he was going to kill me,” Blaise added.
“Hey! She's been on my tail for a kid for the last two years! I finally just did as told!”
Harry smiled at his husband, happy that he made him happy. He’d thought about naming their child James or Lily for all of two seconds. But that wouldn’t be fair to It, trying to live up to an impossible standard. The idea of naming someone after someone else just seemed to dimmish that person’s worth in Harry’s mind. Like he was trying to replace someone by naming his child after them. They did consider the middle names, as that was less of an issue to Harry. Instead, they’d gone with ancient Black family names from those relatives who weren’t Dark. Reviving a happier period of time.
Harry rubbed his fist on his chest in a circle a few times.
Draco turned the CD player off; Harry couldn’t possibly be listening anymore. In fact, Draco was sure Harry couldn’t breathe anymore. Thinking he didn’t like it, Draco took the CD out of the player, put it back in the case, and then started back to their rooms to get rid of the gift. It hurt that Harry didn’t like it. Hermione said they were some of his favourite muggle songs. He didn’t understand why Harry didn’t like what he’d done. Harry had told him several times that his voice was beautiful and amazing and that he loved it, so that couldn’t be it.
Harry arched an eyebrow. “And what does that mean?”
The here and now was important as well, of course. Getting Harry awake and aware was top priority. However, Draco was a firm believer in letting him recover on his own time. They were safe at Hogwarts, in Snape’s rooms. Everything they could ever need was here. Harry was safest here, period. As long as Voldemort was out there, Hogwarts was safe. And the day Hogwarts was not safe... It didn’t bare thinking about.
. I’ll just go back to Malfoy Manor, have the baby there. I won’t keep it from you! I swear, I’ll-”
He watched as the Gryffindor made a few quick motions to Draco. “Crucius Curse? The potion is the Crucius Curse? No, not the curse. The cure? Okay, not quite. Then it… soothes the aftershocks? Oh! It helps people who have been held under Crucio? Oh, Severus! Are you okay?!”
“Yeah, I guess. If you want to, I mean.” He moved to the other side of the large bed and Harry crawled into his spot. “You sure you’re okay?”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“So for now,” Dumbledore continued, “we will remain quiet and calm. We are doing everything we can to find Misters Potter and Malfoy without raising anyone’s suspicions. Hagrid has not left the Forest in nearly four days now. He reports back every five with information and the different parts of the Forest he’s looked. I need you two to remain calm and as if you don’t know anything. Understood?”
“What happened? When did they get here? Are they alright? What’s the diagnosis? Can you heal them? Is there any permanent damage? What is he doing?” Dumbledore asked in rapid procession.
“Are you talking about me?” came a timid whisper. Blaise and Theresa turned to look at Harry who was standing in the entranceway to the kitchen from the dining room. “You are, aren’t you? It’s okay. I deserve to be talked about. I’ve been right awful lately, and I don’t know why I do it. I’m sorry Blaise, Theresa. I just… I don’t know. I’m sorry.” He stood there, head down with his hands clasped together under his slight bump of a stomach.
“Has the child arrived?” Snape asked, quickly closing the door behind him. “Obviously not.” He crossed his arms and stood in the corner, waiting.
“Blaise, you tell me what’s going on right now or I’m coming through this fireplace.”
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
A hoard of Weasleys descended upon the castle in a sea of ginger hair and freckles. Fred and George were setting off indoor fire crackers that spelled out ‘Happy Birthday!’ and ‘Harry’s the best!’ and other such things. Ron and Hermione were sitting on a loveseat near the birthday boy, discussing their plans for the upcoming year while Harry kept an eye on Draco. Harry’s friends Neville, Luna, Dean, and Seamus were there. Gryffindors Parvati Patil (and her twin Padma) and Cormac McLaggen were too. From the Quidditch team, Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, Demelza Robins, Andrew Kirke, Jack Sloper, and Jimmy Peakes all showed up.
In a move that would have done any Seeker proud, Severus Snape twisted, turned, and manoeuvred so he had practically jumped on top of Lucius Malfoy and activated his emergency portkey to return to Hogwarts. “Incolumitas!” Before the final word could be spoken, Snape and Malfoy were jerked out of the Dark Lord’s stronghold and whisked to safety in the Hogwarts infirmary.
“Who said we needed-”
“Potter, this is a magical forest outside of a magical school. Pathways may just disappear if they want to.” He sighed and continued walking. “And before you ask, yes I am going to continue walking. Walking is better than waiting. Do you know what’s in this forest? There are-”
“A slow labor. Poor ducky. At least his mum is here with him. And I’m here for you, love. We’ll get through this just fine. I remember when your mum went into labor, you know.” Harry turned surprised eyes on the Weasley matriarch. “Oh yes, indeed. She was much like Draco, driving James absolutely nuts with her worrying and nesting and griping. But her labor was hard and fast. When you decided you were ready, you wanted out immediately. There was no time for numbing spells or even a proper mediwizard. You popped out right there in St. Mungo’s waiting foyer, you did. Nurses assisted your mother. Your father fainted on the floor, barely caught by Sirius. All of this was told to me later; I wasn’t at the hospital myself. It was such a story to hear!”
Snape blanched, but put in the order via the Floo anyways. Within minutes, the tray appeared on the kitchen table. He floated the tray to Draco after taking his tea for himself. Then he sat back down in his chair.
Snape scowled. “He said that
“Dr. Rhodes, will you verify this?”
“Damn it Draco!” Blaise stormed up onto the porch and shoved Draco against the side of the house. “You’re going to listen to me for a few minutes now. No more guessing based on what you see. That is not my baby out there with Harry so don’t even try to throw that in my face.”
invited them!”
“Fine.
“You’re not leaving just yet are you?” Harry asked.
“Harry? Are you okay? Severus, can you tell me what signs he’s making?”
“Congratulations, Draco, Harry,” Snape murmured. “I need to return to my classes. I will return before dinner.” He left quickly, before anyone could say anything about his behavior. Regardless of how he normally acted or the persona he portrayed to the public, he did truly love his godson and was excited about the baby. Not that he wanted to return to changing nappies or getting up for 2am feedings. Caring for Draco as a baby had given him all the experience he needed in that arena, thank you very much.
“Yes, I would mind,” Blaise growled.
Harry pushed Hermione off of and away from him, then started gesturing quite rapidly.
“Oh thank Merlin,” Snape breathed. He entered the room fully. “What seems to be the threat, Mr. Potter?”
“You’re… But he’s… I thought…” Poppy spluttered. “Yes, yes wake him please. I won’t keep him awake long. Can he answer my questions? Like how you’re healing him?” Her answer was a nod before Harry laid his left hand over Draco’s eyes. Slowly, Draco began to wake. When Harry finally took his hand away, Draco was fully conscious. “Good–”
So what was the issue? The problem was that Harry didn’t get happiness. Every time he got something good, it was snatched from him in an instant. Parents? Dead. Magic? Savior. Friends? Turned against him. And all the while, Voldemort was a looming shadow over them all. He was the only one that could kill the monster. How, though?! How was he supposed to kill a Dark Lord?!
Across the potions room, to the Slytherin dorms
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
The sudden bellow caught Draco unawares and shocked him from his anxiety attack.
“Draco, Love, I like the gift. I really do. It makes me happy. Those are some of my favourites. I’m guessing Hermione told you that?” He smiled as Draco started to calm down some and nod. “And I bet she taught you the spell to play it on the player too?”
“What time is it now?”
“Well that’s just bloody swell!” Ron cheered. “Voldemort won’t know what’s hit him!”
. Two fingers were three then. Careful, rough hands parted his legs a little more and brought his right leg up around a thin, naked waist. Then, a careful push forward started the long descent into pure pleasure. Draco grasped his lover by the shoulders and panted through the penetration, not hurt in the slightest. It was always slow like this, though. They may take up a pounding pace, but Harry never once rushed preparation or the first thrust.
Harry signed as he entered the room. He tended to stay out of the women’s way when they were discussing wedding plans.
, it suddenly wrote.
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
“That’s pretty much it,” Harry whispered from the doorway. “I am so sorry Mrs. Zabini. You and your husband have been nothing but nice and caring and welcoming to me, and this must just completely ruin your picture of me. I never meant for things to get this out-of-hand. I’ll understand if you wish for Blaise and I to part. I am more than capable of taking care of myself and my baby. I never meant for anything to go this far. It was just supposed to last until we could find Draco and tell him what really happened that day but now I’ve gone and ruined Blaise’s life and everything you’ve hoped for from him but I don’t love him that way and I never will and I just-”
From the two mothers the couple decided to use the Malfoy crib and accompanying mobile, the Weasley bassinet and accompanying mobile, a Weasley rattle, Draco’s first baby stuffed crup, and all the baby clothes they could get. They had plenty of boy clothing from both sides, but only Ginny’s old things in case It was a girl. They were in excellent condition and super cute. As Draco went through them piece by piece, he cried over each one. They were so adorable!
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
There was a moment of silence after Harry finished. “So what would you have me do?” Dr. Morris asked.
When Snape awoke the next morning, the contractions were only half an hour apart and still considered mild-to-moderate by the two women. With instructions to let him know when the time came, although he doubted he’d be attending in-person, Snape went off to the Great Hall for breakfast before his first class. He’d also mentioned a free period during third class during which he’d check in with them.
“I was rather hoping you would be the one to tell the tale. And maybe let Mr. Weasley rejoin us?”
Harry stared at the bouquet for a few moments longer before turning to his Head of House, placing his right fingertips over his lips, and then pulling them away. It was his sign for ‘thank-you’. McGonagall seemed to understand all on her own. They embraced for a moment, before pulling away. She started to explain other things to Harry while they waited for Draco and Snape to arrive. As soon as the doors opened, Harry turned to look at the entering pair. Draco was stunning, even with Snape at his arm. As quickly as his unbalanced body would allow him, Draco made his way to the front to stand with Harry. Snape stayed at his side.
Blaise laughed lightly. “Calm down mother. It’s a boy, and Harry’s decided to name it McKay Draconis Zabini.”
“Wouldn’t apparating be much faster?” Mrs. Zabini asked.
“You don’t care about anything! You left me and I hate you!”
“Do I look like a bloody map to you, Potter?” Draco snapped.
, was that a most beautiful thing!
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
First, he gave Draco a light massage. His fingers worked out the stress from the shoulders and down the spine. Once he got to the hips, he slowly moved his hands around to massage Draco’s extended belly then back again. His thumbs carefully dug into Draco’s bum then, massaging the globes that hid his lover’s most precious place. He poured a little more lube on his right hand and circled one finger around Draco’s puckered entrance. Slowly, he pushed the single digit inside.
“Okay, so you began to rely on one another. I can understand that. You kept one another safe and looked out for the other. I don’t understand how you became so close as to warrant a child though.”
Still more gesturing.
Harry woke with a start. He hadn’t dreamt about that night in a long time. He was sure that was the night their child had been created. Suddenly, he realized he was naked from the waist down and that there was a reason for that. Pulling up the blankets a bit, he was almost startled to see Draco going down on him. Grey eyes stared up at him before that mouth smirked around its mouthful. A few more gentle sucks and Draco eased off, slithering up Harry’s body to kiss him proper.
Harry Potter. I don’t want any of them and I don’t want you!”
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
“Still hours apart? Yes, Narcissa had a long labor as well. I’ll call her and Molly. They’ll want to be here and Narcissa can help with Draco.” He turned to make the floo calls, allowing Draco’s mother access immediately. She went straight to her son, cooing to him as he awoke. She rubbed his belly and murmured bits of fluff and nothingness to him as he rubbed his cheek against her hand.
Soon, Draco was huffing and pushing back against his husband. He needed more. He needed faster. He needed harder. And he knew Harry wouldn’t give it to him because he feared hurting the baby. Instead, he tried to take it himself. After two shoves back, Harry caught on to his plans, however, and halted his movements with his hands on Draco’s hips.
“Thank you Severus!” Draco exclaimed, flying off the bed into his godfather’s arms. “Thank you so much!”
“Draconis? As in your friend Draco Malfoy? Whatever for?”
Eventually he said, “Why not a charmed bracelet or something that will heat when you need it to? We can give on one to Pomfrey and Severus and Dumblefore.”
“Anything we could do to face off against one another was done. The dueling club in our second year, for instance, when everyone found out Harry was a Parselmouth. Classes and House points and the House Cup. Duels in the hallways, although forbidden, were a constant. I caught Harry and his friends smuggling a dragon once. Another time, meeting in secret in the Room of Requirement to train fellow students. He Polyjuiced himself as one of my friends to get into the Slytherin common room to find out if I was the heir of Slytherin in our second year.”
“That’s the problem,” Harry said. “There’s a story behind it. You might want to sit down. Before we graduated from Hogwarts, Draco Malfoy and I,” here he pointed at Draco, “were dating and involved. I became pregnant with his child. When I went to tell him, he mistook the friendly hug I was giving Blaise Zabini,” he pointed to Blaise, “as something more than friendship and left, not telling anyone where he was going. Blaise decided to save me embarrassment and married me to keep the world from finding out about my baby. We hired Doctor Theresa Rhodes as our live-in medi-witch to help with the pregnancy and delivery.”
Harry tried to rim his husband and smile at the same time, but it was difficult. So he focused on pleasing Draco instead. It made him giggle that Draco had not only become more amorous in the later stages of pregnancy, but had also developed a penchant for talking dirty. It wasn’t the norm for them, but Harry wasn’t saying ‘no’. Hearing his sexual prowess hurled back at him was another turn on of his. If he could reciprocate, he’d at least try. Instead, he put his all into his actions.
, Harry wrote in the air.
“Professor Snape,” Severus, Draco, and Luna all interrupted at once.
A red robe, a matching tie with a pony tail.
Harry was gesturing wildly, his eyes wide as he tried to give his two cents on the matter at hand. Draco tried to translate, but many of the gestures didn’t make sense to him in the order they were given and Harry was moving too fast to keep up with. He tried to slow him down, but Harry was too agitated. Not mad, just wanted to get his point across and couldn’t since he couldn’t speak.
“Goodnight Severus,” Draco murmured.
The newest Potter brat would be born.
Dr. Morris pointed to Draco. “My name is Draco Malfoy. I don’t work. I am the father of the child, and am partaking in this only to get my husband and child back. I think this is stupid, for the record.”
A notepad and muggle pen was conjured and Harry began writing. Snape continue to sip his coffee until the pad was floated up to him to read. A quick scan caused Snape to raise an eyebrow in surprise. He read through it again more slowly. It was an interesting idea, a mostly well-thought-out plan. There was no way Harry came up with this by himself. It had to be Draco’s doing.
. Harry doesn’t respond well to ultimatums.”
Both reporters nodded in acceptance.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“Go back to bed,” Snape murmured. “I have to be up in three hours.”
For the second interview, they’d gone over their ‘adventure’ in the Forbidden Forest in great detail, leaving out the too-personal bits. Even the ‘boring’ bits about walking and sleeping in shifts and finding food was discussed in depth so the readers could really get a sense of understanding what it was like out there. Harry wrote it best:
Harry laughed. “You're the one who knocked her up.”
“Like graphenes,” Luna supplied. “They send out screeches that come back and ‘show’ them the way to their prey.”
“Good morning, boys. I’ve brought you some- Great Merlin! What are you doing on the floor, Draco?! Get up! Get up this instant! It’s not good for you to be on the floor! You could catch a cold or something down there! And Harry, how could you allow him to do this to himself and the baby? I thought you were watching him more carefully. Are either of you listening to me? Boys? Boys?!”
I used to sit beside Harry Potter
“No, no I’m okay. I just can’t get back to sleep and was wondering if I could stay with you for a bit?”
So I was going to make this a short story, kinda like my other two. However, I don’t think I can make too much of it. So, yeah. It’s a one-shot now. Yeah. That works for me. If you don’t like it, stop reading. Or don’t read at all. Or continue reading, complain about it, send me flames. My response will be: all flames are put in a jar and will be used when I take over the world. Because I will one day. I just have to learn who all I want to keep around. *crickets* I mean… *clears throat*
“Only if you’ve slept together,” Draco monotoned, glaring at Blaise.
What do you think of Lucius? Do you hate my version of him in this story? Does he make sense? What are your thoughts, please?
August was a time of planning for the teachers, moving on for the former students, and boredom for the Potter-Malfoy couple. Draco slept most of the time and griped the rest of the time. If the baby didn’t come soon, Harry didn’t know what he’d do. He was already pulling out chunks of hair, it seemed. Luckily, Draco’s libido all but stopped. The nesting increased, with Draco demanding they sleep in the nursery on some nights just in case the baby came so it could immediately be in the nursery. Which made no sense, but Harry knew better than to argue.
. If all of you would just leave,” he made a sweeping motion with his arms, “I will take Harry and my dirty mouth to our bedroom where I can put both to good use.”
Son. They had a son.
Hermione and Ron appeared in the infirmary just then, faces red from having run from the lake outside where they’d been walking during a free period. Long ago, Harry had charmed medallions for his friends and himself to let each know if the other were in danger. Over the last several months, their charms for Harry had flared a few times. It was the only thing that gave them hope that he was still alive. But this was no flare. It was a pulsing heat that nearly burned their necks where the charms lay.
Harry just laughed at the way his ‘mother-in-law’ was handling things. “Thank you so much Mrs. Zabini. You don’t know how much this means to me. I thought for sure you’d make Blaise and I part for this.”
“That’s about when we realized I was pregnant,” he lied. A hand softly caressed his belly and he smiled. “It definitely wasn’t planned, but we were very happy. A baby Potter-Malfoy.” He smiled at Harry, who smiled back. “Due late August or early September, as I said. We don’t know the gender, because we want to be surprised. We’ve just been using the term ‘It’ for now. We have decided to have a renewal of vows in the spring, once the baby has come and we’ve had time to settle as a family. We’ll make an announcement about that at a later date.”
Severus cleared his throat. “Draco, I was wondering if I could speak with you on a sensitive subject.”
All eyes were on the newly-graduated teens then.
All eyes were on Ron now, red-faced and angrier than a disturbed wild fwooper flock.
. It was nothing more. The kiss on the cheek was a simple ‘thank-you for being there for me’ because you know we’re
“Oh, just happen to be on the same beach as Harry are you? Let go of me and get off my property before I call the police Zabini.” He shoved Blaise back and straightened his clothes before walking inside his home.
“I’m perfectly fine, Blaise. Theresa says I can move about as long as it’s not too fast or sudden or anything. You’re not my medi-witch. And I
“I love you too, Harryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!” Draco groaned with another contraction.
“Well, he’s never been in danger of losing his magic before, had he?” Draco snapped.
Is that your hand?
“I know!” Snape hissed, his own arm on fire. “There is nothing to do about that. We have suffered before, and we shall suffer again. It cannot last forever, surely.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“I was trying to plan a surprise, and it backfired a little bit. I was going to ask what was for dinner, say there was nothing here, and then suggest we go out. But I can see how much that hurt you, so I don't want to keep it from you any longer. I apologize; I didn't think it would affect you so much.” Draco walked forward and sat on the edge of the bed, giving Harry the items in his hands. “So, please come out with me?”
did happen. However, Dumbledore is not dead. The events of
“I don’t know what it could be. Effects from one too many Cruciatus curses? A potion? A lingering curse? A–”
Draco looked at Severus and mimed drinking to ask for some water. They should have had some ready, knowing he’d be doing all the talking. Immediately, Severus provided a glass. It gave Dimitri and Luna time to write.
One of the fireworks Fred and George set off suddenly started singing, heralding the arrival of a ginormous birthday cake sporting six layers and eighteen sparklers. The fact that each layer was a different color and the colors clashed with each other made Harry smile. The fact that the cake was leaning slightly due to the differently shaped layers was even better. It reminded him of the Burrow. Molly had really outdone herself.
“No, she told me everything I needed to know to gather the information myself. The gift was from me, not Granger.”
Harry spun him around and looked him square in the eye, signing
“Oh, and you and Harry were such a hot item!” Ron shot back, ears and nose as red as his hair.
“Fine!” Harry yelled back. “Tell her! I don’t care! I don’t care anymore, about anything! Just leave me alone!” He shoved Blaise back a bit and then slammed the door closed, locking it with several locking charms. He went back to his bed and curled into a ball to cry to himself.
“I’ll fry some ham soon for you, but first I want you to meet four of the finest mediwitches and -wizard around. In order, they are Doctors Mitchsens, Johansen, Whittier, and Rhodes. They are here to apply to be your caretaker. I know these four will be as discrete as possible when it comes to your care. Would you like to say hello?”
body!”
“Evening, Love,” he greeted, bussing Harry on the cheek as he walked by. He toed his shoes off and made his way to the kitchen. “What's for dinner?” he called out, his head buried in the fridge and his bum in the air.
Throughout the night, Harry helped Draco with massages and shuffling walks when needed. Narcissa fed him ice chips. Molly kept out of the way by knitting on the couch. She’d talk to Harry about all sorts of nonsense when Draco was having a moment with his mother. Without him knowing, Narcissa snuck a picture of him and Molly on the couch.
“Like I haven’t missed my schooling?! My Christmas?! I have missed just as much time as he has!” Draco roared, jumping from his seat. “Every day that he was wandering lost in the Forbidden Forest, I was by his side. Not you! Not Weasley! It was always me! When he was cold, it was me that gave him warmth! When he was hurt, it was me that nurtured him back to health! When he was scared, it was me that lied and told him it would be okay! Not you! Not Weasley!” Taking deep gulps of air, he paused for a moment. “And when there was no hatred left to fight with, it was me that gave him love. All of that was me. I am his life now, not you. I mean more to him than you ever could. You’re right. It is all me.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“It’s a good thing you had me take McKay,” Theresa said with a smile. “I don’t think Harry even realizes there’re other people on this planet besides him and Draco right now.” She smiled as McKay looked up at here and giggled. “And what are smiling about? Your daddy’s making a scene with Draco.” McKay giggled again. “What? Draco?” McKay giggled. “You like the name of your real daddy? Draco. Draco Draco Draco.” McKay would have fallen over he was laughing so hard if Theresa weren’t laughing so hard.
“Potter is training. Draco is recuperating from a nasty bite from his detention in the Forbidden Forest. You will be kept updated on everything that we find out. Now, I really must be going.” He turned to leave, but his arm was caught once more.
Harry conjured a pen and pad of paper and scribbled on it before handing it over.
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy,” Dr. Morris said sarcastically. “Blaise?”
“Well there's no doubt who the bottom is in
“He’s pregnant. He and Harry are together. Something’s wrong with Harry. He’s a pureblood and they’ve been back for a month, so I’m going to assume they’ve gotten married since they got here. Look, even his father doesn’t know.” Ron motioned at Malfoy senior, at the look of shock that clearly stood out on his face. “You give too much away with your emotions. That last outburst told me everything I needed to know.” He stood and started walking toward the door. “We will return when Harry is conscious, and he can fill in whatever details you both agree on. Come on, Hermione.”
Harry made slashing motions with his hands.
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
“What kind of danger did you put him in, then?” Hermione snapped back.
There was silence once more. “O-oh,” Harry finally said. “Th-that’s okay, I guess. I… I can do that. Is everything okay with McKay, Theresa?” He pasted an obviously fake smile on his face as he turned to the medi-witch.
Dumbledore began to speak. “We have come together here in celebration of the joining together of Draco and Harry. There are many things to say about marriage. Much wisdom concerning the joining together of two souls, has come our way through all paths of belief, and from many cultures. With each union, more knowledge is gained and more wisdom gathered. Though we are unable to give all this knowledge to these two, who stand before us, we can hope to leave with them the knowledge of love and its strengths and the anticipation of the wisdom that comes with time. The law of life is love unto all beings. Without love, life is nothing; without love, death has no redemption. Love is anterior to Life, posterior to Death, initial of Creation and the exponent of Earth. If we learn no more in life, let it be this.
and to Luna Lovegood for
“Chase me around the house please?” Harry asked, breathless.
“Yes sir, Master Blaise. Alls I need do is leave here.”
Harry’s face morphed into a sneer while Draco chastised his godfather. “Really now Severus, that was uncalled for. I think six is a good time. Dinner starts at seven in the Great Hall, so that gives us plenty of time to do the check-up and get upstairs. I presume Madam Pomfrey will be here as well?”
Terrified she was going to hug him, Snape sneered, grabbed each teen by a shoulder, and marched them out of the kitchen.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
he loved It and Harry and their family.
Harry returned to Draco, signing that it was done.
“Do not blather on to me! I know it is a hopeless situation! He will torture us until we die or we cut off our own arms!”
“Albus I am going to ask you to shut your trap or leave my infirmary this instant,” Poppy instructed firmly, but quietly.
Eventually Draco left.
“Great. This coming from the guy with a black mop on his head,” Draco said with a snort.
Two fingers at his entrance were hardly even noticed… until they were squirming inside him. A whole day,
“I’m okay, Hawwy,” Draco said with the kerchief shoved up his nose. “Nothing hit my nose so I don’t see why it’s bleeding. I’m sure you didn’t hurt me in any way. Severus is just being overly cautious is all. Look, here’s the potion now.” He took it from Snape willingly and then drank it down quickly. After a moment, he couldn’t feel the blood anymore. “See now? I’m all better.” He cleaned the kerchief with Harry’s wand and handed it back to Snape. “And you know I’m fine, so stop glaring at Harry.”
“I hate you, I hate you!” he cried. “You did this! This is your fault!”
“And who is ‘Fluffy’?” Snape asked.
“Hermione. And I’ll have to thank her for giving you that information.” Harry paused for a moment. Draco wasn’t mad at him anymore, he knew that. There was only one way to make up for the faux pas. A Slytherin glint came into Harry’s eyes. “Hey Draco, you wouldn’t remember the songs still, would you?”
First, he cast a magical protection sphere about himself. There was no way he would walk into a lion’s den without a weapon and a shield. Wand brandished, he poured the counter potion down the Gryffindor’s throat, then spoke the anti-stupefy hex. Harry was immediately alert, sending him magic out for Draco. When it came in contact with Snape instead, he raised his hand in front of him and cast an offensive hex.
“Thisss isss acceptable.” He flicked his hand at the man and watched him scurry back to his spot in line. “Goyle, report on the happeningsss at Hogwartsss.”
“Werewolves, acromantulas, a wild car, centaurs, and various other creatures and things,” Harry interrupted. “Yes, I know. I have been here before. About three or four times actually.”
This particular morning the pair was lying in bed, Harry wrapped around Draco in an attempt to soothe his frazzled nerves. Their rest had been rudely interrupted by Draco’s need to rush to the loo to upchuck all of the previous night’s supper. Harry was immediately at his side, rubbing his back and generally trying to help. He had Draco cleaned up and in his arms on their way back to bed as soon as his husband would let him. Now, Draco just lay completely still, and basked in the warmth that was his heating-blanket-husband. Really, there was no worry about freezing out in the Forbidden Forest. Harry gave off enough heat to warm a whole house it seemed!
Harry just flipped him the bird – a universal sign.

“Because they will be
When he was again questioned, and threatened with Draco’s death this time, Harry would only repeat that Draco would be the cause of Voldemort’s downfall and that soon, very soon, the world would be rid of the pestilence known as ‘He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’. Voldemort didn’t take too kindly to this and stepped up the torturing. Eventually, Harry broke through the binds that kept him in place and kicked arse. First the Death Eaters on duty fell to his wand, which was kept nearby for some unknown reason, although Harry wasn’t complaining. Then Wormtail fell and was placed in a containment spell so his mind could be filtered and Sirius proven innocent, even though he was no longer alive. Harry went in search of Voldemort then, and found Severus kneeling at his feet to ‘report on Dumbledore’.
“McKay, I know you’re eating and probably don’t understand a word I’m saying, but I’m your daddy. I’m Harry, and this big guy next to me is your other daddy. I told you about him. Remember Blaise? But he’s not your real daddy. I told you that before. Draco’s your real daddy. Blaise is just here to fill in for him since he’s being an idiot. But don’t worry one bit, we love you still the same,” Harry said softly as McKay sucked on the bottle. “He’s so little.”
“Draco shut up for a moment so I can talk!” Snape roared, effectively silencing the teen. “
Poppy sighed. “I will have to re-break it before I can heal it then. I’m sorry Harry, you know if I don’t it will only cause problems later on. What about the cut on his leg. Is that badly infected?”
as quickly as possible. They were lucky to have caught several major Death Eaters like Dolohov, Greyback, and the Lestrange brothers. The full Wizengamot had already been recalled to oversee all the trials.
“You lied to us?” Hermione seethed, rounding on the headmaster. “We have been worried sick, freaking out over every possible theory and every time our charms let us know he was hurt or injured, and he was here?!”
“Madam Pomfrey! Quick! Something is wrong with Harry! He is in mortal danger!”
Deciding to see if Draco had left a note, Harry went to their bedroom. He hung his Auror robes on his side of one of the closets and then took a look around. On the pillows, on the bedside tables, in the bathroom, on the vanity, on the mirror, on the dressing table.
“I was asked, firstly. The stipulations Mr. Zabini has placed on the accepting doctor will meet my requests quite nicely. And a chance to help Harry Potter? No one in their right mind would pass that up.”
“It hasn’t been real until now,” Harry said softly, still not looking up. “It was okay at first, that he missed his first sonogram and his first kicks and the first time he moved.” Harry looked up now, tears streaming down his face but a fire in his eyes Blaise hadn’t seen in a long time. “But he missed his own son’s birth! It wasn’t real until then! And all the congratulations from your family and friends, congratulating me and you, like you had anything to do with…” He trailed off, once more looking down. “It just hurts.”
“Well, that’s a simple answer,” Theresa said. Three pairs of eyes shifted to her; they’d forgotten about her. “Yes, I still exist. Blaise and Harry were married in a simple ceremony where the bondsman was silenced on pain of death from
“Not much. Just that you're the top, and I beg you for it, and I am apparently gagging for it.” There was a sigh of relief that, although it was more than anyone needed to know, it wasn't too bad. “Then I told them all that I liked to be on my knees, bound, sucking your cock.” Harry groaned. “And that I like to play with toys.” Another louder, longer groan. “Oh, come on baby. You don't have to defend your manhood anymore. We made sure everyone knew you were the top.”
“You can continue anytime you wish, Draco,” Snape said sarcastically.
“Get a room!” someone shouted.
He kissed me in the Great Hall, but told me not to tell.
Their due date was the first week of September, something that worried Harry to no end. If Snape were in class, how would he get Madam Pomfrey to their quarters? He could easily summon her with magic like he had before when Draco had first felt the baby move. That was so invasive, however. When he brought the worry up to Draco, the blonde merely bit his lip while he thought on the matter.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“He’s upset and unbalanced. Pregnancy is hard, but so is the time right after you have the baby. The hormones and chemical unbalances are still there. And Harry is hurting even more because he’s a single parent who’s married to someone he isn’t romantically involved with. Draco’s missed everything when it comes to his child, and it was only because he didn’t stop to listen to the explanation. I’m not saying that this is a good thing for Harry, because it’s certainly not healthy to keep a baby from interacting with other people. I’m glad he comes out at least once a week. But he doesn’t say anything. Try talking to him.”
A red robe, a golden tie with a pony tail.
The small kitchen, the loo, the living room, the office, their bedroom, the halls, the walls (stone by stone), the floors, the painting (as Snape only allowed one in his chambers, period), the fireplace (brick by brick), everything! He even added his own ward to the door to recognize his magical signature so he wouldn’t have to be with someone to enter by voice password.
They also just liked the sound of Armand and Alexia. Beautiful, strong names.
Molly snapped another picture just before Draco started to groan and yell through another contraction.
“Oh no Harry, let him sleep. He’ll come out of it when he’s ready to.”
“Not necessarily,” Draco answered with a dreamy smile on his lips. “I was born with black hair and dark eyes too. Now look at me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Not there. Where was Harry? Oh yes. He’d run from the infirmary after his father had told him to unlearn everything he’d ever learned about being a Malfoy. Harry must still be there.
“The real talent comes from interpreting the signs,” Draco paused to eat a piece of strawberry. “Like the sign for sleepy. It could mean he is sleepy, or that I need sleep, or that someone is asleep. The sign for thirsty – is he thirsty? Does he want something specific to drink? Is he asking if I want a drink? Maybe he’s asking if there’s any left. It’s all about context and the situation at the time.”
“What were you doing, Severus?”
“About Misters Malfoy and Potter,” Snape continued, wondering why they were not currently trying to hug their best friend. When he cast a look at the chair they had last been sitting in, he noticed that Harry and Draco were gone. He flashed a look at Dumbledore in confusion. Before anything could be done or said, McGonagall started talking again.
“I’m no idiot, Mal– Draco. Some of these pieces are starting to come together to form a picture, one which tells me this is Harry’s room. As one of his best friends, I have a right to be here.” She sat, willing the Slytherin to pick a fight with her and not at the same time. Another piece of that puzzle she was forming had to do with the hand on the midsection of her greatest rival. That piece had not quite clicked into place yet.
“Like this for example,” she said, leading him into the Great Hall and right up the one of the larger bouquets on the table they were to dine at. “This is a bouquet of ivy, fern, tulip, poppy, and heather. Each symbolize something unique. He chose the fern, ivy, and poppy for both of you; the tulip for himself as a declaration of love to you; and the heather for you, as a symbol of the protection you’ve given him these last five months. There are Gryffindor and Slytherin colours here, red and green. He has brought people you are familiar and comfortable with to counterbalance Professor Snape. He and I are uncomfortable with one another, but have worked together for you. He is a remarkable young man, I must admit.”
“No,” Draco answered. “Harry woke me. He was the one keeping me asleep. He tends to do that when he thinks I need some extra rest. Which I don’t,” he directed at Harry. Then he sighed. “I suppose I was roused to tell the story?” Harry nodded. “Fine. Where are we starting?”
“Harry,” Theresa broke in. “We’re wizards. They’ll have no choice but to believe you if you take Veratiserum. And they can do a paternity test on McKay and see that he’s Draco’s. Both are major factors in your favour. Then the marriage can be annulled and you will be free to marry Draco. Problem solved.”
Harry tightened his grip a bit more, giving Draco less manoeuvrable room in which to gain purchase to hit him. The blood continued to flow from his nose; he was actually a bit worried it might be broken.
Next day I chased him ‘round the dungeons
“I beg forgiveness, my Lord. I was ignorant and failed in my duties to you.” He kissed the hem once more.
“Hermione! We’ve got potions after lunch! Snape’ll kill us if we skive his class!”
Blaise laughed. “Yes, we all know. Two words Harry: Silencing. Charms.”
There, a dark and horrible black cloud of pulsing energy there. But it was painful, even for Harry. The energy wouldn't go as peacefully like the rest had; this energy fought back. But he knew he couldn't give up. He was the only one who could help this man. No matter his personal feelings for him, this was Draco's father. This man had tried his best to keep Draco from coming to any harm. This man was important to Draco. If for no other reason, Harry would help him because of that.
“Let him stew,” Hermione said. “It’s good for him. If I could get some answers, I can explain it to him. Malfoy. Er, Draco, I mean. You seem to be key in this mystery. What is going on here? Why do they keep referring to you as Potter-Malfoy?”
A quick
What they found was this: Harry wasn’t in a tower, Harry wasn’t in a classroom, Harry wasn’t in the Great Hall or the infirmary, Harry wasn’t in the dungeons, and Harry wasn’t outside. They lay the map down dejected. He wasn’t in Hogwarts at all. They really had taken their best friend out of the school. Hermione’s eyes went wide suddenly. She grabbed the map, nearly ripping it in her haste. “Show the infirmary!” she shouted. The map moved so it was showing the hospital wing once more. “Ron, Ron! Look at this! He’s not there!”
, Harry reminded him via more writing. Their personal language didn’t have many of the words Harry needed during these conversations.
Between the arguments and the pregnancy hormones, Harry was ready to jump off the Astronomy Tower. Thankfully all the students had left for summer hols so he was able to storm from Severus’ rooms to get some air to breathe. He didn’t leave the castle. Usually, he went to the kitchens and got something sweet from the elves there to pacify Draco upon his return.
“This was your plan, mate. Get him up and out of the house.”
Before any real conversation might begin, another knock sounded and in walked Dimitri Volkanov. He gave a bow at the door and quickly took his seat. He set his briefcase in his lap and removed some parchment and a quill, then stored the briefcase beside his chair.
Whatever that meant.
“It’s no use Madam Pomfrey,” Draco said. “He hasn’t slept while I have since our second month gone. We were attacked by woodlouse. He won’t allow both of us to sleep at the same time anymore. Besides, it allowed one of us to be the lookout, more often than not it was him.” He yawned. Harry tucked him in and kissed his forehead. Then he sat at the end of Draco’s bed cross-legged and watched the two adults with wary eyes.
Wild gesturing.
“I don’t care if there’s anything wrong with him,” Snape snapped, finally getting irritated by being back-talked to. “If he has a disease, then you would have caught it! I won’t have my godson sick because of something he did!”
“If you had offended me, Luciusss, you would be dead. I want your ssson here within the week. Underssstood?”
“Classes end at half past four. I would think… six o’clock would be good? That gives me enough time to finish up things in the classroom, and then come back here to relax a bit before having to deal with Potter. And don’t give me that look. You may be protecting him, but it’s annoying to those of us trying to help him.”
“No, Lucius. What do you know of Severus at this very moment?” He gestured to the prone form of the professor, hoping the blonde would have an answer the matron did not.
he corrected again, blocked his way this time. “I don’t know what you want, but I do know that I want you to move.”
“I don’t know.”
Harry nodded to Molly and went into his bedroom. Draco was sucking on some ice chips there, holding Narcissa’s hand. He lifted the camera up to show Draco, silently asking permission. Draco rolled his eyes but nodded. Harry snapped a picture or two, making sure Narcissa was in it. He knew Draco would love the picture later even if he couldn’t appreciate it now. He floated the camera in front of them as he took a picture of Draco in the rocking chair in the nursery with Harry kneeling at his side. He wished he’d thought of pictures earlier in the pregnancy. That would have been nice.
He kissed me in the Great Hall, but told me not to tell.
“That’s not what I was asking. You love him? Is it a love match, or is it for the survival of yourself and now your child?”
“We’d like to start at the beginning of our story and get through the whole thing today, leaving the details for another interview. As Luna can surely attest, Harry and I were not friends during our years at Hogwarts. Our first and second meetings pre-Hogwarts were actually quite tense and ended with Harry rejecting my offer of friendship. Up until the beginning of our seventh year, this past year, we were enemies. We both played Seeker on our House teams – Harry a Gryffindor, myself a Slytherin. Even our families were on opposite sides with my parents being Dark Lord sympathizers and Harry’s being members of the Order of the Phoenix.”
“Harry, I am offering this. You’re not asking for me to do it. I want to. You are my friend. And Draco, dumbass that he is being right now, is too. I would do anything for either of you. And I want to do this. Please, let me help. I can at least learn how to act when I do meet that someone, yeah? And it will give you time as well. There’s only one thing I ask from you concerning this child.”
“I’m not going anywhere, I promise Harry. I’ll be right here.”
hurt this in any case so please move on.”
He’d have to approach the situation carefully. At seven months in, Draco’s balance was nearly non-existent. He wasn’t able to get off the couch by himself any longer. It caused him great distress. Especially because it meant he couldn’t storm away from a situation. He also couldn’t pace, because turning took a great deal more effort and thought than it used to. More than once, he’d had to catch the boy before he fell. And more often than that, Harry did.
“Why are you in the sitting room? I’m hungry. Do we have any fried ham?” Harry walked into the room. “Blaise, are you- Am I interrupting something?” He looked around at the three women, one man, and Blaise as if their faces alone would give him the answers he sought.
During the day, Draco and Dumbledore worked on creating name settings, bouquets, and other little decorations. Draco had chose all of the floral arrangements himself, made of five different plants. A fern leaf would be at the back of the bouquet to represent magic, an ivy limb down the side to represent marriage, three red poppies to represent pleasure, three red tulips to represent a declaration of love, and a sprig of white heather to represent protection. There were two bouquets on the table, and a smaller bouquet on the back of each chair. Or there would be, once night fell and they could start decorating the small portion of the Great Hall they’d be using.
That was the routine. Monday through Saturday Harry would stay in his rooms with McKay, only allowing Kipper and Theresa into his rooms when needed. On Sundays, he would join Blaise and Theresa for dinner but wouldn’t say anything while there. Then he’d beat a hasty retreat to his rooms. Blaise allowed this for some time, nearly five months, before he talked to Theresa about it. “I don’t understand why he would shut himself up like this.”
When the robes were loosened, Harry drew them down Draco’s arms and followed their progress with kisses across Draco’s shoulders. He wore nothing beneath his robes now. Nothing fit and too much chafed besides. Even pants were too much for his sensitive skin. All the better, as far as Harry was concerned. Never allowing his lips to leave Draco’s skin, Harry helped Draco rise from the bench. His robes fell all the way and pooled at his feet. Slowly, Draco turned in Harry’s arms and they kissed again.
“Albus, I thought he was unconscious? What is he saying?”
“I’m afraid, my Lord, I have none to give,” he finally got out. “My son is not at home, and if he is not at Hogwarts then I am unaware of where he is.”
That was another thing they’d talked about – the excuse used for why Harry was away. If he were away for training, then he needed to get some kind of training. Voldemort was still a real threat, and now Snape wasn’t able to spy. Even the Malfoys were stuck at Hogwarts for their protection. It would be best for all of it to come out to the public. It would protect the former Death Eaters in the longrun, would bring all the information to light, and would show that Harry wasn’t trying to hide anything.
Blaise just laughed lightly and looked at the black and white screen before them. “Harry?” Theresa asked after a few moments of silence. “Have you thought of a name for the baby yet?”
So when Harry made a beeline for his husband’s ‘wrapped’ cock, Draco lay back and let him. The blue bow was removed with Harry’s teeth, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder if Harry knew that was a tradition too. But then he stopped thinking. Because Harry swallowed his cock down to the root. A flashback to the first time the Gryffindor had tried that almost made Draco laugh. It had taken the last two months to get to the point of going down on one another and not choking. But now Harry had no problems. At all. And,
“Yes, my Lord. My son has reported that the Slytherin dorms were in chaos for a short time before Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson stepped up to fill Draco Malfoy’s place.”
“I want the wedding to be within the week. Is that possible?” Draco asked. “I want it to be soon, so I don’t get any bigger.”
“You’re a carrier, aren’t you?” Ron asked, not accusing or hate-filled in any way. It was just a statement.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Realization dawned. In working himself up, he’d placed his child under stress as well. One hand flew to his belly where that child rested. He sent silent apologies to him or her, promising to rest for many days to make up for this fiasco. When two extra chairs were conjured, he glared first at the headmaster for allowing the Gryffindor to stay in his rooms, then at the Gryffindor herself. “You are not welcome.”
“Hey, I resent that one! You get plenty from me!” But Harry was still laughing. The song changed to a country song.
“Not Harry, Ron! Malfoy! Malfoy’s not in the infirmary! Look!” She shoved the parchment under her boyfriend’s nose while he looked. She could see his eyes moving back and forth rapidly, searching for the name that was supposed to be there. “If Malfoy’s not there, then Harry wasn’t taken out of school for training. When was the last time we saw Harry?”
“I’m sorry!” he sobbed into Blaise’s chest. “I didn’t mean to yell at you! That was horrible of me! And then you go and make the ham that I wanted even after I was horrible to you. And you asked me to come down to meet the doctors and I yelled at you some more. I’m sorry Blaise, really I am. Do you believe me Blaise? Please believe me, because I really am sorry. I didn’t mean to make you mad or anything like that.” He buried his face in Blaise’s chest, then whispered, “Please don’t leave me Blaise.” No one but Blaise heard it.
“Now you listen to me, Harry, just listen,” Mrs. Zabini began. “I don’t understand any of your minds. I’m not sure I would have done the same thing for a friend as Blaise has done for you. I don’t think I would have handled the situation the same as Draco Malfoy did. And I don’t know if I could live the way you are Harry, pretending everything’s okay when it’s not. However, I cannot control any of your lives or decisions. I will keep this under my hat if that’s what you wish for me to do. The rest is up to you two. I will continue to be the doting mother-in-law who is ecstatic about having her first grandbaby. Not everything is as it seems; that’s one of the first things you learn in a pureblood household. This is no exception. Now, what have you decided to name the baby?”
“Severus,” Dumbledore warned, watching as Ron cowered a bit but Hermione didn’t even flinch. “Miss Granger, what is going through your mind right now? You seem very sure of yourself right now.”
Dimitri sat in stunned silence, his quill hanging precariously between his fingers. Draco let him have a moment, using the time to drink some more water.
“We didn’t,” Harry insisted, “but I got pregnant and had a baby. They’re not going to believe me! Even if I am Harry Potter, the evidence is overwhelming in the wrong direction. They won’t annul this marriage. We’ll have to get a divorce Blaise, I’m sorry. I know you don’t want to because it will shame your family, but I love Draco and you know this. I can’t stay in this marriage if Draco’s willing to marry me now that he knows the true story and has stopped being a stupid prat.”
And then the Quill stopped. Harry looked back at Draco, rubbing his right thumb over the back of Draco’s left hand.
“Very good. Now, for clarity and just to double check, Harry did you ever sleep with Blaise?”
“Yes yes yes!” Draco cried, hiking his leg up as much as his belly would allow. “Do it, Harry. Eat me out. Stretch me and make me wet for you. I want to come on your tongue alone. Do it, baby. I want to feel you deep. Ah! Yes!”
Harry stepped up behind Draco and put his arms around the near-crying young man. But Draco shook him off.
“You understood what he was saying?” Madam Pomfrey asked of Draco. “How? Are you using telepathy?”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
“That’s it, Harry, that’s it! That’s my spot! Harder… Yeah, you got it. You know just what I want, what I need. Only you, Harry, only you can satisfy me. Make me wet. Get me ready for your cock. I’m so ready, Harry. I need you. Your tongue, your fingers, your cock-”
Draco’s next words were cut off as his stomach rolled and he rushed to the loo. He threw up everything he’d eaten that day, then continued dry heaving. Harry was at his side, rubbing his back and holding his hair. He even sent magic through their bond to comfort his husband since he couldn’t talk. Eventually, Draco sat back, breathing heavily. A quick cleansing charm and the taste of sick was gone.
When dinner approached, Draco sat down in his room, alone for the first time that day, and began to write his vows. He didn’t know what he wanted to say, but he knew he had to say something. It wasn’t common for a couple to use their own vows with the ceremonial blessing they were using, but Draco wanted it. So he got it. He first made a list of all the things he wanted to say to Harry, then how to say them. Finally, he filled in the blanks so the whole thing would flow nicely. At last, he looked down at his vows.
“Then I’ll just have to wear Draco’s for now, won’t I?” He reached into the box, pulled out both rings, and slid them onto Harry’s and his left ring fingers respectively, watching as they magically changed sizes to fit the wearer. “Come, I think an audience awaits. Try to be calm through the questioning and be as vague as possible when forced to answer. If it gets too bad for you, seek shelter in the Slytherin dorms. You still have the password right?”
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
The other three doctors looked on with mixed expressions of horror at her answer and glee that she would be the first to go with an answer like that. Blaise merely continued smirking. “Harry? Would you come down here for a second? I wish to introduce you properly to the four applicants I have selected.”
“Perfect! After your next contraction, I’ll bring out your child. How does that sound, dears?”
“Why do we have to wait?” Draco whined. “Why not take It out now?”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
That calmed anyone who seemed worried, and the questions continued. The party started to wind down and people started to leave in twos and threes. When it was just the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Dumbledore, Snape, Narcissa, Lucius, and Remus left, Draco cleared his throat to get everyone’s attention.
Voldemort resumed his pacing, taking quick short steps. Lucius would have breathed a sigh of relief had he not known that such an act would get him killed. Pacing meant no Crucios. Then he began muttering, unknowingly allowing only a few to hear his words. “All the children are around the same age as the Malfoy brat, with him as the oldest. If he does as I will, the others will follow his leadership. Like father like son.” He turned abruptly to face his Death Eaters. “Luccciusss,” he hissed, now speaking in part Parseltongue, “you know what isss required of your ssson. Prepare him for hisss tasssk. Prepare him well.”
“True, but do you know who I was before I married Blaise?”
“How's life going, mate? Draco still treating you right?”
“Like I care about my health when Harry might...” He couldn’t even say it.
“I’m going to need a number.”
“No, Mr. Volkanov, Severus is not a Death Eater. He has not been for many years now. He has been spying on the Dark Lord for our side, bringing us information whenever possible, withstanding torture both physical and mental for over fifteen years. When they were to be Avada’ed, Severus grabbed my father after he’d been Cruicio’ed and portkeyed them to safety to the Hogwarts infirmary. From then on, my parents were secluded here in Hogwarts Castle as well, for their safety. They had defected.
. He has changed his ways, never wanted anything like this to happen. Smart? Brain? Knowledge? Yes, knowledge? Okay, knowledge. You? You knowledge? Do you know him? Yes, you know this Death Eater.” A significant look at Draco, then back at Snape. “Yes to that as well, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, yes to that as well. Now I really must be going.”
He continued getting dressed with a large grin on his face.
Hermione began to cry tears of joy and she threw herself into Ron’s arms. “They might find him yet!” she cried. “He’s alive! Did you hear? He’s alive!” He just continued to hold her as she cried, his own eyes a bit watery. After a few moments, he nodded to the teachers in attendance and slowly made his way back to their common room with Hermione still clutching his robes in her hands.
Plot twist OF DOOM!
“Stop and breathe now, Harry,” Theresa said. “That was good. You have to keep doing that when I tell you, but remember to breathe. It won’t help anything at all if you go and pass out on me. Nothing was hurting was it? The numbing spell should take care of all that for you.” Harry shook his head. “Good, good. Push again.” Doing as told, Harry started pushing. “Good! Take a deep breath and do it again. Okay, keep pushing. I can see his head, Harry. Keep pushing.”
“Your eyes were blue too, Harry,” Molly piped in. “Almost all babies are born with blue eyes. They’ll change in a week or two weeks’ time. And my twins were born with dark hair. Arthur fainted right on the floor at the sight of that! One week later, it all fell out and the red hair came sprouting right in.”
“Oh yes! It came to me just the other night. I was thinking of all the names I like, and how to arrange them in a way I’d like them, and I finally decided on McKay Draconis Malfoy.” All movement stopped. Nobody said a word or made a noise, except for the machine which beeped out the baby’s heart rate. “What? What’s wrong with that name? I thought it was a good idea to make Draco’s name the middle name.”
Harry tightened his grip on Draco and looked toward the door. A few moments later, Severus walked in. “Poppy. I came to retrieve my memory as well as to see if there are-” He froze at seeing Draco awake and sitting up in the bed. He was even more shocked that he was in Harry’s arms, even though he knew the two were expecting a child. “Draco.” He moved to hug his godson, but Harry maneuvered him away from the professor. “Fine. For now Potter. I want a full update on their conditions, Poppy. Do you know the story yet?”
“Just under five minutes,” Narcissa announced.
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
Silently, Severus turned and went back into his rooms. Yes. He needed to talk to the Headmaster, and soon.
Blaise chuckled. There was silence for a few moments before Blaise rose to his feet. “Would you all care to follow me please? I have some ham to fry for Harry’s cravings.” He didn’t wait for any answers, merely walked away. The four immediately followed him into the large kitchen. The house elves there greeted them and got any drinks they asked for, as well as the ham from the freezer Blaise asked for. Blaise used a thawing spell to thaw the ham, and then began to fry strips for Harry. He worked in silence for a few moments.
“You’ll want pictures, dearie.”
“Professor, please,” Draco said softly. “Just… Madam Pomfrey, please?” With that, he promptly fainted. When Severus reached out to catch the falling boy, Harry snatched him out of the air and pulled him against his own body without a sound. Draco was turned so Harry could partially cradle him, but he never took his glaring gaze off the Potions Master.
“And sometimes you are, like last night. But it doesn't matter what they say. Let them think that you're the bottom in our relationship. It's more surprising when you whoop their butts at some later point in training or in the field or whatever. Let them think you take it up the arse for me every night and half the mornings. I'm okay with that. Just because I'm usually the one on my knees with my arms tied behind my back sucking your cock doesn't make either of us any less of a man. Come on, Harry. I feel like playing with toys tonight.”
Draco was sobbing quietly into Harry’s shoulder now, sobbing for his regal father’s lost pride. The man that bowed to no one, that everyone feared, was nothing but a whore to the Dark Lord Voldemort. His whole life had been a lie. Everything he knew and loved and had been taught… it was all a lie! His father was supposed to teach him to be that as well, to be the Dark Lord’s plaything! No! His father had asked Snape to keep him away from all of that. His father really did care. But then, why did he stay behind if he knew that it wasn’t a good thing? He didn’t understand!
But he also had to make him see sense. This was also Potter’s child, meaning the press was part of the package deal.
articles so no one expected him to talk. However, it did have the side effect that many people ignored him and some talked about him like he wasn’t there. He let it go; he was focused on Draco and making sure nothing overwhelmed the pregnant man.
“How can you not know?” Harry asked, astonished.
“At dinner on Sunday. When he comes down, talk to him. Try asking him things. Make him stay until after dessert or coffee or something. Tell him what you’re telling me, that as his friend you are concerned for his and McKay’s well-being. Ask him if there’s something you can do to make this easier on him. Other than that… I don’t know Blaise.” She sighed and left to walk around outside. The snow had melted and it was Summer time now.
conscious and we do have guests! Who are now traumatized, as am I. Surely Severus has a bedroom you could both use? I thought you had more decorum than that.”
When they were done with her, they dropped her at the gates in front of Hogwarts with a note that read,
Such a simple question. Of course he wasn’t okay. His whole world had tilted on its axis the day he found out he was a wizard in this whole other world. The day that detention was to be served tilted his world again. From there, things seemed to steady themselves.
Harry cut Draco off with a kiss, holding his husband in place until he relaxed and melted into the embrace. Then he pulled back and smirked.
Draco was panting after the contraction, sucking on an ice chip. Harry was wide-eyed as looked back and forth between his husband and the mediwitch. In a few short moments, he would become a father. In a matter of literal minutes, he’d be holding a child in his arms. He looked at Draco in wonderment and love, so grateful to this man for carrying their child and loving him and going through everything they’d gone through together…
“Annulled? We’ve been married for over a year,” Harry said. “How will that be possible?”
“Not yet,” he whispered. “I’m okay. I’m not hurt. I’m happy. It’s good.” He tried to reassure his husband, but felt the wave of magic wash over him anyways as Harry scanned him. “It’s good,” he repeated.
“Why?” Harry whispered. “Why would you give up your life for me? Who knows who you’re supposed to be with? You won’t be able to date or anything! Why would you give up a chance at forever just to keep me from being embarrassed because D-draco left me? I can’t let you do this Blaise, I just can’t.”
Instead of complying with Draco’s wishes, Harry reached around and began to lightly tease one of Draco’s nipple again.
All you need to know is that I’m an awesome authoress and that this is an awesome fic that you want to read and WILL NOT flame at the end. Also, you want to leave a review. I know you do. And so do you. Because I just told you that you do. Yeah. On with the fic now…
“Yes, Master Blaise.”
“No. I told them that I liked to be on my knees bound and gagged, that I like being at your mercy while you torture me with hands and tongue... and toys.” He grinned evilly.
They stayed that way for a while, just holding one another and basking in the love they felt for each other. They heard Snape return from his classes sometime later, but they didn’t leave their room. Harry eventually got Draco to start talking about the wedding again, and which people he would invite. He could just feel his lover’s excitement over the upcoming nuptials. They did talk about their first wedding, about colours and robes and vows. Draco was of the opinion that they needed to do it as soon as possible so Draco wouldn’t look too big with the pregnancy.
While Madam Pomfrey and Granger became more and more flustered every day that Harry slept on, Draco was confident that everything would be fine in the end. The stress of the five months in the Forest, then one month back at Hogwarts, had taken its toll on Harry. His whole existence had been put toward keeping Draco safe from every possible harm, scratch, and emotional toil that could come upon him in the Forest and at Hogwarts. He’d done a wonderful job of it too. Any time Draco tried to give him a break or take over for a few hours, Harry would hear none of it. He’d spent days on end awake and aware, ever watchful. It had saved them plenty of times in the Forest, these abilities he had.
“What are you talking about, Boot?” Ron asked, growing confused.
So that was a lot of talking… Sorry.
“Yeah, I know. It’s my job to figure it out. Isn’t it always?” Severus dismissed the younger man and went back to his coffee. “Bloody Gryffindors.”
revolve around Harry Potter.
He looked over at his husband. There was a deeper connection between them, forged and tried through such adversity as most people could not even dream of. There was a true bond between them, one no marriage ceremony could put a name to or a divorce proclamation could rip asunder. Theirs was truly–
“I’m not sure, Poppy.” He and the nurse rushed to the Slytherin’s side. “See if anything is wrong with him, if you can find out what exactly is causing the unconscious speaking.”
suppose
Before Harry could answer his stomach growled. “I think a grilled cheese sandwich with roasted potatoes and some ranch dressing sounds better,” Harry said with a large smile.
“Turkey. And dressing. And chocolate éclairs. With orange juice. And some blocks of cheese.”
“I want to know how you became blind and how you see now. We know you became mute after the nundu attack, but nothing about your eyes.”
“My hair?” Draco asked. “Do you really need to cut my hair?”
“Ummm… Uh, before his detention. Dinner! Dinner in the Great Hall two months ago. I thought that was a long time for even Malfoy to recover,” he grumbled. “What does this mean?”
Snape was silent for a moment, thinking. “If you can tell me all the ingredients in this potion,” he pulled out a new vial, this one with a green potion in it, “with only your sense of smell, I will tell Poppy that you don’t need the enhancing potion.”
“Well, you're late to work. I've already called in for you. Your boss understands. He was at the party last night.”
“Ridiculousss! How much training doesss it take to learn to take it up the arssse?”
The glare intensified.
“Yeah, but it’d be nicer if Harry were here to enjoy it as well,” he grumped as they entered their Transfiguration classroom. They were given instructions and then left to their own devices. As seventh years, they were expected to be able to do their work quickly and quietly, and fights and things were not tolerated at all. As this class was with the seventh year Ravenclaws, nobody had anything to worry about. The two houses got on well enough together, which means they were neither friendly nor hostile with each other.
“Regardless,” Dumbledore interrupted, “I think it best if you remain silent and go back to your common room. I will continue to search for Misters Potter and Malfoy. As soon as we know anything, you will be informed.”
“So we got the Marauder’s Map,” Ron picked up, “and looked around to see if we could see where Harry was. We discovered he wasn’t here, he’s not in Hogwarts. But we also discovered that Malfoy isn’t in Hogwarts either. Just this morning you said he was in the hospital wing with Madam Pomfrey. Well, he’s not. And two months is too long to heal from something. Madam Pomfrey can re-grow bones overnight!”
Harry moved both hands in front of him as if to ask, ‘What?’.
Meanwhile, Dumbledore had laid one hand over Harry’s forehead and the other over his heart while Madam Pomfrey chanted in a low smooth voice. Hermione ran back into the room with the two requested potions in hand. Other than the chanting, all was silent. Once the headmaster removed his hands, the matron took one potion at a time and coaxed them down the unconscious Gryffindor’s throat.
And Draco cried out as loud as he possibly could.
and get Dumbledore to get that horrid Skeeter woman over here for your interviews. Surely Draco can translate for you, or you can give statements as you are right now. I’m weary of the woman, but I’m certain she can read.”
“We found traces of them, a few tracks,” she reported, her eyes widening at the ability to speak again and the words that were forming. “We didn’t want to get your hopes up, as the tracks are old, but we have doubled our search efforts. We brought in others so that Hagrid would not be missed, nor any of the other teachers.”
“Really Harry, that’s no way answer your doting husband.”
“She’s never been thanked before. I think you shocked her. Well, you just rest. I’m going to go unpack my things and begin cooking dinner. What would you like?”
big of a deal.”
“Well, they didn’t. They only just now told Dumbledore about it because of how hot it burned when you nearly depleted your magic. By the way, removing two Dark Marks and then using legillimancy to chew me out is
“One moment, Madam Pomfrey,” Draco said with a wave of his hand, not taking his eyes off the slowly spinning wand. It was almost stopped now. When it finally did, it was pointing more toward Harry than Draco. “Damn it. It’s a biased wand!” he snapped, snatching the wand from the floor and getting back to his feet; Harry helped him back to the bed. “It’s your wand. Of course it’s going to point to you. It recognizes your magic better than mine.”
: nah i just make life more fun
Harry scoffed.
“How did you get into the fashion industry?” Harry asks spontaneously while Draco is measuring his (very nice) arse.
A wave of snickers floods the Great Hall, and Harry is fighting a smile at this point.
Harry sighs loudly, causing me to sigh. Then we both yawn. This is awkward.
: where’d ginny and luna go?
Harry is sitting next to Draco on a beach in the Caribbean, their hands clasped together.
: smt u wanna tell me love?
: im going the fuck to sleep
Wish I had a picture,” and continues to laugh.
“Yeah!
great then we probably live in the same country
He cracks a smile against his will.
I CNAT BREATHE
No one’s ever cared that much about me before.
: because it just doesn’t work that way!
Draco cocks his head.  “Why?”
So instead of talking, he just gets a sponge and returns to kneel in front of Draco, cautiously reaching out to wipe the clay off his face.
I should… I should probably tell you guys something else first though.”
,” Harry says.
: ahahahahah
The man is too unpredictable.
“What were you thinking of making today?”
“Potter?
Draco managed to center the clay but is now finding himself incapable of shaping it.
"That would be wonderful!" I glanced at my watch. "Oh, I've got to go. I was going to spend some time with my friends this afternoon. Thank you so much for the tea Narcissa, the scones were delicious."
Ron sighs and sits on one of Draco’s leather chairs in the sitting room.
: absolutely
It’s just, I finished like 40 hats and scarves and the weather is starting to get cold, so I figured- but you don’t have to-”
I love it here
Thanks, I guess?”
“Er- Headmistress, we were just-”
: DRARRY
: wut does that even mean
—— 8 hours ——
and they exchanged confused glances and so I continued and said:
“But… purple?”
The cream exterior with dark wood accents gave it a very half-timber style, and the green lawn and assortment of flora and fauna, dusted with snow, made the house feel like a very large cottage. It was homey to say the least.
Malfoy smirks.
“Why did you lie to him?”
You?”
Stacks of unwashed dishes sit in the sink, and various food items and dishes are scattered across the counter.
: maybe we should tie him up more often
SKITTLES PLZ
“Harry James Potter, I really love you.
But the man looks up at him and Harry realizes he has his crotch pressed against Draco Malfoy’s.
“So I had an idea,” Harry starts, licking his lips.
: and just like that ur single again
: I hate responsible people
Draco scoffs.
“Does your obliviousness never end?”
“I bet I can guess what you're teaching.”
Well, physically.
He only shrugs in response.
: are u sure cuz it’s kinda starting to come back to me
and yes harry you should go back to the shop
Harry’s afraid he’s homophobic.
He really has to spell things out for this boy.
: bc im curious and always need to know everything
“You’re beautiful, Harry,” Draco repeats.
His therapist recommended picking up a repetitive hobby to help with the anxiety and violent shaking, and it worked.
: i’m willing to bet only one is
: whatever do u mean?
Harry looks up at Draco, his green eyes just visible beneath his thick, dark eyelashes.
Apparently though, luck was not in my favor that day.
: oh boy
: damn thought i was gonna get out of that one
He shakes his neck and straightens his suit - Gryffindor red for Harry - and stands, promise ring in his pocket.
Draco absolutely fumes and he can practically feel the smoke coming out of his ears.
Draco opens his mouth to respond, but his coworker fusses at him to keep the line moving, and they have to part ways.
Draco’s breathing increases slightly, and Harry sucks just a tiny bit on Draco’s collarbone.
“No, I wasn’t going to say anything like that.
: bloody hell mate
I’m sure you’ll be happy with this?”
“Did you just call me handsome?”
: merlin help me
I’m not disappointed at the loss of contact.
They all exchange glances as he continues.
Or hate.
: this is why i love you luna
“Of course not, beautiful.”
Draco pulls Harry into a loving kiss that sets his lips on fire.
: this is gonna be so good
“That is not at all what I said.
ANYWAY
I walked over to his bedside table and set down his soup and potion.  I made to leave and go back to my room but Draco mumbled my name.
Some people spend their entire lives searching for that scent, but they can never find it because their mind has corrupted it so far that it’s incomprehensible.
: well i trust you babes so ofc you have my i devoted support
Draco ignores the way his heart jumps when Harry says ‘we’ and just perches on the edge of his desk, folding his arms.
: oh boy
He’s decided to sit in the empty seat beside me, rather than stay in his seat across the aisle, for whatever ungodly reason.
: no im 22
: hey ladies i need smt from you
A few minutes later, he pauses.
“Because- I- you- we…” Harry just sputters, his face flaming.
Malfoy is laughing so hard that it takes him a solid thirty seconds to recover enough to get out the words, “I’m flattered that you’d accuse me.”
"I came to ask you to tell your mother I'd be heading over to my place to see if the potions were done working yet. If she comes home will you do that for me?" He spoke with a slightly annoyed and exasperated tone.
“Malfoy.
: love u wifey
Hurrying through the crowd of people, I make my way cautiously towards her with no idea of what I'm going to say or how I'm going to say it.  But I keep moving because I know I need to.
Harry.
Harry moves to kneel slightly behind Draco, bringing them to the same height.
Draco nods.
He’s hyper-aware of Draco’s pretense beside him and keeps trying to discreetly glance over at the blonde boy.
Ten points to Slytherin.
“I have more customers in line, Potter.
I groan in annoyance. “I thought I told you to be quiet.”
: hey I still agree with you about the pizza thing!
He said yes, of course.
I sighed, following him.  But I took my time, deciding to admire his tight arse while he walked.
Did Draco just get flirted with in return?
: uhhhhhh
wiggle
Fuck.
“Well, lucky you, I’m actually just finishing up.
Why is Draco not, like, rolling his eyes or something?
: ready george
Understandable
Unfortunately, Harry has never been particularly concerned for his own well-being, given the five times he’s successfully defeated Voldemort and the innumerable amount of near-death experiences that go along with it, so what happens next isn’t surprising in the slightest.
Could they be happy together again?
“You kissed me first, idiot.
Honestly, I’m just like a barbie doll.”
I woke up early for you and you couldn’t even be bothered to be on time.
committed to getting his mental health fixed.
give yourself a nickname
Why did he have to go and fuck that up?
: Thank you!
The next time Harry and Draco meet is at the same club roughly two months later, but this time on the main dance floor.
It’s the middle of the week, no one should be in the Prefect’s baths…
He reaches out, tenderly placing one hand on Harry’s cheek.
He didn't know what to say.  But in that moment, he felt such love radiating off of her for her son, that he knew he didn't have to say anything.  So he just smiled.
He’s got pottery to sell, after all, and one blonde ferret won’t keep him from focusing.
” Harry mumbles.
So he says, “I’m not pretending, Draco.”
it’s really dark
He’s so screwed…
: LAST NIGHTS KARAOKE VIDEO BEGS TO DIFFER
: again.
The man nods, causing his raven black hair to bounce messily on his head and it's all Draco can do to force himself to look away and grab his tools.
: boyfriends harry. boyfriends
You’ll look exactly like it.”
lord you test me
: soggy?
"Oh," I said quietly, walking into the kitchen with them to pour myself a glass of orange juice, feeling foolish.  "Then what's he doing here this late at night?  And while we're on that topic, why is he here?"
At about 10 am, Gwaine screeches for breakfast, and Draco knows he should oblige the bird before he tears out both boys' eyes. He tries to wiggle himself out of Harry’s grip gently but doesn’t do a very good job, because suddenly Harry’s eyes are open and Draco is wishing he hadn’t moved at all.
With a (miraculously) straight face, Harry turns to Draco and says, “Well, Mr. Malfoy, how lovely of you to support Gryffindor today!
srsly harry thank merlin you added this man to the chat
His hair.
"Yes mum, I'm in the kitchen!" I called back to her.  We moved out of the Malfoy Manor about six months after the war ended.  Partly because we din't need that much space but mostly because it reminded us too much of the horrors that had gone on there.
Harry discovers that Draco also suffers from PTSD and depression, and that’s why he was out those few days.
“Potter, when are you going to do it?” Draco asks one morning at breakfast, causing Harry to choke on his porridge and blush.
Draco turns around for a second time to retrieve the ladle and Harry mutters the second part: defining the trigger.
: alright fair
“You’re the only one that’s brought me soup.”
“Harry, I think I’ve just the color for you.”
“Er- mate-”
“And I just don’t know what my problem is, guys.  I mean I totally support you two-” Harry gestures to Dean and Seamus “-but something about Draco dating men just makes me lose it.  Is selective homophobia a thing?”
I just rarely do so in the company of plebeians like you.”
Harry chuckles smugly.
“Absolutely, Professor.
That should do it, he thinks, tying the note to Gwen’s ankle and sending her on her way.
“Alright, you stay here, and I’ll go get us something. You can borrow some trousers if you can find ones that’ll fit your uncannily long legs,” Draco teases.
HOW DO I
"No Harry, I won't-"
That’s how Harry and Draco end up sitting on the couch in Draco’s apartment on Friday night planning the party.
No.  That's not it.  Definitely not.
angel.
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
"Draco c'mon-"
Not fancy by any stretch of the word, but a cleaner blouse, sharper slacks, that kinda thing.
He’s gazing out the window, deep in thought, not even noticing me. That’s a first.
“Malfoy?
As Harry tries to find the bathrooms again, he only has one thought on his mind:
“Harry, no ones out here.
happy?
i have some flowers that bring natural protection to those nearby
: fine then suffer
“So… what, I should see a Muggle doctor?”
McGonagall clears her throat to quiet them.
Why does this seem familiar?  Oh…
i see both sides but
: what were u gonna say
Draco sighs.
“Well… you let me…” Harry gestures back awkwardly.
: mate...
Nothing out of the ordinary happens, but when Draco finally turns around to retrieve his first ingredient, Harry begins the charm work.
*you’re
“Well, you haven’t told me your name yet, so I’ll just have to use nicknames.”
Haven’t you seen the way he looks at you?” Luna says gently.
"Oh godddd... Draco Daddy!  Daddy... oh fuckkkkk"
Harry looked at me funny.  "Alright then... well how are we going to get there?  I'm fairly sure you're not going to want to go by muggle transport."
“I’m glad you agree.
The extra body heat helped,” Draco says rather pathetically.
I lose all my brain cells by like 7 pm lmfao
