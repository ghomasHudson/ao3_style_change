Harry frowned, but began to trace along the swirling lines of the ink and felt a small thrumming sensation alight the pads of his fingertips—a twining lick of magic that bloomed beneath the heat of his skin. As he finished tracing the last letter of Apolline’s name, the parchment transformed like the blank walls of plaster in her studio.
Pro: Put the self-righteous git into his place (ideal).
his Mother had been talking about—a spark of curiosity, the excitement of discovering something new.
In Malfoy’s hand: the fluttering wings of a Golden Snitch.
“Fuck off,” he said, but his eyes traced every movement of Harry’s hands as they ran up his body and around the back of Draco’s neck, pulling him down off the headboard.
“How’s an arse-naked picture on the cover of
Harry collapsed over Draco’s body like the rush of a dripping waterfall. Floating in the ether.
Secret Spell!)
It didn’t matter that he had failed the Wizarding World, or himself, or whatever other shite the
. Harry’s warm touch was intoxicating, a blur of sensation. Draco felt the slow, etching strokes of the quill nib, dip into the raised divots of his skin. Over the Dark Mark, between the swollen, red ropes of scars.
means to you, but for me, when I was at my worst after Ron… You were just there, and it was nice to forget about everything for a while.”
And another.
He lifted his head slightly, focused on the low hum of a voice. He squinted, his vision blurry without his glasses, but the image in front of him was unmistakable. Blonde hair, splayed messily around soft cheeks, grey eyes, swollen and puffy from sleep, skin blushed rose. Draco stared down at him, sat upright with his back against the headboard. “I don’t know what this—” he swallowed, but didn’t stop staring. “I don’t know,” he finished, in nothing more than a sigh.
A golden dew, sunny raindrops. Harry was still there in the sweet taste of morning. The warm touch of sunrise.
Harry had always been an intense flood of movement, flying on intuition alone. Feeling his way through the air, his heart pounding as he fell through the sky—a plummet, a descent. He felt drunk off flying, a shock of intoxication through his veins like he was high in a blurry mindstate of bliss and oblivion.
Potter’s hand came to rest over his wound, stopping the blood flow. He muttered something Draco couldn’t comprehend and then he had his wand out. Bandages began to wrap themselves around Draco’s torso and that overwhelming warmth traveled through his body again. It felt like a candle flame alighting a midnight sky of ashy stars. It pulsed through his veins and Draco felt electric. Alive. His heart a beating drum in his chest as he inhaled gulps of air he didn’t have before.
Malfoy waved his hand around. “Particulars,” he said. “Point being: Pot sucks cock.” Harry clenched his fists by his side, trying to stop himself from grinding his teeth. Malfoy only pursed his lips. “Right. A tasteless joke. My apologies.”
There was only one thing written on the otherwise blank parchment, and Harry frowned.
It was only after the crumbling ashes of death and destruction from the fall of his seventh year, when the things in his notebook suddenly changed.
an eternal, visceral sting. But Draco was a desperate man, shackled to the mistakes of his past. And so each time he stepped into the shower, he’d raise the temperature until the skin on his arm blistered.
“But I—I play for
And so he flowed onto the dance floor, dripping with sweat and liquor, drowning himself in the heat of other bodies. More nameless strangers, and his eager, exploring hands wrapped tight around a small waist. Harry’s fingers dug into soft flesh, and lips—sticky with tequila flavoured lip gloss—pressed into the skin of his neck. He leaned back into another chest with sharp lines and strong hands. Pulled at the lengths of dark blonde hair, spun a tale, whispering words of false intimacy. Of beautiful lies.
“That’s fucked! What the fuck is wrong with you, Deverill?” Harry shouted as he snapped his head to his coach. “I’m not ashamed of my sexuality; I don’t need to pose shirtless next to some witch just so the Wizarding World can preserve the ‘straightness’ of their precious ‘Boy Who Lived.’ I’ll get Hermione to write up a statement, say that we’ve never shagged
Deverill sighed, and he looked like a man who expected a fight. “Come on, Potter, don’t blow this out of proportion. It’s just another job, I’ve told you to do it, and you will.”
Harry tried to make a sound of protest, but it was muffled against the piece of material that he was currently swallowing. So instead, he stood awkwardly, with his elbows raised above his head as he stared inside the drowning depths of red cotton, and felt the sudden presence of Malfoy standing in front of him.
Harry didn’t really know what he meant by that, but Draco’s face shuttered as if he had said something he wasn’t supposed to. His expression turned into that familiar blank mask.
Draco sat up from his lying position to follow him, arching into his sway. His hands tangled in between the fabric of Harry’s shirt, he coaxed Harry’s arms, lifting up, up, up, until it was over his head and discarded on the grass.
The minutiae didn’t matter because he’d be six feet under by the time he turned eighteen.
Draco’s fingers ran through the lengths of Potter’s hair, and he, in turn, held onto Draco like his life depended on it. And maybe that was wishful thinking, but as he licked the seam between Potter’s lips, he pulled him ever so closer until their whole bodies intertwined. And Draco was utterly and undeniably intoxicated. By the smell, by the taste, by the touch. Intoxicated with Potter.
It was strange to realise at such a young age that his end was right around the corner, it beckoned him and called his name. Until one day, he’d make that final turn and stare his expiration right in its blackened eyes. Draco didn’t know what would finally do him in, either the skull etched into his arm or the four walls of Azkaban.
Harry could do nothing but nod his head as he walked towards the lake, mimicking Malfoy’s slow steps until he felt the cold water seep to his skin underneath his jeans. He stopped when they were barely an arms length apart. Harry fisted his hands deep inside the pockets of Malfoy’s robes, and he watched the way Malfoy’s gaze tracked the movement. His grey eyes flicked everywhere as if he was contemplating, and the darkness within them reminded Harry of the way Malfoy eyed the Snitch. As if he was hungry for it, to feel the smooth golden metal between his hands. As if he’d do absolutely anything to wrap his hands around the unattainable. As if he’d do anything to win.
this win, and I would’ve if you hadn’t barrelled right through my broom.”
“And how is this going to be any different?”
Her voice was clipped as she said, “Do I look like a woman who's impressed by you lazing about? Wasting my time? Your wrinkles are only getting deeper by the minute.”
Hermione made a show of rolling her eyes, but a fond smile lit up her features so Harry counted that as a personal win. “When this all blows up in your face, I
“I never said
Like the very match that had started it all, this was more than a game. And this time, Harry had something to prove. He was more than a stupid sex scandal fabricated by the masses. He was more than a hot-headed player ‘trying to seduce the other team’s seeker’. This was his livelihood, his passion. He was going to show it—and beat Malfoy to a pulp in the process.
He was fine. Malfoy was a git anyway, he reminded himself, before any unwanted images of a pale expanse of skin, blushed pink under the hot steam of water, met his mind.
Right. Okay.
A sudden glint caught Harry’s eye, then, like a spotlight—something small and stark against the dark wood floors. Harry stood up, blood rushing to the tight muscles in his legs as he walked towards the door. There, lying innocently on the floor, was a broken Snitch wing.
Temptations Nightclub.

Harry wouldn’t leave this damn pitch until he felt the soft feathers of the Snitch clasped between his warm hands.
Electricity. Shocks alighting his every nerve ending.
It bubbled through him, making his limbs jittery. He gripped his hands onto the wood of his Firebolt, Quidditch robes billowing softly behind him. The commentator was saying something in the distance, but all Harry could focus on was the smell of fresh air, broom polish, and clean robes. Lemon and wood.
He stepped away from the blonde man and turned to Malfoy. There was something in his eyes that Harry couldn’t decipher, but he was too far gone to care.
were the one who called me a ponce.”
Malfoy’s teeth nipped at the skin on Harry’s neck, as if he either didn’t care or had completely forgotten that they weren’t alone. He licked a slow stripe up the tendons on Harry's neck, sucking on it between soft, plush lips.
“Tell me, Draco, do you still believe in all that prejudice?”
He snaked one arm around Malfoy’s waist, and with the other, held his palm around his jaw, coaxing Malfoy's head out of the crook of Harry’s neck. Malfoy’s eyes were dark and half-lidded, the colour of coal. His movements were slow, languid, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat as he stared at Malfoy. The way the fluorescent lights in the studio painted his face in a wash of shadow and light. The shape of his nose, the way wet strands of gold hair stuck to his cheeks, water droplets running down his face and into the sharp hollow of his collarbone.
Harry nodded, but only really to placate her, because he wasn’t entirely sure of the meaning behind her rushed drivel.
“Look who's talking,” he all but growled, a low stretch of notes that curdled his tongue, a poisonous whisper that licked the small space between them.
Apolline didn’t even spare him a glance as she smirked at Malfoy. “You heard the man, don’t keep him waiting.”
Harry could play a good game in any weather, but it was games spent under the soft glare of the sun that he craved most. Sweat along his brow and down the nape of his neck—it reminded him of lazy afternoons spent at the Burrow with everyone he loved, back when he could wrap his arms around Ginny when she scored a goal and get distracted by the taste of her lips. Back when everything was quiet and simple.
“Terribly sorry, Mr. Potter, there’s nothing I can do,” the secretary had said, not even attempting to sound sympathetic. “You can make a formal complaint—though, you must know that we don’t hold any liability. It’s not defamation when there’s no name attached.”
This was bliss. It rendered him speechless, a startling sort of numbness that made his heart pump overdrive. Numb everywhere but in the taste and the heat of Draco’s mouth. As their tongues slotted together, he inhaled that familiar cocktail of citrus lemon. But here, in this moment, Harry was more aware, more sober than he had ever been before.
“People would much rather read the
“But we are,” Harry said.
Draco stared at a Potter he only recognised in his mind. He spoke to a Potter he only remembered from before they were even eighteen. Now, he sounded different, and he looked different, too. More broad, more square, more sharp. There were lines on his face that he hadn’t seen before, scars that his fingerprints hadn’t learnt about.
Harry reached down and grabbed it, thumbing it between his fingers; it felt soft and silky against the rough calluses of his hand. He was reminded of blonde hair, the feeling of running his hands from Draco’s scalp to the short hairs at his nape. An endless expanse of smoothness, of pale milkiness. Touch as soft as a feather.
Now Malfoy was completely silent, and he stared at Harry with narrowed eyes and an ugly curl to his lips. His hands were clenched by his side, his posture pin-straight like an overstrung bow. He gritted his teeth. “Correct me if I’m wrong, Potter, but you already did that last week on the Quidditch pitch. In front of everyone.” Malfoy's gaze travelled down to Harry’s hand, where the remnants of his actions painted his knuckles purple and blue.
“Of course I already know that,” he snapped as he whirled around. Potter smiled at him, cruel and mocking, a mirror of Draco’s expression. “I’m tethering on the brink of desperation if I’m here, staring at you of all people.”
Harry’s stomach lurched.
In those moments, Draco’s name did not save him, but as he wiped the silent tears from a young boy’s face, he couldn’t find it in himself to care anymore.
Score
Light blue paint spread and dripped down the white walls surrounding them as plush moss sprouted and covered the glossy floor. Tiny blue flowers with bright, yellow centres bloomed around their feet, and the room was permeated with the soft scent of fresh grass and open air. The soothing pitter-patter of water trickled behind them, and Harry whipped around to see a large waterfall meet the lazy ebb and flow of a lake.
he drawled.
Draco turned to face the Black Lake again and saw the blurry image of Potter standing beside him in the window’s reflection. He couldn’t help but remember cold condensation and fingerprints painting a mirror all those months ago. The desperation to touch hadn’t so much as ebbed, but Potter was like a Forbidden Fruit. He’d take a bite, taste the sweetness on his lips, only to be poisoned in the end.
“So, I drunkenly snog one bloke with blonde hair and now everyone thinks I get off on Malfoy?”
Harry dipped the tip of his quill into the ink, and watched it drip and fall into the stream. As each droplet kissed the river, it bloomed and bled like swirls of watercolour. Harry brought the quill to Draco’s skin and ran a thumb along the curve of a purple vein. Draco jumped at the cold touch, and goosebumps lit his skin aflame.
Harry leaned in, whispering in Malfoy’s ear. “This is what you wanted, isn’t it? For it to be only us. You and me. Harry and
homophobic, you bastard.”
Harry closed the newspaper with shaking hands. It made a heavy clamour as it fell face first to the table, and he incinerated it with a strong burst of wandless magic that bubbled out of him.
Draco placed the notebook under his pillow and fell into the deep haze of sleep.
His angry scrawl from yesterday was still there; rough, sharp lines from the scratch of his quill nib, black ink bleeding and blurred around the edges.
The sound echoed around the room with a deafening screech from the feedback of his Sonorous charm.
When the lake lapped at the window of his dormitory, morning sun slipping through the deep blue, Draco wiped the sleep out of his tired eyes and reached underneath his pillow, cold fingers meeting smooth leather.
Draco hated tattoos, a poison so dense they made his stomach churn. Since sixth year when the snake and the skull burned a bitter, black trail down his arm. His damaged nerves, crammed like spindles underneath the Mark, were so far removed from flesh that it had become his very own burial.
Harry couldn’t fight the smile on his face. “I’d much rather be wrapped up in you, if I’m honest.”
He held his hands underneath the running spray, and perhaps, if the water was hot enough, it would wash away all he had just done. Cleanse himself from the thoughts that plagued his mind, drown out the noises until the memories were nothing but a hazy, bad dream. Lost to the shadows of the night.
When he dried himself off, his skin crimson and torn, Draco hated tattoos just that little bit more.
“They want us to show the media we’ve come to a truce. We pretend to be friends, they bring in a couple of witches to dispel your queer scandal.
Malfoy. I didn’t mean the sexual kind, I meant the
Harry tugged at Malfoy’s robes until he was eye level, driving his knuckles right into the soft space between his neck and collarbone. Malfoy hissed in pain, but his lips curled into a smile that was absolutely feral, as if Harry was doing exactly what he wanted him to. At that moment, however, Harry couldn’t have cared less about the
“It’s the truth. Face it. You could have had absolutely anyone, but every time you had the chance, who did you choose? Tall, bratty blondes. You might as well have called my name in front of the whole fucking club.”
But here, in this strange moment, Draco couldn’t stop looking, couldn’t stop listening. He hung on to every beat with bated breath. Enraptured, completely and utterly lost. As if he were slipping with nothing to keep him afloat.
Harry couldn’t help a small laugh escape him. Malfoy caught it, lapped at his laugh with a slow lick of his tongue. “You’re a bit strange,” Harry breathed.
“You’ve never written anything in the notebook before,” Draco mused, resting the side of his head in the crook of Harry’s neck.
is terminated. We’re last in all betting pools. Do I need to say more?”
Bludgers curved around him while Quaffles soared through the air in practiced predictability. Harry’s eyes threaded the sky for a glint of gold, but his gaze stuttered on something far off in the distance: messy hair, glittering under the sunshine which draped over Draco’s body like silk.
Winding, cobblestone streets stretched before him, and he inhaled the smell of midnight rain and moss. It was a small muggle town, bustling with strangers whose faces blurred together. Draco matched his breathing with the hum of life. Shoes as they clicked on stone, the pitter-patter of water falling on leaves. The clinking of glasses and the laughter that travelled with the breeze.
Harry mirrored his position, their bare shoulders touching as Harry stared down at the duvet covering their laps. His fingers pulled at the material. “Why are you so obsessed with the media?”
“Stop it.”
He stood at the opposite end of the room, watching despite the disgust that coursed through his veins. He hated tattoos. The way they were a constant, cruel reminder of his weakness. His childish mistakes.
he said through gritted teeth. “Next time, I won't be so fucking generous.”
Harry didn’t quite know what to take from that. He shook his head and sighed into the heavy, stale air. His breath fluttered out in front of him. “You do know that this is all your fault, right?” he said. “No matter what your intentions were.”
Plus, he really,
He tipped his head back as he sighed, trying to fill the lasting silence that permeated the room. Maybe if he sighed loud enough, it would drown out the ringing sound of the door shutting behind Draco.
There was a narrow strip of houses, cluttered in a tight row. The buildings were stacked haphazardly skyward, and the facades loomed down low. Wooden sign-boards, weathered and chipped by age, hung on by a thread and creaked when he walked just as night met the day.
In the reflection of the floor, Malfoy’s eyes narrowed at the woman, but she either didn’t notice the heavy awkwardness that blanketed the room, or she simply didn’t care because she continued to speak in her too-quick cadence, barely stopping to take a breath.
articles ran!”
“No, I’m not. But by the pitiful state you’re in, you might as well be.”
“Harry.” Deverill eyed him from across the desk, leaning forward, his eyebrows drawn into a deep set frown. “I understand how you feel about this. Trust me, I do. But the rumours have gone too far. The
Harry pulled away.
Harry had lost yet another one of Malfoy’s games.
Darkness swallows us, but through the crack in my glasses, all I can see is Malfoy. My senses drown with him. I haven’t had a lick of alcohol and yet I’m completely drunk. The dim lights in the club pulse with tension, and Malfoy’s body preens under it, glistening and wet.
back into the good books. Pretending your star players aren’t fags by publicly parading us with a pair of tits.”
Rain. wind, and ozone. The harsh thump of a wooden door.
The breeze wafted through his hair, caressing his skin. The smell of ozone and sweat. The rush of blood to his head as gravity pulled him from his legs.
“There’s no need to trail my broom, you know. It’s still too early for the Snitch,” Draco drawled over the roar of the wind. Harry’s stomach swooped at hearing his voice again; he wanted to bathe in the sound of Draco’s long vowels, his slow slur. The way he made simple words bend to his will, dripping from his tongue in a lazy type of luxury.
“I told you to let it go.”
But Malfoy had always been the exception.
Draco bit his lip, which was chapped from the wind, and Harry wanted nothing more than to trace his tongue along each split. “We’re currently in a game.”
insignia bloomed into focus against his chest.
He wanted and he craved, and this was the only thought pulsing through him as he pushed his way through the loud thumping music of the club. It was a poisonous want that pushed Harry forward, urging him towards Malfoy, who seemed similarly pulled to Harry. Like oil sliding through water, they parted the sea of strangers until they were so close, Harry could almost taste the blood red wine on the tip of Malfoy’s lips.
attractive to lesbians!” He said a bit too loudly.
Blood rushed all the way to Harry’s head. The expanse of green enveloped around them as the Snitch careened teasingly above their heads. Harry’s fingers brushed fluttering wings, but Draco’s leather-bound hand knocked into his, both of them fighting to wrap their fists around gold.
Two: his Firebolt stopped its plummeting descent and shot up towards his outstretched hand like a magnet.
Draco wore the growth of five years well on his skin. Faint age lines peaked around the edges of his eyes, marking a long journey of time and change along his face. Skin cured like a clay sculpture, permanent fingerprints etched between the scars of his past, a reminder of how far he had come. A reminder of all the life he still had yet to live.
“Boring question. Potter gets off on saving people so I’d hardly call it anything else than what it is: fuel for his fantasies.”
Malfoy laughed, low and rough from his throat. “Well, well—now isn’t that just titillating? What do
“How else can I say it?”
“Well, at least one of us can see,” Harry quipped, just so he could see the softness play on Draco’s features again.
“Mr. Potter, sir, does this mean you’re confirming—” his hand shot up in the air, silencing the nameless reporter.
“I should be offended that you think so little of me, no?” Her lips were thin and painted red, and when she spoke, she had a small smudge of it on her teeth. Harry tried not to stare at it out of politeness.
Then, Harry began to close the remaining distance, one long second at a time. It was so slow, so questioning. Giving Malfoy the opportunity to move away. He could push him, turn his head. But Malfoy stayed completely still as the seconds ticked by, as the water gushed against their skin, every drop like a countdown. A steady pulse. A rhythm like the pounding of Harry’s chest.
But Draco felt nothing.
! Let’s begin,” she said as she clapped her hands together. “Off! Shirt off!”
He shrugged his shoulders. “I can be anything you imagine me to be.”
kind. I want to physically rough you up with my hands—but, aggressively. I want to punch your face in...
“Draco, take the jumper off him.”
“Congratulations.” Malfoy deadpanned, a pained grimace on his face. “Now run along to Millie, you’re ruining my pulling game.”
He stared up at Harry, held a hand to his face and brought their foreheads together. The river lapped at their backs, But Harry’s touch was a burning, glistening warmth against the icy fall of the waves.
The first time it happened, Draco thought he was so far gone there was no point arguing with himself about the logistics of the matter. So that’s why, when he saw Potter walk through the door of the Slytherin dormitory he said “Hello,” instead of “How the fuck are you here?”
Table sticky.
Harry wanted more, more, more.
Harry gulped, but he stared at Draco’s eyes with an unyielding conviction that it was hard to look anywhere else. And Draco swallowed his every word like an addict, a beggar. Wanting
The snake constricted his skin, a poisonous inky venom tainting the blood that pumped through him.
It was a reminder of the way things could change in an instant; a fragile feather slipping from the warmth of his hands and into a blistering storm. Holding Draco’s cheeks between his palms in one moment, and Draco walking away in the next.
No one answered.
head office, only to be met with blank expressions and roundabout excuses.
The first person to speak up, Harry recognised instantly as that damned secretary of Skeeter’s. He fought against himself to stay quiet and not spit something he’d later regret.
“Sleeping in public seems quite uncouth for a Malfoy. What would your father say?
Harry breathed out through his nose in a short, loud succession.
credibility through the mud since those fucking
Malfoy didn’t look at him.
Draco moved closer, and as the sky made space for them, Harry’s body thrummed. Draco’s scent engulfed Harry; he inhaled lemon and wood. He was greedy for more, so he moved an inch closer.
She was spending way too much time with Ginny, and that was a scary thought. He respected both women individually—Bulstrode was a fantastic beater, mind, and Ginny was, well
shirt that was pearly white. Until it wasn’t. Because then it was a bit blue, and a bit pink, and it was so many colours. Too many colours. And the shirt had the indecency to be unbuttoned all the way down to his sternum, and it was way too much skin.
“Dunno, Hermione says it’s my brain making up for missing Ron.”
He wanted to say no, but it was as though a whirl of magic took control. Beckoning him to give in and close his eyes, because after all, Draco must not tell lies.
“Everything.” Draco’s voice was distant.
“This is important.”
Deverill raised a dark eyebrow, and the lines on his forehead deepened with the tired expression on his face. Any other time, Harry would’ve made a joke about irreversible signs of ageing and pension status. He didn’t, though, because Harry had an impeccable sense of judgement and thus kept his mouth firmly shut.
you boys are useless.”
uniform would.”
The smooth rhythm of the Black Lake swelled to a crescendo as the waves crashed to the shore. Draco studied it’s movements with blurry eyes, his cheek resting on the cold glass. The way the water moved, and rippled, and pulled and swirled, inviting everything into its current, then pushing it all away.
“What’s one thing you don’t mind about me?”
“Well, public humiliation of one
Your entire life can change in a single second.
“It’s not.”
“Err, like...
Realistically, he couldn’t understand why she was so mad.
Harry almost convinced himself he could feel the waves of anticipation roll off Draco’s body as he stared into the distance, grey eyes made of flint. Draco stared at the crowds—and Harry stared at Draco. He stared up at the horizon—Harry still stared at Draco. He stared at the expanse of hills in the distance, plush green and hazy from the wisps of fog in the air—and Harry stared at nothing but Draco.
“You never answered my question,” Malfoy whispers, and the feeling of his sweet breath against my cheek sends me high on a sugar rush. My hands slide into his hair, fingering fine threads of silk. I coax a low hum from his throat, breathless and ruined.
won’t have anything more to say about it, and there'll be no more rumours about you and I being together. The focus will be back on Quidditch games and we can forget any of this ever happened.”
, because he hated him, hated how fit he looked right now. And that thought sobered him enough to make him feel sick to his stomach.
“What’s the worst that can happen?”
Closer. So close. He could taste his victory with every inhale of oxygen.
“Enough! That’s enough!”
Delicious delirium, just how he liked it.
Quidditch robes curve around Malfoy’s every sharp line and muscle. His head tips back and I drink the bead of sweat slipping down his throat with my eyes. Silver flickers to green, a glass of Butterbeer between blush-pink lips.
“Oh! How awfully crass of me,” Malfoy drawled, his hand clutched to his chest. “I should have led you a nice, straight path to the Snitch, instead.”
in the position right now to get a stiffy. He was not.
Malfoy dragged his eyes up and down his body with a dark expression of superiority, and Harry felt the slow appraisal shake his very bones.
Neither did Harry.
The reporter’s words barked in his ears, nipped at the sensitive spot in the back of his mind. It repeated, over and over and over again, until it was so loud and so consuming that it drowned out the sound of his own voice, which was a shattered, broken whisper against the clattering crescendo of vitriol. He crumbled with it, the weight. Back arched low to the cold and dirty steel.
He wandered with a purpose but no destination, only following lanterns on brick walls, and glowing street lamps on wet roads. In a life where he had been manhandled and manicured to live, and act, and be someone he wasn’t, it was nice to get away from it all. Even for a moment. A small reprieve, where he could walk the cobblestone streets wherever they took him.
Harry cleared his throat. The thought hadn’t even crossed his mind to look away, to give Malfoy some privacy, because the only voice that rang inside of his head was a frenzied blur of
“What are we supposed to... do?” Harry croaked.
surrounding it. He stood up, looking down at them with a strained, pitying smile. “Your appointment is at half nine on Friday, boys. It’s only a small team, real professional, your knackers will be covered. That’s final.”
Draco
Draco smiled. He wished it didn’t look as bitter as he knew it did. “Mother used to say it all the time. When goodbye is too painful of a word to speak, meet me in Paris when I’m no longer there.”
“That’s a bloody reach if I’ve ever heard one.”
For once maybe he and Malfoy were fighting the same battle.
“Draco,” he called, when he was close enough. Draco whirled around, his eyes focusing on Harry again. “Heads or Tails?”
Aunt Marge in lace pantyhose. Aunt Marge in lace pantyhose. Aunt Marge in—
When he was sober, Harry often questioned how he had let himself come to this, but just as often, the answer dissolved into the sweet taste of tequila flavoured lip gloss, a heavy hand pulling at his hair, and another victory against Malfoy in the palm of his hands.
a quill and an inkpot, and began to write.
Harry refused to break eye contact.
glad that you’re here. I thought—I didn’t want to think that you hadn’t made it past eighteen, and after the war, you just left, no one knew anything, and I started to think that maybe I had spent my chance.”
“A very heartwarming speech, Potter. But if I may,” Malfoy turned to the sea of reporters with a distasteful expression on his face, “I’m quite the busy man, and as this is a
“You’re killing yourself,” Malfoy says as he takes the cigarette from my lips and sucks it in between his own. This familiar dance we’ve been toying with sparks a fire within me. We’re teetering on the edge, seconds before slipping—the adrenaline is intoxicating, I want to melt into Malfoy's mouth. His hands. His stare. I’m dripping with the desperate desire, but I stay exactly where I am. Too close to breathe, too far that I might collapse with the need.
I refuse to give into him, but with every one of his piercing smirks I feel my inhibitions wither. I want him, and Malfoy knows, and yet we both pretend this is nothing more than the thrill of seeing the other person break.
At practice the morning after the article broke, his teammates had stared at him as he walked into the locker room to change into his kit. They stared at him like they didn’t know who he was. On any other day, he would’ve welcomed that feeling; but this time, as the stares followed and the whispers chased, he couldn’t help but feel pried open.
Harry stared at the looming shape of the door as light from the hallway crept between the hinges, crawling from underneath the threshold and into the darkness of his bedroom. A tease of what he was missing on the other side. Of what he had lost just after he had found it, like gold slipping through the palm of a leather-bound hand.
“What does this mean?”
Malfoy with his addicting, sugar-coated lips, always beckoning me closer.
Draco looked everywhere, turned the entire dormitory upside down. Pillows lined the floor, sheets upended around him, and Draco was knee deep in his extendable trunk, tearing through old robes that no longer fit and piles of chocolate wrappers his Mother would tell him off for if she knew.
Their brooms were nose to nose, now, and he could see each one of Draco’s exhales leave his lips, kissing the air between them.
“Naivety is not a good look on you.”
Harry licked his lips, and Malfoy’s eyes lapped up the movement as if he craved something sinful too.
Paint me with your fingerprints and bring me back to life.
And then, they kicked off.
Pretty goodbyes mean nothing against the sound of your voice whispering hello.
Harry grabbed the collar of Draco’s robes with both hands and they were kissing again.
Another step back.
The Ministry conference room was spacious in a claustrophobic way, echoing walls painted in a too-bright white. A cacophony of voices yelled over each other, desperate to be heard like howling hound dogs against a thunderous night. Harry’s head pounded, a searing pain that travelled from his temples to the back of his eyelids. He felt nauseous with it, his insides a viscous ink that churned and oozed and dribbled throughout his body.
But he could do nothing except stare into the sea of screaming bodies, nod his head and smile as the reporters asked him increasingly intrusive questions, voices overlapping as they jostled for his attention.
Oliver would yell.
git in sexy clothes. Did someone spike his drink? He slid off the barstool and swatted Bulstrode’s spiky fingers away from his knee. The room wasn’t spinning,
Draco placed his hand on the mirror and wiped at the condensation.
Harry liked to call this game the beginning of the end. They played on the only day during the whole summer that had treacherous storms. In hindsight, it was pretty fitting for the whirlwind that followed.
Silence fell.
“This was a mistake,” Draco said, and he turned around, fully dressed and finally meeting Harry’s gaze. Harry grabbed his own pants from the floor and stood in front of Draco; his stomach constricted as he felt Draco’s eyes pour over him. “I mean, I don’t regret it. But you—” Draco held his hand out in front of him, stopping Harry from moving any closer, “—just...
“It’s not—” he sighed, running his hands through the lengths of his hair. Hermione’s angry mug of tea was making his hair damp. For all Hermione's insistence that Harry practice Mindfulness, it was clear she wasn't doing the best job at it herself. He didn’t dare to tell her that though; he rather liked to keep his bollocks intact. “It’s not about my career, it’s about freedom.”
The moment had come. They reached their arms out at the same time, and Harry's fist clenched over something smooth. Malfoy's did the same.
going to help us at all?”
“May the best team win,” Malfoy said as Oliver and Flint shook hands. And at that moment, Harry was brought back to Hogwarts. To childhood innocence and betting everything on the House Cup. Gryffindor versus Slytherin. Right versus Wrong. Him versus the World. Even though it had been a couple of years since he had left Hogwarts, the memories were still startling. Flying was the only reprieve he’d ever had from the horrors of his childhood, and in a way, he always thought that this freedom was the reason he got into Professional Quidditch in the first place, instead of the Aurors like everyone expected.
He opened his eyes, and through the blurriness, the reflection in the mirror hadn’t ebbed. It stared at him, silent and commanding, taunting him of everything he was not. An amalgamation of all his faults wrapped up into one pretty scar of goodness. Because that’s what Potter was. Everything he could never be.
Harry ran his fingers along the slip of skin on Draco’s wrist, thumbing the button that rested on his bone. He threaded it out of the hole, and rolled, and rolled, and rolled, until Draco’s crisp shirt folded neatly at his elbow.
“What are you doing?”
gaining momentum in the air. He fought with his aching muscles to twist his body to right his broom again, and they finally touched the hard ground with a heavy jolt. Malfoy’s weight crumbled over the top of him as they lay on the mud-soaked grass.
“Draco, has told me much about you, Harry Potter.”
Harry let instinct take over, as he pushed his body to its limits, and then some. His body ached with the tension in his muscles, but the only thought that echoed through his mind was—
“You’re
“I—okay. Would you like a tattoo?”
Nothing but Draco.
stopped him before he could touch it.
Harry sighed. He really should have considered charging people an exorbitant amount of Galleons for uttering his name in every one of their stupid questions. At least Malfoy seemed to share his annoyance.
“Erm, okay?”
He pulled away from the man’s lips, and a camera flashed in his face. He smiled at it, low and threatening. Because he had forgotten his own name. Forgotten the consequences of his actions. Lost himself to the thrill of the game. Bliss and oblivion.
But Potter only stepped closer, sitting on the edge of the grass. The river twinkled in front of them, a reflection of a thousand glowing stars. Their sides were aligned, thigh against thigh as he undid the laces on his shoes, submerging his feet into the cavernous blue.
Harry brushed his thumb over the length of the wing as he walked over to his bedside table and opened it. Lying in the drawer was a twin feather—Harry’s half of the broken Snitch.
And another the next night. And another. And another. And another.
“I think you’re beautiful.”
Draco
The first time Draco wrote something in the notebook, he called it stupid.
“Good.” Harry’s voice was low and raspy from sleep. “What are you doing all the way up there?”
Draco pulled away. “Why,” he said, his mouth barely even moving.
Freedom was a luxury not offered to the criminally insane. But that was a past mindset, one riddled and broken by war and fear. Draco deserved to live, he deserved freedom just as much as the morally righteous.
“Don’t know if you noticed, but it’s not quite the right time.”
He felt the outline of a broken wing in the pocket of his jeans, digging into his hip bone. The weight of it—although feather light—was anchoring. He didn’t know why he had put so much importance into it, or why he even kept it, because it was half of the reason he was in this situation in the first place.
We’re falling. I’ve fallen under. I slip down to my knees.
“We’ll all have our time, Draco. Yours isn’t now.”
Game? Terribly stupid idea that Harry would definitely
Malfoy's fingers toyed with the lapels of his robes, and he stared Harry straight in the eye, unblinking, as he pushed the sides of the robes apart, brushing them off Harry's shoulders and letting the fabric fall to the lake below with a heavy splash.
You’re actually thinking of something.” Potter laughed, and it was loud and consuming and right from the belly. It was a jarring, obnoxious sound against the silence of the night, but Draco found himself leaning into it.
One: his magic surged through his body, a sheer force of power that sent electric shocks from the length of his spine to the tips of his fingers. He smelt it through the air, like burnt rubble and voltaic ozone.
“How can everyone know how you feel about me when
“I can’t imagine you as the belly laughing sort. I feel you’d be more subdued to draw less attention to yourself. Am I right, Potter?”
His hand was clenched around empty, stale air, nails digging holes into black leather gloves.
He was not going to let the stupid tosser ruin this any more then he already had. Sure, you could argue that this whole situation was almost equally Harry’s fault, but he wasn’t the one who proposed the daft
He heard Apolline sigh. “I feel sorry for any partner of yours, Mr. Potter.”
Draco turned around to face Potter, the tips of their shoes touched, and Draco’s body was already thrumming. “No, that’s not what I need.” Potter’s breath tickled his cheek and Draco swayed into his current. Their shoulders brushed for an entire second, Potter said nothing. “Why do you only come at night?” Draco asked for the third time, hoping for a different answer.
“Meaning?”
“What’s the worst that could happen?” he had said to Hermione barely a few weeks ago, like the stupid, ignorant shit he was.
And Harry should never have felt the depths of his disappearance, because how could one miss what was not theirs to kiss? But somewhere deep within the caverns of his mind he lost himself in a fantasy life: The warm touch of hands cruising along his chest, down the hard plains of muscle, and the tease of lips against the pulse of Malfoy’s pale wrist. He wanted, and he craved, and his skin burned with a fire untamed.
Draco rolled his eyes, but to Harry, it looked fond. “You’re useless.”
Rain, wind, and thunderous skies. The higher he flew, the more black the world became as rain pummelled his face and cracked a thin line across his glasses. He climbed the skies, his body burned and screamed at him to slow down; he pushed on, his chest flush to the broom.
So he did, and Harry found himself staring at a grumbling goblin head, unsure of what it meant. But by the vicious look on Malfoy’s face, he knew he had made one of the most piss-poor decisions of his life, one he couldn’t even blame on alcohol.
“I snog a couple of guys with blonde hair and that still doesn’t mean I like the bastard.”
Heat. So much heat.
“No?”
The deal we made with
“So you do have the capability to listen after all. You just choose to be difficult.”
shoving things down because what I
he had said.
Draco drummed his fingers to a silent rhythm; it rang over the piercing white noise rushing in his ears. “I think I’ve gone completely off the deep end, you know. Lost cause, and all.”
“You’re an arse.”
Beside him, he heard Draco sigh—soft, barely a hitch of his breath. “You don’t remember when they outed me, do you?”
The Quidditch pitch was a world of noise. The stadium, full to capacity, had reporters standing on every corner, their Quick-Quotes Quills held at attention and their cameras aimed at the sky. This was the first game between
“Malfoy?”
“Look at this! We’ve got no sponsors left.
People were talking as if Harry hadn’t been drunk off his tits. As if he remembered anything besides the blur of movement. Of heat. Of bodies up against bodies.
and the
Malfoy’s nostrils flared, like a horse, but a very angry horse that wore arousing attire. He liked men, not horses. Malfoy was a horse, and he hated horses.
And Harry craved for a drop. Just one. Just to taste. Just to see what it would be like.
Behind him, the tap continued to gurgle, the sound of splattering water pounding against steel. Loud and deafening. He flicked his hand and the water shut off with a strangled swallow. Silence consumed the room as Harry stared at Malfoy, the only sound to break the stillness was the echo of stray water droplets. A constant rhythm against steel; a countdown.
“I’m wearing your clothes.”
the newspaper and drank up the last few seconds of ignorant bliss before his world would come crashing down around him.
Well. Harry could have easily done that, but he didn’t. And the next time he saw Malfoy, he was more than four drinks deep into absolute bliss and oblivion.
“It’s fine, you can’t do anything about it now. Just don’t disappear again.”
The photo flickered, and a streak of static pulsed through the parchment as the image changed over. In the corner, a small number
What part of that don’t you understand?” Her hands were clasped around her hot mug of tea. The steam drew patterns in the air and swirled through the frizzy ends of her curls.
The image flickered, and another one took its place. As Harry stared at it, enthralled, he felt something swoop in the depths of his stomach. Warm and stabilising, it coursed through him. It felt something like
It sounded, in the remnants of his mind, eerily similar to remorse. And Harry didn’t quite know what to do with that.
. The world around them was nothing more than a blurry afterthought. Harry’s senses were completely consumed by the sensations across his skin. The cold, icy caress of wind made his body shiver. But the warmth of Draco’s lips, the touch of his hands; those heated Harry from within.
Deverill exhaled through his nose and stacked the Quidditch magazines into a neat pile on top of the desk, which looked an odd sight amongst the mess of loose paper and crumbled up balls of the
“Fuck off, you arrogant prick.”
Of plummeting through the air, whipping words, broken noses and broken Snitches. The thrill that had coursed through him as he felt his fingers brush soft feathers a second before Malfoy’s broom barrelled into him.
“You don’t know, or you don’t want to tell me?”
He didn’t answer for a while, unsure whether he should tell the truth. But he mapped Potter’s hand like he was seeing a new constellation for the first time. Potter let him, and so Draco traced the lines in his palm, the calluses on his fingers, the scars that stretched his skin and made him real. Made him human. Made him a bit broken just like Draco.
This place looked more fitting as one of the floors up at St. Mungo’s than it did as a photography studio. Harry frowned. “I expected a line up of half-naked witches. This looks...
Harry drummed his fingers on the table, a sheepish grin on his face. “It was a good incentive, sure, but still not the point.”
“What question?”
Draco opened the notebook, and turned to the first page to see if something,
Burning and caving into each other’s body as if this was the only place Harry belonged, he succumbed to darkness, moving on feeling and intuition alone. But as he discovered the familiarity of Draco’s mouth once more, his vision was alight with bursts of colour that sparked behind his eyelids.
, and slackened the grip of his thighs. Somehow, using a complicated maneuver that only the most elegant and flexible player could have pulled off, Draco untangled himself from Harry and swung himself over the handle so that he was now sitting right-side-up on the broom. Harry left to dangle upside-down. Their bodies mirrored each other, like a reflection in a lake. Two sides of the same coin.
“I have enough,” and his voice was eerily rough. But Harry didn’t really know what he meant, so he nodded his head as if he understood the words he said.
Malfoy stepped out of his space, and it felt like, for just a second, Harry’s entire world collapsed into itself. He inhaled a haggard breath, and the air around him felt electric with the heavy presence of Malfoy, with the smell of him, a dark cologne of musky wood and the sweet notes of citrus cocktails. If only he could find a way to lick the air, Harry would be able to taste him against his lips.
“Oh, don’t stop on my account boys. It was just getting interesting.”
Harry stopped just before he could feel the trace of Malfoy’s lips. He breathed in the smell of lemon and wood.
“When did you become so reckless?”
In the wake of Draco’s absence, Harry wanted nothing more than to cave into the space he had left behind. He wanted to be filled, completely and fully—in Draco’s warmth. The urge curled inside him, like static electricity that travelled from the depths of his chest to the tips of his fingers as he touched the wing Draco had kept since the very match that had started it all.
wasn’t going to help me win the war... And when it got too much, it all just spilled over until the only thing left inside me was the numbness.”
He sighed. “Come off it, Potter. Stop wallowing here alone in self-pity. Where’s that going to get you? The
Three years had made its mark on Draco, it squeezed his chin into a sharper point, stretched his lips, and hollowed out his cheeks. His eyes were still round and large, though, glinting silver. Soft, puffy skin pillowed underneath.
“Heads or Tails, Potter?”
“I just didn’t expect you to—”
fantasise about Harry Potter?”
“Are you coming, or are you just going to stand there and watch me?” Suddenly, Malfoy was ankle deep in the lake, fitted grey trousers darkening with every step backwards, the water caressing his knees.
Draco’s gaze darted across Harry’s face before coming to rest on his eyes again. “You just look more vulnerable.”
Their flying styles truly couldn't have been more different. Malfoy had such precision in the air, as if every small movement was calculated and evaluated seconds before he danced in tandem with the sky. He was a showman, a performer.
Wrapped in the arms of pleasure. Wrapped in the embrace of each other.
“You have me,” Harry whispered as their bodies undulated. A constant ebb and flow, the caress of a bottomless ocean diving into the deep, unfathomable abyss.
And then, Malfoy's final words, repulsive in its seductiveness, managed to carve themselves a home in the recesses of his mind. A repetitive driving force that fueled the devil on his shoulder. A slow drawl, the words dripped from his lips like an enticing poison. Like liquid gold.
Harry grimaced, but didn’t say anything.
Draco shrugged his shoulders and nestled his cheek further into Potter’s pillow. “How about: meet me in Paris when I’m no longer there.”
Three months later, Draco took the notebook to Hogwarts with him.
Harry cleared his throat, and the sound bounced ominously off the walls. He had probably just misheard her, so he muttered a small “Sorry?”
“Listen, Harry, level with me here. I don’t know the history between you two, but you need to keep it in your pants.
want to feel the soft strands between the warmth of his fingertips.
Harry saw the world through half-shut, blurry eyes. Vibrant colours assaulted his vision, but as one swig followed the next, it seemed to bother him less and less. Bulstrode hadn’t left his side since they’d all rocked up at the club, and he was stuck sitting at a crowded bar as she chatted up the (admittedly fit) bartender. Every time he turned to leave, she’d pierce her nails into his knee without even breaking eye contact with the (admittedly fit) bartender. She gave him sideways glances, her lips pursed to one side in an expression that reminded him eerily of somebody.
If this is the end, tell me you’ll stay, and I’ll play pretend.
The stadium erupted with noise, thumping feet and thunderous cheers puncturing the air. Harry flew the both of them to the ground, and they rolled with the impact of touchdown. Draco lay over him, his legs straddling Harry’s hips. His face was painted in shock. “Did that just happen?” he asked incredulously.
Moonlight licked his body in ribbons of silver thread. Shadows strung along the horizon, as towering trees dipped towards their fallen leaves. The ebb and flow of the river echoed in a slow, beating pulse, but all Harry could hear was the deep gasping breaths that exhaled from the depths of Draco’s chest. It was music to his ears, a swelling symphony that coalesced with the whispers of night.
That’s when Longbottom and the youngest Weasley stepped in, an answer to Hogwarts’ calls for help.
“So do you,” he said as he moved a tiny bit closer; their chests almost touched. He felt Malfoy’s heat consume him, and he became heady with the scent of musky cologne, liquor, and sweat. He inhaled it, his eyes fluttered shut for a moment, and he slipped even further into oblivion.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, whose gaze was locked heavily on each one of their photos. His jaw was set tight, something playing in the darkness of his eyes, but Deverill’s hard voice made Malfoy’s head snap up before Harry could pick apart Malfoy’s expression.
Spring was in the air. It tasted like rebirth and the fresh breath of mint; the colours were a vibrant palette of paint as they brushed over the earth in a soft pitter-patter of rain. Harry loved this season. He spent his days in a lazy haze and his nights submerged in the unfrozen pool of the waves.
When Draco first opened the notebook, he didn’t know what he had expected. Perhaps he expected something magical, a thrum of pure power pulsing through his body, righting all the wrongs of the world with the very fibres of plain parchment. Perhaps he expected one of those
“But I—I thought this wasn’t that kind of photoshoot?” he said uselessly.
He couldn’t quite tell for sure, but Harry was almost certain he heard Draco laugh from behind the blanket of wind surrounding them. “You’re quite the sweet talker. I didn’t know you had it in you.”
Malfoy laughed, a low and strained sound that echoed off the bathroom walls. It sounded slightly deranged, as if Malfoy was holding a whirlwind of thoughts back with every bark of laughter. His eyes were blown wide, and Harry was startled into complete silence. “You’re a lot of things, Potter, but straight isn’t one of them.”
Father had bought Draco a new Potions textbook for his birthday. He said it was an advanced Master’s book that Draco wouldn’t be able to find in the
Until one strange night, when months had collapsed into years, it wasn’t.
meant much more than the situation they were currently in. He understood the meaning behind those words as he stared into the deep pools of Malfoy’s eyes. As he felt the trail of thin scars run up his torso, raised and cold against the calluses of Harry’s palm.
The first time it happened, Draco had stumbled across it accidentally.
Malfoy was met with the sweet sound of silence, and for the first time since Harry walked into the joint, he basked in its sereneness. His migraine quieted almost to a standstill.
Harry's eyes never left Malfoy’s, and Malfoy looked as though he was sinking, as if Harry’s touch was the only solid thing that was keeping him upright.
who stood in formation in front of them. Pointing him towards Draco.
“What the fuck are you doing just sitting there, Potter? Go find the Snitch!” he shouted.
Apolline clapped her hands. “Perfect. Now, we’re ready. Off you go.”
But that wouldn’t happen again, for this time he would descend to the ground with the Snitch held tightly in his grasp and another win for
“Harry.”
Unless that war began with a pointy git, and ended with a well-thrown punch to said pointy git’s face.
Harry spluttered, offended. “I’m
And he was alive. So alive. Potter’s lips chased all the numbness away, and his heart beat a pulsing rhythm he had never felt before. He had been wandering lost and blind all his life until he found the universe between the slow, uncertain movements of their lips. And it was glorious, and beautiful, and warm, and bright. And he had been waiting so long for this, begging on desperate, aching knees for one drop of water in a lonely drought.
how he wanted to know everything. And maybe this time, the real Harry would let him.
Like the thrill of liquor into absolute bliss and oblivion, as he sunk further, the edges of his mind blurred. His eyes became a liquid whirlpool.
Both teams were running in circles, no one had scored another goal for a while, but that’s how it always was between
“I don’t know, when I asked for his name, he told me to call him Noble, so I do.”
Potter hauled himself on top of the desk, his legs dangled to the floor. He ran his hands across the wood grains and drummed his fingers to a silent rhythm; a habit Draco had given him.
will say that you don’t have the balls to get the media off your back.”
Harry shook his head as he stared at the ceiling, tracing the dark green mould that was growing between the cracks. He took a deep breath and ran a shaking hand through the lengths of his hair, damp with tap water and sweat.
Because he did, indeed, face a few problems head on. It was just done very quickly. Eyes shut tight, mind eerily blank, palm slipping against the cold tiles of his shower. And when he watched his shame wash down the drain in mocking patterns, he fought that lick of pleasure, the thrill that overcame his body in the slow blurry moments of his afterglow.
From the corner of his eye he saw a flash, a swirl of movement. Malfoy turned a sharp corner and began to climb the sky. Harry was hot on his trail, fire versus ice. With every exhale of breath, his broom closed the distance. His chest flat to the wood, his fingers were red and blistered from how tight he gripped the handle.
Perhaps I already fell in love with his taste; bittersweet molasses of sin.
His voice was a slow croon that filled Draco’s body like the silvery light of the moon. The world around him was eerily still, but with Potter’s words, he felt an avalanche crumble over him.
Malfoy released a breath, a low, stuttering gasp. His eyes shot open, and he looked as though he wanted nothing more than to hold his breath captive again.
“It’s none of their business if I sometimes fuck blokes on the weekend.”
Insanity was also a pageant for the criminally sane. Eyes upon your every step as they watched your fall from grace like it was their only entertainment, applauding after the final knell. That eagerness to witness it all over again because once you taste the bittersweetness of the wicked, you cannot come back from it. The morally righteous were not much better than the morally corrupt, in that way. War did that to a person, turned the good insane and the bad more deranged.
came crashing over him as if years had not passed since they last saw each other. As if all those years ago when their bodies had intertwined, their fingerprints painting each other’s skin gold, hadn’t at all been a phantom.
The sun caved under, then, falling behind a dark, thick layer of cloud. The first shocks came, one streak of lightning after another. Harry slid down to the floor, his back against his bed as rain pummeled heavily against the window in front of him.
He shook his head. “You being here all year is a false hope. There’s nothing hopeful about saying a pretty version of goodbye.”
Malfoy glanced at him, an eyebrow raised in a familiar question that hadn’t escaped Harry’s mind since this whole game started.
Harry swallowed as he watched Malfoy’s eyes pour over him. Greedily. Drinking every inch of him up as if this was the last thing his eyes would ever see.
“You’re ashamed,” Draco said.
you mean to happen?”
“Serves you right, bastard,” Draco said around a growing smirk.
Wind. Ozone. Sweat. And the sweet smell of Malfoy’s cologne.
Harry always thought the victory tasted so much sweeter when it was a fight to get it. A battle of wills. Cat and mouse. A game he refused to back down from. A game he refused to lose.
“You can’t say things like that when it’s untrue.” Malfoy's voice was soft, syllables slurred around a gasp. It was so unguarded, so vulnerable, and so un-Malfoy-like that it startled Harry. Maybe that was the point; maybe the man lying naked on top of his bed sheets—legs intertwining, hands roaming, sensations blooming was not Malfoy at all.
“Are you dead yet, Potter? Why waste your life saving the decrepit?”
“Even if it’s only temporary?”
“Potter—” Deverill massaged the sides of his temples, and Harry couldn’t even find it within himself to feel sorry for him if he, too, was believing the
Drunk from the warmth. Drunk from the touch. Drunk from Potter.
Apolline pursed her lips. “I asked you to strip. You understand the concept, correct?” And this time, she spoke very slowly as if Harry was the one with the thick foreign accent all along.
Harry clenched his fist, nails biting the soft skin of his palm. He was a tether away from walking out of this shoddy place indefinitely.
for starters—” he counted off on his fingers, “—and two, I won’t have to see your ugly mug taking over the sports section every damn day. It's a win-win for all.”
Harry bit Draco’s bottom lip and ran his tongue over it, humming into the sweet noises Draco made. “I know what I want. And I really,
“I’m sorry you have to go through this.”
To fight with or to fight against?
He was lying. Draco knew that, Potter knew that, but they both chose to ignore it.
Harry held his hands at the bottom of his jumper, playing and pulling at a loose thread. He cleared his throat again, trying to look anywhere but at Malfoy, but the entire room was too white, too glossy, and he felt like he could see Malfoy’s reflection everywhere he turned. “Right. Sure,” he rasped, and even to his own ears, he sounded like he’d been a chain smoker for about forty-something years.
Perhaps this was the light at the end that muggles were so fond of talking about.
will say that a fit bloke wearing
Colours. So many colours.
robes will win today.”
Harry guided him backwards. Back and back and back. Until he felt a splattering of cold water run down his face, curl around the ends of his hair, and stick Malfoy’s Quidditch robes tight against his skin. He stared at Malfoy underneath the rain of the waterfall. He stared and he stared as Malfoy’s hair grew a darker shade of gold; it swirled up the platinum strands like an inkstain. Harry ran his fingers through the wet lengths, and he stared and he stared as Malfoy’s lips parted, his head tipped back under the weight of Harry’s hand.
Shoes crunching on grass tore him from his reverie. Draco whipped around and there he stood, green eyes, crooked smile, and the painful sting of a memory. Potter’s hands caved into the depths of his pockets, a thin t-shirt stretched along the width of his chest. Draco’s eyes were caught on the man before him, the edges of a black wing wrapped around the taut skin of his shoulder, disappearing into the expanse of cotton.
If his first fault was not realising the consequences of his actions, then his step towards betterment would be to develop his self-awareness skills. Now, he could have given himself a moment to identify the pros and cons about engaging with Malfoy. For instance:
but a lot more digestible than the horror he had expected to find.
Malfoy sighed; it ruffled the ends of both of their hair. “What could you possibly be sorry about? Wasn’t I the one who got us here?”
And so Harry turned around in a rush of drunken adrenaline and met a pair of warm, chapped lips. Whiskey and mint. He pulled the man closer by his neck, and it was messy, the tip of his nose dug into Harry’s glasses, but Harry bit and sucked at the man’s bottom lip as if he were enjoying it.
“Don’t,” Malfoy said, his voice hard.
Harry carefully placed the photo into his back pocket, and stared at the open envelope sitting on the bench, right next to the long string of twine that had been wrapped around the owl’s leg. He ran his fingers along the frayed length of it, grabbing the pair of broken Snitch wings still left in his pocket.
he had said.
Their brooms were side by side; if Harry just leaned over a little bit, their shoulders would touch.
Potter moved above him, his bare body caged him in, and his lips kissed a line down his throat, down his chest, across the ugly splattering of scars down his torso. He kissed all their childish mistakes as if the heat of his lips would wash it all away.
“Malfoy, I—”
With one final, heavy look, Harry went to push past Malfoy to the bathroom door, but a warm hand against his chest made him halt.
“Whatever you say, Malfoy.”
since the
“I’m fine.” But Malfoy didn’t really sound fine, and Harry swallowed, because he wasn’t sure whether it was Harry that was the problem, or whether it was the intermittent sounds of a camera clicking all around them.
But they didn’t, and he hadn’t, and so Draco wouldn’t ever know.
“The Quidditch Times,” Deverill barked, “the most famous Wizarding sport’s magazine since 1804, has dragged both
“I think the word you’re looking for is unbelievably charming. Or sexy. Sexy works too.” Harry wiggled his eyebrows as Draco rolled his eyes. One of Harry’s hands snaked its way around Draco’s hips.
“Relax,” Harry whispered, and exhaled a long breath for the both of them. With his other hand, Harry felt the bob of Malfoy’s throat as he swallowed. “Relax.” Malfoy’s teeth unclenched, and as Harry moved up his jaw, teasing the soft skin of his cheeks, he could feel the muscles in his face ease.
It was the only thing that mattered. Right here, right now, at this moment. The front of his broom knocked into Malfoy’s side, sending him off kilter, just enough for Harry to climb an inch higher, closer, ever so closer to his destination. He and Malfoy were shoulder to shoulder, side by side. He could feel the man’s heavy presence next to him, hear every one of Malfoy’s heaving breaths mix with his own.
He wrapped his fingers around the Snitch's wing at the same time he felt a vicious jolt erupt through his body. His core tightened, his stomach lurched, and his broom was knocked clean from right between his legs.
“Fuck off,” Harry laughed, “that’s not supposed to be the answer.”
drivel.
“I’m in love with a fucking idiot,” Draco mumbled, before his eyes snapped to Harry’s, a whirl of emotions flooding his face.
“Wasn’t last week’s headline enough for you?”
Vulnerable. Empty. Broken.
lonely?” he finally said.
There was no turning back from what he had done.
painted in a neat, flowing script.
Draco stepped back, the water spilled from the basin like a waterfall and pooled around his feet. He turned around, as if to be sure that his source of madness was not actually standing behind him. But as always, the water splashed in curling waves up his ankles—his only company.
Harry and Malfoy stared at each other, unmoving.
Harry stared at the crowds filling up the stadium, a booming rhythm in his chest.
They were so close. So unbearably close. Potter’s fringe fanned across Draco’s forehead and he could see every single mark, mole and freckle that splattered his face as if he were really there. Draco pressed into his warmth, their foreheads touched, and Potter’s lightning bolt scar—the one of goodness and everything Draco could never be—met the scars his eye couldn’t see.
“Surviving, Potter. There’s nothing more I can do.”
“You’re right, it’s not.” Harry held his palms to Draco’s cheeks, staring intently at his glinting, silver eyes, still large and round despite the turning of the clock. “It’s a new memory, starting right now. One we’ll continue to create together.”
“Hogwarts was a long time ago.”
was written in the same scrawl he recognised to be Apolline’s handwriting.
“Because Potter, don’t you get it? I don’t belong anywhere.” Malfoy’s face was scrunched as he ran shaking fingers through the lengths of his hair.
—but I wasn’t—and then you—” he stopped talking, swallowing down the words before they came. But he stared at Harry as if there was something in his eyes, trying to tell Harry what he meant when his words failed to.
Well, not quite
“Har—Potter,” Malfoy whispered.

“Charming.”
“What?”
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “What’s in it for you?” From his peripheral, he saw Skeeter’s secretary move in closer, Quick-Quotes Quill unsheathed and ready to strike. He knew with a sinking feeling in his gut that some twisted fabrication of this conversation would be retold for all of Wizarding Britain before sunrise tomorrow.
remained innocently unopened. If he left it there, he could pretend it never happened. Opening and reading it would only disturb the suspension of disbelief he wrapped around himself like a safety blanket. It would only make him remember things he didn’t want. But that didn’t change the fact that everyone else in the bloody country had read it. Harry really didn’t favour either option, but he was backed into a corner.
Still, Draco didn’t stop writing in his notebook, and sometimes, he’d spend the night writing instead of sleeping, because reminiscing fond memories of his childhood was much better than succumbing to the reality of his nightmares.
The owl came not long before lunch time, tapping its beak impatiently against Harry’s window while he was sitting down with a large cup of tea. As soon as Harry opened it, the owl came flying in and sat on top of his kitchen bench, an envelope tied neatly to its leg. Harry’s breathing quickened as he untied the long piece of twine from the owl and thumbed the white envelope between his fingers. A neat, swirling monogram was engraved in the bottom corner:
“And why not? I’m curious now, have you got something in mind?”
So, he left them there. Maybe—and now this was a genius idea—if he completely refused to move for the rest of the night, he would forget about the sticky being table altogether.
of the Wizarding World if they thought he was queer? I thought you could fix things, that’s all. I didn’t want to drag you down with me. I never expected us to shag.”
Their foreheads met, and Draco chased the taste of warmth as they breathed in the same air. “Look at it, Draco.”
Fingerprints painted Potter’s reflection like a Pollock. Splattered wet lines that trailed from the ridge of his eyebrows to the frame of his glasses, the point of his lips, and to the sharpness of his collarbone. Even now, the touch of another human was an illusion, broken by the very markings of his own fingerprints.
The dare of a challenge.
He wanted to fight. To punch Malfoy, break his nose. He wanted more than anything to lash out, to release the tension that coiled through his limbs like a spring. To soothe the growing magma in his belly, the one that bubbled and purled and wouldn’t simmer down until he had his hands pulling at the git’s stupidly styled hair.
Harry had to swallow away the urge to say,
“I did.”
Potter hummed, and the sound of his voice engulfed him. Draco shielded his eyes as if that would do anything to stop the image of Potter entering his mind. Such protection was futile when one became desperate enough to see the person they hate smiling in their very reflection.
“That is because you are stuck in a juncture. You cannot play on both sides of a war, Mr. Malfoy. That is how you sort the strong from the weak, you may be far from brave, but that does not make you weak.”
The Daily Prophet,
“Just close your eyes, Draco. Can you trust me?”
Harry tried to pull his body off the ground, but his muscles shook with the weight and he sent a curdling glare at the tosser who was already making good work on his hair with wandless cleaning charms. He cracked his back as he stood up on wobbly legs, rolling his shoulders to ease the pain.
Chittock’s segment on the wireless should have been the last straw before it got any more out of hand. If Hermione knew just how rash Harry’s thought process had been yesterday, she would’ve berated him for his carelessness, his lack of control. Ron, on the other hand, would’ve rolled his eyes and said something along the lines of:
He looked up to the windowsill where a rolled up
Nothing but Draco. “I think we’re long past the point of lying,” Harry whispered.

Draco moved a slow trail down his sternum, tracing his fingers along each black letter that curled around his ribs.
“Last Week was an Accident!” Harry blurted. “Besides,

Gold in the distance. A sparkle. A glimmer in the air. So small that if he blinked or lost focus for just a second, he would have missed it and forfeited his chance of winning.
over the situation. Don’t you want that?”
“Have you ever wondered what could’ve happened if things were different?” Potter asked one day as they sat side by side on top of Draco’s four-poster bed.
. He looked so damn good. Even if he scarred himself with the heavy marks of the dead.
Their team walked up to the centre of the pitch: Oliver in front, Harry at his shoulder. The stadium erupted, and Harry felt the rhythm of stomping feet and the clapping of hands shoot straight through to his heart, resuscitating him and alighting every fibre in his bones. An unbridled smile broke his face in two as he stared at the sea of navy blue and yellow. He lived for this very feeling. He was greedy for it. He wanted more.
Harry laughed, not in the least bit amused. “Over my dead fucking body. Do you know what you’re asking of me? I’m not selling myself for anyone’s benefit, least of all the media. As if it hasn’t been bad enough.”
Harry swallowed as a wave of heat bloomed against his cheeks, the skin at the nape of his neck suddenly sweaty.
But Harry was attending a Mindfulness program about
He met his home in the dead of night, when the wind was howling and the rain was a heavy plight. Pansy said it was running away. But Draco knew lots about running, so Pansy didn’t have much of a say. This was a fresh start, a new him. A place where no one knew his face, where he could carve another name into the blank canvas of his skin. Cover the scars and the mistakes of his past, because this is where his story would begin.
“I’m not yours to pity, don’t treat me like a fucking charity,” Malfoy spat.
“Fuck, Harry. You’re so—you’re so—”
“Shut up, Potter.”
and Draco didn’t know what more it would take for them to finally fall.
There was a thunderous clamour as Harry’s palms hit wood. The entire room held their breath as Harry stood up, his hands flat and heavy on the table as he tried to stabilise himself. The soft flesh of his palm stung and burned from the impact, and he clenched his fingers into fists to will it away.
“Did it?” Harry asked.
“I don’t know.” Draco ran his hand across the table, feeling the grains of wood underneath the pads of his fingers. “I suppose I wanted to hear another voice.”
The silence in the room turned deafening despite the muddled sounds of thumping bass and idle chatter. He could feel the eyes pouring over him, drinking him up like he had before. But he was too drunk to care, past the point of absolute bliss and oblivion. His gaze wandered towards Malfoy across the dance floor who stood frozen amongst the sea of people. He stared at Harry with an expression he could only assume was shock, and that served the bastard right, he’d have to try a hell of a lot harder to humiliate him. Harry laughed into the man’s lips, stuck his finger up at Malfoy, and fisted the collar of the man’s crinkled shirt, bringing their chests flush, the heat of their bodies overwhelming.
Harry swallowed, and flew closer. “I know.”
As if all the fundamentals were there, but the distinct air unique to Potter was missing. Draco could never recreate his fire, the passion that thrummed through his veins. The goodness inside of him that made Draco’s heart pump overdrive. But it was all he had left, so Draco ignored all the wrongness about the Potter in front of him.
He had under two months before his eighteenth birthday. And maybe, in the deepest chasm of his mind, he was terrified of that fact. Terrified of seeing his time run out like the slow trickle of blood on a bathroom floor. A broken hourglass, where all he had left to do was watch on in helplessness as the countdown ticked down to zero.
During the day, Hogwarts was a crumbling graveyard. The smell of death lingered heavily in the air. Draco wasn’t sure whether the other students were mourning Dumbledore, or the death that edged closer as the clock rang its toll at every stroke of midnight. No one but Draco knew the extent of the damage to come in the following months, but it was felt. As if Hogwarts itself was a living entity. A whispered plea in each creak of the floor. A cry in the stones as they walked head down through the halls.
But at least, back then, they were referring to him as ‘Horny Porker,’ which wasn’t
“What a load of shite, when yours is the definition of all that is right. Don’t you dare try and compare our past. We’re nothing alike.”
But then, Malfoy began to close the distance between them, one slow step at a time. Harry tried to keep his eyes trained on the glossy floor.
Harry only laughed, shrugging his shoulders as he carefully moved out from underneath Draco and held the Snitch in front of Draco’s face, his eyebrows raised. “I don’t know, you tell me.”
The bluebird sang into the early hours of the morning, when the sun was but a small bud in the distance. And in each other’s arms was where they stayed as the world began to bleed a collage of colours that transcended every shade.
with his slicked-back hair and self-important attitude, would never have batted an eyelid about prejudice. This image of Malfoy was different, it reminded him of the strange Draco Malfoy he saw crumbled on a dirty bathroom floor. Fingers running through the lengths of his perfectly styled hair.
Harry couldn’t help a giddy laugh escape his lips as he climbed
Hermione was seething, the smoke-coming-out-of-the-ears kind. Only figuratively of course—she was much too level-headed and wrapped up in the
He exhaled as he explored the feeling of Malfoy’s lips against his.
“What’s the key for?” Harry asked. “You’ve never said.”
A dim flicker caught his eye, a slow blink of light in the distance. A flutter. A whisper. A call.
“I know this might sound crazy, but I really think we could try… Make
He had a distant awe for the ocean; the sheer power it held in the very lengths of its fingertips. That power to give life to the desperate as they begged on aching knees for one drop of water in a drought. The sweet taste of renewal. In that context, it was nothing like fire who had no choice between destruction or healing. It was only ever raging or fervent or turbulent. Not calm. Serene.
“I’m not
“Well,” Harry said, “I’ve gotta finish this. I have a client in twenty minutes.”
Before he had stormed out of the

everything was so
“You say that as if you’ve always thought so.”
Perhaps that was why Harry stayed just that little bit longer, instead of walking out on the figure crumbled against the wall like he wanted to.
Harry’s hands began to move on their own accord, like muscle memory, even though he had never touched Malfoy this way before. But his hands traversed his body as if he knew every dip, every shape and goosebump. He thumbed the cold metal of Malfoy’s belt buckle. Ran his finger across the smooth leather. Dipped a nail into each of the belt holes.
Draco shut the book and placed it underneath his pillow; sleep came sooner than most nights.
Malfoy.
Malfoy took a step forward, and in the electric space that pulsed between them, Harry’s head pounded with the heavy smell of Malfoy’s cologne. It winded him, his heart a rapid pummel inside his chest. And when it all seemed too much—the thick ropes of tension that wound in the small space around them—Malfoy finally pulled the trigger.
“Your eyes, dimwit,” he said because if he didn't say it now, he would never have the chance to. Even if it was only fake Potter, with his fake eyes, and his fake smile, and his fake fingers touching Draco's real pulse.
“Enlighten me, then, on how this could possibly be good for your career?”
He craved to be normal, to not have that
and the next few moments slowed down like the blurry seconds between slumber and consciousness. He held out his shaking arm, soggy with sweat and dried blood and placed it on Potter’s shoulder.
And this time, it wasn’t a tease, a slip of skin between the lines of an iridescent shirt. No, it was an expanse of smoothness, a splattering of beauty spots that painted his skin like a night sky. It was the smallest whisper of gold hair trailing down his navel. Harry swallowed because it was all too much. Too much skin; too much Malfoy. It made him lightheaded, the desperation that curdled his body, urging the muscles in his limbs to
It was wrong and illicit, and everything he shouldn’t want, but standing here on the other side of the dance floor it was all Harry thought about. The long lines of Malfoy’s body, the way he painted the room. Fitted emerald suit that shimmered under the golden glow of the nightclub, pale skin and pink lips and pools of gunmetal grey that stared him down. A question written in the ocean of his eyes. And maybe, through the oblivion in Harry’s mind, there was a hint of desire there, too.
Harry cleared his throat. “A bit, erm, drafty.” He shut his eyes in utter horror and wished, not for the first time, that someone would bind his mouth closed so he wouldn’t say something as stupid as that ever again. Or if the white glossy floor with the Malfoy kaleidoscope could swallow him whole, that would be brilliant, too, thanks.
Harry felt every sharp pulse of his heart. Saw each lungful of air that escaped his body with every ragged breath. The smell of ozone and sweat, the electric aftermath of a thunderous storm. And blood. The metallic taste of blood on his lips as his teeth sunk into them.
Harry didn’t respond for a while, and the silence thrummed thickly between them, broken only by the soft flutters of their breaths. “Do you prefer it?” Harry murmured.
“You know, you really shouldn’t keep waiting up for me. You need sleep.”
He zeroed in, his eyes flicking around the length of the pitch and through the crowds, circling the air like a rabid animal on the prowl until he caught sight of what he was here for.
“What do you want, then, Harry?” Draco’s voice was lower, now, but Harry heard every word reverberate in his mind as if they were communicating through Legilimency.
Harry in so many ways, way more than what those gorgeous bottle-green eyes were offering him. And it wasn’t fair for Harry because he could never understand, nor would he need him just as much as Draco.
Draco whispered around Harry’s mouth. “I don’t think you realise what you’ve just done.”
He glanced at the Snitch again, just a flicker of his gaze, before flying straight towards Draco and  wrapping himself into his space. His smell. His warmth.
“I just did.”
The complete opposite of their last game.
“To pretend.” It was the first thing out of Malfoy’s mouth since they found themselves stuck in Deverill’s office. Harry’s gaze shot to Malfoy’s again. Malfoy swallowed; the muscles in his cheek jumped as he stared at a spot in the wall somewhere above their coach’s heads. When he spoke, his voice was devoid of emotion.
Unwittingly, his gaze flickered to Malfoy standing rigid next to Apolline. His cheeks were splattered red, but Harry didn’t think he had any right to be embarrassed about this situation, considering he had had no instructions from the slightly scary woman to strip in front of them.
He had to talk to Malfoy, to tell him he wasn’t interested in playing any more of his games. That whatever this had turned into needed to stop.
But Malfoy didn’t move so much as an inch as Harry fisted his t-shirt, preparing to draw it over his head. Harry stood frozen, the bottom of his top bunched above the waistband of his jeans. He felt a bite of cold air against the sliver of exposed skin on his abdomen, and he wasn’t entirely sure what he was waiting for, or what he was doing. Perhaps he was giving Malfoy time to move away, but as the seconds stretched longer, Malfoy stayed near. He stood too close, eyes locked, as Harry finally pulled his shirt over his head, scrunched the fabric into a ball, and chucked it somewhere in the distance. Malfoy’s throat bobbed up and down.
is that you could never get me out of your head.”
“That’s exactly right, Potter.”
When Draco was little, his mother gave him a small, leather notebook on his birthday, bound with yarn and threaded with a gold key.
Colours. So many colours. Why were there so many colours in such a dim fucking room?
“It’s not the same.”
Harry sat back down in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. “I hope I made myself clear.”
Yet this spring was much different from the ones he once remembered, because he felt a strange loss like yellowed, whittled leaves in September. Like grains of sand slipping through the palm of his hands, pale skin, blonde hair, and silver eyes made of flint never did come again.
Pooled around their feet, where Malfoy’s shirt had once lain, was a black and grey
“Is this how you repay me for saving your bloody worthless life.
“When we’re old and barmy and start losing our memory,” Draco began, a smile on his lips. “We can unthread the key from the yarn and let every memory we’ve ever written in this notebook flood out. We may not remember each moment or every second, but we’ll never forget all the feelings we shared together. That’s what the key is for, Harry.”
“Would that be such a bad thing?” Harry strummed his fingers along the short hairs at Draco’s nape, tilted his head, until Draco was left staring at the blood red eyes of his biggest mistake.
“Homophobic doesn’t quite suit the righteous Saviour.”
“Well, I disagree. I like it when you’re here with me.”
he snapped at the owl, dropping the letter onto the bench as he tried to shake off the pain. “What was that for?”
Harry scratched at his nape. “Yes, there was, erm, traffic.”
He looked around the studio, which had seemed a lot smaller from the outside. There were large compartments all over the room, separated by thin walls of plaster. Everything was white; from floor to ceiling the studio was washed in stark nothingness. There weren’t even any windows to break it up; everywhere he turned, Harry was trapped between the four blank walls. His steps echoed, heavy and booming, across the empty room, which was barren of any props or furniture except for some large Muggle lamps that stood in each corner. Menacingly casting the studio in a sickly fluorescent hue.
Harry gritted his teeth, desperately raking the air for a glimmer of gold. He climbed higher, trying to lose Malfoy to the wind, but the other man mirrored his every step, flying parallel to him.
“You may call me Apolline. I take my art very seriously. If you come across a problem, or if you need to stop, you tell me. Understood?”
“I never had the chance to understand my feelings, Draco.” He licked his lips, unsure of how to properly respond. “I went through most of my life
“We are pretending, Malfoy.”
“It’s got nothing to do with that.” Harry drummed his fingers along the side of the chair. “Tell me, why are you still here?”
Draco splashed his face. Scalding rivulets poured down his neck and cascaded down his cheeks, leaving behind red smoking trails in their midst. The heat did nothing to soothe the tight knots in his muscles, but at least it made him feel something besides the numbness. An itching reminder that he was still alive.
Harry’s fingers stopped their slow journey through Draco’s hair; his hand rested at the nape of his neck.
“You’re ashamed,” Malfoy repeated, and this time, his voice was choked as he sat back up against the headboard, his gaze piercing in the distance.
An explosion of navy and blue robes amongst the black clouds. A dying star awaiting collision.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“I already said I agreed to your rules. No snogging, no unnecessary groping—unless under extreme circumstances—and no alcohol.”
As if the words he spoke weren't actually coming out of his mouth at all, but somewhere else. “Of me. Of your own feelings. Of how people see you...”
“It’s not that you’re bent, Potter. It’s the fact that you’re bent over
He gives me a smirk and nothing more, taking another drag of the cigarette. The lights all around us paint the swirl of smoke purple, and it draws from the tip of his lips like poison. I want it, and Malfoy knows. Of course he knows.
Harry leaned across the table, a dark chuckle slipping out of his mouth as he continued speaking. “And what of it, Deverill?” he all but whispered. “What if me and Malfoy
“Oh. Right. Uh...vertigo.”
Malfoy stood in the throes of bodies. They thrummed and pulsed against him as if they couldn’t get enough heat, as if they craved more. He moved like water, sinuous and silky in every caress, every look, every crash of the tide.
your questions before I take my leave.” His lips turned up into a strained smile. “Do we have a problem with that?”
If we do. We’ve never fallen that low, but perhaps Malfoy is the mistake I've been missing.
Gold and green. Blue sky and white skin, and threads of shimmering silver. A prism of light that coalesced and intertwined between the heat of their bodies.
The only space left between them was in the shape of their lips, and Draco wanted so desperately to connect them, to see exactly how the puzzle would fit, how their opposing worlds could collide into one.
and the
“Fuck off, Potter,” Malfoy said, but there was no venom left in his voice. Harry could feel the hammering of Malfoy’s heart beneath his fingers, and perhaps that said everything his words couldn’t.
“You have no right to speculate and intrude on my personal life like I’m not a human being. What I do, who I am, and what I like is
In the whirring of his mind, Harry couldn’t find the words to say to Malfoy, so he didn’t.
Harry wrapped the twine around the ends of the two wings, tying a knot. They dangled from it, fluttering and curling into each other. Harry circled the string around his neck and knotted it at his nape.
“You smell good,” Malfoy mumbled against his lips.
“I thought I’d never see you again,” Potter whispered, voice hoarse.
September came, and October followed, and Draco was not top of the class in Arithmancy, and he’d lost to Gryffindor once more, and he misplaced his advanced Potions textbook at some point during the year.
He didn’t look at Malfoy.
He sighed a heavy gust of air and watched as it rustled the tips of Potter’s hair. A forbearing breeze against a faraway bloom. “You don’t have to say it like that, you know,” he said because this time, he didn’t have the will to ask him
into the overflowing bin with a sharp shake of his head. Pages of old, torn up newspapers littered the floor of his office; he flicked his wand and vanished them all away. Deverill leaned back in his chair, then, and dusty brown eyes regarded Harry silently.
“So then why are you…”
It didn’t. But maybe they could continue to pretend that none of it mattered. That they weren’t in a war, that this wasn’t a goodbye. And maybe someday they would believe it, too.
“That does beg the question,” another reporter cut in, “of whether
“Of course.” He smirked. “Just like the traffic on the Motorway.”

teams because it’s not worth their effort anymore.”
for Christ’s sake, and since day one he had been a slippery, slimy, slithery snake. But it was too late to back down now, so Harry crossed his arms and raised his eyebrow as if his stomach wasn’t churning and his palms weren’t sweating.
So instead he asked, “Are you dead yet, Potter?”
His heart stuttered in its pulsing rhythm, trying to keep up with the rough inhales of air he did not yet have. Blood and adrenaline shot through him, alighting every nerve ending like the thrill of liquored lips, and he basked in it, eyes shut as his senses fueled on overdrive. Ozone and sweat. The hot pellets of rain against his skin. Hard blades of grass and mud underneath his back. The deafening crowd all around him. The soft—almost comforting—sensation of the Snitch’s feathers between his calloused hands.
“What a surprise, Golden Boy, it’s Heads.” He took another step forward, thumbing the Galleon between his fingers.
In slow, curling strokes, Harry began to paint a world of colour over him.
fucking like you, Draco.”
I take the bud of the cigarette out of his mouth, breathe one last drag before vanishing it with a wordless spell. Time still burns, ashes curl through the air, but there’s nothing left between us except impulse and truth. They’re one and the same, both dangerous while overdosed with heavy desire.
He blinked, and the world tumbled into view through the slit of his eyes. Malfoy’s hair, soggy with dirt, sweat, and rainfall, itched his chin, and the dead weight of his body constricted his chest, stuttered his breathing. Harry clenched his fingers, and even that movement sent a searing spike of pain through his ligaments. He groaned, and drove his knee right into Malfoy’s side, shoving him off his body.
Harry didn’t think he could ever have enough of this. After falling so deep within the pool of Draco’s arms, he never wanted to find air again. His head held underwater, the smell of sea salt and sweat. Maybe it was drizzling again, or maybe his body had turned to liquid under Draco’s palms, but Harry couldn’t care enough to open his eyes and check.
The touch, the smell, the taste. And Draco’s body would thrum with a desperate need that wouldn’t ebb until the early morning sunlight. Sometimes, he’d spend the night staring in the mirror and imagined a glimpse; a shadow of dark hair and a lopsided grin. But when his fingers touched cold condensation, it would wash away with the fog.
Harry and Draco.
“Well, aren’t
Something crossed Malfoy’s face, then, something like realisation. A crashing, burning realisation. The moment ended as he moved away, leaving Harry to chase after him—mouth parted, waiting for their lips to meet again. But Malfoy held his hand against Harry’s cheek, stopping him from moving any closer. Harry swallowed, licked his lips, and caught gunmetal grey eyes.
Harry refused to concede; his eyes were only on the prize.
but her next words made him choke on his own spit.
Draco wrote down another memory in the book that evening.
“Out of my way, Malfoy,” Harry yelled over the roaring of the wind. The drum of the crowd pulsed a steady rhythm around them: stomping feet and clapping hands. The audience sang a cacophony of words, a tune that rang in his ears as he saw another flicker of the Golden Snitch just up ahead, Malfoy still in front of him.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed something dark and terrifying. He leaned down, closer, lips tracing Harry’s earlobe. “Do my proclivities offend you?” he whispered.
Harry took off his gloves, wiped his sweaty hands along the tear of his jeans, and met Malfoy half way. “What are you doing here? I never expected someone like you to be a runaway.”
The halls of Hogwarts sang a sombre ballade as he wandered through the darkened corridors. The stairs creaked underneath his feet, and he ran his hands along the dusty balustrades, walking with a fleeting purpose but no destination in mind. It always seemed to be like this, in the blackest of nights, with an array of ashy stars strewn above him—too far out of reach, but close enough to dream. Draco would sneak out of the dungeons, the soothing sounds of the Black Lake faded away from him as he found himself stepping into the silence of the Great Hall.
Harry closed his eyes, toes curling as his head bent towards the heat of Draco’s mouth. The kisses left him dizzy, made his breath stutter. He gasped, “I don’t want them to release the pictures from our photoshoot.”
Pleading. No matter what Malfoy wanted, Harry knew that he was going to say yes, just so he could see the expression on Malfoy’s face relax again. Soothed by the sweet touch of lips.
“Don’t you think I’ve tried?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Go on, then. It’s your turn to reveal something.”
Draco looked up at Potter, a question written in the steel colour of his eyes. His skin was hard and rough—he had the marks of a worker’s hand. Draco fought against the intense desire to enclose his fingers around them.
Horny Porker)
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
On the other side of the Great Hall, a small world away, a singular floating candle lit up the sky above it. A fragile golden glow that fought against the consuming darkness. A beacon and a promise after one’s dying wish.
His coach flicked his wand, and the newspapers opened to different pages. Every article that had been published about them since the Quidditch game in July was unveiled before Harry’s eyes.
Harry swallowed as the image brightened and he saw the shape of a black and grey
“I’m telling you.”
“Alright, Potter?”
Blood gushed from his body like the sand from a broken hourglass, and even though he had just over six months left before he turned eighteen, he didn’t have the will nor the strength to do much more than hold a shaking hand over his bleeding ribs. Waves of darkness began to drown his body, it edged its way up his neck and pulled him underwater. It held him down by the shoulders as he fought for fresh air, and this was it, he thought. He had turned the final corner. And just when he was about to close his eyes and surrender into its depths, Potter walked through the door.
He felt a wave of heat brush his cheeks as Malfoy breathed a laugh, and in that moment, Harry decided that he’d much rather have frozen nipples than to feel the warmth of Malfoy’s breath flutter against his skin.
“Then show me, Draco. Touch me like you mean it. You have me now.” Harry grabbed Draco’s hands, clasping them together as he guided them on a leisurely journey across Harry's body. Down the shapes of his abdomen, curling around each pull of his shifting muscles. Nails biting into hips, crescent moons finding home in his skin.
“A photoshoot, Potter. Do keep up.” They stood barely a whisper apart, and every time Harry breathed, he could feel their sides brush up against each other. Fire and ice.
“There’s one more rule you forgot to mention,” Malfoy begins. He pulls back, takes a sip of his Butterbeer, and this feels eerily like the end. I welcome it with open arms, ready and willing to bend to Malfoy’s every word no matter the comedown. “Don’t fucking fall in love.”
His eyes shut. The colours faded. The lights waned. The smiles melted. He took one heavy swig in complete darkness, and when he opened his eyes again, he slipped into a rapid descent of senses.
“Draco.” He clasped their hands together. “And I think, perhaps, we’ve been waiting for this moment for a terribly long time.”
Harry said, but it sounded a bit like a question because he couldn’t quite remember what Malfoy had asked him. So, he thought the safest and smartest option was ‘yes’.
He turned around to see familiar bottle-green eyes, ablaze with an emotion time had rendered foreign to him. But he had a mess of black hair that looked no different than when they were children.
With every hum, with every drop of ink, he was coming undone.
In these heady moments, he couldn’t help but remember just how much he loved to forget. That delicious delirium would surely become the death of him.
“Because he’s lonely. And no one deserves to be consumed by loneliness.”
sinker.
too.”
Harry brushed his fingers through Draco’s hair, pushing silky strands away from his eyes. Draco’s body melted underneath the heat of Harry’s touch, and then they were moving, slowly collapsing on top of the cotton sheets of his bed. Draco’s head lay on Harry’s pillow, their legs slotted between each other.
“You’re a fucking idiot, Malfoy, you know that? Were you

Harry swallowed. Licked his lips. His heart was a rapid drum.
he says. As if that matters. We’ve been on the precipice of slipping for years, a slow-growing waiting game. Falling is inevitable.
“I’m sorry. I really am.”
It was cold tiles and wet skin all over again. Except this time it was so much better because it was happening right before his eyes. Unfolding, unravelling with every touch. Harry wanted and he craved so desperately. In the light of day, his mind was foggy—not with alcohol, but with Malfoy.
As Malfoy walked out, the sound of the door ricocheted through the shop like a death knell.
Alicia would redirect, hurling it over her shoulder with a practiced accuracy. Lisa or Davies would catch it and make the final mark, sending the Quaffle in the hoop between Flint’s legs.
The owl bent its head to the parchment lying on the bench, and its beak tapped impatiently—much like it did on the window—to the neat monogram written at the end of the letter, exactly like the one on the front of the envelope.
“Our feelings are like memories,” she had said. “As time passes they become more hazy—blurred around the edges. Until one day we wake up and realise that we have forgotten what it means to be alive. Instead, we become familiar with living in the numbness, because our childish joy and wonder has withered with the weather, aged with the lines and wrinkles carved on our face. You see, Draco, it is not wise to treat your life as something as fleeting as a memory. A Pensieve can paint a beautiful picture, after all, but that is meaningless if we have lost the true feelings of being alive.”
Clarity was an intangible thing, but Harry clutched the Snitch’s wings between his hands, and it felt like a fluttering bud of warmth.
He chucked the notebook at the bottom of his trunk, and as the rest of the year wafted by with the slow-growing change of the seasons; yellowed, whittled leaves turning to plush, fragile snow beneath his feet—Draco forgot the notebook was even there.
But Malfoy was a stranger, a foreign anomaly. Harry didn't know how or why, or what it was that made him suddenly come to this.
“Are you right with your t-shirt, Potter, or do you need help with that, too?” Malfoy murmured as he handed Harry his glasses.
It was then, resting on the perch of his windowsill, the little bluebird began to sing that same old, familiar trill.
He wasn’t. And he didn’t ever plan on doing it either. Aunt Marge’s lace pantyhose, and all that.
and he’d go to practice and joke with his mates like nothing at all was amiss.
And Draco tethered to it because it was all he had left.
“Now, tell me, Deverill, ‘cause I think I’ve missed something here,” he began, trying to steady his breathing and
To touch. To feel. To grab onto Malfoy’s hands, push them away and continue the journey downwards, unbuttoning his shirt until his fingers traced the band of his pants, slipped
The machine danced along Potter’s arm, drumming a soft rhythm. He hummed, and Draco turned to listen.
he’d say.
Slowly, Harry ran his thumb underneath the seal, and pulled out a piece of parchment paper. The crinkling sound as he unfolded the letter echoed loudly in his ears.
Colours. So many colours. Why were there so many colours in such a dim fucking room?
Merlin, Harry needed this win more than anything.
Potter chuckled; it was a nice sound. Draco wanted to make him do that again before he realised that he didn’t actually know what Potter sounded like when he laughed. Draco bit down on his lip; the prospect of change was too little too late. Years of animosity cultivated by an ill-fated handshake did that to a person.
Draco stopped. Frozen. While the world whirled around him; the same sounds, same faces, same everything. Except something deep and dormant within his body rippled, and pulled and swirled—alive with the memories.
Here, wrapped in the lonely depths of Carnation Grove, was exactly where Draco belonged. Hidden by the riverside, where the black ink of a dying sky bloomed into the brightest of summer days.
“Why do you do it?”
Green grass. Gold metal. Green grass. Gold metal.
The leaves lay around them on the grass like a bed, and Harry brushed a hand against Draco’s chest. Draco fell backwards, wrapped in the covers of flower petals that fluttered in the breeze. His hair splayed around him in a halo of gold. With the sharp lines of his face and the contour of his nose, he looked as though he was carved out of stone.
...the tip of his nose...the apples of his cheeks...
Temptations Nightclub—
Potter crashed to his knees, his hands hovered over Draco’s ribs. He was completely drenched, soaked head to toe as if he too, had been drowning with no chance of escape. “I—what happened to you?” Water cascaded down his body and fell to the floor in a soothing pitter-patter. Draco tried to match his erratic heartbeat to the sound.
“Just put your bloody kit on, and try and keep your hand outta your pants while you do it.”
“It’s not you,” Draco whispered, “It’s not you.”
“You better hope
When he flew, everything else washed away until all that mattered was the feeling of wind whipping through his hair and the blisters on his fingers as he gripped his Firebolt.
Harry whipped around, coming face to face with the last person he wanted to see.
And in the morning when Draco opened the notebook again, nothing at all had changed. His words were still there, same as when he had written it—neat, long strokes. Ink crisp and sharp. No magic, nothing at all.
appropriate time to visit on a Sunday.’
“Draco.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Poor choice of words, ‘Mione.”
“C’mere.”
losing?” Draco drawled.
This meant much more than a single victory, more than just winning a game of Quidditch, because for the first time since Harry was born, he’d finally have his life to himself. He’d be free to make mistakes, to live, to learn, to be young. To get drunk on a Saturday night while not worrying about his picture being flashed on the front cover of the
From his peripheral, he saw Potter smile as he stared down at their hands, at Draco drawing spirals across his skin. “Well then, what is a good look on me?”
The world slowly faded into focus like a long summer day that stretched into a longer winter night. Blurs of colour swirled his vision; chocolate brown, midnight blue, and a gold that pulsed and shivered before his eyes. He blinked through the colours, and the room became too dark and too bright all at once.
in her eye. The ‘I told you so’ glare, without her even having to utter the words. She had warned him, and he didn’t listen. Harry put his head in his hands and let out a long string of expletives that did nothing to make him feel better. He realised, with a pitiful, sinking feeling, that there was no turning back from this.
“Of what?”
Two months.
He had missed this back and forth with Draco, that fiery spark that darkened his eyes and sent Harry’s body on overdrive. Harry met him halfway, licking his lips, hungry to taste Draco all over again.
Malfoy lay under him on Harry’s unmade bed, his fingers carding through Harry’s hair, pulling him even closer still. The rest of their clothes were strewn in a trail up the stairs. Now, it was just them. Entirely uninhibited, long stretches of naked skin glowing under the soft light streaming in from the outside. The sun curled patterns around them, following the trail of Harry’s hands as it moved across Malfoy’s thighs, teasing warmth from the pads of his fingertips. Dust motes floated in the air as they haloed around Malfoy’s mussed up blonde strands. He looked ethereal laid out like this—untouchable. But here Harry was, blurring the lines of reality, touching the untouchable.
and the
Draco. Draco. Draco. His smell, his taste, the way his body moved against Harry's, slow and relaxed, silky smooth. His voice, a pool of velvet that sunk into the very fibre of Harry's being, filling him up with molten heat until he was all Draco’s.
Sometimes he’d wander alone at the stroke of midnight, when the wind scraped and stung at his nape. But he didn’t mind so much, even if his jacket was too thin or the grass was soggy beneath his feet, because this was home, and home called out to him.
stare.
“Relax.”
were the only ones who didn’t seem to care.”
And with his every deliberate movement, Malfoy spun a tale, too. A dangerous web of lies that entangled Harry into its grip.
That’s when he saw them, pools of gunmetal grey. Dark and overwhelming, and so full of restraint. But Harry refused to back down, and so he leaned further in, close enough to trace the cracks on his lips.
He gurgled around the words, “I’m perfectly fine,” but Apolline was not having any of it.
“Don’t leave,” he said, and Draco couldn’t help the stinging laugh at the irony of it all. “I just want you to know that I’m so
Draco nodded his head as if he understood any of that. As if the white noise rushing in his ears wasn’t screaming over the same sounds and the same faces in the street.
His new flat was the last building on the street. Third floor, above a small bookshop run by a lonely widow who lived in the flat right below his feet. He had to walk up a flight of stairs to get to his door, and when he finally managed to lodge the key into his lock, he stepped into the dim. The door shut closed; a solid, final sound that jolted him. There was a mismatch of emotions that carded through his bones. Of longing and mourning, a childlike giddiness, and a heavy weight that settled like the looming fate of the unknown.
Sixth year had carved a permanent scar in Draco, his round, glinting eyes sunken in his head. Lips bitten raw, the skin around his face sucked dry and sallow.
Potter.”
“There was never a Tails to begin with, was there Draco?”
The entire stadium instantly faded behind him. All that was left was Harry and Draco. Nothing else mattered; today, at this moment, the game was the last thing on Harry’s mind. This budding thing between them was worth so much more than winning or losing.
stands. Like déjà vu, Harry outstretched his arm as far as his muscles could pull, and Draco did the same alongside him.
he finished in a sigh, as if that made any sense at all.
“I don’t want another tattoo, Harry.”
“Stop,” Malfoy said, barely above a whisper. “I never meant—” Malfoy looked down at his palm still flat against Harry’s chest. He curled his fingers ever so slightly, the material of Harry’s jumper bunching between his fist before he let go and placed his hand by his side, as if he was giving Harry the chance to leave if he wanted to. “I never meant for things to turn out like this. With the press and that
“You alright, Potter?” he whispered, and there was something in his eyes which told Harry that this wasn’t one of Malfoy’s taunts. At this moment, they were so far removed from the game of cat and mouse they’d been playing for years. It was different, so different. It was new ground they’d never explored before, and the weight of it was stifling and exciting all at the same time.
her ears) and filling his entire kitchen, making his eyes burn and his head spin. He squinted at her through one eye because he hadn’t even had time to find his glasses before Hermione had barged into his house uninvited and at the arse-crack of dawn. Apparently, it was ‘only eight-thirty-two, and therefore a
Potter’s shoulder brushed against his, and this time, they stayed that way.
Draco huffed in annoyance, wrapped his fingers tightly around his hawthorn wand, and muttered the new Charm Flitwick had taught them. He watched on with a certain sort of pleasure as the ink sank into the fibres of the parchment. Disappearing.
Potter slipped down the bed, lying sideways on his elbow. The mess of his hair tickled his collarbone and Draco exercised his strength of will and restraint. Potter looked up at him, then, a teasing grin on his face, and Draco had to look away because he was never that strong in the first place.
“Huh?”
Craving the taste of blood red wine on the tip of forbidden lips. The sound of Malfoy’s voice whispering in his ear, the tease of it all. Their bodies close, but not close enough.
Nothing but Draco.
A steady drizzle bathed the sky outside in a greying hue as streaks of pale sunlight peeked through the thick layers of cloud, curving in a faint rainbow of colour that danced along the hard wood floor of Harry’s bedroom.
It was the kind of article that would give Hermione that
“Give them something to really talk about. Something so shocking that you getting drunk with your lackeys at the pub won’t be interesting anymore.”
“I didn’t even know you were properly into blokes, Potter. Not really. I mean I ho—
Harry raised his eyes to the ceiling, glaring, as the back of his head bounced off the plastic of the too hard chair. “This’s got nothing to do with me having control over the rumours. You just wanna get
Harry glanced up at Draco for a split second, humming as he sent him a wink, and climbed higher up the nose of the broom. Draco’s arm was still stretched towards the Snitch, but his eyes were focused solely on Harry’s chest to where the two halves of the broken snitch fluttered and curled into each other.
Suddenly, the legs wrapped around Harry’s hips tightened, yanking sideways, and before Harry could do anything, he felt his entire world tilt on its axis. The broom leveled out, halting their rapid descent, but the sharp jolting sent them hanging upside-down, both of them holding on with only the sheer strength of their thigh muscles. Once again, they were nose-to-nose, but the moment didn’t last long, because as Harry stared into Draco’s eyes, Draco
And so Harry pulled the blonde man with no name closer. Chased a pair of lips that were too large, traced a smirk that was too sweet and unfamiliar. His eyes never left Malfoy’s, and Malfoy’s never left his. And perhaps that was why he could almost hear in the back of his mind the slow drawl of Malfoy’s voice whispering
“Well I’m sure you’re not faring much better wherever you are in the world.”
For instance, two months wasn’t enough time to tell Potter how he felt. That pain in his chest each time their eyes would meet, the numbness that surged through his body like the swell of a thunderous ocean. How every time their skin touched, he would float off the ground amongst the sea of stars, painting the sky gold.
Draco placed his palm over the beating rhythm of Harry’s heart, and as each finger brushed a path along the owl’s feathers, a coil of something hot and electric coursed through his veins. A memory that tethered Draco to Harry, as if each stroke of ink was a Pensieve blooming against his skin, waiting for the moment Draco caressed them, falling into its depths.
Lemon and wood; the scent Harry couldn’t get enough of.
“And just what makes you so sure I’m gay?” he said, as he took a step away from the basin and towards Malfoy. The gushing water from the old tap filled the silence of the room; the pipes made an ominous groan.
Harry took his foot off the pedal of his tattoo machine, sending the room into a stifling silence. “Malfoy,” he repeated after a long beat, his voice a clamour over the quiet.
“Felt like a bit of a swim, but it didn’t really work out, did it?”
were always getting into my head.”
stiff drinks.
In those silent moments, he would remember.
“So, we meet again, Mr. Malfoy. What brings you to me after all this time?” The Hat said to him.
Draco knew it was over the first time Potter said his final words. “I’m leaving.”
Harry didn’t shake his hand, instead, he pulled him closer, just enough to feel the whisper of lips against his, their hands intertwined in a shadow of the past. But they never did kiss, for they didn’t have time to, because Harry looked up, enraptured by the night. It was like the Great Hall, only so much better. They were silent as they stared at the dark expanse of sky. The sea of ashy stars that glittered over them like thousands of floating candles flickering and pulsing in an everglow.
misconstrued things.
And before he could properly mull it over in his mind, before he could convince himself otherwise, Harry closed the distance between their lips again, melding their bodies together. Then, the world collapsed over itself, the bright lights of the studio turned black, and they were spinning, spinning, spinning as they surrendered themselves to the beckoning will of Apparition.
“Why can't you just think straight about this? For once.”
I inhale his stare and breathe it back out, the slow drawl of smoke a tether between us.
Insanity was a pageant. A cruel show of lies in every crooked smile. A flicker of hate in bright, sparkling eyes. A call for help on deaf ears. Loneliness. Draco knew about insanity because it showed its face in every one of his memories.
He caved into the magic of his ink like a whirlpool of quicksand beneath his feet. As if it somehow knew, the bluebird on his windowsill began to sing its sweet tune.
“No. Don’t.” He shook his head, and his eyes flickered away. “Don’t ruin this. Just don’t.” And his voice sped up, as though if he were to speak any slower, the meaning behind his words would catch up to his mind. “Leave everything in the past, and let me pretend. Just this once, I want—I’ve been waiting so
and all those other reporters can fuck off with their homophobic bullshit, but you aren’t doing anything by locking your little gay self up in a dirty bathroom, are you?”
The rest of the world melted away as Harry leaned over the edge of his broom. He felt Draco shift closer, their noses aligned as they sat in the air, frozen while the seconds ticked by.
And then, the door opened and they were shoved out, the sound of it slamming shut behind them echoed with finality.
He sat with his back against the wall, the spray of water curling down his body, slicing his skin in hot pellets. “Fuck you, Malfoy,” he whispered, his voice a slow, drawl of bliss. In these moments of delirium, where the chains in his mind bent to the beckoning hand of pleasure, he couldn’t help but remember the memories.
list.”
Then, the Black Lake parted, split in two, and streaks of gold sunlight swirled through the ocean and flooded into the room, taking Potter and the whisper of his lips along with it. In his absence was nothing but dust motes and a memory, and Draco was stuck living through another day all alone.
When Draco spoke next, his voice was a raspy whisper. “Apolline’s sending an owl later today with a selection of photos you were supposed to choose from. You can send them back with a note telling her you changed your mind. She’s an old friend of mine, Pansy’s fiancée. She won’t ask any questions.”
He wanted this. Nothing but this.
As the rain drowned every other sound except the singing bird, he couldn’t help but return its croon with the tune he had heard. And so he drummed his feet against the cobblestone, humming in tandem with the night; until he found himself beyond the riverbend at a small shop; lonely and hidden from sight.
He began to lift the jumper over his head, but only made it about half way before the material got caught over the frame of his glasses, his elbows stuck up in the air at a painful angle. He wiggled. The jumper would not budge from his nose.
Harry exhaled to steady his breathing. He wasn’t a horny sixteen year old. He was an adult. What’s a bit of skin?
As Harry started to shuffle his feet in an attempt to change his position, he felt Malfoy’s lips by the shell of his ear. “Don’t be sorry, dickhead,” he breathed, as his hand snaked to Harry’s, which was still clenched tight around Malfoy’s side. He wrapped his fingers around Harry’s wrist and moved, guiding his palm from it’s frozen position against his side, over to his stomach, and up the path of his abdomen. Harry could feel every muscle under his palm contract against the heat of his touch. The hair trailing down Malfoy’s sternum stood on end as goosebumps followed the same journey their connected hands made.
Harry smiled lopsidedly. “What?”
“That’s the point, Hermione,” he said through a loud yawn.
swing your way, you wouldn’t even make the
“You know nothing about me.”
Malfoy stared blankly at the wall, while Apolline stood behind the camera with her arms crossed, one of her heels clicking against the floor. She tutted.
His breath was hot against Harry’s skin and lit a trail of goosebumps on a spiralling path down Harry’s spine. The soft strands of Malfoy’s hair brushed Harry’s cheek, and he couldn't help the irresistible urge to move into it, eyes closed, mind swimming in stuttering sensations.
“Who’s the first year Gryffindor you keep hurting yourself to save?” Potter asked, turning around to meet Draco's lingering gaze.
Draco hummed, a low, melodic sound that thrummed through Harry’s chest.
“Potter—” Malfoy began, in a low, soft murmur, his tone of voice so foreign to Harry he couldn’t help but snap his head to his gaze. “—if you truly had a problem with your sexuality then you wouldn’t have been all over those blokes at
“You like my eyes?” Potter whispered. It was so low that Draco felt the timbre of his voice wash over him like the pitter-patter of rain across a warm summer sky.
Deverill gave him a disapproving look, and Harry would be lying if he said he didn’t enjoy the rush in his veins that only came when Harry was this riled up. He was reeling from it, the memory of that very game with the
“Yes, until you do something stupid and land yourself an even bigger scandal.”
“I’d much rather look at you, though.”
Silence.
It was the spark of childish wonder he never wanted to forget.
that Harry could see each thread of silver paint patterns within his irises. They were hypnotising; Harry was on fire.
He flew above the rest of the players and gazed at the mechanical movements of his team, zig-zagging and swimming through the air as if this was also what they were meant to do. Bulstrode sent a blistering Bludger to Smith, who just missed it by a hair's breadth. Oliver was screaming something at Alicia from the goals. The predictability of it all was comforting, Harry could just about recount the game with his eyes closed.
Then Malfoy, in the strangest of movements, took a large step back. It was the furthest away from Harry he had been since he’d walked into this place, and Harry didn’t quite know how to feel about it. The change was somewhat startling. Left him wrong-footed. “I thought we were supposed to… you know.” He flailed his hand around in the growing space between them, trying to express the thoughts he refused to say out loud.
The next time Harry saw him, nights had blurred into days, and days stretched into the monotony of weeks. Malfoy walked in with a trail of dirt at his feet, and shivered with the bite of winter and a chatter of teeth.
Yet all Harry had ever known, trapped in the loneliest town of Carnation Grove, was that he wanted to hold Malfoy.
But Draco stayed still, for fear that if he reached out, even just a little, he would meet emptiness. The cold condensation across a mirror where his fingerprints painted a mirage out of nothing but stale air. And this time, if he trailed his fingers from the ridge of Potter’s eyebrows to the frame of his glasses, he would wash away in an instant.

Do learn to listen.”
Because that had to mean something, didn’t it? Draco keeping the wing as if it meant more to him than he let on. Something more than walking away without a backwards glance.
It was taking too long; he felt restless. He wanted to speed forward to the moment when he could bend low—feel the muscles tighten in his legs, a fiery pulse of power—before releasing the tension in his body and soaring into the sky. But his feet were still planted solidly on the ground, pointing him towards the

and he never had a problem with that before. Except for last week. But Last Week was an Accident, so it didn’t count.
Lights flashed in his eyes as bodies blurred together; moving silhouettes and burning skin. The musky smell of sweat and desire thickened the room and sent him spiralling. He hated it. He hated this. But he was barely two more drinks away from forgetting just how much it made his skin crawl, so he swallowed down the thrill of liquor into absolute bliss and oblivion.
“Then what
“Weren’t you the one going on about how

And Draco gasped a bitter laugh. “You are a mirror of everything I’m not.”
A pitter-patter echoed off the walls after each footfall like the soft drizzle of rain underneath the very soles of his shoes. Draco found it rather fitting, for the pool of loneliness flooded the entire length of the Great Hall. He made his way across the room and stood in front of the High Table, and right there, before his eyes was a wooden stool. A battered hat. A time of innocence long forgotten, of wonderment masked by arrogance. It was the beginning of a journey, a life he had no idea would come to a staggering halt by his final year.
The soft flowing curves of a flower petal bloomed between the cracks and scars on his arm. Between the remnants of his Dark Mark: a red carnation, fragile in its penned creation. The way it flourished against his skin was a soft breath of spring after a burning draught.
“This is worse than last week.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” and Potter smiled a lopsided grin that alit a fire through Draco’s body. A tumultuous glow of heat that rippled and curled inside of him like the waterfall of running water from the basin of the bathroom.
“I don’t recall that being a part of the deal, Potter,” Malfoy drawls, but his voice catches, stutters around my name.
With a sudden fire that flared deep within his chest, Harry yearned for Malfoy to see the same changed man Harry saw. But his eyes were flint as he glared out the window, staring unseeingly at his reflection as cicadas chirped brightly in the distance.
“Prove it.” Malfoy smirked. “Go on the dance floor, find a bloke, and give the
“They say loneliness can kill a person, but I don’t think that quite applies when you’ve done it to yourself.”
Time changed Harry, too; it pebbled along the stubble that paved a path around his lips. Peppered through the greying hair that veiled his temples. Time made space along the concrete of Harry’s skin, carving the shape of a gold ring on his left hand.
He ran his fingers along the expanse of pale skin; painting a mirage—cold ink against warm breath. Harry melted like dusk into the fluorescent glow of dawn, the sun held high in the sky as flowers bent their heads to cave under its warmth.
in a way the public haven’t... but it doesn’t—” Draco shrugged, his shoulders touching the ends of his tinted ears in an endearingly childish movement. “It’s you.”
Draco opened his eyes, tears cracking a path down the crevices on his cheeks. “I just wanted to live a normal life, Potter. That’s why I’m here. I thought that if I ran fast enough my past would disappear.”

with the adrenaline from the fall, and this was the outlet he craved with every chug of his Saturday-night drink.
“You don’t seem to know a lot of things, do you, Draco?” Harry’s hand reached up out of the covers, ghosting a touch against Draco’s side, right by his ribs.
She shot him a dark look that Molly would be proud of, and Harry raised his hands in surrender. It was indecently early in the morning to argue with a well-rested and fired up Hermione, and he was still nursing a horrendous hangover.
Malfoy nodded his head, a stiff movement, barely more than a slight jerk. He didn’t come any closer—he was standing at the very edge, looking so foreign in this wilted, little town. The depths of Carnation Grove was not a place a man like Malfoy should be found.
Apolline walked over to them, then, and Harry averted his gaze from Malfoy’s. She hummed as she properly eyed him up and down. He felt exposed, but not as stripped bare as he had from the intensity of Malfoy’s stare. “Tu n'es pas stupide, n'est-ce pas, Draco? Il est assez séduisant.”
felt his fingers meet the soft strands of Malfoy’s hair, right at his temple. He brushed his hand through it, and Malfoy...
“I don’t have a preference. I mean, it’s nice to see you like this—
“What the
“Perhaps,” Draco whispered, as he stared up at the ceiling. The fading moon was sheathed by thick clouds of fog, and the stars dwindled in their brightness. It was too dark to identify the constellations, and so Draco stared into nothingness—swirls of grey—just searching. Searching for something to anchor onto. In a crumbling world that swallowed him whole, he wanted nothing more than to find solid ground.
“I wouldn’t be getting my hopes up, if I were you,” Harry said, as he kicked a leg over his broom, knees low to the ground.
As he picked the sky apart for a hint of gold, he felt the fluttering of the Snitch’s wings from the twine wrapped around his neck. He thumbed the tips of them, a habit which had started since making the necklace. Something flashed in the distance, zapping before Harry’s eyes before disappearing into the thick of the clouds. Harry squinted as he moved closer, snaking behind its trail at a leisurely pace.  He wasn’t yet ready for the game to be over. There was still so much left unsaid between him and Draco, and he didn’t want to waste this opportunity. He had been thinking about this moment since he had first carded his fingers through the soft feathers of Draco’s wing.
“What is
Harry’s breathing stuttered and he fought as the air escaped his lungs, his head dizzy and reeling. “You could at least take me to dinner before trying to have your way with me,” Harry breathed, as he chucked the Snitch curled between his palm over Draco’s head, where it whirled away somewhere across the pitch.
