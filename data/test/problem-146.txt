. Which means, I won't let him have me anymore. I'm not that suicidal yet. Masochistic, obviously. But if I let him use me, I honestly think I might not survive it.
On two of those dates, Harry had gotten to take Draco home and knows now for sure that no one in the world can give better blowjobs than Draco Malfoy. He also knows that Draco is shy about sex and that his pale skin flushes when he's aroused. He knows that Draco likes to nip at Harry's bottom lip and that it turns him on when Harry leaves love bites on his skin.
We spend at least two hours with him teaching me how to sign, even though his own signing is still pretty rocky, as he puts it.
„It's not only you. It's me too. I just don't feel like -“ she erases the last part with a flick of her wand. „Things between us aren't working anymore. In any regard,“ she settles on.
„Harry, I'm in a leading position at the Department for Creatures. The moment I step out of this house and don't floo straight to the Ministry and report Malfoy, I am liable to prosecution. I would lose my job.“
I tell it to shut its stupid mouth. I've been fucked by the most disgusting men. It's ridiculous that I'm squirming now at the thought of you inside me. I've wanted that for so long. Dreamed about it.
That's when I see her. Way too far left – way too close to the dangerous current she should know is there.
I'm just grateful for the glamour I'm wearing. Hermione showed it to me. It's not really a change of my face, but more like a Confundus charm – people look at me and then look away, not really noticing I'm here at all.
He sounds unsure about it. My blood runs cold. I shake my head before I can even really think about it.
I break up with Ginny because she cheats on me. I think she cheats on me to make me break up with her.
„What are you doing here?“ you ask and that earns you a sneer. I wasn't aware I still know how to do that.
I'm not drunk though – butterbeer isn't all that strong – meaning I could easily apparate home. But my feet are carrying me down the street, past some drunk fools trying to spell smokey figures into the air, failing time and again.
I don't have the contract yet, but it's almost certain that I'll get a job at a tiny café in Knockturn. It's a little shabby, but the coffee and the cake is excellent and most of the people that eat there don't like public attention, either.
I leave only shortly after him to meet up with Hermione. She's asked me to have lunch with her for weeks now.
„You've been really great back there,“ Harry tells Malfoy as they head back to the office. Malfoy blinks at him, then shrugs.
it. It doesn't really matter where and how, if it's sexual or innoccent, he loves it all. I've never done this much petting and stroking and caressing in my life.
„Could we... maybe, just for now, don't register him? So he can decide that for himself when he gets older?“
I dash through the door, pulling out my Invisibilty Cloak and throw it over myself. I always have it with me, in case some fans are getting a little bit too touchy.
Part of me wants to say he can suck my dick, but I don't. If I did, it would seem like I was ashamed.
When they turn to leave, Harry looks at me. Something in his eyes tells me I'm not the only one feeling how weird this is, even though it shouldn't be.
I have to smile despite the topic. „I do like fucking blokes, yes. Women never really did it for me, you see.“
To Pansy's surprise, Draco stays with them, even though he's clearly shaken by Potter's outburst. Potter's unjustfied outburst, to be clear.
Never anywhere else. Draco learns quickly to not ever touch him below his waist. He does it once and Harry has a panic attack. Draco almost drowns in guilt. His heart is rabbit fast as he apologizes again and again.
Draco looks to the side and I notice that his lashes are dark at the root and blond at the tip. It's probably wrong to notice something like this right now, but that small detail seems to take over my whole mind.
When I step into the hut, Draco is sitting at Hagrid's table, hair messy and eyes sunken. The moment he sees me, he jumps to his feet.
Harry startles. He's always very concerned about the children they give away. „It's not going well?“
That makes me pause for a moment. „Yeah, I did. Because they'd have thrown him into Azkaban if I had said anything negative. I didn't want to be responsible for that.“
While Pansy takes off Draco's shoes, whispers something to him, pets his hair, I look around the room.
Draco looks at me without blinking. When he places one elegant hand on my heart, feeling it beating, I know I'd do anything for him. Anything at all.
„Sorry,“ Ron says, not shouting anymore. „I didn't mean to hurt you. But you have to understand what you're dealing with. Malfoy trusts you. At least more than anyone else aside Pansy. You can't abuse that. Do you really want him to think he has to let you fuck him so he can stay?“
When I leave the shower, I find a plushy towel and a set of fresh, too big clothes on the closed toilet lid.
He does as I say and his eagerness to please me makes me so hot that I almost tell him to forget it and just fuck me until I'm crying.
„No problem,“ I say. That is a lie. I was quite annoyed when she summoned me so early in the morning. It always complicates things and makes me wary. „Was there a particular reason?“ I ask politely.
I take one moment to collect myself, to ban Harry from my thoughts and focus on my work. My patient and the woman in front of me.
Harry isn't afraid. But he's embarrassed. Still, he says: „I don't like it when you come to work like this.“
It's like I'm frozen on the spot. Over the rush of the water, I hear something else. Draco is singing.
I don't know who Snape was to Draco. I remember their fight, the fight I eavesdropped. Draco enraged and scared and so fucking haughty.
They end up shagging on the floor, Harry riding Draco until the Slytherin let out a string of curses, loud in a way he never is in bed, bucked up and came so hard, his eyes were rolling back.
But I know I'm always overprotective over my youngest and Ginny keeps telling me I have to stop that, otherwise we'll raise a scared, spoiled brat.
I don't see Harry anymore. We never talked about it, but it was understood that we couldn't be friends. Not right now, at least.
„He didn't have much time to gather his bearings,“ Draco says, carefully looking around the large foyer. It reminds him a lot of Malfoy Manor, even though it's not as majestic or extensive.
I have a girlfriend. I've had a girlfriend all this time. Who the hell do I think I am, getting all... acting so pissed?
Only when they're in front of the bar, it becomes clear that Draco didn't really intend to go home. A warm feeling is unfurling in Harry's chest.
„You're distracted,“ Ron tells him. They're sharing a pint at Ron's favourite pub after picking out a birthday present for his girlfriend. The cashier assured Ron the golden necklace would go perfectly with Kalea's dark skin, but Ron had his doubts. „I'm just not sure she likes gold that much.“ In the end, he bought the necklace anyway, because he knows the cashier knows better.
I'm sitting at the kitchen table, sipping wine and watching Harry whip up roasted potatoes and salad and it's hard to tear my eyes away from him. I have watched him for a good twenty minutes, until I can bring myself to ask: „Could I borrow some parchment and your owl?“
We have to part to get out of our clothing and as soon as we're naked, Harry is turning over again. I want to ask him to look at me, to let me see his face, but I accept the way he wants it.
I cast a glance at Harry, wondering if this is a sensitive topic (my past usually is) and should rather be avoided, but he seems eager to hear more. „The Parkinsons were always the first family to arrive, because Pansy and I were best friends and Mrs. Parkinson and my mother bosom buddies for decades. Pansy and I would wear our prettiest clothes and spend the evening darting from one table to the other, eating lamb and goose with plum sauce and then stuffing ourselves with fruit covered in chocolate. Our parents would be busy and so no one could stop us calling for the elves three, four, five times, having them refill our plates with chocolate.“
Even under his annoyance, I can tell he means it. Of course he does. If we arrest Flint, he doesn't have to worry anymore.
I swallow, heart beating sickeningly fast. „Because I love you. And I'm sorry. And I'm here because I want you back.“
It's not the first time that I have to find the middle ground between protecting myself and acting in my patient's best interest, but right now, I believe this might become the hardest test yet.
Malfoy's eyes squint as he regards me. The height difference between us has shrunken as I've grown. He's not really taller than me anymore. An inch at most.
Draco doesn't understand and through the pleasant veil of alcohol intoxication, insecurity is rising in him again.
I'm interrupted by the sound of the door opening. We jump apart, trying to righten our clothes, dampen the blush on our cheeks.
“For sure. They'll believe me when I say I believed you. And I'll tell them that they were bloody wrong to let Julien off the hook.“
“Nothing is certain yet, but I would prepare myself for the possibility of her not waking up again at all,“ they say, not quite gently.
But he also doesn't feel depressed anymore. He gets out of bed, he usually eats and sleeps okay. Compared to the situation back then, that's heaven.
Harry meets my gaze openly. „I still care for her, yeah. I always will, I think. But I've never loved her the way I love you.“
He felt a flush creep up his cheek. „Well, not all of us are as terrible with fashion as you are“, he tried to save it.
Draco swallows thickly. For a moment, he's the same bratty, insecure little boy I remember from school. From Azkaban, even.
„Yes, I can. I told him it's not right to sleep with someone else's boyfriend, but he wouldn't listen.“
Draco glares at Harry. The Gryffindor really does drive him up the walls. „They are the worst, Potter. The
The way Serpent lingers for a moment gives me the impression that, maybe, I could have actually said no this time. Serpent is not a kind man by any means, but I don't think he is cruel just for the sake of it. What he wants is control and the way he usually gets it is through fear. He doesn't feel joy in hurting me, so he only does it when it benefits him.
Knowing I'm in danger of making a fool of myself, I sign, hesitantly: „But can't you sign in bed too?“
Obviously, I'm an utter moron. It's not like I wouldn't know that Potter actually doesn't seek attention all that much.
Harry doesn't understand what Draco wants. The Slytherin comes by at least twice, often three times a week. Sometimes he brings coffee.
But I can't. I have to stare at him first. His cheekbones look so sharp in the shadows. The tension in his shoulders makes his back as straight as a board. I want to touch his wrists. Feel the hum of the blood on the insides.
„And if it's true that you're actually looking for love, Derek,“ Draco starts, meeting the brunet's gaze evenly. „Then I suggest you take your time in Azkaban to really think about what you did and how you act. And then probably top it off with a few years of therapy before you can even think about trying to love someone the right way.“
The name sends shocks of pain down my spine. I say hello to Rose, then sit down on Hermione's huge, cozy sofa.
I allow my gaze to wander over his face. A rather pointy chin and a sharp jawline, paired with what has to be the cutest nose I've ever seen.
I'm sure I would have seen her by now or that he'd have mentioned her. But Draco is just so... handsome. I'm sure there is no lack of interested candidates.
The muggle returns and I'm pulled up to me knees, head hanging down. My heart is beating loudly. Strongly.
Before I know what's happening, he has pulled me in and kissed me on the mouth. Right there, in the middle of Paris, mouth tasting like chocolate and his chin sticky.
I swallow. My heart is pounding. I can see the necklace I gave Ginny for her twenty-first birthday on the desk in the hallway. She always takes it off for practice.
Hermione reaches out. Pulls him to her chest. She's soft and she smells like clean soap. She holds him so tightly that he can't get away.
She waits until I curl up, all energy gone. Then she pulls my head into her lap and pets my hair until I've cried myself to sleep.
I catch a glimpse of him once as I cross Diagon Alley around Christmas Time, hood pulled deep into my face. He's with the Golden Trio, their hands full of too many shopping bags. I think he's smiling and I decide to believe he's doing better.
„I'll bring it tomorrow,“ Harry says, as always, patience embodied. Draco wants to punch him in the face.
Harry wishes he wouldn't. Draco can't see the grime on his skin. It's staining his aristocratic fingers.
He smiles at me and takes a sip from his tea. Under his eyes, I get self-conscious and start fidgeting.
„Not quite yet.“ Flint's voice makes Derek stop. „Tell me, Kitty. How's life been, working for the Ministry? Chasing down your oldest friends?“
Now they're taking my breath away. Sometimes it feels like I'll come out of my body with the force of my pain.
“Well, Potter. Since we've gotten the past out of the way now, would you like to tell me how it comes that the Chosen One is taking Dreamscales?“
Blaise Zabini is, in fact, a great friend. Harry hadn't realized it before, because Draco and Zabini often seem so tense and they're definitely not the ones for showing public affection, like Harry is used to with Ron and Hermoine.
Adjusting the collar of his coat, Draco saunters up and down the aisles. He slows at the section with the chocolates.
Harry swallows, suddenly stunned. With his silver-blond hair falling around his face and those rather tight jeans and tucked in shirt, he looks gorgeous.
„Oh. Yeah, that's good.“ She smiles and I can tell it's fake. Hermione isn't always good at hiding her emotions. „Really, it's great. Hannah is really sweet. I just – Ron doesn't usually like very nice girls, does he? I mean...“
„I mean, we kissed once. But that's all.“ I can't quite look at her. This kiss... I've thought about it way, way too often.
– I hated him. I hated him for making me feel things that I didn't want to feel, things I thought of as shameful and forbidden. Mostly though, I hated him for not wanting me back.
I nod. It's a bit of a sore topic for Brighton. Not that he'd be disrespectful, but I believe he thinks of her as a victim, someone to pity. He's not the only one, so I'm a bit careful with it now.
My breathing is ragged the second they throw me into the cell, even though it's a pretty cell. There is the plank bed again and a bottle of water.
„Where are we headed?“ He smiles mysteriously. „I had two ideas, actually. But the first one might have been ruled out.“
I take a moment to think about it. He might be right, but how am I to tell as long as I have no idea what getting raped is like?
Harry is panting and I think he's forgotten his question, but when I want to slip my fingers under his waistband, he catches my hand.
After I tried hunting Draco down, talking to him, helping him, three nights in a row, Ron made me go to bed the fourth night. Made me sleep and rest and went out himself.
Pansy never thought of herself as a very good person. She knows that she's selfish, there are enough examples to prove that. The best one, of course, is when she stood up, pointing at Potter through the Great Hall and suggestes to hand him over.
He grins and takes his jeans off. The boxers he's wearing are endearingly shabby. I take off my own jeans and I don't miss him glancing at my legs, but it's just a moment, before he crawls under the covers and lifts the blanket for me.
He's half asleep when I get back. I set the glass down on the small table and sit down on the sofa, next to Draco's head.
I want to tell him that Teddy isn't really mine – just as Rose isn't mine. As Ron and Hermione aren't really mine anymore.
After the last night Sam spent at Pansy's place, Pansy had been hopeful. She'd grinned at Sam when she saw her at work the next day and Sam had grinned back. It had felt secret, like the grin had only been for Pansy. Her heart had been pounding in her chest and she'd tried to reign in the butterflies in her stomach.
I pass Aquaria's room. When I'm early, we sometimes get ready together, but today, I don't have time for chitchat and Aquaria looks too caught up in painting her face to pay me much attention. She does blow me a quick kiss though.
Time loses its meaning as Malfoy works his fingers inside me, stretching and probing and caressing that sweet spot that makes my whole body go tight, my eyes roll back.
I wait for her to talk a bit about her work and then ask: „Is it normal to think a lot about someone you're sleeping with?“
„I think that's exactly what he did,“ I fume. My blood is hot and threatening to burst through my veins.
„Talk to you,“ I say, leaning against my car. My heart is pounding. I wish he'd come closer, but I'm scared of approaching him. He might run.
, Malfoy, or I'll have your head. But- I have to fight a dragon. For the first task. Well, not fight it, I suppose, maybe
As he walks, Harry's eyes flick up to a circular, black, wired birdcage that hung from the hall's ceiling and frowns, noticing that there's only one bird in it. Now, Harry may have dropped Care of Magical Creatures two years ago, but even he knew that a singular bird that small didn't need a cage that large.
Harry caught on when he dropped to his knees next to Draco, blood covering swirling in the water around them.
"Where is he? Is he alright?" Came the worried voice of Draco. Harry grinned and swung his feet out of his bed.
friend," Ron mumbled, laying down in his bed and pulling the covers up. Harry opened his mouth, utterly appalled at what Ron was saying. He looked to Neville and Seamus for help, but they just turned away.
Draco, who was so livid with Umbridge for hurting Harry that he threatened to hurt her, only to be told off be Harry himself. And he listened. Because he would never say no to Harry.
"I'm going with you," Harry cut him off, and Draco opened his mouth to protest. "Nope, I've already decided. You're my best friend. There isn't anyone else I'd rather go with. Now. Teach me how to dance, you wanker."
Harry had had enough for one day. "I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy!" Harry reached out and shoved the taller boy's chest. "He's vile and cruel. And you're pathetic."
Draco, who began to grow distant from Harry at the beginning of their sixth year, which clearly had an effect on both of them. It was shown in dark circles under eyes and permanent frowns on lips.
"Malfoy," Granger tried. Over the past year he had made peace (or as peaceful as a Malfoy can get with a muggle born and a blood traitor) with Granger and Weasley for Harry's sake. "Malfoy, you haven't slept since before the fight, you should really get some rest. Madam Pomfrey is looking after Harry."
Harry, who caught Draco's eye after finishing the second task and, suddenly, Hermione's kiss and Ron's hug didn't mean a single thing because Draco was positively
He couldn't lose Potter because of some silly insults. He couldn't lose Potter because his heart beat for Harry Potter. His heart beat for the way his black locks were whipped by the wind when he went soaring after the Snitch in quidditch games. His heart beat for the determined look in those emerald green eyes whenever Potter glared at Umbridge, determined not to let her win. His heart beat for the way Potter grinned and laughed and spoke and walked and wrote and ate and everything.
"Well I have no other place to go, I will go to his shop then," Harry sighed and left the school unnoticed.
"Okay," Harriet laughed back and wiped her tears away. They walked to the Great Hall laughing and holding hands.
"So sod off, just because your father taught you to do something a certain way doesn't mean every other Slytherin has to do it that way," Merry glared at him.
"The purge was a time where many kingdoms slaughtered any type of magical creature," Harriet explained. "King Uther was the one who killed the most magical beings so many sorcerers learned to kill and torture so they could try and stop him."
"Well, I'm honored to escort you to your first ever party!" Merry giggled while looping their arms together. They skipped to catch up to the other first years. The party was not too loud nor not too boring. The first years sat together, drinking juice and playing games like exploding snap. The upperclassmen drank actually alcohol and talked about more adult matters like gossip. Harriet really likes this balance of fun and calming safety, she wanted to win more just to have this happen again. Off in the corner, Marcus and Derek were looking over at Harriet giggling and wiping away the dust on her nose.
"It is her enemy when she is awake and her best friend when she sleeps," Merry explained. Harry wondered if Beetlejuice would like a stuffed animal while she let him go under her shirt. He loved to wrap around her torso. Millicent was putting Autumn in her cage while the cat promised to harm Harry which made her laugh quietly. Harry sat by the window as the train slowed down, her heart was in her throat. Merry held her hand comfortingly.
"I always need to be by you then," She giggled. Draco blushed brightly which made his ears turn pink.
Merry sighed as she slipped into her pajama shorts, "Felix Rosier. He used to be with us every Christmas but as soon as he left Hogwarts, he was always with his parents. His parents are... horrid people. That's why most of the older kids absolutely hate him, they feel as though he betrayed them."
"They are delicious," Daphne licked her lips while Harriet wondered how people can be delicious, can't only food be delicious? Well, of course, there is cannibalism. Is there cannibalism in the Wizarding world?
Harriet looks up at Lucius a bit scared, he smiled slightly and nodded his head, "You are always welcome here in our home anytime, hopefully, you will be able to come back this summer."
"That was nice of him, wasn't it Harriet?" Merry giggled but stopped when she realized Harriet looked sad and confused.
Petunia always made sure to rip up any books that Harriet brought home that were about magic. Harriet cried the day Vernon screamed at her that magic didn't exist, Harriet's face was so bruised and beaten the next day. Her eyes no longer sparkled with mischief nor curiosity, her vibrant green eyes only seemed dull now. Harriet's eyes no longer looked like Lily's, it was a good day.
"What the hell was that?!" Merry shouted. A few students in the hallway turned their head to try and find the problem. Harriet grabbed her by the arm and pulled her towards an abandoned corridor which they found last night.
"Anyways I'm Seamus Finnigan," He smiled and stuck out his hand for her to shake. She shook it which she noticed he had a very firm grip.
"Maybe I will," Harriet smiled, she really liked flying and if joining the Quidditch team meant more flying, she was in.
"I'm okay, I promise," She whispered and wiped away the newly fallen tears and older that started to dry on her face.
"Chinese please," He nods and dials the phone number. Over the years the Wizarding World has become more open to muggle technology, not all wizards but most.
"No, no, no that was wonderful, thank you," He smiled again at her. "Do you feel any other sick like symptoms? Cough? Sore throat? Runny nose?"
"Well I am glad you enjoy potions, it is a very difficult and useful skill. Not many can brew potions well," He smiled at her.
"It feels weird!" Harriet groaned. Merry was putting her hair up in a really tight ponytail. It felt so weird because Harriet always had it down to hide her scar. She had only ever tied it back when she was doing chores.
"Well it's now or never," Harry said with a shaking voice. She grabbed some floo powder which was in a little pot on the floor. She stepped in the fireplace and closed the gates from the inside.
"Hush," Harry giggled and blushed a bit. They sat by the other Slytherins who were all sitting up in the front, all because they were not afraid of Snape. Neville once again looked quite scared so she waved to him which made him smile and wave back excitedly. The bell quickly rang which made Harry quite scared, what if she hated this class. She loved potions but what if her favorite class turned out to be a big flop. As the bell rang, Snape entered very dramatically which made Harriet snort. She is going to have a really hard time not making fun of him for being so dramatic. Before he started taking attendance, he looked over them dramatically which made all of the students look away, except Harriet. Harriet stared at him directly and smiled. He scoffed at her and swept away and started to take attendance.
"If you put away the eyes," Merry groaned. Harriet quickly puts away the eyes in the storage room while Merry stirred the potion correctly. Snape looked at the two with an eyebrow raised, they are using the more advanced ingredients for this potion. He nodded to himself, she really did have a clever mind, even more than her mother.
Merry popped another sweet into her mouth, "Here let me say names so you are not confused any longer." With that she started naming the people in the room, "Those are the Carrow twins," With that both of their heads shot up, Merry pointed to the one of the left, "That one is Flora, " She then gestered to the one of the right, "That one is Hestia." They both smirked and looked at each other, Merry must have said the opposite name. Harriet noted that the correct Flora seemed to bite her lip more and had a slight cut on her upper ear while the correct Hestia had a lighter brown shade of eyes, it had some golden flecks in it.
"You could just send them an email," Merry explained. Merry showed her how to send an email and to who. Harry sent an email to Dumbledore and McGonagall.
"Diagon Alley," She whispered as she threw the powder down. She closed her eyes and felt her stomach flutter as she felt air whip around her. When the air stopped she opened her eyes slowly to see a person looking at her.
"Yeah, I got him before first year. I named him after some name I read in a book once," He shrugged and sat next to her. Her heart started to beat faster and she just keep petting his cat. Marcus and Harriet kept talking for most of the remainder of the night, most of his replies were grunts or nods but she didn't mind, she could tell he was engaged in the conversation by his eyes never leaving hers. Merry had her hand on her mouth, trying to stiffle some laughs while watching Harriet stumble on her words and gesture her hands more than usual just from talking to Marcus. Blaise and Pansy were teasing Draco for pouting most of the night because Harriet was talking to Flint all night and not him. Vincent and Geogory were eating and talking to each other over by the older students.
"I'm not sure," Harriet looked down and started to fake cry silently. Snape, who has seen his fair share of fake criers, almost immediately could tell that she was faking. But even though he would never admit it, fear that she was actually scared and crying was racing through his body.
"Very good Potter, 10 points to Slytherin," He smiled. She smiled brightly and sat a bit straighter. She got points for her house already!
"How were the books about nuclear war and origami?" Ms. Haack asked as she saw the books she was returning.
"I have a lot of these families in my blood," Harriet thought back to her visit with the Goblins that showed her bloodline, she was starting to realize how intertwined Purebloods truly are.
"Yeah, you're probably right," Harriet smiled slightly and turned to go to class. Merry jogged up to her.
"Longbottom!" Snape growled and stomped towards the trembling boy. Harriet still in the storage room knocked down a fully stocked shelf on propose. The class was silently and Harriet held her breath. Snape stormed into the storage room to see an equally trembling girl whose arm was covered in slime.
"Spectacular!" Harriet smiled brightly which made Merry roar with laughter all over again. Harriet picked up the broom from the ground and when it was by her side, she tried pushing down. The broom refused to move downward, Harriet could move it up and side to side though. Malfoy got his broom up second and Merry third. Malfoy was puffing out his chest proudly while Merry was very excited to get on her broom. After everyone got their brooms up with the help of Hooch, she explained more about the rules which still made Harriet's stomach drop.
"Because that would mean ruining my makeup and hair which you did," She emphasized the word you. Merry's face flashed with realization and slowly lowered the spoon down.
"What is wrong?" Pansy overheard them which peeked interest in the other girls finishing getting dressed.
"Have a wonderful first day everyone," He smiled and left behind a very dramatic Snape. The girls left to explore the castle and hopefully eat soon.
"Thanks Harriet," Neville interrupted, "You really didn't have to but thank you for doing that," He blushed and looked down shyly.
"Yes, it will be!" Merry stuck out her tongue at him. Narcissa had her face in her hands while chuckling and Lucius was shaking his hand while covering his smile with his hand.
"Okay fine," She sighed and pulled back her blankets. They grabbed their robes and brooms while Harriet let Beetlejuice sleep and digest a mouse that he ate earlier. They walked quietly out of their dorm and common room. They then sprinted towards the Quidditch field. As they snuck in, Merry climbed on the broom first and took off. Harriet got on next and just floated for a bit. Merry twirled and dropped in the air while laughing. Harriet took off slowly and learned how to turn and go faster by herself, she read a lot of books on how to fly.
„Warrington wants to inspect Parkinson's shop,“ Ron says as I walk into the office with two cups of coffee.
During the next weeks, we find a rhythm that works for all of us – Draco spending most nights at mine. Some at Pansy's.
With a flick of her wand, she summons two glasses of water.  „How does it feel, being back in England? I'm sure you must miss the sun.“
“Actually, I just remembered – Draco and I have an appointment. I think you'll have to postpone your conversation. We'll be in touch, yeah?“
Sam's eyes are sad, even more – desperate. It tugs at the strings of Pansy's heart, but she's sworn herself to be better. Afterall, she's spent years telling Draco over and over again how Derek wasn't good for him, how he only hurt him. And even though this is of course different, she's not going to make the same mistake as her friend.
I know because it was shortly after Harry's and my forth round of shagging, this time the exchange of sloppy, but utterly devoted blowjobs.
It's truly only when she smiles back at me that I'm struck by the realization that I have no idea how to flirt. I mean, that would be true as a general statement as well, but especially considering I'm fucking
It's weird that no one seems to have seen or heard from him since he got free, but – well. My friends aren't really Malfoy's. Why would they know anything about his whereabouts?
Astoria seems to read my thoughts, because she says: „Draco probably hasn't told you about Scorpius's illness. Don't take that personally. He simply prefers not to think about it at all.“
He's taller than I am and he smells somewhat good and he's fucking strong. My wand is lying a few feet away from us in the grass.
Harry finds it almost funny how worked up Ron gets over that fact and then he feels guilty for finding it funny.
Draco rolls his eyes before Harry kisses him and all he can do is gasp as the brunet's hands wander up his thighs again, gently pushing them apart. He doesn't really notice that Harry is opening the bottle. He's kissing him and pushing his hips up a little, distracting him, bumping against the Gryffindor's elbow.
„Yes. It's a thank you. For putting up with me throughout those last days. I know I've been hellish.“
The door of the Leaky Cauldron creaks as I open it and slip inside. The warmth envelops me like a blanket and I pull my hands out of my pockets.
“I want to please you,“ I say and it's not a lie. “And I want to give you something, even though I know I'll never be able to pay you back. But at least...“
His gaze darts to the door. Maybe he is nervous I'm going to complain about him to his slimy git of a boss.
I smile tightly and allow him to see the tears in my eyes, even though they don't fall. „I know, Harry. And I like you, too. But we don't belong together.“
„Harry,“ I read from her lips. „I miss you,“ she signs and then her lips are so close to mine and I just... surrender.
Something hits Draco's belly unexpectedly and liquid cold is running over his stomach. He flinches and looks down.
„You've... never been with a guy before?“ I ask him between kisses as he pulls me on top of him, always moving, clawing at me, letting go again. Running his fingers through my hair, over my face.
„I love you,“ Harry says. It's not the first time he says it, but it always sends a pleased shiver through Draco's body. He kisses Harry's neck. „I know.“
Children can't control their magic, or only very little. Intense emotions often lead to an outbreak of magic. My spell was supposed to trigger Teddy's magic, but it doesn't.
“But I have to try,“ I say hoarsely. “Maybe they'll at least believe that I made Weasley think I was raped. And that he felt like he had to protect me because of it.“
I regain my composure and clear my throat. „No, honestly. I mean – yes. I am wondering if he might be queer. But that has nothing to do with me personally.“
I take a deep breath. „And now you want to arrest Malfoy because Runcorn raped him? What kind of evidence is that?“
They're silent for a moment, then Harry asks, gently: „I take it your family wasn't... very accepting?“
Especially not since Draco is gone and certainly already sleeping with other people. The thought of him calling someone else
I spend a lot of time with my students, mostly to prepare them for the exams that are coming up, but also because spending time with Ron and Hermione is difficult now.
„Like – is it normal to think about them in a non-sexual context? How often should you think about past fucks?“
„It usually happens involuntarily, I think. I feel like his haircolour mirrors his mood,“ Potter goes on.
I help him settle in my bed and try not to think about how we used to sleep in here together. And do other things than sleep as well.
Hermoine knows that, for Harry, being left is a deep-rooted fear that might have played an important part in why exactly his relationship with Ginny had ended as well. Being left – and being betrayed.
„It wasn't just me. I'm not – I'm nothing special. I'm not better, I'm...“ His hands are stroking down his denims again, the pace fast.
I know Draco is as gay as one could be, but it still ignites a hot fire inside of me – the bad kind of fire.
„Well,“ Draco says, shifting his weight. He has given up appearing strong and unshakable in front of Harry. It cleary didn't work out in his favour.
„He's a dumb Gryffindor, but he means well. I don't think he wants to hurt you. And if he does, he'll regret it.“
After a while, there were too many creatures and not enough heroes. Even while using knock out spells and a huge amount of power, the Potters still couldn't take them all on.
"What do you want us to do?" Draco asked. He didn't like where this was going. Mordred reminded him of a mix between Harry and himself. Not having a choice, being raised in a bad way, not knowing what was happening.
Harry sighed, "When I was 17, I had to fulfill my prophecy. I killed Voldemort, but in doing so, I became the Master of Death. To do that, first you have to get these three items. The Invisibility Cloak—which I inherited from my father, the Elder Wand—which I got after I disarmed Draco who had disarmed Dumbledore who was the owner of the wand and the Resurrection Stone—which Dumbledore had left for me after he died. I got those three items. But, before I defeated Voldemort, I had to die. I came back, of course, using the Resurrection Stone. I greeted Death like an old friend. After that day, I had the constant feeling of death in the back of my head. I could
"Well, Sir Gwaine, he..." Draco took a breath in, "He brought us all back like the prophecy said he would. He fought Thanos. He took control of the Infinity Stones. But in doing so, he essentially drained his magical core. He's in a coma. We don't know when he's gonna wake up."
"There was energy surge in the middle of London twenty minutes ago. I sent agents to check it out, but they say nothing was found besides some blood."
Everyone was standing behind Steve, Natasha, T'Challa and Harry. Snape had wisely stayed in the upstairs with Shuri, Scorpius and Vision. Draco, Sirius, Wanda, Bruce (who was in a Hulk Buster suit seeing as Hulk didn't wanna come out), Sam, Rhodey, Okoye and Loki were ready for a battle standing behind the four
. So when I went to face Voldemort, the Snitch opened. It was the Resurrection Stone. So Voldemort shot me with the Killing Curse and I died. Technically. I came back, of course. Narcissa was in charge of checking if I was alive or not. She felt me breathing or something and asked me if Draco was alive. I nodded and she lied to Voldemort by saying I was dead to protect her and her son. Hagrid took me back to Hogwarts while being dragged by the Death Eaters. Neville destroyed the snake Nagini, who was another Horcrux using the sword. I jumped down out of Hagrid's arms, Draco tossed me his wand and the battle began. I ended up killing Voldemort. But his people killed so many of ours. Fred Weasley, Ron's older brother died, causing his twin George so much pain. Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks died, Teddy's parents. Colin Creevey who was just a boy who wanted to fight for his school and friends died. Lavender Brown, Ron's ex, died.
"Assist of murder of Cedric Diggory. Murder of Tom Riddle. And Attempted Murder of Andrew Creevey. It's a really long story."
Harry set him down and looked at him, "I love you so much, you know that right?" Scorp nodded. "You know how I told you I'd never leave you?" He nodded again. "Well, I might have to leave for a bit."
The Avengers slowly trickled out of the room, going to the main lobby of the Compound. Draco found Pepper there with Morgan and Scorpius.
Draco sighed. "Yes. But not right now. It's been over 50 years and I'm still not over it. And with the whole immortality thing... I don't know. I don't want to still be a 16 year old boy while my kid is dying."
Arthur groaned, "The one time we need magic, we can't use it since our resident warlock is unconscious."
"That's the plan, Tony." Harry stated. "We have 4 months to go, though. We'll start the spoiling once he's here."
"Oh, but, of course. She arrived on the same day the warlock arrived. My warning has been said. I must go. Proceed with caution, Master of Death."
"Yeah. I'm actually not even from here. Like this planet. I'm from a different universe, still Earth, but Earth-616, not this one. Well, technically I
As soon as he signed, magic swept through the room. Hermione figured this was the magic trying to find out if Draco and Harry were a worthy couple.
He turned back to the Knights and Merlin. "Thank you. Maybe we'll see each other again in the future." He smiled before carving the same runes he did on Titan with the exception with the year and the Earth. Earth-616 and year 2020.
"Right." Morgana was still a sore subject for both Merlin and Arthur. Merlin because he had poisoned her in order to save Camelot and Arthur because he couldn't do anything to help her.
Reading that made Hermione spit out the tea she was drinking. No way in hell would Sirius Black and Severus Snape ever date!
Harry smiled when he saw his son. It had been a rough couple years but he had accepted a while ago that maybe they weren't gonna come back and decided to get better for his son. It was a bit hard at points but he was finally in a good place mentally and decided to take advantage of that by spending more time with his son.
"Yeah. There's something that I talked to Harry about that he decided you should know. Harry's telling Teddy right know since he doesn't know this either. Only us four are the ones who will know this."
"Well, we did stuff. I started getting sick. Like throwing up, nauseous sick. Harry was there for me, as always, but one day he asked—well, more like stated, I guess—'it's not like you're pregnant or anything, so why are you still so sick?'. And that's when I remembered—"
'. It was Luna Lovegood who told me to look not in Ravenclaw tower, but to speak to the Grey Lady, Helena Ravenclaw. It was Draco Malfoy for throwing me his wand after I came back from the dead. It was Narcissa Malfoy who said I was dead when in reality I wasn't. It was everyone else besides me. I don't think any of us would be here if it wasn't for everyone else. I think that if Hagrid hadn't come knocking down the door at the cabin in the middle of nowhere, I wouldn't be here. But all of you would. Everyone here was the main reason we're all here. It wasn't a one-man job. It was a job for a whole damn village. It was everyone. We're all here because we did this as a team. And we bloody well better appreciate that. I don't want to talk about those who we lost, because we all lost someone. Think about those still here. Don't think about Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks. Think about Teddy Lupin, who's still here. Don't think about Fred Weasley, think about George Weasley. Think about everything we have left. Those who we lost will always be in our hearts. But don't think about them so much that it takes over your world. Like Draco said, live for them instead," He stopped to take a breath, chuckling a bit,"I said I'd keep this somewhat short but that obviously didn't happen. So, I'm just gonna say, we're here. Be grateful. Thank you."
"I fell through the Veil. I originally landed on a different world, Earth-37, I think. They had a Wizarding World, though a more advanced one, so I was able to get to their Ministry and go through their Veil. That world had been in a war between the Muggles and Wizards. Then I landed on another one, Earth-441. Although they didn't have a Wizarding World, they had a Veil. The Muggles had been testing it and trying to figure out what it was with little to no luck. Then I landed on a planet in this galaxy. I believe it was called Titan...? I found a young man, long black hair, green eyes, pale skin. I told him I had to go to Earth and he teleported me here. It was sort of like Apparation. He told me before he left, 'He's coming. The Mad Titan Thanos is looking for the Infinity Stones. Tell the Avengers'. I didn't know who they were or how the heck I'd find them. I've been on this Earth for a year or so now. Then in a pub I hear some man complaining that their superior was bring up an old case from the 70s about an unknown sudden energy burst. I knew someone from another world was here so I started looking. And that lead me to here."
"He didn't!" Ron yelled, obviously angered by his best friend hurting a man who in his mind did nothing wrong. "If anything, we should have left Malfoy to die!"
"Actually, there isn't. There was a second Lord Black but he died in battle with my uncle." Harry smiled innocently as he took a sip of the water he had in his goblet.
At one point, once there was nowhere to go other than death, Sam, Rhodey, Nick Fury and Maria Hill showed up with a carrier to evacuate the people and get them away from the city.
He pulled up the street footage of London on July 28, 1970. He saw the blood that the Agents took the sample from. He went back a couple frames and saw the three. Harry Potter, Draco Potter and Edward Lupin. They looked like they did now, except maybe Lupin looked a bit different. He went frame by frame and suddenly they were gone. Without a trace, no one even noticing them or the blood stain.
Draco gladly took the hand and shook it. As he did, Teddy gasped slightly, looking at Draco with wide eyes.
"Right, well, I told Merlin everything and he took me to meet the Great Dragon, Kilgharrah, and he gave me another prophecy. He said 'once the sky is colored brightly, a man of grey shall usher forth the return of monsters and a world's doom. Once the balance shifts, a proposition shall cause a rise of a new god and a fall of friends. When the day comes that the sky is thick with water, a broken man shall bring the end of wealth and an era of sorrow. When the moment comes that the true one reveals himself, a suspicious death shall cause an era of harmony. The answer you seek is more obvious than you think. Look for the broken one and join all three to make a whole. Life and death, two sides of the same coin, one cannot survive without the other. The battle will shed blood, all but one will survive, his sacrifice the biggest of all'."
Draco looked at him for a good ten seconds before he started making a drink. He mixed together the weirdest things like bourbon, apple juice, crushed cashews, ginger, milk, a lemon and ice. He put it in a glass and set it in front of Tony, as if daring him to drink it.
"Let me think about it. You can call me in 24 hours, assuming you won't lose my number in those 24 hours. Where would I work?"
"He speaks in all riddles and prophecies. He literally can't do anything else. It's like he wants us to hate him." Merlin whispered.
Harry stood up and held his wand up to Mr Creevey who had been detained by Ron and Neville, who had also been an Auror before switching to be the Herbology Professor at Hogwarts.
"And I finally snapped when Andrew Creevey shot Draco. I was arrested on sight, there was a 'arrest Harry Potter if he goes crazy' agreement or something going on. And of course, 'arrest whoever helps Harry Potter go crazy', aka, Draco. They didn't arrest Teddy because he was only ten. We were on the run for 52 years I believe it was. We faked our deaths but stupid Hugo Granger-Weasley found us and the world knew we were alive. We infiltrated the Ministry, I got caught and almost actually sent to Azkaban by Granger, but I got away, found Draco, we found Teddy on the way and jumped through the Veil, not knowing where we were gonna end up."
"None found other than the three. We searched all the files but didn't find anyone that was related to the three."
"Okay. So, we're going to need all wizards. Harry, I know you just came back, but we need you. Draco, you can kill me later. Everyone else is going to stay in the Jet until we're needed." Steve said, people nodding at his orders, loading guns, prepping wings and rockets. "Tony already got the notification. He's picking Clint up and coming over here. They'll be here in two minutes."
Before Harry could stop himself, he found himself spilling his whole life story to the group of people. "Yes. Me and my husband were caught in a bad place at the anniversary of the war and were forced to go into hiding. Before you ask, yes, we were in a war, I was the supposed hero of the war, having died. But the
"I wasn't going after Ron or Harry! You should know that better than anyone considering you're the one who only protected Harry because of your obsession with his mother!"
"You never know. There were a lot that were sentenced to the Veil. We don't know where they are but we have to be on the look out. Like Moody said, 'constant vigilance'." Sirius said.
"Oh, fuck, uh.." Harry gently set Draco on the floor, making sure his back was facing up, seeing as the bullet hit his backside. "Someone detain him! Who here is a Healer?! We need a Healer!" Although Aurors were trained in simple healing spells, they caught Dark Wizards and chances that Dark Wizards have a gun on them are slim to none so they didn't learn how to heal gunshots. Hannah Abbott, a healer that worked at St Mungo's and that had married Neville Longbottom, ran over and cast some spells, the only one Harry recognized was the diagnostic spell.
His eyes glowed gold. No one in the history of the Wizarding World had that amount power since Merlin himself. Not Voldemort, not Dumbledore, not Grindelwald. Only those who had the power of all the witches and wizards before them had that kind of power.
They all held hands, Teddy in the middle, as they passed through the Veil, not hearing the spell that hit Draco on his way through.
He smiled a bit and nodded before going back to Harry, kissing his hair before intertwining their fingers.
Draco was standing off to the side. "I was wondering if you would actually follow me." He chuckled then started walking towards a library.
"Well maybe you should've!" Draco yelled back, then turned to look at Harry, "Harry, say goodbye to Teddy," he whispered.
Teddy turned around, holding a wand to the door to hold the man out while using slight wandless magic to shield them.
"Kilgarrah. The last dragon. Uther killed the others." Merlin explained. "Have you ever encountered a dragon?"
"Who's that?" It was a picture of an ultrasound. Like all magical pictures, the ultrasound of the baby was moving, showing the baby slightly moving around.
Harry completely forgot about the water he was grabbing and just came running down the hall into their room. When he saw Draco leaning against the chair, he ran over to him and helped him back onto the bed. He quickly sent a patronus to Severus saying that the baby was coming.
"Every second. But I have you. My beautiful son. If only he could see how amazing you've turned out. When you were a baby, you were definitely your papas boy. You liked him more than you liked me."
"I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict." Strange panted out while looking at Peter.
"Oh, you know it Stark." Harry smirked and through him a wink. He jogged out of the common room then came back, "One last gift for the team. It took a bit of time, but, you know me, always doing the craziest things."
"No. Just of the Healers report that its us and that we're dead. But your friend Granger is still the Minister. We might just have to go and do this now."
Now Potter looked up, assessed who he was talking to before speaking again, "How can I help you, Mr..."
George didn't know what to expect when he walked into Gringotts. He wanted to see what Harry had left him in the vault. A million galleons. That was a lot. Harry had always been a close friend of him and Fred's. It broke Harry's heart when he found out Fred died.
Scorpius' first birthday was filled with presents from literally everyone. The whole world now knew that the power couple of the Avengers (following Tony and Pepper, of course) had a child. They knew his name was Scorpius Potter and that he lived with the Avengers and his family. Anyone who wasn't living under a rock, had sent a crap ton of gifts to the door of the compound. Most were from people Tony had worked with, but some were from random people. Harry had made sure to write a thank you note to everyone that sent something, which took a while.
They had all gotten a considerable amount of gifts, seeing as there were a lot of inhabitants in the Compound. But, in Harry's opinion, Tony's present to the Arthurians was the best. He had saved it for last, of course.
"6th year was Severus. Slughorn was Potions. 7th year, we don't know. I was hiding with my family and Harry was on the Horcrux Hunt." Draco explained.
A couple hours later, Harry woke back up. This time, instead of in the medical wing, he woke up in his and Draco's room.
Scorpius opened the box and smiled at the blue diamond ring. It was a simple silver band with a simple cut blue diamond.
"Here's an idea. Why don't we stop arguing and figure out what everyone can do and based off of that we figure out a way to take Thanos down?"
"WAKANDA FOREVER!" The King yelled which caused a chain reaction of the sector of the border to be opened, heroes running towards the creatures that were now entering through.
Along with him, there were two other recruits. Sam Wilson, aka Falcon, who Steve and Natasha met on their run from Barnes and HYDRA. And James Rhodes, or Rhodey. He was War Machine and Tony's best friend. He was a superhero before he joined the Avengers, so joining was just an extra thing.
"Of course. This prophecy took over 17 years of my life. People were praising my name before I knew of the Wizarding World. While I was living in a cupboard, people were thanking me for something I didn't remember doing. For something my parents died over. For something I should've died over." Harry said, his voice growing more and more angry as he went on. He took a breath at the end, trying to calm his anger. Thinking about Voldemort made him just want to blow things up. But he had to continue with his mission to get his family back. "Well. Thank you for everything. If you ever feel like world hopping, Earth-616 is where I'll be. preferably after the year 2021, if possible. Hopefully they'll all be back by then." Harry stood from the table. "If you'll excuse me."
"And how'd you realize the first one was a death eater?" Tony asked, pulling up a holographic screen and started taking notes.
"It was actually his idea." Draco smiled. "I wasn't going to bring it up until later, but he just brought it up one day before we told the Avengers but we didn't tell you guys until now."
"Easy. Live through a war when you're a child. Be the center of all the bad guys attention, meaning they want to kill you every chance they get. Oh! And don't forget the abusive relatives." Harry shrugged, unzipping the top half of the uniform to look at the bruise that was already fading from where the arrow hit.
"It's a spell from my Healer days. I taught Harry since taking them on yourself it kind of awkward."
"Yes. We'll need to catch up at some point, preferably not in the middle of a battle scene." Harry smiled.
"Draco was about 5 months along when they found us and killed him, killing our baby girl in the process."
Harry summoned his Patronus. When he came back, he realized that he could do it again, seeing as his family was back. He wispy dragon flew through the ceiling of the Jet.
"I am indeed Harry Potter, if the scar doesn't tell you that. Now answer me, who are you?" Harry asked again.
A week later, Merlin was back on his feet. Tony had insisted on buying him a new outfit, but Merlin said no. Tony bought him a whole closet anyway. He bought all of them new closets.
Severus pulled his shirt up and looked at the wound. It looked like a normal stab wound, so why was it causing him to bleed so much?
"Okay, well, I'm kinda not supposed to tell you this but Tony's building your kid a whole wing in the new Compound. Well, for the Potters. It's pretty big, just like the rest of the compound."
Then there was a conversation between the robot, who Harry learned was named Ultron, and the main six Avengers. Then Tony's Iron Legion broke through the walls and started attacking. Steve flipped a table over, Maria Hill started shooting, Thor started throwing around his hammer, Natasha also started shooting, one of the Legion almost killed Helen Cho, Clint threw Steve his shield, Harry stood with Sirius, back to back, and started firing spells around, Draco and Teddy did the same. One second Harry was freezing some of the robots and then Sirius hit them with a
Teddy sighed and cast a spell that summoned the Knights' armor and some dragon hide armor for Merlin.
"He landed in Camelot, which we all know from the legendary myths of King Arthur and the Knights of Round Table. Well, Harry, he met them. He met the King, Knights and Merlin. Merlin is the one who took him to see a dragon who gave him a prophecy." Natasha continued. She pulled up the prophecy and the notes they had made to figure out what it meant. "This is the prophecy he was given. We made notes to figure out what the hell it was saying, but in the end it was Harry who figured it out. Then the battle happened. Harry made the circlet by combining the three Deathly Hallows. Apparently, the power or magic, or something was too much because he fell to his knees due to him feeling overwhelmed. What he didn't know was that that was what brought all of you back."
He was paler than usual, making the scar on his forehead more prominent. The shirt that he wore (which Natasha saw him wear multiply times) that normally form fitting for him looked like it was two sized two big for him. It also didn't help when his hair had started to grow out and Natasha knew that if he could grow a beard, he would have stubble at this point.
. To conjure a Patronus, you need to focus on your happiest memory and use that as a focus for your magic."
"Also, it's Draco Potter now. And, not that you have any right to know, you're a grandfather now. We have a son, Scorpius Potter. We have a family, and you're here in prison. I hope you rot in here, and I know Draco feels the same way." He finished before apparating, right before Lucius started screaming.
Harry turned to him and smiled widely, "So the Prophet wasn't lying when they said you took on Draco's hair and my eyes," He pulled Teddy into a tight hug before someone sent a stunner their way, though easily deflected by Harry.
Sadness filled Harry's insides. He knew Draco's eyes and how the deceived him. Draco felt a lot, but of course he wouldn't say so. So Harry just nodded and pulled his hand away from Draco's, ignoring the crashing and burning of his heart in his chest. "Okay. See you around, then.
"Hmm, difficult, very difficult." Harry jumped as a voice came from the hat when it was placed over his head.
"You need to tell me," Harry took Draco's hand and led him to the couch, "what that man said to you. Right now, if you don't mind."
. Today Harry had promised himself he'd go and talk to Cedric to warn him about the first task. Which, unfortunately, happened to be bloody dragons. Hagrid had shown them to Harry last night, and Harry had blinked in surprise when he remembered Hagrid had almost kept a Norwegian Ridgeback as a pet. There had been a Norwegian Ridgeback amongst the group of dragons, and Harry thought it was the most terrifying of the pack.
It was Harry's. Harry's Gryffindor quidditch sweatshirt he had left in Draco's dorm five years ago, part of the set of clothes that Draco had mailed back to him in the owl post during breakfast in the Great hall.
Salt water sprayed Harry's face as he stared over the edge of the cliffs of Azkaban. This was his first- and hopefully last- time here. Ethan Coldstone, his assistant Auror, stepped up nervously. The poor guys was just an eighteen year old trainee that had been assigned to Harry. Then again, Harry wasn't much older. Just twenty.
Harry scowled right back, grabbing his bag off the chair next to his bed and standing up. "I'm not dealing with you- with
Draco caught on when the Triwizard Cup appeared in front of the maze, Potter clinging to it with one hand and to Diggory in the other.
And those eyes. Those stormy grey eyes that held every emotion ever when they met Harry's green right there in Ron's office. Harry forced himself to look at Ron. "Hey, Ron, I uh, got my case. i just came to see who my partner was."
It was awful when he realized it. Draco had been walking out of the train, shoulder to shoulder with Blaise, and he heard the whispers that Potter had blacked out because of the Dementor. Draco should have laughed and made a joke.
Harry pointed his wand at the lock on the cell door, and it opened with a click. A Dementor peered its head through the hole in the wall across from Draco's cell, and Ethan backed away, sliding his hand into Harry's, which didn't go unnoticed by Draco.
Draco nodded a little as though he'd been expecting this question. He stood and walked forward, standing in front of Harry. Harry held his breath, afraid to touch him, afraid he was a ghost that would shimmer away if he got too close.
from the Black Lake. Draco was pretty important, wasn't he? I mean- Potter didn't have anyone else to tease him the way Draco did.
"You don't know how to dance?" Draco blinked. Harry shook his head. "Well, then, maybe we should just go together. So- so you don't make a full of yourself. And, you know, like- as two friends. But if you don't want to, or, like, if you want to go with someone else-"
That got him looking up. Draco had said his first name- and not in the spiteful tone it usually came out in. Harry sat up, shoving his glasses back on and looked at Malfoy, who was chewing his lip and looking at the book in front of him.
That had been Harry's first mistake. Being appalled at Draco's actions when they hadn't been any better than his own. But by the time he realized this, Draco and his kisses were gone. Draco was arrested, along with his parents. Harry had forced himself to move on. To be with Ethan.
badges at him. Malfoy was quite proud of them and wouldn't shut up about the fact that he had made them himself. Harry, reluctantly, and to himself, had admitted that it was really quite impressive.
And that's all Draco was worried about. If he could calm Harry down and make him happy for even a little amongst all the terror and confusion, then he would. So he let himself fall into laughter alongside his green-eyed best friend.
He told them about meeting the Defense teacher of the year, Remus Lupin (who was also one of his dad's best friends), the Dementor attack on the train and hearing his mothers voice. He talked about Sirius Black and how he supposedly betrayed his family. He talked about Scabbers being Peter Pettigrew, who was alive, meaning that Sirius was innocent. He told them about the Time Turner and saving his godfather.
He told them everything. He started by telling them about how he lived with his Aunt, Uncle and cousin. He told them about living under the cupboard and being called a freak.
, if you'd been paying any attention whatsoever, you would've heard the water and footsteps. That says, person!"
As soon as they entered the room, Snape looked around. There were books covering an entire wall, three tables set up, all with cauldrons and a book stand ready to go. Along one of the walls, there were potion ingredients. From spider eyes to honeycomb, there was everything. Along the third wall, there were pre-made potions, calming draughts, healing potions, Veritaserum, the potion used to bring back people with horcruxes.
When they arrived, the goblin, who George learned was named Trielk, asked for three more drops of blood. George did as he was told and the vault opened.
"Alright, so now, goodbyes? We don't know whats gonna be on the other side of that. So, just in case," Draco suggested.
He started stumbling, "I don't know what's -- I don't know what's happening. I don't--" He fell into Tony's arms, "I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mr. Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go...
Hermione had a thought. Sirius Black had fallen through the Veil. So had Severus Snape. Did that mean they were with Harry?
"I'm right here, Harry. And if you could stop kissing in front of me, that would be lovely," Teddy spoke up.
Once she was seated in an office with Griphook, she began speaking. "Harry Potter fell through the Veil, but he is alive. He married Draco Malfoy. I always denied their relationship, never accepting it. But, as new information came to light, I wish, if it possible, for them to have a legal marriage in the Wizarding World."
Sirius just started laughed and patted Harry's back before hugging him. "If only James could see you now. And of course I'll be your little pups godfather."
"Excuse me for a second, boys and Ms. Potts." Natasha smiled innocently and went over to talk to Draco. "What's up with you?"
Once the runes were drawn, a couple on each corner of the room, he kneeled in the middle of the room, his charm still active so Thanos didn't notice him. He summoned all the Hallows.
By the time he got off the stage, he received many pats on the backs, nods of approvals and the sort. He went back to his seat in between Teddy and Harry. He had been really surprised when he had been invited by Hermione Granger to sit with them but had suspected it only had to do with the fact that he was Teddy's guardian for the night.
"But jumping across universes does." Merlin smirked. This was something the girl didn't know. It was always fun teaching young people how the universes worked. "For us, it's 2053, for them it's 2020. For us, they just jumped through the Veil a couple days ago. For them, it was 40 years ago. When they jumped through, they were essentially pushed back in time in a different timeline. But since no portraits of them were made, no one knows what will happen to them. Merlin had one made of him and since he is from this universe, I have all of his memories until 2053."
"When he visited me, he was depressed. He had lost his husband, godson and godfather all in one day. But he had a son he had to stay strong for. For someone with a lot of 'baggage', as the kids say these days, he was very strong. He doesn't give up. Must be the Slytherin in him." Merlin was quiet but Hermione didn't speak. She could tell he had something else he wanted to say, "There's a book. The most accurate book, in my opinion. Merlin and His Majesties Knights: The Unknown Past by Taleia Dhisor. She was a witch in the 1700s, I believe. She was who found my portrait before you. I gave her almost every piece of information of my life, up until my death, of course. Not many people believed it, so it did not go far. Who would believe that Merlin the great sorcerer was a manservant for King Arthur? There is a copy of the book in this library."
"Can I help you?" Potter asked, not even bothering to look up from a case file he needed to work on.
Severus rolled his eyes. "You do realize that your brat is going to be the most spoiled child ever because of all the Avengers, correct?"
Harry let out a tiny laugh, wiping the tears that were falling on his cheeks with his sleeve, "You're the bloody idiot, you idiot," Harry pulled out a similar box, inside the box was another beautiful ring. It had a gold band with a perfectly cut silver topaz in the middle.
Harry sighed, "My first tattoo was the Draco constellation, placed right above my heart and I got it because I love you."
The doors barged open, the security entering the office, circling Harry with their wands pointed at him.
"Yes, I did." Sirius said while stretching his arm out to Loki watching as the God hesitated before taking his hand and being pulled up by Sirius.
He heard Gwaine gasp as he passed the room but Arthur was too busy setting Merlin on the bed in the room next door.
Harry could hear the sound of swords being unsheathed, Harry also unsheathed his sword and was ready for whoever came out from the trees that were surrounding the area.
After he had woken everyone up (if he had to jump on beds to get some of them up, no one mentioned it because they all loved him too much), they made their way to the Christmas tree for presents. They were all in their pajamas, of course, but Tony had gotten the couples (or soon to be couples, in his opinion) or best friends matching pajamas and no one knew until they were all together.
As Charlie read, the others started to tear up. They might've hated Malfoy, but if Harry loved him, he must've changed.
"So, how much longer are you going to stay here and act like you're not just waiting for Draco and Sirius to finish talking?"
Severus whispered a quick spell then said, "He's overwhelmed. He has so much knowledge in his brain he doesn't know what to do with it. I'm assuming when he took power of the Infinity Stones, he gained knowledge of our world. How else would he know all that about us? He only spent a day with all of you, and I've never told anyone, besides Lily, about my father."
Teddy, since Harry first fell in a coma, had changed his appearance to resemble Harry and Draco again. This time, he had dark unruly hair with gray eyes and pale skin. For him, looking like people he lost was a sort of coping mechanism. It was odd, but no one questioned it.
"You were stabbed by a sword forged in dragons breath. Arthur, the Knights and Guinevere took you to the Lake of Avalon and you just disappeared? Where did you go?"
"Um, Teddy was an amazing person. He was a metamorphous, which I don't know if you know what that means, but he can change his appearance to however he wants it. His parents were Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin, both who were friends of Sirius and Harry's parents."
"Death Eaters. Voldemort's followers. A lot were caught by the Ministry and sent through the Veil. I'm assuming they either ended up here or hopped around like me."
He started out small, testing his limits. He started with a simple Stupefy. When he didn't seem worn out, he moved on to harder spells. Then he just let all his anger out on the poor wall. There were curses, hexes, jinxes, spells and charms going around the room and no one to stop him.
"In that time, Hermione suggested we become friends with Draco since he was trying in best to fix what his father ruined. He actually had to go through the junior program to become a Healer. A year before I became Head, he finally made it to the main program. Me and Draco became friends since a month after the year. It started off as awkward meetings then progressed to me going to his house sobbing one day because it had just hit me what my life had been like up to that point. Then barely two years after the war, we went to each other for help or comfort. I helped him slowly rebuild the Malfoy reputation.
"It's called an Animagus. Pettigrew, Sirius and my dad all became Animagi to help Remus, who was a werewolf. Werewolves don't attack animals like they do humans. Pettigrew was a rat, Sirius was a dog and my dad was a stag. It basically means you transform into that animal. For example, I have two Animagus forms, so does Draco. Teddy only has one since he wasn't on the run with us. My Animagus forms are a lion, like my House animal, and a raven. Draco's are a dragon, a small dragon though, and a snake. Teddy's is a wolf."
"Young warlock, I see you have brought another warlock with you. I suppose you have no clue he is also a Dragonlord."
When Dumbledore said nothing, Harry continued on. He passed Snape, McGonagall, and Moody, using his willpower not to wither under their stares as he made his way to the back room where Cedric, Fleur, and Krum would be waiting.
So, yes, Draco had broken his third and probably most crucial rule. Crucial to surviving, at least. And surviving was beginning to get more difficult, especially when it depended on Draco's ability to murder Hogwart's headmaster.
However, Harry's grin fell when he heard yelling coming from Ron's open office. He came to a halt and peered in, surprised to see Ron, red in the face, arguing loudly with-
He felt Draco nod, and also noticed the mosh pit that used to be his stomach. He knew he had to pull away before he did something stupid, so pull away is what he did. "Who're you taking to the Yule Ball?" He asked, quickly changing the subject.
Harry smirked as he started to understand. "Oh, so this is about you being jealous that I'm close with Ron, is it?"
"Yeah," Draco shrugged, trying to seem nonchalant, but Harry could tell he was nervous. "We act like friends, don't we? I mean you practically
"Who would've thought we'd make such a great team?" Draco winked as he pulled away, but stayed in Harry's arm, his pale face now red.
He ignores her. Because Hermione- well. She knows a lot, that girl. She can tell you what the ten most effective fungus are for potion-making and who took place in the Salem Witch Trials. But. She could not tell you that Harry had been in a relationship with Draco Malfoy since the Yule Ball back in fourth year. She could not tell you that right after their two year anniversary, Draco had ended things.
He had to look away. Harry hated when Draco did that. When he leaned forward. When he smirked lightly. When he arched that
Harry cleared his throat and stepped into the room and caught his breath when Draco turned, looking right at him. His hair fell in the slightly messy way it did back in their fourth and fifth year, but somehow it looked better now that he was older. He had gotten even taller and skinner, his thing body wrapped in a sophisticated black button up that was tucked into gray pants.
Three ginger heads poked into the tent, and harry stood quickly. "It worked, did it?" One of the Weasley twins asked.
Draco let his eyes wander across the apartment he'd become so accustomed to. The Christmas tree in the corner they had put up together and still hadn't taken down. The coat-wrack where all of Draco's cloaks hung (Harry's were thrown on chairs or tables). The photographs on the fridge (which Draco had taken a while to understand) that once were of just the Weasley's and Granger but now were mostly himself and Harry. The candle burning on the counter, causing the place to smell like it's title-
"Plenty of courage, I see," the hat continued, "Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes. And a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?"
"Thanks again, guys, you two are geniuses," Harry walked over and high-fived the twins. He then fist pumped Ron Weasley, who was still smirking at Draco, who was sitting on the floor in his girl clothes, feeling awful inside.
Harry opened his mouth and some hissing noise came from it, getting not only the snake's, but everyone else's attention. Draco's eyes widened when he recognized the sounds as Parseltongue. Well, if they didn't think he was the Heir of Slytherin before, they definitely would. Draco grabbed his friend's hand and pulled him from the room.
Draco ran his thumb over Harry's knuckles for what felt like the thousandth time. They had just escaped the Department of Mysteries, and Harry, overcome with grief from Sirius and exhaustion from fighting and anger at Voldemort, had passed out and has yet to wake up.
So then Harry wonders, based on the times Hermione caught him staring at Draco at the Slytherin table and then smiled to herself, if she actually
This was confirmed when, with his damned long legs, Malfoy caught up to Harry and feel in stride with him. "What are you playing at, Potter?" He narrowed his eyes down at Harry, still suspicious of him. Which, he had every right to be. They regarded each other with insults, and now Harry was actually being
Then he hit thirteen and like every teenager, the hormones started. Only, he wasn't feeling things for Pansy Parkinson or Millicent Bulstrode or Daphne Greengrass. His face would turn red and his heart hammered around Theo Nott, or during his glances at Cedric Diggory in the Great Hall. But, worst of all, everything
As a sixteen year old, it hasn't been very hard to follow these three simple rules. Stupid Granger still gets top marks, but Draco is behind her in every class besides Defense Against the Dark Arts, but he supposes that it's okay to let Potter feel glorified in at least one subject. When he spoke to the other Slytherins, it was either about them or anything other than himself. He was good at keeping the conversation away from himself.
Harry let out a tired and annoyed sigh, and pinched the bridge of his nose for a moment, eyes closed, before looking back at Draco. "No, Draco. I'm Head Auror, I have some authority. They're not keeping you overnight. Now, get up. That is, unless you want to stay here overnight..."
Harry noticed instantly the the bird was shock-still in Draco's hand. Even thought he was unsure of what exactly happened, he knew that the bird was dead. And that by Draco's shaking hands and pale face, this wasn't a good thing.
"Listen, you hate me, right?" Harry raised his eyebrows as they entered the school, and Malfoy said nothing. "Well, you definitely don't
Memories of Draco confiding in him, crying in Harry's arms as he talked about an impossible task that would cost him his life.
Ron, awfully oblivious and awfully hungry Ron, glances up, a forkful of eggs halfway to his mouth, and shoots an eyebrow up in question at Harry's food. The raven haired boy rolls his eyes and gets up, sliding his plate away from him.
Harry thought about it. He'd only heard bad about the Slytherin house, but he didn't think it was fair to judge any of them, especially since he had no clue what they were twenty-four hours earlier. "Any house, I guess. Whatever's best," he said.
"I don't care if you hate this flat, Draco," Harry muttered against Draco's shoulder. "We can buy a new one that you'll love. And I don't care if you hate that mark on your arm. It shows how brave and strong you are. And if that burden is too heavy, I'll carry it for you until you're strong enough to do it. No one else's opinion matters." He pulled his head up, his glasses slightly crooked, and looked Draco straight in the eyes.
. It did something terrifying to Harry's heart. Honestly, he's surprised he hadn't needed to gone to Madam Pomfrey yet.
They were on the outskirts of a run-down and empty town in some off road city far away from London. Harry scrunched his nose and turned, only to face a gas station that looked as though it hadn't served gas in years. The letters were peeling and one employee (a teenager) was sleeping inside. Other than that, there was no one around.
So, taking a deep breath, Harry looked Draco in the eye. "I don't know what you're playing at right now, but I already told you. I don't want some red head
As Harry made his way to the library, he let his thoughts get the best of him. Sure, over the past few weeks, he and Draco had spent everyday together, the old insults turning into playful teases. They had started using each other's first names, albeit strange at first, but it now stuck. Harry had found himself staring at Draco's eyes a lot more, but he couldn't stop. Draco was usually staring right back, anyways, so they would just blush and look away before starting a new topic of conversation.
That could have been Potter. Diggory could have returned, bearing the news that Harry Potter was dead instead of the other way around. And that's when Draco knew.
So, with a burden no sixteen year old should have to carry, he raced to the bathroom, accepting the fact that the defenses he'd worked so hard to build were gone.
Draco winced when Harry said he wanted him, which only made Harry frown more. Draco's gaze hardened. "And I told you,
Nodding, Harry yanked open the door to the library and walked in, not bothering to hold it for Malfoy. They didn't have to be
? Well, that explained it. "Harry, you were speaking a different language," Draco started. "The language of the snakes. The language of You Know Who and Salazar Slytherin himself."
Malfoy, though surprised, just leaned his elbows on the table and said lowly, "Why are you telling me this, Potter?"
Draco put the bird down and closed the doors, leaning his head on them. Then, much to Harry's surprise, he started to cry.
"Draco!" Harry exclaimed, clambering fully out of his bed and walking around the screen covering him. He still wore his champions uniform and his face was grimy and he probably stunk of sweat.
It's the seventh day after Draco ended things with Harry, and Harry thinks that he might turn his wand around and cast
"Alright, boys. As much as we enjoyed the show, we need to get going." Tony spoke into the comm system.
"They're killing themselves..." Okoye whispered while watching the creatures run into the shield trying to get in and killing themselves in the process.
"Don't you realize how idiot that sounded coming from a 38 year old? Do us all a favor and get over yourselves. If not for you, then for your godsons who love each other very much and probably don't want to see part of their only family left get destroyed over petty school fights." She smiled innocently.
Hermione finished writing that down on a spare bit of parchment then looked back up at Merlin. "Thank you, very much, sir."
"He hurt Draco." Harry said quietly, turning back to look at Draco. "Hey, hey, hey, how are you?" He whispered.
"I will. You can also come visit us, you know. You just have to give me a heads up first. Our Veil is on a different planet."
"Snivellus?! Oh, I knew he was a piece of shit. Since he started hanging out with Malfoy and Cousin Bellatrix, I knew he was shit. He called Lily a Mudblood!"
Draco's dragon instantly disappeared, Harry's following shortly after. Draco turned around, trying to locate where the sound came from.
Merlin frowned. That one normally worked. He’d never tried it on a magical being, but it should’ve worked.
Merlin stayed quiet for a bit, just staring at the woman. Merlin was intimidating, he knew that. By seeing if the woman would back down, he would know if she was worthy of the information.
When the group made their way over, they did not expect to see a group of men in chainmail, a woman in a dress that was evident it was worn too much and another man who was barely conscious in the arms of the man in front.
"Yes, well, Harry you should get back to the castle. If you're keeping up the pretense that you're a Lord, the King would most likely want you to stay in the castle."
"'Us'? Who is 'us'?" Severus asked, skipping over the part where he called Black and Potter by their first names.
," Draco whispered. His Patronus was the same dragon as Harrys. Draco slowly opened his eyes and smiled at the full corporal dragon. He had never managed a full corporal wandless Patronus. He had done it with his wand, but now was something even more special.
Once Merlin and Harry entered, Harry started looking around and was amazed at the fact that it reminded him of the potions lab they had at home.
When Harry stepped out of the Veil, he was not expecting to come out of water. When he looked around he realized it was a lake. He cast a drying charm on himself once he was completely out of the water. From what Harry could see around him, he was in some sort of Medieval time period, so his jeans and t-shirt probably wouldn't be the best in this case. He transfigured his clothes into an emerald green tunic and some black trousers. On top of that, he summoned some chainmail and turned his Holly wand into a sword to make it less conspicuous. He stopped casting magic when he heard voices.
He hesitantly knocked on the door, having a feeling he wouldn't open it. "Pietro? It's Scorpius. Can I come in?"
Harry shook his head vehemently, "You need to stay with Scorpius. If I can't figure this out and I get stuck back over there, you need to take care of him."
Harry chose a plain vanilla ice cream while Scorpius chose cookies and cream. Scorpius put basically a mountain of toppings while Harry just put a couple gummy bears and some sprinkles.
This took ages to post, and I apologize for that. I had originally planned to post this, like I said, near the end of May, but I ended up not posting it because I didn't like how I wrote it. I ended up rewriting the whole chapter again. Then, I didn't like a scene I included so I changed it to something else.
"Let him rest. He'll get used to it. It's like... learning how to ride a bicycle. It's hard at first, but the more you do it, the easier it gets."
Tony's eyes widened as he watched him disappear. He turned to the other Avengers as if to ask if they saw the same thing he did.
When she found the book, she picked it out. It had a plain black cover, but it had elegant gold designs swirling the border. In a simple gold font stood the title. It was a rather big book. It had Merlin's full life in it, of course it was going to be big.
"No, I was wondering if I could get one here?" Harry questioned curiously while eating her cookies and cream ice cream.
"And why is that?" He asked interestedly. She just looked around and tapped where her scar was which was hidden by makeup. He somehow understood and motioned her to follow him. She followed him into a room with a table and two chairs.
"Yes," Merry giggled, "And in the future, as you start to realize how talented you are, I believe you can start being a bit more confident with yourself and your abilities."
Harriet showed them to Draco who seemed quite excited, "Thank you, both of you." Riley's smiled widely at her while the edge of Severus's mouth twitched and he nodded at her.
"Yes we can," She giggled. Merry picked out a light purple ribbon and tied it around her neck. The kitten kept gnawing on Merry's fingers as she tied the ribbon. The two girls left to see Merry's mother outside.
"You won this time Potter." Harriet smirked and took a bit out of her apple. The excitement died down quickly which led to the boys talking about Quidditch. Harry looked around the Great Hall some more and let her eyes stop on another pair of eyes that were staring directly at her. Flint. He looked at her lazily and slightly amused. She stared back with the same expression. She examined his face, his nose looked very broken and he definitely had very crooked teeth. He had cheekbones and a jawline to die for. His eyes were as dark as his hair which was very messy on top. His hair was longer on top but shorter on the sides. He also was very tall and muscular, which she noticed from before. Harriet remembered that he was a pureblood from the book she read. His family was known for being dark and followers of Voldemort. He seemed to be examining her also. Maybe it was a Slytherin thing, examine the unknown before doing anything else. They continued their stare off until Merry nudged her arm slightly.
Harry was nibbling on a slice of cheese pizza, Mr. Feose never even heard about pizza. He was very eager to eat muggle food whenever he had the chance. Harry never had pizza either but Dudley absolutely loves it and has it all of the time.
"Well I could have paid for mine," Harry offered. Merry just gave her a look and handed her a chocolate frog. Harry opened it and the frog hopped out and landed on Beetlejuice's head. Beetlejuice shot away and got ready to eat the frog when Harry snatched it away. She put the frog back not wanting Beetlejuice to eat it and get sick. A card fell out onto the floor. She picked up the card, it had a moving picture on it with a description of Albus Dumbledore! That was the person who had her keys! He apparently was very well known and quite popular. Maybe it was a bad idea to take away his keys with all of the ties he had with everyone. But what he didn't know is that she could make more than him because who wouldn't want to be friends with the girl who lived. Harry smirked and bit the frogs head off, this was going to be a fun year.
Harriet tried not to wince at the loud squeaking Winky talked in, "Yes Mistress, right away." The loud pop made Harriet jump once again, she really doesn't like loud noises.
I know that they are young but young kids have crushes so whatever :p Plus I think with her uncle and aunt always hiding things from her so she has very sudden odd feelings and doesn't know how to express them. I hope you enjoyed and sorry for any typos <3 (Hopefully the quidditch game wasn't that boring :p)
"HOLY SHIT!" Merry shouted and took off to get closer to her, "That's better than any seeker I have ever seen! You are a natural at this!"
"So we have 2 more hours," Merry groaned. A knock came from the door again to reveal an older woman with a cart of sweets.
"You will do fine and if you don't," Derek shrugged, "It's your first game, no one will blame you. They will probably blame Marcus for teaching you."
"Neither was I," Harry chuckled. "If that was just the dungeons just imagine what the rest of the castle will be like." Merry let out a breath.
"Violence is not the answer, it's best to ignore him for now but when it gets worse, tell a professor," Cedric advice.
"I'm fine," She breathed out. She straightened her uniform as a way to tell herself she was fine. "Let's go to class now, we don't want to be late for our first class."
If you are reading this we have passed. If our beloved daughter, Harriet Lillian Potter, is still alive we wish for her godfather, Sirius Black to take her. If he is unavailable or deceased Remus Lupin shall take her in. If neither of them are available, please let anyone take her in that is still alive and will treat her well.
"Harriet!" The blond Slytherin in front of her, dressed very elegantly, yelled in excitement. She smiled brightly and waved at him while Merry brushed off any speck of dust or ash off of her body. Cara arrived very shortly behind them, she barely cared about the ash on her, she just smiled at the people in front of her.
"Okay come on, we need to get you to the Great Hall," Merry grabbed her bag and walked towards the door.
"So he just made you the new seeker?" Merry could not believe it. The girls were all laying in their beds talking about Harriet's new position.
Cedric was torn but easily submitted, "Of course not, I will help you." With that the trio was off trying to save the troll.
"I know, I felt it and it wasn't even directed at me!" Merry giggled back. The upper years near them congratulated her and welcomed her to Slytherin. 2 more students went into Gryffindor, Ron Weasley who was the kid with the dirt still on his nose and Dean Thomas. Also, another student got on into Slytherin, Blaise Zabini. He winked at her as he sat down near her. The Headmaster gave a speech which made Harry question his sanity. When he finished his speech, the tables filled with food. Harry gaped at the food and piled her plates with roast beef, potatoes, and green beans. She ate until she couldn't anymore.
"But no need to worry, we don't teach those types of lessons anymore," Riley reassured them. A few students came down from their dorms which interrupted their conversation. It was some random girls that seemed a few years older than them.
"Hey it's time to go back in, dinner starts in 15 minutes!" Daphne yelled at the scattered students who were all looking at something different in a field. They all raced each other to the Great Hall laughing.
"Well I want to go see the library but it's fine if you guys don't want to. We can do whatever," She looked at the ground shyly.
"Next time, don't be selfish." With that, her Aunt slammed the door in her face and locked the door. Harriet cried softly in the hallway, too scared to go back to her little room. It was quite lonely in there, there was only a small bed with a few torn and thin blankets. Harriet curled up into a ball, hiding her face in her knees sobbing. She couldn't get the lady's red hair and the loud noise out of her mind. She soon fell asleep with a thought of hoping that the lady was alright. The next morning she woke up to her Aunt screaming.
"I will," She nodded to him as Draco gushed over the potions in the book. The adults then unwrapped their few presents, Riley got sweaters and sweets while Severus got novels and transfiguration books. Narcissa got a stunning necklace from Lucius which she kissed him for, Cara got a few warm robes also. Lucius received novels along with a glass figurene to add to his collection. The rest of the day resulted in Harriet curling up in her warm blanket while reading a dystopian novel that she got from Cara and Draco trying on his new clothes, he was very excited for how thick they were. Merry played with her jewelry and makeup while eating sweets, they watched muggle movies in Draco's room until nightfall came. Merry was very close to hitting Draco upside the head for how much he kept interrupting the movies with normal logic.
"There was a dark and powerful wizard, he started a revolution between the light and the dark. In the Ministry, there are 3 political stances the light, the gray, and the dark. The light wants more muggle influence like technology and they are complete pacifists. The dark wants to keep pureblood traditions and think that dark magic should be allowed. The gray is basically in-between when dealing with muggle uses and pureblood traditions. Obviously, there is more to that but that is the majority of it. The Ministry was taking the lights side by giving the muggleborns more rights than the purebloods. And well you know what muggleborn and pureblood mean," Mr. Feose stopped to take a drink of soda which he still is not used to drinking.
"I will miss you too but I will always be at my shop for you to come and see. I will always be here for you," He kissed her forehead. Harry just hugged him tighter.
"Sweet Merlin, could you have made it any tighter?" Harriet complained and turned around to see Merry with a straight face.
"What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?" Snape really was hard to look through, well being in Slytherin for so many years he must know how to hide his emotions well.
"There is something I also want to tell you or rather show you," Harry flinched at the show you part, she heard that before and it never ended well. He got up and grabbed a scroll with lots of dust on it. He handed it to her and said, "This is too soon I know but I feel like you should know about it." She slowly unraveled it in her lap. The writing was large and rushed.
