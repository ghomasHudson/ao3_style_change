Harry took pity on him and pulled him down into a rough kiss. He shoved his tongue into Draco's mouth, sucking on the other's tongue like he'd wanted to earlier. He'd let his pet come before him, just this once. A finger curled around his collar. The other hand he used as leverage to bring Draco's hips down against his, hard and fast. He twisted his hips up as he pulled Draco down. His pet pulled back from the breathless kiss and let out a broken keen against his lips at the blinding thrusts.
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead and guided him to the bed. They situated themselves, Draco leaning against the headboard with Harry sitting on his lap bridle style.
Draco was instantly greeted with Mrs Potter's glittering smile which only seemed to grow once her eyes landed on him.
"Hermione, she um-she and Parkinson, they…they were-" Ron let out a frustrated sound and then quickly blurted, "Hermione cheated on me!"
Draco shut his eyes and tried to block out his invasive thoughts. He focused on Dudley's voice and took a few deep, slow breaths like he was saying.
"Now, didn't you say something about biscuits, Draco?" Theo asked waggling his eyebrows at him. His notorious sweet tooth making Draco shake his head in fond exasperation.
“Bloody hell, Harry!” Draco shouted, jumping at the loud crash behind him. He turned around, quick as a whip, ready to snap at his boyfriend for being so careless, prepared to wave the spoon in his hand around disapprovingly when he stopped short.
His pet was clothed in nothing, but a piece of dark red silk tied around his slim waist. It fell to his mid-thigh providing him with the mere semblance of modesty. The golden circlet with a single ruby hanging from its center resting on his temple named him Prince Consort and the golden collar studded with diamonds and rubies wrapped around his soft neck claimed him as Harry’s. The rest of his lithe frame was bare, unblemished, and pale as the moon. He looked utterly ravishing. Delectable, even. And Harry wanted nothing more than to toss his pretty little pet over his shoulder and take him to bed. Unfortunately, he had matters to attend to if his pacing advisor was any indication.
Harry's eyes are so beautiful. Draco hasn't seen anything green and living in so long not since the Death Eaters had come to Hogwarts and scorched the surrounding lands. They remind him of the grass in the spring and the leaves on the big oak trees in the summer, of emeralds and pine. They remind him of something soft and comfortable and safe. They remind him of Harry and how much he shouldn't and can't love him right now. Not without having to kill little pieces of himself for hurting someone so good and beautiful and kind with his dirty and foul being.
He dragged his way from the kitchen to his bedroom and grabbed his cell to message- he didn't know who. Pansy? No, she would go into a full rage and
"So, Harry is it? What do you want from me?" Draco asked, leaning against the door as a way to block his dad's view of them.
He spotted his shoes in the corner of the room and gestured towards them. Harry took the hint grabbing them as Draco sat back down on the bed.
Pansy kissed his cheeks too, then tossed her bags in the back seat and settled herself in the passenger's side. She greeted Anna the same way before they drove off.
Harry pouted. Just as Draco went to bribe Harry with some other incentive, Fred stumbled through the fireplace and knocked them to the floor. Harry twisting his body in a last-ditch effort not to crush Draco, who in turn landed on top of Harry’s chest, his hands fisted into his shirt and legs naturally coming up to straddle his hips.
him. Draco could feel the need to scrub his skin raw already. He hated this. He couldn't even muster up the courage to tell Theodore off as he had with Harry.
He groaned, throwing his head back in such a dramatic fashion that Draco would've applauded had he been there to see it. But he wasn't. In fact, he was the only one missing from the tight-knit group piled into their usual compartment on the Hogwarts Express.
Laughter swirled in the room and they all ended up sprawled all along the floor, their heads resting together, making a circle. They stared at Draco's ceiling, a happy feeling floating in the air after the impromptu tickle assault.
"You do realize, I bought this on my salary, Pans?" He said, rummaging through one of the boxes labelled kitchen to find his kettle, mugs, and some tea.
"You-I really like your laugh. You shouldn't try to smother it." Harry said quietly, peering at him with a shy little smile.
With a few wordless spells, that he had no idea he was capable of using, he forcefully shoved Lucius against a wall, flicked his wand out of his grip, and had the vines wrap around him keeping him firmly in place.
By the time Draco entered their bedroom, Harry was obediently kneeling by the foot of their bed, facing the door, and completely naked. Harry's head was bowed in submission and he held a wooden paddle in his hands, the one they always used for punishment. His clothes sat neatly folded on the chest at the foot of the bed, his round glasses perched on top.
"I understand. My biological father was the same. I don't remember much but he did give me this, that's difficult to forget." Draco said, his voice wavering as he moved a shaky hand to brush his fringe off of his forehead to reveal a thin, long, and impossibly white scar just underneath where his hairline began. He'd never really told anyone about it save for his parent's. He didn't know why he'd felt comfortable enough to mention it to Dudley it was so unlike him but then this boy understood what it was like to deal with such nasty business. And his biological father
Draco and Pansy had arranged for two of Harry's old school mates to meet them there. Harry had shown Draco a photo of all three of them in his 4th year just before they'd graduated and he'd told him about how he regretted losing touch with them once school had ended. So, being the amazing boyfriend he was, Draco snapped a photo of the picture and sent it to Pansy with their names asking her to help find them. Pansy then hired a private investigator, a little over the top if you asked Draco, and made quick work of finding Hermione Jean Granger and Ronald Billius Weasley.
"Draco, the police are on their way and the arsehole is locked out. Blaise sent me in to tell you that we need pictures if his mother is going to be able to convict the fucker banging on your door," She said as she shut the door on the sound of yelling and loud thuds, "He thought Harry would be more comfortable with me than another man in the room."
Another silence passed over them as Draco stared off in a daze and Harry stroked his legs absentmindedly.
? This was both unsettling and unbelievable. Hermione had never shown the slightest bit of interest in women before let alone gotten along with Parkinson of all people.
"I love you Pans, you too Blaise. Thank you." Draco said placing a kiss on both of his friends' cheeks. He leant against Blaise and held onto Pansy's hand firmly as he dove into all the horrid feelings and thoughts he'd been having ever since Nott had harassed him.
A loud crash, one that sounded an awful lot like glass shattering, cut Draco off from finishing his statement. The sound had come from the flat above his and he drew his eyebrows up in confusion, then shrugged. Someone had most likely just dropped something, it was fine.
"Mother, I love you but I cannot stay here. I can't. If you wish to see me, I'll be staying at Harry's. All you have to do is owl me." Draco said with a sigh.
He pressed the tip of his wand further into his neck, if it had been a knife it would have more than drawn blood, and leant in leaving them nearly nose to nose, his voice dangerously low as he continued, "Draco is a
"Don't give me that look, Dragon. Me and your father agreed it would be good for you to get out." Papá said, giving Draco the '
“You saw me this morning, you impossibly sappy man. And I’ll let you ‘take care of me’ as you put it, later when we get home. Yes?”
"We've missed you, mate," Ronald added rubbing his neck awkwardly as Harry kept staring at them open-mouthed and wide-eyed.
When he finally pulled his eyes away from Harry, he was met with identical shit-eating grins from their friends.
training. And even if he can't look at his hands right now without losing his manufactured calm he knows they're still hanging by his sides, trembling. The hands burn a trail up his neck, brushing calloused thumbs under his jaw, trailing them up and over his cheekbones till they're cupping his face softly.
"I-" He huffed out an awkward little laugh, "I guess so. I think I'd rather regret a compliment than not having said anything."
No more than a few minutes later, Hermione stumbled into the flat just as Draco assumed she would. She looked manic. Her hair strewn everywhere, eyes smudged with tear stains and mascara. Her clothes looked out of sorts like she'd pulled them off of the floor wrinkles and all. And Draco supposed she had. He supposed the only reason she'd taken this long to arrive was due to handling Pansy after Ron caught them in their bed together. What an awful thing.
"What was that?" He asked, running a hand through Theo's hair. Draco nudged Pansy off of him, who went with a grumble and stood up, looking for his slippers.
Fury coursed its way through Sirius body as he processed his son's words. He pulled Draco's arm off of his face and pulled him out of Remus' lap so they were eye to eye. Piercing eyes focused on Draco as he spoke.
Draco nodded and chewed on his bottom lip, looking at anything but Harry. He really didn't want to ask. But he had to know what happened. He tapped his fingers along the glass of water watching it ripple and finally mustered up the words.
Draco let out a huff and glared up at her annoyingly tall and elaborately decorated ceiling. It was covered in magical paintings of the sky which changed depending on the time of day and weather outside. He watched as the sun glided off to the corner and the moon replaced it, it was beginning to get later than he had planned to stay, but he wasn’t quite finished yet.
"Promise?" Draco asked with a watery smile as he stared into Harry's eyes. Merlin! Draco's eyes were gorgeous.
Draco let out another earth-shattering sob and wrapped his arms around her. He loved Harry's mother almost as much as he loved his own. And he really needed the physical comforts his family lacked. Everything
"God, I am so sorry, Luna! I never meant to-you know I didn't mean- I would never-he was just so-bloody hell, I'm sorry." Draco seemed to cut himself off with every start of a sentence and Harry felt like he was imposing on some kind of personal matter as he listened.
Draco sank down hungrily on Harry's cock and let out a wail of pleasure. He allowed his pet to thrust his hips down almost violently. He rode Harry like a professional horse racer; quickly chasing Harry's relief as well as his own, arms tightly wrapped around his broad shoulders.
"You go to Hogwarts with a mate of mine, Ron, Ron Weasley," Harry said and Draco noticed the way his hands fidgeted as he spoke, he was nervous. Interesting.
"Please, d-don't leave me alone," Harry whispered, looking at him with those brilliant green eyes, shiny with tears. Draco's heart ached at the sight.
"I wish you hadn't done this, Draco. I wish you didn't have to watch so many die by their hands. I wish you never had to get this," Harry traces his fingers along the inside of Draco’s left wrist.
"Sorry," Draco whispers against his lips, brings his hands up, and strokes the sides of Harry's face to remind himself of where he is, "I'm wasting time. But, he didn't deserve
"If I was going to fall in love with anyone, I'm glad it was you," Draco whispered softly, nuzzling his hair.
"Sorry, er, Luna's my cousin. I haven't spoken with her in...a while. I hadn't realized this was where she had moved last year."
"I ah, yeah, it does sound like a good idea. I just, I don't think I know all of the things that might trigger me. It's only been a little while since...well since I've had to..."
He tried to avoid tugging at his jumpers already worn sleeves or chewing on his chapped lips. And politely declined Harry and thems offer to play football, settling for watching instead. He really just needed the peace of being alone for a while, only that wasn't what happened.
like to pull on her hair right about now or ruin her nails, anything to wipe that look off of her face. It would be so satisfying.
Draco watched as she went stoic and stiff, her relaxed posture turning rigid, her lips pressed into a thin line and fingers twitching at her side. It gave him a small pang of satisfaction. He knew it bothered her. Being called out for what she was, what she did. But she wouldn’t deny it. Despite what she had done, denial of it was beneath her and they both knew it. It was tasteless to pretend what he said wasn’t true. A fact that would bother her in and of itself.
"Hmm, I don't think I've ever met someone quite like you before, Harry. It's...refreshing." Draco hummed, folding his hands in front of him. They stared at each other for a moment. Silence filling the air as they studied one another. Harry couldn't help but to think he'd never met anyone quite like Draco either.
"What on earth were you thinking!" Remus hissed quietly, releasing him and folding his arms over his chest. His eyes flashed angrily and he let out a disbelieving huff of air. And the only thing Sirius could manage to do was look at him with sullen eyes. Remus shook his head and his frown deepened with the silence he received in return.
"You'd make it for me anyway," Harry said smugly, then he stood up and went to rifle through his drawers for something to wear.
"We weren't careful enough, Goldstein and I, and my father found out through one of his coworker's children. The bugger sent my father a photo of us snogging in the library." Draco let out a stilted laugh and shook his head. He sucked in a deep breath and set his cup down as Harry studied his face, which he pointedly ignored.
the second he turned a corner. Bloody hell, he should never have agreed to come here, it was all too much, too soon. Especially seeing Luna. He felt like he had done something
"Harry," She said imploringly, as their food and drinks hovered over. He took a drink of his tea and a deep breath.
"I'll introduce you to everyone," Harry said throwing an arm around him which was immediately thrown back off.
"One song, then I need to go f-find," Draco stuttered a little as Theodore pulled him roughly closer, "m-my friend."
"Yes, they do. As do you. We all deserve better than this war. And you aren't wasting anything, we've got all night."
"Watch the paintings, if you break them, Seamus, my mother will have our heads." He hollered over his shoulder seeing his friends tossing around a ball. They waved him off and he grinned, shaking his head in response.
Harry and Ron sputtered simultaneously. Ron dropped a hand on top of his head, "I've been complaining about you both to Luna for the past week." He muttered, giving Harry a mortified look. Usually, Harry would've snickered, only his best mate could manage to do something like that, but he was busy staring at Luna and Draco.
. I am not your boy, despite whatever predisposed notions you may have of me because of my father's familiarity towards you."
Harry's even breaths stutter at the sudden contact but he held steady, trying his hardest not to flinch away. He deserved every hit, he knew he did.
"Don't look at me, mate. I've been waiting for you to snog Malfoy since fifth year. Not sure why you didn't when he was busy confessing his undying love for you." Ron snorted, shaking his head unapologetically.
Pansy broke off into silent tears and stood up smoothing her skirt down, her shirt, her hair. He hated when she cried, she did it so rarely that when she did cry it felt like the world was ending. And right now it was his fault. Draco stared helplessly after her and he bit down on an apology he knew she wouldn't appreciate.
"This does not concern the likes of you," he said, harshly shoving Harry to the ground with a swipe of his cane. Harry let out a growl at the words, blood boiling viciously. Draco
A gut-wrenching sob left his mouth and he would have collapsed if it hadn't been for Mrs Potter. She wrapped an arm around him and pulled him inside the house.
And a small part of Draco still wonders why Harry lets him --the monster, the Death Eater, the coward-- touch him, the sun, the Savior, the brave.
"Er, yes, sorry Pansy. I think I'm going to have to call you back." Draco sighed, as he pressed the button next to the lift.
"Merlin, Hermione. How could you-I don't-Merlin," Harry sighed running his fingers through his hair. He didn't know how he was supposed to deal with this. He knew Hermione was in the wrong but he couldn't crucify her for her actions without knowing how and why it had happened. That, however, did not stop him from feeling burning rage for what she had done to Ron. This was so frustrating.
go eat?" Ron said with a longing look in his eye when he mentioned food. Harry shook his head at Ron and grinned.
"Yes, love?" Draco asked as he finished buttoning up his shirt and turned to face his boyfriend of three months. Harry gave him a coy smile, his pretty green eyes, something Draco could never get enough of, full of mischief. He grabbed Draco's hand tugging him down till their faces were mere inches from each other.
Draco's suffocating doubt and hostility seemed to wither under those words. He let out a breath of frustration and maybe just a little bit in relief. He supposed he was still a bit techy about everything. He really needed another appointment with his counsellor and soon.
"Ah," Draco hissed his hands flying forward and tangling in Harry's shirt and hair, "please, your majesty! Punish me if you must, but, please, stop teasing!"
Still, Draco sat there on his knees cradling and rocking a bleeding and sobbing man for what felt like hours until Ron was reduced to nothing but quiet sniffles.
Harry did not doubt that Lucius stared horrified as Draco leant down and kissed him square on the mouth. The ferocity behind the kiss left butterflies swirling in Harry's stomach after he pulled away. He truly was head over heels for this boy.
“Talk to him. Don’t worry about heading up to bed with me, hmm, I’ll be fine. We have the rest of our lives to cuddle and comfort each other, he needs you right now.”
Draco let out an exasperated laugh and crashed his lips down on Harry's to shut him up. He snogged the living daylights out of him before pulling back, leaving a dazed look on his face.
Draco couldn't be bothered to care and only nodded, quickly shutting the bathroom door with trembling hands.
Draco laughs again but it comes out more of a wet sob than anything else. He keeps his eyes closed,  it makes talking easier. The feeling of Harry's skin against his own urges him to continue.
He felt the rumble of words coming from the person's chest and he tried his best to calm his breathing down. The hard touch seemed to ground him to the present and after a few minutes, he managed to match his breathing to the other's.
One moment Harry's fury was rising steadily with each word that the lord spoke aloud and the next Pettigrew fell silent and crumpled to his knees with a resounding thud that echoed in the nearly empty throne room.
Draco cringed at the words but Blaise only smiled wryly. He tugged Draco against his side and pulled them both down into the grass of his front yard. It probably wouldn't be long till Isaac got there, he always was impeccable with arriving on time, they might as well spend what they had left outside. The blonde sat cross-legged beside him and laced their fingers together.
"The things you do to me, Harry James Potter." Draco sighed over dramatically pulling a laugh from Harry as he went to make tea.
"Alright, spill. You've been all," Pansy made a face and vaguely gestured at Draco, who flopped down on his bed throwing an arm over his face dramatically, "like
Draco stood silently and his frown deepened. He knew how much the war still affected his lover even after it had ended four years ago. The minute the name Sirius had tumbled from Harry's lips, Draco realized why he'd been so off that day. It was the sixth year anniversary of when Sirius had been killed. The guilt of having forgotten such a stressful time for his boyfriend made his heart well with sadness and regret, he really wished Harry had told him sooner or that he had remembered.
One shaky breath later and Draco found the courage to knock on the door. He could do this. It was fine.
Harry looks at him firmly, fiercely, locks him in with a determined glint in his green eyes. He pulls each of Draco’s hands to his lips, one at a time, and kisses his palms, his fingertips, the back of his hands, his wrists. Each press of his lips makes Draco gasp and cry like he's in pain. Maybe he is, he can't tell anymore. Harry does it with delicate care like he hadn't just washed blood off of them, like they hadn't just done foul, nasty, unforgivable things.
"Of course not. How could I ever be cross with you for protecting me, pet? Besides, I never liked the man, he was a rat for sure."
"Harry, dear," Draco called, giving him concerned eyes, "Would you please, get a pair of pyjamas for Ron? I think some of mine will fit. Oh, and cast a few freshening up charms on the guest bed, please."
Ron smiled at him sympathetically and pat him on the shoulder, a large contrast from the angry boy he had been moments ago.
"Come on, my darling. My sweet love, my Draco. I need you to come back to me." He whispers it like if he says it any louder it will break him. And maybe it would. Draco knows when he goes blank like this it hurts him. He remembers how his pain hurts Draco in return. He doesn't want to feel that. Can't even bring himself to think his name, that might bring all of his walls crumbling down without his permission.
"I simply want you to know that you're always welcome to come over. You can stay for a couple of hours if you need to get out of here for a while. You can come over if you need a friend or you want to talk about this, or anything, really."
actually helped. Pansy and Blaise plus his parents were the only other's who had ever managed to calm him down before.
nasty business. The distant memory of slurred shouting, loud crashes and a silver and black cane coming down quickly, making him see stars flashed through his mind. Gods, he shouldn't have mentioned it.
Harry frowns at the action but doesn't stop him. Instead, he rests his hands over top Draco's again. He strokes the back of his hands. He says nothing as Draco shuts his eyes and learns to breathe again. And when he's finally caught his breath, Harry speaks. His voice is tender and sweet, his eyes no doubt the same.
"Here," Harry handed Draco a glass of water his mom had brought in on a tray of snacks earlier. The blonde took the glass gratefully and sipped some of the water.
Draco was cut off by a loud squeak leaving his mouth. Blaise had jumping up quickly startling him before physically lifting the blonde's small frame and easily throwing him over his shoulder. Bloody rugby players with their brute strength!
"We are leaving," Lucius announced pulling his son along. Harry looked up from his position on the ground and was seriously debating on whether or not he should just charge at the bloody git who dared harm Draco in his presence. It was, after all, a very tempting idea. But, being the wise person he was, he thought better of it and remained silent. He knew this was something Draco had to do alone. He knew his boyfriend was stronger and braver than anyone gave him credit for. He could do this.
"No, sure, of course. I-sorry-I'll be in the kitchen then." Harry tried for a nonchalant smile but it only served to look forced and wrong.
. We are not doing this again, Draco. Believe you me, this will not turn into a situation like before-"
"I know, I know, it'll be alright." Remus shushed him, pressing soft kisses to his mouth and wiping tears from his face he hadn't noticed yet.
"Fine, then do not speak unless it's to apologize." Draco coldly said releasing Harry's chin and grabbing the paddle from his hands. He stood up straight once more and ordered Harry to get into position.
"Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stay here, love." Draco sighed heavily, sitting next to Harry and wrapping an arm around him. He really wished Harry would let him fix the little cuts on his face and his bleeding lip but if this is what he wanted, Draco wouldn't take that from him. He couldn't bear the thought of Harry feeling more unsafe than he already did.
"Oh, love," Blaise said softly, pulling Draco into his side and stroking his hair in that way Blaise always did when he was upset. Ever since they were younger, Blaise had always been the one to bring Draco back from a breakdown. Things hadn't changed all that much over the years. And despite feeling ridiculous for sobbing into Blaise's jumper Draco still held onto him tightly.
Before she had a chance to finish Ron apparated to the first place he could think of, not caring whether or not he got splinched in the process.
Harry went and grabbed the bottle along with two glasses. He poured generous amounts of the liquor for them both and then came back to sit on the sofa. Harry handed Ron a glass and watched as he took a large gulp of the burning liquid, downing half the glass, before coughing roughly after.
Sirius watched as his son brushed his hands off of his face and squirmed his way between Remus and him, throwing his legs into his lap and his head into his fathers.
The ferocity in his voice startled him a little, but he held Hermione firmly and stared her down harshly anyway.
"You are all the family I could ever want or ask for and if you want children we could adopt, I don't care as long as I have you. You, Draco, are my heart, my world, my everything, and more. Never think otherwise."
Draco pulled the robes off of Ron's shoulders and guided him to the sofa, pressing the steaming cup of tea into his hands and placing a box of tissues next to him. He went and hung up Ron's robes in the hall closet, then swiped his wand from the kitchen before coming back to the sitting room. Draco sat beside him tugging Ron's injured hand into his lap, then he professionally cast a few healing and cleaning charms, mending the split knuckles till they looked good as new. He wasn't the Head Healer at St. Mungo's for nothing.
"Watch your tongue, Pettigrew!" Harry growled his hand falling away from Draco's hair and clenching around the arms of his throne instead. He did not take kindly to such foul words being spoken of his pet. The man ignored him and pressed on carelessly, his beady eyes holding Harry's green ones in a desperate stare.
A long silence passed between the pair, nothing but the muggle televisions blue screen keeping them company in the dark.
Harry, he's-he helped me. It was some other guy." Draco said quickly, as he latched onto Siruis' arm to stop him from doing anything drastic. He gave his son a look and continued using a plethora of hand gestures to show his disapproval of all of this.
Harry glanced at the perfect smile Blaise gave him, then scoffed and looked away, his arms crossed against his chest like a petulant child. Draco's back tensed, his eyes reflecting something of danger behind them at hearing Harry's words or lack thereof and he sat up a little straighter. He was the epitome of grace and collectiveness, even as his long-time boyfriend acted like a complete prat to his best mate and he kept his composure. Instead of making a scene in front of their guest he simply and silently put his hand on Harry's thigh and squeezed. The simple gesture didn't go unnoticed by Harry and he knew he was going to get it from Draco later.
"I hate this," Draco whispered, leaning back in his chair and shutting his eyes. "I wish I didn't care so much."
Draco twisted his face into a scowl, Sirius knew he hated it when he called him by his actual name instead of Dragon. It made everything seem
"Why-why would I hate you for what Hermione did?" Harry finally asked, pulling Ron into his side and hugging him tightly, "This wasn't your fault. You couldn't have known, and she shouldn't have done it. I'm sorry, Ron. You didn't deserve that."
Draco wanted the floor to open up and devour him whole if it meant getting away from her harsh glare or Blaise's look of concern as he saw the damage.
"Hello, what can I do for you, dear?" Remus asked, upon finding a boy around the same age as his Draco at the door. He was dressed nice enough, with a button-up and a dark pair of jeans. Remus also took note of how tall he was and the messy black hair paired with striking green eyes.
“George, Fred, how’s it?” He said casually. Draco let out a shrill sound of disapproval and harmlessly smacked at Harry’s chest. This was mortifying and Harry was definitely going to get an earful later.
He only seemed to cry harder at that but this time Harry thought it might've been in relief. One thing he did know, however, was that as much as he had hoped this issue could be resolved, it looked as though it wasn't an option. Harry had a feeling that Ron and Hermione didn't stand a chance against this.
But he won't let him, won't let him get more than a few centimetres away. Grabs his wrists to stop him from leaving, till he's stuck straddling him, wrists clutched into hot palms.
"I love you, Harry." He mumbled half asleep from all the exhausting emotions he'd gone through today.
and she knew how to make me feel better. I never meant for…" Hermione took in a choked breath of air, and a waitress interrupted her right as she went to speak again.
"I know. It's alright." Luna said lightly, finally releasing Draco, and rubbing her hands up and down his arms comfortingly. "I know, Dray."
He unceremoniously dumped Harry's things all over the ground and huffed out a sound of irritation before poking Harry in the shoulder roughly.
Can see it when he shuts his eyes or if he blinks too quickly. Can feel it under his nails, and between his fingers like it has sunken into his pores. Like it has become a
. Draco cringed as the bitter thought ran through his head. He knew it wasn't how Blaise meant it. He was only feeling irritated because Potter had decided to come and play hero, ruining their fun.
Draco walked up next to Harry, wrapping an arm around his waist. He shook hands with Ronald and Hermione with a smile, hoping to break him out of his trance.
"Not a word, if I'm not allowed to go after and murder this Nott-boy, then I'm allowed to do this." She tutted continuing to coat his fingernails with careful and meticulous brush strokes. At least he knew it would look nice afterwards.
Shouting came next, followed by a door slamming loudly, another thud and then what sounded like crying. The fact that all of these sounds were filtering through Draco's ceiling made it finally click for him. It was Harry's flat again. Bloody hell.
Draco nodded dumbly and he hated himself a little for the tears pressing against his eyes. Why did he have to have so many bloody feelings all of the time?
you." He spat, his face mere inches away from the older man. It was a threat and it came out in a cold and detached tone. He barely contained his urge to curse the old man with something foul and unforgivable. No one was allowed to lay a hand on Draco like that. No one. Not even his loathsome father.
"Here try this," Theodore shoved a cup to his lips and nearly caused Draco to choke on the drink he'd all but poured down his throat.
They'd been playing Risk for the better part of an hour and Pansy had wiped both Blaise and Draco off of the board, leaving Theo to handle her assault. The distraction of it all was making Draco feel marginally better, not to mention the shots they'd taken earlier.
"Hi, welcome back," Harry smiled softly, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he did so. Draco took a few more deep breaths to try and steady his trembling. It didn't help as shivers crawled up and down his back, but the fact that he
The word slipped from his mouth sounding dazed and confused before he had time to correct it. The boy grinned charmingly and offered his hand again with another gesture.
"They...I was supposed to be their nephew, but instead, I was sort of like their house elf. They used-used to make me do all sorts of work, the cooking and cleaning usually. If I...if I ever um burned the food or broke a-a dish, they'd yell and they'd-they'd h-hit me or-or..."
Anger swirled in his stomach and he wanted to hate her for it. Couldn’t she simply go off and find some foreign rich man or woman that none of them knew who would dote on her endlessly instead? She hadn’t even
"Hey, we're alright. Just breathe, Draco. You're okay, safe." Dudley soothed and it was then when Draco noticed how stuttered his breathing had become and how shaky he felt. Dudley's voice was pitched lower than expected but he continued to whisper comforting nonsense as Draco desperately tried to cling to reality. He shouldn't have brought up his biological father. It always triggered the most random reactions and usually let the thought that he was somehow predisposed to love abusive arseholes worm itself into his head. Like he somehow deserved it in some twisted way for having been related to one.
"You are my sweet love, my gorgeous pet, my beautiful, clever, and cunning husband. You are my secret keeper, the one who has saved me from myself and others more times than I can count, the one I trust most."
"What's the matter, Cub?" Remus asked quietly, and Sirius was grateful for it. He didn't think he would be able to speak without panic seeping into his words. Sirius could practically feel his nerves jumping out of his body. He was terrified to find out what had happened to his son.
"His name's Draco-something. He's quiet, bookish, think he's on the swim team? I reckon he and Mione'd get on if he ever put his books down long enough to speak." Ron said, shrugging lightly. He'd known Harry for years and had since become accustomed to his fixations on the people he fancied, boys and girls alike. That and he really wanted the food Harry had promised him earlier.
Ron shoved his face into Blaise's shirt, using his boyfriend's shoulder to muffle his laughter whereas Blaise did nothing to smother his blatant snickering. Pansy and Hermione settled for exchanging a knowing look before rolling their eyes simultaneously.
"My love, my sweet pet, have we not talked about this, hmm?" Harry mused a faux stern expression on his face as Draco gazed back at him. His pet tilted his head to the side, raising a pale eyebrow in question, and dragged his tongue along his bottom lip. The movement made Harry want to suck on it.
He smoothes out the wrinkles in between Harry's brows with a swipe of his thumb. And places a kiss there too. He hates to see him so exhausted with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He should have noticed sooner.
Harry shook his head frantically. He looked horrified like he might be sick. Draco couldn't help but feel the same.
By the time he stops, Draco has his eyes twisted shut painfully. He can't watch as Harry worships hands that have torn people's,
Ron took in a sharp breath, pulling his previously bloody hand in front of his face and flexing his fingers a couple of times. Malfoy was a bloody good healer, he thought.
“Yes, well, there’s nothing to be done,” Draco sighed, then an impossibly girlish gasp left his mouth, one he would deny if ever mentioned, as Harry grazed his teeth against the juncture where his shoulder and neck met, “Harry, would you quit, anyone could walk in!”
And with that Draco pulled Harry in for a hot kiss, his hands cupping Harry's face with soft fingers.
me, Pans, not while I am this close to hexing you.” He snapped as he fixed her with a cold look and stopped pacing. The words silenced her enough for him to try and collect his thoughts. He stood facing her, hands on his hips as he shook his head in near disbelief, only that was the issue. He
And with that he padded out of the room and towards their bedroom, leaving Harry to finally hear the story of what had happened.
Sometimes Draco wonders why he lets him touch him. How he can stand the sight of him. How it doesn't make him want to throw every
"S'alright, not your fault. Want to tell me what actually happened? I know you never hurt any of them, I know it's never you. Tell me what they made you watch."
That would be damaging and if he isn't careful it could rip a hole into his mind and leave him in a not all there sort of limbo. Although there has to be some sort of freedom in delusion and insanity, at least then he wouldn't remember. But then he recalls Longbottom's parents and the way they can't even feed themselves and he decides maybe that isn't the way to go.
"Quit squirming or you'll make me get the polish on your sleeve." Pansy sighed as she went and tugged Draco's left sleeve up. Draco went to pull away from her but she simply held fast and pulled his sleeve up above his forearm.
Lucius pulled Draco harshly towards him, little beads of blood surfacing as he tore Draco's delicate skin in the process. And Harry's fury only seemed to grow at his actions. Who cared if Lucius smacked him around and threw slurs at him, but how dare he touch Draco like that! How dare he dig his nails into his arm so painfully that it left blood trickling down onto the cobblestone floor. Harry could see nothing but red as he grit his teeth.
Draco shut his eyes firmly, a few tears rolling down his face. The numbness had faded the second Harry's house came into view and his sadness came crashing down on him in waves. All he wanted to do was break down right there on the porch and fall apart.
"Don't worry, if worse comes to worst, we can always be roommates," Draco suggested, holding in a giggle at the idea of seeing Pansy with bed head. He couldn't imagine it, her looking anything but pristine.
"Sorry?" Draco replied, recognizing the voice as this so-called 'Uncle Vernon' and only mildly shocked by the amount of aggression expressed in one word.
"I never thought she'd-" Draco began but found his words dying on his lips. He couldn't process this. He'd hate to imagine how Ron was taking it.
"Try and match my breathing. You are safe here. No one is going to hurt you. Feel how I'm breathing. You are right here, right now, and you are okay."
"I'm sorry," Draco whispers back, he's stopped crying now. He's ashamed. He always is after he's had an episode like this. He can't help it no matter how delicate and kind and sweetly Harry handles them.
“My, my, you truly are upset over this. I don’t recall when you and the Weasel became so close that you’d defend his honour. How positively Hufflepuff of you, darling.” She said a mocking smirk pasted to her lips, it made Draco’s stomach roll. The way she said weasel reminded him too much of their youth to be comfortable. He’d
Harry whipped his head back to face the doorway. He'd recognize that voice anywhere because it was distinctly peppered with a soft French lilt, though he'd never admit it.
did." Harry had to take a breath to ease the cold bitterness seeping into his voice and continued, "Lord, Hermione what were you thinking? How could you do that to him?"
Harry had to stomp down the anger bubbling in his chest in exchange for comforting his beautiful love. He'd never wanted to kill a dead man more than he did right then. No one should've been allowed to make his lovely pet doubt himself so. The sad smile gracing Draco's lips should never have even been possible. He should have dealt with Pettigrew sooner. He should have cut his tongue out the first time he'd
"Wait, wait, wait! Hold it right there, boys! Do not move." Pansy ordered throwing her hand up in a 'stop' gesture. Blaise and Theo froze, holding the painting at an awkward and uncomfortable angle as she picked apart whether or not she approved of hanging it there. This was the fifth time she had done this.
"Just as well, I suppose, seeing as Papá and Dad love to mother you and Pansy. Like the siblings I never had."
fell from his lush lips in between panting gasps and guttural moans. He looked utterly debauched. Sinfully attractive as he bounced on Harry's cock in his lap in the centre of the throne room, not a care in the world. Harry loved the way his lover got after he killed a man.
Lucius clenched his jaw in irritation and Draco felt a pang of satisfaction at the small tell of his rage. His father calmly set aside whatever work he had been doing before Draco had interrupted and he rose from his chair. Fixing Draco with an icy stare, Lucius finally spoke,
seemed rather close. The thought left him feeling a confusing mixture of bitter and thankful that Draco had someone if it were true.
"Harry, the door!" Ron shouted over the thumping baseline of the music and the loud chatter of party-goers.
"Come along, love, let's go cuddle on the sofa for a tick, hmm?" With those words, Harry's entire body relaxed as he let Draco lead him out of the bathroom and into their living room. Draco usually knew what Harry needed after an attack and cuddling always managed to ground Harry to the present better than anything.
He paused and glanced between the pair, making both look down guiltily. The pair sat silent as they waited for Blaise to finish. He took a deep breath then rubbed at his temples before continuing again.
"'S alright, love. She has her moments, besides, it's always good to have a lawyer in the family. And Isaac and I have been chatting more. I think I might become a chauffer like him simply to spite her."
Those calm, almost nonchalant words, proved to shut Draco up very quickly. He couldn't believe, Hermione had...had done
"I love you more than all the stars in the sky, Harry, thank you." His pet murmured, nuzzling at his nose before kissing him sweetly.
Draco resisted the urge to snort again as he carded a hand through his mused hair. He and Pansy both really did have quite a flair for the dramatics. It was a wonder how the world survived with the pair of them as friends.
Before he got a chance to finish his sentence, Draco had vanished behind his front door. The click of the lock echoing into the empty neighbourhood and sending a pang to Harry's heart.
"Alright, I'll make you a deal, Dragon. If you go over there for at least an hour, I'll let you pick where we order take out tomorrow an-"
Draco was to him, especially after their last conversation. The blonde faced him again and narrowed his eyes.
The second the lock clicked into place Draco collapsed against the door, his breathing fast and shallow. He drew his knees to his chest and placed his hands on his temple.
." Draco muttered over and over again trying to calm his racing heart. Nothing had happened and yet the music and people had still set him off. It was overwhelming. He felt like he would run into
Draco carefully pulls his hands from Harry's grasp and slides them up along his body. He traces Harry's broad shoulders, brushes his fingers along his too-defined collar bones. He isn't eating enough either, none of them are. Draco skims them up to Harry's neck and cups his jaw with oddly still hands. He's almost always trembling now. But not with Harry around, never when he's around.
He spoke calmly, no malice in his tone but the words probably still hurt, if the look she gave him was anything to go by.
They stayed like that for a while. Draco's hands gripping onto Harry's shirt as he rocked the pair of them slowly, whispering sweet words to the blonde. The sweetness of it all made Draco want to cry more. He didn't know what he would do without Harry.
, Harry. Couldn't have given me a little warning could you." Draco laughed breathlessly, sliding off of his lap, his cheeks a darker shade of pink, courtesy of Harry, who only smiled at him innocently.
The name seemed to snap him back from wherever it was he had gone and he let out a dry heaving sob, tears streaking his face.
"I-er...I...yes. I remember." He admitted looking more than a little flustered as he glanced at their group of friends watching this play out intently. "Maybe we should discuss this somewhere-"
"'S alright, love, you don't have to tell us right now, hmm? Come now, Cub, you're alright. I've got you." Remus hummed pressing a kiss to the top of Draco's head as he stroked his arm in a comforting manner. Sirius was going to get it from Remus later for sure.
And there are tears in his eyes again. Draco can feel them as they fall down his cheeks. Bloody fucking hell. A piteous sound comes out of his mouth as he tries to catch his breath. He can't.
He settled on Blaise. He would listen to Draco rant and if he came over he wouldn't try anything like Pansy would. And he'd always been the best with advice, ever since they were younger. He sent him a quick message asking him to come over and set the kettle on the stove.
He knew he was being sensitive over something that Harry probably didn't even mean. Pansy and Blaise had been called the second he ran up to his room in near tears, a knee jerk reaction to being called difficult. It always made his throat close up and his eyes water. He never wanted to be a burden and Riddle had made him feel like one for what felt like years.
"Harry!" He shouted excitedly, nearly jumping into the other boy's lap when he pulled him into a hug and startling the others out of their kissing.
He let out a sigh of relief and let Draco hug him as he cried from the overwhelming sense of pleasure coursing through him. He always was such a sensitive thing. So very responsive to every little touch. Harry stroked his hands up and down his back soothingly, muttering reassuring platitudes into his ear.
"It's fine," He hummed then looked at him sideways, "You know, he's strangely protective over you. I've never seen him so mindful of someone else. He nearly took Dean's head off for asking about the touching thing."
The man froze a little and opened his mouth and closed it a couple of times before responding. "I broke a glass. As for the shouting, I wouldn't know anything about that." His voice shook a little and he sounded like he didn't believe himself either.
“Actually, Harry would never ask me to stop visiting you, he’d never ask me to give up my closest friend over this, or anything really. I simply cannot bring myself to want to be around you, not as of late at least. There were better ways of doing this, more careful and subtle ways. Instead, you managed to destroy Ron’s marriage in the foulest of ways, having him catch you in his own home, his
cross the street on my own, thanks." Draco huffed indignantly before he walked across the street hastily. He jammed his key into the front door upon arrival and practically ripped the door off its hinges at how quickly he threw it open. He made quick work of stepping in, shutting the door, locking it, and toeing off his shoes.
"I-I'm sorry, Uncle-" He paused and took a step back when he finally looked up to meet Draco's eyes, "Oh, it's you."
Draco could hear Luna speaking frantically, he couldn't recall her ever doing anything frantically before, why did she sound so far away?
"What's happening?" Theo asked as he and Blaise stood up and Pansy walked back into the room holding a bottle of Firewiskey, scanned the room and then set it down with a questioning look.
"Yes. No. Ugh, what am I doing, Harry?" Draco groaned covering his face. "They're going to hate me. They're going to be so disappointed in me." He muttered into his hands.
"You are not your actions. You are not what you were forced to do to survive, just as I am not my actions or my failures. You, Draco, are not to blame for the lives you could not save, just as I am not to blame for the death of those who fought to protect me. If I'm not allowed to blame myself for the casualties of a war I never asked for then neither are you. Are we clear, my love?"
Draco scanned the floor of his newly bought flat and suppressed a groan at all the boxes laid about. He'd definitely have to ring up Pansy, and the boys to help him unpack and organize everything.
Draco let out a high pitched whine at that but stilled and allowed Harry to carry on with his delicate ministrations.
Draco stopped again and sipped some of his tea. He hadn't been able to get more than a couple of words out before he felt choked up again. This was horrible.
"Hey, hey, let's not do that, love," Harry said, using his body to support Draco's as he pulled him over to the bed to sit.
"It's nice to meet you both, Harry told me all about how wonderful you are. Isn't that right, love?" Draco asked, stroking his thumb along Harry's side and glancing at him. Harry seemed to come back to the present and kept glancing between Draco and his old school mates before pulling him into a fierce kiss.
“Yes, I’m a complete tosser. However, can I make it up to you?” He asked, nudging his nose against Draco’s softly, pulling an exasperated huff from him.
. It gave him time to muster up the courage to call Harry back. The messages were full of Pansy encouraging him to answer and slipping in some none too subtle threats to introduce Harry to her knife collection if he did or said anything untoward, and Blaise's constant reassurance that he only needed to do what he felt comfortable with, what he thought was best for himself. Good, Lord. Okay, he could do this.
"I know," Harry hummed, pressing his nose to Draco's hair and breathing him in, the smell of green apples and parchment settling his nerves. Draco was fine. He was safe. Lucius wouldn't touch him again, he would make sure of that. He turned his head, leaning his cheek against Draco's hair, "I just wish you had. Why didn't you, love?"
"M' sorry, it's dumb. I'm being dramatic, because of-" He let out an exasperated huff when more tears rolled down his cheeks, "Nothing, it's nothing, 'm sorry."
Draco said firmly, leaving no room for argument as he released her wrists and stepped away from her, expectant of Harry to listen. And he did.
maybe it’s time you did the same,” Draco spoke loftily, cocking his head to the side like a bird might, “Don’t you think?”
"Sweet one, what is it?" He asked again. He supported Draco with an arm around his back and reached the other up to cup his face. His pet leant into the touch, turning his head to kiss his palm.
"Sorry, they didn't take it well. Mother barely came around to the idea and, well, you've seen her around Theo and I," Blaise hummed lightly, even if the conversation hadn't taken a light turn, "It's bloody awkward."
Draco learned that Harry was eighteen. He liked football and he could've been a star player if he hadn't gotten hurt in his 4th year playing. He had an intense passion for animals, owls specifically, and he loved the idea of starting a sanctuary. He'd just graduated the summer before, and he loved the stars, Draco being one of his favourite constellations (a fact that Draco revelled in). His favourite colour was gold and his favourite dessert was treacle tarts (which Draco now had a habit of keeping on hand at all times).
Draco nearly dropped both cups as he took in the sight of Ron slouched down in the middle of his Persian carpet shaking. Ron was on his knees, still dressed in his Auror robes, shoeless and cradling a bleeding hand with his entire body trembling.
"Here we are." Harry half-shouted to be heard over the music. He leant against the wall as if to wait for Draco to be finished. He really couldn't handle that right now.
Draco grinned at the irritated scowls Theo and Blaise carried and Pansy's utter obliviousness to it. He really appreciated his friends for helping him get settled into his new home and the entertainment they brought with them, too.
"The Malfoy heir should never participate in such foul, distasteful behaviour. If you truly believe you are 'in love' with the Potter Boy, I suggest you leave. You are not welcome here and you are no son of mine."
"Traitor." Draco stuck his tongue out at him in response and Papá, being the very mature adult he was, returned the favour.
Draco really hoped the unsettling boy would leave him alone after that, to sleep off whatever it is that was in that drink, but Theodore climbed onto the bed after him and bracketed Draco with his arms and legs.
. Then we'll have a movie night. We'll bake some of those cavity-inducing brownies you love and binge on whatever snacks your parents have hidden away. You've got us till late Sunday, darling. You haven't ruined anything."
"Yes, right, sorry, sorry. It's uh half-past one." Harry said scrambling to follow Draco as he blundered toward the door on shaky legs.
The last sentence had been meant as a joke but Draco seemed to stiffen at the words. His smile fell a fraction and then resurfaced looking fake, plastic. Shit, Harry had messed up.
Blaise, Theo, and Pansy were over this time. All four of them huddled together on the couch with dozens of snacks, pillows, and blankets surrounding them as they watched some convoluted French horror film Pansy had brought with her. A loud thud made Theo and Pansy jump. Theo threw himself into Blaise's lap and hid his face in his neck while Blaise laughed, seemingly immune to the movie, and Pansy clung onto Draco fiercely.
The redhead only snorted in reply and bumped shoulders with a glowering Harry as they finished their food. He did not
And with those words, Draco shut the door in his face and locked it. Sirius hopped down the last few steps and smacked his son upside the head.
“Firewhiskey?” Harry asked as he stood collecting their rubbish from the dinner they'd eaten. He figured the alcohol might make this easier on both of them. Ron shot him a nervous look and nodded in response.
"Christ, Draco!" Blaise choked out sitting up to look at the blonde who kept his eyes firmly glued to the ceiling as he threw about his hands in wild gestures, pointedly ignoring his concern. If he stopped now he wouldn't get through the story.
Draco felt Harry pull him off of his mother, who released him and went to whisper about Draco to her husband. Despite not wanting Harry to worry or see him like this he didn't make a move to resist him.
"C'mon let's get you on the sofa and you can sip some of that tea and let's take these robes off, it's too warm in here for them."
Harry's eyes softened as a few stray tears ran down his boyfriends’ cheeks. He wished Draco understood how little he cared about being called racist and homophobic slurs or about getting a little scratch. None of that mattered so long as Draco was safe and happy.
"What makes you think you're not a part of this?" Blaise asked, stalking towards him, a dangerous glint in his eye. Oh,
"Harry, darling, I'm Pansy. Would it be alright if I took a few photos of you?" Pansy asked, as she crouched down in front of him and he nodded, "Alright, I'll need you to sit up for a quick minute, then you can go back to leaning on Draco, hmm?"
"F-for being s-nappy to you and rude to-to Bl-Blaise, I'm so-orry," He sniffed, as the tears continued to flow from his eyes. Draco frowned at the shaky and crying mess of his boyfriend and went to hold him and comfort him when Harry spoke again.
"James! Harry! Get in here!" She hollered and Draco wanted the floor to open up and devour him whole. He didn't want Harry to see this. Then he'd have to tell him what happened and Draco didn't want Harry to blame himself for this. And he knew he would. Harry was like that. Too good to be true.
"Uh... so, how do you know each other?" Ron asked. Draco jumped a little at the voice then flushed pink and stepped away from Luna.
Hermione broke out into a shaky sob as Harry finished speaking. She covered her face with her hands and tried and failed to contain herself.
"It's fine. I haven't had a panic attack in a while, not this bad anyway..." Draco trailed off and finally noticed they were alone. His eyebrows raised at that, which Harry noticed apparently.
Draco pressed his face into Remus' chest and he fell apart a little more. Quiet whimpers and hiccups left his body as he wrapped his arms around his father. Sirius' heart clenched at the sight. He hated feeling so helpless when it came to Draco's feelings and not being able to take the hurt away.
-walls. Apparently, there were very thin walls between Draco's flat and the one above him seeing as he was interrupted once again, this time by two different voices. It sounded like a man shouting angrily and someone...whining or crying perhaps?
"Hello, my names Harry Potter. I live just across the street and a mate of mine goes to Hogwarts with your so-"
"Of course, Draco. I'm happy you had fun. I guess I'll let you get home to your Dad's then. It's late, I wouldn't want them to worry. And thank you for letting me drive you for once, lord, are you difficult sometimes."
"Do not interrupt me when I am speaking!" Lucius Malfoy hissed as he raised his right hand and struck Draco across the face. A sickening clap rang out in the courtyard as Draco let his head fall forward till it hung in shame, his eyes glued to his feet and a red handprint surfaced on his pale cheek. The courtyard was now completely silent of all of the students’ whispers. Many had sympathetic eyes focused on Draco, but a small few, including many Gryffindor's, were looking smug about the harm that had come to him.
between my legs, as you've so distasteful put it, is your Prince Consort. You will do well to show him respect! You will know your place!"
Draco wished someone would come to rescue him from this silver-tongued, handsome-faced boy with pushy hands. He was far too domineering and resembled Riddle more and more every time he spoke. And Theodore was
"Draco." He sighed stroking his cheek softly. Stormy grey eyes finally met his gaze and Draco sniffed a little in the process.
Harry slid into the seat across from Hermione at a small restaurant in Diagon Alley. He'd asked her to lunch while Draco took Ron to collect some of his things so he could move into their guest bedroom for the time being.
He felt something press into the palm of his hand. It was rough and sort of prickly and strange. For a second he thought he was holding a thing stuck full of needles and the feeling startled him enough to open his eyes pulling him back to reality.
"It's nearly midnight, who in their right mind," Pansy scoffed, as she stood up to more than likely yell at whoever it was.
“You do realize after this you won’t be seeing much of me at all?” Draco asked once he’d regained his loose grip on sanity after the images Pansy had so casually snuck into his mind. She smiled wryly and shook her head.
Draco sniffled and pressed his face into the crook of Harry's neck. He sucked a lazy bruise into the juncture where neck met shoulder above the bite mark he'd made at the beginning of all this and left kisses around the reddened skin as an apology. Draco took a shaky breath then spoke in a small croaking voice, rough from his loud cries.
He looked down and found a pinecone wrapped in his hand. Dudley had shoved a pinecone into his hand and Draco couldn't help but to laugh. An incredulous and borderline hysterical sort of laugh. He saw Dudley give him a concerned look which he waved off.
Harry brought a hand up to run through his hair in frustration. He glanced at Draco's front door once again with a defeated look and then wandered across the street back to his own house.
Draco couldn't process what happened next as he barely managed to open his eyes at the yelling. It was all sort of fuzzy. Theodore was thrown off of him, a red blur following after, someone was shouting-a girl perhaps- she sounded familiar, hands were everywhere his own included. A face he almost recognized swam in his vision.
"Oh and then bloody Potter with his stupid charming face and those goddamned pouty emeralds for eyes. Lord
Harry continued to apologize, his shaking hands grasping blindly at the broken shards. His breathing was coming in short panicked gasps as his body shook furiously.
me. Like I was broken Harry, or I'd caught some sort of disease! He spent a month drilling into my head exactly what was expected of me, an heir, a perfect little pure-blood bride for a wife." Draco said bitterly he face twisting in disgust. He still couldn't believe, after all of this, he still wanted his fathers' love.
"Got it!" Harry yelled back skirting around a group of boys having a drinking competition in the middle of his living room. He pulled his front door open while looking back at his friends.
Draco looked as gorgeous as ever as he stood there in his doorway. He wore an oversized blue jumper, not unlike the green one he'd seen him wear the other day. Oversized jumpers suited him and Harry thought he looked adorable. Draco's eyes, Harry noticed, weren't blue like he'd previously thought, but a beautiful silver that took his breath away. Gods this boy was attractive.
-Draco chokes a little at the thought- "It suited him so well too. Little muggle-born Leo with his loud mouth and his stupid bravery. He reminds-
Harry could feel his face heat up at the indistinguishable glint in the other boy's eyes. He dragged his palms down the sides of his trousers and then twisted them behind his back. He watched Draco lick his lips and then smile at him in such a soft way it made Harry's stomach flutter. Bloody fucking hell. He was gorgeous.
"Luna?" Draco gasped, looking startled and excited all at once. Harry gapped at the pair as Luna walked forward and engulfed Draco in a hug. He watched as Draco rushed out a flurry of apologies as he held her tightly. Harry stared wide-eyed and he couldn't help but wonder how they knew each other because apparently, the no touching rule didn't apply to Luna.
Draco groaned, his voice becoming more shrill with exasperation with every sentence he ground out. At the end of his rant, he took in a deep breath and released it in a huff. Potter had really sent him into a rage at the strange form of coddling.
"What d'you know about him?" He nodded at the unnaturally blonde boy helping his parents with the groceries. Harry had had an odd obsession with the bloke ever since he'd moved in across the street from him and it didn't seem to help any when Ron offhandedly mentioned they went to the same school.
Draco deflated at that. He didn't know. He supposed he'd had some sort of childish hope that Blaise would have a magical solution even if he knew that was unrealistic.
"It's alright, my beautiful boy. We'll sort this out tomorrow and if you still want to speak with a counsellor then, we'll find someone who's suited to you." Remus said, rubbing his back, trying to soothe their son. Immediately after he finished speaking, he shot Sirius a stern look and nodded his head towards Draco's shaking form as if to say
Draco pressed his nails into the pad of his thumb over and over again, the little tinge of pain drawing him away from the dark hole of misery and self-loathing he was going to fall down. At least this way he wasn't drawing blood. And he could remind himself:
“My love, my darling. It’s alright. I’ve got you, baby. I won’t hurt you, I promise. You’re safe.” Draco soothed running a hand along Harry’s cheek wiping away his tears. Beautiful green eyes finally greeted him and Draco gave Harry a loving smile.
"I know, but I want to. You're my best friend and you are clearly head over heels for that boy. And even if you weren't, he deserves to feel happy and safe."
"Ah, ah, you impatient thing. Let me have my way," Harry chided, sucking bruises on his pale neck above the collar, he did bruise so beautifully, "I promise you'll be satisfied at the end, my love."
"Lucius!" Narcissa said aghast, her face pale and ghost-like, almost as though she couldn't fathom what she'd just heard her husband say. She stumbled to her feet and latched onto his arm, giving him pleading eyes but Lucius didn't spare her so much as a glance.
at him while he held Draco's hips and carefully set him down. The blonde's eyes had doubled in size at the realization of who it was.
"I promise, we will make sure that man stays very far away from you, for a very long time. Once the police arrest him, we'll go up to the flat and take all of your things and bring them down here. And we'll figure everything else out once things have settled."
Pettigrew's body landed in a mangled heap. His mouth parted in a silent scream, eyes wide with fear as he toppled over dead, multiple daggers sticking out of his unmoving body. A trail of blood stained the white floor red. What a mess. Harry let out a long-suffering sigh. Finding a new advisor was going to be such a hassle. He shook his head then shifted his gaze to his pet who now stood at the base of the dais facing away from him.
He said nothing as he watched Madame Pomfrey clean up his boyfriend. He silently pet Draco's hair and rubbed his back soothingly as she gave him a calming draught for the panic attack that seized him after he'd snapped out of his stunned stupor. Harry stayed that way as she healed him and finally finished flitting around them anxiously, leaving them alone with an exasperated huff.
Draco was met with more silence and Harry kept staring at him with those impossibly green eyes full of an emotion he couldn't place. He nodded once and finished off his little speech.
He trailed off anxiously. How was he supposed to tell Harry it had only been a little over 3 months since he hadn't been under the influence of a sociopathic abuser?
"Neighbors. I'm not positive, but I think Harry's being abused by his uncle, at least that's what it seems like." Draco replied, successfully finding his shoes and slipping them on. He'd had time to mull over what he'd seen that night and decided he was probably correct about the domestic violence occurring above him.
Harry watched silently. His heart clenched at the sight. He couldn't imagine how horrible she must feel but he knew it was nothing compared to what Ron was feeling. A twisted part of him had hoped that Parkinson had in some way manipulated or blackmailed her into doing it. At least then there was a chance for reconciliation, redemption even. Then Ron and 'Mione could move past this. But Hermione was far too smart to be tricked or forced into anything. And despite his deep want to stay neutral and not take sides, he couldn't deny that he was one hundred per cent behind Ron.
Now Harry definitely felt like he was imposing and with a quick glance around the group he realized he wasn't the only one.
are you injured anywhere else?" Draco asked releasing his hand and looking at him with concern swirling in his grey eyes. Ron still seemed far off and it took him a minute before he answered.
It has been a week and three days since Draco had last seen Harry and he had counted every second of it. The last time he'd been this stressed out and high strung was when some prick at school had threatened to out him to his parents. And his friends had noticed, which is why they were all piled around his coffee table sitting on the floor in front of the sofa and playing board games.
He stomped his way back to his flat and threw himself into angry cleaning every room. Draco hated how useless he was in this situation. He couldn't go knocking down Vernon's door and he couldn't call the police, Harry would no doubt deny it all and feel utterly betrayed, which would amount to nothing other than a broken friendship. He could do virtually nothing and it burned.
"Of course, would I ever lie to you, love?" Harry replied raising an eyebrow at Draco, almost as if to dare him to say otherwise. The other boy shook his head, no. A smug look crossed Harry's face, his nose wrinkling in amusement, as he poked his tongue out to tease Draco. He giggled shamelessly and stroked the back of Harry's neck fondly.
Harry dragged a hand through his hair roughly over and over. A nervous tick, like how Dad bit the inside of his cheek or Papa tapped, his fingers, his foot. Draco watched silently, waiting for the rest of the story as he carefully placed the glass down on the nightstand.
"Everyth-thing hur-rts." Draco cried as Harry held him with strong arms and rubbed his back. He didn't deserve this boy at all. Certainly not while he was such a blubbering mess.
"I did it! I told them." Draco smiled easily, situating himself next to a blinking Harry. He casually wrapped his arms around one of Harry's and lent against him as he continued to speak.
Draco's eyebrows knitted together, a sad smile resting on his face, he hated that Harry felt guilty for what those nasty muggles did to him as a child. And he hated that he hadn't known till now, if he ever saw one of them in public he'd hex them into oblivion. Not even Merlin,
Theodore threw his head back and laughed. "Can't hold your liquor, pretty boy?" He sniggered taking a swig of whatever it is he was drinking. Draco wanted to go home. This was not what he had signed up for. What time was it anyway?
Harry could still recall dozens of shouting matches between the two on bar nights when Draco had finally mustered up the nerve to invite his friends along. How they had transformed that sort of volatile relationship into a romance was beyond him.
"Mione, I'm home! We can head over to Harry and Malfoy's place early after I change." Ron shouted up the stairs as he shut the door and kicked his shoes off in the process. He had been let off early for the first time in months and it was a luxury he relished. And for once he and Hermione were at home at the same time.
Draco knew that Harry preferred physical pain to emotional pain and this being true he would take a punishment for longer than healthy and wouldn't safe word to get Draco to stop even if he was in danger of collapsing from the pain. Harry would rather someone beat him senseless than have to deal with any of his emotional turmoil. This being said Draco would never in his life push Harry past his limits, even if Harry had broken a rule, even if he had upset Draco, he would never hurt Harry like that. He knew when Harry had had enough and the shaking body before him told him just that.
Fuck, he should answer before it went to-the ringing stopped then and Harry was no doubt leaving him another voice mail. He gave it a few seconds and reread the last few messages Pansy and Blaise sent in their group chat, lovingly named
"Draco, I know this is difficult. I can tell you care about this, about Harry, but it sounds like you've already realized that you can't do anything." Blaise said softly, as he held one of Draco's hands, rubbing his thumb over the back of it in a comforting manner. He hated when Blaise pointed things like that out, especially when he was right.
"Alright, alright, let's go then. Where'd you want to eat?" Harry asked as he and Ron climbed into his car and drove off.
"I'd take Harry with you to your bed or you'll both be kicked off of the sofa by Theo in the middle of the night. Either way, goodnight, Draco."
“Do you even regret it? Feel the slightest bit guilty, anything?” Draco asked weakly, collapsing into one of her many armchairs, propping his legs up onto the arm and leaning his back up against the other. He gave her an imploring look while she raised a perfectly shaped eyebrow at him.
"Ronald Weasley, I am certainly not in the mood for this! You come crashing in here shoeless, bleeding, and sobbing like a mad man, and say things like that. How do you suppose I respond? You make it sound as if Hermione is dead, I'm sure she's just fine at work. Now, I am not lacking in sympathy or compassion, but what in
Harry's hands latch back onto his hips. His fingers pet the soft skin on his midriff making him shiver. He's missed being touched without being hurt. No one else is allowed this close to him without a serious fight. Everyone else is a threat. He hopes when this is all over and it will end, one way or another, that he will be able to allow others near him again.
Stop!" He says it forcefully, his hands tightening around his wrists and it breaks him out of his hysteria. Draco freezes, he knows that tone of voice too well. It startles him into silent tears instead of the loud sobbing he had been doing. He doesn't want to hurt him too. And if he hurts himself and carries on like this it
“I’m so sorry, I didn’t-I didn’t mean-please I-please, ‘m sorry,” Harry cried frantically, looking horrified and far off as he dropped to his knees next to the broken dishes.
With those words and one last meaningful look, Draco turned to leave. There wasn't anything else he could do. He heard the man clear his throat just as he was going to step away, so he turned towards Harry quickly as to not miss his words.
Draco dropped his hand and tilted his head to the side, looking up into his eyes. Silver met green. And it was electric.
be there to forgive Harry for everything and anything. He would always be there to forgive Harry for all the things that he didn't do but still blamed himself for and Draco would try his bloody hardest to convince Harry that it wasn't his fault.
"How you view me, Draco, matters more than anyone else. Their words carry no weight, no value in comparison. Not even big bad Death Eater, Mr Malfoy."
"Hey, it's alright, Pans. It's probably nothing, why don't you pick another game," Draco said, standing up and making his way over towards the door where the knocking continued in an almost frantic way. It was probably Mrs Figg looking for her cat again.
"Hermione," Harry interrupted her hiccuped apologies in a firm voice as he reached out to grab one of her hands, "I love you, but you need to sort this out. I can't be here for you in this because I need to be there for Ron. I don't want to be cruel, that isn't why I came here, but you brought this upon yourself and you need to decide how to handle this. This isn't something you can simply
Rage blossomed in Harry's chest like a roaring wildfire as he shoved his books into the nearest students’ arms, which just so happened to be Ron, and stormed toward the two Malfoy's. His eyes were blazing with anger as he whipped out his wand and harshly pressed it into Lucius Malfoy's neck, completely unfazed by the Death Eater. He stood between one of the most infamous dark wizards and Draco without an ounce of fear. He vaguely remembered Draco calling him stupidly heroic and awfully Gryffindor-ish earlier that year as he did so. Draco was probably correct.
"Draco? My love? Are you all the way back with me?" Harry sounds hopeful, his eyebrows scrunch in question, and it makes Draco's heart clench. He's missed him. He hasn't seen Harry in three weeks. It's been too long. This war has been too long. He hasn't properly looked at him yet. And he is still beautiful, still so painfully open despite who Draco is.
Harry nodded and gave his leg a reassuring squeeze which prompted Draco to continue despite his racing heart. He felt like he might throw up. He hadn't thought about Anthony Goldstein or that hell-forsaken month in a while.
He is beautiful in a devastating way. It makes Draco's heart lock up with all sorts of mushy feelings neither of them has time for. He smiles a small fond thing as he brushes an errant curl out of his face.
"This might all be my fault. I don't-maybe I didn't pay enough attention or I don't know...maybe she didn't-or never.
Draco whispers it like a secret, kissing him on the forehead, and then settles himself back down against his broad chest.
Draco felt his mouth go dry at his voice. Jesus, words shouldn't be so difficult. Evidently, he'd been quiet for too long as Harry's voice rang out again with a questioning,
Draco's body shook from the crying as he tried to suppress it all. He wished the numbness would come back. He felt stupid for crying. It was his own fault after all.
"Blaise, Theo, make sure that man doesn't get in here and lock the door. Pansy, call the police, tell them a man is trying to break in with the means to hurt us and that he's already committed assault." Draco ordered, fire burning behind his eyes. This
Draco said softly, his hands hovering close to Harry's, just in case he hurt himself, but not quite touching yet. He’d learned early on in the relationship that during one of these panic attacks touch wasn't always welcome. Although, he’d never seen one quite like this before. Harry flinched away from his voice and managed to cut himself with the broken glass before Draco could grab him.
Draco turned a violent shade of scarlet at the blatant compliment and once over the boy had given him. He felt the urge to fidget and squirm. How uncomfortable. He'd only known Riddle to be so forward and he didn't want to think about Riddle.
"I was just thinking of you," Draco hummed, as he walked into the kitchen, hoping to put on some tea.
but a pathetic, racist, homophobic, blood purist, and entitled prick. Just a stupid bully who never grew up. You couldn’t be more worthless if you
"You shouldn't have teased me last time we saw each other, love," Harry replied, his words accompanied by a far too cheesy wink, that Draco would never admit made his heart flutter.
"You know what's worse is I genuinely thought he meant well by it all. By all the threats, the screaming, the hexes and curses, even the poor french girls he tried to throw at me." He snorted at just how wrong he'd been.
"Hmm, alright well," Draco hummed derisively, as Blaise and Pansy sprawled out onto the bed flanking him on both sides. "I went to a party last Saturday where I saw Luna after ghosting her all last year courtesy of you know which fucker, then I had a panic attack. After which my drink was spiked with only-god-knows-
. And I shouldn't be the one you're apologizing to, I'm not the one you hurt. Now, let's finish our lunch. It might be a while before we're able to do this again."
know you're allowed to have feelings about your mother's absence, right?" Draco countered, the sternness in his grey eyes not faltering as he looked up at Blaise who was irritatingly taller than him. The dark-skinned boy shook his head and layed down. He twisted his body so his head was in Draco's lap and his long limbs sprawled out on the grass.
"Mother, I will not pretend to be someone I'm not and I refuse to stay in this suffocating mansion with that poisonous man." Draco coolly replied turning to face his strong-willed mother. Her blue eyes pierced into Draco's and it took all of his self-restraint not to duck his head in shame. He couldn't bear to disappoint his mother.
They stay that way for a long while, Harry's hands rubbing soothing lines up and down his back. Until Harry's breathing evens out and Draco can't help but to shift up and gaze at his sleeping lover's face.
Harry answered it, crooked glasses, pretty green eyes, messy hair and all. He looked distressed, his eyes red-rimmed and his hands were shaking. The skin around one of his eyes was a harsh red like he'd just taken a punch to the face and his lips quivered a little. Draco frowned.
Draco nodded slowly and unwrapped his arms, carefully letting them fall to his sides. An awkward smile overtook his face before he responded.
"Look, it was dark, alright! Jeez, 'Mione it's not like I would've done it if I'd known they were playing around." Harry said defensively as he grabbed at her wrist before she could smack him again. Hermione retracted her hand and sighed. She shook her head, pressing her fingers to her temple.
“Mr. Potter-Malfoy, if you’re concerned with addiction, there are a number of prophylactic charms that can make it difficult for you to utter the Unforgiveables.” She informed him.
There was a flash of blue light and Harry straightened up, his kneeling legs straddling Draco as he erected a powerful shield over them both.
He pulled up his left sleeve and there, where the Dark Mark had previously gone dormant for eleven years was an irritation of tissues in the same shape of the skull and snake.
A little taller than him, inhumanly bright blue eyes, long blonde hair falling past the shoulders. The...was it a boy? A girl? The person regarded him kindly through a pair of sunglasses, liberally festooned with blinking and flashing LED’s.
Draco, sitting on George’s shoulders, held tightly to Harry’s hand where he was sat on Fred’s shoulders next to him, the two twins giggling madly as they jogged through the crowd at an insane pace.
The Malfoy house magics were suddenly a part of him. Draco reached out and felt that his mother and Severus had indeed made it out to the hall and were fine, waiting anxiously at the door.
Draco was struck hard from behind, stumbling forward to land in Harry’s lap, the wolf on his back, its ambery eyes lit with unholy glee as it stuck a wet nose right into Draco’s flawless blond locks.
“You were close to spewing your seed in my mouth, that’s why.” Draco said, replacing his mouth with his fingers, spreading his saliva and the natural lubrication over the head as he stroked it sensually, up and down, up and down.
“I want you, Harry. Very much. More than I’ve ever wanted anything, to tell you the truth. Perhaps I’ve wanted you since I first saw you, to hear my mother speak of it – I don’t know. But I certainly want you now. As a friend, as an ally, as my partner, as my husband in bed and in our home, as father to our children. And…more than that, you are…significant to me in a way beyond that…I find that even if I cannot have you as any of those, as I could never have you for the past five years, I find you are important nevertheless, that I habitually define myself in relation to you.”
as breathtaking as the Atrium of Malfoy Manor, but then, it was only intended for a few generations of Malfoys to live in comfort for a time, and was
vulnerability, Potter. The moral of the maxim is that fully attaching yourself to things or people before placing them fully under your protection only makes them a target for your enemies.”
“It wasn’t a proper one, your mother’s magic interfered and temporarily vanquished the Dark Lord before the ceremony was completed. Which left it, and the Dark Lord, vulnerable to Love Magic.”
-baby.” Draco scolded. “And he was able to help because he had both a magical and physical way out of your father, and young Thomas here was able to come out with him.”
“You’re right on one thing, Draco. I do love you. And I do want to marry you, too, once I know I can trust you.”
The two walked side-by-side, only inches apart, into the open grounds. A small cadre of DA students had formed a small defensive knot, holding their own effectively against the first probes by the Death Eaters.
“Who? Oh. Lord Malfoy.” Mr. Weasley was suddenly very uncomfortable, clearly not pleased to see the scion of the hated Malfoys in his home.
“Oh yes, my son was involved in developing that course, actually. I think you’ll find the name is quite a bit more appropriate than you expected.” Lucius smirked.
Draco was no fool. Being that much of a weakness was in itself a power. A power over Potter, to manipulate him. If he was clever enough he could make the Boy Who Lived Dance not
“But we like the things you bring us even more!” Regulus added, then went silent at the horrified gasp from above.
Draco opened his mouth to tease him, then decided to go for a deeper kiss as a more effective (and enjoyable) tactic.
Lucius looked uncomfortable sitting on the seat Draco had taken as a boy, and that Lucius had no doubt taken long ago while Abraxas Malfoy was still Lord.
“Voldemort always feared Death more than anything. He thought it was ignominious.” Harry told him. “He never understood that there are far worse things a person could do to themselves.”
Draco crossed his arms, waiting for him to finish. Harry of course, was not so patient, and tried to talk between giggles.
“Okay, so according to Schrodinger we can split the variable like so, using a is/not function right here. Now you say this Heroditus guy, who I have never heard of, built a system to actually run the function outside an accelerator, so how do we set it up now that we’ve done the math?”
“I don’t know but I heard one of the really sixth years was talking about it at dinner, she said it’s better to sleep with the seventh years because what they’ve got in bed is bigger and harder every year, so it’s a growing up thing.” James explained.
“Besides having different effects, Reducto is a straight-line targeting spell, while Muffliato is a general-effect spell, yes. Though of course the latter isn’t wise if you’ve allies in the vicinity.”
“I’m her de facto guardian in the magical world, Potter. You have to go through me, especially on matters of inheritance.”
“Zabini. You’ve been teaching your spawn blood-magic. No surprise there, but now he’s used it right in public.”
“I’m not going to burn you at stake, Lucius. Or tell anyone. But…I think I need to sleep on this. I’ll be back, and I will have questions. So many questions. But…now it is all a jumble. I need to get away and…re-order my universe.”
“Uh. Thanks. Malfoy. You look good too.” Potter said awkwardly. Through force of will, Draco managed to resist the urge to roll his eyes at Potter’s statement of the blatantly obvious.
“I have reason to believe he would not be adverse to the idea. But…I also know he was raised by Muggles and…expects things to be handled very differently than what I am accustomed to. The courtship rituals…I’ve tried researching in Muggle literature, but haven’t found much of use on that front. As a personal confidant of Potter’s…you would know the rituals specific to his family and background, correct?”
After many long years of being just too busy and stressed to write, current circumstances (COVID-19, basically) now leave me with limited available activities due to being stuck indoors. But, writing is something I still enjoy in my work, even from a more serious tone than here. I figured I'd break myself back in the habit of writing in the voices of my characters with a character I've been wanting to sink my teeth into!
Jonas shook his head, turning to join the queue. Lucius decided to accompany him, but was distracted by a strange tingling sensation in his left arm. His left forearm.
“Marvelous feat of magic, of course. Draco, I don’t believe I’ve ever hear of a more perfectly executed piece of bond-magic in all my studies. Masterful. Dangerous, but very well done. And integrated so smoothly with the courtship ritual too. The staged betrayal, the concealed revelation, the emotions plucked so neatly from both of you for the perfect magical mixture. Lovely work, just lovely.” Dumbledore rambled.
Draco rolled his eyes and sat next to her, let her lean close to him, and couldn’t help noticing the narrow-eyed glare of green eyes across the hall.
Jamina Lily Black swept into the Entry Hall like a swirling gust of wind, handing off her bags to a house elf on her right, shrugging off her Puffskein fur cloak and allowing it to swirl gracefully onto the magical coat rack on her left – freeing her limbs to catch a nephew in each arm as they hurtled into her, wrapping small arms around her waist.
day tomorrow for fighting! You’ll report to my office at dawn tomorrow. Now you!” Snape shook Potter. “Get out of my sight!”
And then the traditionally cryptic explanation for the selection of this particular heirloom as a gift for the child being courted.
He let out a deep breath and quickly removed his hand from Harry’s leg. He took some satisfaction that Harry looked as disappointed as he felt.
“Of course not. I did mention to him the possibility of a contract between Potter and Black, suggesting a contract between Lord Potter and my newly discovered cousin Jamina Black. He refused outright…I was fortunate enough to learn some time later that he has a particular interest in myself, instead.”
Some kind of particularly nasty curse, no doubt. His father’s lessons in exercising power through careful applications of fear gave that away easily. Maybe even…Harry Potter’s smug face appeared in Draco’s recollection for a moment. He waved it away.
“Jimmy, and Frederick, and Susie, and Donny, and Sam!” Harry grinned back, pointing at each child in turn. “Kids, this is Draco, my- oh, Moony,
He could feel his mother’s eyes boring into him as he turned his face forward again, and slowly mounted the stairs, his back perfectly straight.
The phrasing of the letter was according to the traditional formula for the first stage of the Heirloom, Magic, Blood ritual.
“I don’t know. The Patils got separated in our year, they were pretty close but they managed.” Harry whispered back.
during this previous evening. I’m sure you can agree the circumstances are most pointed in this case.”
“Oh! I have it here.” Potter took a tiny book from his pocket and unshrunk it before handing it to Draco.
“Centuries.” Lucius replied smugly, and pointing his wand into the nitrogen, let the magic flow cleanly from his core, watching his friend’s expression.
“Thank you for an exquisite dinner, Mrs. Weasley. I hope I will be allowed to return the privilege in the near future.” Draco thanked her politely.
“Yes, my Lord. I recognized his status as your hidden heir several months ago, and quickly initiated Heirloom, Magic, Blood. We have negotiated the terms of a contract, and it remains to seek your permission for the final gift. The Blood gift.”
James watched as his brother flattened himself against the wall and…ever so carefully, edged his head outward for a look.
How interesting that Draco could not see him, but knew that he was there…while he sat in plain sight of his prey, whose eyes failed to notice him.
“I am sooo happy to meet all my new Hufflepuffs! I am Professor Tonks, you kids can all just call me Tonks, and I’ll be your Head of House! That means I’m sort of the parent of our little family-away-from-home here in Hufflepuff! So if any of you have any problems or just want to talk just ask and I’ll be right and ready to talk to you any time! I’ll also be teaching you guys Transfiguration but let’s let the school stuff wait until classes tomorrow! For now, let’s get to know each other! I’ll start, I’m Tonks, I have a husband Remus and a son Teddy. My best friend is Molly and my favorite thing to do is flying! Okay, now you!”
And that's the end! But there is a sequel in progress. Because…Draco only destroyed the Horcruxes Voldemort actually knew about! See what that means for Draco and Harry in The Orphaned Soul!
Tom reluctantly relinquished Scorpius to Harry with a stern admonishment that his brother would be due for feeding in thirty minutes and that his father had best remember that the infant preferred his milk warmed with just a very light sweetening spell. Harry took the child with appropriate assurances and shooed the teen off to “go make some friends and don’t be shy”.
This time there was an outright explosion as the excited athletes and crazed fans (which included nearly everybody) chattered about the other Quidditch teams and argued over which members of the House teams should represent Hogwarts.
“I believe the simplest way to avoid unnecessary…obstacles…is to simply reveal to you ahead of time what the next two gifts to Potter will be.” Draco said, and pulled out two tiny rolled-up pieces of parchment.
Potter looked down at him, flushed with arousal and remaining fury for his duplicity, an eye flickering towards the closed bag behind him for a second.
know about magical protections?” Draco sneered at it. “You’re a bloody quill-pusher for Merlin’s sake! I’m quite sure the protections we have in place at the new location will excel even Gringott’s best abilities.”
“And do you also swear that you will never reveal the contents of the memories provided to you by Severus Snape as part of this vow, to anyone, to his detriment?”
“And finally on the agenda today, Proposition four-hundred-twenty-seven…introduced by Prefect Finch-Fletchley…suggesting that Prefects be allowed to bring up to two guests at any one time with them into the prefects bath.”
Draco felt a heaviness of pain at the realization that this man he had loved from infancy was now less than what he was. He resisted the sharp sensation behind his eyes, knowing his father would be further diminished to see his son reduced to tears at his condition.
. But the magic of our bonding purged it of everything unclean and Dark. Everything that was anathema to the Love magic. I…I thought that would effectively destroy it, entirely. It’s a Horcrux, after all. But…apparently…. some part of him wasn’t inherently evil.”
“We’ll take care of that too. Please, just come on.” Draco coaxed him out of the Potions classroom and down the hall to the bathroom.
Over the past eleven years, Lucius had grown steadily bitter and miserable, finding his beliefs about blood and magic proven wrong over and over as the magical community dramatically increased in power and knowledge by taking advantage of the fresh blood and fresh ideas the muggleborns seemed to have an endless supply of. His own mistakes, made worse by the fact that the magical community tended to gloss them over: forgiveness earned through the efforts of his brilliant son and powerful son-in-law, haunted him.
, which I very much doubt, it wouldn’t work. Titles are inherited. Not transferred. Otherwise there’d be no end of jealous brothers and cousins trying to extort themselves into Lordship. It’s quite enough to have them trying to kill you, I think. Plenty of familial magic that will take vengeance for that.”
“Ready to lose, Potter?” Draco sneered at the boy. Somehow the words were falling flat of their usual witty sharpness lately.
After that, the Dark Lord had rather gradually warmed to the plan Draco suggested…but at what point did this mean he was pleased enough to open the door to the sleeping Harry?
Potter screamed as Draco swallowed his erection, his entire body going rigid as Potter’s magic slammed into his skull from the point of contact.
There were small detonations of lightning happening in the cauldron now, one every few seconds. The room was charged with magic and electricity.
The splashes of salty water on his back…tears?...stung in the wounds and Draco could feel his grip on reality slipping away.
He pounded his fists uselessly against unbroken slab of oak, his blows swallowed up in its bulk with barely even a sound.
Draco held his eyes for a moment. The message was clear. Draco was still, in fact, a Dark wizard. One who would use that branch of magic on Potters behalf. But Dark.
Draco blocked and sent a stiletto curse at Ron’s shoulder, letting Jaime’s feigned attempt to pull him out of the way of Ron’s curse seem to throw his aim so it wasn’t fatal.
magic than either of them. Actual power is based on knowledge, however, and the boy is hopelessly ignorant.” Severus said carefully.
“I think it may be better this way. For now. You know my views on this kind of connection. It was…unprecedented of me to let you get so close to me. Without a blood or magical bond, first. Unprecedented for centuries of Malfoys. And for good reason.”
First, was that Potter also quite clearly lusted after Draco’s body. Incestuous relationships were not a problem, of course, especially at this level of removal, particularly since they had entirely different bloodlines and magical gifts.
“Actually, I agree its very rude of you to continue calling me that, considering I’ve been calling you by your given name.” Draco interjected smoothly, ignoring the wands that had been quickly drawn and pointed at him.
“You and Harry were always a little too desperate in your enmity for it to be pure dislike.” Lupin told him.
Draco smirked at the prudish Gryffindor and pulled him by the hand to the edge of the crystal basin. Two drying charms, and they were dressing themselves, Harry doing so at a frantic pace.
Slowly, deliberately, he unhooked the silver cufflinks at his wrists. Pansy gasped behind him, recognizing his intent.
“Miles… oh you still use English measurements too! That’s two hundred kilometers, though, that sounds terrifying!”
! I know that now, you and the muggleborns you’ve allied with have proven that and proven that and I cannot read a single new magical text anymore without having my nose rubbed in my own foolishness. But those are
“Moderation? How dare thissss misssserable worm sssspeak of moderation? Of ssssleep!” the Dreamer sputtered incoherently with rage.
His first indication of approval had been when Draco had detailed the gifts. The mention of the Crystal Sceptre had caused the Dark Lord’s red eyes to brighten with malevolent glee, and Harry’s willing acceptance of a powerful Dark Talisman…yes, Harry could have heard that.
“Um…Reducto and Muffliato…I had to concentrate on blocking the dangerous one but that left me with buzzing in my ears that distracted me for the rest of the match.”
I WANT US ALL TO MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE HE WAS ALMOST THERE WHILE YOU WERE GROWING UP, DESPITE THAT UNFORTUNATE BONDING RITUAL ACCIDENT THAT LEFT HIM MATED TO YOUR PET FUZZYWUGGUM WHEN YOU WERE FIVE. I’M SURE I DON’T HAVE TO REMIND YOU TO BE VERY NICE TO HIM AS HE’S STILL RECOVERING FROM POOR ‘FOO-FOO’ FINALLY DYING OF OLD AGE LAST YEAR.
Still, in short order the grounds were cleared of students, and teachers were quickly taking defensive positions across the grounds.
“Dude! I get you man. But you can’t fight them, the adults, the singles, they’re like everywhere and they have all the power. And they really, don’t get it.” Lysander soothed him.
Draco turned quickly, tossing a pleasantry over his shoulder to the boys, and was at his husband’s side in seconds.
Draco held his wand carefully behind his back as his mother and her sister curtsied deeply. Bringing his hand around slowly, wand still stretched out behind his leg, his left hand with the Malfoy ring stretching out for first his mother to kiss, then Bellatrix…
know that’s not proper procedure. If you want to make amendments to the proposition you have to make a motion while it’s in committee, not in the middle of a vote.” Granger was lecturing.
“Abuse/Conflict” (appears to be an expected ongoing interaction, starting with the ritual of pulling hair during the pre-pubescent stage, to frequent argumentative behavior)
The last he saw was Harry’s horrified face turning towards his aunt in absolute fury, and the thunderous magic blasting over his shoulder as his husband cast the killing curse in his defense.
“It was…in first year my father told me to befriend Potter, so hopefully he would be in Slytherin as is proper for a powerful wizard. I knew only what my father told me about him, and my efforts only made an enemy.”
Albus Dumbledore was his protector, his main support in the struggle against the Dark Lord. But Dumbledore was grouped with Severus which meant…
Draco looked down at his son, who stared back unblinkingly. Had Nietzsche’s words found fruitful ground somewhere in there?
“No. But I think when you consider the wording of my Oath, and the nature of the items, you’ll understand how important this task is. What I will tell you is a list of the known wards and protections around each item.”
It was a polite dismissal. The odd tugging at the back of his soul was starting to feel very uncomfortable, and from practice Tom knew he’d start getting very nervous and twitchy in a few minutes if he didn’t deal with the urge.
“It wasn’t for me, father.” Cloud explained hastily. He turned to Tom. “Thomas Marvolo Slytherin, meet my father, Lord Blaise Zabini.”
Lucius had been…difficult since the war. He was still technically a fugitive, though Harry had managed to pull strings to assure a lack of proactive effort to recapture him.
“It was an assymetrical energy exchange, resulting from a unilateral sexual event between two magically attuned but unbonded cores.” Draco said, leaning back and closing his eyes. He was still dizzy and definitely shaken from the near-catastrophe.
“But...fine, I suppose if they wait until they are old enough to be trusted with that. So I suppose Jamie wouldn’t want a contract, then. But what about you, Potter. You’re grown. I’m sure you can see this is a wise mixture for your seed. It’s really the only way to honor Sirius, as well. Would you be willing to agree to your side of the contract, and wait until Jamie grows old enough to…eh…
was Potter’s accidental magic…it stood to reason that eventually Potter would be able to shield himself…and
“The Dark Lord demanded details about our courtship. I had kept this a careful secret from him before, so I had to make it seem I was still working on his behalf all along. I told him of your heritage, and that I thought you could be a powerful ally for him if I convinced you to become Dark.” He told him.
“No my Lord. It is my responsibility alone to select a fitting gifts and present them to my future spouse.”
“Adjunct Prefects, sir. Each Prefect should get an assistant of their choosing, with a badge and similar authority, subject to approval by the Prefect.”
The relationship to Sirius Black, and formal declaration as his heir, was depicted by a hazy line leading to the Black coat of arms, with Sirius’ name below it, and a series of similarly shaded symbols appeared around Potter’s portrait. Draco knew without looking at them that they would represent innumerable magical heirlooms that by rights should be either his or Jamie’s.
“Well, the Gryffindors don’t seem to even know. But whoever it is, it’s controversial. The Golden Trio has been seen arguing more than normal, lately.” Pansy said.
Then he rose to his feet, spun on his heel, and strode to the door, leaving the miserable Gryffindor sitting naked on the tiled floor behind him.
“And what is your stake, young Lord Malfoy?” Voldemort demanded. “Do you wish to join my Death Eaters, only to become subservient to my heir, who despises you?”
Draco repressed a growl of annoyance as he realized the humiliating thought was making him hard under his robes.
“Just imagine Snape’s office blowing up in the middle of the night, tonight, Potter.” Draco assured him. That actually seemed to help.
But it was the right side of the page that confused Draco. It was…his own portrait, showing various scenes of his own face, no doubt directly gleaned from Potter’s memories of their many less-than-friendly interactions.
to be hand-copying pages from Reflections of Inner Glory: A Handbook of Manners for Young Purebloods.
It quickly came to life, and Draco used his remaining good hand to quickly bring himself off, stepping forward as he neared completion. As he came, he heard his own voice squeaking with the force of his orgasm as the final incantation fell from his mouth.
Draco took his shocked husband’s hand and kissed it before gently drawing him towards the door of the cottage.
Draco was getting a very uncomfortable feeling from the picture, somehow. Then he saw it. The picture flickered.
. Arranged marriages aren’t what Muggle-raised wizards and witches do, at least not this one, and probably not Jamie either.”
“Regulus, I hope you won’t neglect to spend time with your father, brothers, and me in our quarters.”
But what about Potter’s status? The Dursley’s certainly didn’t have a status in the Muggle world that was similar to Potter’s status in the wizarding world. Draco wasn’t about to insult his future husband with an under-ranked gift, even in a stupid muggle ritual.
“Stay close, boys – let’s go!” Harry called, and with a chorus of ‘excuse me’, ‘pardon me’, ‘so sorry’ the caravan of wizards, one witch, and an infant made their way through the crowd.
“Hmm. Yes that would fit with the Potter traditions. If I recall James Potter was quite shameless in his pursuit of Lily Evans. It was quite painful to watch, especially since she gave him no encouragement, and in fact could barely stand the sight of him. Still, I suppose it worked in the end. No one was laughing at him during their wedding.”
“This is the ritual. However, the family should be present for the presenting of the final gift, my Lord.” Draco offered. “As well as the bonding itself, which takes place at the same time.”
“Ok, here’s Frankie’s extra pillow. And Reggie, you can have mine of course! Ok, so the plan is to hide in one bed, and when they split up to get each of us at the same time, we all gang up on one of them!”
The Slytherins were very interested in Potter’s possible status as heir of a Founder, although they quite sneered at the idea he could be any kin to their own Salazar Slytherin. Obviously he was a Gryffindor. But the reminder of even this dubious honor had them quite buzzing about the changes to the complex system of blood-politics that such a royal marriage would inevitably create. But…to
“First thing when we got here. That Sorting Hat is a real asshole, dude. Lorcan’s in Ravenclaw. Sorry I missed your Sorting, the ‘rents had us in Australia hunting down a Snorkack – between you and me I think it might be a myth, Gramps has been trying to find one since before I was born – and the Intercontinental Floo left us all in Mungos with hangovers. Always use a Portkey unless it’s local, dude.”
“Well, you’ve gone to school with me for nearly six years, you should know I’d have a more complex agenda than that.” Draco said, feeling insulted.
“Okay. There are two items I need you to recover, in two locations. I think you’ll know what I want them for when you analyze them. Suffice to say that I know what use they’ve been put to and I don’t approve in the least.” Draco said.
Draco wondered if the relationship through Jaimie could have affected Potter’s familial loyalty to Draco without Potter being aware of that relationship? This was the only rational explanation Draco could think of. It certainly was something that deserved close consideration – familial loyalty and it’s interactions with magic were the very bedrock of pureblood politics, and if they could operate outside of
Draco tried to take his hand in his, but Harry crossed his arms defensively in front of himself, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes.
Lucius froze. He supposed, considering the new Malfoy-Weasley friendship his son had forged, she should be considered family. He turned towards her, an ironic smile tugging at his lips.
Draco veered off to avoid another collision, leaning close to his broom to increase the speed. He had to put some distance between them or Potter was going to land them both in St. Mungos for a week.
There was an intake of breath, and Draco waited for Harry to panic at the mention of a proposal. What he’d read made it apparent that the romance usually went on for months before mention of a proposal was made, among muggles.
And now, the Potters were suddenly back on the scene, their previous disgrace quite muted by the fact that the Lord Potter was also the Lord of the Great and Noble House of Black…and the bloody Boy-Who-Lived…and on top of those was now being publicly acknowledged by an unknown suitor as the Heir of either Gryffindor or Slytherin, depending on who you asked.
Sexual play with Harry Potter was…different. Different because, while the sex was mind-blowing in itself, the pure natural physical sensations were a mere channel for the rushing tide of sex magic that completely overrode every conscious thought.
Draco felt his wand slip suddenly from his grasp and stared at his boyfriend accusingly as the twins suddenly grabbed him from behind.
His hand slid forward to the top of the thigh, and he could feel Harry trembling under his touch. He realized he himself was trembling and his penis was painfully hard inside his trousers.
The mortal insult successfully delivered, he grabbed his blushing husband by the hand and dragged him out of the hospital wing before the stupid Gryffindor could stammer out some sort of
Draco watched him carefully, noticing how his hands just barely shook as he took out the single, long-stemmed rose, not seeming to notice the pinpricks of the thorns as he raised the bloom to his face. Eyes fluttering closed to inhale deeply…
“So people just fly around on them? It seems hard to get away from a flimsy piece of magical wood as the only thing between you and the ground!”
“Oh. We’ll enjoy it, both of us. And then when my magic has soothed yours and yours has reinforced mine, you’ll have much more control and I’ll have much more base power. Then after that when we touch each other it’ll just be small balancing and recycling exchanges that are exciting but not uncomfortable. I’ll just have to make sure I survive the initial exchange.”
did it, and those who are familiar with the base theories of physical magic…to work together as a research team.” He added smugly.
“Merlin’s College was started in order to open a new frontier in our way of thinking about how the universe works on a very basic level. Einstein started mainstream scientists down this road when he propounded his Theories of Relativity, and many other highly-respected scientists have developed those loose theories into a much more evolved understanding of reality. But those scientists merely touched upon an area of study that is very, very old and was unfortunately disavowed by the scientific community for centuries.”
Draco stormed into Malfoy Manor like an icy wind, his robes swirling crisply behind him as his feet snapped down harshly onto the polished marble.
“Don’t forget the swear jar, Harry.” He called out to his husband, and was pleased to hear the clink of a Galleon joining its brothers in the jar a moment later.
“It’s better than to the death, I think. Ironic that your father put your family in this position in his effort at revenge, but I cannot do anything for that, I’m sorry.”
“But…that’s impossible. Linear and circular motions are incompatible. Everyone knows that.” Draco objected.
The girl huddled with some others for a moment to discuss the fact that the magical records of Hogwarts had apparently been taken in by his fraud, somehow.
“That’s what she said.” James insisted. “Anyways, they’re supposed to be coming for a sneak attack tonight and we were all ready for them. Sorry you got caught in our trap – but maybe now we could outnumber them? Who’s this?”
“The Dark Lord told you many things, just before he failed to kill him. More than once. The Dark Lord is a failure, a half-blood without even the benefit of a Mudblood mother.”
The pair goofed off for a blissful minute. Blaise swaying about while tickling Draco mercilessly while he continued to squeal and squirm helplessly against his grip. Damn Blaise for being a full foot taller than him!
"Sweet thing, you don't have to apologize, especially not for something you didn't do. I'm alright, I've had worse," Harry said as he wrapped a hand around Draco's and brought it to his lips. He kissed his fingertips, his palm, the soft inside of his wrist just where his pulse was at and hummed quietly. He loved kissing his wrists, feeling his pulse on his lips, reminding himself that Draco was here, was real, was
Draco gets quiet after that. He gets caught in the memory of this little eleven-year-old boy with dark hair and fierce eyes storming up to him in the corridor in defence of his friends. He hadn't drawn his wand but held up his fists instead and called Draco a bully, an arsehole, a bloody racist bigot. Told him off for being a coward for having something so
He misses the closeness of it. That's why he and Harry are sharing the same air right now. It's why he can't bring himself to pull away from where their heads are bent together, lips grazing over each other, breath mingling.
." Draco's nose wrinkled at his parents' public display and he grimaced as Papá kissed Dad square on the mouth and looked straight at him whilst doing so.
and you will stay here with me." She huffed curling her elegant fingers around his wrist to tug him back.
"Thank you, but are you ever going to quit using pet names on me, Harry?" Draco blushed softly at having brought the subject up. Harry found his pink dusted cheeks adorable.
He looked up to find Lucius raising his wand at not him, but Draco with a malicious and manic grin on his face. Harry's eyes flared, his hand clenched around his wand as he lost complete control of his emotions which set off his magic as well. A strong wind whipped around him as he marched towards the Malfoy patriarch, a murderous look on his face.
at me," Blaise said firmly and Draco found himself listening to his command. He knew better than to not respond when Blaise used his full name.
Draco bit back an apology and opted for a sympathetic smile instead. He hated it when people apologized, he figured Dudley might feel the same.
!" Draco said, his voice cracking as he dragged his hands up to furiously wipe at the tears beginning to fall. He thought saying everything quickly and impersonally might make it more palatable. It hadn't. He was still rendered a crying child around both his parents and these two. Screw Nott for adding to his trauma.
Draco found himself being used as a shield on both ends as Blaise and Theo antagonized Pansy and she continued to slap at them. He shook his head fondly at his silly friends.
A shiver ran down his spine as the air of the chamber hit him. Harry leant back into his throne and raked his eyes over his pet's beautiful body, taking in every inch of creamy white skin. His fingers itched to touch and mark him in every way possible. The poor thing was trembling in his lap, his pretty pink cock hard and leaking precome, face flushed with tears in his eyes from his desperation.
Right as Harry had resolved himself to silently pouting in the midst of the two couples make-out sessions, as Hermione and Pansy joined in, Draco came barreling into the compartment. His pretty blonde hair strewn everywhere and his cheeks tinted a lovely shade of pink.
-yes, sorry. I should have been more careful." Draco apologized, giving the boy a brittle smile as he yanked his hand away.
"And don't be daft about it, don't get yourself hurt!" Pansy added quickly as he slipped out the door and headed for the lift once again.
Harry took a deep breath. He fixed kind yet firm eyes on Draco. He dropped his hand away from his cheek and tightened the one already around his waist.
She settled herself on the other side of Draco and tugged his hand into her own. Blaise raised an eyebrow at her but she ignored it in favour of grabbing Draco's chin, forcing him to look at her. He sniffled a few times, the tears having calmed down quite a bit in the last few minutes.
Whatever the drink was, it burned on the way down and tasted weird, bitter almost. Draco gulped it down and pulled away coughing. It was nasty. He'd never liked alcohol. It gave one too much of a possibility of losing control and he needed to be in control. Especially now since he'd lost it for so long.
No touching be damned! If he got punched for trying to comfort his boyfriend, then so be it. Draco grabbed Harrys’ wrists softly, pulling them away from all the glass. And he watched as Harry’s entire body stiffened, eyes shutting so tightly it almost looked painful.
But he looks tired. The bags under his eyes are darker, deeper, and his skin is more sallow. He's paler than he once was, his brown skin no longer looks dusted in gold and sunlight but his hair is the same disaster of dark raven curls. It never changes even when the rest of him does.
Harry nodded dumbly as he followed Draco out of the bedroom. Harry silently lead him downstairs and towards the front door.
"I'm going to give you money to help pay the rent, put Harry into therapy, whatever it is you need."
"Please." He whimpered one last time before screwing his eyes shut and pretending this wasn't real. No one was going to hear him over the music. But he couldn't
know that my mother will sue your arse for all your worth before your father ever lays a hand on me." Blaise interrupted, his tone calm, almost bored. He wrapped a protective arm around Draco and shot Harry a withering look before turning to the blonde. Blaise raised a questioning eyebrow at Draco.
They never mentioned Harry's home situation. Draco never asked and Harry never offered an explanation. Although, the bruises that would appear all over Harry's body, at least the visible one's, made Draco itch to swoop in and play the hero. Every time he noticed a new one he had to bite his tongue to stop himself from asking. Either way, he enjoyed Harry's company and he wasn't about to ruin that with his compulsive need to fix everything and help people. At the very least Draco knew that Harry felt safe the few hours he spent at his flat. And for now, that was enough.
Like he hadn't just admitted to being in love with me or nearly kissed me! And he hasn't spoken to me since! What in Merlin's name am I supposed to
"Surprise, darling!" Pansy nearly shouted, pulling Harry away from Draco the second they made it to the table and planting a kiss on his cheek. "Draco and I managed to track these two lovely people down for you."
"You are happy here. Right mate?" Theo asked quietly, after a beat or two of silence, his and Blaise's hands tangled together. Draco smiled at them out of the corner of his eye. He knew, as much as they liked to say they were casual, that they were end game for sure. He and Pansy had even gone as far as to discuss what their future wedding might look like.
to have Ron catch you. If I were to guess as to why, I’d say you were getting tired sharing, you’ve always been immensely greedy over people.”
She shook her head and scoffed at him as he stood smoothly, elegantly, so unlike the way he had thrown himself into the chair earlier. He’d since regained his composure and he knew it would displease her more if he was calm in his actions and words. Calm and collected in the face of her wickedness was something she
Harry hiccuped looking like he wanted to shrink into himself. He kept his eyes firmly shut, but didn't resist Draco's touch as he brushed the broken pieces out of his hands.
"You'll be fine, Cub. And if anything happens we'll be right here across the street." Dad said softly, as he held onto Draco a little tighter.
At the beginning of the night, the entire group had been piled together for food and drinks. The entirety of which Draco was happy to sit back and listen to them tell stories only speaking to exchange a few words with Luna and Ginny. It had been fine. They were all nice enough but they had long since finished eating and now he felt like he was some sort of burden. An imposter amongst friends.
"I don't deserve to li-live, I-m sor-ry for being the-the cause of all the de-death and for living when they-when they all di-died," Harry gasped over his words trying desperately to catch his breath but finding himself unable to do so. Draco simply and calmly continued to rub Harry's back soothingly waiting for the green-eyed man to get ahold of himself.
"Hmm?" The ginger-haired boy looked up from his phone and glanced at Harry who was staring blatantly at his new neighbour across the street.
Draco listens to Harry's steady breathing and the familiar sound of his heartbeat. He hasn't felt this calm in months. He can't wait for this war to be over.
Harry pulled the other boy off of him and faced him fully, everyone else in the compartment falling away from his mind. There was a meaningful glint in his eyes as he reached out a hand to brush a few loose strands of blonde behind Draco's ear.
"Until you tell me otherwise, I'm sure it was just the wind. And I'm in flat 1C, in case you needed it. Have a goodnight, Harry."
It was a few days after winter break, and so far it had been rather uneventful which was, in Harry's opinion, an extremely good thing. No one had confessed their undying love for him, no one had spread any rumours about his relationship, and no one had harassed Draco either. So far things were looking very good.
In the end, Harry hadn't been prepared for how gutted he would feel after the interaction. He dragged himself to the nearest apparition point feeling exhausted. Let someone else deal with his best friend's marriage that was falling apart and all of the unasked for feelings that seemed to come along with it. All he wanted was to fall into Draco's arms and take a nap, which is exactly what he did the second he apparated back to their flat.
He couldn't think. He was trembling, his eyes closed, eyebrows furrowing, as he tried to listen to Luna's words but every deep breath he tried to take turned into a gasp for air and he felt like he was drowning. His heart was beating so fast he thought it would explode or beat right out of his chest. His mind was racing and he couldn't process when one thought began and another ended. He felt like he was dying. His body hurt, it hurt so bad.
The heated kiss ended far too quickly when Harry's attention was brought back to the others in the compartment with them.
"P~please," He moaned, throwing his head back with a particularly hard thrust up. Harry groaned at the pale expanse of his neck. It was covered in nothing, but his collar and a ring of love-bites he'd sucked above it. Fuck, his pet was gorgeous.
Draco's heart jumped at the words. Harry didn't think he was difficult, he had been joking, picking fun. And he had thought that a small part of him had even known it, but it was reassuring to hear. There'd been a time where Draco probably would have snapped back with something far worse than being called difficult.
As he spoke, Draco pulled Harry away from the mess and over towards the bathroom. His heart hurt as he watched how absolutely terrified Harry was. Draco made him sit down on the toilet and he crouched down in front of Harry releasing his trembling hands.
." Draco snapped with a roll of his eyes as he snuggled up against Harry once again. Which Harry did
"What did you say, love?" Harry asked slowly, carefully, as though he might break whatever trance the blond was in. His green eyes stared intently into silver ones as he spoke.
“Oh, bugger off! Go console your heartbroken brother!” Draco snapped, his hands coming up to cover his flushed face. The twins walked away laughing and only when they exited the room completely did he drop his hands to glare down at his soon-to-be husband.
Harry stood boneless as he watched Draco and Ron interact. He'd never seen his fiancé act gentle with anyone other than him. Especially not Ron. They'd never been so familiar before. Everything was just off.
"NO! Draco, my love, please! Please, he didn't-he didn't mean it! Lucius tell him. Tell HIM!" Narcissa cried desperately, looking wildly between her son and her husband. Lucius stared blankly after Draco and said nothing.
"It's alright, Draco. It's okay." She said stroking his hair and his back comfortingly. He felts like a child.
Harry noted that he looked like he was preparing himself for some sort of bodily attack. He stepped back and put more space between them putting his hands up in a placating way. He wanted to seem as nonthreatening as possible.
"Was it?" He couldn't help himself as he interrupted, "A one-time thing, Hermione? It doesn't seem like it was."
“We aren’t in school anymore, Pans, you cannot toy with people so easily anymore and you certainly cannot lump them all together. Everyone grew up,
"Er, mind showing me to your bathroom?" Draco asked, trying his best to keep the polite smile on his face. It had been a while since he'd had to actively interact with so many people and seeing Luna for the first time since he'd frozen her out had taken a toll on him. He needed a moment to himself.
When Draco managed to get Harry off of him, he settled him on the bed and went to get his first aid kit. Before he could get more than a few steps away, Harry snatched his sleeve and Draco turned to face him.
He stood up, stretching out his long limbs, then leant down to kiss Harry on the cheek. The action was accompanied by a few whispered words as he lingered, lips nearly pressed against Harry’s skin as he spoke.
Draco sighs and leans forward till his head rests against Harry's, eyes closed. He strokes his thumbs over Harry's jaw. He needs to shave, Draco can feel the stubble growing in again. It makes him smile faintly, remembering the first time Harry had let Draco shave his face for him. It felt like a lifetime ago when in reality it was a little over a year ago.
"Thank you, Draco," Harry whispered softly, a small smile settling on his face. Draco grinned back and nodded again.
instead of Hermione like he usually did, nodded once, and went to grab her. He pulled Hermione towards their front door and pushed her out into the hall as she babbled at him, no doubt trying to explain herself. Which Draco ignored in favour of going over towards Ron and pulling him into another firm hug.
"It's going to be okay. Come now, love, let me clean you up a little, please?" Draco softly asked, when Harry refused to let go of him when he tried to pull him off. God, everything about this broke Draco's heart.
"Are you sure? You're alright?" Draco asked the doubt evident on his face as he laced his fingers together hoping to distract himself from the worry filling his stomach.
"Oh, I'm uncouth, am I? How's this for uncouth?" Balise shot back, a grin settling on his face as he went to dump Draco unceremoniously on the ground only to be interrupted midway by an angry voice that startled them both.
"No, Harry, love. This isn't your fault. I should've helped you sooner and you did your best, sometimes surviving is all we can do," Draco said, tucking Harry's head under his chin and running a hand up and down his arm, "And it's okay to ask for help when we need it."
"What? Don't you want to go to our bed chambers?" He lowered his voice seductively, "You know how I love to taste myself on you when I eat that pretty little arse out. Don't you want that, my beautiful pet, hmm?"
They both shot up, gawking at him, wide-eyed and shocked. Ron was dishevelled, to say the least, his hair sticking up at odd ends, cheeks flushed a dark red and huffing deep breaths before he took a large gulp of air and fixed Harry with a dark look. Oh, Merlin.
come here. To explain or apologize. It's only a matter of time." Draco said, stroking his thumb over Ron's hand.
Harry chuckled darkly and stilled his hips suddenly. His pet whined piteously and tried to grind down on him. He tutted at him and held him fast before Draco got the chance to. Harry used skilled fingers to untie the red silk around his torso and let it fall away, leaving Draco bare and exposed.
Harry cuts him off with a kiss. It's slow and soft and mournful. A lot of what they do now feels that way. It feels as though they're always grieving for the carefree love they never got to have.
as he slowed, trying to stop himself from coming. Harry smiled endearingly at him. Always such a good pet, even when he was so blissed out he could hardly breathe.
It was bloody Potter. The other boys stood looking just about ready to maul Blaise. Potter's eyes were alight with something akin to murder and attack. His hands clenched into fists at his sides. The unasked for show of bravado that he was supplying left Draco feeling exasperated, his good mood souring. Apparently, Potter was set on nannying him in his own driveway as well.
. My arms are tired, hurry it up. There are only so many places in this tiny flat to hang this!" Theo groaned, a pout settling on his face. Draco laughed loudly and waved his hands at them in a dismissive manner.
"I warned you, didn't I?" He hissed with a look that could have made any and every one of the students present in the courtyard turn tail and run. He could hear them gasp at his actions and the faint click and flash of a camera going off somewhere to his left. A small part of him realized this would certainly make the front page of the
Something looking oddly like disappointment flashed across his face as he pushed off of the wall. If Draco wasn't on the edge of a break down he might've snapped at Harry about how unfair it was of him to look like such a kicked puppy, simply because he had asked him to not hover.
? What happened? Why were you out so late? Why didn't you answer your phone? And why do you look like you've been crying, Draco?"
"Well? Go on, what's so important that you feel the need to threaten the person I'm hanging out with?"
Harry frowns and pulls Draco's hands towards his lips. Draco feels the horror wash over him before Harry gets the chance to finish what he's doing.
, Pansy!” Draco ground out as he began to walk back and forth in front of her. He twirled his wand between his fingers rapidly and shook his head as he paced.
"Yeah, alright," Harry babbled, face feeling flush and mind fuzzy from the kiss, a dopey grin settling on his face, "I suppose I do have a 'bloody hero complex', but I'll only admit it as long as you keep snogging me like that."
. And I can't make sure of that if you won't tell people. You promised you would stop. Please, Draco, I can't-"
“You don’t even like her.” Draco voiced his thoughts after a long drawn out silence. Pansy clicked her tongue and fixed him with a look.
Throwing one more sly look at him, Draco suavely walked out the door leaving Harry with a dazed look on his face and his heart beating wildly in his chest.
He tuned into Lucius Malfoy's shouting then, his voice rising even louder than before. It bounced and echoed throughout the courtyard, grating Harry's nerves.
try and hurt someone. Even if the idea of hurting Vernon gave Draco great satisfaction it wouldn't help the situation. Theo would only go on about how Draco shouldn't put his nose where it wasn't wanted and leave it be. He always made it a point to tell Draco that he couldn't save everyone and trying to do so only hurt him in the end. Bloody hell, he didn't want to deal with that.
"That's-that's really amazing, Draco, I'm happy for you." Harry stuttered, a nervous smile playing on his lips, he was hyper-aware of how
Draco hadn't seen Pansy and Blase since they'd moved two weeks ago. The trio had texted and called and video chatted since he'd left but it wasn't the same. So, against his better judgment, he conceded.
him, father. I'd snog him right here in front of you both, like kissing him was air and I was drowning. I'd let him touch me like I'd die without his hands all over my body and I'd make you watch if I could." He spat, venom dripping off of every word as he went. His mother, seated just next to his father, both conveniently out of his reach, looked as though she might faint and that only seemed to fuel his rage further. Her passivity in all situations was driving him absolutely
Remus immediately began running his fingers through his hair, softly getting the tangles out of it and Draco relaxed further into his lap. The sight might have been endearing if the silence and lack of answers weren't leaving him feeling unsettled. Sirius gave Remus a nervous look, as he tapped his fingers on his knee and his husband matched it with worried eyes as he bit the inside of his cheek.
After situating their son on the sofa with a quilt and a pillow, Sirius was dragged into the kitchen by the wrist.
Harry glanced up at him when he spoke and bit his lip like he was stopping himself from responding. So, Draco continued,
"You won't. I've got you, my darling, my Draco. I'm here, just let go. I'll keep you safe." He speaks it like a promise and the word safe is what does Draco in. It's all he wants. All he's wanted for a long time. Safety.
The man growled, his beady eyes narrowing so much that they were only slits. So that was how this was going to go.
He stood on his tiptoes and locked his hands around Harry's neck, standing mere inches away from Harry's face. Harry's pulse quickened at the closeness of it all and his hands naturally fell to the blonde's hips.
Draco wanted to disappear. He never should have come to this party. He should have let Harry wait for him outside of the bathroom. Why had he been so stubborn? Anything would have been better than this. This was humiliating and this boy kept
"You, you, m~master! Please, please, fuck me, master!" The pale blond whimpered and panted, writhing against his lap, pulling Harry's fingers further into his hole. His pet's body

his arms. His squirming seemed to do nothing to deter Theodore from what he wanted as he pulled both his and Draco's shirts off easily.
had forewarned them. It made his chest feel warm knowing how thoughtful that had been. The rest of the boys nodded and walked a few paces out but not before Harry shot Draco one more lopsided grin. He really did have the face for a romantic comedy. The thought left a funny feeling in Draco's stomach which he ignored in favour of turning to the blonde boy and speaking.
"What time is it?" Draco shrugged the bed covers off and was about to make a dash for the door when he realized his shoes were gone.
"Yes, I'll get started on tea, while you three finish hanging that painting," Draco said, wandering into his kitchen. A satisfied smile gracing his lips.
Draco hadn't been this tense or exhausted since that monster of a man and the thought of something bad enough happening to cause this was making Sirius freak out. Draco didn't seem to notice his steadily rising panic and firmly shut his eyes, the unease slowly leaving his body.
"No." Ron said softly, in a subdued tone that was so unlike him, "I-I don't know how I would react. I'm not sure what I would say, or do. I-I think-I think it would break me."
"Sure, whatever you say, Golden Boy," Draco smirked and walked over toward his front door, leaving Harry in the grass. "Try not to attack any of my other friends, should you come across us messing around."
And he's right. Draco would kill them and every other nasty Death Eater if he could. He would fight them with everything he had if he could. Throw every dark and dangerous curse that Aunt Bella taught him right back at her and revel in her suffering for what they did. Draco can feel the anger thrum under his skin but it simmers down into anguish again with the way Harry sighs. The way his pretty face smiles at him mournfully.
to say is that you can hardly blame Draco for the radio silence if you didn't reach out to him either, Harry." Hermione said giving him the
"You really do just say whatever comes to mind don't you?" The blonde quirked an eyebrow at him in question. He looked amused more than anything. Harry's face blazed with embarrassment.
"Look," Harry handed Draco his phone which he took without another thought, "look, Harry. Thank you for helping me with all this, but I need to go home."
him in. Opening up and making room for him. He looked so pretty and needy. His eyes screwed shut, back arching away from Harry, hands clutching onto his shoulders urgently. He was so pliant and desperate and open, just for Harry. So very, very beautiful.
Sirius sighed and pulled his stressed husband towards him. He wrapped his arms around his waist and leant their foreheads together.
"Alright, alright, it's fine right there. Set it down and we'll have some tea and biscuits." Draco said, smiling as they put it down with grumbles and Pansy walked over swatting at both of them.
Harry chewed on his lower lip worriedly. He'd only ever met Draco's mother, a lovely witch who was equal parts elegant, kind, and fierce. No wonder she had left Mr Malfoy. He was vile, cruel, and pathetic. The complete opposite of the refined woman she was.
Tears wet his face, trail down his cheeks in torrents. He opens his eyes to blink them away. It doesn't work. His hands tremble violently and he tries to draw away from Harry. He doesn't want to hurt him on accident, doesn't want to scare him. He knows Harry won't let him go far so he settles for putting his hands over Harry's heart again, leaving their heads bent together. At least this way he won't accidentally scratch his face with his shaking hands.
"Go on! Go on, tell me how much I disgust you! Make it so much bloody fucking easier for me to leave. Just say it already! I know you want to, I can see it on your face, go on, father. Tell me you can't stand the sight of me! Tell me I'm such a disappointment, a burden, an ingrate, all because you can't accept that your son's a fucking fairy, a bloody poof! So fucking
"Coming Uncle Vernon! I have to go, sorry again." Harry replied, turning to go back in and closing the door in a rush. Draco shook his head and sighed. He could be imagining all of this. Maybe Harry was just shy and maybe nothing had truly happened. He didn't know all of the facts. He could just be over assuming and seeing something that wasn't there. Draco shook his head once more and headed back towards his flat.
It's stained with the Dark Mark and scars from where he's tried to scratch off his own skin. It's shameful, and it makes Draco want to pull away again. He doesn't though. He's more here than he was before. More in his body and less in his mind. Harry's heartbeat always seems to bring him back faster than anything else. It's why they send him to get information and not someone else. And they promised never to run from each other. He isn't going to break that promise now.
Then a gasp, it seemed Hermione and Parkinson had finally noticed his presence. It almost made him scoff, almost. Hermione jumped away from the other woman like she'd been burned and stumbled over her words.
"Draco, I didn't- I didn't know where else to," Harry gasped, "He said he was going to...he h-had a knife. I don't-I don't want to d-die."
"Devious today, aren't we? Sorry, love, we still have to go." Draco said with a smile, landing a quick peck on his still pouting lips. "Please get dressed, I'll make you your favourite tea if you do."
"Yes, well I appreciate her for what she's done for me, but she ought to make more of an effort. Who has a child only to-"
The phone hung up with a quiet click and the prospect of dinner with Harry and his family left him feeling a little fuzzy and warm, a small smile hung on his lips as he set the phone down in favour of finding his parents.
will be the one in Azkaban." He growled lowly, his heart pounding, eyes narrowed, and a cruel curl to his lips. No one dared touch him, his hair standing on end, magic angrily crackling around him.
Ron took in a ragged breath as Harry set a hand on his shoulder and rubbed it in a comforting way. Whatever had happened had really taken a toll on him.
"When she does, do you want to listen to her? Speak with her at all?" Draco asked, finally managing to bring himself to face Ron who wore his emotions on his sleeve. He looked so deeply sad, betrayed, it almost hurt Draco to see the look on his face. The least he could do was handle Hermione once she arrived ready to beg for forgiveness.
no less. You've truly tarnished yourself, Draco." Lucius drawled bitterly as he looked down at Harry with the utmost disgust, his lips curling nastily.
-love me anymore?" His voice broke a little and he looked so small. Smaller than Harry could ever remember him being. Draco stood looking like a ghost, silently shaking and Harry could see the panic and unshed tears in his eyes.
Draco sat on the floor for what felt like forever as he calmed himself down enough to breathe somewhat normally. Holding onto the thought of seeing Blaise and Pansy again seemed to help settle his nerves, he couldn't wait to see them, even if this torturous party was the cost.
He could definitely see the resemblance with their all too blonde hair and silver eyes. But wasn't Draco, adopted? He'd have to be, he had two
The next morning Papá and Dad hadn't said anything about him hiding out in his bedroom the rest of the night but he knew they were worried. They kept shooting glances at each other during breakfast when they thought he wasn't looking. He knew he wasn't subtle when upset, he knew that, but sometimes he wished he was. Maybe then Harry wouldn't be trying so desperately to reach him.
to write for class) so instead I'll just say thank you for reading. I hope you enjoy the chapter! <3
"Gorgeous, your parents love you, so, so, so, much. I've seen the way your mother looks at you, the way she lights up when you enter the room. All she wants is you to be happy, love. You must know that, I know you do. Hmm?" Harry said as he put his hand back onto his waist and gave him a small smile and hopeful look. Draco let out a shaky breath.
"I am so terribly sorry for the carnage, my king," Draco pouted, his pink lips quirked downwards, eyes going watery, "However can I make it up to you, your majesty?"
Hermione looked awful. Her hair was wilder than usual, thrown up in a messy half-bun and her dark skin had taken on a pale complexion, almost like she'd fallen ill. She gave Harry a weak smile and fiddled with her menu absently.
Harry and them had met up for an early dinner the day after he'd had the whole fiasco with Draco and his friend. And he had just finished explaining what went down, which had incited Hermione's wrath.
The couple held each other for a long while after, neither ready to let go of the other quite yet. Dinner was left forgotten on the cold stove.
Too afraid it might make him realize his mistake and make him leave. Make him hate Draco. He doesn't believe he would survive that. Doesn't believe he would
"Hmmm." Draco hummed quirking a mischievous eyebrow at the boys who sent him ice-cold glares in response.
"Hello, what can I get you both today?" The witch asked, she held a notepad and quill ready to write.
"Hermione, you are the most brilliant person I've ever met. And I've known you for a very long time. You don't make a decision without thinking it through at least a dozen different times. This wasn't an accident and you can't blame it on Ron being deployed. Maybe the first time wasn't intentional but you chose her every time after. And you chose her over him."
apologize for something you don't control. Certainly not for being triggered. We didn't know, now we do. We'll be more careful, hmm?" Draco said stroking his thumbs over Harry's face. Harry gave him a weak smile and nodded.
Harry's eyebrows knitted together and his green eyes shone with worry as he watched the older wizard shout at Draco. He was slightly taller than Draco with the trademark silvery blond hair of a Malfoy that reached far past his shoulders. A permanent snarl stayed on his lips almost like a wolf baring its teeth, and that fact alone made Harry feel even more unsettled at the thought of this man yelling at Draco. He also took notice of the cane the man held that had a snake’s head as the handle, no doubt a wand hidden inside of it, which furthered his cruel-looking image.
Mione flushed at the compliments and smiled wordlessly. Harry stared, the no touching rule applied to her as well, it seemed. That and he couldn't remember the last time Mione had been stunned speechless, he hadn't thought it possible. And from the looks of it, Ron hadn't either if the withering glare he wore was anything to go by. Harry supposed that meant he was still riding his jealousy kick with Mione.
"Draco," Harry said softly, "Look at me, love. Please?" He raised a hand and cupped Draco's cheek, wiping away a stray tear that had fallen.
“That’s also how you can make it up to me. Now hurry it up, wouldn’t want to keep Mrs Weasley, waiting.” Draco sang as he waltzed out of the room, purposefully swaying his hips as he went, leaving his fiancé on the floor staring after him in rapt attention. He would
"Goodbye, darling," She said, kissing Draco on each cheek before he pulled her into a tight hug which she tried her hardest to squirm out of. "That's enough of that. And I'll see you at school tomorrow, Blaise."
"I'm afraid you'll have to be more specific, my pet. What do you need? From whom?" Harry asked, pressing a finger in alongside the plug. He tugged at his rim, loving the feeling of Draco stretched around him. His pet let out a sharp gasp, eyes snapping open, wide, and pleasure dazed.
"Okay," Draco nodded, letting the conversation fall away. The pair basking in the melancholy of it all and drinking tea. Draco's fingers drawing circles on the back of Ron's hand, hoping to comfort him in the most minimal of ways.
"And if I don't forgive you, hmm?" Dad smiled mischievously, bringing his hands to rest on Papá's hips. "Then I suppose I'll have to make it up to you some other way,
"Come for me, just like this. Nothing, but my cock driving you over the edge. Come, my sweet prince, it's okay. Let me please you."
“You wanker.” He groused only for Harry to laugh and sit up so they sat Draco straddling his waist and Harry wrapping his arms around the small of his back to keep him from falling.
Knows that if he ever asks, Harry will frown and get that painfully endearing confused look on his face and answer back with a question of his own.
"Yes?" The man asked, his eyes flickering over Draco for a second then landing back on the space off to the side of him. He looked so small, skin and bones. His tanned skin looked pale and he had a sweater zipped all the way up, purple and yellow smudges peaking out of the collar on his neck.
Draco's next question was met with silence as he turned to face Harry who silently fiddled with the paddle in his hands.
Harry's stomach dropped at the sight. He knew those signs, his cousin, Dudley acted the same way anytime he heard shouting or glass breaking. He knew what abuse survivors acted like. Fuck Vernon for ever laying a hand on him. Fuck whoever had done the same to Draco.
"F-fuck," Harry gasped, his hips jerking upward, pressing his half-hard cock against Draco's plump arse. His beautiful lover laughed in a lilting voice as he continued to suck love-bites into his skin. As Draco went to undo the fastenings on Harry's dress shirt he grabbed his pet's wrist and forced them behind his back with one hand. The other he curled around his collar, tugging him backward harshly, making his back arch deliciously. He watched his pet bend to his will easily and let out a pleased sound. Harry had the sudden urge to eat him out. Later perhaps.
happened? How many new bruises had Harry received from this last round of beatings? Gods, Draco felt sick. He needed to tell someone before the worry ate him alive.
Draco whispered pulling Harry impossibly closer and holding him firmly. Harry's breath came out stuttered as he listened to Draco speak.
Draco said, voice dangerously low as he walked into the kitchen to grab the still warm kettle that sat untouched on the stove. He didn't even so much as spare Harry a glance as he expected his request to be carried out without a word of complaint. Like clockwork, Draco heard Harry stand and pad his way up the stairs quietly.
"Dance with me, Luv." His words came out more as a statement than a question as he interrupted Draco once again and pulled him up off of the sofa. Oh, Lord.
Draco gave him a look. The loving glint in his silver, moonstone eyes going cold and serious. Nearly murderous. The icy protectiveness sent a pleasing jolt through Harry's body.
"Mister Black, please take Mister Potter to the infirmary." Professor Flitwick said, gesturing to Harry's arm which had a large gash from elbow to wrist. He hadn't even realized he was bleeding. It didn't even hurt. He supposed that must've been the adrenaline. Draco nodded dumbly, a dazed look on his face as he began to pull Harry away from his spiteful father. And Harry would have let him too if Lucius Malfoy hadn't felt the need to open his mouth and speak again.
"Hmmm, I think not," Harry smiled viciously, wrapping his hands around Draco's slim waist and pulling him down, "You started this, pet, now I'll decide when we're finished."
Riddle always picked his words with meticulous care, made sure they were full of fake endearments, and cutting enough to leave Draco believing no one else could ever love him as Riddle did. He didn't think Harry had the focus nor the malicious intent to be able to say such backhanded things.
"Besides, that nice Potter boy came all the way over here to invite you. And you were very rude to him." His dad's voice travelled from the kitchen into the dining room where Draco stood arguing with his papá. He did
Deft fingers run through his hair. It doesn't look how it used to, it's taken on a grey pallor and waxy feeling ever since the summer before sixth year. It's the stress, the bad eating habits. It's not his fault he can't keep food down. It's the nightmares, the way Aunt Bella thought it fun to poison his food every so often for giggles. Draco misses how it used to look. All white blonde and shiny. He misses how soft and feathery it used to feel ever since he'd quit slicking it back with those charms his father had insisted he use. He supposes that's what happens when you become a child soldier, a spy. Things don't get to stay nice or pretty or good.
. Watch this all be some large plot to ruin Draco further. Watch Harry turn out to be just. like. Riddle. Gods, the thought made bile rise in his throat. Draco knew he wasn't like that. Or at least he really hoped. But still, he shouldn't have come here, he should have stuck with-
The third time Draco made his way up to Harry's flat he had never dreaded it more. Whatever had happened, it had been loud. Louder than any sort of yelling he'd ever heard before. He knocked on the door and for the first time, Harry wasn't the one to answer it.
It was a bad habit. A reflex he'd learned to avoid Riddles' brutality. Something about Theodore's demeanour had triggered Draco's submissive survival instincts. He hated it. He wanted to scream and claw out of his grip. His touch
"Yeah, I heard yelling. I wanted to check up on you. Did your...um, what happened to the wall?" Draco asked softly, trying for a comforting smile, but he only managed to lessen his frown a little. He couldn't find it in himself to smile at this.
"Come now, my love," Harry whispered against his neck, nibbling at his jaw, breath ragged as he continued the merciless snap of his hips into Draco's poor, stretched out and sloppy hole. Draco whimpered at his words, hands grasping at his shoulders painfully, nails piercing his brown skin.
The living room lights were on as he walked further down the hall and he found Dad and Papá tangled together on the sofa fast asleep. Dad had his arms and legs wrapped around Papá as if to restrain him and Draco breathed a sigh of relief. Thank the Lord he hadn't managed to get out of Dad's grip.
This time Harry didn't stop himself from peppering his wet cheeks with kisses. He covered his pets face in kisses and he didn't stop till he felt Draco quirk a small smile.
"Not a word." Draco reminded him, tone steady and emotionless as he pulled back the paddle and brought it forward, hard onto Harry's backside.
"What am I going to do? What if he-what if he comes back and tries to...where-where am I going to live?" Harry asked quietly and Draco found himself answering before he could think.
"They will be just as safe at Aberforth’s as they would be here. It's not selfish. You need this," -Draco pulls away to give him a look- "No don't look at me like that, Draco."
They kissed, lips moving in sync, Draco breathing fiery passion and love all into one kiss. And when he finally pulled away, the pair of them breathing heavily, their foreheads resting against each other, he watched Harry's obscenely gorgeous face and murmured softly,
“Is it now? How convenient that you seem to know what unbecoming means yet still managed to snake your way into a married woman's pants! You are such a
"Thank you, Pansy. Would you mind grabbing the first aid kit, it's in the bathroom, under the sink?" Draco said while Harry fell against him once more, wrapping his arms around his torso. She nodded and went off to get it taking Harry's unsalvageable glasses with her.
“Kingsley?” Harry asked, feeling shock bolt through him. The Minister of Magic leered back at him, the expression sitting oddly on his familiar face. “You Imperiused Kingsley?”
Harry felt something large and ugly rise up in him: the same feeling he had gotten when Draco had calmly asked if he should beg for his own money from Harry’s vault.
“Liar!” shouted Miles, and whirled away from Malfoy, towards another corner of the room where, Harry saw with horror, Viola was crouched and cowering. He advanced on her and she whimpered, watching him through wide gray eyes. Harry could see her chest rising and falling rapidly. “Maybe you know, my sweet one,” he crooned.
“Congratulations!” he said happily, raising his glass of water in a toast. “Another year at Hogwarts! They’re lucky to have you.”
“Hermione’s here too,” he said quickly once they were in the hall. “Where do they take new prisoners?”
“This is weird,” Harry said slowly. He glanced up at Draco, who still hadn’t moved. “The Minister wants to know how our marriage is going."
1. I first got stoked about arranged marriage tropes from reading an incredible original fic, The Course of Honor, by Everina Maxwell. Unfortunately I can't link to it here because it has since been taken off AO3, but the good news is that it's going to be PUBLISHED as a real live book entitled Winter's Orbit in the next few years by Tor (see https://www.tor.com/2019/08/13/book-announcements-winters-orbit-everina-maxwell-debut/ for the deets). If you enjoyed this fic, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this book. A lot of inspiration for Harry and Draco's early interactions come from her amazing writing, and I, for one, will be ordering my copy from my local bookstore as soon as it becomes available :-)
, Harry thought with fierce satisfaction. The other man was indeed watching him, had not moved from his place at the table. Slowly, he raised both hands.
Malfoy shifted warily until he was sitting with his back pressed against the stone and his knees drawn up in front of him. The pose made him look younger, as did the fact that his hair was starting to grow out around his ears.
