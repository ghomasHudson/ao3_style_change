With his wand, Harry tried to stun the creature off him but water filled his throat as he opened his mouth, making him choke. Another mermaid grabbed his other arm, locking his place. Holding him under as coughed and gasped for air. Bubbles formed around him as he gasped out the last bits of air, floating up and away from him.
“You mean if it was one us and it was Snape.” Hermione primly snapped. “Professor Davies isn’t the same person, Ron.”
“Not sure but it was a lot. Every other night for probably two or three weeks.” Harry honestly tried to remember but it was hazy, the memory wasn’t so much nonexistent as it felt like it was an event he read about in a book. Something you remember but didn’t happen to you.
“I am an adult.” Harry retorted his own sneer matching Filch’s. The maintenance man’s fist angrily clenched to the handle of his lantern. His normal scare tactics weren’t working. None of them would work. Harry had long ago stopped being afraid of the man.
“Is there anything even worth reading in there anymore?” Ron asked, instantly pulling four large juicy pieces of sausages onto his plate. Hermione hummed, for years now she had read the paper every day, taking note, cutting clippings, compiling anything she that was important. Both the facts of an event and in many ways how the Prophet’s journalists chose to frame those events. She could probably fill her own wing of the library with journalism information, how media spun news, and how to read between the lines, with what she had collected over the years.
That was how he found himself in the Hall of Glass, a thin corridor of high vaulted ceilings lined with opulent stained-glass windows.
“Parvati Pate-“
Harry simply grumbled to himself, collecting his own bag, “Great. First-period Potions, with Slytherin.”
“Yes, Sir.” Malfoy quickly collected up his books and cauldron without looking at a single person as he shuffled out of the room. Professor Davies watched him leave before turning to the rest of them.
“I…” Harry bent in half trying to catch his breath. He frantically tried to come up with a reason to talk to Malfoy, “Last week. Not done with you yet.”
Students turned and pointed at it, confused on why it was becoming more agitated, its circles becoming more erratic and large arcing dives that threaten to nock into heads. Students ducked and Hagrid was quick on his feet, racing over to try and call over the angry avian. The hawk refused to land instead of getting louder and aiming its dives at Hagrid. Soon other teachers were trying to calm the students and bird, pulling out wands and trying to spell it calmly. However, the bird was fast and smart, dodging spells, and hands alike. It clearly wasn’t going to stop for anyone other than Malfoy.
“We are not sure, sir. We found them like this.” Neville admitted, head still in Luna’s lap, his voice was wrecked, raspy and waterlogged. The color in his lips slowly starting to turn back to pink as her warming charms did their job. Mot tilted his head, eyes looking in Neville’s general direction.
“You know what Malfoy." Harry took a step back. "If you won’t tell me then let’s just see what McGonagall has to say.”
Soon the summer started to slip into the fall, the air-cooled, leaves yellowed and the sunlight drew shorter. Halloween was only a week away and the souring nature seemed keen to get into the spirit of the holiday. It was a perfect day to be back in the tower, next to the fire, with a glass of fire whiskey in hand. Unfortunately for Harry, He was in Herbology, which meant he was knees deep in frigid lake water, and quickly losing feeling in his fingers.
“It looks a little burnt from the fire but it’s clearly working.” At least Harry was pretty sure it was. He hadn’t seen anything other than himself, so the reflections were there but the other images weren’t clear to him. Malfoy might be a mad git but Harry truly doubted he had made the plunge into madness so deep that he talks to himself.
“Was it some extremely diabolical plan?” Hermione deadpanned, settling where the girl once had been, under Ron’s arm, throw haphazardly over the back of the couch.
Debris and murky water obscured Harry’s vision as the cacophony of screeching sirens disoriented him. Was he swim in the right direction? Up towards the surface? Down to the lake bed? Everything looked the same and he was losing air fast. The burning in his lungs grew as he kept swimming. He just started to make out the bright red of Neville’s uniform when razor-sharp-clawed hands grabbed him by the arm. The claws dug in, making a smoky looking trace of blood leak from Harry’s opened wound.
Harry reread the first part of the passage to be sure he understood it, “This makes it sound like the mirror is alive.”
Malfoy, seemingly determined in his mission, missed how the suits of armor turned the helmet heads to watched them. The moonlight against the row of suits of armor flashed like hundreds of photographer flashes that descended on 12 Grimmauld Place over the summer. It was a summer that felt like it never happened, Harry felt split at the seams, torn between attending trials, giving interviews and his own desperate attempts to heal.
There was a slight gasp from several students including Hermione, a clear look of concern on her face. In the back of the room, Parvati bent towards her partners whispering rather loudly “Did he just call us bastards?” shocked disgust in her voice.
Every item, from massive bookshelves to the tiniest jewelry box, was blackened, charred and destroyed. Metals objects were pelted past the point of recognition, shattered glass littered the floor and massive still-kindling wood beams were strewn about. Ash still snowed from above, fluttering in the tinniest of air streams, coating every surface and in every crevice.
“I know but there isn’t much I can do.” They had this conversation before, multiple times and outside of refueling a dangerous addiction to sleepless draught, he didn’t have any real options.
“Almost every single night since the year started,” Harry confirmed. “I am not sure if he is doing other things in there but-“
The slamming of a massive book on his table mocked Harry out of his contemplations. “It took me a while to remember where I read it,” Hermione sat down across from him, pulling the book closer to her, “but I finally found the Book.”
Harry gasped, feeling blessed fresh air fill his lungs. The wet stones of the shore cut into his back but they amazing compared to the limp feeling of nothing but water. His head lulled to one side he was staringly blankly into the darkness of the forest. Something was moving. Squinting his eyes, he saw an animal with four legs standing just outside of the deepest shadows. It looked to be a massive black dog. Harry’s mind swirled with dark memories. Rubbing at his eyes, when he looked again it was gone. He tried to shake the odd feeling building in him, focusing instead on his friends.
“I figured out what Malfoy was doing in the Room of Requirements,” Harry admitted to the pair.
“You wouldn’t, they turn to seafoam when they die naturally, usually of old age. They live to about three hundred.” Luna informed them in that breathy way that made it sound like she was speaking through a trance, “Oh, poor thing.” Luna lamented with deep sorrow in her eyes. “So young.”
and 8
Harry and Neville shared a look before Harry finally admitted “She’s right, we could just swim.” It would be way quicker and the slight danger of it captured Harry’s interest. Neville looked less than pleased at the prospect of swimming through the freezing lake waters.
Luna pulled Neville’s head into her lap, petting the hair out of his eyes. “Are you okay?” Between gasped breathes he said yes and gave her his thanks. His lips had turned blue and a shiver racked his body. Quickly Luna pulled out her wand, reciting several warming charms over his wet torso.
Soon the delivery birds were either settled by their kids or had flown back to the Owlery. All except one. Up in the air, circling the Slytherin table was a majestic looking hawk. It was sleek with glistening dark feathers and a viciously sharp little beak. Grasped in its talons was a small bundle of letters, tied together with Silver Ribbon. It swirled in circles and started to squawk in frustration as it couldn’t find its owner. It was looking for Malfoy.
Emptying the last of his coffee, Harry gave the table a warm wave goodbye, refusing to look back at the Slytherins as he left the hall.
Harry scratched his forehead, a headache threatening to start up again, “I couldn’t sleep last night, so I went out for a walk to clear my head and wound up at the Room of Requirements. Think was, the door was already open and someone was in there. Malfoy was in there.”
With a dejected sigh, Neville tossed a rock into the lake’s murky waters, “It’s no luck, The Living Stones are picked clean.” Unfortunately, Harry had to agree, he wasn’t as good at Plant identification as Neville but he could tell when a spot had been scavenged. Dozens of hair-fine roots littered the ground from students ripping the plant out of the dirt with little care.
No one was close to the room of requirements which had its door on display. Clearly Malfoy wasn’t super concerned about hiding what he was doing. Not like anyone would see it in this remote part of the castle. Pushing open the door Harry slipped back inside once more and followed the trail of ash and footprints back to that charred Chinese cabinet.
Thank you everyone for reading and supporting. Like and Comments if you'd like to see more. It really does make my day.
“More reason to be cautious. We don’t know what effects this mirror has on people yet. I just need to find a book. I know I read about this somewhere.” Hermione grabbed Harry’s hand, giving him a meaningful look, “Let me do some research before you tell anyone, Harry.” She had that look of certainty in her eyes, the kind of look she gave when insisting on House elf rights or making a Polyjuice potion that was far more advanced than her years. It was a safe harbor for Harry, a look that told him he wasn’t alone and could lean on someone to help get the work done. Nodding his head, he stood up.
"As I'll ever be."
? And what the fuck is in a
"Potter?"
"In a moment." Harry responds. "I'm trying to find my wallet so that we can go to the mall so that we can buy Hermione's present after dinner."
"Well, thank you for noticing." Harry deadpans.
“Shit.” Draco moaned as he pulled away.
"For starters, I can’t stand listening to those love songs anymore." Hermione tells him. "Every time you fall in love, you blast so many love songs and I can hear them through the wall for two weeks or so. As much as I love them, give it a break."
"Ron, I love you, but not right now."
At that moment, Draco understood that Harry made his decision, and he was going to stand by Harry's decision no matter how much it was hurting him.
"Not unless I can buy you stuff too."
Draco thinks to himself, panicking to himself. He really should have met the guy when Harry asked him to several times during the time they weren't hanging out with each other.
"Alright, I'll get back to you guys." Lavender says as she walks away Ron is ready to ask Hermione questions.
"Yeah, Draco?" Harry replies.
Harry thinks to himself as he strips his clothes off.
"Well, I have to admit it, I'm surprised that you actually had the balls to go out and finally screw somebody that isn’t Malfoy. But we are still missing something. Why did you come in so late?" Ron inquired.
"Dammit. I've looked at all the places that I can think of, and I can't find him at all."
"And this is also a going away party?"
"That'll be fine." Harry says. "Besides, he never stops eating."
"I know, right?" Neville says in agreement before making a face at the smiling baby. "So, what are you thinking when it comes to Draco and Harry, Justin?"
“Harry! HARRY!” Draco screams. When he sees Harry slip out the door, his tears flow freely from his eyes and all he can think about is how both he and Harry are emotionally damaged for one night.
"I thought you'd never ask. I could feel that
"Sorry to burst your bubble, but you do like to drink a lot when you celebrate your birthday." Draco says. "I just- it's- I want you to be able to experience the
"Uh....like what?"
"So, you would've deleted you account if Inferno didn't hit you up?" Draco asked.
"Stop it."
"Excuse me?" An old lady says as she and her husband walks up to them with a smile on their faces. "Could you please tell us the time?"
“Thanks, Sirius. We’ll hang soon so I can tell you how it went. Until then, later Sirius. I love you.”
"Incriminating the evidence on your body? Shame on you!"
"Diaper duty." Draco responded.
“Ugh, that’s annoying.” Draco tells him as he is giggling at the neck kisses.
Draco's face drops.
Draco closed his book.
"Just hear me out. Pretty please, with a hottie on top?" Hermione pouted.
Harry snorts and takes Tori.
"Ok, but only because I'm dying to talk to someone about it." Harry says excitedly.
“My friend.” Harry says high-fiving Ron.
"Justin, what the hell is going on here?" He shouts towards the kitchen as he steps into the shop with Hermione in tow.
"Ha, ha, ha." Harry said. "Anyway, I'm actually looking forward to Christmas. It's my favorite time of year."
"Awesome!" He says while getting half the ingredients out for the lasagna from the refrigerator.
Draco is the one that I would cross the ocean for, because he did the impossible in more ways than one.
"You'll never know what'll happen if you sit here and wallow." Ron tells him. "Now, go buy some food and take back your quality time with Harry." He tells Draco.
“Let’s go to the bed.” Draco says running his hand all over Harry’s crotch.
"Thanks, Har." Draco takes a sip of his beer, then he proceeds to tell Harry his news.
“So what are you going to do? I mean, I can see why you hook up and I don’t blame you at all. He’s good eye candy.”
Harry snorts as he continues to walk through the empty hall.
Very pissed.
"If you want to get away unharmed, get out of my fucking way, Draco!" Harry shouts, gripping his steering wheel even tighter than before.
"Now, let's tackle the rest of that movie and the cake."
"Ah, sookie, sookie now!" Hermione says, while the Ron clapped and cheered with glee while Harry breaks from the kiss and starts laughing.
"Damn the chicken and get your hungry ass in this living room, now!" Hermione shouts.
"Fun?"
“My wingman game is not rubbish, Weasley. My father will hear about this.” Draco says as he dials Harry’s phone.
"As for the cake, I hope I made justice by it as I did use Sirius’ recipe." He tells Draco while grabbing the entire cake, two forks and the wine.
"Cheer up, Malfoy." Ron says sympathetically as he sees the sad look on his friend's face.
Draco finds Sirius’ statement insulting yet true, at least when it comes to the
“Your father is nearly deaf, and he likes me you tosspot!”
Draco smiles a bit.
"Hey, she likes me better than Harry!" Blaise exclaimed happily.
“I’m glad that I can help you remember.” Draco whispers against Harry’s lips.
"So, I got you shirt and some sweats that you can put on." Harry said as he walked into the room.
." Harry said, while blushing. "After that, he offered me a drink."
Draco makes a face at that.
"Alright." Draco said, obviously not believing a word out of Harry's mouth. "Anyway, I put on the outfit that you wanted Tori to wear."
"He’s great." Draco says tensely.
"No, it's just cold, but thank you for asking." The blonde said. "Could you keep me company?"
"Maybe you'll work something out with Harry." Ron tells him, and Draco nods in agreement.
"Anyone out there, Harry?" Justin asked as she came from the back.
"Yes, he will!" Hermione pips. "We can place them both under
"Those crazy kids. I hope he catches up to Harry." Ms. Figg says to herself and she walks away from Harry’s house.
Draco gives him a dirty look.
"Which is....?" James asked.
"Shut up, Ron." Hermione tells him, causing everyone to laugh.
"You tell me." Harry tiredly says. "Like I said, I need to break this cycle of thinking that I will find one guy who will make me happy. I am not going to depend on Prince Charming to come and save me when I can do it myself."
"Aww, Harry! Soon it'll be time for you and Draco to be a couple. Just 5 more months to go! I don't know about you, but I'm definitely excited for that!" Hermione squealed a couple of weeks later when she popped up in his office.
As soon as he was done with the tables, he looked around the empty shop and sighed to himself contently. He figured that not a lot of people were outside due to the heavy rainfall. It was raining so hard, that the drops were hitting the windows, which made him want to grab a cup of coffee and sit at one of the tables to enjoy the rainfall that was currently taking place.
Draco gives Ron a confused look, which makes Ron laugh at him.
"Harry." Draco starts, lifting Harry's head up. "You know that's not true. Somewhere out there, you'll find some who wants to be with you." Unaware that he has been holding Harry's hand throughout Harry's confession.
"Harry, I would really like to talk." Seamus says.
Inferno smiles.
"Hety, cutie pie." Hermione says.
"Hey, Draco.” The bartender greeted. "What can I get you?"
"Damn, this is going to be fun. You're probably going to miss the appetizer course at your dates house, by you'll be right on time for the main course and dessert." He remarks while taking of Flames’ shirt.
Harry pulls Draco by his shirt and pushes him against the nearest wall.
After all the licking, Draco decides to lick into Harry’s mouth.
"Surprise me." Harry says while his voice cracks at the
"No problem."
"Well, you wanted to kill me over a joke just a minute ago!" Blaise exclaimed.
"Why would we do that when it's Mid-November?" Draco asked.
“That’s great to hear. Tell me, what brings you here?”
"Well, as shocking as it is for me to admit this, but you're actually right. I feel so bad for the guy." Ron asks, even though Draco is still oblivious to what is right in front of his face when it comes to Harry.
"I'm not like Harry though." Draco says. "I... I am good with being alone."
"Draco, I take it you'll be having the Avocado Chicken Caesar Salad?"
unreasonable."
"I know, Drakie." Harry says genuinely. "Thank you for always having my back." He says while giving Draco a hug.
A few minutes later after a heavy make out session, Harry starts kissing Draco’s neck, clavicle and nipples.
"Of course you can. So two orders of nachos, a salad and a burger, right?" They group nods. "I'll be back with your orders soon!" Luna tells the group.
"Well I guess it's a crime to asks questions." Harry states.
Ron smiles at her. "Okay, come on." He hesitates for a second but then grabs Hermione's hand leading her to the restaurant.
"Ready to go?"
"It's Harry, remember?"
A blush crept up on Draco, instantly feeling good that he was called babe by Harry.
"You're welcome."
"That you are."
"It'll be a start."
"Me too." Hermione says.
Harry's phone ring.
"Yeah. I promise you that it's nothing against you because you are the most sweetest guy in the world. I just keep thinking that I'll get hurt like I did before."
"Ok." He responds before he opens the door to leave.
Either way, you’ll always be my baby ‘cause you are always there for me no matter what. When I first brought up the idea of the contract, I didn’t think that it would be beneficial to us. All I knew was that I was giving us a timeline to find our one and only’s, but I have to say that the contract was the best idea I’ve ever had because I landed with the man of my dreams, even if it took my head a fucking long ass time to figure that out.
and a
"You don't know me! You can't possibly tell me all of this and get over it so fast. Harry told me that the party was his going away party. The one that I didn't even know about. I guess it's just better if he just leaves and create happiness on his on terms."
"Harry loves that episode!" Draco says, getting up from the couch. "I've got to try and forget Harry. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind." Draco sighs. "I blew it- I really blew it. I took him for granted."
"Meeting or not, I'm happy that you're in a good place, and that you're finally taking a chance on love again, Harry, even if it’s temporary." Ron said with a smile on his face.
"But you forget, Malfoy, I don't go out searching for people with the same unit that I have." Ron reminds him.
Everything.
Now, Ron hoped that this plan would work out. He was happy that they were all free tomorrow, however he wasn't sure as to how Draco would react to Harry's news at all. If he played this game correctly, not only would he not have to break the news to Draco, but he'd also get these two in a room together where they'd hopefully work things out.
Draco simply grins as he puts Tori on her stomach, preparing her for Harry's friends. He hears the door open, followed by-
"Calm down, Blondie. I'm in my room. Did you use the spare key I gave you, or did you pick my lock again?" Harry shouted from his bedroom.
Draco huffs as he tried to read his book, colossally failing.
"Well, he's not asking for our health." Blaise said. "So, what is the plan?"
"That was very fun!" Harry says as he's carrying four bags of items that he insisted on buying for Tori.
Harry licks his lips and places both hands on each of Draco's thighs, pushing them upward so that Draco's knees are on either side of his chest and stretched apart, before he bends over and lets his tongue lick a long swipe between Draco's spread cheeks.
"Did you miss your daddy, pretty girl?" Draco asks as he looks at his daughter who looks up at him.
"Thank you so much you guys. I really am happy." Harry says. "I can't wait for the next date."
"I'll brace for impact." Harry concedes tiredly.
"Don't cry, little one." Draco said as he got her onesie and her diaper off. "Ready to get cleaned up?"
"I really don't have to listen to you." Inferno tells him, showing him the door. "Get lost!" He says pushing Draco through the door, slamming the door in his face.
"You won't as you're staying with me. The weather is still bad and I don't want you or your baby to get sick."
"Well, you never know. You know how Justin's plans turn out. He's lucky Hermione is helping him."
"I'm Inferno. Would you care to come in?" Inferno asks, while moving from the door so that Harry can enter his house.
Harry was in the kitchen putting the final touches on the dessert he made.
"Just give me fifteen minutes."
Draco rubs his temples and shakes his head.
"You wanna help?"
"Goddamn! That was fucking quick!" An impressed Draco says.
Harry makes sure that he is presentable, fixes his button up shirt, takes a mint and answers the call.
"Shit! We used to dance to this song back about a decade ago, remember Malfoy?"
"Nope. Hermione dragged me here."
came out. That song had always, always meant something to me when it came out, but that song is special to me because we shared a special moment in time in our relationship: we gave each other a hot kiss. Well, I gave you a hot ass kiss and then we fucked after wards, but it is what it is. I kept thinking that I wasn’t going to be good or what if it ended so soon and would you compare me to anyone else. I remember that at the end of it, I felt good and that it felt…right. It was an amazing first time and all the other times were amazing as well. No matter what you think, it’s our song because it was the sweetest song that I’ve ever heard in my entire life, and nothing and no one can replace you.
is something that is very valuable to me. I have the best support system that consists of: you, my parents, Sirius, Hermione, Ron, Neville and Luna, and to tell you the truth, I couldn't ask for any better because you're all so amazing. You are the most important people in my life that have always inspired me to be a better person. It is amazing that you all provide me with motivation to achieve my goals, whether or not they seemed like impossible dreams or not. You empower me to make the changes I need to succeed and cheer on my success. Often times, I always think about the qualities that you all have, and I'd also think about several other things when we interact with one another.
"I've been busy." Harry tells him.
"Dang it! Why is it that everyone is dating or finding someone to date?"
"I haven't heard any of the other songs besides
Harry withdraws his fingers and lowers himself down to lick open Draco's stretched hole, just because he can, really. He pushes his tongue in to lube it up more and enjoys the way Draco's tight muscles feel around him. He pulls up after a moment and climbs up to align his aching cock at Draco's entrance, resting his cock between Draco's cheeks as the head of his cock lies right above Draco's hole, desperate to slide in. Harry takes one long look at Draco's sleeping form, noting how peaceful he looks all flushed out with a blissful smile on his lips, and pushes in, not stopping until he's buried balls deep inside his boyfriend.
Hermione nods her head at the idea.
Draco pulls away.
Draco continues to kiss Harry all over, failing to realize that Harry has slightly pulled his pants just past his cheeks.
Harry thinks to himself.
"Hermione, please -and I do mean please- take care of her. You're the only one that I trust with a human life."
The only thing that was on as they were going home was the radio playing in sweet silence, and Harry had never felt to happy in his life. He was extremely happy that this relationship between the two of them was actually moving forward, even if it was at a slow pace.
"I like her too." Harry said.
"Before I say anything, it was not my fault." He starts off, stomach twisting in knots.
"This has been a wonderful night." Harry says.
since you're feeling guilty about it."
"I probably would have loved a date with Armie Hammer or Josh Duhamel, but you are perfectly fine." Draco teased.
"Whatever." He says rolling his eyes at her.
“What happened?” A now worried Draco asks as he hears Harry’s tone of voice change.
Seamus sighs again.
Draco nods at him after he wiped his eyes.
“Finding someone on Grindr.” Harry says, with a smile on his face.
“I’m proud to say that I don’t, but what does it feel like?”
"Where are you going?"
"I’m listening.”
"See, I- I think right now, you feel like you are becoming my personal, permanent unneeded bodyguard, constantly trying to baby me. Had I known that you were going to pull that shit the other night in my kitchen, I should have fucked you up. You’re lucky that you went to his house afterwards, and you’re lucky that I let you walk away, while I was getting myself together for that dinner date. But, bitch, I'm going to let you know, if you ever pull that shit again on me again in the future Draco Lucius Malfoy, that will be your last motherfucking day standing. I promise you that.”
“Well, a
"I know, Malfoy, but everything will work out in it's on own timing."
"That is true." Harry said. He handed Draco his camera before getting on his knees in front of the cooing baby. "Achoo." Harry pretended to sneeze in his elbow.
"Alright, where are we going?" Hermione asks as they walk out of the car half an hour later.
"I don't know about anyone else, but I am." Ron says.
“Must we go through a sea of emotions, Potter?” Draco teases as he notices his best friend tearing up. “It’s just a picture in a fancy frame.”
"Why not give it a shot?" Harry wonders a few minutes later. After all, Draco did know a lot of men, and he's heard that the men that the blonde was with were great guys. Then, Harry frowned. Wouldn't these men be sloppy seconds? In the end, Harry decided to go out with whoever Draco set him up with mainly because he trusted the blonde's judgment. Anything would be better than being alone.
A week or two ago, Harry had been trying to make Tori laugh simply by making faces, but the only thing that he received were smiles. He was about to give up on making Tori smile, until he sneezed into his arm, thus hearing the sweetest sound of laughter erupting from the little baby. That day, Draco owed Harry a dollar for doubting him. Today, Harry was taking Draco out for their very first date and he was ecstatic about it, however Draco was having second thoughts about it since he had to leave Tori in the hands of their friends. Truthfully, Draco liked them very much, but he thought that the guys were bone heads, and he really only trusted that Hermione could take care of Tori. After all, he's seen the guys through a baby doll around one time, and what if they did that to Tori?
"Hmm, let's see," Harry responds with a smile. “I'm officially 35 years old today, I'm in bed right now and I'm talking to you. Life can't get any better than that. How are you?"
I had going on, and that I look more like a
It's impossible.
Draco does the same to Harry.
“I’m finally going to see your husband after how long?”
“Alright.”
"I've just been dumped, for the umpteenth time." Harry sighed. "So it's just me and my chocolate covered strawberries."
Draco nods as he picks up his daughter. He kissed her forehead a few times and he watched her squirm a few times.
A few seconds later before he can turn Harry over on his back, Draco spills his load into Harry.
"I think that after waiting ten years for the perfect man, I feel so stupid and I’ve wasted so much time looking for
"Hello?"
Draco pulls away.
freak he's ever met. Did Harry influence that decision?" Hermione asked the blonde man.
Draco considers this and he nods his head.
"So where exactly have the two of you been? Because I didn't think it would be this hard looking for Harry at all."
Draco's phone goes off.
The alarm is still blasting very loudly.
"After all this time, I've never realized that what I was looking for was right I front of my face." Harry says before humming Mariah Carey's song
And with those words, Draco started to fuck Harry. Every thrust seemed as perfect to the both of them as Draco was thrusting into Harry slowly as if he were worried to break Harry. With every thrust Draco did, Harry moaned in content as every movement had seemed calculated to hit Harry’s prostate. They kissed passionately with every thrust, and with every moment that was passing, Harry was getting more and more reduced to a blabbering mess that Draco thought was beautiful. At one point, Harry simply wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist as he was getting fucked. He dug his fingers into Draco’s back as he gasped out greedily, crying out for more. He shut his eyes tightly as his mind spiraled with colors. He felt as if he would explode with every thrust Draco took as they kissed again.
"I'd say that you're ruining my plan, but I have a plan."
"Care for me or Tori at all. It's just....different, you know? At first, I thought that it was weird that Harry showed me that he cared. I wasn't used to it before, and now, I don't want it to end. Harry makes me feel nice."
Thanks for reading and sharing your comments with me! I truly appreciate you for stopping by and reading, more than you could ever know. I Will Be Back With A New Drarry On September 1st, Y'all. What Do You Think It's Going To Be About?
"It's alright." Harry says. Don't cry over that punkass, douche. You deserve better than him."
"You're making her like you more than me." He says.
Ron gives her a look. "Yes, but where's the fun in it if we don't try each other's meals?"
"I think she likes you." Draco says handing Harry a bottle for Victoria. "She always gets fussy when someone new holds her for some reason."
“Anyway, we still have six months to find Harry a husband.”
"Thank God it's Thursday." He says entering his house. He hung his keys on their designated hook, loosened his tie, and started to scroll through his phone contacts.
Draco nods for a brief moment.
"I might be overreacting, but is your name Inferno?" Draco asks, hoping it truly isn’t Inferno he’s talking to.
“No.” He answered. “We were going to fuck, but the guy freak and went home.”
"You like kissing people that much?"
"It would've been worse if Ron or anyone else told you instead of him." Luna supplies.
Harry was about to say something when he heard whining from the baby on the smaller couch across from them. He quickly gets up, getting ready to pick up the baby who was crying.
“Thanks, Malfoy.” He says, pecking Draco’s lips.
"Wrong maybe, not sad. You just miss him." Ron says.
"Damn you for snooping on my laptop." Harry said before sitting next to Draco. "Anyway, I was also thinking that Tori can have her own room."
"So what will you do with Tori?" Justin asks.
in this situation, Ron? Don’t add me into this." Neville says causing the women to chuckle.
The last two people Harry dated were dubbed a 'complete ass' by Hermione. She had disliked Romilda Vane, and she really despised Cormac McLaggen with a passion. His other friend Neville constantly told him that people, especially Romilda and Cormac were simply using him for money, but he didn't understand it until it was too late. As soon as they got what they wanted from Harry, they broke up with him and he was left with his heart, which was completely broken. Blaise, Harry's other friend, would always tell him that they were gold diggers, and in the end, even Harry had to agree with his sentiment. At this moment in time, all he wanted was someone who would genuinely like him and not use him for their own beneficial needs.
. And that's one piece of advice that I live up to. I mean, it's so good to explore other boundaries that I've never dreamed of going or doing in my lifetime at all. Seeing you push yourself through my eyes.....it's a huge turn on because you are always excited to try something new, you're always the first to explore your strengths, plus you look very sexy when you are achieving your goals. Your opinions, your excitement and those beautiful eyes of yours when you push yourself, it’s timeless and that’s something that I always want to come home to.
"No! You got to hold her first last time." Blaise said.
"Sirius is truly a God send. We're lucky he's in our life." Draco remarks. "Anyway, what are we going to watch?" He asks Harry.
"To finality and closure." Harry says, lifting his glass. "To useless men and women who are out of our lives and gone forever!" He says with a smile on his face.
Draco shook his head fondly. Harry was doing the most right now, but he wasn't sure how to repay him at all.
"Oh please, Draco! What about you?" Ron asks Draco. "He's a successful business man. He can do a hell of a lot better than you. I mean you are hardly ever to be found. All your free time is spent one of three ways: with a new suitor, working, or with Harry. I'm surprised that we always talk at work and have lunch together."
"Huh?"
“Nothing really. I’m just trying to talk to Harry.”
"With you, it's always good." Draco says kissing Harry.
Now, in hindsight Draco should been happy that his best friend had found a potential mate, but if he was being honest himself, he wasn't happy in anyway shape or form. In fact, he felt..... very discouraged and he couldn't figure out why he was feeling like that. This was strange to him as things were working out in his favor, but something was holding him back from truly enjoying this outcome.
"Only you, Draco." Harry sighs.
"Are you saying this because you're not dating and bored?"
“Draco, what are you going to do now?”
“Harry? I know you’re in there. Please answer me! I need to talk to you!”
"Trust me, Draco. You being with Harry is probably going to be a great thing. He's gonna treat you like the moon and stars." Blaise tells him.
"This summer was good, right?" Harry asked and Draco shrugged at him.
"Yeah. I still feel kinda sad that you didn’t want to join us. But I’m extremely happy that we got to hang out though. But I digress.” Harry stated. "What about the other night?"
Meanwhile, Draco, 35, is hotter than ever. He is more broader, muscular and a doctor that has an awesome friend that he is happy to work with. Draco and his friend Ronald Weasley, are currently changing out of their scrubs just talking about their weekend plans as they do every single Friday.
"What?! No! I'm not jealous at all." Draco says hurriedly. "Why would you say that?"
"Yes you should have known." Draco says in agreement. "But you offered, so here we are."
"What would that be?" Harry asks cautiously. "I want to break up or something?"
Draco moans deeply enjoying Harry bounce up and down his cock.
"We would be a cute little family, don't you think?" A cheeky Harry asks as he nudges Draco's arm for an answer.
"Hello?"
Five minutes later, Gwen delivers their drinks. "Here you go, four strawberry lemonades.
"Trust me. As a confirmed bachelor, I can tell you that I have had some great guys over the years. If I wanted to be committed to someone, then I would have been scooped up a long time ago in a heartbeat. Anyway, my loss is your gain, which means that I am going to find a husband for you. Manhunt, here we come!"
“Ditto, buddy. Ditto.”
"Well, I texted Hermione and asked her if she wanted to meet up."
"I think to too, baby girl. I hope you don't mind that I nicknamed you Tori."
"Hey, Harry." Draco greets his friend.
"You're just in time for Brunch and a fucking lobotomy, blondie." Ron answered as he came from the kitchen with a glass of water and some pills. "Do you plan on taking a shower right now?"
Ron tilts his head in confusion.
"I want to take her home with me." Blaise says, cooing at her. "She's so cute."
He thinks to himself with hot tears running down his cheeks. “Please God, I hope I’m not too late!”
"No, just lonely without Harry." He replies wiping his eyes before his tears fall. "Is it still wrong that I'm waiting for him to call me because his relationship has failed with Inferno?"
Ron holds out his glass for Hermione, "To new beginnings?"
"Yeah…… Keep telling yourself that." Neville tells him while patting Draco on the back.
"Positive."
which was-"
when he's been right in front of my face for the longest time. I also think that after ten years of having this stupid contract, I think that I finally deserve a proper kiss." Harry says with a smile on his face.
"No." Harry says shaking his head as he throws the phone on the couch. He'd spoken with the blonde nearly everyday for the past two weeks before bed, and seen him every night since Monday to relieve some his stress. Besides, Harry was sure that Draco would want a night off from Harry, so he decided to make his way into the kitchen and warm some leftovers. Once Harry warmed his plate of spaghetti, he made his way to the couch with his food, a bottle fo wine and turned his TV on. He started flipping channels and stopped when he saw
“You know, I’ve never seen you this smitten for a guy in a long time.” Harry tells her.
"Dammit you homely man whore, I need to leave, god dammit!" Harry says on the verge of tears.
"Alright. But first I gotta go get some food." Ron says walking towards the nearest diner.
Draco looked at her with pleading eyes as Harry is shock. He can’t believe that Draco has had their contract in his wallet for a decade.
"That is true, but we could still dress her up just for fun."
"Of course." Harry says, mesmerized by this man.
"Let me go, dammit!" Harry screamed frantically, while the others surround his car.
"Don't do anything stupid." Ron says.
Now knowing that Draco was clearly upset and jealous of Harry’s sexual encounter, this truly made his day.
"Damn it. What the hell do I do now?" He asks himself, while he lifts his hands to rub his face. "I just inadvertently did something totally wrong to Harry. What the fuck do I do now?" He asks, hoping someone or something would answer him. "I'm totally losing Harry's trust after this. He'll think I hooked up with his
As soon as they step foot into the building, Hermione is welcomed by the smell of fresh herbs and spices and just
"We can talk after dinner." Harry says as he takes a plate and starts putting rice onto the plate.
Seamus doesn't respond.
"Yes we are. I'll have the nachos please." Hermione says.
"But let’s talk about Draco. Didn't you notice how he was behaving when Harry was telling his story? I was shocked!" Ron inquired.
"I don't know why you have keys, Ronald." Hermione says as she steps into the house, followed by the rest.
Suddenly, Harry's expression changed from confused to grimace when Draco handed Tori over to him.
"And I'll get ready."
"Oh! Before I forget, I made some fried cheese sticks, homemade breadsticks and I got some salad as our appetizers." Harry says before rushing to the kitchen.
"Pizza and wings dammit. What kind of fucking question is that?" He smirks, shaking his head.
"Aww." Neville says.
"It's one of my hookup names, just like Flames." Inferno smiles.
"You've got some crumbs right there."
"Well, what do you want, Draco?" Luna asks gently and Draco sighs.
"And a gentleman, who I covered for this morning at his meeting, doesn't tell me what happened is asking for a beating." Hermione threatened.
"Mom."
Harry has three fingers in when he brushes against Draco's prostate, and Draco's moan turns to a scream as he clenches around Harry's fingers even
." Draco says playfully, causing Harry to chuckle. "You know what? I made mistake with being with Gregory. He was an asshole, through and through to the very end."
Both men reach Flames’ bedroom and both men resume making out, exploring each others bare chest. Once they got on the bed, Flames straddled Draco on the bed and started undoing Draco's belt. Just as he finished undoing Draco's belt, Flames phone started ringing.
"How are you doing?" Draco asks Harry.
"Hey, Draco! I didn't know you were coming!" He says running towards Draco, hugging him.
"I might have to teach her how to dance one day."
Harry chuckles.
"I think Tori can help me lose my stress and help me make good decisions. Aside from that, she needs her other father figure in her life."
"And I'll give one more good reason. Maybe I'll find a pretty lady here to ask out on a date." Neville tells Draco.
"Well, I think I've kept you up longer than you needed to, so get s good night sleep, Har. Have sweet dreams." Draco says bidding Harry a good night.
Once Draco was safe within the confines of his apartment, Draco moped around his living space for an hour or so. He felt so stupid for wasting his time, listening to Ron and taking his advice. Since he had nowhere to go and nothing to do tonight, he decided to stop moping and he eats his leftover spaghetti and attempts to watch
"Thanks, Weasel."
?" Ron asks while wiggling his eyebrows.
"You made breakfast?"
"I think that’s a good idea. Would you like something to eat? It’s been a while since we’ve hung out since we’re both busy bodies."
"We went drove from my house all the way to Nevada." Ron supplied.
"If you followed all the steps, then it definitely should be fantastic." Draco tells him, and Harry smiles.
Minutes later, Draco pulls Harry up to his feet, kissing him. “Feel good, huh?”
"We helped." Ron said.
"Princesses don't cry." Draco says as he picks up gently, before he wraps her tightly with the towel and rocks her.
Ron simply shakes his head as he notices Draco slipping some money in the guys pocket.
Draco smiles, rubbing her back as Hermione, Justin and Blaise rush in, fawning over her.
He's pushing the dildo in and out with vigor, trying to imitate the ways in which he fantasizes Draco would always fuck him, and not a minute later his dick is pulsing and he's coming undone, again, without ever touching himself.
"Yes, we're on the right street. I live in one of these houses."
“I love you too. Now, show me how much you love me, babe."
"Well, I am so fucking glad that everybody's made a choice for me and what I should do." Harry says angrily, letting his tears fall. "Doesn't anybody want to know what I feel, how I feel or what I want or want?"
“And he missed a very important meeting, as it was pertaining to this client who is expanding a business in California.”
Harry grabbed a cup of coffee, sat at a table and took out his phone. Now, if Harry was being honest with himself, he had a gut feeling that something was going to happen today. If there was anything that he could be sure of, it was to trust his gut feeling and his gut was telling him that something good was going to happen to him. Just as he had his fourth sip of coffee and sent a text to his friend Luna, the door opened. As Harry looked up, he saw a tall man with wet blonde hair plastered on his forehead, soaking wet clothes and holding onto a stroller, causing Harry to rush over to him.
"Were you scared of water?"
"I guess we both agree on something." Harry says in a hard voice, indicating that he's finished with their conversation.
The room goes quiet as everyone watches Tori sleep in her father's arms. Harry wraps an arm around Draco, smiles and presses a kiss on Draco's jaw before kissing Tori's forehead.
books, and Harry here recommended that I should try reading the
“Mm-hmm.” Harry moaned tugging on Draco’s belt.
"Don't get cocky with me, Potter."
him?!" Draco asked, completely shocked at what he had just heard.
"Oh Fuck No!" Draco exclaimed realizing that he unknowingly did something completely wrong.
"Why not? She's the only artist I care for at the moment, next to Kendrick Lamar." He says nonchalantly. "Besides,
His heart is breaking. Was this a joke? Were the people in this room waiting to shout
She clutches his shirt once more.
“Why me?” He wonders out loud, before he even realizes it, he starts crying. Every single time he thinks he's found someone, they turn out to be complete jerks. Just when he thought that this could potentially be the guy for him, reality bit him in the ass. All he wanted at this moment was to be in Draco's company to forget about his broken heart.
"And we're going to take a nap." Draco said dismissively, going towards his bedroom.
"So, what did you think of Harry's story?" Hermione asks Ron an hour later as they are simply wrapped up in one another twenty minutes later. "Isn't it sweet that he's putting himself out there? I mean, just by hearing his story, I get the feeling that he's been burned by so many guys before."
"No, thank you." Harry responds absently
They are having such a good time with foreplay for a few minutes that Harry starts to go mad.
"I’m gonna go hang out with Neville. It’s been a while since I’ve seen him and I really want to hang out with him to get more advice, this time from a young guy’s point of view." Draco says to Sirius. "I mean, I can’t really ask Harry, can I?"
"Um..sure."
"I always apologize for the things I haven't done. Anyway, when I got back home, I saw a note that basically said that he didn't want to be a father and that he didn't want to be with me."
He places a kiss just underneath the tip and he starts sucking on his length.
"Really?"
"Well, I have some news, and I don't know how you're going to take this." Draco tells him. “And I don’t know how this will turn out.”
"Awww. I'm sorry about that."
"I think someone is hungry." Harry says as Tori started to cry. Draco hands Harry his camera before picking up his daughter.
"You better tell me that you're on the way back here, babe." Hermione says as she answered the phone.
"Dean, this is my friend, Hermione. Hermione, this is Dean."
Ron turns to look at Hermione, and he swore that the world stopped.
"Of course you would bring me to a gay bar." Ron says as he's looking around the place, nursing his beer. "I should have known."
“Yup, but I like to receive.”
"You positive?"
As Draco was about to say something, whining comes from the stroller and he quickly caters to his baby.
"I don't think I can do this, Harry."
"With a lot of charm by yours truly." Justin says.
Draco waited for a moment, just until Harry bottomed out. After a brief moment of studying Draco’s beauty, he gently pulled Draco by his neck and kissed him once.
"I am effortless."
"Wow, good timing. I'm going to repay the favor." He tells her.
"Hi, baby." Draco cooed, kissing her forehead causing her to wrinkle her nose and lips to curl. "Do you need any help, Potter?"
"Actually, Hermione suggested it." Harry said.
"I know that we aren't going to watch them all tonight, but I found
. What's the best song on that album?"
"Ahhh! Ok, tell me what happened!" Hermione says as she sits on his desk. "It better be filthy, show me pictures, tell me the descriptions, names, phone numbers, videos, sizes-"
His dick twitches as he presses the dildo further into his ass. He can't help but know how different this dildo is from his Draco. Harry moans at the thought and turns the vibrator on full power, relishing in the sensations it's causing his hole, wishing it were Draco's. He can't say it's the first time he's thought about Draco, because it's not. Not even near. It is the first time that he's done it like this, to this extreme, with a dildo stretching him open.
"Hey, cutie." He says kissing her cheeks, causing her to smile.
"Could you please come over?" He asks Draco again.
. After they've eaten their food, they decide to put the dirty dishes in the sink, they move into Harry's living room with the cake and wine. As Draco was opening the bottle of wine, Harry turned to the TV and the DVD player, trying to pick which movie they were going to watch.
"Because everyone deserves someone, even if they don't believe in that concept. Even if they are scared of it, they'll never know who they deserve as a soulmate if they don't take the chance. But enough about that. Where's your future husband? It's weird not seeing Harry here with you at all."
“Is that a threat?”
Harry moans.
“Text me where you are. I’ll be there as soon as I can.”
"There we go! You're doing so well." Harry says, encouraging her as he watches her kick her feet.
"Ah yeah." Draco says, pulling the sheets back over them. "Happy birthday to you, my soul mate."
"Anyway, are you enjoying yourself so far?"
"What?!"
"No." Draco says and Harry turns his car off and steps out of his car.
"You're really gonna call him, Draco? Did you forget that Harry's a helpless romantic? Go after him!" Hermione says, but Draco still calls Harry.
When she first heard him say boyfriend, she was wondering if she heard that correctly, so when she asked Harry what Terry did, Harry told her that Terry was a male model who broke up with him because they never spent a lot of time together. With that information, she finally realized why he never fell for her antics and ignored her advances. Although she was a bit sad that Harry wasn’t into her, she was also happy that she found a great friend in Harry and Harry, in turn, was happy that he could confide in her about anything and everything in ways that he couldn’t tell Hermione. After that, they always went shopping, bar hopping, went to get manicures and pedicures, you name it. Harry was just happy that Hermione was the friend that he never knew he needed.
"Then he gets hurt. Just remember that time heals all things, and even in the loneliest state of mind, happiness is still so hard to find. Besides, we will always be there to help him pick up the pieces." Neville reminded him.
"Got it."
"Harry, is something wrong?”
“Keep going.” Draco says as Harry’s hands are now inside Draco’s pants, massaging his bare ass.
"Oh my God!" Draco laughs. "Seriously?"
Harry can only nod his head while he whimpers.
"A bit." Harry admits.
"So I actually wanted you to meet my friends during my lunch break. Are you ok with that?"
Draco perks up when he hears Harry's name coming out of Ron's mouth.
Best friend.
"Who is it this time?" Ron asks him. "Is it Harry?"
"Well, come on in." Flames responds, moving aside to let Draco in.
"As a matter of fact, I do. Actually, I want two things."
"Harry?"
Ron was packing.
“What’s the matter?” Harry asked, smirking at the blonde.
"She smiled at me again! You are so cute!"
Ronald Billius Weasley, who came from a big family, is a good looking man who was popular with the ladies. Shit, even men were enticed by his red hair which he absolutely loved. He is a honest man who would do anything to help a loved one in their time of need. Draco was  happy that he found a friend in Ron.
And with that, Harry sits down taking in the blonde's appearance. He noticed that the man in front of him was tall, slender, had a pale and pointed face, sleek blond hair, and ice grey eyes.
Draco coos at Tori's little dress.
"I'm going to make this easy for you then. Hermione?"
"Wow." A shocked Harry says. "I guess you were thirsty."
"Hey, Harry." Draco greets.
Draco put his book down, and smiled at the man who was currently standing by the TV, putting on the DVD player.
"Wow, she never failed to amaze me.
After about 10 minutes in the bathroom, Harry goes to his bedroom to get changed. Before he can dry off, he hears his phone vibrate. He looks at his phone and sees that he has received a text message.
"It's too late for anything at this point. Let's just go back home. I'm tired and very depressed at the moment. Besides, we wouldn't want you to be gone from Hermione for too long. She might get the wrong idea about what's happening between us." Draco tells him.
She reads through the short contract thoroughly.
“You’re wonderful, Potter.” Draco says as his lips are an inch away from Harry’s.
"You're really sweet, Potter."
Draco lowered his head and gave Harry’s crack a quick lick. As Harry cried out, his asshole puckered at the contact.
"My name is Draco Lucius Malfoy, and this little one is Victoria Goyle." Draco said.
"A mimosa and burrito? You're an awful friend!" Harry smirks.
A moment later, Harry starts riding Draco.
"You know what you should do to fix that?"
"You'll find someone who appreciates you for being yourself. Anyone who breaks up with you over a text isn't worth your time." Draco says with a serious look on his face.
"Just head to my room while I wake these two up." Harry told Draco. "Are you going to stay the night, Neville?"
"Well, he put his hand on my thigh again," Blushed Harry. "And I might have jumped on him and kissed him." He said in small voice.
“It’s not a big deal anymore.” Ron says dismissing the conversation that they’ve had for the past hour or so. In Ron’s opinion, Draco had turned into a nightmare ever since his fight with Harry two weeks ago. He wasn’t fun or playful that much, and frankly, it was getting to Ron. Draco has been depressed, and it was riding on Ron’s last nerves.
Later on in the morning, around 10:45, Hermione decides to visit Harry at his office. When she gets to Harry's desk, she noticed that the desk is still empty.
"I'll be back."
"Thank you. Freaking out would have made things worse. You act like she had sneezed her nose off."
"Yes." Draco said without hesitation. At this moment, he's never seen a boy smile so beautifully in his entire life, and he was beyond fond of the crinkles by Harry's green eyes. "I just have a hard time...."
"Oh please, Draco." Harry snorts. "I know for a fact that you aren't capable of having a working relationship at all and-"
"Aww, she's a summer baby like me." Harry cooed.
At this moment, it wasn’t about getting off at all. It was just about the here and now, bodies as one and it didn’t feel bad at all. Their bodies were moving in sync as their lips brushing together in a plea they were accepting. Pushing his arm between their bodies that seem to be stuck together, Draco wrapped his hand around Harry, stroking him slowly as he kept thrusting into him. A wordless cry came out of Harry’s lips as he came undone all over his stomach and Draco’s hand, lost in Draco’s touch that sent him into blissful heaven. After coming down from his high, he closed his eyes and kept moving his hips, needing Draco’s completion.
"Stop ruining everything with your nosy, bony, ass." Justin says before walking away.
"I need something to snack on." Draco says. "You guys got anything?"
?" Harry asks while he sits on the couch.
What Is Draco Thinking?
“Ride me.”
"That's my girlfriend, you-"
"See, had you met up with this.... stranger before, like Harry asked you to several times before, this wouldn't have happened." Ron stated. "With that being said, I would have told him."
"So what happened after you left?"
compliment.
"Since you came out of your way to hang out, why don't you join us? I was going to call you and the others to finally meet Inferno, but Hermione and I were so busy with work, that I totally forgot to do so. I know it's a little bit late and too much to ask of you, but you know that you’re always welcome to stay, especially since you've turned down my offer to meet this guy several times now. You can put the food and beer in the fridge, if you want. I've cooked enough food for at least three or five people."
"Are you sure?"
"Are you upset about that guy?"
"I love you too, Malfoy." He says happily.
"Oh well. Deal with it. And I know that you don't want to see me right now either, but I don't care about that at all." Ron started. "Since I'm your only friend right now and at work, I'm here to tell you that you're going to have to move on eventually."
"You're a cutie, baby girl. Such a cutie patootie. Yes you are. Yes you are." Harry cooed at her in a baby voice as she held onto his finger.
“Then he doesn’t forgive you.” Ron says, knowing that Harry is definitely going to forgive him in due time since he’s been speaking to Harry. “You owe it to yourself and to Harry to clear this situation up. It was a mistake, and you can’t let it keep hurting you or him like that at all. None of you deserve the heartache that you’re going through.”
"Just relax." Inferno says, while putting his hand on Harry's thigh.
"She really likes to smile." Draco said.
Sirius bursts out laughing hysterically. "Can you repeat that again for me, Draco?" With tears running down his face. He’s also trying to catch his breath while laughing at Draco. "That's the funniest thing I've ever heard from Harry in the longest time!"
"Maybe you should sneeze." Draco told him as he smiled at his daughter who had one of her hands in her mouth. "After all, she does like when people sneeze."
The blonde man simply laughs.
“Thank you.” She says as he hands her the bag.
"First thing: Why don't we burn our contract?" Harry suggests to Draco.
"Dammit, what a fucking asshole." Draco tells himself as he walks away from the man's house.
"So, what do you want to do?" Draco asks him while he's hugging Harry.
"So, Malfoy, what's your answer?" Neville asks.
gives you
“Yes.” Harry moans as he puts his arms behind his head and enjoys the sensation.
"Yeah?" Harry said as he gently wiped Tori's face making her whine a bit.
"As weird as your obsession with
"We can wait until tomorrow!" Ron says happily.
"You put bacon in a grilled cheese sandwich?"
Harry finally looks up and notices Draco.
"If you must know
He smiles as he walks towards the bed.
Draco sighs. He knows who's friend is absolutely correct.
Harry places his arms behind him, rolling his hips into Draco’s thrusts causing the blonde to put his own arms above his head.
"Because it just like a montage in a movie."
"Everything Sirius makes is fantastic. I swear Draco, he's sent from up above because he really is the best."
Truthfulness.
"I thought you had Tori with you."
Draco is lying down on his bed under his covers. He turns to his end table to grab his phone and dials a number that he's engraved in his head.
Plans
"Thank you." Draco said with a smile on his face.
“If I had the chance to, I would!” Draco snapped.
"There?"
"Go!" Hermione encourages him, and he runs out in the street, blocking Harry's path.
"That's good with me, and hopefully I'll get to kiss you the same way you want to kiss me very soon."
"Oh, that was a world away." He says, sitting on the couch, touching the broken glass. "Here's to you, Harry." Draco says, opening the wine bottle, lifting it up in the air. "I hope you find love and happiness, wherever you go in life." Draco takes a long drink from the bottle, before he passes out.
"I really think that you'll like it! I-"
Ernie chuckles.
"It's like all the guys I've been with just turn on me. First, they're sweet and amazing, then they turn into unrecognizable trash. When I found out that I was pregnant with his baby, I was scared to tell him simply because he would leave me. Thr funny part is, when I told him that I was pregnant, he was extremely happy and gave me hope that we would be fine. After Tori was born though..... everything changed. Instead of helping me with her, he went out, partied, and just acted like we were just footnotes in a book. He acted like he had no responsibilities whatsoever.
"I've got it." Harry said as he took the things and went off with Tori. "Hey, cutie pie." He said kissing her cheeks, causing her to move her fist excitedly. He laughs a bit as he began to change her. If he was being honest with himself, Harry was getting attached to Tori. He loved her so much and loves to see her smiling and laughing that he never wanted to let go of that bond with her.
"Why didn't you tell us?" He asks Harry.
He wonders as he is waiting for his friend to show up at the restaurant.
"It's because you're here." Harry says, leaning in to kiss Draco.
"We need music. What's your poison?" She asks him.
"As you can see, she's safe and sound in my arms. I see that she likes getting up early." Harry said.
"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving, and the rosebuds know to bloom in early May" Harry sang causing Draco's insides to flutter because he loved Stevie Wonder's
"You don't look too bad yourself." He said.
"As your best friend, I truly want you to be happy."
"Then live with me!"
"If I were to give you this picture of Harry," He says, pulling a picture of Harry, Neville and Draco out of his photo album from about three years ago. "What would you say?"
"Well as your best friend, I think I'm qualified to help you find someone."
"Of course I want you to stay. I have extra rooms and I want to make sure that you and little Victoria here that you are safe."
"Ron." Draco answered. "Just make sure that you're holding her correctly, Weasley. I heard that you have a reputation ofnot holding babies right."
"How can I? You knew that he was leaving New York before I did!" Draco bitterly responds.
“Is it the books and cleverness, or is it your bushy hair that holds secrets?”
“Harry, it’s your friend for life!”
“I like that you’re so tight.” Draco moans softly.
"I can't wait for tomorrow." Draco tells him, while closing the refrigerator door.
Harry thought to himself as he found a naked Draco in his bed dead to the world softly snoring.
"You're absolutely correct my partner in crime. Knowing you, you'll be getting the double cheeseburger. Am I right, or am I right?" A blushing Draco asks.
Ron still felt violated and it felt as though as he was cheating on Hermione, and they weren't even official yet.
"Let go, Ron." She moans, and he shoots his load inside of the condom.
Ron wonders to himself after witnessing how Draco was acting when he found out that Harry was nowhere to be found for hours on end.
Neville's statement made Draco think of Harry.
Draco thinks to himself. He’s gonna have a great time with Flames, as he tried to bury his jealousy over Inferno and his dinner date with Harry for the night. After all, he wasn’t going to meet up with Flames again, plus the guy lived close by.
His touch.
Hermione smiles and clinks their glasses together. "To new beginnings." She sips a bit of the wine and is surprised at how good it tastes. "Hmmm, this is good."
"Aww, she smiled at me." Harry said.
The message said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry knew that Draco was hurting, but at this point, all he could do was hope that time would heal all the wounds very soon as his own heart was breaking.
“You know what? You really need to work your shit out with Harry.” Ron tells him.
“Are you enjoying this Potter?”
"I really do." Draco says with his eyes pooling with tears.
"Ooh! Chocolate covered strawberries!" Ernie exclaims happily. "Can I come, please?"
“See you later, babe.” Ron tells Hermione.
“I’m sure. I’ll see you later, Longbottom.”
"Goodbye, Seamus." Harry says. "You know where the door is."
"I uh, I think we should get going." He says with his voice quivering.
," Draco continues.
Harry smiled a little and nodded his head.
"You're far from small, Potter."
Fuck, I'd even bring him the moon if he asked me to.
"What do you say about teaching these lovely people to a lesson in actual beauty, Har? You think we can take 'em?" A flirting Draco asks.
Draco snorts a bit.
“Done.” Harry says and Draco passionately kisses him.
"Cool. Now, I'm off to get a drink for Luna." Neville says.
Harry smiles.
"Thank you. I call it swag."
Harry smiled.
"It's all good." He tells her, still not looking her in the eyes.
"So we can start early. After all, this is her first Christmas."
"My ex never did that at all." Draco said.
"There you go." He says to her.
is showing! I like this episode. The one where Blanche was jealous of all the attention Dorothy was getting from all the guys at The Rusty Anchor. Dorothy's singing was awesome!"
"Luckily, I can quench your thirst with a beer." Ernie says as he hands Draco the ice cole beer.
“It’s going great!” Harry responds. “I really think that Justin is the one, but I am nervous to propose to him.”
Harry simply looked at her expectantly.
“Yes you will.” Hermione responds.
Inferno kissed him back hungrily.
. After the movie ended, I went to take a shower and after I got out the shower, I got a notification from Grindr, from this guy, who goes by the name, Flames. Well, anyway,  I got to his house and...."
“And the advice was….?”
"Just.... I'm just a little bit worried."
“Yes! Score one for the Red Haired Man!” Ron says happily.
"I stepped out and sat outside your door for a few minutes. I uh- I went home and had some leftover food and I watched
"I'm not a murderer or anything if you're worried about that."
"Let me finish." Draco says in a soft gentle voice, placing a finger over Harry's mouth.
"Going away party? For who?" Draco asked.
"Man, don't be a jackass. I've known the guy for a long fucking time, and he's the greatest most nicest man you could ever meet. Just, please go have dinner with him and talk to him and have a good time screwing him or whatever. We seriously don’t need to waste anymore time when you have a date." Draco tells him.
"I don't have to do anything.” Inferno tells him nonchalantly.
"I did keep it small." Hermione says causing Harry to shake his head at her while he's smiling.
Tori sticks out her tongue a little, making Harry laugh.
Just as he was cleaning himself up, he got a Facetime call from Draco.
"Well, we went a couple rounds. Ok, six to be exact. When I woke up, it was well past 11:10 this morning and Inferno needed to leave because he had to take his Art History exam. After that, he was going to his Karate class, so I decided to come here, and do something good with myself, after a long night of frolicking." Harry said.
"His name is Draco, and his boyfriend left him and their baby girl." Harry said as he's grabbing his coat and his bag. "He needs a place to stay."
“Well, I figured that since we always talk about our friends, I think that we should all meet each other for dinner, and maybe we can set them up.”
"Just me, you and daddy." He says as her hand clutched onto the collar of his shirt.
Ron simply looks at his friend sympathetically as Draco is still missing the obvious.
"Are you sure you want me to stay with you? I mean I could find somewhere to stay."
As Harry swallows Draco down to the hilt, he teasingly bites down playfully, and Draco lets out a loud moan and bucks his hips up, forcing himself further into Harry's mouth as he comes. Harry is surprised, to say the least, but pins him down on the bed by holding his hips and tightens his lips around Draco's cock, swallowing the come flooding his mouth and sucking Draco dry.
"Yeah. Is something wrong?" Harry asked as he noticed Draco's frown.
"Come on, Draco. We have reservations." Harry said. Hermione smiles as Draco peppers Tori's face with kisses before handing her to Hermione.
"You really chose a good one, Weasley."
"It's not my fault that I'm hot. I can't help that my looks are so cute, especially my mother's eyes." Harry said as he kept his attention on Tori.
He's just annoyed.
"Ok." Hermione says as she hangs up the phone. "Start taking."
“You love him, don’t you?” She kindly asks him and waits for Draco’s response.
"Those are a bit cheesy. Catwoman is the best!"
"Get some ass, Harry!" Blaise says, and Harry blushes.
"You're so small, Tori." Harry says as he peppers kisses on Tori's cheeks causing her to grin a little.
"Harry, I don't mind paying. I mean, I did want you to meet Ron tonight."
"You know, you can either walk with the devil or you don't and he's definitely not walking with the devil on this one. After all he is a hopeless romantic. It's probably best for the both of us if he leaves." Draco says as he's trying to see himself in Harry's shoes.
Draco looks at him in shock.
"Longbottom, what's going on?"
"Oh, yeah. I think you'll love this one." Inferno tells him. "This one is called
"It's not a waste. We can get things for Tori! We can get little outfits, hats, shoes, toys, so on and so forth."
"You can wait until midnight tonight, right?" Ron inquires.
Draco couldn't help or contain the goofy grin on his face, making Harry smile.
"How's everything going?" Draco asks Harry carefully.
"Got it." Ron stated.
Draco nodded as he let Harry put the jacket on him.
"Really?"
I love taking care of him.
"The food is done." Harry said as walked into the living room with two plates of pasta and placed them on the coffee table about an hour later.
A moment later, Harry got to the table where Draco was at.
“Oh! Right there, right there!” Harry shouted.
"That's the best time to celebrate a birthday apparently." Draco said. "Anyway, we started going to the coffee shop where you work at the week after Tori was born."
"That's a shame." Blaise said through his laughter.
"Only the ones that I like. Hopefully, I'll catch you under one." Harry says with a smirk.
And with that, Seamus leaves Harry's house.
"Ooh, you're looking for someone?" Neville asked.
"Some dinner and maybe a movie." Harry answered. "We'll be back by 8 o'clock, that is if Draco doesn't get to home sick."
"I know. I'll throw you big a party!" She exclaims.
Justin forces a smile and clinks his glass with Harry.
"I'm sure!" Ron laughs.
"You invited a stranger into your home?" Lily asked her son.
"Well, Goyle and I met at a Janet Jackson tour-"
Harry was sitting in his office, blasting love songs on his computer speakers, singing along with the songs. That is until his phone went off.
“Great.” Draco says, pulling down Harry’s pants and taking off his socks. He pulls Harry by his boxer briefs, bending him over the couch. Then he proceeds to remove his own pants and underwear, takes off his socks, before literally ripping Harry’s underwear off.
, and a lot of other shit, but to tell you the truth, it really doesn't matter anymore. What matters to me at the moment, is
"Do you really want this?" He asks her.
"Ah, I'm thoroughly impressed that you asked, Potter. I'll get it myself."
“Draco!” Harry moans as he in know putting his weight on his forearms and his knees. “Put it in already!”
Draco picked Harry up bridal style and took him to the bedroom. He placed Harry on the bed and got on top of him and continued to kiss him until he took off Harry’s shirt. As Harry was going to take off Draco’s shirt, Draco stopped him.
Draco moved the book, placed it beside him, and lifted Tori up in the air.
"Were's Tori?" Draco asks, cutting him off.
"Thank you. You have a nice smile too, Potter." He says as he tries to concentrate on his book, but fails.
Shopping And A Date
"What if you don't want us to stay with you anymore? Then you'd have bought everything for Tori would be for nothing."
"You make it seem bad, but I did it for a good reason."
"You're just saying that." Harry replies miserably, wiping his tears away with left arm.
"Thank you, Sirius."
Draco doesn't get to finish as Neville pushed him into the dressing room. Nearly nine outfits later, Neville almost fell asleep against the mannequin that he was leaning against when he heard the dressing room doors open.
"It sure did." Draco admits through his smile. "It took so long so save some money and when I didn't have any more money to save, I just cleaned out my savings account. I always said that when I would propose, I would want to do it in Athens!"
"Well, you gave me three good reasons, just like Ron did."
"Thank you." Draco said as he smiled before he walked over to Tori. "Princess, I'm going out with Harry for a few hours. I'm going to miss you so much."  After he finished talking to her, Tori simply smiled at him as she cooed.
"Oh, stop it, Potter. You're making me smile like a Cheshire cat." Draco says, moving Harry's hand away.
“Like three weeks, and he is not, I repeat,
"We are." Harry says as they start to walk towards the bathroom.
"Harry, there's nothing wrong with dating and wanting something worthwhile. Although I think you're looking in the wrong places for love, I believe that you're not going to be single much longer. You're one person that everyone would like to have in the long run, and anyone who says otherwise, can come find me."
"Good lord, you're fucking beautiful. I can no longer pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me." He tells her.
“I really don’t give a crap about what you thought, Malfoy.” Harry snaps.
Harry notices something.
around Harry's cock. It's unrelenting and with every press against Draco's prostate Harry is seeing stars. He pulls off from sucking on one of Draco's nipples and arches his back as he thrusts back in once more and he comes, hard.
"I don't know." Ignoring the last part of Sirius’ comment. "I just hope that nothing happened to him after our double date last night. Maybe I'll ask Ron to help me go look in and around-"
"One again Harry James Potter, you are correct." Draco responded, as they all sit at the booth the host has taken them to.
"I hope he knows what he's doing." Justin says.
Anything for the love of my life, Draco Malfoy!
Draco sat up, yawned and rubbed his eyes. He took the glass and the pills from Ron.
Draco smiles.
PS: If you ever read my diary Malfoy, just know that you are in big trouble, but nonetheless, I fucking love you Draco and don’t you forget it.
“My friend.” Ron repeats as he high-fives Harry.
"Well, I’m gonna let you know right now, Malfoy. I definitely won’t be dating any of the men that work there; however, I'll give it a shot." The raven colored hair man conceded wishing that he can spend a quiet night at home with the blonde.
"Whatever." He says, sounding annoyed.
“I think that’s a good idea.” Harry says. “When shall we go on this date?”
"Can you give me a smile, Tori? Pretty please?" Harry asked as he's taking pictures of Tori with his Canon camera.
“Ok, Blondie.” Harry says as he bounces up and down Draco slowly.
"What?!" Draco asks in disbelief and he pulls out his phone.
"Come on in, Draco. Are you sure you don't want to stay for bottomless drinks? Cause we've got plenty of booze and you can stay and hang out with Ron and I for a while." Hermione offers.
Harry simply smiled as he paid the bill.
Draco pecked Tori's head and placed her in her little mobile seat on the play mat. He smiled as she was immediately interested in the toys hovering above her.
"Same here." Draco said. "I probably would have been living in the box on the streets or at my parent's house."
"Hey, adorable. My name is Harry." He says as he brushed his finger on her fist.
“I’ve always loved your cock.” Harry tells the blonde a few moments later.
My knight in shining armor, who was there for me when my past boyfriends couldn't be bothered with me. My Draco, who I wanted to comfort for the rest of my life when I was feeling down and cold. The same Draco, who made me stay up late at night for weeks, thinking about him and that kiss for hours on end because he gave me a very hot kiss back at his 26
“Since tonight is my 25
“Ok. Draco, calm down.” He tells himself before he answers the call.
"Sorry for this, but he's a fucking asswipe."
“Harry! Harry James Potter, where are you?!" Draco asked, slightly panicking.
Draco nods as Harry grabs his own sleeping clothes from the chair by his closet. As he is grabbing his clothes, Draco goes to the bathroom to change out of his clothes. Harry on the other hand, took Tori to her crib before returning to change into his own sleeping clothes. When he finished changing, Draco stepped back into the room smiling at him.
“There’s the smile I love! Thank goodness you got my looks. You are going to be breaking hearts when you’re older, baby girl.” Draco said as he kissed her clothed stomach. He sat aback and simply admired Tori’s outfit that Harry picked out for her. Harry had gone to work this morning and Draco had promised that he would visit later in the day. It was officially five weeks since Draco and Tori had been staying with Harry, and it was great.
"Well she smiles at me all the time, so I don't have to make a face."
"Now, that you're being honest with yourself, how do you feel about Harry?" Neville asks him.
"You never let me forget." Harry says with a wide grin on his face.
"This is the hard part. Well...I um, we got into his apartment, and he kissed me. After he pulled away, we said that he had a dinner date in about an hour or so and that we needed to hurry. He said that he was ok skipping the appetizer and just getting to the main course since I was his appetizer. Anyway, we went into his bed, and started making out heavily, until his phone rang. He was going to ignore the call until I asked him to answer his phone. Well, Flames - I, um… he....took his phone out of his pocket, and um, he dropped the phone and I saw your picture on his phone."
And with that, Harry turned off the light and went to sleep.
"You're not even a lawyer, and yet your argument is truly compelling and disconcerting." Harry says as he shakes his head.
birthday."
“I know! I'll call the police. They'll probably put out an APB or-"
“Alright.” Harry says, while hanging up his phone. “Dinner is done, dessert is cooling down, the wine is getting chilled, the place is clean, and the setting is perfect, if I say so myself.” Harry tells himself. “I’m going to take a shower and get dressed.”
"Harry, that's the sweetest thing you've ever done. Opening up your home to someone in need-"
"Relax, babe. I'm gonna be there soon."
"Neville, you are really awesome man. Thanks."
"Hey, I shared that frosting!" Harry pouts.
"Ok, I was." Harry admits. "I was-"
Harry makes a face as he gently gives Tori the stuffed animal, watching her as she put the paw in her mouth.
“Alright. How about later at our favorite bar? I’m craving a martini with a spectacular view.” Harry suggests.
"Nope. Cheers." Harry says while lifting his glass.
“Good.”
"Sure." Says the guy behind the counter says.
"I'm glad love. Maybe you two might even get married."
"Oh fuck, Hermione." Ron pants. "I'm gonna-" Hermione suddenly stops.
"Hello." Draco said when Lily and James came over to him to introduce themselves to him. They sat down at the table cooing at Tori who was staring at them.
Draco chuckled at Harry's smile.
"What happened with Olivia Pope?" Draco asked when he suddenly woke up.
"Sounds like someone is very jealous. Why not tell him how you're feeling?" Neville asks him.
"You're on!"
Ron is taken aback from that statement.
Draco falls on his face.
"Because I don't get to see those pretty eyes or get to pinpoint how Tori looks so much like you."
"God dammit, don't you fucking get it?! I don't want to do anything with you!" Draco snapped at him. "I'm surprised that Harry would want a man like you at all, you goddamn filthy animal!" Draco tells him.
"Could you come over? Inferno broke up with me." Harry tells him, with his voice cracking.
He's hard.
Draco think about this for a moment.
Draco nods as he places Victoria's  blanket on the comfy couch, laying her across it. He adjusted her headband, smiling softly at her. He then took a look around the living room simply taking everything in, and so far, nothing bad happened yet.
Going To The Coffee Shop
"Yeah. I know about it. Anyway I'm starved. Do you have anything in the fridge for a sandwich?" Ron asked Hermione.
"You staying here is good enough for me." Harry honestly tells him.
"But why? Don't you think that Harry has bought me enough clothes? I mean, I appreciate the gesture, but I don't need you to waste your money on me either."
"Are you serious?" A frowning Draco asked as he started to panic.
"Well then, get the fuck out! And you don't have to worry about your
“Oh.” Neville says. “Sorry about that. I thought he told you that he changed the locks. Anyway, I was actually dropping off the money I owed him. Would you like to go in and wait for him? I have a key.”
"Yeah, I kissed him." Harry said. "God, he's such a good kisser, you guys. His kisses are very addictive and his touch is very warm. He's even better in bed. Inferno knew how to take care of me in ways that nobody but one person has ever known how to, and he made me feel very loved. It’s like I almost found the best thing that I never knew I needed." Harry gushed.
"Shit." I mumble.
Malfoy caresses my skin with his thumb and I grind against him, making both of us groan. He pulls my hair as a warning but I gasp and moan lightly, my hips grinding against him yet again. I whimper and squeeze his waist, hardly noticing Malfoys hand that was in my hair make it's way down to my kneck. The image of him choking me while he fucks me flashes in my head. I feel my cock straining against my pants when Malfoy squeezes my throat. Wave after wave of pleasure shakes my body and I feel myself cum in my pants.
"It's fine, nothing I can't handle." I chuckle. His lip quirks up into a smirk for a second. I must be imagining things. I look back into the mirror.
"Nice party," I state, changing the subject.
“And what did you do earlier?” confused, I think back to before he kissed me. Right, I tried to cum.
"Why?"
I walk down the barren halls of Hogwarts, my messy hair messier than usual due to the continuous pulling. A cold sweat is slick on my skin, making my nightshirt stick to my back and soak the front. I'm surrounded by darkness except for a few lit candles every couple feet. The layout of the school has become second nature to me since I walk it every night, horrible nightmares refusing to let me sleep. It helps walking around, clears my mind and exhausts me enough to pass out. Madam Pomfrey has tried to help with potions and supplements but for whatever reason no matter what I do they won't stop.
"You're parents." He answers. I nod.
"Do you miss them?"
Warning: Masturbation, Choking, Self choking, slight biting, homophobic thoughts, mentions of abuse.
"How's Malfoy?" I ask wearily.
"You're drooling." Pansy teases.
"Stop," Malfoy says quietly but firmly. She stops struggling but her anger doesn't simmer off. "Don't do something you'll regret." He tells her. She looks down at the ground and nods. Confused I turn to Ron whose also glaring, not at Malfoy or 'Mione but me. Ron steps towards her and pats her on the shoulder.
“N-no.” I stutter out, feeling myself shift into subspace. I’ve never been a sub with someone else, i’m always too scared but for some reason I feel safe with Harry.
I'm a horrible person. I think to myself as I trip Malfoy with my foot, sending him stumbling. Unable to hold out his hands to stop himself from falling due to him carrying a book in his right hand and holding his satchel in his left, he falls face-first on the floor. A wave of guilt passes through me but I push it down by smiling triumphantly. The hall becomes silent as the onlookers watch.
“He pins my arms above my head with one hand while he unbuttons my shirt with the other.
"Are you?" Hermione inquires.
I sit down in front of the mirror next to him and he finally registers my presence. He jumps back in shock but after a few seconds, his demeanor changes into a defensive stance. I roll my eyes and bring my knees up to my chest, wrapping my arms around them.
"All made up! Isn't that right Potter?" A tight lipped smile on my face. When Harry doesn't respond i pinch the back of his neck, my fingers curling into his soft curly hair, always wild no mater how many times he tries to tame it. I feel his skin bristle with goosebumps as he shivers, obviously still coming down from his climax.He hums looking around before catching on and clearing his throat.
“Obviously. I need a little slut to let my frustrations out on.”
“Nothing.” I say with a sigh and a smile, tilting my head. His lips curl into a snarl as he turns us around. Pushing me into the wall. My head hits the concrete. I see stars for a moment but I'm soon distracted by his lips on my neck. I gasp slightly and moan, closing my eyes, cocking my head to the side so he can have more access. Then I feel his teeth, biting into my skin. At first I'm surprised but a wave of pleasure washes over me. Pushing and pulling like the sea.
"So, what's this really about?" He asks.
“I promise I won’t tell.” He nods thankfully. “Uh will...will we do this again?” I ask hopefully. Harry smiles cockily.
"Oh my god, I'm so sor-" Harry starts to say when his eyes flick down to my crotch. He blushes violently before slamming the door closed.
"Myself," I answer. "Smiling, I mean," I state to clarify. "Like I'm happy." He nods understanding what I meant. "What about you?"
I wander through the empty corridors once again, thinking about everything and nothing. A butterfly is perched on the arch of a door that wasn't there a few seconds ago. It must be the ROR and since there's a butterfly fluttering about that must mean Malfoy's inside. I chew on my bottom lip, wondering what to do next.
My tired eyes barely register the interruption of my nightly routine. A light blue butterfly with glowing wings flutters delicately in the air. It's small wings making the softest of sounds. I raise a curious eyebrow at the strangely placed creature, wondering how on earth it got into the well-guarded walls of Hogwarts when I hear another flutter. Turning around I spot a second butterfly this one much larger, sitting against one of the stone walls.
"Right." She says with a smirk, to which Ron shakes his head. She frowns curiously at him but shrugs him off. I'm disappointed by the fact that they never told me but I understand why they didn't.
"We still have a lot to get over but, I'd say we're not enemies anymore. Maybe even acquaintances. I suppose Granger and Weasle already told you about our friendship?" I nod and he shrugs. "Figured." He laughs. My eyes widen and I stare at him. "What?" He asks in concern.
~Later that night~
A/N: Voldemort died when he tried to kill Harry and stayed dead.
"We're not going to force you to not hate him and we're not asking you to like him but can you chill?" He asks.
I moan as my fantasy continues.
Draco's POV
"Why not," I say flopping back down on the ground. Hermione pumps her fist in the air before jumping up and racing out of the common room, probably going to see the Hufflepuffs because they know how to party.
"Draco and I have been friends since fourth year," Hermione says. "After Cedric Diggory was killed by that crazy Voldemort fan."
"I see a cottage, in the middle of the woods. A city skyline in the distance. Butterflies everywhere too." He smiles warmly. I look over at him, curious since that's not what I was expecting. He turns to me a playful smirk on his lips. "What? Not what you thought I wanted?"
"Who ya thinkin' 'bout?" Pansy breathes in my ear, making me jump away violently in shock. I glare at her and wipe my ear off as she laughs. "No wait, I know who based off that dopey love-sick puppy smirk that was on your face." She walks around the bean bag and flops down on the floor next to me.
Basked in silky moonlight and warm candlelight lays a tired-looking Malfoy. His usually cold eyes are melted in warm puddles as he gazes lovingly at the butterflies sitting atop his propped up hand. His hair is splayed around him, similar to rivers of melted silver. It's strange seeing Malfoy in a regular t-shirt and pajama bottoms instead of his usual expensive attire. In fact, this whole scene is strange to me. I never would have guessed Malfoy of all people taking comfort in the room of requirements especially when it looks like this.
"Alright then!" Blaise yells jumping off the table. "Gather round." People start walking towards where Blaise is but a few people hang back looking wearily at each other.
Harry's POV
I shake off the thought. If you haven't figured it out by now let me be blunt: I am undoubtedly, unabashedly, annoyingly in love with Harry Fucking Potter. Since...second year? I don't remember, but it's been a long time.
"Finally, now lets clean up before Filches next round, it's already 3 am." She smiles and the room eases up. It's not that we don't want Hermione to know what we were doing its just, how do I explain it, it's like if you family member almost caught you masturbating. It's vulnerable and embarrassing.
"Then what were you doing?" He demands.
"I'm not here to fight," I say quietly. I flick my eyes over to him. "I promise." He slowly relaxes as he thinks over my words. His shoulders are still tense and his brows are furrowed but no more anger is rolling off of him.
"You should apologize." Ron's words flood back to me. I sigh deeply and rub a hand over my face. After a few seconds, I huff loudly and reach for the doorknob. As quietly I can I open the door and I'm met with a different scene than yesterday's. The butterflies are still fluttering through the air and the room looks the same but Malfoy isn't laying on the floor, instead, he's sitting in front of a mirror, his knees drawn to his chest. I recognize the mirror instantly as the mirror of Erised. With a frown, I walk in and close the door gently. Since his back is turned towards me he doesn't notice my presence. I walk slowly up to him as if approaching a wild animal.
I turn to my right and notice another butterfly on the handle of the doorknob to a broom closet. I walk slowly over, the butterflies flying away as I approach. I twist the brass knob hesitantly as to not make a noise. When the door opens an inch I look inside, my green eyes widening as a wave of realization washes over me. Inside is a much bigger room, the walls made of clear glass, much like a greenhouse. Ivy vines and other foliage crawls up the sides and hundreds of different colored butterflies flutter around the room. Other than the moonlight and stars lighting the room is a small candle, with a softly flickering flame. The orange warmth a contrast to the silver light coating everything. None of this shocks me as much as the other thing or should I person in the room.
~Harry's POV~
“ You think,” He says going to the other side of my neck. “ That id submit to the likes of you.” I shake my head.
Warning: Smut-if uncomfortable just skip to the "++++" sign.
"Why do you care 'Mione, he's just a fucking fag!" I yell. She jumps up quickly and stomps over to me, grabbing me by the collar. I brace for a punch to the face, my eyes slipping close in acceptance. The hit never comes and a strange feeling of disappointment fills my chest. No, I think to myself. I need to be hit, to be punished, I deserve it. But she's pulled back, hands wrapping around her waist calmly.
"I don't know." I huff quietly. "I don't know much of anything anymore."
"Sorry." I offer, making the group laugh.
I bite my lip as I squeeze my eyes shut tightly. His hands felt so good around my throat, squeezing it. I wished he squeezed tighter. I think subconsciously. When I catch the thought I reprimand myself. I shouldn't be thinking about these things. I shouldn't even be wanking right now, but I can't help it. I bite my tongue and groan, deciding to just fuck it so I can cum. I imagine him pressing his thigh into my crotch as his hands squeeze tighter and tighter. My mouth hangs open as my left-hand travels down my chin and over my kneck, I squeeze gently making my back arch and my breath quicken.
"I wasn't spying." I defend. He scoffs loudly.
Sweat coats my brow in thick beads as I work my hand up and down my length. My other hand covers my mouth to suppress any moans even though I know no one can hear me since I'm still in the room of requirements. I refuse to moan in this situation, especially when the reason I'm doing this is because of that pretentious prick. Why did he have to choke me? I think to myself angrily but the thought of hands around my throat makes me shiver as a wave of pleasure hits me. Why him of all people? I try to imagine someone else, anyone else doing that to me but my mind drifts back to that image. His cold eyes pinning me in place, along with his hands, of course, the image distorts and I imagine him placing his leg in between my thighs.
“Horny are we?” He asks, smirking proudly.
"What do you think?" She asks. Ron thinks it over before nodding.
I look down at his crotch in disbelief, his bulge straining against his trousers painfully. A we spot has formed at the tip making me drool. It take every ounce of strength to not pin his legs apart and taste him, to taste his sweet cu-
“Because my aunt and uncle will kill me. Literally.” I tilt my head to the side. “The one thing they hate more than magic is gays.” I nod understanding.
“Good boy.” Harry says rubbing my ass, I feel his lips against my hot skin and moan softly. “You did so good.” He says. I smile again and sigh in bliss as he keeps kissing my ass. I feel his hand reach between my legs and stroke my aching cock.
"Your stupid butterflies were in the hall so I followed them,"  I answer exasperated.  "How was I supposed to know Mister I hate everything is secretly a butterfly loving poof? " I spit viciously, myself flinching at the derogatory name. A look of horror registers on his face before it's replaced with even more anger. In the blink of an eye, I'm shoved against the door, Malfoys hand on my neck but not applying any pressure.  Pain laces through my shoulders and my breath is knocked out of me. I stare up at Malfoy, my anger boiling to a point that I'm positive the students in the Gryffindor tower can feel the heat rolling off of me.
“Yes, I'm a slut, Ma-master.” I feel myself leak precum, hearing myself say those words. He smirks as I stare at him wide eyed waiting for what he’s gonna do next. He spits in my face causing me to flinch. He takes his hand and rubs his spit all over my face making me cringe in disgust. A sick part of me enjoyed that as my cock aches to get out of my pants. Wiggling my hips I try to grind my cock against the fabric.
“10?” I ask, He spanks me again making me yelp out in pain. “10 master!” I say affirmatively. I look behind me and he nods, letting me know that's what he wanted me to do. He spanks me again.
“I get punished?” I ask, excitement flooding through my body.
"Damn it." I groan as I lean against the wall. I better get rid of this quick. I think to myself before pulling my member out of my pants. I moan and bite my lip as my hand works itself up and down. My chest rises and falls quickly as I lean my head back and close my eyes. My imagination runs wild making me buck my hips into my hand, fucking into it. I think of Potter's pretty lips wrapped around my swollen cock, his wet tongue swirling around my head. Spit dripping down his chin and down his kneck. Slowly soaking that cute little crop top.
“Three.” I reply. With every spank I yell out the corresponding number. My cock has made the arm of the couch wet by the time it’s over. I am pant exhausted and horny.
"I did. A long time ago but it changed." I say.
"Shit," I say stuffing myself back in my pants.
Suddenly Harry rushes at me. I think he’s going to hit me until I feel his lips against mine. A rough passionate kiss full of teeth and bumped noses. I hiss as his teeth catches on my lip, cutting it open. Blood coates our tongues but I don’t mind.
"I realized that they'd never come back and kind of accepted it, I guess."
"What...what do you see?" He asks. "If you don't mind me asking." I shrug, letting him know that I don't mind.
"I know," I admit.
"We know you're not homophobic Harry," He says calmly. I stiffen at his tone. Whenever Ron's quiet or calm is when he's emotional and that's when you need to worry. "And we know you wouldn't bully someone because of it."
"None of your bloody business!" He rages. "Why were you spying on me?"
"Then what are you doing here?" He questions. I look up into the mirror and see myself, smiling brightly, like I did the first year at Hogwarts-utterly happy and full of wonder, a genuine smile. I frown more as I stare at myself. I swallow thickly and bite my lip again, tasting copper.
“Good boy” He says genuinely before pulling on my pants and boxers. He rubs my ass, kneading it between his fingers. I moan softly and relax into the couch. “God your ass is fantastic.” He says. I smile proudly at the complement. “Too bad I have to ruin it.” I quirk an eyebrow.
"Right, best mates now." He smiles, a look in his eye I can't quite place. Hermoine makes a noise in the back of her throat as she stares at us, flicking her brown eyes back and forth. Sighing she uncrosses her arms and puts her hands on her hips in a motherly way, as if we're her children and she's explaining something.
"A party! And not just any party, an inter-house party!" She says with excitement.
"We're just helping Malfoy and Potter make up, right boys?" Blaise says, his tone encouraging us to follow along, a sly smirk on his face as he sips his butter beer spiked with fire whisky. I nod eagerly following his lead I slap Harry's shoulder in a way I would Blasie and smile/
"So are we friends now or something?" I squeak out. He sighs but after a second he speaks.
"Hermione! We're talking about Malfoy here, he's the one who started it with the degrading and triggering names." I defend. She looks at me with shock on her face, confusion and amazement present.
"I just want to get under Malfoy's skin," I say semi-honestly. It sounds so childish when I say it out loud.
"I was taking a bloody walk!" I yell back. "What the fuck are you doing, Malfoy? " I spit venomously.
The room slowly transforms into my butterfly pavilion, different coloured insects fly around leaving me in awe. It amazes me that this room can create the illusion of life. I wonder if it can create people too. Reaching out a hand a butterfly lands on my hand, its tiny legs tickling my skin. It feels real so I wonder...thinking hard I imagine someone, Harry to be exact. I think of his green eyes, his soft wild raven hair, his plump peach coloured lips. God his lips are perfect, I remember back to our kiss and think of his lips on my skin. His pink tongue against my cock.
"What kind of game?" A girl from Ravenclaw asks, to which Blaise smirks widely and likes his lips.
"You should apologize," Ron says.
I moan and pant until I cum. My back arching as drool comes from my lips. I pant exhausted as I feel Harry clean me up and put my pants back up. I stand up, wobbling a bit. Harry grabs my arms and straightens me out.
Harry's POV
I'm sitting lazily on top of a blue bean bag, letting my weight sink in heavily, a cup of spiked punch in my hand. I stare up at the ceiling and I let a smile curve my lips. Whoever set up the party enchanted the ceiling to look like the stars. I let my mind drift, thinking through the events of the other night with Potter. I'm happy he apologized, this feud truly has been exhausting. When he asked me what I saw in the mirror I told him the truth, well, most of it anyways. As my thoughts wander I begin picturing his eyes. Truly an enchanting shade of green, like raindrop covered trees in spring. I wish I could have fully examined them the other day but he kept avoiding eye contact. Being so close to him it was hard to not look at his lips, the color of peaches. I've often wondered if they taste as sweet or if it's another flavor just as enticing. A fleeting thought of Potters's lips wrapped around my-.
People begin to get up, chatting softly to each other, taking plates and cups strewn about to the trash where they disappear, no longer needed. Tired faces begin to walk out the door, one at a time until the room is empty.
Warning: BDSM, Spanking, Spitting, Degradation
"You're one to talk," I smirk kneeing her shoulder. "Have you seen your face when you're thinking of Granger?"
“Exactly. Now what’s going to happen?” He asks.
"By being homophobic and using words that are triggering for some people isn't the way to do it." Hermione chimes in. I look at her like she's grown a second head.
"Harry!" She yells. Confused I look over at her.
Plus, it's not like the wizarding world is all to accepting of lgbtq+ people, especially gay and lesbians, most likely due to their blood purity obsession. You can't have more purebloods if they can't reproduce since they like the same sex. Blah, blah, blah. And I'm Harry Fucking Potter, the boy who lived or whatever, people already hate me for "killing the dark lord" so piling being bisexual on top of that? No thank you. So I repress it, and it takes shape in unhealthy ways.
“Yes!” I squeak feeling embarrassed and aroused at the same time.
"It looks like you made the room conjure an image of me to give you a fucking blow job." He says exasperated.
"Out of everyone at Hogwarts, you are the last person I thought who would say something as ignorant and apathetic as that." He says sadly. He shakes his head and stares down at me with disappointment. "I guess I was wrong."
"What the bloody hell is going on?!" a voice cuts through the chatter, silencing everyone.
“You must never tell anyone about this. Ever.” Harry says, making me frown.
"Hmm?" Ron and I say in response.
I decided that to make up for what happened in the ROR after Malfoy left I had to push him away, make him hate me even more so that I can hate him. That way I can bury the memories of what I did in hatred instead of shame. I know it's stupid and probably won't work but I need to try.
"To be honest? No. It's not at all what I thought you'd want." I admit. He nods.
“Sluts don’t get to cum.” He says, throwing me over the arm of the couch. “And sluts get punished for trying.”
"Ooops." I say sarcastically. Malfoy hesitates before rolling over, my smile dropping from my face as I see blood seeping out of his mouth. His lip split and I see a tiny white shard of a tooth where his face landed. He looks up at me. Cool blue meeting green. His eyes are those pools of water for a second, a look of disappointment clear. I'm about to say something, not sure what when Hermione speaks up.
"You tell anyone about this," He starts quietly, a threat evident in his words. "and I will make your life a living hell." Unable to keep my god awful mouth shut I respond.
"Oh come on!" Pansy complains, knowing my intentions as I head to the bathroom. I slam the door and pant slightly as I feel myself getting harder and harder as the seconds go by. You can clearly see my bulge through my jeans. Involuntarily I jerk my hips forward, causing my cock to rub against my pants. A wave of pleasure rolls over my body making me moan lightly.
I pant loudly in the quiet room, a lazy smile on my face that is quickly whipped off as I realize what I've just done. I look down at my cum covered hand, disgusted with myself. It's not that I'm disgusted with the fact that I wanked to a guy choking me out but by the fact that the guy was Malfoy. It's not the first time I've wanked to a guy after all even though I was taught from an early age that people like me, "perverts", have no place on this earth and are unnatural thanks to the Dursely's. I have no problem with gay people or lgbtq+ folks, but it's different for me. If I admit to being bisexual Uncle Vernon would...to be fair I don't know what he would do. His "punishment" is different every time, but I know if I came out I would get hurt. Badly.
"Thank you." He says. I snap my head in his direction to see him look up at the mirror too. No malice or amusement is in his face so I choose to believe him. "And I'm sorry too, I know I haven't made your years here the easiest."
“How many do you think a slut like you deserves?” He asks.
Draco's POV
Once the words leave my mouth I recoil, surprised that I said all of that. I'm greeted with silence and I'm expecting him to laugh at me or maybe punch me.
"I've just...never heard you...laugh before." He blushes and turns back to the mirror.
"I...we'll see," I say finally. We fall into a neutral silence, not a comforting one or a resentful one. Just silence, each of us thinking. Suddenly Hermione claps her hands.
Shivering with lust I open my eyes to see Harry before me, on his knees between my leg. My breath hitches as he licks over my bulge through my pants, gently massaging the tip of my cock with his tongue. This can't be real, I think as he unzips my pants with his teeth. His soft hands take out my cock and strokes it as he licks my slit, flattening his tongue against it like a expert. Moaning I lean my head back as I watch him. It feels like Harry but something is off. His eyes are too sparkly and his skin looks too soft. All and all this is just too perfect to be real.
"Attention everyone!" I hear a voice say loudly, all the chatter cuts out. I peek my eyes open and stare at Blaise, who's standing on top of a table by the fireplace. "Who wants to play a game?"
"What, that you like butterflies or cock, faggot?" I smirk but my stomach twists in disgust at my own words. Sadness flashes over his face but it's quickly repressed. His hand squeezes my throat making me gasp in fear. He could kill me right here and nobody would ever know. I probably deserve it. He grabs me by the collar and throws me down on the ground. As he reaches for the doorknob he stops and turns back to me.
With gentle steps, I walk forward and raise my hand up towards the insect. The butterfly registers my presses and flutters down to sit on the tip of my pointer finger. Growing more and more curious as the seconds tick by, the school's clock in the background whispering a constant tick, tick, tick in my ears when yet another butterfly lands on my nose. This one being a light purple with golden flecks. Irritation sparks inside me as my confusion grows ever steadily.
"Fair enough." He says.
"Anyone who doesn't want to play follow me, we'll play a different game." A Hufflepuff calls, a look of relief washes over the faces of the weary and they follow her to the other side of the room. I push myself off of the bean bag and start towards the safe side of the room when a mop of black curly hair catches my eyes. Potter is being dragged over to the Chicken side by an excited looking Weasly. Automatically my body turns and begins walking in their direction. Blaise notices my presence and smirks wildly at me. I roll my eyes at him and sit next to a Ravenclaw with blond hair.
The door swings open and my reaching orgasm dies instantly. Horror pulsating through my body. I try and cover myself as the intruder looks at me, their emerald eyes widening in shock.
Weasly drains a bottle of butterbeer and sets it in the middle, I notice a wink shared between him and Blaise and I have to bite my tongue in order not to gag. I don't hate their relationship it's just that they're so overly cute it's disgusting. I prop my knee up and rest my arms on it as I watch the game unfold. When it's my turn I lazily spin it, not really caring who it lands on because it won't be the person I want it to be. I follow the direction of the neck of the bottle up with my eyes and I'm met with a pair of stunning emerald ones.
"Chicken," Blaise answers making my stomach drop. Chicken is the extreme version of spin the bottle. The first person to pull away is labeled a chicken. Sometimes players have gone so far as to have sex in front of the other players.
“Mmm, fuck.” He says, moaning. Smirking proudly I begin to kiss his neck, deciding that it looked rather bare. Turning us around I press him into the cool concrete wall. Rubbing his hips between my fingers he lets out an almost purring sound. I stop and look at him, admiring his beauty. His eyes crack open and he looks at me, a fog lifts and anger appears again.
"Then when did this happen?" I ask.
"What the fuck are you doing, Potter?" He yells murderously. The room of requirements being soundproof means he can yell at me as loud as he wants and nobody would hear him. It also means he can murder me and no one would hear my screams. Anger blooms in my chest making my face feel hot.
Sighing, I leave the bathroom with my head held high and my hands in my pocket acting as if nothing happened. I make my way back to Pansy but find her sneaking out of the ROR with a giggling Hermione. I raise an eyebrow but smile at their antics. Flopping down on my bean bag I close my eyes and pinch the bridge of my nose. This night can't get any worse I think to myself.
“I tried to cum sir.” I say softly.
I should be turned off and humiliated that my crush saw me masturbating but Potter's wide eyes and blushing face sends a deep shiver down my body, making me accidentally brush my cock against my pants. I throw my head back and bite my hand hard as I cum, my hips bucking forward and my body shaking. I pant loudly as I come down from my high, my mind buzzing with euphoria. I look down at my crotch and curse when I see a wet spot. I strip off the black hoodie that I was wearing and wrap the sleeves around my waist. The cloth covering my accident. I turn on the tap and quickly rinse my hands and fix my hair. A light blush coats my cheeks and my pupils are dilated.
“You're just a slut aren’t you? Wanting it from a fucking merrage.” He scoffs as he looks at me in disgust. I bite my lip as my cock throbs at his words. “”Answer me!” He says gripping into the skin on my wrists.
Without realizing it, I've opened the door wider in my shocked daze. The motion catches Malfoys gaze, the world seems to slow down as I see the emotions register on his face: Shock, Confusion, Fear, and finally Anger. In less than a second, those warm puddles in his eyes are frozen over like ice. Malfoy jumps up quickly and stomps over to me, pulling me in by the collar of my shirt and slamming the door closed.
Fuck. I think to myself. I look around the circle in fear but all I see are wanting eyes glazed over with horniness. I look over at Ron and he's smirking at me, I open my mouth to say something but he pushes me in the circle. I sigh and shyly crawl into the center on my hands and knees. Malfoy stares at me with wide eyes and I squint at him.
I sadden at the thought of him. I didn't know him well, I just saw him in the halls sometimes and when I was in the stands during the tournament. From what I've seen though he was kind. What I remember most though was that this girl with blue hair with a strange name went ballistic, even more than Cho. She was screaming and crying more than anyone I've ever seen. Before he died I saw them together a few times. They were really close. It was heartbreaking to watch but it strangely reminded me of something. It was...familiar. She's a strange character, all combat boots and everything black but a heart made of gold. With her appearance, it's hard to understand how she's a Hufflepuff. What's even stranger is that she appears in a few of my nightmares, usually the most horrid ones.
"I'll show you a thing or two about beauty." Hermione says.
“You good?” Harry asked a few moments later.
"Draco, this is Neville Longbottom." Harry said as he placed a hand on the lean, blonde man who waved at Draco. "And that one right there is Blaise Zabini." He finished pointing at the brown skinned man.
And with that, Draco breathes in relief.
“So, you ready to go?” Ron asks his friend.
"Thanks." Draco said shyly as Tori whined at them, making both men look at her.
"This all looks great."
"I'm going to miss you."
"White wine will do." Harry says.
As soon as their shoes and socks are off, Harry’s pants are on the floor and both men’s shirts are off, Draco runs his hands all over Harry’s body.
Once the shirt is off, Draco pulls Harry closer and starts kissing him again.
"Yeah, and people called me corny for that instead of spending all of my money."
"No way, José."
"If she'll like the water." Draco answered as he smirked at the raven haired man. He then placed a kiss on Tori's bare stomach before he grabbed her bear onesie and put in on her.
"I don't know, man. It just sucks really. Badly. God, he was a great guy." Harry says no longer sounding depressed or sad. “This really sucks, because I finally found somebody who could’ve been the one, and he turned out to be a fucking jerk.”
"Come on, Malfoy. Everyone needs someone, even you." Harry says while grabbing a hold of Draco's hands. "What are you afraid of?" Harry says putting his head on Draco's shoulder, wishing he could do nothing more, than to help his friend find someone.
"I need some advice."
And That's All, Folks!
The crazy part? Had we gotten our shit together, we could’ve been married for over a decade if he wasn’t a bed hopping man whore and me a person who’s to clingy, but whatever.
“So I can see you get off on me.” He simply says. Harry starts stroking Draco in time with his thrusts in a perfect rhythm, until Draco moans, heavily.
"It's just a pair of jeans and a shirt with a blazer thrown on." Draco said.
"You're smart, loyal, and awesome."
"Don't worry." Harry told him. "Besides, he has a baby, so he needs a warm place to stay since his ex walked out on them."
"Do they want me to leave?"
"So, you like Harry, right?" Blaise asked Draco as he was about to go back to work.
"Okay."
At this moment, Draco is hoping that Harry didn't see his cheeks turn red in the dimly lit room.
"Sure. Thank you, Inferno." Harry smiled at Inferno.
Both men eat their food talking about the current season of
"Which was how he got a hickey." Hermione says.
“Harry, I truly am-” Draco starts to say, but Harry continues with his rant.
"Come on, Malfoy. Everyone needs someone, even you." Harry says while grabbing a hold of Draco's hands. "What are you afraid of?" Harry says putting his head on Draco's shoulder, wishing he could do nothing more, than to help his friend find someone.
"Fine, but nothing too big." He reluctantly agrees.
"Hey, Har-bear! Shouldn't you be sleeping?" Draco asked Harry. “I mean, I remember you telling me about a client meeting taking place tomorrow, so….”
? Well we've been classmates for……well, basically
"I want to go slow, but you're making it very hard not to pounce on you."
"Are you alright?" Harry asked him worriedly as he helped the blonde gentleman to a seat.
After another hang out session with Ron, Draco decided that he wants Ron to meet up with Harry after a few weeks.
"Ok." Draco said as Harry handed Victoria back to her father.
Harry nodded his head and opened the door wider to let his parents in, still wondering how to tell them about Tori and Draco. He had simply invited them into his life without telling them, so he wondered what they were going to think now that they were here.
birthday party when someone was trying to get with him. My Draco, who was the one who encouraged me to be take things slow instead of trying too hard when I was dating back in our 20s when I was ready to settle down.
This time Draco snorts as he took more pictures of Tori who was lying next to her teddy bear.
"We're gonna be great." Harry told her.
He wonders.
"Draco why are you so down? I can feel all that sadness oozing out of you." Neville says, completely shocked.
"Your parents are very nice, especially your mom."
"All of that attitude for a simple question?"
Once they are in bed, Draco climbs on top of Harry and starts kissing from his bellybutton all the way up to his neck, then finally his lips.
Share our meals at a restaurant.
“Like what you see?” A naked Harry teases.
"Don't you ever sit down?" The Irish man asks his boyfriend of three years.
Harry stopped wiping Tori and looked at the blonde.
Sandwiches And Kisses
Victoria gurgled loudly.
Ron holds out his glass for Hermione, "To new beginnings?"
"Can I tell you a secret, Tori?"
"We'll cuddle later if you like, but right now, Tori needs a change." Harry says as Draco leave the kitchen to find a diaper.
Draco perks the fuck up.
"At least her clothes are on correctly." Draco says.
"You mean you're just giving up?"
34 year old Harry Potter was rushing around his cozy little home, making everything was perfect his dinner date with Seamus.
"Come on, Draco. For me? Please?" Sirius asks as he snickers.
"What do you mean?"
“Jealousy is not a good look on you, Harry.” Hermione says. “And so is the color orange.”
"Just the cheek again, please?" Harry offered causing Draco to nod.
"Fuck." Harry moans.
"Forget that! I'm happy that I didn't have to pay because I didn't have enough money at all. All I have in my wallet is $8.62, three credit cards, my driver’s license and my tap card." He says with a small smile on his face.
Harry wiped the crumbs from Draco's bottom lip with his thumb.
Draco smiles as he sees Harry staring out the window with Tori in his arms, talking to her.
"Hello, there." Luna says as she's bouncing Tori in her arms. "I apologize on the behalf of the chef. Ron is acting like Chef Ramsey, and Hermione is telling him how to do things correctly. At this rate, you'll be having dessert before an actual meal thanks to Justin and Neville."
“Because you’re the husband.” Ron automatically supplies, very nonchalantly.
"You and Ron? Already?" Harry asks as he gives Hermione a big smile.
"Potter, there wasn't any snot."
“Happy birthday, Potter.”
"You do know that you don't have to do that, right?"
"At first, I had declined the drink, because I didn't know what he was expecting from me. He must've sensed that I have never done anything like that before. He had out his hand on my thigh-"
"Hold on. Ron, when do you wanna hang with Harry and his friend Hermione?”
“Yeah.” Draco says placing both hands behind his head.
Later that evening, Draco went over to Harry’s house and banged on his door.
Yup. I’m seeing Inferno tonight.
"What the-?" Harry says as he looks in his rear view mirror. He sees Draco walking on the sidewalk "What do I do?" He wonders before pulling away from the curb.
"Please, Harry? What else is there?" Draco asks with his voice cracking.
"Ah." He simple says, shrugging.
situation, I have to be honest and say that I was dishonest with myself as well. The simplest thing in my life, I made it so complicated, especially when there was something right in front I my face turned out to be my greatest achievement in terms of having the love that I've always dreamed of. You've always been honest with me, and that's something that never fails to amuse me. All though honesty is an important thing to me, it is both a blessing and curse because it can either make or break you. In the long run, I’d rather someone be honest to me instead of lying to me because lying is the one thing that hurts in more ways than one.
"Best way to end the work week." Harry says, pouring the wine into their wine glasses.
“I’m sick of this.” Harry says totally defeated.
"As I was saying, tonight will be the best date of your lives, hosted by yours truly." Justin says as he motions to himself. "Now, what would you like to drink? Will white wine do?"
Ok, except his parents, but whatever.
"We'll see." Draco snort as he opens his book. "The last time I was under the mistletoe, I was kissed by my auntie Bella."
best friend.
Harry simply stared at him.
Spring time in Paris feels so good to me
"But why?" Draco asked.
"I love you too, Draco." Harry responds.
“Don’t use that cologne I love on you. You’d probably be taken from me.” Draco jokes.
He’ll never forget when she found out that he was gay.
"You'll never know, Harry. Things will get better, plus you'll find an even better man. Besides, he couldn’t have been that nice." Draco said trying to cheer Harry up.
The place is loud, colorful and nearly filled to capacity. The song that is currently blasting through the place is Katy Perry's
He’s fucked his best friend on occasion, but something about fucking a depressed Harry always made him complete.
As Draco and Ron leave Harry’s office, Hermione turns to Harry.
“And your cock feels so good inside of me.” Harry moans as he is gripping onto his bed sheets.
Lily holds her heart.
"I'm starved. Let’s sit together while these two can stare at our beauty." Draco said.
I wanna share the world with you, you see
"We? Who’s
"What does that even mean, Weasley?" Draco asks frowning at his best friend.
Draco smiles.
“Don’t worry about that, Draco. What’s done is done at this point. You might be able to find him at your friend's house. But take someone with you because you look a little bit frazzled.”
"Please, Harry! Relax for a moment!" Seamus says, but Harry is still in a rush.
At this moment in time, Tori sneezes, scrunching up her nose and Harry gasps. He quickly gets up to grab a tissue and wipes her little nose.
"I've been hanging in there!" He says while patting Neville on the back. "How've you been?" He asks when they pull away from the hug.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand, making the blonde blush.
“I hope you’re having a good birthday.” Draco says in betwixt kisses.
“I’m not jealous!” He denies.
"You really like her don't you?"
Draco's cock is standing rigid, sticking up straight into the air at an angle. Harry eyes it hungrily and he wraps a hand around it, giving it a quick stroke. He probably shouldn’t be doing this, he thinks as his mouth waters, but then Draco's dick twitches in his grasp and he licks his lips and swallows the head down.
Ron sighs.
He's accepted the fact the Draco belongs to someone else, and he's fine with it. He just wonders when Draco will see it.
At first, Harry thought that it felt so wrong to be taken in this fashion. Draco’s tongue fucked his hole like a cock, fast and wet. Harry tensed at the sensations. "No," Harry murmured, as he threw his head back. "Stop."
No response.
Ernie blushes.
"Don't flatter yourself, Potter." Draco said as the blonde came over and gave the credit card back to Harry, who have the man a generous tip. Once they exited the restaurant, they took their sweet time going to the car.
"You don't like him like that, do you?" Blaise asked, getting ready to get on Draco's case.
"Alright, here we are. Two orders of nachos for the future husband and wife."
“I don’t know.” Harry sighs.
Harry watched as the wet man lifted his hands to lift up the cover of the stroller, checking on his baby who was dry and sleeping quietly. Harry smiled at the baby, trying not to coo so loudly.
"Aww, she recognizes you." Hermione said.
"Ok." He says as he hands Tori over to Neville. "I'm going to see if they have any food and beer."
Why did this have to happen now? Of all days, it had to happen when time was off the essence?
"Yeah." Draco nods as he smiled. "I missed my little angel."
His compassion.
"Ah! Nah, nah, nah. Hell no! You know I fucking hate parties!" He says, making a disgusted face at her idea.
"I overslept." He tells her without looking at his best friend.
"You're all nuts. Harry knows I can smoke all of you bitches down into the ground."
"You think that kissing me would change my mind?" A hysterical Harry asked him. “Did you honestly think that kissing me would achieve anything at all?”
Ron starts laughing like crazy.
“Draco.”
"What's a
They go at it for a few minutes completely lost in their own world. This kiss was…different from all the other kisses that Harry experienced from Draco, and little did he know, Draco was thinking the exact same thing. As they continued to kiss deeply for the first time in so long, there was no fight for dominance at all. Harry allowed him to take control when Draco tried for it, and easily gave it back when Harry allowed him to. It was comfortable.
"We are going to H&M first, then we're going to Target to get some toys." Harry says excitedly.
"I’m sorry." Ron tells them through his chuckles. "So what will you have?"
"Hell, yeah!" Draco says happily. "No wine, no dine. A simple beer, a quick fuck and a chat with Harry before I go to bed."
"Fine. Just one hookup." Harry groans.
Sometime later, Harry wakes up with an empty bottle and an empty plate.
"Are you sure, Draco? I really wouldn't mind if you joined us." Harry says.
"You are not leaving us alone, Ronald Weasley!" Hermione warns.
“Tell me about it.” Draco says.
"Oh well. At least that's an upside." She says walking towards the couch with the pizza and wings. "Well, Potter, we have pizza, wings, wine, salted caramel ice cream and cheesy ass movies." Hermione says while Harry opens up the bottle.
"Harry, are you fucking kidding me? I have something really important to say, so could you please stop? Please?" Draco begs him.
“I was trying to help you by prote-”
Draco pauses.
"Right there!" She yells out as she bounces on him.
Hermione grins as she rocked a gurgling Tori in her arms.
"I'm your only cousin that you care about, Sirius. Well, Tonks and I are the only cousins you care for. Anyway, it's not about- hang on. How did you find out about the contract?"
“Finally.” Harry says once everything is off of the blonde.
"You want it?" He asks as he puts the condom on his length.
"Seriously though, thank you for tonight, Potter. I had a lot of fun."
"Draco?"
"Of course." Harry said. "Since you're going so stay here for a while, care to go shopping?"
“Thanks.” Harry says, perking up.
Draco nods and follows him into the kitchen.
"Don't fill up on too many now." Harry says as he puts the platter down on the coffee table. "I made some stuffed bell peppers and cooked some rice.
"I usually cook all the time when my friends come over. If i can say that because we all have keys to each other's homes." Harry says before he takes a bite of pasta from his own plate.
"That sack of shit?" Ron asks.
Harry smiles brightly.
Draco smiles at his sincerity, but he looks down as Harry get distracted playing with Tori. He wants to believe the man, but he has a hard time doing so.
Draco cuts him off. "It's okay Harry. Now what's the problem?"
again Draco?" A giggling says Sirius.
"Well what have we been doing for the last 10 years of our life, Potter? I mean I can honestly say that you’re the most beautiful man I've ever met, who is kind, caring and great. Harry, you really bring out the best in me, and sometimes I feel that you don’t have to try hard to complete me. I love the fact that you put yourself last because you take care of everyone else, while I put you first because you’re the most important man in my life, Harry. Sometimes I feel like it's me and you against the world and it’s scary, but it feels right. It feels so right. Harry, what I’m trying to say is that you are my one and only soul mate.”
“Stop.” Harry says.
"Nice to meet you." Hermione tells him as Ron helps her stand to shakes Dean’s hand.
Harry simply tilts his head and gives her a look, smirking at her as he shakes his head at her while she smiles at him.
He’s starting to panic.
Enjoy today.
part.
"According to my best friend, I have a knack for kids. I guess they like me or something." Harry says as he shrugs as he starts feeding the baby.
"Potter."
It's someone trying to hook up with him.
Harry can only smile at that statement because it was true. He was extremely happy that he was doing something with Inferno, and he was happy that Hermione was seeing Ron. Now, as much as he was very happy that Hermione and Ron were now dating, he was certain that she was craving more gossip about him and Inferno. They were almost one in the same in that aspect whenever one of them would find someone to date. He turns to his computer and shows Hermione a picture of Inferno that’s currently on his background.
He's ready to resolve the conflict between Harry and himself. Life has been hard without him.
"I was hoping it would." Draco says.
"She's so cheeky." Draco said.
which makes me feel bad for him."
“No, but I wanna ride you.” He says.
"Anyway, this was a hot hookup! The theory on black men is true! They
"That's so true." Harry says as he blows more raspberries in her neck.
He started placing everything together based on his dream and how Harry had been showering him with love and affection. The fact that Harry had been the only man that he’d ever slept with without any protection also sprung in his mind for some odd reason. Everything with Harry had just been so… right and he felt so oblivious to his feelings about Harry for so long.
"Another one."
"Uh.... this isn't exactly a party for a promotion."
Draco couldn't help but look into Harry's eyes because of the gaze boring into his temples.
He thinks to himself. “This is highly unacceptable. I need to call him back, now!”
"See, had you met up with this.... stranger before, like Harry asked you to several times before, this wouldn't have happened." Ron stated. "With that being said, I would have told him."
“He what?!” An angry Draco asks.
"I remember,
"Alright."
"Her name is Victoria." Draco answered.
"I concur. That was out of this world!" Hermione says with a smile on her face.
"Harry-"
“Malfoy, have you ever bottomed before?”
"How do you want this?" Draco asks him after five minutes of vigorous kissing.
"That's because you're funny looking."
"Do you like him?" Ron decided to ask him in a kind tone.
"I can help you so that you won't be alone."
"I love that you’re so into the character at the moment. It’s adorable and it’s also priceless!" Harry laughs.
"I love you, Potter." Draco tells Harry before kissing him. “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
?" Harry suggested.
Feel.
"What now, Draco?" A now irritated Harry asks him.
"I'm leaving in three days." Harry tells him.
“Anyway, thanks again for the recipe and for the suggestion on the course. You truly are the best, Sirius.” Harry tells him.
"Thanks." He says.
"No, not yet."
Neville laughs, and then asks, "Why not?"
Draco is enjoying the show as he takes off his underwear.
"I have a guest coming home with me."
"Calm down, blondie. She's in the kitchen with Ron."
“Oh, fuck!” Harry moaned in complete happiness as Draco grabbed him by the hips and fucked into him. “Oh, yeah, babe! Fuck me harder! Please, fuck me harder.”
"No!"
It's quiet for a moment while Harry is holding baby Victoria.
"That's ok, but I have to ask, should I be jealous?"
"Well-" Harry starts, but he's stumped.
"Yeah. She loves keeping her head in books that she can forget reality sometimes."
Harry ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥
A waiter comes to the table and pours wine into Harry and Justin’s glass.
"Ok, calm down. I'll call Sirius and see if he's seen or heard from him, alright? Hermione says, trying to calm Draco down.
"Yeah, yeah. Anyway, Harry thinks he's so in love that he thinks that this guy named Inferno, could finally be the one. I don't think that I'm going to exist to Harry anymore."
"Isn't.... Don't you think that getting a crib and a whole room for Tori mean something? What does that mean to you, Potter?"
"Anytime. Well, my break is over, but I am sure that we're going to hang out soon, so I'll see you later."
"Oh yeah, you feel so good." He tells her as he trusts into her.
All these years of convincing Draco that he is capable of being loved by another, and giving love to another man, has finally paid off. I’m happy that it finally took some convincing that he is a good man capable of finding true love and that will always be a part of me.
"Nice to meet you." Hermione says.
"We have to get them married." Justin says.
"I can't believe that this is how you tell me." Draco  says, becoming angry as the time passes. He honestly can't believe that Harry would break this heart breaking news.
"Yup. She gives me everything she needs to give me when she's on stage. We should go one day."
, the duo went to a bar a few blocks from the office. Hermione was talking to him about her case on a woman who had slapped a man because his dog ate her ring. Harry was simply listening to her and paying attention to her ramble on and on about the case. She also told Harry that she was dating a new man named Oliver Wood and that she felt good around him. When she finished talking about Oliver, she asked him about his love life and he told her that his boyfriend broke up with him.
"Yeah. Are you babysitting?" James asked with a chuckle.
When his grip left Harry’s length, he ran his hand all over Harry’s body. He then intertwined their fingers together, both hand’s above Harry’s head. Draco kissed Harry all over his face as he started to feel his gut tightening. He lost it when Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco’s gray eyes. Draco forced Harry’s legs wider with Harry accommodating him as he came deep inside of Harry. When he was emptied out, he collapsed upon Harry, feeling drained but satisfied and happy.
Once they were outside, Draco unbuttoned his shirt. Neville looked at Draco, and noticed that he looks as if he's on the verge of tears.
"Anyway, I had a long day full of cases and I got home late, so I ate some spaghetti, drank wine, watched
Justin sighs.
"So, you were busy." Draco greets. "Get it, Har-bear!"
"Harry, wait!" Draco says, but the line dies.
"She sure did." Ron confirmed.
The look on Harry's face intimidated him.
"Excuse me, but who was the first one to hold her?" Hermione says.
Draco's hole is finally unclenching, due to the sudden wetness inside, but it just clenches right back, repeatedly, and Harry loves it, and fucks through it, allowing the tight muscles in Draco's hole milk his orgasm out and bury his seed deep inside Draco's hole. Maybe he can lick it out later.
The next morning, Draco let out a content sigh as he snuggled into the soft pillow. As he closed his eyes again to bask in the moment of being comfortable, a small golden retriever was sniffing around the pull out bed. Draco smiled when the dog's wet nose was on his hand.
“More than anything, Potter. Make me forget about everything. My body is all yours.”
"I have to tell you, I just went south of the border, and the trip was amazing! I should think about bottoming one day."
"Nah. I don't have much of an appetite to be honest. Let's just get your food and go back home."
“Ok, I’ll let you go. ‘Til tomorrow, babe. And Harry?
Dear Birthday Boy,
A minute later, they are out the door.
"Well, I guess it's true, because you aren't miserable when he's not gone." Ron says sarcastically, hoping that Draco would catch on.
"No I wasn't!" Harry denies.
"So what's you're name?"
At that point, Draco looked sleepily over at the side where Harry was playing with is daughter with his heart fluttering, watching as Harry pressed a kiss onto Victoria's hand. Goyle never did that, and it pissed Draco off because Goyle treated her as if she were the plague. It was nice that someone else made Victoria smile.
“Jealousy is not a good look on you, Harry.” Hermione says. “And so is the color orange.”
“Did you learn that from somewhere?" Draco groans in Harry’s ear, and Harry only moans some more.
Harry starts kissing down Draco’s torso.
In that moment, Draco sat there for a moment and started to think. It did seem logical for Tori to have a crib for her instead of sleeping on a couch, in her car seat or on their chests half the time. He still wasn't sure if he was staying or living with Harry, and while he was honest enough to say that he wanted to live Harry, this felt like a little bit to much to handle.
"Oh yeah." He moans. Hermione takes more of Ron in, stroking him, leading her hand and mouth in sync with one another for a while.
It can’t be love.
"Yeah. Inferno should be here in about…maybe an hour or so."
Just as he finishes his statement, a hookup pops up on his iPad. He reads the mysterious guy's profile, and is fascinated by what he sees. He looks at his watch, and decides to meet his hookup.
"Even your parents."
“You got it.” Luna says as she writes the order down on her notepad. “You two make a lovely married couple.
"Here." Draco said handing Harry his birthday gift.
"We're gonna watch the greatest Disney movie on Earth, princess!" He said as he sat Tori up on his lap, but Tori simply brought her hand to her mouth, cooing loudly at him as she stared at him. He smiled fondly, kissing her forehead wondering why anyone would ever leave this little bundle of joy. He rubbed her stomach gently listening to the sound of Harry walking down the stairs.
"Hey, we figured that it would be better for him to tell you that he was leaving himself. I'm sorry about that." The red head tells him.
Draco started shaking his head in disbelief.
“What if I got Ron to tell you?” Hermione asks after a few moments of silence.
"You know," Harry says. "I don't mind you putting your hand on my thigh again. This drink really calmed my nerves."
"Remind me to thank Harry for that by making his favorite meal." Sirius says while wiping the tears away. “Go on with your story." Sirius tells him, finally trying to catch his breath.
"Whatever." He said to Harry.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, me buying clothes for people is not a waste, got it? I'm doing this because I want to, and you don't even have to pay me back." Neville says.
Ron takes a deep breath.
"I said one peck."
Don't need nobody, as long as we got each other
Still, no response.
"That's adorable. She looks just like you." She gushed.
Draco loved hearing her laugh. It was music to his ears. He tickled her sides over and over again, making her burst with giggles as her tongue was sticking out a bit.
"Well, I did get a new position."
"Before you leave, Draco, I just need to know something." Harry says.
"You know that a gentleman never kisses and tells." Harry says as he shuffled his papers around, trying to look busy .
"But, Harry-" She begins to say, but he cuts her off.
in disbelief.
"It has a pool."
“Fuck me.” Harry pleads as he grips the bed sheets very tightly causing them the rip.
"Yup. I don't need anybody but you, Hermione, Sirius and now Ron." He says before leaning in to peck Harry's lips.
"Of course! Giving a baby a bath is very simple. I think it's better than giving a six year old one. One time, I was babysitting for my neighbor, and he dumped a whole bucket of water on my head."
Harry throws his head back with pleasure. Draco’s tongue delved in once more. It was pushing at the muscular ring of Harry’s opening. He could feel Draco’s tongue entering him. He knew that it was wrong, but it felt so good. Draco kissed his hole and licked again. He pushed his tongue in past the muscle and Harry gave way.
"You sound miserable." Draco says.
"Not since last night after your double date. He did call last night, but I honestly can't remember what it was about because I have a terrible flu. Anyway, what’s with Harry?”
She smiles.
themed party. At least we read the books together when they first came out. I was so bored of reading the
"Shut up." Harry playfully tells her.
Harry digs through the bag and pulls up a picture of the two of them in college. In the picture, a cake covered Harry and a pristine Draco are standing with their backs together, making goofy faces at the camera.
"I don't care." Harry responds sadly, pulling away from Draco to close the door.
"Than- Dean!" Ron says once he looks up. "How is it going?"
He wanted to ride Draco.
"Ready to go home?" Harry asked as he finished the last of his wine and took out his wallet.
Fortunately for Harry, the tightness makes it that much better. The pressure is intense and Draco's hole is already incredibly wet from Harry's tongue, but also so very hot. It's unbearable, really, and Harry loves it. He pulls out without exiting completely and slams himself back in, enjoying the way Draco cries out as Harry presses against Draco's prostate. He repeats the action with steady, precise thrusts, again and again, until he works up a rhythm and continues at that pace.
"I told you that she'd look cute in it. Doesn't she look adorable?"
"I had to learn the hard way when
"Hermione, you're the only other person we have here as a lawyer and I’m pretty sure you have heard about the contract between Harry and I. Can you see if this-" Draco says, pulling out his copy of the contract from his wallet. "- is still legally binding and valid?"
"Something I should have done a long time ago." Draco says, pulling out his wallet.
"Let's go."
"I'll see you later." Harry tells his friends as he leaves the staffroom.
Ron rolls his eyes and scoffs real loudly.
"No, I like being here." Draco said.
"You okay back there?" Harry asked. "You look a bit wary if you ask me."
"Why?" A blushing Draco asks.
"That's good." Draco says as Harry pulls into his driveway. "I would choose my daughter over money any day."
“Let’s go to the bed.” Draco says running his hand all over Harry’s crotch.
“Here we go.” He tells himself, walking through the door. After about a minute or so, he immediately spots Harry sitting at the bar.
Now that he thought about it, he should have told Draco that he was going away.
"Really?"
Harry chuckles.
"I better take him home." Ron tells them. "Come on, buddy. Let's get you home."
Draco thinks for a moment.
"Bitch, don't kill my vibe." Neville says in a sing-song voice as he  flicked him off. "Now, go take those off so I can pay for them. We need to finish get you all dolled up for the surprise."
"You're on!" Ron says shaking his friend's hand. "You're buying the popcorn and I got the drinks and the candy!"
"Draco?"
Any journey with you makes me happy to live, and no one has ever shown me how to be…..well, Draco. Every little thing I do, you’re on my mind. It’s as though you are able to see right into my soul, as if I were a canvas or something. You’re more than just my lover. You’re my best friend and even though we’ve known each other for the longest time, you’re still so complex and interesting in ways that I could not have imagined. And I don’t care what you think right now about my statements, but we’re gonna be together forever.
"As long as they're Rated G or PG. I don't want Tori to hear anything that has any type of cursing in it." Draco said as he picked up his daughter.
"Draco!" Ernie greets as he opened the door for Draco.
After getting his drink, he notices something strange about Harry.
“It’s like a new dimension misery of being single.”
He took a sip from his drink and deleted the app from his phone, not even noticing that Ron had entered the bar and sat down next to him.
"I'm fine." Seamus says sarcastically.
“I’ll call you back in a bit.” Hermione says before she hangs up and calls Sirius.
Harry paused.
"Yeah?"
"Harry, I know that I'm not your Prince Charming at all. Trust me, I know that, Harry. I really do. I know that you don't need anyone, but you deserve someone and I want to be that someone."
"Ok. One drink, coming up." Inferno says.
"Really? I don't find that surprising considering I was known as the chosen one for a minute."
Draco thrusts into him for a few moments, listening to Harry’s manta
“Why?”
"Got a diaper." He said holding a diaper in one hand and wipes in the other.
Harry decides to shave a little bit, before hopping in the shower hot shower that he had going. In the shower, he sings one of his favorite Cheap Tricks songs.
All of a sudden, Draco finds himself in Harry's embrace.
He drops his pants as she grabs a condom.
"Wow." Inferno says holding in a chuckle.
"I… I…" Draco says.
"Then what am I?"
“Dammit!”
when you knew that you were lying to my face the whole entire time, after you hooked up with Flash?! You're a fucking man whore, Malfoy!” Harry spits out. “You will never know shit about being in a monogamous relationship! Why? Because
"What? Since when, and who is it? Is it one of your friends?""
"Because everyone deserves someone, even if they don't believe in that concept. Even if they are scared of it, they'll never know who they deserve as a soulmate if they don't take the chance. But enough about that. Where's your future husband? It's weird not seeing Harry here with you at all."
At one point as Harry is riding him, Draco gently pulls Harry by his neck and kisses Harry like he’s the only thing that matters to him.
"It wasn't my fault that you were sleeping like the dead." Harry said. "I tried to wake you up, but you were totally knocked out."
"It's pretty easy, especially since I wander around sometimes." Harry answered as Draco placed a kiss on Tori's head as he followed the other man to the bathroom. "Ok, time for bath time, Princess." Harry says excitedly.
Hermione Jean Granger was the first person that Harry met at the law firm where they first interned- now work at. At first, she was taken aback by his charming looks, friendly demeanor and the fact that he was almost always right based on his instincts was something that she found highly attractive. What she liked about Harry was the fact that he wasn’t like every other man who would approach her acting “macho” and that he didn’t treat her like an object to prize that was meant to be won.
Harry chuckles.
"Just know that I would never do what he did."
"Don't repeat what I said." Harry grinned as he rubbed her stomach.
He lies down on his back and Harry lowers himself on Draco’s cock.
"I guess I’ll try and squeeze myself into one." He tells her as he drops his underwear.
"She's really cute!" Hermione gushed as she took Tori's little hand and shook it.
"So, my baby is going to have swag?"
"Please shoot me if I ever go to bed at 10 pm." Draco says as they put the weights back.
"It's fucking frustrating because it's
"You showed me a picture of Blaise holding his little cousin. He didn't even carry him correctly!"
"Oh yeah!" She moans loudly as he starts to go deeper and deeper inside of her. He thrusts harder and harder, but keeps a slow steady pace. She starts crying tears of joy and tells him, "Oh Ron, I love this! Give it to me! Harder!" She cries and he flips their position so that he is on his back on the bed.
“But, I don’t know where to start looking for him and he still doesn’t want to talk to me because-"
"I know you can, Harry, but I don't want you to get hurt. I just want you to know that I'll always be here for you and I know you're making the right decisions for yourself."
"I don't know what to do. I'm sick of chasing men, only to get my heart broken, time and time again. It's so damn frustrating finding my heart in pieces in the grass all the time." A dejected Harry says.
Draco pushes his ass down into the feel of Harry's tongue, making an aborted noise at the wet touch. Harry pulls back and smirks smugly, then pulls a hand down to rub a thumb over Draco's entrance, watching with entrance as he moves the fine, wet hairs around Draco's hole. He licks his lips again and bends back down, burying his face in between Draco's spread cheeks and digging his tongue in, licking at Draco's hole and lapping the excess of saliva that spills out and pools around it.
"Yes, but only because I fell into a pool late at night and no one was around for a good minute until someone saved me." Draco responded.
Draco stops eating Harry.
"So, do you have any condoms, or do we have to use the spare ones?"
"Oh baby."
Ten years of me trying too hard to impress men or people using me or cheating on me left, right and center was really....it was horrible. The best part of all the heartaches was the fact that my best friend was with me to help me pick up the broken pieces of my heart up from the grass.
All of a sudden, Harry moves his face towards Draco's hypnotized face. At this point, Draco and Harry's faces are inches away from each other, with Harry's hand inside of Draco's underwear, clutching the blonde's dick. When Harry finally realizes what happened, Draco breaks the silence.
“Ugh.” Ron says as he rolls his eyes at him. “You really need to get out more and stop sleeping around.”
“And you’re perfect.” Draco responds.
"What is a baby going to do?"
Victoria smiled at him again.
"You're a successful lawyer with money in the bank and you didn't have enough cash on you?" Hermione asks, taken off guard by his statement.
books because he was finding them mind blowing."
Harry thought.
"I think she likes you." Hermione says to Ron.
"That was stupid."
"Ok, Draco." Harry relents with a smile creeping on his face.
"I hate the fact that I never have anyone to come home to at the end of the work day! I hate that I come home to an empty, quiet house everyday. Most of all, I hate how everyone I date just dates me because I'm Harry Potter. No one ever finds me as wonderful or caring, and it's a horrible feeling!" Harry sobs burying his head in Draco's chest.
"Oooh!" He exclaims.
“There's nothing bothering me at all, Ron."
"Are you Chef Bobby Flay or something?"
He covers his length and slowly pushes his length within Harry.
Draco nods and walks back into the dressing room. He stared at his reflection for a few minutes, and yes, he thought that Neville did extremely well. But still, what was the surprise?
“Ron? What brings you here?” Hermione asks as she tries to fix her hair.
"She's so adorable." Lily said. "Hi, cutie."
"Wow!" Harry exclaims, not even shocked.
Make love in public.
"And then he says, "
"Hi, Draco." Harry says, greeting him with a hug.
"So, was this Hermione's idea?" Draco asked when he was freshly showered and dressed for work a few minutes later.
“Stay?”
"I know." Draco says as a patron starts grind on him.
Draco sucks, licks, kisses and runs his nose all over Harry’s length, which drives Harry wild.
"Well I have news for you: None of you run my life." Ron says before heading towards the kitchen.
"Right." Draco says after he remembered that Ron was cheated on as well by Romilda Vane.
"Malfoy." Harry mocked. "It's fine."
Draco sits back on the couch, and sighs.
The blonde kisses up Harry’s torso for a moment before licking it all over.
Draco nodded quickly as Harry pecked his cheek and made his way to the shelf. As Harry made his way to his shelf full of movies, Draco noticed Harry's dog Rex in it's bed chewing on a toy once he got downstairs. He smiled before he sat down on the couch.
Draco smiles as he thrusts into Harry.
"Are we on the right street?" Draco asked as he looked at the big houses, causing Harry to laugh.
after I left, then almost watched some hot guys on YouTube, but then watched that show
Harry laughed before he set the bags on the ground next to him.
, if that were even possible, considering he hasn't relaxed since.
"I'm sorry about ruining our-"
"Whatever you say, Ron." Harry says. "Draco, do you want to go to the kitchen with me?"
"Obviously, you blonde ferret." Harry answered. "Anyway, when it gets warmer, we can have swim races."
"So I'm gonna get a well done steak with steamed vegetables and rice. What are you going to get?" Harry asked.
Draco giggles.
“There.” Harry says as Draco hits his prostate once more.
"Of course we will since we have Hermione." Ron said.
"I haven't left yet." Harry says, baiting him. Now, he was hoping that Draco would notice the soft and inviting tone, subconsciously begging Draco to take the bait and be his happily ever after. This was the last very last opportunity that he was giving Draco, and he hoped that he would catch on to it.
"Stop what?"
"Draco?"
"Because I don’t want to talk about any of that."
"Thank you." Draco said as he smiled unsurely. "I don't think I'm good at it though. I mean, I want to give her the world, but I know that's impossible since there are limits, you know?"
"You've done this before, huh?" Draco responds with a smile on his face.
"I- I didn't know where Victoria was and I got scared."
"Thanks." Seamus says as he proceeds to down the glass in less than 30 seconds.
Draco can only smile as he pulls out his softening dick and cuddling Harry in his arms. He kisses Harry's head.
“Oh boy.” Draco says thinking about the conversation he had yesterday. This was going to be a long night. A long night and a longer conversation.
"Um, pretty much, but I digress. Anyway, I didn't feel like wearing anything fancy at all, so I just wore some jeans and a polo shirt. When I got to his house he said that he liked the whole
"Straight to voicemail." Draco says, dropping his phone into his lap in frustration.
"I'm done." Harry said to himself. "I am totally finished with this."
"No." Draco said as he took another bit from his waffle. "He never did anything."
"Yup. It's like a kid trying to steal a cookie. You want it, but you can't have it just yet."
my husband!” Draco says as he pulls his phone out of the locker as their shift is over.
Harry’s mouth is on Draco’s cock again and Draco starts to moan.
Busy later?
"Awesome, you good looking specimen." Draco remarks as he is making his way into Flames house. Once they pass the threshold of the front door, Flames closes the door and immediately starts kissing Draco. He even takes off Draco's button down, short sleeved shirt in the process.
"Indeed I did. She also gave me a good cup of coffee." Draco answered.
"While I think that it would be cute, she won't be able to trick or treat at all."
“I’m gonna-”
." Harry joked on the other side of the phone.
As Draco was about to answer Ron, Harry picks up after the third ring.
"Yeah. So....?"
"It is."
Hermione thought as she looked at Draco’s demeanor.
"Looks like it's just you and I tonight." Ron says to his right hand.
Tori smiled at him.
“Nice abs.” Harry says after a while.
"I want to hold her first." Justin says.
"I was a four year old kid." He says as he went to retrieve the baby bag from the chair by the door. Harry laid on the bed near Toriand he held her hand.
"Harry then told us
Draco blushes and Sirius laughs.
, but it’s something that I’ve come to grips with. Yes, it’s hard to forgive, but it is human nature. Letting go of anger and bitterness can work wonders for both your attitude and your health, not to mention your relationships. It's hard to forgive, but I have learned that no one can help you with your own personal resentment but yourself. It doesn't help to hold on to things that make you miserable at all. Learning how to let it go may not always be the best feeling in the world, but you know, it's better to be in a better place where you are thriving.
overlook something so obvious for
After a while, Draco begs Harry to fuck him even harder. As Harry picks up the pace, Draco manages to slightly turn around and give Harry a filthy kiss. Harry manages to surprise himself as he flips Draco onto his back.
"Harry, this is really hard! I've never been an hour away from Tori!"
"Let's just say that you did harbor some feelings for Harry, and you had to describe how you feel about him, what would you say?" Neville asks him.
"In the kitchen feeding Tori."
"I'm glad you like it." Inferno says with a smile.
"Draco, you won't be a gay spinster at all. Why not-"
"I think that she'll still look like me, but more like a toddler than a baby. Then she'll look more like a kid than a toddler, so on and so forth."
“Hey, Harry!” Draco answered panting like crazy. “How’s the date going?”
And this time, Harry frowns.
"Oh, Ronald Billius Weasley." Blaise says, shaking his head before kissing Tori's head.
Seamus sighs.
"I'll take that as a yes." Harry says happily.
"You're asking me for too much, Potter. That's just too much."
"I actually have someone staying with me."
"Ok. I trust you, but if he does something you don't like, I will punch him in the face and call him a foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach, got it?"
"How did you feel about Harry's actions and why he disappeared from earth for a whole night?"
"Here's your wine." A man says as he places a bottle of red wine on the table.
“Well, it’s obvious that you love him, Draco. Go after him! That’s what you’re going to do.” Ms. Figg tells him.
"Stop trying to convince yourself. You're crap at being alone."
Hermione shrugs at Ron, simply smiling. "It's your meal."
"Fine, but you're paying for those extra wings. Actually you're paying for everything, since I'm consoling your skinny, rich ass." She says trying not to laugh at his scowl.
"Lavender." She giggles. "Ron's oldest childhood friend."
"You're lucky that they play good music and have good drinks." Ron states.
"Well I hope you’re going to enjoy your trip to Brazil." He moans as she's getting him hard.
"And how are you going to do that?" Hermione asks.
"Draco, don't beat yourself up, mate." Ron tells him from the kitchen.
Tori looks at the both of them, smiling with her tongue sticking out.
“Yeah.”
He just loves it.
and their theories on what will happen on the next season of
"Well, we'll see about that." Justin says.
“I wasn’t trying to-“
Question: What Do You Think About Draco's Dream Y'all?
Harry and Draco try not to laugh as they look at one another.
"I'll see you tomorrow, Potter." He says while placing a kiss on Harry's forehead.
"I am shorter than you, Malfoy!"
"Thanks. See you later." He smiles at Ron.
Draco called his parents, and let them know what he was out with Harry, Ron and his new friend Hermione, and that they wouldn't need to wait up, even though they live a few houses away from each other
"Alright."
"I said I was sorry!"
"Nothing at all. I just like hooking up, with hot guys and it's really the most fun I've ever had in my lifetime. I've got an idea!"
That same night, a slightly tired Draco shows up at Harry’s apartment ready to shower and go out with his best friend.
"Hey, baby girl." Harry said as he rubbed her stomach.
"That’s that." Harry says, putting the last of his suitcases by the door.
“Just ask the damn favor.” Ron says noticing Draco’s pleading look on his face as they are at their lockers grabbing their belongings.
"Nothing crazy though, right?" Neville asks.
"My mum and Lavender's mum used to go to school together." Ron answers. "Which led to me and Lavender growing up together. Her dad passed away when we were only four years old. Anyway, we went to college together where we met Dean who was studying to be a business owner. They got married right out of college –even though she keeps on misplacing her ring, he built this place, and the rest is history."
"I think she knows that you cussed." He giggled.
"I see what you're doing. You're trying to change the subject."
“I love you too, sweetheart. Take care.” She says before ending the call.
Harry can only moan as he continues to ride Draco.
The sounds being made are a mixture of slurping from Harry's mouth, as well as some hums and moans, with Draco's whimpers and hisses. Draco gasps aloud and raises his hips to arch his back when Harry slides a finger in with his tongue. Draco clenches around it instinctively, never releasing the grip it has with his subconscious in full control. Harry manages to lick around it and slide his tongue out, then works on forcing his finger in and out of Draco's wet, pink hole, fucking him open by crooking his finger and digging it around in Draco's entrance.
"Letting people in?"
Hermione does a fox-whistle.
"You're a great father."
Well, they met in medical school and they were always in the same classes for their entire school career. The first couple of weeks, both men never really interacted with one another until the halfway point of their first semester of med school. From that point on, they went to movies, binge watched many TV shows, went to concerts, you name it. They have nearly been inseparable since Their medical school days. Their favorite pastime overall, had been watching
Draco is in shock.
"Are you sure?"
"Later, Blaise. And thank you."
"Yup." And Harry pounced on Inferno and kissed him.
"Got what?" Neville asked.
They even look at each other as Draco is sucking him which Harry is in awe of at this moment.
"Wha- where are you going?"
while drinking lots of wine and eating cheesecake.
"That's is not right." Draco said as he continued to eat his sandwich.
“Seriously, take off the rest of your clothes, Potter.” Draco says.
Draco smiled.
Draco chuckles.
"That's great, Harry." Draco says forcing a smile on his face. "I'm happy that you're putting yourself out there again. But next time, please don't do anything that stupid again.” Draco tells him, while gently cupping Harry’s cheeks with his hands. “You never know what kind of freaks are out at night, especially since you're
Draco is currently in Harry's house eating chocolate covered strawberries with his best friend.
"Don't damage her hearing, Weasley!" Draco told him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh!" Draco says. This is going to be a long discussion. "This is going to take forever."
Harry was about to suck Draco when-
"I'm so sorry, Draco." Luna tells him.
Back at his house, Harry is gathering the last of his belongings.
Suddenly a woman appears next to him.
"And this little one is Tori." Harry says as he smiles at Tori who's staring at all of them.
“Harry! I’m fine sweetheart. How are you today my little boy?”
He knocks.
"I don't know. I thought that I would be pissed off at myself for deleting Grindr, but I'll have to call you back to tell you how it's going because I’m definitely going to hookup with this one again."
"Well then, if that's the case, then tell him how you feel about it. If you really do care for someone, let them know how you feel about their decisions." Sirius suggests
Harry thinks to himself.
Draco takes a relaxing breath.
"No, Draco. You literally just missed him. Harry just left about a minute ago." Hermione says shaking her head.
Now, Draco knows that he and Harry are two different individuals to be in a relationship together. Was Harry making the right decision in leaving? Was leaving him and everything that he knew here the best option for the both of them? Was it truly his job as his best friend to support this decision in letting Harry go?
"Thank you. Let's take it real slow, just until I ease up."
is a mix of Sloe Gin, Southern Comfort and Galliano, all over some ice.”
"Is it that obvious?" Harry dead panned.
"Now, if you get some tonight, you should thank Hermione." Justin says as he's eating ice cream.
Victoria smiles at him and in that moment, Harry's heart swells in a way that he's never felt before. He instantly has this urge to protect her at all times.
Kiss you.
Hermione’s eyes bulge because Ron wasn’t kidding.
They both sat together on the couch, simply watching TV when Harry finished eating and played with Victoria with Draco's permission. He was lucky to have a pull-out couch, so he pulled it out just should in case Draco and Victoria fell asleep. Harry got on his knees and made funny faces at Victoria, who stared at at him and cooed loudly.
"I don't care what his name is, Draco. God! Why are you even my best friend? What's the point of being here, at this bar? You-" Harry shouts, while every patron at the bar looks at Harry.
"It's delicious!" Draco exclaimed as he moaned through another bit of pasta. "How often do you cook?"
"What makes you think I can't pay attention to four movies in a row, in the course of one night?" Harry asks playfully.
"What is it, love?" Lily asked.
"Pretty please?" She asks him, pulling off Draco's signature puppy dog look.
“Thanks.” Justin says getting out of his seat rushing away from the table.
"Anyway, we met there and he just... won me over with his flirty remarks even when I knew that he was a bad idea. I remember introducing him to my parents and they instantly disliked him."
"No. That was actually good, but I can't-"
"Do you know how to swim now?"
"I've noticed." Draco says as he smiles at Neville.
He lies her on her stomach carefully, making sure that she's secure.
His tone rubs Harry the wrong way.
After she places the order, she joins Harry on the couch, who is currently taking money out of his wallet for the pizza and wings. She notices that he looks pissed, but she doesn't ask him why.
“Damn, baby! Shit!” Draco says, unaware that Harry is undoing his jeans, pushing them down to the ground. Before Draco can catch his breath, Harry’s on his knees. All of a sudden, Harry's mouth is being filled with Draco’s dick. He starts fucking Harry’s face. “Take off your shirt.” He demands, while he takes off shirt while he continues to face fuck Harry. Harry slowly takes his shirt off , and places his right hand on Draco’s dick, stroking it, leading his hand and his mouth in a synchronized rhythm.
"I'm so sorry about that!" An embarrassed Harry states.
All I know is, he's the one I was willing to give my life to because he was the only one to make me feel things that I never felt with anyone before.
Seamus didn't answer.
Draco nods a bit after thinking about it for a minute or two.
"Am I really not a good reason to stay?" He asks Harry as his tears continue to fall.
"Two." She repeats. "One whole box for you to eat tonight and a box for me that I'll start eating tonight and finish eating tomorrow.
Draco laughs.
“Draco.” Harry whines as Draco’s tongue hits his prostate.
"She's washing Tori's little clothes after Tori threw up on them." Neville said.
Harry gives each of the blonde’s balls equal attention before placing the length in his mouth.
"I have my ways." Neville said.
"Yeah," Sirius says. "And as long as you support Harry and his happiness, then that's all that matters. Are you truly happy for Harry, Draco?"
Draco looks at his friend.
Harry smiles once he stares at her.
"Hi. My name is Luna. What would you like to drink?"
"People must take advantage of you, don't they?"
Draco started rocking Tori a little, which calmed her down a bit.
"Well, whatever makes you happy, Harry." Draco says dejectedly with his voice cracking. "I hope you get everything you wish for." And with that, Draco turns to leave the house trying to regain his composure.
“Well, Ms. Figg, I can honestly say that I’m doing the best with what I’ve got.”
"Well, congrats on finding your dream girl." Draco genuinely compliments.
Harry nods and looks at the watch on his left wrist.
Draco looked back at his daughter and smoothed out her brown hair. He smiled at her black eyes, brushing his nose against hers. He was glad that she mostly looked like him. The only thing that she had that weren't his were the color of his hair and eyes. Those belonged to her other father. The moment Draco saw Victoria's eyes when she opened them, he instantly fell in love with her.
"Really. It's one of your most endearing qualities that I've never seen in anyone, other than my dad and Sirius. It's something that I tried doing, but it's not something that I can achieve well, but to see you do it is truly beautiful."
"B-but what?"
“HARRY JAMES POTTER!” She says, scandalized.
"We'll see you soon." Neville says.
"Mph, mph, mph. I can't believe that you actually have a sympathetic side, Draco." Ron says as he and Draco sit at a table at the hospital cafeteria before taking a bite of his salad.
“I did that!” Draco says proudly as he thrusts into Harry.
"Double date tomorrow, Har-Bear?"
"So, Draco, Ron here says that you are the biggest
Harry takes Draco’s hand that is running all over his torso and binds their fingers together as he is sucking on Draco’s length.
“No buts, Malfoy! I know what kind of person Harry is, alright? I know that he’s hurt and that no amount of apologies can fix this, but you have got to do something. Man up and admit that you miss him. Make it right!”
Harry looks at Draco, still confused.
.’ Sirius thinks to himself. "Oh Draco, jealousy isn’t a good look on you. And so is anything orange."
"Yes! Those are my bitches!" Harry squeals.
"Sure. Death by wine, here we come. I'll swing by and be there in about 10 minutes." Draco tells him with a huge smile on his face.
"Complimenting me all the time, Potter. You're gonna turn me into a strawberry."
“Off.” Harry moaned. “I need your pants off.”
He burps.
"How do you want this?" Draco asks him after five minutes of vigorous kissing.
Hermione drags him by the arm.
Lover.
"Draco, what are you trying to say? You’re hesitating about something." Harry notices. “Is everything alright?” And he hears Draco sigh.
"I love you more, Malfoy." Harry responds.
Considering the given situation, Draco shouldn’t be happy that Harry and Inferno (or Flames) are now broken up, but deep down he’s happy to spend time with Harry again, all to himself.
"You- you're leaving in three days and this is how you decide to tell me? You'd actually leave and not tell me anything at all? Am I that.....unimportant to you? Just...why?" He asks Harry as his eyes are filling up with tears. He literally doesn't know what to make of this at all. At this moment, he is beyond pissed because he knew that Harry was mad at him. But the fact that Harry was going to move away from him? It felt surreal.
"Do you have place to stay?"
"Positive. Besides, Luna and I bought Tori some dresses the other day. We love spoiling babies."
"Draco." Ron says trying to get his attention. "Draco?" He tries again, but he ignores Ron and he takes a long sip of whiskey from the bottle. "What's wrong?" Ron asks him taking the bottle from his hand.
Draco sighs again.
"Well, I had a good martini just a while ago and now I’m having a Manhattan, so things are good."
"So you think I'm hot?" Draco asked.
“So last night after we went our separate ways, Draco asked me what I thought about our double date. I told him that I couldn't believe that it took so long to hang out with Ron after so long.”
