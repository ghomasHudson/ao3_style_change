"Mum!" Harry gasped. No words needed to be spoken to show how loved Harry felt in that moment, standing with the family he was always meant to have.
"Harry, are you in here?" A voice called from outside the door. Hermione. Harry went to grab his wand but then realised it was in the other room. He couldn't let her see him like this. "Please," Harry said to Draco. "Please, wand!" Harry croaked. Hesitantly, Draco passed Harry his wand. He quickly cast a glamour over himself, turned the tap on and was pretending to wash his hands when Hermione Came In.
"Uh, sort of. It's a boy-girl thing so I had to ask a girl with people watching. I have a plan though. What do you say?" He said, hopefully. "Okay then Potter, fill me in with the details later when we're alone." His last words made Harry madly blush. "And tell your bushy haired friend to learn how to contain her excitement." Draco smirked, picking up his book.
"So, the more Harry gets better, the more red his heart will get?" Draco asked and Hermione nodded. She then up and left claiming she needed sleep and the boys should too, after all they had class the next day and they needed rest.
"That's the first time we've don't that where we haven't been walked in on!" Harry laughed. "I wouldn't be so sure about that." A voice came from behind a tree, making the two boys jump. Professor Barton stepped out, holding the video camera Draco had been using, which was pointed straight at them.
Harry and Draco met by the fountain, which had been restored to its original state of a witch, wizard, house elf, goblin and centaur. The boys had to resist the temptation to just grab each other for a kiss, or even just a hug!
He smiled as he wandered out the eighth year tower and heading towards the seventh floor. The door was still there after whoever last went in, and Harry gripped his wand tightly and let out a shaky breath. He pushed the door open and was greeted by darkness. "H- hello?" Harry called.
WARNING: Bad language, Abuse, Eating Disorders, Depression, Suicide Attempt, Homophobia (Things get better).
But that was a lie. His heart still spread up when Draco walked into the room. His heart still skipped a beat when he thought about them kissing and had to resist the urge of just jumping onto the blonde.
Hermione and Ginny came into dorm number seven to see if the boys were okay and saw them asleep together on one bed. "Draco?" Ginny whispered, looking at the two. Hermione nodded and levitated Harry onto his own bed in case somebody came in and saw the two.
Harry didn't mean to, but he let a tear slip down his cheek, and quickly wiped it away. Draco, being the taller boy, kissed Harry on the top of his head and they fell asleep.
Harry smelled the potion, and immediately smelt hair product, strong cologne and green apples. Draco, he thought. "Well?" Slughorn pried.
And what did he do best? Pretend that nothing bad had ever happened and carry on with life. And carry on with life he would, even though he was already dead on the inside.
"I'm glad we were put in the same dorm, Potter," Draco said, twiddling with Harry's hair when they collapsed side by side on the bed. They had changed back to their normal selves, remembering their looks for Saturday night. "I will do everything I can to help you get better and nothing, not even Azkaban can make me rest until you're okay."
"Wow, that's so weird!" Dean gasped, downing half his bottle of firewhiskey in a few gulps. "I have a boyfriend and his name is Seamus!" Seamus giggled at his boyfriend and booped Dean on the nose. "Let's carry on with the game," Hermione smiled, finally moving onto her second drink.
Harry attempted to cover himself up, but his arms were only knocked away by Draco who was still dabbing him with the wet sponge. Harry sat up, his head spinning but still leaning against Draco.
"Harry?" A voice whispered. But, as much as he tried, Harry couldn't move an inch and fell helplessly into slumber again. "I thought you woke up. It's just my imagination. You probably can't hear me Harry, but I have no idea what I'm feeling right now." the voice said again. Harry listened in silence to more voices arriving, although he couldn't picture anyone's face but one.

Harry looked back and saw Hermione practically not even on her seat anymore. Harry got up and started walking over to her with a sad face. "Oh Harry, I'm sorry!" She frowned, reading his face. "I'm not," Harry smirked. "What? But, you... he-"
"When you ran off and I couldn't find you I was so scared. I was really worried that Lucius found you," Draco sat up and looked at Harry bleary eyed. "Why would you be worried?" He asked. "Why do you insist on helping me?" Harry acknowledged.
"I want to get to know you better, Draco. I feel I don't know too much about you," He shrugged. "Okay, ask me anything!" Draco smiled. Harry thought for a moment then asked "What's your middle name? Favourite spell? When's your birthday? Favourite subject? Are you a virgin? What's your patronus? Are you-"
"I, too, don't think that Mr Harry Potter should go to Azkaban!" A squeaky voiced woman with long blonde hair and a mousy face cried. "Send him a mind healer!" One by one, most of Fudge's employees were stood, rebelling against his desicion. Harry grinned smugly up at the minister as he felt his heart rate start to increase.
"Well, they were in boy-girl form." Ginny said abruptly, walked over with her arms crossed and a stern look on her face that made her look slightly like Molly Weasley. "Ginny! George said he misses you loads, he told me to tell you-" but Ron was interrupted with a smack across his face.
McGonagall was confused by Harry's physical state. "I just don't understand, he's looked perfectly fine since he arrived at Hogwarts last month! Now he looks beaten, and thin as a stick. Oh, my poor boy!" She sniffed, fiddling with the necklace around her neck.
What they didn't know, was that there were two figures currently creeping into the hospital wing.
"You need to come out to the ministry," she gasped, filled with excitement. "But Hermione, I'm not.." He started. "Oh, please Harry, it's very obvious, to me anyway. Plus, I may or may not have just been spying on you and Malfoy. You left the door open." She smiled mischievously and carried on speaking before Harry could interrupt.
They burst out laughing, which made the eighth years who were lounging in the common room turn in their direction. Their eyes lingered for a moment on the unknown couple who were still holding hands, but then turned back. "Merlin, guys! I was freaking out, I thought I'd lost my memory or something!" Ron groaned, but a small smile was playing on his lips.
There was still a faint glamour on Harry's arms, as Draco saw once again some blood drip from Harry's head onto his forearm and it disappeared. Draco got out his wand and almost collapsed right then and there on the spot.
"I'm sorry, Mr Potter, you are going to have to make your way to second lesson if you want to pass your newts. You've already missed enough for the while you were in the hospital and with the Christmas holidays coming up, you can't afford to miss more." Harry smiled and picked up his bag.
Harry, Ron and Hermione walked down to breakfast together the next morning, to find that an extra, shorter table had been added to the hall. "It's for the 8th years," Hermione said, walking forwards. "And how do you know that?" Ron asked. "There was a sign on the door, Ronald. If you had taken your eyes off of the food, then maybe you would've noticed."
He threw open the door and ran to the railing. Harry could still hear the shouting but couldn't hear any specific voices or what they were saying. Lost in his own mind, Harry threw one leg over the black polished railing and then the other, now only holding on with his hands.
Harry looked over at Draco who was sitting two seats down from Ron, and saw that Malfoy had been staring right back at him too. They both quickly looked away, blushing, only to take one final glance at each other again. Then, Harry got an idea.
"It's beautiful," Harry said breathlessly. "This is all I ever wanted. To talk with you, to sing with you. I love you guys." Wait. Was Harry cheating? Draco burst through the door and saw Harry sitting on his bed with two ghosts either side of him.
The air exploded. "No- no- no!" Someone was shouting "No! Fred! no!" And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred's eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.
"Oh, uh, I smell broom polish and um, fresh quidditch fields." He lied. "Of course! Such an avid young flier, no doubt that it could make you a career in the future." He smiled.
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco's wand on the floor and the boy himself looking... Relieved? "What just happened?" Harry asked.
"Do what?" Hermione blushed. "Bite your lip and run your hands through your hair like that- you truly are a beautiful girl, Hermione." Ron smiled, ticking a loose strand of her hair behind her ear. "Oh!" She giggled. "Thank you."
He had gone to Diagon Alley, sent his letter to McGonagoll and bought his necessary books for the later year. He hadn't gotten any owls from anyone at all during the time they have had off. Harry wasn't surprised either, everyone probably hated him after the war. So many people were lost because of him. His mum, dad, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Fred, Snape, Hedwig, Dobby, Dumbledore. So many people, all gone because of him.
"Who are you? Slughorn asked as Harry was walking back into the party. "You don't go to this school?" Harry put on his best fake American accent and replied "No, sir. My name is Jacob Evans and I go to Illvermorny. Harry Potter invited me here for the party. He told me you throw only the best ones in England! I'm a distant relative of his."
Harry gulped at the mention of the sectumsempra curse, but carried on listening to the argument none the less.
"I just saw two boys kiss earlier. They ran away as soon as I saw them. I was confused, that's all. Is it allowed? Being gay, that is?" He asked, curious to find out more. "In the wizarding world, not really. Nobody really knows why as such, the rule has just always been there. I think it's because the ministry think its an act of rejecting to make more witches and wizards, because you can't exactly, you know." Malfoy answered.
"None of us have a choice when it comes to our scars you know." Harry pointed out, lifting his hair up and out the way, revealing the lightning bolt on his forehead. Draco nodded fervently. He lay down and put his head on Harry's lap. Harry closed his eyes and began running his hands through Draco's hair again.
Hermione was sat patiently in the common room, but when she saw him, she looked as though she might just explode. "What is it Hermione?" Harry asked, slumping down on an armchair. "You can cast wandless spells! Why didn't you tell me?" She gasped. "What do you mean?" Harry said. "Your patronus! The stag! I picked up your wand after charms because I had to go back and ask Professor Flitwick about some extra homework and I saw your wand and picked it up! I was so surprised by Sirius coming back I forgot to give it to you, and when the Dementors were there is was about to pass it to you when your stag came anyway-"
He was so thin, he looked like a living corpse. Harry scrunched up his face in disgust, whilst counting every one of his ribs. Cuts and bruises littered Harry's arms, legs and torso. The only thing Harry liked about himself now,  was his hair. It had grown out a bit and gone curly on the top.

Ron looked up, eyes widening in surprise. In love? His best friend, in love? And he wasn't there to support him? "For fucks sake!" Ron groaned, banging his head lightly on the table. "And what about Ginny, huh? They were meant to be together and Harry just screwed her over! She's meant to be your sister too, you know!"
"Come in Harry, everyone wants to see you. None of this is your fault, nobody blames you for anything." And she walked back inside. Harry knew otherwise. Everything was his fault. If he had never been the stupid 'chosen one' then none of this would have happened.
Draco came back from Hogsmeade late in the afternoon, slightly worried about Harry. He had been alone all day and the past weeks hadn't been good for him or his health. He was about to open the door to room number seven, when he heard voices.
The music started playing again and people went back to dancing. Harry leant his forehead against Draco's and closed his eyes. "I'm happy. Here, right now, in this room, you make me feel special like nobody has before," Harry smiled and looked into Draco's eyes. Draco pushed his lips onto Harry's and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck once again.
Sirius was looking at him worriedly as he opened his eyes. "Thank you." Harry muttered, embarrassed that his Godfather had to witness one of his panic attacks. "What happened?" Sirius asked soothingly. "I- I was just thinking about the parents I never had. Another life, where I wasn't famous and I grew up with my parents just as a normal boy should have. Maybe another Potter could've had what I didn't if Mum and Dad just handed me over."
"Put it this way. What would you do if I turned out to be gay? We've been best friends for eight years, Ron. Surely, you wouldn't just stop being friends with me because I love guys. Hypothetically, of course." Harry asked. Ron looked at him blankly, as if not even thinking about the question he had just asked. Then, he finally spoke up.
Hermione put a protective shield around the two men as students started yelling stunning spells, thinking Harry was being attacked. McGonogall ran in hurriedly and yelled "STOP!" The spells stopped immediately.
Students were all rushing out of the castle to see what was going on, teachers following behind them. Some had the Prophet clutched in the hands, whispering to others what the news was and Harry watched as looks of disgust spread across their faces. Even a few of the teachers looked as if a rather potent smell had touched their noses.
Draco stood at the sink next to Harry, drenching his hair with water, then blow drying and styling it. Harry stared at Draco, his childhood enemy since his first day at Hogwarts and was suddenly jealous of him. Draco's part in the war was just as bad as Harry's was. He was forced to become a death eater, death threats every day, yet he managed to keep control of himself and not ruin his body like Harry had. "Take a picture, it'll last longer," Draco smirked. "Sorry. Draco?" Harry asked. Draco looked at Harry, eyebrow raised.
Ginny got into her costume as Dracula's wife and Ron and Hermione went as Mummies, Hermione looking extremely odd as her bushy hair poked threw the bandages, making her head look very lumpy and hairy. Harry just threw on a cape and some fake fangs, but wore a suit underneath which he and Draco had agreed on wearing.
Harry finished clearing up and headed upstairs, exhausted. But, when he got there, he found Uncle Vernon sitting on his bed, looking like a beetroot. "I told you boy, to never ruin a meal again, and look what you did. I'm going to get you for this." Knowing what was coming, Harry braced himself, and sure enough. A full blow came to Harry's stomach. He was knocked to the ground and felt the full wrath of Vernon Dursley.
The water was hot and beautiful against his skin as he lathered shampoo into his hair and massaged his scalp to rid all the salty sea-air from his body. He sighed softly as he scrubbed at his skin and massaged his aching muscles with some Radox. If his father could see him now -he would die of sheer shock! The thought made Draco smile and then exhale a strangled choke in less that two seconds. He shouldn't think about 'death' or 'dying'. If he did he would start to think the worst and he could not do that.
Tartan suddenly obscured his view of the sky and he dropped his arms and his gaze to see Harry stretching his arms high over both of their heads. He couldn't help but chuckle at the sight of Harry completely soaked through, his satchel slung around his wrist and his hair plastered down to his face. "We need to get you inside before you catch another fever!" Harry shouted over the roar of the rain that hammered down all around them, the tartan blanket providing barely any shelter as the torrent grew heavier and heavier. Draco didn't complain as Harry grabbed at his elbow and steered them towards one of the many back doors that led into the manor. As they stumbled in through to the marbled floor they almost slipped over as rain water dripped off them and puddled around the door. Draco bit back another bought of laughter as Harry draped the tartan blanket down and tried to soak up some of the rain water with the ringing wet blanket.
The clicking of nails against the wooden floorboards alerted him to Seeker's proximity. He bent down against to ruffle the dogs' flanks before straightening up to pour the chicken soup into a deep bowl. He set about placing the bowl of soup and a glass of water onto a tray so that Harry did not have to move from the sofa.
"It wouldn't be the first time I've nearly killed him," Harry rasped as he curled even tighter into himself, his knees drawn to his chest, his bare feet damp and cold.
Severus leaned back in his chair and frowned, "How long has this been going on?" he asked in a controlled voice his eyes unwavering from the younger man.
Looking around the apartment from the front doorway, he could honestly say that nothing had changed since the day they had received the news. Nothing would change, really, he knew that now. He sighed shakily, his breathing coming out wet and hissing from his lips. A small tremor ruined his still posture as he went through the motions of digging his keys out of his front jacket pocket. It hadn't been too cold today, that's why he had worn the small black leather jacket instead of his high-necked coat he was used to. He gnawed on his bottom lip, his fingers feeling numb as they worked the zip down the front of his jacket. His wind-bitten cheeks were cold to the touch but he had to admit, he had barely felt the wind as it scraped against his skin on the walk home.
"See, I knew you'd take that wrong," Draco laughed bitterly and sighed, "No I want to be your friend because you're the only person who saw me when I was invisible. And by the sounds of things," he said slowly, "Having another friend to hang around with might not be such a bad thing for you, since Granger and Weasley are dating now. And it will get his sister away from you for the most part."
"You are delirious," Harry affirmed, finally finding his voice, "Let me go back to my bedchamber and get some more of my potions for you."
"I did
He looked down to see their golden retriever padding up to him, and nudging his knee with the side of its head, the big watery brown eyes looking up at him in a silent question of why he was returning home alone yet again, and why wasn't their other master with him? He didn't know what to tell him; there were no more words left to say on the matter. He was sure that he had said them all. Doe-like eyes became downcast and the tail stopped wagging expectantly. The padding noise echoed as their dog walked gloomily over to the dog-bed beside him favourite armchair. His armchair; the one he had gone out of his way in search of and had not gotten it –because his boyfriend had gotten to it first. For him. As a present.
To HIM!
Draco snickered lightly and drained the last of his own flute and shook his head, his blonde hair not moving a fraction. "No, I find that I have been spending a lot of my current time being on the receiving end of the healers hands instead of getting to help anybody unfortunately."
Draco glared mockingly. They were as stubborn as each other. Grabbing the front of Harry's shirt, he seethed; "Fuck me into the mattress, Wonder boy!" before crushing their mouths in a rough kiss.
The bath had been heavenly and he hadn't felt cleaner than he did in that moment. As soon as he settled down behind his warded curtains in the dorms, he took out the oil and hesitated a while before dabbing a spot behind each ear and placing the corked bottle under his pillow.
"Draco you're scaring me?" came Harry's shaking voice to Draco's ears, though it was more of an echo.
"You can't possibly know that, Draco, but I am grateful for your support. I wouldn't be able to do any of this without you," Harry sighed and leaned his head back on the tree trunk.
"You'd spend eternity here just to make me suffer?"
"Y-Yes," Harry strained out.
"Surely that just means that you're madder than I am?" the brunette man asked with a cocked eyebrow.
It all started on a sunny afternoon a couple of days before the First Trial of the TriWizard tournament. Thanks to a rather perfectly timed lovers-spat between Potter and the Weasel, Draco decided that now was the perfect time to put his plan into action. Dismissing himself from Blaise and Pansy's company he drifted down the stone staircase they'd been lounging on and followed Potter out onto the grounds several meters behind him. He felt smug already as he turned into a courtyard and found Potter sitting on a bench, reading a book so intensely he was sure the pages would combust under his gaze.
He'd need to brew a new batch of calming draught for himself but Harry ... Well, it would seem as though he wasn't the only one that needed to be reminded of Christmas.
It was a long shot, either way, but even she had missed Draco's grumbling about the Potter boy. It was only a matter of time before his moping got on her nerves and she didn't want any friction to grow between them. War or not, they were all friends first and foremost. She only wanted to see him happy, if only for a week or two.
Once at Blackpool Tower they noticed that there was a special offer for all of the tourist attractions -and it would only cost them £35 each! It was a bargain.
"Perhaps," he conceded with a graceful smile, "But at the very least that means that the both of us can live out the rest of our lives together, being mad as one another?"
"I'm going to slide inside you, alright?" Harry panted as he slowly stroked his own cock with firm fingers and continuing to coax Draco's entrance to relax a little looked up as Draco bit down on his bottom lip, his eyes averted and shining with unshed tears. He felt his heart convulse, "Am I –hurting you?" he asked softly, stopping his administrations to run a soothing hand up the blonde's stomach. He watched as the older man trembled beneath him and brought a quaking hand to cover the hushed sobs creaking out of his mouth. "Draco?" he breathed, not wanting to draw attention to the pain in his heart and no doubt the pain Draco was in at that moment. "Come on, Draco, what's wrong? Let me help you."
Potter wasn't faring too well either.
In the corner of the room there now stood a green fir tree that was adorned with silver and pale gold ornaments, twinkling with small fairy lights complete with a glittering star on the top of it. It was beautiful and cheerful and bright in the room, yet subtle in the soft hues around them. Harry took another sip of his butterbeer before sighing contently, "Happy first Christmas Draco."
It was a shock to them all that afternoon and Horace had eventually laughed good-naturedly to try and dispel the tension. It had worked for a short moment and then when everyone had settled down Severus and Horace were quickly engaged in a conversation with Lucius about some form of politics or other, and Narcissa naturally chimed in whenever her husband's statement needed supporting. She knew a lot more than she let on, but above all things she knew her place.
Harry nodded to indicate that he knew it only too well. Seeing that he had hit a brick wall, Severus stood up from the chair and waved his wand to light the two candles on Harry's bedside table. He looked down at the gaunt young man in the bed and felt his own heart clench. Just as he was turning away to leave the room and go down to dinner with Narcissa and Lucius, Harry reached out and snatched at his fingers. He turned around and arched an eyebrow down at the beaten down young man. With broken green eyes Harry looked up at him and with quaking muscles and rasped out, "Make sure that Draco's okay," he pleaded with his eyes and as well as his words, "Please, Severus. Make sure he's going to be okay. And tell him I … Tell him that I lo –" Why couldn't he say the words? He wanted the words out of his mouth but they wouldn't tumble out! He swallowed thickly and dropped his gaze and his hand clinging to Severus.
Finally, he swallowed his anxiety and pushed the door inwards.
"I must have had some Felix Felicis, because I think I'm about to get lucky," Draco smirked as he reached for the front of Harry's shirt and dragged him towards his body before slamming the brunette boy up against the wall. He cupped Potter's -no -
What they planned to do in the afternoon, Draco had no idea. Maybe a walk along the beach with some sunshine. Or explore each of the piers.
His hands fisted the sheets, his knuckles turning white.
Harry spread his legs beneath Draco and massaged his fingers against Draco's scalp, thrusting his cock to move further into his lover's beautifully hot mouth. Draco complied drawing deep, throaty moans from Harry as he received a blow-job that was making his mind spin and swirl into a mass of exotic colours behind his eyelids.
Hermione frowned, "you -you're what?"
The bell rang and he was just about to stealthily make his way out ahead of most of the class when he felt something warm and wet rain down on him from behind. He turned around just to get another cloud of the grey soapy water used for scrubbing out cauldrons crash into him again. He coughed and spewed out the water that had surfed down his throat, and soaked his school shirt and trousers. As he rubbed the water out of his eyes he could hear the laughter bubbling up from everyone who had stopped to watch. He could feel his eyes and nose burn with the threat of tears. He wouldn't cry in front of them.
"Why?"
"A tonic for your headaches. Parkinson gave it to me this morning before she left."
Harry shrugged his shoulders before standing up and pressing the back of his hand to Draco's forehead before frowning. "I came because I felt like you needed someone to look after you and judging by the state of you, no one really has except for that poor maid you screamed at." Draco huffed and didn't bother answering. He listened as Harry shuffled around his room and then went over to the door of his bedchamber and called for a maid. He couldn't make out the younger man's mutterings but he was sure he wasn't going to like it. Once the door was closed again, Harry turned his attention to the blonde man swathed in sweaty, knotted bedclothes. "I've asked the maids to prepare a bath for you and some light supper for the both of us. Proper food, none of this breakfast nonsense they had you living on. That won't do you any good at all. You need regular sustenance and to be able to let the potions I have for you work." Draco blinked in surprise. He hadn't expected any of those things. He felt his mouth hang open uselessly as he watched Harry come over to the side of his bed and reach for the knotted ties of the blonde's nightshirt.
Rubbing his hand down his face he shuffled over into the Great Hall for lunch just as his stomach let out a ferocious growl. He headed over to the Slytherin table and settled down at the end with Pansy, Draco and Theodore Nott. He couldn't deny he was a little relieved to have at least three familiar faces surrounding him. As he piled food onto his plate and poured himself some pumpkin juice, he couldn't deny he was intrigued by the reddish hue of Draco's cheek that looked as though he'd been punched, albeit, with not much force. Cocking an eyebrow, he asked, "What happened to your cheek, Draco?"
,' resounded through his head like a mantra. He watched, fascinated, as Harry ripped the foil packet open with his teeth and slipped the condom out. He grimaced at the oily little disc and how Harry rolled it down his shaft with minimal fumbling.
He didn't know how Harry faired having his own bed to himself for a couple of days. Harry seemed almost reluctant to talk about most things, such a drastic contrast to how he had been even a year ago. Draco couldn't help but think that maybe it was something that he had done unintentionally, that had angered the brunette. He couldn't think of anything that wouldn't have been settled after a small disagreement. He wished he could go and talk to him, despite it being almost one o'clock in the morning. He had too much on his mind and he really just wanted to have Harry's beautiful voice lull his nerves into a sleep state so that he wouldn't feel too stressed. He rung his hands around the end of his cotton sheet –something he'd cherished no matter how small it was, since that month he'd first met the younger man. He sighed and flopped back down on his pillows, glaring up at the canopy of his bed and closed his eyes closed a couple of times, trying to even out his breathing and ignore the throbbing in his chest.
From the mirror, he watched Harry nod his head triumphantly, "Oh yes, you should definitely join me," he let out a small giggle as Draco practically pounced on him, hands on either side of Harry's head trapping him within his cocoon. He rubbed their noses together before kissing him.
He went through the morning routines after Draco slipped out of his bedchamber with a small smile over his shoulder as he went. Harry had simply stared after him blankly, not knowing how to move himself or how to react. He was numb and so tired that he felt like his brain had liquefied and ran out of his ear. He filled his basin with tepid water and stripped down, tossing the nightshirt into the wicker hamper and burying it down with his other dirty shirts and undergarments. He slowly washed his entire body, as though the slow ritual would cleanse his blackness away from his mind and the wounds in his thighs that had started to scab over. He rinsed his face and fingered the black bags that were dragging the skin down beneath his eyes. He shivered as a cool breeze surfed under the balcony door and chilled his damp skin. He skipped breakfast but managed to force himself to eat lunch with Narcissa and Severus whilst Draco and Lucius took a gentle hike along the riverbanks. He wanted to hate the fact that he felt a germ of relief that the blonde man wasn't there, but he couldn't muster the energy to feel anything besides numbness.
"Only almost?"
It wasn't until later in the week one night as he lay in his bed with his heavily warded curtains shut tight around him, that Harry dug out the map from under his pillow and tapped the tip of his wand against the page, "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good," he recited in one breath, his heart beating a little faster. He studied the map for a while until his eyes came to rest on the small dot in the dungeons that was labelled 'DRACO MALFOY'. Like most nights before he'd stopped looking, the dot remained in the dungeons, not moving a millimetre. He was moments away from calling it a night -again -when the dot actually shifted and started to move. He watched it go along a series of corridors and then along the fifth floor, it suddenly disappeared. His heart rated spiked. He knew where Malfoy had gone but he still couldn't believe the blonde had the nerve to go there. He hadn't even braved the desolate room since the fire.
Draco actually sneered up at him, both of their expressions dark and ugly. This wasn't going the way Draco had planned but he had to work with what he was given. "No, actually I'm too tired for any of that," he snipped as he linked and flexed his fingers together between his knees, "I came here to ask you if you would like to come on a boat ride with me?"
He had loathed being torn away from Harry's limp body by two Healer's; they restrained him and stunned him.
As they entered the stuffy classroom and settled down to read Slughorn's words on the backboard as the stout main babbled on. That's when the idea hit Blaise. He was surprised it hadn't occurred to him before. He scribbled out a quick note to Pansy and slid it over the desk to her. She frowned over at him and unfolded the note out of sight from Draco who was looking lost and forlorn once again, his pale skin looking sickly in the gloom of the classroom.
"M'sorry for being such a baby."
Malfoy spun around on his knees, his tear-stained red face contorted into one of anger at being caught in such a vulnerable manner. He gritted his teeth together and drew out his wand and aimed it right at Harry's heart. Harry whipped out his own wand and aimed it right back at Draco, although he forced himself to remember only protection spells. He took a step closer, noticing how much Draco was shaking now and how tired the boy looked. "I'm not here to fight you, Malfoy," he stated in a tight voice. He was trying his best to remain calm but Damnit if Malfoy didn't always make him feel like a little kid.
Draco frowned, "You really should learn to call her Pansy, Harry. Even if it's just to me. I'm trying with your friends, you know."
Blaise and Theo lapsed into silence and returned their attention to their lunch. Blaise hummed and couldn't help but look up when Draco slid back into his seat, looking exceptionally more cheerful compared to when he'd left. For the rest of the lunch break he watched as he blonde's grey eyes kept casting glances over to the Gryffindor table. He just knew at the back of his mind that Potter kept glancing up at their table. He rolled his eyes when he was sure no one was looking. It was so painful watching the blonde growing slowly and surely more infatuated with the four-eyed git. Blaise wasn't homophobic; he couldn't care less one way or another.
After the jerk-off session in the library, they'd started taking risks with actually touching one another. Sometimes it'd be a hand on the wrist, leaning a little too closer to sound off chat-up lines in a way that looked like they were hissing and spitting vile words to one another.
Draco waited for a moment, watching as Harry disappeared into their adjoining bedroom and made short work of stripping out of his soaked clothes and hanging them about the dry around the fireplace before coming back to seat himself in the armchair across from Draco. "I found your letters this afternoon whilst I was clearing out fathers study. All the documents had been put in there. I'd almost forgotten about them completely until I found them today."
He felt relief mingled with fear knot around in his stomach. There was no turning back.
Good, he thought nastily, let her give-up. No one asked her to come here.
He was almost grateful to skulk down to the dungeons after dessert -not that he ate any -and seclude himself within the thick green curtains hanging around his bed. He curled up in his pyjamas and cast warming charms on the blankets and pillows, his feet already turning paler with the cold, and cast silencing charms on the curtains. As he curled up on his side and burrowed under the blankets, his eyes wide open he couldn't disregard the chill and hushed whispers that greeted him when his dorm-mates entered for bed a few hours later. He didn't listen to them and he was grateful for the silencing charms he'd put up. At least none of them would get disturbed from his nightmares.
"I love you so much, Draco," Harry breathed leaning ever closer so that only Draco could hear him.
Harry nodded indicating the slid leather satchel in his hand, "Of course sir, as per your instruction."
Harry nodded vigorously. "Please -I need to feel you!"
Harry dropped down to his knees and grasped Draco's face between his hands and pressed their mouths together in passionate, salty damp kisses before he broke away and gave a watery laugh, "Merlin, I've gotten you all wet." He wiped at Draco's cheeks with his sleeve and only stopped when the blonde man grasped his wrist and pulled it away.
They seemed awfully well mannered and although a lot of thought had clearly been put into writing them, Draco could see where Harry's grip on reality began to slip again. It wasn't until the last letter in that bundle, did cracks began to appear in the writing and the manic ramblings began to come to light. Draco blanched as he read the words, his stomach gripping in dread at Harry's chaotic thoughts.
He watched as Harry's angry body tensed slightly, the hushed whispering of ragged breaths being drawn in an attempt to quell his frustration. "Yes, Draco?" came the strained voice after a few silent moments.
He hadn't meant to take things so fast that summer, but on one of the nights when they had taken an early evening picnic in the gardens underneath the cherry blossom tree as they had the previous year, he couldn't have helped how romantic the sunset shining in Draco's eyes had made him feel. That night he had thrown all caution to the wind and had leaned over to press his lips gently against Draco's. Mentally, he had been bracing himself for an almighty slap to strike his cheek, but it hadn't come. Instead, he had felt the feather light pressure of Draco's soft full lips responding underneath his own. The tender little touch had thrilled him and forced the air out of his lungs as they'd pulled away from one another and stared into one another's eyes.
The night that changed his life was a balmy May evening and the Head Healer, whom had been training Harry and taken him under his wing, and had invited Harry along with a few other protégées to a formal gathering in an expensive hotel in Paris. They were to get the train from three blocks away from the hospital they worked at and needed to bring a smart set of dark, formal robes to the function. They were to be upholding the name of the hospital and hopefully gather some possible new patients or even new recruits. The hospital always needed more recruits especially in the spell-damage ward. They needed more people to study the various effects that spells had on different people and how to reserve them. When they were being told that Harry had merely nodded along, partly because it didn't really apply to him as he was more focused on the potions aspect of things.
Hermione opened and closed her mouth, not knowing how to respond to Harry's speech. Finally, darting her eyes between the both of them, she straightened her posture stiffly and pursed her lips, "if anything goes wrong, Draco, you'll been for it. And it's just me, you have the Weasley clan as well as the press to deal with."
To Harry's surprise it didn't take long for Severus to be convinced that it would be a wonderful opportunity for the young apprentice to broaden his horizons and gain some extra knowledge of the apothecaries and tradesmen in Paris. Considering the progress Harry had made Severus had insisted that he take another day off in his week, so that he had a three-day weekend every week, for him to travel back and forth between Calais and Paris by coach as long as he studied frivolously for his exams in late June. Harry promised that he would and Lucius gave his condition that Harry were to come to the manor the following day to begin his readings to his son, and attend the final day of the function the following evening together.
Draco drew in a deep breath and held out his hand for Harry.
As cheesy and just plain awful as that line was, Draco couldn't help but smile.
me." Harry tried to shake his head but Draco wouldn't let him. Instead he leaned over and pressed tender kisses over Harry's neck and face, "If you think that I'm going to let you walk out of my life at this point then I am afraid I will just have to follow you wherever you go until you come back to me again."
"Yes you did," the older man continued steadily, "You lost sight of the distinctions between work and life. You forgot where work-Harry ends at the end of his shifts, and where home-Harry is when you get back to your apartment, and by extension you made Draco worry. You have deadened almost any psychological emotion inside your mind and you need to take the time away from everyone and everything. I believe if we take this one step at a time you will get better." He leaned forward in his chair, "I do believe that you can get better Harry, or I will die trying. Bearing in mind I will come back and harass you until you do."
Harry took Draco in his mouth again to try and ease some of the tension from his pale body. He needed to make tonight as special for the blonde man beneath him as he could. He needed to remember not to rush anything, despite the burning ache growing inside him to just dominate the blonde over and over again until he was a quivering mess beneath him. As soon as he felt that Draco had relaxed enough he leaned up and increased the rhythm of which his finger slipped in and out of the blonde man's tight body. He bent down and twisted his fingers at an awkward angle as he slicked his middle finger and then pressed that into Draco's entrance too, stopping only when the muscles tightened dramatically around his digits. "Relax," he breathed out gently as he sucked on Draco's balls.
And now the locks were gone.
Harry cocked an eyebrow, "Like a date?"
A sore lump rose in his throat, not for the first time day, as his eyes fell upon the chair. It had sat in the exact same spot since they had first moved into the apartment, together, even when they had redecorated several times he refused to move the chair from its position. Looking back on it now perhaps he had been a little too stubborn. Dropping his leather jacket on to the wooden floors underfoot –the silver zip clattering on the floor –he slowly glided over into the living room. He felt rather phantom-like of late. There was no substance to him or his way of living. The only company he could stand these days was their dog.
He watched Malfoy lower his wand, visibly shaken by the random question, but he quickly adjusted himself and sneered, "Like you give a fuck, Potter!" he spat out.
"Those were some of my memories from when I was younger! I wanted to draw a comparison for you! This is the first Christmas without Voldemort's, the first without danger around every corner! I just wanted to show you that it can get better and there's no better time to start then now!"
"Again."
And if that meant mooning over Potter, then so be it.
"I'm sorry –I'm just –happy," the blonde managed to choke as he threw an arm to hide his weeping eyes.
Several months on and he was still having nightmares of that red-eyed monster.
As they closed the main door behind them, Draco swung his light jacket over one shoulder and wrapped his other arm around Harry, tugging him close as they walked towards the promenade. The bright, neon lights shone against the early evening sky as they crossed over to the tram-stop, thier passes tucked safely into Draco's back pocket. The evening was cool and soft against their skin, though Draco could feel his palms beginning to sweat weakly as the tram creaked along the line. He was growing more and more nervous as he boarded the tram alongside Harry and a few elderly bingo-players.
Pansy pursed her lips, glaring daggers at her friend. Across the table from them, Theo's face had paled considerably as his shaking fingers reached to spoon more potatoes onto his plate. Huffing, Pansy dropped her gaze back down to her face and continued to grumble to herself. "Well we still need to determine whether the potion worked or not. He hasn't been acting any different than he usually does."
The stars twinkled in the sky, but none could compare to how brightly Draco's happy eyes glimmered.
Things cooled down for at least another week as the Second Task loomed ever closer. Potter had been spending a lot of nights in the library, sometimes with his reunited entourage and sometimes on his own and staying there long after Madam Pince had retired to bed. Draco convinced himself that he didn't think it was slightly somewhat adorable how Potter constantly yanked at his hair and grunted before dropping his scarred head onto the thick tomes in front of him.
Harry gasped and threw his head back against the back of the armchair. He was both ready and petrified for this. His body was sweating and tense. He tried to will himself to relax but he couldn't quite get there. It was hard to do when he felt Draco's long slender finger slip inside his body. He tensed, the tongue rolling over his balls trying to relax him but he was hypersensitive to every touch, every breath. He let out a moan as -very slowly -Draco started to work his finger into a rhythm. Harry's mouth fell open and his eyes rolled back as he let soft gasps whisper out into the air. His heart was speeding up as Draco took his dick back in his mouth. The combined sensation of Draco sucking his cock and fingering his arsehole was enough to make pleasure pop in every muscle.
He slumped in a sweating heap among his pillows, his arms folded over his chest and his skin feeling sickly and almost wet all over from how much he had been sweating due to his current fever. His energy had all but left him since he'd written his latest letter to Harry five days ago. He was getting a little anxious at not having gotten a response yet and it was already Tuesday evening. He hated being ill because it meant that every one of his meals would consist of breakfast items, the easier for him to digest, and he loathed every moment of it. A letter from Harry would really have made him feel better at that moment but he supposed that the brunette young man had a lot of studying to do. He didn't mind about that but he did get anxious whenever he didn't get a letter. His correspondence with Harry was the only thing that seemed to alleviate the sheer boredom of hanging around the manor all day long. A knock on his door interrupted his musings and he felt his anger burn up inside him once again and he was just about to yell for them to get away when his door opened. He tossed his head to the side and almost regretted his angered expression when he saw who was standing in the doorway.
"Just some hot-water bottles and hot chocolate to keep you warm tonight," Draco stated with a wink.
He needed to be strong.
Draco smirked, "only for you, Scarhead." His smirk grew even wider as Harry flushed and averted his gaze, as Draco pressed his warm lips to the scar on his lover's forehead.
Draco smiled and pressed a tender kiss to Harry's temples, "Now come on. Get up and get dressed and then we can relax in bed, alright? I know we already are relaxing before you get sarcastic with me, Mister Potter," he quipped with a slick to the brunette's ear, "But I mean relax enough so that we are able to drift off to sleep peacefully without having to get up and change and all that tedious rubbish."
"Louder!" Harry panted as he tugged the zipper down.
Harry backed them up until Draco's legs hit the bed. They came crashing down on the clean sheets, Harry's weight a long-missed feeling. Draco's hands clawed through Harry's hair as they attacked each other, kissing, biting and sucking on the skin being rapidly exposed to the other's gaze. Draco had to grumble when they had to manually undress. Ripping shirt buttons off and snapping leather belts against his skin only enraged his libido but it didn't help that he still didn't have Harry IN him yet.
Harry nodded his head back and forth, "sounds like Heaven right about now."
"God, you sound like mother," Draco rasped forcing his head to look away from Harry. He didn't want to be studied and scrutinized. "What are you doing here anyway? I thought I told you not to come this week?"
The kettle finished boiling.
Draco nodded as he shifted further off the bed, "Please don't stop. I need to feel you inside me. Make this feeling last, I don't want to ever let it go!"
Harry nodded and drained the rest of his flute and let out a breathy sigh into the tepid night air. "Very well then, Draco, I shall write to you but you must promise to tell me if I do bore you so that I can find something in my day that may interest you. Does that sound like a fair compromise?"
Spitting into his palm, Draco wet his cock and adjusted himself between Harry's legs. He could feel his own legs aching from where he'd been kneeling on the stone floor, but he wasn't complaining. He was more focused on the tight, hot sensation slowly easing down around his throbbing cock as he gently pushed himself into his lover's sweating, quivering body. Their conjoined groans echoed out around the room as Draco slid into him. Harry's thighs were tense and throbbing under his palms as he fully sheathed himself. "Oh God!" he grunted out, as Harry clenched around him. He jerked and groaned as he grasped the brunettes thighs tightly.
Tubes and pipes wormed their way in to his body and made Draco feel physically sick to look too long.
On one of these such evenings, as soon as he was sure Weasley and Granger had left, Draco slipped out of his nook and slipped the book he'd been pretending to read for the last hour back on the shelf, and quietly made his way over to Potter's table. Bending low to murmur in the brunette's ear he said, "Have you heard of Platform 9 and 3/4? Well, I can think of something else with the exact same measurements."
They stared at one another and breathed in deeply, their chests heaving as they glared at one another. Harry felt his heart drumming in his chest increase as Draco's grip loosened on his shirt and he jerked his hand away as though he was being burned. He sneered and turned away from Harry and stalked back across the room, raking his hands roughly through his messy blonde hair and groaning, kicking his feet at the floor and groaning out loud before turning around and yelling loudly, "I can't fucking believe this!" he shouted at the room, his rough voice echoing out across the scorched stone walls. Harry watched as the blonde boy paced, his stomach tightly knotted and throbbing with pain. He didn't know how to approach him. He didn't know how to move without his stomach screaming out to him. "Why the fuck would you even care about what happens to me?!" Draco sneered out, his red-rimmed eyes burning with tears.
As he slotted his key into the lock of the door to the apartment he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up on end and a shiver run down the length of his spine. Frowning heavily, he turned the key and pushed the door inwards and stepped into his dark apartment. As he observed the room he was confronted with, even in the darkening gloom he couldn't see anything out of place. Frowning even deeper, he dropped his keys onto a nearby table, and began turning on the oil lamps dotted about the room. The room came alive bringing small objects into sharp relief as he went about unfastening his waistcoat, shirt and trousers before toeing his shoes off and slipping down into a nearby chair. He ran a hand down his face and sighed wearily. It had been a long tiresome day. He pinched the bridge of his nose and his eyes fell upon his briefcase once again, the letters sticking out from underneath the flap. He bent down, his knees pressing into his chest, as he tugged the last couple of bundles out. His breath was a little shaky as his fingers hesitated on the already opened envelop. He didn't know why he was hesitating. He knew what the letters said, and he knew the course they took. He also knew how they ended. Did he really want to read them all over again? Slipping one out, he held it at an angle so that the firelight caught it.
Harry tilted his head slightly to one side before sighing and extending his hand out for the blonde to shake, "Do we have a deal or not, Malfoy?"
Draco came into focus as he neared the bed and sat down on the edge of it, taking Harry'd knee up off the floor, and gently kneading the pained muscles, "it's only about a quarter to ten. You crashed for a spell, so I let you rest while I got everything ready."
His stomach flipped.
"Ah! London! I used to live down there myself with Oli until we decided to move up here. The weather is good here, if it's sunny it's guaranteed to be hot and if it's cloudy you're guaranteed cold and possibly rain. None of that bollocks London weather where it's sunny and pissing down at the same time."
A week before the Final Task had everyone on edge. Draco hadn't realised just how quick the year had gone by as well as the fact that the final task was supposed to be the hardest. What if Potter didn't come back? He tried to tell himself that he didn't care, but now that it was only seven days away he couldn't lie about the sense of dread he felt pool in his stomach. He didn't sleep too well and eating was almost a distant memory.
Hermione frowned at this, "what on earth are you talking about?"
Harry blinked in surprise, "You really think that I have anything worthwhile that would keep you interested?"
His knees were widened, allowing the hot weight of Harry's body settling between them. It rubbed against his erection, making him harder. His breathing deepened. A soft moan elicited from Draco's throat as Harry pressed hot, open-mouthed kisses up his abdomen. Usually it would have tickled but, in that moment, it made every muscle quiver with anticipation.
Harry's bottom lip wobbled as he turned to face Draco, and that's when the other boy realised that there were tears in those green eyes. "How am I meant to explain to anybody that maybe I should be dead right now? That maybe it's better for me to be dead?"
They had spent the entire night sitting in their nightshirts in separate armchairs by the fireplace and spoke in hushed voices, having to lean closer together to hear the other over the soft crackling of the fire. It had been a relatively calm evening, even as the dawn had tickled at the edges of the earth and teased the sky lighter and lighter. They must have drifted off at some point because when the first twitters of the birds sung out across the sky; Draco had removed himself from the armchair, stretched his aching muscles and then grasped the head of his cane before heading for the door. Harry had followed and before he left to get a few hours of proper sleep, Draco had lowered himself against Harry and pressed their mouths together in a much stronger kiss than the evening before.
Harry gave a stiff little shrug, "It doesn't always make sense, I know. But in the long run, I think I could've been at peace to know that maybe, just maybe everyone would be alright again."
Severus nodded his head his eyes still cool and dark, "Draco, even if you never see him again help him to get through this. Help him to get better. At least that way you won't be feeling guilty when you're fully recovered and he's still stuck at my house and skulking about and wringing his hand as though he's waiting on a promise that will never ever come true for him."
Harry hugged his boyfriend hard, and then saw the perfect tree for climbing and scrambled over. Most people wouldn't have been able to climb it, but Harry had years of practise running away from his fat cousin.
"You have the kindest heart, Harry James Potter. I'm so proud of you, even if your pain set you off track a bit, you have a bright future ahead of you-" the door opened and James Potter drifted through the wall beside it. "Mrs Lily Potter, you're next." The guard said in a dull voice and so she gave Harry one last smile before disappearing through the door.
'That's it Draco, think of me and only me then you'll be free.'
MOST CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS AND THINGS BELONG TO J.K. ROWLING (However if you support her views and shit please go away <3)
"Why didn't you tell me? That you were gay?" Harry asked immediately. "I didn't think it seemed necessary. Thought you probably already knew anyway, seems as Weasel found out," Draco sighed. Harry would normally have a go at him for calling Ron 'Weasel' but today, he didn't care.
It was a Halloween party, people would be wearing costumes! Nobody would know that it was them two together! He and Draco could go in disguise. But, he would still have to deal with Ginny first. He would go to the Gryffindor common room at lunch and speak to her.
"No," Harry and Draco replied together. "Why else do you think I'm sitting in Draco's lap?" Harry giggled. "Just me," Hermione sighed. "Straight but single. You guys are all illegal yet have better love lives than I do." Everyone threw Hermione sympathetic smiles, even overly drunk Harry.
Although the three of them weren't in the best moods with one another, they all put a smile of their faces to greet Hagrid. Hagrid, wanting to catch up with the trio, just set the class to do some revision on Leshies, or more commonly known as 'The King of Nature'. Harry, Ron and Hermione sat to the side with Hagrid and wrote down a couple of notes but were more focused on talking to their old friend.
They talked for a while, and Draco got more and more comfortable with them. They treated him equally to Harry, which made him feel extremely happy. "Why are you treating me so well?" Draco asked suddenly. "I was horrible to Harry growing up, and if it were my son or daughter, I would be furious!" But Mrs Potter just smiled at him. "Because we know that you love him now. The past doesn't matter to us, just what lays ahead in the future for our son." Draco smiled and nodded. He understood.

Harry and Ginny headed up and sat down on her bed. "So," she said. "What did you want to talk to me about?" Harry took a deep breath and just thought about Draco. "I'm gay." He said plainly, holding his breath, waiting for her reaction. Ginny just stared at him, not knowing what to say or do.
Harry leapt up and let out a throaty, animal growl but Draco held up his hand, making Harry sit down again, but still glaring. "Oh look Malfoy. Got yourself a boyfriend!" She cackled. "Something that you'll never have." Harry retorted, and she stomped away.
Theirs was one of the few that had turned out correct. "Very good, very good. What do you smell Miss Granger?" Slughorn asked. "But, sir! Hermione got to smell it last time!" Pansy Parkinson interrupted. "Yes, but things you love can change as time grows. And five points from Slytherin for the interruption. Another five points taken for your pointless snickering, Mr Zabini." Slughorn smiled.
"I stopped eating. I let them abuse me with no fight, nobody was talking to me and I wasn't talking to anyone. The guilt was always nagging at me, I blamed myself for the war, for the deaths and I just didn't care about myself anymore. All this and harbouring a secret that I'm too afraid to tell-"
"Not as good as you," Draco winked and Harry blushed but grinned. Seamus spun the bottle and it landed on Hermione. "Truth or dare?" Seamus asked, burping. "Truth. Merlin knows what crazy drunk dare you'd make me do," she laughed.
The evening rolled around and Harry met Ginny outside of the portrait of the Fat Lady. "Hi Harry," she smiled, taking his hand. Harry smiled back as Ginny muttered the password and they stepped in. "Come up to my dorm, Harry," she said, dragging his arm. "But I thought boys couldn't-" Harry started. "Things changed after the war. McGonagall doesn't know though," she said, mischievous smirk upon her face.
"I love you all so much. I wish you didn't have to leave again," Harry sniffled, Sirius holding him tighter as if saying that he wasn't going anywhere. "We'll always be here when you ask for us Harry, we'll try as hard as we can," Remus said. "When your desperate and in need of help," Lily added. "And when your walking down the aisle." James smiled broadly.  Harry blushed but he knew they were talking the truth. "Just ask for us." Lily smiled and then, they were gone.
"Hello, Draco." The man said stiffly, and what Draco saw made him gasp. Sure, they all said Harry looked like him but he never knew they were so similar! "Um, Draco, meet my Mum and Dad. They're just here for a little bit because I got lonely and bored." Harry smiled sheepishly.
This potion is for a Ghosts use only. It allows its user to be able to do things a human can; walk-not drift, pick up physical objects, touch another human etc. Although still dead, they can act like a living being. If brewed correctly, it will last for twenty four hours at a time.
"Anyway," Sirius coughed. "I actually came here to tell you about this. It's a letter from the ministry. I have a trial a few days before yours to prove my innocence. I'm allowed three witnesses and I was wondering if you would be the third?" He asked hopefully.
"You bring out the best in me? No, that's not right. How about?..."
"It's alright, I forgive you." Harry stopped at Ron's expression of shock. "I said I would forgive if you could learn to accept. Well. now there is nothing for you to accept, so it's fine." Harry forced a smile at Ron who returned it gladly.
Draco jumped off of the bed and Harry followed.  "I thought I locked the door," Harry muttered, kicking himself. "We are fucking WIZARDS mate, a locked door isn't going to do anything!" Ron snapped. "Ron, please let me explain-" Harry pleaded, but Ron wouldn't hear it.
"He did," Harry smiled. "He convinced me that he was telling the truth. Draco really was under the imperius curse."
"Oh yeah, that's right. Everyone you know just drops dead at your feet." "Ronald, stop!" Hermione gasped. Harry just stood there, processing the words. "Your right. It is my fault." Harry whispered, tears rolling down his face.
"Go and find him Draco! Tell him that you're in love with me!" She squealed, and Draco obeyed, although the screaming voice in the back of his head told him not to. That voice, not his, sounded so familiar yet Draco couldn't pin a point on it. So as he ran up the steps of the school, Pansy following behind him excitedly, acting like a kid about to be taken to get their first wand, he caught up with Harry and yanked the neck of his robes.
Ron almost choked on his food, then finally put his fork down. "Azkaban of course. Horrid things, gay wizards are. Mum always told me to respect all wizards alike, but the gay ones are horrible." He said, almost shivering at the thought. Harry felt his heart drop. His best friend, couldn't accept him. That's if, he was actually gay of course.
"My whole life, I have been abused by the Dursley's. Verbal and Physical," Harry paused as Hermione gasped and tears filled his eyes, which he tried to blink away. "When I got back, I tried to use magic when they weren't looking to do my chores quicker, but I was caught and there was punishment. Vernon stopped my food supply for a month, and after that, I just pretty much stopped eating all over."
Draco took Harry up to the Room of Requirements where they were meant to meet later anyway and lay him on the bed that sat in the corner. He had arrived in the Room of Requirements earlier, and was about to start his fort when his wrist throbbed where the heart was and he had rushed to Harry.
'Well this sure complicates things' Harry thought to himself. "I'm not really paying attention to anyone at the minute. I meant what I said when we were in care of magical creatures. I don't know what I want to do when we get out of school," he sighed, rubbing his temples. "I thought you wanted to become an auror?" Hermione asked. "I did. But, I just didn't feel the same way about the job after the war." Ron and Hermione just nodded. "Maybe I'll just get a muggle job," Harry laughed, looking at the horrified expression on Ron's face. "Kidding!"
It could even get to the point where they end up murdering someone, so basically, your stuck with me forever!" Draco grinned. "I am definitely not complaining" Harry whispered as they got up and made their way to the castle grounds.
"Now, what horrific costumes are we going to have to wear?" Draco sighed. Well, when I'm with Ginny I'll just throw on a cape and give myself some fake fangs, I have to make sure I'm recognisable as myself. Then when, we're together, we need to be un-recognisable," Harry nodded. He then took his wand out an pointed it at Draco's face.
"I've told you before now I'm going to tell you again. I am going to help you get better. Even if it takes months, weeks, years, I'll always be here to help you," Draco smiled. "I promise."
In the end, Sirius had to floo back to Grimmauld Place as it was getting late but he told Harry he would be back the next day. Reluctantly, Harry let go of his Godfather and headed back to eighth year tower.
They danced together, words unnecessary for all their emotions had been translated into dance. They waltzed around the room, falling into perfect step oblivious to everybody else in the room. For now, it was just the two of them.
The next morning, five eighth years nursed hangovers and felt 'actual, emotional pain' at the thought they had to go to classes later. Harry and Draco headed down to the great hall together in silence, neither one of them fully aware of their surroundings.
“Boring,” he said plainly.
“You assume correctly,” Alecto replied for him. He swallowed his disdain for the woman and held his mother’s hand. She must’ve noticed his trembling because she tightened her grip, almost painfully.
Shivers ran up and down his arms, he blamed it on the combination of the creepiness and the chill in the room.
Draco tried to ignore the man’s intense stare. If Voldemort was trying to get information out of him; he wouldn’t get any. He wouldn’t.
Draco made the mistake of catching The Dark Lord’s red eyes, and then he was stuck. Defiance burned within Draco and threatened to explode through his eyes. He grit his teeth, blankly staring down the scaly shite. “Kill Professor Dumbledore,” he rolled his Rs lowly.
Draco tightened the fist in his front pocket, “And what are these tasks?”
“It went well, I assume.”
Draco looked up at his mother as she sat next to his legs.
“Are you quite alright Dragon?”
“Excellent,” still, the insane mirth that was on his face when Draco entered the office hadn’t returned, “Do not concern yourself with the ‘how’s my boy, sufficient help will be given to aid you. You’re dismissed.”
table where Draco saw a woman die before his very own grey eyes. He didn’t much like muggles, but they didn’t deserve to die, certainly not like that.
Father’s study wasn’t usually this dull and cold. He usually had the fire going and house elves bringing him snacks while he worked. Now, the only light inside was a few candles around the room, and a stranger sat in Lucius Malfoy’s chair. Draco rolled his shoulders as he entered. The bulky werewolf shut the door behind him, leaving the blonde alone with the Dark Lord himself. This was the first time he was abandoned with the man. He tried to forget about his nerves and venture deeper into the room. His parents tried to teach the fidgety behavior out of him at a young age, and hopefully it would come in handy now. If he wasn’t very focused about not seeming weak or scared, Draco would be picking things up idly and playing with them. He did it a lot with books; he’d pick them up, feel the pages as he ran his thumb over them, and then set it down again.
Draco left as fast as he could without looking as defeated as he felt. When he arrived safely back in his room, the windowsill is where he went. To sit and watch the peacocks idle around the flowers and bushes. He didn’t sit there long before he got up again. He began a letter to Blaise. He was very helpful when it came to planning, but not so much at comforting. Halfway through the letter, he started one for Pansy.
