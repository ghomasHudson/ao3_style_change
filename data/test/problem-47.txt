Ron tilts his head. “Oh! So, it’s a guy then! Hm. This is fun. I’m pretty sure I’ll find out who it is by the end of this term.”
Draco reaches for a powder, reaches past Harry and brushes his stomach, making Harry hiss. Thankfully, no-one but Draco notices. They bot turn a dark shade of red.
His words get stuck in his throat when Ron enters the living room, arms wrapped tightly around Draco Malfoy’s shoulders and guiding him towards the couch.
Draco opens the door, and when they step inside, they almost have to laugh. The room has stayed the same, but the sofas are now gone. Instead, there’s a huge, comfy looking bed in the middle of the room.
"I know", Draco grins, shaking his head in disbelief. "You really bring out the worst in me, Potter."
Neville slaps his own head. “For fuck's sake! I’m totally with Harry now. He did the right thing, the smart thing, you know? You would’ve kept this facade of tiptoeing around each other up for years, probably. I understand why he had to stop this.”
He begins to build up a steady rhythm with his tongue. Draco starts to move restlessly below him, arching his back and grabbing the sheets for support.
He quickly sits down in the bathtub, hides his body with his arms, and grabs the showerhead. He turns it on and waits for the water to warm up, while Draco sits down on the floor.
Harry licks his lips and pulls Draco’s cheeks apart. Then, in a moment of bravery, he sinks down and begins to fuck Draco’s arse with his tongue.
Eventually, after half an hour of waiting and drinking the rest of their alcohol, they get inside the club. The music is loud, it’s dark, and there are people everywhere. If Harry would be sober, he would absolutely hate this. Thankfully, he’s already feeling the alcohol clouding his brain. His muscles feel much more relaxed than usual, his brain is foggy, and he feels more carefree.
The door opens, and Draco’s head pops through the door. “I saw the light in your room. I figured you couldn’t sleep either, so I thought I’d knock.”
. First, when we made this stupid deal to fuck while high on Armortentia. And then again, when we agreed on being just friends.”
Draco pulls down his jeans and his boxers, urging Harry to do the same, then the boy sits down on Draco’s lap and presses his lips back onto Draco’s.
!", Draco says throwing his hands up but even to him it sounds pathetic. "Everything is wrong about that!”
Draco finishes his cigarette and flicks it away. Then, he gets up. “I’ll get back inside now. See you later.”
When Harry is sitting at lunch the other day, a young boy comes up to him. Harry feels incredibly awkward when he asks for a photograph.
But that means that Draco doesn't have something to eat for lunch anymore. Therefore, he finds himself getting some pasta and veggies in the crowded cafeteria. He sits down in a quiet corner where he won't be disturbed and begins to eat his meal.
Maybe it's meant to be, him and Harry. Everything that has happened so far seems like destiny. Draco doesn't believe in coincidences anyway.
Malfoy chuckles. Harry’s heart stammers inside his chest. Merlin.  „Nothing’s changed, has it? You’re still running straight into trouble.”
On Thursday, Draco gives his lunch away to his coworker Luna who looks like she might pass out. She's trying this new crazy diet that Draco consistently tried to talk her out of. Before she could pass out, Draco gave her his organic roasted chicken with potatoes and veggies, reassuring her that it's fine, that Draco could eat something else.
Draco chuckles at Harry's eagerness and grabs his head with both his hands, stilling the boy. He kisses him passionately now, much slower, much more intimate.
Draco physically needs to see Harry. He feels like he’s suffocating without him, like a starving man desperate for food.
Harry leads them to the table where Ron, Hermione, Dean, Seamus and Luna already sit. Draco has seen pictures and has heard stories about each and every one of them.
"Anyway", Harry says and sits down on the grey couch in Draco's office. "I have to write an assignment and I feel really lost. I was hoping you could help me?"
Harry closes his eyes, pulls his legs close to his chest, and lets Draco do all the work. Draco gives Harry the showerhead back, opens the little shampoo bottle carefully, and lets some of the potion drop over Harry’s head. Then, he begins to massage Harry’s scalp. Harry purrs.
Draco rips off his tie and furiously fumbles with the buttons of his shirt. “Fuck, Harry, help me take this off. It’s way too hot, I can’t breathe. I feel like suffocating.”
There’s a stair on the right leading upstairs and a door to the left, probably leading into the kitchen.
Draco pushes himself up, away from Harry. He gets out of the bed and starts to pick up his clothes from where they took them off last night. Harry watches him get dressed. Even now, sober and conscious, he can’t deny that Draco has delicate, soft skin and a wonderfully toned body. He feels his cock twitch at the sight. Harry stops his thoughts right then and there. No, he’s
Harry follows Ron’s eyes and his stomach drops the moment he sees Draco. He knows it’s him. The silver hair and the long, petite body give him away. Also, the way Draco holds somebody else’s waist and snogs this handsome man seems too familiar. That's how Draco used to snog him.
“Harry, you have no idea how fucking good this feels. Please, fuck me harder. Touch me everywhere. I need you so much; please don’t stop.”
Harry snorts again. He feels as if someone had punched him right in his stomach. After a few coughs, he stares at Draco. “Excuse me?”
Draco beams like a ball of light and Harry has to look away. His heart aches and he starts to wonder whether Ron was actually right. Maybe they are like two cars destined to crash into one another. Maybe this whole thing will blow up in their faces. Harry’s throat feels dry and he needs some orange juice to swallow the toast.
Eventually, Draco sighs. It seems as if he has given up fighting against Harry’s help. “I’m turning into a Veela if you really must know.”
“You can do nothing, Potter”, Draco almost cries and it doesn’t even sound angry. Draco simply is in a lot of pain, Harry can tell.
watching you with that guy,” Draco mumbles against Harry’s lips as he begins to kiss him passionately. “It drove me insane. I wanted to grab you, kiss you, make him understand that you’re not his.”
Harry ignores the tight feeling in his chest and decides not to comment on that. He lets Draco work in peace. Harry tries to stop himself from thinking.
Draco sighs. Then he chuckles and shrugs. "It's fine. You can call me Draco in here. But you still have to call me Mr Malfoy outside this office, okay?"
A lot, Harry thinks. He’s starting to enjoy talking to Malfoy, even if it makes him feel uneasy most of the time. He still enjoys it. He doesn’t want to destroy this tiny little development with Malfoy. But at the same time, he’s really horny, has been for months. And this could actually help him relax and make him feel good.
When Draco goes for his usual Sunday morning walk, he thinks about calling his mum. Maybe he would cook pasta with salmon later.
Harry’s head starts to spin and he feels weirdly anxious and aroused at the same time. “I had no idea that you were a Veela.”
They use the exit at the back that leads to a secluded smoking area. The two men sit down on the bench with some safe space between them. Harry watches Draco fumble with the pocket of his jacket, and when he finally pulls out his cigarettes, he offers Harry one. And even though Harry doesn’t usually smoke, he takes a cigarette and puts it between his lips.
“Harry, mate. Have you gone insane? What the hell are you doing? And why does it smell like French cheese all of a sudden?” Ron hisses again.
Draco feels partly disappointed and partly relieved when his navigation system tells him they’ve arrived.
Draco meets every thrust, moaning and crying at the same time. “Harry, you have no idea how fucking good this feels. Please, fill me up, fuck me, touch me. I need you so much, please don’t stop.”
Harry only laughs at that. It’s the most beautiful sound. “Okay, maybe I am flirting with you. What’s so wrong about that?”
When Harry and Draco sitting in the library, both studying or doing homework, they sit so close, Harry would only have to move an inch or two and their arms would be touching. He bites his tongue and stops himself from shifting closer to Draco.
Being just friends with Draco turns out to be so much harder than Harry originally had thought. Sure, Harry had noticed before that he felt strangely attracted to Draco. He had noticed weird feelings beginning to develop.
The fact that he’s looking forward to his Tuesday history lecture scares him. Nothing about that lecture is special, nothing makes it different than the others lectures or seminars. Nothing makes it stand out.
Draco begins to push him to the edge of the bathtub, pushes him against the cold stone, and presses his own body and his hardening cock against Harry’s stomach. Harry sighs happily. He feels butterflies not only in his stomach but in his entire body.
“Okay”, Draco shouts and tries to focus on his task as a professor. He should not let Harry get to him that way. “Everyone listen up. Please build groups of five. We won’t be able to go up altogether, but with five people, we should be fine. We should have six groups. We’ll meet down here again in an hour!”
Maybe it’s the soft touch, perhaps it’s Draco’s sweet voice. Maybe it’s just Draco’s presence in general. But Harry begins to calm down. He feels the adrenaline slowly wearing off and removes his hand from the guy. He takes a step back and takes a deep, shaky breath.
“It’s beautiful here”, Draco speaks and for a moment, they simply stand in the middle of the sand dunes, watching the ocean and the beach. Harry hasn’t felt this peaceful in months. He squeezes Draco’s arm and feels a weird tightness in his chest.
The other man jumps up in surprise and turns around. “Oh. Good morning, Harry. Didn’t expect you to be up already.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry’s heart speeds up as he feels Malfoy’s eyes watching him. Harry licks his lips. “I don’t think you're trouble.”
Ginny grins. “Because you two are being absolutely ridiculous, and you really need to get your shit together. Off you go.”
“Harry, for fuck’s sake, Draco is obsessed with you! And you’re obsessed with him, how can you be this freaking daft, I don-“
Harry blinks in surprise and feels as if somebody had woken him up from a dream. He clears his throat and gets up – too quickly. All of a sudden, he feels dizzy and for a few seconds, his vision turns black.
Draco grabs Harry’s shoulders and gently turns him around. He grabs Harry’s ass cheeks and begins to massage them softly but firmly.
Harry closes his eyes, feeling exhausted. He shouldn’t fall asleep, but it’s so relaxing and comfortable lying here with Draco. He feels safe.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Harry!” Draco shouts, arching his back. “Fuck. I need you inside me right now, please, fill me up, quit the teasing. Be rough with me.”
Harry shakes his head and rubs his hands together. He envies Malfoy for the scarf because it’s really getting colder every day. “Fuck, I hate it.”
Harry doesn’t want to rush anything. He wants to soak this moment, breathe it in and never forget how happy, complete, and fulfilled he feels. This view of Draco being sprawled all over the bed will haunt him for the rest of his life. He reaches out and begins to run his hands over Draco’s back. He gently traces patterns on Malfoy’s muscles, squeezes every now and then, and begins to massage him.
Suddenly, Draco huffs out a laugh. “Merlin, I can’t believe what just happened. I can’t believe we just did that!”
Harry feels confident about their plan. The Armortentia agreement had to stop eventually. And Harry is glad that they found a healthy, mature way to handle the situation.
They kiss for a little more until they both start to get too tired. Draco rolls off Harry, snuggles into his side, and throws his arm over Harry’s stomach.
Now, Draco does look up. His grey eyes watch Harry with an unreadable expression and Harry feels breathless all of a sudden. If he could only read Malfoy's mind.
When he wakes up after a very short night, he stumbles into the bathroom and jumps into the shower. Then, he grabs his jeans and a hoodie, gets dressed, and heads downstairs. He can already smell bacon and eggs coming from the kitchen. Harry smiles when he steps closer and watches Draco cook.
Harry’s dick twitches in anticipation, he’s getting harder and harder every passing second. Merlin, he cannot take advantage of Draco like that. The man is in severe pain and Harry can’t control himself enough to help him through it and not lure him into liking Harry’s touch.
Draco has never been this intimate with someone before. Sure, he’s had sex and blowjobs and all that. But he’s never held someone this close before, calming them down and being their rock.
Harry opens his legs even further, allowing Draco to push in all the way. Draco uses this for his advantage and thrusts into the boy.
“Unless you don’t want to?”, Harry asks him, suddenly feeling shy. He knew he overstepped a line. Draco doesn’t really want this.
Harry sits down next to Luna and stares at his shaking hands. Luna reaches out and grabs ahold of them. “It’ll be fine, Harry. Don’t worry.”
“But why would you stop?”, Ron almost shouts frustrated. “I don’t get it. You were both so happy. Why don’t you just date?”
“Um”, Harry says nervously. “How is that supposed to help us? Malfoy, you still haven’t explained to me what’s wrong.”
But now that he isn’t officially allowed to reach out and touch Draco whenever they spend time together, Harry painfully notices how often he feels the desire to kiss him, hug him, hold his hand, stroke his hair, or caress his arms.
Harry obliges because the desire, the want, the lust is burning in his lungs and he needs all of Draco, right now.
Draco should’ve known Harry would not let this thing between them go. He freaking should have known.
Draco watches him again. “I know what you mean. But I still prefer it this way.” His shoulders tense up and he almost seems shy now. “We talk now. That’s very positive to me.”
“Harry, things have never not been messed up between you guys. We’re talking about you and Malfoy!”, Ron almost shouts in frustration.
Harry grabs a box filled with stamps from the cupboard on the left and transfigures one of them into fairy lights. Then, he transfigures the others into Christmas tree baubles and tree decoration.
But with Harry, it's different. They stay in the office until it's dark outside, both not saying a word and working on whatever they have to do.
“Oh my god,” Harry groans and pushes himself up with his arms. He’s beginning to sweat, and he needs a moment to collect himself.
Harry watches him amused and sets up the DVD. Then, he sits back down next to Draco and begins the movie.
Draco licks his lips and stares at Harry for a while. He clears his throat, lost in his thoughts. “Yeah, I guess I do.”
Draco stares at Harry in disbelief for a second, then he bursts out into a genuine fit of laughter. He throws his head back, his mouth is wide open and his eyes sparkle in amusement as he lets out the most beautiful laugh Harry’s ever heard. He notices that he never actually heard Draco laugh like this before.
Draco relaxes but chooses to ignore how his heart stings at the realisation that Harry joked about wanting to see him more.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut. His cock is so hard that it's almost painful. Hearing Harry begging for it does sinful things to him.
He sends an email to every department, telling them to send a round-mail to every student with the information.
"Finally, man", Dean says and embraces Draco in a hug. "Harry hasn't shut up about you since his first lecture like six months ago or something. I was getting tired of his thirsting."
Harry feels his chest tighten at the sight of Draco in so much pain. He wishes he could do something, anything to help. “I don’t understand.”
Harry keeps Draco's hand steady and helps him put the powder into the Cauldron. When it's done, Harry steps away from Draco and tries to cool down a bit. Is it just him or did the temperature rise in the last few minutes?
The rest of the day, Harry stays away from him. Draco stares at the boy every few seconds but doesn’t get a response from him at all. Is he ignoring Draco? Is he simply tired? Is he not feeling well? It drives Draco nuts.
Fuck. Why did Harry and Draco both think this was a good idea again? Harry knew it would be fucking awkward the moment he could think clearly again.
They both head upstairs and go into their own separate rooms. Harry almost wants to suggest to share a room, but he knows that wouldn’t end well. He really can’t sleep in the same bed as Draco and not make a move on the other man. But staring at the lonely bed in his room seems wrong. He shouldn’t be sleeping here alone. Harry sighs. Get it together, man. Just friends.
Harry considers this for a moment. But then he agrees. He might never actually meet up with him, but accepting his number sounds fair enough.
Draco nods. He bites Harry’s lip and pulls him even closer. “You make me lose my mind, Harry.” They stroke each other in the same rhythm; their dicks are sliding against each other every so often. Harry is close to passing out.
Harry jumps up again and knocks over the glass of water Draco had used for his paintings on the floor. “Shit!”
“Harry,” Draco groans. Harry begins to lick the inside of Draco’s thighs, occasionally bites as he strokes Draco’s hole with his fingertip.
“I know what you’re thinking: Neville doesn’t know the whole story. It’s complicated. Blablabla. But honestly, both of you seem so much happier ever since you started hooking up, I think you – “
Luna squeezes his hands. “If it makes you feel better, they forced a shot of Veritaserum down Draco’s throat too.”
A week later it turns out all of his worries were useless. Over 160 students signed up for the trip.
"Okay", Draco croaks. He seems even paler than before and the shaking has gotten worse. "We're done."
He continues to suck him until Draco painfully pulls on Harry’s hair. “Stop. Stop. I’m about to cum.”
Harry bites down onto Draco’s skin as he continues to slam into Draco harder and harder. He fastens his pace, holds himself up by grabbing Draco’s hips with both his hands. Then, he grabs Draco’s left thigh, pushes it up, and guides it so that it now lays away from Draco in a 90-degree angle. This allows Harry to slide inside Draco even deeper. He hits him from a new angle. “Fuck, Draco, you have no idea how good this feels. So fucking good. You’re so hot.”
He closes the distance between them and presses his lips against Draco’s as fireworks explode around them.
Draco sighs. “It doesn’t have to be weird. Right? We’re both different now. I’m not saying we should be friends. But let’s just not make it weird.”
Harry doesn’t know why the hell he’s sharing that kind of information with Draco freaking Malfoy. But he feels comfortable enough right now.
“Sorry, but I really can’t”, Harry says. Even if he wanted to leave, his overprotective heart would stop him from doing so.
Harry breathes heavily, the rhythm of his hips stuttering as he holds on to Draco’s shoulder with one arm, the other arm reaches around Draco’s torso and grabs his pulsing cock. He begins to massage him, matching the rhythm of his hips.
He surges forward and places his hand on Draco’s shoulder. The other is gripping the dildo tightly. He conjures some lube and places it at the entrance of Draco’s round arse.
Harry slowly pulls the finger out of Draco, giving him time to adjust. He remembers that Draco had told him that he hadn’t had sex in a very long time. The last thing he wants to do is hurt the man. Therefore, he gently pushes back in and moves the finger inside of Draco, curls it, and teases him with as much care as possible. He tries to read Draco’s reactions, but he doesn’t know if Draco is in pain or in pleasure, judging by the way he’s squirming and moving underneath him.
“Ready?” he whispers and holds onto the raven-haired man’s waist. For some reason, this feels so much more intimate and serious than the many other times they’ve fucked. This almost feels like making love. Or maybe Harry has officially lost his mind and is imagining things.
Harry presses his lips together as if he’s gathering up the courage. Then he finally says “Here, I’ll give you my number. Will you text me when you know?”
Ron grins and shakes his head. “No, Harry. Not just a habit. You usually don’t even shower before going out to get laid. This is new.”
Everything went well so far. All the students showed up half an hour early, just like he told them to.
Harry stares at the guy who is shivering and squeaking in panic below him. Harry did defeat Voldemort after all. The guy better be scared of him.
After the students have been chosen, he feels a heavy weight being lifted off his chest. Draco couldn’t be happier. He sends an email to all the students who managed to get a spot to meet him on Wednesday at four o’clock in one of the lecture halls.
They cast a cleaning spell and eventually get dressed. Draco’s and Harry’s hair is a mess, their cheeks are rosy, and they look way too happy. All of their friends will know what they did, but they don’t care.
Harry smiles. “I’m glad we moved on. And honestly, it’s not even that odd. We actually have quite a few things in common. It just works between us, you know?”
Harry listens to him. He can’t believe he’s actually opening up like this. Draco never talks about his feelings. Even Blaise and Pansy have mentioned that to Harry a few times before. Over time, they had all started hanging out more.
Harry frowns. He wants to ask what kind of things Draco means, but his mouth forms other words for him instead.
Harry licks his lips and kneads his hands. “Um. I’ve booked a little house near the beach and I’m going to spend Christmas with Draco there.”
Draco eventually sighs. “What a shame. We could really help each other out. If only we would find each other attractive.”
Draco gives Harry what he needs eventually. He puts in a second finger and works him open slowly. After some time, he adds a third finger.
“It only gets painful when a potential mate is in close proximity to help turn the person into an even stronger Veela.”
Draco kisses Harry’s cheek. “I’m really sorry you had to go through all of this. I know that I wasn’t exactly nice to you back then either.”
His friends wait and give Harry some time to collect his thoughts. “It was wonderful. Really. We got along so well. Everything was perfect. And then, I snapped and I kissed him and we had sex.”
Harry begins to suck the soft skin at Draco’s neck. He bites it, licks over it. Then, the wizard shakes his hand free from Draco’s firm grip, wraps his arm around Draco’s waist, and pulls him impossibly closer. He reaches out for Draco’s cock and begins to stroke him.
Harry rolls his eyes. “He’s not everyone. I’m pretty sure that he doesn’t even like me if it weren’t for the … um … - the
Draco grins. “Same. Anyway. May I offer you some firewhiskey?” Draco tilts his chin and points to the bottle of firewhiskey on the table.
Harry holds his breath and presses his lips together. "I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
The boy stopped attending his lectures. He simply stopped coming. Draco knows he can’t blame him. He’d probably not show up too if he was in Harry’s position.
Harry steps inside, Draco following him after. Then, the younger boy nods and stops dead in his tracks. He looks up at Draco, presses him against the door and
Draco watches Harry confused. Didn't he just flirt with the beautiful boy in the cafeteria? Why is he now flirting with Draco?
Harry stares at Draco, lost in thought. If he moved a little closer, he could probably kiss him. But if he did that, he would ruin everything between them. And after spending the entire Christmas Break with Draco, Harry isn’t sure how he’s ever going to live without him. Being around Draco is so easy and wonderful. They keep their eye contact for a while. Then, Draco clears his throat and rolls out of bed.
Harry feels overwhelmed. God, Draco smells fantastic. Keep it cool. Don’t think about it. “Um. Yeah. I – I don’t know – I felt very stressed.”
“I-“, Harry begins but stops himself. Why on earth is he upset? They’re not in a relationship. They’re not officially dating. They’re not even friends. Not really. Draco can snog whoever the hell he wants. Harry has no right to be upset. Logically speaking, Harry totally knows and understands that. But his heart tells him other things. His heart is upset and sad and angry and fuck - The way he’s feeling is absolutely ridiculous. Why is he feeling as if a truck just hit him with full force?
“I know this is probably an unpopular opinion, but I actually find Draco Malfoy quite handsome”, Ginny giggles as she takes another sip of her fire whiskey.
He grabs Harry’s waist and pulls him close to his body, stumbles backwards against his car and runs his hands all over Harry’s body. Thank god the boy is wearing joggers, Draco can feel
He slams into Draco, hard and fast. He holds on to Draco’s waist, and he’s sure there’s going to be bruises tomorrow. Draco’s hands fist the sheets, his hips meet Harry’s thrusts and he cries out desperately. “Harry, Merlin. Fuck, yes!”
Draco laughs. Harry tilts his head in surprise. It’s a beautiful sound, and it makes something inside of Harry's tingle. He’s never really heard Malfoy laugh before, he notices.
“I’m just telling you”, Neville pressures and puts his mug on Draco’s kitchen table. “Make a move. Be happy, be brave.”
But ever since Harry introduced himself to Draco, he can’t get him out of his head. He has to think about him nonstop, it’s actually crazy.
Harry eventually decides to leave Hogwarts as well. Hermione, Ron, Harry, and Neville head to the Burrow on Friday evening.
Draco smiles. „You’re young. You’ve got your whole life ahead of you. I’m certain you will find your way.”
Draco recognises him immediately. Lean body, messy raven hair and glasses that he could recognise everywhere.
because he cares about Draco Malfoy. Definitely not. When he spots the blonde man in the crowd, Harry immediately notices that Draco looks even paler than before and now he’s hunched over in pain.
Draco turns around, reaches for the two bottles of Armortentia, and holds one out to Harry. “Cheers!”
“Alright, mum, I’ll be home in about 40 minutes, I have to go grocery shopping first”, Draco speaks into his phone, whilst finishing his cup of tea.
Ron’s hand squeezes his shoulder. “I’m sorry, man. I think he just saw you flirting with that bloke.”
When the group eventually heads to their dorms, Harry desperately doesn’t want their first evening back at Hogwarts to end just yet.
Harry presses his lips together, not wanting to interrupt Draco’s flow. His eyes sparkle and he seems so excited. Harry doesn’t want to ruin that right now. He continues to watch Draco through the mirror, feeling his heart clench inside his chest.
New Year’s Eve is only two days away and Harry would much rather spend it all by himself in his bed, but his family doesn’t allow him to do that.
“I don’t know”, Draco admits. “I didn’t want to owl you first. I wanted to give you some space. Figure everything out.”
Everything he felt in that club was completely Harry, not some weird love potion. And Harry can’t help but wonder whether Draco felt the same.
The memories come flooding back in. The Room of Requirement, the Armortentia, the sex, Draco. He takes a deep breath and sinks into Draco’s arms. He doesn’t know if he’s still under the influence of Armortentia or if it has now worn off. All he can think of is Draco and his arms and the safety that he feels when he’s with Draco.
"I'm sorry. I had no idea", Harry says and genuinely means it. Watching Draco in so much pain was terrible. "I hope I never have to see you in so much pain again."
The others hum in agreement. Harry’s head spins. It’s probably just the alcohol. The others chat about attractive guys and girls for a while, but Harry doesn’t really focus anymore. He thinks about silver-blonde hair, grey eyes, and long, slim legs.
„I mean, it’s just a few words from me to the students, nothing special“, Draco quickly adds when he sees the smug smile on Harry’s face.
Their hands touch for the tiniest moment, sending shivers down his spine. Draco licks his lips and gulps.
Harry feels reassured. Maybe this does mean something. He begins stroking Draco’s back gently, moving his hands lower and lower.
Draco wraps his arms around Harry and presses a gentle kiss to his forehead. "I was really worried you had already moved on, you know."
Turning his head, he searches for Malfoy and walks further into the large bathroom, only to be met with a shirtless Draco pouring some oils into the huge bathtub filled with bubbles.
He follows Draco into his bedroom, suddenly very aware of the fact that he’s only wearing soaking wet underwear and a towel wrapped around his shoulders.
Harry’s heart swells at the sight of the tiny thing. He conjures some cheese and very softly moves closer to the animal.
Draco arches his back, his mouth falls open, his eyes roll back, and Draco’s entire body tenses. “Fuck, this feels so so so good. You have no idea.”
Harry bites down onto Draco’s skin as he continues to slam into Draco. “Fuck, Draco feels so good. You’re so hot, fuck.”
For what feels like hours they stay in their position, not saying anything. Harry lies on top of Draco, his soft cock still inside of the blonde man, sighing happily.
When he finishes work that day, he immediately drives to Neville’s flat. He bangs on the door impatiently.
Together, they exit the room of requirement and head down to the dungeons. Harry points out that they should probably use his cloak of invisibility since they’re on school grounds, and they’re not exactly allowed to go to the dungeons at midnight, but Draco couldn’t care less.
He ignores Ron’s knowing stare. How did Ron figure Harry out this quickly? Harry hasn’t even figured it out for himself. He's got no clue what's going on with him. He continues to stare at the dance floor, desperately trying to find Draco. Now that he knows for sure that he’s here Harry scams the entire dancefloor. But it’s too dark and the people move too fast. There’s no way he could make out anyone in this light.
If Harry had received attention before the war during his time at Hogwarts for being known as the Boy Who Lived, it was absolutely nothing compared to the way people treat him now.
It’s getting difficult. And Harry can no longer bullshit himself. Who is he even trying to fool here? He’s right in the middle of falling in love with Draco Malfoy. Completely sober, completely conscious. No love potions involved. Being “friends” with Draco only made him realize how much he doesn’t want to be friends with him. He wants to be with Draco. He wants everything with Draco. The sex, the kissing, the cuddling, then falling asleep next to each other, the hanging out, the jokes, the conversations, the long walks around the Great Lake, the yoga sessions, the study sessions, the stuffing their faces with cake, Draco.
Harry tilts his head. “I’m not sure if it’s possible to catch up with Muggles if you never really lived with them. Muggle society is actually pretty creative and also complicated.”
Harry shakes his head again. He sighs. “I don’t know. I just don’t like talking about sex in general. It’s super private.”
Neville tilts his head. “Well, that doesn’t sound like ‘not knowing each other well’. It seems as if you guys spent a lot of time with each other.”
“Fuck, you have no idea how hot you look tonight,” Draco moans as he reaches for Harry’s cock. Harry feels close to passing out the moment Draco’s hand touches his aching dick. Harry reaches for Draco’s cock and begins to stroke him. They moan into each other’s mouth.
Harry tilts his head and thinks for a moment. The thought of Draco not having a good time during Christmas breaks his heart and his hero complex is coming through. “Remember right before the Halloween break, when we thought about staying in Hogwarts? Just the two of us?”
With an excited shy smile, he hurries to the lecture hall and unlocks the door. He’s half an hour early, as always. Draco isn’t crazy, he just likes to be prepared and he likes things to be well organized.
Harry nods even though he wants to argue with Malfoy and tell him that he doesn't believe him. He steps closer to Malfoy and has to close his eyes for a second. Draco smells absolutely amazing, it drives him crazy.
Harry barks out a loud laugh, feeling a bubbly excitement in his chest. “Yeah. They do have their moments.”
Draco’s jaw clenches. “But I fell for you anyway, you know? Fuck, I fell so hard, you have no idea.”
“So, you just confirmed that I match your type. But you don’t find me attractive,” Harry eventually repeats.
If Draco could think straight, he would snap at Harry and never talk to him again, Harry is sure of that.
Harry can’t concentrate on his Professor, telling him about Ancient Wizard History. He’s not tired – he’s restless. His mind rushes to ten million different places, he scratches the wood of the table and uses his magic to get it repaired, and he bounces his leg up and down.
“Mhm.” He doesn’t notice the curious glances and smirks his friends are exchanging. “You might reconsider tagging along.”
But Draco doesn't listen. He begins to massage Harry’s shoulder with his free hand. The other pushes into Harry at a quick pace. Harry needs to focus. Otherwise, he might come just from this.
He sighs, rubs his eyes in an attempt to wake up and gets out of his chair. His office looks like a mess. Technically, any normal person would still consider it very tidy but to Draco, it is a total mess. He's a tidy person and he needs everything to be clean and organized.
Draco licks his lips and pulls Harry’s cheeks apart. Then, he blows a soft airflow on his delicate skin.
Then, Harry surges forward and presses his lips on top of the other man’s lips. Lucas gasps in surprise but seems to recover quickly. He grabs Harry’s face with both his hands and begins to kiss him passionately.
“It’s another muggle thing. Every single muggle has one of those. Honestly, if you don’t have a phone at this point you’re considered old-fashioned, weird, or an alternative hipster. Everybody has a phone. Everybody!”
He moves closer to Draco and waits for him to make the next move. He eventually does by taking Harry’s hand and guiding him to the big bathtub. The water is warm and smells fantastic. “Mmm. What did you put in there?”
“You look like a deer caught in the headlights”, Draco jokes. But it’s not funny to Harry. He does feel as if he’s not fully present, a thousand thoughts running through his mind.
Draco trusts Harry and follows him inside. It’s pretty and cosy. The restaurant is dimly lit and the tables are decorated in velvet red.
“Fuck, you make me so happy, you have no idea,” Draco sighs and grabs Harry’s face with both of his hands. He presses his lips on top of Harry’s and kisses him fiercely. Harry feels like he’s falling, and it worries him just a little.
“Guys!” Dean and Blaise shout as they step closer to the couch. “We’re playing Truth or Dare. Come on, no one is backing out. Everybody has to play.”
Suddenly, the door opens again, and a bloke his age enters the bathroom. He’s tall, has bright blue eyes, and wears a chic black hoodie. Ginny would probably find him attractive, Harry guesses. Many people would probably find him attractive, but he's not really interested right now. He's tired and wants go be left alone.
“I don’t really understand you two”, Ron sighs. “You fuck for months, then you stop talking all of a sudden. And now you want to be just friends? Why don’t you fucking confess your feelings and finally get into a relationship?!”
When he gives his next history lecture about how the First World War developed, his eyes wander across the room. Beautiful green eyes stare back at him intensively from one of the seats in the back and Draco has to turn around in order to concentrate.
Harry decides not to argue with him about whose fault it is. That’s a dangerous topic to discuss and Harry doesn’t want to ruin the conversation. “You shouldn’t have to go through that.”
“Once a mother, always a mother”, she simply states. “I’ll see you at your flat in an hour. Send me the list, Draco!”
Harry’s hand travel lower, resting over the other man’s stomach. Then, he slides his hand into Draco’s boxers and begins to massage his cock slowly.
Draco only hums in response and continues. Then, the blonde man takes the showerhead again and begins to wash out the shampoo. Harry rolls his head back and gives Draco better access.
Harry forces himself not to stare at Draco’s sweaty, lean chest but it’s a struggle. He can clearly picture Draco as a Veela. It totally makes sense now. Draco always had those mesmerising eyes, the stunning smile, the perfect Platin hair and that amazing smell. Even when they were kids.
. Draco’s hair falls onto his forehead, his eyes are closed, his lashes throw shadows on his cheeks. Merlin, how long those lashes are! Harry has never noticed before how full and glossy Draco’s lips are. Fuck, he wants to bite them and taste them.
Harry joins him. He feels so light and carefree and happy. He never wants this feeling to stop. “I’m so happy.”
Draco eventually gives in and agrees. They head upstairs together and enter the bathroom. Draco gets out two little bottles with a green liquid inside.
Draco is about to lose his mind. It’s been three fucking weeks since Harry confessed his love to him. Three weeks since he’s been close to Harry. Since he’s touched Harry.
A mop of red hair runs past them. “Harry, Draco! Quick, in one minute it’ll be the new year! Get your cheeky little bums outside!”, Molly shouts as she rushes to the kitchen to grab some champagne.
“Fuck,” Harry pants. His back is arching. He feels the need to grab something to keep him distracted. There’s nothing to hold. Therefore, he grabs Draco’s bicep and claws his fingers into his delicate skin. “Draco. Please, do something.
Harry shrugs again as he shoves a cinnamon roll inside his mouth. “No. Nothing. I just really enjoy life right now.”
Harry nods and looks at the bathtub. Should he undress and get in the bathtub naked? Or should he keep his boxers on? How are they going to do this? He probably should’ve thought about that earlier, but when it comes to Draco, he can’t think straight.
And he’s so utterly fucked. How could this happen? Harry is a student, for Christ’s sake. Not a pizza delivery boy or a hairdresser at his favourite salon.
Harry watches him, unsure of how to reply. He’s still expecting Malfoy to fall back into old habits and start the insults and the fighting again, even though he knows that’s not going to happen.
The others watch Draco and Harry knowingly as if they know something Draco doesn’t. Which is probably the case, Draco thinks.
“I can’t concentrate when you are watching me,” Draco mumbles as he measures something Harry doesn’t recognize.
So when he sets up his laptop, turns on all the Equipment and opens the PowerPoint presentation, he forces himself not to look up and search the room for the raven haired man.
Draco smiles and holds out his hand for Harry to shake. Harry grabs it and shakes it. The moment Draco’s long fingers wrap themselves around Harry’s a tingling feeling sparks inside his chest and Harry can’t stop himself from smiling for the rest of the lesson.
“I know that you are, in fact, bisexual. A friend knows a friend who knows someone who hooked up with you,” he purrs.
Harry’s dick hasn’t received any attention whatsoever over the last few months. And it’s safe to say that the young wizard is slowly going insane. How is it possible that saving the wizarding world and being the most famous wizard would be such a cock block?
Harry shrugs his shoulders. "Um. I like how feminism is portrayed and wildly discussed in social media. I also like how celebrities promote feminism. Hmm. I also find females in politics interesting."
Harry puts in a second finger and works Draco open slowly. When he thinks Draco can take it, he adds a third finger. Judging by Draco’s moans, Draco is ready.
Harry hates how rough and desperate Draco’s voice sounds. He bites his lip and continues to fuck him with his fingers. He doesn’t really know what to say since he also doesn’t know how he survived without Draco. He never wants to live without him ever again.
The next morning, they are already much less awkward around each other than the last time. Draco accepts the fact that Harry doesn’t want to have breakfast. He gets dressed and hands Harry his clothes.
Harry watches Draco helplessly. He doesn’t really know the answer to most of these questions. “I don’t know. I’m not that specific.”
After ten minutes, he gets back into bed and sighs again. His mind is racing and he doesn’t feel tired at all. He wonders what else he could try when suddenly, there’s a knock on the door.
He feels panic building up inside of him. Oh, crap. This isn’t going to end well. He catches a glimpse of Draco, staring at his own hands. The boy seems lost in his thoughts. Harry feels like throwing up. Maybe he should, just so he could get the Veritaserum out of his body.
“Will you be a good boy for me Draco?”, Harry moans and bites Draco’s neck. “Moan my name, open your legs for me? Take all of me, scream for me? Tell me that you’re mine?”
Every other student at Hogwarts behaves like a mentally insane person around him. They don’t act normal and he seriously begins to hate it. It stresses him out. Why can’t he have one normal conversation with someone who isn’t one of his best friends?
Harry nods. “Yes. We never got to hang out. But we both want to. We want to put the past behind us and work on a normal, healthy relationship. Just friends being friends.”
Harry stares into warm, grey eyes and feels his self-control fade away. How could ever say no to Draco Malfoy? His enthusiasm is contagious. Draco is right. It’s a win-win situation.
He bites his lip and shakes his head. “I can’t. I really can’t. I – Fuck, I don’t know. I’m too scared.”
The holidays are actually rolling around much quicker than Harry had thought. The two weeks go by and Harry actually is starting to feel nervous now. Ever since realizing that he’s actually falling in love with Draco, he worries that Draco might actually realize it too. He might call Harry out on his bullshit or worse. He might be disgusted and angry with him and cancel their friendship.
Harry has to stop for a second. His head falls onto Draco’s shoulder, and he bites it, groaning. His dick is so hard, it’s actually painful now.
Draco feels sick to his stomach. He feels absolutely horrible. He tries to eat some of his pasta because he knows he needs to eat at least something but he really can't get anything down his throat anymore.
Harry gets up and turns on the TV. He mutes it and sits back down on the couch. “Okay, listen. Muggles have many electric devices that witches and wizards don’t know about.”
“You did?”, Harry asks softly and runs his hand through Draco’s soft hair. In the dark light of the room, his hair almost seems silver.
Draco nods. “Hm. I thought about staying here, just the two of us. But I already told Mother that I would be coming home. I guess it’s better that way anyway.”
Draco seems absolutely confused. “Okay. I’m not sure if I actually understand all of this, but I’ll just go with the flow.”
Harry also writes letters. Many, many letters. But no owl ever gets to see any of them. He burns them all before anyone can see them.
“Mhm. Really.” Draco mumbles. He stares at his shoes. “I also don’t care about anybody else. And I also hated kissing that guy. It was awful.” He watches Draco mesmerized. There’s a tiny voice inside his head, screaming not to step any closer. He will ruin everything between them.
Draco nods but presses his lips on top of Harry’s. He begins to kiss him softly. Harry can’t get enough of it. They continue to kiss, Draco still on top of Harry, who slowly starts to stroke Draco’s hips, legs, waist, and back with his hands. Draco has the softest skin he’s ever felt in his life.
Neville nods. “Yeah. We figured that out too. You both seemed to be very delusional with each other. I mean, the fact that you still think that Draco doesn’t like you back is insane to me. That boy would literally marry you on the spot if you asked him.”
Harry’s eyes snap up and he watches Draco through the mirror. This time, neither of them break the eye contact. Harry suddenly feels hot, and it’s getting harder to breathe.
“Fuck!” he moans as he comes inside Draco. It won’t stop. He’s coming and coming until he feels close to passing out. He squirts his cum inside Draco’s hole, slows down his movements. He has never come this hard in his entire life. He feels dizzy and breathless and so, so good. Harry continues to stroke Draco.
When Draco finally opens his eyes, it’s almost as if the whole world stops. There’s nothing else, just these beautiful, grey eyes staring back at him. Harry never wants this feeling to end. He wants to drown in it with Draco. He can’t help the burning desire for Draco that is raging rough his body. The most beautiful man Harry’s ever seen is standing right in front of him. Harry must be the luckiest man in the world.
After having another round of shots, they all apparate to London, but Harry doesn’t share his friends’ excitement. He feels his nerves build up inside of him. He desperately wants to see Malfoy, but he also doesn’t know what will happen, if Draco actually happens to be at the club. Will they make out? Or go even further? He doubts that Draco casually will carry two bottles of Armortentia with him. Maybe Draco will say “Hello Harry, nice to see you!” and turn around and dance with another bloke. They’re not dating. They’re not a thing. They haven't really spent any time together without the love potion clouding their brains. What if Draco is annoyed to see Harry at the club and snarls at him? Draco could totally do that because –
Harry shakes his head. “I’m serious. The sex is great, that’s all. I don’t even know him that well.”
He eventually starts to feel tired again. His eyes fall shut, and he drifts off into a more peaceful sleep.
Draco grabs a chair and forces Harry to sit down in front of the mirror. Harry can now see all of Draco. His blushed cheeks, his blonde curls, his grey eyes that seem vivid in the dim bathroom light. Draco looks so freaking beautiful. Harry bites his lip.
Draco desperately hopes that the trip comes about. He needs at least 10 students willing to participate and then he’s free to go. Otherwise, it's not worth going.
“Harry,” is all that comes out of Draco’s mouth. It sounds weak and broken, and Harry’s heart clenches. He never wants to hear Draco’s voice sound that vulnerable again. “God, Harry, I love you so much.”
Draco takes some oil and rubs it all over his aching cock. Then, he places himself on top of Harry. His left hand grabs Harry's waist, squeezing it tightly. Draco's certain it will leave dark bruises on Harry's delicate skin. The right hand guides his dick closer to Harry's entrance.
Draco barks out a loud laugh now. Harry giggles. “Who would’ve thought we would end up like this, huh? Fourteen-year-old me would throw a tantrum if he could see us right now.”
“I do care about you, Draco. I –“, Harry doesn’t want to give away too much. He sighs. “I like hanging out with you. I like talking to you. I’d like to think we’re actually friends now.”
Harry begins to move his head up and down and massages his balls at the same time. He’s painfully hard himself now.
Harry does. He gives everything he has left in himself. If he weren't in good shape from all the Quidditch Training, he wouldn’t have survived this.
For once, he’s actually looking forward to the New Year’s Eve Party tomorrow. He’ll get absolutely shit-faced and maybe he’ll even make out with some strange wizard. He’ll distract himself for the night. He’s not going to think about Draco.
Draco sighs. “And I’m in love with you, Harry. Madly, hopelessly in love. And I’ve never felt like this about anyone before. I was scared, I was running away. I was stupid, okay? And I’m so sorry. But I fell so hard for you, I can’t live without you now.”
Draco hides his face behind his hands now. Harry grabs them and pushes them away, laughing. “You’ve got to be kidding me!”
“Harry, are you even listening? I said we’re going inside now!”, Ron shouts and grabs Harry’s arm. Harry shakes his head in confusion and follows Ron.
“Draco”, Harry cries. His face scrunches up so much, Draco doesn’t know whether it’s pain or pleasure. “I’m so close, so close”
Harry doesn’t dare to open his eyes. He might ruin the magic of the moment. What if Draco suddenly realizes what they’re doing and disappears? What if Draco will be mad at Harry for luring him into this situation? His heart beats painfully in his chest, and he wishes he could mute his anxious thoughts.
“Okay”, Harry tries to distract himself. Don’t look at him! Do not look at him! “Let me just do that real quick.”
“Harry”, he screams as he comes inside him, his fingers rubbing Harry's delicate skin, making up for the roughness from before. He feels dizzy and breathless and
Harry nods and simply watches Draco undress in trance. God, that man is beautiful. And Draco said he hasn’t transformed into a Veela yet. How gorgeous must Draco be once he’s fully transitioned?
He can feel tears forming in his eyes at the sensation. He needs Harry so much closer, needs to feel his body on his, needs his skin on his.
When they get on their gondola, Hermione and the others quickly walk to the other end to snap some pictures, leaving Harry and Draco to themselves.
the Amortentia. I hated not talking to you over the past few weeks. We can’t go back to not talking.”
Harry’s heart drops to the floor. He drops onto the sofa and stares at his hands. Fuck, he ruined everything between them! He shouldn’t have made a move. Draco wasn’t ready. But he told him he loved him! That must mean something, right?
How could this get so far? Draco doesn’t even recognise himself anymore. He’s so passionate about his job, he can’t risk his position.
“I knew that this would happen. I knew right from the very start that I could never keep it casual between us. I found you so attractive and fascinating. I had the opportunity to get to know you and I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t resist. I should’ve been honest with you. That wasn’t fair. I pretended I didn’t fancy you because I was trying to play it cool. I agreed on all these things, despite knowing that it never would’ve worked outright.”
"I love you, Draco Malfoy. I've loved you since I first laid my eyes on you. You make me the happiest man on this planet. Don't be sorry about a couple of bruises.
“One is the shampoo. It’s supposed to clean your scalp without making it dry or frizzy. The other is a conditioner. This smoothes the hair and makes it soft.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Harry jumps out of the bed, rushing to the bathroom and reaching for his glasses. He doesn’t even remember putting them down yesterday. Then, he hurries to his bedroom and grabs a jumper and a pair of sweatpants. He gets dressed as quickly as he can manage and almost runs downstairs, tripping on the stairs.
through them. He can touch his butt, he grabs both of Harry’s cheeks and makes the boy moan into his mouth.
Harry gets tired during the day since he hasn’t slept all night. At some point, Draco sits down on the floor and conjures some painting paper, brushes, and paint. Harry watches him from the couch with huge interest. They don’t speak, the TV runs in the background and fills the room with soft noises.
Oh no. Harry's eyes open wide and he blushes faintly. He looks over at Hermione and presses his lips together in a tight line. She simply gives him an encouraging nod. Having no choice, Harry slowly gets up from his seat and walks over to Malfoy's table.
Hermione sighs and runs a hand through her curly hair. “Harry! He probably thinks that you don’t love him back.”
“Anyway,” Harry continues. “I’m starting to really like him. But I don’t even know him that well. I’ve never actually spent time with him while we were sober. And I also know that he doesn’t like me that way. He literally told me ‘no strings attached.’ He doesn’t even find me attractive.”
“Potter shut the hell up. I don’t need butterflies and roses. Just give it to me already. You should know that by now. Rough and hard, remember?”
Naturally, he asks Draco what to do a week before everyone is supposed to leave, after they’ve just shagged their brains out.
Why would Harry stop? He wishes he could do this for the rest of his life. Being with Draco, seeing him like this, feels so fucking right. There’s nothing in this world that makes him feel better. He feels like he’s supposed to be right here, with Malfoy.
. He tells himself he organises something great for the students because he wants to share his knowledge and give them the opportunity to experience history in a different way.
Draco waits a couple of seconds before replying. He licks his lips. Then, he blinks. “No. I don’t find you attractive.”
Harry sighs. “I just really miss him, Nev. I didn’t think I would actually miss him. I didn’t even realize I was in it so deeply. I just pushed it all away, I didn’t want to think about any of it. And now it comes crashing down on me.”
“Yes, Potter. You are.” Draco jumps up and begins to walk through the room. “We could brew Armortentia. It would make us believe that we are crazily attracted to each other. We could fuck and release some pressure. And then we can go back to normal.”
“Well, I wasn’t. I will be after this. Or not, I don’t freaking know. God, it’s too hot in here. I can’t think straight. My skin is burning”, Draco cries and actual tears are rolling down his cheeks.
Harry bites his lip. Ah, fuck it. “I find you physically attractive, yes. I always thought you were good looking, to be completely honest.”
But then, Draco looks up and the way he stares right back at Harry takes his breath away. His grey eyes sparkle in the dim light of the club, his lips seem plush and glossy, his cheeks are rosy pink and his hair is a mess. Harry has never seen anyone more beautiful than Draco. He shouldn’t do it. But the moment Draco licks his lips, that’s when Harry surges forward. He grabs Draco’s waist and pushes him against the wall, presses his lips on top of his and begins to kiss him passionately.
Harry shrugs. “I’m interested in history. And I have to visit a lecture in a different major, it’s obligatory.”
His eyes are filled with something that Draco can’t quite read. “Even though you're not on the same page as me: Thanks for last night. It meant a lot to me.”
Draco grins. His usually perfectly styled hair looks messy for once as if he had run his fingers through it multiple times.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry shakes his head. “No, trust me. Let’s just start watching a movie and you’ll see what I mean.”
“I want to know more about Muggles”, Draco hums. “And I asked Hermione what kind of books they are reading. She said there are many genres, but she loves this classic book called ‘A Christmas Carol’ by Charles Dickens. So, I’m reading that.”
Draco rolls his eyes. "I am not head over heels for him. I've just met him, for god's sake. I don't even know him. He's probably a complete psychopath waiting to murder me."
There’s a tiny blush on Draco’s cheeks, but it might just be the cold air. “I heard you guys talk. I didn’t know you were bisexual. I wasn't eavesdropping or anything. But for a very short moment, I thought you’d consider getting with him, so I didn’t want to interfere right away, and you know – I didn’t want to be a cock block so I waited.”
Draco huffs out a dry laugh. “Potter! Shove your arse inside my dick, please. I think it’s obvious how much I want it.”
What if things didn't work out between him and Harry? He would have risked it all for a student! Could he get fired for this?
Draco chuckles. “Harry Grandpa Potter, huh? Can’t keep up with me. You’re just too slow. I always knew it.”
Harry’s head spins, and he feels lightheaded. Fuck. This must be the happiest day of his life. He feels so bubbly and excited and happy, he can’t form one proper sentence. And he definitely doesn't want to talk now. Instead of talking, he surges forward. He grabs Draco’s face with both of his hands and presses his lips on top of his. Harry finally feels complete again. God, he loves Draco. So much. He sighs into the kiss.
Harry nods and gets up. Just as opens the door, he turns around one more time. He sounds incredibly sincere. "You're really amazing, Draco. See you on Tuesday."
“I haven’t gotten laid in ages, man. How would I find someone here in Hogwarts anyway? You’ve seen the way people act around me. It’s insane.”
Draco feels so stupid for being that much upset but he can’t help it. The thing is, he misses having Harry around. He
Feeling proud and confident, he walks into the lecture hall next Tuesday and waits for the students to come in. He sees the boy entering the hall and gives him a timid smile. Draco feels giddy inside when the boy returns the smile and sits down.
He knows right away what the guy wants from him. It’s not the first time it has happened. And even though Harry is horny, he isn’t in the mood right now. And he’s definitely not the kind of guy to do sexy stuff in a dirty bathroom.
He falls down on his seat with a sigh, getting his book out and checking the train for all the students one more time. He nods proudly when he counts all thirty.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
But now, he actually feels ready to commit. To fall in love. To actually be with someone. And for some stupid reason, he had hoped that Hogwarts might give him just that. But oh boy, Harry was so wrong. Harry has never felt more uncomfortable and out of place in his entire life. Harry painfully accepts that the other students either adore him or they are terrified of him which makes living at Hogwarts very difficult for him. It's a horrible situation. The only people he can talk to are his friends and a few of his classmates.
Draco wants to say something but Neville interrupts him. “Shut up. He knows you’re not ready for more. You’re using that stupid excuse of being his professor for avoiding the real stuff - which is love. If you’d be completely honest with yourself you’d realise that you’re in love with him too. Have been since day one.”
Only a couple hours later, he jumps up. He doesn’t know what the dream was about, but he’s sweaty, his heart is beating as if he had run a marathon, his breathing is ragged, and he doesn’t know where he is. The nightmares still come and go once in a while. Even if it had gotten better, the past always tends to hunt him.
Draco rolls over and smiles brightly at Harry. His eyes sparkle, his cheeks are rosy, and his dimples are showing. Harry’s heart flutters at the sight of that, and he reaches out for Draco, presses his lips on top of his, and pulls him into a tight hug.
Harry sighs. He shouldn’t say anything else. He should shut his stupid mouth. He will absolutely regret this once he’s sober. “Yes. Really. I don’t care about anybody else.”
Harry shakes himself, shaking those thoughts of Draco's hands on his body off his mind, far far away.
That is until he’s giving the first lecture of the semester about the First World War and its reasons. He’s busy talking and explaining and showing his students a few videos. He even answers a couple of questions which makes him feel very proud. Draco never feels happier. He loves teaching, he loves talking about things that matter such as history.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
„The age isn’t the problem, Neville“, Draco argues and turns off the oven. In an effortless move, he takes out the self-made lasagna. „The problem is that he’s my
"You don't know what you're doing to me", Harry whispers as his hands run all over Draco's sides. "You're so fucking hot, I can't think straight."
Draco smiles and feels warm and fluffy inside. "I'm glad I could help. If you have any questions feel free to ask."
With that, Harry turns around and walks up to his friends, talking to them and probably telling them what an arsehole Draco is and how much he hates him.
Harry shakes his head and points to Ron, who waves awkwardly. “Oh, I’m not alone. I’m here with my friend.”
Harry smiles at him. Not one of his fake smiles, the kind of smile that he flashes around a lot lately. The genuine smile, only reserved for special occasions. “Yeah. I agree. I was afraid that it would be weird.”
Harry continues to watch him until his eyes are closing and he eventually falls asleep on the couch.
He takes the bottle and gulps it down in one take. Last time, he was nervous because he didn’t know what was expecting him. Now that he knows, he’s confident, and he can’t wait. Draco drinks the bottle and puts it back on the table.
Harry doesn’t need to lookup. He knows who it is. The raven-haired man squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head. He doesn’t answer. He wishes Draco would disappear again.
But it drives Draco absolutely fucking nuts. He needs to see Harry. He needs to talk to him, needs to feel him, needs to see his smile, needs to wrap his arms around him.
He watches the others set up the big tent in the garden. Charlie prepares the music, Luna handcrafts some decoration, and Ginny sends out the last invitations. Harry sighs and walks up to his room to take a nap.
“Draco, I’m telling you. I didn’t care about him. I was looking for you. Fuck, the only reason why I’m here is the fact that Ron told me you would be here. Otherwise, I would’ve stayed at home.”
A warm hand wraps itself around Harry’s arm. It’s very soft and gentle, and it immediately soothes him.
“Just go with the flow. You don’t have to go on a date with him. Talking after lectures is perfectly fine, just see where it goes from there.”
Harry shrugs. “Maybe. But I’ve spent Christmas with them for years now. I don’t think they’ll be angry with me.”
"Hm. Well. Maybe Mr Malfoy can help you catch up on today's potion. You haven't even started brewing yet and Mr Malfoy seems to be half finished."
Harry grins and adds another finger, and Draco spreads his legs further apart, his hips trembling as Harry stretches him open with his fingers.
Draco wraps his free arm around Harry and pulls him even closer to his chest. “Fuck, Harry, you look so fucking good, you have no idea.”
"I'm going to cum if you keep doing this", Harry groans as he rolls his hips in sync with Draco's tongue.
“Merry Christmas, Harry”, Draco says, moves forward, and places a soft kiss to his cheek. Then, he turns around, away from Harry.
Suddenly, Harry hears a little squeak close to his foot. Harry looks down, looking for anything that could’ve made that sound. Then, something tiny hits the left side of his foot. Harry frowns and takes a closer look. And there, hidden behind his bag, sits a little mouse looking up at him with huge, terrified eyes.
Harry hands Draco a Christmas Star made of glass. Draco watches him in confusion. “What am I supposed to do with his?”
Harry feels a painful sting at this comment. Draco is probably right, but something inside of him doesn’t want to believe that. There’s something
“You seriously asked me if I care about you?”, he shouts suddenly angry at himself. “Hell yes. More than I’ve ever cared about anyone.”
Harry shrugs. They’ve agreed that they’re on friendly, totally not weird, speaking terms now, but it’s still strange to talk to Malfoy in a friendly, neutral way. But Harry really wants to make an effort with him. He wants to give him a chance. They're not kids anymore. That’s why Harry tries to open up.
All he can think of is the way Draco had kissed him back. The way Draco had moaned Harry’s name. The way he had confessed his love to him. Harry’s brain feels fuzzy. He needs to distract himself.
“Are you insane? That is actually incredible. You know how much I struggle with my hair. Always have. I have no clue what to do with it.”
Harry nods. He feels as if he destroyed something between them, but he doesn’t know what that is. “Malfoy, wait.”
Harry hums in agreement. For a split second, he considers asking Draco if he wants to stay with him at Hogwarts. Just the two of them. But then, he bites his tongue and swallows the question.
He likes reading student's work, especially if the work is good. He's read an amazing essay from a student called Hermione Granger.
Harry looks at him. Draco lays on the couch, shoes plopped up on the table in front of him. He seems very relaxed, which is a rare occasion. Draco looks handso - Harry stops himself from finishing that thought.
He looks around. Everyone seems to be teamed up already. Neville is working with Luna, Dean is working with Seamus. He sighs. Merlin. He hates teamwork.
Fuck it, Harry decides. He’s so painfully hard. He needs Draco, and he already got his permission anyway. He pushes in without any warning, without being careful. He slides in all the way.
Draco sighs desperately as he puts down a plate with olives on the table. “He’s a freaking student, Nev. It‘s so freaking unprofessional to even think about him.“
Even though Draco and Harry aren’t enemies anymore, they’ve left all of their rivalry with the war, they aren’t exactly friends either. A nod here and there, a quiet “hello” when they walk past each other, a “could you hand me the book, please” once in a while, staring at each other when the other isn’t looking and that’s about it.
Harry swallows the liquid and coughs, fights for air but doesn’t win since the whiskey has burnt its way down his throat. He needs a moment to collect himself, then he shifts in his seat uncomfortably. He feels weird discussing sex with Malfoy. He doesn’t even talk about sex with his friends.
If Harry were in pain and Draco Malfoy offered his help declaring he would not leave his side, Harry would feel embarrassed and awkward too.
The next week is long and nerve-wracking. School is taking a toll on him. He doesn’t eat much, he sleeps a lot, and he basically hides away from the world. Since he’s trying to avoid as many fan-encounters as possible, he spends a lot of time by himself. He doesn’t really feel like hanging out with his friends anyway.
"A Chai Latte for Draco!", a young woman shouts causing Harry's head to snap up and his eyes sparkle in excitement.
It’s passionate, hot, and incredibly sexy. Harry doesn’t ever want to stop. His fingers are tingling when he touches Draco. His entire body feels as if it’s on fire. Draco kisses him back and begins to roll his hips.
Harry turns around and watches Draco. “I can’t really cook that well. When I lived with my aunt and my uncle, I always had to help my aunt in the kitchen. She forced me to cut veggies, roast meat, bake things for her. It was actually quite helpful.”
When the gondola ride is finally done and they all meet up in front of the London eye, Draco feels like crying. He just wants to get home and sleep and never, ever
Draco walks up to the door. Harry doesn’t want him to leave just yet. “Is everything cool between us?”
Harry forces himself not to look up from his book and look over at Malfoy for the hundredth of time for today's lesson. It surprises him that no-one else has noticed yet. Or maybe they have and they simply kept it to themselves.
Draco grabs Harry's hand and leads him into his big bathroom. It has a huge bathtub on the left and Draco walks over to it, turns on the water and tells Harry to dim the light.
“We never actually hung out. We always met up just for sex. And then, we were always … intoxicated.”
Draco bites his lip and watches Harry carefully. He doesn’t know where this is going. “I don’t know. Whatever this is between us.”
Harry only hums in pleasure and moves his hand up and down. Draco helps him and wraps his own hand around Harry’s dick, making the younger man moan desperately.
Draco presses his lips together to hide his smile. Neville would probably roll his eyes at Draco if he were here.
“He behaved like that because you were flirting with that guy, Harry. Do I need to spell it out for you?”
Harry doesn’t dare to ask the others if it’s actually certain that Draco will attend this Halloween party. He doesn’t want to embarrass himself. But if there’s even a tiny chance of seeing Draco again, he will take it. It’s pathetic. Harry forces himself not to think about it.
“I saw people staring at you and heard them talk about you. I noticed that you felt uncomfortable, so I followed you into the bathroom to see if you're alright, but the other dude was quicker.”
Draco stares at his hands, he suddenly seems unsure and nervous. Harry waits for him to speak up. “I – um. I could just stay here, you know. Don’t wanna get up and move again.”
After five minutes of cleaning, he feels a lot better already. He gets out his phone and texts his mum a list of things he needs from the grocery store. Then, he grabs his coat and his bag and exits the office, locking the door right after him.
The moment the love potion begins to have an effect, he lunges forward. He grabs Draco’s face, presses his lips on top of his, and guides him to the bed. Draco lets it all happen. He kisses him back, grabs Harry’s waist, and pulls him closer. They let themselves fall on top of the bed and into the sheets.
Ginny reaches out for the bottle and spins it again. The moment the bottle stops, it lands on Harry, and he nervously holds his breath. “Truth or Dare?”
Ron sighs and runs a hand through his red strands. “Merlin, Harry. I don’t really know what to say. I’ve been watching you and Draco for the past few months and it’s almost like watching two cars crashing into each other. I keep waiting for this whole thing to blow up in your faces.”
“It simply would be practical if we were into each other. Because then, we could help each other out. We both want to get laid but we can't as long as we're stuck in Hogwarts.”
He frowns when an attractive boy with chocolate like skin and a black short afro sits down next to Harry and throws an arm around him.
“I haven’t felt this peaceful and happy in a really long time,” Harry eventually admits. He squeezes Draco.
He doesn’t have to search. The moment he looks up and faces the students, his eyes land on Harry in the third row, right up front. Draco stares at him surprised for a minute.
“It was terrible, Neville!”, Draco cries. He’s actually crying. “The entire train ride he wouldn’t look at me. He just listened to music and kept staring out of the window as if he hadn’t just confessed his love to me.”
Harry smiles and opens his arms for Draco. The blonde man happily cuddles into Harry’s body, wrapping his arms around his torso and resting his head on Harry’s chest. Harry begins to stroke Draco’s messy hair.
Harry contemplates for a second. Should he really drink with Draco Malfoy? But then again, why shouldn’t he? “Yeah. Why not.”
Then, he stares at it, unsure what to do with it. “I’m sorry, Harry. The lemon cake was easy to understand. But what exactly is this?”
He smiles when she waves at him hesitantly and rushes to her boyfriend, a student with bright red hair. Draco notices Harry talking to them both, making them laugh and Hermione gently slaps Harry’s shoulder.
Harry squeezes his bum and groans, his hands grabbing the sheets. It's a sinful sight. Draco leans down and presses kisses on Harry's back, starting on the top between his shoulders and making his way down south to the curve where Harry's spine meets his arse.
“Oh,” Harry states. His heart does not react to this. At all. It’s totally fine. He’s – yeah. “Okay.”
Harry watches him closely and probably notices Draco’s wet hair and soaked clothes. His eyes turn a shade darker and he licks his lips. “Right.”
Neville rolls his eyes and gets up. “I’ll get some ice cream now. But stop crying, you literally put yourself into this situation. This is all your own fault.”
He certainly doesn’t feel like the upper hand. Especially not, when Harry is wearing a black jumper that slightly goes up when he stretches and shows the softest skin on his stomach.
Harry bites his lip and breathes out. He wants to enjoy this as much as possible. It’s been almost two months since he last felt Draco’s hands on his skin and it shouldn’t feel this fantastic, but he can’t help it. He loves Draco’s hands on his body, he craves it so much that it physically hurts his body.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco pushes Harry off of him gently and Harry rolls onto his back. Now, Draco lying on his side next to him, the blonde man watches him curiously.
Ginny jumps up and disappears up the stairs for a minute. She returns with a backpack and sits back down on the floor. Then, she gets out four bottles of fire whiskey.
But even if Harry was the love of his life - could Draco jump over his own shadow? Could he let go of the fear and the thoughts telling him that this is wrong? Telling him to stop this immediately?
Then, Harry places himself in front of Draco’s entrance and teases him with the tip of his dick. He lets it slide across Draco’s entrance a couple of times without actually pushing in.
Draco smiles and moves closer to Harry. Together, they step into the big bathtub, letting the water warm them both. Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s torso from behind and begins kissing his neck. “I’d do anything for you.”
“That boy is madly in love with you. He literally told you. And he also said, “call me when you’re ready for more”. That means he doesn’t hate you, it shows that he knows you really well.”
“Yeah, see you on Tuesday”, Draco dumbly answers and waves awkwardly. How is he an academically respected professor? He can't even hold a normal conversation with a student.
“Harry!”, he sighs, reaching for Harry’s arms, shoulders, anything. He seems desperate for more. “Please, please! Do something, oh god.”
Harry’s head snaps up. Draco Malfoy is a Veela? How did he not know that? Why does it even matter? Why does it change anything? Why is that confession doing things to his cock?
It becomes a habit. Draco gives his lecture and tries to ignore Harry as best as he can so he doesn’t get distracted.
Neville gives him a knowing smirk. "You're head over heels for that boy, you do realize that, right?"
They simply don’t have that kind of relationship where they carry one another to the hospital when in need. They haven’t even had a proper, normal conversation in all these years they’ve known each other. The past lesson filled with awkward accidental touching just proved that.
Harry is still unsure. He doesn’t know what to do. Hogwarts is his home, after all. And he doesn’t want to allow the war to take over his precious Halloween feast. He used to love Halloween at Hogwarts. But he also doesn’t want his friends to spend Halloween without him.
Harry lets his bag drop to the floor and rushes towards Draco. “I was so hoping for you to say that.”
Harry stares at him with wide eyes. He’s not shirtless anymore, he’s wearing a black shirt and grey joggers. Draco now clearly sees the shadows under his red eyes and how his face seems worried and dull.
Draco’s confused during the first ten minutes. But then, he gets the hang of it. He stares at the screen in utter fascination and admiration and every time Harry tries to say something, Draco punches his arm.
Harry nods and gets up. He walks past Draco and accidentally (or not so accidentally) brushes Draco's waist. Draco jumps three feet in the air and squeezes his eyes shut tightly. His entire body tenses.
Harry bites his lip and ignores that comment. He doesn’t fancy Draco, ok? Like, not at all. But he’s interested in him as a person. They’ve been enemies for so long, and maybe it’s time to put that all aside and start fresh. And if that means fucking their brains out, he’s okay with that. Because Draco smells amazing, he has an incredible body, the softest hair Harry has ever touched, and a lovely smile. He brings him breakfast and he knows how to push Harry’s buttons. Merlin. Harry needs to stop thinking
Harry wants to hug Draco. Merlin, he really wants to reach out and give Draco a tight hug, make him feel loved and cherished, and never let go. He clears his throat. Don't cross the line, Harry. “Okay, well. Then this is a Christmas Holiday filled with firsts. Let’s decorate a Christmas tree for the first time!”
They all seem to agree and settle down in front of the chimney. Harry looks around. Ron, Neville, Ginny, Hermione, Dean, and Seamus are all gathered around him. He feels a tightness in his chest and doesn’t quite know if it’s a good or a bad feeling – maybe a mix of both.
“Where the fuck have you been?” Draco shouts, all his emotions building up inside of him. “You haven’t been to any of my lectures in a month! A fucking month!”
When they head over to lunch, Harry feels a little bubble of excitement inside of him. He wants to see Draco. Hell, he wants to talk to him. But he can’t even explain what it is. They’re not friends, and they’re definitely not dating either. It’s nothing. A one-time thing. Right?
Malfoy grunts. “What the fuck? You really are the definition of a Precious Golden Boy. What about abs? What about eyes, hair color? Nothing?”
He shuffles closer to him and places his hand on Draco’s waist. Draco doesn’t move. Harry doesn’t pull back, nor does he move any closer. He stays exactly where he is, his poor heart struggling to keep up.
Harry doesn’t really understand what he means, but he’s too tired to ask. He wraps his arms around Draco’s petite body, presses a kiss on his forehead, and then falls asleep.
He presses a kiss down onto Draco’s shoulder, bites him, and sucks. He wants to leave marks all over Draco’s body. But right now, he wants to fuck him. Harry places himself in front of Draco’s entrance and teases him with the tip of his cock. He lets it slide across Draco’s entrance a couple of times without actually pushing in.
Harry grins. He clearly doesn’t think, when he reaches out to touch Draco’s hair and runs his fingers through his locks. “I can’t believe how soft your hair feels despite looking like a bird's nest right now.”
A huge, genuine, happy smile stretches across Harry’s face. He feels dizzy and lightheaded, he wants to kiss Malfoy and dance, and sing, and hug the world.
He doesn’t dare to move and wishes it could stay like this forever. He sighs happily and presses a soft kiss to Draco’s forehead.
Draco pulls Harry closer and presses kisses all over his face. "I love you, too. Thank god you're mine."
“The people adore you, Harry. All you have to do is choose. I literally don’t have anyone to choose from.”
Harry presses another kiss onto Draco’s neck, and then, without any warning, he pushes in all the way. He swears he sees stars at the sensation of being inside Draco’s tight arse. It has never felt so fucking good. He’s close to passing out, just from being inside Draco. He can’t concentrate on anything else.
Harry clears his throat and focuses on the box of DVDs on the floor. He rummages through them and eventually finds Disney’s “Lady and the Tramp”.
They stare at each other for a moment, until they both surge forward and press their lips onto each other. It’s sweet, it’s passionate and it’s nothing like the rushed heat between them just moments ago. This is calm, collected, meaningful, intense.
Draco chooses to ignore the boy. He doesn’t look up as he grabs his belongings, he doesn’t search the room for messy black hair, he doesn’t feel tense when he walks past him and he
“I love any cake”, Harry admits. “I really don’t have a favorite. I like cheesecake, chocolate cake, strawberry cheesecake, lemon cake, marble cake. I’ll take anything.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry turns his head around and watches Draco surprised. The other boy is bright red. “What? Are you shy talking about bottoming?
He listens to Draco’s steady heartbeat, feels every part of Draco’s skin. He swallows the moment and never wants it to stop.
But all of that goes to waste when he sees Harry walking out of the door into the pouring rain. It’s already dark, so he can’t see his face but Draco is certain it’s Harry.
Harry doesn’t know himself. He simply doesn’t want to sit still for another hour. He needs some sort of release. He needs Draco, to be exact. He misses Draco. The weekly meetings with him simply aren’t enough anymore. Harry wishes he could see him every single day.
Harry forces himself to calm down as he walks down the stairs. He immediately smiles when his eyes land on Draco, who’s waiting for him in the Entrance Hall with his luggage.
And when they finally return to their friends, they’re already drunk and dancing to a remix of Travis Scott, not really caring about Draco and Harry.
Then, he turns around and almost runs away, straight towards the terrace. Maybe he can borrow a cigarette from someone. The moment he steps outside, he feels less like throwing up. Merlin, that was a horrible idea. Why did he do that? He takes a couple of breaths and tries to calm his spinning head. He already feels a little calmer. God, he shouldn’t have drunk this much. The alcohol really hits him now and he sees everything in a blur. He wipes his mouth and actually feels sick to his stomach. He shouldn’t have kissed this Lucas guy. It was a stupid reaction. He felt so jealous and hurt seeing Draco kiss somebody else, even though he has no right to feel that way. Draco didn’t do anything wrong. Harry knows that. But still.
“Us. Where we’re standing. I mean, we obviously don’t need a love potion to fuck anymore. That incident at the club proofed it. And I don’t really know what that means.”
Draco runs a hand through his wet hair. “I couldn’t think straight. I have never missed anyone in my life as much as I have missed you. I need you, Harry. I need your smile, and your eyes, and your smell, and your body wrapped closely around mine. I need
Draco shrugs. Then, he smiles. “Yeah, I guess. But I do miss fighting with you sometimes. It was so damn easy to rile you up. It was entertaining.”
“Oh God,” Harry moans. If he could stop time, he would. This feeling with Draco, being with Draco, gives him this spark of joy that he never wants to miss ever again. “Fuck, Draco!”
He walks to the Quidditch field, not really having a destination planned in his head. He simply enjoys the cold, fresh air and the quiet surrounding him.
Draco takes the knife and tries to follow Harry’s instructions. Every now and then, Harry places his hand over Draco’s to apply more pressure on the knife. He can feel Draco tense every time their fingers touch. Harry tries to focus on anything else than Draco's presence and his incredibly delicious smell.
"And why is it complicated?", she smiles. "Does he have a boyfriend? Is he straight? Is he not interested in you?"
Draco shakes his head. “Well. Thank Merlin that you’re the Golden Boy, huh? The Boy Who Lived. The boy who saved the wizarding world. People literally see stars when they look at you. Must be nice.”
“Have you already done the transfiguration assignment?” Harry obviously tries to change the topic because he doesn’t want to talk about this thing with Draco. It’s all going in a great direction. He doesn’t want to overthink it. All he wants is to enjoy the moment.
Draco groans. Great, now the boy knows his first name. No student has ever known his first name, it's something Draco likes to keep private.
Draco feels sick to his stomach. He wishes he could just disappear and never come back. A thousand thoughts run through his head but he just can’t seem to make sense of any of them. He’s so confused, hurt, anxious, and angry at himself.
Harry closes his eyes, holds on to Draco’s hips, and slowly, very slowly, slides inside. He’s so tight, Harry might actually faint. Fuck, how much better Sex feels when he’s sober. He can feel everything about Draco. He groans. Harry rocks slowly inside of him, slowly building up a rhythm.
“Muggles watch TV, because it’s amusing to watch. As I said, it’s almost like reading a book. But it’s much easier and faster because you see everything in vivid images and colors and sounds in front of you.”
This time, it’s Draco who surges forward. He surprises Harry by pressing his lips on top of Harry’s and by kissing him passionately. Harry lets it happen. He enjoys letting go and allowing Draco to take the lead for once. It’s exactly what his nervous mind and tense body need right now. He sighs into Draco’s mouth and melts like butter in Draco’s firm hands.
Draco now does look up. He stares right back at Harry, trying to figure out where this is going. “Thirty-one. Why?”
Harry presses his lips together. He hates it when they are so straight forward. It makes him feel incredibly uncomfortable. “No, I’m good. Thank you.”
Draco watches him confused, then his eyes light up in recognition. “Oh. You’re not wearing your glasses!”
"Hmmm. I like your name. Draco. That's really special", Harry says after Draco comes back from getting his Chai Latte. "Anyway, it was nice to meet you here. See you on Tuesday!"
Tears are forming in Draco’s eyes, slowly rolling down his cheeks. Harry stretches his neck and kisses Draco’s throat.
“Urgh. It’s a muggle thing. Doesn’t matter right now. Why would you kiss someone just because some random guy started flirting with me? I didn’t even care about him, I was looking for you!”
He collapses on top of Draco and lets his head rest on his shoulder. He’s breathing heavily. “Wow. I fucking love this.”
With a wink, Harry turns back around, walks out of the office and leaves Draco feeling hot and flustered and bothered.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco tries to speak but the pain enables him to do so. After a while, he manages to speak up. “They told me - fuck- to find anyone willing to shag me and get it over with.”
“Yeah, I’m doing it the muggle way. With a knife and a cutting board.” Harry bites back a laugh at Draco’s fascinated expression. He looks as if he’s never seen a knife and a zucchini before.
“We were all guessing it was Draco because you both changed your behavior around the same time. We’re friends with Blaise and Pansy now, you know? And they noticed Draco changing too. He seemed happier and more relaxed.”
Draco can’t sleep. The events of the night repeatedly play inside his head like a movie that starts again and again every time it’s finished.
He doesn’t know if his eyes trick him but he could swear he can see a light blush on Harry’s cheeks. “Twenty four.”
He watches Harry get out of the car and waits until the boy opens the door. Then, Harry turns around one more time and waves at him.
And after hooking up at that club, Harry can’t help but think: What if? What if Draco feels the same way? What if Harry and Draco actually have a chance? What if this isn’t just sex and love potions and no strings attached?
Harry sighs and decides to switch the topic for now. “Anyway. I didn’t want to hide anything from you. I just genuinely didn’t notice it myself”, Harry eventually admits.
They sit in silence, both staring outside and watching the ocean. It’s nice weather today. The sun is shining, which makes it seem like summer, even though it’s probably freezing cold outside.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco is smart, he hands out the tickets and makes sure not to be seated next to Harry. He wouldn’t survive three hours next to the boy.
“And I’m angry because I know you feel something too. But you’re too stubborn and stuck up to actually confess to it. Or maybe you're scared, I don't know. Fact is,
Harry feels exhausted all of a sudden. This whole conversation blew his mind, and he feels absolutely lost.
Draco nods and sits down at the table, Harry sits next to him. He watches the blonde man open the present carefully.
"I'm sorry, honey, but I just had to tell him this!", Neville explains and winks at Harry with a knowing smirk.
Harry smiles fondly at him. "It's far from being messed up, Draco. You're making it a lot more complicated than it needs to be."
Harry clinks their glasses and swallows the liquid in one go, never leaving Draco’s intense stare. He feels the power of the love potion run through his veins, clouding his brain, and taking away any sense of rational thinking. He takes a deep breath.
Harry looks at him confused. He decides not to ask any questions and just accepts Malfoy’s wish. “Okay, but what can I do? And don’t say I should leave. I’m not going anywhere!”
Harry doesn’t know whether he wants to cry, or smile, or hug him, or kiss him. He feels his heart beating faster and faster.
Friday evening rolls around and they’re all set to go to the theatre to watch Shakespeares “Romeo and Juliet”.
The wizard stops in the doorway and watches Draco. He’s standing in the middle of the room, eyes closed, hands covering his eyes, and he’s breathing heavily.
Harry doesn’t sleep well. He starts to feel anxious most of the time; he keeps dreaming about that night. He doesn’t eat regularly, and if his friends notice, luckily, they don’t comment on it. They know Harry well enough that something is up and that he will eventually talk about it when he’s ready.
Therefore, he decides that he’s going to let loose. If the boy is approaching him again, Draco will talk to him. He will have a casual conversation with him and then he can go on with his life.
Harry conjures some lube. Then his warm, slick finger presses at Draco’s entrance, circling around it.
“I suppose Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy are the last two without a partner. Alright, then. Since everyone is partnered up now, please sit with your partner and listen closely to the assignment.”
Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s torso. “Yes, you are. Now shut up, relax, and go back to sleep.”
Harry can’t remember a time when he felt so easy and relaxed around someone. He watches Draco prepare some water and paint. Then, he begins to paint the ocean. His hands run over the paper smoothly, holding the brush with concentration and skill. Harry looks at the scene in front of him in awe.
“Ronald!”, Hermione hisses and punches Ron in the stomach. “What Ron is trying to say is, we’re all worried about you. We don’t want you to get hurt.”
It’s stressing Harry out much more than he would ever admit. Just as he walks to his next class, he ducks his head down and tries to avoid as many students as possible. He even goes as far as pulling the hood of his cloak over his head. He rushes towards the greenhouses, hoping nobody will see him or talk to him, but suddenly, his shoulder bumps into a solid body. Harry’s head snaps up in surprise. Then, green eyes meet grey ones and his heart stops beating for a moment.
"Draco, honey, you're just looking for excuses not to get involved with someone. I love you, but you're being ridiculous."
Harry can’t hold himself back any longer. He slams into Draco full force, grabs his skin tightly and he’s sure there are going to be bruises tomorrow. “Draco! Fuck.”
“Remember when Ron thought he was in love with Lavender? He was crazy about her, all because that psycho bitch poisoned him with Armortentia. But he wasn’t even into her. It was the opposite – he hated her!” Harry suddenly giggles. He doesn’t know where that thought came from and why his brain suddenly brought that up. It left the conversation moments ago anyway.
The next few days at the Burrow sucks. Not because he doesn’t enjoy spending time with his best friends and family.
Harry turns around and sighs. There’s no way he’s going to fall asleep anytime soon, but it’s already three am. He can’t stop thinking about Draco, and how the other man is sleeping peacefully in the room next to him.
Harry shakes his head and shuffles closer, wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders. “No, it doesn’t. I get what you mean.”
Draco guides them to the bed and they both lay down. Harry snuggles into Draco’s chest as he wraps his arms around Harry and holds him close. This must be what pure bliss feels like.
Draco leans his head against Harry’s and smiles. “I’ve never really said that out loud. It makes me feel so dumb. But – I don’t know – I guess I’ve always struggled with wanting to be the tough, dominant guy and knowing that I’m the complete opposite.”
Draco answers immediately. “Because I was scared.” His eyes shoot open in horror. “Merlin, what the hell? Why am I telling you this?”
After a long walk at the beach, both cuddling into each other’s sides because it’s freaking cold outside, thank you very much, they fall on the couch and watch ‘Jim Carrey’s A Christmas Carol’ together.
Harry takes a deep breath, but the words come out so easily, Harry almost forgets about the Veritaserum. “I fell in love with you months ago, Draco.”
He watches Draco closely now and notices how pale the man suddenly seems to be. Draco only nods but it seems forced. "Yeah, I'm fine. Would you please hold my arm and keep it steady?"
Harry holds his breath for a moment. His heart is probably going to explode any minute now. “Merry Christmas, Draco.”
Harry feels his throat tingle. He wishes he could suppress what he’s going to say next, but he can’t. “I want to cry,” he replies.
Draco groans. Merlin, this is getting too much. "So impatient, bet you would beg for it, wouldn't you?"
Harry opens the door to the passenger seat of the car. Draco sits down and moves the seat all the way to the back. It’s more spacious than Draco had thought it would be.
Luna helps Harry style his hair. She slicks it back and holds it in place with a charm that Harry doesn’t even recognize.
Draco huffs and begins to take off his robes. “Because it’s none of your business, Merlin. This is just perfect, being stuck with Harry Potter during this.”
“Harry, you have no idea how fucking tight you are. It feels so good”, Draco moans. "Such a good boy, taking my cock and behaving so well."
He tries to stay quiet, but he’s not succeeding. His skin is burning, and he desperately needs to cum. Draco seems to notice how close Harry already is. Therefore, he lets go of Harry’s cock and kisses him passionately.
Draco frowns. He feels this weird feeling inside his stomach. It's not quite anxiety - it's nervousness, guilt, fear, a very bad feeling he can't describe. Before he can respond, Harry has left the room and closed the door.
Harry blushes and turns away. He also decides to get up and jumps out of bed. He grabs his clothes and starts to get dressed too.
Harry giggles at something the boy says and takes a bite off his food. Then, Harry leans on his shoulder and nuzzles his nose into the boy's neck.
Harry tilts his head. Yeah, Blaise probably is attractive. Harry has never really paid attention to him, though. He seems too arrogant and superficial.
Every time Harry catches a glimpse of Draco, the other man seems to be busy. He starts to walk the other way, or he begins chatting with his friends.
Harry is beautiful, no one would ever disagree with Draco. His eyes are glowing dark green, his hair is a wild chaos on top of his head, his jaw is sharp like a knife and his lashes throw a beautiful shadow on his high collarbones. The glasses make him look cute, younger, and softer.
In a swift motion, he throws the boxers away and then reaches for some oil standing on the bedside table.
This makes Harry moan even more. His dick is already so hard. He knows he’s not going to last much longer. “Fuck, Draco. I’m close.”
“I thought of your tummy, so toned yet so soft. I dreamed of biting your soft skin, licking it, and moving lower. I imagined myself sucking your cock and making you cum.”
Draco stares at the ground. His hands are trembling. “Because I ruined everything by falling in love.”
He continues to snap random pictures until he flips the camera and squeaks when he sees his own face. Harry laughs.
Therefore, Harry removes his mouth and conjures some lube into his hands. He strokes Draco’s back with his free hand as he enters one finger into Draco’s tight hole.
Then, all of a sudden, Draco turns around, rushes forward and throws his arms around Harry. He squeezes him tightly and burrows his nose in the space between Harry’s ear and his neck. “Thank you, Harry. Thank you so much.”
Draco presses his lips together. Then, he takes a deep, steadying breath. He squeezes his eyes shut and rushes the words out as if to get them over with as quickly as possible. “I fancy the shit out of you, Potter.”
And he definitely needs to clean his apartment. Hands shoved deeply into the pockets of his blue coat and cheeks hidden behind his Burberry scarf, he walks to the closest Starbucks and gets himself a Chai Latte. He waits paitently in line and already searches his pockets for his money when he feels an unexpected, sudden tap on his shoulder.
Draco grins. He conjures a second glass with a flick of his finger. Harry tries to hide his admiration for Draco’s magic skills. He always secretly had admired Draco for that. Instead, he grabs the glass and takes a big sip.
Harry barks out a laugh. "Oh no, no, no. You've got it all wrong. He's with Seamus. He's just a really good friend."
Harry nearly gets a heart attack and jumps up. His heart is racing, and the panic only slowly fades away.
Harry swallows and takes a deep breath. His head is spinning. For some strange reason, he feels his eyes prickle with tears. “I hated kissing him.”
“But we never really hung out without the love potion. So, do we really know each other? Urgh, I don’t know. This is all so complicated.”
Draco squeezes him tightly and buries his nose inside Harry’s neck. “You smell so fucking good. You have no idea.”
Then, his face goes blank and he suddenly gets very pale. "Oh shit. I'm not supposed to call you Draco. I'm so sorry."
He steps aside and allows Draco to take a look at the kitchen table. There are a freshly baked lemon cake and a small package next to it.
Draco notices Harry's presence way too clearly and even though he's soaking wet, he begins to feel hot all over his body.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry feels a shot of disappointment. But he nods. “Yeah. I guess you’re right. Besides, we don’t really need it anymore, anyway.”
Once all of his cum has left his cock and found it’s way into Draco’s arse, Draco’s entire body tenses. He starts to tremble, groans and moans and cries and grips both of Harry’s hands tightly.
Or they are terrified of him. They wouldn’t look twice at him because they don’t know how to act around the Oh-So-Famous-Mr-Potter. Some of them are actually running away the moment Harry walks past them. Or they squeak loudly and point at him as if he's a big attraction. It's insane.
He sets up his laptop, opens his presentation he has prepared to inform the students and gets out the printed sheets with all the information.
Harry nods and settles into the seat. They don’t talk since Draco feels way too tense and on the edge. The air around them is thick with tension, lust and unspoken words. Draco wishes he could disappear.
Harry continues to lick Draco’s tight hole, teasing him and making him feel good. Draco moans uncontrollably now and Harry only hopes that the room of requirement is soundproof.
“I always wanted one for my birthday. But I only ever ate lemon cake here at Hogwarts as a dessert.”
When the lesson is over, everyone jumps up, grabs their bags, and rushes out of the classroom. But Harry and Draco both linger on.
“Fuck,” Harry sighs. He won’t be able to resist any longer. He wants to touch this man so badly; his fingers are itching. His skin is burning.
"I'm right here, babe", Draco responds and begins to rub his hands all over Harry's body. "Not going anywhere."
Harry looks at him confused. “But I did. You were in so much pain and I took advantage of that. I shouldn’t have, but I just couldn’t - you know - um. Control me around you anymore? You know - ah fuck. I’m not made of steel and I couldn’t help it. It’s not my fault you’re bloody attractive.”
Draco only snorts, a few tears roll down his cheeks. He hisses, as a wave of pain must have shot through his body.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“What the hell? Draco, you've got to chill”, Neville says once he opens the door. “What’s up? You look like shit.”
A few more pushes. Harry can feel it. He’s already so freaking close. And when Draco moves his arm around Harry’s slim body and squeezes Harry’s ass, cups him, and holds his arse cheek tightly, Harry sees stars.
Ginny grins. She tilts her head and considers this for a moment. “I mean, I was in a relationship with Harry after all. Not for too long, but still. I’m sorry, Dean. My answer would have to be Harry.”
Draco nods. "That's great. Politics is always great to write about. You could analyze the differences between males and females in politics. Analyze their success, their popularity, what kind of criticism they get and for what they are being critizied. And then you can use Judith Butler to support your analysis."
Harry turns bright red. Luna giggles. The others whistle at him. Some even bark out a loud laugh. Oh, Merlin.
Therefore, on Sunday evening, he dresses up as a vampire. His costume looks absolutely ridiculous. He’s wearing black jeans, a black shirt, and a dark red cloak. He painted his face white and his lips red. Hermione helped him paint a few red dots on his chin. They’re supposed to resemble blood, but Harry doesn’t really see it. Luna, Dean, George, and Seamus eventually arrive at the burrow as well. Their costumes look so much better, but Harry doesn’t even care. All he wants is to see Draco. That’s the only reason why he’s coming with them in the first place.
The streets are already crowded. There are so many people surrounding them, many of them are muggles. The atmosphere is electric, the smell of alcohol, smoke, and sweat is hanging in the air. Harry grabs Dean’s arm because he doesn’t want to lose his friends in the crowd.
Draco shakes his head and blows out the smoke he had just inhaled. “Not your fault. It’s entirely my own.”
“Hm. I’ll leave my boxers on”, Harry decides. He takes off his hoodie, then his sweatpants. He’s suddenly very much aware of the proximity in this tiny bathroom. He notices how close Draco is standing and feels hot all of a sudden. Even though they had sex multiple times and saw each other naked about a million times by now, Harry feels nervous, shy, and self-conscious all of a sudden. This is different, he thinks. There’s no Amortentia to cloud their brains. What if Draco looks at Harry’s body and finds it absolutely disgusting now?
“Well, that’s another good reason why I can’t leave you”, Harry says. “Let’s get you to the hospital wing.”
Harry nods and pulls his wand out of the pocket of his jeans. He takes off his shoes and transfigures one into a nice pink dildo.
He still doesn’t look at Draco. The other man steps closer to him but keeps enough distance. Harry can smell the alcohol surrounding Draco from here. The man must be as drunk as him, maybe he’s even drunker.
“See you in two weeks!”, Draco says and waves at the students. They wave back and hurry out of the lecture hall.
The lecture goes smoothly. He does look up a lot less than he would usually do, scared that a certain raven-haired boy would startle and confuse him. But other than that, the lecture goes on smoothly
He’s thankful that they spare him from helping much. Molly had given him a kiss on the cheek the other day. She had commented on how soft Harry’s hair feels and Harry had almost burst out into tears. Ever since then, he was left alone most of the time, his friends chatting with him occasionally and trying to distract him from the aching burn inside his chest.
He decides to call him then. But Harry doesn’t pick up the phone. He texts him that he needs to see Harry. But Harry doesn’t respond.
At first, Harry chuckles. Then, he realizes what this means. Harry’s heart rate speeds up. Draco wants to see him - Right now! He has no idea how he’s supposed to get out of this lesson, but he has no options here. His entire body craves Draco. He needs to see him, no matter what.
“Maybe we should start being friends for now. Like, actually hang out and do things together, you know? We never actually got to know each other”, Harry suggests.
Halloween is right around the corner, and Harry feels a weird mix of happiness and sadness. The others have all decided to go home for a week. Being at Hogwarts during such a festive time simply doesn’t feel right just yet. It reminds them too much of the war. The teachers have agreed to give the eighth-year students a week off.
Draco nods. “Always thought your hair looked hideous and it needed my special hands to style and tame them.”
He begins to rub his hands all over Draco’s arms and back and is relieved when Draco’s eyes flutter open.
“But seriously, Potter. All we ever did was fight and shout and insult each other. Who would’ve thought that you and I could ever have a normal, civil conversation with each other?
“I was waving at you! For five minutes, straight. I looked absolutely ridiculous. And you stared right at me and turned around and flirted with that guy!”
But when Draco suddenly steps inside the library where Harry is currently trying to do homework and sits down next to him, Harry is genuinely surprised.
This feels so much more intimate than Harry has ever felt with anyone. He wants to do this forever, wants to feel Draco, wants to kiss him, wants to take care of him, touch him, and make him feel good.
The wizard cringes at how broken his own voice sounds. He clears his throat and tries again. “No. No, he didn’t.”
Draco huffs and runs a hand through his hair. He seems very tired. There are dark shadows under his eyes and he looks a bit slimmer than usual. Harry's heart clenches. “Hi.”
“It took me a while to realize it. And I was foolish to ever suggest these idiotic things. We never should’ve messed with this stupid love potion. It was meant to end in a disaster. And I never should’ve suggested being
Harry draws a flower on the open page of his book, earning a stern glance from Hermione which he shrugs off. He hasn't slept well last night and he wants this lesson to be over with as quickly as possible. Potions had always been his least favorite subject, but after the War it had only gotten worse.
Draco arches his back, his mouth falls open, his eyes roll back and Draco’s entire body tenses. He doesn’t say anything, he only breathes heavily. Tears stream down his face.
The evening comes quicker than expected and soon, the group finds themselves in front of the London Eye.
“I’m no expert, mate. But I think you should talk to him. Be honest for once. Tell him how you feel.”, Ron eventually says.
“Hermione,” he says and squeezes her hand. “You really did a fantastic job with the decoration. The room looks amazing.”
When Harry gets back to his room, he’s already worrying about the marks on his body. How is he going to explain those to his friends? He really doesn’t want to talk about it all.
Draco doesn't know which group he should go up with. When he spots Harry, Hermione, her boyfriend and a girl with light blonde hair and another girl with bright red hair, he hesitates at first. But he really wants to be close to Harry and maybe ask him what's wrong.
actually admit to it. He's also a little scared to be with him. His job is too important for him, he can’t risk it.
Within the next minutes, 30 students fill the lecture hall and sit down in the front row watching Draco excitedly.
They continue to hang up the baubles. Harry holds himself back because he wants Draco to hang up as many baubles as possible. Draco seems even more concentrated decorating the tree than he looked when he prepared breakfast.
what he was doing. He wanted to kiss Draco. He wanted to fuck him in that dirty bathroom. He wanted to tell him that he
“I fucked it all up”, Draco cries. “He’ll never speak to me again. It’s probably for the best anyway, it was meant to go downhill right from the start.”
“What do you need to see him for? Confessing your love to him, apologising for being such a dickhead and finally coming to your senses? Or breaking his heart all
Harry nods and lets him continue. When Draco’s hands move lower and rest on his shoulders, Harry can’t stop the happy sigh leaving his lips. Draco begins to massage his shoulders, rubbing and squeezing them gently and Harry wants to turn around and kiss the other man. God, he really, really wants to kiss him.
“We didn’t know for sure. But it became more and more obvious. You guys always met up with some mysterious date at the same time. You started watching him from afar. He started blushing every time he caught you staring. He would drool over you at Quidditch games and cheer you on, even though he hates Quidditch ever since the war ended. He never watches any game unless you play. You would always look for him in the crowd, you probably didn’t do it on purpose, but you did. Then, Halloween happened. I don’t need to explain Halloween any further, do I? After Halloween, we knew for sure.”
Draco contemplates. All of the other students are busy talking or reading or sleeping. They wouldn’t even notice Harry, a student, was sitting next to him. Besides, they probably wouldn't give a shit anyway.
Together, they rush towards the bathroom, both clearly not thinking straight. After two hours of drinking his mind has left any ability to form any reasonable thought.
He’s so close to coming, the heat becomes almost impossible to bear. He’s sweating, he feels out of breath, but he doesn’t stop. “Ohhh”
Harry knows he’s only saying this because his mind is intoxicated. But it still feels nice hearing him say this.
“Harry,” Draco cries. Draco lets Harry fuck him patiently, melts like butter in his arms. Harry tries to match his strokes with his thrusts. He can feel Draco’s hot breath brush his ear. His breathing is ragged, and the heat radiating from Draco becomes hotter and hotter. “Oh Merlin, Harry, don’t stop. Don’t stop. I need you, need your cock, fill me up, come for me, I need to feel your cum inside of me, please.”
Draco immediately follows his lead. The way Draco moans into the kiss is mesmerizing. He kisses him back just as passionately. After making out for what feels like hours, they pull apart.
“In the afternoon we’ll visit the Victoria and Albert Museum. This will take about three hours. In the evening you’re free to do whatever you want to do. Go have dinner, get drunk, go out, I don’t care as long as you don’t die and are fit enough to participate on Friday.”
Emerald green eyes stare into grey ones and for a moment the world stops. Draco grabs his coat tightly for support.
It isn’t ‘whatever.’ Everybody knows that. But there’s nothing he can do about it. “I have to use the bathroom.”
“Sure,” Harry agrees because going outside to have a smoke with Draco Malfoy sounds fucking fantastic right now.
Neville, Dean, and Ron burst out into a fit of giggles. “Sure. That’s why you’ve been getting ready for over an hour now.”
Draco turns around and smiles at him through soft, grey eyes. He’s never looked more beautiful in the dim light.
“Draco?”, he shouts. No answer. He runs to the kitchen, checking the room first. No Draco. Then, he checks the living room – empty. Fuck.
Harry turns around and walks straight up to Lucas, who is standing next to his friends only a couple of tables away. If Draco can make out with somebody else, so can Harry. He stops right in front of Lucas, who smiles down at him in surprise.
Neville rolls his eyes. “Keep telling yourself that, honey. You're absolutely in love with that boy.”
“You’ve attended the lecture about Ancient Greek last semester and wrote the best essay hands down. Of course, I remember.”
Draco tilts his head and watches him through unreadable, sad grey eyes. Harry’s heart begins to flutter. Then, Draco finally answers “Yeah, you can always pretend.”
Draco grabs Harry’s neck with his left hand and squeezes just enough to make sure that Harry knows he’s still in control after all. He could stop this at any moment. It’s the perfect mixture of rough and passionate, and Harry’s head begins to spin.
Draco’s head snaps around, the moment Harry’s fingers comb through his hair. Harry pulls back slowly. The blonde man watches Harry with an unreadable expression. Then, he slowly answers. “This is its natural state. I usually spend a lot of time to style them. I don’t really like it natural.”
Harry nods. His head spins, and he doesn’t know how to respond. The conversation went into a weird and confusing direction, and Harry can’t keep up anymore.
For some reason, Harry can’t stop thinking about the fact that Malfoy is gay. He wishes he could talk to someone about those bound breaking news, but he doesn’t know if Draco is outed already. That’s why he keeps this information to himself.
Ah, the perks of being The Golden Boy, as Draco always puts it. “May I excuse myself to go to the hospital wing? I think I’ve distorted a muscle during Quidditch training. It really hurts.”
But Draco’s hot skin feels too good. Draco’s moans sound like heaven and Harry’s brain shuts off. He grabs Draco’s arse and massages it gently.
“Why not? Just think about it for a sec. You are horny, but you don’t want to fuck just anyone here at Hogwarts. I’m horny, but I
When he runs up to the door, he knocks on it like a crazy person. “Harry? Harry, please open the door!”
When they sit in the Room of Requirement, talking or reading or listening to music together, Harry purposefully doesn’t sit next to Draco. Instead, he sits down on the other sofa. Harry wouldn’t be able to stop himself from cuddling into Draco’s side if they actually sat next to each other.
The moment he steps inside, his eyes land on Draco Malfoy, standing in the corner, murmuring something into Pansy’s ear. Harry’s heart stops beating, and he wants to run away, but at the same time, he wants to run up to Draco and kiss him and hug him. He had no idea that Draco was invited. Frantically, he searches the tent for Ron, or Hermione, or anyone really.
“So,” Draco obviously is trying to change the topic. “You’d just go for anyone who’s remotely pretty then?”
Draco can't even be mad. How could he? He has a wonderful boyfriend, an amazing best friend and after tonight he would have great new friends.
“Okay?”, Harry whispers, kisses Draco’s thigh, and watches Draco through worried eyes. The last thing he wants to do is hurt Draco or make him feel uncomfortable.
“Because I’m gay. And don’t worry. The last thing I’d think is that Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, is coming onto a death eater like me.”
“I need to be penetrated in order to fully turn”, Draco explains as he takes off his shoes and fumbles with his trousers. “That’s why you can’t help me. I’m pretty much stuck in this heat until I have a cock shoved up my arse.”
“You know, there’s this fancy club in London. They arrange a huge Halloween party. I think we should go. Luna, Dean, and Seamus have already said they would go”, Hermione says. They’re now sitting in the living room, the fire in the chimney crackling softly after they put all of their luggage inside their rooms.
“Harry!” Draco moans and grabs Harry’s hand that is resting on his thigh. “Touch me; I need you so much closer.”
“It’s cute how your eyes light up when you talk about scary things like Hilter and the concentration camps.”
The memories of last night hit him then. Harry suddenly remembers everything. The Leaky Cauldron, the Room of Requirement, Draco, his idea, the Dungeons, the brewing, the Armortentia, the Sex.
Harry needs a moment. He holds on to Draco’s shoulders, squeezes his eyes shut, and takes a few deep breaths. Then, slowly, very slowly, his vision comes back and he looks up. Suddenly, he realizes how close Draco and Harry are standing. He could easily move forward and press his lips on top of Draco’s. He can already feel his breath on his lips. It would be so damn easy.
But he really has no excuse when he steps forward. Cold water splashes onto his fully clothed body waking him up instantly. Still, he reaches out and touches Draco’s shoulders with both his hands.
Why won’t Ginny just shut up? Harry feels as if he’s drowning in his embarrassment. Fuck. In the corner of his eyes, he notices Draco shift uncomfortably.
“Do you want to watch a movie?”, Harry suggests when his eyes land on the little TV next to the chimney.
Harry cares about people. He always has. And he always felt protective over people and wants to help when someone is feeling bad. At least that’s what he tells himself when he walks down the crowded corridor and searches for the tall young man.
He wishes he could wrap his arms around Draco right now and tell him how much he loves him. How much he wants to be with him. How badly he wants to kiss him and fall asleep next to him for the rest of his life. How much he regrets the past two months of ignoring each other and not admitting his feelings sooner. He could’ve spent the past months kissing Draco every single day! But he as a fool and was too scared, to be honest with himself. He wants to tell Draco all of this. But now he’s gone.
“I admire you and your passion for history”, Harry says softly. Draco doesn’t dare to look at him. “I wish I was as passionate for something as you are.”
When Harry tells Hermione, Ron, and Neville about their deal later that night, they don’t seem convinced.
Harry raises his eyebrows, amusement still clear in his eyes. “What makes you think I would flirt with you?”
Harry gulps. Draco is right. He’s actually saying out loud what Harry has been thinking. “Yeah. That’s true. But I had felt that the lines were starting to blur way before that anyway. And we already agreed that we don’t find each other ugly. So, it didn’t really take me by surprise.”
Draco nods. “Yes. That’s what I meant. I was just trying to say that anyone would literally throw themselves at you.”
Harry lowers his hands and begins to unbutton Draco’s belt and jeans. He pushes them down as far as possible. Draco helps him with his own jeans.
He quickly realizes that the other students either adore him and literally try everything to get with him. It is actually pathetic, and a tiny bit scary how desperate and thirsty for him some of the people are.
“Please, Harry. I need so much more than that. I need to feel you inside me! I need you to fill me up, need your cock inside my arse”, Draco groans.
“The only reason you came along was Draco. The moment you stepped into the club, all you cared about was Draco. You almost burst out into tears when you saw him kissing somebody else and he nearly lost his shit when he saw you kissing that random dude.”
Then, Harry starts walking towards the little house. He opens the red door and walks inside, Draco following him.
Once they’re all back at Hogwarts, things are different. Harry doesn’t know why things have changed, but it’s weird now. Draco and Harry don’t meet up on Friday nights anymore. They actually stop talking completely and Harry has no idea why.
Harry moves the finger inside of Draco, curls it and teases him with as much care as possible. Draco radiates so much heat, Harry is beginning to sweat.
Harry nods. God, he wants to hug Draco. He wants to be close to him. But he stops himself. He doesn’t know what to say and it makes him feel incredibly sad.
“I mean Hermione and I couldn’t believe how slow you were. It was so fucking obvious, you know, with all the eye fucking going on. I thought you’d be married by
Without thinking twice, Harry follows Draco through the crowd. Malfoy takes an unusual turn and heads down an empty corridor, he’s clearly limping and he clutches his waist.
The boy moans as Draco continues to lick his tight hole, teasing him and making him feel good. Draco can't help his own arousal and begins to moan himself.
With that, Malfoy turns around and heads back inside, leaving Harry behind feeling absolutely star-struck and nauseous.
When they’re finally done, Draco reaches for his bag, ready to leave. But Harry doesn’t really want him to go just yet. Surprisingly, he really does enjoy his company even when they’re sober and doing boring stuff. Doing homework together, for example. “Draco?”
He blushes. “Are you in love with me?” Harry asks. He needs to hear it again. His heart his hammering inside his chest.
“Right”, Harry says and shakes his head as if waking out of a trance. He tells him the address and Draco starts to drive.
Draco hisses in pain but throws his head back shortly after. “God, that feels better. Eases the pain.”
Draco doesn’t put on his nice grey jumper and his black trousers for Harry. He doesn’t style his hair in a nice soft quiff and he doesn’t moisturise nor shaves his stubbles Tuesday morning for Harry. He does it for himself. He doesn’t care about Harry. He
He doesn’t dare to say anything since he doesn’t want to interrupt Draco’s flow. He seems to be deeply concentrated. Harry has never seen anything like it. Sure, Hermione is focused when she studies, and Harry is very concentrated when he flies and trains Quidditch. But Draco seems lost in his own thoughts, caught up in his own little world of creativity.
“Oh Merlin,” Draco sighs as he wraps his arms around Harry and pulls him closer to his chest. He presses a kiss on his forehead. “I think I’m getting too old for this shit.”
Harry’s head is going all fuzzy and he wishes that he could clear it. His heart thrums painfully in his chest and he feels like throwing up. Draco painted him! And he made him look so beautiful.
Therefore, he tries his hardest to hide the bruises on his body. He wears his thickest jumper and a scarf. But he’s sharing the room with four blokes who know him better than he knows himself. Obviously, they notice something is different the moment he enters their shared dorm room. He knows because they stare at him with raised eyebrows and questioning eyes. But thankfully, they don’t ask any questions. They know Harry well enough, and they give him his space. Harry couldn’t be more grateful.
“No love potions, no alcohol, no touching, no kissing, no sex”, Draco replies, watching Harry with curiosity.
It becomes a habit, this thing between the two boys. Every Friday night, they meet up at the Room of Requirement. Draco always comes prepared with two bottles of Armortentia, which makes Harry feel nervous and excited every single time. For some reason, he can’t get used to being around Draco. Something about this new level of their relationship makes him nervous but in the right way. In a good way. He doesn’t think about it. He
When Draco manages to get rid of Harry’s boxers, he conjures some lube and gently squeezes Harry’s tip.
Draco plays with his silver rings. “No, you’re obviously not ugly. Have you never looked in a mirror before or what?”
Harry shivers. He can only see the outlines of Draco now. His grey eyes shimmer in the dark light. They’re so close, Harry can feel Draco’s warmth and his breath on his lips. His heart beats so fast, it almost hurts in his chest.
Draco raises his eyebrows and watches Harry make himself comfortable on the grey couch. He gets out his laptop and some papers.
Harry grins and shakes his head, glad to hop on board and happy to change the topic. “No, I do need to find them attractive.”
It doesn’t feel good. Harry hates it. Lucas’ stubbles itch Harry’s face, his hair doesn’t feel as soft as Draco’s, he’s too bulky, and his hands are too thick. Harry pulls away. He forces a smile and lies: “You’re cute.”
Harry pulls out of Draco, whispers a cleaning spell, and lays back down on top of Draco. He wraps his arms around Malfoy’s petite body and presses a kiss on his shoulder. Then, he closes his eyes and eventually nods off.
They order, eat their lunch and chat about work. But Draco's mind stays focused on Harry the entire time, his mum's words echoing inside his brain.
That makes Draco grin. He nods, runs a hand through his messy sex-hair, and turns around. “Good. Then I’ll see you on Friday next week. Ten pm.”
Draco feels very hesitant at first, feeling scared that Harry's friends won't like him anymore after all the drama between them. But Harry promises him that they're not unforgiving and that they will love him.
He can see some of his students eagerly writing the stuff down. Draco smiles. „You don’t have to write all of this down, I have printed the information for you. I’ll hand them out later.”
Harry immediately rows back. “No, no. No. I – I don’t know. I just enjoy these moments with you so much. I’m sad when they’re over.”
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose in frustration. “The Veela transformation usually is a very normal, painless act.”
Draco walks up to the door but stops himself before leaving. He turns around and watches Harry with an unreadable expression.
Therefore, they made a huge mess in the kitchen, laughing and spilling tomato sauce everywhere. But the pizza actually tasted nice.
Harry looks at him deeply lost in his thoughts. His brows are furrowed and he bites his lip. Draco nearly has a heart attack at the sight of that and busies himself with his paperwork.
"Tell me if it's too much and I'll stop", Draco grits out, slamming into Harry and leaving bruises all over Harry's lower back.
Draco’s mouth falls open and he stumbles against the wall, his hands gripping the showerhead tightly. “Uuuugh. Oh my god, please don’t stop. Harry - I - Fuck, I can’t breathe - this is too much”
He can feel Draco smile against his forehead. Draco tightens his arms around Harry. “Don’t worry. I get them too, you know.”
He’s on his usual cook-and-talk date with his best friend Neville. This time, it was Draco’s turn to cook for the two of them and he hasn’t stopped complaining about the mysterious boy since Neville entered Draco’s apartment.
Harry seems as if he wants to say something but then the waiter sets their food down on the table. “Okay, I’ll back off for now. But this discussion isn’t finished just
He can’t say anything else though. Even if he wanted to stop and distance himself from Draco, at this point, he couldn’t. He’s falling, deeper and deeper, and there’s no way to stop.
A weird silence settles between them. Harry feels the awkward tension again that he thought they had gotten rid of. But he’s just not used to talking to Malfoy yet. But since he doesn’t like the sudden silence, he decides to speak up.
Draco lets it all happen. He moans happily, adjusts to Harry’s wild pace, and runs his hands through his black hair.
Draco grins and then goes even lower making Harry shiver. The boy lets out delicious moans and Draco can feel his own cock hardening more and more.
Draco shakes his head and presses his lips to Harry's. They walk up to Draco's door and he gets his keys out. "Don't thank me. It was the least I could do to make it up to you."
Harry presses his lips together and closes his eyes. Those moans would melt any man in seconds. If Draco keeps this up, Harry won’t be able to control himself.
Harry follows his orders. He moans, loses himself in Draco as he starts to feel his orgasm slowly building up inside of him.
He grabs the painting and takes a closer look. That’s his messy hair, his long lashes, his lips, and – his scar?! It is Harry! It shows him sleeping on this exact couch. His hair looks wild but his face seems so peaceful and – beautiful.
Harry wishes he could just tell Neville about the Armortentia. That’s the only reason why Draco even started enjoying the time spent with Harry. But Neville would probably send him to a mental hospital right away for agreeing to something so stupid and dangerous.
“It all started off with an incredibly stupid idea. Um. We basically hooked up. But we weren’t sober at the time.”
Harry’s heart beats faster. He runs a hand through his messy hair – Draco follows the movement with his eyes.
Harry loves listening to Draco begging. Who would’ve thought that Draco begging for it could be so fucking hot? He licks the inside of Draco’s left thigh. Draco shivers.
He runs his hands through the younger man's hair and grabs it tightly, causing Harry to moan. "It doesn't feel wrong, does it?"
“Okay, okay”, Harry says and rushes towards Draco. He quickly unbuttons the shirt and helps Draco out of it.
"You on top of me, massaging me, kissing me, fingering me, fucking me...", Harry moans and sucks the soft skin on Draco's neck.
Something has shifted last night. He can feel it. He simply cannot say what it is. And this morning has changed everything between them. Draco doesn't know what exactly happened between them, but the way Harry has looked at him before leaving Draco's room sends terrible shivers down his spine.
After half an hour, Draco slowly seems to wake up. He rubs his nose, turns around on his back, and stretches his legs and arms with an “Uurrghh” sound.
The play begins, but Draco doesn’t really pay attention. His thoughts are everywhere except for where they should be.
Harry rolls his eyes and sits back down. “I’m getting annoyed with you, Malfoy. I really am. I'm starting to think you're following me around.”
Draco bites Harry’s neck and rubs his free hand over his stomach. The warm water soothes his muscles and helps him relax. When Draco pushes in a second finger, Harry bites his lip and holds on to the bathtub.
He gets up and slips past Luna. The moment he rises, people’s heads turn. They start to whisper and point at Harry. He wishes he could disappear.
What? No, no, no. He can’t come over. He couldn’t help himself if he saw shirtless Harry this close, this private, this intimate. Draco quickly fixes his hair, suddenly feeling very self-conscious about the stubbles on his jaw and straightens his pyjama.
Draco gets ready as if he had an out of body experience. He doesn’t really feel the water when he’s showering, doesn’t taste the toothpaste in his mouth and packs his things like a Roboter.
And even though he misses Draco terribly, he’s also not brave enough to look for him and talk to him. He’s scared of finding something he doesn’t want to find. He doesn’t want to be rejected. And he doesn’t want to ruin things between them even further.
Harry can’t believe he asked Draco out. He didn’t really ask him out. But this still feels like a date. Draco had immediately agreed to repeat their little adventure from last week. He had told Harry he would brew the potion and that they should meet around 10 pm.
Harry nods. He also trusts Draco the most with potions, simply because he knows that the blonde man is brilliant at brewing potions.
“Oh. Sorry”, Harry replies and rips his eyes away from him. He gets up and begins to wander through the classroom, trying to keep himself busy, so he won’t stare at Malfoy again. Harry doesn’t really know what to do with himself, so the raven-haired man starts to stretch his sore muscles. Schoolwork has been tough and he can feel the tension and the pain in his muscles every single day. Then, he turns around, and his eyes immediately find Draco’s. Draco looks away. He almost seems as if he got caught doing something forbidden.
Harry begins to explain the phone to Draco. He shows him how to send a text message, how to make a phone call, how to take photos, and how to download apps.
Every other Partner that Draco has had (not that it had been many) has eventually annoyed the crap out of him. He simply enjoys his peace and quiet and most people don't respect that. They start a conversation with him after 30 minutes or they start getting really loud.
Draco watches him as if he understands. For some weird reason, Harry does feel comfortable around the other man. “Well, if you ever want to gossip about your weird fans, I’m down. I’ll get back to class now, though.”
It’s been a week since the hookup, and Harry can’t concentrate on anything else. He gets flashbacks of that night, his thoughts keep drifting to Draco, and he feels uneasy most of the time. He doesn’t know what it is. At first, he had been in a fantastic mood. He thought everything was great between him and Draco. He thought he was being cool. He could handle it. He never got attached to a One-Night Stand before anyway.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco eventually goes back to working in silence and Harry watches him crack a few nuts, cut some shrubbery and add some strange looking powder into the Cauldron. Harry gets lost in the movement of Draco's long, slim fingers. His hands are beautiful. Strong and pale.
Draco presses soft kisses down on Harry’s messy hair and continues to rub his back while Harry breathes heavily into his neck.
It’s quiet between them again. Harry decides to speak up. “Thank you. For calming me down, you know.”
Draco looks up into Harry’s eyes and presses his lips on top of his. “Let’s just enjoy right now, okay? It’s perfect how it is now. Let’s not destroy it.”
“Or”, Draco grins and changes his voice into a mocking tone. “are you excited for Boxing Day tomorrow?”
He is aware of the fact that Harry knows Draco pretty well, he can tell by the way Harry looks right into his soul.
“Harry, we’re just worried about you”, Hermione replies softly. “We don’t want you to get hurt. And this thing with Draco is already complicated enough as it is.”
Then, his hand suddenly moves upwards to Draco head. Draco’s breath hitches in his throat and his heart stops beating. In a soft, gentle movement, Harry strokes some wet hair out of Draco’s eyes.
at him! And Harry’s heart rate speeds up. Fuck. He quickly grabs one of his textbooks and opens it at a random page. “What page was I supposed to read again?”
“Wait a sec,” Neville shouts. He hears some clattering, and then, Neville opens the door. His face is red and covered in mud.
Draco watches Harry. He watches him wet his hair and his body with the warm water and Harry’s throat suddenly feels dry. Maybe he should’ve thought this through. Maybe he shouldn’t have urged Draco to help him with his hair. But now it’s too late anyway. He’s sitting as good as naked in a bathtub. Draco Malfoy, the man he’s fucked countless times and Harry still feels awkward being naked in front of him, sits next to him. This is a surreal, weird situation. Harry truly has the talent to get himself into the most fucked up situations.
He opens the door to the balcony and steps outside. Taking deep breaths, he tries to calm down his racing thoughts but it’s useless. He’ll never find peace thanks to Harry.
Draco does as he's being told. He begins to thrust into Harry, keeping himself steady with a tight grip on Harry's waist. The other wraps around Harry's neck,
The room looks very cozy. There’s a stack on the left, a desk with books, a vast, soft carpet, candles, and two big sofas. Harry smiles. Yeah, here he could relax for a little bit.
And now he’s sitting in between Neville and Luna, feeling incredibly uncomfortable since everyone in the Leaky Cauldron is staring at him. He tries to hide his discomfort, but the others notice it too.
When Harry jumps off the Hogwarts Express, he feels a strange mix of joy and nostalgia. He made the right decision coming back for repeating his eighth year, that’s for sure. But he can’t help the memories of the war flooding in.
“Harry,” Neville sighs and turns to face him. “You’re the most deluded person I know. We noticed how deep you were in it the first time you met him months ago. You were literally a different kind of happy the next morning after we all went to the Leaky Caldron and left you alone.”
He’s thankful for the distraction. He needs a moment to cool off and collect himself. When he finally feels a little calmer, Harry rolls them over. His head is spinning. All he can think of is
When did that happen? When did he get so fond of Malfoy, Draco fucking Malfoy out of all people, to a point where he starts to miss him after a few days? It’s getting more and more real for Harry every single day. He’s beginning to realize that he can’t blame Armortentia forever. Eventually, he’ll have to admit that he’s growing very fond of Draco. Eventually, he’ll have to start thinking about what this all means. He probably should’ve done that way sooner.
“It's not illegal. This isn't Highschool. And it’s only weird because you make it weird. He’s cute, he’s nice and he blew you away the minute you laid your eyes on him. I say give it a try.”
And then, Harry hits this particular spot inside of Draco. Draco’s head snaps up, his mouth falls open, and he looks as if he’s about to pass out.
"Usually", Draco begins without looking up at Harry "I wouldn't allow you to sit there and watch but you and Potions? That train has left a long time ago and you could never catch up."
Harry notices Draco’s long, clean fingers. He watches his blonde, soft hair. He can’t wait to kiss the pale skin on Draco’s neck soon. He feels a bubble of excitement inside of him, just thinking about that. He isn’t aware of the fact that he hasn’t even started drinking one sip of the love potion and already feels excited. No, he’s pushing that thought far, far away, not wanting to understand what it all means.
“Jesus, can’t they give you a break for one second?” Hermione whispers as she sorts out her cards. They want to play a muggle game that the other wizards have never heard of.
But Draco has a good view of him. He's wearing a grey jumper and blue jeans. His hair is messy as usual and he looks incredibly attractive. Draco sighs.
They finally reach the greenhouses. Draco licks his lips and straightens his shoulders. Harry can tell that he feels uneasy. He wishes he could somehow make it easier for Malfoy, tell him that he doesn’t have to feel weird around Harry. But the thing is, Harry also feels weird and uneasy around Malfoy. So, what kind of Hypocrite would he be?
Harry can’t believe this. Did Draco actually get him breakfast? His heart swells, and his chest flutters. That is very, very sweet.
Draco clears his throat. “About Voldemort. And the time when he lived with us. It was the most terrifying time of my life.”
He can feel Harry’s breath on his neck when Harry suddenly leans towards him. “You look so fucking hot, you have no idea.”
Draco doesn't care. He pushes the door open, but just as he wants to close it, Harry shoves himself into the tiny room with him, he locks the door behind him and grabs Draco's arms. Then he pushes Draco against the door, pressing himself against him.
Draco closes the door softly behind Harry. And without hesitation, he wraps both his arms gently around Harry's body and pulls him impossibly close. He breathes him in, his wonderful scent of vanilla, wood and smoke and strokes his back gently.
And Harry does. He talks about Judith Butler and her gender theory and how she revolutionized the idea of Gender and Sex and how Harry finds the whole theory very interesting.
Draco takes a deep breath and frowns. “Get a grip on yourself, man. You’re a professional, serious professor.”
“What exactly are you reading?”, Harry asks. He can read the title himself, but he wants to talk to Draco.
On rare occasions, Draco gets lunch in the cafeteria. He hates the unhealthy, fatty food there, but sometimes he forgets to bring lunch so he has no choice.
After releasing the students, Draco busies himself closing the PowerPoint presentation on his laptop. He pulls out the plug when he notices someone is walking up towards his desk.
He really needs to pull himself together. He finishes his lecture as he usually does, smiles shyly at the applause he receives afterwards and watches the students leave the lecture hall.
They both study for over an hour and Draco was right. It actually isn’t as bad as Harry had thought. And since Christmas break is already in two weeks, Harry feels much more motivated now.
But he can’t talk about this. How could he confess to his friends that Draco and Harry got high on a dangerous, potent love potion just to fuck the entire night? That doesn’t sit right, even with himself. And still, that night was absolutely incredible. It was so fantastic that his mind keeps drifting back to it. He can’t think about anything else.
“No, that’s not what I meant. I simply don’t enjoy other people’s company that much. I like being on my own. I always had to be, you know? But I do enjoy your company. A lot, actually.”
When they finally break apart, Draco grins. “Merlin, took us long enough to figure that out, didn’t it?”
Harry presses his lips together. He definitely doesn’t want to admit to Draco that he can’t sleep without him by his side. That would be embarrassing. And it would probably ruin everything between them.
“I also dream of being lonely. Hogwarts isn’t necessarily being nice to me, you know. The people here can be … cruel.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
He presses his lips together and tries to ignore the stinging pain in his chest. It doesn’t matter, he tells himself. He's not disappointed. Nor is he jealous. It’s nothing. It’s better this way.
“Then fight for him,” Hermione replies and she makes it sound so easy. “Apparate to his place and tell him you love him.”
"Don't make this a big deal", Draco warns him and takes a sip of his wine to hide his blush. This whole situation is making him incredibly uncomfortable.
Harry presses his lips together. Even though he really wants to fuck Malfoy already, he doesn’t want to hurt him. He wants him to enjoy this just as much as Harry. But then again, Malfoy already told him that he likes it rough. And last time wasn’t exactly soft either. Why should he not follow Draco’s directions?
on his looks, he’s actually very beautiful”, Dean says after considering this for a while. “His grey eyes, his blonde soft hair. He has a nice body, and a really nice arse, if I do say so myself. Yeah, he’s stunning. I actually agree with Ginny.”
Harry rolls his hips into Draco, opens his legs even further, allowing Draco to slip inside even deeper. They both let out a desperate cry at that.
Draco. He desperately wants to see him, talk to him. Hell, just looking at him would be enough. Harry is utterly fucked and he forces himself not to think about it too much. Doesn't want to think about what any of this means.
Harry opens his eyes in surprise. That can’t be true. Draco Malfoy has problems getting laid? Draco Malfoy? The hottest guy in their year? “I don’t believe you.”
His breath hitches and he closes his eyes shut and lets his head fall back. It’s all too much. Thank god he's sitting closest to the aisle where it's also the darkest.
Harry grins to himself, but he won’t be giving it to the blonde man so easily. He continues massaging Draco’s thighs, his arse cheeks, and every now and then, he lowers his lips and sucks Draco’s hole. Draco moans uncontrollably now, and Harry only hopes that the room of requirement is soundproof.
Harry watches Draco with fascination as he slowly enters another finger. Draco’s back muscles move beautifully. His face is warped with pleasure.
But still. Harry sits down next to Dean, Neville, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. He immediately begins to fill his plate.
Together, they walk towards their next class. For some reason, Harry feels awkward. They haven’t spoken at all since the trial. Harry had defended Draco and his Mother in court because he was and still is convinced that Draco was only a victim of his surroundings and that he didn’t have a choice. He never actually talked to Draco, though. Not before and not after the trial. The timing had always been odd. He feels weirdly nervous around Draco now.
Draco smiles. The boy is adorable. "Oh, well. Then good luck for your exam - um - you’ve never introduced yourself.”
„I’m very pleased that you are all so greatly interested in coming to London with me to catch up on some history together“ Draco begins his PowerPoint presentation.
Draco takes a deep breath and fumbles for a while. Eventually, he goes for it and hangs the bauble right in the middle of the tree.
Draco looks up from his book and stares at emerald green eyes. Harry looks a bit paler than usual but the smile is as bright as always.
Draco watches him closely for a second. His hair is even messier than this morning. “I’m gonna go eat something. And I’ll probably go back to the hotel.”
Harry smiles. He watches Draco from the side and feels his chest tightening. “It’s magical, isn’t it? It’s always so busy down here. The house-elves love cooking. Every time I come down here with an extra wish, they get all excited and bubbly.”
Harry feels anger bubbling up inside of him. He turns around and finally looks up at Draco. He ignores the way his makeup enhances his grey eyes. Draco looks absolutely beautiful. Fuck. “That’s funny, considering
Draco doesn’t feel any different. It’s all too much. Harry on top of him, rolling his hips down on Draco’s. Harry’s dick touching Draco’s.
Draco takes the showerhead from Harry’s hands. His voice sounds rough and quiet. “You haven’t used enough water. You need to go much slower.”
“That is pathetic, Potter. You have fucking options, so use them! Some people don’t have that luck!”
“Draco?”, Harry shouts and puts his arms around the man. “Draco? Can you hear me? You just passed out for a couple of minutes.”
Draco sighs. “That’s what I’ve been trying to figure out over the past month. I had hoped you would have an answer.”
When it’s finally December, they get their last assignments for the month. Harry sits in Potions, but he doesn’t really listen to the Professor. He wants this month to be over with as soon as possible. He wants to go home for Christmas already.
Draco and Harry both roll onto their backs. Then, Draco starts to giggle. “Oh, Lord. That was insane. I can’t believe what just happened.”
Draco smiles softly. “Okay, now talking about not selflessly sacrificing yourself. What do you mean with that?”
Draco takes a quick sip of his drink. “Well, that’s too bad, Potter. Go cry about it somewhere else.”
He locks himself up and focuses on his work. He needs to prepare a few lectures, read through some essays and answer tons of emails. Trying desperately to distract himself and also trying to get rid of the images of Harry cuddling with another man, he throws himself into his work.
But fuck, why isn’t Draco reaching out to him instead? Draco was the one who disappeared! And now Draco doesn’t write or call or text! Harry is slowly but surely going insane.
But Harry doesn’t stop. He continues hitting that spot, pushing Draco over the edge. Moments later, Harry follows him and comes himself with a loud grunt.
“To be honest, I think Blaise Zabini is really hot”, Ron eventually blurts out. When the others look at him confused, he clears his throat. “I mean, come on. He looks insanely handsome.”
Draco smiles, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Well. I’d be a hypocrite if I had a problem with that.”
Harry tilts his head as he thinks. “I don’t know. A nice laugh, a good sense of humor, intelligence. Someone who gets me, you know? Someone who vibes with me.”
“Yes, you are. You’re squirming, you get all blushy and awkward, you avoid my question. You’re uptight. That actually doesn’t surprise me at all. I bet you’re the flowers and hearts kind of guy.”
Draco presses his lips together and forces himself to stop staring at the boy. He really needs to get his shit together, it's starting to get creepy.
Draco nods. “Yeah, pretty much. History was my favourite subject. It was clear to me that I would study it at the university. Then my professor suggested I should do my doctorate. So I did.”
He wants to grab Draco, push him against a wall, kiss him, and never, not even in a million years, let go of him.
“I don’t know,” Harry lies. “I guess I’m not good at this school thing. Homework is really stressing me out. Also, I want everyone to just leave me alone, you know?”
to participate. He doesn’t have to be the strict annoying teacher who forces the students to behave.
Draco grabs the phone, opens the camera, and holds it up in the air. He points the camera towards Harry and snaps a picture. “Lovely.”
“Do you think that I’m ugly?” Harry doesn’t know where that came from. Why does he even care about Malfoy’s opinion? He obviously doesn’t. Malfoy doesn’t matter at all!
Malfoy doesn't look up. His lips are pressed together tightly and he seems to concentrate on his work.
The wizard knows that he’s a coward. There’s no reason for him to avoid Draco. He should look for him, talk to him, tell him the truth. Be the Gryffindor that he is.
“Shut up!”, Draco shouts. “Do you have any idea how fucking lost I felt without you? I’ve literally gone crazy without you! How could you just disappear and not call, not text back, not say anything?”
Draco wipes a sweaty hair strand away from his face. “Probably. Theo, Blaise, and Pansy are all going home. I wouldn’t want to stay here all alone.”
Harry smiles and pats the other side of his bed. “Yeah. Do you wanna sit here for a while and talk?”
They continue playing the game. The bottle lands on Ginny, and she chooses Truth. “Ginny, who is the best kisser in this group?”
Harry pushes the doors open and heads inside. He’s immediately being greeted by fifty house elves, all shouting “Mr. Potter, Mr. Potter, Mr. Potter, Mr. Potter!”
“Draco, don’t stop, don’t stop, I need you, need your cock, fill me up, come for me, I need to feel your cum inside of me, please.”
Draco takes a drag from his cigarette and shrugs. There’s a crooked smile covering his face.  “What? You’re not the only famous guy around here.”
He stretches his neck and searches around the club for blonde, silver hair, but he can’t find him anywhere.
“Because”, Seamus shouts. “I wanna know. Who’s the most attractive guy in our year? Or girl? What do you think, Harry?”
He manages to relax more and more, allowing Draco to slip his third finger in with almost no resistance.
And then, he presses his lips onto Draco’s. Harry's arms wrap themselves around Draco’s neck, pulling him as close as possible, while Draco eagerly responds to the kiss.
He reaches down and takes the glass, puts it on the table and grabs his wand to clean up the mess. Once he’s finished, he grabs the brushes and the paintings Draco had left on the floor and puts them aside. His hands are trembling and he feels nauseous. He fucked it all up again.
with Draco. And he really doesn’t wish for Draco to think that he might want something sexual from him.
The body on top of him cuddles even closer, tucks its nose in the space between Harry’s shoulder and neck, and sighs happily.
Draco turns around. The other man looks into Harry’s eyes. God, he’s so incredibly beautiful. Harry can't help but kiss him softly.
He wants Draco, and he realizes he’s utterly fucked. Because now he could once again destroy everything between them. It was his idea to brew Armortentia and shag. That already messed things up between them. It was also his idea to kiss Draco in a club whilst being completely drunk. It was also his idea to stop shagging and just be friends. He really couldn’t bring in another idea into this, now that it actually works just fine between them. He can’t confess his feelings and suggest trying out a relationship now.
Harry feels a heaviness inside his chest and he feels tears burning in his eyes again. “Did you mean it? When you said that you love me? Did you mean it?”
“Fuck, yes,” Draco moans. Harry can tell that he’s close too. They’re both so sensitive to each other’s touch.
“Here”, he points to the presentation “you can see the plan for Friday. Friday night, we’ll visit a Shakespeare theatre performance at the Harold Pinter Theatre.”
“Less talking, more kissing,” Draco replies and immediately presses his lips back on top of Harry’s. They begin to kiss passionately, both moving against each other, longing for friction.
Slowly, he slides in all the way. He swears, he sees stars at the sensation of being inside Harry’s tight arse.
Harry feels tears forming in his eyes. He never wanted to make Draco feel bad. He rolls his head back and stares at the ceiling. When did things get so awkward between them again? Harry has never seen Draco act this shy and quiet. And when did Harry get so nervous and unsure? Everything was going so great and now it’s all ruined again.
Harry tilts his head. “Draco, we’ve fucked so many times now. It’s important that we trust each other enough to talk about the things we like. Or don’t like. I don’t ever want to do something you don’t enjoy.”
Even though Harry would love to drag this into eternity, he knows that neither of them is going to last very much longer. Harry’s cock is throbbing painfully. And Harry desperately wants to drown inside of Draco tonight.
Harry smiles and watches Draco cutting the cake. He takes a huge slice and stuffs it into his mouth. Harry barks out a loud laugh. “Wow. That is a new sight. Draco Malfoy, stuffing his face with cake.”
Draco is thankful that the video stops right at that moment. He walks towards his laptop, closes the YouTube page and begins to explain what the author meant with his statement.
“Harry”, Draco cries. His breathing is ragged and the heat radiating from the two of them keeps him in a daze.
Draco slaps his hand across his face as the group breaks into a great fit of laughter. "Great. Thanks, Nev."
Malfoy watches Harry through unreadable, impossibly grey eyes, but he looks friendly. His face looks softer than Harry remembers, almost younger. “Were you running away from something, Potter?”
Harry’s head spins. He watches Neville get up and leave the bedroom to use the restroom. But his thoughts are still racing through his mind.
Hermione shakes her head, apparently woken up from her shock. “No, Harry. Of course, we’re not angry. Right, Ron?”
It's Thursday and Draco is spending the two free hours that he has in-between his lectures in his office grading some essays.
Harry nods. He wraps his arms around Draco and manages to calm down a little. If Draco is okay with this, he could be okay with it too. They stay like this for a while. Harry loses a sense of time. After what feels like hours, Draco finally speaks up.
Draco removes his mouth and grabs the oil next to him. He puts some into his hands and rubs them warming them up.
Neville sighs, but then he shrugs giving up. “Okay. Uh this smells delicious. I’m starving. Thanks for cooking, Malfoy.”
Draco knows it's not just about sex. They get along too well and there are way too many feelings involved already.
Harry finishes the second drink within minutes. “I can’t stand being in the same room as Draco whilst being sober. Getting drunk will help me get through this.”
But he won’t do it. He’s too scared of ruining things between them, and he doesn’t want Draco to feel uncomfortable.
But Draco still can’t seem to move. He’s scared that Harry won’t want him anymore. What if Harry met somebody new? What if Harry hates him now?
He almost wants to pull away, his heart beating painfully fast. But then, Draco sighs into the kiss, his muscles relax, and he starts to move his lips against Harry’s. Harry sighs, his mind dazed with pleasure and pure happiness. His body is on fire in the best way possible, because Draco is actually kissing him back! Merlin, this can’t be true, right? Harry must be dreaming. But then, Draco slides his arms around Harry’s back and presses him up against the wall. He’s kissing him back, leaving Harry breathless and thrilled by how good this all feels. It's the best kiss they've shared so far. They're both sober, both needy, both desperate.
Draco seems to be just as aroused. He lets his head roll back, allowing Harry access to his neck. Harry pulls away from Draco’s lips and kisses his way down low, bites Draco’s neck, kisses the sensitive skin, and turning the blonde man into a shuddering, moaning mess.
“Fuck,” Harry whispers into the kiss. He bites Draco’s lip and then grabs the boy’s t-shirt. He pulls it over his head and surges down to kiss Draco’s chest.
“Oh my god, fuck!” Draco cries, and then, finally, he sinks onto the mattress, into Harry’s firm hug, and relaxes.
And then, because he can’t wait anymore and because Draco won’t make the first move, Harry surges forward. He grabs Draco’s waist and his throat, pushes him against the desk, presses himself against Draco’s body, and begins to kiss him fiercely. The moment their lips meet, it’s as if Harry was starving before, and Draco is water, saving his life. He needs Draco to survive, needs him to be impossibly closer. He needs everything about Draco. He throws off his glasses and puts them on the table next to them, never letting go of Draco once.
“But you were the one who said that you didn’t find me attractive! You said that multiple times. You kept telling me how you didn’t fancy me. How it was all just sex between us. A one-time thing, a win-win situation, remember?”
. How was he ever able to live without this wonderful man? He’s never noticed how well they actually work together. They’re made for each other. Draco is now lying on his stomach, waiting impatiently for Harry to make the next move.
Once they’re outside, Harry nuzzles closer to Draco. It’s drizzling and cold and Draco doesn’t mind being this close to Harry at all.
Harry nods. “I haven’t made up my mind yet. I don’t know if I like it or not. I mean. I obviously am
Harry shakes his head. “That really doesn’t sit with me. You, out of all people, have a problem getting laid?”
Draco looks up and stares into those emerald green eyes that seem to burn right through his soul. He holds his breath and straightens his back. Act cool, Malfoy. Calm and collected.
” he shouts, hope still simmering inside his stomach. Maybe Draco just went downstairs for a cup of tea? But Harry knows that Draco won’t be in the kitchen. He just knows that Draco apparated away.
He squeezes inside, closer to the sink, and waits for Draco to follow him. He eventually does. The other man closes the door, turns on the lights, and stares at the floor.
Deep down he knows that Harry did the right thing. He challenged Draco, he directly addressed the situation and put Draco on the spot. He put him out of his comfort zone, which is exactly what Draco needs.
“Uff. Okay. I don’t know. I’ve always wanted to be dominant, you know? I envied you for having your shit together all the time. I envied you for being so fucking brave and strong. Hell, I even envied your outbursts of aggression. So dominant and powerful. And sexy. I always wanted everyone to believe that I’m like that, too. That I could be a little bit like you. But I’m really not.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “You uneducated twat. You really don’t know anything about a Veela transformation, right?”
Harry watches Draco for a moment, his heart beating incredibly fast. He really doesn’t deserve Draco.
He gives Lucas his phone and lets him type in his number. Then, Lucas surges forward and presses a kiss to Harry’s cheek. Harry’s eyes open in surprise. They exchange one last smile and say goodbye. Easy enough.
Under normal circumstances, Harry would not have approached Draco Malfoy. He would've just left him be. But this is not a normal circumstance. Malfoy looks worried, he looks hurt, he looks as if he is in major pain.
Harry feels nauseous. Being close to Draco doesn’t make him feel better. It’s quite the opposite. Fuck, he looks
His eyes are sparkling dangerously, and he struggles to control himself, anger and adrenaline mixed with his buzzing, fuming magic running through his veins. “I said get the fu–“
Draco seems like a child. He listens carefully, takes notes when things get too complicated for him, he nods and mumbles incoherent words, he stares at the screen in confusion and fascination and Harry wants to kiss him. God, he wants to kiss him and tell him how much he needs him in his life. How could Harry ever think he could just be friends with Draco? Draco, the most handsome, sweet, intelligent, funny, adorable man he has ever met!
“Harry”, Draco shouts and arches his back. “Fuck- I - oh Merlin - do that again - don’t stop - please - I need -“
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Neville sighs. “She’s a big diva. This girl needs so much attention. But I don’t have the time to give her what she needs. That’s why she’s behaving like a bitch. Please don’t tell Molly. She’s going to kill me.”
Draco remembers Harry's lips on his neck and his hands on his body. Just the thought of it could make him cum on the spot. Draco fights against these images and tries to empty his mind. This is
Draco only nods, eyes squeezed shut in pain and shoulders shaking. “I can’t put into words how much.”
Harry rolls his eyes and presses his lips against Draco’s forehead. “I could stay like this forever.”
Even though Draco isn’t finished yet, his hair already looks better. Draco manages to style it into a neat, Hollywood worthy quiff.
“I’m sorry for what happened at the club. If I had known that we would stop talking for a month afterward, I never would’ve let that happen.”
His right-hand moves lower and he eventually grabs Harry’s dick. He begins to stroke him slowly, making Harry’s jaw go slack and his mouth drop open. Little grunts are coming out of his throat, and Harry already sees stars at the sensation, and he doesn’t know how long he will last this time.
“Draco, for God’s sake! I’ve known you my entire life and I’ve seen you in and out of relationships and your eyes have never lit up like they do when you talk about Harry!”
Draco gathers his things and puts them back inside his bag, turns off all the electricity and grabs his coat. The moment he looks up, he notices a beautiful raven-haired boy with cute glasses and impossible green eyes. Draco's breath catches in his throat and he’s mesmerized.
So, Harry does. He listens carefully to Draco, breathing in and out and tries to match his rhythm. At first, he feels himself getting lightheaded. But then, he’s slowly starting to relax.
Harry presses a kiss to Draco’s forehead. “You don’t have to be anything but yourself. You have to be true to yourself and do whatever makes you feel good. And I’m here for whatever that might be. Okay?”
“I wanted to touch you the second we left Hogwarts”, Harry admits. He knows he’ll regret this once he’s sober, but he can’t stop now.
Neville sits on the chair in front of the little desk and pulls back the blanket that was covering a big, bright yellow plant. Then, he begins to gently stroke her and whispers sweet things to her.
