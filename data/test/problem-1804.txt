,,DO IT! or it will be you, who takes his place!“ the voice of the man that had been like a plague to his dreams the last two years, followed him through the corridors of the school. It felt like he was right behind him, whispering those words that he had threatened him with on this dreadful day.
,,We found the one you were searching for“ he said, grinning as he took a step to the side and revealed a face that Draco recognized immediately. Luna Lovegood, a Ravenclaw he had seen often walk around barefoot and in search of something. Crabbe, Goyle and him had once found her outside in the snow, peacefully watching a bird in the tree and decided it would be funny to throw a snowball at the bird just to see her reaction. As the tears began to fall they had only laughed at her and called her a crybaby because the bird wasn’t even hurt. Now the look on her face was one of fear, one where the spark that had always been in her eyes had gone. Draco remembered how much he hated that spark and wished for it to be gone but now as it seemed to have lost it’s shining grace, he was filled with shame. Bellatrix grinned maliciously and ordered the snatchers to lock her away to the old man downstairs. Even though there were many scary figures around her, Luna’s eyes were set onto Draco’s, who had long ago lowered his head and starred down at the carpet. He just couldn't look at her and see this eyes, begging him to help her. As the snatchers had gotten their reward and left and Draco had wanted nothing more than run back to his room and hide away from it all, he appeared. The one everyone waited for and as soon as he apparated into the room, they all bowed down deeply. Draco was frozen and his mother used her wand to make him bow down. If he thought he had known what fear and panic felt like before, he surely knew now how wrong he was. A cold shudder run through his whole body and he tried his best to steady his legs, that seemed to want to give up in this very moment. He had not seen much of his face but it didn’t matter because his whole presence radiated a dark energy that would make every serial killer look like a sweet child.
,,Your father, he is on his way“ finally Draco's whole attention laid on her, his eyes wide open, surprised by the news he just had been told ,,Yes, you brought him back, son“ her face was practically glowing with pride she felt for knowing it was all thanks to their son that they could be reunited again soon ,,I am so proud of you“ he let himself be embraced in her arms but he felt nothing. Should he not be happy that his mother was proud and his father on his way back home? Finally, his father would recognize him as a real man, a son he was supposed to be proud of. That’s all he ever wanted, right? So why did he felt so out of place? ,,The dark Lord, who knows, might even forgive your father for his mistakes and we will be back in his favor. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?“ she lifted her sons head up with her hand and tried to look right into his eyes, trying to find that spark she was trying to lighten up ,,We can go back to the way, things were before“ she gave him a kiss on the cheek and Draco finally gave her a light smile, a heavy contrast to his haggard features and empty eyes. She was right, he should be proud. He finally made his parents proud and if they would be given the chance to prove their loyalty once more towards the dark Lord because of him than it was something to be very proud of.
The looks they gave him went from surprise to disgust, to hate. He was sure he heard one girl whispering how he could dare to come back after all he had done and just like he learned growing up, he held his head high and went through the crowd, radiating a cold elegance as if he was untouchable. When he found an compartment that was empty, he sighed relieved and put the black bag, he hold onto as his luggage was being stored somewhere else, beside him. Nimensi, his black cat took her rightful place on his lab and enjoyed the sporadic strokes of her owner, who was trying to avoid looking at anyone. Ten minutes later, the train came into movement and slowly left the platform behind them.
So, this is a Drarry story as the tags have probably already said and it's gonna be a story that goes on quite slowly. I want to make the change between Harry and Draco realistic and therefore it's gonna take some time until the two will actually come close to being friends, so it will be one of this slow burn stories. If you are still up for it, then I hope you will enjoy this chapter and make you want to read more. I will try to set a date for an update every week in the coming days. This story contains some heavy subject's, so if you are sensitive for that please do not read it. Well, I don't wanna talk (write) too much, so I'm just gonna stop here and wish you have a good time with the first Chapter of hopefully many more ^-^
,,And I know it was you, who paid that girls hospital bills“ finally he looked up from the ground, a surprised expression lingering ,,Her parents....they were muggles, working jobs that didn’t gave enough to pay for the medicine that was needed. Her mother, she couldn’t eat or sleep properly anymore and she begged madam Pomfrey to let her stay the night. After she had fallen asleep at the bed of her daughter, I saw how you put the gold beside the bed“ he was taken aback by the realization that she had approached him, not out of a mood but because she had thought about it for months. She had seen him, Draco Malfoy who was known for hating mixed bloods of all kinds, save the life of a muggleborn girl.
,,It’s not like I wanna do this work with you either“ Harry had said, when they left the office and Draco had told him to stay away from him as far as possible ,,Let’s just agree to pretend like the other isn’t there, okay?“ ,,As if Saint Potter could ever pretend he doesn’t exist“ ,,Only once, please! Can you only once just stop being such a dick?!“ ,,What did you call me?!“ Harry rolled his eyes, clearly not in the mood to deal with Malfoy’s annoying behavior that he had been used to for many years now ,,Why did I decline the offer of getting away“ he muttered to himself but Draco had heard him and chuckled scornful
Suddenly he was being pushed to the ground and the spell broke.  When he teared the bag from his face, he was met with darkness. No living soul seemed to be out here and for a moment he questioned if he had hallucinated it but it was clear that he didn’t. He couldn’t see anything at all and he didn’t had his wand with him, so he closed his eyes concentrating on the magic inside him that could be used without a wand. It was something that you learned way later in life and not everyone managed to produce the magic so fast but his father had made sure that when Draco came to school, he would already be ahead of everyone else and right now he was thankful for it.
Who or whatever it was, that scrapped off the scales of the unconscious mermaids, had done it at least a dozen times and it seemed so brutal, Harry felt sick. Draco looked at the others sorrow filled face, wondering what his own expression looked like. Harry inspected the cave and two minutes into it, in between the scales he found a unusual amount of seeds and dead bugs. ,,Looks like a storage of food, which means-“ ,,someone is living in this hole, smart guess“ Draco interrupted him with a sarcastic tone and rolled his eyes. After Draco found a few pieces of black fur, he chuckled at the fear they had felt upon what could be living here ,,Niffler“ he said and Harry turned to him ,,What?“ ,,It’s the cave of a Niffler“ ,,Niffler?“ ,,Are you ever paying attention in class? Niffler, black fur, long snout, love shiny objects?“ ,,...but they are harmless“ Harry said after he remembered the class of Professor Kettleburn in third year ,,They would rather be eaten by the mermaids....unless-“ ,,-there is someone giving it to him“ Draco finished his sentence and Harry nod ,,Yeah, but who or better what?“
The students starting running in every direction and Draco who had been still standing on his spot felt a hand grabbing his own and dragging him away from the field, the charm that held Blaise in place disappearing. Astoria used her wand to make the trees bend so they could run through the small forest without needing to be careful not to trip over something or crash against a tree. After a long minute of running they came to an stop, their heavy breathing the only sound heard in the dark ,,That was close“ said Astoria grinning in between breaths and pushed her messy hair out of her face ,,I guess we should wait a bit before going back“ she sat down on one of the many roots of a tree that had grown their way out to the surface and leaned against the tree. ,,That was quite a scene there“ she said, gesturing towards the Quidditch field that laid somewhere behind the trees, now out of sight ,,You really got no mercy in you,huh?“ ,,What do you mean?“ Draco finally spoke, his voice cold as he took a seat beside her ,,I mean, you did not only defeated him but you humiliated him“ ,,So? It was him, who started it“ ,,Oh and that’s all that little brain of yours can do. He started it and because of that, he deserved everything thrown his way?“ ,,Actually no, he deserved it because he dared to provoke a Malfoy and by the way, ’that little brain of yours‘ ? Was that supposed to be an insult?“ ,,You guys and your awful name you take so much pride in“ ,,You’re just jealous!“ spatted Draco back and Astoria scoffed ,,Jealous of what? Being a dick, who thinks just because he has a famous name, he’s more worth than others. No, thanks!“ somehow did she knew she was crossing a line but honestly, she couldn’t care less. She was so fed up with those opinions she had been confronted with her whole life. Draco got up from the ground and even though, the light from his wand was only enough to lighten up the spot where he stood, she could see the anger in his facial expression ,,I’m not...I-“ confusion mixed into his feelings and he groaned out of frustration ,,You just don’t know what you are talking about!“ she laughed shallow and got up from the ground as well, almost matching the male's height ,,I guess you didn’t recognize me but I’m a Greengrass“ ,,What?“ ,,I am Daphne’s younger sister“
,,We have already met a few times but of course, the great Malfoy does not waste any second on people he can’t win something from“ she sounded a little bit angry about the fact that he did not only didn’t recognize her but never remembered her at all ,,Be careful with your word choice“ he said through gritted teeth and if she wouldn’t have been a girl , he would’ve already put her into her place ,,so what? I’m not afraid of you“ Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment, calming himself down before he would do something he would regret and took a step backwards ,,Just bloody lead the way out!“ he said, not really knowing where she had led them. Once again he followed her out of a forest, this time not thanking her before he stormed away from her when they arrived at the entrance of the castle.
,,Silence, please!" McGonagall's voice echoed through the hall and everyone went quiet. The next ten minutes were spent listening to her encouraging speech about how the event of last year had changed a lot of things and how we should not let our fears get the best our ourselves and for the first time Draco looked around and saw the visible pain in the eyes of his fellow classmates. Very little sparkling eyes were found as they all seemed to remember the horrifying war, where a lot of friends were lost and everything seemed hopeless. A feeling of guilt wanted to creep onto him but he stuffed it back, far into his mind.
,,I’m not a good person“ he finally said with a shaky voice ,,And I never wanted to be one“ he stood up, taking a step forwards, gazing into the sky that was covered in clouds. She wondered if he really believed that.
When Draco lifted his head, he could see the reflection of Rowle inside the bathroom mirror, right behind him, his bloodshot eyes spread wide open and starring at him while he screamed loud enough that Draco felt like his eardrums were going to burst.
I've been wanting to write this fanfiction for a while now but never found the time or motivation for it but it has finally happened! YEY! :D
He couldn’t breath anymore. His throat was closing and he fell onto the ground, trying to hold himself up with his shaking arms. The tears spilled out of his eyes, dropping down onto the clean bathroom ground. He desperately tried to get himself under control but he still heard those screams in his head. In that moment he realized just how much he hated himself. He was never able to stand up against the paralyzing fear inside him. He had seen and done so many things because of it and still he couldn’t fight it. He was a coward and there was nothing he could say to prove himself otherwise. And in that moment he realized just why he hated Harry Potter, the one who was ready to sacrifice himself for all the good causes, so much. Harry Potter was all he never was and never will be. A constant reminder of his own cowardness.
Throughout the day, Draco found himself feeling sick and tired. He wished to have just stayed in his bed the whole day but without a sick note from Ms. Pomfrey, which he doubted he would get, he wouldn’t be allowed to. In the afternoon he went to Hagrid again, wondering what they would do today and when he arrived, Hagrid was about to lock his door ,,Oh, Draco, you’re here“ he put his key in his tremendously big pocket and smiled lightly at the boy in front of him ,,I know you are supposed to be doing your punishments but the discovery of the cave hole and the house elf seems to be more than it looks like and I“ he emphasized the ’I‘ very clearly ,,-was ordered to help in this matter“ ,,Does that mean I can just go back to my room then?“ Draco said, clearly not caring about Hagrids pride ,,Eh, well not exactly. Harry said you two could go back into the forest and collect as much as mermaids scales as you can find....they would like to have them back“ ,,Why? Not like they can just put them back on“ ,,Sometimes, Draco. Things don’t have to be useful to have a value“ his emphatic voice gave the words an intention, Draco couldn’t quite figured out and as he wandered around the forest with Harry ahead, he asked himself over and over what the half-giant meant. If something was of no use, why bother? Distracted by his thoughts time went by quickly and three hours later, their bags had been filled to the brink and float through the air right behind them as they made their way towards the sea. Harry had used his wand to send a signal down into the depth of the dark sea and in a matter of seconds something emerged from the deep and revealed itself as two mermaids. Their expressions carried distrust as they eyed Draco but he could swear a light smile formed on their pale lips when Harry greeted them ,,Hagrid told us, you wanted them back. I guess we missed a few but we tried as good as we could“ ,,Thank you Mr. Potter“ their voices were like whispers close to your ear and made your skin crawl, a feeling neither of them felt like embracing ,,If you don’t mind, what are you gonna do with this?“ Harry asked as if he could read Dracos mind, who was only waiting for the right moment to ask the same
,,Astoria, what the hell are you doing?“ her older sister had stormed their way as soon as she came into the great hall and saw her sister, sitting beside the traitor ,,Eating breakfast?“ she said as if it wasn’t the most obvious thing and Daphne looked between her sister and Draco, unsure of what to say in front of him ,,Can I talk to you for a moment...outside?“ Astoria sighed, showing a slight hint of annoyance before she excused herself and followed her sister outside. Draco was relieved that now, she wouldn’t bother him ever again. At least he told himself that.
"Don't shout!!!"
Potter's raspy voice after who knows how much time reading out loud. Potter pronouncing the words that were carved in Draco's brain after having read them so many times.
"I don't know," he exhaled at last, and it was a confession. A surrender.
The words "Trip to Hogsmeade" had never sounded so wrong.
"Really?"
. More like worried about what he can do," explained Harry. Ron did not stop cringing. Harry wanted to tell him about the breakdown Malfoy had had the previous night, but he didn't think Ron would understand.
"Then what's the point?!" he bellowed, and the random students that were walking around them changed directions. "What is the fucking point of being Harry Potter if I cannot help anyone?!"
"You've been saying that all day, mate. It's not convincing that you think so much," said Ron jokingly, but eyeing him with worry.
Harry didn't know what the hell was going on, but it was terribly uncomfortable.
"What the fuck are you saying? Why would I care about you being close?" And maybe if his voice hadn't sound desperate, Draco would have backed down.
If he hadn't been Albus Dumbledore, Hogwart's Headmaster, and one of the only adults he thought highly of, Harry would have answered very aggressively and inappropriately to remove that condescending smile from his face. But he was Dumbledore after all, so Harry remained quiet.
"What do you mean yours? How can it be yours if its red?" As he spoke, he removed the tie from his neck, and that's when he realised that the tie he had been wearing all day was green and silver. So that's how Ron and Hermione had found out. "I- I don't-"
"Does Harry Potter want Dobby to bring Draco Malfoy here?"
? Merlin help us all."
That's where Potter found him hours later. It was almost night. Without knowing, Harry'd followed Draco's steps and had finally stumbled upon him, in a corner against a tree.
The boy raised his eyebrows, impatient. He was not there for little games, or his mind would start wandering off to far more unpleasant people with far more fascinating eyes.
precise day, after
"Don't worry, Dobby. I will just wait."
He sat down strategically, in the spot that was furthest away from Harry, waiting for their teachers, who were probably looking for each other. They did not say a thing for a while. Some hateful looks were sent across the room, but both managed to not say anything, to avoid the imminent conflict. Harry was very conscious of the Slytherin at the other side of the room. There he was. The smug bastard, seating as if he owned the place. Breathing as if the air around him was not worthy of his lungs.
Potter coughed uneasily, and Draco smiled cynically to the ceiling. "Well, I don't know, Potter. I most definitely have discovered new stuff about you."
Sometimes, Potter was bluntly honest, and Draco never knew what to do with that. Especially because he usually could relate to whatever Potter said, which was frightening on many levels.
Draco woke up in the middle of the night. Where the hell- Right, he was not in the Slytherin dungeons. He was in the room with Potter. Sweet. Wait, what? No, no, no. It was not sweet. It was a detention. Detentions are, by definition, not sweet. He did

"Do you like him?" frowned Hermione in concentration.
"What the hell do you think you are doing, Potter?," sputtered Malfoy.

Potter was still imprisoning him against the wall, and then he got closer to bite his ear and hum: "I don't have all night, Malfoy."
it is basically the personal diary of draco during the sixth year (and it is also a wonderful song)
"Malfoy is awful," he started.
Potter listened carefully with a broken face expression and a trembling lip that Draco deliberately ignored.
"FUCK." That hurt.
"You are bloody right. You are cleaning it this time."
"Of course not!" said Harry. "But you know that this is about learning to stand each other."
Ron hated Mondays. But he hated Harry wearing Malfoy's tie so so
"So no reading today?" Potter asked, shamelessly as well.
"You are not alone in the castle, Mr. Malfoy" replied McGonagall, unimpressed.
Harry didn't reply immediately, not sure about the intention of the Professor's questions anymore.

"Distract me from what?"
? Bloody hell, I cannot believe this. I
"I won't tell you! They are not trophies to show around, Draco. Plus, straight people get mad if you share their "experiments"-"
"What do you want, Potter?" impatiently snapped Malfoy's voice from across the room.
"Does that mean I have to get rid of the chef? Are you willing to say goodbye to Susan?"
Draco hid behind the green curtains on his bed. He was satisfied with how well his plan to distract Potter was going, but it kind of bothered him how they had not done anything that night. And now Potter was showering, naked. The image of that time he had seen his arse and that other time when he had touched it filled his head. Okay, that was enough. Draco was not used to getting a hard-on just because of some thoughts, and it was annoying.
"That's why you didn't complain much about the room thing... Goodness. My poor heart."
Shit.
And Harry was mad.
Draco felt his neck stiff. He didn't nod.
"You don't even care to deny it?"
Draco straightened with confidence.
"I don't want to have anything to do with you, Malfoy!"
Dumbledore's words somehow managed to physically punch Harry in the face.
Draco was left alone with those words echoing in the room.
Potter didn't let go.
"Come on, Malfoy. Please, come with me."
Hermione nodded. It was easy to forget about everything else when Ron's arms were around her.
He remembered Dobby. He called him. After hardly ten seconds, there were plenty of dishes around the room. It was
the first person that crosses you?" he finally answered. And his voice was so quiet, so
"Why, Harry, I thought we were not talking about Mr. Malfoy anymore." Harry felt hot in the neck, and Dumbledore continued speaking. "But if you insist in drawing a comparison, I cannot help but agree. I don't think Mr. Malfoy has no interest in having people around. In that sense, he is more similar to you than he is to Tom. But I must point out that Mr. Malfoy is no longer surrounded by the boys that used to accompany him, Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle."
"I'm going to start picturing all kinds of interesting scenarios if you keep asking me to meet in empty classrooms, Granger."
"The butler? No way, you dirty bitch!"
"Yes, yes, okay, but how to-" said Harry impatiently.
"Of course you don't know. So shut your mouth." Malfoy stood up. He looked taller from the floor. His hands were trembling almost imperceptibly.
And the fact that they hated themselves was not even a strong counterargument. Hermione remembered thinking that Malfoy's badges against Harry during the Triwizard Tournament were a bit over the top. Truth was that Malfoy was always over the top, but with Harry he seemed to go even further. If she didn't know them, she would have given the rivalry they both claimed a second thought. Hell, maybe she wouldn't have been surprised at all. In her head, Malfoy had always been a huge bigot that deserved no second thought, but Harry had always been more flexible in the way he changed his mind about people if they turned out to be decent. And Hermione trusted Harry's gut as much as she trusted her own head.
"And who are the lucky ones?"
When the night finally arrived, Draco was on edge. He felt like an addict without his drug. Not even, more like an addict that could not even consider leaving the drug in question. And it was maddening, that the drug was right there, all around him in that horrible room that had too much red and gold, and he had to
Ron laughed.
"Okay, Potter, you can read out loud. I cannot sleep anyways if you keep turning pages with the delicacy of a mammoth."
"It's my book and you will not ever see it again in your miserable life," hissed Draco, looking at him in the eye without flinching. (In fact, he was terrified.)
"You are fucking mad, that's what you are," he screamed before storming off.
yesterday?" asked Potter. And he was grinning with all his teeth. And he was full of himself. And he radiated pheromones and heat. But there was something desperate in his expression, something that indicated that he was serious. That he needed an answer.
"Well, they kissed and I cannot think of another explanation for
Ron was quite sure of the person responsible of cursing Katie Bell, as well as he reckoned that it was connected to Harry's state of mind. That didn't mean he liked it. Ron was absolutely disgusted and repelled by the fact that Harry was so
"Bye, Potter," Malfoy walked decidedly towards the door, getting away from him. Harry was still laughing when he grabbed his arm, again. Without thinking, like everything he'd said or done in the last hour. Malfoy kept trying to run away from him, how else could he stop him?
Harry wanted to remove his eyes with teaspoons to deal with that terrible, neverending silence.
"I have nothing to say to you, Professor." Draco answered with a straight face, fully knowing that he had never called Severus Professor outside of the classroom. "What I do outside your lessons is none of your business."
Malfoy pinched his leg under the table, and Harry turned to look at him. Malfoy was wearing one of his masks, but his neck was slightly pink. Nothing like it had been in the morning, but noticeable enough. Harry suppressed a smile.
feel gravely offended by the mix-up.
There was nobody he could celebrate with. He barely could feel proud of what he'd done. So a stupid apple had come back. What a thing. Even if he managed to fix the Cabinet, the Dark Lord could kill him in a year because he was pissed at something else. There was no winning. Nothing he did would ever remove that black shadow over him, warranting a life of bad omens. The Dark mark on his arm was going to follow him until the very last day of his life, forever the sign that he belonged to someone else. That his life wasn't really his.
"Merlin, no! Of course not!"
"Mr Potter!" shouted McGonagall once again.
"Well, it didn't, because unlike you, I know what I'm doing."

"Whose? Potter's? You think I'd allow him to leave hickeys on me?"
"It's okay, Potter. It was just a dream. You are safe. Everyone's safe. The weasel and Granger are perfectly fine. The weaslette too. She is fine. They are all alive and well, I promise,' he murmured. It seemed to work, even if it wasn't true. Even if Sirius Black and Cedric were gone.
"Mr. Potter! What are you doing?" hissed Snape, which Ron thought was the final warning for Harry to back off.
WHY. WOULD. YOU. SAY. THAT.
Dumbledore blinked behind his half moon shaped glasses, nodding thoughtfully.
"Oh, right, I didn't tell you. Never, apparently. Yesterday we had a meeting with Professor McGonagall and Snape. And it went badly."
Then, Potter grabbed a wet towel and delicately cleaned his face and neck. Then he stopped. And then he also cleaned his arms and hands. The towel was not soft, but the movements of Potter were. Draco was having a hard time to remain conscious, but it felt like Potter took his time to clean all the visible parts of his skin with the towel. At some point, he also combed his blond hair with his fingers, apparently not minding that his hair was horribly sweaty and dirty.
was disgusting.
"What are you doing in my bed?"
But he was not going to back down, because if he only had the luxury of a single option, he at least was going to get the most out of it.
"I didn't even go to Hogsmeade, Potter! Now let me go!"
"What the hell do you know?"
"Dobby does not want Harry Potter's stomach to explode while awaiting, sir."
Draco breathed in deeply and grabbed his shoulder, firm yet cautious, almost delicate. But Potter did not wake up. He kept shaking, moving uncontrollably around the bed, sensing a presence close to him, and wanting to kick the hell out of it, for harming him and everyone in his life. Draco sat in the bed and managed to block his arms.
As it could be expected, Harry crossed the Hall in less than a pixie's blink and cornered Malfoy against the wall. Hermione and Ron sighed and followed him. Harry was barely two inches away from Malfoy and he was holding him by the collar of the shirt.
Dumbledore looked out dreamily through the window, lost in better times. Harry stood up, understanding that the Headmaster would be of no help if he wanted the detention to end.
"What?"

? The bastard was still drying his hair with the bloody towel, and the water droplets run through his naked chest and stomach. What an image. What a
"Well, okay, yes, but-"
. Not after
"What- What are you talking about?"
It should be illegal, a bloody crime, for Potter to be allowed to say his name like that, lingering so long in the m. It sounded like a curse.
," Malfoy replied, and fuck if it was hard to be serious with Malfoy being so
And Potter was looking at his mouth now. He was looking at his lips as if he wanted to drink from them, as if he wanted to bite them off.
"It's just-" Now he seemed frustrated.
"Shut up and listen. Malfoy is an annoying, disgusting shit that doesn't deserve to have you anywhere close. Blimey, he should be grateful that he gets to sleep in the same room as you do, but he does not deserve it."
,,No thank you for saving your life?“ she said, breaking the eye contact and continuing the way up towards the school ,,I didn’t need your help“ ,,Yeah, right“ she said, rolling her eyes lightly, which earned her a cold look from Draco  ,,We should hurry back before Flinch or his cat sees us“ without another exchange of words, they walked towards the nearest entrance and sneaked through the corridors, hoping that the grant staircase wouldn’t give their presence away. The castle was quite, only light snoring from the people inside the pictures could be heard now and then and they were definitely just as annoyed as Draco had been, when his peaceful sleep was interrupted. One or two hissed angry at them but thankfully made no other sound that could wake one of the teachers or prefects.
,,I just wanted you to know that I’m not angry at you“ ,,I didn’t thought you were“ why couldn’t he ever be honest? ,,Oh okay, well that’s good then I guess“ he nod lightly, making her feel a bit embarrassed for believing that he would care enough about her to worry about her feelings ,,I’ll get going t-“ ,,Do you want to take a walk?“ Draco had blurred out, surprising not only her but himself too but he had no time to regret it as a big smile spread over her lips and she nod, a little life coming back into her beautiful eyes.
The way he had treated the people around him, he could see now just how horrible he had been. He was so afraid of someone thinking of him as weak and leaving him out, that he didn't care about anyone else's feelings and did all he could to protect himself from harm. The voice of his father was still so vivid in his mind, drilling into him that emotions were nothing more than a distraction, a weakness that needed to be overcome and that people needed to fear you because that way, they wouldn't dare to betray you.
Draco felt Harry beside him visibly shifting nervously and chuckled into himself ,,The great Harry Potter, scared of a little black hole“ Harry rolled his eyes, muttering just lightly that he hated small spaces but it seemed as just an excuse for Draco. They continued crawling their way through the dark, their wands the only source of light. They had no idea how far they were down but it seemed to go downwards slightly the whole time and after what felt like an eternity, the small path started to grow, letting them slowly walk straight until it ended up in a cave big enough for them to stand up comfortably. ,,Thats...“ Harry said as they saw the pile of scales, scattered around the whole cave ,,Who could do something like this?“ his voice full of resentment.
,,But don’t worry, this time I won’t let you search for a bleeding unicorn“ he laughed as if it was a memory that was dear but the boys surely remembered being scared for their life’s ,,Well then, we shall not waste time, reminiscing about old times right? Two days ago, one of the Centaur approached me and told me about mermaid scales they have found in the forest“ ,,Mermaid scales? But they live in the sea’s“ ,,Right, Harry. That’s what doesn’t make sense. I went to the sea and Hagiri, one of the mermaids, told me that the past weeks, some of their swarm had went missing and found later on, almost dried out and with their scales scraped off” Harry breathed sharply in  ,,but you see, the traces end at a hole, it’s big but you know-“ Hagrid giggled slightly embarrassed and pointed towards his belly ,,-I might have gained a bit weight the last months“ it wasn’t enough to make Harry laugh but he smiled lightly and told Hagrid that they would love to help him, at which Draco glared at him because he had said ’they‘, including him which wouldn’t be very close to the truth because Draco never liked that giant much. If he would ask himself why, he wouldn’t be sure if he could answer that question.
If he remembered correctly he had potion class now with professor Slughorn who was known for having a dislike towards students who have a lack of punctuality and even though everyone had already found out by yesterday that he was back, the eyes were still on him when he entered the room. He made his way towards one of the empty spots and gave everybody a cold look, who was thinking about saying anything towards him. Much to his own dislike, he saw the two familiar faces of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger on the other side of the room. While Hermione had stolen a few glances at him, Harry hadn’t shown any kind of interest in his arrival and Draco surely had no problem with that. He just wanted to forget that face that had been the reason his whole life turned out like this.
Hellouuu :D Welcome back ^-^
,,Fuck“ he murmured to himself and felt himself panicking. His own source of magic was the only thing he possessed to protect himself from whatever it was that was making his way towards himself but he wondered if he even had a chance. Fear was trying to paralyze him as the light became bigger and the rustle of footsteps, breaking sticks carelessly, closer.
That night, he hadn’t gotten a wink of sleep. The words of the greengrass girl still vivid in his mind, while he was playing with the scale, he had picked up from the ground, between his fingers. She was right. The belief in purity of blood as something of more worth had done so much harm. He wondered, if those beliefs had never existed, would’ve changed it history a lot? His parents weren’t good people, whatever they believed in purity of blood or not but he still couldn’t shake the small possibility of his life turning out very differently if they hadn’t been so blinded by their hatred. He couldn’t understand what made the difference between his parents and him. After seeing all this sorrow, all this deaths and the brutality of the life he had been so ready to throw himself into, he could no longer pretend that the nagging feeling inside him that something felt wrong didn’t exist. His parents, they had been part of the cause for all this sorrow and deaths. He wondered if they ever felt this nagging feeling inside them too and had just chosen to drown it out or if it was never there.
,,You disappoint me, Rowle“ Draco stood beside his mother, in the far back of the hall. He knew what would happen with the man, that had thrown himself onto the ground and begged for mercy ,,Hasn’t it been you, who had shown the old man what will happen to traitors?“ ,,M-My Lord, I didn’t- I would never betray you“ the man, who was able to silence every room without uttering a word and make every powerful man fall to his knees, stood up from the chair, turning away from Rowle towards the crowd of death eaters that were watching the scene ,,Mr. Rowle seems to have fallen to the illusion that he is not a traitor“ his snake like voice echoed through the dead silent room, the only thing heard was the heavy breathing of Thorfinn ,,You“ he pointed towards one of the death eaters, who couldn’t help but quiver at the attention of the dark lord ,,Yes, My Lord“ ,,What defines a traitor....for me?“ ,,Someone who has shared secrets, questioned your authority or has not given his best to accomplish the mission’s that had been ordered, my Lord“ ,,Ah, very good son, very good“ he turned back around to the man on the ground, a shallow apologetic expression on his face ,,And you, Rowle? Do you think you have done your best?“ ,,M-My Lord, I tried my best, I-“ ,,So, you are not saying you haven’t done your best but that your best....isn’t enough?“ his voice darkened at the end of the sentence and sealed the mans fate ,,I guess it’s only fair to the old man and everyone else here, in this room that you have to suffer for your betrayal“ he almost sounded like he was really sorry to inflict pain upon him but the venom that hide behind the words showed the true nature of his and the satisfaction he felt by demonstrating what would happen to anyone, who fell from his grace. Everyone had only waited for the unforgivable curse to end Thorfinns life but as the whole room got silent, Voldemort turned around with a dangerous glimmer inside his purely evil eyes ,,Draco“ he sighed and in a second, a path had formed between the crowd, showing the pale boy whose heart had began to pound so loud that he believed everyone was able to hear it ,,Snape, has taken an opportunity from you to prove yourself, my son“ the dark Lord, took his rightful place on the head chair and looked right into the 17 year old boy’s eyes. He wanted to stay in Hogwarts when the holiday’s had come closer because he knew, what would await him back at his home. To say he was terrified when his mother told him that he needs to come back would be an understatement but he followed her wish and he would need to pay the price for that now.
,,I bet he wants Voldemort to return“ it had been only three days since he had come back to Hogwarts but with the press taunting him the last months, he felt already used to the sporadic insults he would catch in the corridors ,,What do you think, happened with his...mark?“ ,,I g-“ he shut his door forcefully and threw his cloak angrily onto his bed. He looked at his left forearm that was covered in his white blouse and felt the skin beneath itching, absentmindedly drawing little circles. A Scar that would never fade away. He shook the thought away and started undressing, not feeling like giving any attention to his emotions at the moment.
,,My Lord“ he heard the voice of Snape, who seemed to have left the corner he had been hiding in since they left Hogwarts and walked towards Voldemort. Everyone stood straight up slowly again and Voldemort listened to Snape, telling him how Albus Dumbledore had met his end, leaving out one little detail that would’ve revealed that Draco had lowered his wand, way before Snape had come into sight. A bloodcurdling laugh broke through the thick silence and was soon followed by more laughter's of the death eaters, Snape and Draco trying to give at least a halfhearted smile. The dark Lord’s eyes fixated on Draco and he felt his mother beside him tensing ,,Well done, boy. Even though the opportunity to end the life of this disgraceful Wizard yourself was....let’s say, stolen from you, you did very well“ he gave him what probably was supposed to be a grin but it felt more like  he was considering if he should give him to his Snake as dinner. That thought wouldn’t even be that far-fetched. ,,Now” his voice loud and clear ,,bring me the man who dared to betray me“ his voice was ice cold and only seconds later a death eater, named Rowle came into sight, who was pushing a middle aged man in front of him, towards the dark lord. His short gray hair was a mess, the blue eyes full of fear  ,,My Lord“ he had started but was painfully interrupted as Rowle, broke his kneecaps and he fell to the ground with screams of pure pain coming out of his mouth. Draco flinched and wanted to take his eyes off but his mother stopped him from doing so, afraid the dark Lord would see the weakness of her son. ,,Do not dare to speak to the Lord, you pathetic disgrace“ Rowle spatted hatefully and Voldemort closed his eyes for a moment, only disapproving of the said ones behavior ,,No, no Rowle, let the man speak“ the dark Lord kneeled down in front of the pitiful figure that was in so much pain and smiled lightly ,,M-My L-Lord, please“ he begged, tears running down his face ,,I beg you, p-please. M-My kid, h-he“ ,,Don’t worry about your kid“ he interrupted him ,,I will make sure that he will find out how you have tried to save his life. I will“ the man went silent for a moment as if he wasn’t sure what to make of his word but it did not took long before the meaning of the words had sunken in and he started shouting ,,NO, PLEASE! NOT MY KID! NOT MY KID!“ Voldemort only gave a short nod towards Rowle and watched the man merciless crying and shouting when Rowle spoke the unforgivable curse, that caused the one to receive it, to be in a pain that you would never be able to explain. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and tried to block out this horrifying screams that filled the room but to no avail. Those screams would be forever burned into his memories.
,,My Lord, I can do it“ Narcissa spoke but the cold man shook his head lightly ,,Seems like, there are many people who wanna stop you from taking their place in the spotlight but don’t worry boy, this is your time“ the fear in the boys eyes was so clearly brought to the surface that no one would be able to miss it, not even a man who had long ago forgotten what it’s like to feel. Draco moved forward hesitantly until he was right in front of Rowle, who had eyed him from beneath but there was no evil seen in the eyes that had tortured and murdered mercilessly. It all had been drowned out by the terrifying realization that the chance of him, leaving this room was just as low as the chance of Draco coming out alive of this if he would dare to not follow the orders of the dark lord
,,DO IT!“
noticeably annoyed, Draco had almost started a fight with Filch, who only hold himself back because madam Pince had gave him an rebukingly look. He muttered his usual how he wished to have the old days back where the punishments were still useful and led Draco and Harry away from the eyes of the students, to a corner of the library that hadn’t been used since the war and was in a state of utter chaos. Before Harry could say a word, Filch had snatched his wand and grinned malicious ,,No wands“ he hold his hand out for Draco to give him his wand too, which he did unwillingly  with a wish for Filch to just vanish from everyone’s life. ,,enjoy your afternoon“ he chuckled ugly and left the two boys alone, who had been not very happy about the work but were now even more gloomy because without a wand, this would take days to finish.
,,You guys are so ridiculous“ said Daphne as they were sneaking through the empty corridors, with only their wands bringing a little light into the pitch dark night.
,,I will also have my office, always open for any student that needs a listening ear, at any time. So please do not feel like you are alone with what you are going through. In times like this, friendships are dearly need, so please reach out to someone“ the silence was broken by a sudden sob and everyone turned around to the back of the class, where Susan Bone had been sitting in silence until she could no longer keep her composure. Her friend, Riley beside her patted her in a comforting way and asked if they both could leave the class for a moment at which Tregolor only nodded understanding and told Susan to come by his office later. There it was again. The guilt trying to come back because he knew, he was the cause for all this pain but he swallowed it back down and decided to concentrate on the illustration of a werewolf  that filled the front page of his new bought book.
He smirked and played with Zabinis wand in his hand as he took slowly steps towards his opponent, who was getting up from the ground but Draco used the incorio spell and he was being pressed down to the ground again. He crouched down in front of him and hold out his wand, for him to take knowing that Zabini couldn’t move, with the charm holding him down. He laid his wand beside him on the ground, sighing as if he was terribly sorry for the embarrassment.  ,,Take that Crown, be the bloodiest king out here. I don’t care“ Draco shortened the distance between them a bit more and whispered in a not so quiet voice ,,But I swear to you, if you dare to bother me again, I’m gonna make you regret that you didn’t kill me in the forbidden forest“ Draco put his wand back into his inner pocket of his black suit and sighed happily ,,Well then, sorry for the bad show guys“ he said, smiling at the crowd, dusting his jacket. Their faces showed very clearly how disappointed they were that it wasn’t Draco, who was covered in mud and laid on the ground in defeat. ,,Well, then-“ his words were interrupted when a 5th year student came running down the hill, warning them that Professor Flitwick had seen the red light and that he and Mr. Crowly were on their way.
He really didn’t felt like going back to his room now and made his way to the Astronomy tower. He really needed a switch of rooms. This wasn’t going to workout. Draco used a silencing spell, so that the door would fall into it’s lock soundlessly and walked over to the open railing that allowed a heavenly sight in daylight. Now, there wasn’t much to see but the outlines of the castle and the night sky, that was mostly covered in clouds. He had to admit that going back to this place, left a bitter taste on his tongue but apart from the old bathroom, this had always been the only place to help him feel calm but it was also the place, where an innocent man had died not too long ago. A man, whose death was his fault. He wasn’t sure if going to the Astronomy Tower was really him trying to find an escape or him trying to punish himself. He let his head fall against the column on his right side and sighed tiredly, the pain in his back from the fight only now noticed by his consciousness. He moved his hand through his white hair and closed his eyes for a moment. It was his second night in the new school year and both had been more turbulent than they should’ve been. He wondered if it would ever be possible for his life to go back the way it used to be in his first year. At that time, his parents had still protected him from the dark world they both lived in, to an extent, where Draco didn’t had to worry about anything else than, trying to get his grades up so that his parents would be proud. It hadn’t been a very pleasant time too but it was still so much better than what had begun to be his life in his 3rd year, when his father believed he was old enough to hold the responsibility that came with knowing what they had been trying to achieve the last years. Looking back now, Draco couldn’t tell what he had felt when he first found out. Pride, because his father trusted him enough? He was taught to believe, that becoming one of Voldemorts allies was something to feel good about but what did he feel? He sighed frustrated and let his body slide down to the ground slowly, becoming more and more exhausted from the storm inside his head. He really understood what his father meant by saying that emotions were a distraction. Right now, Draco just wished for them to leave him alone, so that he could have a minute of peace.
"Why?"
"Oh, stop it. Stop pretending that you give a fuck."
But you know what was even more mental? The fact that he'd
in case you haven't listened to folklore by taylor swift, there is this one song called "my tears ricochet" that gives me all the drarry vibes (in general it seems to me like a very accurate song for enemies to lovers to enemies dynamics)
"Would you, though?" asked Ron accusingly.
"I just thought it would be more entertaining to talk than staying silent, okay? But you are right. It makes no sense and you are of no use. Not even as a distraction."
"Don't call her that, you racist bastard! And they know because of your obvious staring!"
Malfoy came out of his bath looking like a new person. At least, with his green silk pyjamas and the healthy pink blush in his face, he resembled his past elegant aristocratic self.
"So what? You are awake."
"Be quiet, mate, this is serious."
Anyways, he was tired. And Malfoy not being there gave him time to take a hot bath. It had been a very stressful day, now that, somehow, both Ron and Hermione knew that something was up. After thinking about it the whole day, he still did not know what was he going to tell them. The only conclusion he had arrived to was the fact that he could never again get close to Malfoy. No more kissing, no more hidden looks, no more worrying about Malfoy's health. Maybe if he was able to stay away from him for a very long time, one day he would be able to understand what the hell had those days been, and what had happened, and why, and when.
"It's not the same! Malfoy is not alone! He has friends, and he has his parents."
Malfoy had long left, as he discovered when he finally got up. When he opened the curtains of his bed, the blinding light announced that it was late, extremely. It likely was the last sunny day there would be in the Scottish highlands for a while. Harry knew that Ron and Hermione were probably waiting for him to tell them all about the horrible experience of spending the night with Malfoy, but he decided to take a bath. Truth was that there was not much to say.
The worst part was that he was supposed to hope for the end. McGonagall had said one more week. Only one more week. It was nothing. And then he was free. Free to be the Death Eater he was meant to be. What a perspective.
"Stop trying to change the topic!" Potter roughly grabbed his chair and turned him back again, blocking Draco between his body and the table. They were face to face again, although now they stood closer. Draco hated to be sitting down, it gave all the power of the momentum to Potter when he was the one that was being pathetic, for once. "You did not tell me what is it that drew you away from Quidditch. And don't dare to say that you are good with not playing Quidditch. Because whatever it is that you think is more important, I know it's also the reason why you don't sleep, and why you did not even think of that essay before today."
? Who the fuck are you?"
Harry hated the nightmares. They drained all his energy during the night and, when the morning finally arrived, they made the process of waking up harder and harder every time, especially because the real world was in no way better.
"What do you mean
"I don't know. It's what I said, he didn't really explain. Well, he did tell me that he was horny and I was near, or something like that."
"I'm not going anywhere," replied Potter lightly. "Unless you need me to bring anything. Like liquids. Or medicine. Yes, medicine is probably more useful than liquids. I can run to the hospital wing and bring you some-"
"ARE YOU DEAF? WAS IT YOU?" yelled Harry, grabbing him by the shoulders and shaking him. He needed a reaction. He needed him to shout back. He desperately needed him to say
"Do you still think that he is a Death Eater?" whispered Hermione.
"What are you talking about?!"
Malfoy was not having dinner with everyone else.
"Of course you did," retorted Malfoy, positioning himself on guard and pointing his wand at him.
"He takes every chance he gets to insult us. He has always thought he is better because he has money. And he has told really bad stuff to 'Mione."
"Isn't it a bit dangerous to get fresh air at the Forbidden Forest?"
And it was not easy, not only because they shared a room, but because Potter was the most obnoxious, notorious, gigantic prick everywhere he went. And he could not see any further than his own ass. And he did not know how to take no for an answer. And he was now making all kind of noise with the sole purpose of pissing him off.
"What do you mean?"
He knew it was late. His body was exhausted and he had not eaten anything since Friday night. He did not feel the hunger, though. The only thing he felt was the stomach ache that had attacked him the moment Potter's mouth had touched his. Draco was sure it was infectious. Some kind of Gryffindor
"Yes, I guess. So what?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Potter! Get it over with!" he shouted despite himself, hoping that, perhaps, if he waited for him to go to bed, he could sneak out of bed and take some leftovers without him noticing. There was no way Potter was going to finish everything by himself.
"Because that's how fucking conversations go, Malfoy!" Harry grabbed his other arm and did not let go. Their gazes locked and daggers flew from the green to the silver eyes, back and forth. "The point of a fucking question is to get a fucking answer!"
"Wow, Potter, who knew you could be so sexist? What would your mother say? The poor woman,
"Give it back!" shouted Potter poorly attempting to reach for it, but Draco was not letting go. He could not process what he had in his hands. The degree of detail was beautiful. The
Although he had thought that by sharing a room they would end up tearing each other's heads, truth was that the current situation had ended up being some kind of truce. They did not talk much, and when they did, it was not the usual cruel bickering and arguing. And he missed that, the image of Malfoy, his arch-nemesis. It was a much easier to process image, one that he knew very well, thanks. He did not know the Malfoy that went to sleep too late at night, or the one that did not eat, or the one that seemed to not give a fuck about his studies. He did not know how to deal with Malfoy when he was not his cocky and bitchy self, so he hoped that facing him in the field would bring back some of the power and self-esteem that had always been a part of him.
Then the fake Potter touched his back, and the touch was real. And Draco felt Potter's touch as an electric shock.
"You are so obsessed with me that you dream that I stare at you," sneered Draco, his face red and hot in anger.
"So you have not fought at all during the past weeks?" questioned McGonagall.
He really did not want to confront him, but he needed sleep. He needed to get his shit together. He had lost a whole day because of his dumb brain reproducing with unnecessary detail the reason why he now probably had some deathly virus eating him alive. Draco knew that if he went back to their bedroom, Potter would still be awake. Because that's what he did. Have dinner at midnight and breakfast at four AM. But what if what had happened was enough for Potter to avoid him for the rest of their lives? Maybe his neuron had been able to understand that it was much better for the sake of their sanity to avoid each other. Maybe, this one time, Draco would be able to go to sleep without having to speak to him. Maybe?
"You look good," he said, without thinking. Malfoy rolled his eyes in response but there was the tiniest of smirks pulling the corner of his lips. "Are you feeling better?"
"What do you think we are here for,
"Well, you know," she started, "the part where you were looking him in the eye, like two inches apart, ignoring all of us and getting closer and-"
"Potter, I am really not in the mood to put up with your crap. It's just a simple cleaning spell. It will barely take you two seconds."
Harry blinked like he was not really following, and Ron looked queasy.
. Malfoy had always been obsessed with Harry, and maybe it was not that big of a stretch to think that the obsession was... Well,
It was not easy.
"Oh, shut up! I don't even know why I am surprised. The Great Harry Potter, his hero complex so big that he invades people's lives like
There he was, eyes open, looking at the ceiling, still shaking a bit from his nightmares. Waiting. (For what? To spontaneously die and let his pathetic existence come to an end?) (He didn't want to die, he didn't think so. But oh, how did he want it to end.)
"What? Of course I don't! In what universe would I ever like Malfoy?"
He looked like he was about to cry, and Hermione was very bad at dealing with people that were about to cry.
Of course he could not go to the Hospital Wing.
"I know, Malfoy is a disgusting shit. I am expecting a very good reason for Harry to like him."
"If Mr. Malfoy promises to wake you up and make sure you are okay, maybe we can put some kind of silencing charm in the room."
"Don't ask me. She will kill me if I take away from her the first real conversation with you in weeks."
He had to get out of there. He didn't care if anyone saw him leave the Room of Requirements.
Harry watched as he drank the whole thing avidly. Obviously, Malfoy did not thank him, not even close, but he breathed out a satisfied sigh. Although sick Malfoy was an annoying prick, it was the first time that he was not completely pushing Harry away, and the way he called him, Potter this, Potter that, he was
. He was doing it on purpose. He was
"Yeah, right, because it should
"Cut that shit, Malfoy. No one has seen you in the entire day. You didn't go to dinner. You arrive now with that face, as if you just encountered Death itself."
"Don't make it more complicated, Draco. Now, follow me."
When Draco literally could not find anything else to clean, he gathered enough strength to leave the toilet.
"You are impossible, Malfoy. If we were friends," Harry said without thinking, passing his arm over Malfoy's shoulders, "I would hold you closer, you know."
"Read me something, Potter," Malfoy ordered, with his eyes closed. And Harry was surprised. This was a new kind of demand, not directly related to him being ill, and for some reason, it did not feel the same as when he had asked for a glass of water.
Draco was working on the Vanishing Cabinet, but his mind was far away, reading over and over the letter his mother had sent him. He hated to think of her alone in what had been their home, but was now just a building, too cold and too big. He hated that she was living with Him. He hated what they would do to her if he was not able to fix the cabinet. She had told him in the letter to not worry about her, that she trusted him and that she would do anything for him. And Draco hated that "anything" was so little because no one can offer their unconditional support when they are hostages in their own house. He hated that it was up to him to do "anything" for her.
"Really? I can't remember- Did I say anything?"
"I'm good, Potter," he squealed nervously, which made Potter stop. Good. "I don't need your heroics, I'll survive. You can go back to whatever you do on a normal day."
His legs hurt. He was crumbling. But he kept running. Through the corridors. Down the stairs. Outside the Castle. Across the fallen leaves and the dirt. To the forest.
"Are you sure? I would personally be puking all around if I had to share a room with that Slytherin scum," said Ron, sympathetically patting his back.
"Are you in a rush?"
"That's not what you said last night," he replied half asleep, not moving one bit.
"What do you mean
Draco snorted. Wasn't it obvious?
"You are not saying that the problem is that they are both guys, right?"
do you understand?"
He ran. And ran. And ran. Without track. Just desperately wanting to escape.
So that was it. The reason of his death was going to be kissing Harry Potter.
"Not one, can you? Not one single day can pass without you acting weird and ruining everything."
The fake Potter was now kneeling next to where he was curled up in a ball of shuddering body parts. Draco managed to look at him. He was as stupidly and as casually good-looking as the real Potter. What was new was his concerned expression. The actual Potter was not able to conjure complex emotions such as concern.
"Can I do something to help?"
Draco moved his hand away. Potter's closeness burnt. And he tried to step back, but Potter grabbed his arm, and Draco was not surprised. Merlin. When had that become acceptable. Potter grabbing his arm. Potter grabbing his waist. When had it become the
"Do you remember the first time we went to their room? How Harry acted all weird and basically sent us back to Gryffindor?"
"What is this really about, Parkinson?"
Draco had his arms on both sides of Potter's head, and his whole body was inclined against him, although not touching him yet. All in Potter's face shouted "do it". His green eyes shined intensely and they did horrible things to Draco's insides. One second they melted his guts, and the next they made him so hard it hurt. Potter did not know what to answer, but he licked his lips. He was telling him that he was not going to give in.
"Like physically close."
When they arrived at Snape's office, the professors were already waiting for them.
"Forget it. If it's too much trouble for you, just forget it." Malfoy always talked to him with at least annoyance and at most hate, but this was a different register, more like reticence. Nervousness. Harry was probably going crazy. "I just thought you could be civilised enough to exchange two words with someone you will apparently be seeing until we graduate," Draco said, ignorant of Harry's inner turmoil.
. Who did he think he was? Arching an eyebrow at
and other chaotic enchantments. Draco had to listen to freaking explosions and to objects breaking and flying around, before he decided that it was enough and he mustered up enough patience and internal calm to face him.
"Fuck, Malfoy!"
Potter, soaked in sweat and tears, his hair sticking to his forehead, his scar almost coming out of his head. His face was contorted in a way that was as unbearable to watch as the screams were to listen to. Perfect hero Harry Potter was not looking so perfect anymore. He looked rather broken. Broken and messed up. The specific part of Draco's chest that he did not know existed hurt again, with renovated bitterness.
He was lost. Alone. Lonely. Hurt.
. It felt privileged to have a bath when in Gryffindor they had to share showers that not even the house-elves were able to keep completely clean. It felt splendid to soak the warm and perfumed water.
"You keep insisting on meddling in my life. It's like a pathology, which is curious given how much you claim to not care."
expression of the previous night? Is that how he lived? Waking up obscenely early and not going to sleep until way past midnight? Had he even noticed the bath or had he just hurriedly showered not to lose any of his precious seconds? No wonder he always seemed to have something stuck up his ass.
There was a line. And if he had not crossed it when he had tried to send him on the train back to London, he had done it now. One thing was physical abuse, he was used to that after living with the Dursleys. But those fucking words. With that fucking tone. They still echoed in his head.
NO. Shut up, for fuck's sake.
Harry hated him. If he wanted, he would be able to make a list in a two mile parchment with all the things he hated about Malfoy. And yet, when Malfoy said
"You have?"
"Fuck you! Are you even listening to yourself? Voldemort has been ruining my life since I was one, Malfoy!"
"What's going on, mate? It's been ages since I last saw you outside of class. 'Mione was all worried," said Ron. He did not bother to close his mouth while chewing. All the contents (toast and fruit and the little sweet cakes) were visible.
"Last year I had this dreams about Voldemort, as if I was inside his head, so I would know if someone was in danger-" Potter suddenly stopped talking as if he'd just remembered who he was talking to. "Never mind."
"Sh, it's okay," said Potter instead, with a soothing and surprisingly sweet tone. "Malfoy? Hey, it's okay." Potter passed an arm around his shoulders and started walking him to his own green bed. "We are not doing anything, alright? You are okay. Come on, lay down, it's your bed." Draco did as ordered because he would have done anything that Potter wanted as long as he asked with that voice. "Good. Now sleep. I'll leave the book right here."
Potter reached for him, as if he wanted to touch him, and for a very small second, a wicked corner of his head convinced Draco that it would be very easy to pretend that he was still feverish and delirious, so that he could keep that obliging and awkwardly helpful version of Potter around.
That was clearly a trick question. Answering that they could not bear it longer meant more detention, but answering "as long as necessary" was a
Bloody brilliant.
"I wanted Harry to tell us. I haven't talked to him at all, which actually makes sense. I would not be able to tell anybody that I like Malfoy."
"You are so obsessed that you don't even notice everyone watching how you gaze at me as if I was the fucking moon!"
"You really are the brightest witch of our generation, aren't you?"
Harry was furious. He was scared. Disgusted. Rabid.
"Why would you care?" he replied, squinting at him suspiciously.
Draco did not blink. He basically threw himself at Potter, reaching for the parchment quickly. Potter desperately shouted something that sounded like "Mischief Managed", but he was too late. Draco gave his back to Potter while he unfolded the enchanted artefact. It was huge, and it was full of dots and squares and labels. Names. The names of Hogwarts rooms, of Hogwarts students. Every single one of them. Dumbledore in his office. His Slytherin friends silently resting in their dormitories. It was a map. A magic map of the Castle. And it was gorgeous. An incredible and magnificent product of the most complex of magics, portraying every corner of the School's grounds, and the location of every single one of its inhabitants. How was it possible? How could Potter have something like that?
"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT, POTTER?!"
"Whatever, Potter. Be gone." But Potter sat down beside him, with an expression of
He also was an annoying roommate. The prick had left some dinner for him every single night of that week. As if he had some saying in what Draco ate or stopped eating. And he kept having noisy nightmares that would interrupt the little hours of sleep that he got himself. It was insufferable that he got to be the victim of a ridiculous amount of tragedy and misfortune, while Draco himself had to
"Don't interrupt me when I am speaking. As I was saying, the curse can go unnoticed, so it is useful to cast it non verbally. Now, I guess you have no clue how to do that, so let's practice verbally first."
"Leave. Me. Alone." Malfoy hissed, not backing down, not even a bit. "Stop pretending that you care. It's low even for you."
"You have never ever even been close to do such a thing, dear. I would say that it will probably be harder for you to ignore Potter than whatever You Know Who wants from you, but you'll manage."
Snape, clueless of what happened in his students' heads, was giving the lesson as usual.
"Really?"
Without asking for permission, Draco grabbed a dish that was still intact, some kind of stew. Only an expert observer would have been able to say that he was impatient and kind of eager when he put the fork in his mouth and
"Only if you are blind, Potter."
"Cut the crap. I don't care about all the filth you've come up with to excuse the fact that you liked it, I am talking about the moment when you actually kissed him. Where did that come from. And don't you dare say that shit of you being horny, because if it had been about you following your dick's desires, it would have happened in Third Year."
Malfoy kept staring at him, and Harry self-consciously cleaned his mouth with the back of his hand. And then again with a napkin, because he saw a weird twinkle in Malfoy's eyes, which probably meant that he was about to make a joke at his expense.
"I think you already got enough hurtful shit in that nightmare of yours. I guess you don't need more from me."
because of you, you miserable-"
"You have- What the
He hid in the bathroom. Leaned against the door as soon as he was alone.
"And did he actually swear it?" said Hermione frowning. It sounded nothing like Malfoy to swear something just because he was asked nicely.
Malfoy didn't answer, just stared at him with nothing in his eyes.
"Not happening. Not now," he replied sharply, and he proceeded to get under his blankets and close the curtains.
Where Bell was.
Silence.
Draco glared furiously at him, but he did not speak. He did not shout. The only way to get rid of Potter was to ignore him. But Potter was determined, and he could feel Draco's arm shivering under his touch.
He opened the door of the bathroom, he turned on the lights and saw Malfoy having a bath. Harry screamed. Malfoy, who had been laying with his eyes closed peacefully, jumped in his spot and stood up, completely terrified. He was fully naked.
"Thanks, Potter, but I don't want your pity," Malfoy said glacially.
"What do you mean why?" he snapped. "Because it's weird to eat in silence, Potter.'
"Well, I don't know, okay?" replied Harry, trying as hard as possible to be rude so that they would leave him alone. "It's not as if it's new that I fight with Malfoy."
Draco was left alone. In between a flooded bathroom and a room with the floor full with food.
together, but she was not surprised. Only disappointed.
Harry realised, probably too late, that Malfoy was having a panic attack. And he didn't know what to do with it.
"Leave it, Potter. And go away. You are sweaty and smell horrible."
Malfoy, who had spent all the past days not touching his homework and sneaking around at unearthly times to who knows where.
"Where did you get the testimonies from?" questioned Malfoy, with a nauseated grimace that honoured his mother's.
Once in the bathroom, he discovered Malfoy's toiletries neatly arranged in one of the two shelves next to the sink. All the products, whatever their purpose was, were of the highest quality.
Draco had never been an isolated kid. He had always had access to all kinds of books at the Malfoy Manor, and he had read them all because he had always enjoyed having all the information and perspectives. So that he could judge and act accordingly. And in spite of it, he had never questioned the righteousness of his parents. Even in the face of what people said. His father had said it was envy, jealousy, resentment because they were better in every way. And he had believed it. He had preached it, on the basis that it was not his fault that he was better.
Harry nodded in agreement, providing far less encouragement than he normally would. He grabbed some breakfast for himself. He was starving.
"Potter! Move!" he ordered unsuccessfully. He was feeling vulnerable, and Harry knew that was not a feeling he was used to.
"None of your business," he replied hastily, focusing on the angry commands in his head that sounded awfully like Pansy:
"Of course you are welcome, Herms. But it's past midnight, and it is a school night."
"Malfoy? What-?"
"Same thing," he dully answered. Draco rolled his eyes upon such lack of originality. He was not expecting any better, but at least some effort.
"Is everything alright, Harry?" asked Dumbledore.
Harry did as ordered and swallowed. Did Malfoy just- Had he- Was that an
Draco hated to be alone. Alone with himself. It was disgusting to be left with such a despicable excuse of a person. He despised himself.
"And you think you do?" asked Harry mockingly. Malfoy squinted at him from behind his emotionless mask. "Controlling and hiding you emotions are different things, prince."
After some failed struggles to make Potter leave, they ended up laying facing each other. It was Draco's bed, he sure as hell was not going to leave
So he focused his eyes on the water. Malfoy must have been laying there for a long time, because there were almost no bubbles left. He had probably fallen asleep in the water, which explained the lights being off. Harry was not looking at him, but he sensed Malfoy moving and grabbing some bath robe to cover his body. Thank God.
"Potter...," Draco warned him, despite himself. Once again, Potter ignored him.
, stop playing the caged lion?"
"If you want to call it like that," he said, ignoring Potter's hand. "But we are not friends, Potter. I hate you. I will pretend so well that you might end up doubting it, but I hate you, and I will always hate you. If Snape or McGonagall ask, I will say that I have learnt to stand you and to bear with you, that you have taught me new ways to see the world, but it obviously won't be true, do you understand?"
Everything went silent while Harry managed to compose himself. He picked his wand from the floor. His clothes and his hair were a mess, and all his body hurt after crashing against the wall, but he was not planning to show it. Malfoy did not lose any time and left with theatrical big steps. Harry went after him, fuming.
McGonagall still wasn't there and Snape barely raised his eyes from what he was reading. The professor faintly nodded towards the desks, a gesture Draco promptly noticed and followed by sitting down. Harry, not as used to the subtlety of the teacher's movements, was not fast enough.
"You would be asking Draco to risk everything! You would be asking me to do the same thing!"
"Did you have lunch today?"
. Harry could not understand how Malfoy always managed to do simple stuff in such an unnervingly
"So I cannot shut you up," said Potter, making fun of him.
"Harry, please," almost begged Hermione.
"Right," said Draco uncomfortably, and Potter finally dropped his arm. "So goodnight."
"Aren't you too tired?" Potter smiled cheekily, and Draco's gaze did
"Wow, Parkinson. Didn't know you were this kind of person."
Draco screamed when he heard. Screamed is in fact an understatement. It was more like he broke in half. As if a part of his soul had left his body in a howl. If someone had heard, he probably would have hurt them for life. Like he had hurt Katie Bell.
"So? It was him?"
But of course, Potter could not just accept that they'd wanked together, made each other cum, and fell asleep in the same bed, and move on. Because Potter was a pathetic and sappy being who, on top of everything, happened to come up with the dumbest of ideas.
Potter laughed under his breath and Draco caught a glimpse of his chest shaking in the dark. When the laughter died out and turned into a comfortable silence, Draco thought that comfortable silences were kind of their thing. Potter and Draco had learnt to share a lot of comfortable silences since they'd started sharing a room.
"Easy, Potter," he groaned as the gryffindor bit his neck. "Don't leave any marks."
Harry stood up, fuelled by the impatience and the nervousness of a whole night and a whole day waiting for that moment. He was not attempting it to be an aggressive move, but Malfoy flinched and glared at him. Not that he cared. Malfoy was a jerk.
"Sorry, sorry," he mumbled. "I was just thinking."
"So? What do you think? You say you are so good at controlling your feelings, can you control the hate?"
"Hey, mate, are you okay?" asked Ron, eyeing him worriedly.
"What? Of course not!"
thank you for reading!! <3<3<3<3<3
Draco was perfectly conscious of how weak his position was. There were
"You started it," he grunted miserably.
"Doesn't matter, Ron! Harry's sexuality is totally not relevant. Focus! What have we been discussing about Malfoy all these past days?"
"Oscar Wilde? Really?"
They entered the room.
And that was when Draco realised. He realised that Potter had completely forgotten about Katie Bell. The previous day, he had kissed Potter to distract him. He would have never thought that the distraction would last so long. And much less that Potter would be willing to
He stared at Harry expressionless until it got uncomfortable.
"Fuck! Stop it!" Draco yelled, pushing Potter again. However, this time he did not manage to move him much, which was probably related to how weak and shaky his body felt all of a sudden.
"Okay, then. So I go first."
"What does it look like?" retorted Malfoy. He stood back up with the little dignity he had left. Harry tried to offer his hand, like an idiot. Malfoy patently rejected it, with what would have been a murderous look if it had not been for the lettuce in his hair. He ran to the bathroom.
How could he do that when Potter had gone and dreamt dirty stuff about him, shouted his name in the middle of moans and other sounds that were never going to leave Draco's brain? And he'd done it after explicitly telling him that he did not want more sex with him. And then he'd gone and talked about how big of a hero he was saving people from the homicidal man that Draco worked for, which was completely un-requested information. And now Draco had to deal with that. And then ignore it. Which was really hard when he was standing in the middle of a room that was half Potter's.
Harry looked at him, evaluated his proposal. For a second, he considered acting like a grown-up, but he ended up lifting his chin and continued pacing.
"Mmmmalfoy."
"Why are you scared then?" Harry's voice was so low it was hard to hear. Maybe it was him that was scared.
The curtains of the red bed were shut close, and Draco heard how the disgusting prat was snoring. He turned on the lights to change to his pyjamas. And maybe because he didn't mind if he woke him up. Maybe he preferred to start with the operation "Ignore Potter" the following day. Perhaps he wanted a last chance to vent and fight with him, to feel the heat of the discussions and to look into his angry green eyes one last time.
"But Professor-"
Right, because the wet dream was about Draco. Which was
linger in that smile.
"No," said Draco, surrendering. "I kissed him. He was asking questions he did not have to ask, so I had to distract him."
"Will you shut up, Harry?" said Hermione, who had been processing the whole confirmation. "It's embarrassing that you think you can fool us."
Malfoy was falling apart. The bags of his eyes so deep they absorbed all the light in the room. Nothing in his completely defeated body, not his horrified grimace, not his shaken limbs, eased Harry's dark thoughts. Malfoy's state confirmed that it had been
It was a terrible stare. All the way across the Great Hall, where the Slytherin and the Gryffindor table stood separated by the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff ones. It was the type of stare that burnt, that stung and pierced the soul, the kind that delved into the body and spread like a cancer. Harry had to collect all his strength not to turn and look back. He was not going to fall in his game so easily. The challenge of last night seemed quite stupid with the light of the day, but Harry knew Malfoy would never back down, so he was not backing down either. But it of course had to remain top secret. No one could ever find out about it, not even his two best friends.
"Makes sense. I'm also going to bed."
"Sure, mate," he nodded, patting his back reassuringly. "Doesn't matter. Forget it. But just. Just talk to us, okay? Whatever it is that is going on. We are here for you."
He had decided that he was going to stick to the
, the last ounce of reason he had left was screaming him to
"What are you doing? What's the need of touching me like that?" Harry hissed nervously. Malfoy didn't answer. He was firmly holding his shoulders, in what wanted to be an aggressive grasp, but that was too
"Hey, hey. Come on, 'Mione, you are spiralling. It is a lot of information, I know, but it is all speculation for now. Maybe you are right and I saw something that was not there and they were slapping the hell out of each other until their faces were red."
"A nightmare?"
"Oh, come on, beautiful. This can't work if we don't collaborate."
"So?"
"It's not like that!" Draco's eyes were wide open in terror. "I hate Potter! I fucking hate him. It's not attraction, it is nothing like what you are saying. He is more like an illness."
"What was that about?" asked Hermione disapprovingly during lunch.
"Okay, okay, sorry," muttered Potter, the arsehole. "I just want to sleep, alright?"
Third, his parents, with the purest of bloods, were not better than anyone. His father was rather stupid, having gotten locked up in Azkaban and lost the favour of the Dark Lord. And his mother was a coward, always doing what Aunt Bella wanted, sending Severus to control everything he did and jeopardizing his mission. And this last point was the most shocking, as it went against everything that Draco had ever believed. His respect for the adults he had once idolized was quickly fading.
Malfoy.
"Harry!" muttered Hermione, angrily.
"And what am I doing then?"
Potter didn't listen anyway. Then, the chivalrous bastard removed his cloak and passed it over his shoulders. Draco wanted to complain, but the weight of the thick wool felt good.
And the idiotic twat blamed himself.
"No, but I guess I can hide it," replied Draco. "What about you, though? Can you stop provoking?"
"Your glass is full of water."
"Sorry. I thought you were sleeping already. Almost done."
Everyone thought they were back to normal. Malfoy and Potter. And they had perfected their act of pretending that everything was indeed back to normal. But Harry knew that it was all as fake as Malfoy's mask. He knew that the shouts in public were a poor attempt to relief the tension. He felt in his flesh that they both kept acting out in front of unknowing spectators because they feared what could happen if they exploded in private. They feared what neither of them was willing to accept.
to talk about that kind of stuff.
The weird unspoken truce they had arrived to by living together had been noticed outside their shared room. Hogwarts had become more silent since they had been grounded, but no one likes it when storms get quiet, because it is the kind of silence that chaos leaves behind. Everywhere they went, there were rumours in every corner. Potter was used to it, but it throughly annoyed Draco. However, he hoped that the silence was enough to convince their teacher's to end the whole idiocy they had come up with.
"Draco-" warned Snape, but it was too late.
When Harry entered their room, he saw Malfoy against the window. A rush of anger spread through his body. But then Malfoy turned to look at him and something else stirred in his stomach. His nose looked funny. Snape had fixed it immediately, but there was a small curve that had not been there before. It also was redder than normally. Maybe two broken noses in less than a month were too much, even in a world of Wizards.
"Professors Snape and McGonagall want you to solve your differences, Harry. That is the point of this seemingly unorthodox detention, to fix the problem, rather than ignore it."
"Who said anything about using it as an insult? I'm just stating facts. I can change it, though, if you prefer. What would suit
"What are you doing here?" asked Harry. "It's kind of late for visits, no?"
Malfoy. Under him. Pale like a ghost. So thin and fragile and broken and-
"I'll walk with you," said Ron. Without voicing it, he convinced Hermione to let them go. He would tell her everything later. Well, not everything. Ron had not told Hermione his theories about what was going on with Harry. He really wanted to, because she would know what to do. She always knew. But Malfoy had always been particularly awful to Hermione, and Ron didn't want to be there the day Harry told her he
"I don't know what you are talking about," said Harry, and for one second, Ron believed him. But then he saw Harry's forced smile, and he remembered how red he had been that one time. When Malfoy had tripped on his salad.
"Hermione, are you listening to yourself?" yelled Ron, to stop her before their best friend collapsed.
"You weren't completely useless." Truth is he had been awesome and Draco would replay the night in his head until the day he died.
"But I would like to!" he shouted, out of control. "I would like to help fucking Malfoy even though I know he would spit in my face if I offered!"
"Oh, come on, Harry. At least try to find a decent excuse," interrupted Ron, not exactly mad, but glaring a bit. "Really, what's going on? Is it really working? The detention, I mean. Are you starting to get along with him or something?"
"I most definitely am not," he replied instead.
pose," said Draco, arching an eyebrow. In no world was he going to back away,  "You are shaking, Potter."
"The only time I took my shirt off, neither of us realised-"
"You are super late again."
"You are not that important, Malfoy," he murmured, intimidated, somewhat embarrassed. Draco smiled with superiority, tasting the moment.
"Yes. And it will be even easier if we stop sharing a room," answered Draco this time.
"No, I don't. I'm here because of a dare, not because I want to."
He got dressed quickly, and run to breakfast. Ashamed and fluttered as he was, he did not notice that the tie he put on was green.
"Oh, can you?" and Draco kissed him again. Potter seemed to be fighting something in his head, but he did not push him away. Instead, he opened his mouth right when Draco stopped the kiss. "Real control of the situation you've got there, Potter. I admire it."
"Oh, wonderful then!" McGonagall exclaimed innocently. "What about extending the experience one more week? Just to fully absorb what you have learnt from each other."
"Oh, no, no, Potter," said Hermione, stopping him before he could slip away. "We need to talk."
in his head.
"Oh, okay." Harry adopted a defensive position.
He could do it. He could let the room help him. He could take what the room had to offer.
"Don't stress, Malfoy," he sneered. "I'm sure you'll manage. It's just cleaning a bathroom. You must do it for Voldemort all the time, a loyal Death Eater like yourself."
, of course. Not that Harry had ever read it, but he knew enough about it to know that it was a cliche that Malfoy was reading it.
He was physically unable to move his legs and back the hell away.
Draco didn't know what to say, so he didn't say anything. He was supposed to ignore Potter, so not talking to him was an adequate first step. And that way he would not reinforce Potter's madness.
tw: selfharm in the end, homophobic slur, not actual description of sex but it's discussed
it. So instead of rehabilitating, Draco kept obsessing over how much he should be ignoring it and going completely crazy with abstinence. And maybe the metaphor was not too far fetched, because Draco was convinced that there was something toxic in Potter's saliva, an actual disease contaminating his bloodstream with Gryffindor grandeur and idiocy.
Right, and Malfoy only ever consumed things that were the best available.
Harry didn't know what to say. But Malfoy had ruined it. Now the silence was unbearable, and the bigger it grew, the more Harry wanted to tear his skin off.
"Okay, enough. I. have. had. enough," sentenced Draco, ready to leave. He could bear to lose Slytherin some points or to get grounded some more. He could not care less. He had better things to do than standing Harry Potter.
That was when Snape and the rest of the class noticed that they were not practising at all.
Whatever. Harry didn't know anything about "just sex", but he was sure that "just sex" did not include obsessive staring during breakfast.
"Impressive," Draco replied casually as if he was not being threatened or his personal space was not being invaded by Harry Potter. "Very noble of you to warn me. Thank you, oh Chosen One.'
"Listen, Potter, you should keep your big mouth shut. You are so full of yourself that you don't even see the privileges that surround you, and your dead parents give you no excuse..."
Maybe it was worth it to confront the scar-face just to be able to taste those apples.
listened to him, but of course, he had to not only listened but
No, Harry could not allow himself to be fooled by Malfoy's pretty face, and yet he hated how much effort it required for him to look past the pretty face and remember why he was supposed to not like Malfoy.
To be perfectly honest, and as long as he didn't remember that they were talking about Mafoy, Ron was having fun. Hermione was worried and a bit on edge, but Ron felt like laughing it off. Harry was a hilariously bad liar, and yet he kept trying, all blushed and sweaty. It was really funny if they allowed themselves to enjoy it, so he said, as mocking and condescending as he could:
"Your turn, Potter," said Snape.
So what was he supposed to do
And Draco heard clearly what Potter meant but hadn't said.
"Well, Professor, I wouldn't know," replied Harry getting annoyed. "It's not as if we have been having tea in the afternoons and discussing our childhoods. We have not fought in weeks, that should be enough. We learnt the lesson."
"I will if you do. For the sake of getting rid of this bloody room."
Hermione laughed, agreeing. And then her face became dead serious in a second.
"Thank you, Herms," said Harry after finally swallowing the potatoes. "And don't worry, I know. This is Malfoy we are talking about. He will always be Malfoy. It doesn't affect me." The tone too squeaky to sound believable.
"What? Why?" said Draco indignantly.
"I'm sure," he said instead, listening to the predominantly coherent parts of his rationality, which made Potter drop the hand with which he was reaching for his forehead.
Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy's seconds to get ready were always long. In the meantime, he tidied the room before Malfoy got another chance to yell at him about it. He was sure that the room had not been such a mess when he had gone to bed, though.
Ignore Potter.
"But why- What the fuck wrong with you?"
"I was not staring!" he shouted, ignoring how his pale cheeks gained colour.
, Potter."
"Who do you think decided on the mixed Slytherin-Gryffindor decoration? Snape?" Potter snorted, amused by his own joke.
"Such a gentleman, Potter. Had anyone ever told you?" Malfoy commented as Harry changed his glass of water.
"Potter-" said McGonagall.
"But I also don't understand, Ron! I cannot get my mind around this whole mess! I don't understand why on Earth did I ever kiss that bastard! Or why do I want to do it again-"
"So, how are you? How was your day?"
Malfoy had missed Hogsmeade. And now he was missing in general. Had not been in the Great Hall, was not now in their bedroom.
. Even if he was completely
And within seconds, Malfoy was against the wall and Harry was pointing at him with his wand.
"You didn't see it, 'Mione. They were standing super close. And Malfoy run to the bathroom! He went to hide!"
is happening between the two."
"I'm telling you it didn't happen! There is no way Malfoy and I would-"
"How is it going?" had asked Pansy at lunch. Or maybe it had been after Potions.
"Come on, Hermione, you really think that Malfoy is able to seriously damage Harry? He is a dick, but he is also a spoiled brat that won't want to dirty his hands."
"How come you were still sleeping when I got to your room?" asked Hermione.
"You really cannot go through life without messing with other people's, can you?"
the fuck did Malfoy come from?
Potter was awake. Of course he was. Eating in the floor. Like a filthy animal.
"Gee. Relax, princess," Harry answered, not really understanding why he was enjoying it all so much. However, finally showing some mercy, he put on a muggle T-shirt.
"Are you going to Hogsmeade?" Malfoy asked then, with a somewhat strange voice. He took some fruit and started eating as well. He looked somewhat nervous. Harry could not bear it.
What a fool.
"True."
Harry glared at him suspiciously, but he nodded, and off they went. Towards the green and red bedroom. They didn't talk much. Ron did not dare to confront him. The moment he did, there would be no going back. They eventually arrived to the door of the dormitory, and Harry discovered that Ron's face was conflicted, contorted in doubt and disgust.
wanted to confess. Because he felt like he was burning. All his body was on fucking fire. He had kissed Malfoy, and it was consuming him. His head could not move on. He had a headache due to how his brain kept replaying the scene. Over and over again. Without mercy. And it always ended with Malfoy's lips on his own. And Harry's heart skipped a beat every single time. And he
"Leave me alone, Potter. It's not as if I am wrong. Now, remove your greasy paws from my pyjamas."
And as sudden as it had started, that was the end of the laughter.
"You were having a nightmare, I came here to wake you up." Draco loved it when he was able to keep his voice completely cool and breezy even if his insides were an utter mess. He thanked the darkness for hiding all the things that not even his sixteen years of practice in pretending would be able to hide.
"It takes a lot of entitlement to judge people like that. Are you even listening? Do you want me to spell it for you how ridiculously clueless you are?"
Potter opened his mouth to answer back. Then he closed it. He looked as if he was going crazy. He pulled his hair, completely enraged.
"It won't work, Granger. In what universe do you think that Draco Malfoy is going to accept your Gryffindor help?"
"That was Ron, he wanted to have a bath and I offered."
"Right, okay. I'll be back soon."
Draco went in the bathroom without a word of thank you. If he tried to say something, all that would come out would be the inappropriate amount of sugary feelings he was having for Potter at the moment. And he still had a pinch of self-control left.
And now he was looking at him. Draco knew he looked like shit, but he did not need Potter staring. Hadn't he said that he didn't care? What was he looking at then? Stupid Potter with his stupid hair all over the place. It was a horrifying view, really, all that black, tangled mess on top of his ridiculous face. Why was he having breakfast at such unearthly times anyways? Draco kind of expected him to say something, but the green eyes eventually turned back to his food. Stupid green eyes.
Hermione and Ron exchanged quick glances. Harry didn't love it when they communicated with their not-at-all-subtle looks, specially when he was the subject in matter.
us to beat Slytherin in two minutes," nodded Ron thoughtfully.
Oh, that was it.
"Did you do it?"
"What?!!!"
Harry entered the shower and purposefully turned the cold water on. This was operation quick shower, operation think of disgusting things like Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon doing it. Come on, Harry, you can do it
working out for you?
Malfoy didn't answer. Harry hated it when he did that. He'd rather be insulted than ignored.
It kind of worked. It also had been just two days since what Harry liked to call the salad incident.
The rest of the school wasn't.
When the day came to an end, Hermione was buzzing with all the questions she had, but Harry ran away back to his red and green bedroom before she or Ron could stop him. The only thing she could do before Harry disappeared, and she was not completely sure as to why she did it, was removing the spell and giving back its original colours to the tie Harry was wearing. Hermione had wanted to run after him, but Ron had grabbed her by the arm to stop her.
Silence.
His life was a big fat joke. And he could not even sleep through it.
"But what if, Ron? What if Harry is in danger? What if Malfoy is using him somehow? Or what if it's all Voldemort's plan and he is using Malfoy? Goodness, maybe the fact that they are sharing a room is all part of the plan!"
He really did not want to face him right now, so he barely opened his eyes to answer: "Obviously". Through his squinted eyelids, he saw Potter doubting for a second.
It was a simple plan, yes. But it depended on a lot of stuff he could not control, which he hated. He had nothing better, though.
"Doesn't matter, I cannot. I cannot just-" Malfoy closed his eyes. Shaking violently.
Harry was surprised. Where did that come from?
"I- I don't know, Herms. I really don't know what's happening to me..."
It was not a question, so Draco did not answer. He was sitting in his small desk by the window, and he just calculatedly squinted at him as if had no clue of what he was talking about. Potter did not deserve any kind of explanation, specially not after the scene he'd pulled at the Great Hall. He was just a prick with outrageously gorgeous green eyes that made the room temperature rise wildly, which only made him more of a big-headed, childish, hateful, and stupid twat that he would never be able to talk with.
"You are a coward!"
Draco had not intended to sound
Immediately after, he heard Malfoy going out of the bathroom and throwing some spells here and there to clean the room. He turned the lights off and closed his curtains shut too.
They went silent again.
Potter was not waiting for him with cold dinner.
He still didn't understand why he had suddenly felt so ill, but he guessed the stressful life that he was heading had decided to knock him off for a night. He vaguely remembered Potter hovering all over him all night before he managed to fall asleep, but he was determined not to let that get in the way of his decision to ignore him. Besides, he did remember that McGonagall had said that she would end the detention if they lasted one more week, and he felt the strength to do that now, after a wonderful night of deep sleep.
. That's who. Sheer geniuses. Freaking master minds. What Draco was looking at was literally art.
"Are you deaf? Out!"
"Good morning," said Harry solemnly. Pretending to be unaffected. (He was not expecting Malfoy in a bathrobe, okay? Normally, he got dressed just after showering.)
?" Ron half laughed. (His other half was horrified.)
"So," Harry started hesitantly, "I kind of missed the explanation-"
"Sick bastard," muttered Harry, falling on his knees.
Draco was sure it was his imagination, but then he said it again.
, as if nothing was wrong. Facing the fucking
Draco had occasionally done
"So you let me win to protect my ego, is that right?" asked Potter mockingly, piercing him with those eyes that made Draco feel unprotected. "What's the dare then?"
Draco discovered two green jumpers delicately resting in the red chair. Which was weird. When had he. How had he not noticed. He frowned, but he did not say a word while he grabbed them and hanged them on his closet.
"It doesn't even depend on me anyways. He clearly said it tonight. No more sex."
"And why are you talking to me?"
"I think he is obsessing over that theory of his, and maybe he is trying to catch him," answered Hermione thoughtfully.
"It's not the same!"
"It's madness, I know..."
But then Potter woke up anyway without any sound and the curtains opened brusquely.
The door of the office opened, and Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall came in. The boys separated so fast that the Professors did not notice anything odd when they announced their punishment.
Silence.
"Go away."
. And if Potter wants to kiss my neck, I sure am going to grab his arse. And bless all the Greatest Wizards, what an arse.
Draco realised that he was still seated on his bed. He readily stood up. He may have blushed for some stupid hormonal unbalance, but the room was dark, Potter was blind, and he would have denied it.
Draco did not comment any further but breathed out slightly relieved. He grabbed some parchments and books and walked towards the door, leaving. It was a mystery that he had not thought of leaving earlier, but none of the boys noticed. He was almost out of there when Potter grabbed his arm. Again. As if it was normal, as if he had the right.
And everything hurt. He could not see. He could not sense anything but the pain. He loathed himself. He would rather die.
At first, Draco thought he was a hallucination. Potter couldn't possibly have caught him at the lowest point of his life. Draco was dirty and sweaty and everything hurt and all his muscles felt dumb. And now he was delusional. He couldn't deal with fake Potters now.
"And he will eventually kill you. Because you are a puny child next to Him. You can't seriously believe that you have any possibilities."
"Okay, so I guess you are good," Potter said. His voice sounded velvety, with a kindness that would be unbearable to ignore now that Draco knew it existed. "I will leave some food and water here for when you wake up, okay? Sleep well, Malfoy."
"That's not it, child. I talked to Professor McGonagall and the Headmaster. We agreed on the kind of detention you and Potter are getting."
"What do you suggest?" he replied with an unintirested tone.
Maybe Malfoy was dead.
"Hey, hey," said Ron, in an easygoing tone, choosing his words wisely, and moving in front of the door so that Harry could not escape. "We just want to
"It's not that I
Draco went pale. That is, paler than usual. Pansy squinted at him, trying to decipher if it was all a bad joke.
"You were spying on me, Potter?" he asked dangerously, voice calm and cold like ice.
"I'm not scared! And I'm not leaving you here all alone!"
"I actually did not see you," said Ron slowly, and he was not laughing anymore. He actually looked a bit green in the face.
Harry thought about it. They really weren't that different. "I don't know, Professor."
"No, but I made him swear that he had nothing to do with it."
"Of course not, Potter. I cannot be mad about something that is so not surprising. Believe me, your complete lack of manners was expected. It is hard for me to picture how can a small beast like you go around without any consideration for the rest of the world and..."
"Can you get out of your ass for one second?" shrieked Draco. He wanted to cry. "You've got to stop going around wanting to save everybody. I don't need your heroism. You cannot help me."
The thing that bothered Ron the most was that Harry would not tell them. Ron could see how he was suffering on his own. And Harry was not very good at swallowing his feelings. He clearly needed their help, but he would not say anything. Ron was able to understand that it was hard to openly speak about how hard he had it for his school rival. It was obviously a difficult thing to confess. But come on, they were all friends, right? They were
"Why did you kiss back?" replied Draco.
"So... you two? It's still not a thing?"
"You're worried about Malfoy?" Ron cringed a bit.
"It seems to me that you are not following the right strategy," pointed out Hermione. "Come on, Harry. What's with all the screaming these past days? It looked like you had gotten over that. Why again? Did something happen?"
by the blonde's little adventures. It was weird that Malfoy was able to get under Harry's skin like that. It was weird, but to be fair, it was not
Harry could not answer. But at least now he was able to look at them. Maybe it made no sense to keep denying it. After all, his friends were still there. True, Ron looked like he was going to faint any minute, and Hermione's face expression was not precisely peaceful or soothing, but they had not run away in complete horror. They had not abandoned him. They were there, swallowing whatever dislike or disapproval they felt about it, willing to listen and help out. Harry always underestimated them, and he was always too surprised when they were there for him until the very end.
It seemed as if he wanted to say something else. He opened his mouth a couple of times just to close it again, which made Draco even more rabid, because he wanted Potter to scream back, to yell at him, to punch him in the nose, to kiss him, to insult him. He needed Potter to fight back.
"Whatever you think is best, Professor," said Malfoy neutrally, although a bit too quickly.
Harry could not stand it.
"Maybe we should go visit tomorrow, distract him or something. Give him something else to think about."
"I don't want to hear it, Potter. I don't need you to convince me of anything. You have no clue what it is like. I don't want your heroic crap. I have no options!"
He needed to look at Malfoy in the eye. He needed him to tell him how stupid and awful Harry was to think what he was thinking.
And Potter opened his eyes as if he was waking up from a dream and looked at him with panic, and Draco knew that was the moment when he would wake up from his fantasy, and leave him alone. Draco shuddered at the thought.
"You don't look all that bothered."
Draco turned to go back to bed, and because he needed to get far from Potter as soon as possible.
"It is the first time that you mention these dreams, Draco," said Snape.
"I just don't buy it, you know? I can't believe that he doesn't care. He is constantly on edge. His- His masks, they don't work anymore. He used to be so good at pretending he was above everybody else- And now he cannot. It's like the masks break before he can use them. As if he didn't have the energy to put them on anymore."
His brain screeched. All his senses were overloaded.
"So you don't think I can distract you?" she suggested delicately.
"Okay, Potter, whatever. I'll be ready in a second."
It was only the two of them in the Slytherin Common Room, and it was late. Draco was not really eager to go back to the room he shared with Potter. Not after what had happened last time. Also not after being closer than ever to bring actual grown-up Death Eaters to Hogwarts. Besides, he was convinced that the moment he looked at Potter's ugly face, the Dark Mark would start hurting again.
when i don't post is bc i have small breakdowns with how terrible my english is, but please bear with me
smile.
him. That and the fact that a part of Ron didn't want to believe it yet.
"Thanks for cleaning," he said bluntly.
"Be quiet, Mr Potter. And sit down. One more word and it will be a hundred points less from Gryffindor. You too, Mr Malfoy. Grab a chair and sit down."
"So how was it the first time?" asked Hermione.
"It's not so bad."
Harry felt weak. He didn't understand why Malfoy was so fucking close. He could not comprehend what was going on. He had absolutely
him, and he was right there, staring at him, wanting to get closer. And Draco could use that against him. He could use that to keep Potter distracted from his underground activities. Maybe he would get so infected with Potter's diseases that he would die before the Dark Lord could kill him. Hell. It sounded good. He could definitely do that.
Draco sneered, even if Potter could not see him. It was less awkward because they couldn't see each other. The fact that Potter had just
Merlin help him, Harry wanted to punch himself. He was weak, a sick embarrassing hormonal teenager that did not deserve to have a hand.
"Yes?" he replied rapidly. His voice was kind of hoarse, as if he was getting sick from staying outside without a jacket on mid-November.
he now was cheap imitating him, not letting go of his arm, "
"How can I know? Well, I just do, Hermione. We share a room, and one doesn't need to be a hawk to notice that he eats and sleeps badly. Not just that, he is a mess. He used to be the most calculated and flawless person in the school. Now, he explodes at the slightest encouragement, and he looks like shit when he wakes up and when he goes back to sleep. And I'm sure that he is hurting. I don't fucking know how I know, but he is losing himself. And because he is a stubborn arsehole, he won't accept any help."
Draco contained the urge to bark a laugh. Potter thought he was so funny. "Precisely, until you interrupted me with your extremely irrelevant questions."
"I'm just bored, Malfoy."
"Are you sure? Yesterday was pretty bad, are you sure you are feeling better?"
There, he said it.
Potter barked a laugh. "What am I going to do without your glamorous shouting in the morning, Malfoy?"
"No, but-"
"So?" asked an outraged Harry.
"Yes?"
"He is mean, Professor! You can't truly expect me to get along with someone that has been calling my best friend racist names since the Second Year. He is cruel, and lousy."
"Your mother would spit on your face if she could see you right now!" Draco managed to bark. Potter was holding him by the shoulders now, close to the neck, and his grasp grew stronger and more painful as Draco spoke. "You think you are brave banging me against the wall in front of your little friends? Want to show how big of a man you are, do you? Some reason in particular?"
Soon, they changed topics. Ron was used to Hermione's madness, so he kept eating as if his stomach had no end. Hermione was used to Ron's mockery, so she continued ranting about all kinds of topics. Harry never arrived for dinner that night.
Harry took a huge mouthful of mashed potatoes, while Ron glanced at him suspiciously.
Katie Bell was in the Hospital Wing.
"He does, doesn't he?"
"I thought you were bluffing."
with her. She was intelligent, very pretty and she kissed irreproachably, so he had always considered her as perfectly decent company. They also knew each other since forever and they had something similar to trust going on between them. She was comfortable, that's the word. It was comfortable to be around her. And Draco knew it was reciprocated. It was a perfectly balanced relationship in which they both got some benefit out of it, and not one bit of harm.
Potter, with his inability to keep quiet for more than three seconds, started to tap on the table with his fingers. Draco, who was already pretty irritated by the fact that he had to wait, tensed up. When Potter was unnecessarily loud, he was also especially disturbing. Draco already had trouble ignoring Potter's obnoxiousness, but when he was also noisy, it was impossible. And they needed to avoid the fight, just a bit longer. Thankfully, just when Potter's restlessness moved to his leg, McGonagall appeared.
He spotted Snape in the ground, looking at him. The professor made a small gesture with his arm, calling him. Draco kept flying for two more laps around the Quidditch field, and eventually landed near his teacher.
Pansy gave her a calculating look, but her gut told her this was the right thing to do.
, Harry was not able to look away from his lips. Maybe it was some kind of curse, but it felt like it also affected Malfoy, because when he walked one step towards him, the Slytherin looked at his lips hungrily too.
Hermione laughed, and pressed her head over his chest.
Bloody Potter. What an arse. Now Draco was awake because of him. And he had to stop thinking about him. But Potter would not stop screaming. Annoying. Even asleep, he just
He still was unable to move. And Potter kept breathing hard, and now Draco was hard, but there was no way he was going to even acknowledge that fact.
And Malfoy grabbed Harry's face like he owned it, and joined their mouths aggressively. Harry kissed back for two glorious seconds before he pushed him away.
"What do you mean important?"
Especially because, on top of everything, the great and marvelous Harry Potter was sleeping barely five meters away from him at that very moment.
"Because he pushes people away, that's what he does best."
Draco thought he had fucked up. Potter remembered. He was making fun of him. So he turned back to look at him again, but Potter seemed sincere, wide-open green gaze shining in the dark.
Potter grabbed his waist like he had been grabbing his arms all past days, almost eagerly, without thinking, like he did everything in his life. As if he had the right. Draco didn't feel powerful anymore. His legs were shaking. Potter was looking at his mouth. Potter was holding him. He was so close. Too close.
? And what is that shampoo smell? It's
Ron was blocking her mouth again, and he did not even realise how close he was standing against her. But Hermione did, and she felt her knees weak. She nodded, not because she was impressed by Ron's threat, but because she needed him to back off if she wanted to be able to ever think rationally again.
"I'm going to prepare a hot bath for you. Wait here."
"Yes, Professor," he nodded, although he definitely didn't understand it all.

Potter went even more ballistic and squeezed tighter. Everyone in the Great Hall was silent, so the suffocated sound that left Draco's throat was perfectly audible.
"Okay, bye, Parkinson," said Hermione firmly, standing up and walking away.
. Do you want to give me a sore throat on top of everything else?"
me, Malfoy. And it was low even for you" Potter waited for Draco to say something, but he didn't. "So why would you do that? The obvious explanation is that you are a complete lunatic and you have uncontrollable episodes of craziness. Of course, another explanation is that I am irresistible and you cannot help but
, look at the floor, how is it
And then Potter shouted a short final "fuck", and everything went silent.
"Potter!" Snape called him before he could cross the door. "One more broken nose and you will be out of Hogwarts before you know it."
"Because I don't need to! You don't have a single thread of proof against me, so you don't get to accuse me! You don't get to mess with my life just because!"
"Drop that shit! Stop acting as if you didn't care! You are not like this!"
The day that followed after Potter left was pretty miserable.
Cool.
"And tell me, how has a simple distraction turned into wanking together?"
"Sorry, sorry. I thought you were not here and-"
Hermione had been researching on Katie Bell's incident. She knew it had affected Harry more than he was willing to admit, so she had tried to investigate what had happened. And she had failed. Nobody had answers for her. Nothing in the library, nothing from Madame Pomfrey, nothing from McGonagall. She still had no clue of how Katie had been poisoned, and less alone who had poisoned her. However, everyone in Hogwarts seemed to be closing all the possible student investigations before they even started.
do you care about Snape's homework, Malfoy?!' he spat his name like an insult. "Merlin, it was the first Slytherin-Gryffindor match of the year! And you missed it! You missed Quidditch!!"
"Well, the world doesn't revolve around you, princess," replied Harry sarcastically, "and sometimes one has to bear with things that are annoying."
"I don't know. But, to be honest, I couldn't care less. If he is daft enough to be, I don't want to know. I just want to get rid of this stupid detention."
"Granger? Are you in here?" asked Pansy, entering the room.
He pushed him away.
"Ronald, I'm talking to you," complained Hermione when she noticed Ron wasn't listening.
"You walked all the way here to tell me that?"
Harry chewed slowly. He was looking at his plate. Ron did not move his eyes from him.
"Okay, I get it, I'll shut up. But I'm taking you to bed, okay? Just give me one second."
"Short," he answered without thinking, and then he blushed furiously. If Ron had not been concentrated in not puking, it would have been cute. "I mean, he kissed me, and told me to interpret it as I willed."
"Malfoy!" he shouted, and he was soon next to him, watching him as he poured all the contents of his stomach in the toilet. Great. But Draco was too weak to yell at him. "What's going on? What's wrong?"
"What are you saying? That there is something between that snake and Harry? Please!"
There was a silence.
And Harry breathed. Because he could not tell him or Hermione. But maybe Ron suspected something and yet, there he was, trying to be there for him like he always was. Harry felt a wave of gratitude and love spreading throughout his body. And he smiled, more honestly this time.
Harry laughed. "Yes, don't worry. Maybe I just have to talk to him. Agree on something that allows us to go back to our rooms."
"You Gryffindor stupid shits! You cannot just force yourself into other people's lives without knowing the consequences of your actions! It is not a solution to barge into action just based on a hunch! You know why? Because most times it doesn't work!"
And Circe and all her descendants help him, Potter was still without a shirt. A stupid smirk on his poor excuse of a face. Leaning casually against one of the posts of his bed. And an
"But I didn't! It was an accident!"
"That's not true!"
Sometimes they would play like that. They had known since they were little that they were destined to get married. Their families were going to arrange it the moment they turned twenty according to the pure blood families tradition, so they'd decided to arrange their own rules for it. If the marriage had to be arranged, they'd thought they might as well arrange it themselves.They had come up with the whole system playing. In the games, they were always married in paper, but they had the common agreement that they could still live their own lives. And games had turned into reality, because that's how their relationship worked now. Although they did not share much of their private lives, they arranged everything that concerned the two of them together. They'd arranged their first kiss like that, in order to be ready when the real time came.
Pure goodness and bravery. He had repeatedly imagined how they would go to Hogwarts together, and how they would become the best of friends. He had thought that if someone was on the level of being friends with Harry Potter, it had to be him, with his wonderful mansion, and his powerful family, and his good looks.
The following day, they had a meeting with Snape and McGonagall, a meeting where they would hopefully set an ending date for the absurd detention they were enduring.
And that was the sign that finally made Harry break apart as if Malfoy was poisonous, the voice that made him notice all the people around, Ron's hand pulling his arm and Hermione's angry whispers.
"You know where he is?"
As he spoke, Ron slowly walked away from her, terrified as to how she was going to react. However, Hermione only stood there, shooting daggers with her eyes, leaning against the door with her arms crossed.
"Don't mention it. I'm going to the kitchens now, I'm hungry. Do you want me to send something?"
Malfoy opened his mouth, probably to complain about the mess, but then he looked at Harry in the eyes and
"You should start taking baths. Showers are not nearly as relaxing," he replied as if
"Come, come, I was just joking. It's just that when you get mad, you talk a lot, and you go all straight with that face.
Harry could not hold it back, and broke in laughter again, interrupting the little speech of his new roommate.
McGonagall smiled.
"You are awake!" greeted Potter, entering the room, his arms full with new provisions. "I got you some orange juice."
As a kid, Draco had also read about Harry Potter, this kid his age that had beaten the Darkest Wizard of all times. He had investigated all about this kid. He knew about his scar, and his dead parents, and his black hair. And he had loved him. He had loved the kid he had read about in the History books. He had loved what Harry Potter represented: a
Malfoy was sick. Not in the usual disturbed arsehole kind of way, but in the actually physically ill one, with all the vomits, and the temperature, and the demands. Because, of course, Malfoy hated being sick, but he most definitely rejoiced in making sure that everyone around understood how much he was suffering. And, unfortunately, Harry was the person that was around in the middle of the night.
," said Potter, thoughtlessly glancing at some parchment he had next to his breakfast.
Draco burst out in a loud laugh, and he impulsively hugged her. Pansy doubted for a second, but she slowly hugged him back after a few seconds. And they stayed like that for a bit.
"He is right. It is barely an explanation," added Hermione.
him to act as he required.
And he was going to try the Hogsmeade plan out. He had nothing to lose.
Too bad. He was not going to sleep until they talked, until the knot in his chest loosened. He hated it, though. He hated how he was waiting to talk to someone that embodied the definition of the word 'jerk'.
"Yes, but-," Potter attempted to answer.
"He won't accept any help, Hermione," insisted Harry. "Not from us."
"There you go! Ladies and gentlemen, the prince has gotten his voice back!"
"Yeah, thanks, Ron."
Draco, however, was not going to play. He had already given up his position in the Slytherin team. He had to keep his mind focused, and he had to profit from the break of having Potter out of the room. He could not get anything done when he felt him lurking around. Potter did not bring himself to ask him about his late arrivals and his early wake-ups, but he totally judged him. At times, Draco could practically see his two brain cells trying to figure out what he was up to every time they encountered.
Harry felt like his head was going to explode. Okay, so now his friends knew. But what now? It's not as if Harry knew what to do with the information. Now the three would not know what to do together. They would go crazy together. Fucking great.
