“You’re right, Ron,” Harry said. Because he was. “I’m sorry. I should have told you. I just didn’t know how to bring it up. I mean, it wasn’t even a week ago when we all still hated each other.”
He dreams of driving through country lanes in the Bentley. Driving, and driving, and never getting to where he needs to be, even though he knows he needed to be there ten minutes ago. It’s a nightmare he’s had many times before — so many times that it almost feels lazy. And at least it’s not one of the bad ones. At least it’s not one of the dreams that sends him rocketing awake, heart pounding and covered in sweat. Or one of the ones that his mother tells him he screams through. He hopes those ones stay away. He’s not sure he could live down Potter hearing him screaming in his sleep.
But then how had he been supposed to know it was stolen? Or that it would disappear like that? He still has no idea how it got to him. Or, well, he knows the how, but he is still clueless about the why. And what was that that Pansy had said about Oliver being Potter’s partner? Did that mean that Oliver had been dating Potter or that he had been an Unspeakable as well? He is not sure which of those would be worse.
“Shouldn’t it have gone by now?” Harry asked after they had stared at the Cup for a minute. Draco pulled out his pocket watch and looked at it.
He turns and complies with the command. He raises his hands in the air, his wand still in one of his pockets, and out of the corner of his eye, he sees Harry do the same. The lumos on Harry’s wand projects strange shadows on the wall. The light, however, falls just short of the contingency of wizards that stands in the doorway, all of whom are pointing their own wands at Harry and Draco.
“Wait,” Draco cried again. He ran to catch up with Harry, reaching out a hand to grab his arm. Harry spun around to face him.
car. It’s a beautiful, sleek Bentley sports car with a cream colored leather interior, replete with stained walnut trim, and Draco adores it. His mother calls it impractical, but she would rather Floo everywhere anyway. She doesn’t understand the calm that Draco finds in speeding down empty country roads, hugging the curves in the road and watching the fields flash past his window.
He stays under the shower stream, but he lets the washcloth drop and fact that he is excited to see Malfoy becomes abundantly clear. The corner of Malfoy’s mouth quirks up into a smirk. He stands, just staring at Harry, for a long moment, before he steps even closer. He is within arm’s reach now, but Harry is going to stand his ground and make the blond come to him. Malfoy, perhaps sensing this, finally closes the distance between them, reaching out and pulling Harry against himself.
“His cover is that he’s dating me, Parkinson,” Harry says. “Not that we’re a threesome.” Pansy shoots him a withering glare but joins them at the table. They sit and Harry taps his wand on a small box in the middle of the table. The box glows and then projects an image onto the blank wall in front of them. It is of an office. After a moment, Granger comes into view as she kneels down next to what is presumably the fireplace.
“Whisky,” Draco says and then adds “please,” when he remembers his manners. Potter squats down next to the bar and opens another part of the contraption in order to pull out two glasses. He pours significantly more than a finger into each of them and then hands one of the glasses to Draco.
As they walked, Harry looked around. The house was larger than he had anticipated it being, though from the way that Draco had thrown his father’s name about all through the first five years of their education, he probably should have expected it.
“I was never dark and brooding,” Potter says, shaking his head. “I think you had the monopoly on that.” Potter takes a sip of his coffee. He closes his eyes as he does and smiles contentedly.
With the weekend coming up, he was not sure when he would see Draco next. Of course he would see him on Monday morning in Double Potions, but he didn’t want to wait that long. Nor did he want to roam the corridors hoping to randomly bump into the blond. And he didn’t have Seamus’s confidence so he didn’t think he could just waltz into the Slytherin Common room. Draco’s friends didn’t even know they were dating. For all the Slytherins knew, Harry and Draco were barely friends.
“Oh, stop flirting,” Neville said and Harry realized with a start he had been facing Neville the whole time, just looking over his shoulder.
“It’s gyfu,” he said slowly. “So it is at least an easier shape.” She nodded. “I say we just go for it.”
“This is legitimately very cool,” Blaise whispered as they shuffled through the cellar of Honeydukes. “Do you ever take advantage of the fact that you can just enter their storeroom like this?” Harry frowned at him.
“He can’t work at Flourish and Blotts,” Pansy says quickly. She has enough to put up with in the form of Luca and Joe as is. She refuses to have to deal with McLaggen and his damnable swagger and irritatingly good looks as well. “It would look too suspicious if there were two of us there.”
“Why would we?” Draco’s eyebrows shot up his forehead. “What? You just explained it.” He turned back to his notes. Draco breathed out angrily through his nose. Harry was not sure what Draco was so annoyed about.
He closes his eyes, but sleep will not come. His mind is full of the man asleep beside him. He’d seen the flash of pain in Draco’s eyes when he thought Harry would rather be on a date with someone else and all Harry wants to do is soothe that pain away. He had tried all night to make him feel better, not least of all with their activities in the bathroom stall, but he still isn’t sure if he has done enough.
In his mind's eye he could see her dark eyes flashing as she’d caught his eye across the Great Hall at dinner. Her costume had been perfect - her long, dark hair tied up in a ponytail and her dress that hugged all of her lovely curves. Oh, that dress. With its long slit up the side and its floaty, diaphanous material. It had fit her like a glove and yet had flowed in a way that Ron had found incredibly appealing.
“D’you want to get out of here?” Harry asks once Draco pulls away and Draco’s grin is answer enough.
“Circe, Cormac. Do you want my help or not? May I remind you, I just brought you onto the most high profile task force in the DMLEHS.”
“Hermione must hate that,” Ron says. There’s a pause and then his face crumples again. Harry sits down on the bed again.
“Are you asking me if I want to do all the things we do in public in private as well? Only now they mean something?”
“I mean it’s after midnight,” Cormac amends. He lifts up the glass in front of him. “Happy Christmas everyone. I’m so pleased to be ringing in the holiday with you.”
“I mean, there are now six of us who want to learn Occlumency,” Harry said. “We feel it’s going to be important for our plans.”
,” Draco says. “Imbibe. You said the “D” word.” Ginny laughs into her cup. Seamus points at Harry and nudges Dean. Draco sighs and points at Seamus using his elbow. “You too, Finnegan,” he says. “Pointing.” Seamus scrunches up his face in irritation as everyone laughs. Draco turns over the next card in the pile and the whole thing explodes.
“She’s fine. She wants to see you.” Harry realizes that he is still holding Ron’s hand and drops it. Ron continues to walk beside him. After a moment he asks,
“Really, Harry?” Draco asked. He was still cradled in Harry’s arms, but shifted so that he could look his boyfriend in the face. Or, rather, the cheek.
“No,” Draco says a few minutes later, in the guest bedroom while he and Harry are changing into their costumes. “You’ve got to be fucking with me. There’s no way you went into an acromantula lair at the age of twelve and lived to tell the tale.”
“While I would like that, I’m worried about-” Harry gestured towards the window. Draco scowled at it. Then he looked around the rest of the seating area and pointed to a chair in the corner, next to the fireplace.
“He didn’t get any information, did he?” Blaise asked, voicing the blunt question. Draco shook his head.
“We came here because I couldn’t stop thinking about you,” Draco says. He takes a step towards Massi.
“So what should we do in the meantime?” Pansy asks. She wants something to do with all of her nervous energy.
“Hey, you’re already the Boy-Who-Lived. I have to bring you down to the same level as us plebs whenever I can.” Harry harrumphed for a moment before smiling at Ron.
“Gemino,” he said. A perfect copy of the Cup appeared next to it on the desk. Harry reached out and picked up the genuine Cup before they had a chance to confuse the two. It was cold to the touch, and felt the way the locket had - like there was something alive about it. Draco carried the copy back to the bookshelf and placed it on the shelf before closing the grille again.
“Yes, but—“ and then Pansy stops herself. Cormac is absolutely the wrong person with whom to talk about her relationship concerns.
And is he a tiny bit excited about it? Fuck yes he is. He has wanted to see Draco’s orgasm face again since that time in the shower. He wants to have that kind of power over the blond again. The power to make him gasp and moan and to make his knees go weak. To make him cry out Harry’s name as he comes. Oh Potter. Fuck, yes, Potter. He
“Ron,” Hermione said. “It’s Sunday. Of course we’re going to the library.” Ron slumped down onto Pansy’s shoulder but his girlfriend just rolled her eyes at him.
. He refuses to wear any of the rest of the red, though, and just undoes the top two buttons on his collared shirt before making his way down the stairs to join Potter in the kitchen.
But really, what is he going to wear? What does one wear on a date to watch a muggle film? He hasn’t the faintest idea. Muggle clothes, presumably. Nice ones.
“But that’s not to say that we follow all the rules. I mean, clearly we sneak out of school on non-Hogsmeade weekends.”
Draco looks Harry square in the face as he continues to move ever so slightly under him. After what feels like an age, Harry lowers himself back down to Draco’s level. He kisses him briefly before moving down his body again. This time, he catches the waistband of Draco’s trousers between his teeth and tugs. Nothing happens. Draco lifts his hips up and Harry tries again, before Draco bats him away and pulls down his trousers on his own, bringing his underwear with them.
“Hey Luna,” Harry said on Monday. He had run after her in the corridor and now she looked up at him in curiosity.
“Close your mouth, sweetie,” Draco said, glancing over at him. “You look like a trout.” Harry glared at him and pressed his lips together in a scowl. “Oh, don’t give me that look.”
“Lunch would be brilliant.” He started quickly towards the Great Hall as if worried the food would suddenly disappear. “I was prepared to be starving until dinner, but this is clearly much preferable.” Hermione laughed. They sat down at the end of the table and Blaise immediately began to pile food onto his plate in a way that reminded Hermione of Ron. She reflected, not for the first time, how different Blaise seemed to be when he was away from his peers. Gone was the aloof and pretentious Blaise that she had grown used to, and in his place was this interesting and thoughtful young man. She wondered how the Gryffindors must appear to other people.
“Very well,” Hermione says. She leaves the room briefly and comes back holding a glass of water. She hands the glass to Draco. “Drink this please.”
“Point taken,” Blaise said quickly, cutting her words off. Pansy smirked at him then glanced behind them at Ron and Hermione. Blaise caught her look and pressed his lips together. Pansy arched an eyebrow at him and he blinked blithely back at her.
“Whatever you say,” Harry says, throwing his hands up in defeat. But he doesn't think this conversation is over. Not really. Not yet.
“Oh shit,” he says. “I completely forgot.” He had been so tired from waking up to read the Reliquary’s updates that all he had done when he got down to the kitchen was sip coffee like a zombie. Now it is Pansy’s turn to glare at Draco. “I’ll do it in my first break.”
“Yes, well, we can’t all have your shiny reputation, Potter,” Draco says. Pansy, who is sitting on Draco’s other side, snickers.
But the package will be safe there until he or the right Unspeakables can collect it. He looks over at the door and sees that the edges are starting to splay. He runs to the side of the room, next to the door, and flattens himself against the wall. He brings his wand up and bends his knees, ready for the moment the door will break.
“Eh,” Pansy said. “To acquaintances that might become friends if you all don’t irritate me too much.”
As Hermione continues to talk, Draco’s mind wanders. He is beginning to think that perhaps this whole Reliquary accident could be his chance to atone for his actions during the war. If he can help the Ministry catch new dark wizards and foil other dastardly plots, perhaps he will start to feel less guilty - both about the war and about reading that damn book. He wonders if that is why Oliver sent it to him. That seems unlikely, but, he realizes with a pang of sadness, they will never know why Oliver sent Draco the book.
“Forcing your child out of the closet before he’s ready is mean, even if you’re doing it with love and support.”
The door shut behind him with a sharp click, and then Draco was in his arms, kissing him with all of the pent up energy from the evening. Harry moaned as Draco’s tongue entered his mouth, and he pulled the blond closer. He reached up to run his hands through Draco’s hair, only to find that he was still bald for his costume. In Harry’s enthusiasm, he had forgotten. He pulled back and started laughing.
“He’s in the castle,” Blaise said, unflinchingly holding eye contact. Narcissa clicked her tongue in irritation.
“We’re together,” Draco says curtly. Massi shrugs and then flicks his head towards one of the women.
“It’s an experimental lotion,” Snape continued as though Harry had not said anything. “That I’ve been researching for the St. Mungo’s burn unit.”
is.” Potter grimaces and takes another sip of his whisky. Almost a quarter of the amber liquid is gone and Draco has not even had a single sip of his. He raises his glass to his lips and lets the whisky slide over his tongue. It is very peaty and the taste of it recalls memories of home and sneaking into Lucius’s whisky collection when he was fifteen.
“Why does everyone always say that about me?” Ron grumbled. “I did just as well as Harry did in our O.W.Ls. Or, close enough.” He disentangled himself from Pansy and stood up. A frown crossed his face for a moment, then he smiled and pulled out his wand. “Expecto Patronum,” he cried. A silvery jack russell terrier burst from his wand. It landed on the floor and then ran happily around the room. The three Slytherins wore matching expressions of surprise.
place to tell Mr. Malfoy this information. I could, of course, but given your current romantic situation, it might be best coming from you.”
Harry is practically bouncing as they leave Hermione’s office. Draco is finally going to be trained to be an Unspeakable. He knows it will take time, but at the very least it is one step closer to Draco no longer being his asset, and potentially being his partner.
“No, he bloody well didn’t.” She’s going to wring his neck when she sees him. That is something that as a member of the team, he should have told her. She wonders if Draco knows. Then she wonders if it matters whether or not Draco knows. Oliver Wood is Draco’s ex too after all and it might cause friction between them. Friction that could affect their cover story… She pushes the thought away.
“Scurvy cur,” Draco said and Sir Cadogen’s portrait swung open. Harry followed Draco into their pod, for what might be the last time. He placed his bag next to the empty table and proceeded to take out his potion’s book and some parchment. He didn’t hear Draco walk up behind him and he jumped in surprise when Draco’s arms circled his waist.
“Kissing you in the middle of the Slytherin common room.” Which is precisely what Harry then proceeded to do. He leaned in close and pressed his lips to Draco’s. Draco kissed him back greedily, bringing one of his hands up to cup Harry’s face.
“But you want to know the best part?” Harry asked, rounding the corner and reentering the classroom.
Harry looks so much like he did in the shower yesterday morning, that Draco’s body reacts to the memory. He watches Harry’s lips curl into a smirk.
“I know. I can’t tell you how terrible I feel.” He pauses, tilting his head to the side. “Is there any way I can make it up to you? Or to show you how much I like you?”
“Yes.” Potter nods and turns back to gaze over the neighborhood. A gust of wind tugs at Draco’s clothes and he shivers. “Shall we go back inside and discuss what sort of look you’re thinking about?”
“Or — and I know, it’s brilliant idea, no one else could have thought it up — you could levitate it in front of you because you’re a bloody wizard,” Draco said.
“Then I’m glad I didn’t ask,” Pansy says. Granger raises her eyebrows in surprise. It is clear no one has dared challenge her authority before. Pansy squares her shoulders and keeps her face impassive.
Harry had sent Ron and Hermione home before any of this had happened, though Ron had tried to fight him on this.
“I fucked him,” Draco says and Harry feels like the bottom has fallen out of his stomach. He fights to keep his face impassive even as his heart feels like it is being clenched in a vise. “I’m so sorry,” Draco continues. “It was the only thing I could think to do.” And so Draco relates the story of how Massi had confessed that Draco was an enemy of the family and how Draco had come up with a plan to say that the Malfoys wanted their families to work together. Then one thing had led to another and-
He was so on edge that he almost missed it when one of the Death Eaters held open the door to the Room in order to let Nagini slither out. As it was, the snake made her way past their hiding spot before either of them moved. Pansy elbowed him out of the way and pushed her way out from behind the tapestry, stunning the nearest Death Eater before they had time to react, leaving Ron still hidden, frozen to the spot.
“Nah,” Draco said. “Just the first half hour or so. Then I think a house elf is coming to take over?” He looked at Pansy for confirmation and she nodded.
He is not sure how to talk about meeting Massi as he doesn’t want to give away any Ministry secrets, but he manages to talk about him by saying that he and Harry made friends with someone at the resort. He skips over the imperius spell and picks up the story in Milan. It’s easy enough to say that Massi had invited them to come and visit his city, and this also explains their invitation to La Scala.
Finally, after what seems like hours of thinking, but is really only fifteen minutes, he falls asleep, still with his arm wrapped around Draco.
“Not really,” he says. “Pansy’s in Argentina, Blaise’s wife has just had a baby and Theo’s in America.” He pauses, frowns. “In case it has escaped your notice, Potter, I don’t
“Ron?” he calls. The back of the shop is as much of a mess as it had been the last time Harry was here. But he supposes with the Christmas season upon them, they wouldn’t have had much time to tidy.
he had expected, but the impact jarred his arms as the blade cut through both flesh and bone of the snake. It was such a shock that he dropped the sword. It clattered to the floor, along with the snake’s head which rolled a couple of times before coming to a stop in front of Pansy. She made a face as she looked down at it and kicked at it with the heel of her shoe.
“My parents are old,” Draco says, thinking fast so as not to be on the Battaglia family kill list. After all, if there is anything that Draco Malfoy is all about, it is not getting himself killed. Even if it makes him a coward. “And they’re under strict Ministry surveillance.” Massi nods slowly. “Ah, fuck, Massi. This is not going how the way I planned.”
“What?” he says dumbly, staring at the book that is now somehow crab walking its way over to them. It’s the Reliquary. Only, it has pages again.
He did his best to listen in to the conversations around him, but they were surprisingly mundane. Clearly no one was talking about their plans to take over the world over Christmas lunch.
And now she would be working next to Greg at Flourish and Blotts. She wonders if he’s still the same as he had been in school. Draco has changed a bit, but under his somewhat more mature exterior, she can still see flashes of the prickly teenager he had been.
“Closer together,” Gillian instructs. They move towards each other until they are face to face. Before he can stop himself, Draco reaches out an pulls Harry flush against him. He tells himself it’s for the pictures, but he knows it’s more than that. There is a flash as the camera goes off. Draco ignores it.
When Harry had suggested reopening The Parlour to Hermione, she had seemed pleased with his ingenuity and had immediately approved both the funds and the team to do it.
Once Draco’s shirt is gone, Harry leans down again and begins kissing the side of Draco’s neck. He slowly makes his way down Draco’s torso, kissing and nipping as he goes, until he reaches the waistband of Draco’s trousers. He pauses there, staring up at Draco with unconcealed lust in his eyes.
“Wonderful,” he says. The word rolls around his mouth like a marble. “You’re first-rate, you know that?”
“No,” he says, but he can’t keep the smile off of his face. It is infectious, and Draco finds himself smiling too.
“Do you think we could get away with it?” Draco looked around the room. Most people seemed involved in their conversations or their dancing.
“Harry,” Ron said, putting a hand on his shoulder. “I wouldn’t call my mum’s jumpers ‘nice’. They are comfy, not fancy.”
“What makes you say that?” Pansy asks. McLaggen looks around again. Pansy sighs and pulls out her wand. “Muffliato,” she says. It is a spell Potter had shown her a little while ago that muffles conversations so that people can’t overhear them. She wonders why it is not in any Ministry guidelines. McLaggen looks at her in confusion, so she explains the spell. He nods and his shoulders relax a bit.
“Kreacher,” Dumbledore said. “Do you still have the other locket?” At this, tears welled in Kreacher’s eyes again.
“You did,” he says as Harry bucks slightly. Harry finishes undoing the buttons on his flannel shirt and slips it off of his shoulders, letting it drop onto the bed next to Draco. Draco bites his lip, looking up at him, and then reaches out and runs one hand over Harry’s toned stomach. He pushes Harry away while he pulls his arms out of his own shirt. He is desperate for the feel of Harry’s naked torso against his.
“Yes?” He tried to figure out what on earth he could be in trouble for now, but could not come up with anything.
“Though, I suppose you’re probably busy most nights,” he says. “Major.” She claps a hand over his mouth.
Draco had not known Hannah well in school, more known of her. She had been a Hufflepuff and so their paths had not crossed often, aside from lessons. Draco had not gone out of his way to make friends outside of his house during school. In fact if he were being honest with himself, the main interactions Draco had had with non-Slytherins had been his fights with the Golden Trio, which explained his distinct shortage of post-war friends.
“That’s why I think now is the perfect time,” Pansy had argued. “I’ll have time to bring him up to speed before Potter and Malfoy return.”
Justin was sitting dejectedly outside in front of one of the fire pits. He was alone. He was supposed to be with Seamus, but Seamus was inside dancing with Cormac Fucking McLaggen. During what was supposed to be
“Meet at the Room of Requirement at nine?” Harry asked Draco as they made their way out of the dungeons.
“Yes,” Draco breathes. The sight of Harry’s hands on himself while Draco is inside him is so intoxicating that Draco knows he will be using this mental image with his own hand for months to come. Except, he might not have to.
They needn’t have worried. The pub was crowded at this time of day, filled with families presumably visiting Hogsmeade for some afternoon shopping. They found a table in a quiet corner and decided that Blaise and Pansy were the most inconspicuous and so sent them to order the drinks and pick up food menus.
“You’re Draco’s other handler. You need to be at Flourish and Blotts with him.” Pansy rolls her eyes.
The room they walked into was indeed a sitting room area, with a pair of couches and a coffee table. But Draco and Harry ignored this and walked over to the door on the opposite wall.
Looking at the house next door, there is nothing apparently wrong. The lights are off, same as they were when Harry and Draco stumbled down the street on their way home from Hannah’s.
“Are you okay?” She watches as he takes a deep breath and slips his ‘everything is fine’ face back on.
And then they were stumbling out of the fireplace, into the warmth of the pub and their friends were gathered around them.
“But I also think this might be the alcohol talking,” Draco said, screwing up his face. “Either way, it’s not a decision we should make tipsy.” Harry groaned.
Harry ended up doing most of the talking while Draco frowned at the floor. He recounted the Christmas presents and stealing the horcrux, followed by the amazing lunch. Draco did seem to perk up somewhat while he talked about the food, but then sulked down into the cushions when Harry started to talk about his conversation with Nagini.
“It’s an expression, Draco. But, the point being, I already have a costume picked out.” Draco pouted. He couldn’t believe no one wanted to dress up with
“Boys,” Snape said as Harry opened his mouth to retaliate. Harry snapped his mouth shut and turned back to Snape. Draco, glowering, did the same. “I believe you’re forgetting one vital piece of information here.” Harry frowned.
He took another sip of whisky and huddled down in the chair’s cushions. He wondered why he was even bothering to stay at the party. It was clear Seamus had forgotten him. Perhaps he should just go to bed.
“You’re Draco’s cover,” Pansy says immediately. Harry frowns. He thinks there might be more behind what she’s saying she’s playing her cards close to her chest.
Once they reached their room, and Sir Cadogen had called them cowards for not fighting him, Draco propelled Harry over to the sofa and made him sit. He perched next to him, but did not say anything, instead waiting until Harry was ready to talk. Harry was rather taken aback. He had not expected Draco to be so understanding, particularly as the other man had seemed genuinely hurt when he had left him earlier.
“Yes,” Grangers says with another sharp nod. “This is officially a Reliquary matter.” McLaggen pumps his fist in excitement. “But first, I need you to tell me the whole plan behind Agent Wood stealing it. I mean, what on
“Quite.” They sit in silence for another few minutes. He’s had difficult clients before, but if Potter continues to be as reticent as he is now, this process is going to be like collecting bubotuber pus. “Do you want to show me the house then?” Draco asks, breaking the silence.
“Don’t fuck this up, Granger,” Tusneem says as he walks out of the room. “Project Reliquary was your idea after all.” And then he is gone.
Ron and Hermione insisted that the three of them could fit under the cloak together as they all knew each other so well, and they spent a long three minutes shuffling through the cellar and up the stairs together, all the while Harry thought that really they
As he gently eases Draco’s trousers down, he thinks back to doing this earlier in the evening. A smile creeps over his face as he remembers the way that Draco had gone weak in the knees as he had come.
“What was that all about?” Draco asked after Harry emerged from Snape’s office. “You didn’t get in trouble, did you?”
“Professor Dumbledore was widely known as one of the greatest wizards of our time, but I knew him best as my friend.” McGonagall paused here and she brought her hand up and held her closed fist over her mouth as she fought to compose herself. “There will be time to mourn him — and mourn him we will — but we don’t have that luxury right now. Instead, we must prepare for the coming fight. When you spoke to your head of house this week about your allegiance in the war against Voldemort, they will have given you instructions on what to do should there be an attack at the school.” She looked around at the students, her eyes sad. “Regretfully I just inform you, that with Dumbledore gone, an attack is coming.” Whispers broke out across the hall. “I know that you have observed the various, ah, improvements we have made to the castle throughout the week,” McGonagall continued.
The following morning, Draco is awoken, quite suddenly, by a roaring noise. He sits bolt upright in bed, and looks around the room blearily. The roaring appears to be coming from the hallway. He scrabbles around on the bedside table for his wand before remembering that Potter had confiscated it. “
“Enough,” Snape said. “That was much better, Potter.” Harry thought Snape looked every so slightly impressed. But that could have been a trick of the light.
“Fine,” Pansy says. “We’ll wait.” She slumps down in her seat. Draco watches as she takes one of the rings off of her fingers and spins it on the table top. She’s clearly put out about Greg and her suggestions of going under cover and now of seducing a mark have him convinced their relationship is doomed. He wishes she would just rip off the plaster. But perhaps she’s waiting until after the holidays. No need to ruin Christmas, after all.
“By poorly, you mean, we won’t talk to each other for about two days and then everything will go back to normal?” She ground her teeth in frustration. What irritated her most was that Blaise was making sense. She
“This is quite unexpected,” Dumbledore continued, once Draco was standing. Draco wasn’t sure, but he thought the headmaster sounded disappointed. Had he been expecting someone else?
“Bump in the road,” she said. “Look at them now.” The three of them leaned over the front of the bar to ogle at Harry and Draco, but the pair didn’t notice them. They were too wrapped up in whatever it was they were talking about. Pansy leaned back again and shrugged.
“-Oh yes you fucking did,” Draco snaps. He moves his chair violently away from Massi and Massi’s hand falls off of his knee. In all of this, Draco had forgotten it was there.
“He’s right,” Pansy said. Draco continued to scowl and transferred the cat to his shoulder. He turned and stared at the shelves of liquor, trying to decide what he wanted to make first. He, of course, had volunteered to bartend for at least part of the evening.
“Ah,” Draco said, looking the redhead up and down. “So you’re saying he didn’t want to be the short, fat, goat guy?”
“The clothes. Where did they go?” Harry gestured to the bench that Draco was sitting on as if to indicate where the clothes should be.
Draco starts by running his hands over Massi’s back, slowly working his way southwards. Massi shivers under the contact. When Draco reaches his arse, he slows. He circles Massi’s hole gently with one index finger and Massi shivers again. The spells that Draco had performed have made him looser and provided some lubrication. He gently pushes one finger inside, slowly, letting Massi acclimate to it. Then he kicks Massi’s feet wider apart.
“Hmm,” Draco muses. “Do I want to sleep with my boyfriend?” He smirks and sees the tension leave Harry’s forehead. “Get your kit off then.” He pulls out his wand and casts and obscuring spell at the window. It can never hurt to be cautious. Then he locks the compartment door and turns his attention to Harry.
“Allow me to show you that not all Gryffidors are jerks,” Harry says, and before he can think better of it, he leans forward and captures Malfoy’s lips with his. Malfoy tastes of wine, which Harry should have expected, and his lips are soft and pliant, parting easily as Harry’s tongue slips its way inside Malfoy’s mouth. Malfoy pulls back after a moment. Harry tilts his head to the side, questioning without words why the kiss had stopped.
“What should we do?” Draco asks. Harry frowns and then runs back inside. He returns a moment later and throws the invisibility cloak around them.
“What’s wrong, mate?” Harry shook his head. He didn’t want to talk to Ron about his fight with Malfoy. He didn’t want to talk to
“Agreed,” Harry said. “And now that we’ve finished congratulating ourselves on how great we are, we should work on shield charms.” There was a smattering of grumbles, but it didn’t take long before they were on all their feet. Harry walked them through the basics before instructing them to cast their shields. He walked around, correcting and encouraging as needed, until he was sure they had mastered it. Then, he started shooting scores of stinging jinxes at them. Only Hermione managed to keep him out.
“I don’t think we should risk it,” Draco said after a long moment. He ran a hand through his hair, causing it to stick up in various directions. “Fuck. I don’t know what to do.”
Narcissa greets them as they step out of the fireplace. She sweeps Draco into her arms and then, to Harry’s surprise, does the same with him. He brings his arms up awkwardly and pats her gently on the back. Lucius is more more straightforward and just shakes Harry’s hand.
“When I found them last night, Draco and Potter were on a date. Could that be their cover?” Draco turns to look at Pansy. She stares innocently back at him, but there is a sparkle in her eye that tells him that she’s doing this to make him uncomfortable again. The way that she did with that heat tracking nonsense.
“Protecting him?” Pansy asks, incredulous. “You’re the one who suggested we train him. And may I point out, he’s been an absolute boon in the field.” Pansy notices then that Harry and Draco are there. She gives Draco a nod welcoming nod before turning her attention back to Hermione.
As it was, the Leaky Cauldron was all but deserted when the pair of them stumbled out of the fireplace. The only two people there were Tom, the wizened barkeep, and an older man who was nursing a glass of what looked like Firewhisky, even though it was only just verging on ten in the morning.
“Fat suit. Then we’ll put your costume over that. We figured pillows wouldn’t stay up well enough, so Bertie made you a full on suit.”
“No,” Pansy says. She slams her hand down on the table and Harry jerks back in surprise. “I won’t let you.”
In order to stay out of the way, Massi takes Harry and Draco to lunch. He has not let Harry and Draco alone for a moment since waking up and Draco is glad that they had talked for a while before waking him. Not that Draco feels confident in their plan per se, but it is fresh in his mind at the very least.
“Let’s skip the pleasantries, Draco,” Parkinson says. “Why did Wood send you The Reliquary and where is it?” Harry watches as the color drains from Malfoy’s face.
The next thing he knew, his shirt was untucked and Draco’s hands were roaming his stomach. Harry shivered under his touch and tried to do the same, but Draco was crouched too low.
Draco is waiting for him when he enters the bookshop, a smirk playing about his features. Harry walks up to him and kisses him hello on the cheek.
He pulled away after a long moment, conscious of the fact that they needed to get their rune finished. Draco’s lips were pink and his eyes were bright, but Harry ignored what he really wanted to do and pulled his potion’s book out instead. Draco followed his lead.
“There’s no need to be snippy. These are legitimate questions. And perhaps it’s not something you’ve discussed before, but I’m new to this and I need to know where I stand. Or, even, where I fake stand.”
“Not even a peek?” Now that Greg has suggested that he not read the book, Draco really wants to read the book. It is the same feeling he had when he was a child, when his parents told him he should not read at night and instead go to sleep. He had done precisely the opposite and stayed up far beyond his bedtime, reading under the covers, consumed by the need to read just one more page and then another, until it snowballed into just one more chapter and so forth. He had come down each morning with bags under his eyes until his mother snuck in one night, caught him at it and grounded him for a week.
He feels as though he is proving himself to be useful. He has spotted things that neither of the other two have and, of course, he’s the only one who can spark while reading the newspaper.
“I might have preferred a bit more privacy,” Harry said. He felt his face flush and he was glad that they were still in the darkened tunnel.
“Dobby,” he asked as the elf made his way back over, carrying four, clinking potion bottles. “Do you always have these?” He waved the doughnut.
“Eh, it was worth a shot.” Now it was Blaise’s turn to prop his feet up on the table. He leaned back and rested his hands behind his head.
“Why is he here again?” Draco asks and Harry could kiss him. Thank god for Draco Malfoy and his impudence.
“Yes,” Harry said. He nodded, more to himself than to Draco, and held out his hand. Draco took it and together they lifted up the Rune and lowered it slowly into the potion. The potion emitted a shower of lime green and neon pink sparks as the Rune sank down into the liquid.
“It seemed like a collection of things people didn’t want found. I saw Trelawney tossing some empty sherry bottles in here once. I doubt she knew what the room was though.”
“Since you asked so nicely, I will.” Draco smiles at her and for the first time since Granger had mentioned training him, he feels a bit more sure of himself.
Taking things in stride was a skill he had honed as an Unspeakable and one that he wished he’d had a better grasp on earlier in his life. He supposed some of it came with age though. And at least this had been a pleasant surprise. He’d had far too many that had been terrible. Not least of all the unpleasant surprise from earlier in the week.
moment we all became friends. What would you say it was?” Ron’s eyes cloud in confusion for a moment before he realizes what Harry is doing.
“What the fuck does that mean?” Pansy snaps. McLaggen takes a deep breath. He leans forward across the table again and when he speaks, his voice is very quiet, in spite of the
“Thanks Dobby,” Ron said. “We owe you a pair of socks.” Dobby looked thrilled at the prospect. Harry took Draco’s hand again and they walked into the passageway.
“Healer Burlington says he thinks elves can still disapparate safely, provided no wizards is around, so Shreeky can drop Master Draco’s clothes outside of the building where Master Draco is.”
The pile is comprised of: Gryffindor tracksuit bottoms, a Gryffindor quidditch warm up shirt (replete with a yellow Potter stitched on the back), some red, flannel pajamas with little, golden roaring lions stitched into them, and a crimson jumper with a golden H on the front that is very obviously homemade. Draco sighs and shrugs out of his jacket.
And on top of that, he’d been an insensitive jerk when he had blindsided Malfoy with the information that Parkinson was there when Oliver had died. He had been so wrapped up in his own emotions, he hadn't noticed how upset the other man was until he’d set a fucking napkin aflame.
“But then what badge do you keep flashing at people? Like security? Or the line of people outside of Bertie’s office?”
Pansy shifts uneasily from foot to foot. She knows she shouldn’t be nervous. This, after all the things she’s done in her career, is nothing. And yet…
to be friends with Harry. That should keep them at bay for the moment, but Draco it does make it more imperative that you at least complete
“Fuck yes, I do.” Draco’s hands clutched at Harry as Harry used his spare hand to undo Draco’s trousers properly. “I want you, Harry. I always want you.” Harry leaned in and nipped at Draco’s earlobe before kissing his way down Draco’s neck, all the while the hand on Draco’s cock kept up its rhythm.
Harry orders from a bartender who also seems to know him on sight and Draco starts to wonder how often Harry has been here. Harry hands him his drink and Draco takes it appreciatively. He takes a large gulp and watches as Harry’s eyes sweep the dance floor. Draco takes another sip and then makes his way out into the crowd, holding his glass above his head so as not to have it jostled. He doesn’t look to see if Harry is following him. He just wants to dance.
“You haven’t seen the cabinet, Harry. You don’t know how damnably difficult it is to fix.” Draco took a large sip of his whisky and threw his head back to stare at the ceiling. Harry scooted closer still, until his knees were pressed to the side of Draco’s thigh.
Though Christmas at the Burrow is in fact a thing that is happening and Harry is both excited and terrified. They’re going to lunch at Malfoy Manor - another terrifying prospect - and then staying Christmas night at the Burrow. He’s not sure where they’re going to sleep or what Draco will say about whatever room they’re sleeping in, but the prospect of Christmas with all of Harry’s chosen family is a thrilling prospect.
the bloody Gryffindors,” he finally says. He looks distinctly uncomfortable and Harry feels a stab of compunction.
“Of course you did. But I would expect nothing short of good work from you, Draco. Perhaps you are rubbing off on him.”
“Starting to think?” Pansy asked. “Please, are you blind? I think there’s something more than friendship going on between them.”
Draco feels Harry’s orgasm spasm around him and he lets himself go over the edge, coming hard into Harry. The feeling takes him over, flooding all of his senses, and he cries out.
“I tried not to fall in love with him,” Draco says. This is only partly a lie. He did try not to feel the way that he does, but if he’s honest, he probably could have tried harder.
“Sorry,” he said. “They are excellent though.” He picked up another potato and had it halfway to his mouth when Dobby appeared again. He was wringing his shirt between his hands. Ron slowly lowered the potato.
“Mr. Potter, excuse me.” An excited Luca emerges from behind the Witch Weekly stand. Draco groans, but Harry turns around, a good natured smile already on his face.
“What do you know about the Reliquary?” Draco keeps his face impassive but his heart rate picks up. Why the hell is McLaggen asking about the Reliquary?
Harry quickly decides that skiing is hard. Draco agrees to take beginner’s lessons with him so that he will feel less embarrassed about learning to ski. But while Draco quickly progresses from the bunny slope, Harry stays there for hours. And when he finally progresses to the beginner slope, he quickly discovers that he can only turn left.
“Yes,” he said. “We should.” He stood up and marched to the door of the common room. Then he turned back. “Harry, Hermione? Are you coming?” Hermione stood up and nodded. Harry, however, pointed towards the dorms.
“Where are they?” he asks, looking around as if his parents are hidden behind one of the tapestries in the entrance hall.
“Gladly.” Harry closes the gap between them and presses their lips together. He pulls away after a moment. “Just checking - that’s a yes? Yes, you will go out with me?” Draco smirks at him and Harry’s stomach turns over in delight. Oh how that smirk has made him feel different things over the years. (But was it maybe always attraction?)
“Something like that,” Harry mutters. He stays against the wall for a good thirty seconds before stepping away again. Greg watches him with interest, but Harry ignores this. He nods at Draco.
Snape was standing in the middle of the room, tapping his foot impatiently as he waited for Draco and Blaise to arrive. Pansy was standing next to him, twisting her cardigan sleeve in her hands. Draco quickly realized that he was the only one in pajamas. Had he really slept that late?
“What?” Ron asked, shaking his head slightly to dispel what he’d been thinking about, which was, incidentally, how Harry and Draco were doing in muggle London.
“But they were killed with a knife,” Pansy protests. “A wizard wouldn’t have done that. It’s too messy."
sad, but he was also about to hook up with one of the fittest girls in their year, so his sadness was tempered by desire. It was an odd combination.
“Are you okay?” he asks. Harry bites his lip and nods. Harry’s hands are now on his own erection, and as Draco begins to move his hips, Harry strokes himself to the same rhythm.
“Smash it, Draco,” the real Harry said. Draco glanced at him but then the ghostly image spoke and Draco was mesmerized again.
Harry talks to it quickly and then dispatches the patronus. Then he lowers his wand and his shoulders sag. Draco reaches out and pulls Harry back into his arms and Harry falls into them gratefully, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“They might,” Harry allows. “But it’s a new spell that Hermione came up with and so far no one has been able to detect it through the usual anti-surveillance spells.” Once Harry says this, the Reliquary confirms it, so Draco lets the subject go.
“Sit,” Croaker says as they enter the room. He gestures at the two chairs in front of his desk and they scramble for a minute to bring another chair for Pansy from the side of the room. Once they are seated, Croaker leans forward in his chair and surveys them above steepled fingers.
“I saw him at dinner, and he said he and Malfoy had a fight, which I didn’t think was that strange until he told me they were,” he paused and looked around. The common room was full of chattering Gryffindors, so he lowered his voice and said “dating”.
“He’s a dick, but he’s a dick that likes mine. Don’t you remember that shower story I told you about? You know, on the day that you messed up your-”
In frustration, she threw the shirt down onto the bed and went back to her wardrobe. As she rifled through her many tops, she increasingly felt as though she had nothing to wear, even though the sheer number of outfits begged otherwise.
“It’s tricky, but I think that because some of Harry’s blood lives in Voldemort, that Harry’s not being dead is tethering him to life.”
Blaise and Hermione, and Ron and Pansy sat next to each other, while Harry and Draco sat across from each other. Draco spent all of dinner trying to subtly put his foot on Harry’s crotch with limited success, given how wide the tables were. Seamus sat next to Draco and egged him on while Neville, who was sitting next to Harry, studiously pretended that nothing was happening.
“Now that we have gone through the theory of the polyjuice potion,” Professor Slughorn said on Wednesday morning. “It is time to start brewing it!” He clapped his hands together excitedly. “Professor Snape and I have taken the liberty of stewing your lacewing flies for you. So this brew will not actually take the full month to brew, merely seven days.”
“Yes, that,” Draco agrees. “After that, I left school. Mother insisted that we wait to give me the full Mark, although wait for what I was never sure. And somehow, it never happened. I think perhaps V forgot in all the other things that were going on. I came when everyone was summoned, so what did it matter? I was a Death Eater in everything but the full snake and skull.
“Expecto patronum.” A silver wisp appeared out of the end of his wand and he let out a cheer of excitement. The wisp dissipated after hanging in the air for a moment and Harry congratulated Draco.
“Merlin, Potter. You brought Opus One?” He looks over at the brunet, who looks uncomfortable. After a moment, Potter shrugs.
Joe and Luca sidle up to him and then stand expectantly in front of Draco, awaiting their instructions.
But then, all too quickly, it was gone. Harry looked down at his plate again. Why was there so little of this delicious meat? He knew you could have too much of a good thing, but he didn’t think he would ever tire of that flavor.
“Well, prophecy records are kept in the Department of Mysteries, but they can only be accessed by someone about whom the prophecy was made.”
“I didn’t know I was risking parental wrath,” he said. He shuffled closer to her and she smiled up at him. “That almost makes this sexier.” She rolled her eyes at him.
The conversation flows surprisingly naturally. Harry supposes it’s because he has Draco in common with the senior Malfoys and most of the conversation is centered around him, but even still, he’s pleasantly surprised. Draco regales his parents with the story of Harry and the snowbank and Harry even musters up a self-deprecating smile, helped along by the very good wine that the Malfoys are serving.
When eight thirty rolled around, Draco and the rest of the Slytherins excused themselves from the official Hogwarts party and quietly slipped out of the Great Hall. Dumbledore, who was still sitting at the head of the staff table, clicked his fingers. A moment later, Dobby stood beside him.
“We’re not going to let that happen,” Harry whispered fiercely into his ear. “Because the future I saw was perfect and I am going to fight for it with every fiber of my being.”
“It was?” Draco sniffed. Harry nodded. He lifted Draco’s face up and kissed his cheek, tasting the salty tears on his cheek.
I apologize if my Italian is incorrect - I found these phrases on the internet. Please feel free to comment with any corrections.
“Won’t he find that suspicious?” Draco asks. He’s sure he would if he were in McLaggen’s shoes. Hermione shrugs.
“I don’t deserve you,” he whispers before he can stop himself. “But then, I don’t really have you,” he adds sadly. He doesn’t think he has said the last part loud enough for anyone but himself to have heard it, but evidently Harry does.
“It’s incredible,” Draco says. Because it is. Draco only hopes that he can correctly remember how to get in here. He hasn’t dared use any recording spells for fear that there are detection spells.
The only person he didn’t see in the crowd was Professor Snape, and he didn’t know if this was because he wasn’t in the hall, or if something had happened to him.
They pretended to peruse the shelves as they made their way towards the door and not for the first time, Harry wondered if the Honeydukes owners had any idea that their storeroom housed a secret passageway to Hogwarts. His suspicions were not allayed when he caught the shopkeeper’s eye and she winked at him. He nodded stiffly back at her and flattened down his fringe.
The next day dawns bright and early, but Draco does not wake with the sun the way that he normally does. Instead, he slumbers past his usual waking time and does not stir until Harry prods him awake at ten.
Subduing the fake Hermione proves easier than Harry would have thought. He had sent her a message on his watch saying that he needed to see her in the Cooler and twenty minutes later, she had walked through the door and right into their portable swamp. Harry had disarmed her, McLaggen stunned her and Pansy had caught her from behind as she had fallen down and liberated her of her watch and purse. As a team, they had transported her to a cell and sealed her in, activating the magical faraday cage on the off chance that she was proficient in wandless magic.
“Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson to the manager’s office.” Big Dick’s voice booms around the store. Draco and Pansy look at each other. Draco shrugs.
“We’ll pretend to be spies,” Harry said. He was unsure how that would work or what that would entail, but that part would come later. Perhaps. Or perhaps they would just have silly nicknames for each other and call it a day. They took the first right as instructed and then the second left and were met with an empty corridor. Ron, clearly taking the cue that they were pretending to be spies, flattened himself against the wall hiding the door to the common room and put an ear to it. Hermione stifled a giggle.
“Do you think,” Pansy starts to say, but then she stops herself. Surely, that would be too far fetched.
“Wonderful,” Pansy said. “Can I see it?” Draco held it out to her. She looked at it for a moment before shrugging. “It’s a cup.”
“Agreed,” he said. “Thank you for your counsel. I will bring this topic up at the next staff meeting.”
His feeling of dread is compounded by the appearance of Parkinson. The Major has seemed more interested in their cover relationship than Harry is comfortable with. He wonders how much she suspects and fears that she knows something. But no one has said anything untoward about Harry and Draco’s relationship, so if she does have any suspicions, she has not shared them with anyone. Parkinson is shrewd, however, and Harry doubts she would report anything without being sure. Particularly not if it involves Harry, because she surely knows that both Croaker and Hermione hold Harry in high regard. Either way, Harry is sure to watch himself around her at all times.
Draco starts to get out a bottle of wine before he realizes that he is not sure what Potter will want to drink. He does not want to seem presumptuous. But what if the wine doesn’t have enough time to breathe? That’s all well and good, but what if Potter wants beer? Do they even have any beer? Draco hurries to the refrigerator that Hannah insisted they get. Ernie had even rigged it so that it ran on magic. He pulls it open and sighs in relief when he sees a small collection of cans and bottles inside. He peers at them more closely and realizes he is not quite sure where they came from. He wonders if Greg has somehow already told Hannah about his upcoming date, because if he has, it seems likely that she might have come over and stocked their fridge. She was a thoughtful Hufflepuff like that.
“Right now,” McLaggen says slowly. “Mortimer Banks. Uh, and Algernon Braithwaite.” She’s heard of Algernon in passing. He is another Unspeakable. She waits for McLaggen to list the other members and when he doesn’t add any more after a moment she looks at him in shock. It is worse than she might have thought.
“I’m which case, let me explain it to you. Truth involves a drop veritaserum, or when we were younger, the strongest truth potion we could get. And if you don’t fulfill your dare, we get to jinx you.”
Draco can hardly blame him. The last time Draco had really seen the redhead was at the Battle of Hogwarts, and it had been a less than stellar appearance on Draco’s part. True, he hadn’t tried to kill any of them the way that Crabbe had, but he had rather stuffed up the situation all the same, trying to kidnap Harry to win favor for his family.
“Are you sure it’s a good idea to show the Slytherins the Chamber of Secrets?” Hermione asked Harry on Thursday morning as they were walking down to breakfast.
“There you are,” Ron said. “You’re a threat! That’s exciting.” He sounded overly cheerful, the way that Ron always did when he was trying too hard to lighten the mood.
“Thus, you were the master of the Elder wand, in possession of the resurrection stone, which sits around your neck, and in possession of Death’s cloak of invisibility when you died. Making you, Draco Malfoy, the master of Death.” Draco said nothing, though he stopped pacing. He stared at Dumbledore, wondering if he was going to keep talking, or if he’d have to ask more questions.
“Oh,” she said. “I don’t know. Blaise, what do you think, should we?” She turned to her fellow Slytherin and looked at him imploringly.
“You could always be the Vanessa to my Austin,” Seamus suggested. “You would look great in that silvery mini-dress.” Hermione laughed, blushing. “And Ron could be Dr. Evil.”
“I would cancel classes,” Dumbledore continued. “But I know that there are those of you who would rather have the distraction of academia than to be left alone with just your own thoughts. Therefore, classes will carry on as usual, but no one is obligated to attend. If for any reason, you do not want to go to your normal class, you have my permission to skip it. Classes will resume as normal on Monday.
“Yes, Blond Unicorn, I am. Then we can work on Operation Get Rid of No-Nose Before He Kills Me So That I Don’t Die.” Draco nodded and then gave Harry a small smile. Harry squeezed his hand.
“It’s not everyone,” he says. “It’s Hannah! She’s practically family! It’s not like you were going to keep it a secret.”
“It’s too big for me. Living here alone is— strange.” Draco knows that feeling. That’s how the Manor feels, even though he shares it with his mother. This house isn’t nearly as big as the Manor, of course, but with so many bedrooms, Draco thinks it feels more empty than it should.
“Give her a chance,” he said. “I think you might be under the impression that Hermione’s more uptight than she actually is.”
“Four people, dying on the same street in two months? That seems significant. Not to mention, the person who had owned Potter’s house died of an apparent drug overdose in August.”
“Yes, after you hit her with that teeth growing curse in fourth year, she had Madame Pomfrey fix them.”
The volume of patrons has drastically dropped by this point, so Draco spends his time restocking some of the shelves. He is just placing
“I still can’t believe you were even considering it,” Draco says. He lifts a hand and runs a finger down Massi’s cheek. “You seemed pretty into me last night.”
But McLaggen had Pansy to help him now. She’d had plenty of success before the Reliquary even existed, just using her own brain. Pansy had always thought that had she not been in Slytherin, she might have been a Ravenclaw. Perhaps that was vanity, but she had always done well in her exams, both at school and since. And she was the youngest Major at least a decade. And it can’t really be called vanity if it’s true.
“So tell me more about the Simurgh Society,” she says by way of conversation. “What do you know about them?”
“You look nice,” Harry says once he is dressed. “I can’t wait to take those off of you again.” Draco smirks at him before taking him by the hand and leading him out of the door. They find Massi waiting for them in the lobby and the three of them make their way out into the town.
“That is good,” he says. “That is not a no.” He smiles and reaches a hand out to cup Draco’s face. Draco tilts his head to rest it in Massi’s palm. “It means I will get to see more you you.” He shuffles closer to Draco on the bed and then leans in and kisses him quickly on the lips before pulling away shyly.
“I just know it!” she cries, spittle flying out of her mouth. “You’s one of them Ministry wizards, ent you?”
Lessons were cancelled for all students that day, which terrified the exam-stressed seventh and fifth years, even as the professors tried to assure them they would have time to make up the lessons. Harry, Ron and Hermione reported to Professor McGonagall that they were, of course, on the Order’s side of the war. Ron tried to argue that they didn’t have to, but Hermione made them go just in case.
“Right,” she says. “Now we will work on resisting the veritaserum. By now I’m sure you have felt the compulsion to tell the truth, yes?”
Herbology was the worst. As the last class of the day, Harry was itching for it to be over as soon as it began. He kept jiggling his leg up and down in anticipation all throughout the lecture portion of class. Every few minutes, he would catch Ron’s eye and they would both grin.
“In a soundproof room,” Ron added, waggling his eyebrows. Harry shoved Ron playfully on the shoulder.
“Sounds good,” Harry says, slowly turning back to look at Draco. His tone is nonchalant, but Draco thinks Potter’s irritation is fading nonetheless.
“What’s that?” Greg takes the section of the paper that he just handed to Draco and smoothes it down on the table. He points to the picture on the front page and Draco is surprised to see himself there.
“It’s just you and me, Tom,” Harry said. It was true. He and Voldemort were alone in a corridor on the sixth floor. Behind Harry was a dead end. Ron’s scheme had worked — Voldemort had followed Harry as he’d run through the castle, ignoring the rest of the students. And now here they were, just the two of them.
On top of all of his training, Draco continues to read the Prophet from cover to cover each morning and report on any sparks. He is taken along on more of the subsequent missions with P Squared. Though he is still mostly relegated to being a glorified lookout, he is pleased that he is being trusted to not fall into immediate danger.
“Then what are they doing?” he asked. When Hermione continued to giggle into her hands, apprehension dawned. “Oh,” was all he said.
it was the best bite of meat he had ever had. It was so tender, it practically melted on his tongue and it was rich and savory and he thought he had died and gone to food heaven.
“No, I do not believe so. Not now that you have Mr. Malfoy’s protection.” They were interrupted at that point by the Voldemort-baby giving an almighty shriek. They all turned to look at it. Draco’s lip curled in revulsion. As they stared, the thing began to thrash around, its screams becoming louder and more desperate.
“But when they got to the room where the bodies were, there was no sign of the assailant. Potter said that Malfoy looked out of the window to try to find the perp, but there was no trace of them. We combed that garden for evidence, but aside from some shards of glass, there was nothing. No blood, no fibers - nothing. Potter also said Malfoy had used
“I’m going to go hang out with Ernie now,” he said and stalked away, leaving Harry, Ron and Blaise to stare after him.
“Apology accepted,” she says. “But you still have to deal with Draco for two days. I really do have a shit ton of paperwork to do. Which, may I point out, is also not fair. Or fun. At least Draco talks.”
Around lunchtime, Draco looks up to hear a chorus of oohs, which permeates the entire store. He groans. That can only mean one thing. Harry is here.
Draco stares as he walks down the entrance hall to the door. He’s carrying what appears to be a container of cleaning wipes, and is wearing a small frown on his face.
“Cheers,” he says. “Happy Christmas.” Pansy’s scowl softens and she clinks her beer against his. Harry and Cormac do the same. They drink in silence for a few minutes before Pansy says,
“Our brand,” Draco says without hesitation. “The patina that comes from associating yourselves with the Malfoy name. We go back centuries - all pureblood, of course.”
He had wanted to cry as the Dark Lord had stared down at him, his red eyes flashing, and had instructed him to kill Albus Dumbledore. A summer’s worth of worrying had culminated in that. The impossible task. Coupled with the threat of death if Draco failed. Draco wasn’t sure if it was his death he worried about more, or his mother’s. But the Dark Lord hadn’t been done. As if that hadn’t been difficult enough, Draco had to find a way to bring a group of Death Eaters into Hogwarts undetected… But he had agreed because he had to protect his mother.
She walks as fast as she can down Diagon Alley without turning heads and then walks straight back into Big Dick’s office once she reaches Flourish and Blotts. He is partway through eating a ploughman’s lunch and she walks in just as he is lifting a piece of cheese to his mouth. He puts it down sadly.
Harry is very aware that this is Draco’s first time in the Weasley-Granger house and as he looks around, he sees it anew through Draco’s eyes. The entrance hall is tall and spacious, leading to the dining room, through which the open plan kitchen and family area can be glimpsed. The sitting room juts off to the side, its door just to the right of the stairs which lead to the bedrooms. It’s rather modern, with lots of clean lines and light, though as it’s the dead of winter, the skylights in the kitchen loom dark above them, rather than bright.
The remainder of the week flies by and then it’s Friday and the day of Hannah’s party. Big Dick has encouraged the Flourish and Blott’s staff to dress up for Halloween, so Draco puts on his costume from the year before.
“Well, then I’m sorry for assuming things about you,” he said. He leaned down and kissed her again. She wrapped her arms around his waist and leaned into him.
Greg, for his part, seems to want to prolong the inevitable in the hopes that it is, in fact, not inevitable and that their relationship will magically sort itself out.
“Well, if you know who it’s from, then what’s the issue?” Draco sits down heavily on the bottom stair.
of the Weasley family were there. Ginny kept pushing off the attentive arms of her mother, while Bill and Fleur stood off to the side with Charlie and Percy. Percy seemed to be bleeding from a head wound, but Charlie was patching him up and none of the three of them looked too worried about it. A moment after Harry had spotted them, Ron went hurtling past him in order to hug his parents, dragging Pansy with him as a reluctant hanger-on. Well, there were worse times to meet your boyfriend’s parents.
“Fair,” Blaise said. “Maybe some Ravenclaws know more about it. What if,” he paused for dramatic tension. “It’s a Ravenclaw house secret?”
would make her feel. She had butterflies in her stomach in a way that she'd never had before. It both delighted and unnerved her. She was sad once they reached the staircase and he took his hand back.
There was a loud bang from the far end of the table and Harry started and reached for his wand for half a moment before he realized that it was just Goyle Senior and a Death Eater Harry didn’t recognize pulling a cracker.
“I’m sorry. The woman, she woke up and she screamed. If she hadn’t woken up, I would have just left them alone and gone to the right place.” The first figure clenches their fists. Then they take a deep breath.
It is dull but he makes quick work of it, leaving a tidy list pinned to the wall before heading back out onto the sales floor. He finds Joe and Luca pestering Greg, who is pointedly ignoring them.
Draco continues to run after work, pushing himself to run farther and faster every night. He is grateful for the stamina he has built up from his daily run, as it proves helpful during his various spell casting lessons.
“No, cousin, I think not,” came a voice from the other end of the corridor. Blaise and Hermione looked up to see an auror in full battle regalia coming towards them. Hermione recognized her, though she wasn’t sure Blaise did, so she leaned over and whispered,
he could do that with Draco. Oh, how his heart yearned for it. Or when Hermione and Blaise finished their work on the elevator into the Chamber of Secrets, giving the students a place to hide during the upcoming battle. Which meant that all that they were waiting for now, was the battle itself.
Potter seems to relax more once Pansy’s spinning form has disappeared. He leans back in his chair and stretches, yawning as his arms reach high above his head.
“Merlin, Potter, did none of your friends teach you the proper spells? I ought to take ten points from Gryffindor just for that. What did you use? Scourgify?” Harry nodded. “And I suppose Poppy gave you a cream for that.” Harry nodded again. “That still does not explain why you are applying it here and now. Surely you could have used a restroom?”
He jumps as he feels Malfoy lick the hand that is clamped over his mouth. Harry slowly removes it and they watch as Parkinson taps on her watch briefly before turning back to the back door of the restaurant. She has begun to pull the door open, when Malfoy sneezes. She whips around, wand up and advances toward them again.
Their lips meet again and this time neither of them hold back. Whatever restraint they had shown thus far (very little, if any) is gone. Draco feels practically devoured as Harry licks, sucks and nibbles his way around his neck. He hopes Potter won’t leave a mark, though a small part of him hopes he will. Harry had said that Draco had Harry, but Draco would argue that Harry has Draco too and he wants the world to know it.
“No matter what we think of the man,” Neville said. “This potion is truly miraculous.” The Gryffindor boys nodded in unison and then greedily tucked into the doughnuts.
“I think he wanted to write it out like he was inviting us to a secret mission.” Hermione smiled when she saw the form Draco had created for his correspondence. It looked
“He has unfortunately perished getting something which we desperately needed in our fight against Voldemort.” Draco couldn’t help it. He flinched. He was not the only one.
The client he’s meeting with today is a wizard, however. A new client: Mr. Herbert Pike. They’ve had several letters’ worth of correspondence thus far and the briefcase on the passenger seat next to Draco is filled with Pike’s words and Draco’s subsequent notes.
“Right,” she said. “I don’t suppose there’s a place where the three of us could have a private breakfast, is there? Normally, I would suggest Hogsmeade, but after your little newspaper stunt, it would be best if we were out of the public eye.” Draco looked at Harry, a frown on his face.
“Fine.” Draco turned away and began pacing. Harry understood his feelings - really, he did - but something was telling him that this passage was going to lead somewhere useful. The Room had never yet failed him. Sure enough, Ron came flying back into the room two minutes later, a huge grin on his face.
It took a lot of grumbling, but Ron did, finally, agree to do homework. He even let them go to the library.
“That’s alright,” Susan says. She walks forward and perches on the sofa on Hermione’s other side. She takes the stethoscope from around her neck and uses it to listen to Hermione’s chest. Then she gets out her wand and waves it over Hermione, muttering under her breath all the while. Then she pulls some parchment out of her pocket and points her wand at it. The parchment fills with words and Susan scrunches up her forehead as she reads it.
A spark of guilt flashes through Draco, but he paws it away as he paws his hands across Massi’s chest. He fumbles with Massi’s buttons while Massi fumbles with his. And then Massi is shirtless and pressed up against him, bare skin on bare skin. Draco pulls his mouth away from Massi’s and instead trails a line of kisses down his neck, and then down his torso until he is kneeling in front of him.
She couldn’t deny that they had some sort of chemistry. Thus far, they had worked remarkably well together with their potion. Although she could not see any of the others’, she was almost certain their was among the best. And it did not hurt that he was devastatingly attractive, with his sharp cheekbones and milky coffee skin.
“Really? You think Dumbledore’s going to enforce homework when we’re working on horcruxes?” he asked.
“I mean, I should hope so, mate. You’re dating him.” Harry looks up with a start to realize that Ron is standing in front of him. He is clutching a clear tumbler of a dark liquid and an enameled tiki mug with an embossed, colorfully-painted monkey along its side. He hands the tumbler to Hermione and then takes a slurp from the straw sticking out of the tiki mug.
Then it’s Cormac’s turn. He doesn’t even bother to stand up. He just turns to Pansy and holds his hands out.
“-Yes, yes, your father would disown you.” Pansy waved Draco’s comment away. “Your secret is safe with me. But you need to get your shit together. No staring at each other across the Great Hall, you muppets.”
“I might be wrong,” he says. “But I’m worried about Hermione. She has seemed a bit off to me since we got back from Europe. I hadn’t quite put two and two together until just now, but there have been small things that haven’t quite seemed like Hermione. And I don’t know what that means.”
“I’m here to interview for the open sales position,” Pansy says, tugging her shirt straighter and plastering on what she knows is a winning smile. Richard Burns stares back at her in bewilderment.
“Ok,” Draco says because there is nothing else he can say about that. When the your boss says you will do something, you do it. He doesn’t mention that he has been working on his defensive magic in his spare time because he is sure that he doesn’t know half the things he needs to.
“Perhaps you’re right,” she said to Hermione. “I mean, there’s clearly something there, but then, I think there’s perhaps been something there on Draco’s side for a while now.” Now it was Hermione’s turn to look surprised.
“How does no one at Flourish and Blotts know about your position?” Draco asks. It has never occurred to him to ask until now. Pansy sighs.
Once he is crouched next to the earring, he motions Pansy over and shows it to her, being careful not to touch it. He explains the simurgh to her and she nods.
He was on his second pass of the room when he spotted it. It was on a tall shelf next to a chipped bust of an ugly warlock. His stomach turned over and he made a beeline for the Cup. Draco must have seen his sudden change in direction because as soon as Harry began flying towards the Cup, Draco did too. Harry was about to put on a burst of speed and beat him when it occurred to him that Draco probably needed the win more than he did. He didn’t let up his speed - he didn’t want Draco to think he’d
He sighed and trudged up to the Boys’ Dormitory, pulling off his jumper as he did. He pulled off his tie and tossed it, and the jumper, onto his bed. Then he took stock of himself in the mirror. He wondered if he could get away with just wearing this shirt and trousers. It almost looked like it wasn’t part of a uniform? Except that everyone would know at a glance that that was what it was. He bent over his trunk and rifled through his clothes.
“Fine,” he said. “But I can’t go up there.” He gestured at his face, taking particular care to point out his scar.
“What did you want, McLaggen?” she asks. She waits while he finishes the sip of his G&T that he has just taken.
He turns the sink on and waits for the water to heat up, lounging against the counter as he does. It’s only then that he notices that Potter is staring at him.
At this point a paper airplane landed on the desk in front of Harry. He frowned and looked around to see who had sent it. Hermione and Blaise were staring at the pair of them, hands on hips. Harry and Draco looked at each other and then Harry unfolded the plane.
“I’m glad she found the coffee,” Draco says. He crosses the room to the coffee pot and reaches for it before realizing he doesn’t know where any of the glassware is. Potter notices his hesitation and raises his wand. A cupboard to Draco’s right opens and two mugs fly out of it, landing with a soft clink on the counter next to the coffee. “Cheers.” Draco pours two full mugs and carries one over to Potter who accepts it gratefully.
It’s strange, sleeping in a new bed. The pillows aren’t quite right and Draco can’t decide if the duvet is too heavy or not heavy enough. Either way, it feels foreign on top of him. It takes him a good twenty minutes to get comfortable enough to fall asleep. And even then, he stares at the canopy of the four poster for a long while, taking in the intricate embroidery there, before his eyes finally drift shut.
Kreacher nodded and turned his attention to the locket. Harry was about to offer to help - Kreacher was old and the sword was heavy - when Kreacher surprised him. He brought the sword high above his head and then brought it crashing back down onto the locket.
“You’re just as worried about this as I am, aren’t you?” Draco asked softly. Harry hesitated for a moment and then nodded. Draco frowned.
She shuts the door behind her with a click. Draco starts to reach for the nearest hairbrush, but Harry shakes his head. Draco frowns in confusion for a moment before the curtains at the end of the room twitch and two women come out from behind them.
“You vouched for me at my trial, but not for him,” Draco says, taking a step towards Potter so that he’s right in his face, looking down at him when he says it. It’s a thing that’s bothered Draco for years: Potter’s double standards when it came to testifying after the war. Potter takes a step back and regards Draco cooly.
“I believe,” Dumbledore said. “Miss Granger, that if I die of natural causes, Draco will appear to have done his job, particularly if he then lets the Death Eaters into the school. This should let Professor Snape out of the vow.” Hermione chewed her lip but nodded. Blaise shuffled closer to her and put an arm around her and she leaned gratefully into his side.
“I accidentally came in my pants and I was trying to surreptitiously clean it up.” Comprehension dawned on Snape’s face.
“No,” Pansy says with a quick eye roll. “But all the same, I don’t think Hermione would want you to be the one impersonating her.”
“Is it time yet?” Ron asked. He had finished his slice of cake what seemed like ages ago and now he had sugar and excitement running through his veins. But what he really wanted was alcohol, because while excited, he was also nervous, although for the life of him he couldn’t figure out why. Or, rather, he wouldn’t admit to himself why.
“Yes, that,” he grudgingly agreed. “And then one thing led to another and I was left feeling rather happier and having a mess I needed to clean up.”
“Oh,” Draco says. He walks up to Harry and hooks his fingers through Harry’s belt loops, tugging him close. “Are you?”
“The red marks are mysterious deaths. The purple marks are mysterious deaths where the house has then been sold to a member of the wizarding community.” He points to Harry’s house and Pansy sees that it is indeed purple. “The blue marks are for houses that are on the market, at a below market price, but haven’t been bought by anyone in the Muggle community despite the fact that any and all available properties seem to be snapped up as soon as they go on the market. It makes me think the agents are holding the properties until a particular buyer comes along.”
He is clutching Harry’s hand so hard now that Harry turns to look at him in concern. He forces a smile onto his face. He doesn’t want to make a scene.
“The lovely Ms. Parkinson has stayed over quite a few nights now,” Kreacher informs them. Harry catches Draco’s eye, raises his eyebrows and smiles. “I have assisted in washing her clothes.” He lists off their sizes and Draco scribbles them onto a piece of parchment that Harry has pulled out of his pocket. Kreacher then offers to take the bags that Harry is carrying home.
“I’ve always found it strange,” Hermione said after a minute of searching her mind for a place where they could go, and coming up blank. “That all of the common rooms have such different doors.” Blaise cocked his head to the side and looked at her with interest.
“Er, no,” Ron said. “They haven’t.” He tried not to sound too put out about it. Pansy watched him cooly from behind her fringe. Ron shifted his weight from one foot to the other. The silence stretched and Ron fought the instinct to say something - anything - else.
Harry shuffled closer to Draco in order to make the space they took up as small as possible, rubbing up against him in the process. But he was too worried about being caught to fully appreciate how nice that felt.
When Ron’s expression still didn’t change, Harry shrugged and took a gulp of his potion. As he felt the warmth start to spread through him, he quickly drank the rest of it. He smacked his lips in satisfaction and then flopped back on his bed, arms wide, and let the potion work its magic.
because now all he could think about was his dick in her mouth and how good it had felt and… Fuck. His trousers tightened. Ron worried his bottom lip between his teeth for a moment, willing his nether regions to stop being so bloody obvious, but to no avail. There was nothing for it.
“Ah, Malfoy,” Weasley says. “So you’re the reason we haven’t seen Harry in months.” Draco forces a smile onto his face.
“You know where we haven’t had a party yet,” Ron said on Thursday night. The six of them were sitting at the Gryffindor table along with Seamus and Justin. Seamus immediately perked up at the word party.
Draco looks at his watch and watches as the seconds roll over from eight fifty nine to nine am. He hears the chime of the bell as Big Dick props the door open. They are not anticipating the rush that they had on the first of August, but there will be a steady trickle of regular patrons and Hogwarts families who decided to wait until later in the month to get their supplies. Draco is looking forward to being distracted by customers. He still feels a little unsettled from last night’s mission and he wants the banal interactions of his day to numb those feelings away.
“Pansy,” he says. “I see you're a hit wizard now.” Harry groans, convinced that Malfoy has given away that he has read The Reliquary, but then he notices that Parkinson’s jacket is embroidered with their crossed wand seal. Then he realizes that Malfoy must know he is an Unspeakable as that information is likely in the database that now lives in Malfoy’s head. He wonders why Malfoy hasn't said anything about it. Then he wonders if Malfoy has figured out that is the reason for their date. Harry partly hopes that he hasn't.
As he brushes his teeth, their time in the bathroom stall continues to loop in Harry’s mind until he’s aroused to the point where he needs to take care of it. He spits out his toothpaste and rinses out his mouth, then reaches down and undoes his trousers.
As he does, a flash of silver enters the room and resolves itself into a goose patronus. It speaks to Massi in rapid fire Italian. Draco looks at Harry who shrugs. They have been pretending that they don’t understand Italian all night. It’s true in Harry’s case, but Draco had been pleasantly surprised when the Reliquary began translating things in his head. He listens intently to the patronus. He keeps a bored, pleasant expression on his face even as what Massi’s father is saying slowly becomes clear.
“Fourth year. When I was trying to figure out the clue for the Second Task. She came in and said that Cedric had put his mermaid egg under the water.” Draco scrunched his face up in disgust.
Ernie MacMillen was in what appeared to be a dance off with Michael Corner, and the rest of the students had created a large circle around them. Ron’s mouth quirked up in amusement as he watched Ernie drop to the floor before springing back up again. The Hufflepuff clearly had hidden depths. Corner, not to be outdone, was moving his his back and forth in a way Ron assumed he thought looked attractive.
At the same time, though, she knew she was being unreasonable. Ron could kiss whoever he wanted to, even if she was a Slytherin.
“You’re no fun,” said Seamus and instead turned his attention to Harry. “Would you be our Dr. Evil, Har?”
“I don’t want to call it a murder,” McLaggen says. “Because we don’t know yet if it was a murder, but it is certainly suspicious.”
“Very little is known about horcruxes, Mr. Malfoy.” Dumbledore sounded distinctly peeved again. “I did what I thought would be best given what we know about them, and given the small amount of time that we had.”
It took another twenty minutes of discussion before everyone was on the same page. The Slytherins reassured the Gryffindors that they were not like their parents (in Pansy and Draco’s cases) and that they didn’t want to join the Death Eaters. Blaise said something along the lines of “I don’t like
“Potter,” he said slowly. “You are not here to be punished.” Harry’s mouth made a small o. “Instead, I wanted to give you this.” Snape reached into his desk drawer and drew out a small, unlabeled phial. Harry eyed it warily.
Almost as though Potter could tell Draco had been thinking about him, he appears in the doorway not five minutes later.
“How do we go about bringing that up with him?” Pansy asked. The other five stared at her. “What? It’s an honest question. How are we supposed to plan something if we don’t know the day it’s going to happen?”
He winks at her. And then realizes that by winking at her, he was somewhat winking at Potter and that was not what he had meant to do. After all, he’s not allowed to flirt anymore. They’re coworkers now. Potter is in charge of his protection. That, and he’s still pissed off about him not telling him about Oliver.
The Common Room was empty, as it had been for most of the Christmas holidays, and as soon as they started to walk across it, Harry was overwhelmed with the urge to mirror what they had done in the Slytherin common room. So he turned to Draco and pressed his lips to the blond’s. If Draco figured out his motivation, he didn’t say anything, but he did allow himself to be steered backwards onto one of the sofas. It wasn’t until Harry reached for his belt buckle that Draco pulled away.
The Ballroom at the Dorchester, normally beautiful, is today overshadowed by corporate drab. There are unassuming round tables set with the plates they reserve only for the blandest of functions. Even the candles, many of which are stuttering in their wicks, look stifled.
The Room obliged them by turning into a replica of Madame Puddifoot’s, which Harry detested, but Narcissa seemed delighted by. Harry tried to call Dobby to ask him to bring food, but Dobby took one look at Narcissa, squeaked and disappeared, so Harry called Kreacher instead. Kreacher, of course, was more than delighted to serve a member of the Black family. He bowed so low to the ground upon seeing Narcissa, that Harry started to worry about Kreacher’s back. But then, Kreacher had easily swung the Sword of Gryffindor and destroyed the locket, so he clearly wasn’t as fragile as he looked.
“I was going for mysterious,” Draco said. He looked up, caught Harry’s eye and smirked at him. Harry felt butterflies take flight in his stomach. Even with the Dr. Evil costume on, Draco was sexy.
“How diplomatic of you. How much do you want to bet something happens between them before the end of the year?” The Slytherin girl asked. “I’d wager ten galleons they at least make out before Christmas.” Hermione fought to keep her face impassive.
Quite suddenly, Draco can’t breathe. He needs to get out of this room, to get out of this house. He can’t stay here with Potter. They have too much history. He stands up abruptly and walks towards the stairs.
“More shots?” Seamus asked, holding up the vodka bottle. When no one responded in the affirmative, he changed his ask to an order. “More shots. Come on.” Neville, Ron, Harry and Dean looked at each other while Seamus poured, but as no one actively protested, they all took the proffered shot glasses.
The Leaky Cauldron is not overly full when they arrive. Most of the bar stools are empty and there are plenty of open tables. Draco spots Hannah behind the bar and makes a beeline for a barstool. He does not look back to see if Potter and Greg follow him, but they do.
“Are you okay?” Blaise asked. Hermione was staring at a knot on one of the wooden tables and had been doing so for the past few minutes.
“Horcrux?” McGonagall sat down and gripped arms of her chair so hard that her knuckles turned white. “Polyjuice?” Dumbledore frowned and turned his head towards Snape.
do you have all these adventures without me?” Seamus demanded. Harry shrugged and buttered a piece of his dinner roll.
“Yes, Master Longbottom,” Dobby said. “They are Professor Flitwick’s favorites.” He clicked his fingers and transferred the potions to the tray.
“Not even for a bit? Your mother keeps the house so cold.” He gives a fake shiver and she glares at him, but it’s a wine soaked glare, so it’s not her most effective.
“I haven’t been here in years,” Draco mutters as he and McLaggen walk into St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The last time he was here, in fact, was when his father had had his slight mental breakdown and burned down all their hedges. Lucius had accidentally set himself on fire along with the shrubbery and so had been admitted to the burn unit for a week. It was a miracle, the Medi-wizards had said, that Lucius looked anything like himself by the time they were finished. Now Lucius spends a good twenty minutes each morning applying various glamours in the mirror so as not to alarm his mother or any of their sporadic visitors.
“With some firewhisky,” Malfoy mutters. Hannah meets Harry’s eyes at this point and he shrugs in acquiescence. She hurries away and Harry sits down opposite Malfoy.
I must have been inspired. Please don't hold me to these impossible standards though. ;) It's back to the normal schedule from here on out.
“Thank you.” Draco sweeps out of the dining room, and into the entrance hall, without a backwards glance.
Shrugging, he pulled out a cigarette, then crouched down behind the balcony wall to hide from the wind. It took him several attempts to light a match and keep it lit, but after a fumbling minute, he managed it and lit the cigarette.
“Well, Hermione used to conjure these bluebell fires during the winter. Really, I think she was just showing off because she was the first of us to master it.”
He is so tired most of the time, that he doesn’t have the energy to think about his relationship with Harry. They keep up with their cover of dating by kissing each other at what seems like every opportunity, but Draco worries less about what the kisses mean. Which is not to say that he doesn’t enjoy them - he just doesn’t think about how they make him feel.
“I did!” Draco protested. “I wish you still had your normal face. It makes it much less strange to do this.” He leaned in, eyes closed, and kissed Harry. Harry allowed himself to melt into Draco’s arms for a lovely minute before he pulled away.
“Welcome, welcome, to the Halloween feast,” Dumbledore cried once all of the students were in their seats. A cheer went up in the room. “I hope you all are hungry and are excited for an evening of fun and dancing.” More cheering. “We want you to have a good time this evening, but we will expect everyone to be on time to their lessons tomorrow.”
And so it starts again. The room shifts and they are sitting in a Muggle police station. Draco is handcuffed to the table in front of him. Hermione and Harry sit across the table, both wearing Muggle police uniforms. Draco almost laughs at how incongruous it looks on Harry, but he stops himself.
“Well, come on then,” McLaggen says. He gestures towards Harry and Draco and they walk toward him. McLaggen turns and directs the rest of his team to secure the area and to call in the auror squad.
“Right, boss,” Luca says, saluting him. “We will be model employees today.” Draco does not point out that he is not their boss, because every time he does that, they ignore his protests anyway. In their mind he is the assistant manager, although no one officially holds that position.
“Should we, perhaps, move somewhere else then?” No matter how many times Snape told them he didn't monitor their comings and goings in these rooms, Harry remained unconvinced.
“We might want two orders then,” he says. “Because they’re my absolute favorite thing on the menu.” Malfoy nods.
“Right,” he says. “Yes. Give us about twenty minutes and we’ll meet you downstairs.” Parkinson raises an eyebrow at him and Harry wonders if all Slytherins have natural eyebrow raising abilities.
In Transfiguration, he did make more of an effort, for fear that McGonnagal would take points from Gryffindor if he didn’t. But the teapot that he was attempting to change into a cat still steamed slightly out of its nose at the end of class.
“Malfoy,” Potter says. He’s clearly only just woken up. His face is still soft from sleep and his hair is tousled (not that it’s ever any other way). He’s wearing nothing but a pair of green pajama bottoms with tiny golden snitches embroidered on them. The snitches are flitting around the fabric and Draco’s momentarily distracted by them, at least until the creature’s noises start to get louder again and he remembers why he’s here.
Ron and Hermione are still sitting on the same couch where he left them. Ron’s arms are around Hermione and he is holding her tight against his chest. The knot in Harry’s stomach, which had loosened when Susan had said she was fine, tightens again.
“We should probably ask Hermione if she would want to join,” Harry said. Ron turned pale and quickly shook his head.
“Fine,” Greg mumbles, turning red. Draco doesn't want to push it. It’s not that he doesn’t want to know how his friends’ relationship is going - but he also very much doesn’t want to know how it’s going… He wants it to be going well - but at the same time, he doesn’t want to know how either of them feel about it, in case it goes pear shaped and he gets caught in the middle. He wonders if Pansy will be reassigned as his handler if she and Greg break up and not for the first time he is surprised that she thought the relationship was a good idea in the first place.
Harry frowned. He was decently sure that Draco meant it as an insult. But he could also be referring to the fact that Harry had just essentially just flayed his own dick while they were keeping up appearances. And thus saying that they shouldn’t be keeping up appearances?
Draco was waiting for him in the dungeon corridor, seemingly oblivious to the other students as he fell in step with Harry on their way to their room. Harry had a fleeting thought that people were going to talk about them, but he banished it from his mind. Let them talk.
“Yes,” Seamus said, butting into the conversation. “Everyone says it’s the event of the year.” Somehow he had gotten his hands on a pint of what looked like beer. Harry gestured at it and Draco rolled his eyes but led Harry over to a corner of the room where Crabbe was manning a keg.
“Yes?” Draco asked. The door opened. Harry looked down at Pansy’s bag and made sure that it was properly closed. When he looked up, he saw Narcissa standing in the doorway.
“Ok, so it’s common knowledge,” Pansy groused. She looked disappointed that she had not been the first to know. Then she shrugged and turned her gaze elsewhere.
“Honestly you two,” Harry says. “Do you want me to see if Kreacher will come over? He's old, so I don't know how much help he’ll be. He hates me, but he is
“It was awful,” he said again. He stopped speaking and pitched himself forward onto Harry’s chest. Harry held him close and stroked his hair.
“They’re for the sauce. They add flavor.” Clearly Draco has a lot to learn. Not that he’s planning on learning. If Potter’s going to be cooking, what’s the point in him doing it? Draco’s been known to burn pasta when left to his own devices, and Shreeky has chased him from the kitchen with a rolling pin more times than Draco cares to count.
From all accounts, Davies is very good at his job as Undersecretary. He recently championed Tusneem’s “Be a light in the darkness for our magic free allies” poster campaign, insisting that the posters go up not only at the Ministry, but in all bastions of Wizarding life around Britain.
“Years ago?” Draco looks helplessly over at Potter who is biting his lip to stop himself from laughing.
“Would we be able to play chess in the Gryffindor Common room, do you think?” Blaise asked. Hermione thought about it for a moment and then shook her head.
“There’s nothing wrong with enjoying it,” Draco says. He reaches out, puts his hands on Massi’s shoulders and then turns Massi around to face him. Massi refuses to look him in the eye and Draco stifles a sigh. It’s not the first time he’s fucked someone, only to have them regret it after the fact. Draco bends and moves his head until he is in Massi’s sight line. “Really, there’s nothing wrong,” he says. Massi blinks and frowns.
“Shall we?” Draco asked, reaching out to the door handle. Harry felt a thrill of excitement rush through him. Not even the world’s most awkward encounter had changed his mind about what he wanted to do with Draco. His boyfriend. Even just the word boyfriend excited him. Harry nodded and followed Draco through the next door.
“Potter accidentally tried to curse his dick off,” Draco said. Harry glared at Draco in such a way that he hope conveyed his feeling of intense anger. He ground his teeth.
Harry hurried over to Draco who was staring at his wand as though it had performed the stunning spell of its own accord. He pulled Draco close in a hug.
Harry and Draco emerge in the shadows of a small mews street near the back of the hotel. Harry looks around and once he sees they aren't in eyesight of anyone, whips the invisibility cloak off of the two of them and pushes Draco against the nearest wall, both in one swift movement. He presses his lips against Draco's for a long moment and then pulls away, in the hopes that it will seem like they have just been kissing in the shadows, rather than appearing out of thin air.
“What?” This was Draco again. Narcissa smirked at him and Harry understood where Draco had gotten the facial expression from. He also understood that she had been
The room seemed to go in and out of focus as he stared at the box. He swallowed nervously and then lifted the lid. Inside was a silver signet ring. Looped through the ring was a small silver chain. Harry carefully pulled the ring out of the box and looked at it the engraving on it. It was a family crest, with a large M in the middle of a shield surrounded by dragons. Harry took a deep breath and then met Draco’s gaze.
to pretend,” Harry says, after a moment, a devilish smile on his face. Draco’s stomach flips as he briefly thrills at the thought. But it can’t happen. They both know it can’t happen.
For the first time since joining the Flourish and Blott’s team, she looks at him properly. He has aged into his looks, in a way that he never could have in school. His face has lost any of the baby fat he had and his cheekbones are now pronounced. He had always been larger than Draco, but now it is because he has muscles and not just bulk.
He leads Draco over to the bed and lays him down against a pile of cushions, then he summons his own wand. He feels instantly much more at ease with it in his hand and quickly sets about healing all of Draco’s injuries. He starts with the brain contusion, as that is likely to be the most uncomfortable. He smiles when Draco gives a small sigh.
“I’m not one to judge,” Greg says. “But I would think that if you spent all night fucking, you should probably be on first name terms.”
“Draco,” Harry said, laying a hand on the blond’s shoulder. “The Cup is somewhere in the castle. We’ll find it.” Draco took a deep breath and nodded. “For now, I think we should tell everyone how our afternoon went.”
“Of course,” Draco says, mostly to himself. Those were the coordinates he had given Oliver so that he could apparate into the house without anyone seeing him.
“Yes, yes, Ron,” Seamus said as several people laughed. “Are we all having a good time?” People cheered their approval. “I can’t hear you! I said are we all having a good time?” The roar was almost deafening as the voices mingled and bounced off of the chamber’s walls. Harry looked over at Draco and grinned. It was a perfect moment. Or, at least, mostly perfect.
“I’m fine. Let’s go.” He turns back towards the door and in a moment is through it. Harry adjusts his jacket collar and then follows.
“Fuck me, Malfoy,” Harry whispers. Draco shivers with anticipation. Harry reaches down and grasps him again, guiding him into position. Draco pauses, poised above him for a moment before slowly pushing himself in, centimeter by centimeter. He watches Harry’s face as he does, taking in his slightly glazed expression, his brilliantly green eyes and his sweaty, messy hair.
“You’re also a Gryffindor,” Narcissa continued as though Hermione hadn’t spoken. “And yet you’re here, in the Slytherin Common room. Why is that?”
“Of course,” Draco said. “I had forgotten.” He dipped his head and looked ashamed. “But we learned about portkeys in Charms the other day and I wanted to try my hand at them.”
“Wait,” Blaise said. “Something’s coming back to me. It’s a portrait of a fat lady. I have a vague recollection of someone saying that she was missing after that attack on the Gryffindor Common room in third year. But I don’t know
“I expect Dumbledore would back you up,” Harry said. “Unity in the face of our enemies and all that.”
“Shit, it’s that serious already?” Malfoy shrugs. “After a day? Damn, Potter, your cock must be made of gold or something because he never takes anyone to meet Lucius. Not even the last guy he was in a serious relationship with.” Harry blinks at Greg. He had not been nearly this gregarious in school. In fact, the main noises he had heard the taciturn boy make at Hogwarts were guffaws in response to whatever Malfoy had just said.
.” Another figure, an indistinct man, rose from the cup and wound itself around Riddle-Harry, pulling him into a close embrace.
“Really though,” Draco said. Then he paused and took a deep breath. “I don’t want anything to happen to you. That’s why this is so fucking hard. The not wanting you to die part of me just keeps growing and-.” Harry reached and took Draco’s hand in his and Draco stopped talking.
“Just wondering about the security. I’ve wanted to do an evidence board myself, but I don’t feel there is a secure enough area in the Ministry. I worry that someone from the Simurgh Society might walk in and see it.”
Draco receives a hero’s welcome when he arrives at Flourish and Blotts the next morning. He is about two hours late as he has slept through his alarm, but no one bats an eyelid at that. Even Jamie is reluctantly clapping.
McLaggen perks up a moment later as another medi-witch walks past them in the corridor. He nods at her and gives her what he clearly thinks is his winningest smile.
. And normally she stayed well away from redheads. (Her mother had always told her they were worse than Muggle-borns - but then, Muggle-borns weren’t actually that bad either and was everything her mother had told her wrong?) Perhaps Draco was right. Perhaps she should just say
He is delighted by their little sleeper compartment. It is exactly what he had pictured an overnight train would look like. He and Harry both have their own bunks (Draco claimed the top bunk as soon as they had walked in) and there are two seats next to the beds. Once their luggage is stowed, Draco wastes no time in climbing up to his bunk so that he can lord it over Harry.
“I’m dating Harry Sodding Potter,” Draco says. “Our relationship is highly public. I had to tell them before they saw it in the papers and disowned me.”
“We can’t stay long,” Draco said as they walked into the warm pub. As it was still early, there were few patrons, so they were able to get a table by the fire.
“Yes, and you managed to somehow pick the only restaurant in Muggle London that I had been to. Well done, Potter.” Potter throws his arms up in surrender.
“Well, either way,” Harry said, changing the subject. “I think it’s fine to show them the Chamber of Secrets.”
“Well then you know I was fighting his veritaserum when I said that.” She stares at him and he raises his Occlumens shields as he stares back.
Pansy knows she needs to clear her head. She needs to put this behind her. Agent Wood was a good agent, which is the only reason he was able to do what he did. It is not all on Pansy’s head that The Reliquary is gone. And Pansy knows that. Wood was well prepared for the mission and he was prepared to die for it too, and Pansy knows that it can be near impossible to stop someone who is willing to die for a cause.
“Dunno,” he said. “We’ll have to check. And probably make better microphones.” Harry grinned. They were improvising by just holding their wands, but clearly that wouldn't do for the final costume.
Draco sits opposite him. He is wearing a red sweater over a collared shirt and has a tweed jacket over the top. He looks very English. His hair is freshly washed and lightly tousled. It looks incredibly soft and Harry wants nothing more than to run his hands through it. Instead he contents himself with reaching across the table and holding Draco’s hand. His chest feels like it’s filled with warmth as he watches a smile spread across Draco’s face.
He pulls out his pocket watch and checks it. Twenty-nine past twelve. Perfect timing. He steps forward and makes his way up the front steps. When he reaches the door, he takes a moment to look at it, taking in its shoddy condition and silver, serpent-shaped knocker. Interesting. Perhaps Herbert or his family were in Slytherin. Draco shakes the thought away. He’s not here to inquire as to Mr. Pike’s schooling. He’s here to help him fix up his house. He’s about to use the knocker, when he notices the doorbell. He reaches up and presses it just as the clock ticks over to half past twelve on his pocket watch.
“Why don’t we sit there?” she asked, pointing to a small loveseat nestled in the corner of the patio. It was lit only by the light of the fire pit before it, leaving it much darker than any of the other seating areas.
“I just thought you had a preternatural ability to find good food,” Harry protests. Draco laughs loud and long at this and Harry hides his face in his napkin.
“I suppose.” She didn’t really want to go back there, but they were rather short on options. Then inspiration hit. “What about the Room of Requirement?” Blaise slapped a hand to his forehead.
Draco and Harry have Greg over for dinner that night in order to get him drunk and pepper him with questions. Kreacher makes salmon with a side of the best Brussel sprouts Draco thinks he has ever had and Draco wonders at what point he and Harry might share ownership of the elf (who clearly likes Draco more). Over dinner, they share a lovely bottle of Chardonnay, followed by another possibly even lovelier bottle of Pinot Noir.
“This is a very bad idea,” Draco said in a small, shaky voice, looking down at Harry but he didn’t stop him. Harry ignored his words, instead leaning forward and taking Draco into his mouth.
“Were you not listening during your trial?” Harry sits up and looks Draco in the eye. Harry’s eyes are rimmed with red.
“Harry?” Ron calls back. “Is that you?” Ron emerges from behind a stack of boxes and Harry’s face breaks into a grin.
“I mean, I’ve stocked up on food,” Potter says, continuing on as if Draco hasn’t spoken. “And loo roll. Just in case. You know.” Here, Potter turns to look at Draco and Draco has to admit that he doesn’t know. “In case we go into quarantine.”
“It’s not really Greg’s thing, is it?” Hannah asks. Draco shakes his head, grateful that he doesn’t have to come up with another reason why he hadn’t brought this up around Greg. “We’ll just have to gush excitedly about it when he’s not around. And gush we will. Oh, this is exciting, Draco! We’ll have to have the pair of you over for dinner. Of course, working around Harry’s busy schedule. Sometimes I wonder how you find time to see him. But I suppose that’s why he took you on a month’s long vacation.” Draco takes a long sip of his beer as Hannah chatters on. Greg returns to his seat next to Draco.
Harry could hear Draco climbing up behind him now and he redoubled his efforts. He reached the top of the chute, tapped the inside with his wand and tumbled gracelessly out into the corridor. Draco followed him a moment later, but Harry was already striding away.
I know this is ridiculously late and I am so sorry about that. I was busy writing and throwing a Harry Potter Murder Mystery party and that took ALL of my time. It was worth the effort though :)
Greg, Harry and Draco stumble home half an hour later, all three of them leaning on each other in support. It is a good thing that it is late on a Sunday and there are few people around Diagon Alley as they end up meandering their way from one side of the street to the other on their circuitous route home.
“I don’t know why he did that,” Pansy says. “I think about it all the time. Particularly now that I know he wasn’t acting alone. Didn’t he trust you to help him?”
they would be playing Christmas music now. In fact, he realizes as he looks around the other tables in the pub, they’re even serving mince pies.
There was a thin sheen of sweat on Draco’s forehead and a contented smile on his face. Harry kissed him gently on the mouth and then pulled away. Draco fumbled in his coat pocket for his wand and pulled it out. He was about to whisper a cleaning spell when Harry grabbed his wrist.
“Of course,” Seamus replied. “I'm hoping the alcohol loosens everyone's tongues and they will tell me the truth. I'm desperate to know if Blaise fancies me.”
“Great,” Pansy said. “I’ll add you to the list.” She grinned at him, her whole face breaking into a smile and Ron resisted the urge to do a small, happy dance.
“It is with a heavy heart,” she said once the hall had quieted. “That I must announce the passing of my dear friend, Professor Albus Dumbledore.” Her voice was shaking slightly, but it carried throughout the entire hall nonetheless. No one said anything. Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand, caring not a whit if anyone saw them. He was more sad than he had expected to be, given that he’d known it was coming.
“Hi,” he whispered, pressing a quick kiss on Harry’s cheek. He heard a dull slapping noise and looked around to see Blaise clapping a hand to his forehead.
“Was this your way of attempting to get us even more intoxicated before we made it back to school?” Ron asked. Pansy said nothing, only smirked, which they all took to mean yes.
Oliver is dead. Draco’s got government secrets in his head. And he went and fucked Harry fucking Potter last night. (And this morning, his mind reminds him). He’s not a hundred percent sure he’s not being taken to his death or imprisonment right now. He could go on, but he’s sad and pissed off enough as is.
“But how do we get the students out without alerting the Death Eaters?” McGonagall asked. “And would we bring the Order in to help?”
have slept, had you not demanded to put put into a different house.” They were holding hands and Harry decided the Slytherin common room was much nicer when he had Draco’s hand to hold. It seemed warmer somehow.
“Seamus?” Blaise asked. “You’re dating Seamus?” He tried his best to keep the alarm out of his tone. To his astonishment, it was Harry who laughed loudest at this suggestion.
Next, they are ushered into the wardrobe room, where a fabulously dressed, bland faced wizard named Evander has them change into so many outfits, that Draco begins to lose count. Once dressed to his satisfaction - Draco in a grey silk shirt and Harry in a forest green turtleneck, both paired with black trousers - Evander sends them out to Gillian.
“Trust me,” he says. So Harry does. Instead of worrying about the menu, he looks around the restaurant. It is everything he would imagine a French bistro would be. There are tables covered in white tablecloths, richly upholstered booths and a wooden bar on which sit multiple bottles of wine.
“And by real party, I assume you mean something that as a prefect I would normally have to turn a blind eye to?”
“Who are you?” Seamus asked, cocking his head to the side. He was fully dressed now in a white shirt with a big frilly collar and a blue velvet suit. He had purposefully messed up his hair and had transfigured his teeth. He also had black rimmed glasses and a male symbol necklace. It was very obvious what his costume was. Even if Harry had only seen the movie poster, he would have known Seamus was dressed as Austin Powers.
“Uh, welcome back to my house,” he says. “This is my floor.” And then he feels really stuck up saying it. Because while it’s true that the entire floor is his, it shouldn’t entirely count as a floor. Perhaps he should have said this tower was his, because that
“Banks was walking back from a meeting one day back in July when he heard someone mention the Reliquary. His ears perked up, because as Dempsey’s secretary, it was a project he had heard of before. He slowed as the voices he heard seemed strained. He said he went as far as to dawdle, tying his shoes, in order to learn as much as he can. He heard someone say that they needed to destroy the Reliquary as it could ruin them, but the person they were with said it would be better if they could control it. If the Simurgh Society had access to whomever the Reliquary ended up being, they could control what the people outside of the Society knew.
“I’ve never been big on the idea of immortality. I feel like it would get old quickly.” He walked farther into the study and leaned against one of the sofas that sat in front of the fireplace. He did this in order to look nonchalant, but it was also to keep him upright as his knees were trembling with fear. “I mean, what’s the meaning of life if it just goes on forever?” He paused and weighed his next words before deciding the risk was worth it. “Particularly when you’re spending your immortality as a slave.”
“Everything is fine,” Susan says with a smile. “She’s healthy. Which means that I will be going now.” Harry nods.
“Do you know anything about the your mother’s lost diadem?” Blaise asked. He was desperate. None of his charm seemed to be working. Perhaps he had laid it on too thick.
“Well then, when are you off?” Harry asks instead. Draco pockets his wand again and checks his watch.
“Well,” he says, trying to sound imperious and probably failing as he is quite sure his voice is shaking. “Are you going to suck it or not?”
Draco picked up the parcel that Harry was pointing to and held it up to his ear. He shook it gently and looked pensive.
He is right. Harry’s eyes go wide as he sees the soufflé make its way through the restaurant. It has risen twice as tall as the dish it is in and the most impressive part of it is that no magic was involved in making it (that Draco knows of). It is the perfect end to a lovely meal and as they fall into bed at the end of the night, Draco holds Harry close and thinks that just maybe, everything will be alright.
Before they have the time to start another conversation, the waiter returns, this time bearing plates. One is covered in tiny wonton cups whose edges splay out like the brim of a top hat, from whence the dish gets its name. The top hat filling is in a separate bowl
“So it’s only the cabinet that’s in the Room of Requirement that’s broken,” she explained. “As that’s the one that was dropped. Which means that we can add the part of the spell that’s broken on top of the pieces that are still there and then deprecate the broken bits. That will mitigate having to cancel it entirely and re-cast it, and it means that we can do all of the repairs from here.”
“I would have been fine on my own,” Potter mutters so quietly that Draco thinks he might be the only one who can hear him.
“This is an awkward conversation to have at the best of times,” Draco said. “It’s even harder to have
“I know you put me under the imperius curse,” Draco says. He runs his tongue over his bottom lip. “But you were right.” He takes another step forward. He and Massi are very close now. Draco can smell the alcohol on Massi’s breath. “I did want to suck your dick.”
“It’s my day off.” Pansy turns to look at him, eyebrows raised. “What?” he asks, suddenly defensive.
Pansy narrows her eyes and stares at Granger without saying anything for a long moment. She hopes this conveys that this is serious enough that she’s a) not going to answer Granger’s question because it’s stupid and b) that she can’t talk about it at all in this room. When Granger doesn’t say anything for a long moment, Pansy sighs, refrains from rolling her eyes, and crosses her arms. She reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out some parchment and a quill. She writes down “the Cooler” and slides it across the desk to Granger.
, but if you ask me, I think it is. I mean, if you look at the way that the diadem fits on the bust’s head, it’s clear that it was carved from life. Just the way that the hair looks so natural under-”
“Thank you,” he stammered. He wondered how she would have reacted if she had known that he was in fact Harry Potter. He decided not to dwell on that and instead concentrate on opening his present, because even if Mrs. Malfoy thought that the person her son was dating was someone else, she had still given it to him
They had had two more children, Roger, who Harry remembers as having taken Fleur Delacour to the Yule ball, and Millie, who had been the year below Harry and Draco at Hogwarts. Meanwhile, Chester had graduated Hogwarts with multiple N.E.W.T.s and had gone on to work in the Ministry. He had slowly risen his way up the ranks to his current position as the Undersecretary for the Muggle Liaison Office.
“Alive? Yes.” Harry reaches out with a shaking hand and touches Hermione’s cheek. It is warm to his touch. He moves his hand to her shoulder and gently shakes her. She doesn’t move. Her eyelids don’t even flutter. When he had seen the IV bag, Harry had suspected as much but his heart still sinks.
A few heads turn as Harry enters the room and Draco gets a few curious glances, but for the most part people are more concerned with networking to pay them much mind. Harry takes Draco's elbow and steers him toward the bar. Parkinson does not acknowledge them until they are right in front of her.
“Just helping out, sir,” Harry says and then attempts to melt away into the scrum of people, but fails because Big Dick grabs his hand and shakes it heartily.
At this point the kettle boils and Potter busies himself with weighing out the coffee beans and grinding them. He seems glad to be looking at something that’s not Draco; eager to lose himself in this morning ritual.
“Hermione,” he breathes. He rushes to her other side and she smiles at him. She extends a hand and lays it on his arm.
“Hello,” she says, a welcoming smile on her face. Draco feels the affection from her smile wash through him.
“Couldn’t hurt to try,” Harry said. Snape nodded and pulled his wand out from inside his robes. Harry gulped, but Snape turned to Draco and whispered,
“I’ll think about it,” Harry said, all the while telling himself that no, no he would not. Seamus shrugged, content at the possible commitment to his costume idea.
“That must be why I’m so terrible at it,” Draco announces. He goes back to the seat he was in on the other side of the table and sits down again.
“Yes, because I hated him.” Draco is on the edge of his seat now. He puts his drink down in irritation.
“Yeah,” he says. “Go on, ‘Mione. I’ve got a galleon riding on this.” Harry, who was watching Hermione carefully, thought he saw a flash of panic in her eyes, but if he did, it was momentary.
“Well, you weren’t alive in mine,” Ron said. “But neither was Voldemort. A lot of people died. My vision was directly after the war, or whatever, ended. Pansy was, uh, crying over me. I’d died, you see. And there was just an entire field strewn with bodies.” He shuddered. “It was awful.”
“Yes, you did,” Ron said. “I heard you.” Draco scrunched up his face in a grimace, which all but gave away that they had heard him correctly.
“It’s almost Christmas. Which means we can walk through the Ministry wishing everyone a Happy Christmas,” Harry says.
“Most of our ideas are bad ones,” Harry said, leaning forward to kiss him again. “This doesn’t seem half as bad as some of the others. It’s dark and we’re mostly invisible.”
“Helena,” Hermione said gently and the Grey Lady turned her attention to her. “Perhaps if we explained why we’re interested in your mother’s diadem, you might be more inclined to share what you know with us.”
“I theorize that it didn’t perceive Kreacher as a threat,” Dumbledore said which caused both of them to look up. Draco had forgotten there were other people in the room. He felt exposed.
,” Harry says. “Hermione saved my life by distracting Quirrell using the bluebell flames, which is why she
“Because we could be,” Joe says, appearing behind Luca. “We’ve been good for like a whole week now.”
“You know there’s a reason we do it by hand,” Draco admonishes. The reason being that some of the books react poorly to magic. Poorly being the polite way of saying that some of the books explode, fly away, change colors, catch fire, turn into animals, vanish, etc when exposed to magic.
“No!” before the jet of light vanished, sucked into some unseen oblivion. Voldemort frowned at Harry and lowered his wand. He stared at it with a look of confusion on his face.
“No,” Harry said. “So you’d better work on your disillusionment charms. Because all the sixth years are going to need them.”
Harry and Draco glanced at each other and then lifted the phials to their lips and tipped back the potions. Harry wasn’t sure what to expect in terms of flavor and so was pleasantly surprised when it tasted like shortbread - buttery and sweet. He swallowed it down and then waited for the potion to take effect.
“Happy Christmas,” she said and then clinked her glass with Draco’s and Harry’s. There was a general mumble of ‘Happy Christmas’ from around the table and the tinkle of clinking glasses. Harry brought his champagne flute to his lips and took a sip. Harry’d had champagne before - Seamus had a penchant for sabering bottles of champagne at parties - but he’d never had champagne that was this good before. He caught Draco’s eye across the table and smiled. Some of the tension that Harry could see in the slight draw of Draco’s eyebrows left his face.
He finds himself wishing that Greg were not there. He wants more than anything to talk to Hannah about his and Harry’s relationship, but it’s not a conversation that he wants getting back to Pansy. So instead he describes wandering through the Galleria and hints that he bought everyone Christmas presents in Italy.
He’s not really sure what he’s looking for. He just hopes he will know it when he sees it. And so he casts everything he can think of, just as he had in the previous three places. The fact that he has to try so many spells is the reason it’s already edging past noon and he’s only on the fourth location. But he started with all the spells and he’s damned if he’s going to miss anything by cutting corners.
“Therefore, you will join the Unspeakables.” Malfoy nods again, this time with a bit more vigor. Behind Tusneem, Harry can see triumph in Croaker’s eyes. Beside him, Dempsey stares straight ahead, her face expressionless. “However, as Project Reliquary is an interdepartmental project, you will also work with the DMLEHS.” Croaker stiffens in surprise and Harry sees the corner of Dempsey’s mouth twitch upward slightly. “I will be setting up a special task force and I will give it a suitably top secret name.” Harry knows that this means it will have a suitably ridiculous top secret name. “As you seem comfortable with both Potter and Parkinson, I am assigning them both as your handlers and the three of you will report to Granger.” Harry’s heart sinks. That complicates things.
“Lover boy,” Harry says again. He opens his mouth to say it again, so Draco shuts him up by kissing him.
Harry watched while Hermione raised and both Blaise and Draco decided to call her on it. Blaise won the round with triple aces, much to Draco’s displeasure.
“Oh Merlin,” Seamus said. “You’ve lost me.” Pansy made as if to explain, but Seamus stopped her. “This is a party. I’m going to go act like it’s a party and drink until I can’t remember that we even had this conversation.” He headed off in the direction of the bar but was accosted partway there by Justin who was seemingly wearing Cormac’s shirt and Seamus’s trousers.
It is warm, but not overly so, and Harry takes his time finishing his ice cream. He wishes he’d had the foresight to buy some water as well, as the Cornetto is making him thirsty. He supposes he could apparate home to get some, but that would defeat the purpose of walking home. Instead, he finishes his ice cream, savoring the chocolate at the end of the cone. When he is done, he rolls onto his back and stretches his arms above his head.
Draco climbs to the first floor and starts to look around. There is technically a bedroom on this floor, but it’s the same floor as the sitting room, so he’s not sure he wants to stay there. The second floor has two rooms, one of which is clearly Potter’s, if the clothes strewn about the bed are any indication. Then there are three additional bedrooms on the third floor, though none of them are as large as the ones on the second.
“I mean, it’s not overly exciting right now.” Draco frowns and takes a bite of his toast. It is smothered in butter and then covered in cinnamon sugar. It feels like quite the indulgence for just being toast. But then, Draco reasons, he didn’t get to have any dessert.
Presently the elf comes back, clutching a tray that holds a small bottle and also Massi’s wand. Massi nods his thanks and the elf departs.
“I’m sorry,” Draco mumbled. He blinked up at Harry through his eyelashes and Harry’s irritation lessened at the sight of him. “Why don’t we tell the others to go on and we’ll catch up with them? I mean, there’s no reason why they should wait because I was an idiot.”
“Preternatural ability?” Harry guesses, but the cheeky grin on his face makes it obvious that he is joking.
“It has,” Draco agrees. “How have you been?” Seamus is Draco’s account manager at Ashe bank, one of the smaller Wizarding banks that had popped up after Harry, Ron and Hermione had broken into, and subsequently out of, Gringotts during the war. Ashe’s had been the first bank that would accept Draco as a client, in part because Seamus had taken a chance on him. Over the months of working through mortgage paperwork, they had become friends. In fact, Seamus was the first guest Draco had ever had over at his house for dinner. (Hannah had been the second, while they planned the Leaky Cauldron makeover.)
“I tripped,” he said. Snape said nothing for a moment, only stared at Harry down his long, hooked nose. Then he pulled out his wand and gathered up the papers with a swish and a muttered incantation. Harry picked himself up off of the floor and gratefully took his things back from Snape. With another wave of his wand, the spilled ink returned itself to the ink pot and Snape placed it back on top of the pile.
“It’s going to be a challenge trying to find it though,” Ron said. “Look at this place.” He spread his arms wide and they took in the room.
it to be him, which he was going to take as a good sign. Even if she was just saying it so that he would feel better.
Part of him can’t believe it had turned out so well. He’s almost scared he’s going to wake up and find that evening was all a dream and that he has to go through it all again. The fear that he felt when the room went dark has haunted him the past two nights. He had lain awake for what felt like hours, in spite of his exhaustion, and the only thing that had finally lulled him to sleep were Draco’s snores in the bed beside him.
“Fine. They are fairly inseparable, so I see a lot of Harry, but other than that, things seem to be mostly the same.” Pansy nods. This is good. So long as Greg doesn’t think Draco’s life has changed in any way other than dating Potter, his cover is fine. “It does get a bit lonely sometimes, being their third wheel.” Pansy is not sure if he is trying to insinuate anything, so she stays quiet. If he wants to say something, he can say it on his own. She is not going to lead him on. “You should join us more often.”
“You don’t know how to ski?” Draco asks, turning to look at him. When Harry looks up, there is a smirk of amusement on Draco’s face.
“Do you think you could take me into Ravenclaw Tower at some point. I want see the bust of Rowena Ravenclaw that’s there.”
Draco is awoken in the middle of the night on Monday, by a rattling noise, which is coming from the corridor outside of Draco’s bedroom. As he has work in the morning, he and Harry are staying at his house. Draco is surprised that it hasn’t woken Harry, but then Harry
“I assume we’re going to yours?” Draco leans closer to Harry and lowers his voice. Not that it matters. Pansy knows.
He spots him still at the bar, lounging against it, his elbows propped on top of the bar surface. He is looking straight at Draco, and Draco is sure he has been watching him dance with this man. He feels his face burn, although he hasn’t
But Harry doesn’t play along. Instead, he pulls his wand out and taps his bunk, muttering something that Draco can’t hear. Then he climbs into his bunk, disappearing from Draco’s view.
“I know the principles,” Draco said. He nodded his head slowly which was a contrast to the panic Harry could see in his eyes. “Do you know the coordinates?” Thankfully, this had been something that Harry had helped Hermione with, so he did in fact know the coordinates.
“How many times do I have to tell you? Call me Ernie,” he says, grinning at her. “Let’s get you a drink.” He takes her by the arm and steers her away through another highly decorated room and to a bar that’s being manned by the grumpiest house elf Pansy thinks she’s ever seen. It is there that she finds Potter and Draco. Much to her displeasure, they are with Granger and Weasley, who are dressed as such convincing zombies that she reaches for her wand for a second.
“Harry,” Hermione said reproachfully. But the small Hufflepuff just continued to stare at him, her lips slowly curving into a smile.
“They aren’t a team. They are not his equals. The Dark Lord thinks he is above everyone and that needing support makes you weak, but he is wrong.”
“I’m not feeling sorry for myself anymore,” Harry said. He stroked the back of Draco’s hand idly with his thumb. “You’re here. And we’re not arguing.”
So, I am falling a bit behind on my stories at the moment, mainly because the Stanley Cup Playoffs are on and I keep watching hockey instead of writing. If you are looking for more things to read in the meantime, I recommend my other stories. :D #shamelessplug
After spending the first few courses on edge - he barely tasted the caviar course - the wine started to help Harry relax.
“The Slytherin Halloween Party.” When he stood back, Colin’s eyebrows were so high that they were threatening to disappear into his hairline.
“I still fold. You win. I don’t want to go through the agonizing process of slowly losing properly.”
“Oh, so it’s a party with a secret keeper then?” Joe asks. “You literally can’t give out details? Only the person throwing it can?”
Of course, this year, he was trying something new with the Ehwaz brew, in pairing up students from different houses. But it had been Dumbledore’s idea, and though the man had many crazy sounding ideas, they often turned out to be good ones. And Severus trusted Dumbledore. They both knew that Voldemort was back and was trying to create fissures in the wizarding community again, so Dumbledore had theorized that creating unity at Hogwarts was the best way to combat this. They hoped that by promoting understanding of other points of view might lead to more empathy on the parts of students who might previously have held more narrow views of what it meant to be a witch or wizard.
“So have you thought about your halloween costume yet?” Hermione asked as they started to make their way up the stairs. Her conversation with the Gryffindors this morning felt like it had taken place yesterday, though she realized it had only been that morning.
“How much do you know about Occlumency?” Harry asked, looking up from the lemongrass he was shredding.
of a ‘transition to dessert’ course. As it was, Draco caught his eye and smirked. Harry raised his eyebrows in response and fought off a smile. “This is being a pork, mushroom and cabbage dumpling which is being pan fried.” Harry wasn’t sure how this was a transition to dessert, but if it was as delicious as everything else he had eaten, he wasn’t going to complain.

“The confuso bomb went off in here,” Pansy says, dragging him into the next the next by the arm that she is still holding. Draco shakes himself loose and then looks carefully around the room. He’s not sure what he is looking for. After all, how is he supposed to see something that both Pansy and McLaggen missed?
“And you must be Mr. Malfoy.” He nods, unsure of what to say. “My name is Gillian.” She pronounces it with a hard G.
“You,” he says. “On your knees. I have a little problem that won’t take care of itself.” With one hand, he reaches down and undoes his belt buckle. “You two don’t mind, do you?” He laughs. “Well, I know you won’t complain about seeing my cock.” Massi winks at them and then unzips his fly. He pulls his trousers down around his thighs before sitting down in one of the chairs opposite Draco. His penis stands erect between his thighs, but it is quickly hidden from view as the woman Massi had indicated kneels down in front of him.
“Freedom,” Pansy cried as they joined the rest of the group out in the village proper. She threw her arms in the air and spun in a circle. Harry could not help but grin at her exuberance.
“Does someone need to stay in the Room to make sure it doesn’t change?” Hermione asked. She seemed to have a better understanding of the inner workings of the room.
“I wonder,” Slughorn said as he ladled a small amount of the sunshine yellow potion into a measuring phial. “If that is why your potion turned out so well.”
“What of it?” Pansy asks. Irritation flares in her chest, making her perhaps more fond of Greg than she has been in the past few weeks.
“Sleep is for the weak,” Seamus insisted. Justin shook his head, but there was a bemused smile on his face. After a moment, he leaned over and kissed Seamus quickly on the cheek.
“Uh, I'm Boy-Who-Fucking-Lived,” Harry says, pointing to himself. “Loads of people have fallen on their knees in front of me.” Draco feels a stab of jealousy go through him, though jealousy of what, he isn't quite sure.
He blinks slowly awake and for a moment he doesn’t think about the fact that he and Draco are in danger in a wizarding mafioso’s house. Instead he thinks about the fact that Draco is still asleep in his arms. And about how much he cares about him. He wonders if it is too early for him to say that he loves him. They have only been
“Only because it still stings so much,” Greg had responded. Then he had moved and Pansy had caught a flash of a dark ink on Vince’s pale arm. Her breath had caught in her throat and she had settled deeper in her chair, hiding herself from view with her Charms book. Greg had then punched Vince playfully on the arm and they had made their way up to bed, still chuckling. Pansy hadn’t spoken to either of them again.
“-Can I stop you there?” Ron interjected. Harry snapped his mouth shut. “Look, Harry.” He walked over to Harry’s bed and sat down on the edge of it. “While I am not overly thrilled that you are dating Draco Malfoy, who you date is none of my business.”
It had taken a team of thirty Ministry architects and builders all morning to patch up the burnt out storefront and install the secret base below. Harry was very excited about it. He had bee adamant about the decorations. Florean Fortescue (RIP) was still featured prominently on the sign and the new exterior matched the old as well as Harry could remember it. They had even found Florean’s original recipe book hidden in the false bottom of a drawer. Ministry (house) elves were currently whipping up the first batches in over ten years.
“Eh,” Harry said, waving his hand. “Fuck it. I don’t care who knows.” Seamus took a long hard look at Harry.
“This arsehole tried to get me to give him a blowjob,” Draco says. “By putting me under the imperius curse.” Harry’s nostrils flare and Draco can see a muscle in Harry’s jaw working, but he doesn’t fly off the handle. On the contrary, he calmly walks over to their table and sets the drinks down on it. He sits down on Draco’s other side.
“Well, we weren’t in Hogwarts, but I’m sure you knew that.” Potter nods and takes a sip of his wine. He doesn’t try to fill the silence, so Draco continues. “She was one of the first people who really talked to me after the War. I mean, aside from my parents and my barrister.” Now it is Draco’s turn to take a sip of wine. He is not sure why he is opening up to Potter this way, but it feels good to share. “I guess I shouldn’t have given the Hufflepuffs so much shit in school. They’re clearly the nicest house.”
“Books are a shelter from real life when real life gets tough. - Harry Potter,” reads the sign. Big Dick affixes it to the front of the fort. Draco looks around for Jamie and finds the other man staring daggers at them. Draco leans into Harry again once Big Dick has moved away.
“Thank you,” he said. “But there’s no need to apologize.” Narcissa gave a tiny shrug as if to say that there was, but that she wouldn’t push it.
“You’ll live,” she said comfortingly. “It’s only homework.” Ron sighed but nodded because she was right. It
“But I’ve heard the prophecy,” Harry continued. He looked at Snape for a moment, suddenly unsure if he
“Yeah, weren’t you?” Justin shook his head. “Oh. Well, what do you say? Be my date?” Seamus felt like he was copping out by asking Justing out to only one date as opposed to full on asking him out, but Justin seemed pleased enough. He readily agreed, and then they stood there, Seamus awkward with his hands in his pockets and Justin shifting his weight from foot to foot. Which was precisely why Seamus had preferred their random drunken hookups. Far less awkward.
“Of course,” Harry says quickly. They follow Massi to the alley and he grips both of their arms. A thrill of fear goes through Draco. Massi could take them anywhere. But, he reasons, they outnumber him two to one. And he’s with Harry fucking Potter after all.
“Relax,” Harry mutters, but somehow that makes it worse. Draco’s shoulders are tensed up by his ears now and he can’t remember how they got there. His grip on Harry is tight and Harry wiggles in his arms. Gillian starts to move towards them, but Harry turns in Draco’s arms, ignoring her. He reaches up and puts a hand on Draco’s cheek.
“Does she often use the word lover?” Draco asks, unable to keep an amused smile from crossing his face.
He stares at the laptop screen again. So far the fake Hermione has gone to Marks and Spencer and to Waterstones. Neither of those places are suspicious and Harry is starting to feel restless, just sitting and staring as the dot moves.
“Ah, Vossman’s Nightly Complexion Cream,” he says. “If I had known you had some, I wouldn’t have brought mine.” And Draco realizes, that for all his seeming nonchalance about his appearance, Harry is just as vain as he is.
to believe it.” Weasley winks at Harry in a way that is meant to seem casual but Draco can tell that he is still unnerved by their relationship.
And so the last few weeks of school had passed in a blur of enjoyable lessons and many evenings spent either in the Room of Requirement or the Chamber of Secrets, depending on how they were feeling. So long as they’d been of age, the teachers had turned a blind eye. Even now Headmistress McGonagall.
Draco shrugs out of his shirt and feels Harry’s hands on his torso. He pulls away from Massi and jerks his head towards Massi. Harry understands the unspoken communication and presses his mouth to Massi’s. Draco pulls Massi’s shirt off of his shoulders and Massi lets him. The Italian’s hand scrabble maladroitly with Harry’s buttons but eventually gets them undone. Massi pulls away from Harry and pushes him towards Draco.
Presently Dobby returned and Draco spent the next five minutes mixing up the “Draco surprise” for everyone (1 part rum, 1 part tequila, 2 parts orange juice, 2 parts cranberry juice and a squeeze of lime) and handing them around. Hermione eyed hers nervously.
“What are you doing out here?” Draco asked. He looked around the space for some sort of chair, and, finding none, slid down the half wall of the balcony and sat on the floor with his knees bent before him. There was a small popping noise and a small furniture set materialized in the corner. Draco sighed dramatically and dragged himself back to his feet before sitting down heavily on the nearest seat, which happened to be a loveseat.
“Definitely.” Harry closes the distance between them and presses his lips to Draco’s. After a moment, Draco’s lips part and Harry slips his tongue into Draco’s mouth. Draco lets himself be kissed for a minute or so before he gently pulls away.
“I’m still not sure I am entirely comfortable with luring Death Eaters to a school,” McGonagall said. “Albus, I don’t care if you think it’s a good idea. It’s dangerous for the students.”
“One of you can collect them tomorrow,” Massi says. “But right now.” He doesn’t finish his sentence, instead he leans forward to capture Draco’s lips.
“I’m getting there.” Harry took a deep breath. He really did not want to talk about last year. It still hurt so much to think about it. But he owed Draco this explanation. “Voldemort lured me to the Department of Mysteries, hoping that my curiosity would cause me to pick up my prophecy.”
“Dad, why do you have a letter from the Simurgh Society?” Draco asks. “Why?” Ice slides into Harry’s stomach and just like that, he thinks, the day is ruined.
“What if,” Massi says, bucking his hips slightly into Draco’s and lifting the corner of his mouth in a smirk. “What if you dated both of us?”
“Don’t be. You’re not the reason I couldn’t sleep in. Parkinson is. Who gets up at nine on a Sunday?” Draco does not want to point out that often he gets up at nine on a Sunday. He is worried it will make it sound like he has no social life. That is not the case, it’s just that his body
“Yes, now we only have to worry about the two of them,” Ron agreed. He speared a roast potato on his fork and popped it into his mouth. “These potatoes are excellent.”
Normally during the Christmas holidays, Harry, Ron and Hermione would have been found lazing around the common room, playing wizard’s chess or reading. But not this year. After having spent Friday night relaxing, the three of them, along with Pansy, Blaise and Draco, got right back to work on the horcrux problem.
Presently they stop in front of a building and Massi ushers them inside. They follow him down into the basement where they are met by a bouncer. Harry can’t hear what Massi says to the man, but they are quickly shown to the back of the club, behind a curtain and into what appears to be a VIP area. It is empty apart from them. Draco grins at Harry and Harry rolls his eyes but smiles back.
Year boys’ room. Harry, who had been lying on his bed waiting for the ache between his legs to dissipate, jumped. He sat up quickly.
Draco grabs another plate as it floats by. He doesn’t even look at what it is, just begins to stuff food into his face while Potter drones on. He goes through several plates of sushi before he interrupts.
“For once, “ Draco mutters. Harry’s smile turns into a smirk and Draco feels a hand slide across his lower back and wrap around his waist. Without thinking, he leans into Harry, savoring their closeness. But at the same time, his heart aches with sadness. These moments are so bittersweet. He hates feeling so close but knowing that none of it is real.
As he continued to bare his soul, he realized that tears were slowly trickling down his face. He put his hands up to his cheeks, horrified at how his body was betraying him, but Draco didn’t seem to notice. The blond was gnawing on his lower lip in obvious concern, but his eyes seemed miles away. Once he had reached the end of his latest sentence, Harry stopped talking and stared at Draco.
“That’s a good point,” Blaise said. Ron erased seven and wrote six. Then he erased that and put the numbers one through six down the board.
Harry stands up and throws his arms around her. She stiffens in surprise for a moment before she lays her arms gently on his back. After a long moment he lets her go. He looks over at Lucius and thanks him too, a huge grin on his face. Lucius gives him a small smile in return. When Draco opens his own Firebolt X, Harry has to bite back a desire to suggest they play quidditch in the gardens. This desire is made even stronger when their two remaining gifts turn out to be new sets of quidditch pads and flying robes.
“Of course,” he said again, looking guilty this time, and then he made his way back outside of the privacy curtain.
“Filthy blood traitor Potter,” the elf mumbles but there is no real venom behind it. Pansy bites back a laugh. The elf pushes two drinks towards her and she picks them up. She nods goodbye at Draco and makes her way back to Greg.
didn’t want Harry to die. (So perhaps quite a bit about Harry). But this was his choice that he was making, and he was very sure about it.
“Solved what?” Draco snapped. He was irritated because he had been distracted partway through the arithmancy equation he was trying to work through. It was difficult and fiddly and this was the fourth time he had attempted to check through it.
Harry’s mouth twists in concern, but he stays quiet. He does not want to say anything more on this topic until they reach the Ministry, where someone else can handle all of the questions. He looks down at his watch as it vibrates softly against his wrist. He pulls out his wand and prods it gently. He has a message from Parkinson.
By the time Draco had finished telling Harry everything, there were streams of tears making their way down Draco’s face.
A long memory of Wood’s heist on the Ministry vault where Pansy sees that it is true that McLaggen didn’t try to impede the Hit Wizards, but also helped Wood escape by being part of the group that broke down the door to the room where the Reliquary was housed and shooting spells in wildly wrong directions while Wood ran. Another image of what McLaggen thinks she would look like spread out on a bed, looking up at him, thankfully clothed. Another slap.
Harry wants nothing more than to curl up in his bed, and inhale the scent of Oliver that he knows is still on the duvet. But Croaker had called him in to deal with the mess that Oliver had left behind and Harry can’t afford for his boss to find out about their ill advised relationship, even if it was involuntarily cut short. So Harry needs to be the consummate professional. He takes a deep, steadying breath as he walks down the corridor to Croaker’s office.
So now it is just the three of them in the Cooler. They are discussing Harry’s surveillance idea. Of course, Hermione’s pregnancy has thrown a doxy in the works as Harry refuses to put her in harm’s way.
“Huh,” Greg says. “Interesting.” His tone says he finds it anything but that. Greg does not work at Flourish and Blotts for his love of books the way that Draco does. Greg works there because it is a job.
“That was incredible,” Draco says. Harry sinks fully to the floor, splaying his legs out to the side as he eases onto his butt.
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry says before Draco can say anything else. “Will you be my top secret, most certainly frowned upon by the Ministry boyfriend?”
“I think we should start our own meeting,” Hermione said. “And not just wait for Dumbledore to schedule one.”
“Oh. Shit. Do tell.” Harry shook his head vigorously. “Oh, come on, Har. It’s me. Your best gay friend. Or your gay best friend. Whichever order of words you prefer. I mean, after all, Harry, you did come out to me first.”
“Do you think someone planned for the Reliquary to be out of the country right now?” McLaggen raises his eyebrows.
Plus, Potter wouldn’t be that unprofessional. Not if he knew Draco was the new Reliquary and that they might be working together. Pansy pushes the very idea of impropriety from her mind.
“Can you help us pack?” Harry asks. Kreacher looks around the room, taking in the pile of clothes on the bed.
“All the other Slytherins were mean to you lot, so I went along with it to fit in.” Ron blinked at her. “I’m sorry. Kids are dumb; teenagers more so.”
Because wizards were clearly better, right? They could do magic. They could do things muggles only dreamed about. But something nagged at the back of his mind. Something Blaise had said the other day - that he wished there were a way for wizards to communicate over long distances using something other than the Floo network.
“Let’s join Parkinson and McLaggen up in Scotland. We can see what they’ve learned and if they have any leads.”
Men in suits and women in dull colored dresses mill about the room, forming impromptu circles before drifting apart again. While the dress is black tie, it is clearly not celebration black tie. This is a work function for everyone involved.
“Oh, Pansy Parkinson, you’re going to be the death of me,” he says as he leans far enough over the table to kiss her.
“Surely you could have practiced patronus charms in a less subterranean environment,” Snape said, even as Dumbledore raised his eyebrows in interest.
“Fair,” Draco says. He turns away and walks into the bathroom in order to brush his teeth. Harry follows him. As he picks up his toothbrush, he watches as Harry stands for a moment, staring at the second, empty sink before he seems to come to himself.
“I believe it we were part way through doing this,” Draco said. He snaked a hand around to the back of Harry’s head and pressed their lips together. Harry thought about making a witty retort, but figured that would probably waste time, so instead he just responded by slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth.
“It’s fine,” Harry protested even as Draco stuck his head in and surveyed the mess that his fitting room had become.
“Colin?” Draco asked. He looked behind the two of them and spotted the offending Colin. The fifth year boy looked nervous. He was fiddling with his camera straps.
“Yeah,” he says. “This dirty little cocksucker learned how to fight off the imperius curse in school.” Massi’s eyes are wide and he is pale. It is clear that no one has ever defied him like this before. Draco is more than happy to be the one to knock him down a peg.
The back door opens again a moment later and Harry hears Malfoy’s sharp intake of breath. He turns his head and sees Major Pansy Parkinson with her wand out. Her eyes flash with irritation when she can’t find them. Harry clamps a hand over Malfoy’s mouth, not trusting him not to say anything. Malfoy glares at him but Harry ignores him.
“As I said, I’m dating a professional celebrity. We’ve almost been kidnapped once already - on our first date in fact. So yeah, he’s prepared for all kinds of attempts on his life.”
“Harry,” Ron said, catching Harry’s attention again. “If you’ve finished your breakfast,” which Harry had not, “can we head to potions early? I want to run my costume idea past you.” Harry gave a small sigh and looked down at his little stack of pancakes.
“But reading bad handwriting is.” She snorted with laughter, then reached up and covered her mouth, embarrassed. Ron did not notice.
“No,” Draco says. He thinks quickly. “I thought she was the daughter of a family friend, but I can’t remember her name. I want to tell my mother over Christmas that I ran into her, but it’s going to sound stupid if I can’t remember who she is. Please, Bones, my mother already thinks I’m a fool for dating Harry Potter. I can’t have her thinking I’m an idiot as well.” Bones sighs.
“Ready?” Harry asked, a twinkle in his eye. Draco couldn’t help it - the corners of his mouth lifted in a smile. He was excited, both to see his boyfriend (because really, that’s what he was, their argument be damned) and to see the infamous chamber. He quickly closed the distance between Harry and himself and wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist.
“I wasn’t suggesting you were.” Potter turns away and concentrates instead on trying to pick up the nigiri in front of him with his chopsticks. He is struggling in a way that Draco almost finds endearing, but also that he somewhat judges him for.
“-Look, do you want me to be a part of the Coalition Undermining Nefarious Traitors? If so, I’ll join. But if I do join, we are changing the name because we are not twelve.”
Mortimer Banks, General Dempsey’s assistant, looks up from his desk. He nods politely at her and motions to one of the empty chairs that line the wall of the room. She is not in the mood for idle chatter, so she picks a chair as far away from Banks as possible. If he finds this rude, he does not say it. In an attempt to look busy, Pansy raises her wrist and swipes through the messages on her watch. She has read most of them already, but Banks won’t know that.
Seamus was standing by the portrait hole. He was holding a satchel that clinked suspiciously every time that he moved. Harry grinned at him.
“Well, I am the owner of Death’s invisibility cloak,” Harry says. McLaggen stares at him, so Harry adds “And with it, I mastered death.”
“Uh,” Draco says again. “It was given to me.” He figures that is as close to the truth as he can be without telling the whole saga. He’s not sure how much Banks knows about The Reliquary. Banks frowns at the readout for another few seconds, then shrugs and prods the watch again.
“Yes, yes,” he says. “Do go home. And, uh, rest up.” He looks awkwardly to the side, not wanting to look directly at her any more. Pansy mentally sighs. Men and menses. It works every time.
can be the mole, as the Sim Soc will think she’s still the fake-Hermione. He grins in spite of himself at the thought of turning their own plan against them. But first he has to find her.
She checks her watch as she makes her way down the corridor and finds that Dempsey has left her a message, summoning Pansy to her office. Without missing a step, Pansy alters her course. Within minutes, she is standing outside of the antechamber to the General’s office. She squares her shoulders and enters.
“Mine.” He watches as they turn to face each other, each of them staring daggers at the other one. This is the office politics that Harry so desperately wanted to avoid. He looks down at his hands in his lap, willing them not to draw him into their dispute.
“That thing,” and here he turns and points at the thing that is now advancing back out of his bedroom. “Is trying to eat me. I need you to give me my wand back.” He expects Potter to stare, horrified at the sight behind him, but instead Potter’s face breaks into a grin. Draco stares at him, dumbfounded, as Potter starts to
I am so so sorry this is so terribly overdue. The real world has been very distracting recently. I might have to move to one chapter a month for a bit until I get everything sorted again.
The sheer number of items was overwhelming and when Harry looked at the price tags, he knew he would only be getting a few of them. But he humored Draco and began pulling the first few things on.
“Wasn’t the worst idea,” Draco says begrudgingly. He reached down and pulled up his trousers. “Only because no one caught us.”
As they pass through the Leaky Cauldron, Harry looks around them. He almost stops walking as he sees a man reading the Daily Prophet. Oliver’s face blinks serenely back at him from the front page, under a headline of “Reclusive Ex-Keeper Found Dead”. Seeing it that way feels like a punch to the stomach. He takes a deep breath and then notices that Malfoy has stopped walking. He turns to look at the blond.
“I would have to recreate it,” Hermione stammered. “But I have the basics down. I’m sure I could do it again.”
“He saw it on a map,” Ron said. Harry crossed his arms and glared at his friend as Justin started laughing.
“I try.” She holds his gaze for a long moment before turning back to the parchment in her hand. “We should get this information to Granger.” She taps her watch with her wand and sends Granger a message with their findings. “I wonder how they’re getting on with Swinns.”
“I don’t think it’s nothing,” Harry said. He nudged Draco with his knee again. Draco pursed his lips.
“I will ask Pansy to add you both to the list,” Blaise said. He picked up his bishop and took Hermione’s rook with it. She flinched as the tiny man whacked the castle with his crozier until it turned into a small pile of rubble which then rolled slowly off of the board.
“She mentioned something about taking the opportunity to have a nice long bath,” Draco said. The three Gryffindors gaped at him. “What? Weren’t any of you paying attention when she left?” Draco shook his head at them. “And you call yourselves her friends.”
“Let us go, mudblood scum,” Bellatrix snarled and Blaise rolled his eyes at her. As if that would work.
“Hush,” Harry said, looking around the patio in concern, but they were the only people out there now, aside from the couple aggressively making out in the corner and their attention was clearly
“Anyway, it’s so good to see you,” Hannah says, finishing her long monologue. Pansy realizes she hasn’t really listened to any of it. She has been too distracted by both the decorations, which are amazing, and her own feelings of schooltime regret.
want to dance?” Harry gives a noncommittal shrug, which Draco takes as an invitation. He puts Harry’s hand on his waist and brings his own hands up around Harry’s shoulders. A smile slowly crosses Harry’s face as Draco starts to move his hips, nudging them against Harry to get him moving too.
This is a terrible idea. He should not be doing this. He shouldn’t even want to be doing this. And yet, he can’t stop himself. He doesn’t want to stop himself.
“Of course,” he says stiffly. “Nox.” The light at the tip of Harry’s wand goes out. He hands it to McLaggen, looking for all the world like he would much rather hit the man. Draco hands his wand over as well. He feels more naked without it than he did less than an hour ago when he was actually naked.
isn’t sure why Cormac has been included in their Christmas Eve drinks. It’s not like they have a gift for him.
“So you’re saying that there is potentially a villain out there with every secret we’ve ever had?” Pansy asks. She works hard to control her face, but in the seriousness of the situation it is hard to keep the alarm from her eyes. She takes a slow breath and forces her facial muscles to relax. This is nothing she can’t deal with. She is not the fastest promoted Hit Wizard recruit in decades for nothing.
“I just told you about the time I’d eaten burnt pasta, Potter,” Draco says, flicking his eyes up at the man before turning his attention back to his food.
“Oh fuck you,” Harry said before he could stop himself. “If you had been less of an arse to me in our Occlumency lessons and perhaps I would have done better. But no, you let your petty, years old disagreements with my
“Perfect,” Granger says. She notes this down on a piece of parchment. “And Parkinson.” She looks up at her. “How do you feel about working in a bookstore? The manager, Dick Burns.” She pauses and looks at the name again. Draco snorts with involuntary laughter. “Does he really go by Dick?”
“I meant it.” Draco doesn’t know what to say to this so he just nods awkwardly and starts to look around the room. Nothing jumps out at him.
“What was my idea?” Ron asked. He had been across the room talking with Dean and Seamus when he had spotted the doughnuts and had made a beeline for them. He had most certainly not been keenly aware of the bar area for reasons of ‘Pansy Parkinson was still bartending’. What would make anyone think that?
“Oh, it’s not them I’m worried about,” Harry said. “I don’t care what they think,” he lied. “It’s just all rather new and exciting. But also a little terrifying.”
“That was part of it. But long story short, we went the to Department of Mysteries, only to find that Sirius wasn’t there, but your father was. After I had picked up the prophecy, he and his Death Eater friends demanded I hand it over so that he could deliver it to Voldemort, but we fought them off, at least until more people arrived, at which point it turned into an all out battle. And-” but he couldn’t continue. Tears had welled up in his eyes
“Let’s get her to safety.” Harry unhooks the IV bag from the stand and then bends down to reach under Hermione’s arms. McLaggen takes her legs and on a verbal count of three, they apparate back to the Cooler. Then they take her to one of the holding cells and lay her down on the cot there.
“Who else is on this task force?” Pansy asks. In all the time they’ve spent together in the past two days, the subject has yet to come up. But if the Simurgh Society has someone in their midst with the power to send the Reliquary away for an indeterminate amount of time, she hopes the group trying to stop them might have some similar brass. Though Cormac’s words have her thinking otherwise. She braces herself.
“Mother!” Draco cried. But Narcissa ignored him and kept talking to Harry. Harry mouthed soundlessly. He wanted to defend himself but somehow couldn’t find the words.
“Ginny and I are friends,” Harry says firmly. He does not look at Ron. Ron does not look at him. Draco picks this moment, perhaps the worst of moments, to walk over to them.
“The ring was a family heirloom, so that’s not included in Hogwarts items. Same goes for the diary,” Harry said. “Which leaves three mysteries.” Ron wrote Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Gryffindor in the remaining numbers and then sat down again.
There is something about Draco Malfoy that he just can’t resist. There probably always has been. And now that Draco has suggested that this walk is a romantic one, Harry almost sees it that way. The weather is nice. There are very few people around, and the view of Battersea Park across the river is so green and inviting.
“Do you want me to be upset with you?” Harry asks lightly, turning to face Draco. He is in the process of buttoning up his shirt and the flannel hangs partway open. Draco does his best not to let his eyes linger there.
“Is everything alright?” Harry asks. Hermione turns her head to look fondly at Ron before she turns back to Harry.
“And what would you like?” Draco asked him. He had just put down another aviation in front of Ron, who was sipping it appreciatively.
“I heard a rumor,” he says. “That you have also taken a liking to Gyrffindors, post-Hogwarts. Perhaps a certain Gryffindor turned Puddlemere United Keeper in particular?” To his delight, Malfoy flushes crimson. He watches as the other man takes a large gulp of his wine.
“It’s ok if you want to have time with your lover.” Draco bites his tongue so as not to laugh at Lovegood’s use of the word lover. “Mine is downstairs.”
“Harry,” came a voice from behind him. Harry turned. It was Ron. “What are you doing out here?” Ron was shouldering his way into one of the coats as he made his way over to Harry. Harry didn’t respond.
“Yes,” Ron said firmly. Harry nodded, resigned. He picked up several of the bags and traipsed off to the toilets.
“You called Dobby?” he squeaked and Harry almost laughed in relief. “Did you need Dobby to take these tables somewhere?”
“Did you want to have Professor Thistle check our Rune before we drop it in?” They had decided that since Snape could be quite a prickly fellow, this name suited him.
“Draco Malfoy is the Reliquary, isn’t he?” And then she feels him pushing into her mind. She tries to put her mental walls up, but she’s not fast enough. “Holy shit, he is, isn’t he?”
“Don’t be. It’s fine.” Draco turned to look at the bookcase and Harry turned his attention to it as well. Sure enough, Hufflepuff’s Cup was sitting on the shelf, behind the metal grille. Draco pulled out his wand and waved it in front of the grille. It opened out slowly. Harry held his breath. Draco reached out and picked up the Cup. Harry took an involuntary step backwards, convinced an alarm would go off, or the Cup would explode or some such thing. But nothing untoward happened.
“Pansy?” Narcissa asked, proffering a cracker at Harry. Harry reached out and pulled. The cannon boom of a wizarding cracker sounded again and a bowler hat and a pair of matching scented candles burst out of the cracker. Narcissa picked up the bowler and placed it on her head. “What do you think?” she asked, indicating her hat.
He hadn’t realized how important he could be until they were in the ballroom and he had spotted Thiessen’s associate, Earles. Sure, Earles was a
“What did you have in mind for today then?” Draco asks. He catches Harry midway through a bite of toast and waits while Harry chews. He notes that in spite of an almost full night’s rest, Harry still has dark circles under his eyes. But then, after all the magic he performed yesterday, Draco is hardly surprised.
But they stay professional. Though Harry stays over most nights, they keep their hands to themselves. It is torture. But at least Draco has that copy of Witch Weekly to get himself off to. (Not that he needs it. Images of their one night and subsequent shower are burned in his memory.) In fact, he has several different copies, as their (potentially excessive?) PDA often makes the gossip pages.
“Ho-lee shit,” Seamus cried as he walked into the girl’s bathroom on the second floor. “This is incredible.” Justin Finch-Fletchley was with him. The Hufflepuff looked nervous, but when Seamus snaked an arm around his waist he seemed to relax.
“Thank you for the wine,” he says. “It’s really quite delicious.” Potter gives him a small, tight smile. Draco decides to move the conversation on. “So now that we’ve settled on wine and transportation, are you going to tell me where we’re going for dinner?” He catches Potter mid-sip of wine and waits for him to swallow the mouthful down.
“Oh Morgana, they have a band?” Hannah looks horrified. “Remind me to never host an open mic night.”
But it had happened nonetheless. And as he gently kissed Draco’s sweaty forehead, Harry realized that now, more than ever, he had someone to fight for.
“DM? I was supposed to know it was you from that?” Now it’s Draco’s turn to shrug. Potter had sought him out, after all. How was he to know the man hadn’t known that he and Pansy were the pair behind Briarthorne? They’d been written up in enough magazines.
He reaches up and pulls Harry’s face to his. He kisses him softly and slowly. There’s none of the rush from Halloween night. They are on holiday and have all the time they could want.
