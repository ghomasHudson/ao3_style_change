again." Pansy muttered under her breath beside Draco, rolling her eyes when she noticed the way most of the boys inside the room were blushing as they stared unabashedly at the tall blonde.

with each other – but still, he refused to back down and did his best to keep his hand steady.
"You certainly have your feelings all figured out." She said softly.
Blaise let out a dramatic sigh and spoke up in a pretentious drawl from where he sat beside Aria. "You do realize that it's not that simple right? Clearly, you're forgetting about the politics of it all. The Ministry deciding about what to do with a vampire like Bentley Fisher could have significant repercussions among the vampire community. Not to mention the fact that, deciding

When Aria managed to regain control of her breathing a few minutes later, she gave him a sheepish smile and they both chuckled as they took in each other's ruffled appearance.
." He teased.
"I. Wasn't. Smiling." Draco retorted hotly as he slapped her hand away.
"Well, I
Aria's lips twitched at the way Hannah stared at her shoulders as though she half-expected something grotesque to come out of them.
"Did you enjoy that?"
Neither of them spoke at first, both unsure how the other would react, until finally, Aria broke the tension when she began to laugh. Draco followed, his lips twitching in amusement as he tried to brush his drenched hair back from his face. Smiling, she reached up to do it for him, using her gloved hand to brush the blond hair gently away from his eyes. She used the same gesture to caress his cheek, her eyes soft as she stared up at him, before she blushed and slowly pulled away.
"I'm close..." Draco gritted out warningly behind her.
did. I mean, there were a lot of us back then, I wouldn't blame you if you've forgotten everyone's names—"
Draco glared defiantly at her.
Coincidentally, Aria was also discharged from the hospital wing that week; so rather than endure an awkward week of avoiding her in the Slytherin Common Room, Draco decided to leave Hogwarts and spend the break in his flat in London instead.
"—affected by your veela allure?" Blaise teased.
resort to blackmail and asked me something in exchange for keeping this between us." She told him, ignoring the look of surprise on his face.
He ignored the pleading tone of her voice and glared directly into her eyes.
"You're lucky. Pansy only gave us a 'tour' around our room." Aria quipped wryly, reaching behind her and absentmindedly tugging at a loose lock of hair from the clasp around the tail of her braid.
"What I was doing is absolutely
At the sound of Aria's voice, Hermione looked up, her features creasing with mild surprise.
about her, but for the life of him, he couldn't figure out what it was.
"Do you know what's going on?" Aria asked him.
"You mean Parkinson actually baked that?" She asked incredulously.
After they both finished the water and placed the empty glasses onto the bedside table, Aria pulled off the shirt she was wearing and snuggled back into the bed beside him. They crawled under the thick white comforter to get warm and Draco pulled her against him so that he was spooning her from behind, his arm wrapped around her waist and his lips kissing and nipping possessively at the veelish symbols along her nape.
"Don't joke about that right now." Draco hissed back sharply, glaring accusingly at her as he slowly began lowering them back down towards the ground.
Glaring down at the two Gryffindors, his gray eyes suddenly hardened and an angry, malevolent sneer began to form on his face.
"Parkinson, keep your damn voice down!" Aria blanched at her exclamation and nervously glanced toward the doors to make sure no one had heard her. "You're being ridiculous, how could you possibly think that—"
The expression on Wood's face was tinged with a hint of annoyance as he answered. "Why in Merlin's name would we be terrified of holy water or crosses?"
time?"
"Potter…?"
"—I never got to thank you properly. You know, for catching me during our quidditch game." Aria began uncertainly.
don't take no for an answer, do you?" She teased lightly.
"Is this your way of being
Despite her screams, Aria's entire form was jerked upwards, as though propelled by some kind of invisible force, until she was back up on her feet. Draco paled and took a step back, watching as the expression on her face shuttered and her gaze became empty once more. She twitched her fingers and summoned her wand back to her hand before slowly turning her attention to him.
Neville just shrugged at him and resumed his task of hanging up more banners along the wall.
Aria could only hope that she and Draco never had to cross wands with each other like that ever again.
"So can you tell me now?" She asked idly.
She grinned at him and glanced at a spot across the room, waiting until Draco followed her gaze. He saw an exasperated-looking Hermione Granger sitting at a nearby table; but what really made Draco's eyebrows arch up was the fact that she was currently locked in an arm-wrestling match against
"What?" Draco blinked in confusion at her words and gave her a look as though he thought she was thick. "What the bloody hell does that even mean, Scarhead?"
He squinted into the distance, making out Aria and the female Weasley tailing each other near the Gryffindor goal posts. Blaise, on the other hand, was beginning to look worn out as he managed to block yet another powerful throw by Demelza Robbins, the Gryffindor team's star Chaser.
"You forgot, didn't you?" He sighed.
She huffed and glared impatiently up at him.
"And?" Aria prompted, shifting her gaze back over to Hermione.
He stifled another smirk when he saw the way she was avoiding his eyes, her entire form tensing every single time he got too close or accidentally (or in his case,
From the very beginning, it was
Draco didn't answer; and Aria avoided his eyes for awhile, still blushing as she stared intently into the fire. Outside, the rain continued to pour heavily and they heard another loud smattering of thunder, followed by a quick flash of lightning just outside the cave's entrance.
Draco growled and whirled around, and Aria barely managed to pull his coat off just in time to see him fling a jinx into Michael Corner's face.
Draco's lips tilted upwards into a wicked smirk.
In the end, Slytherin ended up winning the championship against Gryffindor.
been resorted into their new respective houses – something that Ron (and a handful of other horrified students) was definitely not happy about.
Aria didn't even wait for Pansy to finish as she raised a hand up into the air.
"We dated for awhile but looking back on it now, it never would have worked. Draco was too…
"Alright, alright...I got it." Corey grinned at him and scooted closer to the books in question.
"Speaking of which, you're the one who found the Chamber of Secrets right? Do you think you could still access it again somehow?" He asked, his eyes lighting up with barely concealed glee.
" Pansy grumbled, looking annoyed at his comment.
Trying to get through our classes." She spoke to him in a soothing, steady voice, hoping to calm him down.
"Having sex, obviously." Draco deadpanned.
"Wow. So he actually existed?" Hermione Granger remarked.
Blaise scoffed as he took two glasses of wine from the attendant that approached their table and handed one of them to Draco. "You two are already mated, so you're practically married already. Just ask her and get it over with so you can stop with your melodramatic worrying already."
Aria turned to him and smirked at his dazed expression.
Hermione. Ten points to Ravenclaw." Fleur nodded approvingly at her, giving the younger girl a smile. "Another important thing to remember about a veela's name is that it is not of our own choosing. Upon manifesting, a veela's name will magically appear in ancient veelish somewhere along her body. Once mated, the name disappears and appears instead around the wrist of her mate so that only
When Aria just stared him, her mouth opening and closing like a gaping fish, Blaise shrugged and went on.
"When you
"We were just talking about who Pansy set Hannah up with." Draco answered, meeting Aria's bemused look with a smirk. "Frankly, I'm not so sure it was a good idea. Nott's been known to be a little promiscuous when it comes to girls." He said wryly.
"Because she's so beautifully…
lowered her cautious gaze to her uniform.
"This is ridiculous." Potter chuckled, shaking her head. "We aren't usually this awkward and courteous around each other. Remind me, didn't we use to hate each other's guts?" She quipped.
The words cut deep as they rang through Aria's ears and caused her to scowl stubbornly to herself,
Instead of answering, she muttered darkly under her breath, yanked the hood of her cloak back over her head and hastily turned away from him so that he was met with her back.
"Alright, alright. I'm coming." Blaise quipped back as he grabbed his bag before turning to give Aria and Neville one last wink.
She caught him staring fondly at her hair, noticing for the first time that, apparently, Draco's eager hands had somehow messed it up again because her braid was gone and her long black locks were utterly disheveled, hanging past her shoulders and trailing all the way down to the floor.
know everything about
"So Draco." Blaise arched an eyebrow and glanced curiously at him from the corner of his eye. "I couldn't help but notice that the sexual tension between you and Potter seems a lot more subdued than usual. Is it safe to assume that you two are now—"
Sure enough, Hermione's eyes narrowed and she met Aria's indignant expression with an angry, admonishing glare of her own.
his nape. His earthy scent, laced with a hint of citrus aftershave, intrigued her and made her hum a little bit until she realized about a half-second later what she was doing and immediately jerked away, her eyes widening in horror.
His head hurt; and it took him a few minutes before he was able to adjust to the light and focus on his surroundings. It took him even longer to remember everything that happened; but when he did, and Draco realized exactly why he was lying on his back against the cold floor of the Great Hall, his eyes snapped open.
, Malfoy?" She mirrored his smirk and arched an eyebrow at him in question.
"Yes, she did." Draco managed to croak out as he reluctantly sank down into the seat in front of Madam Pomfrey. "But...I'm just a little confused. I thought the bond was only half-formed? I haven't had the chance to affirm it yet."
"Is that so?"
"I'm sorry." Aria noticed his reaction and looked guilty, sighing as she stood up and began dusting the dirt from her robes. "I shouldn't have rattled on like that about something so grim. I just—maybe, we should go."
Corey's voice was so soft that Aria wasn't even sure she heard him correctly. "I didn’t tell McGonagall, but the last thing I remember before it all happened was that I was talking to Draco." He admitted quietly.
"Yes, actually."
"So now you're angry at me?!" Aria gaped at him, looking affronted by his question.
"You know, when the Ministry said they were going to send someone, I had a feeling they were going to send you."
"It's okay. You're obviously busy right now." Draco massaged the back of his neck and glanced toward the exits. "I should probably go then. We can talk about it at school when I get back."
not your parents." Hannah snorted loudly, rolling her eyes.
"Hey, don't just manhandle her like that—" Ron growled but the boy cut him off again as he practically leaped across the table and squeezed himself into the seat beside Aria, causing Neville to protest as he was forced to scoot further away.
by choice, right?"
Draco didn't answer, but the softness in his eyes when he looked up and stared at her spoke volumes.
"Be patient."
"And honestly, what's the worst that he could do if he did find out?! Report you to the Ministry of Magic? Or to the Daily Prophet?
Draco noticed the way she was still glaring at Aria and Greg across the hall and followed her gaze. He watched as Aria smiled at Greg and seemed to laugh at something he was saying. In all honesty, Draco felt a tiny stab of jealousy himself at the way Aria suddenly leaned up to whisper something into Greg's ear but before he could even react properly, a soft sniffle to his right suddenly drew his attention.
"Is that so?" Aria chuckled at the exaggeratedly self-assured look on his face. "Alright then, Malfoy, I suppose you can tag along with me if you want." She shrugged and gestured for him to follow her into the train.
"If the both of you are quite done with your useless little pleasantries." Draco scoffed, tapping his foot impatiently against the ground. "I'd like to get started on these godforsaken chores sometime this year
"No!"
More particularly, she remembered the way her veela senses had reacted to Draco's nearness, as well as the way she had gotten so shamelessly aroused by the mere touch of his fingers against her bare skin. After that embarrassing little display, she knew it would only be through a
A soft hoot caught his attention and Draco noticed that the owl that had delivered the letter was still waiting on the table in front of him.
"Oh yeah."
a friendly smile. "We just finished practice about an hour ago, actually. But congratulations on making the team." When Jenson didn't answer her and instead, gaped at her with an awestruck expression on his face, Aria fought the urge to grit her teeth in annoyance and added, "I suppose that means I'll be facing you both out on the pitch next week."
"Pansy." Draco warned.
"Michael, you're hurting me." Pansy said quietly, trying to pull her hand away.
Because the one who attacked her is now her mate...And a veela—" His voice broke.
"Why?!"
"Why not?" Aria chuckled as she reached over and calmly handed him the bottle of butterbeer she was still holding in her hand. "I've never kissed a girl before, so I'm actually quite curious about how different it will feel."
"I'm fine." Astoria said curtly, not even looking at him.
Neville didn't answer and Aria glanced across the table and took that opportunity to study her friend carefully, noting the look of regret on his face and the way he stared thoughtfully down at the table.
"Am I making you uncomfortable?" He whispered.
She tasted absolutely exquisite on his mouth; like a unique mixture of salted honey and Draco couldn't stop himself from humming in delight as he lapped and sucked all of her wetness up, loving the way she was dripping with so much arousal that she was staining the sheets of the bed.
"That's very interesting." Granger mused, looking surprised. "So in other words, none of the old muggle lores about vampires were actually true?" She asked.
Draco let out a breathless laugh and did just that, his arms immediately moving to wrap around her lower back before he pressed her firmly against the tree behind them. He groaned when he felt one of her long, smooth legs hitching up and locking tightly around his waist, trapping him sensually against her. And then, when she arched again, pressing her front against his chest, it was Draco who had to choke back a tortured moan.
"I said
Zach ignored the tone of her voice and continued, a self-satisfied smile lingering on his face. "After graduation, I plan to become a professional quidditch player." He finished.
At the sound of Draco's obnoxious voice, Aria rolled her eyes.
, after all, the one who killed Voldemort, was I not?" She pretended not to notice the way Corey paled at the mention of the Dark Lord's name and went on.
Needless to say, the punishment for such acts of vandalism against school property was pretty
Narcissa's eyes were slightly glassy.
going, Death Eater." Bentley Fisher spat back, his mouth twisting into a disdainful snarl as he leveled Draco with a malevolent look. "Especially since you and your pathetic excuse of a father should be rotting in a jail cell in Azkaban by now."
"Now I'm only going to say this one last time. Get. The. Hell.
He made sure to keep his voice as neutral as possible so as not to give any of his thoughts away. He wasn't sure exactly
If possible, the pink on Hannah's face darkened even more under Malfoy's intimidating glare.
He growled.
"This is my veela name, written in our ancient tongue." Fleur looked amused at the completely befuddled expressions on everyone's face. "Obviously, I do not expect
"I knew this was coming." Aria muttered under her breath. Ignoring the pain under her right shoulder, she forced herself up into a sitting position on her bed before turning back to meet Ilyana's gaze. "What can I do for you, Ma'am?" She asked quietly.
"I uh…
Aria didn't even flinch as she stood up, using Pansy's momentary distraction to hide the fact that she was uncomfortable acknowledging the deeply personal conversation that had just occurred between the two of them. She ignored the surprised look on Pansy's face as she straightened her robes and began dusting off her skirt.
"Ugh,
She took a small sip from her glass of wine before giving Draco an inquiring look. "When exactly do you intend to ask her anyway?"
Aria was lying down in a bed somewhere; but she couldn't remember how she got there, or why she was there in the first place.
Draco's eyes narrowed when he saw the way Blaise and Aria were obviously not trying very hard to hide their smirks. "Since you're here, I might as well introduce you to the rest of the team—"
to blame then?" Austin offered, chuckling at her embarrassed expression.
Fleur frowned but she didn't elaborate any further as she suddenly straightened in her seat and began dusting her skirt.
When her cheeks flushed and she gaped at him in shock, his eyes gleamed and he stared at her with such a dark, feral hunger that it made Aria shiver and nervously try to move away from him.
"If you recall, Morag, this did come with the caveat that Aria
"Malfoy, I'm the one who almost bumped into you." She pointed out.

"No, it's nothing like that."
He felt a twisted sense of satisfaction when Bentley's face began to turn an ugly, angry purple.

; so gorgeously
more times for Gryffindor, effectively bringing her team to a hundred point lead against Slytherin.
"So it's good old fashioned nepotism at work then? Don't worry, I understand more than you know." Draco mused, chuckling.
At the exact same time this was happening, Aria suddenly stopped in front of the Slytherin side of the bleachers and took a sharp dive down in chase of the snitch, followed very closely by Ginny Weasley. The skill of
of an asshole.
The words resonated with something deep in the very recesses of Aria's magic, and she felt a strange, calming warmth enveloping her entire body. Her wings flared out, stretching impossibly high above her head, and even Draco had to pull away from her, shielding his eyes from the golden light that radiated brightly from her skin. They both gasped as they felt an outpouring of strange, overwhelming thoughts and emotions flowing into them like a powerful tidal wave. Eventually, the light faded away, and Aria felt her wings slowly fold themselves back under her shoulders.
Blaise stilled at the unusual tone of her voice, but he turned to her and answered her with a brief nod.
"No, that's not possible. Draco was with
"Are we really going to do this again?" He drawled slowly, the iciness in his voice causing Aria to blanch and move away. "I just had my tongue down your throat an hour ago. Don't you think it's kind of ridiculous that you're still so afraid to touch me?"
Skeeter ignored Aria's angry remark and stepped closer towards their group. "So...Which one of these young gentlemen is Aria Potter dating? Hmm?" She leered and inspected all three boys' tense expressions.
at me when all I did was tell him to straighten his tie! I'm a prefect after all, I have the right to make sure all my housemates look presentable!" She huffed.
Blaise suddenly broke him out of his thoughts when he plopped down onto the seat beside him and gave him a nudge to the side. Meanwhile, Pansy remained standing and stood in front of them, staring Draco down with a questioning look on her face.
When he saw her lingering by the doors, Blaise Zabini stood up from the head of the table and beckoned her over, causing the rest of the Slytherins to look up when she reached them.
do it?" She blurted out.
Draco's scowl darkened as he watched Aria smile in greeting at the other boy. He strode towards them and knocked Aria's gloved hand away before Greg could take it.
She knelt down, one of her gloved hands reaching out to caress the rough patch of dirt and grass on the ground.
Class is dismissed."
date for this evening wouldn't mind another round with me on the dance floor." He turned to Luna, bowing in front of her and placing a gallant kiss onto the back of her palm.
"Duly noted." Potter answered, looking amused.
"Wait a minute." Aria suddenly realized something and she paused, glancing curiously at Blaise, Zach and Neville. "My hair is down right now and I'm in my true form. Why aren't any of you—"
When Aria faltered and scrounged desperately through her mind for an answer, Draco sneered again and stepped closer towards her – much,
such fascinating creatures." She added ruefully.
"Well, if you must know, I think it's ridiculous that you just had to be a veela on top of everything else." Pansy huffed at her, her eyes narrowing with disdain. "Like the scar wasn't enough? You need even
"I was just thinking about how nice it feels to be so carefree and happy for a change. I...never had this."
Draco's eyebrows furrowed together and he frowned at the steely glint in her eyes. He hoped he was imagining things, but it was almost as though Aria was intentionally trying to provoke him into a fight.
He took a backward step away from her and gently pulled his hand from her grasp.
"So you can do that ugly, harpy-face too?" Entwhistle asked again.
He opened his mouth to answer, but before he could say anything, Morag beat him to it.
"That's exactly my point!" Draco snapped, his voice rising several levels in his anger. "Do you think it makes me happy knowing you were

But none of their suggestions worked!" Hannah wailed, sniffing as she banged her head repeatedly on the table. "Look, I'm not asking for a lot here! I just need some tips on how to make Ernie see me in a more…
for him." Blaise added, frowning.
When he shrugged and answered her with a curt shake of his head, Aria sighed and brushed past him, making her way back towards the direction from which they had come from. She seemed reluctant to push the issue any further and instead, trailed wordlessly ahead of him with a completely neutral expression on her face. After a few minutes of this, which mostly consisted of Draco growing angrier and angrier as he glared at her back, he finally snapped and blurted out the first thing that came to his head.
"That wand hasn't worked for you since the end of the war. Didn't you find it strange that it suddenly works
certainly one to talk. Blaise and I had to listen to you rattling on and on about Potter for the last seven years! The least you could do is—"
Draco smiled back at her, his eyes gentle as he reached up and caressed her face.
"Oh sweetheart, I don't think you get it." Aria's eyes were hard as she curled her lips disdainfully, inspecting his appearance from head to toe. "If I wanted to, I could even call up the Minister of Magic right now and tell him you're a serial killer. A rapist. Maybe even a former supporter of Voldemort himself. A spy for the Dark Lord. Do you know what would happen then?"
much so. Trust me, I've known exactly how much you despise me since the start of the year! It's not something you have to keep rubbing in my face!" She snapped.
"I was being friendly. And in case you've forgotten, Potter's the best student in DADA. Why wouldn't I take advantage of that?" Blaise protested flatly, looking annoyed at Pansy's outburst.
To his resentment, Aria seemed to backtrack for a few seconds. She opened and closed her mouth before she finally looked away and let out a frustrated sigh.
"Done with that nasty long reading assignment for DADA?" He asked casually.
I'm so sorry this update took much longer than usual. I blame work though, because I've been so busy lately that I've only had 2 hours of writing time per day, at most. I actually had to rewrite this chapter so many times before I was satisfied, and I think the amount of words I deleted could form a whole new chapter already lol. I'm still not exactly happy with how it turned out but I decided to post it anyway so we can finally progress with the rest of the story.
"I agree." Aria answered, still chuckling as she watched Ginny effortlessly throw the quaffle through one of the goal posts. When Corey didn't answer her, she paused and gave him a questioning look from the corner of her eye.
to make this all work though." She pointed out in an astute, irreverently blunt tone of voice that vaguely reminded Aria of a more ruthless version of Hermione.
"I asked my father about it, actually. He told me he had to convince the other school governors
"That's enough, you two." Aria interrupted Blaise in a strained, quiet voice, looking up boldly and meeting Draco's vicious glare head on. "Look…No one forced you to come here tonight, Malfoy. If you hate associating with us that badly, you're welcome to leave. We won't force you to talk to us if you're obviously uncomfortable with this whole thing." She said softly.
" He pointed out with a gleeful chuckle.
"I agree." Blaise quipped, winking at Hannah and pointing to her with his fork. "Being 'sexy' is in the way a girl sees herself. It has nothing to do with looks. I've dated plenty of girls who were bloody gorgeous but were about as sexy as a rock."
"Here, Potter. Go and get changed."
"Don't mind him so much, Potter." He cajoled lightly, ignoring the way Draco was glaring at the back of his head. "To be completely honest, I don't even think this is about you. Malfoy's just not in the best of moods right now because he spent all morning looking for this
Morag still looked a bit annoyed with the idea of having to do introductions but she obliged and gave them all a curt nod. "Call me Morag. In my spare time, I like to read and do research – mostly books on alchemy. To be honest, I haven't actually decided what I want to do after I graduate – maybe I'll just pursue further studies or become an arithmancer." She shrugged.
"Point taken, Malfoy."
"How about you, Drac? Are you going drinking with us?" He asked.
As soon as he registered her words, Draco snapped his head up and followed her gaze, staring in surprise at the sight of George Weasley leading Angelina Johnson around the dance floor. When George smiled at Angelina and pulled her close, gently twirling her around, Draco finally saw Angelina's unmistakable baby bump through her gown, and he felt like an idiot.
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry into something that personal." Aria said quietly, drawing his attention to the guilty look on her face.
And he
against all who had
"My veela."
"But I don't
Aria didn't even blink, her fingers tightening slowly around her arms.
Draco's pupils dilated at her words, and his gaze darkened, roaming hungrily up and down her barely clothed form. Though, when Draco looked up again, Aria was surprised to see a slight bit of hesitation that continued to linger on his face.
"What are you thinking about?" She reached up to brush his blond hair away from his eyes.
"I love you too."
"Malfoy." Ron's eyes flashed and he grew impatient as he sighed and gave Draco a pointed glare. "Look, I've got her. You can let go of her now, I'll take her to the hospital wing—"
When he finished levitating a few of the mushrooms into his basket, Draco stood up and began making his way back towards her. He paused mid-step when he noticed that Aria had gone unnaturally still. She was standing a few meters ahead of him, her slender form dwarfed by the large tree behind her. What bothered Draco, however, was the strange expression on her face.
you were the git who was particularly vocal about how much you disliked being taught by a girl." She retorted, causing the other Slytherin to visibly flinch at the memory.
"Veelas are all
end up collecting some valuable notes from you and Aria having sex. All that tension and bitter rivalry would certainly add something entirely new to the equation. But then, I'd need more data points to be able to make any relevant conclusions." Morag was mostly talking to herself at this point but she paused and turned to give Pansy a questioning look. "Maybe you should also have sex with Neville so I could get more information on the subject? You two exhibit nearly the same kind of unresolved sexual tension as Draco and Aria after all."
" She admitted, blushing.
The rest of Skeeter's haughty remark ended up as a horrified shriek when both her quill and notebook suddenly burst into big green flames, instantly causing her to yank her purse away and fling it to the floor. With angry, heaving breaths, Skeeter looked up — only to flush even darker when she saw the self-satisfied smirk on Aria's face.
"You don't mind do you, Luna?" He asked worriedly.
Not surprisingly, the faculty wanted another round of questioning for all Slytherins, regardless of year level. This time, the consequences were more severe as the offense committed involved a case of assault. As Pansy explained, they found one of Gryffindor's prefects passed out cold in the Gryffindor Common Room. When they asked him what happened, he claims he couldn't remember anything other than being in a weird trance before he lost consciousness.
Aria didn't laugh at Hannah's quip, nor was she smiling as she felt another unsettling, prickling sensation at the back of her neck. Slowly, she looked up, instantly meeting Bentley's wide, gleaming blue eyes from across the hall.
Instead, he bit his lip and silently urged her to wrap her legs around his waist. Aria obliged, and when their position was secure, Draco slid his hands underneath her ass and stood up while carrying her, moving them carefully to the bed. He laid her down gently onto the middle of the soft mattress, pinning her beneath his weight. They kissed again, and Aria slid her hands up his taut back and wrapped her arms around his neck. She arched wantonly against him, desperate to feel more of his hands on her.
"And it's not like I said it to be rude! I just didn't want the git to lose us any more house points! Did you know that he lost us
. Those were the exact same words Aria, disguised as her veela self, had first spoken to him when they met each other in Hogsmeade that night.
" Hermione corrected him as she closed her book with an exasperated sigh. "If it bothers you that much, you're welcome to join us. We'll be in the library the entire morning."
"That's your own fault." Aria glanced at him and rolled her eyes. "You knew we'd be working outside the castle today, you should have worn more casual shoes." She pointed out.
At this point, Greg's eyes had already narrowed and he was glaring so heatedly at Draco that he decided to change the subject before he suffered a particularly painful black eye.
He was just about to fly over to Professor Slughorn to get his advice when Aria suddenly grabbed his uninjured arm. Draco glanced at her over his shoulder.
"You know what? Go ahead, Potter. Keep the damn thing for all I care. And while you're at it, why don't you take the whole bloody common room for yourself too?!" He yelled loudly.
Fortunately, her teammate didn't seem to have noticed what happened and Aria was able to let out a sigh of relief as she headed towards the far end of the quidditch pitch, completely oblivious to the amused look Blaise was giving her from where he hovered near the keeper's post.
"As a chaser, I mean." Aria added, chuckling when Draco's eyes narrowed at the teasing tone of her voice. "Although you weren't so bad as team captain, either. In fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you actually knew what you were doing."
"What happened?" He asked calmly.
He frowned at his mother in confusion.
After a few minutes of this, Aria couldn't help but notice the awkward way Draco seemed to be moving his left arm. It was only when he shifted, and she caught a very quick glimpse of the ugly snake and skull tattoo on his forearm that she realized he was discreetly trying to hide his Dark Mark from her.
Draco swallowed again and he realized that his throat felt incredibly
"When are you going to tell him the truth?" He asked quietly.
Aria smirked to herself but didn't answer, careful not to look at the other girl as she took the other mop and made her way to the other end of the classroom.
He was broken out of his thoughts when Lewis clapped him lightly on the shoulder and grinned at him.
"Quidditch is bloody
questions. Are you practicing being a bloody auror already?" He sneered at the confounded look on her face.
"Oh...Okay, then." Draco swallowed and allowed his shoulders to sag with relief. "I'm sorry; I don't mean to be so anxious about all this. It's just...I really want to surprise her and I want everything to be
like the astronomy tower."
"This is one of the last few remaining heirlooms of the Black family. It once belonged to your great great Aunt Dorea, actually, but she decided to let it pass on to another Black lady instead of keeping it with her when she got married. We actually thought it got lost during the war — but Andy and I discovered that it was stashed away in your Aunt Bellatrix's vault. She must have stolen it for herself somehow." Narcissa sneered at the thought and shook her head.
actually." Greg answered, shaking his head. "At least, not until Harriah Potter actually agreed to be my date." He added, giving her a wry smile.
"So all that drinking from a vampire's wrist bit isn't true?" Finnigan asked, looking a little disappointed.
! Oh gods, I shouldn't have let that bastard hurt you, I'm so sor—"
He ran his fingers up and down her legs, fondling them gently before he leaned in and flicked his tongue upwards against her clit.
Astoria all had to look away, their shoulders shaking in an obvious attempt not to laugh. She shrugged, returning Skeeter's accusing glare with an overly sweet, innocent smile.
"Are we talking virgin, as in the
"Do you have a crush on Potter?" Draco asked bluntly.
Instead of answering, Aria summoned her wand from its holster.
"I just—"
Corey snickered at the look on Draco's face but thankfully, he didn't push the issue any further until the two Slytherins reached the common room entrance. As soon as they entered and caught sight of Blaise and Pansy sitting together in one of the couches near the fireplace, Corey winced and hastily excused himself from Draco, almost running up the stairs to the boys' dormitory in panic before Pansy's hawk-like eyes could zero in on him.
After Aria introduced herself; finished detailing the events that happened during the Hogwarts Yule Ball;
"Okay seriously, who's having sex with who now?" Zach asked out loud again, scratching his head.
She bit her lip and seemed to hesitate at first, but Draco waited patiently until she sighed and nodded, unfolding her wings and allowing them to stretch back out behind her. His eyes were soft as he stared shamelessly at them, admiring the pristine white feathers.
the Gryffindor Chasers between them. The two huge Slytherin Beaters slammed into the Gryffindors from both sides, trying to make them swerve off course and crash into the bleachers or the goal posts. Unfortunately, it only worked once – in the case of Megan Jones, but only because she was a tiny little girl who probably hadn't seen it coming.
So maybe it
As soon as she reached him and he found himself staring at her up close, Draco had to remind himself,
"Don't joke about things like that, Aria—"
until Aria realized that she could no longer hear her own thoughts.
"Would you prefer it if I called you Ferret?" Ron snorted.
He didn't wait for her to answer as he immediately began pounding into her, shoving his hips against hers with enough force to make the entire bed jerk forward and the headboard bang noisily against the wall.
"Aw, I love you too." Ron grinned impishly at her, causing Aria to roll her eyes again.
Draco
Ilyana just smiled dotingly at him. "Miss Granger can stay, obviously, as she is still bedridden. But the rest of you, yes, if you please."
"Y—you're not staying for breakfast?" Pansy finally managed to stutter out, wincing when she heard the squeakiness of her own voice.
She shouted.
hurry back." He warned, giving them a wide, saccharine smile that betrayed the chilly look in his eyes. "You wouldn't want McGonagall hearing all about how you almost attacked the savior of the wizarding world, would you? Maybe I should dock off points for that too. You
" Pansy asked again, looking confused.
are tiny, invisible female fairies that are always attracted to the most handsome, desirable male in the room and liked to drain his magical energy. Now, mind you, she said this to me with a completely straight face, without blushing or giggling." Blaise chuckled softly to himself, shaking his head at the memory. "The girl was just so…forward and direct and..unrepentantly
And for the first time since Sirius died, since the war happened and she lost so many of the people she loved and cared about, Aria felt the walls she had so carefully built around her heart slowly begin crumbling down, every little piece breaking away bit by bit, until her eyes began to sting and those three, little words finally found their way to her lips.
"If we're going to talk about being ridiculous—" Pansy pursed her lips, crossing her arms over her chest. "—then I'm obliged to call attention to your
"Pretty good, actually." Ron answered, giving her a grin. "We have a really good line-up this year. Ginny's spectacular of course. I mean, she's been training all summer so no surprise there. And the new Chasers who joined aren't bad either. Demelza Robbins is
She pulled her wings back, hoping to fly away but before she could even move, Bentley was already behind her. And without any warning, he raised his wand and, using a severing charm, slashed it down against her right wing.
She took out her own wand and cast a drying spell on their baskets before levitating them both under the invisible umbrella Draco had cast over their heads. Afterwards, she bent down, picking her discarded glasses off the ground. When she saw how dirty they had become, she shot him an irritated glare, only for Draco to answer her with a nonchalant shrug.
"I never said I'd actually do it." She answered evenly, pulling out a pair of mops, a few cleaning rags, and several other cleaning supplies from the cupboard. "I just told him I
Draco smiled to himself.
"Nah, it's fine. Like I said, it's common knowledge by now." He told her, shaking his head before turning to give her a strange smile. "You know what's weird though? As her son, I really admire her for it – not conforming to what society expects of her, I mean. She chooses to live without a mate. Did you know that she cut off her own wings?"
"Malfoy, what the
Draco cursed again, breaking their kiss so he could bury his face into her neck, kissing, licking and nipping at her soft skin.
at least was friendly. He oriented me about a lot of the house rules. Malfoy was mostly quiet and kept to himself the whole night. To be honest, it was actually Smith who was a little bit of a prick about the whole resorting thing."
She leaned up on her toes and
"She's not my type." Draco scoffed at the thought and rolled his eyes.
As soon as he reached the common room, he ignored the group of fourth year girls who giggled when they saw him and sat down onto his favorite armchair in front of the fireplace. He knew he should probably be making his way to the Hufflepuff Common Room to pick up Astoria; but he couldn't help linger for a couple more minutes, desperate for a quick glimpse of Aria before he left.
"Do we have a problem, good sir?" Draco asked him a calm drawl.
"May I...Please?"
make you her mate, did she not?" She asked.
" Aria flushed in embarrassment and scowled at him, slapping his hand away from her face. "What the hell do you think you're doing anyway?" She snapped, rubbing the back of her head.
" Hannah pursed her lips into a sneer and shook her head at him in dismay. "That is such a typically chauvinistic male answer, Zach! Is that really the only advice you're going to give me?" She complained.
Pansy hesitated, but Draco could tell from the way her expression had softened that she was beginning to relent.
"Is everything okay?"
"Well…
His hands were still desperately kneading her breasts when he grunted and thrust into her one last time before he came, closing his eyes and muffling his loud, gasping moan into the skin of her neck. He bit down onto her shoulder again, his hips still twitching and spasming violently as he emptied himself completely inside her.
"Seriously?" Draco sputtered as he reluctantly took the basket from Hagrid, holding it away from him as though it was the most disgusting thing he had ever held in his life. "We're supposed to go into the Forbidden Forest?! Is this a chore you regularly assign to
Draco looked up, scowling even more when he noticed that Aria had sat down into the seat beside him and was giving him a lazy, half-grin.
"Potter, I'm your
Her veela blood was boiling hot under her skin, drugging her mind and overwhelming her senses with so much need and lust, that all she could even think about was how much she just wanted Draco to fuck her senseless until she broke in half.
I'm human, there's nothing strange about me. What kind of question is that?" Aria looked strangely defensive.
As their tongues prodded and swirled lazily together, the silk gray sheets that Aria had wrapped around herself slowly began to slip away, sliding sensually over her naked body all the way down to the floor. Her wings poked out from her back and flared out behind her, fluttering softly in the silent room.
In my head, Draco and Aria get married, have two beautiful children (Scorpius and Lily — and yes, Lily eventually manifests as a veela lol) and they live happily ever after. But feel free to imagine their happy ending however you want. Btw, I'm sorry if I wasn't able to include Aria's POV in the Epilogue, but for some reason, everything just seemed to flow much better from Draco's.
"Lose the attitude, Potter. You're injured." Draco snapped back at her, barely able to keep himself from hissing out the words 'Your wing is broken' in his agitation.
A few minutes later, as she exited and returned to the corridor, she found a smug looking Draco waiting for her from where he was leaning against the wall beside the bathroom doors. His arms were crossed over his chest and he had one foot propped up backwards against the wall in such a pretentious pose that Aria actually considered hexing the handsome prat.
He sneered, hurling the box of chocolates to the floor and stomping on it a couple of times for good measure. When he noticed the way Neville arched an eyebrow at him, Draco's eyes narrowed and he shot the other Slytherin a warning glare.
She heard a lot of the frantic, whispered reactions from some of the other students as they passed.
"Don't tell me you're actually
Draco breathed a sigh of relief as he quickly shoved the small box securely into the inner pockets of his coat. As his fingers wrapped around the box, he felt his stomach flip-flop a few times; and he swallowed nervously, forcing himself to shove the feeling aside.
That infuriating, completely deadpan expression on Morag's face was back as she simply arched her eyebrow higher, watching him with a smug, knowing look.
"Seriously?" Neville let out another weary sigh. This time, however, it was intermingled with an exasperated laugh as he stepped forward and brought both of his hands down onto Pansy's shoulders, jostling her gently. "Are you
Pansy's cheeks flushed and she glared back haughtily at him with an affronted look on her face. Before she could retort, however, Aria rolled her eyes and held a hand up to silence her, leveling her with a warning look over her shoulder.
kind of witch? She won't be forcing me into an arranged marriage with anyone. She never cared about blood purity anyway, especially when it came to choosing a husband for herself. All that mattered to her was that the bloke was filthy rich." Blaise snorted derisively and rolled his eyes.
"Your name is written in every single history book now, after all. You're practically a top-tier celebrity. So how does it feel? Having reporters from the Daily Prophet track you down, requesting exclusive interviews all the time. I read in some tabloid somewhere that you even received marriage proposals from at least
As Fleur fell silent and contemplated Morag's question, Draco looked up and inadvertently locked gazes with Aria across the classroom.
He was so going to make that blasted veela regret not telling him about all this sooner.
When she didn't reciprocate and simply stared back blankly at him, Blaise relented and offered her a sheepish smile. "Alright, I know it sounds horribly overdone and tacky but I just figured that since we'll all be spending an entire year together, now's the best time to get to know all of you – maybe make some useful connections in the future if I'm lucky." He added.
2. I apologise if I offended anyone with that plastic surgery or 'perfected flaws' discussion, I didn't mean anything bad by it, it's purely for entertainment purposes of this story. ;)
"No, Pansy. I did
"Um—"
"Is there a problem, Smith?" He asked.
"Is that—"
Aria arched an eyebrow and pretended to give him a dubious look.
"Aria, stop it!" Draco began coughing.
"Yes, we did it! We didn't fuck up!" Aria exclaimed, barely resisting the urge to jump up and down as she turned to Greg and rewarded him with a grin and high five – which surprisingly enough, the Gryffindor accepted with a matching grin of his own. "We make a pretty good team after all, don't we?" She teased.
are you doing?! Why did you—"
age is willing to put with you. Malfoy obviously didn't, and I heard that even Corner dumped you back in sixth year. Not like I blame him, you certainly don't have any redeeming qualities anyway! Why would
She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, desperately stalling for time until she could work up the courage to tell him exactly what she wanted to say. After a long moment of awkward silence, Draco sighed and shoved his hands into the pockets of his cloak.
She had been so busy that week because of NEWTs and Quidditch that she didn't exactly have the time to properly think about how she felt about Draco; or about why she still couldn't seem to answer his simple question about her trusting him, even now.
"You didn't tell me that he was the Captain."
For once, Aria couldn't really blame Pansy for her comment.
of what would happen — that something horrible would take all this way from her
"No, she isn't." Draco countered fiercely, sneering to himself and shaking his head. "There are plenty of other veelas who were able to marry other men. Aria certainly doesn't have to 'settle' for me. I mean, look at
The news of a Yule Ball at the end of their holiday break was definitely a jarring surprise.
She reacted instinctively by ducking down behind the couch, keeping her head low enough so that they wouldn't notice her there.
"Well, off the top of my head, some vampires may gain the ability of flight, some may acquire the skill of hypnotism or mind compulsion — though this is
Aria's eyes widened in outrage at his admission.
Draco ignored the nonplussed expression on Aria's face and tossed the set of robes at her, watching as she caught it easily in one hand and held it up to her face.
"Better than spending all day yapping and being a
"So...You and Neville are really getting serious, aren't you?" She asked.
should know of it."
her — but Aria forced herself to ignore it and shoved him firmly onto his back, kneeling between his legs. She didn't give him any time to react before she reached out and grabbed his erection, guiding it to her lips and sucking softly around the tip.
"What the—Malfoy!" Aria's eyes narrowed and she felt blood rushing into her cheeks when she opened the robes and saw the words 'Malfoy' and 'Seeker' printed boldly in big, white letters on the back.
"It's the motto of Slytherin house."
"We arranged a graduation party for the 8th and 7th years today." He beamed.
"What are you both talking about?" Draco flicked his gaze back and forth between the two women, but when neither of them answered him, he sighed and turned his attention to Teddy instead. "Do you know what's going on, Ted?" He asked.
Aria slapped his hands away and glared impatiently at him. "Where's Hermione? What happened?!" She demanded.
She swatted his hand off her leg, rolling her eyes when Draco let out a high-pitched whine in complaint.
"Are you sure?" Aria asked again, giving Hannah a calm, ascertaining look.
"I can help escort Hannah back to the dorms." Morag offered, looking up from her half-empty glass of chocolate milk."Unlike the rest of you, I only drank one glass of wine so I pretty much still have my wits and coordination with me." She mused.
She stole a quick glance at Hannah beside her, noting the way the former Hufflepuff had blanched at Draco's reaction and was now looking completely mortified as she pretended to busy herself with looking through her bag. Aria also noticed how Blaise and Pansy exchanged wary looks with each other, shaking their heads before they both turned back to their readings.
As he straightened, Draco had to fight the urge to blush when he saw up close how good she looked in his quidditch uniform – even if she did shrink the robes to fit her smaller frame. The dark green color of Slytherin house complimented her pale, creamy skin
He flinched again, raking both of his hands through his hair. "I told you, it wasn't like that! Yes, I made a mistake! I wrote down your veela name but I never intended to use it against you! At the time, I just wanted to know what the fuck you were hiding from me!"
And so the next morning, every Gryffindor who came down to breakfast had shiny white hair, black teeth, and looked like they were suffering from a bad case of the chicken pox —only the spots on their face were silver while the rest of their skin was dark green.
"I was trying to make you see the truth!"
; and Aria wasn't even talking about her veela self anymore.
"They
"Don't you dare drag me into this, Longbottom." Draco cut in sharply but Neville deliberately went on as though he hadn't heard him.
"No, it's okay." Greg rushed out, giving her a reassuring smile. "I know it's not your fault. It's just that...I never realized that heels were pretty dangerous." He admitted, chuckling.
Draco flinched; and his mind scrambled to keep up with her.
defense, I didn't ask to be put into Slytherin. I was just as blindsided about this whole thing as you were."
"So, pray tell, how can I be sure that you trying to convince me to make up with Aria isn't just a manipulative, clever ploy of yours to get those 'lovely veela grandchildren' you just mentioned?"
When Draco and Blaise continued to glare suspiciously at her, she rolled her eyes at them and gestured to their fallen housemates.
She gave him a dubious look. "Are you actually offering to accompany me?"
Narcissa's beaming smile slowly melted away at his words. Her shoulders slumped as she sighed and stared at him, studying his expression in concern.
"And so you asked her out."
"I'm surprised Slytherin doesn't do something similar." Aria mused as she reached over and helped herself to a generous serving of freshly brewed coffee. "And speaking of Slytherins, are you all always this
Pansy was silent as she walked right up to her, studying the other girl up close with a knowing gleam in her eyes.
Lips that were so sinfully sweet, and addictive, and just so achingly
More than a couple of minutes went by; and Aria was so lost in her own thoughts that it took her awhile to notice that someone had sat down into the seat beside her. She didn't have to look up to know who it was, however, because the touch of his hand on her leg and the warm press of his lips against her nape was enough for her to know that it was Draco.
When Aria rewarded him with a curious look, Smith surprised her when he leaned across the table to offer her his hand.
"Why would
" Firenze clarified as his gaze flicked back to Aria, oblivious to the way Draco blanched and seemed to shrink at his words. "I remember seeing him among their ranks. He was a supporter of the Dark One."
man want you?" He snapped.
"Pretty Gryffindor boys—who—?"
when he wants to be." She muttered darkly, glaring at the smirking Slytherin beside her.
To her dismay, Draco ignored her and leaned down to nuzzle her chest.
"Maybe around seven?" Aria shrugged at him and waved his concerns away. "But don't worry if you're a little late or anything, it's fine. Oh and my gown is dark green, by the way, in case you were planning to match it with your dress robes." She added as an afterthought.
"No, that's okay. We don't want to impose—"
"Fuck you, Zabini."
"That makes sense." Ron muttered under his breath.
"That wasn't—I mean, it's not like that—" Aria instantly stiffened, her jaw clenching with irritation as she shook her head and tried to change the topic of conversation. "Anyway, we should finish unpacking so we can turn in for the night—"
"I gather things didn't go so well, huh?"
A few minutes later, after everyone finally settled down, Aria straightened in her seat and began to speak.
playing professional quidditch?"
"That is—we—" Draco grimaced and frantically shook his head.
"No, that won't work. He's already's going with Demelza Robbins." Hannah answered dejectedly, looking away to hide the miserable tilt to her lips.
"What can I say? She went up to me in the Great Hall a few days ago and asked me if all the
to happen." Pansy suddenly scoffed loudly, reminding them of her presence as she looked up from her book and smirked at them from where she sat on her bed across the room. "Please don't have too many kids though, Weasley. You wouldn't want to end up in the same financial situation as your parents—"
"In the meantime—" Neville ignored her half-hearted protests and grinned, taking one of her hands in his. He lifted it up to his mouth and placed a kiss onto the back of her palm. "Will you go to the Yule Ball with me?"
didn't he?" Ron pointed out, smirking.
"How many more ingredients are left?" Aria sounded tired as she looked up from where she was arranging some Dittany herbs on her basket.
She eventually nodded and slipped her hand through his.
As soon as the class ended and they were dismissed for lunch, Draco sighed, gathered his things and stood up, following the rest of his housemates back to the Great Hall. When he caught sight of Blaise and Pansy halfway down the corridor and began to hear snippets of their conversation, he frowned and began walking faster to catch up to them.
"I'm sorry!" Draco's eyes widened at her reaction and he immediately looked contrite as he jumped to his feet, moving away from her. "I didn't mean to touch you like that, I shouldn't have assumed—"
"Well, I
"And just like he may have wanted people to suspect
"It's
"Correct him?" She echoed.
It didn't take them long before they reached the small, cozy cafe that Draco had chosen for their evening together (he actually contacted the café in advance to make sure everything went smoothly). As soon as they stepped inside and removed their heavy coats, one of the cafe's servers led them to a private, well-lit alcove. Draco held her chair back for her, waiting patiently until she sat down before he settled himself into the seat on the opposite side of the table.
The knowing tone in Aria's voice caused Pansy to grimace and look away.
"Well, you saved my life
"Zach, you were supposed to say something about
Aria these days? She's been so busy lately that I haven't had the chance to catch up with her."
Wincing, she forced her eyes open and found herself staring up at a white ceiling. As her eyes adjusted to the light, she eventually recognized the cream colored walls of the hospital wing. She raised herself up into a sitting position, only to wince again as another sharp pain below her shoulder alerted her to the fact that one of her wings, her right wing in particular, was heavily bandaged. When she turned her head to look at it, she saw that both her wings, as well as several other sore parts of her body, were glowing from the effects of a healing stasis charm.
She stopped when Blaise nearly fell backwards in his chair from wheezing too hard in between his laughter. Beside him, Draco just cursed under his breath and shook his head, glaring at the other boy with an irritated look on his face.
"I agree with Blaise. When
"Just so you know, I didn't mean anything by what I said so don't misunderstand me. I
To his credit, Malfoy looked just as uncomfortable with her proximity as Aria felt, no doubt also thinking about how the last time they had spoken to each other was during their embarrassing little screaming match in the Common Room last night. From the way their housemates were staring at them, it was obvious they were all probably thinking the same thing. Hannah, in particular, was flicking her gaze back and forth between the two formal rivals in fear, almost as though she was expecting that either one of them would suddenly jump up and start hexing the other without any warning.
"Okay,
Draco immediately shook the expression away and smiled at her. He placed his hand on top of hers, giving her fingers a reassuring squeeze.
She felt the familiar, albeit brief, stinging sensation of something poking out from under her shoulder blades before her full wings suddenly spread open, stretching and flapping impatiently in the enclosed space. As soon as her body finished the magical transformation, her vision blurred and Aria scowled as she reached up and removed her thick-framed glasses from her face.
is wrong with one-on-one heterosexual sex between me and Potter?!" He demanded.
"You're welcome
Draco laughed bitterly at her words. "I doubt the rest of the wizarding world sees it that way."
Draco's eyes narrowed at him in growing impatience.
Aria considered her question for a few seconds; but she eventually let out a resigned sigh and slowly shook her head.
Draco made his way over to the refreshment table at the end of the room. He heard a loud thud from somewhere behind him, followed by a chorus of loud, boisterous laughter. When he turned around, he saw Zach drinking with a group of Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws a few meters away from the entrance. Draco noticed that amongst their group, Zach was obviously the only one who wasn't drunk (though not for lack of drinking, if the nearly empty bottle of firewhiskey in his hand was any indication). Zach's friends, on the other hand, looked just about ready to throw up — and Justin Finch-Fletchley was already passed out on the floor.
"You're saying
A blinding flash of magic shot out from behind her, and Bentley was thrown backwards again; only this time, he let out an angry yelp of pain as he crashed to the floor a few feet away. Aria looked up to find a frantic Draco kneeling over her, his face turning white when he saw her partially severed wing.
"Why would this person even bother trying to disguise himself as Draco anyway? And why only
boy who had dared ask her to the Yule Ball (a light-haired 7th year from Gryffindor who had barely opened his mouth before Aria immediately shut him down with a flat intonation of "Walk away, McLaggen."), Morag finally made it clear that she had enough.
By the end of the day, after Draco finished saying goodbye to all of his patients and he hung up his St. Mungo's uniform for the last time, he was a little embarrassed to admit to himself that he got a little teary-eyed too, especially when Estelle, Lewis, and the rest of his supervisors surprised him with a cake and a small goodbye celebration after his shift. It was late afternoon by the time the celebration ended, and after everyone wished him luck and Draco finished thanking all of them for their time and patience, he finally signed the official release papers Estelle handed him and slowly made his way to the elevator that would take him down to the main lobby of St. Mungo's.
from graduating as much as possible." Blaise added.
Draco smiled at her words and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her closer. He took one of her hands in his and placed a kiss onto her palm before slowly intertwining their fingers together.
Ignoring the curious looks he received from the others, he went upstairs and changed quickly out of his school robes, throwing on his winter clothes and a long, gray coat. He was already hurrying his way out of the common room to chase after Aria when he suddenly heard a chorus of wolf whistles behind him, followed by Blaise hollering after him in an obnoxiously loud voice that echoed around the entire common room.
Raking a hand through his sweaty blond hair in frustration, Draco let out an exasperated sigh and sank down onto the opposite bench. He shook his head and watched as Zach slumped down lower into his seat and groaned, covering his face with his hands.
When she manifested as a veela that year, she had taken it upon herself to read countless books about what she was, and in nearly all of those books (though the people involved may change throughout the years) she encountered the same tragic story over and over again. There would always be a young, unmated veela. She'd fall in love and eventually decide to extend the famous veela mate-bond to her chosen lover, only to be so heartbroken by his rejection that she'd eventually end up killing herself or cutting off her own wings.
Draco blinked at her and looked away with a spiteful expression. "I suppose we'll see what the great Harriah Potter really believes tomorrow then, won't we?" He muttered bitterly to himself.
And the thought unsettled and
"I can certainly
"Aye, that's not a problem." Hagrid gave her a reassuring smile and walked over to a small shed near the back of his hut. When he returned a few minutes later, he handed both Aria and Draco a large, wooden basket each, along with a small piece of parchment.
go about seducing Ernie if you were in my position right now?" She pressed again, completely relentless.
"Aria." She paused in the middle of reaching for a valerian root and looked up at him, meeting his slightly surprised look with a small smile.
Trigger Warning: This chapter mentions a minor, non-explicit case of sexual harassment. It’s very brief and doesn’t affect the tone of the story but still, please be advised.
By the time the two Slytherins had finished handing their basket of ingredients to Hagrid, it was almost evening.
"Would you like me to sweep you off your feet and carry you?"
bit apologetic over his dirty tactic. He turned around slowly to face her, noting the way Aria's face had gone unnaturally pale and that she was staring at him with wide green eyes.
"It might interest you to know that Goyle is actually very pleasant to talk to. He's sweet, polite, and also quite the gentleman according to Ginny. He offers to carry the bags of all the girls in their year when they move from classroom to classroom." Hermione told them, causing Ron to give her an incredulous glare.
It proved to be a mistake, however, as tugging on the lock of hair had accidentally caused the clasp to come lose, freeing a small portion of her thick hair from her clasp. She
"How do you feel about, Draco?" He blurted out.
"Thank you, Luna." Aria answered, smiling slightly when she noticed Luna's new robes.
not the one sharing a dorm with Pansy Parkinson, remember?" She pointed out.
"Shut up."
"Yes." She answered, placing her hands on top of the arm he had wrapped around her waist and caressing his skin. "I actually manifested a few days before you met me in that pub."
Draco tore his eyes away from the dancing couple and glared irritably at Aria.
, no one knows what became of her and her body has not been found until this day." Fleur told them grimly, shaking her head.
Draco decided to make up for the wasted opportunity the following morning.
When he didn't, Aria reluctantly withdrew her gaze and looked away with a weary sigh.
"We don't know where Aria went." Blaise answered uneasily beside him, and Draco noticed for the first time that Blaise had several cuts on his face and that his left eye was bruised. "All we know is that she's hiding and Fisher ran off to look for her."
the way all the blokes in the room can't seem to stop staring at you. I mean, I did just tell you about my mother after all, I recognized all the signs. It wasn't hard to put it all together."
Draco was silent as they rounded a corner and carefully began making their way to the west wing of the castle.
She didn't turn around to look at him as Draco would have wanted her to, but she

She moved to step around him but just as the heel of her boots touched the icy stone stairs, she
There was a loud clink as Draco carelessly dropped the cup of coffee in his hand onto a nearby table before he stood up, walking over to Hannah with a dark look on his face.
"Corey, I want you to be honest with me." Aria began slowly, and the seriousness of her tone caused Blaise and Pansy to stop in the middle of the hallway and turn around to watch them. "What's the last thing you remember? Is there anyone you remember speaking to before you blacked out?" She asked in a hushed voice.
Pansy paused in the middle of her angry tirade and snorted, shooting a mocking sneer over at where Aria had visibly stiffened in her seat.
"Yeah, I know. You two forget about everyone else the minute the other walks into the room." Hannah giggled at their sheepish expressions before she shook her head and began to head back towards the elevators. "Anyway, my break's almost over so I'm going to head back. Expect to receive the wedding invitations sometime this month, okay? I'll have Pansy owl them to you." She called out to them over her shoulder.
"The second negative symptom is called the
"Sorry that took so long." Aria accepted the glass of wine he offered and took a small sip. She glanced back up at everyone else afterwards and met their curious looks with a small grin. "What did I miss?"
When Burt couldn't seem to find his voice to answer, Draco slowly reached into his pocket and pulled out his wand, finally causing Burt to snap out of his stupor and let out a nervous laugh. He raked a trembling finger through his hair and began to back away from them.
Not only will my father
happy to see me?" She bent down and kissed him, tracing his parted lips with her tongue. "Would you like me to take care of that for you?"
"How did you learn about your veela name?" He leaned down and followed the path his fingers had made on her skin with his lips.
As they were making their way around the perimeter of Russel Square, Draco stopped underneath a large tree and gently pulled his hand away from hers.
Draco ignored her impassive reaction and went on.
They made the trip to the hospital wing in tense silence. When they reached the doors, Draco was just about to make his way to the private wards when Ron stopped him. He shook his head and pointed Draco towards Madam Pomfrey's office.
Aria let out a heavy sigh but nodded.
"But I
"Ugh. I feel like I'm going to be sick." He grumbled.
Hannah scowled at her, her shoulders slumping as she lowered both of the gowns she held back down onto her lap. "You don't have to be so mean about it." She sulked.
it, by the way. I miss the old, cocky you."
"From personal experience, that
"Now hold on a minute, Pans." Neville looked uncertain as he flicked his gaze back and forth between Aria and Pansy. "I think that's a little unfair; Aria has nothing to do with this incident. You can't just ask her to do something like that—"
To her annoyance, Ron's eyebrow only seemed to lift higher at her words.
me to correct him! It was obviously a misunderstanding!" She argued, glaring at him as though he was insane. "Don't pretend like the very idea of us being together is some sort of dream come true for you either, Malfoy. You were always very vocal about how much you despised me!" She pointed out.
"It is very important for you to understand this. On the veela's end, once she extends a mate-bond to someone, she has already chosen this person as her mate. So in other words, the mate-bond from her side is already there. This person she extended the mate-bond to has now become, for all intents and purposes, her mate. Consequently, she has basically rendered herself infertile to everyone else.
"It's not like those sods in high positions in the Ministry weren't guilty of associating with Voldemort themselves." Ron snorted.
Draco's hand shook as he reached out and cupped her face, using his thumb to gently brush her cheek.
"Juice?"
When he got there, he was a little confused to find Corey staring off blankly into space with a dazed look in his eyes. The books Draco had left beside him were still there, but he was a little miffed when he noticed that Corey had obviously been looking through some of them, judging by the way the small pile wasn't as neatly arranged as Draco had left it.
"Good afternoon, everyone."
Knowing full well that his question was directed at
"Can I touch them?" He asked softly.
Fleur seemed to consider something for a few seconds before she nodded and straightened in her seat.
think that something doesn't quite add up."
"Why does it matter anyway?! Who cares what anyone else thinks?!"
Undaunted, Draco was debating with himself whether it would be wise to try his luck by hiding behind the teacher's table so he could eavesdrop on their conversation when Pansy suddenly startled him by popping up out of nowhere and snatching his arm.
Astoria sniffed again and looked away. After a few seconds, she reluctantly glanced back at him and met his smug expression with a sullen glare.
"Greg, let's not—"
"Anyway, enough of that." Aria bit her lip and hastily decided to change the topic by standing up and pulling him to his feet. "I think I have some wine left in the kitchen. Do you want some?" She asked, giving him a disarming smile.
Draco ignored the sound of her amused snort and went on about his task, fully expecting her to walk back over to her books and leave him to his research. He was genuinely surprised when a few minutes later, she spoke again, nearly causing Draco to jump as he whirled around and glared at her in annoyance.
"And what exactly are you staring at, Malfoy?" Aria scoffed as she approached him, smiling when his hands automatically wrapped themselves around her waist.
"Vampirism is a genetic
"Don't forget. We still have to sign up for 6 units of those elective classes." He reminded her as they rounded a corner.
"Are you upset about the match? Because it doesn't matter if we lost, you know." Pansy ignored Blaise's antics as she brought her attention back to Draco, trying to console him. "That was just our first game against Gryffindor anyway, we're bound to get another rematch against them." She told him.
a small, brick fireplace situated in the back of the room and it gave the dungeon walls a nice, warm glow.
Aria broke her gaze away from his and leaned back against the stack of pillows behind her. She shrugged and turned her attention back to the untouched plate of food on her lap.
"Mother told me she was terrified that night." Draco lowered his hand to where Aria still had hers resting on the grass and, very gently, rested his palm against her fingers, using his thumb to caress the leather covering her knuckles. "Because she had to look right into the eyes of the Dark Lord and
Aria realized her mistake instantly and flushed, hastily tearing her gaze away.
"She's…doing okay, I suppose." Ron picked up on the underlying question in Aria's words easily and he sighed, following her gaze to stare quietly at his sister. "Mum and Dad think it's good that she has a distraction to keep her busy. It helps, you know. Somewhat." He glanced at Aria and gave her a small, tight smile.
Aria began to feel dizzy from all the physical stimulation.
The fact that he hadn't seen her in almost an entire week was beginning to piss him off.
Hermione and I will always be there anyway to support you or back you up. We may not get to see you everyday now like we used to but we're still your best friends, Aria. Nothing will change that." He reached out and gave her gloved hand a quick, reassuring squeeze.
to be complicated." Draco told her, shaking his head and trying to comfort her with a small smile. "To be honest, I don't even care if you're a veela or not. It doesn't matter to me."
She had
Aria, either pretending to be interested in their books or hastily writing something down into their parchments. Aria, on the other hand, continued to stare at Draco for a couple more minutes, obviously waiting for him to say something else.
Shaking his head, Draco walked out of the classroom and began heading towards the Great Hall.
When she got there and saw that Greg still busy packing away their things, she turned and was just about to start cleaning their work station when someone
There was a roguish, sideways grin on Aria's face as she stopped directly in front of Corey, hovering her broom a few feet above where he was sitting between Pansy and Neville. When Corey just blinked and stared up at her in confusion, Aria offered him a conspiratorial smile.
"Well it was the only comfy seat left when I arrived! Everywhere else was full when I got here! Where else am I supposed to take a nap?" Potter complained with a scowl.
"So how

quickly moving away before he could touch her. This time, the expression on Draco's face was far from calm or impassive as he finally exploded at her, whirling around and glaring furiously down at Aria with dangerously narrowed gray eyes.
a daily skincare routine." Aria pointed out, laughing.
He listened intently as she explained to them how, because of the ongoing reconstruction efforts of Hogwart's west wing – which had been badly damaged during the war – there was currently a shortage of available house elves to keep up the school's regular maintenance chores that year.
"And while we're at it, Headmistress, please tell the school board that I also want them to revoke the expulsion orders of the other Slytherins who were expelled for the previous vandalism incidents too. In fact, I want these incidents wiped from their academic records completely."
"You're starting to look a little purple there, Malfoy." He pointed out.
Draco couldn't force himself to watch anymore.
Draco sighed as he slipped on a pair of gloves and attached his nametag to the front of his robes.
"Don't just rat me out like that!" Draco snapped at him.
"How are you feeling?" He asked softly.
"Are you done?"
"Wait!" Draco called out to her again in panic when the train began to pull away from the platform. "You never answered my question! Can I see you again? And how do I even get in touch with you if I don't know your name—"
"Malfoy!" She hissed angrily.
"I didn't know how much of a creepy bloke he was when I let him join!" Ron countered, giving her an apologetic grimace. "How was I supposed to know that he's some kind of crazy, obsessed stalker? And besides, I was supposed to be fair in choosing who gets in! Equal opportunity and all that." He blurted out, causing Aria to roll her eyes. "Look, trust me. If he gives you any trouble during the match tomorrow, I'll throw his ass right off the team."
"Sure."
"...I see."
"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"I order you not to kill him!
As the days went by, Aria was relieved to see that Hermione seemed to have adjusted well to her vampirism. Admittedly, the brunette
Unlike Goyle, he hadn't seen Potter on the platform but he
Aria's expression shuttered and she used a powerful gust of veela magic to shove the other girl away from her.
"Hey, wait a minute." Neville frowned at them and shook his head. "Don't lump me in with the rest of them! I, for one, happen to appreciate it when a lady dresses herself up in a pretty gown and gets herself all dolled-up for a special occasion. You agree with me, right Malfoy?" He turned to Draco, trying to get him to participate in the conversation but Draco didn't even look up from his book.
realize that I'm not actually obligated to help you
Draco stood nervously in front of the entrance to Hogsmeade Station.
"I don't blame you for hiding." He drawled in such an off-handed, sarcastic voice that it made the girl glance reluctantly back at him in confusion. When her emerald orbs met his again, Draco arched an eyebrow at her and rewarded her with a plucky smirk. "With such a hideous, grotesque face like that, I'd probably want to hide away from everyone else too. It must be horrible walking the streets." He added casually.
Draco shook his head, re-focusing his attention on the long, deserted aisle of veela-related books in front of him.
Unfortunately, I have to cut the chapter here. I originally intended the next scene to be included in this update but this chapter was getting too long and would have been twice its normal length if I did lol.
"...I was hoping to work as a Junior Prosecutor for the Ministry. I actually already received a provisional job offer, but whether I actually get accepted is contingent on me passing the Bar Examinations first." He told them.
"Neville and Pansy were paired for chores this afternoon?"
"I don't know, okay?" Aria finally growled, sighing in defeat. "Look, I know Zabini and Parkinson already know and it didn't bother me as much but it's just – Malfoy and I were at each other's throats for years! If he finds out that I'm a veela and he somehow discovers that my veela blood sees him as a compatible mate, he might – well, I don't know what he'll think! He'll probably be disgusted and
Aria sighed and lowered her gaze to the ground, but not before Draco saw the genuine fear and uncertainty in her eyes.
"Um…S—sure—"
"Have it your way then."
I just meant that it was most likely that he did—"
If Draco had any doubts as to whether all the alcohol she drank was beginning to affect Aria or not, those doubts were gone the second she whirled around and ended up crashing clumsily into one of the nearby tables behind them, tipping a few of the chairs over.
"Of course you will." Pansy huffed again and turned away. "I'll tell Corey you'll meet him in that empty classroom on the third floor every Saturday morning—"
at that, and Draco felt his cheeks begin to flush at the way he could feel her soft, warm breaths against his pulse, causing the skin there to tingle pleasurably.
"Oh for Merlin's sake.
She eventually groaned in complaint and pressed her palms against his chest in a feeble attempt to push him away.
Slowly, he opened his eyes.
She also vaguely remembered participating in the Slytherin – Hufflepuff quidditch match they had a few days ago, and how they almost lost because Draco had refused to acknowledge her during the game, severely crippling their team's strategy.
She rolled her eyes.

The change suited her quite well, and even Draco had to admit that she looked pretty.

Aria rolled her eyes and glanced impatiently at the short-haired girl again, arching an eyebrow.
"Why?"
"Because it's Aria." Luna answered, looking up and meeting his doubtful gaze with another knowing smile. "All she's ever really wanted is to be happy with someone she loves and loves her back. And she obviously loves
"I know."
After Hogwarts, he was required to serve his two-year sentence of unpaid community service, but after that, he had absolutely no idea what he wanted to do with his life
Aria blinked, looking a little taken back by the question. Then, to Draco's surprise, Aria's green eyes dimmed slightly, and a small, sad smile began to form on her lips.
"I'm getting
"Shut up."
"Oh, you don't have to look so disgusted, Ronald. In fact,
"Sorry, Weasley. It's nothing personal or anything." Blaise spoke up before Aria could answer, crossing his arms over his chest. "But Potter's agreed to be our new seeker." He drawled smugly.
As everyone broke out into loud cheers and applause, a happily glowing Ron and Hermione slowly made their way over to the very center of the reception area. The lights around them dimmed, and the spotlight shifted to focus directly on the newly married couple, illuminating their slow, romantic waltz along the dance floor.
In his panic, he called out to her just as she reached the entrance to the station.
"Not that
As he made his way to the back of the library, Draco roused himself from his thoughts and headed towards the row of aisles where he remembered most of the research materials on veelas were kept. He cast a quick, amused glance at the crowded tables of 7th and 8th year students as he passed them, snickering when he saw the dark circles under their eyes.
and his eyes automatically fluttered shut. Out of their own accord, his arms wrapped themselves tightly around her waist and he pulled her closer, savoring the feel of the soft curves of her slender body pressed up against him.
"Because you spilled wine on your shirt? Why don't you just cast a drying charm?"
"Are you
"Why is it that you always manage to get yourself into these kinds of situations?"
"You wound me, Potter. Truly." Pansy let out an indignant huff and pretended to give her an affronted look. "Why would I ask you to humiliate yourself when I could obviously derive some other, more useful form of utility from you instead?" She pointed out.
"Nothing! I have no bloody idea why Pansy had your feather but
Before either Draco or Blaise could say anything else, her expression shuttered and she shot them both boys one last glare before she turned on her heel and stalked off towards the Great Hall.
"I think so." Hermione answered as she settled down into her seat with a grim expression on her face. "It turns out, the common room incident is similar to the first vandalism case after all. The ones responsible were a group of Slytherin first year students." She told them.
Maybe even more.
"What?"

" Pansy shook her head and shuddered, silencing the rest of Morag's words with a nauseated glare. "No more disgusting comments out of you. At least not until I've finished my breakfast."

just offer to help you get revenge you know." She pointed out, arching a perfectly plucked eyebrow at Hannah's startled expression. "If you don't want to send any of our boys after him, maybe I can teach you a nasty hex to use on him instead. I can guarantee that it's effective." She offered.
"What a

There was a long moment of awkward silence as most of the students shifted in their seats and stared blankly at each other. Finally, after a few minutes, Seamus Finnigan cleared his throat and hesitantly raised his hand.
"Just out of curiosity…" Her eyes narrowed slightly as she circled Aria a few times, her gaze roaming up and down the taller girl's form as though she was looking for something. "…What
She hesitated, biting her lower lip when it began to tremble.
"Trust me, if the attraction is there – physically, at least – you don't
The vindictiveness in his voice caused Aria to freeze mid-step. She tensed and turned around slowly, her green eyes wide as she gave him a perplexed look.
Corey looked shocked at Aria's statement while McGonagall just gave her a censorious look.

She ignored his grumbled protests and snatched his wrist again and Draco sighed, allowing himself to be dragged along.
"You need a haircut, darling.
The git was sporting an obnoxious smile on his face as he handed her the chore assignments for that evening, cheerfully pointing out that she would be cleaning classrooms in the fifth floor of the school's west wing with none other than Pansy Parkinson.
"You're adorable, Malfoy."

common room remains intact, I'm pretty certain the teachers are going to suspect us."
Draco couldn't resist clearing his throat again, much louder this time, so that both Wood and Aria were eventually forced to stop their conversation to look at him. When Draco's eyes narrowed and he scowled petulantly at Aria, she rolled her eyes at him and let out an exasperated sigh.
Draco was waiting for her when she got there, his nose wrinked slightly in disdain as he stared at all the Hippogriff feathers scattered around. They didn't have to wait long before the doors to Hagrid's Hut swung open and Hagrid himself came clambering out, his friendly, bearded face immediately warming into a smile at the sight of Aria standing there and waving at him.
"Why? Did I not seem broody and mysterious enough for you?" Blaise purred seductively at her, causing the pig-tailed girl's eyes to widen and her face to immediately flush in scandalized horror.
"You are aware, Miss Potter, that the vampire community is pushing for a lighter sentence? They were able to prove Mister Fisher's fixation on you, after all, and they insist that his actions that night were simply the result of his growing psychological obsession towards you. Are you not worried about drawing any resentment from them?" She pointed out.
"It's a vampire thing." Wood laughed at her flustered expression and waved her concern away. "But enough about that! What have you been up to these days? Do you still play quidditch?"
"Is this about you and Aria Potter?"
"Well hello there, beautiful."
Aria sighed at their shrill voices and turned her attention back to Greg, glancing briefly at something over his shoulder. Then, slowly, her lips curled upwards into another mischievous smirk.
She groaned at his nearness and tried to lean up higher on her toes to reach his mouth.
"Don't be late for class, you two. Don't want to lose points for Slytherin on your first day."
your sycophant of a father rot in Azkaban for the rest of your lives." She snapped.
"Well," Blaise paused in the middle of cleaning and frowned in thought. "I wouldn't say they hated each other, but they certainly didn't like each other either. I don't even think I ever saw them together. Pansy was an insufferable brat, always clinging onto Draco's arm because he was the most flashy, arrogant kid in the room. Meanwhile Neville was the quiet, strange boy who didn't like to play with the other children. He mostly just clung onto his grandmother's leg all the time."
"She caught us last night."
"After the Blood Thirst, the
"Veelas are remarkably fragile after all. Beautiful, yes, and quite powerful. But so incredibly
"Oh god!"
She stared at the strange scene, her eyes growing wide when she was met with the sight of Pansy standing stiffly by the doors leading up to the girls' dorms. Neville towered over her, one of his hands resting on the door behind her to keep it shut while his other hand was on the wall above her head, effectively caging her in.
"Hmm. How interesting. In that case, maybe I
Aria just blinked at him and spoke up in a flat voice.
It was then that Aria realized that the expression on Pansy's face was actually a mixture of
"Fuck!"
"If you don't know the answer to that, you should probably read up more about veelas then." Aria answered her in a deadpan voice, a grim smile tugging on her lips. "What I would actually '
Fighting the urge to roll his eyes, Draco slid his chair back and stood up sharply from his seat.
Somewhere, a couple of feet away, Aria vaguely heard a few familiar voices — Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, and even Blaise. All of them seemed to be shouting at her, telling her to fight back but she

be able to see her again.
The last thing Draco saw was Aria turning around and lifting her braid to show Fleur something on the back of her neck before the rest of his protests were cut off as Pansy grabbed his collar and yanked him violently out of the classroom.
Thankfully, the house-elves were more than accommodating when they got there and after conferring briefly with them on how they could help out, Aria set off to work with washing the piles of dirty dishes on the counters while Blaise situated himself on the other end of the room to dry and store the plates.
Narcissa gave him a curious look. "You mentioned in your last letter that your old hawthorn wand is suddenly working perfectly for you again, did you not?"

excuse to expel every single one of us given the chance. Well—"
"Is that so?" Draco stifled a smirk and obliged him with an amused grin instead. "Alright, I suppose you can tell me all about it on the way—hey! Watch where you're going, you filthy blighter!"
"I'm just stating the obvious, Parkinson." Aria rolled her eyes at the other girl before turning her attention back to the book on her lap.
Aria finally exploded as she slammed the window she had been cleaning shut and whirled around to glare at her. "You hate me –
"His spirit is that of a weaker energy, this one." Firenze told her, cutting off the rest of her response as he directed his attention to Draco's pale face again, giving him a painfully scrutinizing look. "His nature is selfish, and he is likely to cower in the face of adversity. He does not possess the kind of inner strength you have, Harriah Potter. You would be a very ill-suited match for each other, indeed." He added warningly.
Annoyed, Draco's eyes narrowed and he gave her a challenging glare.
The hateful accusation in his voice suddenly caused Aria to grit her teeth and freeze mid-step. She clenched her jaw and turned around slowly to face him, her hands curling up into tight, angry fists by her sides.
and not
"Eh. How
Aria could only nod silently in agreement, her features schooled into a blank mask as she processed everything Hannah had just said. She drowned out the rest of Draco and Neville's muted conversation as she sank back slowly into her seat and stared intently into the fire, wrapping Draco's blanket tighter around her shoulders.
"I know." Aria nodded in understanding and urged him to continue. "They're dating, right? He wrote to me a few days ago about it. I'm happy for him, you know. Angie's always been a good friend of his and she knows him
"Well, actually…That was only part of the reason." Pansy rifled through her purse for a few minutes, looking for something. Eventually, she pulled out a small, sealed envelope and held it up into the air, waving it a few times in front of Draco's face.
"Hey!" She protested, swatting them away.

Neville scoffed at that and shook his head.

The damage caused by the fiendfyre had been...
When Zach grimaced and shrugged again, Aria's eyes narrowed and both Draco and Neville
"Give me a break." Pansy rolled her eyes. "We weren't exactly the best of friends when this whole mess started. And my reasoning at the time was that it couldn't hurt to have a veela feather that would grant me one favor from the most powerful witch in our year. You can hardly blame a Slytherin for that."
Seeing the look on his friend's face, Blaise smirked widely and gave Morag a wink.
on human blood to survive, which of course, is certainly not the case."
Pansy! Leave him alone!" Hannah hissed out, causing Pansy to freeze and blink at her in angry disbelief.
"It's just that—"
"How I might have been the one to curse those poor kids into doing what they did, right?" Pansy snapped scathingly, her eyes flashing and an angry snarl forming on her face.
I forgive you."
"I remember exactly the kind of person you were even when we were children. I also remember exactly how you and the rest of your snotty little friends would make fun of kids like me behind my back, laughing at me and calling me an orphan because my parents were insane, calling me a squib because my magic showed up later than yours."
without any kind of special magic, charm or potion being involved.
As soon as the words flew out, Pansy let out a high-pitched, horrified gasp and slapped both of her hands over her mouth. Her cheeks colored and she glared viciously at Aria while Draco, Neville, and a few other students who had been standing near enough to hear her, suddenly burst out laughing.
"What's your problem?" She rolled her eyes and gave the blond an impassive glare of her own.
"Let me see." Draco ignored her halfhearted protests and poked gently around her back, trying to search for the source of the pain. When his hand brushed against a particularly
until finally, the need for air became much too urgent for either of them to ignore and they broke apart slowly, but not before she let out a breathless laugh and leaned in again, pressing another kiss against the corner of his lips. When Draco just blinked and stared back dumbly at her, his face still flushed and his eyes dazed with arousal, she smiled and reached up, caressing his cheek with her hand.
Chuckling to herself, Aria stopped and hovered near the outer edge of the pitch again, watching curiously as Draco, Blaise and the rest of the team began working on some basic drills. When she looked up about fifteen minutes later, it was to the impressive sight of Draco effortlessly tossing the quaffle through Blaise's defense for the sixth consecutive time since they had started.
She ignored his incoherent babbling and straddled him, pushing him back down onto the bed. When Draco just flushed and stared helplessly up at her, she gave him one last, teasing smile before she closed her eyes and, with an incredibly wanton moan, lowered herself back down onto him.

"Do I
When Draco seemed too stunned to do anything other than blink and give her an utterly deadpan stare, the icy tension that had blanketed their table suddenly melted away and the rest of the Slytherins dissolved slowly into a nervous bout of laughter.
"And they say your mouth is bigger than your brain, Parkinson." Aria drawled sarcastically, giving her a mocking smile.
"And the truth comes out." Draco sneered bitterly at her. "Did you have fun playing with me? What gives you the right to judge me like that? Who the hell do you think you are?!"
"Have you forgotten that I was the one who shouted for us to hand her over to the Dark Lord during the siege on Hogwarts?!" Pansy retorted, her cheeks burning at the memory. "I doubt she's forgiven me about that little incident, Draco!"

into her from behind, causing Aria to curse and reach her hands out in front of her, grabbing onto the table to prevent herself from stumbling to the floor.
She took a deep breath and counted to ten before she opened her eyes again and,
"As long as the class is easy enough to pass without too much work, count me in." Ron chimed, causing both girls to give him a deadpan glare. He blinked and returned their expressions with an innocent smile.
"Hannah, if you've dated each other for as long as you have and he still hasn't shown
On their way to the hospital wing, they bumped into Hermione – who looked completely aghast when she realized what happened and practically snapped at Ron for not bringing Aria to the hospital wing sooner.
"Of course it is, Ronald." Hermione waved his words aside and bent down over Aria's form again, inspecting her fully extended veela wings with a frown on her face. "Wow, that stray bludger really did a number on your wing, Aria. It looks really bad." She stared worriedly at Aria's left wing, noting the way the upper part of the wing, near the pointed edge at the top, was bent at an awkward, painful angle.
"If you like quidditch so much, why didn't you try out for the Slytherin Quidditch Team? You're already in second year after all." She mentioned, arching an eyebrow.
"What's wrong? Are you okay? Why are you staring at me like that?" He asked nervously.
"No, of course not. She'd never allow me to, she's too worried all the time." Corey admitted glumly.
"Ugh."
Neville laughed at Ron's comment and turned his attention back to Aria. "How are you feeling? Madam Pomfrey said that you lost a lot of blood."

"Doing what—?"
"Pansy." Draco groaned, closing his eyes and massaging his temples.
Ron and Aria were in the middle of a fierce chess game that afternoon in the school courtyard when Hermione suddenly bounded over to join them, plopping herself down onto the grass beside Aria.
Aria's eyes widened in surprise and she couldn't help smirking as she stared at her.
He recognized the voice that had spoken and looked up to find Pansy's younger brother, Corey Parkinson, looking up at him from the end of the aisle. The younger Slytherin looked a little hesitant as he approached, noting the obvious tension in Draco's demeanor.
Aria shivered at the tingle that ran down her spine.
Her voice trailed off, and for a long time, Aria just stared at him, her bright eyes swirling with so many unspoken thoughts and questions, not one of which made it past her lips. When she lowered her gaze again and looked away, Draco reached down and caught her chin, tilting her head back up so he could press a kiss onto her lips.
"No! No, that can't be! That's not possible, she couldn't have! Aria was supposed to mate with
"Tell me about it." Blaise agreed with a derisive snort. "I'm beginning to think Pansy hates Longbottom's guts more than she hates
"The day after I slept with him, he started acting really weird. A few days later, I noticed that a lot of boys from his house would whistle and point at me whenever they saw me in the hall. Apparently, Michael had taken pictures of me while I was asleep. He showed them to all of his friends." Pansy looked uncomfortable again and tried to hide it with another scoff but Aria's eyes suddenly flashed and she couldn't prevent the loud, angry growl from escaping her lips.
"No thanks to you, Butterfingers!" Austin snapped at him, knocking the other boy on the head with his gloves. "What the hell were you doing back there?! Have you never played quidditch before?!"
Before he left, he tried to convince Aria to come with him like she usually did, but Aria decided to decline. As much as she loved the Weasleys, she knew how important it was for them to spend their Christmas together alone as a family this year – especially since this was their first Christmas together after Fred's death.
He reached out and tried to take one of her gloved hands in his, only for Aria's eyes to narrow as she immediately moved away, pulling her hand out of his reach.
The beady-eyed reporter fell completely silent at Aria's words, and Draco was amused when he saw the stupefied look on her face as she sat back down into her seat. Aria went on and turned to address the crowd with an irritated look.
" He muttered sarcastically before sighing and straightening back up. "Don't worry, I'll stop bothering you now. I know you probably don't want to be seen talking to a Death Eater so I'll be on my way—"

"Oh come now, what's with that look, Miss Potter? You must have known this was coming, you're a very talented seeker after all! A chip off the old block, I'd say. Just like your father. A future quidditch star in the making!" He exclaimed enthusiastically.

had trouble with DADA. And most of my other subjects, really. They're all just so—"
"Well, no, not exactly—"
Draco laughed but didn't protest when she straddled him and furiously began unbuckling his belt, followed by his pants, until she pulled them both off, hurling them to the floor. She was just about to yank off his boxers when Draco suddenly rolled them over again, meeting the irritated look on her face with a cheeky grin.
She reddened even more at his words and continued to stare at him, looking unsure.
Draco stared shamelessly at her.
" Hannah added, giggling at the flabbergasted look on Zach's face.
" Fisher protested in a shrill voice as he stopped behind them and directed his angry, seething glare at Draco. "I meant for that bludger to hit
"Well, you and Zabini
Her lips twitched at his words and she tilted her head slightly to the side, as though she was reflecting very hard on his question. Finally, after a long moment, she smiled and began walking back slowly towards him, stopping only when her face was mere inches away from his.
"I did say yes, didn't I?" Aria sighed and gave him an exasperated look.
"So that's it?! You're just going to let that bastard go?" Aria seethed.
"I didn't want to do this, you know." Bentley turned his attention back to her, his features twisting into a derisive leer. "I would have been perfectly happy watching you from the sidelines with someone else...someone worthy by your side. But you were just so,
"Are you serious?! But I would never—"
Aria nodded at him in thanks; but Greg wasn't paying attention. He glanced back over his shoulder to glare at Draco across the room. Rolling her eyes at their antics, she used Greg's distraction to switch his wine glass on the table with hers. When he finally turned back around to face her, she offered him an innocent smile and took a long, dainty sip from her glass.
"So?"
She gasped when he bit down onto the skin of her neck, just below her jaw, before licking soothingly at the forming bruise. His eyes heavy lidded with lust, he eventually pulled away and looked down at her writhing form, smirking at her until she growled and began pawing at his clothes.
Aria lifted her gaze over Draco's shoulder and glared at Bentley Fisher's sneering face.
"Oh, you two. Stop being so melodramatic about all this. I'm perfectly fine."

interested. She was glaring furiously at him and was ineffectually shoving at his chest.
you filthy little blighter?!" Draco sneered.
Draco immediately flushed at Pansy's mocking drawl and glared at her. He ignored her amused smirk as he reached for his handkerchief and hastily used it to wipe his mouth. Fortunately, he was saved from the need to think of an equally sarcastic retort because Neville decided to take pity on him by patting his shoulder and changing the topic.

Aria went completely still as she stared at him.

"And...I'm
"That good, huh?"
"Did you go through my books?" Draco leveled him with an accusing glare.
To prepare them all for their impending NEWT examinations, Slughorn had been kind enough to teach them how to brew the Draught of Peace, a potion supposedly designed to relieve all of their stress and anxiety. After discussing the methodology and writing down the instructions and list of ingredients they'd be needing on the board, Slughorn turned to the class and rewarded them all with a cheerful smile.
Draco's eyes softened when he saw the jealous scowl on her face.
much of Potter's secret Blaise knew, or if it was even okay to talk about it in front of Pansy.
"Are you mocking me, scar-head?"
The strange, hesitant tone in Pansy's voice made Aria pause and arch an eyebrow at her over her shoulder.
yourself."
"—the kind of guy you like to date."
"I think she's the loveliest, kindest and most graceful girl I've ever me met." He reached up to wipe the single bead of sweat above his eyebrow. "I've been in love with her since we were five years old. Ever since the day our parents took us to the same party and she was the only kid there who bothered to talk to me, even though I was so shy and quiet. I want nothing more than for her to be happy. I only wish she could feel the same about me." He said quietly.
"I'm afraid so—"
Ultimately, of course, the choice is still up to you and I will respect whatever your decision will be. But I won't deny that you being bonded to a mate you can trust will make things so much easier for you in the long run."
"Listen, you sex-obsessed freak! I am
"That was before the war, Goyle." Draco interrupted him curtly, looking away.
"He was—" Pansy flinched and ducked her head, and Aria couldn't help but notice that there was a miserable tilt to her lips. "—well, we dated back in sixth year." She admitted grudgingly.
Draco's eyebrows fused together as he turned to look at Jenson to his right, noting that the other boy was looking at Aria with the exact same, lust-dazed expression on his face.
Draco peered at Morag through the spaces between the bookshelves, noting the way she pursed her lips and the way her shoulders had gone completely rigid when the two Ravenclaw girls suddenly burst into mocking giggles.
"So...We're actually doing this then?" He asked softly.
Draco couldn't answer, his attention drawn to the bulky Gryffindor-robed student who was trudging his way through the crowd towards them. When he reached their group, Pansy and Blaise began to mirror Draco's gaping expression and stared in stunned horror at one miserable looking Gregory Goyle.
The owlery was empty when he finally got to the top of the tower, probably because all of the students were mostly in the Great Hall eating their lunch. Draco was grateful for the privacy as it allowed him to take his time to re-read the letter he had written for his mother the night before.
Pansy remained silent and continued to stare at her with a strange, calculating look on her face. Eventually, Aria finished stacking all of the cleaning tools back into the cabinet and quietly closed the doors. She turned around to face the other girl slowly, giving her another grim smile.
"It's freezing up there, Potter." He pointed out.
Bulstrode?" Aria looked dubious, pointing discreetly to where Millicent was standing with Malfoy, Parkinson and Goyle across the room. "That mean gigantic girl who used to make fun of us all the time?"
"They
"Unforgivable Curses." Aria sighed and glared impatiently at her, shoving her thick-framed glasses back up onto her face. "How many times have you used them?"
They walked to their assigned classrooms in cold, awkward silence after that, broken only by the occasional clacking of their heels against the floor. When they reached the fifth floor corridor, Pansy spoke up again just as Aria was pushing past one of the classroom doors.
"What the hell, Blaise?!" Aria screeched, reaching frantically for the blankets and wrapping them around herself to cover her naked form. "A little warning would have been nice before you decided to peek your nosy face into the room!"
He reached the sloping passage leading to the Hufflepuff Common Room in a short amount of time. Just as he was about to join the small group of boys waiting by the entrance, the doors suddenly slid open and a petite, blonde girl peeked her head out.
"Mated or unmated?"
Swallowing the painful lump in his throat, he looked away from Aria and sat up from his seat. He had already made his way out of the crowd when Aria's next few words stunned him and drew his gaze back to her.
closer – that Aria immediately flushed and nearly stumbled over her own foot in her haste to back away from him.
really bad." She flushed at the way Draco was holding her and squirmed in his arms again, turning her face away. "It might be broken. I can barely lift my shoulder." She whispered.
May I help you,
Aria smirked at the thought and shook her head.
"Yes, thank you. A glass of wine would be nice. I'll be with you in ten minutes."
why you're not all cranky and bitchy anymore." Blaise clapped him hard on the back, causing Draco to wince and nearly drop his wand. "So all you needed to do was get laid?"
"I can explain—"
that still didn't stop him from staring dazedly at her face like a besotted, lovesick idiot.
"What are you—Aria, wait!"
"Hermione! Oh gods, is she okay?! That bastard bit her on the neck—"
"A veela?"
Most of the contents of the letter hadn't said much, just the usual meaningless pleasantries they often exchanged with one another at the start of every correspondence. However, what surprised Draco about the letter was that his Dream Girl had finally given him an official
To Draco's astonishment, Blaise's features softened at his words; and there was a smile that lingered on his face as he looked up and glanced fondly over to where Luna was standing with the rest of the wedding entourage by the dance floor.
and Fleur held up the lock of hair again to show that not a single strand had been cut.
"Don't you dare talk about her like that—"
! If I had just figured it all out before this happened, you wouldn't have gotten hurt!
Aria arched a single eyebrow at him. "What's your point, Draco?"
Pansy glared at her as though she was crazy.

As soon as the white feather burst into green flames, Aria felt all of the veela blood in her veins ignite with magic.
mother—"
Pansy rolled her eyes and opened her mouth to berate her even further but that was when Hannah suddenly sat up on the bed. She sniffed a couple of times and reached up, using the back of her hands to wipe the tears away from her cheeks. When she finally lifted her chin and met their eyes, Aria was surprised when she realized that a small, amused smile was tugging on the corner of her lips.
"Are you serious?" Aria snorted under her breath and rolled her eyes. "I gather that didn't exactly sit so well with Malfoy then?"
much, alright?" She gave them both a suggestive wink.
"And just so we're clear, Miss Potter." McGonagall arched an eyebrow at her. "When you say 'personally', do you mean—"
As soon as they were alone, Corey directed his scowling face at Aria, looking slightly put out.
"Your laziness knows no bounds, Ron."
"If this is your idea of an apology, Parkinson, it's not working." Aria growled.
The next few weeks that she spent recovering were torture.
Her grin faltered when Pansy flicked her eyes up and immediately silenced her with an exasperated glare.
supposed to know his girlfriend was Aria Potter?" She grumbled, though her lips were curled upwards into a smile as she glanced back at Draco and gave him a playful wink. "Or that she was an insanely possessive veela who likes to visit him unannounced from time to time?"
To her immense relief, Madam Pomfrey decided to transfer her into a private room, the one she usually reserved for infectious cases, and magically sealed the entire area off from all other students except for Ron and Hermione - who were free to come and go as they pleased. Once or twice, Madam Pomfrey caught a few students (mostly giggly first years who wanted a chance to approach the girl-who-lived) trying to sneak into Aria's room. Luckily, the charms held firm and none of them were able to enter; though that definitely didn't stop them from lingering near the doorway so much that Hermione finally lost her patience and threatened them all with a full month's detention if they didn't leave Aria alone.
"What makes you say that?" Ron asked, his eyebrows fusing together in alarm.
One thing was for certain. After everything Aria had been through in her life, she had absolutely no intention of being another unfortunate casualty to something like that.
"J—Juniper!" He gasped loudly and bent over, trying to retch all of the blood he drank onto the ground. "You poisoned me! When—how?!"

obviously. And maybe you, Longbottom. You're both recognized as bloody war heroes by the Ministry so I doubt they'd expel either of you." She muttered spitefully, rolling her eyes.
"Then why don't I put it to better use?"
Draco frowned at her reaction and opened his mouth, ready to chastise her for thinking she had anything to apologize for when a soft scuffling sound from a few meters away suddenly drew his attention, causing both him and Aria to stiffen in alarm and immediately draw their wands. When they walked slowly towards the source of the sound, they were surprised when a tall, half-man, half-horse figure suddenly stepped out from behind the shadows and began to approach them.
The three of them looked up, watching as Madam Pomfrey peeked her head into the small room.

"Yes."
"And you know what's worse? Now, I don't even have a date to the Yule Ball. And Ernie will be there, all happy and slow dancing with that blonde bint. It'll be so humiliating." She grumbled, grabbing one of her pillows and hugging it tightly to her chest in comfort.
"Well, the man
Aria's eyes had gone wide at his reaction and she took a cautious step backwards from him, her hand instinctively reaching for her wand in her pocket.
extending a mate-bond." She said firmly.
He hated to admit it to himself but one of the reasons he had chosen to purchase a flat near London was that it was relatively walking distance to the train station, and so he could frequent Hogs Head most evenings, hoping to bump into her again. Unfortunately, he didn't see her again for the rest of the summer and when Draco asked the pub bartender if the girl still frequented the place, the bartender had bluntly told him that he was wasting his time because there hadn't been any beautiful girls visiting her pub in
"After you've already played with me and saved my life, you're just going to throw me away? Am I not interesting anymore for the perfect Chosen One?"
veelas go about choosing a mate?" Granger asked again, her eyes wide with keen interest.
"Wait…What?" At her words, the bright, adoring smile on Bentley's face faded.
"I don't have to lift a single fingernail against someone like you. But…expulsion perhaps? For harassing your fellow classmate?" Aria answered him with a chilling look, arching a single eyebrow.
It wasn't exactly irritating on Aria's part since she pretty much

She spent the next few minutes addressing their ridiculous questions for awhile —
He had a feeling that his life was about to become a lot more complicated from now on.
After they exited King's Cross station, Aria began leading them through a series of streets and alleys that Draco didn't recognize, so he presumed that they were probably non-magical neighborhoods. Thankfully, they were both out of their school robes and wearing relatively casual clothing so it wasn't hard for them to blend in with the crowd of muggles around them.
hearing this!" Neville suddenly blurted out, the tops of his ears noticeably pink as he stepped away from them and furiously shook his head. "Ugh, please stop talking about this in front of me! Aria's one of my friends, and I will never be able to look her in the eye again without thinking about everything you just said!"
He tried to gauge everyone's reactions for a few seconds before he nodded to himself and stood up, shoving his notes back into his bag and rearranging his things on the desk. "Before I dismiss you, the Headmistress did instruct me to remind you that your next essay assignment will be on elves next; and as usual, it is due before your next class." Wood smirked when he heard several grumbles echo around the small classroom.
Draco pulled back, ever so slightly, and used his hands to spread her legs even wider. He leaned in again, tasting her slowly and leisurely with broad upward licks of his tongue.
Aria only sighed in response. "In any case, I'm glad you fought me. If you hadn't, who knows what else Fisher would have made me do."
Aria clutched self-consciously onto her braid and lifted her gaze, taming down her natural instinct to wince and run away when she noticed that most of her new male teammates were beginning to look a little dazed and confused the longer they stared at her.
Aria frowned at the strange, deceptively innocent tone of his voice.
"Mmm."

Draco turned his attention back to his reflection in the mirror, primping and fidgeting for a few more minutes. Finally, after he was absolutely certain that he looked nothing less than flawless, he nodded to himself and walked out of the room.
