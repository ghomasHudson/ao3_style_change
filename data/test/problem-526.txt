Draco Malfoy, I should’ve known you were a size queen. Those pictures, you naughty thing, you. Did you charm it to fuck you into a second orgasm? Til you had tears in those gorgeous eyes and you were begging for mercy? Well it filled you up nicely, that much was obvious. I have a feeling I’ll be able to keep up with you, though.
Draco nodded to them. "I've heard much about you. Pleasure to put a face to the names." Alistair smiled at him and stood up, approaching him. He was as tall as Lucius, though not as intimidating. He gently rested his hands on Draco's shoulders and kissed his cheeks-- the same way Gwen had.
“Albus--!” She hissed, approaching him as he turned to the Malfoy boy’s body. So young… burdened with a task he was destined to fail… “What are we to do?” She asked again, certain that the Headmaster had changed his plans. And so he had.
“You’re not the first person to tell me that… but you might’ve said it the nicest.” He sighed and pressed a gentle kiss to the top of her head. “So… you know he’s been bitten and turned and ran away.”
“So I was going to start reading it seriously, making notes of my own. It’s something I want to do for him, when he gets home. He shouldn’t have to spend the full moons alone.”
“No, no, it’s okay. I
“Oh no, it’s okay,” Harry responded, “I’m just fine waiting until visiting hours officially begin.”
It took them the better part of an hour before all the pixies were in the cage and stunned. “Well! Amazing way to keep the day interesting!”
For now, I’ve bought myself an over-the-counter bottle, but soon I will be brewing my own, a practice which in Britain is frowned upon. Yet another reason to stay away.
"You've never filed against me in five years for anything remotely serious." He'd reported Harry to Robards for ridiculous things — accidentally using his tea mug, bringing in a cake for his 21st birthday, landing himself in St. Mungo's — but never for sexual harassment or anything that legitimately counted as inappropriate workplace behavior.
Draco. You know that’s not what he needs. He needs time to sort himself out, after what happened.” Harry frowned, but still rubbed her back. God, he hated it when Luna was right. “Are you going to be staying for lunch?”
“Oh, don’t worry, I can help teach you. It’s not so difficult, no worries.” She wove her arm through his and led him into the breakfast nook, where Harry had subconsciously laid out Narcissa’s favorite tea and sweets, chocolate-dipped orange madeleines. Narcissa smiled at him. “Harry, darling, you spoil this old woman.”
Don’t worry, I’ll have Pans send you a couple of her books. She’ll be pleased to know that you’re finally turning over to the dark side, she’s been going on to me for ages about her dalliances. You know, she’s looking for husband number three, right now? If you have anyone in mind you aren’t particularly fond of, I can send them her way for you.
The locket… Harry retrieved the locket from his old Headmaster's pocket and soon realized that it wasn't the one Dumbledore had described-- no ‘S’ to he seen. The note inside-- from a one R.A.B.-- indicated that it was a fake, that Dumbledore had weakened himself for nothing…
“Mm, sort of…” Harry paused, and the reached out, taking Draco's hands in his own. “It's kind of serious, actually, Draco. Life-changing, one might say…”
“Draco Malfoy,” he said. Certainly he could be safe, here. The Parisians wouldn’t know his name. “I’m afraid I haven’t heard of your nephew.”
With his wand, he made long vertical cuts up both of young Malfoy’s forearms and the shirt was once again stained with blood. The deed done and the body sufficiently mutilated, Albus stopped the bleeding with a quick spell. Albus summoned a house elf  to pack all of Draco’s possessions while the other students were in their classes.
“Yea- came from the West, it did. Huge beasty, must've been larger than a Ridgeback.” Harry was surprised; no one seemed to be terribly afraid, like a new breed of dragon was just another example of the strange things that happened here.
Draco glanced around. “...Ma’am, I don’t understand-”
like a Malfoy. She and Lucius have nearly the same eyes… and the cheekbones, that’s all Draco…”
Harry hauled himself up a bit more, and then settled with a sigh into the small space. It was surprisingly comfortable and warm and he could feel each breath that the dragon took. The gentle motion was comforting, and he was soon dozing off.
Usually, Harry Potter began his day with a coffee and pastry from the little café around the corner from his office. Usually, he would spend an hour or so looking over the latest academic findings of other magizoologist researchers, or peruse a few of the new articles in
The bright green flash of light hit the Headmaster squarely in the chest. He was dead before he even fell over the edge of the Astronomy tower. Bellatrix cackled madly and the Dark Mark began to form over Hogwarts with a crazed slash of her wand.
Draco’s blood was spreading across the wooden floor, and Harry had a brief flashback to their ill-fated duel in the bathrooms in sixth year. Draco was going grey quickly and Harry was panicking.
The small house elf, apparently named Mimsy, appeared then with two steaming bowls of what Harry immediately recognized as French onion soup-- one of his favorites. How had she known? Had Draco actually mentioned Harry's favorite
“I believe we are,” Gwendolyn said, rubbing Draco’s back with her other hand. “Just a bit overwhelmed, October, he’ll be alright.” She pulled away just a bit to look up into his face. “Are you going to be alright for dinner, if we give you a bit of time to compose yourself?” She brushed a bit of hair out of his face.
I love you.
He was nearly close enough to reach out and touch the dragon’s wing, and Harry decided that the dragon was calm enough to start attempting to heal him.
Merlin, this was his life now. Well, his afterlife.
Your letter surprised me in a number of ways, though I was glad to get it.
He nodded again. “I’ve gotten myself an over-the-counter Wolfsbane for the time being.”
“Yes, ma'am, thank you,” Harry replied, fishing two galleons out of his pocket in exchange for the key. The wild man by Harry's side seemed beside himself with excitement, eagerly waiting his turn to speak with the newcomer.
The other ghosts of Hogwarts shook their heads and sighed as their newest member let out a frightened sob, his angular face hidden in pale hands. Moaning Myrtle approached him and held him close as he shook like a leaf. Like each of them, he had unfinished business that wouldn’t let him leave this world behind. But unfinished business such as theirs was just as terrifying as death, sometimes even more so. Myrtle rubbed his back, letting Draco hide his face in her neck as he cried.
He felt he’d been abandoned by his so-called friends in Slytherin. None of them had come looking for him. They didn't seem overly concerned that he'd vanished in the middle of breakfast. He hadn't ventured into the Slytherin dungeons until after the term ended, but found his bed to be empty… no trunk, no books, no quills and parchment. Someone had packed his things and secreted them away… probably to the Manor.
“Indeed. Have you considered my offer?”
“It is, yes. Rings aren’t necessarily
"Well! There is your answer!" He squeezed Draco's shoulder before patting him on the back. "You say the word, we will get you the champagne to celebrate."
There was taunting, threats, but Draco didn't hear them. Potter, Crabbe, Goyle, Voldemort's soul-- it was all too much. When Crabbe cast the spell that set the Edwardian chairs on fire, Draco let out an ear-piercing scream.
Glancing to Draco, Harry saw that most of their attention was on him, as Draco seemed to only be battling one wizard, as opposed to Harry’s three. Right, okay. Easy enough. Draco wouldn’t take long to down his own opponent, then he would help Harry take his down. This still wasn’t one of their hardest fights, they could deal with this. The room seemed to brighten a small amount and both men glanced to the source. The moon. A full moon, tonight? That was odd-
(See the end of the chapter for
He can't help but chuckle, because the definitely sounded like Draco. "He must make me sound like some kind of barbarian, huh? Not everyone can be as graceful. Really, I'm just a bit clumsy and headstrong, that's all." He paused for a moment. "I can be gentle."
Thinking it over himself, he finally frowned. “So what are we supposed to do about it?”
Three… Potter was currently pacing in the hall outside, requesting a room to find a horcrux. The room and indeed the castle itself told Draco so, as if it were asking Draco's final permission to allow Potter in. After all, the castle had witnessed his death. It had been the only witness, really.
“Eighteen metres?” Hell, the thing was just as huge as Charlie said. Getting himself more comfortable, Harry took a sip off his pint. “What else can you tell me?”
"Oh, Harry," Hermione said softly.
what those words are doing to me, right now. I
"Perhaps you could pay Madam Pomfrey a visit on your way out… just to be safe about those leaves."
Write back soon.
“Thanks, Luna.”
He turned, and tried to get a good luck at Narcissa to see how she was reacting, but he couldn’t get a good read on her. It was like she’d turned into a wall. Harry kept glancing back and forth, at Narcissa, and at the memory.
There are SO many ways I could do this, but I've narrowed it down to 3 choices for you all to vote on!
“Ohh, yes. Andromeda. Her daughter Dora was one was well, I remember. I just got a letter from her last week, talking about her little grandson.”
I love you too, so much.
Narcissa took a moment to think about it as she sat. “I believe so, yes.” She rose a hand, giving it a wave, and murmuring her spell quietly. A large book fell into her hands. “Perfect, exactly where I left it.”
Valerie laughed, shaking her head. “Draco, don’t you have kids? When they’re in a good mood, they think everything is funny.”
“How are you doing? Are you holding up alright? I don’t use that salve much. Is it working pretty good for you?” The dragon snorted, smoke billowing out of its nostrils. He took that as an affirmative. Actually, it was pretty strange, this dragon seemed to be giving him real responses.
[[Included are two pictures. The first has Harry on his back, legs spread and hips propped up on a pillow, spread out on their bed as he works a nicely sized dildo into himself. He’s flushed all over and isn’t wearing his glasses.
The dragon had turned to look at Harry as he blabbed on, and at one point Harry could have sworn the dragon had a look of shock or even fear in his eyes. Harry shrugged it off as just another quirk of this unusual creature and continued his train of thought.
Abraxas, to remove any memory of her, to believe he had been an only child.”
what Harry needed right—It fell. It fell down into the grass. Had it hurt its wing at some point? He needed to get closer to take a look.
Harry sighed before finally sitting himself down. "It's Draco." He saw the looks they threw at each other, an entire conversation passing in a second, and a small part of him couldn't help but to feel jealous. “I— He’d skin me alive for telling you this, probably, but it’s all related, so…” He swallowed thickly and kept his gaze firmly on the table. “The last raid we had, the one with the Crowlins? One of them was an unregistered werewolf, and we went out on the night of the full… and Draco was turned.”
Mr. Malfoy-Potter,
“No, he doesn’t, and I would advise against going after him. You know how he is, dear. The second you find him, he’ll run farther and faster.”
“Valerie Frey, it’s nice to meet you.” She sat down across from him, and he was able to look at her a bit closer. Her dark hair curled soft and loose around her shoulders, framing her round face. She had a smattering of dark freckles over her nose and cheeks, and her eyes were like coffee with milk. This was his cousin? She looked more like Hermione Granger’s long lost cousin than his own. But she had a kind look about her, and he liked that.
“Oh yes, my mother was very much keeping up with the war— both of them, really. She’s English, as was my father, rest his soul. She had your trial up on the wireless radio, we all celebrated when you were alright.”
“Darling,” Draco said, sitting down with his roast beef sandwich and Granny Smith apple. Harry looked up at him as he tucked the full spoon into his mouth. “Not to be rude, but what the actual fuck are you eating?”
Ouch.
"It means you're feisty and probably ready for a fight, cousin."
“Oh, didn’t grandma mention? I can’t do that.” She leaned forward a bit and smiled when she saw the train coming. “Perfect timing, as usual.”
Later that night, after spending more time with ‘the family’ and exploring their personal library, Draco went back into his bedroom for the night and saw the shirt still lying there on his bed.
It’s not just to keep myself busy. It’s for the independence it gives. And, yes, making up for my past sins. What I did in the war is unforgivable, but doing the work we do can at least help me start to make up for it all. And also… I don’t want to just depend on house elves, and mother, and the family vault, all the time. I’ve got to learn to lean on myself.
Startling, Draco stared up at her before smiling. “Well… I do mean to visit the vineyard. Miranda, yes? I have a friend that would love a fresh bottle.”
“Still is a bit tricky I suppose, when I see him around the Ministry. It’s not like I have to pretend to hate him any more, everyone’s over that now, but Merlin, I can’t have him knowing I’ve got a little thing for him, he’d never let me live it down.”
Thank you for keeping mother company. You know well by now that the days since the war haven’t been kind to her. I hadn’t thought about what my leaving will do to her, but I dread what my return will entail. This is what’s best, right now. It has to be.
"Yes," Harry murmured, eyes fixed on his other self, watching how terrified he'd been in that moment. "He was trying to stop Sirius from hurting me. Everyone thought that's why he'd broken out of Azkaban, but it was to keep Pettigrew away from me."
They'd finished up a long, arduous case and, to celebrate, they'd had dinner at Harry's. He had cooked, Draco brought wine, there was some whiskey with dessert… and Harry had kissed him. In fact, it had been a bit more than kissing. Harry had loved the feel of Draco under his hands, just as he loved Draco's hands on him. Harry had thought they might head to bed… but Draco had pulled back, muttered some half-apology, and was through Harry's Floo before he'd even known what was going on.
"He has a sweet tooth, this one," Remy laughed, patting Draco on the back. "But good taste. I will find you some Loire Valley sparkling wine soon, you will appreciate it better than my brother-in-law," he joked.
“Lovely, lovely.” She gave him a quick kiss at his temple and pulled away. “I hope we’ll see you here next week, as well.”
I’m glad they approve. I did like the pictures I saw that depicted it. Are there any others I need to be made aware of? I think I need a couple pictures from the front, just to be sure.
The thought of Harry dragging him off for that… was agony. Though Granger and her colleagues were working towards drastic reform towards the rights and treatment of creatures, he would most likely be captured and branded before the week was out. Draco shook his head. He needed to get himself out of this room. Maybe go shopping. Shopping might help make him feel better. Maybe get him back to his old self. After all, he hadn't packed very much, he could afford to go on a bit of a spree. He'd need more parchment soon and it would be wise to pick up more ink-- and that wasn't even the most fun bit of shopping.
"Well, I'm learning to not care what anyone has to say." He didn't have many role models to disappoint, and his friends didn't tend to do the whole 'judge you' thing, besides Hermione. Harry, for the most part, knew what he wanted and did what he pleased. "Oh-- And I'll pop by the Ministry this week, fill in the vacation forms so Draco and I aren't blatantly skipping work."
“Drago!”
Molly gave a short little giggle. “No, dear. Bonding jewelry is entirely different. Bonding jewelry, you often put a piece of your own magic into, when you give it to the other person. A courting gift is entirely symbolic.”
Option Number 1:
Suddenly, Harry wasn't very hungry. "I don't know. I mean, I guess I understand why he'd be anxious about it, but I made the move. I feel like that was a big risk on my part."
“Oh, my darling, I didn’t expect you to know. Don’t feel bad about it.” She leaned over and gently patted his forearm. “So. I think we need some introductions, hm? Meet your cousins?”
"Mr. Potter, how you were allowed into the Auror ranks knowing nothing of magical cores… it's probably a blessing you were paired with Mr. Malfoy. Were you still a student here, I would dock points and be speaking with your other professors."
Every ghost that called Hogwarts home was gathered in the 6th floor toilets, talking quietly to each other. Each one of them had felt a pull in their chests they couldn’t ignore, a pull that summoned them to the tiled room. It looked more like a cathedral in this moment, so filled with people in fine silver garments.
“My love, you could tell me anything, and it will never leave my lips. I would take an Unbreakable Vow. I do not spill my family’s secrets.”
Harry knocked loudly, and the door opened after a long few moments of him simply waiting there. Pansy, it seemed, had thrown on a lacy satin black robe over herself, maybe hoping to snatch a new toy. “Oh. Potter. What are you doing here?”
“But it’s not a part of my… of my courting Draco, is it? It seems a bit… specific to our situation.”
“That’s all he’s got to say?” He handed the letter to Narcissa, sitting back down and grumbling as he picked up his coffee, taking a nice long sip. Narcissa looked over the letter, nodding along. “So he has been turned, then… Well, he’s told you he’s in Paris, though I will stand by my word that you shouldn’t go after him.”
"She only looks for those with… power and influence in high places." Remy and Sapphire both hummed and shared a Look.
If you happen to improve the taste or the effectiveness of the potion, you’d be helping so many people, not just yourself, love. I’ll keep a careful eye on you during the moons to see if anything changes, if you act any different because of the potion. Brilliant ideas, you have, seriously brilliant. We’ll keep a notebook, treat them like proper clinical trials.
I like that idea. Teddy at Hogwarts with us. Imagine him sitting to the side in your classes, trying to take his best notes and ending up doodling for half the class. It sounds perfect.
Narcissa nodded. “Alright, then.” That was it? ‘Alright, then?’ He hummed a bit, thinking that she was definitely holding back her thoughts on the matter. The grandfather clock down the hall charmed 11:30, and Harry sat up.
your name? Did you break out your own toy? I’d love to see it.
I originally wanted this to be longer, but I figured chapter 4 could be a nice mix of perspectives instead.
I love you.
"Ah, but we have heard of you!" October said, brown eyes wide, but not in fear. A grin spread across his face. "Draco— dragon in the stars. Yes, you are an Auror! Your story, it is so captivating."
"Even if it's a
When he arrived, he was told by a nice nurse that he was too early for visiting hours. He simply smiled at him and prepared to spend 30 minutes in an uncomfortable hospital waiting room, but could see the moment the hospital staff realized exactly who he was.
Quite honestly, I shudder at the thought of most of our professors having children of their own, except maybe Minerva and Pomfrey. (Sprout and Flitwick are hard maybes.) Can you honestly imagine Snape with a kid? Or Trelawney, dear Merlin… Maybe there used to be a rule against teachers having children at the school, but it's unnecessary and old-fashioned so I wouldn't be surprised if Minerva did away with it.
Harry ran his hands through his hair— messing it up even more than normal. “Have I told you your son is infuriating? No, I won’t go after him. Besides, I’d probably end up lost in the French countryside, and where would we be then?”
“I’d have to agree. I don’t see anything leading to this being more than a simple arrest.”
They must've come to take his body, they must've. He wasn't buried on Hogwarts grounds, he could feel it. He had a hunch he was buried far, far away. Good. Maybe his parents had finally left.
“Yes, I am… I’m not sure where to start…” He looked at her and subconsciously rubbed his inner wrist. “What did he do for you, exactly?”
Yes, well, that might be true, but there was nothing he could do about it now. Potter would never want him now. Harry could never be with a werewolf, no matter what he thought of Lupin. Miranda leaned over. “Oh, Draco… What is that?” Her fingers brushed against the edge of his new scars and he immediately jerked away.
part of the Malfoy line. And what a strange concept that was, not being the last Malfoy!
But Ron knew what it was like to be in love. Hell, nearly two years ago Harry had been Ron's best man when he and Hermione had gotten married. Harry would probably get a couple days of shit from him, ‘the ferret? Really, the ferret? I knew you were bent, but bent for Malfoy is another thing entirely.’ Then Ron would give it up ‘I’ve been rooting for you the whole time. You knew I was messing, right?’ And if Ron had figured out that Draco had been turned during the raid… there might not be much teasing at all.
"Certainly, Mr. Potter. What do you need?"
Harry's mouth dropped open in shock and his eyebrows shot up towards his hairline. Courting gift?
That… does sound bloody wonderful, but you know how dangerous it would be, and not just because of my new condition. You know that the Wizarding World of Britain at large would still rather see me in Azkaban, exiled completely, or dead. And you’re the Savior of the Wizarding World. You don’t think we wouldn’t get any backlash from something like that? People hearing that I was up for Auror training was bad enough. We’d be having to check for letter curses for weeks.
“Can’t you see? He's off and bloody joined You-Know-Who! They gave him the Mark and pulled him from school!”
He shrank and stowed his Firebolt before entering the local pub, The Frog & Peach. It seemed like a mash-up of the Burrow and the Hog's Head; warm and old and wild, which matched most of the pub's patrons as well. In fact, a good number of them nearly looked creature-like in their wildness. Perhaps he'd come to the right place to ask after a rare and dangerous beast.
P.S. I don't care for the shirt anymore. I've sent it back.
“Ah… that’s Devin for you, I suppose. I’m sure they’re all very different from any family or friends that you have back home, yes?”
Narcissa cut him off. “Harry… what happened to my son?”
Harry frowned, nodding along to Charlie’s story. “You don’t think someone let it out near the Muggles, do you?”
“Dear Merlin and gods above have mercy on me,” he found himself muttering as he clutched at the railing. He frowned when Valerie laughed at him, and she just shook her head.
I just need to know that you're
"That is her goal, yes," he told them with a sly smirk. "It's been her dreams since she was a young girl."
“Yes. Full moon is in just a few days.”
Yes, I absolutely did enjoy it, and I even sent a photo or two for you, but I do have to say, it felt awfully lonely. Did you wank while you wrote that? Did you pretend that you were the one breaking me down piece by piece? Or maybe you were imagining yourself in my place, trying your best to get fingers up your arse while you sat at your desk, trying to think of all the right words to say to get me
Conjured oil might not be the best, but I know it would make you sweat if I did it wandlessly, wouldn't it? Maybe I'd only do that for my fingers. I could spend hours with my fingers in you, love, until you're begging me to stop and wailing for my cock. I don't think I'll tease you, the first time. You know I'm not a very patient man.
My potion is actually going rather well. It's still in one of the brewing stages, now. Have they registered me, yet? I keep looking over my shoulder expecting an owl with a letter reprimanding me for not following procedure, and for leaving the country.
"Plant your feet and move with the train, Draco. And hold on to the bar," she said, still giggling.
“Can you, uh…” Harry cleared his throat. “Can you tell Alfred I’m sorry?” Neville looked up at him and grinned, shaking his head.
“Yes, I noticed,” he said quietly. Derrick’s eyes were a dark brown, like his father’s. Definitely not Harry’s jade green. Huh. Looking down to the little girl that was in his wife’s lap, Draco did his best to smile. “And… who’s this?” The little girl was grinning and laughing and already reaching for the plates and spoons. She had dark, straight hair pulled back into pigtails, and lighter skin than her father, though she did have freckles splattered across her face and arms. She was an adorable little thing, really. Derrick chuckled and put the little plastic baby spoon into her hand. “This is our daughter Morrigan, she’s two and a half.”
Whoa, okay, not the point of the tub.
“Albus--” Mcgonagall starts, finally tearing her gaze away from the young man's body. Her posture is stiff, her eyes wild, and Albus knows she is frightened for the rest of the students. “How could this happen? Who would do such a terrible thing?”
Harry frowned, confused. "Fighting? No, um-- alright, long story short, he was hurt in a raid last night and escaped St. Mungo's this morning. I can't find him anywhere and I've already been to the Manor and to Pansy's. His mother and I are worried so… if you see him, owl me or Narcissa, will you?"
“You and Hermione make more than Draco and I do, first of all, and both Teddy and your baby have wealthy family members. It’s about the way you’re raised and the ideals your family surrounds you with. If Lucius had stayed in Azkaban the first time, and not been around to raise Draco, I can guarantee you things would be different.”
The dragon looked back at Harry and lowered its head down towards him. Great, now he’d offended him, and he was going to get eaten. The dragon used its nose and mouth to nudge at Harry, almost
"Oh." Although, he was suddenly having doubts about this whole animagus thing. He wasn't much a fan of hallucinations, really. Not that he knew anyone that was.
Draco Malfoy
She finally pulled away, brushing his hair back one more time. “A few of the elves will stay and tend to it.”
You… you do know that Remus was our professor, right? And that he was also a werewolf? And Minerva was totally in favor of him teaching us? She was the one who suggested him to Dumbledore, as she told me yesterday over tea. She says to expect a letter from her, soon, by the way. I’ve learned not to question her. I’m guessing it’s something about the dungeons, or your personal brewing, but I can never be sure.
In a blinding flash of light, a figure seemed to materialize, just as opaque as his spectral audience. His hair, face, and skin looked largely unchanged-- as pale in not-quite-death as he was in life. The most striking thing about him were the large slashes across his scrawny chest, easily visible through his shirt. Much of him was soaked in silver that shimmered when it caught the pale spring sunlight.
"I know, I'm everyone's least favorite person this morning. You were expecting someone else?" Someones, more like. Harry knew quite a bit about the drama involving Blaise, Seamus, and Dean, as well as Blaise's growing collection of side-pieces.
Harry didn't know why Charlie was back in the UK, let alone in St. Mungo's version of A&E. It had been a huge shock, seeing Ron's face in his fireplace that afternoon on an urgent Floo call. He’d peeked into the room while the healers were working on Charlie and winced—Charlie would be out of commission for some time, and he’d come out of this with quite a few wicked scars. (It’d only make the git more attractive, at any rate.) Harry had then been promptly yelled at by a healer and escorted back to the waiting area with the rest of the Weasleys.
bruised."
Who did this woman think she was, telling him this? After only an evening of knowing him? “I harbor no such feelings towards him, and he definitely holds no affections towards me.”
And then there was bloody Potter. The Golden Boy. Saint Potter. The Savior. His murderer.
Okay, so no magic in the first gift. Had to be visible, to show people they were in the process of being courted. Hm. “...what did he give you? If I’m allowed to ask?”
Husband and wife faced each other, pointedly not looking at the body of their son, now lying still as a statue on the long mahogany table. “Untraceable international portkey,” Lucius rasped, raising a hand to rub over his stubbled chin. “It will be delivered by Floo in the next 15 minutes, according to Kershaw. Portkey takes us to Concord, we Apperate to Amherst.” To the secret family estate in New Hampshire. It had been a wedding present from a well-off uncle of Lucius’ mother and therefore did not bear the Malfoy name-- it would be untraceable, should the Dark Lord or Dumbledore come looking for them. It would be their safe haven. They would bury their son there.
"Yes, ma'am?"
The first run-in at her shop occured in 2000. Draco had been on the table, on his front, shirtless as Euthymia carefully tapped out the outline of a dragon on his shoulder. The door opened and Harry stepped through, though the curtain was up for privacy.
Yours,
good, but I know it will never compare to the real thing. The more I try to put your scent into words, the less I can grasp it. Apparently canine senses don’t transfer exactly to a human vocabulary.
That was an intense wank session you instigated in your last letter. Not even laid a finger on me yet, but you already know how I tick and what I like. I really wish I could include the sound in the photos, too. I wonder if it would make you melt easier, to hear my voice lull you to sleep, to hear the pet names in person, to hear all the naughty talk in person (of sorts).
“Not in yours or my lifetimes that we know of, no. I will admit… I had great fears that
It seemed that the dragon didn’t want to be left alone, and Harry was worried that it would injure itself even more trying to prevent Harry from leaving. “Well, if you’re going to make me stay here while you heal, the least you could do is let me sit down.”
The Manor. His parents. His task… surely He would've known of Draco's death by now. Would the Dark Lord blame Draco for dying without killing Dumbledore? Would his parents suffer since Draco couldn't? Even after death, there was so much uncertainty in Draco's mind.
Yours with love,
I’m mailing you to tell you that Draco has been residing with me since just before the full moon. Yes, I know of his condition, and I am doing what I can to help him through it. I’ve already sworn myself to secrecy for him, no worries. I already adore him as if he were my own, of course. And that brings me to asking.
Prof. H.J. Potter-Malfoy
“This is… For what it's worth, I am deeply sorry for what you are about to see.” Was that a hitch in her voice? The married couple shared a look and a sinking feeling settled in both their stomachs. They ascended the stairs and opened the door.
“Silver Prince it is, then. I'll pass the word. We'll have you spooking the students in no time, boy.”
Onwards!!
She looked over at him and smiled. “Metro. It’s very close to Bas’ work, and saves us lots of walking time.”
After that, the shop was put on the map.
"On one condition," she interrupted with the ghost of a smirk. Harry stilled and raised an eyebrow. Oh this came with fine print?

when a dragon was curled on its side, but he didn’t know how to get there. “It looks like I’m going to have to climb a bit. If you could not hurt me while I do this, that would be great.” He took a deep breath and began to gingerly heave himself up onto one of the dragon’s legs, careful to avoid its wing. He paused for a moment, but the dragon seemed fine—one eye was closed and the other was watching Harry with a lazy interest.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle. Draco being unable to bitch about the incompetence of various coworkers or even the criminals themselves. He'd miss that gorgeous velvety voice too much. Bad suggestion. Harry smiled at Porthos. "I'm gonna hold off on the reply for a bit, alright? Rest up, eat some food." For now, he had more important things to- Like answering the Floo.
“Also… I was briefly engaged to Alphard Black before I was disowned and eloped with my late-husband.”
“It’s just a pet name, relax. What size shoe are you?” Bas scooted his foot to rest parallel to Draco’s, for comparison. “Maybe a 44? You’re probably the same as me.”
“Sorry I’ve been gone so long, I’m on an extended holiday from work right now. How are you?”
Luna nodded as she put her tea cup down. “No wonder Ginny had so much to complain over.” That definitely caught Harry off guard. He hadn’t thought too much about other possible reasons why he and Ginny wouldn’t have worked, because he had a Draco to pine after, and he thought Ginny and Luna were much better together.
to his mother at some point?
“A pair of robes, huh?” Well… he supposed that did give him an idea. Gods, Draco would look so good in midnight blue, especially up against his pale skin. And Harry would have such a good time helping him
Gwen paused and hummed a bit. "Well, let's see. I had three children. They had seven. And I now have five great-grandchildren. Plus a few spouses here and there… more than 20, darling."
“I’ve a cage set over there, I just need you to round them up, Harry.” There were definitely more pixies in the room than there were when Lockhart let them out of their cage in second year. This was an infestation.
With the deed done, Lucius and Narcissa held each other tightly. They sank to their knees next to the fresh earth and wept.
Harry was up bright and early the next morning, used to waking up before the sun to study the various creatures that constituted his work. He wanted to have a chance to go over the case file from the Ministry once more before heading to the hospital. He stopped by his favourite pastry shop near St.Mungo’s and picked up a chocolate croissant.
[[A series of pictures is also enclosed. Draco is on his knees, his head laid down on the bed, his rear facing the camera. The first picture simply has him posing in that position, breathing, his eyes occasionally fluttering shut. The next picture is Draco beginning to circle his fingers around his rim, pushing them in. The pictures continuously get faster and more intense until Draco’s got his wand in one hand, waving it and causing a dildo to start pumping in and out of his arse. His face and chest are red, and his mouth is wide open as it looks as though drool is slowly dripping. There is no picture of him finishing.]]
“You silly!” Tristan giggled around an apple slice, and Gwen squeezed his sides a bit, trying to get the boy to calm down and eat.
You don't seem to understand. If I go back, I'll
“I… believe so, yes. My mother, Narcissa Black, daughter of Cygnus and Druella.” Gwendolyn nodded sagely, still smiling at him.
“Don’t make him choose between a partner and family, Ron—” She said, but Harry was already standing up. He didn’t come for a fight, and he didn’t want to spend too long thinking about if he’d have to choose between Draco and the Weasleys.
Enjoy!
“Come on, let’s go bother my brother.”
crying over breakfast. Narcissa rubbed his back while moving the pancake batter off to the side.
Draco summoned his energy and gripped George's wrist-- wand in the redhead's hand-- and pointed it at Dolohov.
I completely understand about the complicated feelings over resigning. I'm sure you'd have much rather retired after a few decades on the force, dozens of high profile cases solved and criminals put to justice by your hand. But honestly Draco, you've done so much in such a short time that you shouldn't feel cheated or guilty, at least about this. Robards has extended a near-permanent invitation to tea, by the way. I went to visit the other day and I swear he was a bit teary-eyed.
He gave a smile much against his will at the sight of it all. “I… I’ve been told as much, at least.” He took his seat and Gwen spelled a bit of fresh whipped cream to the top of the tower of crêpes.
Harry looked down at the unappetizing breakfast tray in the nurse’s hands and shrugged. He might as well. The nurse led the way through a series of hallways and corridors to a white hospital door that looked like all the other white hospital doors.
"A review course on core magic seems to be the best course of action for this hour. We can keep that third leaf out of the equation at least until you get home."
Gin has invited us to the Harpies/Quaffle Punchers game, and she's bet that the Harpies will win, by at least 160 points. Send your reply to the bet in your next letter to Luna, will you?
“You’re on edge, I can tell. Is it only meeting everyone at once, or is it more than that?”
Narcissa put a hand to her head, looking as though she were faint. “My dear, darling Draco. Reduced to
“You know… usually couple tattoos are done in the same session, with both people present.”
“Sirius always cared more about those close to him, rather than himself,” she said quietly.
As soon as Harry started moving, the dragon made a high-pitched screech and moved its injured wing down, trapping Harry under it. Harry immediately froze and did his best to control his breathing, afraid that the smallest movement would set the dragon off again.
He decided to walk, the address October had given not being very far from his hotel. He turned up his collar against the night breeze. Shivering, Draco chided himself for not grabbing a coat. It was still winter, he couldn’t have thought it would be warm enough to go without. He hadn’t been thinking properly, at all. Then again, he supposed he could give himself a break. He’d only been escaping from the law due to a new and dangerous medical condition. He could be a bit scatterbrained due to his situation.
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy,” Minerva began, then paused, her lips pursed. “Lucius. Narcissa. Follow me, and quickly.”
“Oh no, dear, Charms are just fine for me, though I could use a slight hand with the pixies.” The… Oh, she picked
“Something’s bothering you, mate. Let it out.”
“Indeed it is. Your eyes, they have a golden shine to them they did not have a few days ago.” She wiped a few tears from his face using her thumbs. When had he started crying? “This will be your first change?”
You’re such an utter sap.
Harry was up in Sirius' old room, cleaning and snooping. The place was empty except for him, why shouldn't he poke around? The room was much as he'd seen it during the Horcrux hunt, with the same muggle posters spelled to the walls and tokens of his godfather's life littered about the room. There was just a lot more dust on it now.
“Ronald, you won’t be the one courting him,” Hermione said with a roll of her eyes.
Making sure he had everything on him, Harry stood quickly and hurried after the dragon, trying to keep a safe distance. “Hey—Hey, no, no, I need to make sure you’re okay.” Now the dragon was running, and looked like it was going to try to fly out of here. That was
You are a cruel, cruel man when you want to be, my love. I can only hope that you don’t purposely delay your reply… Please don’t? I’ll get on my knees… I promise to take you collar shopping. (Maybe I’ll end up getting onee, too, who’s to say.)
“Well. I think we ought to find it, don’t you?” She tied his hair after combing the potion through it and smiled at him, putting her hands on his shoulders. “Perfect. Now come, dear, “I believe I’ve found the perfect room for Draco, when he comes home.”
I've been telling you for ages now, you berk, that she'd adore you, and of course, it takes me being bitten and running away that gets you to see that. Ever the dramatic one, you are.
“I never said that Dumbledore was good, or perfect.”
Love always,
Your mum and Andy have been told of our engagement, so if you get a Howler (angry
"How, pray tell, am I silly, child?"
” Draco said with a sneer. This family was
In short, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy was a broken man. He would even come at Albus Dumbledore's beck and call if it meant escape from the prison he had once called home. They were lucky the Dark Lord was preoccupied and didn't much care if Lucius and Narcissa had a parent/teacher conference about their brat.
“A… what?” Draco narrowed his eyes at her, furrowing his brow is confusion.
“Harry. I’m his mother. I know everything.” What… What exactly did she
“Yeah. France. His mum is assuming Paris, but I’m not sure. We’re not going after him, though.”
A pinprick of white light appeared in the center of the room, in the center of the ghostly congregation. A hush fell over them all as they watched the light grow and shine steadily brighter. To an untrained eye, this light looked like a glowing Patronus charm, though it really looked more like a silver Obscurus.
Tears slid down Harry’s face, and he covered his mouth with the hand not holding the letter. Oh… He couldn’t imagine… His friend and partner was all alone, scared, and in pain— Draco had never sent a letter like this before. The raw emotion in it was almost uncharacteristic. “Harry dear, I- What is it? What’s happened? Is it Draco?” Narcissa was immediately on him, looking ready to snatch the letter from his hands.
The diadem. Of course it was in the Room of Requirement-- in the Room of Lost Things. Harry had hidden Snape's potion book there in 6th year, so he knew what to ask for as he paced outside in the hall.
“Draco Malfoy, that’s who. He’s got that whole dragon thing going on in his name, the pretentious git. He’s all pale like you are too. You could almost be a Malfoy actually, with that albino aesthetic you’ve got. I’ve never seen a dragon this pale before, it’s beautiful.”
Looking back over one of your previous letters, to properly address a point you made, no, I don’t believe that a Wolfsbane potion would help Teddy’s irritability. You’re only to take it on the day of the full moon, and he has those attitude adjustment for days after and leading up to the moon, doesn’t he? Just watch him on the full moon and make sure that nothing comes of it. If anything, we can see about giving him a smaller dosage if necessary, but I’d rather not give him potions if we don’t have to.
of the wrong things-
“Oh my, that won’t do at all. I have plenty of rooms here, you know, please come and stay. We can put up wards around your room, if you’d like—”
“Well, actually, I’m not all that hungry-”
Your Harry
“Yes. I think I’d like that,” he told her with a bob of his head, and a weak smile. She pulled him into a little half-side hug and gave him a light squeeze.
But what
“You got me a tall glass, I needed more sugar than usual to compensate. Yes, I’m done.”
He sat down at his desk and a piece of parchment appeared in front of him. Quill in-hand, he thought for only a moment or two before he began to write.
“Well, I mean… My magic seems like it’s stayed the same, really. If I’m emotional, yeah, it’s stronger, but I’m still pants at a few charms, and potions still isn’t my best. I didn’t think I had anymore powerful magic than the next guy.”
**A (smaller than Hogwarts) Russian school of magic that I had fun making up.  :) With ‘silovik’ meaning ‘elite’ and ‘izba’ meaning ‘log cabin’ in Russian, I like to think of it as a badass tight-knit school in eternal winter for badass witches and wizards. Think Illya Kuryakin, but with wandless magic.
And the would-be murderer of Fred Weasley fell down dead. He released George's wrist and fled the scene, looking for other foolhardy do-gooders to rescue from his fate. He couldn't bear all the death, couldn't bear the thought of more people becoming like him.
"Both of my children got their coming of age tokens from me, as did all my other nieces and nephews. And when their children grow to be seventeen, I will give each of them a pocket watch, a pair of earrings, or a pendant and chain. I apologize for being a few years late with yours, Draco."
She smiled, rubbing his arm. “I saw it, Harry.” He still didn’t understand what that was supposed to mean. She ‘saw’ it.
"Of course, my darling," she said, pulling him in close and kissing his cheeks-- two on each side, alternating. "I hope you are hungry, we have a feast planned." And she led him into the kitchen.
“They want us to have our wards and perimeters set up by six.”
“I beg to differ. I know plenty of men who would eat you with a spoon, looking like this.”
“Well he suggested a few lifestyle changes… eating better in general, plain foods in the morning so I don't feel sick… no more 12 hour shifts or being on-call 24 hours…”
"Now keep it there for the next 28 days." That had Harry giving a laugh-
"Sebastien Frey? Pardon me— I am October Roots." Definitely a wizarding name, if Draco ever heard one… but not Black. The waiter offered his hand for Draco to shake. Draco shook his hand, nodding his head.
Speaking of surprised, they both turned at the flapping sound of wings to see an owl coming into the dining room. “Wynter, what have you got, there?” The sleek barn owl landed on the armrest of Harry’s chair and Narcissa carefully untied the letter it carried from its leg. Harry smiled and gently pet the owl’s head as Narcissa broke the seal and began to read. It didn’t take long for her face to pale as she looked back up at Harry. “It’s from Draco. He’s in France.”
“No, I think not… though I’m certainly tempted to let you.” She looked over the letter again and tried to compose herself. “He tends to make the right decisions, he just needs time.”
“Might try heading out to the fields near the forest tomorrow,” Doonan said, that twinkle back in his beady eyes. “He’s got to be hiding, eh? Eighteen metres from snout to tail and hasn't mastered the change yet.”
“You lost more than most, it is easy to understand, when put in perspective.” She came a little closer, gingerly resting her hand on his shoulder. “In another life, I believe you would’ve been the happiest, most cared for boy in the world, and I do mean it literally. Your parents loved each other, and you, much more than a number of other people love their families. Not to mention the adoration of my cousin and Remus.” Harry’s shoulders shook and he sniffed, immediately trying to wipe at his face with his sleeve.
"You can still like something and find it interesting even if you don't necessarily have a need for it," Sapphire assured him with a tilt of her head.
Would you let me take you apart, Draco? Open you up with oil and my fingers the morning after the moon? I'd make you come twice before my cock got anywhere near your sweet arse. Before, I thought you’d want me on all fours at every opportunity, and maybe you do, but I’d bet anything you want me to take charge of you. Protect, comfort, cherish. I will, darling, I promise.
Draco made a face and shuddered. "Why on Earth would I have children? And how would I?" Once upon a time, he'd thought he'd have to marry Pansy to appease his parents, but he hadn't thought that since 5th year.
“But how
Yet again, Harry James Potter, you surprise me. Here I was, expecting you to be ready to play hardball, and now it seems that
“Yeah? You think so?” His expression was open, vulnerable. He might cry. Narcissa pulled him into a hug and ran her fingers through his curls.
to help him. I'll start working on animagus transformations— You don't have to be alone, I promise there are people you can run to. You don't have to run away and punish yourself.
Colin Creevy, as well as nearly a dozen other students were spared a gruesome and too-early death by Draco's assistance. All of them were unsure as to who-- or what-- saved them from a curse or fatal injury, speculating amongst themselves quietly… as the Boy Who Lived snuck out into the forest, under his father's invisibility cloak.
“Ronald Weasley, there is no way Draco has Harry under any love potions or compulsion spells—”
The salve flew over to him and he caught it, dipping his fingers into it. “Alright. This is going to be cold at first, but I promise, it’s gonna help you feel better.” He spread the salve across the joint and again the dragon hissed, but still remained fairly calm and docile beside him. This was so strange. “You wanna know another thing?
Draco, if I saw you in a collar with a leash, I think my heart would explode… that being said, the image hasn't left my mind in days. Perhaps that's why you're such a brat, you just need a firm hand, don't you? You'd be all sweet for me after I took you over my knee, or showed you who you belong to, wouldn't you darling?
He saw the moment the stunning spell did nothing.
Harry sighed, leaning back in his seat and sipping from his tea. “Not so good. Draco’s left the country.” To Harry’s surprise, Luna didn’t seem very shocked. She just sipped her tea and nodded, almost sage-like.
Everything is the same except moved up 10 years from canon. The Marauders were born in 1970, and Harry was born in 1990, which puts him at 28 years old, as this fic takes place in May of 2019.
“Leesy!” Narcissa called, voice a touch strangled. The crack of a house elf echoed through the entrance hall on the tail end of its name.
“Single use tickets, okay? You don’t have to keep them once you’ve gone through.” And she showed him where to put his ticket so the turnstiles would let him through.
colorful. It was bright pink with a multitude of swirls, sleeveless, and went to just above her knees. Harry imagined Luna would feel at home in it.
“But…” Draco looked back in the mirror again. “But I’m not…”
You’re such an utter sap.
"You sound like our daughter," Sapphire said, eyes twinkling. "Though I believe you'll be married long before she is."
“And look at those collar bones. Very nice.”
Also, I find myself needing a "ghostly name" for Draco, similar to 'Moaning Myrtle', 'Bloody Baron' etc.
have had all the answers.
"Of course, I quite enjoyed it, too. And you'll have to come see the watch before I've finished and returned it, it's simply beautiful. Original crystal facing, you know," he added, nudging Draco just a bit.
“There have been a few cases over the centuries, as you can imagine. A core specialist healer at St. Mungo’s could better answer any practical core questions, if you become concerned with your own. There
The dragon was snarling, and breathing fire on every other exhale, and was behaving very strangely, even for an angry dragon. He was twisting in on himself, contorting his body into the strangest positions, and almost looked as though he was in some kind of pain as well as being furious.
When he was finished, he allowed the ink to dry and fed the French owl some nice little meat trimmings he’d summoned from the kitchen. Ink dry and the letter sufficiently sealed, he tied the letter to the owl’s leg, also putting the customary few Sickles into the pouch at its other leg. “When you’re rested, take that back to Mrs. Roots, okay?” The owl cooed and rubbed against Harry’s cheek. Glad he liked him. Owls were incredibly good judges of characters, so it felt pretty good. Still, that Draco had talked about him to his new-found great aunt. And ‘fondly.’ Harry shook his head. Draco was a mysterious and puzzling man, and this just added to that persona.
Sapphire took another sip of her wine. “Has she mentioned anything about possible moon sensitivity? He’s growing up quickly, you know.”
Thank you for the chocolate. It’s fine here, but having it sent from home makes it taste sweeter.
“Didn’t think you and his mum were so chummy,” Ron said as he slipped into his seat beside Hermione.
That had him laughing and shaking his head. “I didn’t even know how to get to the kitchens until I was in fourth year, and by then… I liked other people cooking for me.”
“For the record, I was fine with him keeping his own last name, but he absolutely insisted. It took quite a bit of
be convinced —  Begging on your knees, you said?
“Winnie, m'dear, a pint for the dragon lad!” Doonan cried, before practically dragging Harry to a table, to the amusement of the other pub patrons. For such a thin man, he was quite strong. He fixed Harry with his dark gaze and steepled his long, knobby fingers. “Now, m'lad, what do ye need to know about the dragons?”
“That does sound amazing,” he told him, and before he knew it, he was being dragged along to lunch with the two of them. The three of them sat outside a little café, facing out towards the street. Remy ordered them each a sandwich and wine, though Draco protested slightly. He wasn't very hungry… until the gorgeous ham and butter baguette was set in front of him with a crisp white wine. Sniffing the wine, he smiled at realizing that it wasn’t nearly so overpowering as it had been a couple weeks ago. “Pinot gris?”
“Dragons?! Well I'll tell ye boy, we've seen ‘em—!” A grizzled man suddenly seemed to appear next to Harry, dark eyes wide and sparkling with excitement. He seemed to be missing a tooth or two, and his clothes seemed to reflect a forest camouflage. Harry suspected he didn't bathe often.
P.S. I like it too. Quite a bit.
Harry,
“Before Hogwarts, then. I imagine the castle elves would have protested if you’d tried to make a fry up in the school kitchens.”
He fucking hoped they had. That might make it all worth it, if his parents made it out of this war unharmed, alive, and out of the Dark Lord's clutches. He can only hope that's the case.
“My lovely son Derrick and his wonderful wife Ametrine.” Ametrine he’d already met, the woman with the purple braid- And now it was a bright fiery red? She was a metamorphmagus? He slowly turned his eyes to Derrick, who only grinned at him, dark curls falling in front of his eyes.
“Wonderful! We will see you at seven! Now, what can I get for you? You came here to eat, after all, non?”
P.S. You’re not getting this shirt back. Simply for the fact it’s comfortable. Nothing else.
“Let me see-- He was a Slytherin! Merlin, Ron, he graduated the year before you all started! Merlin— He’s the same year as Charlie!” Ginny was absolutely gobsmacked. Ron made eye contact with his wife.
-Harry Potter is as magical as he normally is.... but the Fab 5 are also wizards! :0 the only one who has an idea of who Harry is is Tan (British Desi Wizard Bros)
Draco frowned, looking down at himself. “What?” He was dressed perfectly fine.
"Oh yes," Gwendolyn agreed. "I've seen so many beautifully crafted pieces through the years, some bonding sets that have been in families since before the Revolution. Absolutely gorgeous. Of course, rings are the most popular now, as my daughter could probably tell you."
that nothing had happened since The Incident. He sat down at his desk and began to craft his response.
But not this dragon, it seemed.
“Oh, Mr. Potter, please, you simply must visit your friend,” another nurse said from across the hall.
Thank you to everyone who suggested ghostly names for Draco, as I finally got to use them in this chapter.
Just imagining it in my mind, I cringe at what that bedroom may look like. Be a lamb, and try to convince him to settle on two colors? I'm thinking purple for the walls, something like a wisteria, gentle and muted, and he can have his Tiffany for the trimmings. Yes, I do know it, however I prefer a soft blue topaz. It brings out my eyes. You'd best warn him, Pansy and Blaise both have attested to the fact I'm a cuddler. I won't let go of him so easily once he's in my grasp.
-also they don't treat him like a celebrity? cos they don't know the stuff he's done? and he likes how normal they're treating him?
Harry was shocked. In fact, shocked didn’t even begin to adequately describe what he was thinking or feeling. A long-lost great aunt not only knew that Draco was a werewolf, but was saying Draco loved him. And Harry would be damned if she thought this was at all his fault that they weren’t together. Fuck, he had to write back to her. He had to make sure that Draco’s family knew that it wasn’t
“Now… how do we get Harry to agree?” Ginny and Ron share a semi-guilty look.
Harry gaped as Narcissa gently ran her hands through his hair. "So my-- someone in my family created it?" Did they create it for their own family use? There was so much he didn't know.
“So, dear… I’ve made a few changes to the upstairs bedroom.” Oh, right. Narcissa had put herself in the upstairs.
“Oh— wow—“
“Easy to understand, darling. My mother could probably count on two hands the number of times she’d stepped foot in a kitchen in her entire life. Andromeda and I liked to sneak down and watch the house elves work, so I know quite a bit in theory, but Andy is the one that put the knowledge to good use.”
this dragon? “Hey, you alright, there?” He reached out and smoothed the soft underbelly of the dragon, watching it start to relax. “You are a weird one. I’ve never met a dragon like you,” he said quietly.
“I think it would be best if this stayed between us. The rest of the school, I don't believe they need to know of Draco's suicide. You could simply say you pulled him from Hogwarts, transferred him to another school.” The only place they would be transferring Draco was to the grave.
Draco was still silent. Harry watched him walk slowly round the clearing, letting him take some time, waiting for him to feel ready to talk.
Draco Malfoy
It was actually fairly relaxing, to take a nice hike through the woods. He’d kept himself busy with work, and most of the time, hiking in a forest reminded him of the war, but this was a bit different. Probably because it was spring, just starting to go into summer. Everything felt more alive, like the world had finally realized everything was okay. Harry stopped at the top of a hill and took a deep breath. It was freeing.
Death Eaters. A dozen of them. Some Harry recognized-- Bellatrix, Greyback, Dolohov. Snape led them up the stairs and Harry wanted to scream, but Dumbledore's spells kept him silent.
If you do achieve the transformation, I’d appreciate a picture.
Chapter 4 will be up soon, hopefully. Please give kudos and comment if you're enjoying it!
Charlie slowly nodded. “I had seen the dragon while I was romping out near Salisbury. I was gonna make it a surprise to the family that I was back, but I decided to get in a good hike first. Then I spotted just a dragon right in the middle of the forest, not far off the trail. Of course I wanted to help the poor thing. Seemed terrified out of its wits, confused—you know how they can be.”
The thought made him unwillingly shake. He now was intensely aware of the phase of the moon, despite not being able to see it in the sky. If there'd been any doubt in his mind that that bite had truly turned him, it was gone now. Trying to calm himself, Draco dipped his quill in the ink pot to begin writing his return letter.
to be surrogates for her and Ginevra. As it is, we need to worry about my own and Teddy’s condition before we begin to consider possible offspring that it would be passed down to.
“Just going on holiday, Lyn.” He walked over to her, both forms in hand. “Draco wanted me to bring you his, too.”
Soft light filtered into the entry hall of Chateau Malfoy. It was beautiful in the Loire Valley this time of year, but neither Lucius nor Narcissa noticed. They were still in a daze, despite the body of their son levitating about two feet from the carpeted stone floor. They could not grieve yet-- they had plans to make, as quickly as could be made. They could not return to their home in Wiltshire, and it was risky to stay at the Chateau for too long. France was simply too close to the action, to the danger. They would have to move.
“Hmm, yes. Imagine if they tried to use alliteration.” The older ghost chuckles quietly. “Your name doesn't really lend itself well to that.”
I'd like to see your face for our first time. I'd move you to our bed and spread you out over the sheets. I'd kiss your cheek as I push in, I want to hear all your sweet sounds. I'd just hold myself there, pushed deep inside you, try to memorize the feeling, even as you work your hips to try and get me to move. I don't know yet how I'd fuck you, Draco. Slow and steady? Every thrust deep and purposeful? Fast and hard and filthy? I'll decide in the heat of the moment I suppose. I'll make sure you're more than ready to take it, and I promise I'll more than satisfy you, my love.
“You know? It’s funny… I’m trying to imagine my life without him in it… and I can’t seem to do it. I definitely don’t think I could continue being an Auror if he wasn’t my partner.” And already Harry knew that Draco probably couldn’t return to the force. As understanding and accommodating as Robards and Ron were… plenty of people would raise issues with a werewolf in the Aurors, even with all the progressive creatures’ rights bills that Hermione was putting up in the Wizengamot.
Draco shook his head. “I’m afraid I don’t understand. Why would you care so much?”
P.S. Save a pair of pyjama bottoms for me, will you? I'd like to have a complete outfit.
“Um, well, there’s something else I’ve got to tell you guys… concerning this whole thing.” He cleared his throat and looked between his two best friends. “...I’m going to court him. If he lets me.”
