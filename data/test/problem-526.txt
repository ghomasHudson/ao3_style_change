“Yes!” she gasped, half-laughing and falling away to sag against a rocky outcropping. “Quite. It’s more properly Me, of course. The One. But of course the feeling of Creation is very strong indeed here. And likely this One was indeed a female-feeling person.”
person we'd expect to see you going about with. To Hogsmeade, I mean." She shrugged but not terribly apologetically. "It's only natural, Harry. Really."
"Oh, you fool!" Harry told the wind, grinning like a loon. "Just wait half a tick—I'll be there, I swear. Idiot!"
Harry startled and there was something bout him that seemed to presage him leaving. Just going off, if Draco did not. Draco snarled at it, fair warning, and was across the distance that separated them in a twinkling, finally breathing freely as he moved, puffing and huffing and snorting. Breathing
"Um—um, really, mate?" Weaselbee had found his tongue at long last but was redder than any conceivable shade of red in the normal spectrum. He'd steam issuing from his ears, practically, and he was swallowing hard, and so often his Adam's apple bobbed like one of those floats on a fishing pole. "Must—
Draco scowled, shaking his head, uncaring his stupid fringe was in his eyes. He scrubbed a hand through impatiently, blinking fast.
Draco sat forward in abrupt movement, alarmed. Harry fidgeted with his wand, twirling it nervously and not quite meeting Draco's eyes, a clear sign from olden days that he was working up to telling Draco something upsetting.
goblet, emitting horrid slurping noises.  Distinctly erotic noises, too, like those in a third-rate porn flick.
“Whoa!” Draco exclaimed, emitting an appreciative shriek of a whistle through his clamped teeth. “Now that’s—that takes bloody
Harry snorted, in part because Malfoy was a great long git and was crushing him and in larger part because Malfoy
"Ummm…" Harry hummed, all obvious, as if entirely unaware Draco was nearing a dangerous state of implosion, flinging his jangling keys towards the bowl by the Floo pot table. Draco refrained from glaring holes in the clumsy git when they missed it completely and skittered nosily across the floor, as he so wished to do.
Draco gestured 'round, indicating the scattering of expensive artistic porcelain doodads, preserved floral arrangements, assorted artwork displayed on the pale damask walls and the gleaming furniture, all dark cherry wood and carven runic symbols, which called out the intricately lush carpet under their feet rather beautifully. It framed Potter too, and seemed to somehow suit him.
“It’s a casserole, git,” Harry smiled widely, all glinting eyes and canines. “What?” He blinked slowly at Draco, as if he were as innocent as the July days were long. “Did you think I’d cooked something willingly? Oh, no. Kreacher just goes on with sending them over and I just go one with casting reheating spells them when you’re not paying attention."
"If you must know, Potter, I've grown tired of him poaching on my territory!" Draco hissed quietly, whipping his jaw around, just to firm it in Potter's direction, two tattletale spots of scarlet blooming high up on his chiseled cheekbones. "Tell him to go get his own S.O. and I'll drop the idea entirely, alright? We can play something else."
manage to clue in eventually, you know. Auroring will suit me to a tee, thanks, so bugger off about my career. But…you were saying?"
“Gods, how I hate you,” Harry informed him out the side of his mouth, under cover of the sporadic clapping. “Like I hate peeling shrivelfigs, Ron. That much!”
Author's Notes: I've taken liberties with Draco's ancestry. He has a Veela grandmother now and a French one at that! Oh, and Harry's not an idiot, either. The rest is to kitty_fic* 's prompt, which was so unbearably fun I wrote her a treatise!
He and Harry might even be able to duck Father's inevitable fury, simply invoking a solid shield of Malfoy nappies. A bit of appeasement for the old git, perhaps? A diversion, at the least.
Snogging as if he would die if he didn't, Harry proceeded to halt all the silly thoughts and notions occupying Draco Malfoy's whirling head.
, you damned Death Eater!" Weasley snarled, his hand back on his wand again, but Harry was right there, stuffing him back in his hole.
"I say, Potter, I said 'let's play a game'," Draco drawled again, with a tad more emphasis, and Harry Potter, ere long the acknowledged rival of the House of Malfoy, at last bothered to glance up from his Ogden's. "Now, please. This is stultifying. I shall expire shortly. Save me."
"And Longbottom will fall upon the Sword of Gryffindor in a fit of wounded pique—I know, I know, Potter," Malfoy groused. "I've heard your reasons before; they still don't impress me."
wasn’t bored—far from it! Potter’s arm seemed to stretch out fantastically long! Must be Magic! “Don’t let it get away from you, Potter! Catch it—
Draco, a perplexed and befuddled young Wizard, returned her approving stare for a long moment before dropping his chin and balefully regarding his own long legs, crossed at the ankles demurely. He was, he decided, experiencing a high degree of mortification. Mum was actually taking a personal interest in his unconventional light o' love, an act of kindness no normally frosty Malfoy matron would even remotely consider—but then, hadn't it been demonstrated that neither he nor his redoubtable Mum were 'normal' Malfoys?
“Uh...um. Work?” He shifted his trembling forefinger to point out the report form Draco had been contemplating so thoughtfully when he entered the office. "That there?" It was nearly finished, from what he could discern. Just a few more moments, perhaps, and then he’d be free to scarper. “We should finish that.”
Harry blushed and let himself be drawn nearer, almost knocking his half-cold mug of cocoa over in the process. Draco's grasp slipped up his forearm to his collarbone, fingers gripping strongly, only to snake through and round to his back, dodging right in the warm sweaty space between Harry's upper arm and his perspiring—gosh, but he'd been
Ron moved terribly suddenly, straightening up like a shot, so fast he practically cracked the vertebrae in his neck, nodding as he was fiercely in agreement with Granger: a furious motion, whilst chomping his back teeth down in a nasty sort of snort. His hair wafted and ruffled in result of his motion, a jaunty blaze of colour in a room left soullessly dull.
Draco assented with alacrity, rising gracefully to his feet and feeling quite pleased and relieved. He smoothed down his robes and smiled kindly at Harry's obvious relief. This plan suited his own requirements to a ‘T’, and much more so than being forced to spill his silly Manor's sordid little secrets here in the inner fastnesses of the Ministry, at Potter's place of business.  No need to cajole Harry away from the Ministry before times, either, nor any cause to make an utter fool of himself describing what was really no more and no less than a temporary aberration in his own living arrangements. And Harry, it seemed, required his old school mate's aid and assistance, something Draco was frightfully chuffed to provide.
Shaking his head to clear it, Harry settled back down to his work.  A peaceful quiet quickly descended with Millie's exit for the Department of Mysteries was still mostly deserted. Even Unspeakables had to sleep sometimes, Harry knew, and half six in the morning was generally dead quiet. Which was exactly why Harry loved it so much, really.
attention—if it couldn't be Malfoy, at least let it be a person who cared for him, willing to hear him air out all his venting of emotional doldrums! "I'm not convinced I've lost, Hermione! I just don't believe I can win. That's different! Not at all the same thing!"
“Yes!” Ichika-san shouted, a sudden gust making her bounce up and down. Yet her wand remained steady and aligned, as did Harry’s. The tip of Luna’s wand had apparently caught fire: a halo of brilliantly white light coruscated from it, the shimmer would’ve been blinding without their protective eye-gear. “Youi!”
It was a decided pleasure, really, to be no longer in residence. And the homesickness he’d dreaded feeling had completely failed to materialize.
"Come now, Draco, darling!" Narcissa squared her shoulders, apparenly taking it upon herself to jolly her son out his fit of nervous sulks. "Did you not ever consider that I might wonder? It's been years now, my sweet, you've been talking up your precious Potter. Years."
Above all, Draco was sincere. Slytherins could be, when it was important. Look at Pansy: she’d sincerely apologised to the git for trying to rat him out to the Dark Lord and had been forgiven, the bint. Before everyone on the whole Great Hall, too. It had been very impressive and touching.
"Coo-ee!" his mum called out suddenly, startling him. "You look a bit at sea, Draco. Did you hear what I just said? You will contact Harry, won't you? I realize it's been a long time for you two, darling, but I'm sure it's only that he's just been re-assigned. I hardly imagine he'd slight you, my sweet."
No! Harry couldn't be that lucky—besides, Malfoy was to marry! He'd been told all about it and from the mouth of Ginny Weasley, no less!
There was no purchase to be had; nothing to thrust against. It was freefall entirely, excepting the perpetual centrifugal spin. And that was harsh and quite sadomasochistic—and alarmingly excellent fun.
There seemed to be no arguing that statement; Harry felt horrid, knowing he'd willfully argued himself into a blind corner. One even Hermione admitted existed.
“Indeed. I shall be frightfully honoured, Potter, to accept your so gracious invitation to dine. So, the usual time? The usual wine? Swill, rather.”
He yanked at Draco’s elbow again, but subtly, edging the two of them well out of the arc of the double doors. With a final quiet snick of an unseen lock they completed their motion, leaving Harry and Draco safely outside.
. He thrust his hand out blindly after, seeking Draco's thin wrist. Seeking to call them back, but too late. His mouth had run away with him; joined a fucking circus.
"Go on, Draco," Zabini peered at his fellow ex-Slytherin. "Do tell. I care about what you're saying, even no one else does," he mocked.
can--and do." He turned pleading eyes to his best mate. "So, anything to give us on that front, Hermione? Thoughts? Suggestions? Solutions? Since it’s both of us now and it's crystal we're a bit fucked, currently.”
“…Urgh!” Ron popped his head over the massive metal toast rack, chewing furiously and peering at Harry as he’d developed two heads, without prior warning to the dailies. “Lake water, eh, mate? That’s—that’s bloody poetical, Harry.  Daft, but poetical.”
"No! Hermione said to make you listen, Harry, if I must. I'm not about to Pretrificus you, so…please. Please?"
"They are not!" Weasley started—and shut up when Parkinson pecked his nose. "Er. They're not, that's all."
"What?" Draco was momentarily taken aback...until he saw the sparkle in Potter's eyes and his exceptionally sharp ears caught the faint murmur of a student body gathering up its mass to move towards dinner.
Draco was trying out a slightly different tact. More…open, and, erm, honest. Likely Potter didn’t care what Draco was planning for the future, but Draco had felt the pressing urge to inform him anyway. Potter should know he wasn’t planning on fading into the woodwork. He’d be around and about, and likely snag a decent position at the Ministry after graduation, given his marks. They’d see one another again—likely often, too—in the misty future. They should attempt to be at least…social. Civil, even.
! Draco exulted, and then caught himself mid-inner chortle, for Potter was a wanted man, as was he—oh, Salazar, as was
"Yeah, what'd you have in mind, Malfoy?" Ron chimed in, sneering. "Another of your marvelous pranks?"
But his heart fell slightly in his chest, a peculiar sensation. It wasn't gloves this year. It wasn't a picture frame or tickets to the Magpies or anything like. Three years, right? He couldn't very well give that sort of thing to Draco, not again. Shoddy stuff for three years.
, git," he admitted hastily. "Of course, yours. Obviously—not that you need to make so much of it. Come along, then—we're leaving. I'm a frigging mess, Harry, and it's all your fault. I want to be clean again, if that's not too much to ask."
“No, really. Watch yourself, Potter!” Draco snapped, lurching away. “And the fuck I do. You’re the one who wants to talk about your work and you’re the one who bloody well can’t. Well, make  yourself accustomed to that fact of life right smart, will you? All closed up like a bloody fucking clamshell and by your own choice, Potter. Maybe even have a little think about whether that’s why you’ve not had a single meaningful relationship since you started at DoM!”
"Don't play the fool, Harry," Draco muttered, biting at Harry's bared earlobe. His was a dark, nasty growl, one that sent chills straight up Harry's spine. "You know as well as I do what you've gone and done just now. You've changed everything.
“Because I sat proxy in several of your courses--remember? I do take in things, now and again, and sometimes they even stick with me.” Draco rolled his eyes again, but fondly. “Now, look, here’s the plan. Something stupidly simple and powerful, Potter. That’s what I want you to cast. That’s what you do best, isn’t it? Oh, no, here it is!”
Granger's bright gaze slid over to Draco's face before she turned away for the final time and for a second he felt much as he had when Aunt Bellatrix was teaching him Occulomancy: like a beetle pinned to wall by tiny poisonous darts. It was quite clear to him then that she trusted him not at all and it was only Harry's specific request that kept her from hexing him quite as nastily as Weasley git so obviously wished to.
Harry didn't bother to lift his wand, though, nor shift on his feet at the ready for casting, nor indicate in any way he was planning next to physically wrestle Draco out the door of Grimmauld. He only waited, grim-eyed, head tilted a bit enquiringly. As if he truly didn't understand why Draco wasn't already history, wasn't already long gone. As if…the fire had burnt right out him, leaving only nothing.
I’ll have to kill Finnegan and that’ll be a shame, won’t it? I’ve managed to stay out of gaol thus far—be a sodding pity to end up there now.”
“Yes, of course. I’m sorry, alright?” Harry replied in a low mutter, instantly glancing off elsewhere. “Look, I just...I couldn't sleep," he informed Draco's reading lamp with a fretful scowl. "Thinking of how we rowed, literally over nothing, not a bleeding thing, and it felt hateful. Gut in knots, head aching, all that. I didn’t want you to wake up tomorrow morning and believe I was still vexed with you--or think you should be with me, either. It upset me, and the more I fretted over it, the more it did. That’s all.” He gave his head a little shake, his mop of hair shimmering blue-black in the golden light, and glanced back at Draco from beneath his ridiculous eyelashes. “Um.
The smile was positively terrifying; what did she know that he didn't? His Mum only blinked at him sweetly.
This was growing old, Harry decided. Ron was in terrible form this morning; Hermione must have wrung him completely dry last night.  His brain was clearly absent.
"Ahhhh…." Weasley sighed Draco's way, a long exhale of stymied tension releasing that had him flapping a hand pointlessly, gesturing acceptance of the bloodlessly sane judgment his girlfriend had brought low upon their hapless host. Hermione caught the hand, clasped it and glared at Draco hard enough for the both of them, all business, brown eyes sparkling challenge.
"Ahem," an elderly Wizard cleared his throat, and quite abruptly appeared on the other side of the case. "I'd wager you boys are in need of my assistance now, correct?"
who caused Harry far more trouble now, well after all the hostilities had formally ceased between them, than he'd ever managed in all their long-shared history, how he would laugh his arse silly! Or howl—or snort—or whatever action the sexy git performed when he was truly amused. Harry wouldn't know, naturally; he'd never witnessed that. Never bothered and now Malfoy was quite the serious studious git and didn't laugh. Much. Well…he smirked still, but he wouldn't be Malfoy if he didn't. And not nearly as attractive, either.
"Y-Yes," Draco swallowed, blinking rapidly, vaguely aware his Mum had asked of him several questions recently. What exactly they were didn't matter—he'd been too busy musing to pay heed, so he'd have to simply wing his response and hope she'd be satisfied. Because, knowing his Mum, he wasn't likely to obtain what he wanted without first making her happy. "Yes, well, it's not been particularly easy, Mum, all of this. Very—very unexpected. And, erm, yes, we've—we've engaged in a—in some mutual expression of affections—not public, mind you!—and, and truly, Mum, I must allow I do find it still a bit unbelievable that he, of all possible people, is the one—" That tumbled out of Draco's mouth, quite unexpectedly. "That I—that I, ah…have come to regard so highly."
“Oh, it is, believe me,” Harry exclaimed fervently, whirling about. He galloped back to Draco and grasped his forearm, his wine glass and the bottles finally--thankfully--cast aside and sloshing along merrily behind him.
It was a damned long time, subjectively, with not even an Owl or a floo call to break up the monotony. Very awkward, yes.
Hermione, the traitor, giggled softly. Her eyes even a glazed over a bit as she watched Ron’s nimble tongue moving down the shaft of his sausage. Harry flinched miserably and turned pleading eyes to her.
“Pshh,” Harry said, ushering Draco into Grimmauld’s ornate dining room with a smirk. “Tosh. I suppose it’s alright.”
“Uncalled for?” Harry shrieked, eyes wild and rolling far back in his head. He sneered, or rather, manfully attempted to, managing only to look even more absurd in his sodden state. “How dare you say that? You, of all people? You haven’t bloody kissed me in bloody years, Malfoy; why in blessed, blasted fuck would you do it
But the Manor Floo didn't vouchsafe an answer, being firmly shut behind him, and all Draco was left with was a small velvet covered box and the memory of his Mum's weirdly twinkling gaze.
More in his throat, like, the movement of the word ‘stay’. Or maybe it was a combination of specific lip movements, like verbal Braille. He only knew he kissed the bunch-pursed-lips-tongue-tip-to-teeth- and-open-mouth action of  that one betraying word smack dab onto the inviting plane of Draco’s shoulder, like an invisible brand—or a tattoo only he could see. The shoulder was just there; strong, cream and taut; It was there and he was compelled to kiss it, so…might as well, right? After, there was a faint smear of his lips left behind, where he’d wetted them first, licking them lasciviously over Draco.
There were, after all, other 'trendy hotspots' available just off Diagon. And it wouldn't be the first establishment they'd been tossed out of, either.
"Lightning Strikes Events, Ltd.," Draco replied dryly. He'd found the name of the establishment most fitting, given the circumstances. "Those last are for Beltane Betrothal Ceremony I've planned, though. Naturally, I'll need the other order—the 'Love Speaks' posy— delivered immediately, as soon as it's made up, and then the same again for every day between now and—"
. But, ah, why’re you ‘observing’ Malfoy’s hair, exactly?” Shouldn’t you be looking for, erm, suspicious behaviour or something like—like in Sixth Year, Harry?”
over, and Harry knowing Draco as Draco knowing Harry—it wouldn't be, couldn't be—not ever. And this was a damned fine thing, all 'round, as likely next time it would be him, Harry, storming out stiff-rumped and Draco trotting after, bleating 'Harry! Harry!' and looking a bit too bereft for even maybe Ron to bear watching.
It may have been a sodding silly thing to do, asking Potter to walk out with him under the noses of his disapproving Housemates and those of Potter's—the entire school's, really—but he'd gone and done it and now there was nothing left but to stand by what he'd done. Draco had not been raised to go back on his word. Ever.
"Well…" Hermione grinned at her book slyly, "no argument there, at least. Carry on, then; it's your funeral."
Harry, instead of properly standing still and receiving Draco's proposal, dropped to his knees too, all at once, like a sack of potatoes. He gaped up at Draco's sincere snarl, his eyes very wide, wider than Draco had ever seen them, and so full of love Draco choked, mid-threat.
"Good," Potter still seemed a bit narrow-eyed and untrusting, but Draco ignored it. "It's settled then," Potter went on. "When should we meet?"
“Keep mum, will you? I don't want it--them--to hear you right now, Potter! It’ll make it even worse!”
"Oh, la, lovie!" His Mum tinkled her signature titter—with a decided middle-aged ladylike leer tossed in for good measure; Draco shuddered grimly hearing it, his toes curling in fright. "You do wish to spoil all my fun, don't you? But very well, my dearest; I'll save all my questions for another time, when we may be leisurely over it—provided, of course, you bring your young man to visit me, Draco?" She cocked an imperious eyebrow at him. "As I'm positive the family portraits would also appreciate a gander at your Harry, son, if he's to be one of us."
. You're not like this, Harry. You-just tell me, alright? Will you just say it? What can I do to…how can I ever…ever? Because this can't go on, not like this. I can't go on. I'm lost without you, Harry. I'm…lost. Fucking well
Leaving Draco go as abruptly as he'd so tightly hugged him, Potter fell back a pace, grinning like a maniac, and look vastly pleased with life entire.
…And finally a last pathetic little 'creak!', as the work table's overstrained legs splintered fractionally about the joints, trickling sawdust.
But not Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy was highly resistant. Too, he had a plan, he did, and he was very fit and healthy—his mental mirror had said so.
Lovegood smiled to herself and waved her wand discreetly. The bear jerked just a tiny bit and then patted Nev's back very kindly with a soft plush paw, murmuring sweet things. Longbottom looked very startled all the sudden.
“Mind!” Draco barked, catching Harry by the shoulder in a strong one-handed grip, just in time to prevent him from tipping sideways. “Idiot. Merlin, you were, weren’t you? Trying it on with me, acting as if nothing worth fussing about with had happened, you sneaky git!” he hissed, glaring and righting Harry on his seat with a gentle shove on the bicep. "Unconscionable!" He pulled back, standing up tall and straight with an irritated huff. “I swear, Potty-head, one day I really am going to--”
Harry scowled down at the crinkled eyelids and the shoulder turned toward him. Draco abruptly rolled neatly away, grunting and taking nearly all the quilt with him.
“Fine, fine! Cheers, Hermione,” Harry allowed, lips twitching. "I wasn't, you know. Doing that. Not five, and not a spoilt brat, either. Not like some I know." He toasted her, sending Draco a teasing glance. "But still. To you too, Malfoy, for showing willing to give up the Manor. At least for a little while.”
but a parental shite-storm, just as Potter had predicted would occur (showing a horrid sneaky Slytherin prescience). The prideful part of Draco planned to murder the knowing little sot simply for being so dreadfully knowing, as soon as his father finished flaying him raw where he knelt, taking the brunt of it.
,” Draco said fiercely, shrugging off the scold with all the ease of a legacy Slytherin. “It’s terribly similar to what’s going on Grimmauld. In fact, the Manor’s gone and lost its freaky incorporeal mind with this bloody 'Draco-have-a-baby' business."
“What? No! I’m not mad,” Harry had the nerve to deny, and even looked mildly puzzled at Draco’s perfectly reasonable accusation. “Why would you say that?”
Looking about him with a derisive eye, Draco let go of Harry's hand—or tried to. "So, why here, Potter, of all places? Surely, there are shops in London you could patronize—"
!" Draco snarled darkly, glaring for all he was worth. "This means the papers and confronting my parents and your bloody interfering mates and everyone we know—did you even think, Potter? About what you were doing, putting me on the spot? I could kill you now, you know, and the court would acquit me. Crime of passion, they'd call it, and I'd go scot-free!"
"Didn't we do that already?" Longbottom wanted to know. He was snuggled up against the oversized stuffed teddy bear Harry had won at the recent Hogsmeade Merchant's First Annual Street Fair, and he had that frighteningly familiar needy look in his soulful eyes, the one that always lead to the knowledgeable Eighth and Seventh Years diving for cover. "Sounds awfully like—"
assured me your father won't be an issue. Some last minute business jaunt to Argentina he had already scheduled, I think? Pity he'll miss the Bonding itself but I find I can't mind that too much. We never did get along, he and I."
"Hah!" Draco snorted, waving that off. "A pox on your constant threats of violence to mine person, Master Archmage. Note how I am still actively breathing despite all your many threats to off me, over all these many years. Not scared, Potty. Not a bit of it. You've not killed me yet. Nor I you."
He finally snatched his hand back, only to throw his arms up in the air in exasperation, nearly clipping Draco across the side of the head in passing.
." It was a hateful word, tumbling from Harry's mouth, all 'esses' and spite, and Draco watched them move around it, fascinated unwillingly. "I won't 'come on', not anywhere, not ever, not with you. I owe you nothing, Malfoy. Nothing. Go. Away!"
, Harry. Try it. Use Legilmens. Go inside me, go inside my brain. Everything, anything you want—I don't care. I want you to. Just….just see."
"Hardly!" Draco scoffed at them, scowling. "As if, Weaselbee. No, I'm here because you two are total nit—"
“Merlin! Of course I say so! Git’s bloody fantastic!” Draco wasn’t minding them at all—nor the fascinated, vaguely appalled look registering on his two mates’ carefully bland Slytherin features. Potter had once again shot straight up in a tight spiral, and the Snitch was lingering—feinting now left and now right, just between the prat’s gloved fingertips! The crowded stands were in the midst of going positively mental in their overwhelming excitement, hooting and tossing objects into the air, which did nothing at all to hide Draco’s loud shriek of encouragement.
Well, too, it proved he’d a nasty mind, one firmly stuck in the mucky gutter, and a facile tongue to match—and he’d love the chance to use it to impress Draco, this very morning. ‘Stay’ he’d say—just had, oops!—and Draco would, and then Draco would listen.
Clearly startled by Draco's interruption but beaming full-face and ever so brightly nonetheless, like a very messy-headed beacon, Potter popped up to his feet, rising like Venus on the proverbial from the mountainous miscellaney of papery ephemera, all strewn across the surface of an impressively gold-embossed leather blotter.
"Harry!" Draco threw himself forward, his person functioning instinctively, all parts clamping down, clinging, entangling the two them together in any way he could manage. "Harry, don't you dare lea—"
And he and Draco ate each other's tonsils with fragile abandon right there in full view of the restaurant's occupants; exchanged wordless murmurs ("Didn't mean to—', 'Would never have let you!', 'Fucking love you, you wanker!') and moist reminders of why, exactly, it never, ever ended. Harry snogged the smirk—maybe it was still a bit wobbly 'round the edges, yes, but delightfully present and accounted for—and thanked his lucky stars he understood that, without telling. Well…only the occasional telling. Reminders—that was it, what these were. These little blips in his happy existence.
“Yes, dear,” Draco laughed. “Unspeakables are known for their utter meanness and ruthless behaviour. Especially the Runes sort. It’s all due to their constant study of stone scratchings and mineral lumps--really toughens a person up, being ‘round all those rocks. Quite inflexible, your sort.”
odd? You're the one toting out spells from the bloody Dark Ages in DADA, Malfoy—and you're the one who wanted us to brew Amortentia for our Potions project! That's fucking odd, if you ask me! What in the blazes are you planning to do with that? Dose your little Slytherin slut of a fiancée?"
"…Yes." Draco finally-finally—raised his chin; met Harry's searching stare. "Together, then, Potter." He quirked his lips wryly. "The suspense is killing me, you know? What is it this year—another tome on Potions? Broom care kit, maybe."
"Three fucking lousy little words, Potter, and you do me in, just like that," Draco growled, his boney hips budging insistently at Harry's thighs, forcing them to part. "Fucking derail all my good intentions—turn me bloody inside out. I do hate you for it, Harry—never doubt it. I hate you so, so much—always have."
And he’d likely employ all his mythical would’ve-been prowess for the sole purpose of forcing Draco to
, you tit!' blowjob in Harry's mate's flat's hall closet—and Harry Potter, naïve git, had fallen into Draco's arms like a ripe plum from the bushes.
He Summoned one. It floated about their heads, a neatly pressed and monogrammed offering to good manners. Harry simply stared blankly at it, red-eyed and silent, stone still as if Draco had Petrificus'd him instead of only shouting a little and providing the git a chance to blow his snotty nose.
"Hush," Draco scowled over his shoulder. "I do say so and it's worth a damn good go. Come on, will you?"
“Three,” Hermione continued entirely unfazed, though she quirked a quizzical brow at Harry’s hissing, “this an unusual situation in and of itself, what with the sort of Magical sentience we’re encountering here making itself known so overtly. It’s extreme, abnormally so. Draco’s correct, I think; it’s an Ancient Magic at work, insidious and deep. I’ve no doubt in my mind at all that previous generations who’ve dwelt at Malfoy Manor and Grimmauld Place have never even questioned to what degree they were influenced by their homes when they made their personal choices as to whether to have children--or not. They just sort of did it, went with the flow, and didn’t suffer any existential crises about being manipulated by a smart stack of brick-and-mortar--”
“Oi, Potter?” Draco called out, raising his voice and moving at a leisurely pace towards the open door to the central corridor. "Bit rude of you, isn't it? Abandoning me like this. Potter!"
"Now, now," Harry murmured, and deftly edged his rival yet closer to him by slipping an arm 'round his tense shoulders. A gentle patting did much to ease the knots in Malfoy's nape. "No need to be tetchy. I'm over that very short phase in my life—I swear."
“Hmmm,” his mother hummed soothingly, maddeningly nonchalant and waving off his question with a careless flutter of fingertips. “Maybe, maybe not; who is to know with Harry, yes? He's made for a perfectly adequate godfather all these years.”
It was more that...it happened to have not happened yet, all those decision-and-choices-and sometimes sheer dumb luck events, all those necessary steps that led up to such a momentous, life-changing event, and Draco really didn't appreciate being rushed into it by his own fucking house. None of that had happened, and Draco was perfectly fine with it. He didn’t--and he informed his Manor of this in no uncertain terms--feel the lack.
"On the thirty-second tier, Mr. Malfoy, I was envisioning a recreation of Mr. Potter's TriWizard Tournament bout with the Horned—Horned—"
The eyes of both Gryffindors swiveled to exam the bed. Draco noticed Weasley had developed a sudden facial tic and Granger seemed to be swaying, as if caught in a strong wind.
"Umm," Harry sighed as two fingers roughly twisted into him, as Draco didn't wait for a reply. They knocked up against his quivering prostate almost immediately and he jolted into an arch of sheer bliss. "Umm, yessss…that's—that's brilliant! That would be—precisely—brilliant, Draco!"
“Not so many good ones, back then,” Draco remarked, as if the years of taunting and bad blood between them had been merely a blip in their existence. “But all much better now, I daresay. Wouldn't you agree?”
!" Draco was fierce and belligerent. He turned his entire torso, bearing down upon his companion. Harry's crushed hand was deftly transferred to Draco's free one; the arm wrapped 'round his shoulders shifted abruptly, drawing the whole of Harry tight up against a naked chest that heaved, incidentally compressing his one nostril with every other thud. "Shut up and listen!"
“Yes! Yes, you are, Harry Potter!” Scowling, Draco stamped his foot, which only produced an annoyingly muffled thud from the plush carpet. “Or--Or maybe you’re not Harry at all? Blaise, is that you? Are you pranking me again? You bloody bastard!”
"Ple-please!" It was a blink and half, no more, as Malfoy reared up, dropped trou and lining his cockhead up against Harry's smeared and waiting arse, the lubed fingertips traveling from sphincter to dick without pause, spreading the slime of sex. 'Oh-gods-AHHH!"
Potter, he was certain, never felt chilled. The git had hot blood under that mostly calm and increasingly self-assured exterior. He moved more like a man than a boy, these days, and Draco appreciated that with all his heart—and his groin. A pleasant dull ached had settled there, shortly after his successful meeting with Dumbledore and not even his Head's distant sneers could dissipate it.
Draco wasn’t scoffing. He was vaguely aware that Harry had become one of those people who knew rather a lot about rather a wide array of things. A sort of Jack-of-All person. It wasn't really a surprise to him. Harry had always been a quick study and Draco was fairly certain he’d have been a much better student at Hogwarts if he’d a half a chance to study. He’d certainly excelled in Runes at Flamel. Along with quite a few of the lectures they’d shared and several extracurricular courses.
"Hermione!" Harry flushed bright red at the very thought of it; laying himself that wide open to a Malfoy broadside? Oh, no! He wasn't that daft! "Oh, fucking
—his Zen focus had fled and all this noisy idiocy was forcing him to watch stupid Ron and not Malfoy’s interesting hair—and really, Malfoy’s hair was worth watching. Especially in the mornings. …And Ron—now that Voldie was offed and out of the picture—was entirely too free-spirited. Some kind soul should sit on his damned ginger head! Or soak it!
Harry barked. Well, more snorted or coughed. A muffled sound and so sudden, and it broke the awkwardly lengthening silence between them in such a way as to splinter most of hope.
“There was?” Draco exclaimed, casting his quill down and leaning forward to peer at Harry. “Merlin, Potter--where? We swept that room with Revelio, remember?”
, if you’re so curious,” Draco sneered at her, but he kept his eyes on Potter, circling and weaving two hundred yards above the stands. “Got a good seat on him; look at that arse, gripping the stick. He’s a natural.”
Meanings – Communication, spiritual growth, signals or prophecies from the universe or an ancestral god (occasionally Odin)"
Besides, Ron was a terrible tease.  Ron was also on a hopelessly perpetual mental high because of all the steady shagging he was getting now that Voldemort was history. Ron, in a word, was a horrid git over it. A demon.
"Yes?" Draco cocked a brow, tapping a toe tip lazily. "Further clues to report, Auror Trainee Potter?"
“Some Muggles think the claviform symbolized Woman,” Luna remarked idly, her expression serene. “In the motherly sense, I suppose. Logically enough.”
"Granger. Potter," Malfoy nodded at them both with his usual savoir-faire. He'd crept up on cat-feet (well, rather nice half-boots) from parts unknown, though likely the Castle proper, whilst Harry had been basically blind and deaf to his surroundings, moping up a storm. "Granger, may I borrow your notes for Arithmancy? Zabini's got hold of mine but yours are likely more accurate, anyway. Would you lend me them?"
"Oh no you don't, Harry! Don't touch me--get off!" Draco flinched, dropping his hands to his sides, clenching them tightly.
“Yeah.” Somehow, and mayhap due to Harry’s toes tickling away at Draco’s arches, they’d wriggled their way nearer each other in Draco’s bed, such that it wasn't much effort for Draco to reach out and tousle Harry’s hair. Harry flailed and grabbed at his hand, grinning. “Oi! Get off, you. Look, I’m really just sorry we had to hurt each other, learning it.” Seemed it wasn’t any effort at all for Harry to use that captured hand to haul Draco in for a warm, hearty hug. Draco went with it, bemused. “C’mere, do," Harry urged him. "Come on."
“Destroy you, yes,” Pansy nodded, her sharp gaze zeroing in on Draco’s anguished expression. “And Harry too, most likely. But you shan’t either of you know, darling, unless you try it.”
"Why would you ever say that, git?" he demanded imperiously, and instantly froze as Harry insinuated a wide warm hand between his thighs, flexing continuously under Harry's trim arse. "Hah!" he exclaimed. "Cease attempting to distract me! Rotter! Unfair!"
They were schoolboys, still—barely. Potter, Draco decided, could skive off whatever it was that was getting in the way, right? Pish-tosh to detention; they'd both make it later if they had to. Really, they were still just kids yet and that was what kids did, wasn't it? Childish things? Irresponsible things?
"Oh, yes." Draco, satisfied with a job well done, thrust his own arm out and shook it impatiently. "Of course, Harry. Doesn't it figure? Do mine now," he added, and the hand still at Harry's spine spread wide and possessively, a living blanket at his back. "Do mine," he said again, nuzzling away at Harry's earlobe, lipping it. "I want to see yours on me. On…us."
“Unngh!” Harry rolled his eyes at it and then visibly struggled to stay focused on his looming blond menace. “Stop trying to distract me, Malfoy—it’s not going to work!”
Like Hogsmeade, it was a Wizarding enclave, and the high street was bustling with students and professors, naturally, but also rather a lot of other people, and there were quite a few merchants. Harry cast a Translation Charm on himself and proceeded to purchase a few small items he was in need of immediately. He couldn’t procure gifts for his friends, of course--as an Unspeakable on active duty, it was naturally forbidden to betray his physical location at any given time--but he could acquire some replacement supplies to his Potions stores.
“Sod off, darling,” Draco replied pleasantly. “And close your trap. You’re disturbing my concentration. This is a teachable moment, here; I don’t want to miss it because of you two.”
Harry cared for the little homewrecker, and so he had to ask after her, the wretched, pea-brained, built-like-a-brick-shithole twit. It was the done thing, that. Taking an interest.
managed to get close to Harry because of Harry's naïve willingness to forgive, to make peace and let bygones be bygones. A little making up, a judicious spot of wine-plying, a snog or three in a nearby lav or a cloakroom and ultimately the 'bet'cha can't ignore
It was a bit of quandary, Harry thought unhappily, his eyes busy with scanning through another enquiry, this time from Newfoundland.
Harry tilted his head back and looked up at the night sky. Utterly brilliant, sparkling like a cloth solidly woven of diamonds, the occasional red or blue tinged one leaping out to the naked eye. Nothing like what he’d be able to view in, say, London. The sky above went on forever, dizzying and rendering him more than a little breathless.
“Mills!” Harry stood up, outraged, extending an accusing finger to wave wildly in her direction. “Lingerie? Now, of all times? You--you--you!”
"Marry-me-p-p-please?" he squeaked, though his throat had closed tight, like a porthole against the rushing sea of emotion pouring up his esophagus. "H-Harry? M-Marry?"
“Of course I do.” Luna righted her glass and took a moment to sip some. She didn’t take her knowing gaze off Harry’s face, though. “But it’s not merely that,” she went on, her light languid voice at odds with the razor’s edge glint in her pale blue eyes. “You have a hole in you, I can feel it. Will you be able to make peace?”
He thought of Draco, naturally enough, as he moved about the market, seeking out bits-and-pieces to add to his collection of possibilities. The bothersome, nosy git had become his roommate by then, what with Ron and Neville matriculating and moving on, and he’d been instrumental in dragging Harry off to a Runes elective course ‘for a lark, Potty’.  But it had sucked Harry’s somewhat dilatory devotion to academics right up, and right smart about it, no question. All those years he’d spent solving the puzzle that was Voldemort (and Grindelwald before him), all that energy he’d believed would be best slaked by becoming an Auror? Well, it had found a shiny new sluice-gate to pour through--he winced internally at his own mediocre metaphor--and turned into a great roaring river, one leading to an enormous, inviting sea of fascination beyond.
“Sorry! Wasn’t sure you’d still be here, this late. Here’s those old surveillance files we wanted from Archives this morning.”
"Oh, but Draco, my dear, why not your Harry?" Narcissa raised an eyebrow in gentle query as she chose another biscuit to nibble. Magical corsetry was a wonderful thing. "I mean to say, darling, simply by examining every humiliating incident you've confided to me before now I'd've instantly deduced he'd be most obvious person alive to claim your affections—had I ever considered it in that light." HIs mother fixed him with a most direct Look. "Which of course I hadn't, given our prior circumstances, nor would've normally thought to, either. But do you not agree, Draco? It stands to reason, darling. You've been gagging after that young man for almost a decade now, one way or another. Ten years it's been, Draco. I see nothing at all surprising about it, dear."
Another semi-planned rendezvous in the shadow of the Hump-Backed Witch before dinner, another opportunity for some snogging and maybe a mutual wank, if they were fast enough and lucky. It was par for Draco's new life, post Myrtle's lav. He didn't mind it, not so much.
"You're joking with me, right, arse?" He laughed, almost helplessly. "This—this is some sort of prank…maybe? Because I didn't quite catch all of what you were saying, Draco—but—"
"Mmmm-hmmm," Malfoy echoed agreeably, the sound a deep humming purr emanating from the chest Harry had so longed to lay hands upon. He smacked his reddened lips and blinked narrowed, hazy-pewter hued eyes when he finally drew back a scant inch to allow Harry a scant breath: a great feline, terribly pleased with the prey he'd chased down and conquered.
They'd have to work on that bit, Draco mused happily, that very intriguing notion. He'd always wanted a sibling, Draco recalled, his bemused mind wandering off to much balmier, talc-scented climes. Or three. But maybe five would be a better number—give those sodding Weasels a run for their Galleons. Or seven—go them by one more.
“No problem.” Nev shrugged. He glared holes into Ron instead, who was stupidly grinning at him, wide enough to split his freckled face in half. “Just get a leash on him, alright?”
“You’re sweet, Harry,” she said, leaning precariously across the tabletop and dropping a quick buss upon his scar. “And my perennial favourite Wizard, as always. Ta, then.”
“Tosh. That’s not what I meant, really,” she said, “and you know it, both of you. I literally just said that, not even a minute ago, Harry; were you even listening? No one requires children to feel happy and fulfilled and that's fact. But some people really do have a lot to gain from their interactions with children and the both of you are classic examples. At least on the surface, Harry. At least admit that.”
"No…!" Draco moaned; his head all at once too damned heavy to hold upright. He could feel himself falling, falling into Harry, but Harry—for all he was there, right there in Draco's arms—wasn't reaching out to catch him. "No—no."
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I'm sorry, I was a right twat, Draco,” Harry was sobbing as he clambered onto Draco’s bed, dragging aside the duvet and rapidly wrapping himself around a startled Draco like a smaller, frenzied relative of the Giant Squid. “I didn't mean it, not a word I said, I’m just--and it’s so--and I can never say anything that matters,” he wailed, gulping and blinking, specs all askew, glinting crazily in the all too suddenly bright lamp light. “And you hate me, you must hate me, ‘cause I can never ever do it right; I dunno even know what it
For….never ended, never over. Not from start-pass go! at Malkin's, not from split-second judgmental refusals, not from stolen Remembralls, slinky Serpensortias and cocky teasing, taunting grins when badges flashed as brightly as the git's bared eyeteeth in passing—not for
“Well, and so do I, little one, but I’m not so sure, now. I could earn a detention of my own if Snape discovers me up your innocent baby bottom. You are still a minor, you know. It’d be such a shame, if someone thinks I’m taking advantage of you.”
“No.” Malfoy sneered, looming. “You’ve had ages. Tell me now or I hex.” He aimed the tip of his wand right at Harry’s Auror badge, eyes narrowing to dangerous slits. “Oh, and? Have I mentioned recently just how much I utterly abhor your habit of concealing your all too frequent injuries? Or your damnable tendency to shrug off all your brushes with death as if they were but paltry nothings? Because I feel I should remind you of this peeve of mine right now, Potter. Talk!”
The last one. Of the night. Which meant that that the memory would have to sustain them both all the way through the usual common room nonsense of group games and chatter, nagging schoolwork and revisement; oh, and Draco's usual two hours of Prefect duties or…until the moment he and Harry finally met up once again in the Room of Requirement, just after the stroke of midnight.
It was the Veela, too. Those wings, that scent—that intensity of desire, as if there was nothing else that existed for Draco Malfoy but Harry Potter. Harry didn't kid himself. He might not be as susceptible as everyone else was, but Draco Malfoy was already someone special. He took up centre stage in Harry's brain—always had.
Yes, alright; there were worse things conceivable than the many other 'worst things' Draco had racked up to date in his short lifespan: his Mum could quiz him mercilessly for additional details beyond Draco's bare bones confession of interest in the Wizarding Golden Boy—and then, too, she could display the gall to chortle knowingly over his polite request aid and assistance in his pursuit of Boy Wonder.
“Oh. Sorry!” She smiled at him in apology, though it was a weak, watered-down version. “Harry. Right, er, my mistake—you’re practising
"You're an idiot, Potter," Draco derided acidly, every inch superiour. "You don't just come out with things like that—did no one ever tell you?"
"No," Draco stated, rather more firmly. He—they—couldn't risk it. "I can't. Doesn't matter, Potter. Drop it, do."
Her brief bout of weird girly enthusiasm clearly over and done with, Draco's mother settled back with her tea, sipping contentedly.
Reality was enough of a bother; Malfoy the largest botheration of them all. Unwittingly, the bloke stuck his sensually intriguing, good-smelling self dead-centre into Harry's head like a giant road sign, waking or sleeping, and pointing straight down the path to Madness, Population: one Harry Potter.
“Right, thanks,” Harry smiled, stifling the wince the stack invoked. “Mills, you mean that literally or figuratively? Because I am transitioning as fast I can possibly--”
“Good.”  Hermione smiled, pleased. "It's best if you understand that these aren't malicious acts against either of you. More a matter of survival, I should think, at least from the perspective of your houses. They wish to thrive once more, and you're the available vessels. Means to an end, that's all."
Floribunda twittered—there was no other word for it. She was wreathed in kittenish smiles, all larger even the face-splitting one she'd worn whilst accepting his Very Large Order.
"You daft fool! Must you always be aping me?" But he was laughing, openly, and the sight of it drew eyes and mutters from the other sippers and chatterers. Harry blushed scarlet, staring down at his box because he'd nowhere else that was even remotely possible—and if Draco continued to look like that, with that expression of laughing wonder, Harry would throw caution to the winds and be scrambling 'cross the table, snogging him for all he was worth.
"Remember you said that," Malfoy growled, and one hand brushed Harry's cock. It only took that and it was over. "Harry."
There were twenty of them in Eighth Year, half of them male and half female, pretty much. MacMillan was bit of a puzzle after their therapy sessions, but no one minded that, least of all them. Sorted out and pegged per the antique-style definitions, the Hogwart's Eights covered most of Wizarding Britain's demographics perfectly: a certain percentage of pure-blood, an equivalency of Muggleborn; some purely interested in the opposite sex, some in only the same, and a few preferring both or none or all. Religious upbringings, ethnicity, economic advantages or lacks thereof and all the other factors that people like Percy Weasley liked to sort out other people by were also accounted for, as was native intellect and ability, Magical strength and skill, etcetera. It was a miniature bell curve, the Eighth Year, though skewed a bit towards those of higher levels of magical power and/or those with great gluts of sheer dumb luck. Only logical, that, given the dire circumstances of their Seventh Year. None of this made a dragon fart's worth of difference to this especial group; they were all feeling well beyond any sort of superficial categorizing and would have been highly offended by same.
Potter had raised a speculative brow at him and sent a glance towards Mr. Kringleshoot, who was patiently awaiting them to bring their discussion to a finish. "'Proper', is it? Er, I suppose so. But don't think it'll always be like this, Draco. In the future—"
"Okay." He blinked vaguely at the fire burning earnestly in Hermione's eyes and then dropped his own, meek, biddable. Weasley he didn't even glance at; he knew what he'd see there. "I get it." And he'd didn't rise to his feet to see them out, either, even though all his Malfoy breeding demanded it. He was just so…just
Bad enough Potter had the habit of pulling his soul out through his cock, sometimes—or it felt that way, to Draco. Like being wanked by a sodding Dementor, but in a very good way, and Draco would hand over that particular piece of his psychic anatomy any day in exchange for Potter to be there always, so he could practice that particular Dark Art of his on Draco on a steady basis. And it had to be Dark because it felt so fucking brilliant; there was no comparison.
“Excuse me?” Draco interrupted tersely, finally able to hear their whispering as the roar of the crowd subsided. “What’s this about me being daft, you gits?”
This is a place of death, of danger, ancient and strong, but it will not bleed over nor stain the world Harry and Luna and Garambeau love and care for, not on this night.
He groaned again, distressed in advance. This time Hermione ignored him completely, having already made her point.
Florabunda nodded happily, making further notes on her ledger, and causing a whole flurry of grey ringlets to descend from her ill-kempt bun. Draco could swear he saw leafy, vine-y tendrils entwined with the hot pink ribbons that had failed to bind them, but that wasn't important now. If the Witch lived up to her rep as a tip-top Wizarding florist, she could stick whatever she wished in her mop; Draco couldn't give a hoot.
"No, it isn't, Harry," Draco huffed. "It'll be just like all the other times. Poor sap'll end up with another one-off and then he'll moon around like an abandoned Kneazle, and either you or I'll have to ward our bed hangings like bloody fortresses for days on end. Not doing that again, thank you."
Of course this wasn't proceeding well, but then he'd not planned it out, either. He'd only just spewed out the words he'd been thinking and damn the consequences. Thus, hearts were broken unnecessarily, Harry knew. He should've known better by now, at least.
"There's some Witches from Beauxbatons I know," Bones offered up. "They might come over, if I write to them."
Draco made a fuss of yanking up his dressing gown sleeve and pinching himself a second time. The thin skin of his wrist--the unMarked arm, naturally--and in plain view. Wincing, he noted Potter's immediate sympathetic grimace with a certain degree of bitter satisfaction.
"Oh!" Draco flapped hands at the room, giving it up as a bad job. "Never mind, will you?" He glanced around the office again, searching for any old thing as a distraction. "Ah, Potter! Meant to say, pretty posh digs, these. What is it exactly you do here again? Because this cannot be the norm for neophyte."
Harry. Willing and snarky, snippy and guileful—bold as brass; Harry was all these things, and so very precious.
“Perhaps it does, for them,” Harry nodded, casting carefully so as not to damage the adjacent artworks. “Though they view it through a different lens than we do. There, Luna! Do you see the Negatus? Luce was correct; there’s damage been done here. And deliberately.”
regulation Muggle denims. He squirmed where he sat, hands shoving hastily at his pants and jeans. They inched down his lean hips 'neath Draco's attentive gaze. "By what 'possibilities', exactly?"
“Very unlikely, given your proclivity to bugger off for long periods of time, Potter,” Draco stuck in, carefully watching Granger’s face as she quietly entered her full concentration mode, absently tapping away at the rim of her glass with a fingernail and staring sternly at the childish scrawlings stuck all over her Muggle coolbox with Spellotape. "Though Grimmauld doesn't seem to know
"Hungarian Horntail, dear," his life-partner, Robert, reminded gently. "It was the fierce one—you remember, from the documentary we watched?"
"Wanker!" he'd scolded and proceeded to adore his tie-tack. Wore it always, and not so much for the Potter crest as for the fact that Draco had given it him. "Sod you."
. Firm, juicy, delicious! Full of all the good things there ever, ever were, was Harry Potter—and Draco Malfoy knew exactly how to treat such a treasure. No one knew better than he! …With care, and fastidiously, and…and yet also rough and tough and strong. Harry was all man, damn it! Tears only confused him—the Brown bint's needy self-aggrandized agenda to procure a new bloke would only befuddle a congenitally idiotic nit like Harry further!
…Besides, he'd need it, all of it, all the sugar in the flat, surging through his veins. All the sparkly remnants of Harry's quiet heroism, the stuff that inhabited the corners just as much as the dust did, all scraped up and inhaled—metaphorically, maybe?-just to face Harry. He'd need to stand tall as he always did: fearless, stubborn. Malfoy, but fucking
Draco tapped his foot impatiently, staring about a very poor excuse for a bedroom, which was actually dominated by the bed. That piece of furniture was massive and, fortunately, not dirty in any way, but Draco still wasn't best pleased. Frankly, not much about the Shrieking Shack pleased him, other than the fact that it was indeed very private. Probably because no one in their right mind and with a smidgeon of sense would come here!
"…Draco?" he added, hesitantly, when his companion did nothing more than sigh and stare fixedly at Harry's offering.
“We know that, believe me, it’s why we’re sharing the flat in the first place! My problem is Potter’s just done a complete about-face on me--he wants these things, he’s just said so! A month spent away from both our homes, having to get a flat as bloody bolt-hole, and it’s gone completely topsy-turvey between us! He's lost his mind, that what's happened. He's gone and given in to all this magical fuss our houses are putting up, caved under pressure or something. What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?”
In a way, it was worse than all the years before that, with the Death Eaters after his arse. More continually painful, certainly. Painful in the way being nibbled to death by ducks was.
"Legs up, Potter," Draco ordered abruptly, and then shoved them there himself, not waiting. Harry didn't fight him, but his eyes were glinting in that glittery, infuriating way he had: challenging, and with exactly the righteous air that always sent the wind up Draco.
"Oh, gods!" Longbottom moaned, and threw himself on the mercy of his teddy bear. "You really, really can't mean to do this, guys—I'm begging!"
"Do," Malfoy added, and did the 'looking down his aquiline nose' thing that always irritated the Weasel immediately.
"I'm not mean!" Harry shot back, falling into a no-nonsense stance, almost a mirror of Draco's posture, but sharper. Harder. "Far from it, Draco. I'm sensible, is what. It wasn't working out, can't you see that? None of it—nothing. Bloody anyone could see that. Your mates certainly did, didn't they? It was time—past time, to put it to rest."
Potter would walk out of this whole sodding mess alive and no one—not even Potter—was allowed to say differently. Draco would ensure it.
"Seventh Year's been pretty much decimated," Weasley was telling Bulstrode, loudly, "but I know a few kids from the Village who might participate—"
Pansy, who’d been chatting away with Nott over Longbottom’s latest foul-up in Advanced Potions and laying odds, too, on the calibre and duration of the next one, stopped her high-pitched, highly annoying chit-chat abruptly and went still as a tomb. Gasped softly as thistle wafting and gaped a bit, too—as did Nott, plumped next to her on the other side of the Slytherin senior’s bench. At Draco, her ex-boyfriend.
"Oh, we're doing it," Draco affirmed grimly. He and Harry exchanged worried glances and then turned their eyes steadfastly ahead, focussed upon the grand double door that stood at the very end of the very much longer-than-it-ever was- before corridor. "Never fear."
"Quit it, you sneaky little bastard!" Draco snapped. "Stop shoving me about! We could just as easily have put on Glamours and rented a room-by-the-hour at the Hog's Head! If you'd bothered to ask
“Really?” Black brows quirked at him quizzically as Harry crowded politely after, resting a hand on the mantle. “Why is that?”
Potter, Draco decided abruptly, should really put more thought into his overall appearance—someone might be watching him; someone with taste and discernment, that is. He could be the object of, ah, someone’s…
“Thai, I think, ta,” Harry replied, leaning forward to make a space for their soon-to-be supper plates on the table. Which was mostly accomplished by his spelling of everything piled onto it over to the antique bureau Draco had carted over from his study in the Manor. “There, now. Ah. Would you mind bringing me one too?”
haven combined. Owned by him as he owned that belly—the soft spaces behind kneecaps. That his morning-after breath and his sharp toenails were really safe handholds Harry could cling to, as needed.
It was just a little bit evident in the Larger Library, which had grown itself a wall-full of books on parenting and child care, nestled alongside another wall packed tight with every hue of the Fairy Book series plus Beedle the Bard
What if this was just a passing interest—a fling of sorts for Harry? The Boy Who Lived was hardly the Boy Who Dated, now was he? Harry's experience had not been great when he and Draco had first come together. He wouldn't know, necessarily, when the other's persons affections were truly engaged? And—and Harry might simply think of what they'd done so far as dating. What if—what if this was all merely a flash in the pan, on his part? If Draco had misjudged the depth on both sides—if he'd guessed wrongly—
“What? Wh-What??!! The fuck, Draco!” Harry shouted, leaping to his feet as if he’d been Jinxed. “Where do you even get off, saying that? You--you fucking poser! It’s not like you’ve got anything to show for yourself either, you know? Don't you dare accuse me of what you can't even manage to do yourself, git-for-brains!”
! This was just too exciting—too utterly freeing, after the horrible events of last year. He felt entirely alive again—thanks to the git (with his long throat and acceptable eye colour…even if it was obscured behind reflective lenses at the moment.)
"Well…what d'you want me to do, then, Draco?" Harry grumbled back. "He's got a crush. Can't do much about that but wait it out."
"Yes, of course, son. Still, as I mentioned, Harry at least will lend you a sympathetic shoulder in my absence, dear one; you  really ought at least Owl him--oh! Speaking of? Have I told you we’ve been invited to stay with an old school friend of ours on her lovely large yacht? She keeps it in Monaco, right in the harbour. UnPlottable, naturally, given the amount of Muggles, but still, it should be quite, quite the Season in the Wizarding district. I'm afraid I'm vastly looking forward, darling. This has been exactly the sort of holiday I was hoping for, after that unfortunate business with your father. I do hope you don't blame me for making my escape, dear one. I am, I confess, feeling an entirely new Witch these days."
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione giggled. “It’s not as though that really is a bad thing, you know.” She looked piercingly from Harry to Draco and back again, affixing him with her knowing dark eyes. “For some people, I mean. Absolutely not for everyone, though.”
"Just, you know. With our houses carrying on the way they are.  It's too silly. Separately. And now, I mean, and not--not years ago. It's not important, though. Tell you the joke later, alright? If I even remember; if it even is a joke. You know me, finding things funny when they're actually not, right? Anyway, Harry. We'll catch up as soon as we're able, alright? If it's not this evening, then some other--”
“Oh, shut it,” Harry said fondly, stepping back at last out of Draco's personal bubble. He grinned, a bit cat-in-the-cream, his eyes sparkling with amusement behind his stylish specs. "Don't take the piss, you. I like my new office, ta very much. It's nice, right?"
wasn't particularly. Not in his own skin, at least. His quest for assistance with the Manor suddenly struck him as frivolous, here in this place and seated like a supplicant before this familiar stranger.
Draco's moan was nearly audible; he thought so, too. Harry groaned at the degree of want conveyed by the voice in his head and couldn't help but respond. He spread his legs, settling his bum at the bend of Draco's waist, and clamped his thighs murder-tight round Draco's waist. Draco's cock lay throbbing against his well-lubed crack and Harry smiled.
Harry roared, roused beyond bearing—a Gryffindor lion roar, too, deafening at close range when Sonorous’d—and launched his wiry form at his best friend since forever, stray people and foodstuffs flying by the wayside.
He and Harry: partners. To the death, through the life, and beyond. Forsaking all others, and happily so!
Harry peered at him, eyes suddenly narrowed in quick suspicion. Clearly, he'd been struck with the sudden thought Draco was taking the piss on him. "Did you not pick up on the 'yes', Malfoy? I thought I just said so. Yes, I'll go. It sounds a good break from swotting, actually, and I've not been to Hogsmeade in ages—not to faff about, at any rate. If you, er—if you mean it."
Harry pondered the question, clamping his lips together to prevent additional destruction, nibbling nervously upon the lower one when he forgot, overwhelmed by the sheer horror of awaiting Draco's response.
"I wasn't doing anything in particular—I was angry, okay?" Draco admitted quickly. "I…didn't think he meant it was permanent. When he left, you know?"
, Draco." Was that a trace of unasked-for sympathy buried deep in the habitual smugness? Draco was curious, in a faraway sort of way. He cocked his head at her, waiting, hoping for more. More enlightenment, mayhap. Advice, if she felt so inclined. "It's like this."
said; I don't even remember what it was now but you can't possibly take it seriously—you can't! And I'm trying to apologize to you, sincerely; I've been trying to find you in person to say it for ages now, if you'll only just hear me out, Harry. I bloody well owl you every damned day and I never hear back; don't even know if you've gotten them! I'm trying, Harry, alright? Give me a bit of a break, will you?"
“If you're sure, Potter. I just--I mean, my little problem can wait, I suppose, and it rather looks to me you’re in a more dire situation?”
Those green eyes of Potter’s were bloody incandescent; Draco had no idea they could do that. Glow. Well, he did…Room of Requirement. His own parlour, too. He blinked in parted-lipped wonder at the blazing green brilliance and almost missed the shy ‘Thanks, again, mate!” that followed before Potter turned tail and hared off to his next scheduled lecture.
“No,” Pansy replied firmly, shaking her glossy bob. “It’s not even noon yet, darling, and Blaise will be back with the girls any moment now. Tea or coffee or butterbeer; those are your choices.”
"You will bring him along, won't you, darling? To visit with me? I would so like a chance to become reacquainted."
Harry blurted this into the wealth of forgiving darkness, though he'd not meant to--not ever. In a million years,
“Suppose so, yes. Time flies, doesn’t it. When we're not having fun.” Draco snorted, chuckling softly; it was hilarious, the utter irony of it--of them.  Given why they were flatting together at all. “Truly pot, kettle, aren't we, Potty? Both of us fretting over each other, and for the same reason. No wonder the Manor went round the bend, wanting me to procreate. I would too, if faced with a sorry case such as me, nearly reverted to virginity. Not much hope for siring a gaggle of children, is there?”
Hermione ducked under the table, burrowing out of the way, pink-cheeked and gasping. All Harry could see, as he ducked and twisted, was her hand, tugging her bookstrap closer.
Harry couldn't look; daren't, even as he found a box of the approximate size of his opening with stolid clam-like resistance within his cupped hands. Didn't want to see Draco's eyes instantly veil behind pale lashes, his firm lips thin, just sufficient to indicate his faint disapproval.
Potter dithered, his green eyes darting everywhere. And every man Jack and Witch Jill was watching them. Draco blanched. He'd engineered it like this, but still…how humiliating!
"Hmm, yeah. Reassigned to Town, too, on a much more permanent basis, and a full month sooner than I thought I'd be, too. Bit brilliant, I think."
“Not easily managed, I assure you,” Draco chuckled, patiently staying precisely where he was, neither shifting away nor coming too close. “But I’ve got a decently heroic enough lead to follow, right here at the office. Have had for several years now. Trust me, it does change a fellow, all that exposure to sainthood. One minute left, by the way.”
…Which was how it came to be that rudesby Granger and the lump of a Weaselbee sat upon their contrary arses upon a sofa in the Room of Requirement, propped with popcorn, pretzels, salted nuts and an ever-full pitcher of pumpkin juice ('And butterbeer for Ron," Harry had added, smiling, ''cause likely he'll be wanting something stronger, yeah?')
, months in the making, as it started out as a gift ficlet, at Christmas and then it kept going on and on and on, forever! Which is why it's huge, yes. It's unBeta'd becuase dear
“Now?” he jibed back at Harry. “Or in three minutes, when it’s bloody worn off? Which do you really want, Potter? Because I rather think waiting that three minutes is--”
"Or gloves," Draco continued as if Harry hadn't squirmed in his seat and blushed at all. "The perfect gift, aren't they, for the man who seems to have everything?"
"Ah. How was it, then?" Draco bit out, doggedly attempting to remain civil. "The object you were, er, unclogging? Did you sort out the bitc-Brown's plumbing for her?"
"Yes. First off, you were hysterical, pretty much, and you were crying. You despise crying, idjit. I had to make it stop. What did you want me to do? Silencio? Stifle you with my hand? I rather think not! I’m not some fucking abuser. Shock value, however, is proven to be helpful--”
“So I arrive there, just as usual, and that despite seriously, consciously concentrating on getting off the bloody path it keeps sending me down and actually making it to my damned rooms and my own damned lav, right? I’m resisting and dragging my feet every step of the way but it’s like the strongest Imperius you can ever imagine. Right? Worse than the Mark.”  He laughed again, a little wildly. "Never thought I'd hear myself say that aloud in this lifetime, must admit."
“Mm-hmm, okay,” Harry hummed, and bumped a shoulder against Draco’s tense form, propelling them forward. "Sounds horrid. Keep on, then, if we're doing this."
. A very good time, a brilliant time, the best possible time of all, in fact. Can’t think of a better one, actually.”
“But you wanted me to, my lovely little Harrykins…didn’t you?” Malfoy put a hand to his cheek, aping shock. “Wasn’t that exactly what you requested of me, just now? ‘Get on with it’, you said, and I have, and now you’re not happy. Do make up your mind, alright? I know you kids can’t manage to pay attention to anything for more than minute these days, but, well—really! It’s too much, this. Tries my patience.”
"That's it, exactly," Draco nodded courteously. Floribunda might look like a Hufflepuff—Hades, she might very well
“Potter-Potter-Potter!” chanted like-minded Slytherins all about them—like Draco, they too were entranced and overcome by the rousing display on the part of the Gryffindor Seeker. It helped, too, that he’d saved their many shivering little arses from certain grisly death, recently. “Harrr—reeee!” they shrieked as one, joining all the other Houses in a giant, eardrum-blowing noise. “Rah! Rah! Rah!
“Alright, then. It'll come as no surprise to you, darling, that Hermione and I’ve been chatting, now and again. Wee Wizards play group, you know?” She shrugged nonchalantly. “In fact, Ronald and Blaise have also been chatting. Wee Wizards is thrice weekly, thank Salazar, and their Rosie also attends.”
For it shocked him. Truly. How could he have not have sorted this long ago? He was Slytherin—he was one of the brainy sorts, like the Mu-Granger! Why had it taken the sprouting of great fidgety wings and the appearance of a beloved bloody face crammed full of boils in his very own parlour to awaken him to the state of his own heart?
Draco was absolutely not 'alright'; he was a million leagues removed from ‘alright’ and he was afraid it showed. No--he wanted it to show, actually. There were times when he’d really, really missed having Harry available and now he didn’t have to, finally.
“Damn it, fine, you stupid obstinate old house!” Draco swore, nearly a full week later, when the Manor once again presented his person at the doorway to the Nursery. He slammed the insistently open door shut again, kicking it for good measure, and pointed his wand tip at the painted panels of rosy-cheeked cherubs with a heavy scowl. "I'm through! You hear me?"
is!" Harry snorted, giving a scoffing laugh. "No worries. It's not that, trust me. Ted's alright. That lad's indestructible, thank Merlin, despite all the mischief he gets into.” He held his hands up defensively. “Look, I stopped by to see him first thing on my way home from Nor--uh, um. Er. Where I was last, working. He's fine.”
He should make sure Potter hadn’t lost any significant amount of weight, as that might make a difference to the match. Of course, the shared showers would happen
"Yes…yes…" Harry moaned his agreement. "But so good, Draco. Can you feel me? All that lube? Brilliant!"
Draco winced. His calm, collected old stick of a Papa was pulling a bloody Medusa on him, and he was just a shade stropped in the first place, what with Harry. Always that bedamned Harry!
"Yeah, well. More like two, I should think," Harry nodded, and Draco, being assiduously polite, silently inclined his head as well. "We'll catch you up at luncheon, Hermione. Get us a table and er, have a good time in the meanwhile."
He paused, waited for a beat, listening to the thud in his chest. It hurt, a bit, and Harry said bloody nothing, only looked at him. As if he were a bug, infesting Harry's new furniture.
Harry didn't mind exams so much, nowadays, as he had a great deal more time available to revise. It was who he'd be paired with, come tomorrow: Malfoy, his heart's own nemesis.
Draco changed up ten degrees redder, all 'round, his embarrassed flush covering him stem to stern. His teacup clanked against its saucer as his hands trembled.
"Doubted." Draco felt more than heard the tiny gulp, the bitter puff of air against his cheekbone. "You doubted me. You, of all people."
“I took your advice, you know,” his inexplicable flatmate carried on, apparently oblivious to such things as 'atmosphere', bustling about like a small dark dervish.
"I should." Draco went on, only to pause for another long moment, till Harry heard the damp papery whisper of his tongue, sliding over lips that were likely as bitten and dry as Harry's own. "Tell you."
Draco sighed silently and nibbled upon his lip as she nattered on and on about all her sightseeing and shopping trips, gamely summoning a polite air of enthusiasm. He slumped slowly down on his hearth rug as she related various marvels of her holiday, shoving a tasselled silk bolster against his aching back and shifting about to make himself comfortable as one could be with only a couple of spindly chair legs for support. This news about Harry was startling to say the least. And vaguely worrisome.  Not that Harry wasn't generally at least a little worrisome, at least in Draco's experience.
“Haha,” Harry laughed nervously, furtively inching his chair away from his end of their desk and shaking his head ruefully as he ran a hand through his ruffled hair. “Right. Yes, well, there was one more Wizard still in the room, you see?”
“I’m sorry, I really am, and I will try to do better, I swear, but what I was trying to tell you is that, what with being away from so long, and then being back in familiar spaces again, like Grimmauld, it felt nice. Like having a home, of sorts. And you know, even if it’s only been Kreacher with me at Grimmauld, he’s still a living, breathing, talking being, right? It sort of felt like having a roomie, at least for a little, but you’re totally dead on. This is much better. Waaay better!”
never deserve him, nor care about what Harry really needed, deep down, beneath all the glitzy heroics—not as Draco did.
"No, you don't, Harry," Hermione scolded him, "and don't be such a spineless sop. He's civil to you now, isn't he? When he chats with you in class? No more insults—no more brawling? Assigned and regular study partner for NEWTS Potions and DADA and fellow Prefect, right? You talk to Malfoy all the time, Harry; you're managing to be almost matey, the pair of you. Not Ron-level, but still! Amazing; unlikely, yes—but still so damned true. Don't bother to deny it. I have eyes."
…It was only later—significantly later, when he’d retreated to his bed and closed his curtains—that Draco realized he’d spent a rather a long period of his day justifying his own excitement to himself, and all because Pansy and Nott had been nothing but their usual arses over being dragged along to a Quidditch match. Not even a terribly interesting match, either. The only item of actual interest had been that bloody…Potter?
Harry eyed his gift warily. Last year it had been a mug, emblazoned with a kited image from the pages of
Suffice to say, it was all very Magical, this change to his old familiar home, and it shrieked of manipulation at the highest level. The Manor clearly wanted Children, it wanted them very badly, and Draco was deemed the One to Provide Them.
"Love you, prat," Harry slurped his way up and off Draco's rigid dick with an audible pop, staring intently up at Draco's face. He gripped Draco's kneecaps, squeezing them comfortably, spreading them wide—and Draco allowed it, wide-eyed and intent on that gaze. "I love you so much, Draco. Please don't doubt it."
Draco growled possessively—wordlessly—and shoved Harry over, a quick arm and wing sliding 'neath his head and back even as the tables were turned. He found himself laid out flat, Draco hustling between his parted thighs, tearing Harry's clothes off as he went with talons flashing. Shreds of cloth were flung hither and thither.
"You know, Draco, I really do think you should get up off the floor now. That looks to be really uncomfortable."

His traitorous ancestors, who were apparently in full cahoots with his damned house. It must be a conspiracy, Draco believed, as all the normal adult portraits had been mysteriously removed and replaced with versions of the same august persons, excepting painted from when they were but puling infants and tattling toddlers. Great-great-great-Uncle Gaulderoi, for instance, had one hellacious set of lungs on him and he didn't hesitate to use them when wanting his painted bottle. And Great-great-great-etcetera Auntie Angharad was forever babbling on and on about her toy knight. Perry, was it? Something like that. In any case, they all became quite unsettled whenever Draco chanced to leave the Manor and made no bones about willingly ratting him out to the Evil Nursery!
"Well!" he huffed, settling down leisurely and shifting his bum about on the cushiony surface, his face twitching itself into a reluctant grin. "Fine, thanks for asking. And I suppose you really
“I, uh, have been thinking and also I talked it over with Hermione and she agreed that I wasn't insane, and that yes, it was actually a decent idea,” Harry said, starting slowly enough but ending in a rush. “For both of us, really. I think we should listen to our damned houses, Malfoy. I think we should try it on, what they want. Go the whole route, get married, and have a kid. Kids, plural! I mean, I’d not just want one, I don’t think. One is so lonely, right? Malfoy? Malfoy, are you alright? You look...funny.”
” he and Luna cast together, ululating the syllables and overlaying the strengthening spell atop the
"Yes, a dog," she snapped back at him. "Or more like a donkey, maybe. An arse's end, anyway. You're too much, sometimes, Draco. You always overreact. You need to tone it down."
"Hmm. Still, darling, I do think you should floo him,” she insisted. “At the Ministry. Leave a message if naught else. It’s been simply ages since you two spent any decent amount of time together and I know you’ve missed him. He might even be able to offer you a few suggestions--or perhaps that dear Hermione Granger-Weasley will. She’s incredibly competent, as we all know, and I’ve heard from a little bird lately that Grimmauld Place has not been the easiest to manage either.  A bit of a sticky wicket going on there, from all I’ve heard tell.”

," Granger interrupted, jumping into the show the three of them were evidently putting on for the delectation of all the rest of Hogsmeade-goers. She was also apparently unable to keep quiet even if the topic was none of her bloody business, Draco thought privately, but she at least didn't haul off and slap Draco silly. Or hadn't, yet. Time would tell, he supposed. "You know it's only that we care very much for you, being your mates, and we're—well, to be brutal, Harry, Malfoy here is certainly the very
When, that is, Draco wasn't pointedly ignoring the two of them, as much as was humanly possible in his own flat. He'd not invited them in, they'd just come. Stormed his siege, in the vernacular.
“Er, some water? Juice?” he offered, snatching up Ron’s empty cup. Ron only glared at him, blue eyes blazing.
“Ah! Ahahaha! Go for it, you little berk!” Draco cried out, oblivious of Nott and Pans slumping dispirited next to him, eyes glazed into utter boredom.
They both drew back, gasping, gurgling, throats working as they swallowed and gulped. Harry’s mouth shaped into a startled ‘O!’ and Draco’s teeth came snapping together so fast he feared for their cracking.
Draco winced, subject to an entirely new surge of sheer fear. He'd assumed any number of things, recently, but….what if Potter—what if Harry really didn't feel the same as he did? He could rant and insist all he liked but if Harry wasn't in the same place as Draco was, it wouldn't matter a whit's worth, would it?
"Hmm-mm," Hermione nodded, having heard this before. "Astoria—and she's much too young for him. And also female. It'll never last. Mark my words."
“It’s not, Hermione,” Harry cut her off, scowling unhappily. “I talked it over with him already. It’s nothing to do with that case; I'd checked all the current open Auror files anyway and Imperius'd Ghouls are not Grimmauld's issue. Bill’s already confirmed it’s not any sort of Curse nor any Dark Magic. At least not for my house.” He glanced at his mate. "Draco?"
"I…erm." Draco blanched, entirely nonplussed. His Mum was a terrifying lady, sometimes. He'd often suspected the same but he'd not time to spare for being terrorized in this exact manner at this exact moment; he had a mission driving this strange Happy Famblies tea party. Which he should be about accomplishing before they both washed away on wave of Oolong and maternal empathy, he and his scary Mum. "A-About that piece of heirloom jewelry I mentioned, Mother? Could we possibly get back to that? I really am in need of something both Malfoy and valuable, you see. Er—and today, if at all possible. I'd like to carry it back to Hogwarts with me, Mum. It's, ah, rather…rather urgent."
Warnings: Dithering. Scheming. Scant mention of possible mpreg. UST, PWP, parental humiliation tactics; Draco and Harry POVs, alternating. Veela!Draco, Mate!Harry. Top!Draco for those who mind that (but don't be counting on it, folks, cause whose more likely to be laying those Veela eggs? Hmmm?)
It, um, added up, really. In Sixth he'd dogged Malfoy like a beagle, all righteous and suspicious and nasty-feeling inside. Now Malfoy dogged him—though he clearly didn't mean to—and Harry was suffering appropriately.
There are no sun signs to be found here, no symbols of life or hope or love painted or carved into the landscape. This place lays barren and repellant and Harry absolutely hates it.
Harry bit his lip and jotted down a highly probable interpretation of a not-uncommon runic sequence, before sitting back to ponder whether it was worthwhile to note as well the other, less likely translations. He hummed after a moment, satisfied with his work, and spent a stolen moment rolling out the tension in his neck and shoulders before taking up his wand to charm the parchment into an official departmental envelop and send it off on its merry way to the Post Room.
A radius of Magic spread like the inexorable tide for well over a hundred miles all the way round the three of them, drenching the Flower, the Monkey, the Dog, the Tree, the Phytomorphs and all the rest, even unto the Cat and the Paracas Candelabra. It settled slowly down across the greater coastal landscape, a fine particulate rain of Binds, Bonds, and Restoratives, a bracing tonic for the signs, marks and messages left behind by those who had come before.
"What? What, Hermione? You deny it? You think I'm joking? It's Malfoy, remember? Highly unlikely, okay? Not happening. Chalk—cheese—hmm. I might be hungry."
“I mean,” Draco continued, smoothing the curt edge off his voice, “how are we two any different from anyone else, Hermione? There’s millions, perhaps billions of people out there in the world who aren’t seeking to make themselves married and pop sprog.”
"Um…" Harry slumped back, flummoxed. "Ah, I. You're serious? I-I don't know quite what to say, Draco—I mean—I didn't expect you to…well. Well."
“No!” Harry shrugged it off, scowling. “Of course not pumpkin juice, Hermione! You think I’m mental, don’t you? Malfoy’s hair, obviously! Whatever are you on about?” He waved his goblet, irked. But then it struck him: Hermione wasn’t planning on becoming an Auror. He should explain his reasoning; it was maybe not clear to everyone, the correlation between Malfoy’s hair and the properties of Giant Squid territory. “Hmm. Y’see, Hermione, pumpkin juice is just…just orange, but Malfoy’s hair is all white-ish-silvery-watery-coloured and it gleams something fierce. Glossy. You know,” he nudged her with a prompting elbow. “Lake water.”
Draco, finally settling down and beginning to breathe normally once again as Potter landed his broom. The winning Seeker was carried off the Pitch by his triumphant teammates, whilst Draco scowled sideways and bleakly at his erstwhile mates—ungrateful soulless gits!—though he affected not to notice their ill-bred attention. The bleeding nerve of
In dire pain about the temples, Draco fumbled hopefully for the knob that controlled the level of the flames, as it also functioned to control the Floo volume. Thank Morgana for the mod cons an updated post-final Battle Hogwarts featured.
"Oh-gods-Draco!" Harry whimpered, and let himself be gone, be carried far and away and conversely clamped fast and immobile and filled with a boundless heat and great gouts of salty fluid. He was taken, and glad of it. The relief was immense.
“Nah, me neither,” Harry said promptly, reaching a hand out to lay over Draco’s. “I’d been missing so much, being abroad. Living in this flat with you is helping me to pay attention when I should, to you and to me. I suppose I really needed it, learning how to make time for me again. Being aware of someone else on a day-to-day basis, too. It’s been far too long since I did either of those things. I’m out of practice. Luna and I, we work very well together, she’s a dear friend and a fabulous Mage, but...it’s not the same. It never was.”
“But yes, darling. You could, is what I think we’re all saying, darling,” Pansy replied gently. “It’s that you may, if you choose to. Harry’s very much on board with this; he loves you, Draco. Has for a long time, I think, and likely did even before you started that thing with Theo. Point is, now you both have a chance to bring it together, do something, commit to something--but only if you chose to.”
Potter grinned against Draco's throat, that secretive twitch of the lips he had, a smirk which should have sat oddly on his features, really, but didn't. Draco knew this because the rapidly heating and quite damp skin of his abused throat registered the movement of Potter's mouth. He sniffed in response and elevated his chin sharply; he didn't appreciate the unsolicited amusement, especially when this business was already sufficiently uncomfortable to broach. Perhaps entirely too uncomfortable. Perhaps some other time and occasion might be better?
me, Harry. And I love you. Don't lie like that! Don't do it or I won't be responsib—oh, sod this shit, Harry! That's enough!"
Harry snuffled his sly amusement against the shoulder he leaned upon. He was warm and nicely resting, wrapped in the wings Draco always whinged over—silly git; the wings were beautiful!—and completely sodden and soaked still with various sorts of stickinesses and stuck-on down. His arsehole was deliciously sore; it felt plundered and likely he'd be feeling it still on his broom when they eventually returned to Hogwarts.
"Harry." It was breathless whisper in return; Malfoy turned to Harry's throat, lipping over Adam's apple and the straining cords of tendon by his pumping carotids, nipping until he reached Harry's sensitive earlobe. "Ready for me, now?" Malfoy asked, his voice a mere reedy thread, and Harry nearly broke his neck, nodding. "We'll go slow, I promise. Pretty Harry."
It was their first time, really. In a bed, that was—with no possibility of someone coming round a corner unexpectedly or accidently opening a charmed door. It should be…it should be worth every Galleon Potter had paid for the ring Draco now sported on his finger; the bright silver gleam blooded with a small, faceted ruby.
“It’s not a problem, Potter. Hate to see you not performing it as well as you could be. Matter of finesse.”
And then fingertips found his nipples through the thin Infirmary gown Madame must have stuffed him in and twisted
"Well," Draco returned, snippily, "You've certainly wasted enough time already, just getting here, haven't you?
Over nothing much in particular, too—a weedy, moony-eyed waitress and a stray Floo number dropped in Harry's in passing. Nothing that mattered, not really. Not as if it didn't happen all the time and to both of them, for chrissake!
“Yes, and?” Draco sent a searing glare over at Harry as they reached the landing. “It doesn't matter, does it? The technicalities of who's who and what's what, I mean. What matters is the practical effects, and in practical terms you do have a significantly higher level of sheer brute strength in Magic than I do.  We all witnessed that back in DADA. Flamel wasn't any different. There’s a damn good reason the bloody Ministry types tapped your fine Saviour-y arse to lead Mysteries. Now shut it and come along, because I need you to use it, all you’ve got. It’s either that or I do a fucking bunk this minute and it's my own stupid old Manor and I don't bloody well want to! D'you get it?”
"Why me?" Longbottom wanted to know. He clutched Harry's teddy bear to him defensively. "I'm fine, Malfoy. I've plenty of dates—"
“Grrrr!” His muffin paid the price for the indignity, instead. He crammed it into his mouth and relentlessly returned to watching Malfoy read the dailies.
"Sorry about that," Potter said casually, after a minute or two of companionable walking had passed, side-by-side, knuckles brushing now and then. They were nearly to the village; Draco could see the church spire ahead and the familiar flags flapping desultorily in the morning breeze. It carried an underlying chill—no doubt due to the snow lying still on the nearby mountains—but it was still pleasant.
“Alright. Yes.” He swallowed; his throat and mouth were deathly dry for some reason, so he hastily took another sip of wine, toasting Luna right back in as cheery fashion as he could manage. "Thanks, though."
? Stop talking for once? You’re humiliating me! He’ll be watching us, next! He’s not supposed to notice!”
"You don't know that, Harry," Hermione observed dryly. She tossed her head. "You're just being a prat about it."
Harry had learnt his lesson, though: never again let on to one Ron Weasley, demon git extraordinaire and possibly ex-best mate, depending, his own small fascinations with the actual persons of their fellow students, no matter how pretty or noteworthy. Only woe and mayhem resulted.
“Piss off, you, I’m fine.” Harry frowned at the clutter on the drinks table as if it offended him and then caught up the half-emptied bottle in his free hand. He eyed the others like a hawk, tilting his chin at them and looking very predatory. “Marvellous; couldn't be better. Ah! I’ll just bring this along, shall I?" He tucked one of Draco's offerings under his arm, thinning his lips. "Yes, this one as well; ta, Draco. Let's eat, shall we? While we have the chance,” he added darkly, directing a vague glare upwards and yon, presumably at the 'situation' he'd just come from. "And I'm not 'harried', you git. I'm irked. There's a definite difference."
“No! Of course I'm not in danger. It's my own house, isn't it? And don't be a berk. You and your bloody ‘I’ll have to kill you’ speech, Potter.” Draco shook his head in mock disdain. “So passé. Of course I shan’t say anything about your secret promotion to anyone; I barely leave the Manor. Who would I even tell?” He blinked fast, considering, and then gave a sharp nod. “Ah! Maybe that’s the problem! No one
“This is Ancient Magic. It’s as old as your eldest of Runes, Potter, and that’s why none of the more modern spells and charms work on it. You simply have to cast your Unspeakable version of Finite or whatever it you people use to contain those wily old buggers, the Old Ones?”
F’r'nstance, Harry had never known before he found ‘angular’ attractive. That ‘git’ could be ‘fit’; that sharp-slicing glances and double-entendres could Summon his poor innocent blood into galloping wild-Beast through his body. That the bland colourless-colour of grey could make his cock stand up so bloody fast his flies literally hurt him, binding his ciculation. Against his will, sometimes, that happened—like in Potions or DADA. But mostly not.
"Er." Draco, who seldom blushed and especially not before his own parents, eyed his formidable Mum warily. Had his guilty fascination with Potter been that apparent all along? So blatently obvious even his own mother could see it plainly? How—how bloody humiliating! How…lowering. He hung his head, shamed and at a slight loss. He'd rather expected this to be more difficult, his confession. It was disconcerting that it wasn't. "Ah. Ah…hem. R-Right. I s'pose it has, hasn't it? A bit."
"No." Harry closed his eyes, relieving Draco of a little of his innate intensity. “Listen. I was thinking about what you said, earlier, and I think you’re in the right of it. It's not only me, with you. I think it is interfering with me finding someone to be with, my work. I’m only still...I’m only still me, though. You know? There’s not a lot special about me, other than I suppose the Voldemort years, but they're well past, thank Merlin, and I can't even share the fun parts of what I do for a living with my friends, much less anyone I care to chat up. Makes it a very ineffective, the chatting up part. Telling some fit bloke or bint you’ll have to kill them if you make a stupid slip about how you earn your Galleons puts a bloody damper on the whole process. And I don't know that I care much for just shagging, alright? I like to know a person.”
. He'd no help from Harry's mates or his own. But he'd found him, at long last, and he wasn't about to let his quarry go. Not now. Not like this. "Harry!"
marrying you, Potter," Draco insisted flatly. "Not Bonding. Never, ever, not in this lifetime. Not like that. Not."
“Alright there, Hermione? You don’t look so hot,” he enquired. “Want a whack?” She was red-cheeked, damp-browed and panting. Partial asphyxiation was never a good thing; blue was not Hermione’s best colour palette. “Um, something go down the wrong pipe, then?”
, not at all! There'd evidently been a Glamour of sorts cast on the counter case, because a closer look revealed the finest grade of silver wrought with exquisite artisanship, set with jewels as rare and valuable as any of the ones Draco's mother boasted of in her collection.
“Inconvenient?” Draco scoffed, folding his arms across his chest and radiating a species of low-key fury. “It’s bloody dangerous, is what it is! What if you weren’t here, in the office, Potter? What if you skived off to the pub or something--not that
, at least. My bloody arse, as if that's special!" Harry laughed again, bitterly, shortly, cut off abruptly as he turned accusing eyes upon his rapt audience and really got down to it, no holds barred. "You know what? Actually, you're the whore in this picture, Draco, not your bloody pal Zabini. An attention-seeking whore. You like people's notice, you seek it out, go looking. Think it's great. Think it's super. " He huffed, snapping his teeth in patent disgust. "
"What?" Draco was irritated with Potter's rudeness; he was speaking, wasn't he? Not the thing, just trampling over someone's thought process like a bloody hippogriff in an apothecary!
"No!" It wasn't. Harry was familiar with lust. With want and fancies and sexually-based attraction. Certainly all of these were present, right here in this room they shared the cost of renting every other night, like bloody clockwork. "No—that's not it."
Fucking Malfoy had forced him to grow up, the sod. Harry wasn't sure he was grateful for it. Oh, for the halcyon days of wondering whether Ginny might take pity on him and give him a free snog, since he was an orphan. He's been so naïve then, but now…now he wasn't, not about a lot of things.
"Draco!" Harry looked momentarily taken aback at Draco's vehemence. He scowled, just a bit, and his gaze turned cautious. Judging. "Draco…really! Uncalled for, alright? She's just…she's a bit at loose ends, now. Spare a little pity, yeah?"
Harry, in marked contrast to his former flat-mate, was clean and well dressed and smelt very good. And he was deathly calm now that he wasn't giggling like a mean schoolgirl up his damned sleeve.
“I didn’t, but I believe…there’s loads, yet.” Harry gave Malfoy an affectionately sloppy smack right on his nose, the wanker. “Loads of time yet to come, and I’ll have more of it, I shouldn’t wonder, than
Draco pursed his lips, tilting his head quizzically as he reached out a hand to tug the top folder over to his side of the blotter.
His mirror assured him he was ‘fabulous, darlink!’ and a ‘bloody natural, ducks!’ His mirror assured him he was suave and a smooth talking, high-stepping young thing with a very bright future. It also informed him his arse was a marvel, but that wasn’t important now.
“Shut up, you two!” Draco hissed, eyes narrowing in temper behind the omniculars. “Be quiet! If you can’t appreciate this, at least be still about it—I’m trying to
“Oi!” Pansy barked. “Draco! That wasn’t nice! No setting my knickers on fire and no lame double entendrés; I’m far too chilled to insult you properly in return, darling. It’s not fair.”
“No clue,” Harry replied shortly, reseating himself before his horrible blotter and whipping out his quill, a distinct air of the business-like and professionally keen pouring off his aura. “Bugger’s gone off the map, damn him. However--”
“We shall have to cast, then,” Millie nodded, gathering up her wrapper and her emptied cup though unfortunately leaving the pile of work right where she’d deposited it, square on Harry’s desk. “Some time today, I should think. Though I’m not sure how you’ll fit it in, what with your schedule. Minister’s been sending memos down, asking for an appointment, and Granger’s been banging away at my door daily, wanting to know when you can be freed up again for a long luncheon. I’ve put them all off, just as you’ve asked, Harry, but I can’t for much longer.”
“Hmm. Harry, Draco. Have you considered just giving them what they want, you two? I mean, it’s not the end of the world to have a child.” She thumbed over her shoulder, smiling, indicating Ron amusing Rosie out in the back garden, clearly visible through the glass doors leading out to the welter of assorted greenery. She narrowed her eyes upon Draco in particular, and smiled toothily. “For example. Pansy is always telling me you dote on the twins, Draco, and I know you’ve been incredibly good with Teddy; Andromeda never stops singing your praises. Rosie is head o'er heels for you, always, and don't think I don't realize that feeling is mutual, alright? So. I’d think
"…Sorry," he murmured, glancing away, for he knew he was mucking up, more than a little. Time for the dénouement then, the killing blow. "I, uh—I brought you this." He popped open the tiny box and rare gems and diamonds blazed in the reflected firelight, dazzling both of them momentarily.
Cackling gleefully, Malfoy closed the small distance between them, leaning down and right into Harry, effectively smashing his captive into the stained work surface of the table they both stood at. Snape’s perpetual detentions had one very bright facet, though: appointed daily shagging, eight to ten, every evening, in an almost always deserted Potions Lab. Ex-Headmaster Snape, once again Potions Master Snape, as he now had a life, was off elsewhere, likely in the Staff Room or perhaps even Hogsmeade, having himself one. Often Harry thought he just issued these detentions out of ingrained habit, as there seemed not much real rancor involved. Either that or he needed help cleaning up the laboratory.
want a baby,” Luna announced cheerily. “With Rolf, I think. He’s quite acceptable. Oh, and I need to find another place to live, I also think. Dad’s got this inopportune habit of surprising us. Perfectly alright, really, but Rolf’s a bit spooked.” She tapped a reflective fingertip to her chin. “Hmm, perhaps two. Babies.”
The concentrated magic, the essence, it will build and build, deepen and root, till the carven rocks are penetrated beneath their desert patina and the grooves and smears and etchings shimmer.
“Oh! Hullo, boys!” Mrs Weasley greeted them cheerily, showing no sign of being at all perturbed by her sudden and unannounced visitors. "Brilliant you've popped in. Perfect timing." A host of Weasley family members and assorted guests murmured happily at them as two more place settings immediately arranged themselves upon the long refectory-style table, spare chairs bedecked with gingham cushions scuttling up with alacrity. “Couldn't have asked for a happier surprise, Harry, Draco, dear. I've a lovely roast joint Arthur's just carved. And Harry's favourite, treacle tart, for pudding after. Ready for luncheon?”
Harry, now irked in at least three different ways, noticed Malfoy was glancing their way, attracted by Ron’s commotion.
Waiting for Harry to come to his senses; that was it. Waiting for Harry to graduate Hogwarts and go out in the world and realize there were far better catches to be had than a relatively disgraced Malfoy Junior.
"You know," Parkinson was tapping her chin rapidly with a scarlet lacquered fingernail, her dark eyes alight, "we can tart him all up and round up some eligible Sixths for the panel."
"Can't do any harm, not at this point—and he might very well change his mind over the Greengrass girl if he knows you're the one sniffing after his heels," Hermione went on sensibly, ticking her fingers over in time. "It's possible, Harry—admit it. Draco likes power and you're a powerful chap, even with Elder Wand put away. There's advantages to being you—to having you to claim a bloke as one's own. He likely knows that; he's no fool."
In any event, Draco wasn't afforded the luxury of a spare moment to make any sort of move to call for aid, not even from an old friend. His foals were wildly recalcitrant, the Bees were irate and misbehaving and half of his precious films of the pretty nebulae had been ruined in a silly mishap and had to be reshot and recast, causing several more nights of mostly lost sleep.
Harry grinned, which sent his face into a crinkle of merriment. "Ah hah!" he exclaimed. "Thought it was something along those lines, Malfoy. You're so easy to see through, it's not even funny."
"The one book calls it 'Sea of Lube,' Harry. Just think what that might mean to us, okay?" He bobbed his chin, indicating the nearly clear surface of the table before them. "Work table. No people—not even a house elf about, cluttering up the scenery. Brand new Sex Magic lube spell, guaranteed to slick us up like never before. What say you?"
“Uh...huh,” Pansy replied, dryly, apparently not at all impressed by what was quite possibly the best single example of flying Draco had ever been blessed to witness. “If you say so, darling.”
At her irritated sigh, he did spare her a second puzzled look. Mostly, though, he kept the one eagle eye trained upon the mass of Malfoy’s hair, assessing it with professional eye as the angle of sunlight shifted, and effectively double-tasking.
Bloody Draco Malfoy had not been the slightest surprised by this new avid Harry. Oh, no. The arse only laughed up his sleeve and made smirking faces at him whenever Harry complained of the assignments he’d piled upon him. But he’d also helped him revise, just as he’d quietly aided poor Ron when he'd had to complete his final slog through uni-level Potions to obtain his desired degree in Forensic Magics. Yes, Draco was a bit of a contrary arse, but he was also a bit of a poser, too. Always playing it cool and then being just right there, helping a mate out, no fanfare about it. The utter git.
“Mmmm…yes, perhaps I do. A little.” Draco glanced off, diverted, gaze not really taking in the vague movements of the muted Muggle actors on the widescreen glass panel. “It’s nice enough there--nowadays, at least. But I’m also at Malfoy often enough so as to not feel homesick a'tall and I--I really like being here, with you.”
Draco had spelled both the rings invisible before they'd joined up with Weasley and Granger, out of simple Slytherin caution, and wishing, too, to keep the meal as pleasant as possible all around. Harry had said he'd wanted an enjoyable day, and Draco would do his utmost to make it so, Weaselbee notwithstanding. He would exercise great control; as it turned out, he needed every ounce of it.
Nazca was a source of constant headache to the informal association of Mages worldwide whose business it was as Conservators, Protectors and Creators of Runes, Sigils, Glyphs, Ikons, Graphs, Etcetera to do precisely those tasks: conserve and protect the remnants of the elders. Create new ones, too, as needed, although Nazca was not lacking. It was more the straying or careless Muggles, or the ones with no respect or understanding, than any Magical threat which concerned Harry and Luna this fine day.
Potter had long since vanished into their midst. Draco had a free period next, one of the very few instructional periods he didn’t share with Potter.
"Sorry, sorry," Hermione murmured as she dug through her bottomless bookbag, but clearly she wasn't at all 'sorry'. Harry scowled, going up on an elbow, and quite carefully not staring at Malfoy. It was enough that he could smell him; he didn't need to add to his misery by considering just how close Malfoy was to him at the moment.
"Er?" Potter wriggled a bit in Draco's grip, trying to get a decent look at Draco's burning cheeks and perhaps lip-read as well, because that last request of Draco's had come out all at once, without Draco's volition, and gods, but he was so very—
"Did we?" He was chuckling as well, and it seemed as he couldn't stop. Nor did he want to. "Did we really, Draco? The exact…?"
is my Prime Source, you know, and I can't exactly be asking...so I've muddled along as best as I can. And it's in parts, because I'm a ruddy tease and I'm trying to decide whether the boys will shag or whether they won't yet...[grins at you all, with shiny Tiger teeth, snarkily.]
"The other spell I came across, of course." His expression was a lovely combination of mischievous and winning as he leant closer. "It's whiz-bang, Harry. " He grinned, full out, like a joyful toddler over a brand new toy. "Guaranteed you'll like it, absolutely." Harry smiled too; couldn't seem to help himself…till Draco went and ruined it all by smirking again. "And, hey—was nice save there, Auror Trainee Potter. I was beginning to wonder about you."
Was it Harry's imagination or was Draco's finger shaking? He seemed pale, even for his snowy-skinned standard. And he wouldn't look Harry in the face again, the prat. Kept his eyes on the little box before him, and seemed content to watch his own digit, dancing in the whisper of air layered above the wrapping and riband.
Harry couldn’t stand it. Really. He was jealous, he admitted. Couldn’t bear the thought of further invasion of what was undeniably his to stake out and stand over, howling. That expanse of pale skin between the jut of Draco’s hips was
. Pah! Even if Harry couldn't materially assist, at least there would be the blessed relief of having a comfortable rant in the company of a dear old friend.
, which was one of Harry's favourites. And consumed his share in solitary splendour, too…cursing all the while.
"I see you," he whispered when Harry at last made another slight noise, like a 'pfft!' or a fond soundless scoff, but ever so softly it was almost nearly inaudible, and there was only disbelief hanging solemn, dark and cloudy, growing fast in the tiny space between their lips. "How can you think I don't? I always see you. I only ever see you—that's the worst bit of this, the utter worst. But, what? What, Harry? What did I do that was so fucking wrong? Why is it I can never--when I've always, always—and you. You, Harry. Harry."
"No, no," Draco chuckled breathlessly, and fiercely remonstrated himself internally not to spring up and start pacing about Harry's office. "It's not serious, but then again it
"Well, there's your answer, Harry," Draco murmured, rolling his head on his shoulders to crack his neck and sprawling all over his chair as it was clear no one was about to reprimand them for proper comportment. "Seemed pretty dead to me, before. And if Pruney Pince has already booked off for the evening, then logically so did all the rest, right? Stands to reason. Likely the entire floor's cleared out."
“Yes! But I’m counting on you to help me, Potter. You must have learnt something useful in all those secret courses you took and couldn't tell me about. And I know Hermione’s been Owling you advice about Grimmauld Place and its troubles--at least enough to ameliorate them. Well, now’s the time to show
"Would you look at that, Draco?" Harry grabbed at his lover's shoulder and jiggled it urgently, pointing rudely off at the corner champagne fountain. He didn't seem to notice Draco was in the classic position of The Lover, Approaching the Culmination of a Proper Courtship. Draco snorted darkly. "Merlin! And—and—is that a chocolate one, too?
"Aft-after!" Malfoy was eating Harry's skin on his neck; chomping down by mouthfuls, leaving welts and bruises, purpling and stinging with warm wet. His voice was muffled but extraordinarily insistent. "Later! Harry!"
All except for that one 'right' person...who was so clearly all 'wrong' for Harry. Or at least completely, miserably
The voice in Harry's head was tranquil and serene. Harry grinned, for the cock quivering deeply within him was decidedly not; it took breath clean away. He could only shudder as Draco lunged up, flexing his thighs beneath Harry's bum.
"Well, we could just ask Pince. In fact, why don't we? Save heaps of time, asking. She still about, Draco?"
was exquisite and Harry couldn’t help but be fascinated; he’d never in his life seen something—someone—so beautiful.
“I’ll tell you!” Draco rolled his eyes madly. “It was the last straw, is what. I was coming up to my suite this morning after breakfast and it did the usual thing it’s been doing, the Manor, what with realigning itself and sending me off to the Nursery, right? Like I told you. Well, I didn't, but I meant to.”
"Yes. Arse up, berk, and bite hard on that pillow, will you? You'll be walking quite carefully for the rest of the day, when
"Which one do you like, Draco?" he asked, his enunciation very slow and excessively patient, rather as if he were addressing someone mental. "Those are the friendship rings, Malfoy, there. And—and the other, too. Which one do you like the most? I'd like to give it to you."
"Fuck!" Draco echoed faintly. They were, indeed, and Professor Snape would be on the prowl for him, and likely Headmaster Dumbledore, too, as he'd bloody promised his first born in exchange for having Potter returned, safe and sound, by the last fall of twilight. And fuck if the waxing moon wasn't already visible through the grimy window.
"Please," Harry replied, suddenly eager and bright-eyed, and Draco centred himself, using his slippery fingertips to keep the way clear and unobstructed. Harry's arse was firm and springy beneath his palm and he wanted so badly to sink his teeth into it, mark it as he'd marked Harry's finger.
"That's not the point, Potter," Malfoy returned nastily, frowning blackly at his lap. "I'm not at all worried, thank you."
"Ah, darling!" His Mum trilled a gentle laugh in Draco's direction, obviously delighted over Draco's hectic facial blotches and attendant fluster. "You're asking for Maman Cecilie's ring, are you not? Well! Why have you not simply come out with it before now, darling? No need for all this obfustication, Draco. You could've simply Owled me. I'd have sent it off to you immediately."
"Next year," Draco was so warm and hard and hot beside him, their sides and hips pressed together as they eased their way through the maze of tables. "Without fail, Harry. I promise."
“No? Then it must be my hands. I’m told they’re very talented,” Malfoy suggested, winking, and to prove it, he gave Harry’s dick a few tight tugs. “See, Potty? Talented.”
“Oh! Hmmm,” Draco hummed, tapping at his chin with a long finger. "Perhaps..." He pressed a little harder up against Harry’s side, trying to bring him back to the present and out of the ill-tempered funk that had settled over him like a damp cloud. “You know, that’s not a bad notion. Temporarily, at least. Harry, what do you think? Are you game for it?”
Luna blinked at him, long and slow, like a friendly cat. Smiled fleetingly, raising her glass in mute acknowledgment.
to be coherent, alright? At least for a moment? Use words, Harry. Together—in rows, with punctuation. You'll find they're all very helpful."
“Tall, blond and fit, Harry?” Mills asked archly, plumping her bum on the corner of Harry’s desk and unwrapping her own in a business-like fashion. “Or tall, brunet and fit, like Ollie? Do tell me everything, holding nothing back. You know I care for you, darling.”
"Yes, so sorry, Longbottom, no such luck," Pansy echoed, sneering. "Now, as to when we schedule this debacle—I was thinking Saturday next, in the Room of Requirement."
He blinked and quickly glanced away from the place where Harry had gone to stand when he'd ripped himself from Draco's hands. He'd stalked off and was planted, feet flat, standing stolid and dour and staid on the familiar old worn down hearthstones, glaring daggers at Draco's puzzlement. Possibly because the floo provided him a quick out if he should want it. Possibly because Draco was daring to exist on the same planet as him; was rude enough to exist in the same damned room. Breathing in Harry's precious personal air, the stuff he didn't seem to care to share anymore, at least not with Draco.
, no matter how you've prettified it. " He darted quick eyes about, taking in to all the improvements in a glance. Harry must've had some help; he didn't know which on e the groupies would've jumped at the chance, but he damned well knew there'd have been someone—and the jealousy he felt over that was needlessly distracting. "It was your prison, wasn't it?" Draco went on, doggedly. "This house, and everything in it, back in the day? Terrible as that bloody fucking closet you grew up in, Harry—you said that, to
“Oh, you’ll never be indifferent, Draco!” Pansy cackled, fingers deftly feeding a new skein of yarn into her creation. “Of that, I am quite certain. But you will know, you will absobloodylutely know, and that’s a good thing. A very good thing indeed.”
Draco paced furiously, gritting his teeth, adjusting knick-knacks and such about their tidy flat, as his hands felt the need of something—anything—to keep themselves busy. Or they'd wrap themselves 'round Harry's lovely throat when he stumbled in and then Draco wouldn't be responsible for the mayhem that ensued!
"I know, love," Harry cooed in his ear, leaving Draco's chin go at last…and incidentally leaving dampened, pinkened skin and quite kiss-bitten lips behind him, too. "I do realize, really. Just, er. Just lean forward, alright? Relax, babe. I'll do the work."
The Seek spell returned but a faint eerie glow, settling about the forms of both boys. A little like a halo, quaerat aliquis simply advised each young Wizard the other was actively present, by limning the taller one's fair hair to a shade warmer than white-platinum and lending an inviting gleam to the green eyes blinking steadily behind their lenses. And by chiming, ever so faintly, like fairy wings jingling. A pretty little charm, it was one of Flit's current favourites.
It was a nasty pattern Draco couldn’t help but notice, especially now they shared a flat. Harry was a bloody workaholic, worse even than Draco--or even Hermione, which was saying rather a lot. Of course, he had an immensely demanding position and he never seemed to actually leave it behind him, even if he’d departed his actual office. He ended up every night upon the sofa, too often sunk in the abysses of work he brought along home with him to pay much attention to Real Life happening around him, no matter how good his stated intentions were. Thus Draco was of the decided opinion it was a decent thing he could and should do for his good friend, to remind him firmly of those little necessities. Proper meals, and social commitments, and the like. Breathing, perhaps.
"Of course you do, and you manage very well at it, but even so. A holiday won't kill you, son. Do as I told you and floo Harry, will you? I'm sure between the two of you you'll find some solution for the Manor's behaviour and then you'll be free to have a break."
"Hurgh!" Draco, in the midst of swallowing the last dregs, had his tea go down the wrong tube; he coughed, grimacing horribly behind a polite palm. "You-you don't say, Mum," he gasped, startled. "Really?"
“Absolutely this evening; count on it!" Harry interrupted as Draco eased gingerly back into the hearth, raising his hand preparatory to casting down the floo powder. "No take-backs, mate. I'll poke my head through yours 'round five, too. To remind you. I know how you get when you're all in, Malfoy, don't forget. A dungbomb could go off and you'd never notice. Sooner than that, if I can wade my through this Merlin-cursed mess on my desk. Same old Floo connection, I'm assuming? Brilliant! ‘Bye for now, Draco!"
Draco glared at them fiercely, but they weren’t cooperating with him by flinching in return, having both casually glanced away from him, staring out as one great lump of disinterest across the excited masses. Irritated, he turned his focus back to the victorious Gryffs, across the way.  They were totally barmy over there: all he could see was a horde of scarlet-and-gold, roiling.
It meant a lot; it meant nothing. Like a tree falling in a an empty forest, the sound was unheeded. The recipient didn’t—couldn’t—hear.
“Oh, yes,” Draco nodded eagerly, in full agreement. “Population. That’s a valid point there, Hermione. Wizarding society was all about increasing the ranks, from the very dawn of our history. Family is incredibly important to us as a society. There’s always been relatively few of us, a tiny fraction as compared to the Muggles, so rather naturally--”
“Ohmygod, this is so mindless! So—so asinine! You’re inane, the both of you! I mean, look! You’re actually fighting over Malfoy’s
Blinking and rolling with the drunken sideways stumble Apparation always left him with, Harry found himself standing on a huge sloping dolmen-shaped boulder, atop a number of other huge boulders in the midst of the Lake, and all of a yard away from one very sorry looking Draco Malfoy.
Draco scowled. Yes, he supposed Harry was sufficiently quick to deny Draco's stupid suspicions. But mayhap not quite fast enough to roust out all the seeds of darkling doubt that had sown themselves in Draco’s questioning mind. Though, on the other hand, Harry never, ever lied to Draco.
"What?" Draco elevated his chin abruptly, twisting in his chair, attempting to re-engage his ex-lover's gaze. "Blaise? Me, cry on his shoulder? What the hell are you talking about, Harry? Blasé doesn't even come into this, except as a bloody nuisance, alright? And I'm not going anywhere, not a fucking inch. Get used to it!"
Harry shifted his hips, adjusting his legs more comfortably where they rested against gingerly Draco's shoulders. Draco straddled him and leaned in so that their bellies pressed together, his lips travelling over pert nipples, raising a flush across Harry's skin as he went.
Betrothal ceremony he'd scrabbled together not even two weeks past, the arse, and that was more than good enough. They needed no others.
They'd been lured to the refurbished Room by a slyly shy Potter, who'd promised them something big, something major—a 'special secret' he wanted to share.
Or mayhap he was in the mood, and it was entirely inappropriate and it was all very awkward, even if Potter clearly hadn't noticed the degree of awkward.
“You!” Harry broke free of his momentary stasis, first batting furiously at the inoffensive handkerchief and then all at once whacking Draco on the sternum, open-handed but so forcefully he nearly shattered a mother-of-pearl button on Draco's pajamas. “Stoopid! Bloody! Git!”
“Kid?” Draco probed, turning dramatically on a heel and pacing over to the door and back again with a decidedly miffed swish of his work robes. “What kid is this, exactly? You didn’t mention any bloody kid earlier, Potter,” he snarled, bearing his teeth at Harry in a sudden gleaming flash. “Fuck. So. There was a minor present when we were Incarcerousing Snarlph and his buffoons, is that what you’re telling me? And this child had the gall to try and hex you, the Great Harry Potter, all unawares? With an age-restricted Truth Charm? Circe!”
"Of course not!" Draco agreed, scandalized. "Those people get very shirty. I should know. I correspond with the American MagiAstronomy Association regularly."
"Well, then. I guess we can shag in the Trophy Room instead of Hogsmeade then, if you wish—duing detention. Makes no never mind to me, Harry. 'Course, I'll miss those quick nips in to the Burgh, but—"
In no time she'd corrected course and was flying strongly once more, her lips set in a thin determined line and her eyes fixed upon the darting figure that was Luna, leading them in an ever-larger spiral about the sky till every last sacred Line was Conserved and Protected.
"Any—every—ple—just—more!" Harry was departed; was here and yet not here; he'd say anything, anything Draco Malfoy demanded of him. "I've—I've wanted—you," he gasped, the burn resolving into a smooth, rapid motion within him, Malfoy's hot breath ghosting over his nostrils, "for—so—long!"
Draco Malfoy—master of the verbal cut-and-slash, commander of snark and banter, the very epitome of all that was ornately verbose and pointed—stuttered, mumbled, gagged and gasped. Was completely inarticulate—was a right berk.
"Oh, no!" Hermione chuckled. "Not at all, Malfoy. Please," she gestured carelessly, "have at it. Harry," she added, turning to him as she slung her bulgy bag over one shoulder, "do
Perhaps this was what Potter looked like when he was happy? Draco wondered. If so, he liked it. Made him want to break out into a bit of a goofy grin himself.
"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry said quietly, clasping Draco's upper arm for an instant. "I wish it had been--"
being a jealous sod, a right old cunt, when you bothered to be, and then not even seeing, not seeing
Lucius Malfoy shrieked this through the Floo, his voice climbing the Alps in amplitude. His hair—long and palest blond still and
"Tomorrow," Malfoy repeated grimly. Thrust up with a sideways grind and Harry groaned his absolute surrender, the scant inch he'd held back in fear collapsing before Malfoy's demand. He slid slack into arms that gripped him tightly, and he'd not noticed this before but Malfoy was firm all over—a bloody rock he'd been ruthlessly castaway upon, and as obdurate. "Harry, tomorrow—and the next day—and the next."
"And not hurt his so-fragile heart-strings, Potter?" Draco allowed his heavy head to fall upon the Saviour's convenient shoulder with an equally weighty sigh. "What about mine, then? They don't matter in the slightest, because that sod Malfoy's a tough bastard and he won't be bothered by it?"
"Right, right. That one." Adrian—as he insisted upon being addressed—waved his mate off with a little smile. "Ferosh, yes. In any event, I'd have that sort of dragon, the Horny sort, all done up in magical marzipan, naturally, and then I'd have one based on your given name, Mister Malfoy—all silvery-greenish, I think, maybe with piping racing stripes on it—battling it out playfully over turrets of whipped lightly-browned meringue—"
What clearly was ‘very important’ was that there were actually some ginger highlights riffling through Malfoy’s hair as the angle of the morning light altered, now that he was examining it more specifically. The combination of pale torch light and the heady golden beams pouring endlessly down upon them from the high windows and the ceiling caused the odd strand to flare a reddish-gold, like molten bronze, hither and thither about the smooth cap of Lake water-coloured strands. The effect was magnificent. Highly evocative of the prettiest scenery Harry knew of: the Lake.
"So, ah…thinking aloud here, Harry…maybe, just perhaps, she's already popped off to her quarters, you think? You know how these older witches are: so rigid and hidebound—and you know what else?"
"That's not a yes, Harry," Draco chided him. He was jiggled again; his cock twitched limply in trained response. "Give me a yes, git. Now, please."
In moments they’d gained the fourth landing up, and Draco silently steered Harry to face down the centre of an expansive three-corridor split. They regarded it. The main hall led to various suites for guests and whatnot, the right led to all the rooms the House Elves occupied as paid employees and retainers. He cocked his thumb at the leftmost one. Which had once been merely serviceable, as befitted its workaday purpose as a repository for boisterous Malfoy spawn, but was now quite tarted up with pristine striped silk damask wallpaper and a series of rather impressively filigreed silver Persian-style sconces leading down the distance. A truly gorgeous runner overlaid the polished parquetry and small sculptures and portraits of antique Ancestors as Children were displayed in niches every three or four yards or so. It all smelt of lilac, talcum, honey and freshly gathered daisies and was just precisely the most comfortable of temperatures.
Draco smiled in return as he fiddled the telly wand, enjoying the drowsy postprandial atmosphere.  In a moment the fit Captain was again romping about the screen, exuding charm and sex appeal.
“Is it,” Draco asked carefully, cautiously reaching out to cup Harry’s shoulders with long pale hands, “something I might want to hear?”
"...Harry?" Granger finally—finally!—managed to squeak out a further response to the shockingly prurient events shortly to take place before her appalled eyeballs. "Are you—will you—I mean, it's really
"What?" Puzzled and awed, Harry twisted his jaw, wrenching himself away from Draco's overbearing, incredibly mobile mouth. Wasn't this all exactly what he'd dreamt of? Well, maybe not the verbal abuse aspect of it, but the kisses—the tacit acceptance? What could possibly be bad about this? "What's—why're you? I really
But all good things come to an end, sadly. It did return at last, in fits and starts—the world, that was—and Draco blinked blearily at Madame Pomfrey's white-painted walls and immediately thought first of cold revenge.
"Give it to me, Malfoy!" Harry ordered him, hissing the command 'round the edges of their sealed mouths. "Show me!" It was just like Parseltongue, the sod. "Hate me all you like, but!" And Harry knew exactly what effect Parseltongue had on Draco's libido. Rabid wasn't the half of it. "Give me your cock, you contrary bastard!"
, Ron, if I didn’t think it, now would I? Besides, it’s right there, Ron,” Harry waved his goblet of juice in the direction of Slytherin table, causing it to slop over the sides and soak his sleeve. “It is like Lake water, Ron…take a look for yourself, git. I mean,
"Yessss," Malfoy hissed, and it was poison in Harry's veins—the finest kind to be brewed in any cauldron. It swamped any lingering doubts; it ripped his reserve away completely and left him open to anything Malfoy might want of him. On the gelling thought he hastily spread his legs beneath the weight of Malfoy's long ones, wriggling about madly so he was able to bring his knees up and clamp them tightly about Malfoy's narrow waist, excess cloth bunching every which way.
He smiled craftily behind the cover of his wine glass, glancing between his two friends. Hermione seemed full of calm purpose and Harry was not shouting objections. In fact, he looked far more at peace and thoughtful. Which meant he'd ultimately agree, the silly bugger. Then Draco would have his comfortable old roomie back and perhaps some actual companionship in his evenings as opposed to the host of painted whingy Malfoy ancestors he had now.
fancy him, don’t you, Harry? I can tell! Wouldn’t be stuck on his bloody hair otherwise. Gods, Harry—it’s brilliant, this! First time you’ve fancied anyone in absolutely ages! Thought you were dead there, for a while!”
a Hufflepuff—but Mother had recommended her services highly when he'd contacted her with his grand scheme of romantic revenge against Harry. The git wanted to go sodding public? Well, then, Draco would ensure it was so!
With a few judicious twists of the Bakelite Muffling Knob, his Father's historic rant was but a dulled hiss of static, and Draco watched in discreet quietude as his sire's lips moved furiously but without much more than an infuriated murmur carrying over the distance. Though Lucius's arms still waved wildly about, along with his positively not-grey hair. Draco, happily, only caught every three words instead of shuddering through each single high-pitched virulent syllable.
“No,” Harry replied gruffly, looking about him for another clean mug and grabbing up the carafe the University Elves had kindly left for them. “I’m bloody well not. Hmm." Pouring out, he noticed Luna was alone at the long table. "Oi. Ichika-san alright?”
"But really, it's for always, Harry. How I want you. Want to shag you blind, want to hold you tight—keep you 'round me for always—ever…"
A silver stag sprung into existence, just on the edge of the circle of mayhem. It pawed the carpet with its spectral hooves, tossing its antlers as Harry's wish to summon Hermione was telegraphed telepathically. Then the deer skittered in a wavery, rather drunken way towards the exit.
In a sudden and blindingly fast movement they were ripped apart altogether. Draco's knees opened wide, his feet dangling, blond tresses a'tumble—and then they were slammed against each other's bodies on the very next inhale and their hardened throbbing cocks aligned side-by-side with magical precision. And then each swollen member
Likely it lurked unsuspected even in the more deserted hallways and public rooms, the ones Draco hardly ever had reason to visit, given the pervasive scents of talcum powder and sweetened hot milk which crept from beneath long shut doors and the preponderance of randomly displayed portraits of every single one of all Draco's multitudinous ancestors and relations, portrayed from the days when they were but infants and toddlers.
“Whoa there, sorry!” he gasped, righting himself. Instantly he took up a fighting stance, wand at the ready and other hand roughly shoving an unwary Draco behind him. "What's it?" he demanded, staring wildly about Draco's innocuously elegant foyer, his specs glinting in the morning light that poured through the transom. “What’s wrong--where is it, Malfoy? It’s not a Death Eater or something like, is it?”
“You know, Hermione, I’ve never made the connection before…” Harry trailed off, staring into space, his pumpkin juice suspended a bare inch from his bemused face. “But…”
Ever since the English Wizards had once again felt free to move about the larger world--or, to put it bluntly, once Harry had ended Voldemort’s reign of horror--the DoM Wizarding staff who concentrated on Runes in particular had re-expanded their knowledge of foreign Runes by veritable leaps and bounds of a Giant’s Boots. Even during the years Harry had been attending uni a global network of sorts had been sprung up amongst all the many Wizarding folk who were drawn to the understanding and use of the magical signs, sigils and glyphs left by their own local Elders. It was, naturally enough, not a new idea, but rather a reinstatement of an absolutely ancient practise that had been largely suppressed by the likes of the Death Eaters and their following. The Head of DoM, a Witch by name of Alys Gaenor, decreed that the Runes Journeymenship would also immediately be restored.
"What d'you mean, Malfoy?" Harry demanded suspiciously, his eyes darkening with the beginnings of anger. He might be in love—lust, desire, utter emotional chaos; whatever!—but that didn't mean he'd let Malfoy fuck with his heart. "Say what you
“Luna likes spiders. And, I must say, it was a pretty brilliant idea, you letting your house out to them, specifically,” Harry cackled. “Sometimes it just takes a fine mind, with a keen eye to detail, to come up with that perfect match, that match made in Avalon, blessed by Merlin him--”
He admired it, a great deal. It gave his heart wings again, the way Potter flew, like a bloody Cheering Charm, double-dose—or Felix, a whole vial.
"Filch! Please! Always doubting me, Harry." One corner of his mobile mouth tilted upwards. "I have ears and eyes too, you know?
Well, sod them! Draco decided, and barreled off into an excited recap. He had to share his glee somehow and they were right there to take t eh brunt of it, the gaspers.
"Three," Draco breathed, and the wisp of his breath crossed the table somehow, cinnamon-scented, and Harry inhaled shakily.
sunning, prat. I am—I am swotting, alright? DADA, I'll have you know. Not that it's your business what I do!"
…Except, naturally, Harry had been led on by his own inclinations—but that was a bit of alright, wasn't it? One should, after all, follow one's nose. Worked for pigs and truffles; should work for horny Wizards, too, yeah? Er…make that smitten Wizards. As this wasn't just about getting off, either—far from it.
“And to be expected,” Luna chimed in, sitting back on her heels and throwing a hank of trailing blonde tresses over her shoulder. “We’ve returned home at last, there’s an upset and botheration amongst our relatives and loved ones; nothing bad, of course, but naturally. The runes would be sending messages of peace and serenity in this case, Harry.”
“I know you did, and I appreciate it,” Draco offered up after a long quiet moment. “Appreciated it then too, even if I never said it.” He shook his head, not caring particularly that his hair flopped into his eyes, tangling in his eyelashes. He blinked it out, shaking his head slightly. “‘M’not so good with asking for help, Potter, but at least with you, I don't have to. You're always there for me, even when I’m not sure where you actually are, you know? And I--I’m there for you too; goes without even saying.”
Very amazing, really. Astounding. Considering all that passed between them before the death of the Dark Lord.
“Ummm, Malfoy!” Harry gasped, wriggling fitfully. “More—more, you git. You can’t stop there, berk! I need this! All day long, I’ve needed this!”
Some might say it was really a pity they were both so primed and impressionable, Draco and Harry. Some might hazard a guess that the Old Magic was a
Perfectly polished boot tips appeared on the edge of his vision. Harry peered sideways and up through his lashes, his chest thudding in instant reaction.
“No! No-no-no-no-NO!” Harry leapt up, shouting, and kicked his chair away with a clatter. He reached out grabbing hands and caught at Draco’s retreating form, yanking him back and round to face him. “You utter, you horrible, you beastly fascinating, you bloody charming git! Look at me--listen to me, Draco Malfoy!”
“Now, now,” Harry said in a soothing manner, turning to give Draco a reassuring grin although he kept one wary eye upon the entry. “It’s still for babies; it can’t all that bad. Just let me have a little look inside now and we’ll see what can be done. You can’t let it chase you out of your own home,” he added sturdily, hand turning the large brass knob gingerly. “You’ll see; we’ll soon sort it out."
that I love you, Draco…er." Not that he didn't stumble over that bit, gasping a tad and blinking rapidly. "Cause I do." Harry-deliciously—went beet red. Draco curled his upper lips and tilted his head, awaiting the rest of it with glee. "Er...a great deal. And have, too," he added, pugnaciously. "Since before."
see you there," Hermione, flushing faintly under the steady gaze of their fellow NEWTS-track student and ignoring her mate's latest little accident. Harry had so many these days, it was rather a running joke between the three of them. "Ah, right…certainly I can. Yes, not a problem. Hang on a moment while I find them?"
“Yes, well.” Draco coughed, bobbing his chin sharply. “You've seen it, we've cast Finite. So. I think we should, ah, perhaps now be--”
"Oooh!" Brown squealed, scrambling up. "Like one of those Muggle game shows Professor Peesebottom was lecturing us about, Draco? Is that what you mean?"
Harry sighed heavily, turning to Draco again, green eyes weary and dark behind the natty spectacles frames.
Oh, how he despised that, being thrust into a day before he was ready for it. Being caught short and being grumpy. Being half a person because Draco had already left him, hours back. In the night.
“Then nothing,” Draco muttered darkly, settling back into his seat and crossing his arms defiantly over his chest. He’d only asked for the purpose of diverting her; clearly that wasn't on. “Go on with you if you’re going on, then. Give me the life advice I’m apparently so in need of and let me get on with coping with my latest mental breakdown. Merlin knows we don’t need two of us in this state; Harry’s going spare as it is.”
Harry's eyebrows went soaring up in wonder, even as the fingers were joined by a third, all twisting.
his family—not till his father was either heavily brandy-fied and stashed safe in his private quarters or his mother managed to control him otherwise. Cheering Charm? More like a Stunner, maybe. Petrificus?
Rub it in, fuck it—how the world wanted a piece of him (them, really) and Draco had to put up with it or get over his own self or whatever worked to smooth these little incidents over. 'Cause unreasoning jealousy was so passé in an ex-Slytherin and besides, Harry wouldn't know how to cheat even if presented a bloody manual!
"Pfft!" he huffed contentiously, arriving at Harry's side with a flap of fine lawn shirting. "You'd think they never heard of live porn, Foureyes!" He tilted his chin mockingly at them as Harry grasped his bare hips and yanked at them gently, guiding him into position so his stomach lay pressed close over the spine of the couch. Draco's gaze narrowed upon the lost look in the Weasel's common blue eyes as he descended gracefully onto the cushioned tufts of upholstery. "Hmph!" he jibed. "Are you certain you've reached majority, Weaselbee? D'you grasp what we're doing here? Because you'll draw flies with a mouth like that—"
“Right. Yes. D-did you—did you realize that if you jerk your right wrist five degrees upward when you’re incanting Expelliarmus it’ll increase the spell’s efficacy by nearly ten percentage points?” he blurted, in a rush to spew all the words he’d memorized so carefully. Best to offer Potter a useful tip of his own, in exchange for a…a closer acquaintanceship. “I noticed you were going about it the old way in DADA and—and if you’re truly supposed to saving the world and all, Potter, from whomever else pops up to plague us all after you join the Aurors—you’ll need to keep up with the programme. I mean, it’s not as if this is anything new—this method. It’s all over the Continent; has been for ages. Scientific progress, yeah?”
"Harry, he doesn't," Hermione sounded as though she was hanging onto her 'reasonable' tone of voice by the merest thread. "He's not like that at all, this year. Lay off, do."
His Mum emitted a muffled sound arising from a particularly frightening species of gleeful femininity. Draco winced. He much preferred his Mum's sly matter-of-factness or her nearly preternaturally composed façade to this—this abominable effusiveness over his love life! Besides, what exactly could he say to that pronouncement? Because it did, rather—love.
Harry had always been a little excitable, of course--Gryffindor, what?--but he’d really settled into his skin and been far more at ease when they’d both attended Flamel. Interestingly enough, it was Harry who’d pursued the more heavily weighted academic course of Advanced Ancient Runes whilst Draco had opted for his childhood favourite, Astronomy. A lark, that, but one he truly enjoyed, and could bloody well manage in his sleep if he had to. Harry had worked hard, too, really putting his back into it. It wasn't every Runes Mage who was recruited in Fourth Year, certainly. One simply had to respect that.
Harry, Draco was proud to say, though he wouldn’t ever, really, not to his face at least, was a very good egg, and damned good Wizard to have at one’s back in a tight corner. Draco honestly adored the idiot and would very likely duel to the death any fool stupid enough to plot harm against him.
Draco shrugged and grinned tensely, showing a bit more teeth than he normally would with his old friend as he turned to face the heath floo. Harry’s prolonged fling with Wood during their latter university days had always annoyed him for some reason. But then again everything annoyed him at the moment, given his lack of sound sleep and his atrociously impertinent mansion, and this deep dive into Harry's past romances wasn't really the fare he'd been expecting, at least not on a first visit. His earlier pleasure at the prospect of dinner together felt all at once faded and dingy.
. Something about Amortentia, and how Draco hadn't actually brewed it. Something about perfume, or cologne, actually, and how it was really only
Perhaps, just maybe, Draco had entertained the fleeting thought of reaching out to Harry all on his own, without any motherly prompting, and then again, maybe he hadn't, not at all. He shook his head over the idea of it, shying away from all the sticky implications of asking Harry, of all people. But either way, he still wasn’t about to mention to his mother that that ‘fleeting thought’ had become more attractive daily. He could use a decent mate, right now. One who knew him, and wouldn't take the piss over his house going barmy on imaginary babies.
Draco’s face darkened. “Yes, and what’s so different about that? It’s basically the same story here, Potter.”
." He laughed, dark and sharp, so deep in his chest that tremors shook them both, as close against each other as they were pressed. "And what does that even
It was hard to concentrate. Draco felt himself fading in and fading out. To grey, maybe. It was hard to discern in the watery light tentatively creeping through the unclean windows exactly which expression his visitors wore most often: triumph or annoyance—with him, over him. The flat was a bit of a dump, now. Draco couldn't bring himself to give a rat's arse.
“But I’m not, am I?” Harry protested, finally unclenching his fingertips from the edge of the desk. He folded his own arms across his own chest, albeit somewhat sloppily. “I’m here, safe as houses, right where I should be, alright? Now, may we please get on? We have the report yet, don’t we? To finish and turn over. Peesely’s waiting, the old trout.”
"Idiot," Draco twinkled fondly, grabbing at Harry's crooked elbow. He tugged at it, familiarly. "Of course it is. I don't know what I was so worried about, even—
All of these last few exciting Potter-filled hours, Draco assured himself silently as they made their way down and out of the stands, had been merely a spot of very understandable reconnaissance on his part—and solely for the overall benefit of the Slytherin Quidditch team. He’d go to his grave swearing to it—really, he would. And Nott and Pansy should realize that, the silly wankers. Just because he was Slytherin didn’t mean he was above appreciating art!
This autumn term had been unseasonably warm, true, but no one needed to be taught in a bloody sauna! Funny how he’d not noted it before, the discomfort. Draco would make sure to complain of it, next time. Made it difficult to concentrate, all that steamy warmth. Lack of ventilation, too. Some poor sod could pass out and possibly harm themselves in the midst of repelling a stray curse. It was DADA, damn it!
"Budge up, now, then," Malfoy hummed happily. "Lubricious, and-and here; you ready, Potter?" he snarled. "
Harry happy. He wanted him to be dead-fucking-certain that Draco was the right choice for him…the only choice, the one that endured. For they'd have much to endure, Draco knew.
“No, git!” Harry protested, flapping his free hand before him and scowling. “I meant Malfoy’s. See him, up ahead? Nice and broad, there. And tall, too. Taller. Grew some more, I think, over the summer hols, the twat. Wish
“Oh! Of course!” Harry leapt to his feet at the audible snap of Draco's teeth, grabbing up his wand and tossing his outer robes pell-mell over one shoulder, already moving towards his agitated friend. "Wait! One tick; let me send Millie a quick Patronus, let her know I’m out for the day.” He faffed his wand about and the famous Potter stag coalesced in a winking, already pawing the expensive carpet it floated over and snorting inaudibly. “Wait--I am, aren’t I? Draco? Out for the day?”
"Oh, I am," Malfoy was all smiles; they wreathed his face and rendered him completely gorgeous. Harry, with blunt nails gently scraping the inner ring of his clenching arsehole, felt his mouth drop open in wonder. "And you're beautiful, Potter. I can't wait for this—have been wanting you for ages now, you know?"
Their helpful young Japanese scholar frowned and shrugged, flapping a hand in an ‘I don’t know’ gesture, yanking her broom about side-ways so she could face them.
“I wasn’t!” Draco sat up, startled, his cheeks tinging pink at the passing mention of his and Harry's one ridiculous spate of shagging. "I'm not!" He firmed his jaw, staunchly ignoring it. “That’s the whole point of this--this advice-seeking, Pansy. I am invested; that's bloody obvious, just as you say, and I fucking do well know he cares for me, but marriage, Pans--and kids! That’s all--that’s just--I can’t even--no!”
Draco, as was his wont, didn’t reply in words, so much.  He was an action sort—the kind who liked to be mysterious and cryptic. Wanted to be interpreted, like a Rune or a code or a puzzle.
"Hmmm?" Harry smiled sleepily. He was so very comfortable—wouldn't hurt to have a little snooze right here, either. Their private island was very private indeed. "I beg to differ, prat. You cry at the drop of a hat."
Harry did, in fact, shut it. Cease with the mad gabble. Well, mostly. It was more a muffling than a snogging, what they ended up with. There were teeth, Harry struggled, and Draco tasted blood as well as snot and salt and saliva.
Draco's shoulders hunched as they turned, presenting his spine and the broad beams of his straight back to Harry as he prepared to march off; the tendons that held his head at that trademark arrogant angle stiffened. Harry knew he'd been heard; surely he'd been heard, but…Draco was a stubborn arse and he couldn't afford not to say it again.
“No,” Harry shook his head. His interest in Malfoy’s person was nothing new, actually. He’d always been interested in Malfoy’s person, one way or another. Malfoy’s intentions, certainly. Malfoy’s height (superior to his own and thus very irritating); Malfoy’s arse (in contact with a broomstick during Quidditch, only!); Malfoy’s fists…
"Get on the bed, then," he ordered, and quickly clambered on himself, snapping his fingers to fill them full of lubrecant. Potter might blather on about only having half-an-hour, but Draco would take his time with this.
Harry leaned closer, till their arms and flanks were pressed tight together. The loveseat they sat upon was starting to live up to its name. "Draco," he said, warning clear in his voice. "Tell me louder—so I can hear you."
"Harry!" She swatted him, and it smarted, but Harry didn't care. It was par for the course, wasn't it? Insult to injury. "Harry, you're a bleeding nutter. And that article said nothing to the point. It was all Skeeter's speculation, remember? I read it too, Harry. Load of Thestral crap."
"Shut it, Malfoy—" An intent Potter barely paused in his explanation. "Look here, Ron, Hermione. We wanted to, erm, uh…demonstrate. Demonstrate—that's it. Um, give you some proof."
He'd never meant to have it end this awkwardly. He'd not meant to pressure his love—but then again, he'd read every clue incorrectly, hadn't he? Every snog, every caress, every smouldering glance: all misinterpreted from the get-go. He was a fool—and worse than that, an arrogant self-consumed idiot, completely caught up in what he'd been feeling and never sparing a moment's thought to what his Harry must be thinking.
Draco winced, waving off the offer. His stomach roiled at the mere idea. Raw oysters on the half shell and champagne had been his very odd breakfast, courtesy his heir-obsessed house, and tea, he was fairly certain, was for once not the great panacea it was made out to be. Ugh!
"No?" Harry was sliding; squirming his way off Draco's lap, and tearing his shirt over his head in the process, heedless of cuff and collar buttons. One or two pinged as the threads released and they shot off in various directions, striking photo frames and vases. "Mmmm, I beg to disagree, Mister Malfoy. I've a feeling I've tried your patience recently."
The cock within him pumped a few times, shimmying; throbbing and bucking finally as it thrust against the sudden constriction of Draco's internal organs; Draco felt every inch of it, imbedded deep in him, and was gladder than he'd ever been of anything, including the death of Voldemort.
Zabini, Harry—say it. And fuck this crap about you just wanting to shag—or show me off. That's laughable; I can't even think you'd expect me to lend that bullshit credence. Just. Harry. Whatever it was, just
Draco snorted and took hasty refuge in his wine, gulping down a mouthful so to avoid answering. Hermione was correct in her educated guess--he wouldn’t mind a steady partner and maybe even some children, one day--but decent relationships didn't fall off trees and all the good ones, the Wizards Draco would even consider as possible partners, were essentially taken. Even Theo, finally. Besides, it wasn't as though he really needed to have someone else in his life, no matter what the Manor had to say about it.
The urge to move was too strong to resist. Draco bounced up and out of the armchair and took a quick spin about it before making a business of buzzing over to the Picasso for a better look-see. He felt Potter's intensely concerned eyes burning like brands between his shoulders, and twitched uncomfortably under the intangible weight.
The grin that broke through Potter's undeniable anxiety was most definitely more welcome than any May morning.
"Never mind, alright?" Harry snorted; looked away from Draco's curious eyes. "Look, I only really only wanted to shag you for a bit; seemed like the thing to do to make it happen, telling you I cared for you. And you went for it, hook, line and sinker, just like I knew you would."
the direct and indirect cause of every single punishment he'd ever been given, both home and at Hogwarts. Potter, who had the most incredibly wiry, flexible body under those shamefully shabby clothes and nondescript robes, whose eyes were literally unmatchable, whose hard-soft mouth and agile, nervous hands delivered pleasure of a kind Draco had not known existed.
“Cut line, idiot,” Draco ordered frostily, glaring. “We all know you’re brilliant, and yes, it was likely the most sapient suggestion you’ve ever made in this lifetime, given that Luna’s my own distant cousin and she and Rolf are absolutely bonkers over having babies and they are thus the perfect--what was it Hermione called us; oh yes! ‘Vessels’, she said. Seriously, though. What better place to accomplish their goal than at a house hellbent on producing progeny in its unfortunate occupants?” he asked, somewhat rhetorically, shrugging and studiously ignoring his mate’s stupid smirking and hilarious awkward attempt to pat own back. “All thanks to you, of course. Do stop that, Harry. It's unseemly and you'll probably sprain something.”
"Lovers!" Granger echoed blankly. Weaselbee simply went white as parchment. "Lo-lovers, Harry? You mean you-you...?"
“Hmmm,” Malfoy hesitated, hand going to stroke his dick meditatively. "Huh. This causes me to wonder now." He tilted his pointy chin at Harry and mimed pulling an invisible beard, maliciously. “Nah. I don’t know…maybe I shouldn’t. You
"Darling," his Mum prompted gently, "you were saying? About your Harry, Draco? And Malfoy heirlooms?"
, Malfoy," Harry glared, tightening his grip on Draco's hand just a bit more than strictly necessary. "I like it here and Mr. Kringleshanks always has just what I'm looking for." Potter dragged him peremptorily over to a largish dusty glass case with an ancient cash register atop it, filled with an array of silver: chains, bracelets, necklets, rings and the like. Draco found his eyes zeroing in on the rings. For some reason.
. It's the goddamned truth." He laughed shortly. Bitterly. "Though I sure wish it weren't. And you, wanker that you are, keep on proving it, over and over."
“But how to--I mean, how exactly do that, Pans?” Draco appealed. “Call it a bloody experiment for science? Say we’re giving it a whirl? What? I mean, Teddy! Teddy’s going to wonder what’s going on, Pansy. My mum, and Auntie, too. We can’t just have a fucking affair! There’s consequences!””
"Hmm." Draco sneered, his eyes finding the evil awful image of Granger and Weaselbee, pumping and jumping, ruining the cushions on their own damned sofa. It galled him no end, having to see. "Right—
. Did you just see what he did there? That’s well nigh impossible!” Draco replied heatedly, his eyes fixed on his long-time rival—and possibly twirling in their sockets, too, to keep up. “Bloody impossible! Don’t rightly know how manages those tight turns,” he added, more to himself than either of his mates, his expression losing its fire to slide into the knowing gaze of the true connoisseur.
“Or you,” Harry shot back, opening his eyes again, his slightly reddened lips twitching into the slightest of grins. “Playing at being a monk, you are. You’re keeping yourself to yourself again, Malfoy, and that’s not so good either. Hermione’s been mentioning she’s concerned for you and Ron too. You’ve not dated anyone seriously since Theo Nott, not according to what they've told me, and how long ago was that, right? A year? Two years? More, even?”
“So, yes, meant to enquire before. Are Luna and Rolf are settling in alright at the Manor?” Harry asked idly, turning his head and opening his eyes to gaze curiously over at Draco. Draco blinked, startled, and stared back at his friend. It was as if the man could divine Draco’s thoughts!  “Hear any good news yet on their Happy Families front from them?”
"Ew!" Draco did his best lemon-eating impression. "Nothing of the sort, Weasley—calm the feck down, would you? Always jumping to conclusions, and half of them arse-backwards."
The Manor was just being really self-serving, Draco decided. Grimmauld Place too. Selfishly wanting the patter of little footsteps and offering no real solutions as to the actual acquisition of same.
And then that snog—oh, it rated very highly on Draco's personal Snog Scale, to date. Pity it was the very last of them.
“Mmm,” Harry hummed, blinking at Draco, his vision blurring momentarily. “True, true,” he burbled, nodding and gesturing to the poor unfortunate quill. “That. Gurgh.”
"Well…ahem…th-thanks. Super, Mum." Draco heaved a tiny sigh of relief; perhaps he could yet escape his uncomfortably antique seat without further maternal grilling? Maybe? "I will, then, Mum. Take it with me. Thank you."
? No, it’s not brilliant, Ron!” Harry thrust his hands out in a silent plea, scattering muffin crumbs. “You’ve totally got the wrong idea—and, and will you please just
“Stop it, Ron. You’re being ridiculous,” he chided. Ron was always jealous of Harry’s interest in Malfoy; hadn’t liked it in Sixth; apparently objected to it now, too. It was stupid. Hair was only hair. Even pretty hair. Like Lake water.  “See what you’ve done? Shut up.”
“Ngh.” To all intents and purposes, Draco was still very much asleep. Logically and ergo, he was…staying. In fact; demonstrably. Like a dog in its familiar bed, like a ship in safe harbor. A tower rooted to its land.
There was a moment more of rather noisy (what with everyone's elevated breathing and smacking of various people's lips) voyeurism engaged in. Then...
Draco blushed, something he tried to do very seldom, as it was such a dead giveaway…but for Harry, well. Well.
Could be bollocks, so blue they resembled nothing so much as overly large berries; could his nostrils, saturated in eau de Draco; could be his tendons, which appeared to have loosened and tangled.
," Potter amended, glaring meaningfully all 'round him. Brown kept hers downcast; Malfoy flushed faintly. Granger twiddled her wand in a meaningful fashion, staring 'round the group. "As agreed, right?"
"Wouldn't have offered it it were," Millie said smartly, making feet for the door. "Must beat the early rush, though. Cheers, Hars. Back in a tick."
Harry blinked, narrowed his eyes, sorted the facts and brightened considerably—all in the space of five seconds.
“Pfft! Huh, you're still here, then," he remarked sharply, whipping his sleeve back down his abused arm and casually taking up his mug again. "Not a dream." He wafted it at Potter, lips curling upward in a cynical smile. "I do actually see you standing here before me, in our flat, on a Saturday morning, in the flesh, proposing brunch at a café, although that’s bloody unheard of. Potter, are you feeling quite the thing?”
"Urk!" Draco had never considered his Mum might actually ponder his largely uneventful love life, much less conclude Potter was a natural for a starring role in it. "M-Mum?"
There was nothing he could do, either, to make Harry feel for him what he felt for Harry: no Love Spell that would last long enough, no Potion would be strong enough. He could but retreat, then. Find a nearby bolthole; sort through his stratagems; regroup. Do no more harm to what he held most dear.
"Touchy." Draco shook his head kindly, calmly reclaiming the ancient Dark Magic book and slamming it shut. "Such a little spitfire, Harry. I wasn't even on your case." A tiny cloud of black noxious powder rose up and both young Wizards leant away from it immediately, ably avoided breathing it in. Methodically, they went about summoning the assorted miscellaneous stacks from the floor surrounding their table, sending them over to a nearby return trolley. "Look, drop it. Let's just get out, shall we?"
." Seeking a kiss, for surely a kiss would realign those bitter-thin lips into something more familiar? A Harry Draco could understand again? "Harry, stop this. Stop."
"Git!" Draco snapped. He glared at his nemesis in all things furiously. "Jealous of what, exactly? Your playboy arse? That Golden Cock you like to wave about? Hardly."
“Ahhh!” Malfoy reared back and off Harry, clearly horrified. “No! No, Pusillanimous Potter, how dare you say so? That was a bloody low friggin’ blow! Take it back!”
"You—yours! Oh-ahhggh!" Harry's head thumped that stone, the one that lurked viciously beneath every picnic rug in existence, and it hurt. He didn't mind it. "Please—yours—oh, Merlin—Draco!"
“Stand over me on your tiny tippy-toes and menace me or something?" Malfoy didn't shut up; he kept on, wagging his finger at Harry in a reproving fashion and smirking himself. "Hah! You should have climb upon a footstool to do it! Hmm. Maybe you'll set the great huge Weaselbee of yours after after me? Or the smaller one. Ginevra's rather fierce, really. See? Terrified—just terrified, Potty-pot-pot. See how I am? I’m shaking in my loafers.”
“Really, Ronald,” she observed mildly, sending her boyfriend a mild sort of glare on Harry’s behalf and shaking Harry off easily. “You are a pea brain, aren’t you? Never know when to leave off. Can’t you see Harry’s narked? Oh, and Harry—pass the juice, will you? And ignore Ron.”
Three years. Three years it had been and still it was only shagging and meals in Muggle restaurants. No lie-ins on Sundays (Narcissa might wonder where Malfoy was; what he'd gotten up to all night); no strolling Diagon, hand in hand (the
"I should hope so," Hermione snapped. "It's the least you can do, Malfoy. At least have the sense to try out the basics first. An apology should've been the first thing off those lips. A real one, Draco. Don't fuck around with your sophistry; don't think you can slide. Because if we have to stop by this pigsty again, I'll—"
It would be…it would be the worst thing ever, Harry not wanting him. It would be…the Draught of Living Death.
Oh, definitely there was laughter  in Potter's tone, even if it was submerged and mostly subaural. Draco frowned harshly at the idea of being mocked, even fondly, and would've transferred that frown directly to Potter except that he couldn't see the git's face at the moment. Stupid berk hadn't lifted his mouth from its leech-like lock on Draco's neck and his question had tickled at bit when he asked it merely from proximity, which in turn only irrationally increased Draco's sense of ill-usage. It increased the swollen state of his dick, too, but that was also a thing he'd grown accustomed to, thanks to bloody Potter.
“Well, I should hope so,” Draco smirked, resettling himself into his plush armchair. He cocked a teasing eyebrow at Potter's relaxed stance. “I'm the best thing that ever happened to you at Flamel, mate; admit it. You'd not have survived without me, certainly. Appalling gaps in your basics, our first year. One would think you'd been raised in a--"
“’’Zactly, Hermione,” Harry harrumphed, vindicated. He frowned as he turned his eyes back to the object of his Auror-like observation, not liking her marked lack of enthusiastic agreement particularly much but not willing to waste time quibbling over it. On his other side, Ron continued to chew, eying Harry with high suspicion.
"Harry," he muttered helplessly, when the git opened wide and swallowed him down. "Harry…" he whispered, and nearly cried from the sheer beauty of this moment, with Harry here, on his knees, like a bloody worshipper at the altar of Draco.
"Maybe it won't be so bad, Longbottom," Malfoy called out, finally prying himself away from Potter's clutches. "You may even enjoy it. Never know, really, till you try. Look at me."
"Shut it, Malfoy," Harry said automatically, and looked as though he were telling over his schedule mentally. "Wait, no—let me think for a half a sec. I've detention yet."
“Well.” Harry sat back down with a thump, watching the door shut smartly on its well-oiled hinges behind her. “Fuck, then. Be that way. I shall have to cast the divination by myself, I suppose.” He glanced at his unfinished breakfast and cooling coffee, then over the nearest heap of correspondence and sighed. “But not yet, clearly. Damn!”
you still? Because I’m not, obviously. Not really. Overtired, more like. You're perfectly right; I don't care to blub. Much.”
) and stayed innocently, absurdly sleeping, his parchment-pale eyelids deliberately shut so hard they wrinkled. Poser. Bloody snot, playing coy.
“Look, just please, please cease with all your idiot yowling, Ron,” Harry pleaded, two fingers going to his aching sinus. That made his specs slip and he irritably straightened them. “Because, you know, it’s really not like that and I don’t need you up my nose this early, arse. I’m only, only observing—that’s
"And I you, git-for-brains," a quite gratified but somewhat disgusted Draco made sure to announce loudly, both for
She sipped her coffee carefully, blowing upon the wisps of steam rising up from the blackest, hottest, most evilly caffeinated brew the Brekkers Stall Witch had available.
"—take care of you, alright? Like you should've been, idiot, all this time. You know, if I'd any idea,
Before First. Madam Malkin’s Robes Shop; that was when Draco had first noticed the glare. It had set his teeth on edge then. Now…now, it was rather…exciting. Potter came alive when he glared, really. Bloody radiated power like a sodding magical sieve, the prat.
“Fine, ‘just-Harry’, then you’ve gone bleeding mental,” Draco stated harshly. “You simply--I mean--are you? Are you really, truly, honestly telling me you want children?”
