Harry nodded, walked arm in arm with Draco under the invisibility cloak. He made sure they couldn't be seen like if the cloak slipped up and showed one of their feet and made their way to the Dungeons. Before they were even halfway to the dungeons, Draco stopped and faced the library. "Actually, could we stop in the library's secret place? I'd like to store my broom there."
Draco bit his lip; thinking deeply of places he knew were good enough for meeting at but knew of none that wouldn't raise suspicion. "Uh..." There were a few near the Slytherin dungeons but no, that's too obvious. "We can just meet up under a tree."
Harry was still thinking about whether he should tell Hermione and Ron about the truce with Draco, but also his sexuality. He knew he should though, just never know when to. He knew Ron would probably think that he had gone mental to make a truce with Draco, but Hermione would probably know sooner than later because of how smart she is. He also hoped Ron would accept him as being gay and pondered how Ron would take him to have a liking for Draco. Of course, Hermione already knew for how could she not? The brightest witch of her age nonetheless she was a muggle-born.
Harry could tell he was blushing by the heat rising to his cheeks and he stared down at a bowl of steaming green curry. "Please don't tell anybody," he admitted in a whisper. Well, there goes that secret.
Harry nearly fell off the chair as Hermione had startled him, but he managed to calm himself down from getting a panic attack. How can he warn her that panic attacks to him are common? Only when he gets scared. He gave her a weak smile and said, "Hey, Hermione."
Harry couldn't take this any more. He was blushing like mad and it was all because of Malfoy. He took a few steps towards Malfoy, grabbed his robes and pulled him closer into a kiss. he didn't expect the Slytherin's lips to be this soft, or smooth against his lips. It was a perfect slide of lips.
"About the whole thing," Ron said while crossing his arms over his chest and leaned lazily on the wall beside him. "Just letting you know I don't mind your relationship with him. And that I'm sorry for what I've said to you." Without another word, he left them be and walked out of the common room.
Joslyn paused it before it got to the intro and sat down on the cane sofa with her legs crossed. She looked up at Draco, not sure why he's just standing there, "Are you going to sit down?"
Blaise grimaced at the eyes that stared at Pansy, then they looked directly into his own eyes and his heart began beating wildly in his chest out of fear.
"I know!" Ivy says and beams at how happy her cousin looks. It's a real treasure to see her cousin in love. "So, how long have you two been secretly snogging? And where do you kiss each other if not in the corridors of Hogwarts."
A sudden scream of fright was heard, and the Ravenclaws heard footsteps coming up to them. They all whisked out their wands at the direction of the scream, only to find Sue Lie running up to them for her lives, still screaming and breathless.
"Draco, you don't need to fix your hair," Harry tells him and just as he says that Draco stops with a hand in his hair, making some of his locks stick up and it. "You're... how do I say this... Draco, you're attractive and beautiful just the way you are." Oh god. That just didn't happen. He watched as a shade of reddish-pink appeared on the Slytherin's cheeks. "Let's just head to the next bedroom," he added quickly while feeling the heat rise up from his neck to his cheeks and what came with it was a tinge of red.
Ivy looked over at Draco and shrugged. These names the house-elves are given are a little weird. "What?" she asks him and forces her eyebrows together. "I feel sorry for the elf as he has to work all day and night."
Harry felt his cheeks redden a bit and smiled back at the Slytherin. What a greeting it is to come face-to-face with the person who makes your insides flutter and heart hammer in your chest. "Hello, Draco."
Mrs Figg scoffed at the young immature boy who should know better. "I may not be your mother, but I'm sure she would have taught you some manners when speaking to other people," she said with a proud smile. "Now why don't you go get some gardening tools and help out your dear cousin. He can't do all these chores on his own now can he?"
"Yeah," Draco agreed with a distant nod. The manor looks brand new when every room is painted a slightly lighter colour than it was previously. It feels like they've moved into a new manor, or even their French countryside manor.
"There's no need to apologize, Arthur," said Sirius, shaking his head. "It was probably just a misunderstanding."
They entered a white hallway with orange, red and black circular patterned floor. There were black wooden doors on either side of them, the hallway looked as if it could go on forever. They heard a bang coming from one of the doors. It was door number 237.
Hermione nodded at him. "Ron?"
"It was a gift from the minister himself," Mr Weasley said, eyeing the tickets in everyone's hands with a big smile. "You see, he gave me a favour to do and in return, I got these free tickets."
He quickly took off his invisibility cloak and ran up to them, wrapping his arms around the blonde Slytherin and leaning forward to kiss him softly. Draco pinned Harry against the wall while kissing him back and entwined their hands together. The kiss was filled with passion, lust, and love. Everything that both boys wanted. As soon as they were out of breath, they pulled apart. "What are you doing here, Harry?" he asked softly through deep breaths.
"It's no problem," Hermione said and smiled at her best friend; glad she could help him. She would like to know what's going on in her best friend's mind every now and then though. "You can talk with me about anything, you know that, right?"
"Well, at least they weren't shouting cruel names at you," Pansy said blankly, staring down at her high heels and decided to take them off. They were starting to hurt anyway, and she doesn't like how crushed her feet feel in them.
He heard footsteps; they were entering the dorm room. He sat up and stared at Ron Weasley who walked in and looked to be deep in thought. "Ron," he said, still wondering if he's getting the silent treatment "Um... about what you saw earlier..." Harry felt quite awkward right now. If this was going to be how he'd come out to Ron, then so be it.
Draco climbed onto the bed and sat next to Harry. He reached for Harry's hand and held it in his. "That makes sense as I was also thinking that exact same thing," he said earnestly with a little nod. "I would also love to wake up with you by my side, Harry."
"That's true, I've been there myself," Ivy said straightforwardly and gave Lavender a little smile. Everyone looked at her in disbelief. "It's amazing there! There's even a magical passageway that leads to a muggle lake. It's gigantic. There are swans, ducks and all sorts of birds."
Harry smiled sadly at the thought of actually telling Draco what he goes through, which he won't ever. He doesn't want people finding out. Then he began wondering if they like the presents he gave them. "What did you two get?"
As soon as the hat finished singing, Professor McGonagall rolled out a scroll of parchment and began reading the names of the first years. After then, the feast began, and everyone dug in. And as the Headmaster told everyone of the events that are to be taken place at Hogwarts and finished speaking after the new DADA professor stormed in, everyone dug in. Everyone except one boy with dark hair and green eyes.
Harry supported Draco's weight as he moved to one side and flopped tonelessly down on the bed, drawing steadying, deep breaths in as he pulled his body back under control. He managed to say, "You didn't come." It wasn't a question.
Seamus and Dean gave each other lovingly stares and intertwined their hands from under the table. Harry saw this and thought it was kind of... sweet. While lavender, Goyle, Crabbe, Parvati and Nott were all glaring at each other.
Draco smiled and told Harry about everything that happened after he left the Great Hall, including his father accepting him, finding out his father's gay but he left the whole thing about telling his mother that he said 'I love you' to Harry as that will be something for the future.
“No need to apologize, Harry. Go and have your dinner. We can ssspeak again sssometime sssoon.”
Harry stepped out of the Floo into this dark, dusty and eerie feeling store. He had just Flooed to Diagon Alley but the store he was in seemed a little off. It just reminded him too much of the Dark arts with the skulls he was seeing, the creepy cabinet in the store, and a few other weird creepy items he could see.
Harry nods, a little intrigued with this spell now. It means that nobody could find out about what he does to himself if his sleeves somehow manage to push up. "Does the spell have a timer? Like would I have to recast the spell after a few hours?"
Pansy and Hermione used some sort of bubble spell and blew rainbow coloured heart-shaped bubbles towards Harry and Draco. The bubbles flew towards the two boys kissing, circling and floating around them. Harry ended the kiss as he heard something 'pop' right next to his ear. He wondered if his ear popped but didn't know if that was possible. He wasn't in the air or driving up a mountain, or in an aeroplane.
Harry shook his head and said, "Nope." Not once has he considered going out with someone in the past beside Draco. But he just doesn't think he's attractive or fit enough for people to like him that way. He looked at the blonde Slytherin next to him. "Draco, truth or dare."
Under the weight of Draco's scrutiny, Harry found he couldn't hold back. He ran his hand along the entire length of his erection, squeezing the dark red head between his thumb and forefinger on each pass until he was panting aloud, and his orgasm was imminent. When Draco's hand covered his own, Harry came undone. He felt his sac draw tight and then the come was squirting out of him, but instead of messing their chests with the hot liquid, it sprayed into Draco's cupped hand, soaking it in an instant, even as more pumped out and forced its way between Draco's fingers.
They both froze as the room they were in moved a little. The tunnel they were in with red and green swirls moved whenever they moved.
"Oh, okay," said Harry, and he lowered his gaze a little to look at the floor. He caught sight of Draco's shiny black shoes and gave a little smile. "That makes sense." He looked back up into silver eyes that seemed to shine whenever Draco blinked. It almost took his breath away.
"Oh, but he said much more than that," Pansy said, a mischievous smile spread on her lips. "Famous Harry Potter, his wonderful smile, intense but pretty emerald green eyes, lips that look as soft as a cloud, black sexy as hair and of course, my favourite and the most humorous, that hot sexy ass."
"Okay," said Lavender and felt excited about the walk together, even if it was just a walk around the castle. But a walk with someone you like makes it even special. She wondered if Harry feels this way when with Draco.
Draco knew not to argue with Pansy. Everyone knew it. She was right about the meeting with Harry. "Fine," he said with a sigh and stood up from his seat, pushing it back under the table. "And it's not a date!" From then, and watching a smirk spread across Pansy's face, he decided to head off to lunch after giving Ivy a sad look
Draco rubs his face over the bulge, though he knew it was a weird thing to do but he wanted to do such a thing. Besides, he liked doing it as it sent warmth all through his body and he could hear these faint sighs come from above him. He then licks from as far down the bulge goes and up as far as he could go without hitting his head on the table above him. He reaches up and rubs his palm up and down the material, seeing a darkened patch of obvious wetness where the bulge ends.
"I know, and non-taken," Harry said as he sluggishly was getting up from his bed and walking towards the window closest to him and facing the Hogwarts grounds. "But it is a good way to let time fly though."
-----
"Alrigh." Hagrid motioned for his dog to go with them. "Just to let you know, he's a bloody coward." And then they split paths after Hagrid handed Harry a lantern, as they walked the path, following along the drips of silvery substance.
"What are they talking about?" Harry asked Ron beside him in a quiet voice, and he watched as Ron shrugged his shoulders. He sighed and wondered what Draco was thanking Ivy for, and why it seemed important.
Harry was about to say something but saw Hermione look over at someone. He tried to see where Hermione was looking, and he then caught a glimpse of Pansy Parkinson giggling with her Slytherin friends. He watched Hermione sigh dreamily like she was deep in thought. He half-smiled at her, "So, Pansy is it?"
Harry dipped his thumb in the red sauce and quickly wiped it on Draco's forehead. "Simba!" he said with a smile and watched as Draco froze with the fork halfway up to his mouth, and the red mark shining on his forehead.
"Look out!"
Draco bit his lip and sat up, bedsheets still covering his legs. "Merlin, Harry..." he says and smiles at the bloke sitting beside him. "You don't know how you make me feel!" He just couldn't take this anymore. All year he's been wanting to kiss Harry and he feels like it should be now. He was alone with him, and nobody would be able to find them. He looked into Harry's emerald green eyes that stared back at him. He loves seeing this bloke with the familiar pink tinges to his cheeks.
"So, we were right?" Seamus asked him in a quiet voice. It was so nobody could hear them. He didn't think the Slytherin would want people to know of the crush he has on Harry. "Ye do like Harry?"
"It's alright, Ivy," Draco told her quietly in a soothing voice. Whoever hurt his cousin will be sued for life if he could do such a thing or worse. He'll make their lives a living hell. "Just take your time. We have all day if needed."
Harry smiled and knew exactly what he wanted as he wanted the same thing. To kiss the person underneath him. so, then he leaned back down, feeling his heart rate pick up speed again and the flutter within intensifying as his lips touched Draco's again.
Pansy was wondering why the Wizarding Worlds 'Golden Boy' suffers so much. What could be so bad in Harry Potter's life that he would harm himself because of it? Apparently, the rumours about him are fake. He doesn't live like royalty.
Harry gulped at Draco's scary father and turned to face the Weasley's with surprise, shock, and concern on their faces. "What?" he snapped. Oops. He didn't mean to snap.
"Here. Let me clean you up," And Draco was pulling away, sliding from Harry's arms and arse in the same pull. He whimpered, and Draco's expression immediately went concerned. "Are you alright? I didn't...."
Harry quickly made his way into Moaning Myrtle's bathroom and cast a few privacy wards around him. He walked over to the cabinet and opened it up, finding his mint tin containing his metal friend. Harry spelled the tin open, tipped it upside down and let the thin blade fall onto his hands.
Draco smiled as Harry was mentioned, and a longing fluttery feeling started in the pits of his gut. "What about him?"
Harry was waiting by the Slytherin common room entrance for Draco under his invisibility cloak. He needed him, he wanted to spend the night with him, he wanted his first New Year's to be with Draco. Do wizards celebrate the New Year's though? He hoped he wasn't late to see Draco but as soon as he heard footsteps, he walked over to them and saw exactly who he was looking for. Except Draco was with Ivy.
"Tied for first place with Krum," Draco quickly corrected. "Although I'm sure you can find some first years that would be willing to do all of your detentions for an autograph."
Ron walked up to Draco and pointed his wand at his throat, trying to be civil here but also brave. "You treat my best mate right, or I swear I'll hunt you down," he drawled. He watched from the corner of his eye as Harry emerged and stood behind Draco.
"I know," Harry said while nodding slightly, and he frowned. "Thank you, Draco." That charming smile Draco gave him... it was beautiful. He loved it and it made something inside him... his heart flip. Everyone keeps telling him that he can talk to them about all this, but do they actually mean it? Although he doesn't want to tell anybody about his crappy life. He just knows they will laugh at him and tell him that it's either a mood swing, that he's an attention seeker, or that it is a phase.
Harry saw Cedric on the train to Hogwarts, he was talking to some black-haired guy. He didn't know who he was but recognized him to be a 6th year Ravenclaw. Noticing they were holding hands; he couldn't help but blush. He started to wonder what it would like to have someone you like to hold your hand, cuddle up to you when it's cold, hug you and kiss you. Oh, how he wants to be loved by a guy just like Cedric and that guy.
"That sounds like a great plan," Draco says with a nod, agreeing with the change of setting and beds. He'd like to have Harry naked on his bed again but this time making love with him for what feels like hours until he comes inside of his boyfriend. He loved the look on Harry's face when he first enters his arse, and when he's coming in him. It's beautiful.
He brought his hands up to Draco's face and cupped his chin, he swung his leg over Draco's side and pushed him down, so he lay on top of him. Draco let out a soft
He loved his two best friends so much; they were literally like brother and sister to him. Even if Ron wasn't the one who normally would give hugs, Hermione was, and he loved her cuddly hugs. They were nice, much like Mrs Weasley's hugs. It was like having another mother, but one his own age. He would die for those two, even if their loving nature was... disgustingly cute. It was just love between those two, and Harry just felt like he was a third wheel. Even though he used to have Ginny as a girlfriend, he still felt incomplete. He felt as if something was missing in his life.
"I really love when you do that," Harry mumbles and feels sleep pull at him. He's never felt sleepy when he's laying alone but whenever he's with Draco, it seems too easy. It is easy. He loves how the Slytherin makes him feel and how his body reacts to whatever Draco does or says.
He even heard a few things about his Uncle Sirius every now and then. He grew curious. But what he wanted to know was why Harry never told him that Sirius has been fire-calling him. He would have loved to have a chat with his Uncle at times. Of course, he knew that whatever these three friends are talking about, it has to be somewhat important. But could it really be too important? Too important that they need to keep certain things private.
Harry took a deep breath and sighed. Here goes nothing. He just hoped Ron will take it well. "Have I ever told you about the truce I made with Draco?" he asked his best mate and watches as Ron's jaw suddenly parted. "I know it's shocking to hear..."
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr Malfoy,” Harry said kindly as he was meeting Draco’s father and he wants to make a good impression. “I’m Harry, Harry Potter.” Lucius’ eyes travelled up to Harry’s forehead where he saw the slightest bit of pink skin in the form of a lightning bolt.
They both realized they were still holding hands, which they did not mind at all. They both felt at home when with each other and wanted the warmness to stay with them.
"I love Draco, so very much..." Harry said, trailing off as he thought about his blonde Slytherin wizard boyfriend who gives him butterflies every time he lays eyes on him or when he catches those silver eyes looking at him.
Harry moaned and wrapped both arms around Draco's lower back, making Draco thrust deeper into his mouth. Draco groaned as Harry's moan vibrated on his prick which sent tingles up his shaft, to his balls and just everywhere. Harry could feel the Slytherin’s dick hitting the back of his throat and tickling his tonsils and the roof of his mouth. It was extraordinary.
Ivy looked to the floor and rocked back and forth on her heels. "Yes, I'm back and I have just been with Harry," she told him while walking over and joining him but on the other couch that faced him.
"I'd never poison such an amazing guy like you, Harry," Draco says and places his hand on the Gryffindor's shoulder, giving him a little pat. Who would even think of doing such a monstrous thing to someone? Oh, he knows who. That bloody dark Lord.
"Dare," Harry responded just as she finished asking him. He wants to at least play fair. Not just saying Truth. He knows Truths can get boring unless Draco's the one saying the Truth then it does get interesting and he gets to learn more about his favourite Slytherin.
"Thank you," Neville said kindly, straightened his tie and cleared his throat at what he wanted to ask the Slytherin. "So, are you going to ask him out or are you too chicken?"
Ron's stare at Malfoy lacked warmth from the expression on Malfoy's face and he turned to his best friends, feeling proud of himself. "What do you think we'll learn about today?" he asked his friends like nothing happened, no fights or insults thrown at each other.
Dean nodded at him. He will never tell a soul. It was interesting to hear about this though as he was getting to know this blonde Slytherin's other side of him except for the rude bully he was. "Your secret is safe with us until you do ask Harry out."
Harry finally looked up at Hermione, still feeling the overwhelming depression drown him to the depths of his emotions. What he needed was an escape. "Sorry, I need to go," he mumbled and then got up and left the Great Hall, not caring where he went. He just wanted to be alone. He wouldn't go to any of the secret places Draco had shown him, no. He decided to head to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom as it is the only place that he feels safe with his sharp friend which he really needed right now.
Parvati suddenly raised her eyebrows at Harry, knowing who the boy was dating. She really didn't have any idea how to react to Harry being gay and having a boyfriend. That boyfriend being Draco Malfoy, a Slytherin. Her parents told her that being homosexual was a sin and she believed them.
Harry just smiled and winked at his best mate. Shouldn't his mate know what he was talking about? It's very simple. "Oh, I'm sure you know exactly what I mean."
Harry laughed at him and said, "You don't get a whiff of the deodorant or perfume that the person is wearing when you hug them?"
"Wait, don't forget his sweets!" Narcissa said as she walked to the door and out of the room in search of some sweets to give her son.
Seamus and Dean both let go of each other's hands, finding it weird how they were found out this way by their dormmate. But they still sat close to each other. "Hi..." Seamus started, not knowing how to start this conversation. "How are ye, Harry?" His Irish accent was as strong as it always was like he just never left Ireland at all.
Harry ran a hand slowly along Draco's body. He stared at Draco's wrist, still bent up above his head as it gripped the headboard. Draco felt the soft press of Harry's warm fingertips as they drew over his pulse point and stroked the inside of his arm, stopping briefly to trace the crease of his inner elbow before continuing steadily over the silky skin inside his upper arm. Draco sighed as Harry's fingers combed through the sparse hair in his armpit and twisted his body instinctively into the touch. And then the hand moved lower, the fingers now joined by the press of a palm as Harry's hand travelled on, teasing his side, his thumb straying onto Draco's chest to circle his hard little nipple before moving again. Further and further it went, tracing the shape of Draco's waist and the ridge of his hipbone, letting the fingers stray down to caress the slight swell of Draco's buttock. The hand continued along Draco's long thigh, bent upwards and wrapped around Harry's hip. It finally stopped at Draco's knee and began a slow return journey.
Narcissa shook her head, "No, I like both genders."
Harry didn't look at his two friends. He couldn't be bothered to. If he made a run for it now, he will be sure to escape and not see them for the entire day except classes. Oh, classes. He forgot about that.
Harry blushed. He didn't know how to answer that at all.
Draco smirked, knowing Harry had just come in and had been staring at him. It was great getting Harry's attention, it's something he's always wanted and now he has it. "Enjoying the view, Potter?" he couldn't help but ask as he turned a page over in his book. It actually wasn't his book. It belonged in this room.
Lucius glared at his son; he knew he was gay but snogging the enemy in public? That was an issue and what he calls a 'Hufflepuff' thing to do. "Draco!" he scowled. "Un-attach your lips from Potter's so we can head home."
Harry entered the Great Hall, searching for somewhere to sit at the Gryffindor Table. Fred and George waved at Harry who was sitting next to Ron, Ginny, and Hermione. Harry gave a little wave back and walked over, sitting next to Hermione who was facing the Slytherin and Ravenclaw tables. He watched as Draco, Ivy and Pansy walked in and sat at the Slytherin table.
"NO!" shouted Pennywise, his balloon popping and covering Pansy in blood. Pansy cried, her lips parted and her arms in a 'w' shape as she just didn't want to believe what she was covered in.
Something pulled at Pansy's hair, she screamed and dashed away from the wall.
Harry gave Draco a kiss on the cheek, feeling his warm skin touch his lips and the scent of vanilla from Draco's cologne. God, he loves how Draco smells. "You know me so well, don't you?" His lips brushed against Draco's cheek, and he leans back to look into Draco's silver eyes.
Hermione blinked at him and smiled knowingly. She giggled at her best friend, knowing exactly what it meant. Oh, her best friend's in love! "It means you like someone, Harry!" She told him excitedly, her eyes gleaming with an inner light. "Do you have a crush on somebody? Who is it?"
His thoughts then turned negative as he remembered his nightmare. It was the first new nightmare he'd had in ages. He started remembering the nightmare clearly now. But, instead of his mother, father and Cedric saying what they had said, they were angry at him, disappointed and Cedric was shouting at him for not saving him. The pained words of his mother, father and Cedric were still stuck in Harry's head.
Harry looked towards the sink and ran his index finger along the sharp edges of his blade, whilst accidentally pushing his finger a bit too hard on the end and made it bleed. "Ouch!" he hissed softly, although it didn't really hurt much. It was just like a small pinch.
"Hey, Hermione. Do come in." Harry said welcomely and had been engulfed in a big hug from Hermione. He hugged her back gently but didn't feel as if he deserved them. Hugs were for people who needed and deserved them, right? Harry did not believe he needed or deserved them.
"Says the two boys who called me a muggle, whatever the hell that means," the boy replied ignorantly.
"You may go, Harry," Professor McGonagall said to him, but in her not so strict tone of voice. After all, this was a serious problem at hand. "We'll find who did this to you."
"So, uh... how are we going to fix this ferret?" Harry then asked as he looked down at his ferret boyfriend. The ferret squeaked at him like he was trying to talk with him. He then corrected himself. "I mean Draco." He smiled at his adorable and little boyfriend. "Well, hello little Dwayco."
"I... um," said Draco and he ran a hand through his hair. How could he tell Harry that he had come in his own pants and he wants Harry to do the exact same thing that he did to him? "Harry... I- I kind of came too. In my pants, I mean."
*****
"Oh," said Harry with a nod and he reaches for a few pieces of garlic bread for himself after he finished his pikelets some time ago. "I understand that. Is that all your allergic too?"
"It's so good to see you, Draco!" Ivy said sweetly, tightening her arms around her cousin in a bone-crushing hug.
The music recorder changed songs from old classic jazz and played 'Dancing Queen', by Abba. Harry remembers this song from one of Petunia's albums and music collections. She loves her Abba, Fleetwood Mac, and a few other bands like the Beatles. Harry's found so many albums that it's not even funny.
It feels like he has just got rejected which really hurts and he fucking hates the feeling. His heart feels like it has broken into smaller pieces and now he feels as if he can't breathe. He did his best to act normal and breath. Its all he could do. Besides, there was plenty of fish in the sea, right? In fact, why did he even think he had a chance with Malfoy? It was highly impossible. Nobody that perfect could have feelings for someone like himself.
Ivy sighed and tapped her fingers on the table with boredom, wishing she really had those tarot cards she got for Christmas so she can see if she will be lucky today. "Just kiss already!" she mumbled quietly enough so nobody could hear her as Ron and Blaise were talking amongst each other, and there was a little more chatting coming from around them and the Professor's table.
Emilie giggled. It was her favourite part now. She transformed her face into the face of a dead girl, with her eyes popping out of her sockets and her teeth sharpening at the points.
"Harry, what is it?" Hermione asked as she looked at him a little suspiciously. She pursed her lips in thought about what her best friend could be hiding from her. "Yes, I see that look on your face. What aren't you telling me?"
"Are you going to tell any other Slytherins about you and Harry?" Ivy asked him carefully though she knew the answer. Pansy and Blaise were sure to know about this someday. If he won't tell them then she will.
Draco's eyes seemed to brighten a little from the offer, and his smile grew. He's not really a big hugger, not even with Ivy, but for Harry, he would give him the biggest hugs as the Gryffindor needs them. "Of course, I would like a hug."
"Well, this is me," Draco said and looked at the blank wall where the Slytherin common room was behind. He then looked back at Harry. "Um... You mind?" He asked softly, gave an apologetic look to Harry and pointed his head at the wall.
Draco glanced around the corridors seeing nobody and pulled Harry by the arm into a surprise hug. He felt giddy as Harry hugged him back. "I might have said this already but I really was scared and worried for you today," he told him in a soft voice, and his breath ghosted on Harry's neck, making the tiny hairs stand up. "You haven't an idea what I would do without you in my life. If the Dragon had injured you badly, I probably would have jumped into that ring and fought it myself." He leaned away from the hug a little and moved his hands down to grab onto Harry's elbows. "You have no idea how you make me feel, Harry." He cleared his throat and smiled as he felt himself get so lost in the green eyes of Harry. "Oh, good job on the task yesterday and remember what I said."
As he opened his eyes, he froze, his lips still connected to Draco's. That beautiful face only inches away from his own. He blushed and quickly moved back out of the kiss. Cupping his hand over his mouth, he smiled as he has been wanting to do that for so long, but what he really wanted, was having Draco kiss him back.
Viktor pointed towards the Forbidden Forest, "Lets valk over here," he said brusquely. Harry went after him. The usual scowl from the Bulgarian has given nothing away. Viktor smiled down at Harry and led him out into the Grounds of Hogwarts, not seeing the emptiness in the boy's eyes. They were heading towards the Forbidden Forest, Harry still felt as if this were a trick but didn't care.
"Yes, Harry. I pretty much heard," Hermione said while patting him on the shoulder. Honestly, that was the most beautiful thing she's ever heard. Draco loves her best friend! It was exciting, but it was hard to stay excited with the death of Fred.
Malfoy nodded. Although that promise seems a little hard to keep. He'll find a way. He'll promise it to Harry. Before he said anything to him, he looked down to his shoes and sighed heavily. "I'm sorry for everything I've done too you and your friends," he looked back up at Harry, into those breathtakingly green eyes and his eyebrows gathered in. "If I could go back and change what I've said and done I would have." He asked him for his hand in friendship, just like he did in his first year, but he had a feeling Potter wouldn't reject him again.
"My godmother, pansy," said Nick.
Draco gave the present to Hedwig and watched her fly away with it. Harry rested his head on Draco's shoulder as he watched Hedwig fly off towards the South. They both turned to face each other and kissed each other with passion when the beautiful sunset shone through the valleys of the mountains.
"Write to me, or owl, or just connect with me somehow?" Joslyn asked him and was blinking back tears. She didn't want to have to say goodbye, but now that she knows that Draco's back in the right hands, she knew she had to.
"But professor, haven't you ever been in love?" asked a young girl with golden-brown hair, and her arms were around a girl her age but with Strawberry Blonde hair colour. She was leaning her head on her girlfriends' shoulder with a smile.
"Don't mention it, Draco," Harry says and looks behind him at Draco combing his hair by using his fingers. Honestly, so the compliments were worth nothing to him even if he spoke with his heart and mind. He shook his head and looked ahead of him. "Let's see Godric's bedroom."
Ivy drew her lips back and nibbled on the clit gently. Lavender drew her legs up. Ivy could feel them shaking and knew she wasn't going to hold on for much longer. Lowering herself a bit more, she stroked Lavender's dripping opening with the tip of her tongue. A shaky hand dug itself into Ivy's black hair, Ivy hissed a little when Lavender tugged. Lavender must have heard Ivy's discomfort and eased up in her tearing Ivy's hair out. Feeling better and wanting more of Lavender's sweet juice, Ivy dove her tongue into the Gryffindor's fanny. She tastes too sweet.
Harry nodded slowly, taking another bite of the green apple. "Yeah, I'm fine," he said and gave them a smile just so they wouldn't worry anymore. "I was just... thinking."
Harry was too tired to laugh at the dress robes that looked so Victorian styled and definitely like a girl's dress. Sometimes he feels so sorry for Ron, but at least he has a family. "Ron, I can just buy you some dress robes."
Harry looked directly up at Draco, asking himself if he heard wrong. Did he hear what he thought was a compliment and a very sweet one? Or did he think he heard what he wanted Draco to say? "Pardon?"
"Food it is," Joslyn said with a little sigh, grabbing Draco and putting him back on her bed away from her laptop. She then walked out of her room to the kitchen to grab a piece of ham for Draco and an apple for herself.
Mad eye moody smirked at the boy and made the spider flew towards himself, landing on his desk. "Ah, it seems we have a celebrity in the classroom. Harry James Potter."
Harry gave a laugh, knowing that was true. "That's for sure." But that woman he saw in Twilfit and Tattings who he now knew was Draco's mother, she didn't look like the type of person who would say negative things about blood status.
"The invisibility cloak explains a lot too," said Draco and smiles at Harry's rosy cheeks. So attractive... "No wonder you've been never been caught wandering around the castle at night. Except for the time in the first year... Wait... The barmy shrieking shacks! You little... That snowball hurt you know!"
Harry smiled a little and felt the heating sensation rise from his chest and up to his cheeks. Following the sensation was a blush that appeared on his face. "You saw that?" he asked shyly and rubbed at his forearm. He didn't even recognize the pain from doing that as he was distracted by Draco's looks and had him on his mind.
"Well?" Hermione asked, intrigued. "Who is he?"
"We're sorry that happened to you, Harry," Draco said while distractingly brushing a strand of Harry's Raven coloured locks out of his eyes. He was right, Weasel didn't take it well when Harry came out.
Harry nodded and looked back up into warm grey-brown eyes. And another lie he must tell but he ought to keep it all inside him so nobody could find this broken boy. He will keep lying for as long as he can until... He doesn't know and will make sure everything stays bottled up inside himself. "I'm fine." The lie he keeps telling everyone, but he is used to it now.
In a matter of minutes, Narcissa came back through the kitchen wearing muggle jeans with a dark purple turtleneck sweater and black heeled boots.
Harry contemplated for a moment, and then looked beside him at Draco and poked his boyfriend on the shoulder. "What would you like for dinner, Honey?" he asked the Slytherin next to him and with his free arm, leaned his elbow on the table and rested his hand on his cheek while staring at his boyfriend for an answer.
Pansy laughed with her hands on her stomach. But she really was worried about Harry's sudden departure. It wasn't really normal wanting to get away after being 'scratched'. But maybe he wants to make sure he wasn't physically harmed with actual scratches. He could have checked for scratches in front of herself and Draco though. "Well, I'm sorry I scared your precious little Harry away."
John only smirked at them. Then he gestured Jacob to come to him, "Come here, Georgie..."
Pansy ran into the boy's arms and hugged them, glad they're not alone anymore. Blaise looked at Ron then to Neville, then looked down. He's glad they're here but he's feeling a little awkward now.
Harry bit his lip, remembering a memory from not long ago. God, he loved that day. He leaned a little closer to her, whispering into her ear, "I kissed him."
Draco bit his lip, trying to come up with a good enough excuse instead of saying, 'I followed you over here because you're my crush and I also think you should get pants 1 sized bigger because your butt is very distracting'. How he wishes it was that easy to tell someone you like them. "I-, Um... I come out here sometimes to think. I have a lot of thinking places around Hogwarts that nobody really uses and if someone's there I just go to another one of my places." He flushed; he knew he kind of sounded like an idiot when stuttering.
"Mom!"
They definitely heard her; the whole of the town probably did. Joslyn saw that Draco was blushing even redder but then Harry grabbed hold of Draco with the shirt he was wearing and cupped Draco's cheek with the other hand.
"What the bloody hell is everyone-".
He leaned back out when he was out of breath, breathing hard and staring into magnificent emerald green eyes with a visible blush on his neck and face. "I'm.... sorry," he said awkwardly, looking elsewhere but at Potter. He wasn't supposed to kiss Potter, but it was just so tempting... He felt warm hands cupping his cheeks and looked back down at Potter.
"Okay, Harry," Draco said with a blush still lingering on his cheeks, a loving smile, and a heart that's continuously hammering against his chest. He would never calm his racing heart at all, even if it's because of Harry who's making him feel this way.
Harry's blush seems to darken, and he licks around his lips to get the rest of Draco's bodily fluids into his mouth and not on show. He also used the back of his hand in case his tongue wasn't wet enough to lap up the rest.
Harry read what the next instruction was. It's still simple instructions like making the invisibility potion. It will probably get more difficult the more ingredients he adds in "Add two measures of Standard ingredient into the mortar?"
Harry's mouth parts a little and he seems speechless at what Draco said. His Draco. The Draco he's only started being his lover too from five hours ago. And the Slytherin's hand, he doesn't know what's making him blush as it's either Draco's hand or what Draco said. He couldn't tell. He smiles and looks down to the floor. "T-That was sweet of you to say, Draco," he finally manages to say. "Thank you, I guess..." He then bit his lip and looks up into silver eyes which gleam with happiness. He leans forward and gives the Slytherin one more surprised quick kiss, and then he walks towards the door.
Professor McGonagall eventually nodded at her student. "Very well, Miss Brown," she said solemnly and hoped there was another cage in storage somewhere. "You may keep it, but make sure to take proper care of it."
Harry took off his invisibility cloak from behind the statue of the knight, put it in his pocket and walked back into the Grand Hall just like nothing happened. To distract himself from further staring at Draco since he kissed the damn blonde, and trying not to blush anymore, Harry looked over the Gryffindor table at the giant feast that lay on the table. There was Roast Chicken, Roast Turkey, Lasagna, Spaghetti Bolognese, Mashed Potatoes, Potato Salad, Curry, Nasi Goreng, Mi Goreng, and other foods which Harry had never seen in his life.
"I'll tell you after class, Seamus," Dean whispered back to him, smiling slightly at his confused boyfriend. Seems like muggle gardening does pay off after all.
They were finally up in the six years boys' dormitories with excited smiles, and as Draco closed the door behind them, Harry closed the distance between them in a kiss that started off slow and innocent, to a rough kiss with a mixture of tongue and saliva. Draco moaned in Harry's mouth, and while still kissing, they went to the bed. Harry took one second just to crawl up to the pillows of his 4-poster white bed, and Draco just stared down at him while crossing his arms.
Draco looked away from Harry and glared at Pansy. "When I'm done, you're going to be sorry, Ms Parkinson."
He turned on the shower and stood under it. The tap water was magically charmed to turn onto a suitable heating for the person using the shower and it was just right for Harry. He began to break down into tears from what Ron told him, and he began scratching at his arms. Ron was right. He is disgusting. He is a freak who cuts himself. How would Draco continue on with the Malfoy line? Why would Draco not choose to continue the Malfoy generation and chose him instead? It was silly of him to think that he and Draco would work out in the first place.
He let out a rush of air and lifted his head towards Harry. Their noses brushed together for a tiny moment, and then Harry buried his face in Draco's neck, sucking in mouthfuls of taut skin and placing wet kisses against his chin and his ear.
"Sorry," they both said as they let go of each other's hands and took a step back. Secretly, they wanted to be closer to one another again.
"Oh, Hello Ivy," Harry said with an emotionless voice and was trying to sound happy, but the cuts just numbed him of his emotions. He needed to get away and he easily could if he made a run for it and back up into the common room. One thing for sure that he wants to know is how she got here in the first place.
*****
Pansy laughed again and Draco wondered if she had drunk before coming to the park. Knowing his best friend, that's probably what happened.
Hermione nodded. She knew of Harry's sexuality and wanted to help her best friend. She gave him a knowing smile. "We're going to a bar, Harry."
"So, what is this relationship you have with Harry?" Fred asked, intrigued, with raised eyebrows. Could it be true that this blonde Slytherin and Harry really are a thing? "And what was it like dancing with each other at the Yule Ball?"
The boys now faced each other. Harry placed his arms loosely around Draco's neck and Draco's hands slipped their way around Harry's waist. They had their foreheads pressed together and they stared into each other's eyes lovingly. The next flash goes off. Draco kisses Harry on the nose. The next flash of the camera happens.
"Finished!" The girl with long black straight hair, blood tears coming from her eyes with black eye sockets wearing a vintage white dress came out of the funhouse and stood forward out of the crowd, and Harry had to blink a couple of times and remember this was only makeup. Damn though. She looked like Bloody Mary from head to toe.
Draco smiled at this knowledge and returned his head to Harry's shoulder and intertwined their hands together from under the table.
"Mr Potter will be escorted to Gryffindor Tower," McGonagall's expression turned back to her normal stern-looking self as a familiar professor appeared on the other side of the hallway. "While you, Mr Malfoy, will be escorted by Professor Snape to the Slytherin Dungeons."
"Well, we made a truce at the start of the year and I was hoping that I could go and sit with him and Ivy," Harry said and began stabbing his fork in the pancake in front of him on the plate. Every time the fork went through the pancake a 'clink' would be heard as it hits the plate. "I'm calling him Draco because it's his first name, Ron."
Harry was down at the owlery on a Thursday evening, deciding on how to reply to Sirius. He held his quill in his hand, bit his lip, and started writing.
Harry felt someone leaning over him and looked over his shoulder, Snape was looking at his potion. "Your potion is decent, Mr Potter. 1 Point to Gryffindor," the professor said in his cold monotoned voice. Put your potion in a glass vile and the leftover you can try it on yourself." The potions professor than looked at the empty seat beside Potter, studying it. He knew something was up, he then realized Mr Malfoy wasn't in his seat. He sighed and shook his head knowingly, knowing his godson Draco had occupied the seat.
"Umm... I don't know, probably Ireland?" Harry suggested tiredly, wanting to go to sleep so he doesn't wake up feeling even more depressed. But nothing has been helping his sleeping situation and lately, he just doesn't seem to care anymore.
"Ah, that makes sense," Fred said distractedly as he stared at the empty spot next to the blonde Slytherin wizard. Was someone supposed to be there? He blinked and looked back at the girl named Ivy. "I'm Fred and this is my twin, George." He and his twin held their hands out to her for a handshake.
Draco rolled his eyes, yet again wondering why he's friends with this witch. "Tell me again why I'm even friends with you again?"
Draco found Harry walking alone to class and decided to catch up to him. It didn't take long as Harry was walking so slow. As soon as he was side by side with Harry, he intertwined their hands together. He watched as Harry looked up at him, those dull, dreary eyes staring back at him. He smiled down at Harry even though he was frowning from the inside. When he saw Harry give him a small smile which he didn't know was fake or not his smile grew so he kissed his cheek. No cute tinge of red on Harry's cheeks that he'd normally see.
"Sorry, Ted," said Harry as he hugged his godson back. "I have to get home to make dinner, unless Hermione's already cooked it which I hope she didn't." He didn't realize he was going off topic. "It's my turn to cook." He placed Teddy back down on the floor and gave his whitish blonde hair, which then changed to a blue colour, a gentle ruffle. "I'll come back in two days' time."
"Sneezewort is a species of herbaceous perennial flowering plant in the genus 'Achillea'," said Hermione and lowered her hand with a smile. "Its origin is in Europe and North America. These plants are most effective in the inflaming of the brain and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness. The leaves can be uses for insect repellant. It is used as an ingredient in the making of various potions, such as the Befuddlement Draught and the Strong Invigoration Draught."
Even if the store creeped him out, he had a look around and ignored the store owner who was looking at him curiously. He knew not to touch anything just in case there was some curse upon the object and he didn’t want the store owner to think he was stealing.
"Oh," said Draco, taking a step back and he looked over to where Pansy and Ivy was. They all were sitting down, even Pansy was. He gets why the chairs are doing this now but why aren't they messing with Pansy? He looks back at the table Harry's sitting at and at the Bulgarian. "But my date, who's my friend, she's already seated at a table with all my other friends. The chairs aren't messing with her."
Hermione suddenly blushed as she hid her face in back her book, but the blush seemed to run further up her face so Harry could see. "Oh, she's great," she said with a shy smile.
Harry pointed his wand at Draco's robe as he had a spell in his mind, and he thought of the Gryffindor colours. "Colovaria!" He said and watched in amusement as Draco's Slytherin robe turned into a Gryffindor robe, just without the Gryffindor crest.
Harry, of course, would love a hug from Draco. He simply nodded and slowly wrapped his arms around Draco. Draco chuckled and hugged Harry back, rubbing soothing circles on his back. "Now, I believe that Lunch is nearly over. Is your shoulder still hurting? Do you still want to fly this evening?"
"You're incredible, Harry!" says Draco when staring at all the trap doors around him that he missed when he first came in the funhouse with Pansy and Blaise. He turned to Harry and began kissed him all of his face and hands. Harry began laughing at Draco's little loving gestures and he pulled him closer for a side hug.
He's been cutting himself for a while now. Almost five months. He deserved every cut he slashed into his skin. It all numbed him from the pain he was feeling on the inside. He really liked the numb feeling too. It was like a break from reality, a break from the pain.
Their eyes met as Draco lowered himself onto Harry, and they both exhaled heavily at the same time. Draco felt the precise moment that the swell of Harry's head pushed past his tight opening and rubbed firmly against his insides. His eyes fluttered closed and a tiny whimper escaped from his mouth. Placing his palms flat against Harry's chest, Draco worked himself up and down, settling a little lower each time until he had taken over half of Harry inside him. Draco realised he'd had his eyes closed for quite a while, screwed up in concentration as he chewed his bottom lip almost raw. He willed himself to relax, drawing in deep, quivering breaths as he finally opened his eyes and looked down at Harry.
Harry turned his head around to look at Draco and just noticed how close he was. He too could feel this kind of electric feeling as the Slytherin's arms were wrapped around his torso. He had to admit, Draco does have pretty silver eyes. Almost the colour of the Unicorn blood... He didn't know why he thought that about Draco's eyes. Guys couldn't like guys, right? He shook that thought out of his head and looked down at the broken lantern.
Draco smirked and turned to look at an annoyed-looking Pansy. "You lost, remember?" Pansy rolled her eyes and gave Draco 5 galleons. "Thank you to the both of you."
"Understood."
Draco sighed, a frown coming on his face. He honestly didn't mean any of it. It's just so his father doesn't suspect anything if Crabbe and Goyle were to say anything to their own fathers. "Look, I'm sorry!" he said regretfully and scrubbed a hand over his face. "Remember when I said I still had to insult you, so people don't suspect anything?"
"I think so," said Harry while panting a little.
The boy looked at Harry with uncertainty yet again but gives him his name. "Michael," he says. He doesn't even bother introducing his friends as he could tell the Gryffindor didn't care about anything but getting these gifts to Draco Malfoy. "Let's go." He whispers the password and as the entrance appears, he walks in with the Gryffindor walking behind him. They didn't even get to the middle of the common room when they heard a soft "Harry?"
Mrs Weasley caught her son's rude gesture and placed both hands on her hips. "Ronald Billius Weasley! Don't give me an attitude."
Harry crossed his arms over his chest, a little unimpressed at Draco far hating on Ron's family when they have done absolutely nothing. "Why do you hate the Weasleys so much?" he asked in a soft voice. "I mean, I know they are apparently 'Blood Traitors', whatever that means to you but seriously. Why?"
"Fine," Draco snarled out of annoyance at having to talk about the Weasel. It's like hearing an annoying buzz from a bee or a fly that hangs around your ear. "I fought with him because he treated you like rubbish-"
There was just something about Draco that Harry felt he was able to have a conversation to him about anything. He didn't know if he could talk about his depression and the abuse, he gets from the Dursleys. It was just so overwhelming but the Slytherin wizard gave him some kind of ...vibe...
"More like whitish blonde," Harry corrected him smugly. He hasn't seen Malfoy since last year after graduating from Hogwarts. He remembered Malfoy's trial and pleading him not guilty, which he was. The Slytherin never did anything quite... bad. He understands Malfoy would have gone through a lot when having a nose-less man and a giant snake living in your house. It gave him the shivers wondering how Malfoy put up with all that.
"Oh," Harry said and looked down at his meal sadly. "I- um... Well, let's just say the Dursleys feed me whatever my cousin doesn't eat. Which is not a lot, usually vegetables." He feels like he has told someone this before. Has he? He doesn't remember but continued on. "And yes, you can help me eat the rest of my food."
"Merlin's Beard!" Draco looked at the shining gold numbers that floated out from Harry's wand in shock. "Five minutes to go until class!" He quickly hurried over to the Oak door, ready to exit and go to class. He just wished he had classes with Harry. "We better hurry..."
Draco smirked and said as he headed towards the bathroom, "Damn, I also looking forward to a goodnight kiss." He gave a wink and turned around. Harry blushed at the thought of giving Draco akiss goodnight and summoned a few books over to him with an "Accio!"just as Draco closed the door to the bathroom. Harry looked at the titles of the books, seeing as they're quite old by the cover and noticed that most of these were about boring stuff like the planets in the stars and what they apparently mean, about the spirits of the forest such as Wendigo's, Dogmen, tree spirits et cetera.
"I've missed you too, Hermione," Ron said while not knowing what else to say so he awkwardly patted her on the back. He's still not used to girl hugs except with his mom and Ginny which are rare occurrences.
"Apparently not," Draco said with a satisfied smile. He's just never thought of showing anyone this place at all. "My mother told me about this place, she's been in this very room before. She's never told father about this place though, it's a Black family secret. She found this place with her sister Andromeda in her fifth year. They never told my Aunt Bellatrix, I guess they knew how cunning and evil she was or something."
Harry smiled up at him, knowing his expression was stupidly besotted. At that moment, he didn't care how much it revealed. He wanted it revealed. "You didn't," he told him softly. "I'm fine. Better than that, actually."
"Good luck, Dray," Pansy says, smiling with her teeth.
Another damn hallway, but thankfully without mirrors. It was a dark hallway, the only lights were on the floors in shapes of vampire bats, cemetery crosses, and creepy smiles. After that hallway came another one, but lighter with white and black lines forming a spiral.
He scratched and scratched at his arm, wanting to feel pain but as he looked at his forearm, he noticed the cuts he had made days ago appeared on his arm like he had just made them. It was the spell that he used to fade them from sight. So, he scratched and scratched until the scabs tore off and he began bleeding.
"No, you idiot!" Dudley scowled at him, not interested in what his cousin has to say or do. He just wants to go back to his video game with his mates. It's all he wants right now.
"Not going to invite me in?" Ivy asked with a small smile. Another part of being a vampire is being invited into places by a witch, wizard, or muggle. It's also how bloodshed happens if someone invites the wrong vampire into their house or their friends' place.
