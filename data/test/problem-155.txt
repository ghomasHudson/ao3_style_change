“Come here,” Harry murmurs, pressing their chests together, allowing himself a single shiver at the feel of Draco’s scars against his skin. He kisses him, taking his time, waiting for Draco to open up willingly, to accept what’s being offered and when he does, Harry smiles into the kiss, and folds him into his arms.
Ripples of soft, teasing magic drip from his fingers all over Draco’s cock with every other stroke as Harry sucks bruises into the soft flesh on the side of his neck and drags his teeth all over that sweet, milky skin. It doesn’t take long until Draco’s coming all over his fist with a muffled curse, his whole body sagging against Harry’s, and Harry holds him through it, muttering how amazing he feels.
Harry is, truly, for reasons he struggles to file and divide in his head. “That my colleagues torture people in custody?” he finally asks. “Can you blame me?” He gets up to sort out the opened jars and bottles of potions and puts them away. With a wave of his hand, two mugs fly out of the cupboard as Harry walks over to the kettle and puts it on.
Harry had no intention to pursue anything serious with McLaggen from the very start, maybe apart from a quick fuck and a mutual understanding to never contact each other again. Then, Harry had realised McLaggen’s clandestine hookups were less honest than he would’ve liked and while Harry navigated life knowing this was usually as good as it got for him, Draco deserved better. He didn’t know if
, there would only be one spot. For Harry and no-one else. Feeling his stomach sink in momentary panic, Harry immediately asked if he could have more than one. The well-trained, apologetic smile he was treated with was answer enough, even without the legal drivel that came pouring out of the man’s mouth. He stammered on about
“Well, in short, my theory is that after dealing with all that happened when we were teenagers—and with the aftermath, both mental and situational—we finally get to live out our youth, so to speak,” Hermione says. “We get together to drink, we act silly, and make stupid jokes because we… finally have the time to do so.”
“Robards,” Kingsley says over the scattered papers and pictures, “gather as many men as you can, we need a team on this. Briefing after lunch, we need to start checking those tips as soon as possible.”
Harry’s voice catches in his throat. “Find something you’re good at, not for. You’re not a— a tool, Draco, you have free will. And as much as I hate to admit it to your face, you’re smart. You’ll figure it out,” says Harry, carefully not thinking about using Malfoy’s first name.
Harry gets up first, laughing as he leaves Draco hot and bothered in bed, puts his underwear on and goes to the kitchen to make breakfast. When Draco finally joins him, he’s only wearing a pair of designer black boxers that hug his arse so nicely, Harry almost burns himself with a hot pan.
“Ginny,” Harry says, his voice muffled by the force of Luna’s hug. She then walks over to the second armchair and sits down with a serene smile.
Draco is sitting in the revolving chair opposite Harry’s desk in his tiny vice-Head Auror office. He’s currently banging his fist on his sternum, choking on a biscuit he helped himself to right after he entered, not bothering to hide his unbelievable sweet tooth in front of Harry. Harry hesitates whether he should pour Draco a glass of water or watch the wanker choke to death, as right before this little incident, Draco almost tripped over backwards in the chair laughing after hearing about Harry’s disaster of a blind date.
. It’s how the world works, Potter, it’s how people think, and those who can control what the public thinks, have the power.”
With his ridiculously perfect body, and stupid gorgeous eyes, and tacky pickup lines, Potter is such an utter himbo Draco can’t objectively take it, but that’s never been an issue since Potter is usually more than eager to be the one
“I’ve seen better,” Draco says, his voice dropping just a perfect amount—still perfectly reasonable but low enough for the man to read into it... if he wanted.
that had once held the Sacred Twenty-Eight together, flowing crimson and ancient in their very veins, has now turned gold and heavy, resting deep underground protected by the goblins whose greed and loyalty to the coin matched their own. Watching Dumbledore’s fall, witnessing their Dark Master die at the hands of a teenage boy, seeing their brethren fall from grace and rot on an island in the middle of nowhere has taught them one thing: blood, once spilt, dries and turns into dust. Bloodlines wither, people disappear and are forever forgotten, but gold… Gold is timeless.
“I knew it,” Harry growls, finally letting his anger bloom, spreading like hot, black smoke over his chest. “You don’t give a fuck about your wife, about—”
“I’m— Ah, I’m going to let you… freak out in peace. Don’t mind me—” His voice is so hoarse Harry exhales softly, afraid he might have gone overboard, but Draco doesn’t seem to mind. Still, Harry stops him, pulling him back by the wrist.
He cups Draco’s face in his hand and the Glamour spell radiates off his palm like a breath, following Harry’s intent to hide, to protect—he watches, a little hypnotised, as Draco’s face morphs ever so subtly. His hair turns a darker, warmer blond, his features soften and his eyes turn a pale blue. His skin has lost its moonlight paleness in favour of a light tan and Harry already misses Draco’s usual, pointy self.
He finally got up as he heard Draco clamour in the kitchen and turn the telly on—they could use a little break, maybe after he would convince Draco to do it in the shower. His clothes were lying on the floor where Draco had discarded them earlier and Harry shrugged back into his white t-shirt and a pair of faded blue jeans.
As soon as Harry’s mouth is on his, all worry evaporates from Draco’s thoughts, leaving space for what’s important—Harry. He focuses on the soft, warm press of lips and the faintest hint of tongue, and the way Harry
They don’t stumble to the bedroom like they ought to, to check all the boxes under their very own clichée scenario—Harry Apparates them directly onto his bed and Vanishes their clothes with a wave of his hand. There’s no ceiling mirror this time, but all Harry needs to see is Draco’s face anyway; his body, his muscles contracting as he fucks into Harry with abandon, looking him in the eyes and whispering how much he missed him. Harry gets to have him, to kiss him all over once again. After nearly half an hour, when Harry has Draco howling in pleasure, covered in their mingled sweat, precome, and saliva, he only pulls his tongue out of Draco’s arse to tell him how fucking amazing he tastes.
Harry wakes up naked, enveloped in the delicious warmth of another body wrapped around his. The morning sunlight is just barely peeking into the bedroom through the closed curtains, casting the space in a dreamlike golden glow. Next to him, Draco is still asleep with his arms wrapped around Harry’s waist, his mop of white-gold hair spilling across Harry's chest.
someone touch you, or even love you, with the use of magic, it won’t carry the same feeling. Spells have counterspells, potions wear off, and memories cannot be ripped from the… tapestry of time or whatever you want to call it.”
Malfoy barks out an arrogant laugh. “Finally, a competent Auror!” he says, smirk still plastered to his face. “Ten years have passed and you’re still as sharp as the
As soon as he hears his friend’s voice, Harry knows something bad has happened. The conversation is brief and Ron is in full Auror mode, clearly not in the mood for a chat, but also somewhat apprehensive and Harry has to coax the news out of him.
“Get this: they found an illegal stash of Felix itself. It’s like the potion practically laughed in their faces.”
The faint rumble of chair-wheels on the floor cuts through the silence and in the next second, there’s a firm, warm hand on his shoulder and Harry’s surrounded with the smell of citrus with a spicy note he’s never been able to name. “Hey. No.”
.” He rolls his eyes. “Salazar, when Granger’s right, she’s right, those power dynamics are properly messed up.”
If someone took a closer look at his face, they would perhaps pause, their gaze lingering on his sharp, statuesque features, not quite able to name the unsettling familiarity they evoked. If some of the younger men and women looked up from their piles of paperwork, perhaps they would even know the man’s name, as soon as they registered the pale blond of his hair and the pointy jut of his cheekbones.
With that one drop, Harry’s whole world came crashing down. Like a house of cards left in an empty room, collapsed by a light breeze that came in through a cracked window. Almost like the butterfly effect, only there was no butterfly—just a furious tornado of fire and brimstone destroying everything it touched and two terrified men, helpless against fate falling down on their heads. Harry put his hands on Draco’s cheeks, looking at the love of his life for maybe the last time and white-hot, burning torment tore through his chest as he kissed Draco’s forehead.
Their lips finally touch and it’s everything Harry had imagined, and somehow more, and better, and it’s completely, absolutely breathtaking. He can feel every inch of Draco’s mouth, soft and pliant under his own, and Harry briefly thinks that
hair looks acceptable and leave soon if he wants to make it on time for his impromptu date with Neville’s mysterious coworker.
He makes a mental list of all the women and men he could ask. It’s not an impressive list. It’s more of a note.
“No, but she was,” Draco says simply. “After… the War and everything, I—” He takes a breath. “I wasn’t going to let anyone threaten me. Not for something that’s not evil.”
“What about you, Harry?” Dean asks, flashing him an impish smile. “When you do it with blokes, that is.”
Harry ignores him, feeling his fury bubbling on a low simmer, deep in his gut, filling his lungs with black smoke, and sending little hot pulses of magic down his arms. “Kitchen,” he barks, not looking back, Draco’s footsteps the only indicator he’s following. He pulls out his phone, types a quick text to Ron that he won’t be able to make it today, and throws the phone onto the table with a loud clatter.
In a split second, Harry decides to engage him instead of changing the topic. Whatever’s about to happen, the buildup has gone far enough and if facing the music means resolving whatever’s been going on between them, Harry is ready for the grand denouement. He crosses his arms and stares Draco down. “You think this is a game,” he says.
It hits him how different this is, being with a man. With girls, it was all soft curves and delicate touches, everything felt flowy and smooth, delicate. It’s different with Draco. He’s toned and slender, just as strong as Harry, and there’s an urgent force to his touches, to the way Draco devours his mouth and shamelessly ruts against him. It’s strangely metaphorical, that even in the throes of passion, frotting on the couch with their tongues down each other’s throats, Harry and Draco add a dash of their mutual push-and-pull that only makes things all the more exciting. Harry’s breath speeds up at the scratch of stubble against his neck, at the hard planes of muscle and sharp juts of bone under his palms. It had never occurred to Harry that he might like it a little rough but he feels Draco’s solid, bulky weight on top of him, feels a hand gripping him by the hair and finds that he
There’s a blurry silhouette behind the frosted glass door to his office and as soon as Harry hears the knob turn without a knock, he knows the only person it could be is Claire, his assistant. Normally, Harry would address the issue that when one wishes to enter the DMLE vice-head’s office, one would be wise to knock first. It works most of the time, but not all the people he knows are familiar with the basic rules of etiquette.
Draco’s eyes widen as he looks behind Harry, craning his neck. It doesn’t take him long to add two and two and his face breaks into a shit-eating grin. “I did not,” he says slowly, biting his lip as he surveys the patrons. “But perhaps Lady Fortune has smiled upon us.”
. The part that drove Harry to pull him out of Fiendfyre, to stand up for him before the whole Wizengamot ten years ago, and to have this disconcerting conversation on a roof of a Muggle motel in the middle of the night.
The use of his first name draws Draco’s attention and he turns to look at Harry. “He’s the one who bound me,” he snarls and with one, well-aimed kick sends Dmitri to his knees. “And now, the spell will finally be undone, won’t it, Mityushka? He hates when I call him Mityushka,” he adds with a dark chuckle.
at his sleeve. “He just seemed… shady about it. I’m sure there’s something he’s not telling us,” he sighs.
“O-kay?” The man is still staring and Harry’s glad they’re not in a Muggle bank where the clerks have those big, red buttons under their desks. “Well if you need anything—”
. Harry’s given up on trying to understand why—Draco announced he would not be roaming about looking like a house-elf and that was the end of it.
The true secret, the one thing only Harry (and a lovely artist all the way in Spain) knows about, is his tattoos. He adjusts himself on the sofa, feeling the softest hum of magic along his core—the Concealing Charms he’s been wearing for the last few months feel more like a safety blanket than like a burden. At first, he needed a bit more focus to keep them up all day but it’s second nature now and Harry is glad to take advantage of his allegedly exceptional magical prowess.
Harry hoisted him up to have those lips closer to his own. He kissed him, slow and deep, humming in contentment as he tasted their mingled essence on Draco’s tongue. “I could stare all day,” he said, earning himself a shy smile and another soft kiss on the tip of his nose. “God, you smell amazing,” he groaned, burying his nose behind Draco’s ear.
“We both know memories can be tampered with, Potter. And!” He raises a hand as soon as Harry’s mouth opens. “Ah, ah, don’t even start on Veritaserum, I’ve only just admitted to myself that you do possess some semblance of intelligence, after all.”
Draco is standing at the bottom of the little stairs leading to his door, wearing an expensive-looking, black wool coat, and a pair of sleek, black leather gloves. The falling snowflakes are already forming a soft halo over his wavy fringe. His mouth falls open in a quiet exhale when he sees Harry—who’s in a pair of soft grey joggers, wearing a t-shirt, incidentally one that Draco himself had slept in—and staring at Draco in complete and utter shock.
,” he says, pulling out the revolver, making Harry’s every muscle tense into alert, “is a classic Smith & Wesson .44 revolver.” Harry watches, stunned into silence, as Malfoy expertly empties the cylinder, one bullet after another neatly falling into his cupped hand. “Six and a half inches, and I’m sure there’s a penis joke here somewhere.”
“Just for the record, fifteen-year-old me would have wanked himself raw at his Auror-interrogation fantasy coming true,” Malfoy chuckles, clearly unable to stop talking. Perhaps it’s nerves, an instinct to put on a brave face when he’s trapped beyond help—there’s a familiar undertone to his voice, as subtle as a whisper, one Harry had once heard laced into the words that haunted his dreams at one point in the past:
Harry comes closer, panting heavily, grabs Draco by his jacket, and slams him so hard against the wall, a vase on the nearest shelf rattles ominously. He brings their faces closer, watching Draco’s eyes darken as he swipes the remnants of the blood with his thumb, pressing a tiny healing spell to the spot; he can hear Draco’s soft intake of breath as he feels Harry’s now-familiar magic swipe over his skin, and Harry can’t stop himself from brushing that lower lip with his thumb.
That’s what the Death Eaters who escaped Azkaban did. They were the ones who lurked in the shadows, whispered orders, recruited fresh meat. The strategists, the planners, the ones who’d much rather dirty their hands with secrets and politics than blood and grime. Voldemort needed them for the power and influence over the uncertain ones, a tool to tip the scales with those too afraid, too undecided, but also with blood too pure and precious to be wastefully spilt.
“It would feel correct, wouldn’t it?” Harry sighed. “But no,” he pressed a kiss to Draco’s pectoral. “Got better things to get addicted to.” It made Draco’s heart leap.
They slowly break apart but stay close enough so Harry can steal one, two, three more soft, featherlight kisses and Draco seems to melt in his hands as Harry feels his pulse hammer against his fingertips, under the soft skin of Draco’s neck. He’s holding on to Harry for dear life, clutching his wrists to try and hide the tremble in his hands as he breathes against Harry’s lips. He smells like chocolate, warm and velvety.
“Fucking hell,” Ron says, shaking his head. “I almost never text, hate those tiny buttons, I’m used to the Floo.”
Teddy moans as Harry’s slicked finger bottoms out inside him and Draco can feel his hips shaking. From a mix of exertion and that impossible, spectacular tightness, the slick heat completely enveloping him, forcing him to gasp for air.
“So how did you find out about the… ” Ron trails off, letting out a puff of air. “You know. The beating?”
Draco sniffs, perfectly aware of the irony yet always unwilling to acknowledge it, no matter how much against the wall he finds himself.
After a few more minutes of frantically going through every possible scenario, including the one where Archie leaves him for a younger Auror (
Draco lets out a breathless laugh and kisses him once, a chaste smack of lips which Harry leans into on instinct.
“Draco, Draco, fuck, I can’t—” He chokes out, struggling to breathe or think, feeling his bollocks tighten and knowing he’s not going to last. “I’m going to—ah, ah, ah,
Careful not to touch or even acknowledge Malfoy’s Sectumsempra scars, Harry checks again to see if all the superficial damage is fixed; then he checks if there’s any internal trauma and patches it up to the best of his abilities. He casts two diagnostic spells he knows might help and Malfoy must know them, eyes lighting up in recognition. Malfoy tenses a little as the magic takes effect with a soft but noticeable chime of the spells in the deadly-silent room; the charms point Harry to two fractured ribs and a small internal haemorrhage that should heal nicely on its own with a dose of a Blood-Replenisher to stimulate the healing.
The girl grimaces. “He doesn’t sound evil.” This time, Harry actually snorts, earning himself a puzzled look from a middle-aged woman standing next to him.
Harry looks around for his wand, realising he must have left it in the bathroom, and keeps his hand up just in case. One more glass meets the same fate, then a vase nearly flies out the window, and Harry can only helplessly watch and mitigate the damage. Finally, Draco deflates, pacing around the room with his face in his hands, letting out long, heaving breaths. He props himself up on the table and only when he grabs the edge to flip it does Harry step in.
? A strange question to ask Harry, after he’s been on the run with Draco for the past eight weeks, a mission Robards oversaw himself.
“Can we order already?” Ron whines, leaning his head against the booth with a pained sigh, like a martyr starving for a greater cause. He casts a sorrowful look at a passing waitress carrying a tray of appetisers.
The talk they had was decidedly less scary than Harry had anticipated—he felt silly, and maybe a bit childish—after all, Ginny was his friend and in all his panic Harry had forgotten that his avoidance had hurt her, too. All the complicated feelings finally burst free, all the things Harry tried to put into words were suddenly out in the open and he couldn’t help but marvel at the lightness of his chest when all was said and done. Ginny admitted she wasn’t sure they should continue pursuing romance together, explained she had some time to think and think she did, finally free from the fear of impending danger that accompanied all of them during the War. It was funny how the oldest excuse in the book turned out to be a half-truth when Ginny dropped the bomb:
“Malfoy,” Harry says, standing up, feeling his muscles pulse furiously around his wound; he’s dizzy with adrenaline and there’s blood in his peripheral vision. “Draco. Don’t kill him.”
Draco watches him, eyes travelling across Harry’s face, careful and delicate, almost scared, like he’s expecting Harry to disappear. “I— “
“Are you sure?” Harry asks, ironically, as he’s not sure of anything they’re doing anymore, or whatever they’ll do next. All that drives him is the overwhelming need to make it better, to keep Draco right there under him, around him, safe, and unafraid.
Draco regards him curiously. “You’re always so... in control. You give orders, you can assess the situation without a hitch and yet…”
It’s not like Harry didn’t know they were there—he was the one who cast the spell. He’s the one responsible for Draco walking around with a constant reminder they once tried to kill each other. Something tightens in Harry’s throat when he thinks how far they’ve come, how different things would have been if they were friends from the start, if they both weren’t so fucking stubborn. He stares, transfixed, at the thin, pink lines slashing across Draco’s chest with his mouth agape and before he can say anything, Draco moves his hand to lift his chin.
Draco’s head whips up and he frowns at him, instantly knowing something’s wrong. “You missed me, which is worrisome for crime-fighting reasons, but ultimately fortunate for my beautiful face,” he tries, keeping his tone light but there’s still a lingering note of concern at Harry’s sudden remorse.
Harry wants to laugh because he’s nearly losing the feeling in his legs as Draco’s palms over his skin, going lower and lower. His nerves are string-taut as he holds his breath, not really sure what to expect or what the etiquette is here but all that goes very foggy very fast, when Draco lightly bites and kisses his arse cheek. Harry gasps, arching his back and hiding his face in the pillow—his thighs open on instinct and he feels a little bashful, to be already begging for it so openly, but hears Draco groan behind him and brush the insides of his thighs with delicate fingertips. When Draco sucks a wet kiss to the sensitive skin, Harry whimpers, digging his fingers into the sheets. His toes curl in pleasure and then, he feels Draco’s lips going higher, just a little higher with every melting kiss.
all over the place. Even his bloody nails are subtly manicured and Harry rolls his eyes at all the assumptions the receptionist must be making. Whereas not well-versed in all things Muggle, Malfoy immediately catches
“Hey,” Harry said and took a step closer. “It’s all right. What’s going on?” He was using all the self-restraint he possessed not to do something reckless, like come closer, or touch Draco’s back. Or kiss him.
“Move,” Harry says, guiding him to the door by the cuffs. Outside, two young Aurors whose names Harry doesn’t remember are already waiting. They resemble Crabbe and Goyle back in their school days, from the bulky frames down to their thuggish expressions and beady eyes that would sooner fit in a gloomy back alley than in any kind of law enforcement. It’s all about balance, Harry muses.
Harry paces outside of the quaint little café Luna excitedly sent him directions to, feeling like a madman. He wracks his brain for the reason he agreed to a bloody blind date in the first place. The only information he has is that the man’s name is Archibald (peculiar, but he’s seen worse), and that he’ll be waiting inside. Was Harry that drunk? Did they drug him? Imperius him? That would make him a poor Auror, wouldn’t it? And who would want to date a bad Auror, it’s unsafe and, frankly, a bit embarrassing. As if going on a blind date with Harry Potter in a Glamour wasn’t bad enough. He catches the cafe’s interior in the corner of his eye and sees a flash of a white tablecloth. Is he underdressed? Sure, it’s three in the afternoon and it’s definitely not a fancy place, but still. He wishes he had asked Draco before going. Draco would definitely know. He would also give him that fond, exasperated smile and tell him to
Draco reaches between them to touch Harry’s cock but Harry quickly grabs his hands and puts them back where they were. “Like this,” he breathes, “Just your cock, harder, ah,
Ginny grabs her girlfriend’s hand and kisses her knuckles, shooting Harry a hard look. It makes him feel a little guilty—raising one’s voice at Luna is something no-one feels good about. In all honesty, she could probably saunter into Gringott’s and ask nicely to be given all the gold, and the Goblins would help her load it onto a cart.
The shower is cramped and its water pressure leaves something to be desired but Harry nearly moans when the first scalding-hot rivulets drip down his back. It’s getting late and only now Harry fully realises it’s still the same day—just hours ago, he was interrogating Malfoy at the Ministry. Just hours ago, he was having lunch with Ron, chatting and having coffee. And then, inexplicably, Harry found himself extracting a possible high-profile witness who just happened to be his old school rival, arch-nemesis, and a general pain in the arse.
Asleep next to him, Draco is a pale wonder, tucked between the sheets like liquid moonlight. Usually, there’s a little crease between his eyebrows, tense and vigilant, granting him a cool air of indifference, but it’s gone now; he breathes softly, and every fall of his chest seems to tug at Harry’s heart that beats inside his ribcage like a bird seeking escape. Unable to stop himself, Harry buries his nose in the platinum locks, inhaling the scent he didn’t understand before, baffled at how someone so sharp can smell like the softest whisper of home. It’s easy to brush it all off, to mindlessly bury himself in Draco’s smell and body, but there’s a part of Harry that’s terrified of the slowly advancing realisation that this milky-almond sweetness makes more and more sense as they let each other closer and closer.
“You remembered,” Draco whispers against his mouth, not giving Harry any time to respond, diving back in and coaxing a moan out of him. He hoists Harry up onto the counter to bring them closer together and Harry groans as he wraps his legs around him. “Of course, I remembered,” he breathes, baring his neck for Draco to mark.
Harry laughed, sudden and private and the sound shook them off that fucking theoretical plane down into this strange, dim bathroom where Draco was looking into Harry’s eyes, seeing him for what he was without the ifs and woulds. He slid Sirius’ heavy jacket off Harry’s shoulders and Harry caught it at the last second, then reached into one of the inner pockets.
His phone chimes just when they’re leaving the room, after Harry’s Glamoured himself, too, and he finds a text from Ron:
As soon he tunes into the spell, his knees buckle under him and Harry’s assaulted with a ragged, breathy sound. He stands there, paralysed, with his forehead against the cool wall, feeling his arousal mount as he listens to Draco, just a few feet away, letting out a low moan. And then, Harry is ruined.
The next hotel on the road should be their last if everything goes according to plan; it’s situated in a reasonably-sized town in the south, suspiciously crowded for this time of year. They manage to book the last room and Draco’s brows ride up in amusement as they hear the young man behind the front desk shyly utter the words ‘honeymoon suite’.
Draco looks like he’s really deliberating whether to say it or not. “True love… is like a fart. If you force it, it’ll be shite.”
“I want you, Draco,” Harry murmurs and god, does he want Draco. He wants him in all the ways Draco will allow, he wants him so much he’s throbbing with it and he kisses Draco again, and again, just because he can, because he tastes like sex incarnate and Harry’s
Draco has to physically tear himself away from Harry, gasping for air. “I’m possessive,” he breathes, looking at him, completely wrecked. “Sometimes arrogant. I will make you go to the opera with me, I hate that show you watch, the one about cars, I’m bossy, I leave my stuff everywhere, I want to hold hands, I want a dog, I want to kiss you
“You Aurors really think your cunning is superior to everyone else’s,” Malfoy drawls, his upper lip stretching into a sneer, and Harry wonders whether he’s not the only one whose old habits die hard. “While you’re as insidious as dog shite in the middle of a pavement.” He waves a nonchalant hand in the general direction of the discreetly Glamoured one-way mirror behind Harry’s back. “Will you do the honours or shall I?”
“I take it you enjoyed it,” Harry murmurs, hands already cupping Draco’s arse, leaning up for another kiss.
use a cup of tea but then again, I wouldn’t even drink the water here,” he says with a grimace. In the next second, Harry almost jumps as Malfoy produces a wand, seemingly out of nowhere. In a blink of an eye, it’s just
They kiss, again, and again, and Harry wonders what has got into Draco, already feeling his own arousal take the reins. Draco’s on top of him, his moonlight fringe grazing Harry’s forehead and he’s looking at Harry like he’s the only person in the world, with surprised wonder in the slight shiver of his hand as he slides a thumb over his lower lip.
All blood left Draco’s face. A wave of crippling, overwhelming panic hit Harry with such a force, he thought he would throw up. Unable to make his stomach stop from jumping, Harry put his hand over Draco’s and stared at the screen, feeling the acrid taste of bile in his throat.
“Well. We were researching it for some case from the Unspeakables,” Draco starts, and then pauses. “I want to tell you more but apparently their weird non-disclosure agreements still work.” He shrugs and continues. “Anway, we were taken off the project when some of the... idiotic, overzealous, overambitious,
They lie like that for a few minutes, completely spent and breathing heavily, and Harry groans as Draco’s cock slips out of him. He has never felt so sated, so completely wrung out in the best possible way, and his heart has never leapt quite so much in his life.
The next day, Harry wanders the hotel, and after asking around at the reception he learns why so many people from neighbouring towns can be seen on every corner and all around the small lobby. He can’t wipe the stupid smile off his face as he takes the stairs back to their room, an idea already forming in his head.
“Bloody hell,” Harry mutters, already expecting trouble, judging from Draco’s loose, flirtatious stance. “What’s a gay bar doing in the middle of nowhere anyway?”
“Um, yes. Thank you, Claire,” Harry says, feeling his flush spread to his neck as she casts him one last judgemental look and promptly leaves the office shaking her head, hopefully more at the world in general than at Harry personally.
Draco looks away, adjusting Harry’s arm so it’s laid flat on the mattress. “I need to pour it all over the wound.”
There are two main outcomes Draco anticipates in the nearest future. He could break it off with Potter and live out the rest of his days knowing exactly what sound Potter makes when he’s about to come, and replay it in his head until he gets admitted to St. Mungo’s. The other outcome, just as plausible and even more terrifying, is that Draco will fall in love with Potter, like an absolute, complete fool and, subsequently, get his heart broken, quit his job, leave the country and live his days out as a recluse somewhere no-one will look for him, like the Arctic (Potter’s orgasm noises as the soundtrack included).
Draco made a disgusted sound and Harry laughed for real this time. “Alas, we could only put in so many antiques without an Extension Charm on the coffin, though I’m sure he’ll haunt me for that musket at some point in the future.”
The words tug at the edges of Harry’s awareness as he contemplates all the things he’s learned about Malfoy in just one day, thinking of how much he’s not telling, what things bubble underneath his flashy exterior. Transported over ten years back, Harry again finds himself wondering what Draco Malfoy might be up to this time.
As Draco’s leaning forward, the man pushes back and rubs against him, making Draco hiss. And then, he’s spun around, pressed against the workbench,
The only thing Harry can bring himself to do when he reads Neville’s owl is to gently lay his forehead on his desk and groan for a good eight seconds.
The door opens an inch and a cloud of purple smoke seeps out through the crack in a flurry of glittering swirls that slowly curl down, spilling over the floor like a nebulous magical carpet. Through the thin fog, Harry can make out a sweaty brow and a brown eye glancing at him with suspicion until it lightens up with recognition. The door opens wide and Harry steps through the smoke curtain accompanied by the intern’s excited babble.
“I’m sorry. I... I truly am,” Draco says as he finally turns to face Harry, mirroring his position. “It was… hard. Watching you, and being so close to you and I thought, how far does it have to go— how far can I stretch this fantasy until it all shatters— It was unfair, Harry, to both of us, I thought I could keep it in check, shut out that part of me, and just be your friend, and—” he lets out a sharp exhale, gazing at Harry and his eyes are almost pleading.
“Daniel, I think?” Harry pulls the business card out of his pocket. “Yeah, Daniel Mallow,” he reads.
She told him that deep inside, she had known all along she was interested in dating women but once she had a little time to herself, she had come to terms with the fact that she was
Harry clenches around him, once, twice, and then, he’s coming all over their stomachs, completely untouched, his red, wet cock spurting white across Draco’s pristine shirt. It only takes three more pushes and Draco follows, pressing Harry down as he comes inside him.
Draco frowns, casting a quick look at the kid. He’s looking straight ahead with a confused expression when he finally speaks. “Are you talking to me, child?”
The office feels too hot and Harry loosens the collar of his uniform. “Well, I could have just sicced Claire on him,” he says, letting out a small laugh.
The second candidate, Harry refuses to talk about or even remember—to this day, he prays to never pass the man in the streets. Suffice to say, he clearly confused a job interview with a date and his unabashed, brazen propositioning made Harry’s skin crawl, fingers ghosting over his thigh holster, ready to whip out his wand if needed.
“Because I would have to marry him, Ginny!” He exclaims, panicked. He knows it’s nonsense, he doesn’t have anything reasonable in store. There are three sets of eyes on him and Harry tries to focus on Draco’s for some reason, this time wishing he would maybe turn it all around and say something witty, just to calm his raging nerves. It still sometimes amazes Harry, the inexplicable effect Draco has on him, how easily he can show him a completely different perspective with a comforting touch and some stone-cold logic. Harry supposes he does things to Draco, too—he can see it in small, fleeting moments, when he’s reminded Draco has that hidden soft side, that there’s something delicate deep down, and it has taken Harry several years to learn it, to coax it out with careful questions and furtive glances. It sends something rushing along his shoulders and inside his chest, to be allowed to see that side, to truly, organically feel he has a close friend in that strange, mean, pointy creature, and to break through that exterior and get to know the man inside.
“Before you ask: he’s your age, has a normal voice, really likes Quidditch, has a dog, and,” she shrugs playfully, “he’s a total catch.”
Harry… just is, for the moment. While he can muster up a considerable amount of gratitude for his friends wanting to see him happy, some insistent gut feeling tells him that a bet might end in disaster. There’s a vision somewhere there, too, Harry in a red sequin dress, giving out roses and flashing a million-watt smile at men named
—clenches his fists, and lets the water drip down his face and chest, an ice-cold rain of logic and responsibility. His cock hangs half-hard and heavy between his legs and Harry really wishes he could take himself in his hand, wishes he could get a glimpse of the hardness he felt under his palm when he clutched at Draco just minutes ago. It’s normal—he’s young, and maybe a little bit lonely, and all that pent-up frustration and exhaustion just needs an outlet.
Draco’s tense and he doesn’t move an inch, his fingers shaking slightly as he ties the dressing into a knot. “It’s hard to play a game when you don’t know the rules,” he says cryptically. “All done.”
Malfoy smiles coyly, his perfect teeth flashing in the moonlight. Like a predator playing with his food, his tongue peeks out to lick his lips. “Some needed gold, some needed influence—I was able to make them believe they would get both. That their investment would pay off tenfold.” He grins, biting his lip. “And with some… I needed more of a
The morning rush has barely started—crowds of witches and wizards only just beginning to grow in numbers as cracks of Apparition echo through the hall and people rush out of the Floos, hastily dusting off their coats and jackets. There’s a sizable queue to the sandwich stand, nearly as long as the one to the coffee machine. The stranger doesn’t pause at either, nor does he carry anything with him, save for an intimidating mien he seems to radiate as he walks.
while they’re having sex maybe fifteen feet away. He’s clutching at Harry so hard it’ll probably leave bruises; all Draco can focus on are the most acute sensations—the deadly silence ringing in his ears, his cock throbbing in Potter’s arse, fingers massaging his tongue, and the stunning emerald of Potter’s wicked eyes, nearly all swallowed by pupil.
They’re meandering between masses of people going back to work after their breaks and Harry struggles to catch up with his friend. He bumps shoulders with a tall man and does a double-take, seeing he’s wearing a suit so similar to Malfoy’s, Harry thought it was him for a second. He rolls his eyes at himself, once again overthinking everything the prat does, their conversation still fresh in Harry’s head.
Teddy turns around to face him and stares into his eyes, his face a picture of complete bliss, eyes fogged over, lips saliva-slick and slightly open. Harry pulls him in by the neck and licks into that sweet mouth, smiling into the kiss as Teddy shivers under his touch.
“Make me forget,” Draco says moving his hands to press Harry’s hips closer, making them both gasp. “I need—”
mingling with Harry’s choked sobs. The angle slightly shifts then, Draco’s cock brushing against his prostate with every other thrust and Harry is hard and leaking against his abdomen again. He crosses his ankles at the small of Draco’s back to leverage himself and pushes back in time with his thrusts, moaning softly with every tantalising thrust.
“Plans, drop sites, ledgers, contacts, a few accounts, lists of most of their accomplices with papers to prove it,” Malfoy explains, breathless. “Those bastards are everywhere. You’ve got addresses, safehouses, offshore bank accounts. Even their bloody mistresses’ phone numbers—”
about the fantasy of having him. Harry’d had plenty of one-offs and he could always get it if he needed a quickie, but Malfoy... There had always been
“Oh, yes, because everybody would believe my word over the Aurors’, that’s just fucking rich,” he snaps, wrapping the shirt tighter around his middle.
Kingsly turns to Harry with a grave expression. “Harry,” he puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder and quickly steers him a few steps away from the others. “Do you still have that emergency kit of yours?”
Harry wants to counter that but in all honesty, Malfoy’s right. It would be quite risky to try and heal it in his current state so Harry moves to take off his jacket with a displeased grumble. “Why is everything always so sexual with you?”
Something bad finally happened by the end of the second week, just like it ought to in a house filled with mysterious antiques, most imbued with magic older than said house’s foundations. It was a quiet evening, with both of them sorting out some paperwork and preparing a few trinkets to check out for the next day. Draco was lounging in a light, emerald silk robe with gold trimmings and a gold-woven peacock feather on the back. It was cut off over his knees and Draco never wore anything under it, and the way Harry stared at him from time to time made something visceral stir in his stomach.
Quite the contrary, in fact—Draco’s so clearly not alone it stops Harry dead in his tracks. He’s standing by the bar, in the far corner, where the counter curves back to the wall. Carelessly propped up on the bar, Draco’s smiling at a tall man roughly their age, with thick dark curls and dark eyes. He seems so in his element Harry instinctively takes a step back, watching the exchange with a nauseating weight in his stomach. The man is standing so close to Draco that their chests are nearly touching, and so are their hips; Draco says something Harry can’t hear and doesn’t bother to find out as a flash of fire slowly crawls up his spine. The man laughs and leans in, whispers something in Draco’s ear, and Draco laughs and it’s easy, natural, almost unconscious. When the stranger doesn’t move back, smoothly staying in Draco’s space and whispering bullshit into the soft locks just under his temple, Harry realises his fists are clenched so hard his fingers have gone numb.
“No,” Harry whispers and pulls him up by the shoulders. Scrambling for purchase, Draco props his hands up on the headboard and throws his head back, giving Harry access to his neck—he hungrily grazes his teeth over the soft skin, inhaling that impossible smell with his eyes closed, holding Draco’s shoulders in one folded arm and now driving three fingers into him with the other. He’s almost satisfied with the prep, mindful of his above-average size, and feels his cock swell at the thought of burying it in that tight heat, of fucking Draco, of being
“I… might have spiralled when I saw him?” He says testily, as if it already weren’t bleedingly obvious. “I don’t know?” He throws his arms up, knocking the pen off his desk.
“Where on earth did it take us anyway?” Malfoy looks around the road and the flat, empty fields stretching beyond the horizon. They’ve already taken a gloomy, autumn tinge of brownish-grey, with only remnants of vegetation still trying to grow in the scarce October sun.
The realisation he’s developed feelings isn’t nearly as eviscerating as the thought that in some capacity, in some deep, hidden place inside Draco’s heart, those silly, but game-changing feelings might be reciprocated.
, Potter. That’s. No,” he shakes his head, eyes bugging out in shock. He wants to say Potter can’t be serious but, knowing what Draco already knows, he reckons Potter is absolutely, deadly serious.
? Harry brushes it off—it must have been meant for Hermione, who was actually the one who made him and Ron use mobile phones for emergencies in the first place.
“Welcome to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” he says calmly, folding his hands on the table. “I’m sure you remember your time here quite fondly.”
Harry sniffs. “I thought it was meant for Hermione, didn’t answer.” They’re both staring ahead, just enjoying the warmth of the other’s shoulder as they talk and Harry thinks all of it is much more bearable with Ron by his side. Suddenly, he remembers seeing something as Hermione was Apparating them from the Ministry. “Was that Zabini with you? Back at the Ministry?”
Harry nods quickly, and Draco takes a breath as if he wants to say something else. He doesn’t remove his arm, curling his fingers around Harry’s shoulder. Harry wants to hug him over how much Draco
Harry lets out a weak laugh and props his head against the backrest. He can’t really argue with that, can he? Of course Draco’s good looking. It’s an objective thing. He’s still a little pointy and… angular, but he’s filled out since they were in school and his bone structure now only lends his features some considerable refinement. His eyes are steel-grey but their hue changes subtly depending on the lighting and, as Harry has learned over the years, Draco’s mood as well. And there are a few very faint, very delicate speckles of warm gold if one is allowed to look at Draco close enough—they seem to sparkle when he laughs, and look as if they were on fire when he’s angry. Draco’s hair has changed since the War, too. He never slicks it back anymore, having once admitted to Harry, after quite a lot of pestering and even more wine, he never liked the look and only wore them like that to please his father. Since Lucius Malfoy has been out of the picture for quite some time, so has Draco’s old hair and Harry felt strangely moved by that, to see Draco finally be his own person. He now wears it shorter in the back and longer at the top, with a tousled, moonlight-coloured fringe falling over his forehead—it makes him look more approachable, softer, more… Draco.
He gracelessly flops on top of Harry, completely unbothered by all the come now sticking to their sweat-drenched chests, and Harry doesn’t mind the solid, hot weight—he wraps his arms around Draco, unable to move even an inch more, his legs turned into jelly.
“How did you even function, this looks really bad—” Harry reaches out to touch the scabs but Malfoy recoils with a huff.
All those deaths. The Jane Does found dead in dark alleys, the disappearances, illegal potions trafficking, extortion, corruption, the whole bloody trail they’ve been leaving behind all over Britain for fuck knows how long.
“If you must know,” Draco sighs, “We met at the Potioneer and Alchemist Convention last year, he hosted a panel about the alternative applications of Erumpent fluid,” he waves his hand dismissively. “Our teams ended up sitting next to each other at the closing ceremony. He’s… nice, I suppose.” If Draco’s tone is any indication, Daniel is probably all smiles and kindness—Draco never trusts people like that, no matter how good-looking they are.
It all happens too fast and none of it feels real—the screaming match stops them on their way to the hotel and Malfoy’s shouting about being sick of Harry and everything in general, and tries to storm off, stomping through the mud on the side of the road. Harry follows and shouts back, and the oncoming heart of the storm seems to concentrate at his very fingertips as he grabs Malfoy by the collar and hisses at him through clenched teeth. The rain around them rumbles so loud they can barely hear each other’s shouts, and Harry squints at the blinding flashes of lightning that keep blinking in white-yellow pulses.
The crisp morning air helps Harry clear his head as he walks to the nearest shop and picks up some breakfast and two large coffees, surprisingly fancy to be found in a town so small. He’s not sure how Malfoy takes his coffee nowadays, but clearly remembers him putting ungodly amounts of sugar in all his hot drinks back at Hogwarts, so he asks for two extra pumps of caramel in one of the coffees. He doesn’t dwell too much on his complex knowledge of Malfoy’s dietary preferences but, after some deliberation, he also picks up a double chocolate muffin, absently hoping it will shut the bastard up for a few hours.
Harry comes inside and goes straight to the living room—he knows this place like the back of his hand. He’s spent so many days and nights here, more than he could count—telly nights, dinners, get-togethers, sometimes Harry would just drop in unannounced to spend some time with Draco. It’s ridiculous how he knows where his favourite mug is, how he has a favourite spot on the couch and despite all that, he never figured out why it was always so normal, so naturally good, and it feels like he’s here for the very first time. Draco’s steps echo from the hallway as he follows and enters the room to find Harry pacing nervously from one side of the couch to another.
, the incantation falling off his tongue like a vicious hiss. It hits with a burst of blood-red smoke and the skin on her neck breaks out into a scabby, red web all over her skin, sizzling angrily as she falls unconscious. He turns to Harry with a devilish smile, his white teeth glinting in the moonlight and Harry doesn’t have a clue how to deal with the way that makes him feel.
“Three,” a familiar voice sounds next to them, calm and clear, and a second later Draco emerges from the purple fog, holding a golden pocket watch at his face level. “Two,” he says, looking at the intern while all colour drains from the poor lad’s face. “And one. The Swooping Evil Venom solution you were preparing is now as good as garbage, Mr Swan,” Draco says icily, his voice perfectly clear in the otherwise silent room. The intern, Swan, looks like he’s about to faint.
The other thing, though, Harry hasn’t told another soul. It feels much more personal and he is yet to pluck up the courage to let anyone in on
the world, with his terrifying logic, and fresh takes on everything he deems worthy to have a conversation over. It became evident even before they started sleeping with each other, on long, grey afternoons when they talked their days away for lack of anything better to do, forced to lay low for long periods of time only to emerge every once in a while, vigilant and adorned with heavy Glamours.
Harry groans seeing the blood and grime already staining the crisp, white sheets under him, and makes a mental note to thoroughly
“And then, I’ll take my turn, hard and fast,” Draco whispers and pulls out. He lightly slaps Teddy’s underside, cups his balls, and Teddy’s eyes roll back. Harry grabs him by the chin and wipes the tears from the corners of his eyes.
During those mornings, somehow frantic and unrushed at the same time, Potter had asked Draco to call him Harry seven times. The morning light makes his bronze skin glow, accentuating his freckles, and Draco nearly gives in every time (it doesn’t count when he says Harry’s name in bed, it doesn’t).
As far as cafés go, this one looks so normal it’s almost underwhelming. Not that Harry expected a beast to swallow him up as soon as he stepped over the threshold, but his entrance felt a little anticlimactic. There are more tables and chairs, some chunky sofas dolled up with throw pillows, and more than a few potted plants. The only thing that puts Harry on mild alert is that the place looks completely empty. There’s a barista behind the counter who hasn’t even noticed him enter, probably thinking the waitress is back, reading some magazine and fiddling with a teaspoon. The aroma of baked goods is stronger here, and, surprisingly, it’s much more calming than the lavender outside. Harry files away the newly discovered fact that he’s probably food-conditioned for later, and goes further inside, the thick carpet muffling his footsteps.
“Yes, Potter, although ‘with’ is not the word I’d use,” he says tiredly. Harry decides to stay silent, expecting he’s about to hear a little more of Malfoy’s story. His patience is rewarded when Malfoy starts to talk.
“Look at yourself,” Harry gasps, biting Draco’s nipple and watching it swell a beautiful, deep pink, stark against his chest. “You’re so turned on I can
Hand moving to cup Draco’s face, Harry kisses him, deep and paralysing, and Draco immediately responds with a soft whimper, opening up to him in a soft swipe of warm lips. All the terrified hunger Harry’s been carrying inside dissipates into nothing, meaningless in the face of the way Draco tastes, of the joy of seeing him in one piece, bruised and beaten but warm, and real, and
“I’m here, love, I’m here,” he murmured frantically, holding on to Draco’s shirt and breathing in the smell of his hair—it didn’t bring him the usual comfort but it was grounding enough Harry could clear his mind to fully realise the hopelessness of their situation.
Draco perks up at that. He completely forgot Potter should technically be dead after he had groped him in the lab for the first time. Unease radiates off Potter in waves and Draco stays silent and keeps sweating profusely; his muscles are clenched so tight his arse might as well swallow itself and it’s not pretty.
“Harry. I meant I know you’ve never… got along. I know. But I trust your judgement,” Kingsley replies and for a brief second, Harry knows he’s talking to a friend, not the Minister of Magic. “Does he deserve that deal if all this checks out?” he asks and something churns in Harry’s stomach at the thought of Malfoy going free after aiding the actual mob. And yet…
It’s a vicious cycle of blaming one thing on the next and in effect, Harry’s strung so tight he jumps at every unusual sound, or spaces out until Draco snaps his fingers in front of his face or, from time to time, wakes up with a start in the middle of the night, sweaty, breathless, and sometimes half-hard.
His heart hammered in increasing panic as the light flickered with an electric buzz, illuminating the cobwebs hanging on its metal casing and bathing the sordid space in a bloody glow. The ring on his finger seemed to pull him under and—
Draco asked, “Your point?” And spread himself more comfortably in the chaise lounge. “The only flipping my father can do right now is in the comfort of his own grave, so the decision was mine to make.”
“I see you eyeing it, you know,” Draco said one afternoon, looking over some abysmally boring paperwork and signing off reports to Floo back to the office.
it, finds it so incredibly arousing to be manhandled like this, he groans into Draco’s mouth, fruitlessly trying to pick up the pace. The knowledge that Draco can overpower him, hold him down using just his thighs and arms, makes him dizzy with desire. He doesn’t need to be as careful as he would with a girl, not with the way Draco bites at the corner of his jaw and pins him to the couch.
, just where Harry wants him to, mindful not to hurt him. Draco’s eyes are wide, gleaming with surprise, and Harry’s skin crawls with want at the rapid rise and fall of his chest, at his quiet, confused arousal. Harry takes one step, and the next twists into Apparition, landing him right on top of Draco whose surprised gasp is immediately stifled with a bruising kiss.
Naked Draco Malfoy is truly a sight to behold—he lies splayed out on the bed for Harry to ogle—pale, toned, and beautiful, and Harry’s skin feels like it’s on fire. The scars on Draco’s chest seem to glisten silver as they reflect the soft light. There’s that path of dark-blond hair below his navel going down to his pubic hair, pulling Harry’s sole focus lower, to Draco’s cock. It lies hard against his stomach, the pinkened head weeping with precome, already smearing it over his abdomen. It’s maybe half an inch shorter than Harry’s but seems thicker and Harry’s stomach lurches with renewed desire at the thought of what Draco could do with it.
Harry’s idiotic heart is hammering so hard it aches. “You said you haven’t flown in, what? Ten years?” He huffs. “It’s silly— We can’t really go flying but—” He gestures around them and shrugs. “At least the view is—”
Harry turned Draco around by the shoulder, fixated on the way his fingers were gripping the edge of the counter, his knuckles going white-red-pink and Harry kissed the back of his neck, nibbled at his earlobe open-mouthed and hungry.
“It’s… everything,” he rasps. “Everything you need to put them down.” He shrugs. “Provided that you catch them.”
Harry lifts his chin and turns around to look straight at Kingsley. The Minister starts; he casts a Detection Charm with a furrowed brow that quickly goes up his forehead at the confirmation that Harry and Malfoy can indeed see them. Robards’ lips are moving and Kingsley casts him a quick glance, muttering something with his head dipped down so his mouth can't be seen. Harry looks at them intently and shrugs, slowly shaking his head. After a moment of tense deliberation, the two men reluctantly leave. Harry turns back and catches Malfoy propped up on his elbow, wiggling his fingers in a mocking wave.
They’re halfway through week five when Harry’s shoulder-deep in the Mokeskin pouch’s Extendable Charm, looking for a particular book he’s sure is there, and his hand bumps against something smooth and hard. He grips the narrow part of the object and fishes out the bottle of whiskey he bought at Draco’s insistence all those weeks ago, when they just moved around England and healed each other, following weak excuses and their own curiosity.
Draco nods. “I came back. And I know what you think—I came back for you. And while that is… well, correct”—he laughs nervously—“it was also for me, you know? And don’t get me wrong, I hated to feel self-serving yet again, and… what I’m about to say might sound selfish,” he says, looking at Harry with a frown.
“That’s exactly what they want,” Harry says, nosing the soft, silver curls at his temple. “The Aurors will find them. I know you don’t trust them,” he says softly, untucking Draco’s shirt from his trousers and sliding warm hands under the fabric.
Draco’s soul immediately vacates his fucking body and is gone forever as he freezes mid-thrust. His fingers dig into Harry’s hips so hard, he could nearly break the man’s pelvis, and Potter is
That’s as far as facts went and, frankly, there wasn’t too much to go on guesswork-wise either. The press was eerily silent about the fates of the innocent members of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, regardless of the reality of said innocence. Whether it was a deliberate act of defiance against the laws of the old, or whether substantial sums of Galleons still stashed in estates’ secret vaults were quietly passed on to people who were willing to put their silence on sale, it didn’t matter. The renaissance of the shady elite has still come full circle just like it always does throughout history. The Family reared its head suddenly, bearing no resemblance to Voldemort’s old methods and now, Draco Malfoy sat in front of Harry claiming he had information about them.
Harry has to admit it does but it’s not like he’ll say it out loud. He can only sneak another glance and leave it at that.
“Awful,” he looks at her dramatically, and Harry nearly snorts. “My kidnapper had no manners and a dreadful haircut.”
“Oh my god,” Draco whimpered, touching Harry’s hands and finding them drenched. He brought his thumb to Harry’s lower lip and watched him flick his tongue out to catch the moisture and suck the digit into his mouth.
“Harry,” he whispered, the name coming as a broken breath and Harry felt his eyes prickle with hot tears.
“Hullo, sir, can I help you?” He asks, eyeing Harry with suspicion. Harry can’t really blame him, seeing that he basically came to the café, startled a waitress using only his face, walked in, stared at their only customer for Merlin knows how long, and is now slowly backing out of the establishment.
“Let me—” Draco said and lifted himself off, pausing only to cup Harry’s jaw in his palm with a strange, fragile look, the intoxicating scent of his oil lingering between them like a promise.
Harry could come like this—rutting against Draco, naked, wet, and hard, moaning with each shallow thrust, his fingers tangled in silver hair that’s now nowhere near as prim as usual. It’s a striking image and it makes Harry’s breath hitch—the way Draco naturally, unabashedly lets go of his propriety, how he has his long legs wrapped around Harry’s waist, how he moans shamelessly and whispers praise into every other kiss, letting his arousal take over and do things that make Harry’s heart lurch and his cock swell. They move together with an unrelenting force, in a deliberate, dragging rhythm and it’s so unbelievably erotic, Harry knows he might let go completely and come very soon, already feeling the heat building up in his groin, his bollocks going tight. He has other ideas for tonight, though—he slowly breaks the kiss and begins to work his way down Draco’s body. He sucks bruises into Draco’s neck and collarbones and peppers featherlight kisses over every single scar. Draco hisses, arching his back, as Harry sucks on a nipple, bringing it to hardness with his tongue and teeth. There are hands gripping Harry’s hair and Draco looks down at him, muttering incoherently about
“Oh, that was Luna,” Ginny says, collecting herself enough to wipe the crazed look off her face. She kisses Luna’s knuckles. “I love you, babe, but you definitely lost, considering.”
He comes closer, sliding his arms around Draco’s waist. “I haven’t forgiven you yet,” he murmurs against Draco’s lips.
“It smells like I imagined you’d taste,” he said. Draco’s breath caught in his throat into a strangled groan when Harry looked him in the eyes and licked his hand. Slowly, from the heel of his palm up to the tips of his fingers.
All three of them wake up with a start when they hear keys turning and feel the short-lived, cool breeze of wards being taken down (Hermione insists on double safety measures). Preparing for a bit more of a commotion than when there was just the two of them, Harry sneaks away to put sleeping Freddie back in his crib, taking advantage of the kid’s superpower to fall asleep anytime, anywhere.
Draco’s hand moved to cup his jaw; he looked at Harry in soft wonder as he caught his lips again, his wings folding forward and around, encircling them both in a thick, feathery blanket. It drowned out all sound and set Harry’s senses on fire—he could hear Draco’s breathing, the smack of their tongues, the wet slide of skin on oiled skin.
“Since when are you so close with Luna?” Harry blurts without thinking before he can say something fundamentally stupid, like
, coerced and threatened, the bastards lied through their teeth on the stand and every single one had received the same, tired verdict: insufficient evidence. All those treacherous vermin talked about remorse and family, and
The bubble bursts sooner than he expects—the next morning, Harry, still buried under Draco’s sleeping body, gets a text from Ron.
Draco lunges forward, capturing Harry’s mouth once again, all clashing teeth and throaty moans as they fall back onto the sofa, Draco on top. He licks into Harry’s mouth, nestling himself in the vee of his thighs, and holds him by the hair, sending a wave of fire down Harry’s back.
Harry waves at him to be quiet, trying to think of an explanation as to what’s going on. He needs a starting point, he needs something to hold on to, a map that would guide his scattered thoughts, and help him to navigate the whole situation.
“Correct,” Draco says with an air of authority. He did indeed have the expertise; eight long years spent ogling his fellow students in the Quidditch lockers (when he wasn’t busy doing a madman’s bidding) had made Draco quite an expert on the matter, and his new co-worker is a truly superb specimen. The Unspeakables switching from their usual haughty, vicar-ish robes to those tight black jackets was a true godsend, too (he religiously adjusts his own every morning, just a little on the snug side—alas, it has gone tragically unnoticed as of yet).
“I’m going to shower now. Don’t wait up.” With that, he promptly leaves, slamming the bathroom door behind him. A minute later, the steady rush of water fills the room and Harry lies on top of his bed and wonders what on earth could have set Malfoy off so much.
—he jumped from his seat to check up on his nephew. It was heartbreaking, to see the poor little baby so tired and fussy he could only cry to indicate that all he wanted was some peace and quiet.
Malfoy, the stubborn bastard, doesn’t move. “Where are we going?” he demands, and Harry wants to punch him unconscious.
“She had a family emergency and had to leave and I—” he side-eyes Draco who’s looking at him with an amused sort of expectancy. “Wanted company?” Harry finishes lamely, rolling his eyes. It sounds like Draco’s a secret mistress and they’ve been found out by Harry’s disapproving family. Draco’s already smirking which makes Harry believe he thought the exact same thing.
To know Malfoy’s reaction before even proposing it is a poor victory but Harry says it anyway. “I can try another way. With, er”—he swallows—“my hands.”
There was a wall to his right—coarse, wet concrete scratching his arm and he found the strength to crawl alongside it in pitch-black darkness. It felt like ages until a red light illuminated the dark space and Harry understood what happened.
One week in late spring, a man in a trench coat was going from door to door—he visited a few houses every day, clutching a notepad and a pen, questioning and interviewing their neighbours for several minutes each. After visiting about three houses, he would disappear just to come back the next day and keep knocking, keep talking to everyone. By Thursday, he was getting closer and closer to the end of the street, to Harry and Draco’s house. Draco stood by the window every day, watching the man’s every move with a concerned expression and fiddling with the loose thread on his shirt. Harry knew he was nervous, could see it in the taut arch of his shoulders, the redness blooming on his lower lip from worrying it between his teeth, the tense knit of his pale eyebrows. Every day, Harry came up behind Draco, wrapped his arms around his slender waist and propped his chin up at the crook of his neck. And every day, Draco would melt a little against him, letting a soft sigh and kissing his temple.
“I am,” he whispers. “And I’m going to need a place to stay,” he looks at Harry pointedly, making him snort.
and those turn into a strangled cry when Harry goes lower and, placing a reverent kiss at the jut of Draco’s hipbone, wraps his fingers around that glorious cock.
Draco for the first time in what feels like years. How did he never notice how strikingly, devastatingly beautiful Draco is? He’s wearing a white shirt and a pair of trousers as usual, but he’s barefoot and Harry can’t remember if he’s ever seen Draco’s feet before—their slim arches and the long, slender toes dipping into the thick carpet—he looks so soft and domestic, and Harry realises he’s always liked seeing Draco be soft. His shirt is a little loose, two, no, three buttons open at the collar and Harry sees a thin pink scar peeking out, licking over his collarbone and for a moment, he forgets how to breathe.
“I… stopped. I didn’t like the person I was becoming. I was.. losing control,” he says quickly, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes. “And control was something I needed at the time.”
Ron barks out a laugh. “Oh, that’s a whole other thing, I don’t know how he found me, he’s good,” he says begrudgingly, shaking his head.
Potter came every day at nine a.m. sharp. Every day, he had a messenger bag with him, filled to the brim with thick folders and paperwork, and an array of writing utensils clattering about—everything he needed to record all the work to be done and file his report for the DMLE. There was a certain irony in the fact that the man couldn’t seem to escape being employed by the bloody Ministry, directly or not. Draco told him just that and when Potter laughed, the low rumble of it rang in Draco’s ears until the end of the day.
And then, there was the love chair, Harry’s obvious curiosity, the way his canine dug into his lower lip as Draco described its purpose, and Draco knew
! Shh, shh, shhh…” He slides his index and middle finger into Draco’s mouth, expertly shutting him up. There’s another knock on the door and Draco wonders if unemployment is better or worse than simply expiring with his still-hard cock buried inside the most perfect arse in the northern hemisphere.
Harry felt his soul leave his body; he scrambled to tuck himself back in, not having to worry about any technicalities, with his erection having wilted in a fraction of a second. He had never zipped up his trousers so fast in his life and doing
biting at the back of his mind, and the complete, disarming softness in Draco’s face only making it that much harder.
“Look at you, doing murder arts and crafts,” says Harry. He puts all his purchases on the tiny table in the corner. “Come on, I brought breakfast. And I got you something special for being a good criminal,” he says
“Tosser,” Harry laughs and hits him with the closest pillow. Draco grabs it and they play-fight over it until it flies to the coffee table, almost knocking over a glass bowl placed in the middle. They freeze and watch it swivel dangerously until it settles down with a warning thud and they both chuckle, quietly settling back, with Harry’s knees against Draco’s thighs, facing each other.
Ginny’s mouth hangs open. “Merlin’s balls, Potter, you think Malfoy’s hot!” They’re both staring at him in silent awe until there’s a voice coming from the door.
When Draco finally speaks, his voice is measured, although there’s a cautious note lacing his voice as he regards the main attraction of the fair: the Ferris wheel.
“Anything interesting?” The man asks conversationally. They don’t use names here, it’s forbidden. It’s encouraged to come up with aliases but they hadn’t had the talk yet.
Harry gives him a little shove and Draco yelps when his wine almost lands on his crisp, white shirt. He gives Harry a
Harry threw the jacket onto the counter next to where Draco sat, then the condom and lube next to it and it was so mundane to do it the Muggle way, no magic, no wands, just spit and fingers, and them, in a desperate-quiet rush, kissing in a way that didn’t feel like revenge at all.
Harry lets go of the headboard and his hands go to Draco’s belt, shaking a little; Harry doesn’t even need to look at him—the guttural moan Draco let out is invitation enough and Harry makes quick work of Draco’s trousers and pants.
, and Harry reckons men with his looks are not a common occurrence in these parts. His jeans hug his arse in a way that would make a saint drool, his shirt only accentuates the subtle lines of his muscles, and his hair is something out of a magazine, just begging to be pulled on.
“Shh,” Potter laughs softly, pushing Draco backwards and steering him to sit on the chair stood against the wall furthest from the entrance.
Would buying her a coffee to say ‘sorry for traumatising you’ add to the creepiness? Merlin, is that how women feel when facing strange men? Harry nods stiffly to the barista and shuffles out as fast as his legs allow him. As the bell rings above his head once again, Harry wonders how many times in his life he was close to getting hexed or having the police called on him and makes a mental note to abstain from going alone to places in the future.
Malfoy’s jaw twitches. “I said I work with them, didn’t I?” he asks testily. “I’ve been collecting it in secret. For… years. A little personal safeguard, if things ever went south,” he says. “And they did. So I need you to take this, I need you to blow up that bloody mafia to smithereens, I—”
“Hello?” Harry calls. Weirdly, he’s expecting his voice to echo around all this space but it sounds rather muffled, drowning in all the foliage and the stuffy, damp air.
“For what it’s worth, I believe you,” Draco inclines his head and there’s a big chance he’s thinking the same thing Harry is.
“But enough about that,” Draco announces, Summoning his assembled healing station onto the other bed. He turns to look at Harry, slowly shaking his head. “Oh, how the tables have turned, Auror Potter.”
“Their scallops are exquisite!” Draco hisses, momentarily abandoning the defence of his nonexistent childcare skills for the defence of his extraordinary taste buds and their superior seafood preferences.
In other circumstances, Draco could perhaps see the appeal, the threat of being discovered, the knowledge they’re doing something dirty, and wrong, and
Draco shrugs resolutely. “I’ll owl you his details and ask Mother to put a good word so he bumps you up the queue.”
The doorbell at Grimmauld chimes at the beginning of January, on a cold afternoon, and Harry, glad that Kreacher is staying at Hogwarts full-time now, gets up from the sofa with a soft grunt and jogs to the door. Ron and Hermione aren’t supposed to come over for at least another few hours, but Harry doesn’t mind—initially, he did have some trouble warming up to the idea of his friends checking up on him, as if he were a sick Victorian woman about to collapse from a broken heart. It took Harry until Christmas to understand they just wanted the best for him, and to spend time with him—not out of pity, but because they enjoyed his company, no matter what a tosser he’s been lately.
The gaping hole in his heart throbbed at the beloved name and Harry whimpered softly as dull, crippling pain washed over his whole body, centring itself at the back of his head.
.” Draco snickers knowingly as he moves to lean on the backrest, balancing his glass between slender fingers.
Draco’s mouth opened just an inch and then immediately closed, and Harry snorted, feeling his face heat up. “My hair, I mean.”
It was neither the time nor the place for Harry and Draco to freely live their life together and yet, they functioned among those people like chameleons, under a facade of normalcy, behaving like two upstanding singletons, and strong Privacy Charms. To everyone’s knowledge, they were Muggle veterans—two unassuming bachelors who turned to each other after losing their families in the war they fought shoulder in shoulder. Two friends who supported one another in the aftermath of the atrocities they witnessed, and thanks to that signature small-town temperance, nobody ever asked questions. Not about the war, or how they met, or how they got there. But most importantly, nobody asked what was the exact nature of their relationship.
“Oh, to be stood up by a celebrity in the Autumn of your life,” Draco muses, lacing his words with a playful note and Harry can’t help the small smile curving his lips. “How cruel, Potter, to put out a fire before it truly roars! To crave the touch of a young, deft hand that vanquished the darkness with an Expelliarmus,” Draco continues, spurred on by the girls’ giggles; his tone turns to full-on pathos, one hand clutching the front of his shirt, as he looks at Harry with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
His heart melts a little at the thought. Draco would rather die than admit out loud he cares about anything ever, so he shows it instead, and being on the receiving end of that fierce protectiveness is almost addictive. It must be a Slytherin thing, that unrelenting loyalty, the need to protect the ones who are close, important, the ones who matter. And what a wondrous thing it is, to matter to Draco Malfoy, to see him sneer at paparazzi in the streets, to have him ask Harry if he has eaten, to be asked for advice and have one’s opinion be of great importance. Deep down, Harry hopes that it’s also a
“Answer me this and I’ll stop,” Draco says. “Is one of the reasons you don’t want to talk about this the fact that am I at least a little bit right?”
When the three of them move on to the hard part, Harry realises he’s gripping the terrace railing so hard, his confused magic is heating and cooling it over and over again. It’s a good reflection of his own mental state when Kingsley tells him the trial has been scheduled to take place in two months and the Wizengamot won’t budge.
Harry barks out a laugh. “Don’t be a bitch,” he says, lightly elbowing him in the side. “We get to be outside. It’s crowded, easy to blend in, and chaotic enough that we’ll go unnoticed.”
“Did you lock him up?” Robards asks with a manic glint in his eyes, looking around the hall impatiently. “Level seven?”
“Of course,” Claire says. “Is it the pointy blond again?” She asks, not waiting for an answer. “Maybe that one will get you in order, I swear to Circe, such a stubborn young man. But I suppose he has
“We had some friends there, obviously. We got invited to a soirée here, a banquet there, you know how it is,” he says with an eye roll and pauses. “Well, you probably don’t. Anyway, by the time I realised something was… not right, some significant alliances were already made,” he says bitterly. “So I watched those boring parties a little more closely, started to pay attention to things I would have normally brushed off as a nuisance.”
—he probably doesn’t know how Harry got it but doesn’t ask, even though his eyes trace the discoloured letters with curiosity.
Harry tells him the truth. He can't bring himself to lie to him, not now, not about this. All he gets in response is silence. Dreadful, ominous silence as Draco walks away from him and circles the room with a rising frenzy, looking around with a deranged expression, as if expecting someone to jump out of the wardrobe and say it was all a bad joke.
Malfoy lets out a low laugh. “Potter, how on earth you navigated this big bad world until now remains a mystery to me,” he says, drawing his wand. “I’m afraid I’ll need to cut your jacket,” he murmurs and Harry shrugs to let him know it’s fine. He casts a precise, careful
“Hi! Harry, I presume? I’m Amy,” she says brightly, extending out her hand. Harry is pleasantly surprised she doesn’t use his last name—people often say it with a little fascination laced into their voice as if Harry were an interesting phenomenon or a museum showpiece and not an actual person.
and having it come out emerald green. He looks at himself in a mirror, surveys his booze-flushed face and props himself up on the sink, feeling his head spin dangerously.
fucking at work,” Draco says seriously, treating Potter with a patented death glare. The dry-humping makes for an excellent mid-work break but Potter’s lust clearly knows no limits so Draco has to be the responsible one.
“Harry,” he cuts him off. “We all do that. Say, there was a drunken college student in the streets, singing Irish songs, throwing up left and right,” he says. Harry snorts at that, the image of Seamus, of all people, popping into his mind.
“Well,” Draco says, his hands on his hips. “We’re not dead yet, so there’s an upside. However, I did expect more of a welcome committee, ready to escort me before the face of justice. And that is the face of a wrinkly old man—”
“Surrender your wand,” Harry says in a low voice, trying to keep any enjoyment from his tone. It might be amusing to see Malfoy squirm but he really hopes he won’t be stupid enough to try and fight him.
The rush of scalding-hot water lashing at his back drowns out all sound as Harry stands in the shower with one hand on the tile wall. Head bowed down, he tries to gather his thoughts so he doesn’t jump out of his skin with how fast his mind is rushing. The steam condenses on the glass stall door, turning it milky-white, so thick he can hardly breathe. The whole experience feels more like a sensory deprivation trip than a shower. Harry’s skin is flushed a deep pink and it almost stings from the pressure, his whole body string-taut and restless.
Potter is—for lack of a better word—a sexy fucking bastard. No part of him is lanky by any standard anymore (and Draco has both seen and assessed all his
Draco slowly cards his fingers through his fringe. He looks ridiculous: pink-flushed and ruffled, and his smell mingling with the sharp, woody scent of whiskey reminds Harry of Hogsmeade and fireplaces. He wants to lick it off Draco’s lips. “Why not?” Draco shrugs. “If you’re so adamant on spoiling me with low-grade whiskey, who am I to complain?” He doesn’t slur a single word, enunciating every syllable with an elegant drawl and it’s equal parts absurd and attractive, how well the bastard can hold his liquor.
, taken, and not only in some spiritual way. Harry hadn’t bottomed much in his brief sexual history but not for lack of trying on his part—he actually enjoyed getting fucked quite a lot, but always politely agreed to whatever his partners asked for.
, next to the list of his favourite tea brands, amongst scattered notes on the biscuits he likes, things he needs but won’t admit out loud, and things he thinks about himself but aren’t true. Some of those things are too big and important to fit in drawers so Harry learns those and commits them to memory, remembers Draco won’t always wear them like a heart on a sleeve, raw and alive; those things are rare and fleeting like a dream—Harry sometimes wakes up and can’t remember if they’re actually true.
plane of existence,” he says and drops his hands into his own lap. “I suppose, and this is just me theorising right now, that it could be the same with emotions, however hard they are to grasp.”
a challenge—the door to his office slams open and Ginny enters like a red-headed bulldozer with Luna skipping after her, her blond locks bouncing merrily, all in stark contrast to her girlfriend’s manic stance. Harry’s pretty sure Ginny kicked the door open but decides to let it go this time, in favour of hearing what happened to get her going so hard.
They came down slowly and Harry took his time to pull out and he wondered what would happen when he did, if Draco would reverse them both back into what they were in the pub. He finally did, though, took the rubber off and tied it before flicking it to the bin in the corner. They tucked themselves back in and Draco was staring at the floor with astonishing intent until Harry brushed away his hands and zipped Draco up himself. He added a deep kiss and smiled into the press of their lips because Draco most definitely kissed him back, snaking his hands over Harry’s neck and Harry couldn’t help but push him back onto that counter.
Somewhere deep underneath the volatile fog of arousal, confusion, and lurching want, Harry wants to shake Draco into reason. That binary system of seeing the world is so far beneath the whirlwind of gestures and emotions between them, beneath that messy tangle of glances, touches, and sleepless nights, his pragmatism feels like a lie, a smokescreen that has been suffocating them both, perhaps for even longer than these five weeks. It’s so much more complicated and fucked up than ‘sex or power’, it’s like trying to scream with your throat clogged up with dirt, like trying to sop up a river with a sponge.
“And a bluejay was what he associated her with,” Ron continues, “it was safe to assume it was his Patronus. Hence the nickname. Symbolic, innit?”
Nobody would find Malfoy’s body, Harry thinks, he’s the vice-Head Auror, he knows how to cover his tracks.
It’s becoming somewhat predictable, the way Malfoy deflects any topic that’s even remotely difficult or unpleasant with innuendos and flirtations, his mask slipping on like a second skin. Harry should be annoyed but the only thing that he can think about is what happened to Malfoy over the past years to make him like that, what other bad things he had to brush off like they were nothing—that curiosity is a risky thing to entertain but Harry finds himself drawn to the man like a moth to a flame anyway.
Draco huffed, not bothering to hide his smile. “Quite the contrary, actually,” he said, biting his lip. “May I present,
Harry doesn’t invite Draco to the living room. He’s not even sure he should invite him to his bedroom ever again, but the very thought of never doing it with him again makes something screeching claw at the inside of Harry’s ribcage. He props himself up against the kitchen table and crosses his arms. “Talk.”
Eventually, he has to call Ron and make sure London knows about their little run-in with the Family. It’s only when Harry hears Ron’s voice for the first time in over three weeks that he realises how much he’s missed seeing and talking to his best friend every day. He gives a brief report of the events and mentions the whole Zabini thing, disappointed to find Ron hasn’t heard from him. It was a long shot, but it still stings to know the bastard has either gone under the radar in some lavish villa or, Merlin forbid, went straight to the Family with all the information he had. Nonetheless, Ron’s more than happy to chat a bit more which sets Harry at ease, a sense of peace he hasn’t felt for quite some time washing over him like a calming breeze.
Well, that was a disaster, if Harry’s ever seen one. He leans on the nearest wall with a tired groan and tries to process the awkwardness out of his system. It’s ridiculous, frankly, to get secondhand embarrassment from other people’s actions—he didn’t even do anything wrong! At least he thinks so.
“A true Malfoy, Weasley,” Draco smirks. “Right! It’s lunchtime and I’ve taken to watering and nurturing our Saviour in sensible intervals so he doesn’t perish—”
Harry takes pity on him—he pats his back a few times, clinks his bottle against Ron’s, abandoned on the table, and goes back to his seat.
There was a time when Harry forgot to knock and simply let himself inside, planning to slip unnoticed by the interns and see what Draco was up to. His impromptu visit ended with a dozen broken beakers and a concentrated Bundimun acid leak that ate through the floor, leaving a sizzling hole and puffs of green smoke in its wake. The floor below them had to be briefly evacuated until the Maintenance Team took care of the mess and repaired the floor, to Harry’s utter embarrassment, Draco’s scathing fury, and the interns’ absolute mortification. Draco had to be convinced not to fire anyone with a basket of sweets Harry left under the door the next day. Draco was too upset to tell Harry how exactly they store the acid so it doesn’t eat through the containers, only letting out a few indistinct grumbles that sounded like
“I’m amazed at your observation skills,” Harry deadpans. He lets Draco inside and closes the door. “Care to join the Aurors? We could use men like you,” Harry says, following Draco into the living room.
Then it all slowed down, a heavy mist collapsing their shoulders, a slow advance of hips, harder, thicker, higher until it evaporated again into a rushed whirlwind, raindrops on their temples and sweat under their collars.
Harry ignores that last bit, blocking out any images before they have a chance to form. “You are being arrested for participating in activities of an organised crime group,” he says in a monotone voice, “You don’t have to say anything from now on but if you do, you’d better be telling the fucking truth,” he finishes, going off-script. He’s still completely in the dark as to Malfoy’s intentions—they have never been particularly trusting towards one another and Harry doesn’t see that changing anytime soon just because Malfoy had a sudden, suspicious change of heart. He pulls out his wand, not taking his eyes off the blond.
Malfoy scowls at him. He presses his knee between Dmitri’s shoulder blades and adjusts the garrote. “Now—”
“I need a shower,” he says abruptly, and lifts himself off the bed. Draco bolts away, and busies himself with the kettle even though the water must have gone lukewarm a good fifteen minutes ago. He only turns around when Harry opens the bathroom door, mouth open around a question. “I won’t mess it up,” Harry says, lifting his patched up hand.
Draco just laughs—privately, quietly, his voice low and mellifluous and Harry wants to swallow the sound.
“Well, now you have my curiosity, good job! You’ve got yourself a deal, Auror Potter!” Draco says, looking at him in a way that makes Harry sweat.
“Do I want to know what is going on here?” Claire asks curtly and puts a pile of papers on his desk. “Robards wants this filed for tomorrow morning,” she adds, her lips folding into a thin line that tells Harry where she thinks Robards can put his papers.
“It’s a slow night,” Draco says, and kisses down Teddy’s spine. “Isn’t it, baby? A joint and a cock. And then another. Taking our time.”
“Ah, there they are,” Malfoy says flatly, “like children, with their noses stuck to the aquarium glass.” He purses his lips at Harry. “Tell them to
It’s inevitable for everything to shift between them since what happened at the launderette. Since Draco made that step Harry was too scared to make himself, since they stopped pretending that the unbearable tension between them had nothing to do with their mutual attraction. Maybe that’s why Harry’s reluctant to let Draco roam free at first, pulling him back to his lips, into his arms, and under the umbrella of illusion that everything is perfectly fine. The fact that they’re finally touching each other isn’t the scary part, it’s the mythical
Harry summons a few beers from the kitchen and they land in a neat row on the coffee table close to where the male contingent is seated. He tilts his head and, after a few seconds of deliberation, a fresh bottle of wine comes flying from the cellar as well. Harry hopes the House of Black’s reserve vintage is acceptable, the bouquet isn’t
Harry wakes up after a few hours of fitful sleep and more questions than answers. All day, the awful, sick feeling in his stomach makes him feel like he’s done something wrong and unable to forget about it, like there’s something he forgot and should have done ages ago. He blames it on his nerves, on the date he has later tonight, on a number of things that don’t really matter and it manages to stifle his conscience, albeit poorly, like slapping some Spell-o-Tape on a leaking dam.
On a universal, albeit slightly objectifying, scale of one to ten, Harry Potter is an eleven. That goes without saying—he’s dark and toned, with a hard, chiselled stomach, muscled thighs, and lickable biceps. Once Potter showed Draco how easily he can lift the Concealing Spells (for a short amount of time—he quickly loses focus as soon as Draco gets proper access to his lips), Draco learned his eyes glow a radiant juniper and turn nearly black when Potter is aroused or focused. There’s a handful of other shades—like the refreshing emerald when he wakes up (from the one time Potter caught Draco watching him sleep); there’s dim seaweed when he’s surrounded by potion fumes and takes down his spells to glance at Draco while he re-casts the Impervio on his glasses, and there’s a honey-gold tint just around his iris when he’s close enough to kiss (his eyes fall closed a second after and Draco feels it would be weird to ask for an open-eyed kiss, entirely too specific). It’s confusing to keep track of, and awfully distracting in general, so Draco sticks to numbers.
For now, what they had managed to build would have to suffice—this calm, subdued life interlaced with lingering worry, only further fueled by every newspaper thrown onto their lawn. The wands they still had were somewhat of a consolation in all the turmoil they found themselves in and all the Muggle tidbits they collected along the way were as good a distraction as any.
back then, how inadequate Harry felt as he watched his former nemesis saunter around the lab, examining everything with sharp focus, his long, deft fingers drifting over the fragile glass contraptions, brushing the silver faucets and looking at Harry like he wanted to examine him, too. Thinks about how Draco answered all his questions without a hitch, how he moved with a lazy elegance he could only inherit from the Black bloodline, how polite and put-together he was, to the point Harry almost wanted to provoke him somehow, to see his mouth curve in that sneer Harry knew and remembered so well he could probably draw it from memory. As they talked, the dynamic somehow shifted and it seemed as if Draco was the one in charge, telling Harry about his experience and the Potion’s Master degree he got in France after the War, about all the technicalities and methods he wished to apply in the department, about some things Harry would never dream of ever grasping and by the time he had run out of questions, he already knew Malfoy should absolutely get hired. And Harry was going to make sure he did.
They jump as the Ferris wheel stops with an ominous creak, their seat nearly at its very top, with November wind lashing at their flushed faces. Draco takes in the view, not letting go of Harry’s face. Draco’s hair is tousled and his lips are swollen and Harry pulls him closer, dragging his legs into his lap, and, thankfully, has the mind to cast a Notice-Me-Not and a few handy charms for safety’s sake. They make out like teenage movie stars in the culminating moment of their story, and perhaps the setting adds to that sensation, but in movies, people don’t smell like almonds with a hint of bonfire smoke, they don’t make every kiss taste like it could be the last, they don’t have to pray to survive until the end.
“You,” Draco said hoarsely, steering Harry’s head to where he wanted his lips. “You would push me up on that counter,” he said and Harry bit down and Draco’s low moan became the sound of Harry’s imminent demise, reverberating in Draco’s throat and vibrating against his tongue. He came up for air and gently prodded Draco to walk backwards, slowly, until his back hit the counter and Harry hooked his hands under the backs of his thighs, pushing him up, soundlessly, as if it didn’t happen at all.
“You’ve been sprayed with… vintage woman-catnip,” he said gravely. “I need to make sure nobody snatches you.”
The girl was a little surprised to find out Harry doesn’t own a Muggle mobile phone, as most wizards these days have already adapted the wonders of Muggle technology the Magical World was yet to offer. Harry didn’t like the idea of anyone being able to get his number, especially with his kind of notoriety, so he chose to keep relying on his trusty Floo and his friends’ Patronuses. Hermione liked to say it made him seem down-to-earth, Draco liked to say it made him a crazy hermit, and Ginny liked to say it made him an old, old man. Harry, though, liked to say it just made sense.
At times, he finds himself adopting Draco’s inner antagonism, torn between what feels right and what
His voice trembles a little and so does his hand when he brings it up to the side of Draco’s face, cupping his cheek. Draco sighs, a raging storm in those silver eyes and his lips are slightly parted. Harry’s heart is probably in another galaxy by now, but he can’t stop himself so he leans in a little, a fraction of an inch. Closer. Just a little closer.
skin, and think about him in that way at all, but Harry’s perfectly content to chalk it up to the painkiller Draco hands him while he slowly wraps the bandages around his arm. He downs the potion without a word.
“Right,” Draco pipes up. “Ladies, if you would be so kind to go plan the takeover of the Ministry of Magic in the peace of your own home, I would be eternally grateful.”
shape of his buttocks or the roguish curl of his fringe. It’s a harrowing experience, to have the people Harry calls his friends perform alcohol-addled, dramatic readings of their favourite readers’ letters published in the
Harry comes up to him, slowly, seeing Malfoy’s whole body stiffen just a fraction, trapped between Harry and the wall. He lifts his hand and, looking Malfoy straight in the eyes, puts his hand over his flank and squeezes softly. Malfoy recoils with a hiss; he backs up to the wall, nearly knocking a framed picture off of it, and Harry sees that assiduously concealed pain, with no permission to show on his pale face, stamped down in a blink of an eye. The only thing that betrays Malfoy is a harsh breath he lets slip, and his fists, clenched so hard they’re a tone paler than the rest of his skin.
“Well, the Healers say it’s just until your potions start to work, you had massive internal bleeding,” Harry says. “Again,” he adds, pursing his lips.
Draco sighs. “Well then. I suppose if things are to be tense I might as well— Yes.” He nods to himself and looks at Harry. “I’m sorry I asked about the Muggles. I mean, the other day when— Well.”
Draco opens his mouth and quickly closes it and clears his throat. “Point taken,” he says. “And no, I do not get
They reach their goal fairly quickly and in relative silence which feels in equal parts surprising and foreboding. In different circumstances, Harry would call the place rather charming—a sleepy, quiet village with brick houses neatly lined along narrow, cobblestone streets. There are even more fields, patchworked across the hills far away, all empty and smooth, and tranquil under the greyish sky. He spots a few shops here and there, an old church covered in lush, emerald-green vines, there’s even a petrol station where Harry asks about the nearest hotel. Malfoy is strangely quiet throughout the whole trek—he watches their surroundings with carefully concealed curiosity, sparkling silver eyes skittering over unsuspecting Muggles walking to their cars, the goods on display at the station, and even some posters and flyers flaking off an old notice board.
“Oh, yes, thank Merlin our streets are safe,” Draco pipes in, with an equally serious expression. “At this rate, all crime will be wiped out for good. Bless the DMLE.”
"Actually, I did," Draco says haughtily. Sod it, he’s either going to be right and get to see their faces or he’s going to be wrong and forced to leave the country and cut all ties with the people he knows, so the risk could be considered non-existent at this point. Draco very much hopes it’s the former rather than the latter.
They’d just finished their shift and Draco turned around to see Potter without his Glamours again, looking at him with a smile that a regular person would have considered shy, almost boyish. Draco, however, knew the bastard was a hot, insufferable, sexy incubus and was going to be the death of him.
Draco pauses in the middle of the room, watching Harry with mild amusement. “Let me guess. Waiting to have this back?” He wiggles his wand in the air and lets out a laugh at Harry’s constipated face. “I was wondering when you would
“No!” He chokes out. “I mean— yes? As in, objectively— he’s... very, yes. I mean— uhh, sure, that doesn’t—”
Harry’s cock gives a weak twitch at the mere thought of Draco parading naked in their shared hotel room and he briefly considers using some of the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder he still might have in his pouch to hide.
“Harry, love,” Hermione says urgently, a shaky note lacing her voice. “They’re here, Harry, you need to let go now, let them help.” She gently tugs him away by the elbow until Harry finally relents, but not before tucking a bloodied, blond strand behind Draco’s ear.
A deranged thought popped into Harry’s head, to call the British Museum, or perhaps the Vatican, because while he had seen his fair share of art and sculptures, none stood a chance against the statuesque beauty before him. Draco, completely nude, with his chiselled body and soft, honey light scantily shining through the outer feathers of his glorious wings. He looked like an archangel, if archangels were supposed to make people weak with desire, if Draco ever allowed Harry to even call him that.
Harry goes up, his lips stretched in a devious smile around the girth, and slides back down, relaxing his throat and swallowing around the head. The moan Draco lets out is downright
They breathed, holding each other for a few seconds and then, Draco gently pushed him towards the love chair—an apt name, even though Draco wasn’t quite ready to put a name to what they were doing. The sole fact there might have been a name scared the shit out of him until Harry kissed him, leaning against the seat.
There’s a barely noticeable limp to his step and Draco helplessly thinks Harry is probably still a bit sore after last night, and then their shower in the morning. He might even still be a little stretched, and Draco wills his cock to stay down, trying not to think how little it would take to slide back inside him, how devastatingly tight and brilliant it would be, to have Harry moaning and pliant under his hands again.
He doesn’t realise how loud his moan is, or how hard he bucks into the touch. He can’t fully believe what Draco is about to do, either—Harry knows it’s not uncommon, perhaps he sometimes even wondered what it would feel like, he just never expected it could happen to him. All he can think about is how blindingly good it just felt and how he immediately wants Draco to do it again, and again. Draco lets out a low chuckle and murmurs praise against his skin, kissing the spot he just licked, and Harry can’t stop his legs from shaking and tries to arch his back just a little more, silently begging Draco doesn’t change his mind.
Draco cups his arse with one hand, dipping his middle finger a little deeper, and just keeps it there, slowly brushing his hole and Harry moans, low, into the pillow. There’s a ghost of breath next to his ear and Draco nips on his lobe, soothing the spot with his tongue.
They’re on the run, in the middle of fuck-knows-where, fighting a battle royale with wanted criminals, and Harry’s currently sporting a semi for his charge. Circe and Morgana help him.
Harry’s stomach sinks a little because if he understands what Draco is saying, and if what Ginny said about Daniel’s looks is true, then that must mean—
Harry takes a few calming breaths, absently wishing the biscuits smelled a little stronger and feeling hopelessly stupid.
“That okay?” he asked, his hips bucking as he slowly coated his cock with Draco’s essence, mixing it with his precome, and then pressed two wet fingers right where Draco’s had been just seconds ago. Shamelessly spread open, Harry touched himself, pulse quickening when Draco’s wings tensed, the longest feathers bristling up, like an independent entity, fueled solely by desire.
They both snort. Harry’s face feels a little warm and he can’t say he’s not pleased by the sentiment. Coming from Draco, it must mean something.
“And then, that pesky violence issue came back to light—I don’t know why, someone said something, perhaps—and I found myself in quite a pickle, as you do.”
Sod it, he likes calling it that. Draco will roll his eyes at him and look away, and blush when he thinks Harry isn’t looking.
“To think I had covered every bloody possibility except for one,” Malfoy says quietly, holding himself stiff as a board. “I forgot how utterly stupid and hot-headed you are.”
Potter is silent, looking at their boss with what’s supposed to be puppy eyes but only reminds Draco of a teenage student reprimanded for being out of bed after curfew.
“There was a sound like a Mountain Troll giving birth so forgive me for assuming you’re not in your right mind, Mr Potter.” She looks at him expectantly and Harry feels like he’s about to get detention.
