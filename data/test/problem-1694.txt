“A toy,”  he repeated. “How on Earth does anyone play with this thing, Potter?”
But no, Harry pulled him up and slipped under him, begging Draco to fill him through soft touches and quiet whispers.
Not only Harry, it seemed like Ajawera changed Draco as well—lifting all his burdens, putting his worries aside, and filling the emptiness inside him. Here, Draco felt how easy it was to just be himself, and to let himself be around Harry. Be
He was suddenly in front of Harry, grabbing his arms. “What happened? Are you hurt?” His voice was high in panic.
He had always been, for as long as he remembered. When he was a child, he would wander alone in the Manor garden at the early hour of the day, simply enjoying the cool dew under his bare feet, not caring how his father would scold him for taking his shoes off outside. During his teenage years, at Hogwarts, Draco loved the morning more than ever. Growing up without any siblings, he often found communal living somewhat stressful, and he treasured his private hours when the whole castle was still sleeping.
To his horror, Harry could feel his body react to the scent like it never had to anything else before. A flame ignited in his lower belly and the heat spread to every inch of his body quickly. Harry was bewildered. He knew how alphas smelled, he had his fair share of associating with them during his time working at the Ministry, but this was a different scent entirely. It was undoubtedly the scent of an alpha, but there was something else in it that forced the odd reactions from Harry, luring him. And that scent came from the one and only Draco Malfoy, who showed up out of nowhere this morning in the Great Hall of Hogwarts.
a full day to write.”
Harry thrusted, pushing in and pulling out fast, and Draco wasted no time to join in the rhythm, meeting him in the middle with all his might. Usually, Harry opted for a slow and lazy fucking in the morning, but today was a special day. Both of them were too keyed up to take their time as they moved together to chase their releases.
“Oh, thank you, dear! Miss Parkinson picked the dress, you know? Really brilliant, that young lady, she said this emerald colour will bring out the colour of your eyes.” Molly twirled a little to show off her simple cut, but very flattering dress. “She dressed Narcissa in light blue and that matches Draco’s navy suit and, oh, it looks very lovely on them, Harry!”
“Usually to Jakarta or other big cities to find jobs,” she answered. “Most people aim for the government jobs there, but more often than not they end up serving non-magical people for cash or some other petty works.”
Draco let out a weak laugh, bitter but not malicious. “Well, seems like not everyone shares the same moral compass as you, Saint Potter.”
“That’s not what I meant!” she scoffed and shoved Malfoy’s shoulder lightly. “I mean why are we still calling each other with our surnames? That doesn’t sound right anymore.”
The mirth in those grey eyes intensified for a second before a new glint flashed in them. With unexpected strength, Malfoy quickly flipped their positions, pinning Harry down under his weight. “I’d like to see if your opinion will change in a few minutes.”
Malfoy smirked. “Turn around then.”
“Is it that amazing to you?’ Gita asked, genuinely curious.
“Why are we talking on the street? Let’s go to your cottage, I’ll bring some lunch Meme cooked earlier,” said Gita, ushering them to get going again.
Draco moaned as another deep stroke hit him just right. He clutched Harry’s broad shoulders, clawing the skin.
Draco’s hands got even shakier when he resolutely shut the journal. He needed an answer and now that the answer finally presented itself in front of him, he couldn’t bring himself to let go of the ignorance. As Potter had returned to mess the life he had so carefully built, Draco felt like he needed to return to where the riddle was buried and left unsolved.
“Tow it!” Draco squawked.
Two other guards lead Draco to the courtroom, and Draco was grateful Harry wasn't one of them. The moment he entered the room, he knew he'd let himself assume too quickly. Harry and Granger sat in the area reserved for those who wished to watch the trials. He supposed he shouldn't have been surprised Harry could get seats, despite the great demand for them.
Lucius seemed to be considering this when Potter appeared. “Ah, King Lucius. It is good to see you again.”
"The palace is a few hours ride. We should be there in just about time for supper. If we don’t have to take any detours, anyway…"
After a moment, Harry spoke. "Or what, Malfoy?"
When Potter returned, Draco wanted to pick up the story immediately, but Potter seemed to want to talk about the first part of the story.
Harry wiggled at that, and Draco stopped to look up at him. “What?”
Draco stopped in the doorway, unable to decide if he was imagining him or not.
“Actually, the trainer sent a note saying he wouldn’t be able to make it in until noon, so I’m in no rush,” Potter said with a pleased smile.
“What would someone like me do at a state ball, Draco? I’d stand out a mile.”
On a far hill, in the tallest, most crooked tower in the land, there lived a very lonely young man named Draco. He knew he must be a prince, though he could not remember his parents. He had to be. Why else would the witch have captured him and taken him from them? All he knew was this tower and the witch who visited him here, and the "pet" that she often brought with her.
He made it back to the common room to find Pansy waiting for him. "How bad?" she asked him.
Shacklebolt nodded. "Very well. I believe we have covered all the charges. Would you like to add anything else to your defense?"
And it didn’t get any better when he told his father Potter’s request. “You told him what?” Lucius’s temper had been paper-thin since returning from Azkaban, though he’d managed to keep it under control while the Dark Lord had been around. But now? Why would he even consider having the boy hero anywhere near him, let alone living in their home?
True, it was well-furnished, with everything he could possibly need to eat or sleep or take a shower. There was even a wardrobe filled with clothes to wear. There were books to read, and other entertainments to keep him preoccupied, at least those that didn't require magic. Magic itself was forbidden, and Draco hated it. It was as though he'd had one arm tied behind his back. How could he accomplish anything for five years without a lick of magic?
“He needs to be startled,” a voice came from the far side of the courtyard. Draco looked up to see an old man with a long grey beard making his way across to where they stood. “It is a difficult thing to undo the first time, self-transformation, but it can be done. Never fear, majesty.”
Draco blinked. Now he knew the name was familiar. To the point where the hidden memory was making his head spin. He'd experienced this once before—when he'd discovered Lucius's magic hiding a memory of kissing another boy at a gathering shortly before his third year at Hogwarts. So what was he was remembering? Why would he have a memory of Potter's cousin?
“Seven? You’ve had seven…”
Draco felt his cheeks flush again. “To you? Potter that sounds…” It was difficult not to squirm. “What are you saying?”
looked forward to a single one of his aunt’s "visits," for once, he was highly impatient. Time seemed to drag. And yet, at the same time, it was slipping by far too fast. He just wanted Harry to appear once more. Before Fenrir arrived. Because if he showed before Harry… Draco shuddered. It couldn’t happen. It wouldn’t. Harry wouldn’t let it. Still, it didn’t stop Draco from worrying.
"Headache?" Draco asked, taking a cautious step closer.
“Woah! I…need to get ready, first. It’s not even ten,” Draco said, stepping in front of him.
When Draco had finished the final dream, Harry was looking rather stunned. “Harry?”
For some reason, Draco felt a flush spread across his face. “Right. Harry.”
“Mmm…” Draco nodded. “I was a bit…obnoxious when I left, but I’m better now. So…may I come home?” he asked.
Draco nodded. “The earliest ones were more like…more real. But then…” He looked up to meet Potter’s eyes.
After a few minutes, the man nodded. "All right. I ask you respect my privacy while I'm here. I have my reasons. Let's leave it at that."
“Isn’t it obvious?” Potter looked so earnest, but Draco’s head was spinning, and all he could see were those bright green eyes.
There was just something about the other young man. They’d known each other since the other boy had appeared at the doorstep of the kitchen when the two had been quite young. As children, the two had explored all over the kingdom when Harry had been allowed out to play, their adventures growing in scope and excitement until the day Draco’s father had learned of them, and the adventures had been deemed too dangerous for the Crown Prince, and Harry far too common for Draco to be playing with. After that, they had been watched too closely to be allowed to spend much time together, though Draco had still made certain to seek him out as often as he could manage.
"Oh…right. Well…that one wasn’t so bad. Even with the kiss."
“And…what do you think of me?”
"A selfless gesture, gentlemen. And commendable. Though you might have come to myself or the deputy headmaster," she nodded at Snape, who scowled forbiddingly, obviously unimpressed by their idea, "before implementing your plan. Perhaps we might have found a way of integrating your gatherings into the school schedule to minimize their impact."
“And if I could help you find someone who would please her, and give the kingdom the connections it needs, and also fit your requirements?” Blaise asked him.
The first few minutes felt like an hour all on their own, and finally Draco set a timer spell, just to stop himself from checking the clock every five minutes.
"Please. You can tell me some things. Just little things. And I'd be willing to offer something in return for each piece of information. I'd even be willing to sign a wizarding contract not to use anything you tell me in my trial, if it will make you feel more comfortable."
“Tonks? That…ridiculous woman with the pink hair?”
Draco frowned. "Who? Your cousin? I thought he always—"
Time crept along.
He was distracted from his reverent examination of the world around him at a crack to one side. This time, it was Bella who had appeared. She was flying. Without a broom. Draco’s arms tightened around Harry in horror once more.
Draco looked up to see not only his mother, but his father storming towards them. He jumped off Harry’s lap, then looked down at himself, and back at Harry before facing his father once more, a wide grin on his face. “It worked!”
"I found the culprit behind the prohibited gatherings, Headmistress."
"All right, Harry. I'll be right outside. He might not be his father, but he is still a high profile prisoner. If something were to happen…"
Lucius pulled his son away from the other boy. "Go into the house, Draco. I'll deal with you later."
"Even though you completed your tasks?"
Without another word to Potter, he made his way up to the palace, then knocked on the kitchen door. The woman who let him in was too busy to answer any questions, so he soon found himself at a table peeling vegetables. It was a dirty job, but simple, and when he was allowed to take a break for lunch, he set out into the courtyard to look around. Perhaps he would find that Weasley again, and he could point out the king when he arrived.
He was too young to get married! But then, he was hardly in a position to point that out just now. All he could do was hope that his mother’s plan failed. Even if it meant he had to stay in this form forever.
"That's because you've always
The next few weeks were miserable. The house-elf continued to bring food, but there were no more visits, no more assignments. No more word from his benefactor. He was alone. Far more so than before. And he knew it was his own fault.
The grand ballroom had been decked in flowered garlands strung from the columns and chandeliers, and along the edges of the tables that had been draped in white and gold tablecloths and overburdened with food for the guests. The room itself was already full of horribly giggly girls when Draco arrived with his parents. When he failed to see Harry anywhere, his heart dropped, and he braced himself for a long, boring evening filled with simpering girls and knowing glances. Hopefully he would manage to last through the evening with his sanity intact.
"I told you, Malfoy. I can't tell you anything."
Draco felt a sharp flash of annoyance—and possibly something else—lash through him. “No! You’ve been hounding me this whole time, and…I don’t understand. What do you want from me?”
What you need will always love you
I will always love you I hope life, treats you kind
Draco woke up with a start. He looked around, panicked, but there was no sight of Albus or harry.
"Huh? What do yo-"
Good-bye, please don't cry
I will always love you
I would only be in your way
'A closure song for my beloved dragon'  And the song 'I will always love you by Whitney Housten started playing.
'Ah! There it was.' He took the water goblet in his hand. It was the water goblet that Albus transformed before going to the ice cream store and then something caught his eye. Beneath the water goblet, there was a letter placed neatly.
I read a book today and they said always write a letter for closure to your loved ones in case you ever die. So I am doing exactly that.
Harry'
I will always love you
Draco Malfoy had nothing left to lose, even the sharp claws of Voldemort’s shadow wasn’t able to touch him.
“Shall we sit here?” Draco asked, eyes scanning the dry patches of grass near the shoreline of the Lake. “It’s quite late, I don’t fancy going too far.”
Well, Molly was wrong.
Malfoy nodded again and turned to Harry. “I was about to show you something.” He eyed the mostly empty parchment on Harry’s lap and frowned. He no doubt knew Harry forgot his homework. Again. “But you seem busy right now. See you later?”
Still with his excited smile, Scorpius ran to hug his father. “Thank you so much, Father! I love it a lot!”
Malfoy chuckled and shifted to position himself to lie on his side, dragging Harry with him as they were still connected. After a bit of rustling to get comfortable, Malfoy sighed in contentment and draped his arm around Harry’s torso. “What do you want to do?”
Harry shoved his shoulder, pouting harder for being laughed at. “You wouldn’t understand, Draco. You’re basically the grand prize winner of the gene pool lottery. You haven’t gained any weight since we got married. Meanwhile, if I miss one workout, all my muscles turn to fat.”
That night, Harry had been awakened by a nightmare. They happened so often after the war that they had stopped bothering him so much after a while. He just wished they wouldn’t wake him up at an ungodly hour of the night, making him too wide awake to continue his slumber. Knowing he wouldn’t fall asleep anytime soon, Harry had left his room to wander alone around the castle.
"And Lord Voldemort waited for you there? Or did you meet him elsewhere?"
? His father had
That brought Draco up short. "I am?"
If Lucius’s eyebrow could have climbed any higher, it would have. “And why would I let that happen, Draco? You are betrothed, are you not? I was under the impression I was here for a wedding?”
His monologue was only interrupted when Remus and Sirius appeared.
"It was my idea, Potter. Knowledge I used against the school. For
“No! I…would have done the same with anyone!” The truth was, he’d never been the sort to snuggle in his sleep, but he had to find some excuse for his behavior that Potter would believe.
Draco was more prepared the next time Potter came to bring him supper. He'd been thinking more about what he could tell him, and what he could ask. Sometimes, though, he wished he could write it all down. It would make telling the stories easier.
Draco shook his head. “What’s that about?”
“Draco…we’ve known each other for a long time…”
The dark head of the young man whipped up to see who had called to him, and his eyes widened when he saw Draco in the window of the tower. After a moment of staring he shook himself, then turned and approached the tower. "Hello! I didn’t realize that place was occupied."
As it was, Draco was quite sure he’d have to murder the git before the week was out. Everywhere he went, Potter seemed to find a way to be there before he’d arrived. Shouldn’t he be getting lost in this huge place? How did he always seem to know where Draco was going? Or did he just follow him somehow? He’d go to the Library, to find Potter standing at one of the shelves, pulling out a book—often the very book he himself had come to retrieve. Other times, he’d go out to the gardens to wander among the flowers only to find Potter wandering towards him from the opposite direction. It was like he was somehow planning it!
"Potter."
Hadn’t he himself thought that he’d like a relationship as pleasant as Sirius and Remus’s? And he liked Harry. It was true, they didn’t know each other well, but they’d have to be allies. Wouldn’t that be easier if they were friendly?
"Malfoy and I hoped it might be beneficial, especially to the upper years, if we got a chance to unwind this year. I mean, after everything these past few years, well, we've all gone through a lot, ma'am."
Potter’s eyes narrowed. “Never, Draco? Never’s a long time.”
“Axe?” Draco asked. He’d never used that sort of implement before, and the idea made his hands twitch with pain. “I…don’t have one.”
"I see. And what would that accomplish?"
Draco bristled. It wasn't as though he'd gotten anywhere near the bars, after all. Then he remembered that Harry had actually requested this, and knew cooperation would make Harry more likely to talk with him, and took another step back.
The man bowed low, folding nearly in half, his long, stringy hair brushing the floor before he stood up once more. “Severus Snape, Highness. Representative to the Prince of Gryffindor. He did not wish to meet you formally this way, but would like to speak to you out in the gardens, if he might?”
Snape wasn’t easily dissuaded, unfortunately. “If you think I will allow you to do to this girl what your father did to your mother, Prince Draco… We cannot afford another war between our two countries. Ours has barely recovered from the last.”
"Fine. Just… well, whatever you're comfortable with."
“I’d rather not,” Draco returned sourly. He was tugging on Blaise’s arm, but it didn’t stop his friend from approaching the jet-haired young man, who was still dancing with painted-on clothes boy.
“Well, your father’s is pretty significant.”
The King rolled his eyes. “Not that nonsense about his true love again?”
“You thought I’d done this to you. But…why?”
“Yes. Let’s…just…get me changed, please?” she asked.
"No. It is not." He shuffled through the papers in front of him once more. "The attempts on Albus Dumbledore's life. Those happened—"
So you see, though I let all the evil into the world, I also let hope escape, and because of that, he was able to destroy Voldemort, and so evil faded once more.
He and Pansy began to plan a party. Not just any party, but one where all three of the upper years, sixth, seventh and eighth years, from all houses would be invited. The invitations sent with masks charmed to hide all distinguishing features of those who wore them, and the time and place of the party disguised until an hour before the party.
Being called by his last name stung a great deal more than he’d have otherwise expected. “I want to talk to you.”
“Draco.” Harry looks stunned. Possibly even lost.
Potter was watching him, eyes narrowed, and Draco knew the next step would have to be his. His hand came up to curl around the back of Harry’s neck, then pressed his lips to Harry’s. And when he’d become Harry, he couldn’t remember, but the moment Harry’s lips responded to his, he knew he was forgiven. Maybe not of everything, but now they could at least work on the rest—together.
“Thank you. Look, we don’t know each other, and I’m sorry if I’m being a bit snippy. It’s been a long week.”
"Yes, headmistress," both boys said quickly.
“In the
There was a strangled, “Yes,” before Harry’s lips found his neck once more, sucking hard at the skin and making Draco gasp and stretch his neck more.
For a few days, Draco’s heart was lighter. However, when a week had passed, then two, his mother began to harp once more on his marriage. He knew it wouldn’t be long before the next contender to be his bride appeared.
Shacklebolt nodded and pulled out a set of keys to unlock the cell. "Two steps away from the door, Malfoy," he said in the same calm voice.
"Thanks."
“Either. Both, I guess. It’s…odd.”
Potter shrugged. “I’m afraid I can’t afford that, Draco. But if you’re good, I might offer to send for your father when the time comes…”
Weasley watched him for a moment, as though he wanted to ask him something, then seemed to change his mind. “Well, I do hope you’ll like our kingdom here…” he paused, looking at Draco expectantly.
Lucius’s hand curled around his son’s upper arm. “That is enough, Draco. This is the last time.”
He promised himself he would just ask for seconds during their lunch break.
Ah, and there is the famed Malfoy glare. “Free.” And with that word, Draco makes his way down the street, forgetting whatever reason he had come to shop in the first place. It will only be when he returns to his own over-quiet flat that he will remember that he needed to get a few new potions. He promises himself he will go tomorrow—when Potter and his girlfriend (that’s fiancée, he reminds himself) are no longer there.
Malfoy sighed, making a big puff of white breath.
Obviously, Harry hadn’t been paying any attention to his class, so he was startled out of his mind when Slughorn suddenly appeared at his table with his hands on his hips. Harry’s hand slipped and the contents of his vial was splashed onto his face. The glass vial dropped to the ground and broke with a loud noise so that everyone’s eyes were suddenly on him.
, his thought offered helpfully.
They stayed in silence for a long moment, lying close together, enjoying every second of the night. Draco almost thought Harry fell asleep when the man in his arms spoke up again.
from his favorite cousin. When Teddy was old enough to demand things from the adults around him, he asked Malfoy to bring him to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes every week. Not wanting to deal with Ron, Malfoy coaxed him to go with Harry instead, which the toddler immediately refused with a tantrum. “New toys with Dwwaco!” he demanded. Harry had been jealous and a little bitter at the time, feeling his own godson chose Malfoy over him, but he soon found it endearing how Teddy had the cold man wrapped around his tiny fingers.
And here they were now, twelve years into their marriage, fifteen years into their relationship, and forty years into their crazy lives. Draco wanted to pinch himself sometimes, afraid that he was somehow dreaming and would soon wake up in the middle of the war, the Dark Lord still presiding over his house.
As the vow was delivered, it became harder and harder for Harry to see as his eyes were slowly brimmed with unshed tears. He blinked them away, desperate to have his gaze on the man he promised the rest of his life with.
“How so? We were born in the same year.”
Next to his ear, Harry heard Malfoy grit his teeth, but when he spoke again, his voice remained even. “No, Potter, let me go.”
“Are you—,” Harry started, unsure. “Are you okay?”
"You know what?"
Harry, however, failed to consider the big possibility that he was unable to bake.
Draco felt his lips formed a smile without really meaning it. “Okay.” It hurt. He finally understood what people meant when they said there was a situation where you had to smile or else you’d cry. “I guess our time is up then.”
“It means ‘let me’,” Gita translated, reaching out to ruffle Maya’s hair affectionately. “What should we do with her? She’s so in love with you.”
“But you must understand that we… we just can’t be together forever. We just
Draco didn’t know if he was ready to look back, but he would be lying if he said he didn’t want to.
“What?!” Harry immediately paled, knowing what was coming for him. “You told him? Why would you do that?!”
He shifted again to turn to his side, finding the green eyes were now crinkled around the corner from Harry’s wide smile.
That stunning scenery was broken when one of the children saw them coming, noticing that their teacher wasn’t alone that afternoon. Draco quickly found Maya amid the others as the girl suddenly rose to her feet and shrieked. From that moment, all hell broke loose.
This time Harry didn’t know what to say, realizing he never thought about that. So what if Malfoy admitted he was an alpha? Harry was honest when he said he wouldn’t try to get Malfoy to lose his job, or even personally want him gone. It’s not like he could do that either. He knew McGonagall and was sure the Headmistress wouldn’t just hire anyone if she wasn’t certain they could do their job properly. And Malfoy had been a perfect Potions professor so far.
“I’m quite certain that’s not how writing essays work… but whatever,” he shrugged. “Look what I made.”
“Hey,” Draco said quietly. “Let’s go to the beach again tomorrow.”
“What is the use of it?”
Draco raised his eyes. “Of course you know all about it.”
The touch felt divine, Malfoy’s hand was cold compared to Harry’s burning body, even through the layers of his robe. Unable to help himself, Harry moaned as pleasure spread from that innocent contact. WIth Malfoy so close to him, he could barely register the mortification and embarrassment in his mind amid all the haze of overwhelming arousal.
Maybe he took a suppressant like other alphas working in a public workplace, but Harry knew even that suppressant didn't work perfectly—yet he hadn’t seen any crack in Malfoy.
Draco, who had been helping her chop the ingredients, turned to her in curiosity. “Where do people go if they leave?”
“I’d like to try.”
The fourth finger slowly made its way inside him. Harry gasped with how full he felt.
“Um,” Harry mumbled. It was never an easy task to come up with an acceptable excuse for his friends. “Out for a bit?”
“But…” Malfoy frowned, uncertain. “But it looks so… excruciating. I don’t know if a heat is supposed to be that painful.”
“And you?”
“That’s-Ah, thank you, Malfoy,” he said quietly, just a notch above a whisper. “Um, what about you? Do you already know what you want to do after this?”
He asked McGonagall to reconsider the wisdom of her decision. The witch didn’t budge, stating that both Harry and Malfoy were both adults and they were expected to act as such—starting from sharing a space without harming each other in any way. It really didn’t help that there weren’t many Eighth years coming back to Hogwarts, as it left them with enough rooms for each to be occupied by only two students. Meaning, no one would be a witness in case an “accident” occurs. Still worried for his safety, Harry went the extra mile to ask Hermione if she could put a proper ward on his poster bed to avoid any attack when he sleeps. Hermione, seemingly sharing McGonagall’s opinion that they should be mature enough now, just rolled her eyes and told him to grow up.
“I’m sorry about that.” Harry let out a long sigh and flopped back on his bed. “Hermione is always intense when it comes to studying. And I really messed up big time.”
“Do you care to provide any explanation on why you submitted an essay barely two inches long when Slughorn clearly required a full foot as the minimum length?” she demanded hotly. “Slughorn was really mad, Harry. Slughorn! The man who worships the ground you walk on, he was mad because he thinks you’re disrespecting him!”
"Really?” This time Malfoy was actually sneering. “If not getting me fired with that accusation, what exactly do you want, Potter?"
Harry opened his mouth to retort but apparently Malfoy hadn’t quite finished. “And you reached the climax of your life? Really, Potter? You’re eighteen, for Merlin’s sake. And people thought
Nothing could hurt them when they were in control of their fate, of what kind of pain they would suffer, and when they would have it. This felt like an acceptance, a sweet surrender. Draco never felt more liberated.
Harry groaned tiredly, just thinking of being outside in the dark with this temperature gave him a shudder. “I don’t get it, Malfoy. You said this is a job that no one wants, but why do you always take it? It’s pointless, a total waste of energy, and it’s. Fucking.
And he was ready for the pain, he would take it without hesitation. The way Potter took him, his body, his mind, his heart. All of him. It was Potter who gave them all in the first place, anyway, he had nothing when he approached him. So if Potter wanted to take everything he gave him later, then be it. If it would leave him with a bigger hole than before, emptier, then let that void in him gape open.
“I don’t feel so good, Nev,” Harry said, struggling to keep his voice even. “I think I’ll just go back to my room.”
No vow could convince him better than those grey eyes that forever was indeed ahead of them.
Draco went silent again for a moment. “Thank you,” he said eventually. “He… Father used to be my hero when I was a child, you know? He was everything, I always looked up to him for every aspect of my life. I imitated all his habits. I followed him everywhere until Mother had to physically restrain me more often than not as I got unbearably clingy.” He laughed a little and Harry smiled, the image of tiny Draco walking on Lucius’s trails felt somewhat endearing. “And he was the best father I could have asked for. He was loving, even when he didn’t show it a lot. He pampered me and he cared about my mother. He was perfect.” He paused and took a breath. “Until he wasn’t anymore.”
He shrugged again. “You clearly have something troubling you. I can hardly gain anything from pushing you to study if you haven’t got your troubles sorted out. And I can’t help with sorting out your problems if you don’t tell me about it.” He stopped, his face contemplative. “I wasn’t sure if you trust me enough for it, that’s why I never tried or said anything.”
“Draco—he—” her voice broke a little. “Harry, Lucius died in Azkaban.”
She gave him an intense stare full of concern. "We got everything sorted before you left," she said gently. "I didn't think you'd be back this soon."
Draco took her hand that was resting on his arm, slowly lifting it to land a featherlike kiss on her knuckles. When his lips touched her skin, he closed his eyes and let the kiss linger.
Maya nodded solemnly, a frown forming between her brows. “He’s so sad… and then he died from the sadness.”
That in itself was very confusing. People presented as their inner wolf at the age of twenty, so the scent couldn’t come from a student. But no alpha was allowed to work at schools or anywhere with a lot of children. It was unexpected to smell that scent first thing after entering the Great Hall of Hogwarts.
Draco offered a small smile. “Thank you,” he whispered and tucked his head on Harry’s chest again, gently placing it above his heart. “May you always lead from the beating in your chest.”
Draco wiped the rest of tears on his cheeks, savoring the magical moment when he accepted that he and Harry were once madly in love with each other.
“All alone?”
“Excuse me?” he uttered after a minute of stretched silence.
, Harry?”
. The red velvet batter.
Draco sighed and looked away. “It’s not really about his death anymore,” he said.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut from the painful clench of his chest. Harry Potter was gone.
“What are you working on?” Harry had asked once.
“Yeah,” Harry replied awkwardly, fighting a blush of his own. He took a little vial to distract himself, busying himself with putting his potion into it.
Gita stared at the spot Maya was standing just a moment before. “Yeah, Harry said about the law in your place that wizards can only Apparate when they reach seventeen. I think that the minimum age for Apparition has started being implemented in other big cities, but in traditional communities like this, you can find children as young as five Apparating all over the place.”
“Only a little. Not very good,” Maya nodded. “I learn because of you.”
Gita laughed and shook her head. “Is this what they call
Since Harry had gone through so much just to make sure their memories wouldn’t hurt him the way it would otherwise, Draco would respect him the way he would want. By reminiscing what they had. What they once were.
But of course, it was not without any complication for him. Because nothing was ever easy for Harry Potter.
Draco, so full of love with the man above him he felt like bursting, could do nothing else but obey. His pleasure peaked as he desperately clutched his husband’s shoulders for leverage, gasping his name when he finally tumbled over the edge.
“I hope this is good enough.”
Draco sighed, not expecting to have his head spinning so early in the morning. The headache added so much to his already tired body. He should have known that Potter wouldn't make this easy for him, even after his death. "Maybe his friends never truly understood him," he said flatly. "I bet me being on his will makes speculating even more fun."
“Fixing the slap bracelet,” Malfoy answered distractedly.
Draco and Harry spent their late nights and mornings curled up together on the creaky bed in their little cottage, making love or just lazily enjoying each other’s presence and warmth. When the sun was high, they would rise and help Meme with whatever tasks they could do. Later in the afternoon, the two would head to the gazebo near the fields to play with local children after they finished their class with Gita—the witch banned them from coming during the class since the last time they turned it into complete chaos. In the evenings, they would usually stroll around the village, aimlessly stargazing the visible constellations and talking about nothing in particular, just the two of them.
.” Draco flopped to his back on the grass after the last child was gone, his voice was still breathless from the exertion. “I hope that helps you learn your place, Potty.”
Draco reached out his arm to catch a girl who twirled on her toes and inevitably lost balance. “Should we leave, then?” he asked Gita, absently hearing Harry grunted a few feet from him.
With the sudden quietness, Draco turned to Harry, finding the man wasn’t exactly free either. Harry was standing on the edge of the gazebo and there were three kids—two boys and a girl—dangling cheerfully on his limbs. Draco met his eyes for a second, enough to catch the fluster in Harry’s face and Draco let out an incredulous laugh.
Not that Harry had been paying attention to him.
“No,” Harry mumbled.
Harry’s confusion only grew when his eyes caught up and spotted another unusual thing in the hall. There, at the end of the teachers’ table, sat someone Harry hadn’t seen for years. But, no matter how long it was, Harry would always know who that platinum blond hair belonged to.
“I begged you to,” Harry admitted, feeling his cheeks heating up from the memories.
?” he gestured to himself, suddenly self-conscious about his untamed hair and messy appearance, and then to Draco, sitting all poised on the grass, strikingly beautiful and elegant.
Harry stared at his hair for a moment. His shoulder length, white blonde hair which fell so naturally around his pointy face. He once asked Draco why he grew his hair so long and
Harry didn’t know how Malfoy did it, but it had almost been a week since his heat and Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy long enough to even call his name. Every time he saw a glimpse of platinum blond hair, the man would suddenly disappear the next second. It was getting frustrating.
,” he said with urgency this time, his whole body was shaking as he was chasing his peak. “
Meme, who asked Draco and Harry to also call her that, was strong and magically powerful enough to single-handedly work on her family’s fields everyday, leaving Gita to do the rest of house chores and help their elderly neighbors. Today, though, she was leaving with Harry in the morning since the man insisted on helping. Draco wondered when the two would be back.
Draco tightened the grip in his hands as his face broke into the most brilliant smile Harry ever saw. The grey eyes gleamed in raw emotions. Happiness, contentment, pride.
Hearing the businesslike curiosity in Harry’s voice almost made Draco smile. “I don’t know, but it’s my best bet. I mean, Malfoy name would never be like it was before—not that I want it to be—but being married to a respected family will increase my chance to gain a reasonable position in the Ministry,” he explained. “I could hopefully work my way from there.”
Draco felt his cheeks heat up as he turned to Harry with a frown. “I don’t look any different from what you see every night,” he huffed and looked down at his attire. For this event, Gita insisted that they wear the traditional clothes for every male who would attend the ritual. Not wanting to seem rude after being invited to such a sacred festival, the two of them agreed. Draco didn’t expect the full outfit only consisted of red shorts and a fabric with big black and white checkered pattern, leaving his torso completely bare. He never felt so exposed in his whole life.
“It was pure luck and you know it,” Harry retorted without any heat as he joined Draco on the ground.
am?" Malfoy said in a half-mocking manner that reminded Harry of how this git used to be in the past.
“I received it yesterday from Mr. Potter’s trusted acquaintance. She made an Unbreakable Vow with him to deliver his testament in case anything happens. Mr. Potter understood the dangerous nature of his work and had everything prepared. They knew that the Vow would be enough evidence to prove his death.”
Harry’s fingers slipped into Draco’s hair, brushing a strand back gently. “We have come a long way, huh?”
It started when Draco came home from his work trip to the US on an international wizarding case.
“But it’s not like I hate this place,” Gita added a moment later.
“It’s not strong enough.”
Ron and Hermione wouldn’t understand his simple purpose.
“Father?”
Draco squeezed his eyes again, tempering his outburst. “You panicked. Of course. Of course, Potter, your natural survival instinct will choose the most dangerous and grandiose escape from death. How could I forget, you refuse to think about anything until it’s already happened.”
, Draco mentally cursed as he walked to the crates.
“I don’t know, Potter,” he said slowly, trying not to raise his voice and offend this newly mental wizard in front of him. He wasn’t sure how dangerous it was if someone as magically powerful as Potter got his head damaged—and Draco didn’t want to chance it. “Please let go of my parchment.”
Draco’s love language was turning Harry’s night from horrible to spectacular by just being there and
Harry snorted. “Well, yeah. It’s the first, right?”
“What? You did,” she teased. “By the way, welcome to Ajawera, Draco.”
“Granger, Potter is an adult, stop treating him like a child. He knows what he’s doing,” he retorted coldly.
The War was barely over. Voldemort was dead, but his shadow somehow remained. It remained in the tears of mourning parents, the innocent and unknowing blinks of the newly orphaned babies, the painful sobs of wounded children. It stayed with the surviving heroes, wary and hurting. The shadow was dark, hovering over them, unyielding.
Now, over ten years into his marriage with Harry Potter, Draco still cherished his time in the morning. Harry was not an early bird by any means. Quite the opposite, really. When he was still working as an auror, Draco was convinced that Harry made it his personal mission to break the record of going to work late in all Magical Law Enforcement history. After his resignation, Draco knew Harry slept in seven days a week.
It started to become a problem and he probably needed to do something about his troubles of keeping up with his schoolwork, but it wasn’t a pleasant topic for him to confront, even with just himself in his mind. So, Harry always chose to push the thought away.
He forced himself to study the parchment, trying to make out the sentence. It was not as hard as he thought, the letter was very short, Potter’s wording straightforward and impersonal.
Harry laughed harder at that. “I don’t know if I should regret teaching you wandless magic or not.”
Harry wouldn’t lie, the idea of exclusively having Draco to himself in an intimate way enticed him more than he could explain. He imagined touching him, just like they did more and more often after Draco confessed his inclination in physical touches, but with complete awareness that their touches meant something more, something reserved just for the two of them.
Malfoy frowned at him, every bit of his expression silently telling Harry how much of a nuisance he was. “The Warming Charm we were all taught during our Auror training, of course.”
The worst, Draco wanted to say, but he just hummed instead and nuzzled Scorpius’s hair.
“Malfoy… fuck me,” he pleaded, his hand gripping Malfoy’s wrist, stopping it from the unforgiving movements on his cock.
which—Gita told them—was a surprisingly literal translation of honeymoon by dissecting the word into honey and moon. Neither Draco and Harry tried to correct them, partly because of the language barrier and they simply didn’t see the point in that. Explaining their actual situation would be way too much of a bother.
Harry sighed and ran his palm on his face, averting his eyes from Draco. “I was… kind of baited?”
Then again, travelling this far was not the only thing he checked out from his First Time list this afternoon. If anyone told Draco five years ago he would one day be taking a fifteen hours flight on a Muggle plane from London to Bali, he would easily call them mental. But five years ago Draco had everything he could ask for, and Harry Potter was just a petty rival of his. Things changed a lot in five years.
Harry hummed quietly in response. Even if he couldn’t completely understand, at least in the sense Malfoy was implying, he could still sympathize with the man. It had been long enough after the war but many people were still hostile toward him and others with the Dark Mark. It made sense if Malfoy saw the opportunity of overseas missions as his temporary escape.
A smile curved in his mouth. “I want to kiss you. Can I?”
“I—,” Harry stammered, taken aback by the raw defeat in Malfoy’s voice. “Um, yeah, okay.”
Potter refused to let his gaze falter. “We aren’t petty rivals anymore, are we? Why can’t we be friends now?”
“What?” Harry startled at the same time Malfoy made a noise of surprise himself.
Harry didn’t know how long he stared at those lips, but at one point, they seemed to slowly get closer. They stopped, as though uncertain, and then moved closer still. They got so close that Harry had to look up to find a pair of pale eyes boring into his own, fierce and intense.
“Oops?”
Suddenly, Draco withdrew one of his hands and—before Harry could process the loss—slowly put it on the base of Harry’s neck. He inhaled a rushed breath as he felt the warm hand make contact with his skin, his eyes unable to look away.
Draco nodded at him and turned to Harry. “Wait for me in the library?”
Sometime later, Malfoy yawned and stretched, making his white shirt ride up to show a glimpse of his pale stomach. Harry would be lying if he said he didn’t glance his way on purpose.
He didn’t seem interested in exchanging more pleasantries. Malfoy quickly turned to Parkinson again. “Pans, I think I should—”
At that time, Draco remembered the fiery green eyes in the middle of the blazing room, and he wanted that. With nothing left to lose, he went for it, and got what he desired against all odds. After the first time, came the second, and then the third. Draco couldn’t stop coming back, wanting and getting every time.
Draco was beyond floored.
Tonight, though, the universe decided to be against Harry. When he sat at the teachers’ table for dinner, Harry was grateful to find the Great Hall was devoid of a certain alpha’s scent, thinking Malfoy must have left long before he was there—or maybe Malfoy decided to skip dinner entirely. But, as he piled some pasta onto his plate, Malfoy walked through the door, followed by a bunch of students from various years and all houses.
So these days, Malfoy could be easily spotted in the Eighth year common room with the three of them. When he was not studying with Hermione—or in his words, letting Hermione catch up to him,
He thought about their small but cosy wedding venue, picturing it getting filled with people. It didn’t even matter that he knew every single one of them, the problem was that they all would have their focus on him. A suppressed shudder went through his spine.
Draco loved her, he really did, but he knew it was not the same. The thing between them couldn’t be compared to say the least. The love he had for her grew slowly, gradually, in a calm, forgiving manner. It started as mutual respect, which evolved into trust, and now it had grown into a sense of affection from their silent promise of a life-long friendship.
“Nice to see you, Auror Potter! Oh, wait, but you are not an Auror anymore, are you, if I heard the news correctly? I think it was a complete shame, Mr. Potter,” he said as the opening of his long monologue on how wrong Harry’s choice of leaving the Auror force was and all other things that went wrong in the Savior’s life.
“Oh, you’re right.” Potter looked a little sheepish again, but otherwise he remained undeterred. “Should we try another one, then? Knock, knock.”
Draco hummed, looking down at his son.
“Why should he?” Ron frowned. “The thing is basically useless, it has no quality of being a practical joke object.”
Trying to lift his head, Harry shivered despite how hot he felt. “I’m okay, just…,” he gritted. For a moment, Harry thought the pain in his abdomen had slowly subsided, but to Harry’s horror, it only traveled south. When the painful pulse stopped at his crotch, a realization hit him.
It had been a long day. Draco made a little mistake in Potions class and Slughorn was not holding himself back from going in on him. He knew better than to expect anything more from Slughorn, no matter how ridiculous his teacher had been. He had set his cauldron just a tad too hot, making his potion boil before it was supposed to, and Slughorn wasn’t hesitant in the slightest to tell him how much of a failure his project was, completely discrediting every perfect piece of work he had done in his class until now.
“So I’ll play against Harry?” asked Draco.
But of course his friends didn’t understand. They wouldn’t. They didn’t have the same mission as Harry did at the moment. Deciding to ignore his friends, Harry glanced across the hall again, only to find Malfoy pushing his barely touched plate away, like he was done with his breakfast. Harry couldn’t have him leave just yet. He had to move fast.
Harry just walked faster.
Scorpius took a step back with a gasp. “What is it?” he asked, pale eyes gleaming with hope and excitement.
Harry, nonplussed, didn’t move. Malfoy rolled his eyes and grabbed Harry’s left hand, straightening the arm.
“Keep telling yourself that, Potter.”
“Potter!”
Together, hands still clasped, they just sat there, inhaling the fresh night air. Draco leaned back onto his free hand, head thrown back to watch the glittering sky. Harry was a whole lot more interested in watching him.
Draco did know, but he didn’t know where that certainty came from. “I do, and I know you know that, too.” Draco paused. “Does it scare you?”
Unconsciously, Harry’s hand slipped under his robe, grabbing his half-hard cock. Harry closed his eyes, a moan escaped him from the first upward stroke.
All that form of self-reliance fascinated Draco. He never realized the complicated way his society operated back in England until he threw himself to this place where everything was so simple. Everyone seemed to naturally possess powerful magic, as it was the one thing that kept them going for so long.
It’s okay, Draco wanted to tell him. It was different. It felt different. They weren’t standing precariously on the edge of a cliff like before, wary of a little nudge that would tip them over, scared that the pain of their past would push them to the end. No, right now was not the same. They were standing in a safe distance from the edge, taking their time, knowing they would jump eventually but decided to live in the moment when the two of them were there together, on top of the world.
Draco’s eyebrows rose high as he stopped the knife in his hand. “Serving Muggles with their magic? Isn’t it illegal?”
But, not five minutes later, something stopped Harry in his tracks. Malfoy who was close on his tail bumped into his back.
“And you’re not even trying to tell him to do his work?” she demanded.
The gaze of those green eyes faltered just for a second before softening. “How do you want us to make it count?”
Draco gasped. “Did she just… did she just Apparate?” He turned to Harry, wanting to confirm what he just witnessed, and the man returned his look with raised brows, slight astonishment glinting from his eyes.
“I heard they used science instead of logic,” Harry said with a grin.
When they set a blind eye for the looming end, they were left with all the time in the world.
Draco watched the man, dark curls blowing in the late afternoon wind, vivid green eyes gazing at the setting sun. They arrived at this beach about half an hour ago, but none of them had initiated a conversation so far. The beach was empty, and Harry had led Draco to wander around, paddling at the water’s edge just to feel the gentle waves on their feet. As the sun shifted nearer to the horizon, Harry left the water to find a dry spot for them to sit, Draco trailing behind him still without words. Now they sat together close, arms brushing every time Harry moved to idly play with the sand.
“The git has changed, huh?” Ron said slowly.
Life in Ajawera had been amazing so far.
Slowly, Harry trailed after him, watching the foreign looking diamond dust floating around them. They looked even more remarkable up close. The ice crystals were so tiny, yet from the way they sparkled softly, it was as if every single one of them had a life of their own. Harry never had anything so effortlessly take his breath away like this, at least not since the first time he was introduced to magic when he was eleven. This certainly felt like a strange form of magic to him.
“Excuse me?” he asked hesitantly, knowing the girl wouldn’t understand him but still trying to be polite to her.
Harry felt heat creeping up to his cheeks. “Oh,” he mumbled, eloquent as ever. “Thank you? Please don’t think too much about what Hermione said. She always overreacts like that.”
Instead of answering, Scorpius stretched his tiny body and made sleepy noises—his usual mumbling of gibberish. Draco found the sight too adorable to resist peppering more kisses on his son’s face.
“As I once said, you’re really not that hard to read.” Draco grinned at him. “And try saying something else.”
“Mate, you better go see Draco now,” Ron said and gently put his palm on his shoulder.
“Say my name, Draco,” Harry repeated, firmer this time.
“Beautiful,” he whispered, his voice fervent. Slowly, he looked up to meet Draco’s dilated grey eyes, his expression turned into a soft, wistful smile. “Mine.”
“Oh, yeah, sorry.” Harry sheepishly bit his tongue. “I mean, after that then?”
. Maybe that's the lipgloss. Or maybe that's just Draco.
Next to Draco, Harry laughed hard, his palm patting his back in his mirth while Draco could only chuckle, trying to hide his blush. This little girl was just too adorable.
Again, faster than he could process, Draco felt Harry’s mouth on his cock, teasingly licking and lapping on the head. Draco moaned as he tried to prop himself on his elbows, wanting to see his husband better. As if encouraged by Draco’s watchful gaze, Harry smirked and grabbed his hard shaft in his palm, prompting another soft moan from Draco.
Draco was half listening to the solicitor’s explanation and half struggling to process everything. Engel offered him to take a look at the parchment in his hand, which Draco took and scanned without really reading anything on it, his head still reeling. Though, he could recognize that untidy scrawls anywhere.
“It should,” said Harry. “Do you want the marriage?”
Harry didn’t know if it was Malfoy’s deep voice right next to his ear calling his name, his scent engulfing him, or his fingers on
’ was once his reason. But duty to whom? His parents weren't there anymore to care about the family name, and Draco had stopped caring longer than he could remember.
As the sun began moving to the west, Draco watched people leave their houses to head in the same direction, each household carrying a big pot of what he assumed was homemade food. Meme and Gita were making their own pot inside, the smell of tasteful delicacies filling the air, while Draco and Harry waited in the front yard.
“How—,” Draco started, disoriented. “How did you even get this when he died in an accident? Did you always have it with you? How did you know he died—”
If there was anything Harry learned in his years living in the Wizarding World, it’s that their Ministry of Magic was corrupted in a sense that public opinions often mattered more for them than integrity. Still, it was hard to believe that they would go as far as obscuring a murder done by their own, the victim being a convicted Death Eater or not.
Draco smiled to himself. Just one more reason to get married, then. “I’ll get married and you’ll leave the country. We don’t have that much time left, do we?”
This was so bad. Harry hurriedly left the room.
Just like last night, they took their time, making love lazily, every little movement intended to make their pleasure simmer and last. Draco couldn’t remember how many times he had Harry ride him in the past, but this morning felt like the first time all over again. The intensity of Harry’s gaze on him, the way Harry moaned his own name to tell how good Draco felt, the way they connected until they became one, neither was aware when one ended and the other began. It lasted longer than any sex they had before, Harry reducing him to an incoherent mess as he was drowning in all the pleasure.
“Draco,” Harry moaned louder, catching his eyes. “Say my name.”
It was obvious that Harry caught that, too. He went silent for a moment, looking down at his feet, before gesturing for them to walk again. Draco could only oblige.
Without any more words, Draco yanked his parchment free from Potter’s clutch and hurriedly bolted from the library, feeling Potter’s oddly intense gaze on his back. His experiences during  the war had sharpened his fight or flight instinct, ensuring him to always choose flight every time.
was the one losing it, seeing that nothing made sense for him lately.
“Potter, you need to let me go.”
“Oh, Mr. Malfoy,” Grinspoon said with a controlled surprise in his voice at Draco’s sudden appearance. A sneer instantly formed in his face, as he didn't even try to hide his contempt at the man—similar to many other people in the Wizarding World who still thought it was okay to openly hate on Draco for his past. Harry didn’t like it one bit as he felt anger bubble up into the pit of his stomach.
His question was cut short as Harry suddenly had his mouth on his, kissing him deeply. Harry’s hand shot up to Draco’s jaw, tilting his head a little to allow him to deepen the kiss. His other hand was on his hip, urging Draco to roll on his side for a more comfortable position. Soon, Draco let his own hands roamed Harry’s body in return, lifting his shirt a little, making the grass below them tickle his skin.
“Of course, the more the merrier. You’re lucky that you’re here in time to see it, it’s going to be an experience of a lifetime!”
Something in those eyes nudged Harry to blurt his words unthinkingly, “I’ll stay with you.”
“Am I not doing a good job looking like one?” Harry said lightly, his grin widened.
If he had to be honest, Draco was scared to find out the answer. He couldn’t decide whether he truly wanted to know or not, but one part of him knew he needed it. Harry Potter had planned to return to Draco’s life after his own ended, and he must have a reason for that. Even if Draco wouldn’t like the reason, it would at least be a closure for the overdue solution of this old mystery.
“Oh Merlin, Draco’s fan!” Harry exclaimed with a laugh.
Slowly, he turned to face his furious boyfriend as Hermione and Ron ushered a confused Healer out of his room, following her and quietly closing the door behind their backs. Great, now they were leaving Harry to deal with this alone. Draco wouldn’t hold back if no one was around.
“Kindly shut up, Potter.”
“Good evening, sir. I didn’t want to interrupt but it seems like you have been having a pleasant conversation with my partner, I couldn’t help but to join in,” Draco said smoothly, the smile still in place, thinly veiling his hatred for Mr. Grinspoon.
“I never talked about this to anyone, not even Mother. But, of course, she understood. She always did,” he whispered and cleared his throat. “The thing is, I had mourned the loss of my father, my hero, since the day he was gone from my life. And it was a long time ago. I couldn’t feel anything when they sent him straight to Azkaban after the War. I thought I would also feel nothing when he was really gone forever.”
McGonagall continued introducing the new professor, prompting Malfoy to stand up in his spot thus making more applause and whistles erupt in the hall. Amid his confusion, Harry stared at the side profile of Malfoy, who was still standing on full display just across the table. He kept his gaze until the man sat back down, following his movements as he felt the scent begin to overwhelm him again.
Draco held his stare for a long moment. If Harry wouldn’t give him answers, Draco wondered if he would give him something else. Only one way to find out. “Can we make it count?”
They stayed there in silence for a while, arms around each other and a soft smile on their faces, wistful for whatever
“Just get me to my room, Malfoy,” Harry whined, beyond caring that he sounded so pathetic.
“Ron!” Hermione shoved his shoulder but she herself was visibly holding back a laugh from the image. Harry, on the other hand, was openly laughing with Ron.
Draco reread the last sentence over and over, carving it in his brain. He flipped to the next page to make sure that was indeed Harry’s last message before closing his journal. Leaving it on the sand, Draco stood up and walked toward the water, his long hair flying in the strong wind.
His husband looked so scandalised with his own made-up predicament that Draco let out a hearty laugh from his belly. “Oh, Harry, I thought I was supposed to be the dramatic one in this relationship,” he said between his laughs, shaking his head.
“Actually, sire, if you do not mind, I would like to marry him in my own kingdom.”
you, after all…”
“Yeah?” The young man who’d been hidden by the wig raised an eyebrow. “Tell me. Do you always come off this snotty, or come on this strong?”
? That’s ridiculous. I want to go
“Do you want me?” Harry asked, stopping the flow of hesitant words from Draco.
There was something dark in the man’s responding smile. “In a way. I was simply here to meet you, precious Prince. Eighteen today, is it not?”
Draco blinked at the first man’s words. Niece? King? That had to mean that the man was a noble, at least…the other didn’t appear to be. And the young man seemed quite unassuming. Not to mention how familiar the two men were with him. Still, if Draco was to believe the first man’s words…this was his mother’s cousin. So they had to be coming to his birthday, didn’t they?
Harry’s response was easily as simple. “I will,” he said with a smile, then pulled Draco gently down onto the bed.
Dumbledore nodded, then set to work. “Intelligence will stand him in good stead. But his ability to change form will not appear until the day Tom’s spell takes effect. He will change to his alternate form, and there stay until someone comes to break the spell. The vines will grow around his resting place until that day, and keep him safe from harm. He will live.”
Potter seemed to have no pity. He refused to stop or slow when Draco demanded to, or when he said he wouldn’t be able to move another step. At night, even though Draco’s father had packed feather beds and comforters for each of them, he refused to let Draco use one. “If we use them out here in the wilds, who knows what could happen to them? They’d likely be forever ruined.”
The two took a few minutes to recover from the magical backlash, but once Draco recovered, he turned to check on Harry. Harry stared at him with wide eyes. Even if he hadn't known before, Harry's reaction let him know the spell was gone.
Draco nodded, glancing at Harriet. All he could do was hope that the next morning, he would be happily betrothed—to Prince Harry of Gryffindor.
“No. That one’s…not quite as bad. Almost normal. Except for your…obsession with me.”
“What next? You obviously have something planned, or you wouldn’t have bothered asking me to stay here.”
“I think I’ll turn in. It’s been a long day.”
Potter nodded. "So many things might have changed," he said.
Potter nodded. “Yes.” Draco was about to shout for joy when Potter spoke again. “If…”
The first came in the form of his aunt Andromeda, who Draco had never seen but from afar, or in the few pictures his mother owned of her from when they were young.
insulted him.
“It’s just…ever since the battle…I…I’ve been having these dreams.”
The dress Pansy had been carrying fell to the floor in a soft flump of velvet. “Prince…Oh, Draco…what have you done? What are you thinking? Your mother won’t be fooled for long!”
Draco turned back to him. If he could tell anyone, it was Potter. After all, if he had to suffer through them, then Potter should, too. “I dream about you…chasing me. Or…being friends with me. Or…more…” An image from his last dream rose in his mind. The two of them twined on his bed. He turned fully away from him and looked out at the street again.
"From your father's ideas, you mean. And we both know how impossible that would have been."
Harry led the way to one of the interrogation chambers, and Draco tried to remind himself this wasn't going to be like before, with Aurors badgering him about every little thing he might have done. This would just be Harry and him talking. Hopefully about that day.
"It won't Kingsley. I promise."
“You had my wand! You could have done anything to it!”
“I hate him! If I have to stay here with him, I will kill him!”
It was only a moment before Narcissa turned back to look at her son. “So…this is who you wish to marry, Draco?”
"That useless lump is your cousin?" Draco asked, appalled. He'd never have guessed. The two were so different. Was this boy a Muggle, too?
“Twenty is just around the corner, I assure you. And if you have not found a bride within that time…who knows what might happen. You cannot keep rejecting every girl you see, Draco. There must be someone out there who would appeal to you?”
Draco nodded. "I'll be here." After all, it wasn't like he was going anywhere soon.
But Harry seems unwilling to see or hear now. The month spent with Draco seems to have drained him of something—hope, perhaps? “Whatever this is about, Malfoy…just…leave it.” And he closes the door in Draco’s face.
Trying not to let the fact that Harry was gone shake him, Draco got up and dressed in his riding outfit, then made his way down to the stables. Perhaps Harry had just needed to deal with a few things early this morning? But even as he walked down to the stables, he knew he wouldn’t find Harry there.
“No. Probably not. But he might be willing for a day or two. As long as it might take your mother to accept ‘her’ for your bride, and once you have her acceptance, there’s nothing she can do, is there?”
Harry ignored him. "Sir, I would like to speak on this defendant's behalf, if I may?"
He led Harriet to the spot in front of the throne, then nodded slightly. “Mother.”
Draco had dreamed of this moment for so long, it took a bit of time before he realized that this wasn’t necessarily going to end the way his dreams always had. He pulled back and looked at Harry. “What… Wait… You can’t… Harry…”
“Yes.” Harry leaned down to kiss him, and then the fingers were gone, and something else took their place. The pressure was intense, and Draco clung to Harry, the pleasant feeling of need he’d had before doused in the pain. He couldn’t help but hope that the feeling that he was about to be torn apart was just part—a very small part—of the First time, and that it would fade. When Harry stilled once more, and the burning had only faded a bit, Draco whimpered. This couldn’t really be It, could it? This was what everyone craved so much?
“What do you mean? Of course I am. They all want to rule at my side. Of course they want me. Doesn’t mean I want them…” He scowled. “Some are…especially persistent. Believe me, if I didn’t have to be here, I wouldn’t be.”
The King stepped forward to protect his son, but the wizard pointed his staff at the boy. “One more step, Lucius, and you have no heir. I help you, and this is how you repay me?”
When he arrived in the living room, it was to see him with the list. It took him only a moment before he realized what it was. "That's not…"
“…Can’t do this much longer, you know. The king is coming, and he’ll be furious when he finds out…”
"All right." Potter smiled, and leant back against the wall to watch him.
“No. Not exactly. But…I think he’ll be gone, either way.” Or at least, he hoped so. If he was here much longer, Draco was certain he’d have to kill the git.
There was a long pause before Harry spoke. “Well, it’s…kind of a weird story, really. This guy and…well, his dog, I suppose…” He looked as though there had been a great deal more to it, but wasn’t quite certain how to put it into words.
Muggle or not, those people were hurting this boy, and he wasn't going to allow it. "Want to stay with me?"
Draco shifted his legs, spreading them apart so that he could bend them at the knee and grind up against Harry. Apparently this was quite well-received, as Harry groaned, then shifted to reach for something and pushed Draco’s knees up to his chest as he sat back. “It’ll burn and sting a bit, but I’ll try to stretch you as much as possible, okay?”
Harry smiled sheepishly. “Sorry. Tickles.”
Potter looked at him for a moment, sizing him up, then shook his head. “No…that’s all right.” He turned to the door, locking it with a spell, then turned back to look at Draco again. “So…what is it that you need to explain?”
“Oh?”
Even though he wanted to say yes, it was difficult. What if this was a trick to make him look bad. “What about your horse?”
"Don't ask questions, Malfoy." Harry didn't even bother looking at him, but kept his gaze on Shacklebolt. "I'm sure, Kingsley. I can handle him."
"Since you couldn't seem to follow a simple instruction, I suppose we will need to make certain no further parties occur."
Draco nodded, then sighed. "So… do I still get a question?"
Draco nodded. “Thank you.” He dropped the horse’s reins, and watched as it obediently followed after its master as he continued to pull the cart up the road towards the castle.
I never knew anything different. Our world was filled with people like us: purebloods, moreover, purebloods who supported the Dark Lord, whether openly or in secret, though more in secret than not. Many, like father, claimed they were merely spelled to obey, but we, their children, were told differently. We were all merely biding our time until the Dark Lord could rise once more.
After the war, everything happened so fast. All Draco could remember was that one moment, he was hugging his parents and being held by them, and the next, all three of them were being bound by those around them in the hall. He hadn't expected anything better, really, given their part in the battle, but it didn't make it any easier.
After a moment, Harry nodded, smiling at the memory of the night before the words had provoked. “All right. But if I don’t see you soon, I’ll be sending Sirius after you.”
When Draco entered the chosen room during lunch break, he found himself even more nervous than usual. This could all go incredibly wrong. What if he hated him even more than he might have before all this? What if he wasn't even Potter? Would it matter? Should it? After all, they got on well.
“Why would I? Gorgeous place.”
made that decision? Draco…Malfoy,” Harry said, switching names with a sigh at another glare from Draco. “I only did what any kid would have done. Protected his friend from a bully. It’s not my fault you were a git.”
“What could you possibly want from me?” Draco sneered.
Harry was peering at him through the bars. "You okay, Malfoy? You're a bit pale."
Sure enough, Harry’s main stable-boy, Seamus, shook his head when Draco asked for Harry. “He isn’t here. Haven’t seen him all morning. Nor those new friends of his. I could saddle your Egan, if you liked.”
She glanced between the three men, then glowered at Draco. “The things I do for you. It will take me a bit. And we’ll need to do his hair…that…wig…” She glanced at the bedraggled mop in Harry’s hands. “It just won’t do. But we’ll figure something out,” she said to calm Draco before he could begin to panic. “And we’ll have to do his face, as well. No woman attempting to become the queen would go without cosmetics. But that’s easily dealt with.” She moved to the sofa near the fireplace, then waved Harry over, and began to hold the dress against him, sighing at just how much she was going to have to change.
“I…it’s complicated…”
“I’m not! I’m…” He stopped, realizing the other man would never believe it if he said he was a prince. “I’m just…doing what I’m told.”
“No buts. I…have to go. But…I’ll come up to your room. Tonight. If you’re really serious?”
If it meant he could get away from Bella and Fenrir, Draco was sure he could have done anything Harry asked. "Yes," he said, grinning back. "When?"
Draco had decided that grand balls should be banished. In fact, he would banish them himself, just as soon as he became king. Especially ones where anyone would be forced to find a bride.
Harry looked up, surprised. "What do you care?"
Potter blinked, the hope fading in his eyes. “Oh. Well, what is it?”
“You…suggested it?” his father asked, looking a touch ill at the idea.
“Do you? Or are you just convincing yourself that you do?”
Draco turned to him. "You don't remember anything? Not even being in Brighton once?"
Draco sighed and looked away. “On the Hogwarts Express.”
! He blinked open crusty eyes to see Potter standing over him. “You didn’t even make supper last night. When I came home, you were fast asleep. What happened?”
“Not really? Then…what?”
Beaming at his friend, Draco shook his head. “No. I will put in the best of words for you, Blaise. Particularly if you can manage this miracle for me.”
Queen Narcissa’s eyes narrowed. “What have you done?” she asked in a growl.
him. "Please… you don't have to remove the spell, if that's what you're worried about. Just… stay and talk. For a bit."
“What do you mean, Draco? I’m not trying to get even with you.”
First-born? Meaning that he had siblings? "I…have brothers and sisters?" he asked, shocked at the idea that he had even more family.
“I said so, didn’t I?” Draco asked with a huff. He should never have told him, honestly. Coming here had been a horrible idea.
Draco’s eyes slid shut. “I wanted it so bad I could taste it.” And then Harry’s lips were on his once more, and Draco moaned as Harry’s tongue pressed into his mouth. He put his hands on Harry’s back, pulling him closer, but after a moment he pulled away. “Don’t…aren’t you dating Weasley’s sister? I thought…you liked girls. I mean…” He took a calming breath. “Aside from the fact that you hate me…”
He decided to test out the theory. The next task the house-elf brought him, he left a note in the book addressed to Potter. There was no response. Which meant one of three things: they hadn't seen the note, which seemed unlikely, or he was wrong, and the person assumed it was a joke, or maybe, he was right, and Potter was refusing to admit it.
“Oh, I’m sure they’ll know, Draco, but if you should get a chance, simply tell them that Tom sends his regards.”
“And you felt he needed a dragon?” the King asked, the growl less hidden now.
The boy frowned, nodding. "Yeah. They all think I'm a freak," he muttered.
A quick glance around the tables showed at least half of the upper years seated there, though whether it they'd made it here first, or they'd never attended in the first place, Draco couldn't have said. Part of him wanted to glance at the Gryffindor table, but another part of him scared to know if Potter even attended the gatherings in the first place. He couldn't look. If he was there, he knew his heart would break.
She smiled. "Mister Potter. May I ask what is going on?"
“Good. Sirius?”
“Of course, Prin—Draco,” Harry said with a small grin as he corrected himself, and Draco felt himself smile wider in return. “I’ll saddle up one of the other horses as well. Shouldn’t take me too long.” He disappeared into the stables, and Draco settled on the bench Harry had been sitting on with a soft sigh.
Finally, at long last, their son was born. Prince Draco was everything the King and Queen had wanted in a child, and they wanted him to have the best of everything, so they sent for the most powerful witches and wizards in their land as well as the neighboring kingdoms, inviting them to a feast in their son’s honor, knowing that each witch and wizard would give the boy gifts that would make him even greater than he was.
Harry stepped closer. "I think I know you pretty well, Draco."
“That’s not the point, Malfoy. The point is to get you talking to people who might actually be friendly with you if you weren’t such an arse.”
Shacklebolt opened the door, whispered a binding spell, and Draco winced as he found his hands tugged behind his back and bound there. "I wasn't trying to do anything," he grumbled.
Shacklebolt conferred with the other two men, their voices hushed enough Draco couldn't understand them. Instead, he shot Harry another glare. "I didn't ask for your help, Potter."
“No. But it’s a start. I’m willing to try, at least.”
“Well, I’m not allowed to spend much time with anyone. So what would it matter if I spent a few minutes here and there with you?”
Potter shrugged. “There was an accident. Spilled something on mine, so I decided to come in here and sleep while the elves fixed it, since you’ve been gone all weekend. I figured you wouldn’t mind.”
He pulled out the bowls, then dished himself out a spoonful to taste it, smiling when the taste of the food he’d been imagining crossed his palate.
“Then I am afraid we will have to return without them. I have work to attend to, and I intend to bring my betrothed with me,” he said, turning a leer in Draco’s direction.
Unfortunately, Lucius knew he could not back down now. Whoever this man was, this was who his son would marry. He gathered his dignity best he could and greeted the man. “Welcome, stranger. And what can I do for you?”
Draco looked up at the familiar voice and glowered at Potter. Normally, he’d have said nothing, but after more than a week of not being able to escape the git, plus this weekend, and even worse, this morning, the Firewhiskey seemed to be all that was needed to loosen his tongue. “Why can’t you just leave me alone? Aren’t we even yet?”
Padfoot jumped back. “Fucking hell!”
“I just turned eighteen, mother!”
But let me start at the beginning.
“Draco…are you…”
“I did. I don’t know what you said to convince him, but…”
Draco scowled at the sight, then hurried off through the dancing crowd to find Blaise. “Come on. We’re out of here.”
“Tomorrow. We will have supper, and then retire, and in the morning, we will see.”
Then Moony spoke again. “Why don’t you go back with him, Harry? We’ll follow behind. I doubt he could carry all three of us, after all, and hopefully the two of you can come up with something?”
Draco assumed the woman still hugging him and sniffling was Narcissa. That meant that Bella truly had been his aunt. At least that explained how she had managed to abduct him… "So…you…want me back?"
“Ah, but at no time did I tell you that you were above all, Draco. You are a being of this world, just as others are. And you must find a way to reconcile yourself to that. Otherwise, yours will be a lonely and short existence. People do not like being insulted. No matter who does the insulting.”
*	*	*
The Queen still looked a bit horrified, but even now, Draco could see his father seemed to understand. Finally, he nodded, then took the Queen’s elbow, pulling her aside so they could talk quietly for a moment. Draco could see she didn’t particularly like the way their conversation was going, either. Lucius was quick to shush her as her voice rose, but finally, she nodded, though she was still scowling. “Very well, Lucius. On your own head be it.” She turned to the girls, who had all been watching this wide-eyed, and caught their attention before leading them back into the castle. Most looked rather disappointed, now that the Prince was back in human form. Draco knew that they’d all have loved to get their claws into him.
So who did she know who would be able to convince her? The Minister, perhaps? And at least some of the Order. No, that was already too many people. He took out a sheet of parchment and listed off names of those who fit. Who was left from the Order? He could at least cross of the girls. His visitor was definitely a man. It didn't decrease the list much, though.
And Harry is jealous, that’s certain. But not of Ginny. He wants Draco. Wants him to stop dancing with others, and dance only for him.
“Empire. Our lands far outstrip the miniscule lands your family rules,” Draco said, his chin going up.
Draco nodded. "Yes."
"Doesn't work like that, Draco. Now. Are you going to be good?"
“Why I’d give up Ginny for you, though…”
his family, you fool!"
And just like that, Potter was gone.
The two were quiet after that, but every time Draco glanced at Harry, he could see him rubbing at his head. He kept quiet, though. Even if Harry had taken advice from him, others would convince him he'd only done it to help himself in the long run. It wasn't worth it. Getting the headache to go away wouldn't make Harry's memories of their day together to come back. For that, he'd have to actually believe them, and there was no reason for him to.
“Let go of me, Potter…let me out.”
"You have seen something else. Once." But he supposed once wouldn't be enough to save him. "Never mind, Potter."
“Oh, go on babbling. If I fall asleep, feel free to ignore me…” Draco said with a smirk.
“Maybe you’ll be able to fly,” Harry said with a laugh. It was a joke between the two friends. When Draco wasn’t running from place to place, he was gazing up at the sky, watching the birds.
Potter huffed. “Just…let me talk?”
Draco scowled, too. “I suppose. If you like that sort…”
Swallowing, Draco nodded. He couldn't offer a defense against that. After all, he'd used the spell. Did it really matter why?
“And what have you made for supper?”
“Unfortunately it’s all I have available right now. The food is packed away in the wagon, and it would be too much hassle to dig it out. And we don’t have time to stop and hunt for anything…”
At one point, when he had been younger, he had asked her who she was, and she said she was his auntie, and that she had taken him to raise as a favor to her sister. Draco personally refused to believe this, but he kept any guesses as to the truth to himself. He didn’t want her to let Fenny play with him. Ever.
Harriet stumbled on the step at that, and Draco thought he saw a blush spread across her cheeks. “Are you all right?” he asked.
"It's the rules, Malfoy. Any prisoner out of their cell or in court is required to have shackles. Be glad I only bound your wrists."
His thoughts chased him through what felt the longest day of his life, and by the time he made his way down to the ball in his silver-green formal robes, it was difficult to even hold up his head. Had he just given up everything he’d ever wanted to someone who did not want him back? What if Harry never showed? What would he do then?
It was the biggest mistake he'd made since the day he'd attempted to leave this place.
Every time he speculated on who it might be, his mind always ended up with one conclusion. He really wanted it to be Harry Potter.
Potter grinned. “Nope.” He moved to step into the room.
At first there was nothing, but just as Draco was about to give up and try something else, he saw a flicker out of the corner of his eyes. Silvery blue. He tried the same motion again, pleased when he saw the tip of a wing appear. The question was, could he use them? After all, flying wasn’t something one did every day. Not as a human, anyway.
“See…?”
"You trying to get me to hurt you, Malfoy? Because it's not going to work."
Draco sighed. If he were honest with himself, he wasn't sure why he was bothering. After all, even if Harry did remember, what would it change? Perhaps Harry was right, and he should just forget it.
Draco nodded. “Right.” He turned and began gathering wood again, and soon the cart was as full as he could manage, and he took up the handles.
Draco had to think about that one for a moment before he shook his head no.
Draco wanted to rail at the man, but Potter had done it for him. "Kingsley, you can't—" He sighed. "What if it were your family? Would you have stayed home? Can you blame her?"
Each man and woman exclaimed at the Prince’s beauty, and how pleased they were that he had finally been born, but hidden among them was the wizard. He watched with growing hatred as the King, Queen, and all their subjects adored the Prince, then went away to plan.
Remus nodded again. “Things are beginning to come together, yes. We thought it would be prudent for Harry to make a few contacts while the palace was being worked on, and what better place than a royal birthday celebration?”
Harry looked up with a smile. “Your father’s Luatha decided he had nothing better to do, I’m afraid, highness. You’re looking…”
“Yeah. With a girl. I’ve never done this before with a guy, Draco.”
Sleep was the only comfort, now, for in dreams, he was still there. In dreams, their conversations took on new meaning. And together, they built something more together.
So when he found a chance to escape on the morning of his birthday, he took it. His guards had been distracted from watching him by the parade of food being brought in to the kitchen, and Draco slipped out a side door, and into the gardens. He hadn’t managed to be outside in several days, and the need to feel wind and smell fresh air was beginning to distract him from anything else.
But Dumbledore was quick to stand at her side. “Do not weep, your highness. All is not lost.”
“I didn’t say you were,” Draco said sharply, no longer able to meet Potter’s eyes.
what sorts of things he’s forced me to do? Washing dishes! Cooking for him!”
“I don’t…” Draco said weakly.
Once Draco finished, the two stayed silent for a bit.
Harry nodded. "Here. Take these. He says they might be able to track us, and we’ll need things to throw them off our trail. But you’ll need to throw them so I can maneuver around them if needed, okay?"
“No you haven’t, Draco.”
Draco took a long ride. After his encounter, he needed it. What he didn’t need was to run into another stranger. An even mover bizarre stranger than the one at the royal stables.
“Yes! You hate me! Why…” Draco stopped, confused. “Why?” he asked again.
Snape slammed his hand down on the desk. "Do. Not! Lie to me, boy. I know you are behind these parties, and I will put a stop to them, even if I must  keep you in detention for the rest of the year!"
“My only problem is that he’d never allow it. If it was just that it would upset him…yes. You are the one I would ask for. No matter what he said.”
“Shhh…” Harry smiled. “I want this to be perfect for you.” He tugged Draco gently toward the bed. “So. Tell me.”
He was going to have to confront Potter. Find out what sort of spell he'd had placed on him, and how. Probably through the wand Potter had stolen from him. It was the only thing that made sense, after all. Otherwise, why would he have given it back? And there was nothing else of Draco’s that he’d had possession of in just that way.
"Palace?" Draco asked, alarmed. He wasn’t sure he wanted to meet royalty. "Why are we going to the palace?"
Shacklebolt turned to him, surprised. "About the curses? Otherwise, your statement will need to wait, Mister Potter."
Blinking at that, Draco looked into his lap. He truly hadn’t ever thought of it that way, but it was hardly going to be something he’d admit to Potter, whether or not they were getting on. "It…doesn’t matter," he finally said softly.
“And then what, Potter?”
“Well, it was a long afternoon. I think I’ll go take a shower. Good night, all.”
Harry shook his head, then stood. "No. I guess we're done." He stayed quiet for a minute before he spoke again. "But if I can help you—"
“Yes, mother. So…what…?”
“I won’t initiate anything,” Potter assured him.
For the first time, we see Harry's expression come alive at the sight of the other man. “Draco…”
This pronouncement met with dead silence from the other two men, who seemed to be having some sort of silent conversation between them. Finally, Potter’s hand fell on Draco’s shoulder. “I meant to teach you a lesson in humility, Draco. But I obviously forgot one thing. This wasn’t just about humiliating you.”
“Well, I don’t know about that…but…if it is…” Harry reached out to stroke over Draco’s cheek. “I don’t think I’d mind,” he whispered.
Narrowing his eyes, Potter glowered at him for another long minute, and for a moment, Draco wondered if he'd actually pushed too hard. Potter stepped back and leant against the wall.
Lucius purses his lips. “Very well. I will…talk to my son.”
“You’re repeating my words again, Potter.”
This latest one, Daphne something or other, seemed even more brainless than his mother’s usual finds. Even as she answered the questions they asked her, his estimation of her intelligence shrank.
"I know. But after last time, it's probably best I don't ask about them."
Draco closed his eyes. Of course Snape recognized him. He couldn't help but wonder if Snape had placed a tracking spell on him that night, but it didn't matter either way, he supposed.
Draco’s unease seems palpable, and for a moment, we can tell that he is ready to flee. “I…”
They moved out of Draco's cell, Harry leading the way down the hall and past other cells, though Draco avoided glancing into them. He didn't want to know if the other prisoners might be watching them as they passed. He knew most of them would be friends or acquaintances, or worse still, family. Aside from his parents, he wasn't sure who had survived. Nor had he been willing to ask any of his guards.
Obsession is a dangerous thing. Most people know this. But sometimes, the obsession can be reworked into something more. This tale tells how such a thing can happen.
Draco shot a look at Potter, then turned to his father fully. “Yes. I’m…miserable. Do you
It was full dark, now, and Draco pressed his face into Harry’s back, trying to relax, waiting for another attack. But even if one never came, what awaited him at the end of this journey? He’d never known anything but Bella and Fenrir. And while Harry was sweet and kind, or at least seemed so, Draco couldn’t be sure that others would be. That was one thing, at least, he had learned from his aunt.
Draco's gaze didn't move from Shacklebolt's. "Yes. Either under command from Lord Voldemort or the Carrows, sir."
“So you forced yourself on me?”
Annoyed, Draco turned away. "You've always believed the worst of me."
Draco nodded, a surge of hope filling him. "I swear. I won't ever try to find out."
He simply couldn’t resist, and made his way to the centre of the gardens, getting drunk on the smell of the flowers, and wishing he could go down to the stables and take out his favourite horse. But the last time he’d managed to escape with his horse, the stablemaster himself had been whipped, so the likely chance of him managing that was slim to nil, he knew. Especially with everyone arriving for the party that evening. Too many people around to manage to slip past. Still, at least he was able to escape for a short time.
"When I saw the time for the gathering, I worried you might not make it," the other boy said.
Draco closed his eyes, nodding. So he’d have to last that long, at least. He didn’t want to, but until he could think of another way, at least he knew that was an opportunity. “All right. How…do I wash clothes?” Washing dishes seemed like it would be simple enough. Get them wet. But he had a feeling that washing clothes was a bit more complicated.
With Harry’s disappearance, Draco’s doubts had started up once more. Had Harry regretted it? Had Draco disappointed him somehow? Worse, had King Lucius found out and done something to Harry?
Then the man began to mumble in his sleep, and Draco listened with rapt attention.
Harry inched a little closer. “Malfoy,” he called quietly.
Draco looked up to meet his eyes, his own reflecting confusion. “No?”
Harry caught his eyes and smiled, this time with a hint of sorrow and regret. “For our farewell.”
“Back to Earth, Potter?” Malfoy asked, his tone almost playful.
from the box and examined it. “Sounds easy enough.”
But it seemed special enough for Maya. She ran her fingers through Draco’s locks, caressing it softly, before she let out another high-pitched squeal. She turned to Gita and started to ramble excitedly, making the woman laugh again.
Well, there was only one way to find out, wasn’t there?
But before they completely transformed to whoever they wanted to be for now, Draco had another thing to ask. One other thing he wanted to know before the future would stop to matter for them, at least for the time being.
He leaned forward to press another lingering kiss on his lips. This time a little less innocent and a lot more passionate.
As Harry’s laugh died down, Malfoy let out another long sigh. “Now that you seem out of danger of freezing to death, can we
So, Harry made it a personal quest to make Malfoy laugh. He had been trying to amuse the other with his jokes, but to no avail so far.
Harry kissed him unhurriedly, his hand reaching out for his wand to summon the lube they let fall somewhere around their bed last night. With the lube in his hand, Harry prepared himself, barely breaking the kiss, gasping a litany of his own name every time Draco grinded his hips up to create friction between their aligned crotches.
He turned around to find Potter emerging from a little crowd of what Draco assumed was the locals. It was almost amusing to see how well Potter blended in, with his dark hair and slightly tanned skin, completed by his sleeveless shirt and pair of shorts.
“I don’t know what’s so grown up about playing with a slap bracelet.” Harry grinned. “But, yeah, he isn’t so bad, right?”
“Wait, Lucius is an alpha?”
Draco’s lips twitched at the corner but his perfect composure remained. “Why, Harry, of course I had to,” he said. “And just so you know, it’s not brown. It’s very dark green, the colour of wet moss.” Draco couldn’t contain a small chuckle as he corrected him, dropping his posh mask.
Slowly, Draco walked down the cobblestone path leading to the Manor, every step he took felt like a big task as he dragged his heavy feet to move. It started to rain lightly when he opened the gate to his house, but Draco didn’t cast an Umbrella Charm or try to walk faster to avoid the drops of water falling from the sky. He couldn’t tell how much he took his time to reach the Manor until he grand porch in front of it and found he was soaking wet. Draco didn’t bother with a Drying Charm.
“Please, Malfoy, fuck me. Want you.
Malfoy started slow, teasing Harry’s lips with his own, but Harry didn’t have the patience for soft foreplay at the moment. He had waited long enough for that. Knowing exactly what he wanted, Harry cradled Malfoy’s head in his hands and deepened the kiss, all while pushing the man back towards his bedroom.
If anything, Malfoy became very quiet. So quiet it was unsettling.
“Potter.”
Harry, of course, ignored him in order to finish his solo sing off, adding some hand movements to pretend he was controlling the snow around them. “
“I think that’s all about the game,” Gita said. “We have an even number of players here with me as a referee. Should you two be the leader of each team?”
but the fact that Malfoy was right there with him, but they were both still fully clothed. Why wasn’t Malfoy fucking him yet? Harry was an omega in heat and Malfoy was an alpha. And Harry was pretty much presenting himself to Malfoy. Wouldn’t Malfoy want him as much as Harry wanted him right now? Harry couldn’t concentrate long enough to answer that, but he didn’t care. All he knew was that he needed to change that
On the other hand, Harry looked like he couldn’t be more comfortable standing in his half-naked glory, arms crossed and a smirk on his face. “No, at night you aren’t illuminated by sunset glow,” he said softly. “Golden light looks amazing on your skin.”
Clearly, Malfoy didn’t expect that. He whipped his head to face Harry with furrowed brows. “What?”
Tentatively, Draco sneaked his arm around Harry’s waist, holding him. “I always wondered what you said to your family back in Britain when you decided you left,” Draco said, not asking this time—he wasn’t sure Harry would answer. “And why.”
“I—where’s he?”
“Stop it,” Draco chuckled. “He will be so much more amazing on a broom than I ever was. Just look at his posture. He’s a natural.”
Harry didn’t realize he was still ogling at his partner until the pair of eyebrows he was indiscreetly staring at with an absent thought of
Draco took Harry’s other hand to put on his own chest.
something as serious as relationships.
In the early morning like this, when time almost magically slowed down, Draco could feel a sense of vulnerability tugging at his mind. He and Harry had been together for over fifteen years by now, officially married for twelve years of them, but sometimes everything still felt surreal. Watching the first ray of sunlight peeking from the gap between their curtains and landing on his husband’s golden skin, Draco wondered how he could be so lucky.
In other words, Draco Malfoy is the epitome of ‘go big or go home’. If it is not grand, most likely Draco wouldn't want anything to do it. He thrived in attention and he was getting very good at gaining it.
If Harry had to overhear one more student talk about Malfoy with creepy admiration as if the new professor was some kind of hot, misunderstood ex-villain… well, Harry hadn’t decided what he would do, but it wouldn’t be pretty.
Soon, everyone got into their position. The children sat on the front row of the half circle and the elderly sat behind them. In the middle of the clearing, the bonfire had been successfully ignited, the fire dancing merrily with the early evening wind. The young men, all as shirtless as Harry and Draco, sat in four layers of tight circles around the bonfire. Some of the women were still busy organizing the food everyone brought, but the others had joined the rest to sit in among the elderly and waited for the ritual to begin.
Astoria was completely unfazed. “What are you two trying to do here? My husband didn’t have any form of communication with Harry Potter for all the years he was away. He doesn’t have any involvement in the writing of Potter’s will. What are you expecting him to do, now that the will has been written?” she said calmly. “I believe he doesn’t even want any of the Potter’s belongings. I’d say you should let Draco retrieve all of them, as he was the only one with access, and give them to you, if you want them that badly.” She paused, squeezed Draco’s hand still warped in her, and added as in afterthought, “and then you can stop bothering my family.”
A green spark came out of the tip of her wand and Harry tensed a little next to him. Draco couldn’t blame him, the green spark was eerily similar to the most forbidden, cruel curse they knew. But soon it was obvious that, aside for the color, this spell couldn’t be anymore different from the Killing Curse. No malice could be sensed, no trace of a Dark Art. if anything, the magic that radiated from the spell felt like a cool, comforting breeze.
“It was a wonder it didn’t, honestly. How those Muggles manage to fly a giant metal tube for hours without magic is beyond me,” said Draco, recalling his first flight experience with a suppressed shudder. “It’s not supposed to work, logically.”
Harry felt Draco’s breath against his neck, soft and calming. “I used some intense persuasion to get my way.”
But a look at Engel’s face was enough to slap him awake. His air of absolute seriousness forced him to blink again, once, twice, until his words sunk into his brain. Harry Potter was dead. The news was so sudden, hitting his unsuspecting self without any preamble. Draco was struggling to wrap his mind around it.
“Can that be similar to the magic that allowed you to defeat the Dark Lord for the first time?” Draco asked suddenly.
