Harry’s hand suddenly feels uncomfortable and hot, as if a thousand needles are pricking into it. But… what was it that Madam Pomfrey said?
And they were. After Draco had gotten up three times that night. And the night after that. And the night after that. And- Well, you get the idea. But Draco was determined to make it work. He would rather suffer through this than not having Harry near him. But he also had to admit, it kind of stung that Harry didn’t seem to have the same problem. At all. Well, yes, in the morning, but that wasn’t necessarily because of Draco. It kept being the most confusing thing ever. And it took months for Draco to get enough sleep. His body still got excited, but it was almost like falling into a routine. And if Harry didn’t want to be more physical with him, Draco certainly wouldn’t push him.
That was a bit of a stupid reason, even Draco had to admit it, seeing as they were out and about in Muggle London, but Draco, unlike Potter, had class.
His heart clenches uncomfortably in his chest and Draco has no idea what to make of it. He doesn’t know what to do, either, when his hand moves without his permission and finds its way to Potter’s. He stares, mesmerised, at his own fingers, as he feels Potter’s skin beneath his fingertips. It’s almost… comforting. It’s as though he has to make sure Potter is really here and won’t suddenly disappear into thin air.
Draco bites back a retort and composes himself before he walks over to Potter with his wand raised. The chilly winter air makes him shiver but he doesn’t bother casting a warming charm.
Malfoy probably doesn’t know what happened just now. Or maybe he does. There have been enough articles in the Daily Prophet, questioning Harry’s sanity. Articles based on rumours, Harry reminds himself, Malfoy has helped spread. Given their current circumstances, that does feel like child’s play now. Still, it makes Harry tense up. But Malfoy keeps doing this, acting like he’s worried about Harry’s well-being. Maybe it is just that, an act.
“So, Potter,” Pansoyle crooned. “Let’s start with something simple. “Have you ever wanked, thinking about someone in this room?”
Blaise had remarked that it very much seemed like he and Potter were dating, but that was just ridiculous. They had just met for coffee a few times, had gone to the movies (Potter’s idea of course and Draco was still a bit traumatised) and had gone for a few walks, like now. Yes, Draco had been a little surprised earlier when Potter had asked him if he wanted to come back to his place later for dinner, but that wasn’t out of the ordinary, was it? Friends did that… right?
“You can’t run away forever, Potter,” Draco replied, squeezing his hand. “Besides, don’t you want to get to know your godson?”
As much as Draco wanted to stay mad at him, these words found their way right into Draco’s heart. Damn Harry Potter and his soppiness!
“Oh, well, I guess I do have a new purpose in life.” He laughs without humour. “Letting people project all their hopes and desires onto me.”
Potter bends down to kiss his collarbone, his chest and Draco can’t help but arch his back when he feels Potter’s tongue swipe over his nipple. It’s more sensitive than he would have thought and a delicious tingle runs down his spine as Potter sucks it into his mouth and starts grinding his hips against Draco’s.
He apologised to Granger and Weasley, but he knows he can do better and he’s determined to do so. Not only for Harry’s sake, but also his own.
Harry can’t bare to watch any more of this and takes them back to his study. Draco is silent for a long time, his gaze on the Pensieve and his right hand on his left forearm. It’s still there, the Dark Mark, but it’s not as shocking anymore. Instead of black, it turned to an angry red after Voldemort’s death. Now, it’s almost pinkish. Draco still squirms whenever Harry’s fingers come anywhere near it. He still hasn’t let him touch it properly. There’s no point, he keeps saying.
“I don’t believe a word you’re saying,” Harry says through gritted teeth. “I’ve never been nobody to you, I—”
Something inside Draco snaps, as though Potter just flipped a switch in Draco’s mind. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he barks. “Why would I be blushing?”
Draco has no idea what to say. He’s not sure if he’s getting ahead of himself, if he’s misinterpreting Potter’s words. But the way he’s looking at Draco… His expression is soft and warm. He’s never looked at Draco like that before.
“What?” Potter spluttered. “You want to—” He broke off when Draco purposefully rubbed his arse against his hard cock. “Merlin, Draco! You can’t ride me when this is your first time bottoming.”
Still, Draco cringes a little when Potter whimpers again. It sounds like he’s having a nightmare. Draco has some experience in that particular field. He wonders if Potter ever dreams of the Dark Lord as well. Is he dreaming of him right now? Even if he is, it can’t be as bad as Draco’s dreams. Not after what he saw the Dark Lord do to all those people. Wizards and Muggles alike. He tortured a witch because she hadn’t wanted to pledge her eternal allegiance to him by killing her father, a Muggle.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Potter grinned and playfully nudged his shoulders. “You know, I’ve never seen you laugh like this. Even when I was a koala.”
He paused when he heard something rustling on the other side of the room. It took him a moment to realise it was Potter. He was finally awake. Draco slowly walked over to him, suddenly feeling like he would vanish, like it had all just been a dream.
“YOU ARSEHOLE!” Draco screams, slamming into Harry. He’s on the verge of tears again as he repeatedly whacks Harry’s chest with his fists.
He drew his lower lip between his teeth when Potter shifted closer. For a breathtaking moment, he thought he was going to kiss him. Instead, Potter ran his fingers through Draco’s hair and gave him a piercing look.
Harry closes his eyes and takes several deep breaths. He wills his pulse to slow down and tries to shove Malfoy and his beautiful body out of his mind. He peeks down at his hands and sighs in relief when he finds he isn’t invisible anymore. Good. He straightens himself, avoiding the stage and letting his eyes roam the rest of the room instead. Everybody seems to be mesmerised by whatever Malfoy’s doing. Did he… take off his boxer briefs? Is he—No! Harry can’t risk it. He can’t look. He can’t—Damn it!
Something warm unfurls in his chest when Malfoy rubs at his eyes before he drapes his arm around Harry again. If he knew how tousled his hair is, he’d probably throw a fit. Harry thinks it’s almost endearing. Especially paired with that thing Malfoy is wearing.
Draco almost dropped his cup. It seemed he had just lost control over his bodily functions. His eyes started watering as he stared at Potter without blinking, because he couldn’t move a single muscle. He noticed how the now slightly blurry, black haired figure in front of him started fidgeting again. Draco would have savoured it, if he wasn’t feeling so utterly ruffled.
“Your—Your cock is—Fuck, yes!” Potter bangs his right hand against the mattress. “Your cock is rubbing against my—my—Nnnngh!”
“I think she can,” Harry murmurs. He offers her the little note and watches as she carefully sniffs at it. “Yes. Can you take it to him? Please?”
“We should end this evening on a happy note,” Draco remarks and starts rummaging through the drawer. “I’m thinking… your 21st birthday.”
Draco prays his father doesn’t recognise the quivering in his voice as he tries to be as vague as possible in his lie. Of course he’s sure. How could he not be? His gaze lingers on Potter’s eyes, his heart clenching painfully. He immediately wonders if Potter has seen his memories yet, if he knows everything.
“Come on, grab your wand. We’ll have the place back to normal in no time,” Draco said, nudging Harry with his elbow.
Draco tries to move away from him. A hopeless endeavour of course. He hears Potter smack his lips and is tempted to kick him in the shin. If only he could.
“Do you remember the third task of the Triwizard Tournament in fourth year?” he asked, watching as Potter’s face turned from anxious to confused.
Holding a Niffler in his arms while leaning against his shower, trying not to listen to Malfoy scrubbing his skin, really isn’t how Harry wants to be spending his morning. He couldn’t even really enjoy his own shower, constantly glancing over his shoulder to check if Malfoy was breaking his promise and sneaking a peek at him. He didn’t. So Harry makes good on his promise and keeps his back to the shower, carefully petting the Niffler.
“Then why- What are you doing? I can’t even tell if that was accidental or not? If you regret it or not? What is this- What are we-”
Draco puts the bottle on the table beside him and ignores Potter as he sits down in the other armchair with a plate in his lap.
“Don’t decide right now,” he says, forcing his voice to sound even. “Think about it. Think about it and… let me know.”
“He’s not your boyfriend anymore, Weasley,” Malfoy drawls. “I don’t see that it’s any of your business who—”
He glances at the clock and sees it’s 3:49. His eyes find Harry’s and they hold so much love, it makes Draco shudder. He takes Harry’s hands in his and pulls him closer. When his lips brush Harry’s, a familiar feeling washes over him. It’s warm and invigorating, reassuring and exhilarating. Kissing Harry will never fail to consume and mesmerize Draco.
“That doesn’t make you loyal to Voldemort,” Harry says determinedly. “It means you and I have very different beliefs and I won’t pretend I’m not repulsed by the idea that you would think of someone as filthy, just because they happen to have Muggle parents. It makes me want to punch you that you condone torturing—”
“Even if that were true, do you really want to live your life according to other people’s expectations?”
Harry’s eyes widened as Malfoy clapped both of his hands over his mouth. He looked as shocked as Harry felt. They stared at each other in silence for a few seconds, before Harry finally croaked, “What?”
Potter starts coughing and repeatedly hits his chest. Merlin, he could at least wait until Draco is finished.
Draco cocked his head and studied Potter’s face. How come he was so confident when it came to his animagus form, but so insecure about his true self?
“Okay.” Potter nods, but he sounds surprised. Draco practically feels his gaze bore into him, as though Potter is driving a dagger into his chest. The following silence feels meaningful somehow. Potter breaks the moment first by striding over to the door.
“The articles inside are even worse,” Luna said. “I kept them, in case we needed them to prove the invasion of Harry’s privacy. Luckily, Hermione got them all to stop selling them after a few days, although none of us have any idea how she did it. But I guess it was too late. Those articles really got to him. Harry didn’t admit it, of course, but that’s when he stopped eating when anybody was around.”
Before Potter knows what’s happening, Draco lunges at him. His fist connects with his jaw and Potter stumbles backward. He blinks a few times, obviously flabbergasted and blinks at Draco stupidly. After a moment, he frowns.
“Obviously, I’m far more delightful than you,” she retorted. Her expression turned more thoughtful as she tapped her fingers against her thighs. “Look, it’s been two months.”
“There’s something else,” Draco blurts and Potter’s head whips around to him. His gaze is almost pleading. Draco tries to ignore it. “We have to tell him, Potter.” He turns to the portrait. “Did Professor McGonagall tell you about the voice I’ve been hearing?”
“You know,” he began, stroking Draco’s back and leaning forward to kiss his cheek. “I actually had an idea.”
He blinks, some part of his brain registering that he shouldn’t be here, that he should run. He can’t move his feet. Something’s wrapped around his ankles. His mouth opens in a silent scream when he feels something cold and rough on his neck, around his chest, around his waist.
He knows from experience that things can get interesting when Potter drinks. Potter was actually pretty hammered when he told Draco he doesn‘t only like girls, he‘s also into blokes. Draco remembers it as if it were yesterday. He nearly had a heart attack right in the middle of the club. Potter didn’t remember the next day, but he told Draco again, dead sober, two months later.
Draco purses his lips. He’s onto something. Weasley isn’t just angry. He’s tense, as though he just realised he said too much.
Overcome with dizziness, he relaxes his shoulders and tries to catch his breath. He stops breathing completely when Potter slightly pulls back and his nose brushes against Draco’s. He stays there, his eyes locked with Draco’s, as though he’s too mesmerised to move. At least that’s how Draco feels. His right index finger twitches and in the back of his mind, he wonders why whatever he’s touching feels so unfamiliar. Oh. Because it’s Potter’s beard. Draco’s hand is on Potter’s cheek.
“Even if I wanted to,” he makes another face, “I’ve got to go to Transfiguration.” He pauses and gives Harry a funny look. “Are you sure you don’t want to come back to class?”
Well, that was easier said than done. Harry kept moving, ever so slightly, and basically rubbed himself against Draco. Oh God, this was not good! Harry was basically feeding the beast. But without giving it what it wanted.
“He was screaming like a mad man after he was brought in here,” Madam Pomfrey says with a sniff. “I thought we would have to restrain him, with the way he thrashed around. Didn’t listen to a word I said.” She pauses. “I don’t think he could hear me.”
“I’m really glad you kept this,” he says, squeezing Draco’s hand. Confusion washes over Draco until he realises Harry’s talking about the coin, trapped between their palms. He feels heat blooming on his cheeks, even more so when Harry smiles at him.
“Actually, I have,” Potter said. “I was part of the Auror team that, err, made sure this place was, err, save to live in. You know, after your trial.”
Hoping it’s not too late, Harry races through the castle while grey eyes, scrutinising him coldly, still linger in the back of his mind.
“Harry.” Hermione’s tone tells him the answer to that should be obvious. “You talk about him almost as much as you did in school. Ron noticed, too, you know.”
Draco let his head fall back and made a strangled noise, while Blaise and Pansy keeled over with laughter.
Deliberating only for a moment, Draco strides over to her. He forces his face to stay impassive, even though he wants to scream from how sore he feels. He notices the girl’s tense shoulders and her shaking fingers. He sits down opposite her, flinging his robes over the bench in a flourish and regretting it immediately when his aching skin starts to burn even more. He folds his arms on the table wordlessly, noting how the girl flinches and how she seems to be getting more nervous as she keeps her eyes on her book.
As soon as the words are out, Harry freezes. He watches Malfoy, who has gone suspiciously still, his hand hovering over the cauldron.
Draco mentally berates himself. He was so angry at Potter; he thought Potter didn’t care. Instead, Potter hadn’t been able to care.
Gripped by a sudden frenzy, he tore through the crowd, craning his neck. Several people were swearing and shouting at him but Harry didn’t care. He pushed his way through them, his thoughts only on…
“And while we’re at it,” Draco said, kneeling down beside Harry, “we have a surprise for you as well.”
Draco suppressed the choking noise he had been about to make, pressing his lips into a tight line. Had Potter always been this blunt?
“Malfoy,” Potter says, his tone exasperated. Draco doesn’t care. “Malfoy.” Draco grits his teeth. “Malfoy!” Potter can say his name as much as he wants, Draco won’t— “What the bloody hell is your problem?” he hears Potter bellow behind him. Draco stays silent. “What did I do to deserve this—”
“I’m sorry, Harry. I’m afraid we will need to have a deeper look into the matter. All the teachers are trying their best.”
Draco closed his eyes, his heart hammering so violently in his chest, he thought it was going to burst. “Because— Because I’m already in love with someone else.”
Pulse quickening, Draco gets up. Why is he still here? Why did he let Potter go down there on his own?
For a second, Harry feels like he’s dreaming himself. It’s the kind of revelation he has no idea how to process. It puts a new complexion on… everything. Draco wanting him to stay, the way he clung to Harry that night… everything that happened afterwards.
Raising his chin, he wrenches open the door and marches outside, his chest feeling empty yet again. No wonder, a little voice whispers inside his head. He left his heart with Potter and he doesn’t know if he’ll ever be able to get it back.
Draco’s eyes snap back to his. There’s much more sympathy there than Draco is comfortable with. But there’s also a hint of hesitation.
“Oh Merlin, yes please,” Harry bursts out enthusiastically. “That would be great! Ron should come, too! And Hermione and—” Harry stops dead.
Harry feels his cheeks heat up and he balls his hands into fists. As much as he wants to get out of this room and help Dumbledore hunt down the horcruxes, it feels like he’ll be leaving a part of himself behind when he drinks this. Facing reality seems much harsher all of a sudden. But what’s the alternative? Stay like this forever? No, he needs all his senses to defeat Voldemort.
“And after I’m done sucking your cock,” Malfoy inhales sharply, as though the mere thought of sucking Harry could make him come, “I’m going to grab you and pull you down and you’re going to sit on my face and I—”
Harry immediately wants to deny it; he doesn’t want to, not in a million years, but his mind unhelpfully starts murmuring at him, asking him if he ever uttered a more blatant lie.
Draco laughs so loudly, it echoes off the walls. “Please, as if you wouldn’t have forced more Veritaserum down my throat if you had gotten the chance.”
“I mean it. Thank you.” He looked deeply into Draco’s eyes and in that moment, it felt like the world around them disappeared, leaving just the two of them staring at each other.
“Malfoy.” Harry leans forward, until their foreheads are touching. “You’re not forcing yourself on me.”
Harry strains his ears for any sign of movement, unconsciously holding his breath. It was a stupid thing to ask. Of course Malfoy doesn’t want to stay and console him. Why would he? He—
“Do you… maybe… want to take your clothes off, too?” Harry doesn’t even get a chance to feel embarrassed about how stupidly he phrased that question; the most traitorous part of his body twitches at the prospect Malfoy might agree.
After lunch, Draco tried to busy himself in his lab, which was a lot harder to do with Potter watching his every move.
“In the light of this new information, about the Whomping Willow, I found that my suspicions have been accurate.”
“Showoff,” Draco muttered, eliciting another laugh from Potter. Draco doubted he would ever tire of that sound.
“Merlin, yes,” he gasped as Potter sucked his earlobe into his mouth and his hands wandered down to Draco’s backside. He probably should have put a stop to this, told Potter to leave before the situation escalated completely. But it just felt
“Oh,” Harry said, wondering why he suddenly felt a tinge of disappointment. Then again, Malfoy was kind of a wanker, too, wasn’t he? At least in Harry’s opinion. Maybe he wasn’t asking the right questions. But what was he supposed to ask?
Potter rubs two fingers against his temple and looks down at the floor. “He should have told me. I—” His voice breaks. “I hurt him. Physically. He admitted it. I was fucking him and he was probably suffering the whole time.”
“Headmistress,” Draco nodded in greeting. He took in Potter’s tense shoulders, the way he was wringing his hands.
“Malfoy,” Potter says quietly, uncertainty clear in his voice. He hasn’t moved his arms and Draco wants to slap them away, because the warmth that’s seeping through his robes is too bittersweet for him to bear. It’s not Potter’s intention to comfort him with this proximity.
Draco holds his gaze, his lips stretching into a smile. “You know, I think I like having so much power over you.”
Potter grins with a challenging look in his eyes. “What does that say about me, then?” he practically purrs. “Since you’re sitting here with me?”
“Hogwarts, Headmistress McGonagall’s office!” Surprise and apprehension flashed across Potter’s face before he vanished. Draco lost no time, stepping into the fireplace himself immediately, to follow Potter.
Draco blinks. What the hell is going on with Potter this morning? He shudders when Potter lets out a sigh and smiles against his mouth.
“It seems to me, an awfully big part of your life involves pleasing others.” And boy did Draco know what that was like. Even now, with his father in Azkaban, he often caught himself wondering if he would approve of Draco’s actions. It always took a lot to remind himself he wasn’t supposed to care about that anymore.
“What is it?” Draco asks. He takes the coin from Harry’s palm, eyeing it sceptically. “You’re giving me money? Is this some kind of a joke?”
“I—I don’t—” Potter slowly shakes his head. Draco can see the panic on his face. “I can’t—No. I don’t—I—”
“Okay, time for the next class, Celia, darling,” Draco said hastily, his cheeks flaming, and hoisted the little girl up in his arms. She shrieked excitedly and threw her arms around his neck.
“You know,” he says with a little smirk, “I think I’m rather good at shutting him up.” He winks at Zabini, before gripping onto Malfoy more tightly and giving him the snog of his life.
“You don’t even know for sure?” Draco yells. “Potter, no.” He turns to him with pleading eyes. “Don’t do this.”
“Ow! Hermione! You’re squishing me! Wha— What is—?” Suddenly, Ron sounds panicky. “Why can’t I hear— CAN YOU HEAR ME, HERMIONE?”
“Listen,” he barks, grabbing his shirt and his trousers and holding them in front of him before he turns around to face Malfoy. “I don’t think a simple kiss would have broken the bond. It has to mean something.”
“Sure, just a little,” Harry laughed, putting the porridge aside and gently pulled Draco into his arms.
Draco captures Potter’s lips once more with his own, giving in to the urge to let every inch of himself be devoured by Potter. The sweetness of the kiss is almost unbearable.
They walk in silence for a while and Harry tries to savour every little detail. Birds chirping, the soft breeze caressing his face, the laughter from other students somewhere far off.
“Nothing,” Potter suddenly says. “I feel absolutely nothing.” He opens his eyes and gives Draco an expectant look. “Do you hear anything?”
McGonagall’s face was unreadable. She studied Potter for a long moment, her eyes flickering to Draco every now and then.
“Well, um. That was… something,” Harry murmurs. He peeks at Malfoy from under his lashes, too nervous to look at him directly. He’s probably mad at him. He’ll probably yell, throw a fit. Maybe he’ll even try to hit Harry. Or—
“Not really,” Potter murmurs. “It’s… No, it feels different. This anger… it feels familiar. I just—I don’t know how to explain it.”
“Can we please not dwell on this? This is embarrassing enough,” Potter said, pressing his body against Draco’s. “So, you still haven’t answered my question. Would you kiss me again?”
Unable to hold himself up any longer, he sank to his knees. He was so stupid. Of course Potter didn’t want him. Nobody wanted him. Still, he had thought Potter was different. He had thought Potter might… might…
They jump apart, Draco’s heart slamming against his chest. Madam Pomfrey rushes over and studies him, her fingers cool against his face. And yet, Draco feels his cheeks heating up; Potter is holding his hand, even though Madam Pomfrey can see.
Silence, Harry learns, has become his greatest enemy. Closely followed by patience. He’s made his peace with disappointment; and yet, he’s surprised, and his heart sinks, when he hears the curtain being moved again, followed by footsteps. He should have seen it coming, really. He’s being naive, and he knows it.
Yesterday was Harry’s turn and after talking about his godson and Quidditch and classes, he also recounted one of his nightmares. He never talks about them with anyone. He doesn’t want to hear what they mean or that maybe he should see a mind healer. He knows perfectly well what they mean. So, simply talking about it, having the opportunity to get it out in the open and out of his system… it’s freeing. Harry also never appreciated before, how much it means when somebody listens, really just listens to him. It is a whole new experience.
As relieved as he is that he and Malfoy are kind of getting along now, this keeps happening. They sit down on the sofa every night and when they finally go to bed, Harry has no idea what they’ve been watching. His hopes that he isn’t being too obvious are shattered when Malfoy eyes him one night and raises an eyebrow.
feel guilty, okay?” Harry blurts. “I—I think I could have helped you,” he adds quietly. “The moment I realised you were being extorted I should have—”
Weasley turns on his heels and marches off, leaving Draco standing there like an idiot. When he passes him again, this time with Potter in tow, he doesn’t even deign to look at Draco.
“Well, you were when you were in my shower.” Draco threw his hands in the air. “And then you collapsed. What was I supposed to do?”
Draco shifted in his seat. This conversation felt too meaningful for Potter to have it with him of all people. But, even though he didn’t like it, he had to admit, he did get what Potter was talking about.
Harry parts his lips and lets his tongue dart out to lick over the tip. Malfoy tastes exactly like he remembers. Slowly, he lowers his head, pulling Malfoy’s cock into his mouth, instinctively hollowing his cheeks. As he starts bobbing his head, he realises it’s very different without all the water pouring down on them. It’s not bad, because now he can smell Malfoy. It’s intoxicating and Harry finds himself aroused by it.
“Pfft, how foolish,” Draco snorted. He took a sip of tea, not taking his eyes off the picture. He spotted Weasley in the background, clad in his ridiculous Auror robes. Automatically, Draco’s eyes scanned the picture for the person completing the formerly infamous Golden Trio, even though he knew it was pointless. Nobody had heard anything from Potter in years. He had vanished after the Battle of Hogwarts, and while there was still a special unit searching for him, many believed him to be dead. As for Draco, he didn’t know what to believe.
“Oh, fuck! Oh, Draco!” She cradled his head with one hand, while the other started stroking his hair. “How did she react?”
Harry gulps. “Yeah, that, um—that sounds—Okay, um, yeah. So me sitting on your face. Yeah, that’s—Nnnngh!”
Draco wants to ask him if he’s out of his mind, if he hit his head or if this is some kind of weird sleepwalking. He doesn’t ask any of it. He’s completely tongue-tied.
“You were never good with words,” Malfoy smirks before he tilts his head and presses his warm lips against Harry’s.
“Oh.” Draco hadn’t even thought of that. Even though it was pretty clear what Potter was asking for. He didn’t just want to sleep in Draco’s bed. He wanted to cuddle. Probably. “Well…” Draco didn’t know how to finish that sentence. Somehow, the thought of Potter turning back into a koala, not knowing if he could ever turn into a human again, was much worse than the thought of Potter being wrapped around him. “Just… get in here and we’ll figure it out.”
His mind unhelpfully provides him with the image of Potter staring at him. His eyes are hooded and gleaming.
Yes, that’s an excellent question. Feeling more confident after this realisation, Harry takes a deep breath and says,
“Oh fuck,” Draco chokes. The sensation of Potter’s tongue inside of him, paired with Potter’s fingers digging into his thighs is almost enough to make him come. “Fuck, Potter! Do it now. Please, I want—I want—” Draco buries his face into Potter’s groin.
Potter’s grin widens as a plate comes floating out of a cupboard and the pancakes neatly place themselves on it. “Syrup?” he asks, without taking his eyes off Draco.
“Call it a hunch,” Malfoy says, raising his chin. “I couldn’t care less. What I do care about is for you to stop focussing all your energy from being lovelorn on people who want nothing to do with you.”
Much too late, Harry registers what he just said, his eyes widening in shock. Draco seems to share the sentiment. He runs a hand through his hair, grinding his teeth.
“What is your bloody problem?” Harry splutters and tries to catch his breath. He struggles against the arms, pinning him to the wall. “Where the fuck were you? I woke up and you were gone!” He tries to kick Malfoy, but the git dodges his foot. “This is what I get for being worried about you?” he fumes. “You’re an arse, Malfoy!”
Malfoy gives a little huff and crosses his arms in front of his chest. Instead of answering, he stares at the wall behind Harry.
The urge to pull away is almost unbearable, but Harry forces himself to let his hand lie still, while he prays Malfoy can’t hear his erratic, thundering heartbeat. If he withdraws his hand now, it might shatter this… thing that might almost come close to something resembling a… well, not friendship. Maybe… an amicable acquaintance? Whatever it is, he doesn’t want to ruin it. Actually, he doesn’t know what he wants at all.
“‘S no trouble, Master Draco,” Kreacher says, but suddenly, his eyes widen in horror. “Kreacher is sorry, Master Draco. Kreacher did not mean to interrupt Master Draco.” He flings himself to the floor and starts banging his head against it.
“Wait,” Draco blurted. Potter blinked and gave him an expectant look. “I, um… I was just wondering… Is this the only way to stretch someone?”
Malfoy shrugs once more. “And today we’re going to figure out how to make this,” he gestures between them, “go away.”
“— and… Hey, where did Baxter go?” She craned her neck and narrowed her eyes as she pushed aside some of the leaves. “That’s strange.”
Draco gasps. For a moment, he thinks Potter is losing consciousness. No. He finally stopped fighting back.
“Potter?” he whispered, his voice cracking. He felt his heart hammering against his chest as the curtain of black hair slowly moved. Tired eyes blinked at him, eyes he would have recognised anywhere. “Holy fuck,” he said, breathlessly. “It is you.”
Granted, pushing away his friends might not be the smartest idea. But he’s not pushing them away per se. He just needs some time to think, some time to figure things out. He’s not sure if he ever will, but this is the best he can do at the moment. And yet… it’s hard to forget the disappointment on Ron’s face when Harry told him he wasn’t going to join the Auror training with him. It felt like he was letting him down. Then again, it feels like he’s letting everyone down lately.
“What’s wrong with daffodils?” Harry murmurs to himself. Malfoy acted as though Harry personally insulted him. He’s the one who insulted Harry. But it was different. There was no teasing, no gleeful undertone. It was bitter and relentless. Well, Malfoy lost pretty much everything he used to be so proud of; his father, his reputation, his precious status in the Wizarding community. He still has his mother, but god knows what she’s planning to do to get all those things back. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if she was more focussed on that than her son.
Harry tenses. For the first time he realises he’s awake, listening to a real conversation. A conversation that took a turn Harry didn’t expect at all. It’s Snape?
Before he can wonder what will happen next, Malfoy moves and the warmth of his body suddenly disappears. Confused, Harry fumbles around the bed, but all his hands are grasping is his sheets. Malfoy is gone. Harry waits for a while, thinking he might come back, but he doesn’t.
“Look, they’re dancing with us,” Potter says, his eyes fixed on the fairies, while Draco is unable to pull his gaze away from Potter’s face.
Honestly, Draco didn’t know what he had expected after that, but watching Potter grab his suit jacket and storm out of his room hurt almost as much as being crucioed by the Dark Lord.
Potter doesn’t feel the way Draco feels. That’s what he’s trying to say, right? Not that Draco really knows how he feels. This is utterly baffling. And he doesn’t even want to think about the possibility that Potter might suspect in which direction Draco’s feelings may be headed. He’s doing a fairly good job at hiding them, isn’t he? It’s not even like he wants to have these feelings. They’re absolutely unwelcome. He’ll just have to get rid of them.
Exhaling loudly, he leaned back in his chair and buried his hands in his hair. “I have no idea what to think anymore. There were times I thought he really might like me. We talked about so many things, he trusted me with so many secrets,” he let out a pained laugh at the memories. “I should have known it was all too good to be true. Honestly, the night he made dinner I should have—”
Harry gulps, his scalp prickling uncomfortably. It’s just a coincidence. Surely, it’s a coincidence. But… when has Malfoy ever had to do his homework right before class? Oh god. But it was just a dream.
“Oh god,” Harry mutters, his stomach roaring in protest. “This can’t be happening.” It just can’t. He can’t feel what he’s feeling. For
“I—I wanted to show you that,” he swallows, “I’m the one for you.” It sounds so incredibly stupid when he says it out loud.
Composing himself in that moment feels like the hardest thing he ever had to do. He schools his features, forces himself to raise his chin before he slowly turns around. It hurts, looking at Potter. It hurts so damn much.
He swallows. It’s his own fault, once again, for blurting out something that he should have taken to his grave.
“So…” Draco brushed the duvet with his fingertips, searching for the right words. “Luna showed me… the magazines.”
“He’s a great flatmate. It’s always clean, I never have to worry about the fridge being empty, he always makes sure I have my favourite tea… One time, he yelled at a salesperson because they didn’t have it in stock.” Harry chuckled to himself while Draco slid down in his seat, looking slightly embarrassed. “I thought it was rather sweet. I mean, sure he has a few quirks. He always insists I use the blanket he got for me when I’m on the sofa, although we have, like, five. But I don’t mind. It’s a nice blanket. It has little Snitches on it. Sometimes he massages my shoulders, but he never lets me reciprocate. I keep telling him I’m not as clumsy as I was at school but I guess he doesn’t believe me.”
“Yeah, well.” Draco looks down at his hands, not wanting Potter to see anything he shouldn’t in his eyes.
He buries his face in the crook of Malfoy’s neck as the Slytherin’s movements become more frantic and he pants down Harry’s neck. Harry lets his fingers wander upwards, until they slip beneath Malfoy’s pyjamas and clutches at his back. Malfoy presses his cheek against his and Harry shivers as the hot breath tickles his ear. He wishes he could hear Malfoy moan, hear his voice as he loses control. Instead, Harry is the one moaning as Malfoy pushes his cock against Harry’s with frantic urgency.
“Right.” Potter licked his lips and absentmindedly scratched his beard. Fuck! Was he trying to drive Draco mad?
“You’re a fucking liar,” he growled and wound his hands into Draco’s hair. It wasn’t as rough as Draco had expected. “You’re a liar,” Potter repeated and slowly tilted Draco’s head to the side.
“Wait, you haven’t told me the incantation yet,” Harry says while frantically hopping. “Malfoy?” Harry keeps hopping, wondering what the fuck Malfoy is doing. “Malfoy, what’s the—” He freezes. “Hold on, didn’t you say the spell was irreversible?”
Well, Potter’s life has been anything but quiet to this point, hasn’t it? Thanks to the Dark Lord. But it was Potter’s decision to go straight into Auror training after he was dead; he could have taken some time off or gone back to Hogwarts for his final year. Instead, he decided to throw himself into work and hasn’t taken a day off since.
A murmur goes through the classroom and Harry notices several of his classmates are huddled together with their hands raised to their mouths. They can talk all they want. He’s more than used to it. It was probably foolish of him to think this year would be any different.
“Oh. I see. You’d rather have some faceless, brainless twat you can fuck as you please without having to think about anything else. That’s what you’d like me to be, right?”
Harry tries to fight down the heat on his cheeks, knowing every single one of his friends, and probably half of the Great Hall, is staring at him. “Don’t make a big deal out of this, Malfoy.”
Draco wonders how Potter hasn’t suffocated himself yet; the spoonful of porridge is dangling from his mouth while his eyes are fixed on the letter he just tore open.
Malfoy tilts his head and gives him the most unconvincing innocent smile Harry has ever seen. The git knows Harry will come on the spot if he keeps talking.
“What’s going on here?” McGonagall’s stern voice booms through the corridor. “Whose Dung Bomb was that?”
“Are you sure it wasn’t your fault?” Ginny asks. “I have no idea what happened, but the chances of you—”
“The most important thing, Harry,” Dumbledore says, “is not to fight the pain. You will want to, but you have to embrace it. You have to embrace every emotion you will feel while your soul tries to mend itself.”
“This is exactly why this won’t work,” Draco sighs. “You think I’m doing this for you, but I’m not some selfless hero who saves the day.”
Harry turns in his bed, slowly coming to his senses. The silence in the hospital wing is only disrupted by Ron’s snoring. Harry is already so used to it, he has no trouble falling asleep to the sound of it. He wonders how Malfoy is dealing with it.
Malfoy shifts beside him and Harry readies himself for a punch or for Malfoy to storm off. Either will hurt. But nothing happens. Malfoy just sits there and Harry wonders if he should just shove him out of his bed and be done with it. But neither of them do anything and Harry starts questioning his resolution. He wants to stay strong and not let Malfoy know how much he’s hurting him, but he already feels the words tumbling out of his mouth.
A weird sensation, something almost resembling fear, washes over him and against his better judgement, Draco finds himself rushing forward and sinking down to his knees. He grabs Potter’s shoulders and starts shaking his limp body.
“Yes, yes,” he groans, his fingers digging into the Slytherin’s skin, desperate for more friction. Harry barely registers Malfoy moving his head, but when he suddenly feels the other boy’s lips lightly brushing his collarbone, he almost screams.
It’s funny, isn’t it, how you can go through life, manage to let each day pass and come to terms with the fact that no one will ever feel a certain way about you, accept that your deepest desire is out of reach, not yours to have. So what do you do when that suddenly changes?
Darco shook his head and sighed. “No idea.” He studied Potter from under his lashes, taking in his gaunt figure. Something was seriously wrong with him. “You know, I think it might be best if you talked to a professional.”
Harry shifts in his seat, trying to ignore the noises Malfoy is making while he licks the last bits of chocolate mousse off his spoon.
“Well, your great—” Draco broke off when his mother cleared her throat. Very loudly. “Your auntie organised for us to visit… err…”
“Well, okay, maybe I’ll let you grab my arse once, only once, after you drink this.” He nods at the vial in Harry’s hand.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco says in a condescending tone. Harry rakes his fingers through his hair.
Potter moves and Draco fights the urge to cling on to him, to keep him in place. He doesn’t want this moment to end, afraid of facing reality again. When Potter slowly starts undressing, Draco is suddenly very certain he’s actually dreaming. Of course he is. That makes so much more sense. He watches Potter push down his bottoms, with his mouth hanging open.
“Yes, you might have already mentioned that once or twice,” Ron said, trying to sound exasperated, but he couldn’t hide the amusement in his voice. “Wow, you really got it bad for him, don’t you, mate?”
Potter pauses, but he doesn’t turn around. Draco’s lips stretch into a triumphant smirk, which quickly falters when he thinks he hears Potter mutter,
He hadn’t dared to fall asleep that night. Seeing as Harry had finally calmed down with Draco in his arms, Draco had supposed it would be better to stay there until dawn. With Harry being restless in the bed beside him, he wouldn’t have gotten much sleep anyway.
“When I realised it wasn’t just a dream, I was so relieved I hadn’t said it back,” Malfoy murmurs. “I would have been too embarrassed.”
“Oh,” Potter said after a few moments. He withdrew his hand from Draco’s cheek and stepped back. “I—I guess you don’t—”
Harry is only trying to cheer him up. And although Draco would never admit it out loud, getting flowers from his boyfriend is… kind of nice.
Draco does, clamping his mouth shut. His gaze is fixed on the ceiling again. He feels Potter settle himself between his legs.
The only time Harry isn’t staring at the map, is when his eyes are fixed on the actual Malfoy, walking past him. Hermione jumps at the chance and grabs the map. She’s not planning on hiding it or anything. She knows all too well she would never get away with it. Harry would probably even threaten to hex her if she didn’t give it back. She instead doodles something on it and grins, when the little heart she made around Malfoy’s dot sticks and moves along with it.
“Oh.” Harry lets out a quiet sigh of relief. “Um, can I be completely honest? Without you getting mad?”
“Oh fuck,” Potter spluttered as Draco almost cried out. Potter had moved his hand down to Draco’s crotch, palming his cock through his trousers. “You’re already hard.”
Harry stares at her, his mind going completely blank. He waits for Hermione to explain her reasoning, but all she does is sit down next to him.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Malfoy muttered. But Harry had the impression his cheeks were getting pinker by the second. “Besides, Romeo didn’t serenade Juliet.”
“Good, as long as we’re clear on that,” he said, grabbing more raspberries. “I would never touch you intentionally.” Even though Draco had always taken great pride in being an excellent liar, he wasn’t sure if his face was betraying him just then. Judging from Potter’s look, at least, something wasn’t right.
His heart skips a beat and the nape of his neck starts to prickle when he hears someone at the front door. His lips inadvertently curl into a smile and he jumps out of his seat. He darts into the living room, ready to drag Malfoy into the kitchen. But when he sees Malfoy isn’t alone, his stomach drops and his entire body freezes up.
Potter bursts out laughing. He closes the gap between them once more and moves his lips tenderly against Draco’s.
“He’s a changed man. You wouldn’t recognise him.” His heart squeezes painfully at his own horrible twist of the truth.
“Hold on, is that why you wouldn’t come out of your room for a week, after I told you about that date I had with a Muggle a few months ago?”
Sirius’ lips curve into a sad smile. “It isn’t. But I know you’re going to do the right thing. You can’t keep living like this, Harry. I know you don’t want to feel more pain, but it’s
Potter jerks, his hands immediately fumbling around on the mattress. He blinks at Draco like a bloody barn owl.
Dumbledore studies him. “Is it by chance similar to what you felt when Lord Voldemort took possession of your mind?”
Draco hesitates, taking in the sight of Potter, lying helplessly on the floor. He almost looks… dead.
As if the news of Malfoy being gay wasn’t enough, the next few days turn out to be one hell of a rolllercoaster. Because, apparently, there isn’t only Brian. There’s also Jack. And Noah. And Henry. And Alfie. And Merlin knows how many more. Every day there’s another bloke in Malfoy’s room. Except on the weekend. Apparently, even Draco Malfoy needs a little breather. That’s why Harry finds him in the kitchen on Sunday, nibbling on some toast.
He follows Potter’s gaze, up to the blackened sky and the twinkling stars. It’s a beautiful night. It would be a shame to let it go to waste.
Draco finds himself unable to move, not even able to shy away from Potter’s hand that gently cups his cheek.
Draco can only stare at him. Did Potter just make him believe all his dreams came true, only to crush them in under a minute?
As he reached for the doorknob, his eyes fell to the koala once more. It had stretched out its little arms. Was it… asking to be picked up? To be cuddled?
“I want to look at you,” Harry whispers, unthinkingly. Draco freezes and Harry mentally slaps himself.
“What?” Draco asked, taken aback. Potter seemed to consider something, but didn’t answer before lowering his head to kiss Draco’s neck again. “Oh!”
“You being as blind as a bat is enough of a joke,” Draco snorted. He turned his head sideways, fixing his gaze on the family portrait on the wall and tried to ignore the heat on his cheeks.
“Oh, a snowman,” Celia shrieked in delight. She clapped and giggled as the snowman started dancing around them. It was good to see her enjoy herself like that.
“I can tell from this report when you started getting bored with it. What was it, after…” He purses his lips. “... seven minutes?”
Draco needs a moment to realise he’s half sitting in Potter’s lap, his body still somewhat encircled by Potter’s arms. It’s too much. Draco can’t take this. The hot tears he spilled earlier are nothing compared to what’s happening right now. He’s choking on his own sobs, every inhale torture to his lungs.
“You have no idea what I was—Hey! Give that back!” Harry can feel the surge of sweat on his forehead as he watches Malfoy examine the book from the Restricted Section.
Malfoy laughs and puts his hands on the back of Harry’s neck. “This.” He moves his hips even more suggestively, pressing his crotch against Harry’s. Sweet Mother of Merlin.
“You know, I thought it was stupid when my assistant gave me this,” Potter said, holding up a chapstick. “But…”
“Nobody knows about this Potter, about my involvement at least. Pansy and Blaise know, oh, and Luna, but I made them swear not to tell anybody.”
“What did you just say?” Draco whispers. Potter just stares at him. “What did you just—” Draco breaks off as his brain goes into overdrive. There was something Potter said last night. Something Draco didn’t think much of when he woke up this morning because, surely, that was a dream. It was only a dream!
Oh God, this was even worse! Now, his bum was nestled in Harry’s lap! And the only thing separating his bum from Harry’s lap were two very thin layers of fabric.
Draco feels a tremor tear through him. His fists are clenched, his jaw muscles tense, his chest tight, his knees wobbly. He’s breathing heavily as his stomach twists viciously, the hot feeling inside it beginning to spread, infecting the rest of his body. Like venom. He stares down the empty corridor, lit by torches. His vision blurs, little spots appearing in front of him. He feels dizzy. He wants to scream. He wants this feeling inside of him to take a physical form, so he can punch it, destroy it.
They sit in silence for a while, gazing into the sunrise and listening to the soft chirps of the birds.
Draco marveled at the sensation of Potter’s rim fluttering beneath his tongue. He used the tip to draw circles around it, eliciting all kinds of filthy and delicious sounds from Potter, which, in return, had his cock throbbing and leaking.
He finally drifted off, dreaming about colourful feathers and being chased through the garden of the Manor.
“What is your life like these days?” Potter asked. Draco couldn’t detect an undertone. He sounded genuinely curious. However, Draco didn’t want to discuss that with him. He didn’t want to discuss anything with Potter right now. He was short of breath and, surely, Potter would notice. His gaze darted to his left and, acting as though someone had just waved him over, he put on an almost convincing smile.
Harry tries to busy himself with studying for the upcoming Auror exam. Written tests were never his strong suit. But he can always make it up with—
Okay, apparently that hadn’t been too bad. He gently sucked on one of them, until Potter was squirming so much, Draco slung his arm around his thigh to keep him in place.
Hmpf. How the hell is Harry supposed to accidentally bump into Malfoy, accidentally graze his hand with his or do bloody anything when Malfoy just wants to sit here and bloody read? This is bollocks.
The wise thing to do would be to let go, and leave the Gryffindor to his fate. But, somehow, Draco finds himself clinging to the prat. He tries to restrain him as Potter squirms and pushes against Draco, before he finally breaks free and tumbles to the ground. Draco watches as he crawls into the bathroom, and then throws up violently in the sink.
“You sure you don’t want it?” Potter asked, oblivious to Draco’s sudden inner turmoil. Not trusting his voice at this moment, he just waved a dismissive hand in the air. Potter shrugged and lifted one of the ice lollies to his mouth.
Malfoy snorts, and Harry thinks there might be a tiny tear running down his cheek, but he has no time to confirm because he’s suddenly yanked into a hug and Malfoy is pressing their bodies together and breathing into his hair and Harry is so stunned but his heart literally just skipped several beats and is this really happening?
“Draco,” Harry whispers, his voice thick with emotion. Before he can say anything else, Draco shoves him away and Harry lands on his arse. He gapes at the Slytherin, who looks down on him with such a cold expression, it almost makes Harry cringe. He watches as Draco turns on his heels, unlocks the door and opens it. Harry’s breath catches in his throat when he hesitates in the doorframe. He has no idea what to expect next. Draco is sending him so many mixed signals, it makes his head spin. But then, he clenches his fists and starts to move out of the room.
“As if I’d let you of all people anywhere near my hair,” Malfoy sniffs. “Clearly, you’re the opposite of an expert when it comes to grooming.”
If Draco hadn’t been so overwhelmed, he would have been furious at himself for squeaking like a little child.
“I think it’s nice,” Harry murmurs. He takes a deep breath, relishing the smell of the chilled spring night. “I like watching the stars with you.”
Malfoy wrinkles his nose but crawls onto the bed without another word. He doesn’t even comment on the sheets. At least not verbally. The look of utter terror on his face speaks volumes.
Draco raised an eyebrow. If he didn’t know any better, he’d say the koala was leaning into Teddy’s touch; it even closed its eyes.
Potter waves a dismissive hand in the air. This will be the fourth blind date Draco arranged for him, and Draco has no doubt about how it will turn out. Michael Backford is a despicable sod. He can be charming if he wants to, but there’s only really one thing he’s after; commitment isn’t really his thing. And since Potter isn’t the type to sleep around, he’ll ditch Michael faster than the dimwit can hit the Bludger.
Draco only realises Potter is staring at him when he pours the last of the wine into his glass. He sits back, suddenly feeling a little too exposed. He shouldn’t have told Potter. He shouldn’t have said anything at all.
He presses his lips into a tight line as he descends the stairs. He walks into a dimly lit room, the music vibrating through him. There are only a few customers scattered around the stage in the middle of the room. Harry picks a seat in the darkest corner, far away from the others and orders a firewhisky. He peeks at the dark haired dancer and slowly relaxes. Maybe he can do this after all.
Harry bumps into something else and immediately tumbles. His hands try to grab something, anything, that will prevent him from falling. His brain needs a second to register that his hands have indeed succeeded and he isn’t lying on the floor. But he has no idea what his hands have grabbed. It feels… soft. It takes him another second to notice there are hands on him. He’s being held. One hand between his shoulder blades, the other on his hip. The hands are cold. Very cold. But the body he’s being pressed against is warm. Harry’s heart jumps at the unexpected and sudden realisation.
Draco hadn’t believed his ears when Potter had told him he didn’t hold a grudge against him. Sometimes, Draco almost felt like he had gotten off too easy. He hadn’t understood how Potter could forgive him for what he had done. How could Potter forgive him when Draco hadn’t forgiven himself? Sometimes, when he was feeling gloomy, he still asked himself that question.
As much as he wished he and Harry could have taken a shower together, Harry wasn’t there yet. They had done lots of stuff, though, and it wasn’t like Draco was complaining. Sure, it was frustrating sometimes, but he wanted Harry to feel comfortable with what they were doing. He’d never want Harry to do something just because he thought Draco was impatient. Draco would wait. It would be worth it.
Unsure of what to do, Draco stays rigid. Potter is still staring at him. If one of them moved even an inch closer, their lips would be touching. They would be kissing. Merlin, they would be
“Sorry,” he mumbles and quickly turns away. Leave it to him to embarrass himself when he isn’t even the one standing there practically naked. Well, he’s about to be.
Potter didn’t answer, his expression turning more painful. Draco let out a sigh before he pressed their foreheads together.
As his fingers continued to stroke the soft curls, he frowned. No, Harry wasn’t his enemy at night. During the day, Draco kept up his snarky attitude and his animosity. But at night, there was no need for that. At night, he could simply stare at the boy who made his heart beat faster, who made his scalp prickle and who was responsible for the smile Draco had to hide once dawn was breaking.
Draco slips into the bed and turns to the window, away from Potter. He pulls the duvet up to his chin, his hand clinging on to it, as though that will make the spinning stop.
Then something happens. The two spells, fired by Harry and Ron, seem to be unifying, as if they’re deciding they’re stronger, can do more harm together.
Malfoy sighs. “Because of the moonlight,” he says, as though it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “It needs to be on your skin. Everywhere.”
Draco opens his mouth, but no sound comes out. This… this is madness. Utter madness. Potter can’t be serious. Why would he even want that?
“It was a misunderstanding,” Harry snaps, to which Ginny starts to laugh. “Alright, fine, whatever. Can I borrow some parchment? And a quill? And some ink?”
“Harry, my boy,” Slughorn booms, and Harry thinks he hears him approaching his bed. “Your suffering shall be over soon.”
“Yeah, McGonagall just popped up in our fireplace and told us to come here. Nearly gave me a heart attack,” Weasley says.
It’s almost dark outside when Potter comes shuffling through the door. Draco immediately averts his gaze.
As they continued walking down the street, Draco peered sideways and saw that Potter’s face was rather flushed and there were little beads of sweat running down his neck, too.
“Weirdly enough, I don’t feel that bad about you not having to dance half naked in front of strangers anymore.”
“Potter!” Draco darts forward and throws himself on his knees beside Potter’s lifeless body. “Don’t be dead, please don’t be dead.” He grabs one of Potter’s hands; it’s icy and limp. “No, Potter, please.” Draco feels hot tears stream down his face. He is utterly unprepared for the branch that hits him in the ribs and sends him flying through the air once more.
“Tsk!” Draco watched, grudgingly, as Teddy petted the koala’s head. “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me,” Draco groaned when the koala closed its eyes and waggled its ears.
Draco’s eyes drop to their joined hands again and he immediately stills his index finger. He hasn’t noticed he’s been doing that.
“Potter, I didn’t storm into the Ministry and demand they make you an Auror. You did it by yourself.”
“I think further discussion of the matter is in order. We should take this to my office and let these gentlemen get some rest. Severus, if you would be so kind as to accompany me.” He sounds stern again. “Poppy, where did you put their wands?”
“I know,” Potter gasps and collapses onto his back while Draco’s hand moves of its own accord. “Fuck, fuck, fuck! FUCK!”
“We’re having drinks now,” he pointed out. In all honesty, Draco didn’t remember that particular conversation. Apparently, there was a lot he didn’t remember about that night. But even if he had, he wouldn’t have owled Potter. Immediately.
The two cups came floating back and Potter grabbed his as swiftly and elegantly as he always had with the Snitch. Maybe it was a testament of adulthood that Draco could finally admit that without grinding his teeth. Although he was still convinced the word ‘elegant’ had no place anywhere near Potter.
Harry blinks at Hermione, wondering how he could have forgotten she and Ron are sitting across from him.
to be kidding me,” Draco hisses as he hears something that kicks his pulse into overdrive within seconds.
“Remind me to thank McGonagall for making us wear these,” Draco hisses in Potter’s direction, tugging at his robes.
Potter stared at him, wide-eyed. It took a few seconds before he slowly nodded. Draco took a deep breath. He had never felt more vulnerable in his life. Not only was he, quite literally, exposing himself to Potter, he was about to expose what he had so desperately been trying to hide. But he had a feeling it was now or never.
Now that wasn’t exactly true. And it became harder and harder to hide it every day. Literally. Draco, running around the flat in just his pants or simply a towel, really wasn’t helping this whole situation either.
“Ha ha,” Harry says dryly after his torso is finally covered again. He groans when he realises he put his shirt on backwards. “Bugger!”
“Don’t you feel it?” Potter countered. “The knots in your stomach, your heart almost leaping out of your chest, your toes and your fingertips tingling?”
“But even if you had been my friend, I still would have kicked your arse at Quidditch every single time, obviously.”
On the other hand, who else could Potter have gone to? There was literally no one else in this house. But he could have gone to one of his friends… right? He said he wasn’t ready to face them, but still, he didn’t have to stay here. So why did he?
“By the way, thanks for making me wear that V-neck,” Harry said, making a face while he put the kids’ brooms back into the closet. “One kid saw my tattoo.”
Harry handed Draco another tissue before sitting down next to him. He lifted his hand and gently put it on Draco’s forehead.
The sparks intensify while the smoke does something very strange; it curls around Malfoy’s waist, drawing him closer to Harry.
“How are you feeling?” Dumbledore asks. Harry isn’t sure how to answer that. Usually, he would have just said ‘fine’, even if it wasn’t true. In his experience, people don’t really care. But he knows Dumbledore is asking because he genuinely wants to know, and even if Harry lied, Dumbledore would probably see right through him. So Harry decides to ignore the question.
Harry stays silent, dread and embarrassment crashing down on him yet again. He endures the chatter of the others stoically all throughout dinner, but excuses himself as soon as his plate is empty. All he wants to do is to crawl into bed and never leave it again.
Draco didn’t know if that made things better or worse or if he should believe Potter at all. But at least it made some sense; there was no way Potter would want to be hugged by Draco.
Potter still looked hesitant, but he slowly climbed into bed and lay down, facing Draco. Draco cleared his throat before he let his head fall back down onto the pillow, pointedly looking at the ceiling. He could feel Potter’s eyes on him, the unspoken question he was probably dying to ask weighing down on Draco’s chest as though he was already lying on top of him.
“I’ve been waiting for this all day,” Malfoy whispers and lets out a shuddering breath that pierces Harry to his core.
After everything they did in the last week, Harry never would have thought kissing Malfoy could be that overwhelming. But nothing could have prepared him for the feeling of his tongue, slowly sliding against the Slytherin’s. It’s better than his first bite of treacle tart. It’s more thrilling than catching the Snitch. It’s even more glorious than the first time he was able to cast a Patronus.
“None of this is fair,” Draco retorted. “Look, you told me you were worried about disappointing people, but forget about that. You shouldn’t care about what other people think.”
“No,” she whispers. “He’s sitting under a tree, by himself. And from the looks of it, he’s trying to kill us with his glare.”
“Realised what?” Draco asked. His heart skipped a beat when he saw the look on Potter’s face; warm and tender.
“Whatever happened to her, it happened on September 2nd,” Draco says, ignoring Potter’s dismissive tone.
“He won’t be able to do anything,” Draco says. “There is an antidote, but it takes three days to brew it and by then, the effect will have worn off on its own.”
“Um. Hold on.” Harry turns, intending to walk over to his drawer, only to be yanked back to the bed and landing flat on his back with his head bumping against Malfoy’s knees. “Ow!”
He wanders the corridors at night, desperately trying to distract himself. It’s not working. Then he finds him, sitting on the stairs leading to the Entrance Hall. He doesn’t even seem surprised when he sits down next to him. Everything is quiet. Until he hears a sob beside him. He’s covering his face with his hands, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably. He hesitates, only for a moment, before he shifts closer and carefully puts an arm around him. There are tears forming in his eyes as well and for once, he’s not ashamed of them.
Honestly, Draco didn’t share the sentiment. He was far more comfortable watching Potter from afar. He had been doing it for the last two hours, his eyes rarely leaving that poorly tamed black hair as Potter made his round through the room. It may have been a bit childish, but Draco wasn’t playing cat and mouse for his amusement. He was doing it to keep his sanity intact.
“You should stay here for another day, get some rest,” Madam Pomfrey says. She scurries away and Draco finds himself unable to look Potter in the eye. He tries not to feel disappointed when Potter withdraws his hand and clears his throat.
“Stop it!” Water was dripping down his face and he felt his shirt clinging to his chest and stomach. “Great,” he grumbled. With a flick of his wand, he vanished the water. “Now hold still.”
“Thanks,” Draco says awkwardly. He gets changed while Potter waits outside and wobbles to the door on unsteady legs. He feels exhausted and drained, but this is important.
A part of Harry wants to snap at Malfoy, at his patronising words. Only, they don’t sound patronising.
He mentally berated his heartbeat for betraying him. His 15 year old self would be so smug and beyond himself to know he had finally done it; he finally had Potter in his arms. But his 24 year old self knew it was only because Potter probably had nightmares and was haunted by his past. It had nothing to do with Draco.
Trying to keep his voice even, Draco scoffs. “If this is so unbearable for you, I guess we can go back to—”
Of course, there was no way Malfoy could get all that from a smile but, against everything Harry feared at this moment, Malfoy slowly put a hand over Harry’s, gently closing his fingers around it, and smiled back.
Potter says nothing at first. When he does, his voice sounds more reserved than it did before. “What about, err—”
The moment Potter turns to look at him, Draco freezes. Fuck. So much for not blurting it out. But maybe it’s a good thing. Now it’s finally out and—
“Actually, he did get bitten,” Draco says matter-of-factly. “Haven’t you noticed how much hairier he’s gotten?” He wiggles his eyebrows at the wizards, who are staring at him in horror. He can’t help but snigger when he exits the lift, wondering how long it will take until Potter gets called in for inspection.
Draco watches helplessly as Potter hurries out of the tent, wand raised. It’s easier said than done to stay where he is. The voice is calling him and the allure is almost strong enough to make him crawl outside. For the first time, Draco is grateful for the Goblin wine. Even if he wanted to, he can’t move his legs; especially now that Potter is gone. Draco grits his teeth, trying to fight through the pain.
“I’m not going to sit here and listen to this bollocks,” Draco barked, jumping out of his seat so fast, the chair fell over. “You don’t get to make me the bad guy anymore.”
“If it would have been him, he would have waited until the end of the night, until you were on your doorstep.” He drops his voice, brushing his fingers through Potter’s hair and relishes the blush on Potter’s cheeks. “He would have touched the corner of your mouth ever so slightly,” Draco mentally cheers when Potter shudders, “and you would have felt your heart beating faster.” Draco tries to ignore his own heartbeat and concentrates on keeping his voice steady. “And as he leaned in, you would have closed your eyes, waiting in anticipation for his lips to touch yours.”
“Hmmm.” Potter’s eyes flickered down to Draco’s lips. “Like how I want to grab you right now and kiss you until you can’t breathe.”
Maybe Harry would have made a big thing out of it if he didn’t know Draco so well. But he does. And Draco knows Harry doesn’t want a big, over the top gesture either. Maybe as a joke. But this is far too important and precious to make fun of. Maybe in twenty years. But not today. Today, Draco just wants to enjoy this moment. Their first anniversary of many to come.
“Could what?” Draco said softly. Potter only shook his head. “What are you so afraid of? What could be so bad you can’t tell me?”
“Bend over,” he whispered. A violent shudder ran down Draco’s spine, making him sure he would pass out any second. Without hesitation, he leaned forward, grabbing the arms of the chair. He groaned as he felt Potter’s hard cock against his now bare arse. It was a shame Potter was still fully clothed.
Before Draco knows what he’s doing, he takes the empty glass on his bedside table and smashes it. He sees Potter jump.
Harry grinds his teeth, trying to resist the urge to turn around onto his back. This position is already getting uncomfortable, but he mustn’t move. It would be very unwise. God, why did he cast that spell? Why didn’t ‘bond magic’ ring more alarms in his head? In retrospect, going to the Restricted Section was the dumbest idea he ever had. He should have known it would get him into trouble. But it wouldn’t have been as bad if Malfoy hadn’t shown up. To some extent, it’s
She doesn’t answer. She keeps staring at Potter, her already pale face turning positively white as she slowly gets up and backs away.
“Maybe we could come up with a signal. You know, for when you want to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. It would make this… almost a conversation.”
It’s funny, Harry thinks, how dreams sometimes show you things you never knew you wanted. He never realised the warmth of another human could be something he craved. He always feels awkward when somebody hugs him. He never knows where to put his hands, how much pressure to apply, how long you’re supposed to stay in that position. Some might say he’s overthinking it. But how can he not? Being hugged is still such a weird concept to him, even though Hermione has done it to him a thousand times. But it made him so much more aware of his feelings. How soothing it feels to bury his face in her curls, the awkwardness that washes over him when Ron pats him on the back while Harry’s face is squished against his chest, making Harry even more aware of their height-difference. The longing he feels for his parents when Molly pulls him close to her. The tingling in his stomach when Ginny’s arms curl around his waist, her head heavy on his shoulder. At least that’s what it used to feel like. He hasn’t hugged Ginny in a while. She was always the one who initiated it. It felt nice, but Harry never had the reflex to reach for her himself. It’s almost as though he’s waiting for other people to signal to him that it’s okay to touch them.
“If you really want me to leave…” Potter brought his free hand up to Draco’s face, and for a second, Draco thought he was going to touch him. But his fingers hovered inches away from his jaw, before he dropped his hand again. Draco almost felt disappointed. “But if you don’t want me to leave…”
Harry inhales sharply, causing their lips to brush against each other once more. Malfoy’s lips are so soft and all Harry wants to do is taste them, run his tongue over them and—
“Of course,” he muttered, poking at his eggs. Draco cleared his throat. The atmosphere in the room had suddenly shifted, making Potter’s presence more uncomfortable. If that was even possible. A part of Draco just wanted to kick him out. Another part wanted to cling to him and never let go. Never let it be said Draco Malfoy can’t compromise.
“I couldn’t have said it better myself, Malfoy,” McGonagall said as she handed him a large envelope.
Grumbling under his breath, he threw himself into his favourite armchair and picked up the Daily Prophet. He instantly sighed when he saw the front-page article. Granger. Of course. There was a picture of her in the middle of what seemed to be a very heated speech. Draco didn’t have to read the article to know it was probably about house-elves. Again. According to the Daily Prophet, she had made it her life’s mission to free every single house-elf in existence ever since she joined the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
“Right,” Ron snorts. “Well, if he doesn’t give a rat’s arse, neither do we. I don’t have a problem avoiding the pompous git.”
Mere seconds after he finished untying the letter, the owl screeched and took off again. Apparently, whoever had sent it didn’t expect a reply. Draco watched the owl vanish into the sky, before sinking down on his bed, careful not to make any sudden movements. The potion was working, he did feel better, but he still had a splitting headache.
“You of all people do not want me to say this out loud, believe me,” Terry said unblinking. Malfoy scrutinised him and Harry noticed a strange expression flicker across his face. “Unless you want to explain why these boundaries don’t seem to apply to you. Especially-”
“Some very fluffy and cute animals,” his mother finished. Draco gave her a lopsided smirk. Apparently, they had both forgotten what they were called.
“The Headmistress is awaiting you in her office. With the information we’ve received, it appears you two will be staying there for a while.”
Moving his hands down, Draco gripped Potter’s hips and pushed them up. He awkwardly tried to push down his pants and was only successful when Potter helped. Merlin, now they were both naked. Without thinking twice about it, Draco rolled them over, until Potter was on his back. He swiftly sat back on his heels to appreciate the view in front of him. Sweet Salazar, Potter was captivating. Draco trailed a finger down his chest, over his stomach, until he reached his cock. Draco hadn’t even touched him yet but he was already hard.
“Potter! Oh! Yes!” Without knowing what he’s doing, he releases Potter’s arse and presses one hand against the small of his back; the other flies up to the back of Potter’s neck. “Yes! Yes!” Draco hisses when Potter sucks his earlobe into his mouth. Merlin, he had no idea this tiny, useless body part could unleash that much pleasure. Then again, he would have never guessed that Potter of all people could cause such a thunderstorm of desire inside of him; these past few days have been full of surprises.
“What, why you love me?” Harry immediately says, smacking his lips. Draco hides his face behind his hands and starts laughing; the way only Harry can make him. He asked himself that question a lot in the past, why he fell in love with The Boy Who Lived of all people. But the answer is simple.
“We’re not sure. His classmates say they haven’t seen him since yesterday morning. They only came to Professor Slughorn now because they didn’t want to give him a false alarm.”
“M—Malfoy?” he splutters. He waits for the taps on his hand and surely enough, he feels them a second later.
Harry’s only consolation for feeling like a complete idiot was that Draco looked like somebody had just smacked him across the face.
“Oh,” Draco said, grateful for the change in topic, but also slightly pleased Potter seemed to remember little details about his family. “Yes, I’m going to stay with her over the holidays. What about you?”
“Even though I do envy you for not having to share a room with anyone,” he wrinkles his nose as they approach Harry’s hut, “I really don’t envy you for having to sleep in
“Oh, I think we can make use of them in a much better way,” Potter chuckled, burying his hands in Draco’s hair. Draco groaned. He couldn’t believe this was really happening. After all this time. Finally!
“Your—” Malfoy’s mouth drops open. “Are you kidding me? Did you have this the whole time? Is that how you—” He presses his lips into a tight line. “I can’t believe you have an Invisibility Cloak. Do you have any idea how rare they are?”
Harry huffs. “I looked for you the whole time! I told you that! But you went to fucking France without telling me.”
So when Harry sees Draco enter the tower, his body doesn’t go rigid. It relaxes. When Draco sits down beside him and their fingers touch, Harry doesn’t pull away. He welcomes the warmth. When Draco doesn’t say anything, Harry isn’t annoyed. He understands.
She squeaks again, but, to Harry’s excitement, she takes the note, stuffs it into her little pouch and zooms off. He watches, heart pounding up to his throat, as Penny crawls onto Malfoy’s head and he finally jumps out of his stupor. He squints, trying to make out what Malfoy is saying to her, but it’s no use. It doesn’t matter anyway. Penny, the clever little thing, reaches into her pouch and throws the note in Malfoy’s face. He seems to be telling her off, but she’s already on her way back to Harry.
“Relax,” Draco whispered, pulling Harry into his arms. “We can go slow, okay? We won’t do anything you don’t want to.”
Draco inwardly groaned. “It’s one of the few things the Ministry let me keep,” he said, almost defensively. “Were you involved in those decisions, too?”
“You want to have another heart to heart?” he said, teasingly. Potter shrugged, as if he wanted to say ‘Why not?’ “I’m not a big fan of crowds,” Draco said, tapping a finger against his cup. “And your Gryffindor friends aren’t exactly—”
Potter lets out a sigh and turns back to the window. His shoulders seem tense as he presses one of his palms against the glass. “I slept with him,” he says quietly.
“Yuck! Stop that,” he howls in mock disgust. He playfully slaps Malfoy’s hand away, but decides to grab his arm halfway through. As soon as he does, Malfoy becomes completely rigid. Harry frowns in confusion.
He cringes as he feels his stomach turn. The red eyes are fixing him with a glare. The spindly fingers tighten around his wand.
Well, it’s only natural he’s confused. Right? He’s never been held the way Malfoy is holding him right now. His warmth is so soothing. And he smells quite nice. His fingers, though. His fingers make Harry nervous. The gentle caress of his shoulder feels… so intimate.
“I don’t think so,” Harry replies. He takes out his quill and parchment and keeps his eyes on Slughorn.
So, somehow, the thought that Malfoy might understand, implants itself in Harry’s brain and pushes him to try and see the bigger picture. In a way, Voldemort is both their enemy. Malfoy might be a Death Eater, but Harry’s doubts about his loyalty to Voldemort keep growing the longer he thinks about it. But… still, as long as Malfoy keeps working for him, he poses a threat, no matter his motivation.
“What the fuck, Potter!” Malfoy stomps his foot. “Did you seriously just put a fucking flower crown on my head?”
So imagine Draco’s surprise when he wasn’t met with the same fate. He knows it’s got nothing to do with the fact that Potter has already gone through five partners. Everyone knows it’s only a matter of time before Potter takes over the Auror Department; he can basically do as he pleases.
rubbing against his, was absolute bliss. He arched his back when Potter started playing with one of his nipples.
Potter presses his lips together. Draco knows that look. He’s trying to decide if he should say what he clearly wants to, but something’s holding him back.
“Ah!” Draco almost lept off the bed when Potter cradled his balls through his pants and started massaging them. As if that wasn’t enough, he slowly closed his mouth around Draco’s cock. Fuck! Potter knew what he was doing! Somehow, it was such a turn on to feel the heat of his mouth without
“Damn it, Draco, you and your bloody pride,” Parkinson nearly shouts. “I wrote you so many times and you never answered!”
None of this would have happened if Potter hadn’t tried to play the hero again, consequently forcing Draco into the role of the villain. Up to recently, he wouldn’t have minded it much. He had always liked to be respected or even feared. But now… now he knows what it means to be the villain, what it requires. He’s not sure if he can go through with it. His last two attempts have failed, and he’s terrified to make another mistake. Another mistake could cost him the life of his mother. Or his father. Eventually, his own.
Harry shudders once more when Malfoy brushes his fingers against Harry’s neck. He should be embarrassed that his body is so receptive to Malfoy’s touch. He should be embarrassed that he’s panting and staring at Malfoy’s lips. But somehow, that is the least of his concerns right now. He’s far more interested in the tiny mole on the right corner of Malfoy’s mouth. He’s far too absorbed in the sensation of Malfoy’s body pressed against his.
Draco pressed his face into her thighs. He just wanted the pain to stop. He didn’t want to feel like this anymore.
They sat there in silence for a while, the koala still pointedly not looking at him, and Draco wondered what was going on in its little head. Eventually, he hesitantly opened his arms. The koala peeked at him which made Draco smile. After long moments, it finally crawled closer and wrapped its arms and feet around him. Draco realised the koala was trembling and gently put his hands on its back. Whatever was going on with this little beast, it made Draco’s heart squeeze.
He strips off his shirt, knowing he’ll be sweaty within minutes, grabs the axe that’s leaning against the logs and ignores Malfoy’s stare.
His seemingly innocent touches turn bolder with every lesson; putting his hand on Draco's knee under the desk, sitting so close to him that their thighs are pressed up against each other, and tentatively stroking Draco’s free hand while he stirs the potion.
Draco laughed nervously. He didn’t like that this made him feel… cheerful. On the other hand, it was… kind of nice.
Draco’s eyes dart to the window, right beside the bed, where a screech owl is tapping its beak against the glass. He crawls forward, opens the window and unties the letter from the owl’s foot with nimble fingers. His eyes scan the words, relief washing over him. Nick finally has time for the firecall Draco suggested.
“Pfft.” Draco fakes a laugh. Since when is Potter so observant? Draco can’t let him know how right he is. Honestly, given the choices, touching Potter doesn’t seem as bad as losing face in front of him. It’s not like he
Draco forces himself not to flinch, not even to twitch a finger as he stares impassively into those green eyes. What is he supposed to do? The Dark Lord will torture them, he’ll  probably kill them all if they let Potter and his friends escape. Draco can’t be responsible for the death of his family. But can he bear the responsibility of Potter’s death? Of their only hope? The person he wishes more than anything will save them? The person he—
Harry doesn’t want to jump to any conclusions. That won’t go down well. But, as always, his tongue is quicker than his brain.
His mother would probably tell him how unbecoming it is to gape at someone like that, but he can’t seem to move, still paralysed with shock, while he tries to ignore the strange buzzing in his ears.
The silence that follows seems stifling. Draco looks away again and it hasn’t escaped Harry’s notice that he tensed up.
Mentally congratulating and slapping himself, Draco trudges after him, wondering how he’s going to survive the night.
Harry keeps his gaze on the stars as he waits for Draco to answer. The sky is so clear tonight and the grass smells of late summer. Crickets are chirping in the distance and it is the only sound interrupting the long and heavy silence.
“Stop that, whatever you’re doing,” Potter grumbles. Draco’s jaw clenches and he rips out the pages even more forcefully. It helps with the anger coursing through him, but he still feels the urge to take the book and toss it at Potter and his stupid scar.
They stared at each other wordlessly for long moments, until Draco cleared his throat and withdrew his hand.
Harry gapes at him, processing all the confusing emotions that seem to fight against each other in the pit of his stomach. It seems unfair to be blamed for this. It wasn’t his intention to humiliate Malfoy. Besides, if anyone wants this to go away, it’s Harry.
“Stop that!” Potter makes a grab for Draco’s wrist. “Stop shaking, you—” The moment Potter’s hand makes contact with Draco’s skin, something changes. The creases on his face are smoothed out and he gapes at Draco as though he just woke up from a dream. “I’m—I’m sorry. I—” He shakes his head. “I don’t know what came over me.” He lets go of Draco’s wrist.
“Oh!” Draco’s mouth drops open when Potter starts kissing his cheeks. This… is an interesting position. He shudders when Potter’s tongue darts out and licks into his cleft. Fuck.
Harry had always wondered what it would be like to hold somebody like that. Or to be held. Memories of his dreams, about Malfoy holding him, pop into his head, but he has to admit, having Malfoy in his arms for real is much nicer than he imagined. He wonders if it’s the same for Malfoy. Oh. Maybe it isn’t.
Draco watches as Potter lies down on his back and stretches, causing his jumper to ride up. Merlin’s fucking beard, Draco wants to touch that beautiful skin so badly. If he didn’t know any better, he’d suspect Potter’s showing off his fucking happy trail on purpose.
Ignoring the fact that everyone in the room was watching him, he slowly raised his hand and ran his fingers through Malfoy’s hair. The Slytherin let out a long sigh that made the corners of Harry’s mouth twitch.
So this is it. They’re really going to do this. Shit. Anticipation courses through him, mingled with wariness. He gasps. He feels the tip of Potter’s cock against his entrance. Merlin, this is really happening. His mouth drops open in a silent whimper as Potter pushes his cock harder against him. Merlin! Draco feels himself being stretched open, the pain zinging through him, followed by a rush of pleasure.
This time, it was Draco who couldn’t hold Potter’s gaze. He stared at their joined hands in his lap, feeling like a fool.
“Fuck, yes,” Potter hissed. Draco choked, his cock throbbing, as Potter spread his cheeks apart and his tongue dipped into his cleft once more.
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Draco said with a dismissive gesture, gulping down his too hot tea. He made a face as the liquid burnt his mouth and the embarrassment burnt his cheeks.
It feels… weird. Now that the tingling is gone, Draco realises how sore he is. He notices Potter waving his hand and freezes. This is it. This is the moment he dreaded. Potter always closed himself off after he cleaned them up.
“Oh, Harry.” Granger bends down and wraps an arm around his shoulders. Potter lets his hands slip from his face.
Draco grits his teeth. Weasley is defending him just as fiercely as Potter had him the other day. Their loyalty to each other makes Draco want to hex them.
“Well,” Teddy said, his lips stretching into a big smile, “we have the whole night to make him like you.”
“I think you secretly like that I’m sitting here with you.” His eyes scanned Malfoy’s face, waiting for something that would tell him he was right. “And I think you’d also like it if I did this.” He reached out and grabbed Malfoy’s hand. He leaned forward while simultaneously tugging Malfoy toward him.
been hugged as a child? As an adult? Draco still didn’t know everything about Harry’s past, but the things he had told him, still appalled him. Looking back, Draco hadn’t had the best childhood either, but, at least, he had been happy then.
“I did a lot of things I regret,” he says, intent on letting Potter know he’s not some pathetic loser. “And maybe I would do things differently today, but I’d still do anything to keep my family safe.” He leans his head against the back of the armchair, relishing the warmth of the fire. Several minutes go by and Draco is almost ready to doze off when Potter speaks again.
“Which proves you’re the real sop in this relationship,” Harry smirks. He presses the badge and the words “Potter stinks” dissolve into “but I love him anyway”. It had been the first time Draco had said it. Well, technically he didn't say it. Until this day, he has never said it out loud, but Harry doesn’t need to hear it to know how he feels.
They move awkwardly, the sleeping bag too tight to execute the ridiculous task. Potter unzips it and they both flop to the other side.
Heart beating frantically, Draco takes the last step out of the castle and glances over his shoulder.
Harry lowers his head to the table, frustration crashing down on him. Of fucking course he’s sitting in the fucking library, trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with him. It’s the fucking story of his life. But since nobody seems to know what’s wrong with him, or, in Slughorn’s case, reluctant to tell him, this is all he can do. Even Neville and Professor Sprout don’t have any ideas.
“Can you sit up?” Malfoy cradles the back of his head while Harry tries to move and groans in pain. Just when he thought this couldn’t get any worse, he catches sight of the ground around him, of the gazillion roses he landed on. This, Harry decides, is the most embarrassing moment in his entire life. He’s literally lying on a bed of roses while Malfoy is holding him. This is fucking bollocks.
“Never mind who did it,” Blaise said with a dismissive gesture. “The question is, can you leave it there? I bet you can’t.”
Potter is several feet off the ground, the Whomping Willow’s branches curled around him. The sight is absolutely horrifying, especially against the glow of the crimson sky; it looks like it’s about to rain blood.
Draco was on the verge of panicking. They had been living in their secure little bubble. He wasn’t ready to face reality just yet.
Potter raises an eyebrow. “So… there’s nothing standing between us? Nothing awkward, or maybe something we need to discuss?”
He can’t stand the constant praise, being patted on the shoulder and congratulated for something that cost so many people their lives. Yes, he stopped Voldemort, but it wasn’t all his doing. He never would have succeeded without his friends and all the people who helped along the way. He’s not the hero people make him out to be. He doesn’t want to be. He never has. But Harry doubts people will understand that. There was an article in the Daily Prophet a few weeks ago, singing his praises for choosing to do something meaningful by offering his help to the school he saved from destruction. It honestly doesn’t matter what he does; he could go buy a new broom and the Prophet would find a way to put some kind of hero-spin on it. He’s so freaking tired of it.
