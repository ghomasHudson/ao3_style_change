The next day, snow blanketed the grounds, but in their special place in the forest, there wasn't any, however it was as cold as if there was.
Harry finally had the strength to get up and sit next to him. Draco just gave him a death glare. "What?"
And that's what Harry felt right now. Like each and every wound Draco had given him started to reopen. After Draco had worshiped his body, promised him a lifetime—things that Harry didn't take lightly and invested all of his hope into because he thought he was free now. He thought happiness was a possibility.
"You little shit," Draco shouted, maintaining his balance and awaiting the staircase to reach the opposite landing. Harry almost laughed at it, but then he remembered
The week continued to dread on slowly, almost that of a snail, and Harry and Draco found themselves itching to see each other again.
Some time later, detention finished and began his walk to the Gryffindor Common Room. Just as he stood before the Fat Lady's portrait, who was sleeping, he felt a body pressed tight to his and a smell that he instantly recognized.
"It's payback from the train," Harry said simply. He got up and put back on his shirt to leave Draco staring with his mouth hanging open. "What?"
Potter's face fell to one of boredom. "Worse than I thought. And the bar was pretty low. I felt absolutely nothing."
She blinked a few times, more tears falling from her face. "How does it feel when you know you can't be with Draco?"
"This is out of my expertise," Madam Pomfrey said. "We can feed him bulking potions all day long, if he doesn't stop his behavior, he'll keep ending up back here."
"Funny how irony works," he said. His heart raced. This was Harry's best friend. And everything was going so well with Harry. He didn't need any more conflict. Not now when they were so close. "I promise, no tricks, no games on him. My feelings for him are genuine. Who I am is here to stay, too. I just can't always show it. I have a reputation to uphold. Life isn't that simple with a Dark Lord running around, is it? I hope you understand how private we've had to stay."
While he had his back turned as he walked to his door, Harry reached down and scraped up any last glop of pie guts in one of the pans, receiving a heavy handful of it. Just as Draco reached to open his door, Harry snuck up behind him and pulled on his waistband, shoving the banana cream pie down into his trousers.
"Because I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm scared you'll leave if you find out that Voldemort has some sort of grip on me. And it's funny because I've thought about breaking it off with you a hundred times just to protect you, but the thought of you actually leaving and me actually being alone... It'll be safer for all of you but I don't think I could survive it. "
"No you're not," he shot up, "This is the fourth time I've found you on your damned deathbed. And not just the number four; one, two, and three come before it, then four! Like hell you're going back to being an auror!"
"Sounds just like something you would say," Draco scoffed and Harry looked at him. "It's not your fault my memory was erased, but you still blame yourself."
He walked all the way behind Draco, where he could look at the rips of his back, where his blades were in portion to his spine, how they moved when he breathed. Harry could tell he was nervous by the way his shoulders moved up and down, almost rapidly. And Harry almost didn't allow himself to be selfish and let his eyes roam to Draco's arse, but damn it, this was the last time, and didn't Harry deserve this? Didn't Harry deserve the chance to look at the body of his lover?
"The bet was stupid. If we didn't have the bet, I could have been able to prevent this. What if he gets expelled?"
Harry took Draco’s hand and squeezed it tightly, refusing to let go, as he knew what they had to talk about next. Draco’s face dropped and he nodded his head.
And Potter looked at him back, then gave a soft smile. Then, he looked at Draco's clothes, which outmatched Potter's own by miles. "Another ten thousand galleon coat?"
What also emphasized how much he wanted to go with Draco was when the blonde winked at him, or bit his lip in potions when he saw him... Harry thought that was really cute.
"A trial will determine that. I want you to feel safe, Harry. I want you to know that we'll be ensuring justice for every family who was hurt or lost a loved one because of this war. Including you. Now let's talk about that house. I can get you something protected in the countryside—"
"I don't give a shit that it's my birthday. I can celebrate tomorrow with my mum. Would you please just come for an hour?"
"I feel so alone." He sobbed some more and then wiped his eyes. "Who could ever live in a situation like this?”
"Harry," Draco shook him a bit, and Harry's legs unhooked, him falling into his seat, but his arms were still tight against Draco's neck. "I'll tickle you."
Draco didn't kiss him right away, but rather waited for Harry to make the first move. He had a lot to make up for, and earning Harry back wasn't going to be easy. It took him almost a year for him to earn it for the first time. Getting it back might take even longer.
Harry cried in his chest, and instead of pushing him away with his hand, he balled Draco's hoodie in his shaking fist and pulled him as close as he could. "Fuck!"
"Drop your wand, Harry," Draco tried to keep his eyes from watering, and the fight to keep him down got more and more difficult. "Drop it."
"I'm fucking you right now," Harry sounded dominant, and then he realized that it was still their first time, well, switching and he wasn't sure how comfortable Draco was with being bossed around. "If it's okay with you, are you ready?"
The only constant besides tragedy in his life was his love for Draco, and the only thing he wanted to remain constant until he died was the latter.
"Where do you want me to touch you," he kissed his shoulders again. Draco grabbed the hands that were on his hims and guided them to his front, and he bit his lip when a hand with the help of his own wrapped around him, hot and firm. Draco let out a small moan. "Here?"
How fucking long would it be until they went for it? Were they just going to pedal around and hesitate all day?
"Just reaching your adolescence, I see," he paused yet again and it made Draco feel sick. "You're a strapping young man, Draco. Tell me how all the girls are falling over you."
Kingsley had done as ordered and didn't speak with the press as long as Pumblechook was still there, but Harry wished he didn't give that order. He'd been trying to tell people it was all a lie but no one listened. Ginny's talk had worked on most of the Gryffindors, and Pansy scared a quarter of the Slytherins into calming down. Luna had no luck with Ravenclaw and Susan Bones didn't even try and speak with her housemates.
"It's not going to be like this forever. This is temporary," she said. Harry wasn't sure if he believed her. "You need to take care of yourself even when you don't feel meaning. You need to keep going even when you don't
"I'd bet that you would," Draco looked up. "You're obnoxiously lucky, but you have a bit of talent, too. Your luck would be what would make you win. Krum is more technical. But if the match happened, I'd put money on you."
How he strode down every step, and how flawless his hair was, and how beautiful his flawless face was dazzled Harry. What seemed like forever Draco reached the bottom and everything was in slow motion. He continued to stroll to the doors, as he passed Harry he winked and said "like what you see, Potter?" And then continued on as if nothing happened.
"Your relatives can't be that awful," Draco said, stroking behind Harry's ear, which calmed him down from the thought of his family.
"Thank you, Hermione." He leaned in to hug her and did so tightly, however he was disrupted by an angry voice.
Harry's eyes went wide as the urge to throw something filled him. To avoid it, he dug his fingernails into his palm. "I can't testify?"
"Yes, Draco," Harry sucked on the skin, and the lunged forward to kiss him mad. "Love you," he said in his mouth, and their tongues met, and Harry sucked on Draco's. Draco moaned. "Marry me?"
Draco sat there is shock. He didn't feel like moving, he didn't feel like working on the cabinet, hell he didn't even feel like looking for the cabinet. He just sat there, back against a large concrete support beam, shaking uncontrollably and sobbing and sulking to himself, letting it sink in that Harry Potter was his worst nightmare, and best dream.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and took his hand, guiding him to their usual broom closet for safe solitude. The hallway, due to their hidden nature, seemed to expose them.
He approached a large mirror with a dusty golden archway surrounding it. Draco moved closer to it, making out only a few letters, considering the fact it was layered with miles of spiders webs. It was probably written in some other language he didn't care to understand. He moved his eyes down to the reflective region of the mirror.
He pulled the tray closer to them and got off of him, but he laid on his stomach and took off the cover to reveal all the delicious treasures from the Great Hall.
"You did good, son. You did good," his father smiled at him. "In the war. I don't think you could have done any better than what you did."
"This is a music box. My aunt use to have one and I always played with it when she left the house. She'd kill me if she knew I'd touched it."
“It’s huge… You can’t miss it,” Harry made an excuse. Draco took his book and whacked Harry’s arm. “Sorry, it just is! Besides, you’re the one who has the obsession.”
"I miss our special place in the forest. I haven't gone back, because I just know I can't handle it. I miss our competitions and exchanging gifts at Christmas time. I miss reading the time wrong just to piss you off. I miss our picnics and swimming even though we only did that like once and you ran away half way though because you saw a grindylow.
"And do teach Harry the time of day," he called to her. "He has a little trouble comprehending that."
"Draco, that's not the point! Other people aren't going to be," he stuck out his jaw and looked away from him, and Draco let go. "Cedric shouldn't be dead!"
Because his arm burned. How could he not be Harry Potter in front of him—after he promised he wouldn't come.
Harry rolled off of him when he was, again, out of breath, gasping. He then sat up, and Draco followed his lead, and after a drawn out silence, Harry spoke softly.
Despite the Dark Lord returning, despite Draco's father being a Death Eater, they could still figure things out, so long as they were in each other's arms.
"Well I'm not saying it hasn't been..." He took another breath, thinking to himself 'just say it Harry', and his palms were sweaty. "But it hasn't been as hard as it should of been without the help of my boyfriend."
"No. You're better than perfect. You're flawed just like me, just like everyone else. And I promise you, you're not alone in this. Because I can tell you while you were in that bathroom hating your reflection, I was in the other bathroom hating mine."
"I hope you don't mean literally! That would be contradicting to the point in which we were trying to make about her not dying!"
"Is that a challenge?" Harry craned his neck to Draco, breathing heavy. Draco's eyes were switching back and forth and back and forth vigorously, and in that moment, Harry realized trying to get him to remember wouldn't do anything but push him away. But to make him laugh, and to make him smile, and to make him love again would be his last hope.
"You're awful sometimes," Harry shook his head, still smiling, and he offered a piece of candy to him. Draco took it graciously.
"I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to my boyfriend. He's in there, I know he is. I'm done talking to you, Malfoy. Okay, Draco," he took a breath, "I love it when you kiss me because you always leave me wanting more, like I can't ever get enough. I love it when I kiss your neck, you completely unravel. Or when we have sex, you always say my name right before it's over, like that's all you care about, is me. I love your hugs and your kisses on my cheek. I love how you always find ways to piss me off, but still make me smile because of it. I love how you still accepted me with open arms after the war, even though I didn't deserve it. I love how thoughtful you truly are even though it ruins your 'reputation,' towards me." Harry was crying now.
"I know you hated him, but he's still your father and although he is guilty of a lot of things, there is something you need to know. I couldn't bear to be his wife and your mother if I didn't clear my name through this. You and Harry think he was the one who erased your memory. He didn't.
Draco stopped at the sight of the blank wall- remembering the endless nights he spent behind it, working on the damned cabinet, the fire, and something else he couldn't put his tongue to. He was shaking and his throat closed as he eyed the stone quickly, examining the cracks in the cement.
"What the hell are you doing here!? Where are you going," Draco bit, spit flying against Harry's cheek. The raven-haired boy hesitated, his face not coated with hate and betrayal.
Harry tensed and he finally remembered to breathe with a sharp intake. He opened his mouth and tried talking, attempted to sit up but Draco pushed him back down gently. "Shh," he whispered. "Relax. It's okay. Relax."
She placed a hand on his cheek where it was bruised and he held in the pain it was bringing him. “What happened?”
"And then he comes here to become the Quidditch God, a game he's never played before and beats me every time, even though I've been training since I was four. He's so—erg—infuriating."
"Nothing, nothing. Just you and your inner Gryffindor." Harry rolled his eyes and snickered at the boy before furthering his story.
The guards reluctantly did, and Malfoy rushed to Dr. Williams' side. The intensive care unit was on that same floor, and Dr. Williams pulled him into a room. There, an empty gurney waited. "If you don't mind."
Harry laughed slightly as his lip quivered. “Guess you’re stuck with me,” he looked up at him. “Maybe next time you pick a boyfriend you should crosscheck their nicknames. They don’t call me The Boy Who Lived for nothing.”
Draco doubled over and grasped his cheek, letting go of Harry involuntarily. “Ouch! I get that you’re angry, but Merlin, Harry! Calm down!”
Dirt clanged to his skin, and he soaked his face with another handful of water. He rubbed his face furiously with the sight of the stones, the smell of burned skin, sound of people screaming, all turning to the vision of Harry's dead body. Instead of himself in the mirror, he saw Harry. He saw Harry and rubble and fire in the Room of Requirement. He saw his face after he kissed him. He saw him dead.
"Harry, go and clean up a bit and then meet me back here. I've laid out your clothes for you. They're on your bed," Dumbledore said.
"You don't have a dad, Harry!" Draco knew he was taking it too far. He was awaiting a punch but Harry just verbally fought back.
"You don't want me to stop," he said as he took the material with his teeth and started to pull down.
"Draco Malfoy?" Arthur held him before the door, almost as if he didn't want the family to know. "Harry tell me what's going on."
"No," Draco said. "And that's the truth. Umbridge called me into her office not five minutes before we came to see you. She told me she knew it from Chang. I didn't even know Chang was with her." Then Draco's frown continued. "I'm so sorry, if I would have known, I would have tried to stop it—I really would have." Harry looked up at him and nodded, though the sadness remained firm on his face. "It's not your fault. It's Chang's, really. Well, Umbridge probably tortured her, so really it was Umbridge."
"It's your favorite," Draco tried to stay calm for him. He knew it was going to be hard, and awkward and difficult for Harry. Who knew what he was feeling? "Eggs, bacon, I have some pumpkin juice and lots of toast."
But finally, those days did pass, and they were lovely, except Draco's nightmares, which were too much to bare—you couldn't out-potion being in the place you were tortured. He did his best to stay in places that the Death Eaters didn't touch, but there were barely any. And being with his mother was nice, but there was also some anger. Why didn't she get him out of there? And it all wasn't her fault because his father was a maniac and she was a victim of him, too, but he was a kid. It was complicated. And maybe he just felt helpless, and maybe the Manor made him bitter—all he knew was he couldn't wait for Harry to save him.
"Draco, maybe that's the problem. Maybe you should try moving on. It's not like you don't have someone-"
"Harry I don't understand. Why didn't you just go on one side of the trees. It was just a straight line! We look like idiots. Walking in between them like a snake wouldn't make a difference," Draco complained as they started down the hallway leading to a green wall, still holding hands.
"No, I want you to get help if you're sick. Harry, you can't live like this. There's no reason for you to."
Harry outstretched his arms and Draco picked him up, slinging him over his shoulder. He practically threw him on the bed, bouncing like a child. Harry laughed and shut his eyes, his last sight being of Draco. "Goodbye, my love. I'll see you at the altar."
"Harry, you're at Occlumency lessons. There shouldn't be a moment when you're caught off guard! You should be on guard at all times no matter what."
The rest of the class went by slow, and Draco found it harder to concentrate. Harry completely zoned out. When the bell rang, Draco was in a panic.
"I can't. I told you I can't, I'm sorry, I—" Fuck. This was why Draco did what he did. Harry could hear the pain in his voice, the fear in it. He couldn't handle seeing Harry captured. He couldn't handle knowing what was going to come for him because he'd seen it happen to so many others.
"Yeah," Draco bit his lip, "I was shielding a spell... fell backwards," his voice cracked. "Landed on a bunch of rocks."
"Damn you Draco, I have been," he shouted before over powering the boy and flipping them so Draco was on his back and he strattled his hips.
"No way, I want to try it." Harry grabbed the glass and took a sip, and the taste made him do the same, leaving Draco to laugh, too. "It's so bitter. And people drink this for fun?"
"Listen, I know the article said a bunch false accusations, but it was a fake I swear. Me and Hermione- we're just friends. Stupid Skeeter just caught us in the right moment." The amount of butterflies in his stomach were unbearable as he choose his words carefully.
Hermione bit her lip and they waited a few moments before turning away and going back to the common room.
“Those were my words exactly when I found out. But that changed! That really changed when I found out he didn’t want to be one. I understand you’re just as stubborn minded as me, but you need to open your eyes.”
"Why do you think this is simple?" His tone darkened. "It's not. I have more to lose than you if someone finds out about us."
"Fifth family today," Amycus smirked when Draco had to help move the bodies because most of the house-elves at the Manor had already been beaten to death.
"Oh, that's the story of your life," Harry scrunched his face and Draco kissed him one last time. As Draco turned to leave, Harry spoke once more, "Wait, Mr. Potter."
A silence passed as they lay there. Draco absentmindedly ran his fingers over Harry's chest. "A whole year."
His face pale, tears were stained on his cheeks and his t-shirt had spots everywhere. The dark circles under his eyes were evidence of his 'good' night sleep and his sickly green eyes were dull and grainy.
He wanted to curl up into a ball and cry in Harry’s arms. “You're making too big of a deal out of this."
"Order! Order!" Kingsley was slamming his gavel to the wood and the chatter among the room stopped; the two also silenced. Hermione and Ron both shook their head, but Harry went looking into the crowd directly to one man: Arthur Weasley. They all decided to come support Harry. There was a small hint of disapproval in eye that meant 'you need to shut up now!'
Yeah... right... Because if a killing lunatic came into the room, those were the rules he'd play by.
a murderer. He's selfish, he's a drama queen, he's a mess, he's human but he sure is not a murderer."
A Malfoy who never hung out with Crabbe and Goyle. A Malfoy who talked to Muggleborns and played exploding snaps with them, asked them questions about the muggle world out of pure curiosity and not with any viciousness. A Malfoy who hung out with Harry weekly. Malfoy who fed Hedwig treats, not poisoned ones, but actual ones.
!" The picture showed Harry and Draco's arms up in the air with curly smiles. It was the last page that had anything written on it, but there were still empty ones.
"Shhh," Draco held him tighter, "Calm down, you're all right." His muffled words were drowned in tears. "You're okay, you're safe now."
With a swollen throat, Harry inhaled sharply, examining the big ‘M’ on the gates of Malfoy Manor, and immediately, Hermione grabbed his hand, squeezing it. “Do you think he’s here,” he whispered to her, just enough for her, and only her, to hear it.
Then, a boom cut her off and Draco jerked to the field where two bodies lay. The band erupted, and the crowd cheered, but Draco could only feel dread.
Harry kissed him, sparks filling their veins and hearts fluttering equally. Draco couldn't think, and he didn't want to think, especially about how thin the tapestry was, how close they were to the public.
"The Dark Lord knows where I am. The Dark Mark tracks me. He knew that I left the training cellar in the Manor two minutes early one day and asked me why I was skipping out on valuable training time. He
There were a few moments of awkward silence, and Draco had to keep himself from making any noise as Harry unbuttoned him and pulled back his underwear. Then Harry put Draco's tip in his mouth.
Draco was silent for a bit. "I don't mind," he said, leaning in closer so he could feel Harry's breaths.
"I don't want to put anyone in danger. I'd rather be alone." Then Harry thought more. "Are you sure?"
"You go," Harry said, looking away, unable to keep from blushing, "I need to take care of something."
In Harry's room, they gave each other one last great hug. Draco smiled down at him when they let go, but Harry grabbed Draco's face and kissed him. Hard. Making sure he didn't regret not doing so. "Thank you for a great break."
But Harry still frowned. He knew the universe could find different ways to keep them apart other than Azkaban. "It's not that simple, I... you'll see."
The words made bufferflies run through Harry's entire body, and so he sped up, listening for indications of any pain from Draco, but it was only moans and quick breathing.
Harry yawned and stretched, opening his eyes to find Draco, blurry, in front of him. "What are you doing here?" Then Harry's face fell, remembering how he hadn't even cared about being there with him, too tied up with Umbridge and Voldemort instead of enjoying the moment. "Oh my God, we're on a date. I fell asleep on our date."
"I promise you on your death bed if I ever meet the Dursley's I will hex their micro-balls off. You're lucky I don't come home with you, hide in your trunk. They'd all be dead within minutes."
"But I'm completely changing my identity, Harry, we both are. It's not going to be 'Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy,' it's going to be 'The Potter's' or 'Harry and Draco Potter.' It's going to be 'us' or 'them' or 'those two.'"
Harry grit his teeth. "You're not here to teach Defense. You're here to make sure that he gets locked up so that you don't lose your stupid record. You don't care about justice."
Harry welcomed him in the shower after that. They cuddled on the couch instead of sat on the opposite ends of it. Instead being halfway out the door, Draco put Harry up against it, just so he could kiss him deeper. They made it to a bed when the had sex, and it wasn't just sex anymore, it was love. Passionate, pure, forgivable love.
Draco coughed again. "Sick from sucking too much cock," he tried to keep from laughing, but then he snorted and chuckled hard, but he had to grip his abdomen because the muscle ripped and the soreness burned.
"I remember laughing," he said after a bit. "And I remember... you were... humiliated? Yeah. You looked like you wanted to throw up."
"I doubt that-" Draco tried to speak but Harry just kept rambling and rambling on about his favorite things and his fears and his hopes and dreams, and within each thing Harry would kiss him, sometimes on the lips, sometimes not. Draco felt his tears.
Harry frowned. "I don't feel like one. I don't think I've ever felt like one. Not a proper one. I don't even know what it feels like."
“Alright,” Harry reached in his pocket, pulling out his wand. “Ready?” Draco nodded his head, and without speaking the spell, Harry casted it, and Draco immediately fell to the floor in heart wrenching sobs. “Draco,” Harry shouted, falling next to him as he dropped his wand. He didn’t expect it to be that bad, more like a few tears and a pale face.
It was still darkness that covered the land. The candles had been blown out, probably by Draco, the table was gone, everything but the blanket he was just laying on. It truely was a beautiful place. The stars were burning out yet again, the moon was relfected on the water and was slowly saying goodbye, the grass was.. well, grass, the leaves dead, ready to be reborn, just as Harry wished he could be.
"For a while I didn't think that it affected me at all and I just, though, whatever, but especially with Umbridge... I'm fucked up." Draco tilted his head. "I... I'm sorry... I'm trying to figure out which part is the least bad."
"Your son is a genius, Lucius. Given me enough knowledge to make up for some of your inadequacy. You're lucky I even allow you in this house." The Dark Lord turned back to Draco. "Do you know if he's training?"
Astoria got up and sat with her friends. Once gone, Draco immediately frowned and thought of Harry. At least they could be alone until Valentines Day, and even then he could have a diversion.
"It's your choice, not mine." Harry's heart melted. He reached down and kissed his lips. "What was that for?"
"I don't think I've ever seen two people skip that many classes," Ginny laughed, "But then again, I don't think I've ever seen two people so in love with each other either."
He must've wanted treatment, too? Maybe he'd gotten bad, too? Quite frankly, with how bad everything had been at the Manor for quite some time living in a torture chamber. It wouldn't surprise him if he had a mental breakdown, though he just couldn't quite recall it.
As he made it to the first landing, he found a door, the letters SB painted on them. Draco opened it and stepped over clutter to bring Harry to a large bed.
Draco paused, thinking. He was making this worse, so much worse on Harry. It really wasn't his fault. Snape shouldn't have gotten so personal to him. And how were they even supposed to know the Dark Lord would use Occlumency on him. Harry didn't even know what Occlumency was before he had those nightmares.
"That was so hot," Harry gasped, his hair disarrayed and sweaty. "Fuck! Draco! Please! As hard as you can."
"I'm telling you, he has experience with Dark Wizards and a good resume. A good background check. We can trust he's not a danger."
"Just reaching your adolescence, I see," he paused yet again and it made Draco feel sick. "You're a strapping young man, Draco. Tell me how all the girls are falling over you."
"You can go," Draco said, and Hughs took the opportunity, running towards the rest of the first years.
Harry encased him again, this time, fitting as much as he possibly could and then some, and Draco fisted the sheets next to him, Harry watching his reaction. He breathed heavy, his blonde hair in disarray complimenting in a blush along his face. It was when Harry bobbed his head up and down faster when Draco started to shout and moan, and then his tongue twisted around his shaft and he was crying Harry's name. The next stroke and Harry had him completely in his him mouth and Draco felt his tip hit the back of Harry's throat.
At the sight of him, Harry gasped, and gasped loudly on accident, leaving the entire room to stare at him, and Bellatrix started laughing.
Then, two figures came down, hunched over and clinging to each other. They shook as they walked, and as they got closer, Draco matched their hair and complexion to Matthew's. McGonagall rushed to them and hugged them.
"Brilliant Pansy! Perfect timing! He won't even be able to come and talk to me because he'll be so scared that i'll make out with him!!" Pansy was on the floor while Draco sat against a shelf.
Draco smiled, because he couldn't help it as he relived the memory. "Like it was a dream. So much disbelief. I didn't think I'd be alive to see it happen, truly. And the fact that Harry was, too. It was odd, because I'd been fighting for that moment for two years but I never expected it to come."
"After your discharge, you'll still need to be under doctor supervision, which we will transfer over duties to Madam Pomfrey. She will guide you through the medical side of your recovery, check your blood levels, and give you clearance.
“We were snogging,” he whispered, but Harry heard him and hit his arm, giving him a firm glare. Draco just laughed as well as the kids.
"Oh come on, guys, really," Ron boasted. "I understand that you're out to all your friends, but can we please keep the sex talk to a minimum."
And it angered Harry, because deep down, he knew she was right, but ignorance is bliss and he didn't want to think about him changing again. "We've been dating for two years. I think I know him a little better than you do."
She took a clipboard from the wall. "Yes, that is Harry Potter." Draco grabbed it from her. "Hey! You can't see that!"
"That means, no matter what, if I'm being crucioed in front of you, if I'm being set on fire, if Nagini is eating me in front of you, you will not try to stop it."
"I don't even want to think about it. He's not going back there," at least not if Harry had anything to do with it.
"I'm sad I didn't tell him." But then Harry blushed. "So you're saying you were there when we made out?"
"Mmm," Harry tilted his head so the veins of his throat were easily accessible. "But seriously, what about my friends?"
"Please Harry! It's one week! One whole week without making love with you," Draco could feel Harry responding to him as he leaned against his neck, begging while he licked his ear.
"So apparently my mother was the one to give me an abstinence ring, which literally suppressed any urges I had to have sex. I thought Father was behind it but she's very
"The Yule Ball. Hermione helped me with my hair and I... reacted like this. I dunno, I've never been touched there before, but when she did it... it feels so good."
Draco bit his lip as Harry started to move, his hand up and down so gently, it was if Draco couldn't even feel it, although he could, and it felt so strange as if it was a tease. Heat pooled in his stomach. "Harder," Draco said. "Do it how you do yours." Harry did what he was told, gripping it much harder, in fact, much too hard and Draco yelped. "Fuck! Is yours made of iron or something," he bit.
"Because I was used my entire life, now that the war is over, it makes me feel like I have no reason to be here. It makes me feel like I wasn't strong, that I was just surviving. It has just... destroyed my entire identity of myself. I'm not strong. I'm not a Gryffindor, which is so stupid because I worshiped being one for the longest time. Dumbledore was a Gryffindor. He petted me for being one. He made me feel brave and important for being one, but really, he was just grooming me to die, and now here we are. All I've asked was to have Draco, and I can't. I'm just so... angry. I'm so fucking angry, I'm so... I have so many emotions, I wouldn't even be able to tell you them, because if I focus on being actionable and doing something to help him and nothing I'm doing is helping him at all, and it's so fucking
"I've missed you so much," Draco's voice cracked. He did his best not to show the helplessness, sadness, and loneliness that he'd been feeling.
Draco felt along Harry's body. They laid back so much that their heads barely rested above the water, and Draco's hip poked out, bubbles surrounding it. Harry tangled their legs and reached to drag his fingers up Draco's thigh, trailing them with bubbles that ran along Draco's stretch marks. "Shove off," he rolled his eyes.
"Erm, I guess it depends. There isn't just one way for a bond like that to form.. You'd have to talk to someone who specializes in it. Really, we all have bonds with each other, friendship bonds, family bonds. Harry, your bond with your mother is what protected you from Voldemort. A soulmate bond is unique. For Molly and I, it started as a friendship bond and developed over time. We met at Hogwarts, too. One potions class, I got a potion wrong and she go me out of the way before it exploded. We've been all for each other ever since."
"She's bloody worse than them and they locked me in a god damn cupboard and starved me for God's sake! She's the most-"
Their eyes connected in the mirror, and after realizing it, Ron did the only logical thing he could: he threw the toothbrush in the toilet and flushed it.
"Yeah." He rocked his hips to meet Draco's rhythm slightly, and then Draco spread his fingers, prepping him the best he could. And in fact it felt very good after the burn subsided. However, it wasn't enough for Harry. He wanted to be connected to Draco; he wanted to be filled with Draco, as close as possible to him, encasing him, loving him. "Not enough. Need you," he strained. "Want you."
"He's too good for you," and "he could do so much better," appeared on the page, and Draco couldn't tell if it was his quill or his subconscious.
"I always do three. I tried four once but it was too much at the time and I haven't worked my way up yet. Three's comfortable."
He dressed himself, too, and then got into bed with Harry, and he wrapped one arm tightly around his waist, and the other he bent to make a pillow for Harry's head. He buried his face into the raven hair and closed his eyes.
Harry looked between his eyes. His own were sore and puffy and screaming red. He choked. "He looked through my head. I couldn't stop him."
Harry sat in his compartment along with Ron and Hermione, itching to see Draco again. Something else had been on his mind besides their upcoming workload, it being: why was he following death eaters in Nocturn Alley, and why was he acting so weird.
"Harry." The words were a whisper as Draco laid his eyes on him. Harry immediately perked up, his hands sweating and heart beating through this chest. "It's you! I can't believe it's you."
"I promise." She nodded, and then she walked back to him, as if to give him another hug, but instead, she wound her fist and punched him square in the face, forcing him to stagger backwards.
Draco accepted more kisses, which were sweet and lovely, but there was also a part to him that was absolutely terrified. Harry's friends were great to Harry.
"I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't, I swear! But he didn't listen to me. I loved him, Hermione, I still do. I always will. "
"Oi," Draco said, offended. He slapped Harry's arse, making Harry jump and then laugh. "Do you want me to fuck you or not?"
"How'd you do it," Draco asked, trying to get his cheeks to stop blushing. "Win? The potion. You suck arse at potions."
Ron and Hermione tried, and they earned credit for that, but neither of them knew what it was like to be in love with Draco, and therefore what the loss felt like.
It was the apprehension that they were able to touch each other for the first time, that they would be the only ones to do this to the other. After tonight, they would never be able to be spoiled again for the first time. They weren't looking for perfection, oh no, but for each other: for the reality, for the memories, for the love and compassion they truly had for each other.
"That could be a good thing," she said, "keeps you sane. Look at your father, look at Bellatrix. They'd do anything for You-Know-Who."
"Excuse me," he looked as if he were to kill him. "Selfish? Do you know how hard we've had to work to be together? Years of torture and war and fighting and memory lost of Merlin's sake and you think you can saunter over here and tell me I'm being selfish because my fiancé, my
She left him standing in the middle of the hallway, calling her name. He stood there with a confused expression on his face, and he immediately started fixing his hair.
His stomach dropped, and he blushed furiously. Please don't be Harry, please don't be Harry. "Pansy, what the hell!"
Pansy swallowed. "No. I don't think so. I think the magic knows. Does your magic feel any different?"
Blood dripped out of his mouth and the wounds split more and more, blood pouring out of them, and then Draco realized they were in the shape of snake bites. "No, Harry! No no no!"
"So, in theory, if I had one of these call things, I could talk to you when you're in your common room and I'm in mine?"
He released when he was out of breath, staring down at a flushed Harry, his cheeks a deep red. Harry was dizzy and couldn't form any speech, breathing heavy.
Draco slapped his abdomen and in return, Harry slapped his arse. "If liking fucking you makes me a slut, I'll happily change my middle name to Slut. Draco Slut Malfoy and Horny Potter, what the power couple." They both laughed. "Do you want to know how big of a slut I am?"
"W-What about a lifetime together, what about how happy we were together? I want to give you that, I want to give you peace."
It was two a.m. when the demons were hunting and stalking, he felt Harry shift and a squeak escaped his throat. The boy opened his eyes and Draco watched him do so. Harry, upon looking at him, smiled immediately.
"It's not like you're a saint either! Next Friday the 13th, Trewalney is probably going to have a heart attack!"
"I think that... the memory loss was an after-affect of the war, like a last try to rip us apart, in the most brutal way. I don't see it as something that comes from the next phase of our lives, if that makes sense. I think we're in between this really big transition from the past eighteen years to what the rest of our lives will be."
"The attack was fine. Scared me a bit but I could handle it." Harry licked his lip. "Have you seen the papers?"
"They could be following you. They could be following us right now! They could kidnap you. They could disarm you and hunt you—"
"Would you rather me assign the chapter for her for homework and have her running and crying to me? 'Father's a death eater, how could you do this to us?'"
When Harry opens the locket, a horcrux form of Draco comes out and taunts him in an emotionally abusive way, which Harry has a severe reaction to.
Harry, on the other side of the wall, slid down the door, his knees giving way. He hyperventilated and sobbed and wept and tried to get the image of Draco's arm out of mind but it was burned into it.
"That's bollocks. You know the answer. You want me to tell you you're unattractive so the voice in your head can say 'I told you so' even though it's a liar. So it can take it and run with it and keep making you miserable because that's what it does to survive. And that voice isn't you, it's just good at convincing you, and you can't blame yourself for being convinced because who else has some strange voice in their brain?"
"Draco," he shouted, putting his hand to the wall, but his own voice came muffled. He banged on it several times. "Draco, it's me, let me in! Draco, no!"
Draco swallowed, and relaxed. He sat down across from him, in fact a little farther away. "No," he said softly. "I don't know how you feel right now. It's bloody hard to figure it out! Hell, you probably don't even know what you're feeling."
Except they lived in a world where paradise seldom existed. Deep down, they knew it would end at one point.
She didn't answer his question, but brought up a topic he wasn't expecting. "What did it feel like when he kissed you?"
"You're so dirty," Harry finally said, wiping at smudge marks over his chin and forehead. The dust stuck to dried tears on his cheek.
"Nothing, it's just that I'm surprised you haven't exploded yet since you actually apologized, or I'm waiting for the joke."
"I'll never forgive you for any of this." Harry let out a sound, but his mouth couldn't physically move. The look of heartbreak ripped apart his face. "I'm serious."
Draco rolled his eyes and laughed to himself, pulling on the jacket. It was oh-so warm and smelled like Harry. He continued to look at the spot where Harry just left until he said aloud:
"Should and do are two different words." Harry buried his head deeper into Draco's neck, enjoying his smell of vanilla and warmth of skin. Draco felt his heart ping with sadness. He wanted to yell and scream because Merlin did it hurt to see Harry like this. "I'm sorry," he said again.
"Harry, I'm sure they would have cared for you," Draco wrapped his arms around him from behind, following the image shown in the reflection he was seeing right now.
Draco stood on his knees, getting closer to the laying down Gryffindor, attempting to look intimidated.
"Oh he was. I was bloody terrified. I thought I was going to puke on his shoes the whole time. I think he saw that."
He moved his head to the side, looking of into the distance, Draco following his head curiously to find out what the boy was looking at. Harry took the opportunity to flip them for the last time.
He froze completely, and felt the blood rush from his face. He unfolded the paper to see a gigantic picture of him and Draco making out. His eyes widened as he looked up to see every face in the room staring at him with disgust. He turned to Pumblechook, who had the most malicious smirk on his face.
The door to the Common Room opened, and Lavender came skipping in, dragging Ron from behind. A snitch followed them. "Mate," Ron said, "someone wants your attention."
"I-I don't know, I just felt like it," Draco answered softly, but shaky. "Did I do something wrong?"
"Why'd you let her do that," he barley said, his voice cracking. "I knew you loved her!" His voice raised.
But still, she looked at him with hate, her bottom lip quivering as she took more steps back, shaking her head.
"You being with me will make it special. Not having to worry about anything but doing this will make it the best birthday I've ever had."
"Soon." Draco looked up at him, smiled, and licked his lip as he opened the third. "Uric the Oddball.
"It's your first day. It's the worst," Draco said, more weak this time. Because he didn't anticipate how hard it would be to see him recover—he didn't anticipate anything. He woke up and his reality was completely twisted, so much so he felt uneasy.
"Then erase your memory. You won't even know you did. You'll wake up in the hospital free of me." But tears clouded Harry's eyes as he struggled to speak. "I really... don't want to be here, to be honest with you. You can let me go if you want to. I'd be okay with it."
"The point of this program is to get you more accustomed to the normal world following the trauma you've endured. We'll have classes for you tomorrow, but in the mean time, here is a journal you can write your thoughts in. Dinner will be coming in the next hour or so. Do you have any questions?"
"Don't ever talk about me being a ferret ever again." Draco held his chest, trying not to think about it.
"Let me offer the alternative. If you don't take care of yourself, when Mr. Malfoy recovers, you're still going to be sick. And it would be unfortunate if you didn't make it long enough to see that happen. The path you are on leads to a very dark place and a very abrupt end. You have to take care of yourself first. And you might think that's a selfish thing to do, it's not. You have to work on getting better. You can't let yourself continue to suffer. All of your professors are worried about you, including myself."
"He made me try a Muggle sandwich and I think he poisoned it because I can't stop thinking about him."
"When?" All of a sudden footsteps could be heard around the corridor. They both scurried to get up and began to walk in the other direction.
Draco shook his head no, his features shrinking to one of such deep sadness, Harry thought he were to start crying.
And when he did fall asleep due to exhaustion, pictures of Dumbledore and Voldemort consumed his mind and he would wake up in a cold sweat. The Dark Lord threatening, torturing, killing Harry. Harry under all three unforgivables, one after the other, physically abused, kicked, beat, and no matter how many times Draco said
Draco just shook his head, and was about to say something, but there was a loud bang downstairs which interrupted their thought process.
But when Harry appeared, he only saw a blurry wall of different shades of darkness, the only differentiator being a small sight of white. Draco's hair.
"If you forget my condition when you found me," he almost whispered. And then he took a moment to inhale and exhale, take a few moments to just enjoy Harry in his arms, even if he was mad. A pair of tears left his ducts once more and he let go of Harry a second to wipe his eyes, just so Harry knew he was crying too. "I think you're strong enough to break in front of me."
The small boy met his eyes, and they widened. He darted in the other direction, and Draco followed. Draco would have reached him just by walking as Hugh's tiny legs sprinted, but Draco had a light jog to catch up with him. He cornered him to keep him from running.
He knew he had to get Draco back the entire time during his memory loss, but he'd forgotten how much fun it was to be with him, and it'd been so long since he'd smiled about it.
of all people? Merlin, at least get me a pure-blooded hottie. Potter's so awkward and weird and has the hero complex. Gross. Besides, I can't be gay. My father would kill me."
Draco burst out into laughter and so did Harry—the first time Draco had in months, the first time together in weeks.
Harry started cracking open the memory books, sitting away from where he and Draco had their study date just because it distracted him, however he would look over his shoulder for some motivation when his eyes wanted to give out on him.
He always debated whether or not these calls were better than when he went on missions for the Dark Lord. Either way, he had to hurt people, break the law. But at least out there, he moreso watched the torture of people instead of did it himself. And he hadn't had the order to kill anyone yet.
"Likewise." Draco realized as he kissed Harry's cheek and started on his path back to the castle that this was a special kind of torture. The kind that hurt worse than any unforgivable that ever existed. This hurt like the flames at hell. It hurt like freezing in ice. It hurt like being choked with the bare hands of his lover.
Harry had to stay at the Weasley's. Because in between panic attacks and bouts of deep, icy depression, Harry could see the ghosts of their past selves, spinning around corners and laughing in the kitchen, sharing kisses and too many hugs to count, giving each other such superlative pleasure. He could still smell Draco in the sheets until he couldn't. He could feel his hands over his skin until he couldn't. He could remember the comfort Draco's touch gave him until he couldn't.
"He trusts you more than anyone on our side. Did you see his face when he saw you?" Did you see mine? "He's still in love with you. Act as though your on his side," I am, "and he will come with you voluntarily. This war will be over, less wizards and witches will die. He will be dead. It's up to you. Understand?"
He sobbed because he didn't remember what relief felt like until now. He sobbed because the relief itself was violent and too much to handle. He sobbed because he thought he'd never see his boyfriend as his boyfriend ever again.
"It's what you had to do. I know how hard your father is on you. I saw the memory. You were just doing what you needed to so he wouldn't have called Tom Riddle on you. It's not your fault. And I'm glad you're alive to deal with it. We'll think of something."
"Well, I acted like how I wanted to look at you and I tried looking attractive and nice and I hated it. I didn't feel... I don't feel like I'm sexy at all," Harry frowned. "To anyone, not just you."
Harry kissed the top of Draco's hands and then let go, putting them back on Draco's hips, but before he could move anymore, the bell rang.
"Umm I don't... I don't really know," Draco stuttered, "I mean I've never actually smiled before, besides smirking. I mean, I imagine when I was a kid I may have laughed a little, but, not much anymore. I'm not good, am I?" He never liked saying it although it was true. He could only imagine how he looked when he attempted to grin.
"It was difficult. Really difficult. In fact, we had our first real kiss hiding from you two. By the way, Weasley, thank you for the tip on the stroking him behind his ear. It helped a lot. It calmed him down when he had nightmares."
"I love you, too." He responded, a look of longing in his eyes. Then, Harry walked to the door and before his hand touched the handle, he was called back in.
"Draco," he gasped, the sheer feeling of it, despite the time they'd shared together, foreign and luxurious.
Then they'd go change together, and Draco would complain about the clothes he had to wear, and Harry would bribe him with kisses; to the kitchen they would go after that, and then things went down hill after an hour or so.
Dean looked at Seamus a certain way, and then said, "Everyone has a huge crush on Harry," as if to make Seamus jealous, too, but little did they know Draco was the most jealous out of anyone.
Harry showed him their trip to Hogwarts, and Draco let out a violent gasp when he heard himself say Mudblood. "That's not me. Merlin, that's not me."
"But they were," Blaise chipped in. "Draco was devastated and made us promise not to tell you. He figured he could get out of the marriage before you even found out."
"Snape, oh my god, Snape! I didn't want him dead, I just... I didn't want him dead! I didn't want any of them dead!" He grabbed the sides of his head, pulling on his head, ripping out his hair.
"Yes, thank you, your honor." Pumblechook stood and walked in the middle of the room. "You said you were forced to get the Dark Mark."
The girl worked her way though the labyrinth of Hogwarts, following the hallways. The curious brown eyed girl heard two pairs of feet running her way. Wondering who it would be, she watched two boys round the corner, but not just any boys, but a certain Slytherin and a courageous Gryffindor. Hermione was about to pull off the cloak until she saw joined hands between the two. She involuntarily let out a gasp and ran behind the metal amor displayed In a shallow alcove.
"It's been a month and ever since you two came out, I swear you haven't been apart," Pansy crossed her arms.
“I’ll take it,” he says, smashing his lips to Harry’s as their skins began to numb enough to move. His lips were warmer than any temperature they were surrounded by but Draco had been inside Harry’s mouth extensively: he knew how hot it was supposed to be.
Kingsley glared at them both before continuing on, causing a few to laugh. "And do you, Draco take this... insane man to be your wedded husband?"
The chairs drenched in black and silver stood in rows and were filled with only the closest family and friends; in fact there weren't many people there at all. No reporters, oh no, they kept it in secret; just the photographer was the only one outside of immediate family and friends. Harry's side had more, however not by much. The Weasleys, which two of them were standing up next to him, filled all of the first row, and then behind them were all the members of the DA, which filled up most of the seats after. Finally, his favorite teachers were in the back including McGonagall, as well as Hagrid, whom was taking up three seats.
all of these people were dead, but did he have to live in that reality all day, every day, as his soul withered? Or could he save himself just enough to carry on a bit more?
"I'm just so scared something will happen to you again. Or you know what... I'm scared it'll happen to
“I know I am. But I’m just… I don’t know who did this Harry. What if they strike again? What if its a classmate or a teacher?”
"HARRY!" But the Gryffindor was already in a fit. Draco tried to wake him up by shaking his shoulders, screaming his name, everything! Fear enveloped him and he couldn't think of anything but trying to save him.
Harry moved up to his mouth and kissed it gently. Draco started sucking on his lower lip, and started moving them more. Harry licked his bottom lip and Draco smiled.
"Some small talk," he smirked. But Draco knew he would never be able to look at it the same way again, like most things that Potter had shown him. "What kind of literature do you read?"
"Yeah... right, just forget it." Draco got up and grabbed his broom and a snitch that he brought along. "Ready to play?"
"Yes... but not intentionally... well, yes, intentionally. It was trying to kill me. She had her teeth, I had my sword. It could have gone either way." Draco wanted to kiss his nose, the way he said it, but he refrained from it. "Want me to show you where? It's the best part."
"Draco, shh," Harry cooed, stroking his cheek. He kissed his shoulder, but it wasn't enough. Nothing was enough. Draco still sobbed. "Shh, I'm okay."
"Alright, you've caught us," Draco surrendered as Harry eyed him, "We've been dating since fourth year. Every Friday night we would skip dinner and go to the lake and at midnight we would have study dates and we play quidditch on weekends, but of course I always let him win to be the incredible boyfriend I am," Draco was using a snarky and sarcastic tone, biting at them, "I bring him flowers and he gives me chocolates and we sneak into the prefects bathroom to have sex, and in fact, we didn't even have detention for disrespecting Pumblechook, we were in the Room of Requirement having sex as well. And indeed he proposed to me just a few weeks ago, and I said yes. See, here's the ring." Draco showed him his ring, but during his speech, he had pulled off Harry's band and pocketed it in case they examined the matching jewelry.
"Draco," Harry said sternly, "Hide. It's my last wish for you is to live through this war, and love someone. I want you to be happy!"
"Then whose fault is it?" Janet was quite for a while and Draco filled the silence. "Whoever erased my memory. My father never wanted us together. He'd do anything. And here we are, being torn apart again. Having to fight with everything we have again despite being absolutely exhausted." Draco sniffed again and wiped his eyes. "So now what? In dealing with the aftermath? I don't want to say the wrong thing. I don't want to—I don't want to make him worse."
"Let me go! Leave me alone! I didn't do it!" Draco screamed as a first resort to freedom, but the hand wrapping around his stomach was now covering his mouth.
"Thank you, Draco," Molly smiled sincerely, but he could see the pain in her eyes. "We appreciate it."
"Oh no, you hated me because I got the Mark. Just because I almost did murder people, that's not why you hated me. You hated me because I got a tattoo on my arm that you didn't like. So tell me. Would it have mattered if I told you in the beginning or in the end? Tell me, Harry, was I clever to wait?"
"Dear Scarface," she read in a pompous tone as Harry snatched it back, "is that what you call each other? You don't have real nicknames like baby or babe?"
"Too bad." Before Draco could say anything, a hand forcefully grabbed his wrist and he was dragged out the door without a chance to think about it.
"Harry, I'm so sorry," he said, and he started crying again as well. "I'm so so sorry! I love you so much! So much!"
"I dunno," Potter said. "It looked pretty bad before our date, but when I checked it this morning, it was almost healed. Maybe when you touched it, your Malfoy Charm fixed me."
"What, when we fight? I hate it. I hate it so much. It's the worst feeling in the world. It just makes my heart crack when I see his face sometimes. Last year we had a fight over fighting and what was too far or not. Quidditch this past year was one of those examples. And calling you two by blood. But like I said I don't want to tell too much."
"This one's my mother's." He opened the box, revealing the shiny silver chain and blue pendant. He tried his best to keep his voice from shaking. He grabbed the other box but didn't open it. "This is yours, which you're not opening until Christmas. Got it? If it was me, there wouldn't be two boxes here, only one." He didn't cringe at the lie, he thrived in it.
“Hey shh, it’s okay. Everything’s okay now, you’re not going to hurt me.” Harry laced him into a hug. “Besides, it was worth it.”
"Hug him goodbye? Hug him goodbye! Am I a Hufflepuff, Pansy! Have you no sense of Gryffindor-Slytherin Rivalry?"
Harry pulled off Draco's briefs, his erection achingly hard. If Harry stroked him, he'd have an orgasm with barely any effort.
"There was always something more there than hate. I just didn't know it. And I was angry about it." Something deep in Draco's chest pulled at him violently. Almost as if it was a truth. Y
It had to have been hours he walked, nearly exhausted from the returning image of Harry dying over and over with it being his fault. Draco kept down his nausea as best he could, and by the time he found the cabinet, he just wanted to go to bed.
Harry gave him one more kiss before Draco ducked under the cloak and said the password, disappearing into the common room.
"It's like taking a pair of scissors to a string for me. I can do either. It's up to the both of you. We'll let you discuss. We'll draw up the consent form. Mr. Potter, regardless, you'll have to be put into a coma for the next few days for whichever surgery you want to prepare for, if you even want to have surgery. Do either of you have any more questions?"
Harry backed off of him. "It's dangerous to be around me. We shouldn't do this. I'm putting you in danger just by thinking about you."
Draco wanted to reply but his arm worsened and the back of his eyes suddenly watered. He turned away from Harry so that he couldn't see him. Harry crawled behind him and wrapped and arm around his waist.
Harry looked around the campfire. Everyone was chatting and laughing, despite the losses. Everyone was comfortable. Draco and his friends got along.
Two weeks later, they decided to have their first meeting post-Snape. At eight-thirty, Draco went to his room to shower and get dressed for his date with Harry. At eight-fifty, Blaise came to the door and Draco opened it.
"I wanted to make you breakfast, and like you said last night when you made dinner, practice makes perfect," Draco crossed his arms. "Cook really is easy. It's like potions."
Harry couldn't help but smile and kiss him hard before trailing his fingertips under the hem of it and pushing it up and off of him, along with his last long sleeve shirt.
"Harry, what's a gun," Draco asked as they went to the Floo so the family heard the innocent question (and laughed about it).
“I know you do,” Draco tucked Harry in and wrapped his arms around him, Harry’s bum fitting into the curve of his hips.
Draco didn't want to wake Harry, but he did want Harry's input, and it would be the only possible time to have it since in the morning, the blonde was due to leave before Harry even woke up.
"I-I have no idea. Kingsley broke in and kidnapped him and he was arrested, but I went to his hearing and got him out. And afterward, I was going to take him home, and he pushed me away and said that he had no idea why I'd want to be near him. He doesn't remember a thing. Something really
"Good, you're still here," Draco said, a small box in his hands as he leaned against the opposite side of the wall Harry was against. "I want you to hear me out, okay?"
"No," Harry said. And then he blinked. "I dunno, really. I guess people feel peace. I don't think I ever have. But I guess everyone I've been to has been during the war, so I always thought the world is getting less safe. The world is getting better, but ours isn't."
Harry kissed him back longer than Draco expected, and in fact pulled back slightly to see if Harry would follow his lips, which he did.
"Every second of me hurting is completely and wholly worth it, Draco. Every heart break, every screw up, every bump in the road, makes me love you each and every bit more. I love you. You love me. Nothing has changed since you proposed to me, just we've grown, as people, as friends, as lovers."
She had to admit, she'd never seen him this broken, let alone broken at all. Sure, when Sirius died, he cried and yelled, but he'd run out before it went past that. And even when he found out about the Mark, he'd cried, but she never saw him do more than cry.
"I think so," Draco said incredulously, rolling over and laying down along the length of it. The springs were broken, and Draco couldn't stop laughing, observing Harry as he sorted through a wardrobe full of clothing. He watched the move of his back muscles, the rips tightening and relaxing. "You sure we can't stay naked?"
“Right! Anyway, so we just kept dating throughout the year…” Harry tried to think of the next event.
"Yes, very well. It's past your bedtimes. If all partners would leave to go back to their dorms. Granger, Parkinson, out."
"Love," Draco moaned as Harry found his way to his crack, and dragged finger around his hole. "Mmm.."
"Harry, that was over a year ago. If I still hated you for it, I wouldn't be here. And it's not like I was a saint either. I was going to use an unforgivable on you," he cried. "Imagine how that would have been!"
"No-nothing I'm... I'm fine." But Hermione wasn't dumb. She could see right through him, "really," he tried to encourage but it ended up making the situation worse. Hermione raised an eyebrow.
Draco reached behind his back and handed Harry a flat object, wrapped in silver and green. The Gryffindor's eyebrow raised as he questioned what it is.
"Well I figured since our contract says we must be married by the end of the year, might as well get it done with, right?"
"Oh Harry! Come out come out wherever you are!" Harry prepared to go into battle, his heart beating faster. He could hear his footsteps getting closer and closer and when they almost reached their destination Harry stood and hit Draco's body dead on.
"Really? You think so?" Harry nodded. "Well, I hope you like tomorrow's. It'll be the greatest of them all."
Draco moved closer to the beads to see if he could actually tell the events, but once he could almost touch them with his face, they disappeared.
Pansy, mouth agape, stared Draco down. "I actually have a use besides seduce arrogant pigs like you," she scoffed. "I won't do it."
But that doesn't matter, because you could put any thought into my mind. You could tell me you never loved me and this was all just a game the entire time, but I could never stop loving you so deeply that even with I'm with you, I feel as though I'm being starved to the point of famine. It almost hurts to be with you rather apart from you because I know no matter what we do; I could never get tired of you.
Harry stayed silent, in fact, he stopped breathing. Draco closed his eyes for a few seconds, breathing, and he swallowed. When he opened them, he saw Harry's sad sad eyes glaring at him, his lips slightly parted in devastation. He put both his hands on Harry's cheeks, stroking his cheekbones.
Harry bit his lip and moaned, trying to forget, letting his mind go blank, because Draco was inside of him, loving him no matter what he said to it. And it felt bloody lovely.
"I pretended to be asleep. I was frozen. I couldn't move. You can't move when you wake up to something like that." Tears rolled down her face as she took several moments to let overwhelming grief pass. "He got my kids flowers from our garden and then he cried over them. Another man came. Severus Snape, I believe. And he started yelling at Mr. Malfoy, telling him to hide the evidence in a creek by our house but he wouldn't move away from them and he refused to do it. He was screaming, 'I promised, I promised.' He argued with Severus Snape until Snape apparated him out of my house and I was left with my family who were all gone."
"I have some potions for you to take daily to help it out. There are some on the side table I suggest you take."
"Because I wasn't on holiday," he snapped, a foul look overcoming his face, the one he used when he was around Death Eaters. "I was in a training camp learning how to torture and manipulate people every day. Hope you had a lovely time in Germany. I had a wand at my neck for hours on end. I had nightmares every night. This thing on my arm is a parasite. It's like I feel a snake right over my shoulder at all times. No wonder Harry almost went mad last year. His anger was justified if he felt anything like this."
The couple makes up and spends a night in the room of requirement together after Draco apologizes. In fear of dying over Christmas break, Draco offers to have sex but they cannot really do much because his arm starts to bleed profusely to the point there is blood on the sheets.
"Then you play it off laughing. No one would believe it, I don't even think Potter would. You two are sworn enemies and if someone saw you flirting or whatever, and they told someone, no one would ever think of it to be true," Goyle said as if he thought it through before this entire conversation.
“Who have you told,” Harry asked, causing Draco to smile immediately. They decided not to hold hands, just in case any unwanted eyes were looking, but they didn’t mind bumping shoulders or winking openly.
"It's been a while, so it was worse." Harry wiped his hair back and then rubbed his face. "I just want them to be over with."
"Erm..." Draco swallowed, and then he remembered from watching Harry's memories, Harry bought her engagement ring. "Actually, I was going to surprise you. Hold on."
"I'm starving," Draco begged for food. Harry grabbed the ham sandwiches that were in the basket, along with strawberries and treacle tarts. "How'd you know my favorite foods?"
He squeezed her one more time before letting go. She rubbed his arm and finally handed Harry the earrings.
"Shhh, Harry! Control, Harry, control!" He lunged at Harry's hands an pulled them away from his head, holding them out with great force, both their arms fighting to power over the other.
"Hm?" Harry analyzed him. "Wait, you're really upset about me assuming you'd be recruited? That you'd be a Death Eater."
"Are you mad? It's the middle of October, I'm expecting the snow to come soon, and you want to go swimming in the lake?"
Draco grabbed Harry's hand and laced them together. Immediately Harry began to calm down a bit. For one, he wasn't screaming as bad, more like a painful moan. It took a few more minutes and the flashbacks were done. Harry, however, looked like a human manifestation of death.
"And if anyone so much as," Draco leaned down, gracing his lips against Harry's delicately, "I swear to Salazar himself, I will murder them." Harry laughed. "You think I'm joking?"
They both walked up to the castle in their invisibility cloak before sunrise, after all the guards had left and their only worry lay with beasts from the forest attacking them. They ended up safely in Grimmuald Place, Harry having to shower for another round.
"Because... you promised me last year. You promised me you would always be my safety, and if you became a death eater," Harry ran his fingers in his hair, "I wouldn't be safe anymore no matter who you were, boyfriend or not. It would be a constant fear of whether or not it was real what you were feeling, or you being controlling me like a puppet master."
"When you lost your memory, it felt like dying. It felt worse than the cruciartus curse, and I should know it! Every day I had to look at the back of your head in class wondering what was in it," Harry choked and tears sprung in the back of his eyes, "I had to watch you hate yourself because of the things you did in the war when I knew the other side to it. I couldn't help you! I had to watch you be hurt by other students because I couldn't defend you, because if I did, you would have hated me more that you do! I had to watch and wait and think that I could never touch you again, or hold you, or kiss you, or have a bloody conversation with you for two months! That's 61 days! Fuck! And I remember coming home from the Weasley's to find you gone with a note on the door saying there was a Death Eater on my premises, but there wasn't! It was just you! I can't even imagine how scared you were! And I can't even handle the thought of you in Azkaban!
"That's what you get," Draco held back a smile. He marched back and grabbed Harry's quill and parchment, as well as a few books and he slapped them on his desk, ignoring Harry's pout. "You'll thank me for this," Draco smiled which made Harry want to attack the boy more. His smile always did that- that thing where butterflies flew in his stomach... Or more like had a fist fight because it was doing backflips.
Draco sneered and stood marching to the door, but just as he reached it, Pumblechook spoke. "Harry Potter isn't the only orphan made at the hand of Death Eaters in the First Wizarding War."
"To answer your question, you are quite the clumsy one. Knocking down books in a deserted library and coughing in a room that only two people know about. Oh, and the ties were a favorite."
"I don't know. He hasn't spoken to me all day. I don't know what's going on to be honest with you," Harry said solemnly.
It was a Saturday evening, well past the usual feast time, so there wasn't anyone in the Hospital Wing or the Clock Tower. Draco took Harry's bag full of potions and treatment instructions so Harry didn't have to carry it.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but he didn't. He couldn't. Thankfully, Harry made it so he didn't have to. Harry disconnected their hands, which tingled from not moving the whole night, and he palmed his face, rubbing his cheekbones so carefully it was as if he was scared his fingers would go through them.
"Yeah. We understand each other better than anyone else who doesn't have this disorder. We help each other out of our dark places. It's weird because I feel old. I've lived lifetimes in a few years, you know. And they're all around our ages, a bit younger, some older, but I have done so much in the past eight years it's like... I have the advantage of seeing the world more as it is. They have a lot of fears that I don't have since I've gone through all of that."
"I shouldn't be in askaban, the result was justice." Draco's tone raised but he tried to keep it down. Sitting back at his desk as he began another sheet, just begging for Harry to hurry up. "Don't blame me, because you are too unapt at your own job that you can't even take down two eighteen year old boys in face of a murderous trial. And for your information, no, it doesn't bother him, because I am not a murderer."
"I never really felt like I was gay. I just loved him for who he is. Whenever we kissed I never thought to myself 'oh, I'm kissing another man.' It was just him and me." Hermione patted him on the shoulder. "You don think he'd be mad at me?"
Draco was stuck between wanting to watch Harry or to kiss his neck, but he kissed his mouth quickly, then back to watching him. They were both crying. "Harry," he shouted, fighting to keep from orgasming so Harry could first, but it was so hard. "Cum inside you," he panted. "Please!?"
"I tell myself that everyday; don't think I don't know it. So if you would please refrain from saying it, because I question why he's still here with me all the time. Just let me be happy until he gets a tablespoon of common sense, because the second he does, he's going to leave me. And I would rather die than to see that happen."
Draco was on the ground chortling too hard to get up and Pansy was close to falling over for 10 minutes straight.
"I feel better when I help you, too. Talking you out of drinking poison kept me going during the war because I knew I had to stop the people who hurt you. But that being said, I talked you out of drinking poison. Multiple times. You had to deal with so much to get to that point. I get life is better for you now. But I can't let you bury your guilt all the time and pretend you don't have a disorder, too."
"Yeah, I'm looking for some stuff too." They both laughed at their vague answers. "It was a fun date, that wasn't a date. I had a good time."
“Every excuse is awful! There is only one excuse that’s keeping me from saying yes! Fuck, I need you so bad! Please Harry, just go! We can talk after. I’m aching for you!”
The two were startled and broke apart, their cheeks reddening. “Sorry, guys, we didn’t hear you come in.” Draco took his hand and ran it through his hair unconsciously.
"Here I thought I'd be with you by now... I dunno how I'm not, but here I stay." Harry licked his lips and thought out loud. "I guess you only go when it's your time to go. Somewhere there's a contract with a date on it and you won't go until it's your date, because God knows how many times I've tested it. I don't know much about the afterlife, but I think that theory is truth."
"Dad, we got to go," George called. He and Arthur ran into the field of hay while all the Weasleys stood a bit away from the bonfire so it couldn't cloud their vision of the night sky. The clouds had dissipated, leaving a lovely view of stars.
"Memory loss, I assure you Harry remembers everything," Hermione started to argue but Draco interrupted. Madam Pomfrey decided to
"So," Draco asked, picking Harry up as their partners launched the rest of the girls. Harry rolled his eyes as he grabbed Draco's hand again.
Halfway through, Harry set his clean clothes on the counter and Draco thanked him, but nothing more came of it. When finished with his shower, Draco had to debate putting on clothes, because how funny would it be waltzing in and taking a seat with nothing on? But then he restrained himself and thought,
Because now he operated in survival mode for him. After everything he'd done to Harry the past year, after all the betrayals and the lies, the least he could do was try to protect him the best he could, and the best he could do was to save him. Help him win.
"If you want my honest opinion, your body is the most boring part of you, and not in a bad way. I will never look at you as critically as you look at yourself, and nor will anyone else. Because we all have bodies. And you are so much more than the bones that hold you up and the organs that keep you here. You are more than your shape. You are more than your skin. You are more than how much fat you have or how much you weigh, and to hell with people like the Dursley's who are so fucked up, such horrible, such boring, such shitty people, that they can't comprehend the simple fact that you're more than just your body."
It was several moments before Harry grabbed his wand and cleaned them, but Draco didn't move. Harry rubbed his back and kissed his forehead. Draco's body was shaking.
"According to you, I'm a ferret because you can't get over a traumatizing incident when we were fourteen. Besides, you always compliment how naturally smooth my legs are."
Then a tinge in his heart matched the intensity of the burn on his arm. Merlin, he didn't want to do this to him.
"'Romeo and Juliet." There was an entire row dedicated to Shakespeare and Romeo and Juliet was the first novel.
"I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. I promise. Just keep your hands on the floor. Tell me whatever you want to. Talk to me. I won't judge you. I'll hold you, okay? You can tell me anything."
"It's not! We can find out who did this to you together! I won't let them take you away from me again!"
“Come here,” Draco ordered, swimming after him and practically jumping on the boy, them both falling back in the water. Draco shoved his mouth onto the others, as Harry pulled them back to an edge for support. “That’s not fair,” he said before forcing his heated tongue into Harry’s mouth, swirling in it, tasting him until they couldn’t breath
"I've gotta go," He said before sprinting away, his throat closing, his eyes automatically watering.
Harry strolled to first block with the widest smile on his face. He couldn't keep from it. He was engaged. Engaged! To the man he loved, to the man who loved him. Everything seemed happier and brighter, especially due to the excruciating hate he'd been manifesting within himself for the past few months, it finally being obliterated.
the wrong thing to say. But it came out automatically, like his pride had it there, waiting for Draco to open his mouth and take over.
It took a while for them to stop laughing, and Harry's confused gryffindor friends were just staring at them until they did. Somehow they both ended up on the hardwood floor, Draco chuckling at Harry's chortle. He honestly wanted to throw up at the name "Drackiepoo" and even calling her Toribear made him nauseous.
"Well, I want him dragged into the forest by a bunch of centaurs like the first one." Draco rolled his eyes. "Please tell me you did that to him."
"I'm sorry I left. My family, I—I'm sorry. And I got jealous," Ron said. "But mate, I love her. I get you two have chemistry, but so do me and Hermione—"
“W-w-wimp!” Harry grabbed Draco’s legs so he was stable. He raced up the stairs, just trying to get some heat in him as Draco pressed his cold lips to Harry’s damp neck, his hair kept dripping what felt like icicles.
“I thought you loved it,” Harry turned to him. “You said you wanted to go to the Chamber of Secrets and I took you there!”
“-even though his father almost killed me, and your father has done nothing to ever hurt you, and here you are stabbing us both in the back. So what, we lied about his mark, but that doesn’t mean that he cares for you or loves you any less. He’s the one that wanted to have you. He’s the one who refused to let you go when you were born, I think I held you once or twice within the first year. He almost ripped Kline’s head off when he saw his tongue down your throat. If I had stopped him, your precious Doug would be dead by now. Damn it, Lily, he’s the one who’s been bawling his eyes out since you called him a murderer- but don’t tell him I said that!”
But Draco caught Harry's eye on the train platform, visible disgust and coldness on his face. And not in the way that he used to sneer, but still have a glimmer in his eye. Not with the hint of adoration he always had. Not mercury eyes, but unforgiving
Draco spent most of the time with Dr. Valerie. Harry checked his map between book-skimming in the library.
“I took him on a couple dates and they went really well, but at the Yule Ball, Harry overheard me talking about how much I would hate to kiss him, and he beat the daylights out of me.”
The Slytherin left later than anybody else, ensuring maximum safety, not even telling his friends where he was going. The air was dry, snow pouring down from the skys in a whisked flurry. It made Draco's throat burn, and the lump that was present feel even worse. He could definitely sense a virus approaching, whether it be from the snow or the dark lord himself, only a matter of time could tell.
"Potter's a rather dull person. The only thing special about him is his skills for Quidditch. I would say if you were to attack him, make it on foot. Don't let him have access to a broom."
"I hope you don't mean literally! That would be contradicting to the point in which we were trying to make about her not dying!"
"That's not it. Mum put it well when we were just starting to grieve Fred," Ron said. You could see the pain in his eyes. "Stress and bad things all weigh something, and usually on a good day, if something weighs us down, we can carry it. But when more and more things weigh us down, it makes it harder for us to function. And the war is a boulder for you. One that you can barely carry because it was so much. Your knees are shaking, your arms are tired, you know. And when someone comes along and throws a pebble on top of it, you collapse because you could barely carry the weight of the boulder. How could you carry anything else?"
"If you're under seventeen you have to be within two years of age of each other. Sixteen is really the encouraged minimum, but you can be fourteen I think without it being horribly illegal."
Draco walked up to his separate room holding his nose. The punch Harry threw was much harder than the one he sent in return, and his pride stung because of it. His whole face was throbbing and felt as though it was to dent any second.
“Nice of you to join me,” he said playfully, rising from the hot spa, “You know, it is mighty toasty in here, and there is room for two.” More like room for twenty. The bathroom was absolutely huge complimented with the bath to match it’s mad size.
He thought about Harry, and thought about his touch, and thought about how lucky he was, and thought about what it would be like if he was laying in the bed next to him, and what it would have been like to kiss him one last time before they departed.
"Everyone has a choice. It's whether or not you're strong enough to make the right one, and he didn't."
Careful not to wake Ron, he shut the door behind him quietly and led Draco to the sofa in the common room. Before he sat down, he pulled Draco into a tight hug.
"You got banned after that match. I forgot I had it." It's not like he buried his face in it when he was thinking suggestive thoughts about Harry, smelling his sweat.
"But then I found you," Hermione's voice softened and then laughed, "And I wanted to hit you with the shovel I was digging myself out with."
"Damn you," Harry sobbed, and Draco grabbed his face again and kissed him, and Harry felt like he was going to explode. He didn't know where to put his hands, they were shaking.
Draco wasn't built for relationships. If this didn't include breaking Potter in half, he wouldn't even consider it. Being in a relationship with someone was such an appalling thing. So much so, he didn't think he could do this to anyone but Potter—that's how much he hated him.
"It's not my fault, it's my job." Harry kissed him again, too short. Then, still sitting on him, Harry turned around and grabbed one of Draco's books. "This is for Flitwick's essay, right?"
"We only got to play one game while we were boyfriends," Harry said. "Before Umbridge got us banned and all that."
"I'm fine, why? Why the hell am I on the floor," he said, completely ignorant to the event that just occurred.
Harry sat near the calming water, listening to the rippled waves, waiting. Sleep came seldom to him ever since that nightmare; he didn't get much of it.
He tried his best, he really did, to control his emotions. Every time he saw Draco in the halls, it was a different reaction every time. At one point, Draco nodded at him, another, he sneered. The worst was when he saw him, and their eyes met, but Draco didn't see him. As if he was just another person whom he'd never met or cared about.
"Anyway, as I was saying. We need to wait a few days. Stare at him, but when he catches your eye, look away. We have so much more to go over before you actually talk to him. Phase One: Complete. Phase Two: Pending."
Harry couldn't help himself. He slowly unwrapped their tangled arms and climbed off the bed, checking to make sure Draco remained asleep. Then he tip-toed to the other side and tapped Hermione until she woke. She looked at him, about to ask if he was okay, but he put a finger to his mouth, signaling to be quiet, and pointed at Draco and Ron.
"I know," Draco said, or at least he thought he should say it, or something similar to what he said last year. How do you remember who you once were after changing so much? "I'm sorry."
During those six days, Harry and Draco wrote each other about two or three times a day, and sometimes at night. Sometimes it wasn't even intentional, but Draco would stop everything he was doing to tell Harry something, small or important.
"You," Harry shouted, a bubble of anger overcoming him. He turned to leave but was stopped when a hand grabbed his wrist.
Harry had a grin on his face before opening his eyes, that's how happy he was, however he didn't have a concrete answer for it, not needing one. He only thought about the next meeting with Draco, and seeing his smile again.
'Draco, you idiot! You are supposed to make him fall for you not the other way around! And what man are you? He's taking you on a broomstick ride and you're just sitting on the back like a lost puppy! You're the man in the relatio- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?'
"What," Harry questioned, raising an eyebrow, sitting up in a crisscross position," What are you talking about?"
"How was your holiday," Harry asked, taking Draco's hand and lacing theirs together, and the contact made Draco's arm burn even more. He bit his lip, hard, to keep from showing Harry.
Draco stayed quiet for a while, thinking. He bit his lip. He had no idea in the entire world that Harry thought this way, that he had these insecurities, and they'd been so entirely close for so long that it was like being slapped in the face.
"Well, McGonagall said that she will convince the Aurors that you returned to Hogwarts if it means you and I go to the Weasley's the rest of holiday. Only if you want."
“He’s not going to like the idea of the love of his life joining the cult that murdered his entire family, plus more.” Draco wiped his face. “I feel so sick.”
Draco paused, staring at the floor in front of him. "What if I like my bond with Harry? What if I don't want to break it?"
"So you can only sleep around me? Right?" The green eyed boy perked up at the sound of the enthusiasm in his voice.
But Harry couldn't sleep. His heart was fluttering too much. In his wake, Harry thought of Malfoy. He wasn't perfect. He was... rich. And came from a background so different from Harry, and he didn't want to judge him too harshly. But Harry wasn't necessarily looking for perfection. Maybe the next one would be better, or maybe it would be terrible and they would crash and burn.
Draco rounded the corner with his legs burning, and he hopped into the alcove where Harry waited for him in dark solitude.
Harry hated the fact that they couldn't never be see each other in public without a crude stare or a flying hex. He wished he could have a relationship, without having to worry about Draco's family's finding out, or his image being obscured.
"Do you want to crash in my room, I'm sure Ron wouldn't mind as long as we were quiet," Harry asked as they were walking back from detention. There had been an awkward silence and finally Harry decided to fill it.
They enjoyed their privacy and their last day together the best they could while Harry was in his grieving state. Harry ate several times without Draco asking him to.
"It's okay," Harry said. "We just wanted to shelter you. There are some things in the past that happened that we had to do under a specific circumstance to survive. And it's inexcusable and we've talked about it. And we've healed together."
“I’m a liar,” Draco wept into his neck. “I’m fake, I’m a liar, and I’m lying! I can’t let you go.” He grabbed Harry’s chin and spoke into his eyes. “You’re amazing and charming and you’re the only thing I care about. You make me happy, Harry, you make me so happy!”
“Yeah I did, actually,” Harry smiled at the thought. “I thought of it that summer before 6th year even started. I wasn’t going to take action, it wasn’t serious enough, but I just pictured it, waking up next to you every day, blowing up toasters and such.”
"As you do every morning," Harry rolled his eyes. "What makes this day different? Are you nervous? Excited?"
It was the day after, morning to be precise, Harry Potter's name spat itself in a blaze from the Goblet of Fire; a mystery no one could solve, even Potter, however it's not like anyone would believe his explanation.
Harry paused and let his curiosity take him over and he nodded, although he wore a look of distaste. Draco bit his lip and held onto Harry's wrist, leading him deeper into the forest. He let go of his wrist.
The memory surfaced and Harry blinked as he tried to follow what he'd said before. "Er... I'm sorry, it just slipped out. I didn't mean to say it. Can we please talk about this later?"
Draco felt anger arise in his veins, but he challenged it. "So instead you make toasters. What does your father do?"
"Yeah but....you never know..." Harry frowned at the thought of his parents not wanting him, but thankfully Draco was there to kiss him on the cheek to make his heart hurt a little less.
He opened one of the cabinets, which had a cooling charm and a bunch of ice packs. He handed him one.
"Don't you dare think that I trust you even a teaspoon, Malfoy. You have one chance, and that's all you get. Mess it up-"
Harry sat down next to Hermione, for about 10 minutes until Dumbledore stole him away to get ready for the suicide mission. They walked down the Great Hall together, stares locking on them, and turned out the door.
To avoid feeling disgusting of himself, he tossed the bag down and asked. "Where did you get that picture?" Because the last he remembered, Harry left that picture behind in his Hogwarts trunk, hidden at the Weasley's. Not for a keepsake, but because he needed to destroy them once all of this was over. He didn't have the time to do it before the wedding, and he and Malfoy cast a protective charm on them, so he needed special help to break it.
"I'm fine," Harry nodded, biting his lip. Draco repositioned them so Harry was leaning back on him. "It was three months until I saw him again. And he was in a jail cell in front of a jury. And he didn't have a lawyer. So there was no way he was going to make it out. So I, being the loving boyfriend I was, decided to become a lawyer for a day and we actually won. It was probably the most terrifying thing in my life. And on top of that they made him take veritaserium. If they asked the wrong question we would have been completely exploited.
"Oh, no." Blaise pulled him into Pansy's room and closed the door, and once he saw the two together, he realized
The doors opened and he started to run to the door that held the prisoners. Arthur had to open it with his wand, a security lock. The second it was released, Harry pushed though the doors that wouldn't open fast enough and he started to run.
Harry didn’t answer right away, but just nuzzled deeper into Draco’s neck. “I know,” he whispered. His eyes welled at what he was about to tell him. “It was all my fault-“
“Why is it that every secret you have is a bomb shell? First it’s that you’re a bloody Death Eater, then it’s that you’re engaged! If you wouldn’t have kept it a secret to begin with, and fucking told me, Draco Malfoy! Engaged!”
"It's just... I don't know when it'll happen. If it'll happen. If I'm already there, or if I will never get there."
"I didn't know how," Draco almost whispered. "I wanted to spare you by pushing you away in hopes you'd lose feelings for me too, but that back fired and you feel even deeper, and I'm so sorry." A tear fell from his eye, and Harry wiped it with his thumb, Draco letting him.
"Wait," Draco caught her shoulder. "You tell my husband that his husband says he'd better get his shit together and break that spell himself or that I'll come after him ten times worse than Kline did. And you have to phrase it just like that or it'll lose my cheeky personality that he adores."
They could die. He could die. Draco could die. Everyone he knew and loved and cared for and hated and felt sorry for could die, and yet he didn't feel any sense of urgency to continue on the conversation because of the fright of Draco leaving him, hating him. Sure, people were dying, but he was too. Didn't Harry deserve a few last moments with the only person he would be willing to spend the rest of his life with.
"Mmhmm. I'm sure you don't." Harry rolled his eyes. "Third year wasn't bad. I went back in time. That was fun, I'll tell you the story one day. But that's how I rescued Sirius from having his soul sucked out, so that was great. Met Wormtail, that was horrible."
“I need to be with my mother,” Draco mentioned, “She’s under house arrest all alone, I’m sure she would die to have my company. And don’t get me wrong, she’s going to love you, but I think she would want us to be alone for a while.”
Draco finally understood what Pansy meant when she said that the two looked so cute together, as Mirror-Harry kissed mirror-Draco on the cheek. This caused both Dracos to smile and blush profusely. Draco touched his cheek where the mirror-Harry left his lips on him. There was a small tingle, but nothing compared to the real thing. Mirror-Draco turned his head to mirror-Harry, their lips connecting. At first their kiss was soft and sweet, and Draco admired them. If this was truly how the look, how beautiful they connect with each other, Draco couldn't want anything more.
The woman swallowed back her anger for the sake of avoiding her head being cut off.  "The problem, Mr. Potter, is that the rib won't move. The spell he was hit with -- It was meant to freeze his blood so the rest of his body wouldn't get what it needed."
"I would appreciate it if you two would stop your little pow-wow and get to your stations, unless of course you would like to attend here next week as well."
According to Draco, those were the slowest six days of his life. He discovered that while he was sitting crisscross outside of the manner, just in front of the door, not caring how cold it was. He was wearing Harry's Gryffindor hoodie and black trousers, along with his slytherin scarf, but the frost still bit at his nose. Draco was awaiting Harry's arrival at the manner, and he was probably the most excited man in the world.
Draco smiled down at Harry, his eyes filled with light and wonder. "Just enough to find out if you're gay or not."
Draco cast a charm to put out the fire, cooling it quickly before Harry took a bit of branch and threw it into the lake yet again. He shouted obscene words and insults, rambling about Umbridge and the press and everyone who didn't care about him.
"I hope you get that, Harry." And then, after more silence, Draco asked, "If there was one thing that you could have in this world, what would it be?"
"Shall I lead you to my quarters," Draco asked, grinning as he took Harry's arm. Harry nodded and thanked Narcissa again before they walked out of the room.
Harry nodded. "And best of all, I asked if you could leave the Manor so long as you were under my supervision so we can have Christmas at the Weasley's."
“I missed you, too! So we escaped before Voldemort got there with your father’s help, and then the next time we were together was during the war. He followed me and we talked about it just a bit-“
"It would have if you weren't so audible of actually hating me. If you would have kept your trap shut, you would have had a brilliant laugh, I totally would have been fooled," Harry admitted.
Again, Harry bit his lip. He looked at his hands, which he played with, because he was just so damned happy. "Well that's still a good thing. I didn't want to go on a date with someone who hates me... although I've already done that before now that I've mentioned it, and it ended up going pretty well. I got a boyfriend for two years after it."
But how the fuck could Harry? When your family is hurt, nothing matters, you're stuck in a sickening, freezing anxiety. No advice anyone can break the wall of fear that is consuming you.
"Hold on," Harry said, bold and courageous and strong. Draco wanted to maul him, because damn was he sexy. Harry climbed off of him and walked towards Lucius in a strut, as if Draco was now his property, as if Harry owned him and Lucius did not. "What kind of father conceals an outcome of a war to which their entire family was deeply involved, to which completely determined the rest of their lives together, wholly or not? What kind of father abandons his own child in his room after fighting in battle and seeing innocent people die? What kind of father houses a murderer to protect their wife and son? What kind of father beats his own family—"
Draco frowned. "What do you mean? I want to be there for him when he wakes up. I'm his soulmate, I'm the one helping him through this."
"I thought you loved it," Harry turned to him. "You said you wanted to go to the Chamber of Secrets and I took you there!"
Draco acted quickly and grabbed Harry by the wrist, leading him to an unlocked door inhabiting cleaning supplies.
'Here it goes,' he thought to himself before speaking for real. "Good morning 7th years, as you probably have guessed already, I'm Professor Potter, and welcome to Advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts."
He turned the water on and despite the noise next to him he could still hear the protests coming from the bedroom. "This is torture!"
"I read your letters," Harry tried to interject, but he kept babbling like an idiot, and although it hurt Harry to see him standing where he was standing, it made his abused heart swoon. He thought he was the only one who wasn't over their relationship.
“It would have been a funny face,” Draco smiled, putting a hand in his hair and stroking it away from his face.
"I like you very much, too." Draco dragged his nose along the side of Harry's face and kissed his cheek. They'd never been so intimately close before.
"Good! Now let's get down stairs and help set up! I need to go find Ron and tell him we don't need those tulips," she laughed and Harry smiled.
Harry gagged again, and before Draco knew it, Harry had ran across the hall, into the bathroom, where he collapsed onto the toilet, and threw up.
A few hours had passed and nothing was to be found on memory loss due to a dementor attack. It was eccentrically useless. Harry pulled out his broken pocket watch every hour, the dial still stuck on 1260. At about 4 a.m. when Hermione was almost passed out and Harry started scribbling Draco's name on his paper for motivation.
"William," A Gryffindor stood, "Will there be a lot of essays, because I'm not very good at essays," he said absentmindedly. He looked like he had no idea what he was doing. His brain capacity caused him to smile.
"Draco!" Harry cracked as fresh tears rid down his face. He broke into a sprint towards Draco, jumping and slamming into him. They reached in for a desperate kiss. They needed each other, as if someone dove into the lake for 3 minutes and they finally got to the surface, finally getting air to fill their lungs. Harry jumped off of Draco as they were still kissing. Draco ran his fingers thought the raven hair as Harry wrapped his arms around his waist. Their kiss was sloppy and full of tears. They sucked each other until there was absolutely no air in their lungs.
Harry gave her a reassuring smile and they were escorted to the gates where they apparated to Grimmauld Place.
At this, Harry's face turned stone cold. He knew exactly what Malfoy had to tell him: he fancied him.
"Exactly. Two years. Whether or not if was fake, I was still around him for two years. I would know if it was him if I saw him, and this is not him," Draco rushed, still looking into Harry's eyes, Harry begging him silently.
"As a matter of fact, yes I do!" Harry ran over and picked him up from behind, spinning him around. He planted kisses on his neck and ear, turning him around to face him. Harry dived for Draco's mouth, leaving as much passion in a kiss as he possibly could, Draco doing the same. Fire works went off, mimicking that of the 4th of July. Things got heated but were interrupted by the growling of Draco's stomach.
Everything was aligning for this to work, though Draco wished he could put a picture of himself in front of him so that he could go about talking with Pansy and eating his dinner without watching Potter chase peas around his plate for half an hour.
"Ron, we don't need to talk about that in detail right now," Hermione said. "That's not going to fix anything." She took another breath. "But yeah, you were awful enough to him for him to want to say goodbye to you, which is how you ended up here."
He followed the path the Gryffindor went through, the icy clouds cracking his skin. The spectators were not in view anymore, the sounds of the crowd were not heard anymore, it was just Harry, Draco, and the snitch.
Draco turned away from him, defeated. Harry hadn't expected him to act like this, in fact he'd wished the opposite. He could control out of control Draco. He found him bloody hot, to be honest with you. He didn't know how to handle this kind of Draco. "This wasn't supposed to happen with you. I'd expect it from anyone else, but you. You're
"You first have to forgive yourself for not being able to handle all of this. There's nothing wrong with you for feeling this way. We can work on forgiving yourself for leaving the Floo open, too, but we need to get you out of crisis mode. We need to make a plan."
The picture of the couple in the cupboard didn't do much for him. In fact, doing this in general was something Draco wasn't completely comfortable with. He'd never done it before. He never thought about it, simply because it was never something presented as a possibility. Was he even allowed to do this?
"Surprise," Harry smiled warmly. "I knew there'd be some protocol. I wrote to Ministry the day I left."
“No. Her birthday is December 8th…9th? Early December. She went into Hogwarts late, I think. Either that or she got held back… I’m not sure. She’s easy to tune out. So she’ll be legal then even though she's a 6th year.”
The clerk rang up the purchases, which Harry just signed off on without looking at the number. Then he tied up the wedding bands while giving them both the engagement rings.
The sheer thought of Draco being in a true relationship was terrifying, beyond his father killing him. He wasn't good enough to be someone's partner. He wasn't built for this. And these thoughts might be sudden, but he always knew this deep down, and he just thought he and Potter were... trying to get over each other. Obviously failing because they'd only grown closer.
"Y-yes," Draco dared not to lie. He knew his father could tell if he was lying. Lucius looked down at the elf, his face dressed in a smirk built of malice, and bellowed a spell Draco knew was coming.
He swallowed. "Somewhat. It's a promise. I want to one day do this for real. I guess you could call it a proposal. I-If you would want a proposal. If you want marriage, I'll give you it. I'll give you my heart."
Harry nodded, squeezing him and letting him go. He didn't look back at him as he ran through the halls with Ron and Hermione.
Harry just closed his eye and turned his head away from him. "You expect me to be happy when everything sucks?"
He came at the very idea of Harry marrying him, his very voice saying those words. Harry didn’t have to move at all.
"I think I got up to the part right before 5th year ends," he said wiping water from his face. "We were talking about... taking our relationship to the next level, and he wrote about how excited he was. And then I found out he was a Death Eater and never picked it up again."
"What? Um Draco I'm pretty sure if I went even 10 meters away from the dungeons than I would be killed In the process. What happened to us being a secret?"
They were about to disperse and Harry knew it, so he grabbed Draco and took him down a separate corridor so they wouldn’t be seen.
"Harry, stop being stupid," he said, a wave of nausea overcoming him. His heart was beating so fast—
There was one day in particular just before the first of June when Draco couldn't hold it in anymore.
It wasn't before long until the boy turned around and saw Draco, and Draco took the opportunity to mouth, 'You'll be okay,' but Harry scowled and rolled his eyes in return before turning back to the maze.
"Yes, really. I think this is incredible that you would do this for me. Thank you." Harry smiled. "Although this place is brilliant... these bones are actually very terrifying."
They didn't hear the apparation crack, however, because they were so drawn into each other. But they sure as hell heard Ron:
Harry, again, moaned, but this time it was involuntary. Harry kissed his cheek and then his jaw and then his neck so achingly slow. He couldn't get enough of Draco's taste in his mouth.
Harry remembered a few years ago there was a sudden appearance of fifty Pepper-Up Potion vials in their medicine cabinet. He winced.
"I had a horrible nightmare!" He got up from his bed and sprinted to the bathroom, squeezing toothpaste onto his toothbrush.
At five o'clock, Draco and Harry walked to detention together, unexcited and already agitated, however Draco was more relaxed than he.
Kingsley blinked at his rush. "And the jury will find him innocent, if that was the case. This is bigger than the both of us. I can't go just pardoning the man who attempted murder on Dumbledore—"
—"doesn't think I mean it. And I didn't kiss this girl back but... it's complicated—" because he did kiss Cho back. He thought it would be a good cover.
“Why didn’t you just beat him up, or report him if he stole something. I’m sure you could kick him out faster than a blink of an eye.”
"I guess that holds some merit. Draco, oh Draco, where for art thou Ferret?" Harry pressed the back of his hand over his forehead delicately as if he was going to faint. Draco rolled his eyes.
"You said you wanted me dead," his voice cracked and he felt his throat close on top of all the pain he was feeling, "You said Death Eaters got what they deserved, being tortured and murdered and since the Dark Lord hasn't yet, you tried to."
. And at first Draco refused to do such a disgusting thing, but then he and Harry shared a few kisses that
"I just remember signing the stupid thing because I thought I wasn't even going to be alive. It was so
Malfoy snorted. "Right, like I'd ever help you. Try to give me a good enough reason, Potter. I dare you."
It wasn't less than a second more when Harry grabbed Draco's face and smashed their lips together, hard. He needed this. They both needed it. All their uptight emotions poured into the lip locking session, as the boys sucked and licked and bit each other. Harry forced in entrance and Draco wasn't one to object, encouraging it by wrapping his arms tightly round the other boys back. He wiggled his butt so that their chairs were almost connected, enabling him to wrap his legs around the boy. As Harry invaded his mouth Draco moved his hands into Harry's soft hair, but then down to his hips.
"Draco Potter. Do you believe you are qualified for the job," Draco rose from his seat in the very back, trying to keep the smile from his face that was urging to break free.
"I'm sorry," he whispered next to Draco's ear and he kissed his cheek before sitting down next to the bed. He just wanted to watch him, make sure no one came in to hurt him, which was irony within itself because Harry was the one who put him there in the first place. He grabbed Draco's hand under the blankets and locked their fingers together. He could have sworn he felt Draco's thumb stroke his, but then again, Harry had been numb the entire day, there was no way of telling.
"It's not like I can help it." Snape's lips flattened into a straight line. "I'm being punished for something I can't control."
Harry's jaw poked out, but he lowered his voice. "This is why I didn't go to Dumbledore when Umbridge was torturing me. Because he wouldn't listen if I did, and I knew that, but I still told myself the fairytale that he would because I thought he was a good person. But he wasn't, just like you're not."
The first hour, Harry had been fighting, and then he won the war, and then he immediately searched the castle in case Draco was there. The second hour, Hermione and Ron had found him and made him eat, shower, and they healed him. Then, he ran for it, and now he was here.
Draco was pounding into him vigorously, reaching closer and closer, deeper and deeper to orgasm. He too was screaming his lover's name, and moaning and groaning in between. "Yes, Harry! Ah!"
Harry hung by his arm, swaying in the wind as he gripped Draco's wrist, and Draco gripped Harry's. He smiled up at Draco, who, if he wasn't fifty feet in the air, would literally kill him. Literally kill him.
He could have told him, and he was set on doing it. But then something told him not to. A cautionary feeling. Because once he said it, he would never be able to unsay it, and if he needed to fairly testify at his trial... When he told him, it needed to be the right time, calculated. Calm. Now, he obviously wasn't. "He's innocent, and he doesn't deserve to be there."
"Asking Draco Malfoy to not obsess over Harry Potter is like asking the sky not to be blue," Blaise snorted.
Still, Harry tried. He unhooked a leg, and reached forward, grabbing hold on the handle to try to steady himself. "Harry, stop it," his voice was pure panic, "You're going to get hurt."
Harry immediately opened it again. He'd already taken off his jumper, leaving nothing but a t-shirt and jeans. "Are you sure I should join you? Because we've been apart for so long and rushing into something— I don't want to scare you off or make you uncomfortable, but if you want to, I'm willing—"
The following morning, Ron commented on his absence. "Mate, you didn't come back to bed last night," Ron said.
Every bad feeling Draco could possibly feel filled his body as much as he could. Draco grabbed his arm and pulled him back. Harry didn't lean into it, in fact, he resisted, and that's when Draco
Harry scrunched his nose, and Draco kissed the tip of it. Harry had to admit, the compliment made butterflies flutter in his stomach. "Thank you."
"You okay mate?" Wait a second. Draco knew those voices as they passed by. It was Harry and the Weasel.
When Neville arrived, he brought a tray filled with two pies. One in case the winner (cough cough Ron cough) missed. They were almost done, and the odds could go either way, but when there was "Checkmate," the whole world went quiet.
Snape gave him a glare made of daggers, but then realized he wouldn't be saying it, or he wouldn't be saying it in that way if the only thing he had cared about was in a risk of peril. "You listen to me. You should have ended it when you had the chance. Voldemort got to him in the Department of Mysteries. Somehow Potter snuck out, and they found him in the Ministry of Magic."
"He trusts me." Draco hissed, reaching for his sleeve and pulling it violently, causing them both to stare at its ugliness. "I was chosen."
"When he has disordered thoughts, listen to him, don't attack him for having them, because that voice is going to do everything it can to convince him its true. It's going to lie right to his face, and it's going to sound like truth, no matter how bizarre. When you're at the point, you can call out those thoughts. Not call him out, call out the thoughts. You both have a common enemy and that's the disorder. It sounds just like him though. It'll take a while to get a hold of it."
"I went to the Weasley's with Draco at my house, and came back and he was gone," he said with a shaky voice.
“Yeah but before you dated me? Say when we met at the robe shop in first year, what would you rate me?”
"Well, we only meet up once a week. We're enemies in the hallway. We can't just have a chat. But missing dates, Draco never used to miss dates, at least not without telling me. But then again, he was angry."
He felt satisfied as he finished, except when the sunrise came and he nearly got caught, forcing him to cast a
Harry took it and they sat, drinking more wine. And after a bit, the burn on Draco's arm didn't hurt so much. It felt warm all over, a little less worried.
And then he looked at Draco's lips and felt the urge to lean down, so he did but stopped when Draco stopped him.
"I guess... I guess it's a way to isolation," the blonde said. "It was always something I could go off and do without pressure- well sometimes- a moment to be free, if you will."
"I'm not mad! Why do you always act all defensive when you find that out? It just means you're emotionally conflicted right? That's what Snape said when I heard you two talking when you were like, fourteen."
Even if Malfoy's feelings were true, which was doubted, they could never get together. He couldn't even see the teenager get romantic at all. it would be like kissing cardboard... BLEH kissing Malfoy, Gross!
Harry ran out of bed and flung his arms around him, nearly knocking him over. He buried his head into his shoulder, and Draco squeezed him tightly. "How did you get in here?"
"Ah, good." Harry leaned against Draco's chest and fit his head against the side of Draco's, his arms over his shoulders with the book open in his hands.
"The reason you're here. Because I specialize in hurting you. And you've stayed in love with me this long. After I've given you so many reasons to leave. I've made fun of your friends, I've made fun of you, I've mocked you, I purposely destroyed you the entirety of Sixth Year. And now in Eighth Year, I've apparently made fun of your eating disorder, I've put you in the hospital." Draco choked, his eyes clouding over. "I don't mean to hurt you. I truly don't want to hurt you, I promise..." He wiped his face and buried his head in his hands as he let out a sob. "I don't want to cause you any pain, let alone this much."
Harry thrusted and throbbed inside of him, crying, too. That same feeling they always got, the familiar feeling of opening up to each other bubbled in their chests. He placed their foreheads together, sweat beading down their skin. “Draco,” Harry breathed, and then he moaned.
"Harry. Narcissa," she reached her hand out and Harry took it, shaking it. "So how did you ask? When?"
The image that appeared was his parents; it was always his parents. But too, Draco stepped into the frame, wrapping his arms around Harry's reflection. They were just a happy family, Draco kissing Harry's cheek as his parents hugged the both of them from behind. He had mercury eyes that were so beautiful, Harry thought he'd cry at the sight of it.
The first full day of Draco having to torture Muggles was a disaster. He wasn't good at it at all. The second they started screaming, Draco panicked and stopped the spell, making all of the Death Eaters rage and tease and laugh at him.
"No! Hell no! If I were to ever kiss Harry Potter I would pitch myself off the astronomy tower, joking or not. It's hard enough even getting closer than a foot to the obscurity," Draco ranted. "I was centimeters from his dorky glasses, let alone his lips, and I feel as though I should take two showers just to get his scent off of me. He smells horrid!"
"How have you already had this planned out," Harry asked. "Did you spend time with your mother at all?"
"Yes it did." He voice dropped. "Yes it did. Look at you. You're completely infatuated with me. You won't stop thinking about me, especially now—" Draco had to keep from fanning himself. Harry took several steps away, breaking the what felt like a gravitational pull.
Draco stayed in the hospital wing for another day, only because Snape was forcing him to. He'd been pulling his hair out about his mission and it was stopping him from thinking about anything else, including Harry. Severus gave him instructions, offered help, but he never took it. He was going to do this. He had to save his family. He had to.
Draco had to think of something fast. He couldn't say it was Pansy for Lucius knew they were only friends.
"He did save my life during the war," Arthur commented, "That's something I will forever be grateful for. You did tell us he didn't want to do it."
." There were ten beds surrounding a circle. There were red walls and red sheets and red curtains. Red posters and lions and just... red. "It's. Just.
He dragged Harry by his hand and took him to the closest broom closet, where they kissed freely. As much as they wanted. Slowly and intensely and then quickly and lovingly, holding each other tighter and tighter.
That night, Draco took Harry to the spot where Harry proposed, candles floating everywhere along a blanket, like their first date. There, roses were surrounding the area and there were all notes attached, each reading something Draco loved about Harry.
It took Draco several seconds to answer. "But you must like the whole hero thing. That's all you do. It's who you are."
"Who's down 'ere," Filches voice echoed through the deathly still hall. Harry grabbed Draco's hand and sprinted. The Slytherin had trouble keeping up with him, only due to the fact Harry ended up being much stronger than him with the continuation of Quidditch- that and he ate more than Draco did.
It took quite a while as Madame Pomfrey took a few blood samples and weighed him, but following it, Harry, Ron and Hermione started down the hall. They passed by Draco, unbeknownst to them. Draco then went behind beside Harry, letting Harry smell him (he wore extra cologne so that touching him couldn't scare him. He also walked off pattern of their footsteps so Harry could hear them as well.). Harry looked in Draco's general direction and gave a small smile before Draco touched him. He grabbed his hand and held it, and Harry held Draco's back.
They weren't sure how long they hugged, but it was enough to sync and steady their heartbeats, reducing the horror that still lingered in their veins from all the trauma they'd just endured. It was enough to feel love again, something they hadn't in so long. Their bodies were anchors.
Speaking of Draco, he wouldn't even look in Harry's direction, and he snuck out before the bell rang.
Draco already hit land and broke out into a sprint, ignoring all the shouts coming from his boyfriend. Grabbing his robes and nothing else, he went thought the heavy vines and ran thought the long hallway made of trees. He weaved thought the first 4 trees only to have arms wrap around his waist pulling them both back, knocks them to the ground. Draco got up and grew on his robes as he started to sprint again, but Harry caught his foot and he fell to the leaves once more.
Of course Draco wanted sex, and actually was planning something for the end of the year, however due to recent events, he thought it back over. There was no way Harry would be up for sexual affairs; and he kept that in his mind when he stopped at the thighs and went back to adoring his arms.
"Have me, Mr. Potter," Harry raised an eyebrow, and Draco couldn't help but laugh, but also have his eyes water in joy.
"I had the hottest lawyer on the planet and no one told me!" Harry laughed. "Merlin, Harry, you should totally be a lawyer."
"Yes, Draco. Do this for me. Making this tender would not.. I can't, Draco. Just bloody fuck me, okay? Make it hurt as long as you can. No lube. No preparation."
"Patrolling. Keeping an eye out on you. That's why I was kind of excited to do it. Because I know what she's planning. Harry, she has vials of veritaserum. She thinks you and your friends are up to something."
He unraveled the rest of his knot, and his trousers fell. He could see his own bulge as he looked down and then in the mirror. It was interesting but also strange. Experimentally, he gripped himself and massaged his cock through his briefs, the feeling of sweet pleasure making its way through his body.
"Draco, seriously! This hurts really bad!" His arms were starting to tingle. Harry, regretting his decision, just wanted to be saved by Draco and ride off into the night with him, just like their first date.
"That and the memories. I wouldn't want to use the ring you used the same day you I tore us apart. It was the night I found out you were a death eater. And I was too conceded of a bastard to hear you out."
But now he's had a a true conversation with the boy, and it seemed like he really connected with Draco. He never felt so comfortable with Ron or Hermione.
Draco turned ghostly pale, nodded at Harry, and left. Three days. They'd see each other again in three days in Azkaban, or at least, that's what Harry and he planned, and that's when Draco expected the funds to run out.
"I dunno. I hope not because if he did, and he kept letting me go back..." He shuttered. "I don't want people to know. I'm almost out, two more years."
"I will not allow such mistreatment of vermin in this house. I don't need word getting out that my son has become a weak caregiver. Especially to the Ministry."
He took several breaths, staring at the floor. "I don't know if that matters at this point. I mean, how many people don't know what they're getting into?"
Draco cleared his throat. "Well, I'm not proud of it. It wasn't the kindest way to get together... But it worked out. Long story short, I wanted him to lose the Triwizard, and so I thought if he was distracted by the love of his life, then he wouldn't care and Krum would win. So I fake dated him. I pretended to have this crush on him and I apologized to people I bullied in front of him because I was 'a changed man'," Harry snorted, "and then we got paired to do the potions project together and it was like magic."
"A bit overwhelmed. It's horrible, what happened. I'm so sorry for all of your losses. They were all good people."
Harry smiled at the note one of his councilors brought him two days into his next round of treatment. "Came from an unauthorized owl. Checked it four times, it's not cursed."
"It's okay, Mr. Potter. As human beings, we don't retain all of our memories anyway. Our memories are finite."
"Yes dear," said her mother, who had matching hair but a wrinkled, bitter face. She looked hungry and wild and just so cold.
"Nothing, it's just the way you said it! Are you seriously not afraid whenever you get into some summons to contest?"
"Why wouldn't they tell you," Harry furrowed his eyebrows in anger, blinking away tears. "Draco, I beat him. Voldemort. He's dead. I won. We won the war. I beat him. He's dead!"
Harry let out a breath. "Someone else kissed me and I... froze. And h-she doesn't know. And she gets really jealous. She knows she gets jealous, and h-she's worked on it before... but I just don't want to hurt..."
Harry huffed with a small smile on his face. "Draco. I mean it. You need to know defense if you're going to be living with Voldemort."
"How about Fridays," Draco offered. "A lot of people are missing from the Great Hall doing their own thing. I know the Slytherin's like to hang out that night, too, parties and gatherings and whatnot."
Hermione flicked her wand, and Harry's curtains closed.She stood in the doorway as Ron's heavy footsteps met her. "Hey," she said.
"Thank you so much for the food. This is the first time I've come to Hogwarts not starving. It feels so nice. I'm old enough to go to London and ride on the trains, so I got to eat whenever I wanted there. I'd wake up after Uncle Vernon went to work and leave before Dudley or Aunt Petunia could see me, and then I'd come home late. Barely saw them, thank God.”
But Harry couldn't help but stare at Draco. How his hair fell forward, his brow bent in concentration. Sometime he bit his lip, sometimes he tilted his head.
“She kissed me,” he shoved him. Draco didn’t fight back, but tugged on him tighter. “Thank you,” Harry said after a few moments of silence.
"That's bollocks. You know we're all in therapy. You know I'm in treatment. You know he went to a hospital last term," Harry growled, and Draco kept down a smile—he couldn't help it, he loved it when Harry defended him. "You know better. It's unacceptable and I don't want you near him again. I don't want you teaching here. You're a lawyer, go be one."
"You're just saying that to make me give up," Harry called him out and Draco found himself unable to form words for a few seconds. Draco stared down at him, their proximity going unnoticed as he took in Harry's cucumber smell. He found it intoxicating.
The goal of today's date was to be mostly normal and return to their cheery, fun state. To make Harry seem like he was crazy. To make it seem like nothing had changed, and those dates were, though purposely damaging, small and meaningless.
Harry opened the box, revealing The Malfoy pocket watch. The snake on the back made from emeralds shined incredulously.
"I dunno. It seems like sliding down a pipe isn't the type of entrance Salazar Slytherin would have wanted to make." He cocked his head.
"I will," Draco was shaking away his last hiccups as he finished tying Harry's shoes back together. "See you in a week?"
"We don't even know if the DA is going to be a thing, it's just an idea. And that's the thing, I don't want you to. The less people that know the better, the safer we are. If Voldemort knows..."
"This place is incredible," he said genuinely, more to himself. Thanks to Harry and the value of the Manor being haunted by memories, he actually felt at home, and he didn't quite know how to handle it. He knew he didn't fit in, but he wanted to, and it was harder to admit he was also jealous of the Weasley's more than he was jealous of Harry just because his father always talked so horribly of them.
"That's so unfair! I'm not allowed to watch your practices. You shouldn't be allowed to watch mine."
"I hate the name Harry Potter. I hate it so much." Harry set his glasses on the table and rubbed his face. "Do you know how many speeches I was in today?"
"No," Draco reached into his back pocket and handed a folded piece of paper to Harry. "Everything's fine."
Harry had never been so angry at Draco before in his life. To deny love in general was such a touchy subject since that is how his parents saved his life and he saved everyone's. Harry pushed Draco back on the bed behind him, putting his legs on either side of him, and placing his face so close their noses were touching.
He turned around to see Harry basically fuming. “At least I called you pretty,” Draco said, trying to lighten the mood. Harry mouthed ‘I’m going to kill you,’ and he was set free, but his muffaldo was still in tact.
And they stayed like that, arse naked on the tiled floor of an old bathroom, Harry in Draco's lap with only a small light giving them vision, for four hours. Four hours because it took that long for Harry to falter. It took Harry that long to stop screaming, even if his throat was raw and bleeding. Even then, it if felt like he was being sliced open, he kept screaming and sobbing
Instead of their Hogwarts uniforms, they wore tailored suits and filled them out well. Harry's hair was still a mess, and his age showed up on his face.
With this, Draco, who was gulping down his drink, snorted enough of the liquid in which it filled his nose and caused him to cough uncontrollably. "What! We're still doing that? It's been a month- hell, it's a week before the first task. We've all forgotten about it," Draco scoffed, wiping his mouth on a cotton napkin.
"I'm very happy for you. Andromeda is great, but I know you, and Draco will be great parents to him, too. He has a good support system. He'll grow up fiercely loved, and that's all Tonks and I could ever ask for."
The realization hit Draco like a brick. They were telling him the start of it. The idea was brilliant! This was what Snape meant.
He sniffed. "And now I'm scared something else bad will happen to you. I'm not stupid enough to get my hopes up now."
Draco finished unbuttoning his shirt. He did his best to hide his blush. "No. This increase my debt to you."
"HA," Draco roared, shaking the snitch in his hand. "Finally! Do you know how long I've waited for this? Years Potter,
"I don't want you to stop," Harry bit. "I want this. I want you." The single-handed thought that they were finally together and whole, sex-wise or not, made his nerves dissipate. Home. Draco pushed his way back in, but Harry yelped again. Their hips were so close, warm and sharp and just there. Even that in it of itself was an entirely new feeling.
And he sobbed and he sobbed and he sobbed and he screamed and cried and yelled and cursed and grasped his heart on the floor of his bathroom, up against his sink cabinet. He could still hears Voldemort's haunting laugh at his lover's body. That was the last thing he knew at Harry's dying sight. His grave would rest there. Harry's grave. Because Harry was dead.
"I'm glad you asked, Weaslebee. A week before our first anniversary, we were talking about the Chamber of Secrets—keep in mind we were literally right next to it eating cake. Why? Because we were bored of our usual hang out spot and this was closer to the kitchens. Anyway. So this... hopeless romantic here decides for our One-Year Anniversary to open the Chamber, and when I asked him 'what about the basilisk,' he goes 'don't worry, I've killed them all' and then pushes me into the abyss and I land on a bunch of human bones. And then we ate dinner next to a Basilisk carcass that was still not fully decayed. And that. Weasley, is what it's like to date Harry Potter. The pique of romance."
"Just kiss me," he said, his free hand grasping the back of Draco's neck, which had a few beads of sweat upon it. He pulled him down and their lips crashed, Draco completely off guard. Teeth clashed, but he corrected himself, and their tongues met hotly in battle, Harry wanting to win over dominance just to distract him, but Draco wasn't going down without a fight. "Keep going."
"I feel it," Harry said. "They don't need to tell me it. I know I'm going to die in a few days. It's my time to go."
"No," Harry said strongly. "We've been together since we were fourteen. You're not making any sense."
But being away from someone close to you, not knowing if they were okay, is the hardest thing you could endure.
But Harry didn't answer right away, not until he took the right and continued following him up the large spiral staircase towards the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom.
She narrowed her eyes at them. "We are in a professional environment and you two aren't teenagers. If anyone catches you doing any displays of affection, you're both fired. Understood? I don't care how many certifications in Potions you have," she turned to Draco, and then back to Harry, "And I don't care if you've saved the world. Understood?"
"Maybe that's a good thing, mate," Ron patted his back. "What type of a girl is she? Tom-boy? Tom-girl? Does she play for her house."
Harry out his head in his hands then pretended to rub his imaginary facial hair which he shaved away.
He thought of Draco, and the pool of wonderful memories they shared over the past ten months now had a shade of red over them, destroyed by what Harry did.
"When someone keeps shaking their leg. I just want to punch people in the mouth when they do that. Who are you asking to the ball?"
He left Harry with frown on his face and tears in his eyes. Harry refused to let them fall. Not yet, anyway.
"Here mate. I think you'll need this." Blaise tossed him the pillow before walking off to the boys dormitory, hoping sleep will find him before tomorrows quidditch game. Draco took the pillow and threw it down where it was before, laying down and screaming in it until his voice was hoarse and tears fell to his cheek.
Speaking of Draco, the blonde went straight to his room without a look back, yet he felt Harry's eyes upon him the entire time, which they were.
He looked up at Potter, who rested his face leading on his cheek, elbow on the table. In his other hand, Potter chased his food with his fork.
They stared at each other across the way, faint smiles that were comforting and peaceful. They remained silent for a bit, lulling over the water and letting their sore bodies relax.
And then they locked eyes yet again, staring, gazing, examining them as if they were deciphering constellations within galaxies that they could only decipher themselves.
"Who," Neville asked. Draco was about to speak but he got confused. Who was he engaged to? Legally it was Greengrass, in his heart and on his finger, it was Harry.
"This is totally not fair!" Draco refused to let go. "I would've caught it if you weren't there! You absolute git."
The cannons boomed and Draco had to resist everything inside him to run to Dumbledore, tell him to stop this. Draco's hair stood on edge. It never did that unless his father was towering over him.
Reborn. Forgotten, then remembered, as someone new, as someone less damaged, as someone who was alive.
And couldn't he pretend for just one second that he and Harry were going in to lay on their bed and cuddle and share gossip and kiss until morning? Couldn't he pretend for one second?
"I know you do," Draco tucked Harry in and wrapped his arms around him, Harry's bum fitting into the curve of his hips.
Taken aback, several hesitant seconds passed before Draco spoke. "Don't act so innocent. You laugh at people, too. You pick on people, too. You bloody helped me come up with this plan."
"Since when do you give two shits to what anybody thinks! You're Harry bloody Potter! You couldn't give a damn what everybody thought if you tried!"
"I'm pretty sure that'd be funny for everyone. Keep it coming, Ferret," he smirked, and Draco rolled his eyes.
And then he sucked him deeper. And then he picked up a rhythm, though uneven at first. Draco lost any ability to think as he gripped the sheets and threw his head back. "Harry! Fuck fuck fuck!
"We're skipping this." He cut it off and fast forwarded to his recovery, where most of his bones were broken, his face smashed in.
Draco did, under the cloak with Harry. They held hands as they walked down the hall, wishing one day they wouldn't have to be under the cloak, but also terrified for what would happen once the world found out. If they went through this much trouble without the world knowing... what would happen when it did?
He ran to him, Draco sprinting as fast as he could and they met at the bottom of the hill, Harry with open arms, Draco, too, but despite their momentum, Harry didn't feel a thing when they connected, he was so numb.
"You almost died." His breaths became shallow, but Harry stroked his back to calm him down. His touch didn't bring that kind of comfort anymore.
"So, if Potter is in a tournament in which all his senses must be on edge, a tournament he could get seriously injured- hell, die in, wouldn't it be a shame if he lost said senses?"
The words tugged at his stomach. Sirius once told him that. And the ache of thinking of Sirius made him leave, only to call on his way out, "He never was one."
Harry then drank the hot chocolate and had a few bites of the pumpkin pasty. It took effort to allow himself to enjoy this, but he did it. Because he should enjoy this. It was one of the first things that brought him joy in quite a while. "How was your day?"
“Tori!” The nickname made her heart flutter. “That’s so cute! I want to give you a nickname too! How about Drackiepoo!”
"I-I... I didn't think about it. I didn't think it would bother you, I just wanted to talk to you before I heard anything else... I wanted to be responsible," he spoke unconfidently.
Ron. Ron was in the hospital because of Draco. He tried murdering his best friend, almost murdering Harry in the process. Harry tried to keep down the need to vomit as he stood up from the cold stone floor. He found the Room in ruins.
Harry felt the back of his eyes burn. Draco seriously remembered that from almost five years ago? A few tears fell from his eyes, and his heart throbbed out of his chest.
“It’s not as extravagant as our last first date, but it works. You really outdid yourself there, I have to say.”
Hermione tried arguing, but as she did so, Harry cast a spell, tying Draco's shoes together without his knowledge, sending him to the ground unexpectedly. Pansy whipped around to him, mouth dropped.
“Just like the one I’m going to run away with,” Harry shouted before throwing himself at Draco and causing the crying boy to fall back on the couch.
"Yes, but most the time I was thinking about you." Harry rolled his eyes. "What, don't tell me when you were at the Weasley's you didn't think of me once!"
"Yeah. Like how your father hates Muggle-borns, but the opposite." Which was a bizarre thing to hear from Draco's point of view. How could you hate magic? There once was a time when Draco thought magic was superior. "And they hated it enough that they sort of hid it from me growing up, so I never knew I was a wizard."
"Years. I feel so embarrassed to even tell you that. But I just hate... sitting in this silence. Hating how you look is exhausting, and it makes you feel so alone. And you wouldn't even know that because you're so gorgeous."
This is not meant to be a model relationship or seen in any way as attractive. Please avoid ever copying anything from 6th year and in scenes like this into your own lives. 10/10 times, if someone treats you this way, they will never change. Listen to your body, it knows best.
"Let go of me," Draco struggled, his eyes fixed on Harry. The sound of him crying brought Draco physical pain.
Then, Harry reached for Draco's necklace, but Draco covered it with his hand. "I've never taken this off."
"Oh and don't think big bad Malfoy won't make the train ride hell for you, Mr. Boy Who Always Causes Trouble."
It was like falling through a cloud, looking up into the stars to see galaxies and darkness as gravity pulled you so seemingly fast, it was if you were flying instead, whole body exploding in pure ecstasy from the standing hairs on the back of your neck, all the way to your toes.
They were barefoot and in their pajamas, hair a mess. Harry wasn’t wearing glasses, and the only source of light was coming from a few candles Draco had lit.
"When Voldemort inducted him to being a death eater, he felt to strengthen his followers he would force young couples to marry. The Malfoy's, knowing about you and Draco's 'fake affair' decided to it was best if he married to make sure his feelings weren't real."
The blonde smiled widely at that. "Good," he whispered. "You are. With me. You always will be." He grabbed Harry's hand, which was lingering on his face, and kissed the top of it. "I wish we would have made it 100 kisses instead of 1000." He spoke the truth, and his lips were already tired.
"Hey, Pansy," Draco asked blatantly. They were both in his bedroom so they didn't have anyone around.
"Draco, I have to," he kissed his forehead. He climbed over Draco and kneeled next to him, stroking his hair.
"Damn it, Pansy, I have to see that every potions class! I have to think about wanting to mess it up even more every time I see him! Don't even get me started about Quidditch! And his glasses, oh Merlin, his glasses! They are stupidly perfect for his stupid face!"
So instead, Draco sought back to sabotage Harry's assignment but adding extra frog liver and the Gryffindor found himself in the hospital wing with a deformed arm due to an explosion. Draco was with him the entire time in the hospital wing, laughing his head off.
"Draco, You know I hate seeing you like this. I hate seeing you so pale and I hate that you aren't getting any sleep. I hate that you never eat, only do when I force you to. I hate that I can feel your rib age right now. And I hate that you are so weak, and that you cry constantly. But you know what I hate the most of it all?"
"H-How about," Draco blushed, pulling it away, "after exams. It'll give us some motivation to keep studying."
"This concept that you can't move on until every mystery is solved, every crime is stopped. The world is still big and bad things happen. It's not fair that you're not letting yourself heal." Harry's jaw poked out. "I know you might not think it, but Dr. Valerie is an excellent resource. She may be able to help you find some ground."
Harry froze in his tracks. "Stop saying that word," Harry hissed, his voice turning dangerous. "I won't help you."
"You would have been abused regardless of what size your body was because you lived with abusers. It's what they do."
"Because sympathy peels back the shell I've made. That part of me will get me killed if I let it out. I like staying numb to everything and right now I'm numb and if you give me any form of empathy, I'll stop being numb and I don't have the capacity to go there. We need to talk about something else."
"Right," Harry nodded, squeezing Draco's hand with a bit more power than he had before he left. "Good plan."
"That's not surprising." Wind blew the February air, causing Potter to shiver. His clothes were soaked, and so was his towel.
Draco looked at it and gulped. "But Harry, it's so big! I don't know if it'll fit," Draco played it off.
Still pinning him to the ground, Draco backed up just a bit to the point in which he could lift Harry's shirt. If it was they two alone, he would of most definitely started rocking their hips together, but that wasn't the biggest prize tonight. Nope. Not at all.
“Ow, Harry,” he complained, but Harry heard him laugh, so he kissed the back of his neck, as well as the side, as a reward. “Get off of me!”
Harry undid Draco's arms, took a small amount of flour and threw it in his face. Draco dropped his mouth in an 'o' and a few grains fell from his face. He then provided to pick a small teaspoon full of flour and threw it back at Harry. They then started grabbing more and more and before Harry ran behind a table and took cover, he grabbed a fist full of white powder.
They walked thought the door. It was a purple shop with display cases surrounding. Green velvet inside the glass boxes made all the jewelry pop, the stones absolutely glisten.
"You want to know what I see when I look at you," he finally met his eyes and his heart burned, "I see a bloody engagement ring for Astoria Fucking Greengrass—fucking soulmate? I see you two talking at breakfast in the Great Hall, and I see you two walking each other to class-"
"I dunno. Try not to freak out about things. See, you're not very different from everybody else after all." Draco ran a hand through Harry's hair, but felt nothing but sweat and oil. He tried to speak softly. "When was the last time you bathed?"
" I want you to forget about me. Okay? Can you promise me that? It was just a relationship we had, it was all just a game, wasn't it?"
But it went noticed to Draco's ignorance, and Pumblechook knew how to get under the slytherin's skin. The next time he turned in a page of lines, the professor stared ever so rudely at his arm.
He could be learning about memory loss for a school project. Draco and him could still be dating, but they need to keep it hidden, so Draco won't acknowledge him in fear of Pumblechook catching them. Draco wasn't sneering at him in the hallways. He was just trying to keep him and Harry safe. It was kind of him. He was doing it out of love.
"Do you not want him to sleep at all tonight," Draco glared at her, and then looked back at Harry, who had a tear slipping down his cheek. "Hey now," he wiped it away with his thumb, "Everything's okay. You're safe now."
It was like an ugly monster came out of him as Ron talked about food. "You don't care about Draco, do you? You don't think he's right for me. You want him to keep forgetting me, don't you, so we don't end up together."
They gave each other a lingering look, and Harry walked away in the hopes that Draco would call for him, but step by step, it got quieter and quieter and Harry hated it. He hated everything. He should have listened to Snape, he shouldn't have come.
"Draco," Harry said, letting his name roll off of his tongue. "Love saved us today. Don't be so afraid of it."
There hadn't been any footsteps, so Harry's mouth dropped at the sight of him. Harry grabbed his wand and marched towards him, but Malfoy remained still, and once only a few inches apart, Malfoy said, "Hey, you."
"I wouldn't be a traitor to him. I wouldn’t serve the people who want him murdered. I wouldn’t be a fifthly Death Eater.” An awkward silence passed. Because even if he felt bad about what he did, there was nothing that could take away the pain he brought Harry this entire year, and what he would continue to do.
"Shut up," Draco said, but he could feel the blush creep up his neck. It was a fake blush. If anything, it was the feeling of exposure—Potter knew he had a crush on him, and he didn't run.
Draco stared forward, his lips pursed as he thought. "We need a campaign. Get everyone to jump on the 'hate Potter' train like they should be. He's made people gawk over him long enough. How can he succeed if everyone is cheering for someone else?"
"I must've been in Azkaban longer than I thought," Lucius gave a laugh looking around the room. "Are you the Potter expert?"
"It's not that type of pain, Draco," Harry reached out and smoothed Draco's damp hair out of his face, admiring it. Harry moved his other hand over his chest and Draco watched him. "Here. It hurt's a lot here. It feels... strange. Like we're... like we're connected." His eyes watered at the thought of their previous times. "I don't want you to-"
"We had our first real date here," Harry swallowed again his throat burning and tears cascaded down his face, "And we fought here. And we kissed here. And we made out... a lot... here. And we slept here. Not sex, but sleeping." Harry stared out into the moonlit lake, and back around at the trees, and it seared to do so.  "And you proposed to me here."
"Bring Sirius back. That's all I want." And it was something he would never get. Ever. No matter what. Because that's how death works. Cruel and cold and sadistic. Unfair. Monstrous. Inhumane.
“I wouldn’t want them too, I want you all to me,” Harry made his way to Draco’s neck, “I want you like this only with me.” The heat from the water caused them to sweat, and Harry could taste it as he kissed his throat. Draco went into a visible state of bliss and his eyes rolled in pleasure, groaning as his starvation was being fed. “Look at yourself, over there in the mirror. I want you to see yourself like this. Just us two.”
Harry sat down in his usual spot at the Gryffindor table, next to Ron and Hermione. Thankfully Ron and him made up after the first task when he came to his senses. He immediately shoveled scrambled eggs onto his plate with a piece of bacon and a slice of toast. Ron was already finished and slurping in his pumpkin juice while Hermione was chewing on a sausage.
They decided to meet in the forest at 8:00, but Harry hadn't shown up, and Draco knew it was well past 8:00. The sun was down, hiding from the world, stars not even shining as bright as he could remember. Or maybe he just couldn't see the light anymore.
Harry first looked like he'd been punched in the face. "Of course I am. Why would you say that? That is the stupidest fucking question—"
"Harry," Draco asked drowsily, but concerned. Harry was yelling again, and Draco grabbed his hand, only for him to stop all sounds completely. Suddenly Harry awoke only 6 hours into his treatment.
"There won't be one," Pumblechook said, and then he went back to his table to review the closing statement.
"It was amusing. You're right, this friendship thing could work if all you do is get hurt around me." Draco nodded. "So does this mean I win? I caught the snitch."
"Ho-okay," Pansy said wiping a tear from her eyes, "We cannot stop there! We need to get Potter to develop a crush on you! I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical, but now, this is way too good of a plan to not continue!"
"Yes. Unless someone tries to erase it again, there should be no concern about him losing his memory."
"I know," Draco whispered, putting his chin in Harry's shoulder. "I'm sorry I was stupid. I should have been there for you."
"Mr. Potter, I'm a part of your care team. Dr. Morgan. I specialize in the restoration process and rehabilitation of eating disorders." She gave a smile, but then said, "I'm sorry to say that your treatment is not going to be as easy, and it's going to take some time. Right now, you've been receiving nutrients and hydration from your IV's. Our goal is to transition you to a liquid diet. Because you haven't eaten in so long, food is now a foreign object in your body and we don't want to shock it. So liquid for a few days, and then we'll start off on easy foods, alongside a bulking potion. It will make you gain weight and muscle to a healthy amount. Then, hopefully, we'll be able to get you to a good range of physical health with these potions and spells within the week."
"My father only said five," Draco corrected. "I have more faith in you than you think. It was a compliment actually."
"Hey, Ron," Harry called, interrupting them without his eyes leaving Draco, whom was with Pansy and Blaise about twenty feet ahead, talking.
“Of course,” Draco answered, “I feel like before every fight or insult there would be a brief pause and we would look into each others eyes and ask ourselves if the other was being real or not. Most of the time we had good communication though.”
"Now, we could stay here for 7 minutes and sprint to class, barely make it, or we can finish this up now and make it there on time," Draco gave the options.
"She was only twenty-eight when he died, and then she died at seventy-four, just a few months after I stopped seeing her."
"I don't want to go any further." Harry rolled his eyes back and bent his knees. "What are you doing?"
He searched for Harry's hand under the covers, but Harry had rolled over, his back facing Draco like a wall, breathing evenly. Draco debated on waking him, but chose to roll over, too, because it had been so long since Harry had been able to sleep. And Draco had been forced to console himself for several years now.
Harry can't know. He couldn't read his script now, he couldn't exercise Plan DBR now. He couldn't do this to poor Harry now.
Harry gave a dry laugh. "As for your mother, I'm inviting her no matter what, so either she walks you down the isle, or she's sitting on my side."
"You could have waited," he said through his teeth. "Told him to let you think about it. You could have come to me and I would have helped you."
They were left in the vacated hallway, it dark and eerie. The two walked in silence, both fuming for different reasons. Harry wanted to spark a conversation but didn't know how to. He could tell Draco was livid.
"You want to know what I'm thinking? Fine! I'm thinking about how I'm scared to death right now because of you! You-Know-Who lives in my house, Harry! Every single day I wake up knowing he's with my family and he could hurt them at any given moment. Think about going home this summer! He might look through my mind and see I'm with you and I would be dead in minutes after he tortured me into giving up all information possible about you! And if i fail him. you don't know what its like! If you fail him, you die. You don't get it.
But when Draco grabbed Harry's hand and locked their fingers together, Harry finally reacted to the monstrosity that he caused. His eyes filmed over as he looked at Draco's face, and he blinked away tears to find Draco sobbing. Harry couldn't feel Draco squeeze his hand harder, with the most strength he had.
The mumbling class chatter ceased when he walked in front of the group of Slytherins and Gryffindors, them all staring at him in awe.
At least Harry was untouched by the Dark Lord, safe and sound. For now. It was like Harry's reality was untouched over the summer while Draco's was inverted, flipped, and ripped apart. "I can't believe I lasted so long without you."
"Harry, come sit down," Draco said softly. He approached him and unbuttoned his suit jacket, pulling it off of him. Harry didn't quite move.
Draco sniffed, and he let a tear slip, anyway. It was seldom Draco ever did such a thing. "I'm sorry, I just keep thinking in my head that this is the last time we'll be together." Draco wiped the tear by burying his head into Harry's shirt. And then he swallowed harshly. "And now I'm thinking about how I would never allow myself to cry, but I am right now with no question because you taught me how to be a human." He let out a sob.
"My parents. That was the first time I ever knew what they looked like, and they smiled at me, like they wanted me."
"More like a fit! We thought you were having a spaz attack or something," Seamus squeaked across the room, two beds to his left.
"I thought there wasn't any more breaking in to places," Mr. Weasley joked, but then he saw Harry's face, filled with tears and pale with absolute terror.
"You never know." She handed it to him, eyeing the place where a piece of parchment marked his spot. "You're nearly done with it. He must not have written a lot."
"Voldemort's causing my nightmares," He said between panicked breaths. "H-He's in my head—Arthur Weasley's been attacked! I saw it in my dreams."
"If you say so," Draco smiled, and he licked the length of it, and put the mouth on the tip of it, kissing it.
"Think about it. Me, the 'eye candy' according to you, of the Wizarding World, and baddie Draco Malfoy turns out to be a teddy bear and their both completely in love with each other. Surely girls obsess over things like that and I mean, who could blame them, if I was standing on an outside point of view, it would be like a dream come true—what?" At this point, Draco just stared at him, stopping all listening as he focused on one statement.
"He didn't. He just wishes he could have been there for Fred, too," Harry said solemnly. Molly stopped all movement before starting again.
I just don't know what to do. Draco said that. But he meant that he didn't know how to break Harry's heart, how to handle this situation, how to protect Harry without hurting him and hurting himself. Not what to do during sex. Well, he didn't really know that either. But now was not the time to think about it.
Harry smiled, but there were still so many people around. Harry raised an eyebrow and Draco shook his head.
Draco looked at him with wild eyes. "Merlin Potter, do you need to be put in a loony bin? We never hung out before!"
"I told you you could smile. And you can do it damn well, too."  Harry laughed and then climbed back onto his broom.  Draco still hadn't moved. "Come on then, slowpoke!"
"I wish it didn't happen." Draco frowned. Because at the start of the plan, Diggory dying would have been a bit of a help to get Harry to fall for him faster, but he'd never actually thought it would happen. And now that it did, he realized what a cruel thought that was.
Molly came to the door and Arthur saw that the rest of their family was on the couch. It was getting dark, and was probably late.
Harry paused in thought. "Anything! What if I fought Voldemort with it?" A sudden burning pulse went up Draco's arm.
"Please just announce it to the whole school, Hermione," Harry snapped, raising his head again, facing her.
"You're delusional Potter! You tell me what you mean by that right now. What did I see in that memory!?"
"Yes," he almost bit, but restrained himself from it. Harry didn't let go of his cheek, in fact, he stroked his thumb over his cheekbone. Draco wanted him off, to stop looking him in those eyes. He grabbed Harry by the hip and snaked his left arm around his waist so Harry didn't have a chance to see it. He would fix the sleeve with a spell later. But it made his Mark
" Harry grit. "You're so jealous and I just want you to know how much I want you and like you and it's so bloody frustrating because you're being such a pain in the arse all the time!"
"No, you shouldn't have. He made sure that you didn't. You're not to blame at all. Don't feel guilty for it." She kissed his forehead.
"I can't help it," he turned away and laughed. "Let me do you and you tell me you can keep a straight face."
All the couples sat together at morning breakfast no matter the house, except for Draco and Harry, who walked down together as but separated during breakfast, just to make the statement that they rejected Valentine's Day.
The Daily Prophet was bent and messy, but he could still read the headline printed across the paper:
Draco shut his eyes and tilted his head to the sensation so those lips had a larger canvas to paint. "What would you do if this was Astoria right now?"
