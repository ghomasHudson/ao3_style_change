He shot her a look that said
"On my first day visiting Gringotts, someone tried to steal something from a vault. I had seen that what was in the vault was small, and was told it was going to Hogwarts where it would be safer. The person tried to steal it too late. I, er, came across some knowledge that it was something between the two of you. I really don't want to use whatever it is, it's just that I think one of my professors is trying to sneak in and get it."
"Right," Draco said, drawing Pansy and Teddy's eyes by
And with his name, he’ll always get off too easily. Who would dare give the great Harry Potter detention?
Harry looks up at Ron and Hermione. Both of them look as if someone has died, and he doesn't understand; he just told the snake not to hurt Justin, and it listened.
“And I don’t blame you at all for that,” Harry continued. “We’re just scared of powerful wizards after what the Lord of the Waste did to us. You wouldn’t do that, and if you want, I can go back and spread the word that you’re actually a good wizard and not an evil one?”
"The most notable case of documented time travel in public record is from 1899, when Eloise Mintumble used a time turner to travel back to 1402. She survived the travel back in time but became stuck there. They don't mention why, but it's almost as if her presence created a new timeline."
"Mr. Potter." Snape’s voice stops him before he can escape the dungeons.
"You're
. How is it any different from when I was old?"
“I will,” he promises, and watches as Harry disappears with another soft pop.
"Listen, Tom, we have to go, if the basilisk comes--"
Draco brushes him off and turns to lead his friends back to the common room, but stops when he gets a better look at Goyle's face. "Are you wearing
"Muah," Harry says, pressing a wet kiss to the man's already wet cheek.
"Yes, well somehow the Unspeakables were able to pull her out of 1402 after five days, which again, they don't mention." Hermione sighs. "But when they tried to bring her back to the present, her body aged as if she'd lived the entire five hundred years, and she died shortly after in St. Mungo's. She had altered the timeline even only staying for five days, and several people were un-born due to their ancestors' actions changing history.
Teddy came in just then, and stopped in shock when he saw Harry. “You’re young!”
"You will not."
?" They remind him somehow of Harry's and he does not want to be reminded again of the other timeline in which he and Harry are friends. Somehow his mouth keeps talking as his thoughts go down a gnome hole, and he stupidly adds, "I didn't know you could read."
Harry's small fingers trace the man's lips as he talks, and the man breaks into a watery smile.
"No. I mean, I did see some Death Eaters, but it was definitely in the past." He doesn't mention that he's pretty sure his and Ron's parents were there. Time is ticking and they have to stop Snape. "I'm going to stop him."
During their first flying lesson, he notices that Potter seems friendly with Longbottom, and takes advantage of this fact to get his attention. It works, and what’s more, it seems to get Potter in trouble with his Head of House.
"You're no slouches yourselves from what I hear," Mr. Longbottom says.
“You do always ask the difficult questions. The truth is that I don’t know. No one knows much about time, or time travel. Y- Some people I know are working on it, but it's a slow process. Strange things happen when people meddle with time, according to the textbooks, but is it meddling when you can’t help it? When you just disappear and have no idea where or when you’ll end up?
“Oh. Really? Er, I don’t want to be rude or anything, but- this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.”
But things just get worse from there. Dobby declares that unless Harry says he’ll stay with the Dursleys this year, Dobby won’t give him the letters he’s been keeping from Harry. And as if that all wasn’t bad enough, when Harry doesn’t agree, Dobby pushes Aunt Petunia’s pudding off the counter and gets Harry in more trouble than he can bear to think about.
"It's happening," he tells Ron excitedly, throwing the cloak over his shoulders and grabbing his wand from his back pocket. His hands have already begun to feel too large and too small, and his heart is beating fast.
He kneels down beside Potter, who is still except for the tremors that wrack his body, eyes half-lidded as he stares at Severus in stark terror and… determination. “Potter, can you hear me?” he murmurs.
"The Quill must have been laced with something, Draco, scoot over so he can sit." Draco, gaping slightly, shifts on the couch, swinging his legs off and scooting over to one side.
The race against the clock for Draco is to get them to Slughorn to remedy this curse, and so in the duration of their journey there will be mentions of several attempts made (mostly non-explicit ones), and Harry gradually becoming aware of the curse.
He tugs Harry's right sleeve up and stares at his hand. Draco, too, stares.
Potter looks resigned as he opens his mouth, bringing his left hand up to steady the vial as he drinks it. The colour is finally returning to his face. He still looks too pale, but at least his skin doesn’t have that sickly grey pallor anymore.
"Well,” she stares at Harry for a second too long, then takes the register back. “Twenty quid for the room,"
His hand, for once, isn't glamoured. And it looks fucking terrible.
saying something.
"You're making a mistake," Rosier grits around her grip and the woman chuckles. She actually pats his ruined cheek. Harry watches through blurred gaze in morbid fascination. The edges of his vision have started darkening.
He gives the man a look. He's planning something, he's always planning something, but if Harry's off behavior is anything to go on, he's not going to like it. He has yet to see what an angry Harry can do beyond hurling insults in school corridors.
He turns his eyes away from the sight and groans through the stinging process.
"Draco," Harry starts.
"All those names I called you, the times I antagonized you. I know it's long overdue" The pride he’d thought would make the words difficult is surprisingly absent.
He does believe that the end justifies the means, but who decides what is the end?
Severus resists the urge to close his eyes, and pulls out a vial of pepper up potion from his robes. It’s not ideal, at all, but it’ll have to do. Keeping Potter alive is more important than thinking about the repercussions of potion use and its effects on Potter's damaged body.
"Even though we invented it on the spot and Harry might have no idea what we're talking about," Ron interjected with a wince.
There are faded posters stuck to the narrow walls, aged over time in a way that indicates they're part of them now, and cannot be separated, there are whispers within the breaks, damp and wheezing. Anything and everything can be found here.
Well, he could have done that. “Smart girl,” he murmurs, opening the vial and swallowing it down. His body perks up instantly, and he inhales deeply the smell of beer and sweat. He slams the empty vial down on the coffee table, and turns to the kids.
"Twat."
"No, Evan. You will,"
"We can make it that far." He says, without a grain of doubt in his voice, his hand is fucking shaking and probably cramping from the cold but he looks confident in his word. "Then we can find this Slugborn--"
Draco has one arm flung over Harry, their legs touching, as they huddle together in one relatively warm corner. It takes Harry the entirety of five minutes to think that perhaps it IS the heat coming off of Draco that’s making them so hot.
Potter won't stand for it. Most probably. But Severus is not taking any chances.
Evan hums with pain and in vehement agreement. Anything, he'll do
He should. He can’t even stand straight. His legs are cramping. He forgot to wear shoes or slippers. The gritty sand itches at the soles of his feet. His knees are almost knocking together with how badly he’s trembling.
Draco was ten at the time, holding his chin high and nodding along, pretending that he knew how the world was run.
"How do I know you're Remus, though?" He abruptly says, raising his wand again. The thought had come to him suddenly, and it leaves him feeling cold and scared again, even though he did his best to keep his face carefully blank.
"That's mean," Harry frowns.
Harry quirks an eyebrow at him, "Oh you think so?"
"You wouldn't get it. It's a pureblood thing," Draco briefly explains, quickly wiping his mouth with a napkin. Harry waits for him to elaborate.
"I do."
Of course, that stupid one-sided rivalry is only because Draco is focusing so hard
Draco's hands shake as he retrieves the clothing and slowly closes the lid again. He stumbles back to Harry and the bag.
It's kind of painful to look at Harry and think of food, he had always been painfully scrawny, a little bit of weight that he might have gained during their stay in the cottage, is now just going to fly out of the window.
Crouching down, he puts his ear right next to the keyhole. He knows he is being nosy, but goddamnit, he's been kept in the dark for so long.
“What are
The three words shock Draco so much that for a second all he can do is stagger back a few steps, his heart thudding and ears pounding.
Harry doesn't take the bait. "Do the others know I'm alright? Sirius, and Remus and my friends. Do they know I'm alive?"
"You're Harry James Potter," he breathes, "And this is just a dream. This has to be a dream,"
"You won't have to, the salve just has to sit on the cuts for an hour so you won't die of infection." Honestly, does Potter
"Take it or I swear to Merlin…" he doesn't finish the sentence and Draco just resigns.
"Well, I didn't intend to poison
"So you do not believe that Harry Potter's relatives were specifically targeted to send out a clear message?"
And when Draco acts as if he wants him, Harry feels sugar cubes melting in his chest. So even in sleep, in the calm lull of the moving train, when Draco holds him, Harry feels marginally calm.
"Oh shut up. It is gross. Our hands were filthy."
She cannot take it anymore, "SHUT UP!"
What the fuck are they going to do?
"That's not what you should be asking, Weasley! You should be asking how much he's heard!"
"Harry, just tell him," Draco cuts in, frowning at Harry. What was there to hide now?
Potter lets out a groan, turning his head away from the vial at his mouth, but Draco firmly plants a hand against his face, holding his head in place as he urges him to drink, more furiously than before.
"You can always sober up with a potion--"
Harry stares at him for a second, "There's a bag?"
He clears his throat, "So, Leaky Cauldron?"
"What is up with the nicknames?" he asks instead of approving or disapproving it.
He needs Sirius to do this, though. This is important. For Sirius' own sake. He needs to get out of this funk he's crawled into. Day drinking and naked roaming, and bitter sulking.
"He's not a baby, Moody, he knows his way up the stairs," Bill snaps, his eyes losing some of their previous humor.
He finally manages to get a hold of his wand, it slips into his palm and he's shouting, fumbling, the wand movements all wrong, "Reducto!" Somehow, as if sensing his desperation, the spell fires, right at her face.
He was right before. It hurts a lot more than the first time around. Instead of a severe stinging in his chest, it's tantamount to someone slashing his chest open and digging in with sharp nails. Over and over again.
Harry pretends not to hear him again, he pulls out rolls of bandages, two out of the five Draco had packed. He wants to argue but Harry gives him a look. Then quickly leans for a kiss.
"You could call me a sewage rat and I would still feel special. You have no idea how long I've wanted this," certainly longer than he’d convinced himself of.
"I feel like it's September first, with all these—" is the first thing he hears once Harry is jolted out of his bizarre dream. He ignores Draco and raises his head from the boy's lap, rubbing a hand over his clammy face.
"You were leaving," Potter says, and Draco hums, noncommittal.
'Because of the color?' Draco had blurted out the first thing off the top of his head. He was so eager to please the man as a kid. He wasn't that wrong though, the anti-inflammatory potion did have a very vivid orange color that bordered on red.
"Hmm, deep enough," she comments, turning his hand over a few times before looking up at him. "Your next detention is on Wednesday. Two pm, sharp. I would hate it for you to be late, young man."
"Alright," Sirius starts, clad in only a blue robe and his pajamas underneath. He didn't spend his morning preparing for this, he’d almost drank three more bottles of beer during breakfast. Really, they should be grateful he’s sober and present at all.
"You got a kick out of bullying me?” Harry’s eyebrows shoot up but the grin stays in place, “Nice to know."
Harry helplessly looks at his flushed cheeks, his bloodstained shirt and back to his face, his eyes moving restlessly under his lids. He probably has an infection. And while Harry is used to dealing with injuries with almost no supplies at all, even he doesn’t have anything to help him with. The water pitcher is gone.
Severus doesn't do anything for a beat, and then he moves as if to take the vial but instead seizes Potter's wrist and pulls the whole boy forward as Harry squeaks in surprise.
"And why do you suppose I'm no longer the butcher?"
Harry stirs when a sharp knocking raps the door right behind him, he almost jumps out of his skin, scrambling, reaching for his wand, until Aunt Petunia's shrill voice cries out, "Get up! Get up! The breakfast isn't going to cook itself, get up!"
"My cherry in french?"
Draco gently coaxes the bag out of Harry's grasp, rolls up the coat, and the shirt into a tight roll, and places it under the vials so they don't break.
He walks, feigning ignorance for about two floors down, and turns a corner and waits instead of going forward, and when she turns too, he speaks, grabbing her forearm to keep her from bolting, delighting in the small spark of satisfaction when Pansy jumps. This conversation has been long overdue.
Draco stares at Harry. The boy sitting in front of him is so different from the one who’d been his archnemesis in school for over four years. The one he used to bully and the one who used to give back as good as he got. Most people wouldn’t dare stand up to him, a Malfoy.
"What's going on?" He asks.
"What?!"
Dementors.
His eyes land on a stool with an empty vase resting beside the couch. For a second, he just stares.
"Our benefactor,” Harry jerks his thumb towards where Draco is keeping their wallet. “To Dave?"
Next chapter update, 18th June, Friday. In the two Fridays between that, we’ll be posting two interludes. Hope that makes up for the delay!
Potter is frowning now, his eyes half open and glazed over. “It’s just a blood replenisher, Potter. Surely, even someone as incompetent in Potions as you should know what it is supposed to do.”
He's so glad it's partially back.
hated it. It was a mess, but Draco was always grateful there’s only one of it.
Before he can answer her, Harry’s hoarse voice breaks through, “What’s your name?”
He doesn't want to think about anything anymore, and Harry could do anything that he wanted. Draco doesn't care.
“How much do pain relievers help?” Severus asks as he pulls away the last roll and the small cloth of dittany, starting to dab away at the crusted blood with a wet rag he had conjured.
Twinky returns, only an hour later to take the bowl away with a quiet apology, and Harry lets her. He's sprawled next to Draco, his eyes drooping with exhaustion and his limbs shaking in earnest in spite of his apathetic mood.
"I'm not a ministry fanatic secretary, obsessed with pink, Ron. I'm just worried about you guys. This could backfire terribly."
"I'm sorry, I know," then he purses his lips, and amends, "No, I don't actually know that, just, ignore me. Sorry."
, that’s what his father would say. Don’t let her know. And money can open so many doors. A door to a muggle motel room? HE shouldn’t even have to try. "We are in a pinch, ma'am. I am willing to compensate for any trouble this might cause. We're just staying the night."
Happy birthday to our dear Harry, and anyone born on July 31st! We thought you guys deserved a little treat!
It was just a dream. Nothing more. Even though he can't, for the life of him, imagine why he'd dream of such a thing. He had never even heard of half the spells Bellatrix had used. How had his mind come up with
locket, currently lies on a table. Forlorn and utterly mundane looking.
" There is a scowl on Harry's face, which is decidedly more hostile than anything Harry could've made towards Severus.
"Let me see your hand, Mr. Potter," she continues as Harry slowly gets up to his feet, his hand knuckle-white around the quill and his other hand drowned in blood. He walks up to her with a hidden grimace.
As they round the last corner towards Lucius’ study, Severus sees him. He is standing by the doorway, cane in hand, and his hair in a loose ponytail, he looks strangely poised as he meets Draco’s eyes and then nods at Severus. He has a bundle of cloth draped over this other arm.
“The most I, or anyone for that matter, could give you at this stage is nerve soothing agents,” Severus hesitates, wondering if he really needs to tell Potter this, but then the boy looks up at him with those eyes, looking so stoic even as he trembles, even as his eyes betray his fear. All he sees for a beat is Lily's eyes, staring at him across the room in an order meeting, a fussy baby on her lap, she was furiously determined. Afraid and determined at once.
"But was it fun?"
"She's the worst!"
"We might need to bring in the new rookies soon." Murphy continues, eyeing the abundance of paper planes hovering above them.
Draco's hand itches around his wand, and there's a tiny voice inside his head, telling him that he needs to give Potter something
again. But the look on Malfoy's face says it all. He looks horrified, and past Harry's shoulder, at the woman standing behind her.
Draco wants to protest, but he shuts up and just shoves the damned thing down his throat without thinking about it.
Harry finally looks back at Sirius properly, whose expression is calmer now. Relatively. He can't tell whether it's because of him, or Harry himself. "Does it matter? I'm alive and safe, and he wants me."
Because he cannot, not even in the furthest corners of his mind, imagine a way out of this, he cannot feel his hands, he cannot find his wand even though it's right in his pockets. Everything is too dim, under a moving veil of blackness. And it all feels numb from the cold. Even his mind. His thoughts are lethargic, hesitant. He had felt like this before.
"They won't come back to life by you drying up like a twig. Drink, Albus," Severus repeats. The man stares at him for a long moment and then drinks the water. Severus nods, taking the glass away from him. Albus summons the small piece of paper from the floor wandlessly, his eyes flicking over the loopy handwriting.
"I'm not going to their funeral. Aunt Marge might be there… and just, no. I don't want to deal with them anymore." Harry’s hands trace the edges of the packet, not opening it yet.
And suddenly, he can breathe again. He's standing on solid ground again and he trips. And would have fallen face-first on the ground if not for the hand that wraps around his arm to steady him.
Harry, on foot with no clothes… and he has the audacity to be sick.
He's in the backyard, in the mirror, curled into himself and crying as quietly as he can in the storm because he knows that if Aunt Petunia hears him crying, making a fuss, attracting attention… she might never let him back in.
Thank you for your time, we hope you stay safe! Stay tuned, we would love to know your views!
The door silently creaked open, revealing a narrow gloomy hallway, lit by bubbles of flickering lights attached to the walls, where the wallpapers have long peeled.
And he swears, actually swears that Harry has no idea that he's being watched. He could be staring right into Draco's eyes and he wouldn't be able to tell afterwards. It's bugging Draco.
"Horace?" Albus’ eyes have snapped towards the fireplace, and he’s attempting to stand up. Severus stifles the urge to roll his eyes and moves closer, ready in case the man takes a tumble.
There are no more cooking incidents, and Draco grudgingly admits that Harry's cooking is a pleasant surprise in the sea of one bleak fiasco after the other. They have breakfast, Harry changes Draco's bandages after he's showered, and then goes to take a shower himself. He's out in less than seven minutes, his hair a right dripping mess and his clothes clinging to his body in a way that suggests he hadn't dried himself adequately.
Severus raises his eyebrow at the messy haired boy and then glances around the kitchen with narrowed eyes. "I consider this a victory." He hums. "Nothing is burnt beyond repair, the doors and windows seem to be intact," he sounds utterly serious in spite of his obvious mockery. "There are no corpses around the cottage, all things considered Potter." His eyes land back on Harry. "I'd say you handled yourself well for five days,"
Here’s the first interlude! Hope you guys enjoy it, thanks to our wonderful Beta! Tell us all about your favorite scenes!
Rosier just laughs, "You think this is pain?" His tone is chiding, as if Harry is an unruly kid, misbehaving.
"We're here," Harry points at a star at the bottom of the map, "Warnham." He's on his knees on the chair, and leaning toward the glass.
"Draco?" Harry turns to him, attentive. His hands grab Draco's good shoulder, before the other one resettles against his arm. "Look at me."
“We don’t have much time,” he says.
"What did you expect though?" Ron says, buried nose deep into his own paper. "They've been doing this since the summer break, first with Harry and err-"
Remus snorts, but then says in a more serious voice, "You have the time and the nerve to handle two teenagers.” He shrugs, “One of them is a genius already, the other is too lazy to try, but they're smart kids. They want to learn."
He almost hopes the other boy would jump out of the non-existent shadows with a ‘boo!’ and laughter.
The staff room's other occupants are shocked into a bizarre silence, Pomona and Flitwick exchange an uneasy glance and Sinistra has paused her teacup midair, watching  Minerva with a perplexed frown.
"Maybe you know who got to him. Or Fudge."
Takes place somewhere during chapter twenty two of MSS.
He cannot stomach the thought of putting his eyes together for more than a second, much less sleep anymore. The screams are stuck in his head, worse than Cedric’s death, and so much worse than Mrs. Malfoy’s death. Those times he’d merely been the spectator. This time, he’d been the one doing it.
"Boiled carrots?" Harry asks again, now leaving the knife in favor of the peeler, which is marginally safer since Harry cannot physically peel his own skin with the muggle device. At least, that’s what Draco hopes.
"Care to tell me what is going on here, Mr. Malfoy?" Draco stares at her, absolutely poised, and still, except for his wide eyes, his half-opened bag still in his hands.
He's already sick of seeing himself.
"But you never got around to actually doing it.” Ron isn’t surprised, not really. “I've heard the details from Professor McGonagal,"
He shakes his head as if to dislodge the thought, and turns on the tap, letting the cool water run over his hand. “Just wanted to say hi.” He refuses to look up at the mirror and see his reflection, which could no doubt give Malfoy a run for his money.
They stay there, kneeling in the hay for what feels like an eternity before Harry very slowly peels his arm off from around Draco’s shoulder. Draco throws his head back, squeezing his eyes shut in pain.
The boy in question is in the kitchen right now, banging the cupboard doors and rummaging around, seemingly overly comfortable in the small, but cozy kitchen. Five days have passed, and neither of them has stepped outside the cottage yet. Not even to the porch. Harry tends to glance through the back door or stare at the serene waves outside their windows, but he hasn't even once mentioned strolling outside.
Dinner is awkward. So awkward, in fact, that Harry cannot even imagine the thought of chewing too loudly, and so slightly settles for lightly scraping his fork against his plate. The fork, which thankfully remains in his hand and doesn’t clatter down to the table or floor.
Sirius ignores him, "--And Remus asked me whether I could help my kiddo's friends out and well?" He throws his hands up in mock defeat, "How could I refuse? My generosity knows no bounds."
he tells himself, 'you don't have the guts, nor would it do you any good.'
"No. Tell me that you understand."
"Harry--"
'She's going to kill you, it's only fair that you return the courtesy, Harry.'
"Nobody looks happy about that," Hermione says as she glances at the staff table, noticing, maybe not for the first time, how vacant it seemed. More than half of the staff is absent from the table, with the exception of McGonagall and Snape. And neither looked happy to be there. These past two days haven't been easy on anyone.
"Yes?" Harry's voice is quiet, another sign of his exhaustion.
His fingers trace the book splayed before him, like the wings of a moth, it was unbelievably delicate under his touch. But he wouldn't hurt the book, no, he knew better, the price of fragile things.
It takes everything out of Harry not to pale as the woman mentions Sirius's name. "Yes, I did know that."
He pulls the collar over Draco's head and slowly peels it off his arm and his vision goes entirely white in pain.
He looks at the floor. It's such a sharp contrast to the pristine dark marble floors that he'd seen in his dreams. Before they'd been stained in blood. He can almost see it now. Her twisted broken body, lying limp after what felt like
do it?" He asks under his breath. He can't help it. This, this is the man who outwitted Albus Dumbledore. The same man, Severus can't figure out for the life of him.
"What?" He asks as Harry pulls out his shaking hand. The dim moonlight shines on the silver gleam of the knife. It's a potion knife, small but looks incredibly sharp. No wonder Severus had it on him.
Chapter warnings for; violence, pedicides/multiple child homicides, genocide, mentioned racism and elitism, explicit language, implied/referenced torture.
It infuriates Draco to no end, but he doesn't say anything regarding Potter's haphazard lifestyle. At least he's not leaving wet towels all over the floor, and that's more than good enough for Draco at the moment.
"I'm sorry for teasing,” Harry says, finally unfolding his hands, but then he leans forward, grin widening, “but it is kind of hilarious."
Harry lets out a contented sigh as he relaxes against Draco again, "Most times, I can imagine things more than they are,” he extends a hand and points at the stain, “Like that stain… That's an elephant, can you see the trunk?"
He turns to Draco, his eyes wide and his face pales, "Okay, Draco, I found us water."
The man pauses for a moment, looking around his own store, then gets up from his stool and Draco wants to rear back but the muggle just hums, "Pickled garlic… must be here somewhere."
Next update on Saturday, 29th August.
'Yes, let's make sure. Let's count a hundred and twenty steps, front and back. That way you'll be
"William," it's Moody this time, silently growling.
Oh shit.
All in due time.
Harry doesn’t bloody care. He wants it to stop. He’s past the point of caring about smacking his head back into the ground, or shaking as his every nerve is set alight.
He sits there for a little while, gazing up at the sky as it darkens further, the light bleeds away into inky blackness. It's getting chillier too. Harry wasn't expecting that when he stepped out for his stroll, or else he would have worn one of the Weasley jumpers over Dudley's rags. They all still fit. The first one he had received is only a bit shorter now, the sleeves fall short to the middle of his forearms.
“Hey,” Draco smiles down at him.
He takes in where they are going, and surely enough, they seem to be headed towards her office. Definitely in the opposite direction of the Slytherin dungeons. He slips his wand down his sleeve, running a finger over its tip.
He stands there, not moving. The expression on his face doesn't change. His lanky black hair is falling limply over his eyes; he doesn't bother brushing it away. He stares at the lazy tides with emotionless onyx eyes, washing up against the damp sand.
They searched. They did. Albus has been doing it for months, every nook and cranny, every mattress and pillowcase, because Morris told him, to his face with venomous words, “I have what he gave me,”
"Have our own methods. Don't worry about it." He brushes him off, "I'll consult with Poppy over your file. Maybe allergies are at play. Brighten up, Potter."
The man's eyes trail away from Harry to Draco and they linger, with a deep meaning behind his gaze.
"No,” Harry frowns. “I was reading," and sleeping wouldn’t have been good anyway, one of them had to stay awake lest they miss their stop.
"His flesh is too bitter now," he’d hissed to the snake. "He is frightened. I want him to be sweet and supple for you, Nagini."
"We're both an accomplice! I'm a murderer!" He is near hysterical by now, barely coherent, heaving in choking breaths. He looks about ready to hurl his guts on the floor.
"How do you feel about boiled carrots?" He asks some time later, very cautiously working with the knife on the chopping board. Draco is sitting on one of the chairs, skimming through the book he had found in one of the rooms, the Moonstone one that was filled with his godfather's usual corrections in the corners of the text itself. Even the handwriting exuded smug knowledge. Severus probably had a field day with this book, and if he were just petty enough, he would have actually written to the idiotic author and would have told him a thing or two about the 'delicate art of potion making'.
' I don't know, Jamie Junior, ' the Sirius in his head starts, rather unhelpfully. ' I can see you pulling off the perfect crime. You won't even have to use your wand,'
He has a split second in which he is sure his face contorts in horror, before blind agony bursts through his body. This time, he is aware that he is screaming. His raw throat another added element of pain as he thrashes around. Vaguely, he also feels himself banging his head against- against something hard. Most likely the edge of her work desk. The pain doesn't last, consumed by the rest of his body splitting torture.
"I need it to stop!" Potter bursts out again, shooting out of the chair, before going on in a much subdued voice, "I feel so guilty, I've been pretending all the while with Draco and I cannot do it anymore." Potter exhales, long and slow, exhausted. "I'm a monster."
"And you do know that,” Ron bites his lips for a second, “That I didn't mean to say those things last night either? You know I say a lot of shitty stuff when I'm angry."
Harry pays the fair, even though it sounded a bit overpriced, gets the tickets, and rejoins Draco on the benches. Their bus should arrive in twenty minutes, and thankfully, the benches are empty enough. There's only a lady with her poodle, occupying the seats except for them.
Next update Saturday, 18th April.
Draco closes his eyes. He can feel a headache approaching, pulsing at his temples.
"No, I need to take a blood sample, though I'm fairly certain of the poison's nature. Still, we need to be diligent."
It was so fast. He stares at the back of the disappearing vehicle and breathes. He can't imagine that thing hitting them. It feels faster than his Nimbus 2001. The Firebolt, even. Faster and heavier and made of metal. It would absolutely crush them upon impact.
He tightens his hold on Harry further and hopes he isn’t hurting him. "You have to tell me if something else happens, okay?"
Disclaimer: Despite whatever the canon creators inclinations might be, the fic authors support trans rights.
Rosier jerks his chin at Potter's body. "He's unconscious, basically laid out for us. We're taking them both. Our Lord would be most pleased with our conduct."
"You and your friend's information,” she turns the register over to him, pointing an empty row, “Sign the row after you're done."
Nevertheless, if Minerva hadn't been smart enough to act as shocked and enraged at him as she had, she would probably have been arrested too. As it is, Black managed to disappear before the aurors could gather their wits.
, as Bellatrix Lestrange, deranged and unstable, cursed and tore the other woman. Harry had sensed Snape passively standing by his side, and the Malfoy patriarch on the floor, restrained and staring at his knees with a fixed expression as the younger Malfoy thrashed in his bounds and called for his mother until his throat had been rendered raw.
Draco steps forward, avoids looking at the cursed muffin. "The bakery is right there."
They pass the street, making a swift turn, before Remus stops before a set of matching houses, right in the middle of the street. He reaches a hand in his pocket and pulls out a piece of torn parchment.
"No,” Harry yanks his arm away, “No just piss off," he flexes his fingers, but a few of them don’t move. His face is twisted in pain. And if he’s showing that much expression, it means he’s in a
“I have my duty,” she says, looking like she opened her mouth with some difficulty, “and you have yours.” she looks strikingly like Valentina whenever her face hardens, the harsh cheekbones and the slightly pruned nose, and narrowed black eyes, but as far as Draco is aware, that’s where the resemblance ends.
"Many a wizard, nay, many a soul has wanted what you guys are getting for free. Unlimited access to this beautiful, talented, husky man. You guys should feel so lucky.” Alright, so maybe he did drink one of those beers this morning. But how’s he supposed to deal with two of Harry’s closest friends without it? Go through all of this, do all of this, it’s all a stark reminder that Harry is not here? And Remus had taken off after his puppy dog eyes session, or the wolf pup eyes session. Whatever.
His mouth is dry from thirst, well, at least partially from thirst. The only liquid they have are the potions in their bag, and he’s not willing to use them up anyway.
Harry keeps kissing him, and it's amazing, he can savour it, even in that awful haze.
Severus clutches at the glass tighter, remembering Draco's screams, which could have rivaled his mother's.
"Should I…"
"I know. I know. You'll be in good hands."
Sirius nods, decisively, as if Harry had just confirmed something for him. 'I love you. I'm going to go now, okay?'
"Get up! Now, you little twerp." He strides to Harry, bends down to grab him by his hair again but Harry is prepared. He surges back and yanks Rosier's leg with him, sprawling the man on the ground with a yelp.
Draco shakes his head to dispel the rebelling words as he pulls the now empty bottle away from Potter’s face. Who seems slightly more lucid than before.
“Hard to believe that some people don’t even know how to scream rightly. Isn’t that right, Evan?”
"You have been very disobedient, Mr. Malfoy, haven't you?" She says, almost crooning and Draco straightens, his eyes shifting back to a dull grey.
Remus opens his mouth to call out but is drowned out again by an agitated Molly Weasley shrieking louder than the screaming portrait. "Sirius, for the love of heavens above!" she cries. "Stop pacing!"
When he wakes, some time after but not sure how long, he notices the lack of warmth, which is what woke him in the first place, his mind doesn't panic, but his body does.
come from? When did Potter's safety surpass his own? Well, if he were to be murdered tonight, at least someone will be there to provide testimony. He had managed to wrap Potter's hand before Umbridge busted them, so Draco's sure Potter would make it to his dorm alive. Even though he has been looking progressively worse as the detentions went on. Worse than he'd been when Draco found him passed out on the bathroom floor.
"Come on!"
Draco’s heart clenches, "Okay."
As soon as he sees the wands, though, he freezes, gaping ever so slightly. One of them is definitely Harry’s wand, he’s seen it enough times. And the other.  Is clearly not his.
Harry shakes his head. “It’s not, I’m sorry. I’ve been acting so weird, and all this food is going to waste, our supplies aren’t going to last us for long if this keeps happening and I-.”
"I have no doubt," the man finally says. "However I prefer my meals in room temperature,"
Draco interrupts him, "They don't work on him for too long."
“Put exactly seven drops of this in two cupfuls of water and soak a cloth in it. Apply it to his wound every three hours, change his bandages as soon as they soak through, and give him half a vial of fever reducing potion if his fever spikes up again, he’s stable now. Do you understand me Potter?” he starts working on disinfecting the claw cuts on his torso and face.
Draco shrugs, "You taught me how to cook. Hmm, maybe you should be a chef. I can vouch for--"
But he also doesn't need to be Morris Prewett to know that. He doesn't need to be a dead man to smell a conspiracy coming.
"Of course, Valentina," Evan sighs. All in due time, he thinks, all in due time, "Of course."
Hello dear all! We hope you enjoy the interlude;
Thanks a bunch to our beta. This is the longest chapter being uploaded yet, hope you all enjoy it! We certainly did, whilst writing it.
Severus puts his mug down in place, passively scanning the room to catch several heads bobbing in agreement. Minerva still seethes in her seat as the others settle into trial activities such as mass grading their papers, and quipping between themselves.
"Well, isn't this interesting," the third voice drawls, female, cold and most decidedly surprising Rosier as much as Harry.
Draco’s eyes sweep across the cell, looking for a weapon, something, anything, but the only thing he notices with dismay is that the pitcher and glasses have disappeared.
He’s less gentle pulling Harry up this time, urgency dictating his movements. He keeps a firm grasp around Harry’s waist with his left arm, and Harry's arm is gingerly draped across his shoulders, afraid to hurt him.
This Sirius is foreign, it’s his own mind rebelling and twisting into something hideous. It’s something Harry barely recognises. The Sirius in a Hawaiian shirt and a butterbeer in his hand is such a distant memory Harry wonders how he ever conjured him up. 'He's a cheat. A bully. He hated your guts.'
Harry coughs and groans through wave after wave of pain. The afterpains. He's certainly forgotten about those.
(See the end of the chapter for
He doesn't pause as he strides towards the fireplace, grabs a fistful of floo powder and changes his teaching robes for the death eater garb. He takes a deep breath, as he does nearly every time before a mission. This might be his last.
Severus is more than sure that calling Minerva’s outburst simple ‘shouting’ is a grievous understatement. Both regarding her heart, and Severus’s now spilled tea.
being the keyword. And his wish had been granted in the most gruesome way.
Is Albus planning a punishment or a new chance?
He stops the torture curse and Harry arches his back. There's no curse but the pain stays. The pain is dormant. Soaked into his bones.
Next update on 5th March, Friday.
"No seriously!" He is being serious. Draco can tell. That's the worst and simultaneously the best part of it, "As far as first dates go, this one isn't half bad." His smile expands into a grin, "But for future reference… Quid means Pound. It's slang, tiger."
Hedwig hoots in the darkness and Harry yells.
It’s not as if he can do anything about it.
"Enough flattery, Rosier. Rise."
here?"
Harry nods, resisting an eye-roll. Figures, only Aunt Petunia would be depraved enough to actually count the items in her fridge to make sure Harry doesn't take anything more than his share.
"Professor Umbridge," Harry says, trying to repress every ounce of hatred and foulness he would have liked to pour into those words. In Umbridge's place, in Harry’s head, sat the great pink toad, in her too-tight pink cardigan and shrieking voice. The cat adorned plates covering every inch of the circular office doesn't aid her image much either.
"Is he alright?" Sirius asks Remus who's still standing behind Harry. "Did you give him something? He looks pale."
"Excuse my bluntness, Kingsley. But I think I've made my point abundantly clear… if I notice such an occurrence again, that is you or any of my other employees, going back and forth to Dumbledore for whatever reason… well, I have my responsibilities and you have yours." Fudge has put his hat back on and is wringing his fingers.
with his childhood nemesis is nowhere near his boldest daydreams from the age of eleven and onward. This is a rare opportunity, and he recognises it as such.
It’s too dark inside, and they definitely trip on
Slowly, and without looking at the hateful sight of his hands, Harry reaches for the rag and dips it in the bowl.
"Heard you two were going bonkers over at Hogwarts--"
So he speaks, "Fuck you." Then he grimaces. Probably not the best choice of words, he thinks. His thoughts scattered and hysterical,
Harry lifts up his chin, "I don't think I've ever met anyone as real. And if he's real, then so am I. I feel real." It’s a funny conversation, Harry thinks. Even by his standards. Both he and Sirius ignore what the other is saying, despite being part of the same mind. He wonders how this would’ve gone in his head if he were normal.
Potter is wheezing behind him, and a small part of Severus feels severely sorry that the boy is being forced to run in this state, but he doesn't voice his thoughts. They cannot afford the smallest mistake, as long as Potter is conscious then he can run.
Next Update on: Friday 28th of May
"Harry!" Everything seems to screech to a halting stop as he hears the shrill voice of one of his best friends, right before Hermione’s body collides with him. He lets out a muffled grunt at the force of her hug as she squeezes him, and her hair tickles his nose.
on the robe, repairing the damage too. Narcissa had bought him the school robes, if Severus isn't mistaken. Draco would want it intact. The fabric fuses back together, almost effortlessly, which is to be expected, since the curse only ever affects the flesh with any vigour. Which is a lot.
“I do, but that doesn’t mean that I’m an idiot. There are two certain variables at the moment, either we will die or we won’t. If we do end up dying I would be responsible, if we end up getting out alive, then congratulations, I would also be the reason why we’d be fugitives.”
"Oh, so you don't want to get tainted," Harry rolls his eyes.
John finally wills his Quill to move, frantically scratching against the parchment roll hovering near the desk and carefully nitpicking Fudge's every word. The minister looks highly uncomfortable in his seat, under the man's gaze. John finally brings his head to nod.
Severus doesn't let his thoughts regarding Potter sink deeper in his mind. Doesn't let the thought of permanent damage, and singed nerve endings and the ambiguity of the boy's mental state hinder his detailed, very, prominently time oriented plan. They need to leave. Now.
Severus arches a brow, "I'm not asking you to defend anyone and we're not in my classroom. I believe it would benefit us both greatly if you hurried this up, time is golden."
Draco stops a few feet away from Harry and raises an eyebrow, trying to emulate Severus but probably failing spectacularly if Harry’s expression is anything to go by.
Harry doesn't turn, his shadow moves, but he doesn't react to having his name called. The panic that had left him at spotting Harry is starting to return.
Harry is trailing his fingers upwards, muttering the names, "We need to go north," he says, and Draco feels guilty for not participating.
Draco can barely speak through the pain, but he doesn’t need to. Harry is already pulling out the dark cloak. He very gently, worried eyes bearing into Draco’s, tries wrapping it around his shoulder.
"I do not remember such an agreement," Albus says softly, staring at Slughorn intensely.
'Kiddo.' Sirius steps closer, and if he were real Harry might have actually felt his breath against his face. 'Focus,'
"I'm sorry too,” Harry sighs, “You were such a jerk though."
"I might even forgive you for your shortcomings," Voldemort continues, caressing the end of Nagini's tail.
"I won't let you slip away. Not again," he crouches by Harry's head and puts the wand directly on his scar. "I waited for so long. I was foolish about it, I wanted you… all to myself."
Through the process of elimination, Draco figures that a potion is too unreliable and fleeting, it can be flushed out of the system eventually, Rosier would never go for something like that.
(See the end of the chapter for
He doesn't spend much time attempting to pick the padlock on his cupboard either, he figures that if he is unable to lock it back up after, or damage it, Uncle Vernon is going to blame magic and damage him in return, so he kisses any thoughts of homework goodbye and aimlessly lounges on the couch for a bit.
They flinch. "Harry… you need to realize," Ron says, joining Hermione on his bed. "We didn't know the dementor attack was on you."
"I'm sure it was," Kingsley cannot help the dryness in his tone.
This is horrible. Easily one of the worst things he’s ever done to Harry. Not even their four-year rivalry counts, because then they hadn’t
"Sometimes, I just adore how you can't pick up on irony and sarcasm, ma cerise," Draco drawls, resting his chin on Harry’s head, preventing him from looking up at him.

Chadwick Aaron Boseman was an amazing actor, he brought to life, not only a superhero, but a whole nation. May you rest in peace, Wakanda forever.
We’ve also made a playlist for My Safest Sound on Spotify. It has some of our favourite songs that remind us of Harry and Draco here. If anyone is interested,
Next update Saturday, 23th of May.
This feels crushing. Trying again and being pushed away. Draco groans, rubbing a soapy hand across his face.
Evan hauls Harry to his feet, this time by his throat, and Harry butts his head back to his chest, repeatedly. Rosier doesn't give in, just squeezes down on his windpipe.
"Thank you, Sirius," Hermione says, shooting Ron a warning look.
As he struggles to put on a shirt with his aching shoulder, an itch makes itself known in his wrist, smothered by the pain of heartbreak from before. Upon being acknowledged, it quickly turns to a stinging pain.
It felt relieving, it felt like justice being executed. Rosier probably feels the same now.
It's over too quickly. Or maybe it just feels that way. He blinks away the darkness to the feel of Harry’s hand carding through his hair, murmuring unintelligibly.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
“You’re a git.”
Much needs to be done, in such a short amount of time, and not a single thing could be overlooked in the process but one... They still couldn’t do anything about that pink toad.
Harry immediately catches on his unsaid words. His eyes dart to the matches and the knife and then he looks back to Draco.
He forgot the booze.
He observes as Potter's eyes don't shift and his pupils stay the same. Draco cautiously snaps his fingers near Potter's ears. Nothing.
"Potter!" Severus’s slightly raised voice startles Draco from his pain hazed daze and he looked up to see Harry emerge from the kitchen.
Privacy within the confines of his own house was hard to come by these days and Lucius used every spare moment while holding his breath. The notion was ridiculously condescending. Every hidden corner he glanced at, there was something gazing back at him. It made him somewhat glad that Narcissa didn't live to see these days.
He makes Harry drink the rest of their water, and much to his loathing, they split the bread into two, and munch on it as they walk. Draco just blissfully ignores the blisters surely forming on his feet in favour of avidly listening to Harry groggily talk.
It's a very self- indulgent, bitterness-driven game, and sometimes he feels slightly guilty as he lets his hands take over the chores, and cautiously starts playing the game in his head.
“I might as well try this,” he mutters to the unconscious boy next to him and raises his chin.
He swallows thickly, he can’t waste any time. Even standing here, every second, he’s wasting time while Harry could be suffering.
Hermione awkwardly sits at the edge of an unmade bed that must be Ron's, and Harry leans back against the closed door, just taking them in. They looked… kind of pathetic.
She doesn’t even bat an eye, and Draco is more relieved at that than he’d ever admit. "And can I have an identification?"
“How are you--?”
The others, especially Ginny, give him a wide berth as well, and Harry's left feeling a little isolated as he glances at the severed house-elf heads that are mounted on the stairwell walls, and Crookshanks tangled in his steps as he walks. He eyes Sirius's mom's portrait as well, shuddering to think about the kind of house his godfather had been brought up in, which isn't a pretty image at all.
Draco frowns, “What--” Harry shakes his head, patting the ground more insistently.
This place was under wards. Under the Fidelius. There is no conceivable way that it has been compromised. He himself is the secret keeper and he can count on one hand the number of people he’s told about it. And he’s never written it down anywhere.
So while he wasn’t really beat up about the muggles as he was listening to McGonagall, he is concerned about how Harry’s going to take it. He hates them too, he must have on some level, but what Ron really cares about is whether that hate is gonna amount to Harry’s locked up pile of emotions that he never talked about or is it going to float over his head like Cedric’s ghost. He wonders whether their deaths are causing more harm than good, and then he wishes that he had maimed those bastards himself.
He risks a glance up, to see her staring at him with a smile playing at her lips. It’s disturbing.
Potter had said that his detention would end after an hour, two at most, Potter had also said that his punishments sometimes went past curfew. Draco frowns, fingers idly running up and down his wand as he twirls it, almost absentmindedly. Maybe Potter had been exaggerating, but this is just Draco giving him the benefit of the doubt, and trying to convince himself of the wavering but continued survival of his wounded pride.
Harry's still mad at them, so even though he has missed the two of them all summer, he stifles the urge to gaze back, and instead pushes his food around sullenly, eyeing the burnt area on the table where his accidental magic had acted up. No one has bothered to fix it.
'You were always so bad at math,” Sirius speaks over Harry, “Mrs Simon's hit you once with a ruler, because you couldn't tell what comes after ninety-nine. Do you remember?'
"Ow!"
Draco sneers. He cannot handle this level of irritation and cheek that Potter's throwing at him without
'Stop deflecting. You need to stop this. He's lying to you,' Sirius is near snarling, and that frightens Harry almost as much as his not-dreams. There’s been so little kindness lately, only Draco. And now Sirius wants to ruin that. His own mind wants to ruin it. Why can’t he just enjoy the little things? Like being held by Draco?
"How did
"There won't be a repeat of this,” she says briskly, though her eyes flash for a moment, “But Potter isn't supposed to die yet. And Rosier was getting chatty. Do
"Matches." Harry's face pales. And he hurriedly pushes the bag aside, Draco can't tell if the shaking is from fright or the torture.
He half-expected them to be lying unconscious in a puddle somewhere until he bled to death, or the Ministry, or Death Eaters, found them. But here they are.
Of course he wouldn't. Psychological torture has already begun taking effect. A classic method too, Severus should have predicted this beforehand.
"They're not freaky. They're pretty." how could someone who sees a fucking stain as much more than it could be, think of it as freaky? It’s wonderous, anything beyond the regular imagination. Draco envies him for it, but also can’t imagine anyone else harbouring that kind of power other than Harry.
The train compartment they’re sitting in is cramped, but mostly warm. The seats are fraying at the edges, threads picked apart by past passengers. There’s a dull, yellow stain under one of the seats. But this is the most comfortable and sheltered they’d been in a while. Even staying in those laundry stores had been fraught with tension. Here? No one could deny their right to be here.
Lucius Malfoy is there too. Harry thinks that he is. That or Imaginary Sirius now has a companion with him. The man isn’t staring at him, unlike his son, but rather at Draco’s back, from what Harry’s blurry and wracking vision can tell him. He’s leaning on his cane, his back straight as an arrow as the torture goes on and on and on.
The way he looks at the sea reminds Draco of the day he had first seen the sea himself as a small toddler, on a trip to Southern France to their villa house near the beach. Enthralled and terrified of the vastness at once. Those were the best days of his life.
It's a miracle when she pauses, and Draco can see her black eyes, fractionally softening, "I'm sorry for your parents, truly. This is what I owed to them," she exhales, "Go."
A man that Draco distinctively knows as one of the Rosier family steps out, Draco knows it in an instant because of the trademark honey colored hair and narrow cheekbones. Two features exclusively belonging to Rosier men. Draco remembers it well enough. He's seen the man around before.
Interlude warning for; implied/referenced violence.
"I'm sure that Professor Dumbledore will know. He will be made aware immediately, and we will look for a solution. Right now, you need to calm yourself, Potter. You cannot go downstairs like this."
The fade to black didn't involve penetrative sex, as we have not tagged this fic as underage, HOWEVER sexual intercourse occurred and will be talked about in the following chapter.
"Oh it's quite alright, Mr. Malfoy," She says, her eyes narrowed and stitched to Harry's hand. Harry doesn't dare breathe.
Harry opens the hatch, and it pains Draco to see his hands shaking like that.
"Innovative, huh?" Harry smiles at him, handing him one from the pile, as Draco's heart slowly ceases from jackhammering in his chest. It’s fine, he’s alive.
"This just makes it a ton easier," Ron says, reaching for his bag.
Evan wants her to be that still when his hands are wrapped around her throat, pressing, choking the life out of her, watching the veins pop in her eyes.
"Oh no, I shall escort Mr. Malfoy back to his dormitory." Draco's eyes narrow and Harry glances between the two, feeling highly uncomfortable.
"Your father will be most displeased. That is, if he gets to live through the night. Bad blood… he seems plagued with it,"
Ron's eyes narrow into a glare, "You're treating us like she does," he says in an overly accusing tone, "We're going to do this you know, whether you want us to or not."
"What's that?"
"Maybe a pain reliever would--"
Harry reads the clock and then looks at her, then the clock again before he gazes down at his own wristwatch. It shows five minutes
Draco doesn’t lower the wand, but Harry seems to be relatively alive and Rosier seems to be relatively dead, so he doesn’t cast. "What are you doing here?"
"Okay," Draco's mutter is tuned out as Harry rapidly walks away.
They're all empty, some have the weird nice smelling powder in cube slots, and strange buttons that don't work when Draco presses them.
“I don’t.” Draco’s heart sinks, but Harry continues, “I’m just incredibly, foolishly lucky. I know it seems insane… but I have a good feeling about this.”
"You bitch!" Rosier cries, repeatedly slamming Harry's head back against the floor. Harry cries out in pain but jerks his knee up right into the man's shins.
He ponders on what it'll feel like. To be snuffed out of existence. Not death, but complete obliteration. Getting kissed.
"You're late," she says, her teaspoon annoyingly clinking against her china cup, Harry stitches his eyes to the clinking spoon and wishes it to combust in her hand, but then moves his gaze so as to not actually cause a debacle like that. He has a feeling that it won’t pass overlooked the same way as Aunt Marge’s incident had.
We shouldn't hurt other people with our words, nor actions, in any way. Please be kind to each other, and choose the people who influence you wisely.
Evan's eyebrow flicks upwards. He has a surprisingly jolly look about him, he's smiling, "Crucio."
What on earth is going on with Harry?
He knows how to apparate. He does. But he… hasn’t used it much. It’s too advanced magic, usually taught to seventh-year students. He’d actually just perfected it this summer. Before everything had gone to shit.
"Threat. Such a playful word.” He decides to change tactics, poke where it might hurt, “How's Selene, Val?"
“Of course I am, I have no idea what to do, he might die, oh fuck. He really might. I need to call someone, but no one would hear us, and if they did they might not help him. I don’t know what to do. This isn’t good. This is really bad. Fuck. Fuck,”
Thanks to our lovely beta and you guys! Happy reading~
What in the actual world ran through Draco's mind when he stood to kiss Harry Potter? What witchcraft compelled him to spend his nights in the same bed as the boy, and enjoy it, and what force is pushing him to pursue Harry time after time?
Harry's gasp is thankfully unheard under the general din. That must be Neville's father? Grandfather?
“So, what, my magic’s gone rogue? Shouldn’t there be, I dunno, some way to control it? Make it so I can travel when and where I want, and not have it interrupt a study session?”
"Er, now that I have met you, sir, I wanted to ask, are you...are you already famous for something? Something dangerous maybe?"
“Are we done criticizing my clothes, then?” Harry asks, suddenly very done with this whole thing. It’s not his fault his family hates him. It’s not his fault he’s ‘foreign-looking’ or a wizard, or that he only gets Dudley’s hand-me-downs. It’s just how life is, and he’s come to love Hogwarts for how far away it is from the Dursleys in all senses of the word.
"You're killing me. I don't suppose you were ever going to tell me you had magic either?"
Harry looks up and sees Tom Riddle, from his time travel and the diary, walking towards him. For a second his mind is blank- did he travel without realising it? But no, Tom was this old fifty years ago, and Ginny was this old days ago. Something else is going on.
“What is Dobby be doing for you sir?”
"I know, but you're a unique case, I think. Wizards created time turners with magic, because they wanted to change the past or the future. It wasn't natural like yours is."
“Okay, let’s try it,” Harry agrees.
"But suppose his body just goes there naturally," Ron argues. "What's he supposed to do then,
And he looks just like Harry - his Harry. The same messy black hair, brown skin, glass bottle green eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, and he must have missed the scar before.
"Who’s capturing someone?" Harry's voice came from the stairs. It was a bit teasing but Draco didn't seem to notice.
"I can respect you and make fun of you at the same time."
"I'm afraid the headmaster has been called away on urgent business to the ministry. You'll have to speak with him when he returns."
The sky clear and Draco's faith in Harry tentatively restored, he went back to his time sensitive ingredient collections, leaving Teddy a few simpler spells to work out on his own.
As the days passed, Draco got used to Harry's presence. The old man always seemed to be in the room when Draco was brewing, although he stayed away from the potions ingredients as Draco had asked.
Right in front of him, real and
“Fine, do what you want,” the wizard replied instead. “It’ll take more energy to get rid of you than I’m willing to allocate. And it’s Draco,” he added, sweeping out of the manor door without so much as a look back or a goodbye.
Harry glances between his dad and the dark haired man, confused. They share dark hair, but the other man is white and looks nothing like his dad. Was his father adopted? Was this other man?
“Mate!” Ron says, slapping him on the shoulder. “Thought you’d run off on us for a minute there. How’d you do that?”
Ron has been looking tense, waiting for Harry’s assessment of his home, but at Harry’s statement, his shoulders relax and his ears turn pink.
“Now.” Mrs. Weasley takes another sip of her tea. “Are you safe when you travel? You’re so young…”
"How do you know that? I know I wouldn't tell you that before you've even been to Hogwarts."
"No it's not."
“I’m a time traveler. I travel to different places and times, and in my timeline, I’ve already visited you a few times.”
"It's not," Teddy chimed in.
This causes both men to laugh.
"It matters," Hermione says, "because being able to speak to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. It's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent."
“Of course, sir. Dobby understands. It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you… it is difficult to know where to begin.”
"Where did you learn to fly like that? You could have seriously hurt yourself. If you even landed wrong you could've broken a leg!"
“Oh.” Harry looks a bit taken aback.
"Yes, time turners are devices which can help the user travel back in time, up to five hours. There are a lot of regulations on them because some really bad things have happened to wizards who meddled with time."
Dumbledore’s eyebrows raise. “Ah. I do seem to remember you mentioning a detention.”
And then he hadn’t visited Draco again for a long time. Draco knew Harry didn’t control when and where he went, but when he did return a few months later, just after his ninth birthday, Draco’s magic wrapped Harry in a cocoon of blankets from the moment he arrived. Harry teased him mercilessly about missing him, and was still wrapped in one blanket when he left. The blanket had disappeared with him, and Draco presumed it was at Harry’s manor somewhere, reminding him of Draco.
"Yes, but Hermione, it all makes sense! He was the stranger that gave Hagrid Norbert, so he knows how to get past Fluffy now! That means that he could try to get the stone any time, and Dumbledore needs to know. If Snape gives the stone to Voldemort, he'll be immortal!"
"Time travel!" The men exchange excited glances. "Well, feel free to rest your weary feet, young traveler. And what is your name?"
“I think I may be able to find something about Harry’s condition there.”
"But sir, aren't you going to do something about it?"
Wordlessly, Wizard Malfoy served the three of them bacon and eggs and poured some tea. The only acknowledgement that Harry had spoken was a raised eyebrow.
“I did disappear.”
“You’re Draco to me whether I’m here or back in my time, I’m not calling you by your last name. And I’m definitely not telling you
When Harry opens his eyes again, Ron is gone, and Hermione is nervously tapping her quill against her leg, looking around anxiously. She jumps when he appears, standing in front of his chair.
“So, Harry, what do you plan to do with your young self?” she asked, hoping to divert Harry's attention away from Draco to give her friend some space.
“Draco,” Harry warns, looking pointedly past Draco’s feet where the bristles are visible beneath the edge of his robes.
“That’s why I have the belt.”
"No, and you said you couldn't tell me things from the future so even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. Besides, you might find her and marry her before you fall in love and you definitely said you were in love before you got married."
Draco tears it open to find a Slytherin-coloured scarf with snitches darting back and forth across the fabric. He puts it on over his pyjamas and stares at it in the mirror. It’s not as pristine as his other clothes, but it’s proof that Harry exists in between visits, and it’s brilliant enough that he decides he can forgive Harry for giving him a winter present in the middle of summer.
"You don't look so good, mate," is the last thing Harry hears from either of them before the rushing fills his ears and he finds himself elsewhere.
“But why here?”
Mrs. Weasley blinks at him. Her mouth opens and then shuts.
Across from the stairs was another door, which Harry thought might go to another part of the mansion, but was only a pantry. He supposed it made sense with the table right there, but on the other side of the table and all along the wall opposite the hearth were shelves of glass jars full of what looked like magic ingredients. Not that Harry knew what magic ingredients were, but -he held one out at arms length in the light from the window- wormwood, the elegant writing on the label said. He put it back, not knowing what it could be used for. What if it was poisonous?
"This is as good as it's going to get, I guess," Harry tells Ron, ignoring the mirror. It has never liked any of his clothes anyway. He grabs his invisibility cloak and stands before Ron in another hand-drawn circle, concentrating hard.
in, I bet half of these wouldn't even need to be included. It would be called
Draco tries not to let his face fall in disappointment. "So you're not in love yet. That's okay, Mum didn't love Father right away either."
They’re in the middle of playing Dragons and Tamers when he notices the silver ring on Harry's finger.
"But isn't magic natural?" Just a few months ago, Harry would have said that objects flying without motors or wings was unnatural, but now that he has learned wingardium leviosa, it seems quite natural. Wouldn't this mean that time travel could be natural too?
Despite himself, Draco is getting a little worried about Crabbe and Goyle. They left the feast ages ago but they hadn’t been anywhere in the Slytherin dungeons, or any of their usual haunts when he’d gone out to look for them. He decides to circle back to check the Common Room again, and breathes a silent sigh of relief and a loud sigh of exasperation when he finds them near the entrance with what looks like a prefect. A Gryffindor prefect. Trust the two of them to find themselves in a situation like this.
"Are you in love yet?"
Gathering yarrow was pretty easy, and they practiced a few drying spells and the nonmagical way of drying as well, bundled and hanging from the ceiling. Then they grabbed the meat pies and pastries they'd collected yesterday and headed back to the blanket to set up lunch.
"Since I was six."
"Why isn't Harry allowed to stay?" Teddy asked as soon as they sat down to eat.
"What are we doing out here?" Harry asked from behind him.
“I don’t, though,” Harry mutters to Ron as they make their way up the stairs towards the Great Hall. “He didn’t even deduct house points first!”
“No, not that I know of.” Harry looks concerned, but Draco’s done. Obviously everything Harry’s told him was a lie, except that he’s a Gryffindor, but Draco had that figured out before Harry even confirmed it.
"You're just lucky you didn't have to see those giant spiders Hagrid has in the Forbidden Forest," Ron says.
“Mister Harry Potter, it is a great honour." Then, if possible, the creature's tennis ball sized eyes get even larger. "Oh, Master Harry! It’s been too long since I’ve seen you, sir...And you is so young, sir…”
Harry nods. "Impressive. Did I happen to mention who my wife's name is?"
Harry practically runs back to Gryffindor tower, but when he gets to the portrait hole, he hesitates. He instinctively knows that his body will return him to his place in the common room, but what would happen if he was already in place? He imagines being shoved into himself painfully, and decides to wait for his body to do whatever it does. If Filch comes around the corner he'll use it as a last resort, but this will be fine for now. Some part of his subconscious is curious as to why they haven't learned about this yet; it seems important and a little dangerous, but then again hasn't everything here been like that so far?
"But you're from the future! They don't have practice potions sets in the future?"
Draco lingers in the open compartment doorway. If what everyone’s saying is true, Harry Potter is sitting in front of him.
"Because I can? And because you weren't going to be home to yell at me like that?"
“A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.” Tom gestures towards the familiar diary, a few feet off.
"Yes, sir."
"Excuse me?" he asked, turning to look in Harry's direction. The old man was hunched over, leaning heavily on the broom he'd been using to clean up the slime. Draco took a moment to be thankful he hadn't been using the
“Hmm. I can try, but it’ll take time. What say we make a deal? I’ll try to break your curse if you try to fix up my living situation?” She gestured with arms of fire to the surrounding brick. “
A few days after he set that particular platter in the shop window, he heard the potters gossiping about the poor man who’d bought it for his wife’s birthday, and had spread word that it was magical. Apparently when she used it to serve dinner to her family, the meager amount of food appeared to multiply in the dish, allowing everyone at the table to eat their fill. That night he fired a whole kiln full of those platters, with further instructions to glaze them identically to the first. Harry’s stepfather had been overjoyed, until many customers came back angry that their platters hadn’t magically filled with food as the gossip had said. But they hadn’t promised anyone magical pottery, just well-made pottery, and everyone could agree that the platters were well-made, so Harry wasn’t worried.
Harry feels lost, sitting amongst all the other Gryffindors, stuck in their common room. Hermione's been Petrified and he has no idea how they're going to solve this without her. She’s the smart one, after all. If he and Ron can’t stop the monster soon, it will Petrify and even kill other muggleborns, and the school will have to shut down.
Harry wishes he already knew how to cast that
"Teddy doesn't know how to fly either!!"
This Pansy was the

refuses to spend any effort on me.”
If Harry Potter doesn’t want to be his friend, this is what he’ll get.
“What!?”
Harry sighs and runs a hand through his hair but doesn’t refute it. “I’m not sure what to tell you. There is a possibility that you could change the past, er, your future, knowing what you know, but I really don’t know what would happen.”
“Yes, sir. It was about a month ago. It was the first time I traveled in a few years.”
It’s a week after Hermione’s birthday and cold rain is falling in sheets outside. Harry has quidditch practice later, but for now he’s happy to be curled up in a corner of an empty classroom with Ron and Hermione. For once Hermione’s not on Harry and Ron to finish their homework or revise for exams, probably because she has something else on her mind.
And then Draco is alone in the dark in his four poster, thinking about the future and what he’s supposed to do now.
Over the next several days Harry was in and out with tools and pieces of wood, making shelves for the supply closet, and every night Draco would open it to take a closer look.
“My name is Harry,” he said, trying and failing to get up. Teddy came over and started fussing over him, but Harry continued talking to the wizard. “And I’m here to fix things up.” He stood successfully, intent on getting in the wizard’s face, but Teddy led him to the table instead.
“Eh, it’ll probably fade soon. I just feel like I have so much energy compared to before! Thank you both for helping me. Now I’ll be able to visit my friends again, and oh, I can pick up some new glaze to try out on the hearth, Pans. I think if we layer another color in certain spots it could look stunning. Ah! Don’t you just love being alive?”
The first present Harry opens on Christmas morning is his father's invisibility cloak.
"Ah, serious," Dumbledore says, and Harry hadn't even realized he had moved from the corner to greet them. "Peter, Remus, James, Lily. Thank you all for joining us. We will be starting soon, feel free to grab a drink and mingle." Dumbledore gestures to a doorway that Harry thinks is probably the kitchen. Harry can't figure out which two of the three wizards Dumbledore greeted by name, but gets distracted by his dad speaking.
"I've been doing some research on the subject," Hermione says. "I can only find one record of someone traveling without a time turner, it's quite a rare ability."
But she knew that Draco and Harry were both home now, since Harry went up with tea a few hours ago, which meant they were either sleeping or ignoring her. Draco had been out until dawn this morning picking potions ingredients but he didn’t usually let himself nap to make up for it. Harry’d gotten him to take better care of himself though, so it was a toss-up. She didn’t want to wake Draco if he was actually resting, but the constant knocking was really getting to her. On the bright side, she would finally be able to use the contraption Harry built for her as part of their deal…
Ron's suddenly by his side, shaking him.
Predictably, Weasley puffs up and forgets whatever reason he had for confronting Vince and Greg. "You should show more respect to a school prefect! I don't like your attitude!"
"That's when I was born!"
“Done,” Harry croaked.
“Then the game will be forfeit. The rules were no magic!”
"What's wrong with him Pans?" Harry demanded.
"The infamous Aurors," Fabian nods. "It's good to know we have such talent on our side."
Harry catches a few more glimpses of his parents and their friends, but he keeps having to dodge out of the way to avoid people lining up for the photo. Before he can convince himself to either approach them or not, he feels his skin wrinkling and disappears.
Draco’s mother has just kissed him goodnight, wished him a happy birthday again, and closed the door behind her when Harry arrives. Suddenly it doesn’t matter that Draco was seconds away from falling asleep, Harry’s here for his birthday! He hasn’t been by in a few weeks, but he didn’t forget Draco’s birthday!
"Professor Flitwick, may I use the loo?"
"So? I bet a lot of people can do it. I traveled to a boy over the summer who talked to his garden snake."
“Er, sorry?”
Pansy was ecstatic about the deep red glaze on her hearth, which truly was very well done. It would be easier to clean, too. Not that he would be telling Harry that. It would only encourage him to stay. As it was, Pansy was already going on about some contraption to help her see out of the room, and with the stubborn man still under the curse, he knew he would be feeding another mouth for the foreseeable future.
Harry’s biggest worry was about Wizard Malfoy, whose moving manor now roamed the hills just outside of town. It was said that he had a tendency to eat apprentice’s hearts. Harry’s friend Ron said he’d like to see Wizard Malfoy try to eat his heart, since he would easily be able to throw the wizard over his shoulder like the sacks of flour he hauled every day. Ron’s sweetheart Hermione, who worked at the bakery counter, was less sure, and her worries always seemed to come back to him when he was alone in the shop late into the evenings, doing his glazings. “You’ll save your owner from ailments of the heart,” he told a soup bowl he was glazing one night. “Physical
His socked foot touches his missing trainer as he sits down but he can't bring himself to put it back on. If his time travel works like that woman Hermione told him about, he'll be aging soon, and he'll probably outgrow everything. He didn't go so far into the past to die immediately once he got back like that Elo-whatsit lady, but seventy or so years on top of his eleven will definitely make him an old man, and they'll probably make him leave Hogwarts and live somewhere else.
“What’re you reading?” Harry’s voice came from right over Draco’s shoulder and he jumped.
“What does Snape want with that?” Hermione asks.
"S'not your fault."
have- who knows when he'll see them again.
Harry didn’t come for his birthday, after all. Suddenly he wants to cry, but he blinks really hard to stop himself because
Harry stands in front of Dumbledore’s office, clutching the return letter with the Headmaster’s password in one hand and his wand in the other. It shouldn’t be so scary; Harry requested this meeting, not the other way around. It’s probably just the eerily empty halls and the memory of Dumbledore’s knowing eyes looking at him as he read Harry’s letter during breakfast.
It’s no good, Harry says Malfoy like he says Draco, too nice, like they really are friends. Like he really never lied to him.
He spent his time brewing things he needed to stock anyway, and watched the old man closely as he tackled the supply closet. Harry made a big mess, pulling everything out and then going up to Teddy's room to take a nap.
With that reassurance, he begins to look around himself in interest. The classroom looks similar in some respects, enough that Harry knows it's the potions classroom at Hogwarts, but none of the students nor the professor look familiar to him. It could be the past or the future, for all he knows; the professor is a tall, portly man dressed in an expensive looking waistcoat, similar in style to Flitwick's outfits. He has light coloured eyes, blond hair that's darker than Malfoy's but just as shiny, and a strawberry blond mustache. He's going around the room checking over everyone's potions and giving out either encouragement or pity, depending on what he sees.
"What?"
"HA!" He yells in Harry's face, waving the captured snitch so he can't miss it.
"A new timeline?"
“That’s it?”
"I love you too." The man's voice breaks and his hands tremble as he turns to bury his face in Harry's wild soft hair. "So very much."
A look Draco can't discern flashes across Harry's face, but then he grins and slides his wand into his back pocket. "What are you waiting for?"
"Is it happening?" Hermione asks in an excited whisper. "Oh, this is fascinating, Ron, look at his eyes, they're completely unfocused!"
"But... how?"
“2004.”
“Merlin and Morgana!” Draco exclaims, turning to face him. “Weren’t you ever taught not to sneak up on people who were clearly busy?”
A selection of Harry's visits to Draco as Draco is growing up, from Draco's point of view.
“Hey! That was two years ago, and it was proof I have magic!”
Harry pats his knee softly. “I know this is a lot to take in, so maybe the best thing to do in this situation is to not think about it, and just do what you are going to do without worrying whether or not it’s what happened in my past. That’s what I try to do.”
“I could so!” he says, still giggling.
"The missing one or the one you were wearing?"
The door at the top swings open and Harry sees Dumbledore’s office for the first time. Dumbledore is busy putting some sort of metallic disc away in an old fashioned cabinet, but he turns and smiles when Harry enters the room.
Just then, the fireplace turns green and two people exit it. Harry's knees buckle under him and he sinks to the floor, barely aware of the invisibility cloak fluttering around him and keeping him hidden.
“But did you find out what Flamel is famous for?” Ron asks on their way to the Great Hall. All three of them are hungry, and lunchtime is almost over.
It’s Harry’s worst birthday yet, and that’s saying something. He’s spent all day cooking and cleaning for a dinner party his Aunt and Uncle are hosting, and now he’s going to be stuck in his room for the rest of the evening, not expecting anything by way of presents, let alone food.
"A Parselmouth!" Ron says. "You can talk to snakes!"
It would be awful, simply awful. He didn’t know if he could stand it.
“Thank you so much, Great Dragon,” the man said, handing over a loaf of bread. “I’m sorry I can’t afford more right now…”
"Oh, we're not studying!" Harry tells him. "Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel, we've been trying to find out who he is."
“You are in my laboratory,” the older man says. “In Paris.”
"Dobby," Draco calls out when he retires to his room after his first dinner with his parents after the end of term.
"Harry?" Hermione's voice is trembling slightly. "Wh-What did you see? Was it You-Know-Who?"
Harry settles into his usual plush chair in the corner of the room, looking relaxed, and wordlessly gestures for him to continue.
Draco throws up his hands and stalks away. "If either of you get hurt, it's not my fault!" he shouts.
“Can you remove it?”
Harry recoils as if Draco has hexed him, and Draco looks up to notice that his scar is indeed missing. He’s probably glamouring it so that Draco won’t recognize him, like the liar he is.
"So what, school's out and you don't have to be on time any more Moons?" Harry's dad asks one of the wizards, clapping him on the back. He's thin with wavy brown hair.
"Blimey, I thought we'd starve before you came back. Do you know it’s already halfway through lunch?" Ron says, and then sees Harry's face. "What happened? You look like you need to sit down." He guides Harry back to the chair he’d sat in what feels like ages ago, and Harry can feel himself trembling in Ron’s grasp.
“Oh, of course, sir! I is Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house elf.”
"Are we friends?"
“He’ll be fine, Mum,” Ron says, and gives Harry a reassuring smile.
Draco sits up slowly, knowing that Harry is already gone. He enjoys Harry’s visits so much, but every visit it’s that much harder to say goodbye, especially knowing that at some point Harry will stop visiting. He said last time that the final visit for years was Draco's first day at Hogwarts, and as much as he’s looking forward to Hogwarts, he can’t help but be sad that Harry will stop visiting.
“Again? I swear, he has it in for you.”
Over tea, Harry asks Draco what he’s brewing.
But evidently he hadn’t been as hidden away as he’d thought, because one evening as he moved the newly-cooled pottery to the store shelves, the Lord of the Waste walked in and cursed him.
As much as Harry wishes he could blend into the crowd, Professor Snape singles him out for either his celebrity or his atrocious potions making skills nearly every day. He hasn't done so yet today, so when Snape dismisses class, Harry can't pack his things fast enough. Snape has had it in for him since the first day of class, and when possible, Harry avoids spending time with him.
"There you are," he drawls, trying not to sound as if he just spent twenty minutes looking for them. "Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall this whole time? I've been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny." Speaking of that newspaper clipping his father just sent him… "And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
Professor McGonagall drops her books in surprise. "I do not know where you learned about the Stone, but it's perfectly safe where it is."
Ron and Hermione startle a little when Harry pops back into the present.
“This wouldn’t even be a problem if you weren’t here!” Draco yells, his anger at the situation and Harry exploding inside of him. “I don’t want you to visit me ever again!”
"It is," Draco agreed.
Things are a little tense between them for the rest of Harry's visit, and Draco makes a note that he'll have to be more careful when he becomes friends with Harry at Hogwarts.
Draco had just come back from an overnight trip to gather stardew flowers, and wanted to take a quick shower to wake up and freshen up before starting the day. He had a meeting with Wizard Dumbledore and he wanted to look and feel his best despite the lack of sleep. The old wizard was always more perceptive and judging than Draco wanted him to be.
do that to him!"
"Yes," Harry responds, pulling the cloak over his head. He's been dressing with his tennis laces tied around his ankles and his hand-drawn circle shirt under his uniform every day for the past week. "Cover for me at-?" is as far as he gets before everything goes black for a moment.
Harry’s words make Draco sit up a little. “You really never had a birthday party?” He snuggles closer to Harry to comfort him the way his mother does sometimes when he’s upset.
"Huh. How long have I been visiting you?"
But he doesn’t, so he just whispers, “Put up a silencing spell and get over here.”
"I don't think it was intentional," Hermione rolls her eyes. "When someone casts a killing curse, they don't usually think of side effects for the victim. They just want to kill them. No, I think the curse rebounding may have had some strange effect on you."
"But Harry, you said you already talked to Dumbledore about Snape." Despite her words, Hermione and Ron are still following Harry as he hurries towards Dumbledore's office. With exams over, most of the student body is outside enjoying the weather, and the corridors are almost completely empty.
“Oh.” He looked shocked, as if he really hadn’t considered it. “Well, I guess tomorrow I’ll go to town to see my family and my friends, tell them I’m still alive, pick up that glaze, and then…” he looked between Draco and Pansy and Teddy, unsure of himself. “Probably get started on the bathroom?”
Ron's eyes are wide as he stares at Harry's floating head. "What-it's happening? Have you got the circles?"
Luckily Flitwick just nods and continues giving out the homework assignment while Harry makes his escape. He barely reaches the corridor and throws on the invisibility cloak before the discomfort reaches its peak and he disappears. Luckily Ron or Hermione know to take his things with them when he doesn't show back up.
“Fine…” Draco tries to play it like this is the least Harry can do for him, the way he’s seen his father do during business deals, but inside he’s jumping up and down in excitement. He’s definitely writing this down everywhere so he doesn’t forget.
"I dunno. They knew my father, though. 'Your father left this in my possession before he died,'" he reads, "'It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.'"
“Can’t hurt, mate,” Ron says. “Though I don’t envy you having to write to Dumbledore.” He shudders dramatically and digs into his food.
which looked like it would never clean anything, a regular broom, a bucket full of rags, and some jars labeled cleaning solution. Besides that were the stairs up to what Harry presumed were the bedrooms.
There was a clatter, and then Draco, sarcastically, “I thought handymen were supposed to fix things, not break them. C’mon, let’s make a celebratory dinner for when Teddy comes home.”
"It's very uncommon," Ron tells him, shaking his head. "This is bad, Harry, very bad."
"I dunno. I don't feel as if I've aged, but I only went two weeks into the past, so it wouldn't show much. And I didn't get stuck or alter any timelines. Well, except for getting myself detention, I guess."
“Remember, eight o’clock tonight. You’ll be scrubbing cauldrons for your detention.”
"What about Harry?"
“Yeah.” The snitch floats towards them for a few seconds in a taunt before heading back to its unreachable position.
Harry nods. It makes sense, and once he can do those spells things will be much easier, except... "What about my shoe?"
“But you said we were friends in the future,” he points out, disappointed that Harry doesn't recognize him.
Draco makes his eyes as wide and innocent-looking as possible. “Of course not!”
"He's been spending too much time with you," Draco accused Pansy. "You used to respect me," he told Teddy.
“I never had a birthday party until after I went to Hogwarts,” Harry says quietly. “I wish I could’ve gone to your birthday party today, I bet it was really fun.”
Harry shudders. It's too horrible to imagine.
There it is, as if he needs more proof that he can speak to and understand snakes.
when you arrive might be of some use," Flamel remarks.
He doesn't want to believe it, but he knows Hagrid was expelled, and he's seen how Hagrid is with dangerous animals. Just last year, he hatched a baby dragon in his hut! If he found out about the monster in the Chamber, Harry could see him finding a way to free it, even if it was considered extremely dangerous.
“I deserve some credit for this catch,” he tells Draco. “You couldn’t have gotten it without me!”
“So you know I’m a time traveler.”
He hopes he would remember the room if he landed there again, but instead the stones look familiar for a different reason: he’s still in Hogwarts. He’s in a cold dark hallway, and it seems like it’s quite late - no one else is around. Harry supposes this is a good thing, since his sudden appearance would probably be shocking and newsworthy. He reaches for his wand so he can find his way back to the Gryffindor common room, but realizes all he has with him are the clothes he’s wearing and the quill in his hand. His wand is probably still sitting next to his parchment in the common room. But then how did he get here if not with his wand?
, but she has no way to contact him. From what she’s gathered from Lily’s excited rambles, wizards travel through fireplaces or thin air, and her fireplace is fake. She could send him some post but she doesn’t have his address, and she doubts they use the Royal Mail.
The room was eerily silent as the soup cooked, so that when a log popped loudly, Pansy hid beneath the pot, unwilling to see anyone's reactions. She focused her energy on heating the soup instead, eager to hear what would be discussed over dinner.
Harry ended up setting up a handyman business in Hogsmeade, despite his own apprenticeship being a potter in Godric's Hollow.
“Oh!” she heard Harry exclaim. “You fixed it! Oh Draco, thank you!”
“Hello, Draco,” he says, walking towards him. “What are you up to today?”
Harry's second year at Hogwarts, featuring the first time he meets Dobby, learning more about his time travel ability, and trips to before he was born.
to say," huffed Draco, "is that we should plan something fun for tomorrow. It's Harry's day off and I think the weather should continue to be nice."
"Enemies of the Heir, beware!” He reads out loud. “You'll be next, mudbloods!"
"On purpose?" The old man’s face was blank.
The man raises his eyebrows in surprise. “I didn’t realize--Well, my name is Harry too, and I’m going to be visiting you for a bit, just like the other Harry did.”
Could he really be a descendant of Slytherin? He doesn't know anything about his father's family, and he hasn't traveled to his family at all, at least that he remembers.
“Yes, Professor. Er, I don’t know if you remember, but I, ehm, visited you? Around 1922? In Paris?”
He vaguely remembers this happening when he was little, and he knows he was punished for it, but he can't remember why or what happened. After all, there wasn’t much he wasn’t punished for at the Dursley’s.
. The old man had found a working broomstick and was doing loop-de-loops fast enough to stop Draco's heart.
“I get my wand today,” he says, “and my official potions ingredients, and my school robes.”
Hermione hesitates, glancing up at the head table. “Professor Dumbledore will be here over break, won’t he? Why don’t you ask him?” Her eyes light up as she keeps going. “It’s possible he’s done research on this since you met with him, and he’s really intelligent, he may know ways you could record your trips, or why your right shoe was left behind, or who knows what else!”
"Sorry, I- Sorry. I thought it was time for me to go, but I guess not. Er, what was the question?"
Draco remembers the oddity of Harry shaking Dobby's hand when they first met all those years ago, and wonders if it meant something he didn't realise at the time. But even if they were the same person, Potter wouldn't know what Harry did, being that much younger. He sighs, letting it go. Just another mystery to add to the others.
Harry breathes through his clenched teeth. He can't focus on a word the man is breathing into his ear.
Umbridge opens her useless gab.
"Thank you," Draco says this time before Harry can even open his mouth. He feels a shiver rush down his spine, but he stifles the urge to cringe as her hand brushes against his.
Harry looks at him as if he knows. "You wouldn't know," he says so, not in a mean disparaging way, but rather casually as a fact. "You're too rich for this conversation." He rolls his eyes in ill-concealed amusement. "I'm giving you extra boiled carrots."
Draco flexes his hand, careful not to squeeze Harry’s too hard. It’s clear Harry doesn’t want to talk about this. He won’t make him. "You don't have to be like that anymore."
When Harry is done he settles back on his heels, discarding the bloodied strip, and looks over at Draco, gaze settling on his blood soaked shirt.
"Um, yeah…” a Hufflepuff fourth year pipes up, “why is Zabini and the...well,
"Okay, let's not move your arm," Harry lets go of the shirt, and reaches for his collar instead, "I'll pull the sleeve the other way."
But as he sees Bellatrix twirl her wand over him, as he sees him writhe, bending and twisting and clawing at the ground with cracked, bloody nails, mouth open in a silent scream, blood bubbling out of the corners, trickling down his face, Harry finds himself wishing to see the familiar blank face.
This Sirius is sounding more tempting as minutes go by, but Harry stifles him once again. 'Everyone would know I did it,' he thinks to imaginary Sirius as he holds the toad's gaze.
This might be all he ever wanted from life. It certainly feels like it.
He just hopes whatever that glance was about, it wasn’t anything too important. His stomach feels heavy from uneasiness, but he tries to ignore it.
He slowly nods his head, and scoots back a couple inches from Harry. He lifts one of his arms, the uninjured one, and cradles the other across his chest. Harry grasps the ends of his sweater and slowly starts dragging it up.
"Alright, thank you-"
"Who am I gonna talk to?” Rosier sneers, “Dumbledore? Where have you hidden him? In the attic?"
Draco doesn’t even know if it is morning yet. The dark circles under Harry’s eyes look even more pronounced than ever, and Draco wonders if his face is any better. Then he has to suppress the urge to laugh, his fingers keep tracing the cut on his face. He's not allowing mortification to kick in, just yet. He feels disgusting.
"We were worried about you too, Harry, you're not being fair!" Hermione's hands ball into fists, her hair frizzes around her face.
Harry dozes off against him eventually, he's still a bit cold to touch.
The back of his neck heats up under the sun as Harry bitterly pulls out the weeds, and spares a glance at their porch every once in a while. Before he's halfway done, he decides to use the hose in the backyard to cool down a bit before getting back in, and since Aunt Petunia isn't snooping on him from the porch today, then he might just get away with it.
'Just a goldfish matter,' he had said, as if that offered any measure of help.
He pats Draco’s uninjured cheek, gently at first, then a little more roughly. Draco’s eyelids flutter, and he mumbles something incoherent.
pay attention in classes?
Then he promptly lets his head roll over to Harry's shoulder. His cheek pressed against Harry’s bony collar bone as Harry grunts in surprise. His eyes fall shut and he slowly, reluctantly, releases Harry’s hand.
He jolts upright and his shoulder screeches in pain. Draco yells and grabs at it, which of course, worsens the throbbing. He spends precious seconds just breathing through the pain.
"And a few days ago,” Draco explains, “he had an accident with a knife," he's not sure how to phrase it any other way without making Harry sound like a psycho.
Ron's eyes comically widen and he looks baffled, cutting Remus off, “What?”
Swallowing hard, Harry firmly- or as firmly as he can- shakes Draco. Draco’s lips part and he lets out a small groan, but otherwise doesn’t break. Harry moves his hand to his cheek and almost flinches back.
"All that work, and effort," She curls her lip with a small shrug. "No matter. We'll just have to work a bit harder then, won't we? Maybe try something that really makes the lesson… stick."
Draco doesn't reply, he's standing directly behind Harry's crouched form, and he's staring like a man dying of thirst. He's not a savage, he knows when to ogle people and when to avoid such an undignified habit, but he just cannot help it today. Not with Potter.
"Enough!" He shrieks and traps Harry in place with both arms. Then they both vanish with a crack.
Draco looks hesitant, and honestly, Harry had expected that. But also, he can't help the tiny hint of irritation that sparks in his chest when Draco resists. Harry needs to blow off steam, he really needs his alone time, this is becoming too much.
Potter stares at him for a moment, and then takes a deep breath, as if bracing himself. "Mr. Malfoy is dead," then Potter's shoulders slump, all the fight draining out of him.
He wouldn't have thought twice about this if he were the Draco from before. But each step to the store's counter makes him feel as if his shoes are made of lead.
So Draco does. And then Harry drinks some, less than half, there's still a bit left, and then crams the bottle inside their bag. Draco reclaims Harry's hand and they keep walking.
"Just a moment," she says and disappears into the corridor that leads to the man's office, emerging only after a few minutes have passed.
and the scabbed over cuts on his hand split open. It’s with the sheer force of will that he keeps himself from hissing.
"You can um… you should bite on that."
"Only now?" Potter frowns.
Harry doesn’t know what he’s done to deserve this.
“They’re… they’re too big,” Harry protests, half-hearted at best. Draco notices with distant satisfaction that his grip has tightened on his wand. At least he won't lose it. Hopefully.
Potter, Severus thinks, slightly amused, now looks a little nervous as opposed to the not so subtle hostility from earlier. After little contemplation, Severus walks over to the bed and sits down, and conjures up a chair. Wooden and hard backed, gesturing for Potter to sit.
"Of course," the man takes a long sip of his mug, "I will meet you there. Do you have the note?"
Harry is leaning against him, his face lolling against Draco’s collar. Draco can’t smell spices anymore. Just blood. Blood and the acrid smell of dark magic.
Sirius raises a hand, cutting Remus off, then raises one finger, counting off, "First of all, it wasn't my idea to get locked up here. I'm not allowed to leave, that's the default set of Sirius Black, not an option.” He raises a second finger, “Second of all, I have nothing else to do--"
This is bad, Harry knows it. This is really bad.
It's like he's being pushed through a narrow tube and he can't
Harry grasps his wrists and moves them to the side, quickly wetting the areas on his shirt where it is sticking to his skin, and the shirt itself, and while it made pulling away slightly easier, he still hisses when Harry attempts it.
"How did it all happen, and… Snuffles' involvement? Merlin, this is a mess,"
"Dinner?"
Last night’s storm is long gone and has given way to a cheery sun, clouds rolling about the too blue sky. It’s almost insultingly merry.
"Have you ever been to the sea before?" He cannot help but ask today, and Harry startles, wincing as he holds his arm tighter, and Draco's eyes narrow. He seems to be doing that a lot lately. It's his injured arm, Draco knows, the one with the knife cuts and Umbridge’s handy work, there's something colossally wrong with Potter's arm.
It has taken spending so long in the ‘After’ not to stiffen. He makes himself give her a nasty smile, and lets her arm go, taking a step back and straightening up.
The parchment is worn and crimson, and the quill remains sharp, no matter how hard Harry presses it down on the parchment. Neither break. The quill remains cruelly sharp and firm in his hand, and the parchment remains unwrinkled, only stained with Harry's blood.
Harry sighs, "Yeah. But we're mailing this poor man's ID card back to him." he fiddles with the card in his hand.
Harry nods and Tonks skips down the stairs, her head bobbing at the other men. "I'm ready. Aren't we waiting for Kingsley?"
Harry waits for her to continue.
Harry wakes up, and inadvertently wakes Draco with him, by either probing his arm to inquire about breakfast, or staring at his face long enough that Draco is peeved into opening his eyes anyway.
"Go on," he's making a knowing face, "lick it."
The hissing and the cursing are back again, and Harry feels thick rivulets, warm and sluggish making their way down his forehead.
With another shake of his head, Harry sets his jaw and refuses to think about the subject anymore.
There's a tall, dark-skinned, bald man right in front of him and the dementors have receded, hovering a little further away. He can faintly make out a silvery animal through blurry eyes, something large. A Patronus. It's fading, slowly. And the man in front of him raises his wand again.
“Why won’t you be honest with yourself?” Draco sneers now. “Do you really think that you could ever in any capacity, live up to your mother’s reputation in the dark lord’s eyes? Either of them? He doesn’t, and I bet this is fun for him.”
Draco brushes his thumb against Harry's fingers as his eyes roll around for some kind of miracle solution.
"Wait, seriously?" he didn't know that Sirius was an Auror.
Fudge's mouth is full, and he cannot answer for a beat, his chin is dusted with white, and the man hastily reaches for a napkin as he washes down the rest of his scone with a long swig of his teacup. John patiently waits, the perfect image of professional journalism.
Harry sort of hums and lets Draco drag him inside the store, it's empty and so much warmer than the harsh, biting cold outside that Draco wants to melt right on the floor.
The boy crosses his arms for dramatic effect, but he's shaking too badly to impose a threatening image. "It doesn't matter." he says. "I just do. Draco begged you and you did nothing. I don't trust you." he adds that last bit as an afterthought.
"Constant vigilance, Potter! I'm glad someone has it," he says in a gruff voice, nodding to the wand Harry is still holding in his hand, poised and ready to attack.
He hadn't thought about it that way, but that doesn't seem… impossible.
"You don't have to… you're not entitled… to talk to me. I'm fine. Great." Finally, Potter cracks his eyes open, looking at him with an odd expression.
"Kind of shy for my tastes, but I agree."
Finally, he speaks, "What did I see when the dementors came near me?"
"Somebody shut up that damned portrait!" shouts another voice. Younger and feminine. It's Ginny, Harry thinks.
So, two pieces of toast, a couple of spoonfuls of peanut butter jar, and exactly three stripes of bacon...that's all he's getting. Hedwig flaps her wings and settles on Harry's shoulder once more, nibbling on his ear as Harry surveys the food with narrowed eyes.
Thanks lots and lots to our wonderful Beta, Amar!
Cold is great, because cold hurts now. He rubs his thumb lightly against Harry’s hand, wishing that he could will away the pain. The sweater Harry is wearing is still damp with blood and unlikely to keep the November chill out.
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, torture, vaguely referenced/implied necrophilia.
'Because of its function. Fire purifies, Draco.'
But where then, did they go?
"I guess,” he bites his lips, “it's been hurting for a while now."
"One hundred and seventeen, one hundred and--"
The concept is entirely alien to him. Why would he miss Weasley and Granger in the first place?
"I'll make you some hot chocolate as well," Mrs. Weasley says with a motherly smile, getting to her feet.
“As if you’re doing any better yourself, Malfoy.”
Of course, Twinky.
'But how?'
"Potter," he says, slowly, cautiously.
'You can't keep avoiding me,' Sirius says, and Harry turns his head towards him, reigning back a sigh.
Harry just gapes at him. "Spli-- what?" He looks around. They're back at Privet Drive. In fact, the Dursleys house is only a block away. Harry's eyes snap up to meet the man again.
Draco watches him pushing stacks of hay back to him with his foot, arms bundled with the firewood.
Draco mulls over this as he gathers his empty vials into his school bag, and vanishes the bloodied rags, he thinks about how Potter is nothing like he had thought he’d be in the last few years.
"You're not." Severus rolls his eyes, "Is there any stiffness in your arm? Any aches that have no apparent origin? Be honest."
Harry picks up an apple from the counter and holds it flat in his hand, "Don't be ridiculous," He cheerily replies over his shoulder, a seagull is viciously pecking apple pieces from his palm, it might be Lester. There's a whole flock of the bloody things, Draco grimaces.
"Just get it over with, Severus."
“I’m sorry,” Harry mutters once he opens his eyes, previously pale cheeks now tinged pink.
"Spalding to Sutterton,” Draco says, smiling at Harry, “Here we come."
“Harry…” Draco’s voice is strangled, he takes a step towards him, Harry’s head snaps up to him, and then to his hands. Upon finding them empty, the panic starts receding, but he doesn’t get up.
"Why--" Potter's lip curls. "Why are you helping us?" The boy looks so genuinely confused that Severus is almost offended.
"You're gushing out blood," Harry pushes the vial back into his hands and Draco wants to grip his fingers and put them on his own face. Just to feel warmer.
"Godfather," Harry says, his hands dropping by his sides. "You're his godson?"
He scrambles on the one near Harry's, his eyes following Harry's trembling finger, the sound of another speeding vehicle behind them sends a rush of fear down his spine. Every single time, he just imagines the speeding car whirring and running them over.
In a way, Harry is very similar to his godfather, and whilst Severus's face is the exact depiction of stoicism, Harry's face is a myriad of emotions so tangled in each other that they cannot be discerned into different branches.
Harry stills a little, and Draco tries not to be alarmed by it. "You're not freaked out by it?"
"I don't approve, but this is... nice."
We do NOT wish to trigger anyone who's trying to read and enjoy this story, so if you guys think you need to be warned explicitly about the entailment of this chapter, please go to endnotes.
Shacklebolt points at her. "Get his report over a fire call," he grabs a stack of papers from his right and dumps them on his desk. "We need it closed today."
When the curse is lifted from his body, Umbridge's face is inches from his own, and he jerks back in surprise, his eyes widening. He cannot feel his wand, his only weapon, where is his wand?
"Nothing. Thanks."
Draco feels nauseated, and not at all ready for what's about to come. He's going to burn his flesh close. On two vials of pain relievers.
Just like the corpse of the man next to him, mocking him with his gaping mouth and glassy eyes. Evan cannot hear what the body might be chanting, his ears are whistling so loudly in his head that he cannot even hear what his master is drawling over his head.
Kicking away a can of soda along his way, he enters the park. There are still a couple of stragglers around, but they look like they're leaving. It isn't a big park anyway. He likes it.
"Harry,” Draco smiles wryly, “I used to kidnap bumblebees individually to make a hive in my room. There's no such a thing as crazy. Or bonkers or weird. We're just us. And I like you for you."
"I will floo them straight to the headquarters," he says because Albus is just staring back at him, in no haste to avoid his gaze.
It wasn't a nightmare. It wasn't a dream. Harry
“You and Draco were both injured, and I wasn’t available. Do you really think maintaining discretion should have been given priority if you just ended up killing yourselves?” Severus asks, raising an eyebrow in that deadpan way of his that always made Draco feel small.
Draco wouldn’t lie to him.
"They're my favourite,” Harry juts out his chin, “and yes I have favourites. And yes, because silver and white is sort of your colour scheme. So it matches."
A permanent chill has seeped into his bones, and his own hands have started shaking. The blood on his shoulders, neck, and arm have cooled and have begun the process of drying into annoying itchy flecks, making him shiver harder.
Their faces showed no recognition whatsoever. Maybe rightfully so.
the cloth away. Draco is left too breathless from the sudden sharp pain to even cry out.
She breathes. "There's going to be a siege. They are going to take over the ministry; that's why the dark lord is not present. They will send for your heads."
Next update Saturday, 9th May.
"Okay,” he swipes at his eyes with a free hand, “I love you too."
“C’mon,” he grits his teeth and manages to stand, Harry wringing his hands beside him. Draco puts one arm around Harry’s and the boy manages not to crumple under him.
"Let me see them," he says, looking at the hands Harry’s trying to hide. The bag falls off his shoulder with a subdued plop on the carpet. The same brown as the hallway.
The boy knows who he is. He knows that Severus works for Dumbledore and he still dares question him right this second? The torture must have gotten to his head.
He never unpacked his school trunk. That should make things easier. All he needs is some clothes, and his cloak that's wrapped around his photo album. The situation seems urgent enough that Harry doesn't think they'd question the padlocks on the cupboard at all.
"I got it from the closet. It was a little bent up, but I could tell that it was magical, and I fixed up some of the bent bristles."
Except when she looks inside, the boy is gone.
"It's not," Draco agreed reluctantly. "If you want to stay until you finish the bathroom, that's fine." He stood and poured his untouched soup back into the pot, and walked up the stairs, avoiding everyone's eyes and not responding to any of their calls.
“Well,” Draco begins dramatically. “First of all, I already know a lot of these. If Hogwarts didn't let mu-uhhh the
"You think I'm like this because I survived Voldemort's killing curse? Or some combination? Why would he want me to time travel?"
"It is nineteen hundred and twenty two, young man," Flamel tells him. "May we ask what year you travel from?"
"But it's not!" Harry exclaims in frustration. Especially if Dumbledore's gone. Snape probably orchestrated it all so that he could break in when there was the least security.
Next to him, Draco tilted his head so far to the side that it touched Teddy's. "I don't see it."
"I really wish I knew more magic to be able to protect myself when I traveled," Harry remarks as they sit down at Flamel's table for tea some minutes later. "I can't seem to control where or when I travel to, what if I went straight to V- a dark wizard?"
“You’ve never mentioned traveling to the future!” Draco exclaims. “What’s it like?”
"Okay. What d'you need me to do?" Ron asks when they're sure they're alone in the dorm.
“I was looking right at him when it happened! I should know!”
“And this has nothing to do with the fact that you could remember this in the future and bet on the score with your friends?”
“That’s because I am Harry. That Harry was me when I was younger, just after I had gotten cursed. It slowed down after a while, but then I got hit with the same curse again a few years ago, and I’ve been traveling a lot lately.”
By the end of the night, they've lost even more people: Hagrid is being sent to Azkaban and Dumbledore is no longer Headmaster. And they're no closer to getting Hermione back or figuring out who the Heir is.
They'd never had such fun days before Harry, Teddy thought. There were days off, but they were for going home or for staying in the manor to answer the door when Draco was out on business. They'd never taken a day off to just relax like this, and Teddy couldn't help but be excited over how much their little family had grown and changed over the past few months. Yes, the Lord of the Waste was still out there, but Teddy was coming to understand that there would always be bad people in the world, and it was his job as an apprentice wizard to put good magic into the world to combat it.
"I call a rematch!" Harry declares, and Draco doesn't wait for him to get up before he releases the snitch and runs after it, blocking Harry from passing by him.
Draco nods. He expects it will be the same speech he received last year:
And then a horrible thought occurs to Draco. "It's not, is it? Please tell me I don't marry Pansy in the future!"
He tries to whisper a word in Parseltongue but it doesn't come. He guesses he has to be in front of a snake for it to work.
"I'm sure the two of us-"
They have never received this many messages a day before. Kingsley may have to ask Moody for a division merge if this goes on. "Julia, message Moody," He says, standing from his chair. "We might need to merge."
Draco heaves a sigh before moving his hands to unbutton his shirt, shuddering slightly. But when he moves to open it, it doesn’t move. Breath hitching, he pulls a little harder, wincing when the shirt is stuck to his wounds, and then gasping when the wince catches on the cut at his cheek.
"You're driving yourself mad, locked up in this place, getting drunk--"
Minerva glares at him in a way that would have made a student cry, and then turns away. Tensed. Enraged. Severus has seen that look on her only a few times before. "They're slandering my student and the Headmaster of the most prestigious school in the entirety of the Scottish Isles. I don't see how you could be calm. You have to refute this, of course…"
"No," he crosses his arms, it's really cold now, the tips of his fingers are numb, they're in an alleyway, narrow, narrower than the entrance to Knockturn Alley. Behind a bakery shop.
There’s a flurry of feathers and wings, mixed together with loud, obnoxious squacks as Harry pulls himself up. It’s all so chaotic that Draco takes several steps back, almost tempted to take his wand out.
Right. The library.
"You okay there, lad?"
John only nods and lets his Quill scribble away at the parchment, blackening one line after the other.
‘That’s too vulgar,’ Sirius responds. ‘Let’s try that spitting idea, if I were to turn into a dragon,’
No one talks during dinner, and Harry feels responsible for the uncomfortable glances and subdued dialogue around the table. He doesn't eat much either, even though he hasn't had anything to eat since that piece of toast that morning, and the chocolate bulks Sirius and Mrs. Weasley forced down his throat.
, do you hear me?” Severus doesn’t look up from his work as he speaks, and it's an effort to keep his own hands steady. The adrenaline rush is tapering down.
Everyone, please pay attention to the warnings. They’re important and put there for your benefit, we don't want to hurt anyone, do not take any of them lightly.
"Alright. Yeah, okay. I'll tell Hermione that too."
"They are?"
"His identification." Harry pushes the card across the table for Draco to see, there’s a tiny square picture of a man, and a series of numbers that don’t really make sense. Draco hums, an identification card, that seems rather smart. Not that he’s going to admit that aloud.
His body doesn't listen to him anymore, and his mind, that's a whole other issue in itself.
"Under control my-"
That’s interesting, Harry thinks, but pushes the thoughts aside to deal with them later at a better time and place. “Draco needs help, Twinky. I need water, lots of water and… um a rag, and anything that could reduce his fever. Could you get me those things?”
When the screams in his head die down, he realises with a jolt that it's not his head and temples that are pulsing in pain, but his scar that's aching.
'This is getting scary, kiddo,' Sirius says from his right. He looks weird, ragged and fatigued. Sort of exactly how Harry is feeling at the moment.
They find a scone, and a cup with a lid that had cold coffee in it. Harry pours the foul, cold liquid on the sidewalk, then stores the cup with the scone.
The squeezing suffocating feeling engulfs him and then he’s gone with a pop.
His mother’s urgency that he learn it certainly made sense now.
His mind is reeling and his chest still feels hollow, as if a huge chunk of it is just missing. His wand is almost crushed in a vice grip in his left hand and Harry fumbles for the house keys with a frown.
"Sure thing." She says, her name tag--That's a thing in the muggle world- reads Maggie.
Draco hums, and then frowns, "Um… should be fifteen more minutes? I wanted to wake you but…"
Fingers curling around his wand, he turns, imagining the cottage around himself as clearly as he can. The familiar place, Harry sitting on the couch, smiling at him. The fireplace flickering. The seagulls waddling.
getting hurt? Don’t you get enough attention already?” Not that any of that attention has been good recently.
Harry freezes, then blinks once. Before his hands drop like dead weight to the bed.
in the graveyard, when that vile scaley finger had touched his scar, nearly splitting his head in two with a kind of pain, that was to this day, still unimaginable to Harry.
Moody's fake eye swivels unnervingly as he stares at Bill. "The same way he knew his way to the kitchen?"
"I'll drain your filthy blood, then, I will chop up your dried carcass and hand it over to my lord. He's the one getting leftovers from
It wasn't just Evan. There had been others. Bella was the worst. She had absolutely mauled the Potter boy, oh Evan knew, the brat would never be the same again, Evan knows this, but he cannot say so, he cannot breath and he doesn't dare utter a word.
'Something is happening right now,’ Sirius is walking beside him, and glances back at Draco over his shoulder before continuing, ‘Those weren’t dreams, but you weren't awake. Were you awake?'
This throbbing ache makes him even more nauseous. He needs to wash his face, anything to cool his scar down a bit. He kicks the covers off with a small grunt and scrambles to his feet, his hand still tightly clasped against his scar. It feels inflamed under his palm, and a bit wet, Harry suspects that to be sweat, and prays that it's not blood.
"You handled them beautifully.” Ron grins back, taking her hand in his, “You did great--"
Potter is too slow, for some reason. She sends another stunner at Potter and the boy barely dodges the curse before lunging himself to the right, crashing into her decorative cat shrine upon a table. Draco stifles a groan and grips his wand tighter.
Ron smiles at Hermione, kind of how James used to do when marvelling at Lily's brilliance, and Remus, once again, wants to sigh and roll his eyes. They're dating. Go figure.
He stops abruptly, at a distance from the dementors. Harry can no longer see them. But the cold is still there.
"You're running the bloody school," Rosier drags Draco to his side, his hand tight enough to grind Draco's bones. "You cannot just leave your post. Stand back and damage control. Until our Lord summons you,"
"Not much," he mutters, looking down at his toes. "I just came down. I'm sorry."
“Mr. Malfoy--”
"No!” Draco says quickly, “I mean, yes. Yes, we can be friends, no,” Draco wants to smack himself, “Not can, we are. We are friends, Potter." He clears his throat at the end, as if it would make him any less of a bumbling fool.
Draco doesn't quite know what to do with the information so he just shrugs, running a finger on the chipped swirly tabletop. There's a small piece of carrot left there, desolate and alone. Draco stares at it.
with Potter, but dear god is it addictive.
The door is ajar.
"Um…” He swallows, “yeah. I think that's it. When we reach safety, it'll be fine."
"I know I'm counting right," he is. He was. He knows where he left off, he just- he has to just recall it right. There’s nothing wrong with his memory.
When Draco wakes up, it’s to pain.
His initial reaction should have been sneering in disgust, but it's not. She's just like them, if not cleaner, and she's smiling at them, even though they look worse for wear.
“Harry? Can you hear me?” Draco asks, his own voice shaking as he cradles Harry’s head, “Please.”
"Essence of Dittany, Murtlap essence, blood replenishing potion. I didn't know it was poisoned."
They're not here.
"Come on sir!" Hermione slides the parchment back to him, "We've done worse!"
“This location is discreet," he tries to sound soothing. Torture victim. Potter is a torture victim, fragile mentality, all that deranged details that Severus could care less about. He should care now. "No one knows of it, no one ever will. You will never, listen very carefully,
He might be able to escape Draco, but he can't run away from himself.
Evan does not have a single bit of coherency left in him. It hurts. It hurts too much to think, to be, to
"Harry,"
His godfather was right. It's miraculous how good Potter is at cooking when he was absolutely bonkers at potions.
He sweeps into the bag the four nearest vials of Harry’s nerve soothers, stomach clenching at the thought of Harry needing them now more than ever. A couple spare rolls of bandages also go in. Dittany, and the last five vials of pain potions. Severus was supposed to restock the next time he came in.
"Yes, yes. Kingsley, take a seat."
"And--"
Severus nods and gives him a small unlabeled jar. "Apply it twice everyday. Preferably after showering and before going to bed."
Sometime last week, Harry had started a little game he'd liked to call '
"I won't take the bait," she turns away from him seemingly from the lack of interest, "You might as well stop."
"Hey," Harry croaks, blinking his eyes hard, "Draco?"
Not that he could’ve said no to Remus. He’s never been able to do that. Remus always knew the right spots to hit, what to say, how to make the perfect expressions. Even James couldn’t have done it.
, he begs in his head, a never-ending mantra.
"You can leave now." He dismisses the elf. "Thank you Twinky."
The curse that Rosier put on Harry before parting will be featured greatly in the last arc of this installment in our series, and while not explored too explicitly, still we feel compelled to take care of our lovely readers.
As Draco sets the kettle to boil he realizes that he has more in common with these birds than he had realized. They're both being domesticized, and what's worse… Draco doesn't mind this.
He imagines that, since the start of the year, he had lost more than a pint of blood to this quill. He could have easily felt better if he had donated the same amount instead of it being tortured out of him. There's no way he can stop this now. At this point, she won't even need to make up a reason for assigning him detentions. She's the Headmistress now, she can make a whole decree just for Harry.
Both of them crumple into a bed of hay at the same time, their legs giving out beneath them. The hay prickles his skin, but it’s better than the cold and also rotting floorboards of the place. He can hear Harry’s wheezing breath beside him.
Remus gulps down the last of his tea, and rolls his shoulders.
Harry feels a scowl creep up his face, “In case you've suddenly gone blind, it’s you who walked in on me, Malfoy.”
"He is
This is most likely the most surreal experience of his life. If this is what's bound to happen when he's just taking a walk, Harry shudders to think of picnics and Quidditch competitions from now on.
Rosier's hand snakes down to his waist again.
“It’s you who’s lurking in a girls’ bathroom like a ghost,” Malfoy says, turning his wand over and over in his long fingers.
?” Severus shoots back. Potter’s breath is loud and raspy.
Severus isn't sure where Potter is going with this, but there's one thing he
"I don't like this amount of sass and disrespect, Mr. Potter," Severus finally says.
' I hate it when you act so stupid. You're smart. Smarter than this,' Sirius crosses his arms.
Kingsley rolls his eyes and signs the bottom of the parchment, reaching for another as he rolls this one. "Work on it harder," he tells Tonks, passing her cluttered desk in a flurry to get to the stack of closed cases. "Robert? Where is yours? " he asks the room as his eyes don't pin down Robert immediately.
“You pretend to know things about me that you don’t. Sloppy work, Pansy.”
he thinks, definitely not worth it.
"What are you talking about?” Harry frowns as if it should be obvious. “They're my best friends."
"I see no need," Albus says, gesturing for Minerva to take her seat. Her mug of tea is already ready and kept on the table.
"What, you're just allowing me to leave?"
"Yes. They've been notified of your general wellbeing. Not the location, obviously."
That's blood. He realizes it almost an instant before he looks into the mirror again. The reflection is not him, it's a memory.
Harry starts slowly, and the cloak comes off easy enough. But as soon as it's off, a slow trickle of blood starts down his spine and arm again.
"They're gone. Your mission was beautifully executed," Evan bows his head.
"Nothing." Draco says, very slowly. "I was bored,"
Harry clenches his freaking hands, and breathes. Just breathes for a moment.
It was run, or die. And Harry can't run when he's away.
Harry stares at him and finally sees the third person push past Moody with a jovial grin. "Hi there, Harry!" the short woman with pink bubblegum hair waves at him but then walks right past him to the front door with her wand pointed to the locks.
On the way to the dungeons, Severus doesn’t encounter any other Death Eaters and doesn’t know if he should be relieved or suspicious. He settles for suspicion and asserts more confidence into his stride even as he remains cautious.
Tonks's hair flares a deep purple as Mrs. Weasley mentions her full name, but she doesn't do anything other than mildly frown.
Draco feels strangely calm as he follows Umbridge down the stairs. He knows there is no way in hell that she is just 'accompanying him to his dormitory'.
Harry, much to his surprise, shrugs.
Severus slowly inclines his head, and Draco slumps back into his chair, unsure of how he should be feeling. He's glad that his father isn't suffering any longer than he should have, but he shouldn't be glad that his father is dead at all.
"Maybe Monday afternoon will suffice?" Umbridge says and Harry gulps, dropping his hand to his side, vaguely feeling the dark blood dripping down his fingers upon the stone floor.
"I'm done with you! Crucio!"
"Obviously, yeah. So… are we good?"
"I brought you soothers," he says but Harry doesn't even seem to hear him. Everything feels so stuffy even in the cold.
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, description of injury, mentions of character death and torture.
different to him. Draco doesn’t need any silly nicknames to see that, to prove it. Harry is the most special person in Draco’s life. He’s never felt this way about anyone, not even any of his obsessions had commanded as much attention from him as Harry does, or for so long.
"Do it," the pain relievers have helped reduce the pain a bit, but he still feels it numbing his entire arm.
'He is a snake.'
"I bashed Rosier's face in, with my foot. And I splattered Mr. Malfoy’s brain all over the floor. And I stood and watched as they killed Mrs. Malfoy, and you were there too! And you did nothing and Draco has lost so much already, and I'm responsible for it and I'm pretending that it's nothing and you're doing the same thing and that's not fair-"
Sirius had told him that once, in one of his letters as Snuffles. As Harry's eyes open and his scar sears in pain, he finds himself loathing Sirius and his metaphoric logic.
"Hm,” Draco says, tilting his head as his mind automatically starts listing off the subjects of his obsessions in his mind. “I was obsessed with our Manor's floors for the longest time, my mother's wand, then bees, for some reason… you were the first person that really interested me."
"Oh God," he looks positively green, "This is my fault, oh my God…" he bows his head, a hand masking his mouth as if to keep the bile firmly down his throat.
He raises three fingers to count off each, "First one when Lois Jones wanted to bang but you said you had a crush on her, second one, you asking me not to pull the dragon manure prank on Lily because she was pregnant, and third was the day you wanted to get a tattoo but chickened out and binged on ice cream instead."
"Miss them?" he asks as Harry pushes them up his nose.
Draco follows, for a lack of a better thing to do. When he moves to take the glasses, Harry tells him not to bother. He quickly settles down beside Harry, the warmth from his body is sinfully comforting.
Harry yells in surprise and almost falls over, but Draco holds him upright.
“Wass’at,” he slurs. Draco gives him a half-hearted sneer as he pushes another vial against his lips.
Draco turns his head to look at him, "If it was for a good cause, which it was, I'd say it's not too morally corrupt."
"When you're dripping all over the school's bathroom, it is. I happen to care about the sanitation of this place, I’m a prefect, you know."
Harry looks surprised, "You've been to Florean Fortescue? I've never seen you there."
The orange glow of the fire is really faint at first, Harry bows down and starts blowing on the kindle, cupping his hands over the amber.
“Detentions.”
*We are shifting to an alternate Friday update schedule now.
There are so many things lining the tiny store shelves, Draco recognizes crisps and beans for some reason. The muggle behind the counter is old, staring right at him.
"Actually, no. I just thought I would replace my father one day. It doesn't leave any room for other career prospects,” Draco shrugs, but Harry knows grief when he sees it. Draco quickly changes focus.  “You?” He lights up, “Wait! Let me guess… Quidditch player."
After a few minutes of periodically freaking out, and crouching over to check on Draco’s rising temperature, Harry really cannot handle any more of this.
"The effects of the poison fade the moment you die from it, rendering your death into a tragic, albeit natural accident," Severus interrupts.
"Okay…” He swallows, “Okay, I'm sure we can find someplace…" He squints out in the rain, unable to really see through the barrage of water.
It's just a vast nothingness. Just sand, and the waves and the cottage far away.
“There’s always a way out of anything. I know that from experience. If our gig is up, then my fate would be just as gruesome as yours, if not worse. At least you’ll get to die. I’m the one who has to live with the guilt of killing you and dooming the wizarding world.”
"No time, girl," Moody snaps. "Don't you know that those damn things hunt in herds? Kingsley is the bait. Let him do his job,"
"The bleeding was too excessive, for such a small cut." He’s supposed to be
Harry finally decides to open the chocolate frog wrap. "Only if you stop nagging at me about Cedric."
"Why can't it be me?!"
Stay safe and on the edge of your seats, and tell us ALL about your favorite scenes.
Draco turns to face Harry again, who is methodically shuffling his hand inside the can. "Found another one," he says, with no amount of excitement and pulls out a loaf of bread.
"Harry?" He whispers. What could Harry possibly be doing there?
. Not as good as he could, but better than his last messy attempt.
“Telly is short for Television.” Harry is patient as he explains, something that wouldn’t really have been possible before… all this. “It’s a radio of some sort but has moving images on it, and I was painting the windows because Uncle Vernon said I had to, as a chore.”

Selfish wants win out in the end and he makes his way over to the astronomy tower. Draco really knows his potions. Or healing. Or whatever. Harry doesn't need a label for what Malfoy is doing. The boy himself had named it 'Blackmailing' and Harry refused to see it for what it was. 'Helping'.
Draco closes his eyes. "I’ll rather starve."
After all, Harry saw
an unwavering constant. The man peers into his eyes.
. And he should have been screaming long ago, given the state he is in, there was no way he could have stayed so silent, and it had been so
"Harry," he squeezes the boy's hand again. "It's fine."
He’s filled with a strong sense of foreboding as he hands it over to Dumbledore.
"Slandering your name, and Potter's." Minerva sighs with a set jaw. "Oh for Merlin's sake! That boy's relatives just died!"
think about the heaviness on his face Draco becomes aware of the shift in silence. It's dimmer, in a way and Draco's ears pick up on it almost immediately.
. It was almost four in the morning. What were they doing up?
Harry doesn't like that. He doesn't like the implications of that at all.
"Honestly," Draco had told him this morning, "Fuck Severus. But let's cut him some slack for being a control freak. He saved our lives."
His robes swish upon the damp ground, and his eyebrow crooks once he comes to a stop in front of a closed shop. Rosier regards the shop for a moment and then draws his wand, his shoulders drawn back.
She doesn't, not until the fucking silver spoon is put away and she raises her steaming cup to take a small sip, not breaking eye-contact with Harry even once, not until the cup is back on her desk and her cats are throwing a fit on the walls. Harry contemplates if Azkaban is really that bad compared to this.
“No,” Albus whispers, and Severus’ heart sinks. The locket opens with a soft click, and it's… Just that. A locket, with a piece of yellowing paper folded into a tiny square inside.
"Well, then it must be wrong," Umbridge interrupts him sweetly, tapping the clock with mock disappointment on her face.
Ron flushes a deep shade of vermilion and shoves the papers away. "Yeah, well. That. Things aren't going to improve with that toad in charge of the school,"
His hands, Severus notices with some satisfaction, actually shake a little less than they did the last time he'd seen them. Not by a wide margin, but noticeable to the observing eye. Though the boy might not have noticed it himself. Potter is fidgeting under his stare now.
Then he had rolled the parchment into an extremely thin roll, shrunk it to the size of his thumb and then slid it into the open nook of the golden quill. Sufficiently hidden out of sight.
"Listen very carefully Potter, I'm only going over this once. We'll run to the stairs. We enter the study and head
Harry shakes his head violently, and squeezes harder at his arms, willing the sharp pins and needles sensation to go away, "You're not even real."
He could be alive right now only to die in the two-minute delay it takes for Draco to run to the cottage.
"I created this poison, it's a slow-acting one,” Severus is speaking, “subtle enough to slip right past any skilled healer."
Before he can come up with any offensive spell in his panic-induced state, Val speaks up, “No, lower the wand right now, Draco. I wasn't hurting him."
With a frown, and his mouth curled down, Harry wrenches the worn gardening gloves off his hands and dumps them in the weed-filled bucket. He feels hot and dizzy, both indicative signs of spending too much time under the sun. He should probably go and cool down before his brain fries.
Remus hates damage control.
His wand is well hidden but within reach, in the giant pocket of his sagging jeans as he walks. It's always on him. Lately, even breathing feels hard if he is without his wand. He feels too exposed, too vulnerable, too
Hermione hums. "We've heard Sirius mention it in passing. He doesn't like talking about his past much. He talks about you a lot, though."
"Who says so?" She answers, her voice is like silk, but dangerously low. Evan hears her stepping closer. She sounds heavy, as if wearing armour. Evan shouldn't be surprised, she always used to wear those beneath her robes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry huffs, "Well, it's there. I know it's weird, I don't usually go out of my way to make people aware of the freaky things I think about and--"
"I'm guessing that's bad," Harry says.
"What if it's a trap?" Potter asks but is following him out of the cell, nonetheless. Staggering, but more or less upright.
Turning his head to the side, he looks over at Harry’s face. He almost looks peaceful, serene. Almost being the key word. The tear tracks haven’t quite disappeared from his face, and there is a crease between his brows, and the occasional trembling. Harry had slept considerably less than Draco, however much that was.
John Wallwind twirls his wand and the charmed camera stops. Even magic cannot cure some images. Minister Fudge smiles at him with a force that prunes his eyes and gestures at John to take a seat.
"We'll do it," Hermione answers for the both of them.
When Harry picks up the knife, Draco swallows. He's not ready for this. It's going to hurt. A lot.
Harry wants to slap the revolting touch away but everything is too heavy. Everything is so slow. There's a pit of wrongness at the bottom of his stomach.
He starts walking, very precariously in one direction, Rosier's boots on his feet make no sound upon impact with the mirror's surface. It's eerie, but somewhat comforting.
Potter's eyes narrow, and Severus can almost
“You will be safe here.” Severus says. He stands, vanishing the tattered remains of Draco’s shirt and casts a
“We need to--” he gasps out, vision tunnelling as he tries to get up, “We need to leave.”
**spoilers**
Sweet, gentle, loving.
The possibilities are endless and terrifying.
"They are friends with each other,” he shrugs, perhaps with the exception of Blaise.
He crouches down next to Harry, and the boy mumbles something unintelligible.
Of course, it doesn't, he realises with a sinking feeling in his chest. The Dursleys have locked him in again.
"Listen to me," he hastens his steps and drags Draco along with him, "I need you… to go inside that store, and ask the person behind the counter for 'Jar of pickled garlic', there is a huge chance that they won't have it, okay?"
"Twinky does not know, Sir," she stammers out and Harry nods, carefully, meticulously lowering the vial on the ground. He doesn't want to break the vial by accident. For some reason, he doesn't seem to be able to get his hands to stop shaking.
"Leaving now, Severus?" Albus asks over his steaming mug. Severus just looks at him with a knowing frown.
"No," Draco firmly says, "I'm not sleeping."
"Professor McGonagall would have had a harder time with our pitch," Hermione agrees and also reaches for her bag and a shot of dread surges down Remus's spine.
"Without warm-ups? Are you insane, Ron? Come on, shed the books and the binder, Hermione go change your clothes, and Ron stop dissing my eating habits. I'm rocking the beer-cereal cuisine." He honestly thinks that’s the only thing keeping him sane right now. And Remus.
He wasn't supposed to snatch Potter and the Malfoy brat, he wasn't even supposed to meet up with the pink bitch to help reign in two bloody teenagers. His mission had nothing to do with them or Umbridge.
"My potion master, my precious double agent is also gone, so is a valuable flood of information that I was gathering of Albus Dumbledore and the boys you kidnapped," Evan cannot understand a thing he's hearing anymore.
The forest.
Harry hums as he walks, glancing at Draco every once in a while.
“My little dragon,” Lucius sounds brittle, but with a soft smile, a smile Severus hadn’t seen on his face in several years. The words make something clench in Severus’ heart as he thinks about Narcissa.
“All great achievements require time.” -Maya Angelou
He still has detentions with her. Not held in Dumbledore's office, as it had been completely sealed shut upon the man's departure, but instead in her own pink splashed, cat littered villainous lair. In many ways, Harry is relieved that he doesn't have to serve any torture sessions in the man's office.
But then Harry’s turning to him with his face set in mounting horror. And Draco realises the burning pain in his shoulder isn’t because Harry’s gripping it too tightly. Because Harry’s hands are no longer on him and they’re… very
“We don’t have to go very far now,” Harry says softly. Draco purses his lips and looks ahead of himself, the gravel crunching under their feet as they walk. It’s just miles of green ahead. He can’t see any sort of buildings other than a couple of abandoned farms left to the weather.
“Farewell, Potter.” Severus turns away, unable to bear the sight of Potter’s trembling form any longer.
A laugh bubbles up in his chest, God, they’d been having dinner and talking about Draco’s crush on Harry and now Harry was gone and probably being tortured.
"Outrageous, Albus! Have you read this… this piece of garbage?!"
Draco isn’t as surprised. He knows that Severus brewed potions for the dark lord, he knew Severus is great at potions. So really, it was only a matter of time until one backfired.
Remus looks at him for a second, weirdly as if he's wondering the same thing, before saying, "They'll be informed of a suitable reason for your absence. And once you're gone, the dementors won't be coming back."
Remus sighs, "They need someone to teach them offensive spells and war tactics so they can teach it to the others."
Draco watches.
"No, it's not!” Harry snaps, and then quickly softens his voice, “I swear I knew it. Um... something with S. Maybe,” he taps his chin, “We need to buy a map too."
"I've heard a lot about you since I came here Mr. Potter," she starts and Harry instantly knows that he's not going to like this. "From what I've heard you seemed very close to Albus Dumbledore."
"Fuck off."
Then his eyes land on Rosier’s corpse. “Harry.”
"Yes, yes, both of which have little to do with politics. I just want to make sure that my people are aware of all the risks and consequences of mutiny." Fudge’s eyes are intense and trained on Kinglsey in an almost uncanny way.
Harry's eyes tear up.
Voldemort regards him for a moment. "I'm pleased with you, enough to entrust something of utmost importance upon you."
Draco's mumbling gets louder-a rather disjointed monologue about bees-, and as they finally move out of the cell that Severus locks with a flick of his wand, his eyes flutter at the crude light hanging above them in the damp hallway.
"Well, John," Fudge says, wiping his mouth with the napkin. "I wouldn't quite call it a Death Eater attack. A bit too strong-worded, isn't it?"
The only person happy with this transition, is surely Black, and his goons. Because that daft man believes that having another person trapped in a cage with him would relieve him of his depression. But it wouldn't. It would perish Potter.
Straightening up, he runs out and down the stairs. He has to-- the diaries.
"I'm booked for the day, baby," the man winks at him, unfazed, "Me and this beer bottle have a getaway plan."
"Merlin," he drops his wand and slowly detaches his back from the front door. Harry closes his eyes and tries to stifle a hysterical chuckle. "Hedwig."
"I promised them safety,” Albus crumples the note in his hand, holding up the locket by its chain. Staring at it as if it’d had the answers. “The same as I did to you, and they--"
“Please, Harry,” Draco whispers as he lowers him back down to the floor, where Harry sits leaning against a damp wall. His fingers clutch at Draco’s sweater for a few seconds before he loosens his white-knuckled grip reluctantly.
"We're stranded in the middle of nowhere, we can't use magic and your shoulder…"
"It's really not."
Except that, of course, it's not. It never is in politics.
Surprisingly, Harry's body doesn't push on the urge to vomit as he stares at Draco and thinks of his father's swift demise. Harry lets his eyes flutter close with Draco in his sight, a comforting presence in spite of their unfortunate predicament.
“Leave, Nott.” Severus takes vindictive pleasure in seeing Nott’s scowl as he is interrupted again. There is relief too, if he’d just started, there is a possibility that Potter might not be completely incapacitated.
"I do know that. Yeah."
'You can't dream anymore. That is a big fucking deal,’ Sirius runs his eyes over Draco, ‘He's asleep… you need to--'
Harry's body hates him for having to endure this again. And it curses Harry as vehemently as Harry screams.
"You're right-handed, and this is in your handwriting, not self-harm, yet curiously done persistently, otherwise the cuts wouldn't be so deep,"
It strikes Severus once more, how young Potter is in the face of something like this. The boy is embarrassed of being tortured. Of surviving Bellatrix Lestrange. He's just a boy.
But he already knows, doesn't he? They'd probably had more reason than him to be awake, and judging by Moody's leg and their looks, they'd probably gone out on some kind of 'mission' and returned recently. He almost wants to ask if anyone was seriously hurt, but then changes his mind. They wouldn't be talking like that if someone were, and they wouldn't bother telling him if that were the case either.
“Okay,” Harry whispers, his hand giving a small awkward pat to Draco’s back. “Okay, I am going to remove the cloak now, Draco. Alright?”
His eyes move around the room, trying to get used to the new environment. It’s quite pleasant, if one thinks about it. And now that he’s had a pain reliever potion, his shoulder is no longer in excruciating pain. The scratches feel pretty ignorable. He can actually focus.
Ron flushes, "Oh yeah?"
"You were all here?" He asks, his voice is low, but seems thunderous, as not a single peep arises from anyone else. "All summer. You were all here,"
"Stop that," Harry tells him but takes the offered treat nonetheless. "I'm not a child." This Sirius, unsurprisingly, doesn't act like the imaginary one at all, and Harry guiltily thinks that he likes the one in his head better.
He summons his potions kit while waving his wand in a simple diagnostic charm. Albus’ breathing is shallow and loud, which Severus tries to ignore.
Until then, he's just going to lie there, and do absolutely nothing.
"I read it in the papers," he didn't. Remus came to him, dragged him out of bed, pulled him in the corner of the common room, and rapidly fired off the facts at Harry's face before claiming that he had to leave. It left Harry feeling very put out, and slightly shaken.
Harry is gaping as he looks at her, and then Ron, who looks kind of greyish, and Sirius, who looks like he wants to grab him again.
"That's my face," Harry cannot help mutter.
Curses. That's what justifies this whole mess.
Twinky is still standing away from them, and he sighs. He doesn’t have the energy to make his way over. Harry isn’t even an option. “Come here.”
Harry cannot help it, his eyebrows rise and his jaw slackens. They've never left him alone in the house before. What if they lock him in?
What did it matter? He asks himself as he rounds the narrow corridor, his eyes idly running along the dark marble floor. Quite an exquisite taste, Evan has to admit.
The man had saved his life, after all. More than once. He even did it today, by catching Harry's poisoned hand by pure luck. Granted, the poison is his creation to begin with, but Harry prefers to look at the silver lining. If it weren't for him, Harry would have most likely been dead in a few days' time, especially with the rapid pace with which he was consuming those nerve soothers. Not only they didn't work, but also accelerated his potential murder.
Once again, thanks to our awesome Beta for the editing! We won't hold you any longer, read on!
Draco snorts, "That you did."
Surely the trouble of getting Remus here wasn't worth the trouble they could cause. Remus is under so many glamour charms that even he wouldn't be able to recognize himself.
Harry’s hand is unusually cold in his own, but then again, so is Draco’s. He can feel it tremble against his grip, but thankfully, it doesn't seem worse than before, earlier that morning or last night. It’s not better, but not worse.
Harry throws a confused glance at his direction, before his eyes clear with realisation, he turns back to the eggs, “Oh yeah, Snape gave them to me the other day.”
"Can you walk by yourself?" he asks, and holds Draco upright by his waist, throwing one of the boy's lanky arms over his neck as he holds his wand in his other hand.
Twinky disappears and Harry sags down once more. Lately, it takes so much effort to stay upright, and Harry would much rather lie down, with his eyes closed and his mind not concerned by anything. He wants the luxury of laying around and doing nothing, but with Draco’s condition and his own predicament, he doubts he’ll ever get to have such a thing.
They’ve been walking for over an hour now.
"And it's not our fault either," Ron says. "It just had to happen. We're sorry that we were cooped here and you were with the muggles, if it's any consolation, I don't think we had that much fun either...the other day I cleaned so much that I couldn't feel my hands for the rest of it."
There's silence once more and neither Draco nor Severus are obliged to break it. They are both very much aware of the Dragon in the room. Possibly a very dead one. The miasma of it is almost stifling, and has no place in the brightly lit kitchen.
"One small misstep is all I need before Nagini feasts on your flesh."
“Potter,” Draco slumps back down. Maybe the tortures did affect Harry on a more psychological level.
"Sod off," he sneers back, reeling as he quickly dodges a stunning curse, and prepares to fling a curse in response before the fireplace in Umbridge's office flares green.
Sirius doesn’t startle at the sudden proclamation. His face remains passive. 'Why?'
"Yeah him," Harry's smile expands. The tip of his nose is red. From the cold. Everything is the cold's fault. Although Harry does look a bit cuter like that.
"What led you to look into Mr. Flamel and his work?"
Harry carefully folds the cloak and returns to opening his presents. In addition to chocolate frogs from Ron, a wooden flute from Hagrid, and a 50-pence piece from the Dursley's, he's also got a hand-knitted jumper with an H on it from Mrs. Weasley and a journal from Hermione. Hermione's note says that he should use it to write down what happens when he travels, in case something happens that's important but he doesn't realize at the time. 'The journal will only open for the magical signatures you tell it to,' her note reads, 'so it can be as private as you want.' She goes on to say that of course, it's probable that a highly trained witch or wizard might be able to open it, but it's more private than a muggle journal. Harry guesses he'll take her word for it, as he never had one before.
Harry's eyes glitter like he's keeping a good secret. "We are friends in the future, yes. And I like to think that we're also friends now."
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to criticize them Harry.”
