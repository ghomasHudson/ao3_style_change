hadn't wanted that. He had just wanted to stay on the side he was stood on, mostly hidden behind the other kids, kids he knew, who were familiar and comforting in their familiarity, kids who were fighting to take the Dark Lord down, and how he wanted them to succeed by that point! He could feel all of their eyes on him when he stepped over, judging him, ashamed of him, not expecting any betterof him because why would they. He had tried to say no, tried in his heart to make a stand, to be like – and this shames him to tears three times a day – to be more like Neville had been – but then he had heard his mother's voice, he had remembered the danger to her and his father in ever defying – Voldemort – it feels like a little win in his head every time he allows himself to think the name – and he couldn't do it to her. Besides, Potter was dead and he was a coward; what more was there?
And they're laughing breathlessly, messily, half crying with the relief of it as the winds around them fall still.

“Of all the awesome magical things we could be doing to usher in the new Millennium and you're all dragging me to some crummy muggle festivity -” he gripes happily.

“What?”
he's not to blame for.

“Anything?”

“Like drunk only stupid,” Luna adds - “What?” She shrugs when Pansy frowns at her - “Stoned is a state of mind, just think yourself into it if you really want to be.”

“Gobby, aren't you?”
“I have to talk to you.”

fuck him in the same house as the in – laws. He knows without a doubt that he will and he aches with how much he suddenly needs this. Draco clearly sees enough of a fraction of this in Harry's face because he smirks and stands up, pushing the stool in neatly and he walks past Harry, accidentally on purpose walking into him and whispering -

“Maybe I wake him up,” she shrugs, standing. She peers across the corridor to where two women are hugging, at least one of them crying, in the opposite drawing room.
that person, sometimes he drives Harry bonkers with his arrogant self esteem and poise and perfection and snooty superior preciousness. Sometimes, he thinks he's the best thing that could happen to anybody, like his very bloody presence is doing them a favour just like the brat who offered him his hand on their first day at school. And then sometimes, sometimes he's the worst person who ever lived, alternately useless, pathetic, wretched or evil, appalling and cruel. Harry will never understand how one person can simultaneously be all of those things, however hard he tries.

somehow only glows eerily throughout the shelves, casting bars from the shadows of the stairs across the floors. Ron heads to the back and Draco wanders curiously between the rows, and George – George stands in the darkened joke shop and feels something immense and awful roil up in his chest like a whale breaking the surface. He doesn't know what it is – if it was the fact that Angelina made him able to feel something again – a little hurt, a little hope – or if it's the way Draco looks at him and nods with so much empathy when he hears the hitch George makes in his throat – but something. Something unlocks in his chest amongst the unexploded fireworks and trick candies, and he stands in the aisles and starts to cry. He cries until he's kneeling, half puddled on the joke shop floor, half screaming with the pain in his half heart.
“Are you
Whatever it is they say next is drowned out by a knock on the front door and Hermione excuses herself to answer it, looking back curiously over her shoulder as she goes. It's Luna.
“Fuck off,” Draco glares, but he does not dare turn round so he glares down at the stonework, his eyes running from the wind, mostly the wind - “Fuck off, you sound just like -”
The letters were something of a surprise on several different levels. Not so much that McGonagall knew exactly who was living together – this apparently is a must have talent for any Hogwarts head – but that an eighth year was happening at all. Somehow – easily enough, perhaps, in the trauma and nightmare of their seventh year – they had all rather forgotten that they had none of them quite finished school, forgotten that they might still be children, in that respect, at least for maybe a year more. The letters catch them at a point where Hermione and Ron are visiting; somehow it seems obvious that they did, as though McGonagall would have known that too – and they all of them gather in the newly rainbow upstairs living room to discuss it, the children – if that's what they still get to be, sat around on the sofas and the adults perched around the corners, letting it be known that they are there for support but that the choice is up to the ones holding the letters.
Draco comes away from the window, he slips the cloak off, hands it back just a little unwillingly. He shudders.

Draco blinks so rapidly in his double take that it's almost comical.
“And so am I?” he finishes without malice, only sadness.
Draco's mouth twists back into the old smile, the real one, not the sneer or the smirk, but the one from the boy who first offered to be friends; second name terms is always their code, as it it were, that things are alright again, the disdain with which they say them a humorous parody of what it once was.

For another over long moment they sip tea in silence. This time Hermione determines not to break it, forcing them to do some of the work. She takes Teddy so that Andromeda can hold her tea cup.

He wants to smash his face into the mirror, cut off his arm with shards of glass, break his own wand and forget every unforgiveable curse, give up and see what happens -

“What?”
“I hope so.”

They can't stop touching and that's alright with Draco; they were meant for this too, he thinks, to fit together, to curl around and about and inside of each other like they were made out of the same stuff and need fusing back together. That or they're just seventeen and horny as hell, because they've been itching for this for so long after all. Not even just sex, although gods it's constant and incredible, but to wander too far apart feels as though it strains on a thread Draco cannot afford to unravel to a longer distance just yet.
“Sorry to disappoint you,” he murmurs - “I didn't want you dead, that's all. I didn't want – didn't want anyone dead – or hurt, and I'm -” his eyes skitter across the floor beneath them as though he can still hear the screams - “I'm sorry about what my aunt did to Granger. That was – gross. Sorry,” he says again, mumbling.
His face feels scourged by the stinging September wind, and he shivers, wanting warmth, wanting balance, wanting this answer desperately for all he makes it sound as though he doesn't.

“Just to let you know about breakfast, dear – you all are welcome to join us.”
“Draco, you always have rehearsal. So you kissed and then what?”
“Uh – yeah -” Harry feels awkward suddenly, as it occurs to him for the first time that if the house had not gone to him it probably ought to have gone to her. “- Sorry,” he adds lamely.
“You'll never stop annoying me.”
“I'm sorry what was your name again?” Jean peers at her curiously.

“Bill?” Fleur presses, insistently - “The attractive one?”

He wants to scream. He has just ducked rapidly out of the third room when somebody grabs him by the wrist and hauls him into the room opposite. It's a small storage room full of cardboard boxes and stacked chairs, a fan of gilt framed paintings balanced against the back wall. He can hardly move for junk and when Potter places himself between Draco and the only door he almost panics, heart pounding in his chest like a butterfly in combat boots. His instincts scream fight or flight but he has pretty much established he's not much in a fight and he can't get past Potter without touching him, which he suddenly feels incredibly loathe to do.
“Fred!” he yells. His brother turns. His heart plummets.
“Shut up.” Draco turns away again quickly.
“Often when I go by the girls are doing this -” Viktor sighs, frowning and shaking his head - “Never have I understood.”
“Hmm,” Hermione nods, thoughtfully, leaning back in her armchair - “Yes, I've been wondering about that.”

Draco raises an eyebrow but decides to be gracious for once this morning and not comment on Potter's knowing this, just like Potter – if he did pick up on it – doesn't comment upon Draco knowing what he drinks either.

tell him, didn't he? All of that emotional outpouring, all those confessions made, the start he felt they had begun towards something beautiful, and now Draco won't make eye contact, won't speak to him, has in fact gone back to a positively second year level of sneering at him behind his back as well as visibly and here he is again, getting wound up back as though six years of growing up has done nothing.

“Well if you're quite done, then -”
there the way Draco looks now.
He actually has to look away from the play of hurt confusion on the idiot's face; he actually feels mean for spitting those words back at him. He hadn't meant to, but they had made him feel so soft and when Potter had kissed him – they had made him feel like being wrapped up in warm starlight. How could he

idly in, so he ignores her and takes the sofa. It's a good lounge, this, reminiscent of the Slytherin common room in many ways, and the black leather sofa's fit for three people at least. Or Draco.
“At midnight?”
“Yes. He saved him. In the room of requirement. There was a fire – he made us go back.”
He curls a hand, the gentlest of fingers around Harry's neck, and pushes up hard to meet his thrusts and it feels like the boldest he has ever been in his life.
“It's not even so much that -” George nods - “A lot of people – especially the Slytherins, have already made it clear they won't be coming back – there's been a lot of -”

punch him, but as soon as he starts forward it galvanises him into action and his hands are balled in Draco's shirt, shoving him back hard into the wall and he's reeling, feeling the beat of his heart pushed up against his chest, the crisp stiff fabric in his hands. He can smell the cool night-air and curiously honey smell of him, and his hands are static with the closeness of
And he had still failed. This is the part that kills him by degrees, has been killing him since he got out of Azkaban. He had been right in so many ways to want to stay there rather than face the Dark Lord again, but in the end it had not been the Dark Lord that was too much to face- it was seeing the change in Draco. It was knowing that he had seen him last before the start of his fifth year – the boy he knew shining with so much of his own hope and arrogance, sparkling with his mother's tenderness and mischief, and then coming back to find him hollow cheeked and wide eyed with fear, crushed by a sense of failure and hopelessness, painfully unable to look anyone in the eye. He had felt enough of the latter himself that he cannot now remember when he last made eye contact with his son.
“I -” Draco blinks. “That wasn't how I expected that to end.”

to be refused now and he knows it, he is almost ready to give up, ready to die, mind spinning out of control with loss -
and he shudders, almost spasms -
Draco shrieks in a voice that goes right up to the stands, and storms off across the pitch to prove the point, sitting down on one of the lower benches and glaring across at where Pansy is now talking to Blaise with a hand on his arm. Blaise looks pissed and part of Draco's glad about this but he's also feeling instantly guilty because he knows he's been unnecessarily mean
His eyes are bright and huge, but it's the whisper in his voice that kills her, the lack of strength in him, how he sounds more surprised and confused than scared or horrified like he might –
“Shut up Potter.” Draco kisses him on the cheek - “Go to sleep.”
Pansy blinks rapidly, scrunching her face up; Draco knows this means she's contemplating crying or running and he puts out an arm to steady her.
“We all need to apologise, Miss Granger – all of my generation to all of yours – don't you -” if she had been anyone else she would have clasped the girl's hand. Instead she extends one hand a fraction and lets it hang - “Don't you miss

“Hmm. Yes, I thought so.”
“I regret -” he begins.

“Um.”
“It's the right word yes. I confess I find it hard to believe that someone like you could ever have felt themselves a failure.”
“Do you know? I don't think that's entirely true. But I would be honoured – to be half of your star.”
“And that's a promise.”
The applause takes a long time to die down, carrying on long after Draco has disappeared – yes, in a flash of lightning from the stage. There's no encore, just the lights of the hall returning to normal and Harry feels so many things all at once he wishes he could lie down – washed clean, washed out, taken to hell and back; or to heaven – he's not sure. It feels like they have all been forgiven by this music in a circle of absolution between Draco and the whole school.
Harry stops about a metre away and so does Draco. He wonders how he never noticed before how much they had to mirror each other. He thinks about what he said yesterday, about how in Draco's circumstances he would have done the same things; and it's true, they are just two boys, painfully alike and hating it, despising their differences and the fact that they are never ever close enough together. They need, Harry thinks, to be occupying the same space, he could crawl inside of Draco and live in his skin, he could hold Draco in turn, inside his own chest and they might just about be tight enough together. This need has been there from the first and they were both too busy hating it to really know it.
Draco echoes, shuddering, ready and unprepared all at once, desperation and innocence fighting inside him – he could

“Me? Why me? Did it ever occur to you, Potter, that not

and every small sitting or drawing room he tries to dive into has at least two people who turn to stare at him and he has to run away from those terrible looks on their faces that imply they are going to try and speak to him, express their shitty delight at his appearance out of his room or ask him how he bloody bastard
That was the rest of it, it slips out of him when he leans in for a kiss, half embarrassed because it is different this time, this time there's moonlight on the bed and a boy who's not a boy any more, who will always be a boy, just like he will, and he's a part of the moonlight and Harry is a part of the candlelight and they mix silver and gold into each other, haloed in a light that does not really exist.
“I am
“Hermione!”
“Oh Harry -” Luna swings her legs round and sits on the side of the bed - “It's terribly, terribly obvious isn't it? It always was even when you were just doing what you did in broom closets in school. It was obvious every time you picked on each other. He loves you Harry, at least as much as you love him and don't say

been, running through him like a fire; but it seems to work for Draco, who makes the choked sound of a stifled whimper and clutches at his arm, his hip, his back, wherever he can reach, a kind of starved frenzy in his eyes -
“Is that a yes?”
“Fuck off, Granger,” Pansy huffs back, a surprisingly Gryffindor glint in her eyes.
“Is he –

He forces a derisive noise up from a pit of memory from which derision used to come naturally.
“But you're
“Greedy -” Harry's hand on his hip, under his shirt, on his chest, another in the small of his back yanking him tight against him, they're both strong, both fierce, arrogance and hunger and years of flying and fighting making them hard and deadly in tension and strength - “bossy -” he yanks Draco against him, like a push but towards him, not away from him - “Bastard,” he finishes, cupping Draco's cock through his trousers and almost making him shriek.
“You first -” Harry hisses, dropping his head again to whisper devastatingly against Draco's neck, squeezing his cock at the same time - “Come for me, Malfoy.”

“Harry yes,” she nods, standing likewise - “You do this. Also talk to yourself and listen – okay?”
she got a new one. So it's fine.”
It's just that the opportunity for derision and scorn gives him something to remember himself by, something to hold on to in the wreckage of himself.
“Just put the bloody thing on and check out the window, Malfoy,” he grumbles - “- and shut up while we're at it.”
Harry sounds furious, exasperated, his voice straining like he is groaning deeply on the inside. Draco is immediately angry that whatever
“Just – please – step away from the edge?” Harry's voice is tense; this is the last place he wants to be, the last place he ever wanted to come to again, the last thing he wants to be doing – alright then, the second to last thing.

as glitter in every imaginable colour rains from the ceiling. The room fills with whispers, squeals, laughter and gasps as it settles on them all and still hangs in drifting rainbows through the dark above their heads for some time. Then there's a second crash and a bright white beam of light illuminates a figure on the stage as though they have just beamed down from outer space. He hears Luna squeal
He whips around, reaches for his wand. It isn't there.
Because this time it's Harry who whimpers in his sleep and Draco who turns to hold on to him. Time and again back and forth this never ending stream of nightmare and comfort. Harry responds well to touch, settling into it like a cat into a stroke. Draco sighs, resting his cheek against the head which turns on the pillow, untameable hair tickling his nose and lips. He hears his own voice
“I get wound up over

“It never came up. Until now.”

“It was just the place -” he says, realising it finally, even after trying to tell himself so many times already - “Last night – it wasn't me, it was just the place.”

“Oh -” she remembers as she stands up, handing Teddy back to Hermione - “Ginny says hello, and have Harry and Draco worked it out yet?”
I mean it really does make sense! I'm sorry Mrs Malfoy I don't think I can tell you what you want to hear.”
It is all so much harder to relate than she had thought it would be, but honestly she is also taking it better than so many would.
“You don't look very surprised,” she says finally, tapping the corner of the letter on her teeth and looking at him closely. He sits down in one of the fat green armchairs.

“Yes. London – initially – you as well, I think?”
that was it,” Flint rolls his eyes as though he knows something Harry doesn't and he catches Ginny's eye for a quick second before she sighs and shakes her head, looking away again quickly to hide an expression just as knowing. He really doesn't know what they're all on about, and it does not make him feel any less irritated.
He takes the poor injured arm in his hand and gently presses his lips to the wrist.
“Yeah I think you've done enough,” Draco snips bitterly, and this time he does start to barge past, because that door that will get away from this arsehole looks very like salvation right now (only it doesn't, does it? He hears a little voice in his chest, familiar to him from his sixth year, a voice that is scrabbling to be let out staying

“Yes. I was born in Kensington but moved to the country very young. After I met my husband we came out to Australia to get away from it all -” she frowns as she speaks, like somebody reciting lines, a look of faint confusion on her face as though she is not quite sure where this history comes from – if she can remember really living it.
“No,” she shakes her head. “Don't. If I know Harry – and we
She finds herself thinking about Lucius as compared to Draco. They both shuffle around the place looking like shells of their former selves, except on the one hand she cannot help but feel a little vindicated, and on the other she finds herself shockingly sympathetic. She wonders if that's how it's hitting Harry – seeing Draco so changed, so unmade from what he was, and while she cannot say she misses the bully who gave her that much grief, she finds herself almost rathering he
“How did you know?”she says suddenly.
“You don't know – you don't
“Why do you do this? Why can't we just disagree without you assuming I don't love you? Or are you just doing this to make me give in - because I won't. That's gross.”

“NO! NO DAD, I'M NOT O- FUCKING KAY! WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP ASKING ME THAT AS THOUGH I POSSIBLY MIGHT BE?”
“So -” she looks at Blaise challengingly, tosses her head like she's forgotten how short her hair is and puts her hands on her hips - “What did I miss?”
Slowly, steadily, with the help of all of these people, George feels himself beginning to do something that feels like smiling, even if he does still feel guilty about it every time. He feels like the one left behind sometimes, the one who is almost rudely refusing to be fixed.
I always wondered how you got in my space so fucking much – follow me around, did you?”
Draco snorts.
“Forget it – it's fine-” he waves a hand at her; it's not fine of course, nothing is fine, but he has come to learn only too well that he has to repeat this stupid little lie of a word a hundred times a day just to keep other people half way happy, and he
“Some of these -” he looks around the gallery in wonder - “Some of these are quite famously presumed missing, you know.”

of his presence but not stepping back to increase the distance between them. In fact he steps forward until they're almost nose to nose, both sets of fists clenched, breathing each other's breath.
“How did you -?” Potter stares at his glasses before putting them back on.
“Well, all those stars up there – they're dead, aren't they? And supposedly we're all made out of dead stars or something. I always thought, maybe you and I -”
“Yeah, sure Malfoy. I go and get a permanent tattoo of something like this just to take the piss. Absolutely, you tosser,” - though he says it affectionately, even (especially) the
“Draco,” Lucius says again, and he feels his weight on the side of the bed, hears the wood shift - “I know you're not asleep. Come out of there.”
“No.” Draco's lip curls in scorn and Harry wants to kiss it, wants to burn in the flash of gunpowder that glints in those silver eyes - “What a stupid, pedestrian phrase. Why would I ever -”
“It's nothing Malfoy, loosen your corset – I was just picturing the look on your father's face if I ever introduced him to my Uncle Vernon.”

“Oh please. Death Eater, remember? The worst?” the words are soaked in bitterness; he half thrusts out his left arm as a reminder, reaches a hand to push back the sleeve but stops suddenly, clenches his fists tight and prays Potter won't notice.
“I'm not – they're up at the castle, sorting luggage; Viktor has about fourteen trunks of clothes, you know- it's fascinating. I heard Pansy was here so I thought I'd – but then I saw you two talking and thought that was nice, so I left it. So I'll see her when she gets back from McGonagall's office.”

“I need to change!”

“If you loved me you wouldn't say that.”
“Hermione will show you. Won't you 'Mione?”
He waits for a day he knows Draco is going to be gone the whole day, visiting his mother for a shopping day in London actually – which Harry finds quite deeply adorable – a
He holds out his hand. Draco stares at it. He has had dreams like this, so many dreams of a second chance. He thinks about the question and a fresh sob heaves up inside his chest because the answer scares him and he cannot even voice it properly just nods his chin ever so slightly.
“What are you doing?” she snaps. He catches his breath.
“I haven't told anyone about that,” he adds - “Mother would probably just cry and I've had just about everyone's tears so many times I'll drown if I get any more. Don't tell anyone?” He starts swearing a great long internal stream of bad words – did he just
Draco obliges with an elbow jab -

“Yes, I -” he falters, not even ready to

but realises that isn't even slightly the case, and he never even thought it, back when he was getting bullied by Draco in school and Dudley in the holidays. He had always been able to hit back against Draco, always felt a strange rush of savage pleasure in trading barbs with him that he only now as an adult really understands. More to the point Draco had never physically hurt him, apart from the one time he had kicked him in the face and even then it really didn't compare to getting the shit beaten out him by Dudley and friends every summer. No, Draco would hate Dudley for the uncouth idiot he was and Dudley would bully Draco as mercilessly as he had Harry. He feels his love for Draco wash over him in a great rippling surge, the feeling of falling all over again that hits him several times a day.
“How does that even -”
what he has to hear right now, and he knows without having to turn that it's accompanied by Draco Malfoy swaggering up the pitch towards him, smirking at his dullness and stupidity. He turns to face him stoically, because – well because he always

“Ye-es -” she looks thoughtful. “But if it's all the same to you, I'll still call you Mrs Malfoy – or – or – Draco's Mum”.

“I just -” he rubs a hand across his eyes - “Needed to be alone to think.”
“The hell did you do?” he says quietly, but not – Draco realises, watching his face – accusingly, just sad; sad for him. It occurs to him that the warm spark in those eyes, the spark that has been following him so much of the time, might be compassion.
“Erm,” he says. Pansy snorts. Draco slaps her. She shoves him back.
“Nope.”

“Love me,” Draco orders, something like confidence creeping back into his voice for the first time in so long and it sounds like this is something he has always wanted to say, hiding the honesty of it all this time beneath a supercilious arrogant attempt to impress - “Want me. Worship me -” he makes a moment of sharp eye contact that asks Harry if this is going too far, and when he finds nothing in Harry's eyes but a willingness, nay, desperation, to do exactly this he smiles, crookedly, and adds - “- but touch me while you do it because

there like this idiot's his life raft and he's so very sick of drowning and he suspcts that at first Potter's hands are on him to do the same thing – push him away – but he doesn't, just pushes Draco into a pile of stacked furniture and presses his mouth down on his like he's been drowning too, like Draco's lips are his only source of air.
“It's like drunk only with drugs,” Blaise sighs, watching him with a minute frown from what seems to have become his armchair.
“It was sort of a figure of speech. Nothing's ever easy.”
since you started in on the family now, there -” he points to a twist of stars, not the biggest or brightest in the sky but Harry feels with a pleasant shiver for a moment that they shine brighter for a moment, pulsing out a special gleam just for him. “That's Draco – the dragon constellation -”
“Us too,” says Bill, Fleur nodding. Molly and Arthur speak next, Hermione and then Ron -
“Well – I'm going to answer you, aren't I? You know – I know we've never met but it's like – it's like we have something in common, a shared interest, like – oh I don't know, it sounds ridiculous – am I happy? I mean – I can't complain –

“Yep. Ancient family tradition.”
Narcissa gives a half second snort of a laughter that is the least ladylike sound Hermione has ever heard her make, and it makes her give a similar laugh.
“Well -” Draco takes a deep breath, appears to lock his face tight shut and says, as though he were giving a guided tour - “This is one of the few rooms in the house I don't remember anything terrible happening in. That's all.”
speak up, Mr Malfoy.”
so many others that he carries, Draco knows now, like a dark mark of his own, no more removable than his. He wakes up, like he so often wakes up himself, eyes streaming, panic and disorientation, looking aorund him wildly, eyes eventually settling on the face close to his, leaning in until they're forhead to forhead.

Then one morning, less than a week before term is due to start he is on the verge of rounding the corner into the kitchen when he hears voices raised sharply and pauses in the corridor.
It is so rare they even use the front door of Number Twelve, and he is in such a panicked hurry that he does not even close it behind him, running straight out into the street and looking left to right wildly. For a minute, his vision is so blurry with his own panic that he does not even see Draco anywhere on the street and then he does, right down the far end and disappearing round the corner at a brisk walk.
to win really, after all?”
see if you can't get it back!”
The brightness slips from the corners of Draco's eyes, but his body arches up to meet Harry's. Harry's already inside him when he replies, his own voice shocked, whispering, like he's swearing and cannot believe the words that dare come from him -

never thought about it?”
“I – thank you – I will be down. I suspect Lucius may not.”

“Dating. Draco Malfoy, obviously.”
“Excuse me –
“And isn't it just your favourite subject? Listen and learn Potter – this was my father's favourite, probably because of the dragon part. I used to look up at it at night from my balcony and wonder if I deserved the honour of being named for those stars. I won't tell you the conclusion I came to. Anyway. Do you know what a binary star is?”
Ginny doesn't laugh. He sighs.
“O- kay,” Draco nods with infinite patience born only of the opportunity it also provides him to patronise Potter - “I mean -”
Harry huddles close to Draco for warmth as they look up at the London sky, suddenly bursting into life with colour and light, fiery flowers streaking and fizzling across the sky. For a long time Draco stands perfectly still, moving only to slip a hand into Harry's, not even sneering or commenting on the relative standards of non magical versus magical fireworks. All around them their friends and the hundreds of strangers in the square seem very close, very connected as they gaze up at the sky in wonder, dreamy with the near magic of the light and sound and smell of smoke and sulphur. When the fireworks glitter green and gold Harry looks sideways to see the lights reflected in Draco's eyes and the play of shadow and sparkle across one pale cheek and he loves and loves and loves him. They do not even see the final burst of finale fireworks except out of the corners of their eyes, so lost they are in kisses in the middle of that busy square.
“What are you doing?”
He wants to be that idiot again, looking at this boy here in the mirror and hating him, no clue of who he is.
Potter. Bloody sodding Potter – that's the thought that would have seen him dead the most quickly. It's also the reason he's alive, the reason he's
“Why are you here?”
He could have done anything. Not every night. Just
“Maybe he can see me already then.” Luna shrugs a little, after all this makes sense, doesn't it? If he's asleep he could be anywhere, with anyone. She rather suspects it's not her though. Not really.
“ - in someone you hate.”
He wonders what time it is. Remembers the positive fucking encampment just outside the window. Thinks about what happened, what happened here, just a few hours – or however long – ago. Thank god, he thinks, he gets to think about that rather than everything else that happened here. It was true what he said before – he never could have slept here again if those memories were the last he had of this place. Now it feels just a little bit like something magical has happened. He also wonders if it should have happened; what it means, if it has to mean anything, he wonders what he feels and
“Shut up, Malfoy.”

home the instant he said it, realised in that moment the assumption he has made – realised, only then, that he had already decided in his mind that they would be together forever now, just like he had once decided with Sirius, just like he had once been convinced that the Burrow would be his home one day. Now the only thing that feels like home is Draco and he rather suspects that to see this one go would be the one loss he could not tolerate.

of it -”
Outside and down through the fields, the waves crash gently upon the shingle; somewhere out over the sea the gulls call sleepily in the dark each to each. The wind whispers lovingly through the old stone walls and the blankets are soft, the bed warm and Harry smiles because there is so much to smile about – there was a time he never imagined there could be. In the warm dark of shadow and the gold of the hallway light he nods off halfway to sleep -
“Shut up please, I am talking! I am seeing you Monsieur Malfoy four years ago, watching this boy and making sure that you hate him really good because if you do not you will love him too much, because you want to be him, because you want to be close - so. You are starting fights and he is fighting back, yes? Because he wants this too, you silly soul. Because even then you are always thinking you are not good enough, because your father says so. You come second to top in class, he says why not first, am I right? I am right. So. You were already easy for Dark Lord to break, but you need to not be broken. You

and shoving themselves together is something they've been trying to do for a very long time, all the time convinced that they were fighting. He's wanted this since he knew what sex was; one day he thinks he might admit that out loud. It's that feeling – like a performance – like when you're flying above the stage, only now he's gone higher, all the way up to the stars, flipping and turning inside out. Of course, it's always a surprise to find yourself flying wihtout any kind of magical aid. Harry's nuzzling his neck as he thrusts into him and Draco remembers that he
Four days not coming out of bed feels like nowhere near enough to catch up to it all. He has his head under the covers when a knock comes on his door. He ignores it, hoping whatever it is will go away. He is still under the covers, like a rabbit in hiding, when he hears the door open and his father's voice saying his name. He does not move, does not reply.
“So what's new?”
This conversation is testing Narcissa's poise almost unbearably, in a way none of the Weasleys and others in this house manage to. How in the world, she wonders, do the others, without anything like her own strength of mental control, resist the effect this young woman has? How are they not in awe of her incredible elegance and self assurance? For goodness sake, she thought,
Are we talking about the same person?”
“Look, should I speak to the Parkinsons?” Harry turns to Draco in his own aside - “Maybe it would -”
“Vous savez que je parle couramment français non?”
She's like clockwork too, he says; nine o'clock on the dot. She throws on some clothes, which seem magically transformed into something exquisite by her touch, and goes down to breakfast. This morning she finds she's not the first up – there are already two girls and a baby at the table.
“These English -” Fleur murmurs from the chaise longue - “Always so obsessed with the sex they are.”
“Weird is relative,” she says as she rises to go and they follow. “Try getting in a car for the first time. Shall we?”
“Are you -”
“So why on earth did you -?”
talk about this? Right now? I have rehearsal.”
“But, um – of course you're welcome here for as long as you need. I don't know if you've seen the papers but those crowds – they're not pretty and they've been camped out at the Manor all this time in wait. It might be best if you – stay for a bit?”
“What's that?
“You know what?” Hermione calls out as Narcissa reaches the door - “You're not that bad!”
“I'm guessing that because you're here, yes. Who sent you? My mother? Granger, maybe? Look I get it, everyone wants to help, everyone wants me and Potter to run off into the sunset and live happily ever after – well like I told Granger yesterday, I'll talk to him later, though frankly it isn't anybody's business and I don't even know where you all get this from, I don't even like him, it's a great big mess, and yes, fine, alright? I want that too? Maybe. Though I doubt he even likes me any more – if he ever did, and dear Merlin's fucking beard we

that he was kissing back – he's not entirely sure how it is he cannot remember this clearly – maybe because it still feels like a dream, god he's imagined it for so long it's felt like a memory for much longer than this after all. Then the strange swirling space his head was in, the strange choice of words that had come out of him before he did it – everything like he was under a spell, like it couldn't possibly be real. The more he thinks about it the more it feels to Harry as though it didn't really happen after all.

“No thanks, Potter you're alright,” Draco sneers, feeling suddenly curiously better than he has done. “I'll come back,” he adds - “I just want – want some things here that are mine, if I

“Whaa?” He had half sat up groggily, blinking and squinting . He had never been the worst at waking up quickly – all those years of Dudley jumping up and down on the stairs, not to mention all the years afraid of imminent attack, or at the very least nightmares, never having quite left him even so many years later.

Cissy too, he suspected, had always acted more out of loyalty to the family than any true dediction to the cause – to the Ministry or to the Dark Lord. She had supported him silently in everything, yes, but shown no passion for anything beyond himself or Draco. When she had fought him on anything it was only where the boy was concerned; and in those instances, she had been fierce enough to scratch him into submission every time. The truth was and is that any time his wife truly insisted on anything at all, he would always give way to her, not because he was scared of her moods – her steely temper and her terrible terrifying silences - but because he wanted more than anything in the world to make her happy; to give her everything. Draco too. He had been raised in a firm belief in the necessity for power – power meant stability – enough wealth and influence and your family could never be harmed. So he had always gone where the power was and morals be damned.
It honours him,defiles him, makes him feel sullied and foul and

“Hermione, do not even -”
The pull down from the ledge is so strong that Draco falls right against Harry as he tumbles back into the astronomy tower and Harry, needing to grab on to Draco anyway, finds himself clutching a shivering bundle of Malfoy against his chest, clutching on to him as though it was

It was shocking, she realised, how much the wizardign world had to learn, not to mention dizzying how marvellous muggle things could be. She is learning new respect faster than she ever imagined possible.

“I dunno -” for some reason his heart misses a beat at the bang and it's not just from the startle of it but a weird slick sense of dread - “Sounded like a door slamming.”
“So -?”
“Nope. Definitely only twice. And I'm not doing it again either.”
“Draco -”
“That's just Luna,” Harry agrees - “I
raco sighs - “Your weasel is speaking to me. Make it stop.”
“Nice drink with Potter?”
“Is that – a thing? Can music be a spell?”
“Don't I? I know you nearly killed my best friend, I know what you did to Katie Bell. I was
“That's true, I mean it takes a certain kind of tone deaf to think dancing to Nick Cave is
he had whispered back in that echoing voice that sounded so very like love he had believed it –
“Oh, it'syou,” he nods, he could not have implied
“- no chairs.”
“Take my hand?” He can feel his fingers shaking, his whole arm shaking. He can see Draco's throat move as he swallows.
When he stops to think about how good it feels it terrifies him. So he doesn't stop to think, just lets the weeks roll by in careless blissful happiness, loving and feeling loved. It's amazing. Brilliant. He had never imagined anything like it – allowing himself to be so wrapped up in somebody else, to take and give such pleasure without having to worry about about the fate of the whole world at the same time. He would never in his wildest dreams have imagined it would be Draco who could open his heart up like this, who could consume him like this. He should have known. He should always have guessed it could only be Draco.
“Star gazing?”
“Go on then,” Draco spits through gritted teeth, lip curling round the words - “Tell me why not.”
“Honestly?”
looking like that too and asking him to fuck him. He's only human, and he's wanted this for so long. He lunges in, shoving Draco back against that ridiculously over sized bed and pushing him back onto it.
“Yeah an illusion, you wanker! A glamour! A trick of the light, not an actual bloody incantation! I can't believe you even -”
And he does sing, with notes like soft faltering steps, a lullaby he remembers like a half forgotten dream, well enough to linger, well enough to see his mother's face bending over him, her sweet solemn voice melodious and imperfect but beautiful as a moth at the manor house window, rocking the ancient family cradle, heavy mahogany on floorboard providing a harmony to her song. It's a lullaby about stars, about, life and death and beauty, about never being alone and though he does not sing it perfectly he feels her with him all the same, hears that better much loved voice and hopes he can pass on some of the peace of it.

“Don't you
which means within the hour. He's had to put extreme undetectable extension charms on their bags just to allow for books. Then Covent Garden was a success and he's building up to Camden market though he's heard there are still a few hidden dark magic shops up Camden market and he's not sure he wants Draco getting ideas. Not that he's
In spite of his mother not giving him the option just to stay in his room, Draco keeps finding trays of food brought up to him when he inevitably does do exactly that. It's not that he's a coward, he tells himself, it's just that he cannot face them – any of them. Alright, it's that he's a coward. There seems to be too little fight left in him to even deny it to himself. Sometimes he picks at what she leaves him; a lot of the time he ignores it and goes back to sleep.
“You told her? What I said? And more, I suspect.”
“Good luck against the lynch mob!” so spitefully that Draco almost jumps out of his skin and so loudly that even Harry hears. He nods to the others by the door and runs down to join the Malfoys -
She punctuates every utterance with cushion punches shared out between the two boys, who blink at each other sleepily and shrug.
And that's everyone, she thinks –
“Honestly, Potter -” he drawls, morning heavy and sleepy-warm - “Your grammar is atrocious.”
“Star gazing!”
“Aww, mate, you stepped in it there!” Ron laughs. The
“You mean will I help you with your project if you help me with mine? Yes, very well.”
“Well -” Draco shrugs - “Sort of. The rest of the family disowned him before I was born, so -” he shrugs again - “They used to do that a lot. Honestly sometimes I'm surprised I'm still in favour. Still; alright, the dog star – heh – must have been some pre-cog abilities my ancestors never knew they had.
“Gods I was so clueless,” Harry sighs - “You made me feel like a complete idiot.”
“We need to
He's not entirely surprised to see Pansy and Luna in a group with Hermione, Ron and Krum but he
He blinks at her, a little stunned.
“Hmmm. I wonder if you could help me then. Help me talk to the boys, either of them, whenever you get a chance. Try and help them to realise what we already know.”
“Seriously -” he sighs, trying not to sound as nervous as he might feel - “You know where his little friends go, Potter's never far behind – I don't -”
“Person – yes – yeah I um, I think so, why?”
Oh shit, he can't stop – once again he cannot stop staring at Draco's lips, like his drug and its antidote are held there, sparkling in the gold dust; he feels so
“I told you all – they saved me – there's no-one else who can help them and Mrs -”

Draco shouts back, his voice very high; sweet Merlin, why, why so many shades of the last time they were up here? The tower was whole then and sturdy, and should not have been a place where so much could fall apart and come loose. It's crumbling now, half of one side torn away as though bitten into, but maybe – if he's really careful - something better could rise from this rubble than what fell apart last time.
He scrubs his hands through his hair, wondering if he really
He resists Draco's attempts to just barge on past, and Draco finds himself essentially running into him like running into a wall. He realises for the first time how close they are in this stupid pointless room, how he can feel the heat coming off of Potter, the tension in his body, his bloody breath against Draco's bloody face and it occurs to him for the first time that he probably doesn't smell too good after the days in his room
“And you did not identify him to Lord Voldemort at that time. Why not?”

“But!”
he goes back to his room, sighing heavily, wondering why it feels like his chest has been cried straight into.
“No I can't say that I do.”
“We do
also he said my pyjamas were – and I quote Harry –
“That one,” he points her to it.
He nods glumly and stares heavily at the turf as they all trail off ahead of him, wondering what the hell they all think he needs to get a grip about and
“Bloody hell!”
“Sir, yes sir!” Draco salutes him.
“Has anyone – even – ever – played it?” he finally manages to stammer out.
On four she hears two bedroom doors open, footsteps in the hall, a pause -
not to mention you still don't want to be seen leaving here, do you? And in summary yes – I will.”
Those eyes look silver when they narrow, and Draco's head darts forward like a serpent striking to catch Harry's mouth in a kiss; it's a mean kiss, an angry one, and so it is returned but Draco makes a little breathy sigh at the end that makes Harry's heart do something painful.
“Potter?”
“Distracted him? What'd you do? Get your dick out and start windmilling?”
“That's the plan.”
It hardly feels real; kissing Draco has always been strictly the stuff of late night wank fantasies and rarely even that since
“It's been a year,” she begins and after they have called Hermione's father down and reversed the spell on him, she sits down with them both and relates as best she can the events of the past year leading up to where they are now and her deciding to do this for Hermione.
It's a shock, landing in the hallway at number 12 and hearing the sudden lack of shouting and mayhem. Draco lets go of Harry's hand like it's fire and retreats behind his mother. Harry looks around to make sure everyone is safe and whilst he is reassuring himself that they are, the familiar screeching starts up -
Draco turns his head for the first time, looking at Harry back over his shoulder. Harry steps towards him and he does not waver; another step, and another.
“But – but – but – are you – taking the fucking piss, Potter?”
“Well I'm going back to sleep. Will you -”
Harry shoves Draco off the sofa and on to the floor, laughing. Draco bounces back up and hits the
“So,” and Harry says -
“Oh,” she says, about to exit the room as soon as he has walked into it - “I do apologise. I was looking for my son.”
“We're good. Shut up you got an arm slap, you want a hug now?”
Draco drags his hand down his face and sits down heavily on his side of the sofa. Harry sits down less heavily on his. He keeps his sleeve rolled up and Draco cannot stop staring.
Hermione writes at the top of the page, bent over a desk in the library. It feels like she lives here these days, always drawn back to the room in spite of the books animosity towards her. She stares back at the page and nibbles on the end of her pen. Being here – taking time to think about being here – what they're all doing in this house together at this time – it seems strange. She's not even sure any of the others
“What's the difference?”

Which sounds ridiculous, given his reason for being in this position, but he's glad, glad of the fear of falling that means he
“Shut up Malfoy,” he sighs, except he doesn't quite, he's tired and broken from discovery and it comes out a pathetic mumbled
He feels more than half tempted to check him for signs of fever.
“Draco especially of course, but they're all struggling. I say keep an eye on them but I suspect that will go both ways. They'll look after you too if you let them.”
“I never thought I'd shake hands with a -” she stops herself - “With someone like -”
He does not blame Draco for anything. He hasn't for years now, even before they were married.
“Er – no? That's just not -”
Draco wrinkles his face up. Harry can feel his shoulders tense.
eyes darting round the room for danger. The second thing – the thing that stops him starting up – is the weight against him, an arm draped heavily across him, legs tangled up with his own. For a moment he loses track of whose limbs are whose, and yes, of where he ends and Harry begins.
Harry laughs.
you're done with me, bloody well don't and see if I care. I'm not stuck here. I can go where I want.”
She's right of course, but then again she always is.

“No.” She sighs - “I don't think I can. The truth is -” she realises it as soon as she starts to say it - “The truth is I've never seen Harry more – more
He clenches his fist, gives the stone banister a light punch, takes a deep breath and blinks hard.
