Harry chuckled. “Oh, yes. Complete surprise. But even that sounds like more fun than my family meals as a child. Let's not talk about them anymore.”
“Nothing special,” Narcissa replied. “I asked the house-elves to make the quickest meal they could so we’re having cooked ham and eggs.”
Twenty minutes later, Harry walked into the pub inside King’s Cross. Hermione had decided that it was easiest to meet there as it was well known. Looking around, he caught sight of Ron and Hermione and made his way towards them. As he got closer, he could see that they weren’t alone and instantly he felt himself tense up a little bit. He wondered why he agreed to this when it made him feel like his stomach was trying to crawl it’s way up to his throat. Before he could turn and walk away, Ron spotted him and waved.
“We could plan it?” Harry suggested, turning his head in his hand to look at Draco. “Sketch it out?”
When he stepped back into the shop, it was just in time to see Draco walk back through the door with two cups of coffee in his hands. “That was quick!”
“No, we haven’t. But maybe now we’ll get back to normal,” he said. “Although I think, perhaps, there’s another conversation we’re still to have, don’t you?”
Harry snorted and gave Charlie a look before turning back to Ron. “Thanks for taking the focus off me.”
Harry turned to face Draco once more, having taken in the view of the Eiffel Tower behind him. “Are you insane?” he asked, though he was smiling. “Paris?”
Molly shook her head. “No, he and Arlo couldn’t make it this week. Something about a very delicate dragon mating going wrong. I dread to think. Ginny is here though, along with her new boyfriend.”
The next couple of months passed quickly for Harry and Draco. Summer came and went and they were busier than ever in the shop. A prolonged period of sun and warmth meant even more weddings than in the early season, and there wasn’t a day gone by that they hadn’t spent time making up centrepieces or buttonholes. They’d even found time to go on several more ‘dates’ to keep Molly at bay, including one for Harry’s birthday – though on the day after his actual birthday to avoid ‘Adam’ being invited to the party at The Burrow.
,” Charlie said with a grin. “I’m sorry I can’t really help you. I mean, I’ve given you my thoughts on the matter. The rest has to be up to you.”
Hermione turned to face him and the look on her face almost made him drop the tray. Stepping quickly up to the table, he set it down and then sat himself down opposite Hermione. “What’s wrong?”
“Imagine what it was like living here all the time,” Ron said. “The house was always full of the smell of something cooking.”
Harry settled himself on the sofa and put his glass down on one of the coasters that sat on the table beside it. He gave a content sigh.
Before long, Harry lost patience with the amount of clothes they still had on and pulled his wand out, using it to get rid of everything they were still wearing.
Draco turned and headed back down the row, poking Harry in the side as he passed, smirking at the barely concealed yelp of surprise Harry gave.
Harry laughed. “I can imagine, but I think that’s a clever idea. Especially if it means you can have a nice table rather than a folding one or something.”
“For yours? Definitely,” Draco replied. “I don’t think there’s such a thing as diamond ribbon, so gold has to be the next best thing.”
Harry laughed as the door swung shut. He stood up and began to clear away the remaining dried flowers, putting them back into their display vases. The centrepieces were all stored in a box with protective charms around them to ensure there was no damage caused and Harry carried the box into the back room to store it safely until the day it would be delivered.
“I suppose. I don’t know,” Harry replied, shaking his head slightly. “I was happy being single, to be honest.”
“Oh, brilliant, thanks,” Harry said, half standing to take the plate and mug from Draco. “Wow, I didn’t expect the sandwich to be so big.”
Harry grinned and grabbed Draco’s hand, leading him up the stairs at a jog. Once they were in the bedroom, he pulled Draco in for another kiss, his hands pushing the soft material of Draco’s jumper up before sliding underneath and making Draco shudder with anticipation.
There are two amazing pieces of artwork in this chapter. The first is by Krysta (StarLeighNight) and the second piece is by Peachbabypie.
Harry grinned and pulled his apron off, hanging it on the hook in the store cupboard. “Thanks. Again. Enjoy your night.”
“Judging by your mood, something bad,” Draco said, a frown of confusion creasing his brow. “The last time you were this upset was… oh. Someone tried to set you up on a blind date?”
“I hope so. I’ll nip down to Madam Malkin’s once we’re sorted with the delivery, if that’s alright?” Harry said.
Harry shook his head. “No, she seemed so excited that I might like this man that I didn’t have the heart to.”
“Oh, that’s right, I’d forgotten your mother was going to work tomorrow,” Harry said, sitting down. “Well, I don’t know about you, but a lie-in sounds good.”
“A solid plan,” Draco nodded. “Here. Bacon sandwich,” he added, throwing a paper bag to Harry who caught it easily.
“They don’t look half bad, do they?” Harry asked once they’d finished. “Aside from the fact we’ve got no vases, I mean.”
Harry snorted. “Always the dramatic one,” he murmured before leaning over to press a kiss to Draco’s cheek. “Come on. Let’s get it over with before the food is served.”
“I’m still annoyed by it,” Pansy said with a sniff. “And I don’t like being reminded of it. I know I’ve changed my way of thinking, but I don’t think that going back there would help at all.”
Draco shook his head. “No, I haven’t even told Pansy. Admittedly that is because she will say ‘I told you so’ if I do tell her, but like you, I quite like having you to myself.”
“Is he a wizard then, this bloke?” George asked, looking up from his plate. “Bit strange if he didn’t go to Hogwarts, that’s all.”
Harry whirled around. “Charlie! I didn’t expect to hear from you so soon! I didn’t even think the bird would get there that quickly.”
“Oh, this is one of my favourites,” Harry said with a soft sigh of happiness. He sank lower under the blanket and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Alright, alright… I give up,” Harry said, folding his arms across chest. “I can’t think what else it could be.”
Harry laughed. “Hey, you and I both know that we wouldn’t work long term. What we had was fun, but you and Arlo are definitely meant to be.”
“I’m not exactly the tallest, am I, so maybe average height, with… do I need to be specific with features?” Harry said, looking up at Draco.
“Oh, yes. Much harder,” Draco replied. “It would make the whole row disappear and that would certainly confuse people. I think most of the people living in these buildings do what I do.”
They worked through each box quickly, making note of any imperfections. Then they moved onto the hanging display. Harry went out into the shop, using magic to unhook the hanging display unit and levitate it down to where they could work on it comfortably.
Draco groaned and tilted his head back to rest on Harry’s shoulder. “I can’t believe that I am so nervous about going to lunch with the bloody Weasleys. What has happened to me?”
“Excellent plan. It might be nice to walk home in the cold night air,” Draco replied. “Now that the snow is gone.”
“Draco, please, this is fine,” Pansy said, sitting forwards in her chair now. “You always did have a bit of a thing for him at school.”
Draco smiled. “I think so too. It’s a bit close to the day to change our plans now, really. I know for a fact if I told Mother that I wasn’t going, she’d be incredibly upset. Knowing her, she’ll have planned a full three course meal.”
The next day passed quickly. As Harry had hoped, they weren’t inundated with too many customers at once, but business was steady going all day. Eventually, they were closing up the shop again and preparing to head for Bookworms and Brews for their date.
“She’ll be thrilled, I’m sure,” Harry replied, rolling his eyes. “I’ll Side-Along you to make sure. I do not want to have to explain to Hermione why you’ve splinched yourself.”
The rest of the meal passed without any more questions about his love life and Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d laughed so much. Before he knew it, it was nine o’clock and he was on his way home. He wished he could have stayed later, like he would have done when he was younger, but things had changed. Ron and Hermione had the kids to get home, just as George and Percy did. As much as he loved Molly and Arthur, it would have been weird for him to stay with them when the others left. So here he was, coming home alone to a dark and empty Grimmauld Place.
He had kicked himself more than once for not breaking the news to Draco in a gentler way, but it had seemed the right thing to do at the time. He wasn’t sure how he’d expected Draco to react, but perhaps it shouldn’t have been a surprise when he’d ended their evening early. It had taken him long enough to trust Harry as it was, and now he found himself worrying that his confession would have put them right back at square one.
“I’ll talk to Robards tomorrow,” Harry said, as his heart rate began to return to normal. “Tell him I made a mistake. There’s no way I can go without that for three months.”
“Well that’s something at least. Does he, er, know that I work here then?” Harry asked, unsure of what he wanted the answer to be.
“Just trying to be organised,” Harry said with another laugh. “We could always go and work some of lunch off…”
“To take your mind off the conversation we were just having,” Draco exclaimed. “Merlin, Potter, you can be so dense sometimes!”
Harry shook his head with a grin of his own. “I’ll go and sort the returns out in the back while you do that,” he said, gesturing to the mopping. “Then we'll be able to leave on time.”
would be the problem,” Draco said. “Although the fact you were so hung up on his age probably didn’t help.”
“You’re my best friend! Best friends are supposed to listen!” Harry exclaimed, but he was laughing as he grabbed his cloak from the stand by the door. “Thanks again, Ron. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“I bet,” Ron nodded. “That wedding you did the flowers for looked mental. How many flowers were there?”
“It’s an amazing invention, that’s why,” Harry replied, glancing over at the potted plants that Draco was talking about. The flowers were always a bright white in the position they were in, but every so often, a customer would come in to buy one and the colour transformation was a sight. “Who wouldn’t want a plant that changes colour depending on the owner’s feelings?”
“Do you really think so?” Harry asked dubiously. “Would you be able to trust someone who’d lied to you for months?”
Harry laughed. “Alright then, that will be four Galleons for the bouquet and three Galleons for the jasmine, so seven Galleons all together, please,” he said as he carefully placed the potted jasmine into a strong paper bag.
Before he knew it, his plate was empty and the TV show was finished. Instead of changing channels, he turned the TV off and stood up. He headed into the kitchen and washed his plate up before putting it back in the cupboard. As he did so, his thoughts strayed to the conversation he’d had with Ron that afternoon and how easily he’d been able to say that he already had a date. He wasn’t sure why, but after those first few dates, the thought of any more sent a chill up his spine. Since he’d split with Ginny, he could count on one hand the number of dates he’d been on before all of these blind dates and, if he was honest, the thought of being out there on the dating scene scared him. He still had to deal with people who were only interested in him because of his name – as had been evident by his date with Conor – even though it was nearly thirty years since the date he first defeated Voldemort as a baby and ten years on from the battle of Hogwarts. It certainly made it harder to trust people upon meeting them.
“Of course we are. Half six at Bookworms,” Draco said, picking up the two bouquets to carry them into the back room. “Unless you had a different time in mind?”
He and Draco spent their days making up orders for what seemed like hundreds of weddings and birthdays, and found that they didn’t have much time to talk in between the orders and customers. The weather was constantly improving and with it, the sun brought people into Diagon Alley which meant an increase in people popping into the shop on a whim.
Harry chuckled. “Makes sense,” he said, beginning to plate his food up. “Are you sure you don’t want anything to eat? There’s plenty of bacon…”
“It’s Monday isn’t it?” Harry said thoughtfully. “Probably some kind of pie, I expect. I’m sure Monday is pie night.”
“Are there any rules?” Harry asked, his brow furrowed slightly. “Flower arranging is subjective, isn’t it? So what looks good to one person might not look good to another, anyway.”
“Oh, really?” Harry said, raising an eyebrow. “Well that’s a surprise. I didn’t think she’d be so okay with it.”
“My friends haven’t been setting me up on dates,” Harry said. “Not since… well, months ago, actually.”
“Yes. Get your sketchpad out,” Draco replied, nodding as he reached for the pencil pot that they kept under the counter. “I’ll go and get the stock catalogue so we can see what’s available.”
“I think the rain is supposed to clear tonight,” Hermione said, a sympathetic look on her face. “I’m sure you’ll be busier tomorrow.”
Harry watched him go, chewing lightly on the inside of his lip. He felt his stomach do a flip as he realised that things were going to be different for a little while. He understood, of course, but it didn’t make it any easier. Sighing, he took another bite of his sandwich, trying to finish it before the delivery arrived.
That afternoon, as he bid Draco goodbye, Harry couldn’t help the feeling that settled in the pit of his stomach. He wanted nothing more than to invite Draco over, but he couldn’t bring himself to actually do it. For all they were friends now and had conversations about all manner of topics, they’d never truly discussed
“Celebrities. They’re the only ones who can afford them,” Harry said with a snort. “But, I’m not really complaining. They pay well, which means we get paid well.”
“He’s running late. Something to do with his mother,” Ginny replied. “He’ll be here soon. So, Malfoy, how did you manage to capture Harry’s heart in the end?”
He sighed happily as he sank lower in the tub, until only his head was above the water. Closing his eyes, he rested his head against the bathtub and tried to clear his mind of all thoughts for a few moments – something he still didn’t find particularly easy, even after Auror training. He concentrated on breathing for the few moments that he had his eyes closed, feeling himself relax. Slowly he began to get washed, lathering shampoo into his hair even though he knew it wouldn’t make it any more manageable. It was the one thing he still hadn’t managed to overcome in all these years. Still, he thought, it wasn’t as if he really needed that ability now.
“It’s the start of wedding season isn’t it,” Draco said. “I don’t know why the last couple of weeks in May are so attractive to people getting married. This sun isn’t a reliable thing.”
“Oh, thanks,” Harry replied, immediately shrugging the jacket off. He’d decided to dress in Muggle clothes rather than wizarding robes, just in case there were Muggles around. He handed it to Draco, who hung it in a cupboard that was by the door. “So do you have neighbours?”
At five o’clock, having gone home first to drop off all his newly acquired presents and take a quick shower, Harry landed on Draco’s doorstep. He glanced around, smiling at the decorations and lights that had been installed along the row of houses. Everything was twinkling merrily and the snow that was starting to fall made it look like something from a film.
“So, are you going to tell me why you lied?” Draco asked quietly. There was no anger in his voice, just curiosity.
tonight,” Harry replied, another frown creasing his forehead. “I want to enjoy this with you. I’ve been looking forward to it all day.”
“I bet. Well, I’d better get going. I’m supposed to be meeting Luna for lunch,” Ginny said. “I just wanted to come and see you on my way.”
Harry smiled. “Alright, each display has a tag to tell you what the plant is called and what they smell like so you can choose one you think she’ll like.”
Finally, they were ready to leave. Harry had grabbed their cloaks from the cupboard and they pulled them on as they made their way to the door. Draco locked the door behind them as they stepped out onto the street and between them they pulled the security gate across to be secured with the padlock.
“Working,” George replied, making a face. “She doesn’t have to work Sundays very often, it just happens that this is one of them. I’ll take her a plate of food home, though.”
Harry did so and the badge changed from reading ‘Support Cedric Diggory’ to read ‘Potter isn’t so bad’ and he laughed again. “I’m not so bad?”
“I’ll probably be going mid-morning, so I’m there to do some present opening and then have lunch,” Harry said. “I usually stay until late evening, but I can leave earlier than that.”
“I do. It’s possibly not as light-hearted as you might expect, but I think it’ll be a good one to read,” Draco replied. “Now, before I sit down, would you like a coffee?”
Draco nodded and walked into the shop, bending down to check under the counter. “Plenty here, the branded and the plain, so we should be all set.”
Pansy snorted but before she could reply, the bell rang to signal that dinner was ready. She narrowed her eyes at Draco. “Saved by the bell, Malfoy.”
“Too many,” Harry said grimly. “I only hope that none of them try and go through with their threats.”
Draco nodded too. “Right, grab a notepad and we’ll make a start on these receipts. I’m sure we can at least get the first month done before closing time.”
to have a conversation about it, because, after all, it was in the past. Frowning, he made his way to the Leaky Cauldron to use the Floo.
“Yeah, I suppose I know what you mean,” Harry replied, dropping onto the sofa and pulling Draco down with him.
“Forgive me, I was focused on something more important than your shrinking table,” Harry said wryly.
“Of course you are, dear,” Molly said, smiling at him kindly. “But wouldn’t it be a help if Hermione could introduce you to new people?”
Then, as the sun began to set, they boarded a private gondola manned by a traditional gondolier. Sitting side by side, they leant against one another as the gondola moved down the canal.
Harry laughed. “I’m sure we’ll get back to it soon. Can you come and have a look at this? I’m not sure it’s quite right.”
“Well, you might like this one,” Draco replied wisely. “The age difference doesn’t have to matter if you like him.”
But now, as September began to wind down and the sun was lower in the sky, Harry found himself thinking of them as a couple more and more and he had to keep reminding himself that it wasn’t the case. He’d begun to realise that he actually found Draco quite attractive after spending so much time with him, and it scared him which was why, on the morning of the eighteenth of September, he was in the post office sending a letter to Charlie Weasley.
“With Malfoy, I assume?” Charlie asked, as Arlo got up to leave the room, placing a hand on his shoulder.
“Oh, I see. Well, I suppose that’s fair enough. Still a bit daft though, given that you didn’t know where it was,” Draco said.
“I know, and I am grateful for that,” Draco replied, nodding. “It’s nice to see our efforts haven’t gone unnoticed.”
“Snape went to try and cut Quirrell off, I think,” Harry said, frowning as he tried to remember. “But he got bitten by Hagrid’s three-headed dog. He knew what Quirrell was up to that whole year.”
“Well, them or anyone else you might want to give them to,” Draco replied with a shrug. “I just thought it might be better than leaving them here under the charm. There won’t be much call for them once Christmas is over.”
“How many more do we have to do?” Draco asked, grabbing his apron from where he’d left it before going for lunch.
“No, exactly. I do, however, fancy a cake today,” Draco said, turning his attention to the glass-fronted counter. “That chocolate cake looks divine, don’t you think?”
“Enjoy your dinner,” Draco replied, waving a hand as he turned to walk in the opposite direction. It always amused him that Harry still disliked Apparating so much that he was willing to walk all the way to the opposite end of the alley to leave via the Floo Network.
“But you’ve been on your own for ages, Harry,” Hermione said, looking at him with a worried expression. “Don’t you think it’s about time you started to think about settling down?”
“I didn’t get an E in my Charms NEWT by being incompetent, you know,” Draco said, shaking his head. “And just because I didn’t take them at the same time as everyone else – apart from you – it doesn’t mean it’s any less valuable.”
“Yes, please,” Harry nodded, watching as Draco headed out of the shop and down the street towards Rosa Lee’s tea shop. Then, sighing, he slumped back over the counter. He was only there for a moment before he sat up again, slipping off his stool and walking around the counter and onto the shop floor. He walked around the displays, inspecting all of the plants and flowers. He nipped off any damaged leaves that he saw, and checked on the water level in each pot.
“I quite like this one too, actually,” Draco replied, sliding his arm around Harry as they got more comfortable. “It reminds me of childhood Christmases before things got weird.”
“Alright, alright. There was Cho… Ginny… then the thing with Charlie and… that’s it, really,” Harry said, writing the names down and looking up at Draco. “None of the others were meaningful enough to be considered my ‘type’.”
“How is it that everyone seemingly knew before we did?” Draco asked, directing his question to no-one in particular.
The week following their ‘date’ passed quickly for Harry and Draco. Easter was over, and they found themselves busier than normal due to a celebrity wedding for which they were providing the flowers.
are. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner. We just didn’t want to say anything until we’d worked things out for ourselves.”
“Well, don’t say I didn’t warn you,” Draco said, following Harry around the shop with his own trug, collecting the flowers for the bouquet he was putting together.
“So it would appear,” Draco murmured, raising his eyebrows as he stood up, ready to follow Pansy into the dining room.
“Alright… I think I can cope with that,” Harry said, nodding. “As long as you promise to protect me from her.”
As the bell chimed once more when the door shut, Draco turned to Harry. “Make sure you revise your backstory for Adam before you go to The Burrow.”
“I would never have thought we’d be this comfortable with each other, never mind each other’s friends,” Harry replied. “Would you?”
“Hello, Mrs Weasley,” Draco said nervously, holding out the bottle of wine. “Thank you for inviting me. I brought you this.”
“Ahh, I see,” Hermione smiled. “Well, I’m sure you’ll make a comeback, Harry. Dinner’s at six, like usual. Now, I’d better get back. I’ve got an important meeting before I finish for the day. See you later.”
“No, but I know who can,” Harry said. “Dean Thomas. You made the bouquet for his mum the other day. I’m sure he’d help us out.”
“Yeah, yeah, we’ll see,” Harry said, giving Draco a look of amusement. “Come on then. Let’s get out of here. I need to be at The Burrow for ten tomorrow to watch the kids do an Easter egg hunt.”
They made their way from the main aisle along to the squashy armchairs. As they sat down, Harry suddenly felt nervous.
“Really. It’s just another thing in the list of things you’re good at,” Ginny said with a grin. “Quite annoying really.”
“Hey,” Ron said, plonking Hugo onto Harry’s lap. “I’m glad you’re here. I’ve been outnumbered because George isn’t here yet.”
Harry nodded. “That was one of the first interactions we had. I know it wasn’t particularly positive, but it was the first time I knew that you would be a constant in my life. I just…didn’t think it would be this way back then.”
Draco chuckled as he sat down beside Harry. “I like to think so. Not that I’ve had the opportunity to do so lately.”
“She used to,” Draco replied as he went into the back room, shrugging off his cloak and hanging it up. “But, I think she’s of the opinion that since we’re the ones running the shop on a daily basis, we should be the ones making the decisions about what we stock.”
“Well, it was easy when they gave us free rein,” Harry said with a shrug. “The only requirement they really had was the colours of the flowers we used.”
“Trying to drown your sorrows in the shower?” Draco asked with a grin, handing one of the cups to Harry. Then he took a Danish from the bag and passed the other to Harry.
Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry saw her smile anyway. She was more than used to Ron by now. They all were.
Harry laughed, piling some chips onto his plate. For all he enjoyed the Sunday roasts at The Burrow, pie night was also one of his favourites. As the pie dish made its way around the table, Harry reached for the tureen of garden peas and spooned some onto his plate, pushing his chips aside to make room.
“We can do it on Monday morning,” Draco replied as he swirled the mop around the small area behind the counter and put it back into the bucket. “It’ll take ages and you have a date. We can come in an hour early on Monday instead.”
Harry chuckled. “You’ll be alright. I only mention it because Zabini was a bit hesitant when he had lunch here for the first time.”
“Yeah, why not?” Draco said thoughtfully. “I’ll give everything a quick sweep with the brush while you’re out and then when the delivery gets here, we’ll be able to get straight on with it all.”
“Healthy living is a good thing, isn’t it?” Draco asked with a frown as he broke a bit of his own Danish off and popped it into his mouth.
Harry snorted again. “No. Far from it. After Charlie, I went out with a few people here and there, but it never turned into anything more. Same old problem that I’ve been having lately, really. I’m an absolute disaster when it comes to relationships.”
“We’ll have a go. Let’s do the poster first,” Draco said, shrugging. He pulled his wand out of his pocket and pointed it at the sign. He and Harry both watched as lines spread across the black board of the sign.
“Not anymore,” Harry said. “In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever actually thought that about you. Well, maybe the posh bit. We all knew your family was wealthy when we were at school.”
Harry returned the smile and they were both silent for a few minutes as they finished their main course.
He stood up again and lit the lamps that lined Harry’s wall before casting another glance down at the floor. His eyes landed upon a small glass vial and he stooped to pick it up. Turning it in his hand, he was glad to see a readable label. “Draught of… Living Death. Merlin’s pants, Potter!”
“Oh, well that’s alright then,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes with a smile. “I am, however, willing to get you a slice of this every so often. If they have it in.”
“Neither did we until we got his owl this morning,” Molly replied with a shake of her head. “I must say it was a bit of a surprise, he normally gives us a bit more notice.”
Harry laughed. “Alright, so do you want me to nip back out and get us coffee before the delivery gets here?”
“What’s wrong with you?” Draco asked, watching as Harry flung the cupboard door open and hung his cloak inside, a little bit more aggressively than was necessary.
Harry smiled. “He must have had faith in your prefects to look after you all. What was he like as a Head of House?”
“Whatever you like,” Harry smiled. “I think we probably pass every kind of takeaway if we decide to walk home, which by the way, I think we should do.”
“No, not really,” Harry said with a shrug. “We just went for coffee. We’re taking it slowly, just getting to know each other really to see if things will work.”
Harry nodded. “She had a fair bit of trouble at the start, by all accounts, but the flowers speak for themselves and people got tired of vandalising the shop.”
“You don’t hide yourself away,” Harry frowned, looking at him. “You’re always up and down Diagon Alley on your lunch break.”
“You can,” Draco said, shuffling around in his seat until he could lean over Harry’s shoulder. “So, we want a green base, I think.”
“They’d be stupid to try if you’re sat there with him,” Ron said with a snort. “You know, once over I’d have been right there with them but having got to know him, he’s actually not as bad now.”
Harry nodded, taking another bite of his spaghetti. He chewed and swallowed before answering. “Yeah. It was used as the headquarters of the Order during the war. We had to abandon it for a while, though.”
Harry nodded, slipping off his stool behind the counter. “It’ll be strange having a couple of weeks off over Christmas.”
Within a few minutes, the stir fry he’d put together was ready and he settled himself at the table in the kitchen to eat. He found himself wondering briefly how Harry’s date was going before crossly banishing the thought. He was sure to hear all about it on Monday, he didn’t need to imagine scenarios right now. Instead, he thought of the book he was going to sit down with once he’d finished his food. He’d been dying to read it all week, but hadn’t been able to find the time so he was going to make the most of it tonight.
“Maybe. Sort of wish I’d gone down that route now,” Harry said with a shrug. “Although I do love this job. It’s satisfying in a completely different way to the Aurors. And it’s great not having to look over my shoulder the whole time I’m at work.”
“Yeah, but the Harpies have a big game tomorrow,” Ron replied through a mouthful of roast chicken. “She doesn’t dare come home the night before because she knows Mum will make her eat a huge plate full.”
“Alright, alright, stop it, you two,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “Can’t we just have a morning where someone isn’t being insulted?”
Draco shook his head. “No, I can’t think of anything. Just having coffee and sitting with you will be good enough, then we can take it back to your place.”
“I know, but it’s her way. You’ll never stop her worrying,” Charlie said with a laugh. “It’s one of the things she does best. That clock should have told you that.”
At six-thirty, Harry was outside of Paperwhite’s, dressed in some of his smartest robes. He hadn’t chosen dress robes, but he wanted to look smart as he knew that Draco would be making an effort, and it was Valentine’s Day, after all.
“Well, what a day that was,” Harry said as he flipped the sign on the door to ‘closed’. “Apparently the twentieth of June is
The barista nodded, scribbling Draco’s order down on a little pad of paper before looking at Harry expectantly.
“Of course you did,” Molly said, shaking her head. “Well, you two go through into the living room. I must go and check on the roast beef.”
“Mum will pretend she doesn’t care for compliments, but she loves them really,” Charlie said with a grin. “We’ve told her many times how good her food is, but it’s always better coming from someone outside of the family.”
Draco shook his head. “Well, at least now you’ll remember to tell them you already have plans when they ask what you’re doing.”
“True enough. Alright then, that’s sorted,” Harry said, feeling relief flood through him. “You know, I’m starting to dread any of my friends coming in here.”
“That doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being choosy.”
Draco nodded. “I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to be finding spaghetti sauce all night once we’ve finished eating.”
“Well, yeah, I just mean I don’t want ten customers coming in at the same time,” Harry said, grinning. “In ones or twos will be fine!”
“Absolutely,” Draco replied, his own breathing still laboured as he recovered from his orgasm. “What about you? Did that remind you of what you’ll be missing if you take that mission?”
Now, they were walking through the door of their house in silence. Harry had refused to speak to Draco once they left the restaurant, and he was thankful that Draco took the decision to Apparate them home, even though he still hated travelling that way.
“Well, yeah, but preaching about it to people isn’t,” Harry replied. “Especially when you barely know those people. Do you know where he suggested we go after we finished the bottle of wine?”
fighting,” Harry replied, rolling his eyes as they continued on their way to the table where Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were waiting for them. “I really think we should have stayed at home to sort this out.”
“It was no trouble. Don’t eat too much chocolate over these next couple of days,” Draco said. “Big delivery to sort on Tuesday.”
“Absolutely,” Draco nodded, leaning over slightly so that he could focus on the pages in front of them.
“Eat your lunch first,” Hermione insisted. “He’s fine where he is at the minute. They were no further forward when I came away.”
“Muggle-born. He’d heard my story as he was growing up,” Harry said bitterly. “Another one in a long line of hangers-on. I don’t know what Hermione was thinking.”
His head swirling with Charlie’s words, Harry headed upstairs to take a much-needed hot bath before having an early night.
“Mmhmm,” Pansy said, a smug smile appearing on her face. “That’s what your mouth says. Your face says different.”
“Oh, yeah… I didn’t think of that. Alright, not David then. Maybe… Adam?” Harry said, wrinkling his nose slightly.
Harry laughed in spite of his mood. “Yeah, I suppose so. Too late now. I’ll be seeing her at lunchtime, so I’ll tell her then that I wasn’t impressed.”
Draco frowned but turned around again, making his way into the parlour where he made himself comfortable in his favourite armchair.
Charlie rolled his eyes. “In small doses, yes. Anyway, I hate to drink my tea and run, but I really should be getting back. Are you okay now?”
Harry turned in the direction of the voice and smiled as he spotted Draco walking towards him. “Hi.”
“He’s in St. Mungo’s. We’re not sure what happened exactly, it was all so quick. As soon as he picked it up, he collapsed. We weren’t able to bring him ‘round,” Hermione continued, her voice shaking slightly. “The Healers started diagnostics straight away, of course, but they said it might be a good idea to get you in as he might respond to your voice quicker.”
“It’s… about time I told you the truth, Molly,” Harry said apologetically. “There is no ‘Adam’. There, er, there never was.”
“Oh, really?” Ginny asked, raising an eyebrow and turning to examine the two arrangements. After a few moments she picked up one of the cards and looked around. “Have you got a quill or something?”
Ron nodded and pulled a handful of coins out of his pocket. He counted out seven Galleons and dropped them into Harry’s outstretched hand. “Thanks, Harry. Enjoy your date and we’ll see you another day.”
“So do I,” Draco said, frowning as he caught the ribbon. “The last thing we need is to run out of ribbon now.”
“Er, maybe a fork,” Harry replied, looking at the food on his plate. He supposed that the coleslaw might be a bit messy to eat with his fingers.
Finally, he set off to meet Ron, Hermione and the mystery man. At least, he assumed it was a man. Hermione hadn’t actually said, he realised. Shrugging, he walked into London. They were meant to be meeting in a Muggle pub this time, and he had to say that he was glad. If things went terribly wrong, he’d be able to slip away easily.
Draco turned to look at him, a curious expression on his face. “What is it? Why do you look so worried?”
“We do all sorts. We’ve provided flowers for quite a few high profile weddings now,” Harry replied with a proud smile. “Narcissa has done a very good job of building the business up.”
“You mean you haven’t read any books featuring posh boys that live in a Manor House?” Harry asked with a grin.
On arrival, Harry pushed Draco onto the bed. Pulling out his wand, he muttered a spell that saw both of them divested of their clothes. Tossing his wand onto the bedside table, Harry climbed on to the bed, straddling Draco and gazing down at him. “You really don’t deserve anything, you know that, don’t you?”
“Thank you,” Draco said with a smile, following her into the house. She wasn’t wrong. The early spring sun that they’d enjoyed over the Easter weekend had slipped away some time during the week to give way to thick, black clouds that were heavy with rain; rain which was now pounding down onto the streets.
“It’s not about what’s acceptable, it’s about maintaining bloodlines,” Draco replied, shifting in his seat so that he was facing Harry better. “My father would have liked nothing more than for me to carry on the family name by marrying a girl from a respectable pure-blood family and siring an heir.”
“Are you seriously asking that? The Boy Who Lived going out for a meal with an ex-Death Eater?” Draco asked incredulously. “Can you honestly not see what they would be curious about?”
“I know that, Harry,” Hermione said calmly. “He couldn’t help it. He didn’t want to pick it up, but he had no choice.”
Much to Harry’s surprise, the rest of the month passed without any more blind dates and he wondered if maybe Hermione had given up. She had been the only one arranging dates for him so far and given that she’d got it so wrong, he wasn’t holding out much hope for anyone else doing better.
Draco smiled and leant over, kissing Harry once more, one hand resting on his cheek as he did so. “Sounds good.”
“You could change that though,” Harry said, looking back at Draco. “You could have a queue around the block, if you really wanted.”
“I hope you don’t call that a tune,” Draco said as he carried the mop and bucket back into the shop. “I’ve heard better coming from that thing Granger calls a cat.”
“Oh, Harry, you shouldn’t have!” Molly exclaimed as he handed her one of the bunches of flowers he’d brought home. “They’re lovely.”
“I’d try Madam Malkin’s first. Or Twilfitt and Tattings,” Draco replied. “It won’t be the same kind of ribbon, but it’ll be nice. Have the family not asked for something specific this time?”
“Who have they sent in your place, then?” Draco asked, deciding that it might be better to try and steer conversation away from their school days.
“N-nothing,” Harry stuttered. The foot that had been very firmly planted against his inner thigh had been removed. “I just saw they’ve taken the chicken pie off the menu,” he finished lamely. He could have sworn that he saw a smirk on Draco’s face.
“It’s a shame we have to get rid of these. There’s still some life in them,” Draco mused as they removed all of the Valentine’s related flowers.
Harry watched him go, shaking his head slightly. He perched on one of the chairs and picked up the menu card that was on the table, studying the list of sandwiches.
Harry snorted. “That doesn’t surprise me somehow. It’s a wonder he’s still able to make any deliveries. Yes, I’d like that. Tell her I’ll be there.”
“Tell me about it,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “Non-stop weddings. I would say I’m glad it’s the weekend, but of course, we’re open tomorrow. Hoping for a quieter day.”
“Come to my place for supper?” Draco asked as he unhooked one side of the hanging display carefully. “We can have a little buffet and unwind.”
“They seem quite smitten with one another,” Draco said with a shrug as he moved behind the counter with his mop. “They’ve been seeing each other for a while, but they still go out on dates.”
“You’ll get no arguments from me on that one,” Harry laughed. “Mind you, I wasn’t known for being the most respectful to Snape either.”
Draco groaned softly into the kiss, his own fingers fumbling with the buttons on Harry’s shirt. He manoeuvred them over to the bed, pushing Harry down onto the soft mattress and crawling atop him, fingers still working on the buttons.
When he got back to Paperwhite’s a few minutes later, he found Draco in the middle of the shop with the sweeping brush in his hands. “Oh. I didn’t think things were that bad. We cleaned last night.”
“No, we’re getting another week off apparently,” Harry said. “I suppose they know how busy we’ve been. I’ve not been over to The Burrow for dinner since the other week because I’ve just been so exhausted by the end of Saturday.”
“Stop being modest, Potter,” Draco said as he entered the shop in time to overhear the conversation. “You bloody well do know your stuff. Start acting like it!”
“Good choice, Potter,” Draco said with a grin as he took a sip of his coffee. “You can go again another time.”
Charlie laughed softly. “Mum, Harry isn’t the eleven-year-old boy that you first met. He’s quite capable of sorting his own love life out.”
“I’m so sorry, Harry. Can I come through? Your note sounded a bit like you need a chat sooner rather than later,” Charlie replied, giving Harry an apologetic look. “I don’t have any appointments back in the UK for months so I thought I’d take a chance.”
“Only the best for the Malfoys,” Draco replied with a snort. “No, I don’t mean that as it sounded. It was a good turkey.”
Harry snorted again. “Of course I will. But it won’t,” he said, pulling Draco towards the door. He paused as they reached it and turned to look at Draco. “It’ll be noisy. Just so you know.”
He continued on his way, passing a few other people on their way to work. It was the same every morning, they smiled and nodded at each other and Harry was grateful for the familiar routine to distract him from what may happen when he walked into Paperwhite’s. Halfway along the alley, he entered the coffeeshop and ordered two coffees and two bacon sandwiches, hoping that Draco hadn’t eaten yet.
“I don’t know, it's a secret, remember!” Harry said with a laugh. “She wouldn’t tell me even if I asked. But she did say both arrangements are gorgeous.”
“It’s fine by me, as long as you keep me busy for a few hours,” Harry said, taking the bag back and lifting out the remaining box.
Charlie grinned and lifted the lid off the Snitch, plunging his hand inside to extract some biscuits before moving to sit at the table opposite Harry.
“They’re spread out all over the place,” Draco said. “In places like this, or the Manor, I suppose. Probably in fancier places than this, too. I didn’t want anything too big when I moved out of the Manor. I wanted something that was easily managed without a house-elf.”
“Ahh. I have to admit that makes more sense,” Draco replied, nodding. “The Valentine’s bouquet he ordered certainly didn’t hint at any trouble.”
“Who said anything about forever? We’re talking about a date,” Draco said as they watched the van reverse up to the door. “It only has to be forever if you want it to be.”
Harry laughed. “Dean would give us what we want. I don’t think he’d go rogue. But we could try magic first if you’d rather?”
“Same here. I just can’t seem to say no when someone tells me they want to arrange a date for me,” Harry sighed. “Hence why I’m here with you, discussing a book about the ways of pure-blood wizards.”
“Hi Tim, I’m Harry,” Harry replied as he rounded the table, his hand outstretched. First impressions were good. Tim was clean-looking and well-dressed, with dusty brown hair and a crooked smile.
“I know, but at least we changed our ways before it was too late. We were only kids, Pansy. Kids who were raised with the most awful prejudices before we were old enough to know better,” Draco replied. “We didn’t stand much of a chance.”
True to her word, Pansy had not let Draco forget their conversation and the rest of September had passed quickly, with frequent attempts to get Draco to admit that he wanted more from his friendship with Harry. October began and the nights grew steadily darker and colder. The footfall past Paperwhite’s thinned as people spent less time on the streets.
Harry laughed quietly. “I can understand why. A book club sounds interesting. Do you have a book in mind?”
Charlie laughed softly. “None of my family, I’m sure. But I’m certain you can get this back on track. Just be honest with him from now on.”
“Of course she does. Do you honestly think you’d still be here if she didn’t think that?” Draco said, raising one eyebrow.
Hermione turned and shook her head at him. “No, we got here a bit early,” she said with a smile. “Come and sit down. This is Tim.”
“Yeah, why not?” Draco shrugged. “It’ll help you get a picture of who you’re meant to be seeing, and then if they ask you questions, you’ll be able to answer them. Otherwise they might just start arranging dates for you even if you say you’re seeing this bloke that you can’t tell them about.”
“A very sensible plan,” Molly said, nodding as she put a forkful of food into her mouth. “Not everyone has the benefit of being at school with their partner.”
Harry drained his coffee cup and dropped it into the bin before heading out into the shop to gather his supplies.
A second later, the door was thrown open and Draco was standing there, a nervous look on his face. “Hi, you’re here.”
Hermione laughed. “I wouldn’t expect anything else. I’ll call you both after I’ve finished my shift.”
“Because he’s a black cat. A lot of people think black cats are bad luck omens,” Alice replied. “Something to do with witchcraft. It’s rubbish, of course.”
“There should be some digestives in the biscuit barrel,” Harry said, nodding in the direction of the Snitch-shaped biscuit barrel that sat on the counter by the kettle. “Help yourself.”
“Alright, thirteen Sickles, please,” the witch said, while gesturing to a falcon that was sitting on a nearby shelf along with a couple of others. They were obviously used for the priority deliveries.
“You too,” Draco replied, clipping the padlock onto the gate and locking it again. “We can compare notes on Monday.”
“Yes, sorry Molly, it went down the wrong way,” Harry said apologetically, recovering from the incident.
“Yeah, I don’t think we’d want to write off the cost of the vase if you miss,” Harry said, sticking his tongue out cheekily.
“Oh, yes. Where do you think I do my experimenting with the plants?” Draco asked, moving past Harry. “Would you like a tour?”
“With the greatest respect, you don’t know the meaning of the word,” Draco snorted. “I can’t remember the last time you just sat quietly reading. You didn’t even sit quietly while we were doing our homework at school. Constant chatter.”
“Harry! When did you get here?” Ron called as he looked up from where he was playing with Hugo. The little boy was giggling madly as Ron pulled faces at him.
“It occurred to me that some of the conventional plant foods need to be administered more often and that people probably forget,” Draco said, picking up a bottle of plant food from the store they kept. “See, this one says it should be used every time you water the plant, or if you use a little bit more, every two weeks. So I thought it might be useful if I could come up with something that could be used less often but still have the same benefits.”
“No, probably not,” Draco replied with a sigh. “We might need to rethink when we do the display if we don’t have anything suitable in with the delivery. I can’t remember what’s coming in today.”
“I’ll probably just tell them he can’t make it,” Harry said, shrugging. “That is unless you want to come for dinner at The Burrow with me one day?”
They worked quickly and before either of them really knew it, they were walking into Bookworms and Brews, where the barista greeted them with a smile. They ordered their coffees and avoided elaborating on why they hadn’t been in for a few weeks by using the busy days at work as an excuse. Within a few moments, they had their coffee and headed down the aisle for an alcove.
“I know we both already have plans, but I would like to see you tomorrow,” Draco said, looking down at Harry from where he was perched on top of the stepladder. “What time will you be going to The Burrow?”
Harry laughed, finally shaken from his stupor by the notion of George asking him out. “No, they’re solid as a rock. He asked if I wanted to go out with him and Angelina
“Okay. I won’t be long. There’s still a couple of small orders that need doing,” Harry continued as he disappeared into the back room. He put the arrangement down on the counter, checking that the little card with the customer’s name was firmly attached. Then, without bothering to put his cloak on, he headed through the shop and out onto the alley where he jogged down to the post office.
He’d been lying in bed, awake, for what seemed like forever before he lost his patience. Giving a groan, he slid out of bed and headed along to the bathroom. He didn’t bother with his glasses. He reached into the cabinet where he knew his sleeping potions were and took out a vial. He popped the cork and tipped the contents into his mouth before stumbling back to his bed. He’d barely managed to pull the duvet back over himself before he was asleep.
Ginny snorted. “He’ll never go hungry. He’s got some kind of sixth sense for when food is about to be served. He’ll be here.”
“I suppose it makes sense to people to buy dried flowers to save money in the long run,” Harry said thoughtfully. “But there will always be people who prefer fresh.”
“I think it probably did, but all of the people convicted with my father were given the harshest punishments,” Draco replied. “So they weren’t treated the same. He won’t really speak of his time in the prison, which I’m actually alright with. I’m not sure I want to hear details.”
“Yeah. I thought it sounded like a good idea too,” Draco nodded. “We should start thinking of designs and getting some samples made up so that we can take pre-orders.”
He and Harry worked quickly and quietly, sweeping the floor and wiping all the counter tops down and before they knew it, they were locking up.
Harry leant over to check the list. “Yeah, that’s right. Dean Thomas from school, remember him? It’s his mum.”
“Alright,” Draco said slowly. “Although it was a selfish thing to do, I do understand why you did it. I really wish you had talked to me though. Because then I’d have been able to tell you how I was feeling too.”
“I’ve brought… someone,” Harry replied, stepping into the room. He tugged on Draco’s hand, pulling him in too. “But it’s not Adam. Well, it sort of is. There’s no Adam.”
“Oh, I see. Well, they’re not bad, I suppose,” Draco replied, ushering Harry through the door and closing it behind him. “They do the job.”
Harry crossed the shop floor and stood in front of Draco. “I know. I know that we haven’t been on the best terms over the last couple of months – and I know that’s my fault – but we need to move past it at some point. These last three days have been insanely busy and I just think we really need to unwind, so why not now? It’s just coffee…”
Ten minutes later, Draco looked up as Harry walked back through the door, the bell jingling above the frame.
“Thank you,” Draco replied gratefully, taking the vial from her. “I appreciate you taking time out of your work to bring it over.”
“They all have wood burners, you know,” Draco replied, sitting down too. “But I do agree about the quietness.”
Harry laughed. “Fair point. I’m sure they will. I mean, how could they not? Those bouquets were exquisite.”
Charlie grinned and shrugged. “I wanted it to be a surprise. Plus, I knew there’d be enough food for an extra mouth.”
On three, they both pulled their hands back and presented the gift they were holding to the other. Simultaneously they took the one offered to them.
“No, I suppose you’re right,” Draco nodded. “Anyway. I think we’re finished here, aren’t we? What time do you need to be at The Burrow for?”
“Yeah, it does help keep the peace at home when he’s happy,” Ron said with a laugh. “So, how did your date go the other night?”
Five minutes later, he was on his way once more with a cardboard cup holder containing the coffees in one hand and a paper bag containing the bacon sandwiches in the other. As he got closer to Paperwhite’s, his stomach began churning again, until he was outside of the door. Taking a deep breath, he turned his back and used it to push the door open.
“No, absolutely not. I promised that I would wine and dine you, and that’s what I’m going to do,” Draco retorted. “Besides, this place is much nicer than the Manor and I’m sure it’s nicer than your place.”
Draco settled into Harry’s side, leaning against him comfortably. “I think that next week, perhaps, we might need to have dinner with Pansy and Theo. Just so you know.”
“No, somehow it doesn’t,” Draco replied, a slight frown appearing. “I don’t know how it doesn’t, I can only assume it was something the original owner sorted out and left in place.”
The rest of October and November passed in a haze of stilted conversations and working on separate projects in the shop. If it wasn’t him on the receiving end, Harry would have been impressed at Draco’s ability to carry on a perfectly civil conversation while simultaneously giving Harry the cold shoulder.
“Sshh. Read,” Harry said, shaking his head at Draco’s quip with a grin on his face. “You’re not tempting me into an argument now.”
“I think so, yes,” Draco replied. “We can have a look tomorrow. We’ll need to pick ribbons and stuff too.”
“I think you might too,” Harry said with another grin, taking a sip from his own cup. “Anyway, do you know which flowers you want to put in the hanging display?”
“With good reason, I’d say,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Anyway, we’d better start the clean up. It’s almost closing time.”
“No. It did not go well,” Harry said through a mouthful of pastry. “Tim, he was called. He was nice enough, they’re always
They worked quickly through all of the fresh stock, checking the quality of each bunch of flowers before depositing them into their display buckets. Before they knew it, all of the stock was out on display and they could make a start on their dried arrangements.
Harry studied the cover and nodded. “This might give me a few ideas for comebacks when I’m talking to Molly,” he muttered. “Have you read it before?”
“You are the worst,” Harry murmured, pressing another kiss to Draco’s neck, sucking lightly. “All I can say is that you’d better be planning on following up on that little display. Right. Now.”
“Maybe take a sleeping potion?” Ron suggested. “Something that’ll let you sleep a bit longer. I know you, you’ll be up at the crack of bloody dawn no matter what time you go to bed. We’re off for the next four days, so if you spend the whole day in bed no-one’s going to mind.”
He hadn’t been back behind the counter for five minutes when the bell above the door chimed. Looking up, he found himself looking at Ginny Weasley. “Ginny. Hi.”
“Ginny, believe it or not,” Harry said, shaking his head as he recalled the quick story he’d come up with the night before. “One of her team-mates apparently has a ‘thing’ for me.”
“Draco, if you don’t get up those stairs right now, you’ll never know,” Harry growled, teeth nipping at Draco’s skin gently. “I have just sat through most of a meal with a hard-on, it would be nice for it to be worth it.”
Alice smiled. “Alright, do you want to follow me through to the meeting room and I’ll have Mr McGregor brought out to meet you?”
“Good,” Harry replied with a grin. “Right, what do you fancy today? I was thinking I might have ham salad this time. “
“Keep your fingers crossed,” Harry said as the barista placed two lattes on a tray at the end of the counter, followed by their sandwiches. “Oh, look, we’d better go and pay.”
“I had to come up with something new. There wasn’t anything that I found suitable while I was researching,” Draco said. “And now I’m trying to fine tune it. I’ll get there in the end.”
“Good. I should hope so,” Draco replied with a grin. “We need to make sure we’re not behind next week. All the Easter flowers will be taking up our time.”
“I can’t blame you for feeling like that,” Harry said. “I reckon I would too if I were you, but at the same time, I don’t think it’s a bad thing to remember. To erase all memories of it wouldn’t be good for anyone.”
“Don’t be daft. Anyway, even if he did, I’m sure he wouldn’t if he found out what I’ve been doing the last few months,” Harry replied sheepishly.
“Well, in the last few weeks, I’ve been on three separate blind dates and they were all horrific,” Harry said. “And you know what the common factor in those dates was?
“No, but you are very good friends with Potter,” Pansy pointed out. “One would assume that they are one and the same.”
Harry smiled and nodded. “I’m sure you will. Alright, have a good night, everyone,” he said with a wave.
“Well, we could do a voting thing. Put a box on the table and label each arrangement and get customers to vote on which one they like best. Then at the end of the week, or month or whatever, we count the votes and pick one person at random from the votes for the most popular arrangement to win a bouquet or arrangement of their choice,” Harry said. “Or we could offer gift vouchers?”
Harry glanced at the clock that was on the wall. “Molly said she’ll be doing dinner for half six, so I’ve got enough time to go home and get myself cleaned up.”
“Yes, but they’re all wizarding folk,” Draco replied. “This whole row of houses are owned by wizards, so there’s no danger of upsetting anyone.”
“I don’t know,” Pansy said, leaning forwards slightly. “He’s been cagey about who he’s seeing for a little while though, so probably longer than any of us realise.”
“It’s no trouble to me. Like I said, I don’t do socialising at the best of times, so the chances of me being busy are small,” Draco replied. “So. Same place as last time okay with you?”
“The sauce should be ready by now,” Draco said, leading him back along the hall to the lounge. “Sit yourself down and I’ll get you a drink. What would you like?”
“Understandable,” Hermione said, biting her lip briefly. “I’ll come back in an hour or so, whether or not I know anything more.”
“Yeah,” Draco murmured, closing the gap between himself and Harry. “And what better way than by doing some international kissing?”
“Look, I don’t mind. I don’t know how many times I need to tell you this,” Draco replied with a sigh. “If anything, I should be thanking you for forcing me to spend time outside of my flat, in the company of another person. And no, I don’t mean forcing in a bad way. It’s been ten years since my probation ended, the shop is going from strength to strength, I need to stop hiding myself away.”
Harry laughed and pushed open the kitchen door. He was greeted by a wall of noise before he could even see anyone. He could hear the chatter of adults punctuated by the giggles of children, and he smiled. He could never be in a bad mood in this house, there was always something going on and somebody to talk to. After he and Ginny had split up, he hadn’t been sure how welcome he’d be at The Burrow, but he needn’t have worried as they’d parted on good terms. They’d both known it wasn’t working and had had enough sense to end things before they got too deep. Molly had been very good about it, although there had definitely been some disappointment on her face the day they’d told her.
“Here’s an idea – talk to Potter!” Pansy retorted. “You’ll have to talk to him about it at some point, so why not now?”
Harry laughed. “Yeah, that wouldn’t be great before a big game. It’s awful, feeling too full when you’re flying.”
Stepping out of the fireplace at Grimmauld Place that evening, Harry heaved a sigh. It had been a long day, and he was exhausted. As he set about making himself something to eat, his thoughts strayed to the ‘dates’ with Draco. It hadn’t been until Draco had brought it up that he’d even realised that his friends had stopped trying to set him up on blind dates. Now that he thought about it, he knew he should be grateful that they’d taken the hint, but faced with the prospect of no more pretend dates with Draco, he wasn’t grateful at all. Spending all day with Draco was good, but it wasn’t the same as spending time together outside of work, where there were no limits to the topics of their conversations.
Making his way slowly to the bed, Draco looked around to see if there was anything suspicious. Shaking his head, he dropped to his knees at Harry’s side and watched him carefully. Upon seeing Harry’s chest rise and fall, he breathed a sigh of relief. “Okay, you’re not dead,” he muttered, looking around again. “What in Merlin’s name have you done though?”
“I thought you could do with rescuing,” Ron said with a shrug. “I know you’ve probably had enough now, but for what it’s worth, anyone will be lucky to have you and if you want me to set you up with anyone, just let me know.”
Draco nodded and backed out of the fireplace, ending the call. He immediately began to pace back and forth across the kitchen tiles. As he paced, his mind wandered and he found himself thinking about how long they’d been together. He’d been in this kitchen more times than he liked to count over the last six years, yet he still had his own flat elsewhere in London. He wondered if, perhaps, now was the time to discuss moving in together. He was sure that this wouldn’t have happened if they’d been living together.
“I told you. It’s a gem of a place,” Draco replied. “I think I must keep them in business on my own.”
“Yes. Let’s start. Don’t let your coffee go cold,” Draco replied, picking his mug up and taking a sip to make the point.
“Thank you,” Draco replied, standing up. “I just thought you might appreciate a quick visit since I haven’t been over for a while.”
“Yeah, you’ll understand when I tell you what’s on my mind,” Harry replied, pulling the grill pan out and checking on the bacon and sausages.
Pansy followed him into the room and settled herself into a corner of the sofa, pulling her feet up beside her.
“Oh, no doubt,” Draco replied, taking a drink from his cup. “I just don’t know the rules for arranging dried flowers.”
“I don’t know, and frankly, I didn’t care to find out,” Pansy sighed. “Being back there would just remind me of how horrid I was at that time. School could have been so much more enjoyable.”
“Well. That’s some realisation,” Draco said, giving Harry an impressed look. “So how long were you with him?”
“Here, let me see,” Draco said, moving to look at the bouquet from all angles. “It looks a bit one-sided. Try spreading the flowers out a bit more and it’ll look better.”
Harry shook his head after a moment. “No. I’ve been wondering how to tell you the same thing. I think if you were anyone else I wouldn’t be feeling like this. But as it is, I’ve never felt like this about anyone else.”
Draco laughed. “Ah, I can’t argue with you there. I like it when she tells me I’m a good worker too, to be fair.”
“Hopefully long enough to actually enjoy the food,” Draco replied. “But I can already see people who are just watching us.”
Harry kicked him under the table. “Oh, well, maybe,” he said, turning back to Tim. “Cheers,” he added, lifting his glass and clinking it against the other three.
Harry shook his head. “Not according to the board. ‘A selection of appropriate flowers and foliage, with decoration in complementary colours’, it says. So I’m guessing they don’t want anything too outlandish.”
Harry chuckled and nodded, heading into the lounge as Molly disappeared back into the kitchen. “Merry Christmas everyone!”
“Lovely,” Harry replied with a smile as he leaned forward to take one of the mugs. He lifted it to his mouth and took a sip. “Oh, that’s nice coffee.”
“I don’t know what to do now,” Harry said, looking at Draco as they sat behind the counter. “I feel like I should be doing something.”
“It sounds it,” Charlie said, looking impressed. “Well, good for her. Glad she’s managed to turn her reputation around.”
“I don’t know, but if you ever work it out, let me know,” Draco sighed, pushing himself away from the door. “I suppose we’d better get everything cleared up. I’m not used to working on a Sunday.”
“Oh. I suppose that makes sense in a way,” Harry said, nodding slightly. “But none of you have really had big families.”
“I didn’t say that,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I was just saying I won’t take my time over it, so we can get along to Bookworms and Brews.”
“Do you want some guards?” Ron asked seriously, putting his quill down. “Because I’m sure we could arrange something.”
“Maybe… I’ll talk to him and find out,” Harry said. “If he does want paying, I’m sure it wouldn’t be much.”
Ron nodded. “Yeah, go on. If you stay, you’ll only distract me with your constant talking about him.”
Draco shook his head as he pushed his chair in. “No, I’ll do them later on. There’s only the two plates we’ve used so they won’t take long.”
“No? Alright,” Harry replied, the corner of his mouth twitching into a smile as he looked past Draco. “Table?”
“Here he is,” Alice said as she deposited the cat into Draco’s lap. “I wouldn’t usually do that with a cat, but he’s quite happy to meet prospective owners like this.”
“Alright,” Harry said as he finished his croissant, picking up his cup of coffee. “Where to next? I know you won’t have just planned to come here.”
“Oh, yeah, it was good,” Harry said, pausing in the jiggling of Hugo. “We just went for coffee again.”
Harry gave him a mock salute and a grin before heading out of the door to the coffeeshop that was next door but one.
have worked between him and Harry, as surely if Harry was willing to lie to continue going on fake dates with him, it was for a reason? Shaking his head, his thoughts turned to work on Monday. He was sure that he wasn’t going to say anything to Narcissa unless he absolutely had to. Harry didn’t want to leave, and Draco didn’t want him to leave, so the only option was to move past the issue and continue working together as they’d done for the last few years. He just wasn’t sure
“Yeah, by the way, when you make someone up to throw people off the scent, don’t say he looks like your actual bloke,” Ron said, rolling his eyes. “Honestly, I thought you’d remember
“Can you believe it’s October already?” Harry asked, watching as Draco pulled the security gate across.
“Me,” Narcissa replied. “I thought I would join you in your quick meal. If that is alright with you?”
They fell silent as they began to read. Occasionally, at particularly thrilling moments, Harry felt an urge to grab Draco’s arm. An urge that he pushed down firmly. He wasn’t sure how well Draco would take to being grabbed out of the blue, even though they were friends. Instead, he shifted his position again, leaning against Draco so that their shoulders were pressed together comfortably.
Draco nodded. “Yes. We probably should have, and I expect if either of us had been in a better frame of mind, we would have thought about it.”
“No. While we’re on, maybe we should do some Halloween-themed ones too?” Harry asked, sliding off his stool.
Ron shook his head. “No, definitely not. Imagine if one of the kids got hold of it… Hermione is at work. Let me get hold of her and get back to you. She should be able to get hold of some from there.”
“I knew it would come in handy, keeping old vases,” Draco said, handing one of the vases to Harry. “Even if they never get properly used.”
“Well, when you put it like that,” Harry laughed, grabbing another sweeping brush and giving the back room a going over. “Thanks.”
Harry gave him an impressed look. “I can honestly say that that thought has never occurred to me, but it does make sense. Have you managed it yet?”
“If the reason was as pure as yours was, then eventually, yes I think I would,” Charlie replied, nodding. “But it will all depend on how you handle it from now on.”
“You sweep and I’ll mop?” Harry suggested, not managing to suppress the smile that was creeping onto his face.
Harry shook his head, grinning. “I don’t know whether to be insulted by that or not. Look, all you need to know is that I like him, we get on well, and we like going for coffee.”
Again, Draco cut him off. “Because it was an important discussion, Father. It needed an immediate conference.”
“Is that all I’m getting? No explanation of the kinds of things you remember?” Harry asked with a laugh, taking another bite of the tart.
“I think so. Or perhaps they’re made earlier and kept under a charm to ensure they stay fresh,” Draco replied, lifting his sandwich off the plate and taking a bite.
Harry’s jaw dropped as he looked around. “Did you two have a bet?” He demanded, looking at Ginny and George.
“Because I didn’t have the proper face to be bad,” Harry replied without missing a beat. “Unlike you.”
Harry blew a raspberry at Hugo as he handed him over to Ron and grinned as the little boy giggled in delight.
“Er, yeah. I brought coffee and bacon sandwiches,” Harry said, holding up his hands. “I thought we might need… sustenance.”
“Of course I want to be happy,” Draco sighed. “But if I went for this, put my heart into it, and it all went wrong then not only would I be miserable, I’d likely lose one of my best friends, not to mention my work colleague.”
“Really? I didn’t know there were such areas of London,” Harry replied, making another impressed face. “How did that happen?”
“Yeah, well, you were wearing too many layers,” Harry replied with a smirk. “This way, we get to have fun much quicker.”
“No reason,” Draco said with a shrug, lowering his head to kiss Harry once more while simultaneously shifting to straddle his lap.
Draco smiled. “I absolutely will. You know, we’ve always been opposites and apparently that saying is true. Opposites do attract. We know how to bring out the best
. He couldn’t do anything while Harry was at work, and it grated on him. Harry insisted that he didn’t mind coming home and having to clean up or make the dinner, but Draco felt useless. He didn’t like feeling useless. He wanted something to occupy him while he was alone in the house and he’d made up his mind to discuss it with Harry when he got home. Glancing at the clock, he sighed again. Only four hours to go.
“No, exactly. But we work well together. Oh, speaking of, you need to vote in our competition,” Harry said, suddenly remembering. “Which arrangement do you think is best? Put it on one of the cards with your name and if you win, you can have a bouquet of your choice. For free.”
Harry couldn’t help laughing at the absurdity of the situation. He was glad to see that George was still capable of causing a scene that was so ridiculous it made all other thoughts disappear. He watched as Molly rescued the baby chicken from the sea of gravy it was sitting in and took it to the sink to give it a very careful bath.
Harry’s eyes widened for a moment before he caught himself and forced a smile onto his face. “I have to admit, I did not expect that name to leave your mouth. How, ah, how did it go from publicity shots to relationship?”
“Trust me,” Ron said, digging the serving spoon into the dish and cutting himself a sizable portion. “Who knows you better than me?”
“Oh, mate, you have no idea. This is his favourite thing at the minute,” Ron said with a chuckle. “It’s easy amusement, but he wants us to do it
Harry grinned and pushed the door open. “Hi,” he said loudly, making sure he was heard over the noise of Hugo’s hysterical giggling.
Not bothering to towel dry himself, Harry padded back down the landing to his bedroom. He knew he would be dry by the time he got there, thanks to his Charmed robe. It had become one of his favourite domestic spells over the last few years, especially in the cold winters they’d had, as it meant he was never too cold after a shower or a bath. He yawned as he pulled his curtains shut, blocking out the streetlights that were visible in the square outside. Then he shrugged off his bathrobe and climbed straight into bed. It was as warm as his robe had been and he snuggled down into the duvet, letting himself drift off to sleep.
“I’ve got a nice bottle in my fridge,” Draco mused. “Do we have time to call at my place to get it?”
Harry stretched slightly, arching his back against the dining chair. “Yes, I think I could squeeze something in. What do you have in mind?”
“I was home by nine,” Harry replied with a grin. “I gave him another chance after the meal, but he didn’t take it so I left.”
“They wanted me to go up to Hogwarts to cover some kind of tournament that’s going on,” Pansy replied, waving a hand. “I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t put myself in that castle for a week or more.”
which stuck itself to the bucket. Realistically, he knew that they weren’t likely to get any buyers if they put a higher price on them.
“Come on, let’s go in there and grab something,” Ron said, nudging Harry’s arm and pointing at the McDonald’s that they were just passing. “You know I like the burgers.”
“Really? Do you not think it would be better to choose something that begins with a different letter?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “How easy would it be to say my name instead of David?”
Harry shook his head and picked up his fork again. “So, you know how… your mum and everyone keeps trying to set me up with people they think I’ll like?”
“Oh, you shouldn’t have!” Molly exclaimed, taking the bottle from Draco. “But thank you. We’ll open it with lunch. Now, come in, both of you. I take it no-one else knows?”
“Because I don’t want to talk to him right now!” Draco replied. “Alright, alright, I apologise for interrupting your evening. I’ll speak to you later.”
Harry shrugged, flushing again. “Didn’t think to, I suppose. I didn’t think it would be as awkward to move as it was.”
“Now we’d better get the rest of the day’s stock out into the buckets,” Draco said, heading into the back room again. “It’s nearly half past seven.”
“Well, I know that, I was here when Granger asked you,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “How did it go? Although judging by your demeanour so far, I’m assuming not well.”
Harry nodded. “Yes, definitely. I think we should start making some examples up, don’t you?” he asked, mentally breathing a sigh of relief that Draco hadn’t questioned him further. After his conversation with Charlie a few weeks ago, Harry had found himself mulling over the relationship he and Draco had with one another now, and he’d realised that he did want to explore the possibility of it becoming more than friends. He just didn’t know how to broach the subject with Draco.
“Then let’s make up some details about your ‘date’,” Draco said, leaning forward. “That way, at least I’ll know who I’m supposed to be, too.”
Draco nodded again, his cheeks flushed pink as they parted. “Coffee sounds good. Let’s get cleaned up here and then we can go.”
“I can’t remember why we put it in there,” Draco said, also frowning. “It seems a perfectly good–” He was cut off by the sign collapsing. “Ah.”
Draco ran out of the kitchen and up the stairs again, heading straight into the bedroom. Harry was still lying motionless where he’d left him. Shaking his head again, Draco dropped back to his knees. He uncorked the vial and gently tipped Harry’s chin up until his mouth opened slightly, then he carefully trickled the antidote in.
“This isn’t funny, Draco. Hermione didn’t tell me who this man is,” Harry said, frowning. “I can’t believe this. I’m going to have to call her when I get home and find out. This is just what I need.”
Stepping out of the Floo at the Leaky Cauldron, he set off down the alley towards Paperwhite’s. It was still dark, and the air was crisp but not too cold yet. The streetlamps cast a soft glow onto the wet cobblestones below and Harry smiled to himself. He was always reminded of the magical feeling of the street at this time of the morning, while it was still quiet. Even though he’d been coming here for nearly twenty years now, it never got old.
Draco laughed. “I’m sorry. Anyway, how have you been? I feel like we haven’t had a proper catch up for ages.”
Draco nodded, gesturing for Harry to go ahead of him through the shop. He checked the delivery door as they passed, making sure it was locked.
Sunday passed quickly for Harry, and it was soon Monday morning. He had jumped out of bed as soon as his alarm had gone off, instead of snoozing it and going back to sleep for another hour. He’d showered and was on his way into London before six am, fully intending to do as Charlie had suggested and call into their usual coffeeshop on his way in and get coffee for Draco. Of course, he would also get one for himself, but Draco’s would be much fancier.
Draco continued along the street before turning down a side street. There was one window that still had a light in it and it was here that Draco stopped. “Alright, here we are. Bookworms and Brews.”
“Ah yes, I forgot about your dodgy bits,” Draco said with a laugh. “Assuming that you mean the bad dates, of course?”
“The falcon that brought your note was a speedy little thing,” Charlie said, his head floating in among the flames. “Is this a bad time? I forgot about the time difference.”
“It’s amazing. It reminds me a little bit of the library at Hogwarts; nice and cosy. It’s what a bookshop should be like, no?” Harry replied.
Harry shot out a hand and grabbed the balled-up paper bag, draining his coffee cup at the same time.
“So how many more of these dates do you think we’re going to go on?” Draco asked. “Not that I mind, you understand, but it would be nice to know if you’ve got anything in mind.”
“Because of our history, of course! We’re now, finally, in a good place with one another. If I tell him that I think I’ve fallen for him, it’ll ruin it all,” Harry exclaimed, as though it were obvious.
The rest of the week was quiet, as far as the pre-orders went and before they knew it, Monday arrived and, yet again, Harry was walking into the shop with a face like thunder. This time though, Draco was prepared. He was in the back room as Harry stomped through the door and, instead of greeting him as he normally would, Draco simply held out a takeaway cup of coffee.
“Oh yeah? How? Because I tried all sorts and Mum wouldn’t leave me alone. I had to move to Romania,” Charlie said, looking impressed.
“Like I said, it’s been quite obvious over the last few months how close you’ve become,” Hermione said. “We would have been more surprised if you
“Alright, sounds good,” Harry said, laughing as he opened the drawer and took out the sketchpad. “Do you have an idea in mind?”
Draco waited until he was settled and then sat at the other end of the sofa. The sofa was bigger than it looked and there was a decent space between them to allow them to adjust their seating position, should they want to.
Harry grinned. “Alright, I’ll go and get these coffees. Be back in a minute,” he said, standing up and heading off down the stack towards the café.
On Monday morning, as Draco was giving the shop floor a quick sweep to get rid of any petals and leaves that had fallen over the weekend, the door swung open forcefully and Harry stomped into the shop. Draco looked up in surprise as the door slammed shut again.
Harry flushed, feeling anger rising in him as the urge to respond to the barb appeared. Before he could speak, he felt a light tap on his shin and when he looked up, Draco was giving him a warning look. Making a face, he clamped his mouth shut.
Thankfully, their regular customers continued to visit and the business continued to go from strength to strength. It was as the weeks passed that the purchases of dried flower arrangements overtook the fresh flowers and both Draco and Harry found themselves wondering how it had happened.
“I think so. I like the variety that we’ve got in there already, but maybe add a note to request things that will stay fresher for longer if they’ve got anything,” Draco said, wrestling with the cellophane as he wrapped it around the vase.
“It’s been worth it though,” Harry said with a shrug and a grin. “Especially for this piece of treacle tart. Seriously, you made a good choice.”
Harry tried to catch Draco’s eye, but Draco was very determinedly looking anywhere else but at Harry. Grimacing, Harry began to eat again, but as soon as his fork was on its way to his mouth, he felt Draco’s toes move again. This time, they traced the outline of his cock through his trousers (which were decidedly more uncomfortable than when they started eating). He swallowed the mouthful of lasagne, along with the groan that wanted to make itself known as his cock twitched.
Draco laughed, leading the way back along the aisle towards the entrance. “Fair deal. Alright, then I’ll see you on Tuesday. Thank you for a pleasant evening.”
Soon enough, their plates were empty, and their mugs were drained. “I didn’t realise how hungry I was,” Harry admitted, stretching his arms above his head for a moment. “I had a big lunch, too.”
“Well, yeah, but I mean, I didn’t think I’d have to make an effort outside of the shop too!” Ron said. “That is, you
Draco groaned slightly. “I love roast beef. Potter, if you’ve made Theo’s meal a disappointment, I swear I will hex your behind so hard on Monday.”
“Ah, good point,” Draco nodded. “Saying he’s our age will at least stop them wondering. Alright, so you met him through work, he’s our age, athletic with blond hair and called Adam. Anything else you think might be relevant?”
“It’s two weeks until Christmas, do you think we’ll be this busy until the actual week?” Harry asked, pushing his hair off his forehead as he concentrated on weaving the dried flowers into his arrangement.
“When you put it like that, I suppose I can. But do you really still hate the Weasleys so much?” Pansy asked, raising her own eyebrow in response.
“Well, let’s hope she becomes a regular customer,” Harry said, nudging Draco slightly. “That would be a big help each month, don’t you think?”
There was a rumble of noise as everyone began to serve themselves. Tureens of vegetables and potatoes were passed around the table, followed by a platter of freshly sliced roast beef. Harry watched surreptitiously as Blaise served himself conservative portions of each food that came his way and couldn’t help the smile that formed on his face. No-one else’s portions were anywhere near as small as Blaise’s.
“Pansy. You know I love you, yes?” Draco asked, watching as Pansy nodded. “Then trust me, you would not enjoy it. It’s too quiet there for you.”
“Of course you’re not. Neither am I. We are perfectly normal adult males,” Draco said. “Who just happened to have spent the evening drinking coffee and reading a book together.”
“Oh yes, now I remember,” Draco said, nodding. “I assumed after you and he had your fun he’d found someone else.”
“What happened?” Pansy said, leaning even closer to the fireplace. “I thought it was all going well?”
“Still, a bit of warning might have been nice,” Draco replied, sinking back into the sofa cushions beside Harry. “Then I might not have worried myself almost to death this morning.”
“Can you remember when our last argument was?” Draco asked, shifting in his chair so that he was more comfortable.
Harry shook his head. “No, six is fine by me. I’ll just grab something quick at home while I’m getting ready.”
“I do. Now that you’ve accepted this date, you might as well go on it,” Draco said with a shrug. “If you get on with him, then great. See him again. If not, try and remember next time to turn the offer down and I’ll sort something better.”
“Sounds good to me,” Harry said, taking the bottle of tonic water and handing it to Tim with a smile, followed by the glass.
“I don’t know anymore,” Harry said once he’d swallowed the mouthful. “Yesterday I was sure this was all going to be fine, but now, I don’t know how much more I can take of these dates.”
The three Malfoys made small talk as they waited for their food to arrive, with Harry contributing occasionally with a nod or a murmured agreement. Once their meals had arrived, conversation stopped as they began to eat.
“Don’t worry, Father. We wouldn’t dream of inconveniencing you that much,” Draco said smoothly. “We were a bit late as we were having a discussion about Harry’s work.”
“Oh. I suppose, yeah,” Harry said, frowning slightly. “I’ve never thought about it before. I usually have a roast at The Burrow.”
Draco leaned over to have a look and nodded. “Sounds good. Let’s see if we can get them done in this last hour before we close up.”
“Oh, don’t mention that,” Draco groaned, picking up his coffee again. “I was a horrible little git at school, you know that.”
“I think we did. But I have to admit, as first dates go, this wasn’t really how I thought this would play out,” Draco said, smiling.
Draco closed the security gate and put the padlock on, locking it with the key. “Hopefully. Easy to break off for any customers that come in.”
“He means because I guessed his ‘something’ and then he didn’t guess mine,” Draco said with a smirk.
Draco shrugged. “I was just in a good mood. I didn’t even do anything that elaborate. It was just a little twirl.”
“Oh, he’s good,” Charlie smiled. “Enjoying life in Romania, for sure. The work isn’t too different, of course, although I think we probably have a few more of the tougher dragons to deal with than his old reserve.”
“Well, I’d say that it’s all your fault,” Draco said one lunchtime as they sat behind the counter. They’d both eaten already and were now waiting for a customer. “You were the one who brought up springtime dried arrangements. Now it seems like that’s all we do.”
“I’ve been out of practice a lot longer than you,” Draco said, shrugging. “Daisies don’t exactly pose much of a challenge, you know?”
“You know I am,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “Let me go and get us coffee and we can talk, okay?”
Draco leaned back and studied the bouquet again before nodding. “Yeah, that’s better. It looks amazing.”
Charlie nodded and disappeared for a moment before the flames roared again and he was stepping out of the fireplace. Brushing himself off, he turned to Harry and held out a hand.
“He hasn’t changed much, then,” Draco said with a snort. “How he manages to eat so much and stay looking like he does, I’ll never know.”
“Here you go,” Draco replied, reaching over to the counter and grabbing one of the plates he’d laid out. “We can load them up and then go and eat at the table.”
“No, me neither. I’ve had too many unhappy endings in the past. You know, reading that story really reminded me of us,” Harry said. “I mean, I know it’s nothing like our situation, but there were definitely similarities.”
“Here we go,” Draco said, walking towards Harry, a small tray in his hands containing two tall latte mugs. “I just got us the same.”
Draco shifted so that Harry’s back was to the wall, pinning him there lightly and kissing him deeply. “You taste of chocolate,” he murmured.
“He does. We keep each other on our toes,” Ginny said with a smile. “I just hope George and Ron understand.”
“Yes, but do you honestly not see yourselves as anything other than friends?” Pansy asked, raising one eyebrow.
Harry’s eyes blinked open and he rolled onto his side before giving a start. “Draco?” His voice was sleepy.
Draco snorted. “I absolutely don’t mind people knowing. But I do understand why you don’t want them finding out so suddenly. Perhaps we should keep this between us for now? Maybe until after Christmas?”
“Alright, alright, do continue. What will you be doing?” Draco said with a laugh of his own as he squirmed away from Harry’s prodding finger.
Groaning, he stood up and moved to the rug that was in front of the fire. He knew it was risky, but he needed to talk to someone and there was only one person who had any idea of the lengths he was going to. He took a pinch of Floo powder from the tin and dropped it into the flames, stating clearly “Charlie Weasley, Romania”.
“Exactly. We can do a poster or a sign to put outside,” Harry said. “We might even get new customers.”
Hermione laughed again and shook her head as she stepped back into the fire, giving him a wave as she disappeared.
“I know, I know, mine too,” Draco said with a sigh. “But it needs to be done. And at least we get paid to do it.”
Harry grinned and put the sweeping brush back where he’d got it from. He joined Draco at the door to help bring the delivery in so that they could start checking it.
“Oh, yes, so we have!” Harry exclaimed, sitting up slightly before groaning again. “Slowly, though.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Come on, we’d better bring this lot in,” Harry replied, and Draco took this as a sign that the conversation was over for now.
Draco left the room quicker than he’d arrived there, immediately heading for the bathroom. He opened the cabinet he knew Harry kept his potions in and pulled out the rack containing the vials. “Why in Merlin’s name would you even have that potion,” he muttered to himself as he began rifling through the vials. “And not have the bloody antidote! For fuck’s sake!”
“Well, we got here in the end,” Harry said with a small smile. “Let’s forget it now and move on, shall we?”
“Stop it,” Draco replied, wrinkling his nose. “I don’t know how this happened. I swore to myself I wouldn’t let this happen.”
“No, they look decent but they definitely need vases,” Draco said, frowning. “Let me see what we’ve got out the back for now,” he added, heading into the back room.
Draco snorted. “Wait until he’s been in the business for a few years. He’ll become as jaded as you.”
They turned their attention to the binder full of receipts, Draco reading out the sales figures and Harry writing them down. They worked like this for the rest of the afternoon, only breaking off to serve customers when they came into the shop. By the time five o’clock came around, they’d managed to work through four months’ worth of receipts.
“I have no idea, really,” Draco replied, slightly taken aback at being addressed so casually. “I… wasn’t really trying to.”
“Much the same,” Draco admitted. “I stayed at home in the flat and caught up on a book I’ve been reading, and did some experimenting with a potion I’ve been working on. Pansy and Theo were going to her parents for lunch.”
“Here we go,” Draco said, presenting Harry with a copy of the book he’d chosen. “What do you think?”
Harry shook his head and turned back to the oven. “Don’t worry about it. Let me just get this started and then I’ll put the kettle on.”
Harry nodded too. “Yeah, good idea. Today, I’ve eaten a big lunch so a sandwich will do me tonight.”
“No, they’re not too bad, just a bit dry,” Draco replied. “Another week probably wouldn’t do them any harm, but they might start looking worse and then we’ll never sell them.”
“Ah. I’m going to Adam’s this afternoon, too,” Harry said quietly, remembering to use the alias for Draco.
“I absolutely agree,” Draco said, nodding. “This is one of my favourite places to come and relax. They’re open twenty-four hours a day, so there are always people here but unless you want to engage in conversation, everyone keeps to themselves.”
“Is that where your ridiculous appetite came from?” Harry asked, remembering Ron’s almost constant need to eat while they were at school.
“I know,” Harry said, sitting back beside Draco, their shoulders pressing together again. “I mean, we’re still a few months away from it being a whole year, but yeah. I can’t believe we’ve been doing this for so long.”
“Yep,” Ron replied with a grin. “He can’t get enough. It takes its toll on us after a while though.”
“I’m so glad you could both make it,” Narcissa said, once everyone was seated. “It’s been far too long since we’ve had dinner together.”
Between them, they used magic to get the display unit back into place. It was always a two man job to put it back as it was so much heavier.
Draco grinned. “My thoughts exactly. I think we’ll like the book I’ve picked. The blurb grabbed me straight away.”
“Hmm, well, I’m not short of offers, put it that way,” Draco said, turning back to his mopping. “I’m picky though. I’m not going to settle for just anyone.”
Harry laughed. “I don’t think I want to know what dessert is, in that case. Tell him I said thanks for letting me steal you for a bit.”
Draco stepped out his front door not even half an hour after he’d arrived home. He felt grateful for the many years of quick showers at Hogwarts as it seemed to be a skill that, once acquired, was not easily forgotten. Buttoning his cloak up as he walked, he headed for Pansy’s place, wondering idly what Theo was making for dinner.
“Well, good. I’d be more than happy to do this again if you need me to,” Draco said. “If only to get me out of the house for a few hours.”
Draco shook his head. “No. If I tell you, it won’t be a surprise will it? It won’t take us long to get there from here, don’t worry.”
“Instead of, you know, talking to me?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “Did you not even consider what would happen if I found out?”
Charlie groaned. “Don’t make me feel worse than I already do! I have eaten but I wouldn’t say no to a cuppa.”
“Exactly. I just… I want a quiet life now. Away from the spotlight,” Harry sighed. “I think we’ve done well to keep my name away from anything to do with the shop, too. Not that it’s a secret that I’m working here, but the flowers definitely speak for themselves. They don’t need me to sell them to people.”
“I know, but it’s a bit different meeting them as your boyfriend to how it is when I’m serving them in the shop,” Draco replied. “That’s my territory. This is theirs.”
“Good. I just wanted to be sure that there was nothing I needed to worry about,” Narcissa said. “You two work well together, against all odds, and it would be such a pain if you did anything to ruin that.”
Draco nodded, moving to the end of the counter where the till was. He pulled his wallet out and quickly added up the price of his own sandwich, cake and coffee. “One Galleon, ten Sickles and 6 Knuts. Not bad for a decent meal, is it?”
Harry laughed. “Well, when you put it like that, people should be afraid of us. But, seeing as we’re florists, I’ll settle for them being jealous.”
Harry nodded. “I do. He’ll keep quiet until we’re ready to tell everyone. Which, to be fair, I thought we were almost ready to do?”
Draco rolled his eyes and smiled. “Come on then. Let’s get it done so we can get out of here. It is Friday after all.”
“I’m not hungry,” Harry replied quickly. “And I’m not just saying that. I won’t be able to eat anything until I know he’s okay.”
“I don’t mind. The sandwiches were lovely, so I’m happy to just eat there if you are,” Draco replied, shrugging.
Harry was halfway through his lasagne when he almost choked on the mouthful he was eating. Draco’s foot was back, making it way up Harry’s thigh.
“Oh don’t say that,” Harry groaned, walking around the counter and into the shop to start collecting the flowers he needed for his bouquet. He picked up one of the wooden trugs they kept beside the counter for this purpose.
“Thanks,” Tim said, accepting the bottle and glass. “I know a lovely juice bar a few streets away. It won’t be too busy.”
“I don’t have any plans either, really,” Harry said, sipping at his coffee. “I might go over to The Burrow at some point, but other than that, nothing is planned.”
Draco watched him go, continuing to gaze in the direction Harry had walked for a few moments after he’d disappeared around the corner. He shook his head slightly as he realised what he was doing. Truth be told, he was really enjoying spending time with Harry. Of course, he knew that there wasn’t much of a difference between what they were doing now and what they did every day at work. The conversations between them, while stilted and awkward at first, had got much easier over the years and he now considered Harry a very good friend – something he’d realised long before offering to give Harry a way out of his terrible blind date situation.
“Well, that wasn’t my reason, but yes that’s a good point,” Draco replied. “I was thinking it could just be easier.”
“Harry! Right on time,” Molly Weasley said as she bustled into the room. “Dinner is just about ready. Ron and Hermione got here not long ago with the kids. We’re just waiting for Charlie.”
“Good,” Draco said, leaning in slightly. “Because it’s happening,” he finished, closing the gap completely and kissing Harry.
Harry concentrated on his food for a few moments until he heard his own name mentioned somewhere along the table. He looked up and saw Mrs Weasley talking with Hermione, Charlie and Arlo.
Draco shrugged. “Probably five or so years ago. It fizzled out quite naturally, though. There was no big falling out or anything.”
“Oh, please. If I wanted to tell you about it, you’d be hearing about a lot more than Theo begging for a Stinging Hex,” Pansy said. “But, duly noted. Have you heard that Blaise is seeing Ginny Weasley?”
“Of course it is,” Draco replied just as a knock sounded at the door. He slid past Harry and went to open the door. “While you’re there, maybe ask her where she orders her ribbons from so we know for the future. I’m not sure our supplier will do the fancier kind.”
“Oh. Alright,” Harry replied, allowing Draco to lead the way now. It was even quieter in this part of the shop, he noted, and the lighting was softer although he could still hear faint music playing somewhere.
Arlo shook it and smiled. “Hello, Mrs Weasley. Charlie’s told me about your delicious cooking, and I’m very much looking forward to sampling it.”
“Alright, don’t rub it in!” Harry exclaimed, looking at him in disbelief. “I thought it would be easier keeping the appearance the same in case I slipped up or something. I’m hardly an expert in it!”
“Here, drink your coffee first,” Harry replied, holding out one of the coffee cups. “I’m sure the orchid will be fine for now.”
“I might do the same,” Draco replied as they began the nightly clean up. “I can’t believe how busy this week has been.”
“It is an old object,” Hermione said softly. “It could be something from the first war, used to… preserve victims until Voldemort could attend to them himself.”
“Hi Molly,” Harry said with a smile as he moved to give her a kiss on the cheek. “I didn’t realise Charlie was coming too.”
“Through work,” Charlie said, smiling at Arlo. “Arlo came to the reserve to drop off a couple of dragons for us, and then never left.”
“Hm, alright. So these sketches can be a bit vague then, in terms of which flowers we include?” Harry asked, turning to watch as Draco returned from the back room with the catalogue in hand.
“I would be if he wasn’t fucking comatose on his bed!” Draco exclaimed. He was trying not to panic, but he had no idea how long Harry had been in that state.
Harry flushed as he opened the cupboard to get their cloaks out. “I was moving one of the big plant pots, you know the ones that have the ornamental trees in?”
“I may have gone slightly overboard,” Draco admitted, looking around. “But I didn’t know what you would feel like eating.”
“Oh,” Harry said, swallowing the mouthful of pie he had in his mouth, and instantly regretting it – the gravy inside the pie was scalding hot. He made a sort of squeaking noise and grabbed his glass of water, taking a big drink before nodding his head. “Yeah, it was… it was good.”
“What? No,” Draco replied, coughing slightly. “No-one would dare arrange a blind date for me. I’m far too fussy.”
“Whatever’s the matter, Harry?” Narcissa asked, her voice full of concern as she looked across at him.
“Well, we’ll see, I suppose,” Draco said with a little sniff. “Anyway, let’s get this cleaning finished or we’ll never get home.”
“Just make sure you remember to come back,” Draco said. “I know how easy it is to lose track of time in here.”
“I know what you mean, don’t worry,” Harry replied. “I’m the same, really. A New Year’s party is usually an exception for me.”
Pansy watched him carefully, her gaze calculating. “You’re liking this. I know you too well, you would never do this for me.”
“I know the feeling. I keep getting owls from Mother inviting me to join them for dinner and I just can’t face it,” Draco sighed. “They’ll only ask me questions.”
“Oh yeah, didn’t think of that,” Harry said with a frown. “There’ll be some in the catalogue though, won’t there?”
He reached the restaurant and ducked inside, pulling his collar down again as he spotted Draco already at a table. He shrugged off his cloak and handed it to the assistant, refusing the offer to seat him.
“I know we didn’t discuss this, but I did get you a little something,” Draco said, his cheeks turning pink. “I hope you don’t mind?”
Harry shrugged and gave Charlie a grin over his shoulder. “Yeah, well, I finally realised that a decent night’s sleep was important. Chamomile tea helps me wind down on an evening.”
“Doesn’t surprise me,” Harry said with a shake of his head. He reached under the counter and pulled out a fresh stack of flower wrap. “So what are you going to do tonight, seeing as you aren’t going to be painting the town red?”
“That reminds me, I must pop in and get one for in here,” Pansy replied as they entered the parlour. “I
Harry sighed and slid off the stool once more, going into the back room to hang his cloak up in the cupboard. Then he moved to check the board that was situated on the wall. They had a couple of orders to make up today; bouquets for a hundredth birthday and a new baby. Making a note of the colours needed, Harry was in the middle of checking the ribbon drawer when he heard the bell above the door chime.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly as he recovered. “We just weren’t expecting anyone else to come through the door this afternoon since it’s raining so hard.”
“It is absolutely the truth,” Draco exclaimed. “Harry’s friends keep arranging blind dates for him that always turn out terribly and he’s getting a bit fed up with it. But he’s also too nice to say no to them. So I told him that next time they asked, he should turn them down and I’d arrange something instead.”
“Oh… it was nothing,” Molly replied, her already flushed cheeks turning even pinker. “Come on now, everybody tuck in.”
Charlie laughed too. “I know, I’m just kidding. I’m glad you still consider me a good enough friend to talk to me like this.”
“Absolutely,” Harry replied, wiggling his eyebrows slightly. “There’s something about you wearing a t-shirt…”
Draco shook his head. “No. It’s one step at a time and this is only the first step. I’m perfectly happy with this situation, so please don’t worry. I was just curious.”
“No, sadly not. I keep killing poor defenceless spider plants,” Draco replied regretfully. “I think I am getting closer though. The last plant definitely took longer to wither.”
“Or we could use magic,” Draco said, the idea just occurring to him. “That way we’d get what we want.”
“No, just yourself,” Draco replied with a smile as they continued to strip the flowers off the display unit. “I’ll do the rest.”
“Why wouldn’t I? It looked lovely, so I got some too,” Harry replied with a shrug as he opened his own box. “I
Turning, Draco rested his back against the door for a moment and breathed a sigh of relief. “I am exhausted,” he announced. “I’m so glad Valentine’s Day is only once a year.”
“I didn’t say it was a bad thing,” Draco replied with a shrug. “It’s nice to have something to do on a daily basis. But it’s definitely your fault.”
“I would have if he hadn’t had a grip like a vice,” Harry muttered. “He plays rugby, apparently, so as you can imagine he was quite a bit bigger than me.”
“Don’t mention it. Enjoy your date too,” Draco said, pulling out his wand and Vanishing the small pile of dust that Harry had swept into the centre of the room. “Go on. I’ll lock up.”
Draco blinked and straightened up from where he was sweeping the debris into a dustpan. “What’s crawled up your arse and died? It’s not even quarter past six yet, they’re not due until half past.”
“Exactly what I was thinking,” Draco replied. “Once we’ve sorted the delivery, we’ll see what we can do.”
“Draco, hello,” Theo said as Draco entered the room. He was already sitting down, but he jumped up to pull Pansy’s chair out for her. “Sorry I didn’t come out when you first got here. I couldn’t leave the gravy, I was just on the point of finishing the roux.”
“No. Of course not,” Harry said, shaking his head and shifting away from Draco. “I completely understand. I’m sorry. Again. I’ll, um, I’ll go and pay for our food and drinks. It’s the least I can do.”
Draco snorted. “We ended up in the library. We were being led to the dungeons at first until one of the prefects questioned it and made the decision to go away from them instead. I don’t think it even occurred to Dumbledore that our common room was in the dungeons, and Snape disappeared.”
“Nothing, obviously,” Ron said quickly. “Merlin knows Charlie was happy the way he was. But I think because we’re such a big family that Mum was worried we’d all miss it if we only had small families.”
“I’ll be back in half an hour,” Harry said firmly, taking his apron off and taking it into the back room to swap it for his cloak.
“Alright. Well, that’s five minutes occupied,” Draco sighed, sitting back again. “What now? There’s only so much cleaning we can do.”
“This is nice,” Harry said, shuffling closer to Draco as he stroked the material with one hand. “Is it homemade?”
“So you, what, made up dates?” Draco asked, sitting up a bit straighter to look at Harry. “And kept making them up?”
“It’s alright. I’m glad the shop is still doing so well,” Pansy said, smiling. “Merlin knows you and your mum deserve it.”
“No, just got here. Alright, come this way,” Draco replied, turning Harry around so that they could walk back the way he’d come.
