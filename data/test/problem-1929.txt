Draco and Harry made their way through the halls, chatting quietly about the changing weather. There was a chill in the air, which Draco loved, but Harry did not. Draco was in the middle of laughing at something Harry said when he was suddenly and forcefully knocked to the ground by a jinx. The jinx left him petrified, and so his nose bled because he couldn’t put his arms out in front of him.
Draco startled awake, his pillow wet. He saw the silhouette of Harry as he took off his shirt. Harry smiled when he saw Draco was awake, then looked concerned. “Are you okay?”
“Yes, and you nearly killed two students at this school while refusing help.” Kingsley did not say this unkindly or with a sneer, but merely as a matter of fact. “Theo should have learned from your mistakes, yes? Besides, he is an adult. He can make his own choices.”
Everyone was silent for a few moments while Draco ran his hands across his face. He was so enormously tired. “So what are you saying? If I don’t break up with Harry, you’re going to...”
“No Mother, of course not. I mean—of course I want to help you in any way I can, but I know that the best way to do that is to stay out of trouble. So I have been.”
“Harry and I were on a mission in Godric’s Hollow.” Draco let out a sigh, feeling extremely relieved.
Finally, Yarney opened a door to a very simple room, and pulled Draco inside. “You are being held under suspicion of conspiracy to obstruct the Auror investigation of former Death Eaters.”
“Oi! Get up!” Draco barely had time to register what was happening before a rough hand took him by the shoulder and pulled him up. “I don’t got all day!”
They both settled on the couch, facing each other. Draco, being the taller of the two, had his knees pulled up, while Harry’s toes lightly touched Draco’s legs. Draco rested an arm behind the couch and so did Harry, their hands linking together. They sat in comfortable silence for a few moments before Harry looked hesitant. “Can I ask you another question?”
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Draco only pointed to a lack of suitors as a guess, but it seemed to hit the nail on the head of Smith’s temper. “You’ll get yours, I’m telling you.” And with that he stalked away.
“Alright,” Harry took a deep breath as though he had done this before. “Producing a Patronus is actually a little similar to Occlumency. You have to
. And it had been the Order of the Phoenix who had fought so hard for the Dark Lord’s defeat, not the Aurors.
“No, I reckon not,” Draco said. He was surprised by how humble Harry was. “You’ve got to be good at something else though, you made it this far.”
“Potter doesn’t like blokes,” Draco scoffed. But then he thought about it some more. “I mean, I don’t think he does. He knows I’m gay but his side of things hasn’t come up.”
Harry smiled at Draco as he helped support his weight out of Hagrid’s hut. The castle seemed incredibly far away given that Draco’s toes tingled with each step. It felt like little needles were poking him every time his feet touched the ground. Harry had also dressed Draco in his own jacket, protecting him from the near-December chill. The rapid approach of the winter solstice reminded Draco of what he and Ginny did agree on.
Also, the next chapter will be posted on Sunday since tomorrow is Thanksgiving! I hope everyone in the States has a good holiday. Love to all!
After a few minutes of Harry gently shaking Draco, he whispered to Draco that he was going to get Madame Pomfrey so that she could get a stretcher. Draco heard him stand up, and then hesitate. He sensed Harry bend down, and then received an extremely gentle kiss on his forehead. He was sure that his whole body was smiling, but apparently he remained unresponsive. Harry sighed and went to retrieve Madame Pomfrey—but Draco had never felt better.
“Wow, that did help. Thank you,” he said, hopping off the bed.
for Merlin’s sake.”
. He found that Christine’s mantras were actually becoming helpful in his everyday life.
“It’s—“ Draco balked, feeling a bit odd talking to a portrait. How much of his mentor was captured in the personality of the painting? “It’s not dishonest, I do feel that it’s unnecessary. I’m fine!”
“And you think it doesn’t get any worse than a band on the wrist? Were you even here last year?” Daphne raised her voice and glared at Blaise.
Draco tried to meet Harry’s eyes but the young man looked away, blushing. “So...would you want to do this again sometime?”
Draco took the beret, muttered a quick thank you, and ran back to grab Harry’s arm. “We have to go. Now.” He dragged a panicked Harry away to an alley.
“What?”
“I—I’m not going to take orders from you Potter.” He meant to say it with malice, but instead sort of mumbled it and turned away to hide his shaking fingers. He moved to start unpacking his trunk.
Mr. Burke looked annoyed. “It’s difficult to have witnesses for a crime that wasn’t committed.” Draco had to admit that was a good line.
There were murmurs going around the court. Some of this was known from Draco’s trials, but some was new information. Certainly some of it was new information for Harry Potter, who looked at Draco under the Invisibility Cloak. Draco felt the familiar sick feeling and started to shake.
“Not a physical one, no. But I imagine you’ve gone through some pretty damaging things in the last year.”
Oof. Do you think Lucius knows about Harry and Draco, or do you think Lucius is just messing with him? We’ll only have one more chapter back at the Manor, and then we’ll go to Hogwarts. Do you think Draco will get around to telling his parents that he’s in a relationship before the Parkinson’s return?
“That’s really nice,” Draco said wistfully.
Draco had a concept that Harry was talking to him, but he couldn’t hear. He felt the attendees shuffle around him as Harry quickly pulled him up, and they made their way unseen toward the exit where many were congregating in the hallway.  Without speaking, Harry kept pulling Draco through different hallways until they were in an empty office. Harry shoved Draco into the armchair of the desk and forced his head between his knees. Draco was only aware of the tiles on the floor and his own ragged breathing as he heard Harry rearrange the furniture in the room to barricade the door.
“Well you could have waited until morning! I’ve come to see you before breakfast every day now.”
Draco cleared his throat and finally found his voice. “I—I wasn’t going to jump,” he stammered.
“When you were discussing what to do, did you ever consider notifying a Ministry official of what had happened?”
“Hello, Draco. How are you?”
“One who probably hates my guts. And who has a little one who will hate my guts, once he finds out what I’ve done.”
“Oh, Mr. Potter!” This woman had the audacity to grab Harry’s arm. Draco wanted to hex her right then and there, but had no means of doing so. He reached his arm out, unsure of what to do with it, but sure that he wanted to protect Harry. “I never did get to thank you for what you did for—“
“W—what? Father, I don’t want you or mum in prison—“ Draco was left stuttering and grasping for the right words. He had never seen his father like this. Was it because of the Dementors, or was this what his father really thought of him?
“I have two questions,” he said, trying to lighten the mood. “First, why are you thinking about dropping out? And second, can you take me with you?”
Draco, still catching his breath, slammed the lid of his trunk down in frustration. Stupid Potter. I don’t need his help.
“I didn’t know that, either. I always assumed you were constantly surrounded by people who worshipped your very presence.”
“Alright. We’ll be out there at around ten.”
He still was unable to move, but he heard Harry growl, “I’ll have you reported for attacking another student. We’re not doing that here anymore.”
“I know, you’re right. I get it, I do. I’m just—I’m really starting to care about you. And it’s scary.”
“I—“ For the second time in his life, Draco legitimately struggled to speak. “I love you too.”
“A true genius. Now I know how you managed to defeat the darkest wizard of all time,” he joked. He loved making Harry smile.
The older kids inspired everyone. Draco sat as students began to share their stories of horror from the past year, some nearly yelling at Draco from anger but others bursting into tears or just staring numbly at the floor. Draco didn’t know what story was the worst or which reaction tugged at his heart more. He knew that the war had traumatized everyone, he really did. But he didn’t know the extent to which his peers—some of them just children—carried it around with them. What had he been doing over the past week? Fawning over Harry Potter, enjoying his life? While these students were down here trying to wrestle control of the universe away from the Ministry? He felt awful. He encouraged the misery that was burning deep inside of him, not knowing if he deserved to be so sad, but knowing for certain that he should never be happy again.
trying,” he said it again to see how it felt. All of a sudden he felt the need to stop, and he took both of Harry’s hands in his. “I want to feel better, Harry. I want to be better. Can you help me?”
Draco was staring at the ceiling, but he could feel Harry’s gaze on him. “I thought you weren’t allowed to go,” Harry said evenly.
“Afternoon, Yarney,” a bored wizard sat at the only desk inside. Draco took a seat in a hard waiting chair across from the desk and gazed around at the room. Massive filing cabinets filled the areas he could see, and there were hallways leading to other rooms as well as a staircase. Though far from the Dementors, the wizard’s Patronus (a leaping squirrel) kept any effects from reaching the building’s occupants. Still shaking, Draco was glad that this office space kept out the cold.
Draco smiled back, feeling a little more reassured. He realized that he knew fairly little about the man sitting next to him. Knowing how he felt when he was around Harry was certainly enough to warrant wanting to go on a date, but if they were to enter a real relationship he was going to have to know more.
Draco wondered what Potter’s source of frustration with the Aurors was—he didn’t seem to like them.
“Thank you for coming to me with this, Mr. Malfoy. I know that couldn’t have been easy.” Part of the reason Draco approached Professor McGonagall is because he knew that she would not mince words with him. As far as he knew, she didn’t care much about his feelings. She would tell him exactly what he needed to do, no matter the consequences. “Now, what would you like my help with?”
“Shhh...” Harry said as he scooped Draco into his arms. Was this the first time that the Boy Who Lived hugged Draco? Harry pressed Draco’s head into the crook of his neck to stifle his sobs. Draco hadn’t even been aware that he was crying, but now that Harry was holding him, he felt safe enough to let out all his emotions. “You’re okay,” Harry whispered to him over and over again. Draco was certainly not okay, but if he could hug Harry like this for hours upon hours, he knew that he would be.
“And she forced an apology out of you? Are you sure she wasn’t the one that attacked you?” Blaise’s eyes narrowed. Gregory kept his head down.
“I’m fine, Mother. I’m safe and well.”
“Nearly ten.”
Draco meets with Mr. Burke to discuss his parents’ trial.
“No, no. Not at all, I promise. I just—he’s one of the students that died and we’re trying to think of a way to honor them all. I just want to know...how we should honor him. If that makes sense.”
“Potter said
“Why would that make him weird? He
Draco laughed, and then swallowed. His rising panic from earlier was starting to slowly make its way back up his throat. “How um...I mean, what are the parameters of this relationship?”
As he put his hand on the door handle, though, he realized he couldn’t leave either. What if there were people waiting to see if Potter came out, and they saw him? What jeers would he have to endure then? He would certainly deserve them, he knew. But he didn’t want to face it. He was a coward. And he was trapped.
“Harry said he was sitting with us today.” Blaise sounded somewhat unhappy next to Draco, and gave him a look that Draco couldn’t decipher.
Draco responded confidently, wanting to take a little bit of Harry’s worries away.
“I wasn’t planning on it,” Draco said. “These are moments when I wish my family still had the influence it once did. I could have stopped all these remarks.”
“Absolutely not. You guys were here through the War, I’m surprised you don’t know better than to make rampant accusations. Keep your nose out of where it doesn’t belong and go to class,” Harry said roughly.
“You sort of always have.” She looked up sharply, confused. “I just thought maybe that would make you laugh. I was scared of you even when we were kids.”
Draco smiled as his mind read the words in Harry’s voice.
Harry sat down next to Draco, who was fiddling distractedly with his wand. “Is it...is it about tomorrow? We don’t have to go if you don’t want to, I understand if you’ve changed your mind.”
“I knew something happened today. Did you get mad at him about something?”
“Why didn’t you go to the Hospital Wing immediately? And why didn’t you report the attack to me as soon as it happened?”
“Are you ready?” Harry asked, holding some sort of a blanket in his hand. It was Halloween night, and finally Draco would be finding out what Harry needed him for so badly.
“When is Bill getting here? I’m hoping he’ll be able to even out a Quidditch team,” Ginny said after swallowing.
“Yer all right. Come in, it’s nasty out ‘ere.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t care if your father knows about us.”
Harry smiled, but sighed again. “If we’re going to do this, I don’t think we have enough room for two reckless blokes in this relationship.”
“He was furious,” Narcissa’s voice trembled. “He threatened our son. He threatened to murder us right there and take the Time Turner himself—though he didn’t know where it was. He said that if he ever succeeded in his plans, he would make sure that our family faced absolute brutality.” Her hand jerked, wanting to wipe away the tears that streamed down her face, but her hands were cuffed to the chair. “His taunts went on for a little while. When we refused to give way, he left, vowing that he would come back for the Time Turner.”
“Do not fret, Mr. Malfoy. All of the eighth years have been required to sign up and get a physical examination. We assume that a lot of injuries flew under the radar last year.” Draco was silent as she continued to poke and prod.
“I don’t care. I can’t control how many Death Eaters are still out there, I can’t control how many people have nerve damage from the Cruciatus curse, but this? This I can control. And so I will.”
“My name is Christine. How are you today Draco—if I may call you Draco, that is.”
Lucius did not seem interested. “Have you grown close with anyone else?” His tone was frosty and his eyes were piercing daggers. He definitely knew about Harry.
Greg shrugged. “Nothing, really. My mum just sent me a letter telling me about Dad’s sentence, warning me to not have any communication with Theodore Nott. What about you, what’s happening with your parents?”
It was surprisingly difficult for Draco to take leave of his mother. She was extraordinarily talkative and nearly filled all the space in the extravagant Manor with her words. Tilly the house elf was still present, but seemed less keen on taking orders than usual. Draco had to throw in a “please” when he asked her to make dinner for the two of them, though he was already a little full of cookies. He interrupted a long gossip session about Pansy Parkinson’s escapades in France to ask a simple question.
“I’m not even supposed to go to Hogsmeade anymore, let alone a date...”
(See the end of the chapter for
Granger looked down. “I’m up a lot at night because of nightmares. What happened at your house included...”
Draco felt like his heart was breaking—this was all supposed to be over already. After a few more minutes of precious conversation, Yarney gave the two of them a one-minute warning.
Draco was careful to make sure his tongue was firmly in place before he spoke. “Wanted to see you,” he managed, though he was feeling quite ill at this point and didn’t want anything to come out of his mouth other than words.
“Don’t push me, Malfoy,” Ginny snarled, coming closer. “Take out your wand.”
Potter met his gaze and serious tone. “Dean put a Stinging Hex on your arm so that you wouldn’t get the Snitch. I don’t even think he meant for you to think...I think he just didn’t want you to win. That’s all.”
“Because you’re a human being! I have never wanted anything bad to happen to you. Well,” he smirked. “Anything
“I’m fine,” Lucius said, embarrassed. He never liked being doted on. Even when he would get sick when Draco was a kid, he shrugged off Narcissa’s attempts at assistance and carried on with his duties. “Even in spite of these poisons they’re making me take.” He gestured to the potions on the side table.
“Where does it say in the law that someone on probation needs an escort to walk through the Ministry?” Granger spoke up. “And it isn’t as if he is alone. Did the Minister order this himself?”
“There are plenty of jobs that don’t require being able to cast a Patronus, Draco.”
Draco walked into class in a much better mood than he had started the day with, but with yet another weight on his shoulders.
Draco grabbed his trunk, this time finding the strength inside of him to lift it off the ground completely. Then he stepped outside into the new world, feeling sure that it would be an even better one were he not in it.
“Oh yes,” Draco said. “Daphne, Blaise, Greg and myself eat dinner together nearly every night.”
“Harry, I—“
“All—all the houses are going to be at one table? For the eighth years?”
The notebook was already glowing when he sat down at his desk, and he opened it to find a good-luck message from Harry about the visit with his father.
Draco really wasn’t in the mood to tolerate stupid ideas. He glanced at the clock, though—it was only a quarter past two. He had many hours to kill before morning, and at least this way he knew he wouldn’t fall asleep. “Fine.” He settled into an armchair across Hermione.
Ironically, his bed only had one person in it tonight. After he and Harry had discussed going on a date on Saturday, they agreed that they had been proceeding all wrong.
“Draco!” Potter stormed into the Hogs Head and rushed over to him. “Are you alright? What are you doing?”
“I’m sorry, I for—“
The weeks right before winter break were some of the best that Draco had at Hogwarts. He was finally feeling a little at peace with himself after his last panic attack. The Time Turner had weighed on him more than he thought as well. Knowing that it was safely out of any Malfoy hands made it easier to sleep at night, though Draco’s dreams still included nightmares of Theo Nott. Draco felt really stupid at burning his letter so many weeks ago—he should have read it. But, as was the theme of his life, he could not change the past.
“I want to know what this business is about honoring our ‘heroes and villains.’ Do they expect us to honor He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?” Dean was glaring at Draco the whole time he spoke.
He ran into the bathroom that he and Harry shared with Neville and Greg. He ran his arm under the warm water, but the blood kept coming. The healing spell for something like this was quite easy, but Draco could threaten his probation if he cast even a simple charm. He wasn’t even sure if the manacle on his wrist would allow him to do so. But the wound wouldn’t stop bleeding until the spell was cast.
Draco obliged, but sat in a chair away from her rather than on the couch next to her. “Mother. My whole life, I have tried to be a good son. Even when that has meant breaking the law. Even when that has meant nearly killing some of my classmates. I love you, and I will always be here for you. But you cannot ask me to deny myself happiness for the rest of my life.”
“Wh—“ Draco was astounded. This was a phenomenal piece of magic, but was also sort of terrifying. “Why did your father need to know where everyone was at all times?” He asked this not unkindly.
“Oh come on, before the weather turns too cold! One weekend won’t hurt. I could even change your appearance, if you’d like to go disguised. Ask him to go with you this Saturday!”
“Harry, I promise you, I’m not trying to trick you or anything. I swear—“
“Before the Dark Lord took up residency in our home,” Narcissa said surely, as though she knew they were going to ask this question. “It always sat in the same place, in a locked box contained in a room guarded with spells, so Draco wouldn’t enter it as a child. This room contained all Malfoy and Black artifacts that we possessed. We only looked for the Time Turner after Nott initially came to our home, and it was gone.”
“Mr. Malfoy, wait. Your Mind Healer appointment is on Monday, yes?” Draco nodded. “Good. Let me know if you need anything before then. I think your lawyer will be in contact with you soon regarding the retrial proceedings.”
Draco looked down at his hands. “I will, Mother. I love you too.”
“You said I wouldn’t even be friends with you, let alone date you.”
When Draco was next aware of his surroundings, he was in the Hospital Wing. He still felt chilled over his whole body, but he was covered in blankets. Faint sunset light streamed through the Hospital Wing windows. Draco sat up gently—he didn’t seem to be injured. He struggled to remember what happened to lead him here.
Harry looked at Draco’s hand curiously, took it, and said “Yes.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco said, and he meant it. In the past few weeks he had been feeling more and more comfortable around Granger. They actually had quite a bit in common—both had a love for reading and both were shrewd, sometimes to a fault. But he knew that he had a lot to make up for. He talked to Christine about apologizing to her and had been spending sessions working on crafting a proper apology. Glancing toward the clock, however, he knew that two thirty in the morning wasn’t necessarily the time to do it.
“Why do I have to leave?” Draco was indignant. “Do you own this forest, Weaslette?”
“I bet it’s going to be a dragon. Doesn’t your mother call you that?” Harry said as they were walking back from a practice session.
“Sounds good,” Draco said, and walked behind Harry to their room. He was smiling, like he had a little secret.
Draco scrunched up his nose. “No. Too weird of a crossover, between you and my mother.” Draco was picturing the look on his mother’s face if she heard Harry call him by his childhood nickname. It wasn’t a pleasant sight, but then again, neither was the look on his mother’s face if she heard Harry call him anything affectionate at all.
He sat down stiffly on the chair, which was enormously uncomfortable. He put his still aching head in his hands and started to think.
“Fine, Potter, I’ll help you.”
“Hello, how can I—oh!” She gave a little cry of surprised, straightened herself up, and then began fiddling with the various papers on her desk. “Hello! Mr. Potter—and Ms. Granger and Mr. Longbottom! It’s great to see you here. And uh...your companions,” she gazed reproachfully at the Slytherins. “What can I do for you?”
“What about lunch?” Daphne was already turned toward the Great Hall.
“Seriously, man, at least just try to enjoy yourself this weekend. Get some sun, eat some junk food and fill up a bit.” Draco scoffed. “And if Potter doesn’t seem interested? Don’t worry about it. If he’s not an idiot, which is certainly questionable, he will be eventually.”
Harry nudged Draco under the table and tilted his head a little toward Ron.
Morning certainly came with a vengeance, though. Still recovering from his one excursion outside this dormitory, Draco now had a full day of classes to worry about. “I’m fine, Potter,” he responded curtly, and moved to get ready for the day. His answer wasn’t one hundred percent accurate—he honestly still felt quite dizzy and anxious about the day ahead. It sunk into him later yesterday evening that he truly had almost died from something as small as that. He had no means of defending himself, and now he had to view everything and everyone as a threat.
He didn’t turn around to watch Ginny’s face. The Ravenclaw finally stepped forward, allowing him to exit the shack, and he knew that he had a deal. He had a week to fix this.
The fifth years looked crushed and melted away, disturbed by the encounter. The one who spoke stole a piercingly evil glance back at Draco as she walked away. Harry turned to Draco. “I’m really sorry about that.”
“No, not without getting yourself killed, or your entire family killed! Don’t kid yourself, Draco, everyone seems to think that we’re a lot more powerful than we actually are. We couldn’t have changed anything, we only could have made it worse—“ Blaise was nearly yelling now and people were starting to stare.
“It’s really not a big deal, Harry. We’ve both dealt with much worse.”
They walked in amicable silence out to the courtyard to meet Potter’s friends. Granger and Longbottom both looked somewhat surprised and a little upset to see Draco alongside Harry, but didn’t say anything.
Draco thought for a second before sitting down next to Harry. “Help me understand,” he started. “I was risking going to Azkaban when we started this plan in the first place.”
“We will address that later,” Madam Hale spoke. “What did you say to his proposition, Mrs. Malfoy?”
Narcissa nodded and Draco’s stomach plummeted.
Were these thoughts real, or a product of the Dementors’ influence? Draco almost felt the need to slap himself, but pinched some skin on his arm instead. The world came back into focus.
The next hour managed to calm Draco down quite a bit. Harry seemed to understand that Draco was finished discussing his parents’ imprisonment for now—goodness knows he would have to do so time and time again in the next few months. Instead they amicably remembered their youth. They went through each year telling stories about the ridiculous things that they used to do to antagonize each other. Draco even managed to eat about half a sandwich. As long as he was stern with himself and made sure to not think about his parents, he was alright. A smile and laugh or two even escaped his lips.
“I think you would know if you had responded to any of my letters, Mr. Malfoy,” Draco had not noticed Professor McGonagall approaching their table. She now addressed everyone. “I suspected some of you may want to end your night early. You will not be receiving your class schedules tomorrow, as we are still working some of that out. However, we will be having a discussion about your freedoms as past of-age students, and the responsibilities that come with those freedoms. Ms. Granger will be serving as the Head Girl of your year, and Mr. Longbottom will be serving as Head Boy. Ms. Granger, could you show everyone to their quarters?” Hermione nodded.
“After the Fiendfyre? Are you serious? Plus, think Potter, whose store would it be in?” Draco couldn’t help but be amused at Harry’s terrible idea for a plan. “Now I know why you had Granger in your posse,” he said, putting the Invisibility Cloak around him and Harry.
“You would have been though? If the contract had gone through?”
When Yarney walked over to take Narcissa back to her cell, Draco nearly attacked him. “Please, just a few more minutes,” he begged. “Please, I’ll do anything,” he was close to sobbing.
“Oh, no. It’s been half an hour. It’s your turn,” Harry got up and gestured for Draco to sit in his place.
“It just...didn’t feel right. I don’t know what it is. I don’t know if it’s my PTSD—“ Draco recalled the Muggle illness that Granger had mentioned. “—or if I’m just tired of conflict or if I just don’t even like her, but every time we would hang out I wish we were just friends.”
“Yeah, of course,” Draco tried to keep his voice even as his hands shook. He opened the last one which was more of the same, and then went to gather the letters.
All of a sudden Harry stirred next to him, and then sat bolt upright in bed, knocking Draco’s teeth together as the top of Harry’s head hit Draco’s jaw. Draco noticed a cold sweat on his boyfriend’s back as Harry’s chest moved up and down rapidly. “You’re alright, you’re safe.” Draco immediately started rubbing Harry’s back, and sat up to be at his level. After a few moments of Draco continuing to coo nothings, Harry calmed down. Draco stood up and got him a glass of water, as Harry had done for him so many times. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“No, Malfoy, drop out of the Quidditch team. What do you think?” Draco flinched again at the use of his last name.
Draco mumbled a thanks and exited back to the front office where he Floo’ed back to school. He landed in Professor McGonagall’s office with a cough.
“Shut up.” Draco got up and began getting out his pajamas.
Draco shook his head, memories of the afternoon flooding back to him. “It’s not what you think. I’m...I’m not going to be called as a witness tomorrow.”
“Yes,” Narcissa said to herself. “Yes, and you need to stay at Hogwarts, do you hear me? No more Hogsmeade trips, at least not for a while. I know that’s probably not how you want to spend your eighth year, all cooped up in your room, but I promise you it will be worth it once all this is over.”
“That’s something I can guarantee you, Potter. I’ll be honest with you.”
“Time’s up,” Yarney said. It felt like much less than last time.
“It wasn’t that bad, Potter and I didn’t really talk. I just had some trouble sleeping. Where’s the coffee?” Draco needed a pick-me up for the horrors that this meeting was bound to bring.
“Draco? Malfoy, are you in here? Malfoy, I’m coming in, okay?” Draco opened his eyes and immediately regretted it. He was just falling asleep—who was waking him up and what did they want?
“Just a little bit farther. Keep focusing on breathing.”
“What? No, of course not.” Draco’s heart leapt into his throat at the thought.
“I just wanted someone to go with me who wouldn’t try and comfort me the whole time. As great as Ron and Hermione are, I knew you would just...let me be.”
“And I’m willing to give it time, Mother. But not here. I need to get some space.”
Hermione stood up. “Sometimes people are just nice to be nice, Malfoy. There are only so many chances you get before people just stop caring. If you want to continue hiding behind this attitude like a coward, that’s your business. Harry convinced me to give you a chance this year, but you’re just the same rude prick, Death Eater or not.” She slammed the door behind her.
Draco and Harry deal with some fallout from their little outing. Draco also gets very ill, leading to another flashback
“I didn’t...” Draco gestured feebly at the desk beside the bed. Potter picked up the note that he wrote.
“Look at you two scums.” A chillingly familiar voice sounded from behind them. “The Boy Who Lived, getting all cute and cozy with a cowardly traitor.”
“How have you two been?” He asked as a courtesy. When his father remained silent and Narcissa responded accordingly, Draco had to know what his father was thinking. “You seem much better, father.”
“I am trying,” Draco realized. “I
“How many?”
Draco thought about the last time he boarded the Hogwarts Express. He had no friends, had barely spoken all summer, and lacked the strength to walk far. Now he had gained a healthy amount of weight and could mostly take the staircases in Hogwarts without much trouble. He still had panic attacks, but he knew how to handle them, and he had friends to help him through it for when he couldn’t. Nightmares still plagued him, but they no longer paralyzed him, and he knew that he could drag himself out of bed in the morning no matter what.
Draco had spent the rest of the day dozing off and on and chatting with Blaise, Daphne, and even Gregory, all three of whom stuck around in his bedroom. Harry was gracious enough to leave the three of them alone until late at night. Shockingly, Draco hadn’t any nightmares—it seems his body was too worn out for his mind to take over.
He could go to the Hospital Wing even though the idea of walking that far unattended nearly made him sick. If he got this nasty cut just in the loo, who knows what would happen to him in open air on Hogwarts grounds. Draco tried to think of any other option, but came up with none. He used his towel to wipe up the mess in the bathroom as best he could and used a second one to wrap around his arm—he would have Blaise clean them later.
Did Lucius really know something else, some valuable information that could lead to the capture of more Death Eaters? That thought filled Draco with rage. How dare Draco’s father endanger his whole family, after everything Lucius put his wife through. Draco would go to Azkaban if it meant his mother could live in peace for the rest of her life...
“I...I’m just thinking about my poor mum in there, you know? She’s been through so much. Now I don’t even know when I’ll get to talk to her again.” Draco’s eyes burned.
Harry shook his head at Hermione, who had stopped at Draco’s call. “Do you really think I’m going to let you go alone? Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry chastised, but not roughly. Draco knew that he was just being protective. “If you get caught, having me there will be a huge benefit. Even if you don’t, I want to be there for you. I know this won’t be easy.” Draco didn’t have a chance to respond before Harry was taking him into a quiet hallway.
“That...that people may be after you.”
“Um...” Draco laughed. “Because it’s awful?”
“Yes.”
Harry looked at Draco, who bit his lip but nodded. He didn’t want to draw attention to himself by saying he didn’t want to go. Hopefully either Madame Rosmerta wasn’t working right now, or she wouldn’t recognize him. After all, she had been under the influence nearly every time she saw him.
“Take boat 4, and bring the cloaks back when you’re finished.”
“That is beside the point, Mr. Malfoy. If your grades don’t suffer, something else will. You don’t look well as it is. And so, what date would work best for you?”
“I noticed that you have continued your sessions with the Mind Healer. I’m very happy about that. I know it can’t be easy.”
“Turn in the package,” Dean finished. “Tell the truth. Say that we were worried so we were looking through your mail, and we found the missing Time Turner in a package addressed to you. But, if you do stay away from him and just keep to yourself for the rest of the year, we’ll destroy it for you. No one will ever know that you have it.”
“It’s good that you’re awake, but you need to sleep, alright?” Harry said. “You’re going to be fine, you just need to sleep.”
“With that being said,”Granger continued. “We wanted to take today to publicize chances for healing. There’s going to be a group for eighth years that meets every Monday at seven. There’s one for each year, and it’s just an informal thing so that everyone can feel as though they aren’t alone. All of you are welcome.”
“That’s correct.”
Draco gave a weak laugh. “There’s no way I would willingly spend time with you in a world ruled by just chance encounters, Potter.”
Draco had to control himself not to run outside. He made sure he went a few paces closer into the Forbidden Forest, not wanting to run into any of the others heading back to the school. Taking large gulps of the cold air wasn’t helping. Every breath he took seemed not to enter his lungs but his stomach, and he put a hand on it to try and steady himself. He stumbled against the nearest tree and sunk down into the grass, which was wet with forming dew. His teeth clenched together and he tried his best to keep his tongue from getting hurt—but even the mere thought of his tongue caused him to vomit on the ground.
Crawling on three limbs, his injured arm pressed to his chest, in an attempt to avoid falling again, Draco made it to his room. With a very unsteady left hand he scribbled out what he hoped was a legible death-not-suicide note, and he drew the curtains around his bed. He rested his head on his pillow and let go of his right arm, feeling both mortified and incredibly relieved.
After a few moments of silence, Blaise spoke up, a look of anger on his face. “If he is a prat to you, you let me know and I’ll kill him.”
“Um...” Draco said, giving Harry pause. “Actually. Um. I know that you want to take things slow and that is totally fine with me. Better than fine actually, I don’t care in the slightest. Wait! No, I care, I just—“ Draco’s face was screwed up in confusion, and Harry looked amused. Sometimes it was difficult for him to find the line between being nonchalant about something and just blatantly rude. “I was wondering if maybe you would be willing to sleep in my bed tonight?”
“I’m fine.” Draco was touched by Harry’s concern.
Harry put a reassuring hand on Draco’s arm. “I don’t like to think of things in terms of evening the score. What you did was wrong, and me using that curse was wrong, too. I had no idea what it did. It was just in my potions book—which turned out to be Snape’s—as a spell ‘for enemies.’ It was reckless of me to try it.” When Draco didn’t look convinced, Harry sighed. “Look, people do both good and bad things. To me, most actions are mutually exclusive. I regret using that curse on you even though you were a prick. I mean, I don’t think I’m evil for doing it, but it was definitely something I would take back. Just like I’m sure you wish you could take back a lot.”
“The car is here for you, Master Draco” Tilly said. Draco’s parents weren’t allowed to accompany him to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters this year. He was somewhat relieved. His parents hadn’t been out in public at all since the War ended, and neither had he. Over his months spent lounging around in apathy, he had imagined dozens of scenarios, dozens of possible reactions to his presence. In all of them, the response was infinitely better without his parents there.
Narcissa shook her head. “He would never hurt me, Draco. We may have a complicated marriage, but we love each other.”
“What sort of things did you say to it?”
Draco sighed. “I’ll tell them when I get home, I suppose. Who knows what’s going to happen with my father now that the Time Turner was found. I doubt he’ll get sent back to Azkaban unless they can prove that somehow he was the one who sent it to me at Hogwarts, which makes no sense.” Draco was already feeling dizzy, and trying to figure out this puzzle only made things worse. Who sent him the Time Turner, and why?
“Rise and shine—I was just going to wake you actually. We should get our robes on, we’re almost there.”
“Of course not,” Gregory finally spoke up, meeting Draco’s eyes for the first time with fire in them that made Draco think he was seeing the ghost of Vincent. “Thanks to Saint Potter, Malfoy got off clean. The whole family, even though the lot of you deserve to rot.”
“No.”
Draco went back to bed a little while later, letter to the
“Well, can’t be too careful these days I suppose,” Ron stated nonchalantly.
“Where have you been? I didn’t know where you were all day and—“
“Yeah,” Draco said truthfully. “Honestly? I’m happy the weight of the secret is off my shoulders. At least it’s all out in the open.”
“Wait—“ Granger said, settling back down on the sofa. “I—could I just ask you some questions? I have an idea but I need some background, and I want to see what...what the Slytherins may think of something like this.”
“I don’t need him to walk me back,” Draco interrupted. “You guys can talk about whatever. I’m fine.”
Draco scratched out the letter. There weren’t enough words that could be used to describe Harry, and his certainly weren’t sufficient. Draco had the tip of his quill to his mouth when he was startled by a kettle being taken out of a cupboard.
!” he said grandiosely, and opened his eyes. Absolutely nothing happened. There wasn’t a hint of smoke or fog, not a sign of anything magical. Draco glared at his wand.
died. Part of me, anyway. Voldemort did cast the Killing Curse on me, and I went to this weird, afterlife train station. Dumbledore was there, and so was Tom Riddle. But he was—absolutely inhuman. That was his fate, that’s where he is now. In pain for the rest of eternity.”
“I mean, only if you want to. I don’t really care. Well, I mean I invited you so obviously I care, but...”
“Rest assured, I have expressed my displeasure at the situation. I am no fan of your parents’, Mr. Malfoy, but I believe that what is happening inside the Ministry right now is more of the same—wizards and witches ruled by fear. I think Minister Shacklebolt has done an excellent job with the current reforms, but only he can go so far. I’ve been in contact with him about this particular situation, and he has agreed to consider what I have to say. Hopefully in the next week or so we’ll learn how long this stint in Azkaban may end up being for your mother and father.”
“You alright, ma’am?” The reporter asked. To him, it probably looked like she stumbled for no reason.
The crowd hushed suddenly, and Draco’s hand flew to his robe pocket to grasp his new wand. But the silence was only because Professor McGonagall had taken the stand, a sizable group of first years standing by her waiting to be sorted. She was beaming down at the crowd, head held high. “Hello students. It is my great pleasure to welcome all of you back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” Cheers erupted in the crowd with some already waving their hats. Once everyone had quieted, the elderly Headmistress continued to speak.
“No kidding. Vanish that mess and scoot over.”
Harry once looked hesitant after he and Draco walked back from one of these dinners. “If I’m intruding, I hope you’ll let me know. I don’t want to mess with your friendship bonds.”
Draco was silent. He didn’t want to invalidate what Harry was saying, but he also didn’t think the two were equivalent. “I could have been better,” he finally decided to say.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked at the application, feeling some fear pulsing through him, but not as badly as before. “Thanks, Professor.”
How is this piece already halfway over? We still need to see everyone’s family. What do you think Draco’s plan is? What should the DA do? Will we ever find out who sent Draco the Time Turner?
“N—no,” Draco said. He was actually not a very good liar.
Draco considered it for a moment. “I’ll try,” he said.
Narcissa looked heartbroken but resigned. “Where will you stay?”
Draco crinkled his nose. “I don’t have a Muggle disease,” he said derisively.
Harry smiled. “Thanks, mate. You too, you look like you could use some relaxing. Falling asleep at five in the afternoon...”
Harry looked concerned. “You’re sure your friends won’t mind?”
Don't even get him started on know-it-all Granger. Draco liked to think she only kept all that horrible hair to disguise the appearance of a garishly deformed head positively bursting with a bulbous brain- Professor Quirrel style. In fact, if he had to choose
"Oh-h-h-h, that's it. That's it, baby, let me- let me see you-"
“Ask Harry. He knows his blondes like I don’t even know the back of my hand.”
Gingerly, Harry trudged forward. He could see Draco peeking at him over his shoulder, his breaths coming fast and heavy as he scissored long fingers into his pretty pink arsehole.
Harry wasn't surprised when he saw the black book. Rather, he was relieved. It made him feel like a horrid bastard of a person for daring to think that way, but the truth was that he was glad.
Harry was on his feet faster than Draco could finish his sentence, and was struggling against his jeans by the time he'd started another.
"That was 'Hips Don't Lie' by Shakira here on The Muggle Mixer-!" the radio blares, before it's silenced by the redhead with a flick of his wand.
"I be speeding this part up, it be too lengthy and tiresome," the Elf said in a bored fashion, and waved its hand. The scene, in turn, sped up to twice its original speed.
? We're not seriously forgetting Vicky, mate."
Gingerly, Draco flipped himself onto his back. His forehead was beaded with sweat, and although not quite as artistic as the soft light of the sconces dancing on his damp skin, the morning light illuminated his whole body, leaving him plain for Harry’s eyes to behold.
Malfoy makes a sound somewhere between a moan and a scream, and suddenly they're moving, the bed rocks and shudders under the combined weight of the two boys and they're... bouncing. Up and down, in and out, screaming and moaning and what not. "More"s and "faster"s and "oh oh
"If it's my fondness towards 'Hips Don't Lie', then I'll have you know-"
“Potter!” he cried, wriggling against the brunet’s mouth and pressing his arse further onto it. “Potter, Potter, Potter, oh- oh Lord, oh Merlin, fuck me-”
Malfoy deserved better.
Disappointingly, what lay before his eyes was very far from his mental image of Malfoy standing menacingly over a poor captive, brandishing his wand and dealing out
"What," the blond said softly, and in a tone far too calm to be genuine, "exactly have you come here to discuss with me, Potter?"
He shut the door almost all the way, and whispered at the last second, "and make sure you are using protection. Albus' mother would have my head as well as my bollocks on a pike if you turned up pregnant."
Others by me:
here?"
Malfoy's cheeks flushed bubblegum pink, and he threw himself at his nemesis with a growl.
"Hurry, put your pants on, git."
thank you for reading!
"What was it about?" Ron asks, staring up at a spot on the ceiling.
This version of her, however, only made him feel sad. It made him wonder what had done this to her.
Ron passed by bleary eyed young Aurors each brandishing a paper cup of second grade coffee as a weapon against the tendrils of sleep-- like normal-- and reached the office area he shared with Auror Watson. He was only a little put out about not having Harry as his partner, but Watson was easy to work with, and not bad company.
- yes! Lord, oh Lord, fuck- fuck me,
…” Hermione evades, “It’s always the default channel on the sound system for whatever reason.”
Photographs upon photographs, mostly wizarding, cut out from Daily Prophet articles, Witch Weekly covers and some others from Hogwarts that he honestly couldn't recognize littered the pages of Malfoy's journal. He turned them fast, as if looking for something, or perhaps hiding a secret. But Harry had seen far too much already.
"Apologies, Mr. Malfoy," Jacobson, as the clerk was called, told him in a wholly unapologetic way, "but Mr. Harry Potter has come to visit you, and it's only standard procedure for me to inform you of such matters beforehand."
"Yes," he replied, walking over to the blond. His eyes flickered from arse, to legs, and back to arse. It was hell on earth, heaven in the flesh. Harry could only let out a shuddering breath, "fuck, yes."
The keening and mumbling and wet noises halt altogether, and she never gets to find out what Harry craves to do "everytime I see your body go all pink like that". Molly almost giggles, it's really so much fun being a mother sometimes.
"...in other news, anonymous sources confirm that the Wizarding World's Hottest Young Celebrity, our very own Saviour Harry Potter-"
“What are you going to do with those, have a nice bonfire?” Blaise tried to joke.
Draco thought of Harry and stood by his word. “With all due respect, Mr. Burke, I’m not going to sit for ten minutes and be berated for no reason. My father in his right mind wouldn’t want that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Even worse, Potter’s presence at night was like a drug. When Draco didn’t have it, he couldn’t sleep. Over the next few weeks, Draco always found Potter next to him for one reason or another when the boys settled down to rest. Sometimes it was Draco’s crying that brought Potter to him, and sometimes Potter came of his own volition after yelling in his sleep. Neither Harry nor Draco ever discussed it, even though they were moving forward with projects of their own.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, things have at least settled down a little. You just have to remember that he’ll be waiting for you to make the first move.”
Draco nodded again and left the Headmistress’s office.
“Well, it wasn’t last year. Not when I was on the run.” Now that he mentioned it, Draco realized there was so much he didn’t know about what Potter spent the past year doing. Defeating the Dark Lord, certainly, but what did being away for a year do? Why didn’t Potter just storm Malfoy Manor and kill him right off the bat? Draco shook his head to clear his mind and returned his focus to his morose nemesis.
It was easy for Myrtle to say that, partially because she was dead. She didn’t have to live with any of the consequences of her actions.
His eyes kept wandering to the Headmaster’s chair above—once occupied by the man he tried to kill, and more recently by his now dead mentor. Still slightly shaky from his earlier panic attack and not wanting a relapse, Draco reached for his goblet. He thought of firewhiskey, being of age, but found it only filled with water. He drank gratefully anyway—his throat felt dry and scratchy.
“The less you know, boy, the better. However, it is very likely that you will end up becoming the official head of the Malfoy household before long. Either your father is going to get an extended imprisonment in Azkaban or will get most of his titles and privileges revoked. You should meet with a financial advisor at Gringotts to start transferring everything to be in your name. The most important thing you can do now is protect yourself and your family as best as you can.”
“UGH!” Draco yelled in frustration, and kicked one of the only pieces of furniture in the room. There was a hard wooden chair in the corner—the room had no windows. There was a table with a lamp, some parchment and quill, and a pitcher of water with a glass. There was also a file cabinet in the corner—locked, Draco soon found out.
Harry roared with laugher. “No, don’t be upset! It was so cute. I loved it.”
“What is he talking about? What snake?” Someone else was speaking but they didn’t matter. Only Harry could fix all this.
“How does he know you’re gay?” Greg chimed in. Draco’s sexuality wasn’t really a secret since no wizard would care enough to find it noteworthy. But it’s not like Draco was particularly flamboyant or flirty, and he did go to the ball with Pansy, so he was often assumed to be straight.
Draco’s first night back at Hogwarts
“What are you doing?” A sharp voice called, startling him nearly to the ground. Ginny Weasley stepped out from behind a tree, her wand shining in Draco’s face. The blinding light obscured her facial expression, but Draco knew it couldn’t be friendly.
One after another, the students Floo’ed into a new Ministry checkpoint. Using Floo Powder to get into the Ministry was heavily regulated since the war, and they were only able to do it in the first place because the Headmistress’s Floo was trusted on the network. Once they reassembled, they walked up to the checkpoint station, where they were greeted by a bored witch—that is, until she looked up.
“What worst memories could they possibly have? Being on the losing side of the war, sure, but it’s not like you lost family. Your life has been cushy, Malfoy, and you’ve been able to rise to the top with almost no trouble, beating people down as you did it. If falling this far is your or your parents’ worst memory, then I would say better to be in Azkaban than out in the real world where bad things can actually happen to you.”
“Where’r we going?” Draco hated the feeling of the alcohol sloshing inside of him.
Draco was reeling and felt sick. He didn’t know what to say. Was his father really guilty of something? How could he do that to Draco’s mother? Lucius had been imprisoned during Draco’s sixth year, but Narcissa never had. Even after the war, they had all just been under house arrest—the Ministry had their hands full with worse Death Eaters, so the Malfoys escaped Azkaban entirely. Draco hadn’t been around Dementors much, but he knew what they could do. How would his mother be able to handle that? Would his parents even survive?
“You alright, mate?” Gregory put a hand on Draco’s shoulder and he flinched. Draco downed the rest of his drink.
“Please eat something, dear. It’s a long journey.” Draco had to make an effort after looking into Narcissa’s eyes across from him. He grabbed a plain piece of toast from the table and took a bite.
The voice holding him sounded panicked: “DRACO! Come on, you have to breathe. Just breathe!”
“Shush! It’s not like it’s a date or anything. It’s just a thing that’s happening.”
“No,” Draco said quickly. He wasn’t upset with Greg for making light of it, a lot of people did, but Draco knew better than most how serious the Unbreakable Vow was. “Fine. It’s someone at Hogwarts and you do know them.”
Granger came up to him at the end of Transfiguration and reminded him to keep drinking and eating sugary things so that his blood supply would replenish. He only managed a nod. Looking at her used to spark deep anger in him, as she was a Muggle-Born who consistently beat him in classes, but now he could only picture her lying on the floor in the Manor being tortured by his aunt. He had never discussed it with anyone, not even his friends, because he was worried what they would say. He didn’t think anyone deserved that, even a mud—it was too hard to even think of that word anymore.
Granger looked at Draco knowingly. “He likes you, don’t you know that?”
Draco slammed down his quill. “What makes you think I’m having trouble casting spells?”
The rest of the dinner went very smoothly, to Draco’s delight. Harry entertained them all with the story about him and Ron transforming as Greg and Vincent respectfully in their second year. They were all laughing by the time the Great Hall was closing for the evening. Draco’s friends may have sensed that Draco wanted to talk to Harry alone, as they took their leave before Draco and Harry walked back to their dorm.
“Enjoying yourself?” Draco startled at Ginny’s voice and dropped the sheet of paper, then quickly shifted it away from the flames.
“Just—just out for a walk,” Draco said while squinting, putting up his hands to shield his face from the strong
do it,” he argued.
“Did any of you guys hear from Theo this summer?” Daphne asked. The boys shook their heads. “Me neither. I’ve always felt something was a little off about him last year. We all knew what you two and Vincent were up to,” she addressed Draco and Greg. “But Theo was so...quiet. We rarely saw him, too.”
“Merlin,” Draco sighed. “And my parents knew about it?”
“Missed you,” Draco said, not even able to form coherent thoughts or sentences.
However, Monday came soon enough and hit Draco like a bunch of bricks. He heard Harry get up to head to the Great Hall before him, as usual. Draco usually waited until about an hour after Harry left to go himself to avoid any unwanted conversations with students at breakfast. This time, however, Harry rushed back into their room while Draco was getting ready for the day.
As always, comments are much appreciated. I love you all!
“What am I supposed to do, have you guys surround me like guards? No, I’ll take whatever comes to me.”
Narcissa remained silent for a moment. She put down her fork and cleared her throat. “Harry Potter is not our mortal enemy, Lucius. And our son is not perverted.”
“Then...yeah, sure, I’d love to go. Should we invite some of your friends, too?”
“I—I don’t want it. I have a new one, but thank you.” Potter looked confused. “I’ve done things with that wand that I never want to do again,” Draco said quietly.
Apart from all that, his life was mostly uneventful. He found he was cruising through his days with a bit of apathy. Sure, his Slytherin friends got him to smile or laugh every once and a while. But the one thing he truly looked forward to all day was getting to spend nights with Harry. The boys mostly ignored each other during the day, not out of animosity, but merely giving each other space to do their own thing. Draco often found himself gazing at Potter during class, wondering how his former nemesis was feeling. This scared him—why was Potter making him so happy? Should he try and stop feeling so good when Potter was around? How did Potter feel about him?
Dean got a spare napkin that he just happened to have with him—
He zoned out, barely hearing Thomas’s scorekeeping comments from below. He knew, though, that his team was falling behind. It was hard to spot anything yellow against the starry backdrop. He and Potter hovered in the air for a second, both looking around.
“Yes,” she said, though she was somewhat hesitant.
Draco was surprisingly hurt by Yarney’s comment.
“I was wondering where you had gotten off to, the rest were waiting for me in the lobby...” Kinglsey looked at Draco with a fake smile plastered on his face. “Please, have a seat.” Kingsley gestured to the empty chair beside Hermione that none of the Slytherins had taken. “Mr. Malfoy,” Kingsley nodded toward Draco, the first acknowledgement of him. Draco took his place behind Harry.
“I’ll have you know—“
To Draco’s surprise, Christine actually looked like she was considering this. “Well,” she said, hand on her chin. “No, we can’t just sit here and stare at each other for the next fifty minutes. But if you’d like, we can play a game to pass the time.”
“They say horrible things about Harry. Even after everything he did. I just can’t believe it.”
“Are you alright, Draco?” She asked kindly.
Finally some wholesome content!
Flickers of last year went through his mind as he ran around corners of the castle. He had been required to return to Malfoy Manor every weekend in order to help the Dark Lord and attend the Death Eater meetings. He remembered hearing her screams as she was tortured, refusing to give any sort of information on Potter’s whereabouts. Once he had remarked to his father that she probably had no clue where Potter was, and for that he earned a clubbing on the arm with Lucius’s cane.
A little angsty, but it wasn’t ever going to go off without any hitches!
“Whenever you’re ready,” Draco said. “Maybe before lunch?”
“First of all, I’m not trying to do anything with Potter, and our interactions are none of your business,” Draco found some of his old courage and haughtiness deep inside. “Second, I told the truth not for sympathy, but because I wanted you guys to know that I wasn’t off just having a grand old time when the Dark Lord was in power! Now move.” Draco didn’t want to give them any time or chance to attack him, so he roughly shouldered through Ernest and Justin. Thankfully they didn’t follow him.
“Well, don’t let me disturb you,” Draco said, moving toward his desk but not quite knowing what to do. He still felt Harry’s eyes on him.
Harry gave a small smile. “That’s exactly why I asked,” he said while sitting across from him. “It’s a nice break, you not caring what I do.”
“Even George?” Harry asked while taking a sip of tea.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco said, anger flaring up inside of him.
“I’m fine, Lovegood.” Draco began to move past her back down the hallway, but she stepped forward and met him in the center of the tower.
Potter nodded and looked down at the wand. “Then you know what?” He held out his hand. “Break it.”
“That’s quite alright, Severus. I imagine he’s stressed about the trial tomorrow.” She then turned back to Draco. “It’s going to be alright. But I want you to know that you’ll always have a place here, so long as you don’t do anything to compromise your probation.”
“We’re just shopping a bit. What are you doing at Zonko’s?”
Draco met Harry’s eyes. He knew that Harry was trying not to look as surprised as he was, but still seemed absolutely delighted. The class applauded politely but unenthusiastically. To them, this was likely a simple task. But to Draco, it felt like he had climbed a mountain.
It also just occurred to me while I was writing this that Draco would have absolutely known Harry was telling the truth in fifth year. But it was to his family’s advantage that no one believed Harry. If only they could have connected a bit sooner, things would have been a lot different...
“On...on purpose?” Blaise said after a few moments.
There was a long pause in between that message and Harry’s response, and Draco was terrified that Harry was going to be angry with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Quite,” Narcissa quipped coolly.
“I know that, love.” Harry could see Draco was agitated. “I love you.”
The article went on to list the names of various Aurors and journalists. Draco balked at the sight of Yarney’s name on that list. It wasn’t a crime to spend time with Harry! Draco looked up and found the Boy Who Lived pacing back and forth across the room, hand rubbing his forehead. He looked stressed and angry.
The shrines were certainly unsettling. Draco foolishly looked for Vincent’s, but his eyes kept being drawn to Fred’s, which was the biggest of them all. His smiling face in a picture with his twin brother was illuminated by candlelight, which worried Draco due to the amount of parchment spread around the shrine. Each was folded for the sake of secrecy, and there were dozens. Draco looked around, but it appeared that all of Dumbledore’s Army was still in the shack. He was a little early, and he wanted some context for what he was about to do. So, against his better judgement, he bent down and opened one of the sheets of paper.
“Nothing. Well, I guess it’s not nothing. You’ll find out on Halloween.” Harry turned over and went to sleep. All he had told Draco was that he would be accompanying Harry somewhere on Halloween, but hadn’t provided any other details, including how they would leave the castle.
Draco sighed with exhaustion. It had already been a long day and it was barely dinnertime. He stole a glance at the stack of textbooks next to him—he really should do homework, but his head was swimming with the events of the day. One small nap wouldn’t hurt anything.
Harry nodded as the stumbled back toward the castle. Everyone else was at classes, so it was blissfully empty of wary stares. “So what do you want to do?”
“Draco? It’s okay, you’re safe. You’re in the Hospital Wing.”
That was, in fact, their first class of the day. Draco hesitantly entered the room in which he had practiced Unforgivable Curses the year before. He could nearly see the blood on the floor from those who had refused to do their homework in protest of the brutality. His heart rate increased, and he regretted eating such a big breakfast. However, to his relief, the classroom looked nothing like it did in the days of the Dark Arts. The chairs were arranged by pairs in a circular formulation with the Professor’s desk at the front of the room. Standing in front of the desk was a lithe, middle-aged woman wearing a beaming expression.
Harry smiled, a truly happy one. “Yeah, his name is Teddy. He’s adorable. I guess you guys would be related, huh?”
A short, bald man looked impatiently as Draco dragged his trunk off the train, then switched to lifting it with both hands. The man led him through the wall out of the Platform and to the parking lot. Draco didn’t have much familiarity with cars, and the man had to gesture for him to put his luggage in the trunk. Whenever Draco’s parents did take Muggle transport, they always had someone to do tasks like that for them. Draco took a seat in the back, and without a single other word, the man drove him to his home. Draco was lost in memories, remembering the fateful day that he dreamed about, and was home before he knew it. Draco was surprised when the driver put the car in park in front of the gates of the Manor, which were creaking open slowly.
Draco later found that he had no recollection of how he got out of Azkaban—he was that much in shock over his father’s behavior. Certainly Lucius had been rough on him before, but not like that. He sounded close to disowning Draco, or attacking him. Draco used to admire his father greatly, and though that pride in his family had decreased heavily over the past two years, he had never seen his father so...pathetic, in the most literal sense of the word. Lucius Malfoy was a shell of his former self, and Draco wasn’t sure that his father would ever regain his old personality. Draco knew that Lucius was heavily affected by the Dementors, yet over the next few days the thought lingered in his mind: how much of what Lucius said did he truly believe?
“What the hell do you mean, you can’t?”
Draco tries to pay for what he has done, and realizes one way he may be able to help.
Surprise! I wanted to have this one out for you guys a little early since I really love your comments. Also if you haven’t noticed, this part of series only has 4 more chapters! Then I think that will be it for 2019. We’ll start the next installment on January 1, 2020 with two chapters a week. This is partially so I can round out the plot for the next installment, and partially because I have my final exams soon and I don’t want to commit to anything I can’t do!
“My Aunt Marge came to visit. And of course I didn’t intend for her to swell up like a balloon and nearly go flying into the sky, but it just sort of happened. She really made me angry.”
“We’ll have to miss class,” Hermione chewed on the tip of her quill. Everyone glanced at her, and she quickly sat up. “But it’s worth it.”
“Ron! It’s great to see you!” Harry walked over to give him a hug. Ron returned it, but kept his gaze on Draco.
Professor McGonagall sighed. “I don’t want any students being attacked at this school, particularly by other students. We’ve had enough of that for a lifetime. I’m assuming you don’t want to tell me who attacked you? Potter said he didn’t know.” Draco shook his head. “Very well. But I need you to understand that you are allowed to tell me these things. You don’t deserve to be attacked.”
“You—pardon?”
“I’m not trying to play at anything! I just don’t know what you guys want. I really am willing to do whatever it takes for you to leave me alone.”
Realizing that Blaise was trying to be comforting, Draco turned to face him and smiled. “Thanks, Zabini,” he said.
“What exactly is happening? What have the Notts done?”
“That’s enough,” Granger said, face flushed partially from anger and partially from drink. “Now isn’t the time or place to talk about any of that.” She looked around the room. “Keep talking everyone, there’s nothing to see here.” Slowly the atmosphere in the room returned to normal as Hermione stepped between Dean and Draco. “Come on, Dean, let’s go play the next round of Exploding Snap.” She steered Dean away from Draco, who stood paralyzed.
“Because Draco was right when he said it would be a good chance to get some fresh air,” Daphne said. “And interact with the others. As we’ve all seen, the amount of forced harmony this year is only going to increase.”
“I know you were out. With Potter. You are incredibly lucky that the
“We’ve been doing this a little backwards, yeah? I mean, not that I know one-hundred percent how all this works.”
Draco paused outside his classroom and smiled at Harry. “I’d like that.”
Arthur beamed and shook Bill’s hand. Even Draco had to add his voice to the chorus of congratulations.
He fully returned to himself steadily, as he often did after a massive panic attack. He knew logically everything that happened that evening, but he didn’t feel any sort of emotions toward it all. Harry was next to him on the couch, his arm boldly around Draco, and Hagrid sat in a chair across from them, telling senseless stories. Draco knew that he was fully back, but Harry didn’t yet. Draco didn’t want this moment to end, didn’t want to return to just one of the infinite amount of times he would have to face what he had done. And so he let his body fall on Harry’s shoulders, watching from above as both boys’ mouths curved into pained and broken smiles.
“What’s wrong?” Draco was worried about how quickly Harry cut off his sentence. Did he not believe Draco’s apology after all?
“No it wasn’t,” Draco scoffed. “I told them about it so that they’d stop looking at me like I was a criminal. There’s nothing brave about that, it’s selfish.”
“What’s it like?” Harry asked, looking so incredibly young.
“But—but I felt—“
Draco nodded and went to the restroom to freshen up for bed. He felt lighter than he had in a long time, and he hadn’t even drunk that much Firewhisky
“No reason,” Harry said, but Draco could definitely tell that something was on his mind. “Hey, do you think next week you’d be willing to go somewhere with me?”
“A notebook?”
They were silent again, then Draco cleared his throat. “I bet everyone had a good laugh over this,” he tried to say lightheartedly.
“Don’t cry. It’s going to be alright.” Had Draco been crying? He hadn’t even noticed until Harry pointed it out.
“He doesn’t have much family left,” Harry said gently. “I won’t lie, even I’m not quite sure how you two are related, but it’s something. Plus, I actually think you’d be amazing with kids.”
“Come on Malfoy, I know you’re a right prat, but they’d never turn away any guest of two recipients of the Order of Merlin,” Ron beamed with pride—Draco pictured him slipping this into conversation any way he could.
“If you’re about to tell all of us we have a Muggle ailment, then I can’t take you seriously. Not that I could to begin with,” Blaise piped up again.
“I don’t know what he wants. That’s part of the puzzle.” Lucius was starting to become agitated.
The next thing Draco knew he was standing in front of the eighth year dormitory, shirt soaked through with sweat. He stopped to dry heave in the hallway before quietly entering the common area, which was thankfully empty. He crept to the end of the hallway to the room he shared with the Boy Who Lived.
And though there hadn’t been an incident like when the Ravenclaw boy had cut him in a while, Draco had a lot of mild burns, cuts, and bruises from when students randomly jinxed him in the hallways. One night Harry noticed a rather nasty burn on Draco’s upper arm as they were lying in bed together. He traced it sadly, watching Draco to see if he would wince.
A few days after that conversation and just a few before winter break, Draco was begging Harry to go outside. “Come on, look at the snow! It’s so pretty.”
“Oh, Saint Potter sticking up for Malfoy, how sweet.” Draco suddenly recognized the voice to be of Zacharias Smith. He was one of the few in the school that seemed to hate both Gryffindors and Slytherins and could also annoy them both. “What, are you guys dating now?”
When Draco finally pulled himself up to a sitting position, Harry felt his forehead. “You’re burning up. I’ll help you get to Madame Pomfrey.”
“But—wait a second, I—“ Draco was panicking.
Potter was hopping around on one leg. “I stubbed my toe on this stupid trunk!” He then kicked it in frustration with his uninjured foot.
“I know,” Harry said. “I’m sorry for involving her but I just don’t think it’s fair that you can’t even defend yourself. It’s more than unfair, it’s dangerous.”
“I mean...I just have no way to heal myself, since I can’t use magic. So I lost consciousness, but I’m not sure I nearly died.”
He knew he was going to black out. He looked around—it couldn’t be here. The hallways were too open, anyone could come along him. This did not help his panic. He tried desperately to remember what his Mind Healer Christine had taught him as he ran looking for safety.
“Good morning! My name is Professor Arden. I’m going to be your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I hope I can provide some much-needed stability to this position. I was an Auror during the First Wizarding War, and up until the takeover of the Ministry I served in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Once the Ministry was taken over, I fled with my children. I’m a proud Muggle-Born, and I was hoping to continue the fight from abroad. I’m extremely happy to have accepted this position.
“What do you mean, dangerous?”
“And that’s wonderful, it really is. But it’s different. I
After a few moments of silence, during which Draco’s hand twitched twice next to Harry’s, wanting to touch his hand but also being incredibly aware that they were walking together in public, Harry spoke. “I didn’t see you at breakfast this morning. I wanted to make sure you were upright.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potter, for once this has nothing to do with you. I know it’s hard to imagine the world not revolving around the great Savior, but do yourself a favor and relax.” To Draco’s great disappointment, Harry left him alone after that.
“Yes, Narcissa Malfoy has been useful to the Ministry, and therefore I don’t think many of us saw the benefits of holding her in Azkaban for much longer,” the man said while the reporter quickly jotted down his words. “She’ll still be under house arrest as her original probation required, and we will need to monitor Malfoy Manor more closely, but she will no longer be imprisoned.” Draco’s heart leapt—he found it hard to believe that his mother was free after only about two hours of a trial, but he was thrilled nevertheless.
“No, listen,” Harry said roughly as he paced. “You—you just left! You just left. You didn’t tell me where you were going or what you were planning on doing. You just up and left. After hearing all that about the Time Turner, after being accosted constantly in the hallways, my nerves were already on fire. And then you just leave when you knew I couldn’t follow you.”
Draco put the cloak on over his suit, and felt a little weakened, but much warmer. “What is this?”
He didn’t have to specify what he was asking about for Harry to know.
“Oh,” Harry said for the third time in a row. “Sometimes...sometimes I think I might be into blokes a bit too. But also girls. It’s just complicated. And I’ve always sort of had bigger things to worry about, you know?” He laughed, and Draco felt a smile turning the corners of his mouth.
“Merlin’s saggy balls, mate! I was starting to think you’d gotten kidnapped right here in the Ministry!” Then, in a quieter voice, Blaise leaned forward. “Did you see your mum?”
Granger smiled. “Apology accepted. But if you think for a second I’m going to apologize for punching you in third year, you’ve got another thing coming.” Draco laughed a bit, remembering how surprised he was at Granger’s aim.
Harry did not know, as he watched Malfoy simply breathing. He had the covers tucked all the way up to his chin as if he were very cold. Eyes closed, Malfoy's alabaster lashes curved beautifully over the pale skin of his cheekbone. The years had treated him far better than they had done Harry and Ginny, for he had not one blemish, not a hair out of place and no eye bags to speak of.
No, Ron was never speaking of this again.  Not when he got home that day and his face flamed with heat when Hermione brought up Harry's name. Not the following week when Harry shocked and surprised everyone with the identity of his new boyfriend. Not two months later when they finally went public and each and every newspaper had the couple's smooching faces plastered on its cover.
"No!" Ron exclaims, and at Hermione's puppy eyes, swallows thickly and firmly reiterates: "Hermione. No!"

"I don't care. I'm getting
Taking a moment to gather her thoughts, Molly pushes the door open after a muttered unlocking spell. A gust of wind blows in through the open window, and she takes in the rumpled sheets, the clothes on the floor, and the pair of worn  silk boxers on the floor right next to a neon potion burn. It's the kind of garment the rich would wear.
"But why's he
"He was
Harry sighs. The sound was drowned beneath Ginny's sarcastic bark of laughter.
Draco thinks furiously, this is the third time today! What is he, following him? Lord and Heavens above, he might actually be in real danger now.
“I don’t know, I guess…”
(Now listen carefully, because this is the part Ron will never, ever want to relive long enough to tell someone about.)
that don't you?" Malfoy's pleased voice floats down, followed by another thump and a groan.
, you know. Shut up about it already.”
"What do you want,
"Yeah, Malfoy what the fuck!" Ron cried in offence.
“…just ask him.”
Pressing a hand to her pounding chest, Molly slowly makes her way down the stairs, wondering how she'll tell her littlest one that Harry Potter is cheating on her with a man.
"Old housemate... he was one of our Chasers up until Fourth year, which was when he graduated. The quality of our team grew exponentially from then onwards," he explained in his usual bored drawl. Harry knew Malfoy just well enough to be able to tell he was being purposefully evasive, however. The visible wiggling of his toes was a dead giveaway.
"You're not having a renaissance artwork themed wedding."
Unfortunately, it was too late, because the time it had taken for Harry to come to his sudden awakening was enough for the clerk boy to finish gushing over the great Harry Potter's presence. In fact, he'd already rung Malfoy up on the Wizarding intercom, and was chirping a jolly "good morning, Mr. Malfoy!" into the magical connection.
They were still with future-Harry and Ginny. This time in a dim bedroom, which was thankfully much cleaner than the disgusting kitchen.
"Oh," Harry pauses thoughtfully, like he's forgotten there's normal people in this household who wouldn't know what the hell is going on, "he's... changed sides. He needs protection
"Higgs, out," Malfoy bit out, glaring the tall man down, somehow, despite being the shortest of the trio.
Harry wished more than anything right then, that he could swoop in and give Malfoy exactly what he wanted. And it was apparent that Malfoy wanted to get fucked. By Harry. It was rather alarming a thought to have, really, if unprepared:
"You great spoilt brat," he mumbles, and instead of lashing out with his snarl and his stick, the blond merely 'harrumphs' and pouts his rosy lips indignantly, "Do you want me to make you something?"
Parting from his bedmate momentarily, Harry moved to whip off his shirt. He did not, however, lose eye contact with the blond for a second. Not when he was tugging Harry's cock carefully out of his trousers. Not when his eyes told him this was the only thing he'd ever wanted.
"You've been ogling me for a
But all Malfoy did was touch his fingers to one of the wet droplets on his face: Harry's sweat. He lifted the fingers up to eye-level, pinching and pressing his soiled digits together, circling his thumb in the saline fluid. There was no sneer of disgust on his face, rather, he had on an expression that Harry could not possibly decipher on his own.
“Gonna eat you.”
Malfoy's spouse clearly did not care for the fact, as he just kept on snoring. Harry grit his teeth to the point where they hurt.
"Oh hell," Harry shut his eyes and tried his best to push down the wave of pleasure that washed over him lest he cum into Draco's mouth. He'd probably like that too, but he had something else in mind for him.
do let me know what you think in the comments please! i'd really appreciate it. my twitter is @dracominnie as always if you'd like to be friends ^^
!' Harry realized with another unpleasant jolt. He'd been well on his way to jacking off to imaginary delusions of a... fifteen year old Draco Malfoy masturbating to a younger Harry Potter.
"Ginny, please," future-Harry said with a sigh that seemed like it had taken his soul with it on the way out, "not now."
!" Ron says dreamily, and Harry's stomach sinks to his feet. He's estimating the number of trays laden with baked goods he'll have to dish out to bribe Ron with until he can get his head out of his arse and hopefully put a stop to all this mad talk about frills. Then Hermione drops a second metaphorical bomb:
"We're--" Watson started.
Harry's son-
Inside the room, on one large bed lay two teenagers: one with golden blond hair that curled at the edges, the other with bright green eyes.
I want you I want you I
Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger
Suddenly Draco's face was very close, and his lips were on his own in a chaste, sweet kiss. "And it makes me want to say something possibly incriminating," he whispered, "we wouldn't want that to happen now would we?"
Malfoy only raised one of his- and Harry didn't want to think of them like this, but it was true- perfect pale eyebrows, and leaned forwards in his seat.
"Just wanted to catch up with you," he smiled at the blond, who raised a delicate eyebrow.
- for lack of a better word- his white hair affectionately. It was like watching a man climbing into a lion's cage and settling down to cuddle with it.
Oh, but he shouldn't be thinking about that now. Especially since the bastard had left him in favour of a ginger woman! Ginger! The greatest of evils, surely. Not to mention, she was also a mudblood, but it was high time Lucius buried that hatchet.
An owl swoops in through his- gods, who in their right mind left it open?-
(See the end of the chapter for
"And I know," Harry leaned very close, close enough to feel Malfoy's breath on his lips and the heat of his bare chest through his tee shirt, "what you're thinking about right now."
His silver eyes sparked with anticipation as he undid the heavy wards he'd placed on the journal. Harry noticed that the wand movements had changed, as well as increased in number since last time. Harry noticed, for the first time, the faded grey twist of Malfoy's Dark Mark lying on his forearm.
It's early in the morning, and he's in a tree, the branch trembling precariously as he holds a binocular to his eyes. Harry's room has no curtains of course, and despite the size of the room, his window is large.
The aforementioned greeted him with a nod and said, "'S checkup day." All right, maybe this was a sign of today being a horrible one. Ron hated checking up on "ex" Death Eater bums on parole once a week, granted it was certainly satisfying to see how they had fallen from their glory, if you could even call it that.
"We're Aurors. We technically don't need anyone's permission to get in," Ron said matter of factly. Gremly deflated him with a single glare.
"It is
"He shouldn't have to do that," Harry growled through his teeth, suddenly very angry at Harry and Ginny from the future, "he should have this time to be a kid, not to be more of an adult than either of-" 'them', he'd wanted to say, but swallowed thickly instead, "us has been."
However, from a parental perspective, this is most definitely something to be phased about! Especially now, after the war, that Lucius has taken a solid oath that he
When silver eyes shot open and his body seized up in orgasm, Harry felt the building heat in his own loins erupt out of the tip of his cock.
Lumos, Draco mused even as he was squinting against the harsh brightness, but Gryffindors were exceptionally stupid.
Leaning far enough forward that the tip of his nose brushed against the smooth expanse of Draco’s back, Harry slammed into him, using all of his levity to push his way inside. Draco let out a sharp moan at his sudden entrance, and hung his head between taut arms, weak whimpers of pleasure escaping his lips.
"Mm, no. I wouldn't let him. This is
There was that word again. Only Harry didn't pronounce it like it had personally offended him.
He wanted, very much, to keel over and sob.
"I'm sorry to hear that, Mister," Jacobson apologised, this time actually looking the part, "oh, before you leave, would you mind terribly if I asked for your auto-"
Finally free of the restrictive fabric, Harry kicked the denim aside with a glare before hurrying over to where Draco stood offering himself so shamelessly.
In fact, the halfblood founders, Helena and Albert Moore had likely named their store so similarly just to spite the other business.
With unbelievable care, Malfoy folded the tie up and slid it back into its envelope. his throat constricted and a dull ache bloomed to life in his chest as he looked into the blond's eyes, where he found barely concealed anguish- as well as burning shame.
that Draco was not the owner of the gruff voice. For that could only mean it's his son who lets out an answering affirmation of:
"But he's not a murderer," Harry continues, softly, "And he's got brilliant grades, by the way. Second best in our year. Can you leave?" he asks abruptly, "I don't much fancy talking to you."
“Don’t worry!” he placates with raised palms, “It was a compliment. Apparently, you can do it very quick.”
If it weren't for the cherubic infant dozing away beautifully in her arms, Harry would have shrieked at the sight she made.
was printed clearly on the parchment, "Isn't he, y'know, Harry's? He's kind of weird about it."
"Surely this is getting a tad depressing," Draco said quickly, making a beeline for the door, "Have fun at your... colleague's."
to see this; Draco Malfoy-Potter on his knees in front of him, mouth on his cock, and a hand down his own pants.
Malfoy's cock was half hard, and just the way he remembered it. Now a rich pink instead of dark red, it dangled  between his legs ever so teasingly, twitching up and falling back down to point at the sheets every so often. There was the slight curve of his bollocks peeking out at Harry like the forbidden fruit, and he wanted nothing more than to nose along the delicate flesh of them. To press his lips to them and suck them into his mouth-
“That was the
There's actual hissing, like a snake, and someone whispers about how much they "fucking love it when you talk like that" and someone moans about "how much of a fucking slut you are, baby."
“What the—” Potter lowers his voice, “
"Who are you?" Dudley attempts to asks firmly, but it comes out as a weak stammer and the boy's lip curls impossibly more over pearly teeth, utter disgust betrayed by his eyes.
"Ginny, I want to marry... I mean I want to
"It'll be wonderful! Muggle renaissance art is beautiful and unique on it's own, and that's barely scratching the surface of it! Have you
"Okay, okay," Harry nodded the affirmative, his heart still racing from the spook he'd received, "why are we at Hogwarts? And what's Oliver doing here?"
All three fingers were adorned with big, bejewelled rings, slick and shiny with lubricant.
He's on top of his girl, kissing and sucking, no doubt even if their faces are out of sight. Dudley does, however, see his fingers pumping in, out, in, and out of a tiny pink little hole between her legs, her pubic area covered by another of Harry's large, rubbing hands. Dudley feels his pants growing tight around his groin and he rubs himself against the hard bark of the tree.
“I want you,” Harry complied immediately, pulling at Draco’s cock in tandem with his thrusts, feeling the foreskin slide noisily over his shaft and revelling in his lover’s moans, his whimpers and his ‘
Molly's first guess is, predictibly, one of a sexual nature. There's no doubt about it.
looks? Colour him surprised, Father may have been right! It’s really not all that far-fetched. Salazar knows he’d been stalking him like a madman at school, perhaps for a moment of release from the toils of schoolwork at the hands of Draco’s meticulously kept beauty.
"Stupid quack spirits," the brunet grumbled, removing his spectacles and slamming them down on the bedside tabletop. His aching cock made it difficult for him to lie comfortably, and although he tried his very best to ignore the damned thing, it in turn did the most to remind Harry that he had ended up never seeing how Malfoy looked when he came.
usually invite a bunch of people home while they disappear to Merlin-knows-where themselves."
"Come along, young one," the jolly spirit said, and in the blink of an eye, Harry found himself in a rather stylish bedroom fit for a celebrity.
He couldn’t believe that was only one day of school. It felt like the entire summer combined. All in all though, it could have been much worse. He’d take glares and snide remarks any day over even the best of times last year.
Draco nodded uncomfortably. He swallowed. “Are—are my parents alright? Dolohov had mentioned my father...”
He was in what appeared to be a small holding room. It was carpeted and only contained uncomfortable wooden chairs and a small desk. A pitcher of water sat in the corner near the fireplace, which wasn’t lit. The false windows showed a gloomy sky. Looking at the morose view was his mother, weak and shaky but sitting straight and tall. His heart was racing—he wanted more than anything to run to her, but Mr. Burke couldn’t know he was there.
How could Harry do this? How could he befriend him, make Draco trust him, and then just stop participating in a significant ritual for him with no prior warning? Draco felt like this was the rejected handshake ten times over. Another part of Draco wasn’t mad but resigned.
“Well...thanks.” Harry looked awkward, even after seeing Draco in nearly a dozen embarrassingly vulnerable situations in the past few years.
“Shut up, Potter. I like you. I really, really do. I want to be with you. I want to go to Hogsmeade with you and hold your hand. I want to know every part of you, all your likes and dislikes and all your flaws. I want to go to sleep with you next to me every night. I want to tell you everything about myself. I want to spend as much time with you as I can, because I enjoy you that much.” Draco paused only to take a breath, and extend his hand. “Harry, will you go on a date with me?”
When Harry came to, it was bright outside.
"Then-"
tching," Malfoy said petulantly, looking far too pleased with himself. He was lounging back on the sheets as if nothing was amiss and the three of them got up to shenanigans like this on the daily. His bits were out for the world to see as if he were saying 'carry on! It's nothing you haven't seen already.'
However, instead of Ginny, in toppled a lanky teenager with a shock of blue hair on his head. The poor fellow had tripped over seemingly nothing at all, and that was when Harry knew that this was none other than his Teddy.
“Scared of what?”
Draco didn’t waste time going back to his room—he had been risky enough for one evening. He entered silently, finding Harry in the same position in which he left him, except more stretched out. There was no more room on the couch. Draco kissed Harry’s forehead, grabbed a pillow from his bed and Harry’s duvet, and slept peacefully next to him on the floor.
It was at that unfortunate moment that Zacharias Smith saw this exchange. “Well,” he said, smirking. “What do we have here? Not only does Harry Potter like it up the arse, but he likes Death Eaters?”
“Searched? Why?” Draco tried to keep his tone polite, but anger bubbled beneath the surface. His family home had been searched dozens of times over the past few months, and he knew how anxious it made Mother to have uninvited guests.
“I—I don’t want to hear about what you went through, Potter. You and I are totally different. I don’t care what you have to say. I’m fine. Just leave me alone, I don’t know why you’re bothering me so much.” Draco thrust open his trunk and started gathering his robes.
“Nevertheless,” Mr. Burke spoke calmly. “There is nothing more we can do. You must think of your son. I think he’s been struggling lately, and you need to be there to guide him into adulthood. Particularly if he is going to have to take over the family assets at the turn of the year.” Mr. Burke spoke about this like it was almost a certainty. Draco always knew he would one day inherit the Malfoy fortune, but he didn’t expect it to happen so young. He also was terrified at what his father would do if the fortune was taken from him while he was still living. The accusations he had hurled at Draco would become a reality.
“He didn’t call her anything. You have something you want to say?” Goyle threw down his napkin and stood up.
“Granger.” He greeted her calmly but with a somewhat cool tone. While the two had reached nearly friendly terms, Draco didn’t think they ever would get there. However, they had something in common—a deep affection for Harry. Hermione looked up at him expectantly. “I have an idea.”
As he closed his eyes, he concentrated on watching these images fly past him again and again, a cycle of comfort in which he could maybe find some peace.
"Yeah, mate, Malfoy's not that bad anymore," Harry shrugs, shifting to balance his elbows on the glass table, careful to avoid the mysterious orange goop that's been coagulated on the surface of it since Merlin-knows-when. Granted, he hasn't seen Malfoy up close since the war trials, and even then, Malfoy had not been quite... well... Malfoy enough to call it a proper interaction. He's just recently joined the Falmouth Falcons as Seeker: a year or so later than Harry had entered the world of competitive Quidditch, given that he's probably had to train longer. All he's seen of the blond after that is, well, his blond hair- silver, if you will- characteristically glinting from afar.
"Weird and obsessed over him?" Ron rolls his eyes and takes a blank parole form from the desk, "He gets like that with Malfoy, yeah. Been a problem since Sixth Year. He says he thinks he's," he makes quotation marks in the air, "up to something. I just think he's a great git."
"Probably," Harry agrees with a sigh.
Draco rolls his eyes so severely that he sees black. Whenever will the Wizarding press get their heads out of Potter's arse?
Malfoy had tears in his eyes, mouth wide open and hips bucking in wild confusion, backward onto Harry's cock and forwards into the brunet's hand cupping his own. Through the gap between his thighs, Ron could see its pink glistening head disappearing in and out of the hand he'd countlessly shaken and hi-fived and--
want is to see you fuck yourself like the needy whore you are. Do it."
This perversion will only end once he's dyed his hair a different colour. See if any Potters go mooning over
"Shhh," the spirit shushed him rudely, "now is being the beginning of the real vision. Mister Harry Potter is to be watching carefully."
Two hands grab at the cock, one squeezing his own shaft and the other, his balls. "Potter, Potter, oh, I ca- can't take it- I need-"
Future-Harry sighed, and turned his gaze towards the empty, mismatched chair. A million ideas whizzed through Harry's head about what could have happened to its occupant, the second child. None were pleasant thoughts.
Dudley feels dirty. He expected to find out more about the mysterious Malfoy character in the room but it seems like Harry's got a girlfriend after all. They must be using the M-word to muffle the noises from the rest of the house, but from the outside, he's loud. Dudley's a good 10 feet or so away from the window but he can hear clearly the noises that spill out of Harry's mouth.
Ginny's expression was so ugly, so hurtful, that Harry had to look away from her. His eyes fell upon Lily, napping blissfully in her crib with a silencing charm shimmering around her. He wished dearly to pick her up and take her far, far away from here.
Harry averted his eyes from the lean white body, before wondering why he had reason to do so and promptly turning back to face him.
Of course things like this are bound to happen at some point when you're gorgeous, rich and inclined towards men (Lucius himself included, of course. Although he had had a certain affection for the gardener's son instead, at Draco's age- much to the dismay of his actual lover). He shouldn't be phased at all, really.
Ron knew it was going to be the worst day ever when he woke up to a significant lack of milk in the fridge.
"Mm," agrees Ron.
"Yeah, he used to be on the... dark side. Now he's converted to the light side."
There was no time to appreciate the tasteful decor of the penthouse as the brunet tried his best to find Draco as quickly as possible. He would have called out to him, but he had a feeling he'd have to do this himself.
Malfoy was a complete stalker. This much was clear. Sure, most of the pictures were published for everyone to see, but it didn't make it any less... strange, or- Harry squeezed his eyes shut in frustration- arousing.
On second thought, maybe it’s just Malfoy’s renewed battiness talking.
!- however, was almost a spitting image of Harry, just as Harry was nearly identical to his own late father. His hair was ridiculously messy, and his green eyes were currently wide open and on high alert. Certainly, getting caught in the act by your boyfriend's dad would do that to you, not that Harry would know.
"Ron! That's disgusting!" Hermione gasps, apalled, just as Ron asks, "Petite Woven Baskets?"
Then again, perhaps those were things Malfoy had been attracted to, he wondered as he dried his hands on a towel, would Malfoy still feel the same? With an only slightly broader Harry and a noticeably more handsome Malfoy?
He mewled as Harry pulled out almost completely before he began to pound into his mouth. Hips snapping hard and fast, he tried his best to keep his eyes on the sight that was Draco. His hand had halted on his own dick, eyes shut as he came into it.
(this is not an update)
"One too many-! Harry this is Malfoy we're talking about here! Malfoy? You know?"
"What?" Harry blinked twice, so invested was he in the vision that he hadn't fully escaped it yet.
'He was
The brunet grinned victoriously and stepped back to join his friends in their circle. Draco eyed him the whole way there.
"Draco!" Harry frowned harder, obstructing the blond's body from view with his arms.
A major downside to these visions was that Harry simply never had enough time to process one bit of information before another barged right in to smack him in the face. This fact was proved rather well when, just as he was starting to process the emotional significance of seeing Teddy all grown up, Ginny walked in.
Had Malfoy gotten over his obsession with Harry? Had he, perhaps, moved on to the spouse sleeping next to him in bed.
Quietly, he made his way up a flight of stairs to Sirius' bedroom, or, well, what was now Harry's bedroom. The walls had been painstakingly bared of any and all half-naked women, courtesy of the Hermione, but little else had been changed.
something he asked for now, can we?"
"Pardon my directness, but are we speaking about Potter's deceased, married father?" Draco's voice climbs in pitch with every next word.
"Enough, Mippy," a new voice cut in, and Mippy was thrust to the side in the wake of a much bulkier house elf, "Aurors, everything is being fine. Master Draco is being good and following rules and Gremly is requesting Aurors to be leaving now."
Mippy began to look confused (and Ron really should have started to suspect that the Very Bad Thing was bound to happen any moment now), "Mippy is not understanding, Aurors. Harry Potter is--"
"Why there is only one way to find out!" the Spirit exclaimed, before proceeding to half-pull, half-drag Harry back to the window.
Unable to wait a second longer for his arrival, Harry decided against calling out to Draco and made to speed down the hallway himself.
"Please, Aurors," the poor little thing wailed, cutting him off, "Master Draco is being very good! Master Draco isn't deserving Azkaban! Master Draco is following all the rules!"
“Right. Alright then,” Hermione straightens up, “Ron’s waiting for us at
"Potter..." he sputtered in a gasp, taking several sharp intakes of breath, “fuh, fuck- I’m, I’m
at the Weasleys'. Harry knew they meant well, but he simply felt like it was too early. Or something.

Ginny looked nothing like the fiery girl she was in the present. Neither did she look like Molly, aged but full of love, and life. She simply looked- defeated.
"Ginny, I-Love-You. Will you marry me?" Harry muttered to himself as he stripped off his shirt, then his pants. He furrowed his brows, and shook his head, for it sounded all wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hey, that's not nice," Harry chuckled, assuming this was a play on the elephant in the room (which, rude, by the way! Ron was appalled!). His misconceptions were shot down however, when Malfoy gently tipped his chin up so he could (finally) get a look at-
Heaving a deep breath, he swung his legs off the side of the bed and planted his feet resolutely into the softness of the rug on the floor (determinedly ignoring the telling white stain on the rug). He raised his eyes to the window through which wan sunlight filtered in.
"Oh fuck oh fuck-"
"Dream," he grunts once he finds them and puts them on. He scratches at his bare chest.
Malfoy was still just as beautiful as he had been before, turning around and walking towards a great mahogany desk at the back of the room. His arse moved wonderfully as he did, completely in the nude as he was, and drew Harry's eyes to it inevitably-- even when he sat the pretty thing down, bare onto the leather of his desk chair.
Draco was on his knees atop his bed, face buried in the mattress. The silk dressing robe had been hiked up, over the gorgeous curve of his lower back and three pale fingers were buried to the hilt in his arsehole.
His nerves on high alert, Harry sat up in his seat, eyes trained on Malfoy, and only Malfoy. Tepid silver eyed stared back at him, but his foot was jiggling in a most uncharacteristic way and that was all Harry needed to see.
"Fuck, Potter," he whispered to the emptiness of the locker room, digging clean fingers into the purpling spot where he'd just been punched, "so fucking easy to rile up, aren't you?"
He hoped it wasn't him.
"I remember this," Harry thought, still examining Malfoy in his fifteen year old state. He was sure that's when this had taken place, because he recalled that that was the year in which the blond's voice had begun to crack.
"We should go," Ron said matter-of-factly, "nothing to see here. But this isn't over, Harry, mate."
Malfoy's future spouse hurried off to the lift. Harry vowed not to let that idiot near the blond ever again- much less to become his husband. Silently, he offered an apology to the Scorpius who would never come to be- as long as he had a say in it.
He came to his senses in another bedroom. Before Harry could analyze his surroundings, however, he caught sight of Malfoy and knew immediately that all else was nil compared to him.
"Funny thing," Watson smirked, tossing their agenda sheet to him, "we finally got Malfoy."
Being physically present before the polished glass doors to Malfoy's apartment complex was decidedly different from floating about it in his dreams. No doubt, it was a Wizarding building, if the obvious tingle of ward-magic was anything to go by.
"I'm assuming you're gonna show me the future?" he asked it, waiting in vain for a reply. He sighed again, "Not a talker, then. Fine, let's get this over with."
"Fuck!"
it!" Draco yanks the frame out of his father's hands and places it face down on the table once again.
fired for looking at her a second too long. And when she'd thrown out half of Harry's sock collection when he 'forgot her birthday' while in truth he'd been planning a surprise party for her. It had taken numerous summoning and cleaning charms, as well as a hellish breakup to retrieve every last pair, and yet, they'll never be the same. You can't mess with a man's socks, period.
"He's an alright-looking bloke," Harry scratches his head, suddenly thoughtful, "Nothing to write home about. Although he does have a pretty decent color palette-"
"Daddy," Draco says mildly, because Lucius' eyes are glazing over and that's never a good sign, "So... we're going?"
that?" Ginny's voice rose incredulously, "How else would you explain constantly being away? Ron's an Auror too, but where is he right now? Oh yes! Vacationing in Greece with his wife while the kids stay with me!"
Albus chose not to say anything at all. Harry drank in the sight of him, the button nose he'd inherited from Ginny and the light freckles scattered across it.
Not without a bit of bitterness, Lucius recalls his own brief affair with his lover that had been disappointingly cut off first by his parents, and later by said lover himself! They'd been so young-- he remembers with a forlorn sigh-- for starters, his knees were, at the time, not at all stiff and perfectly capable of bending into pretzel like shapes, all the better for the two of them when they were to-
"Sides..?" Dudley asks, because he's speaking nonsense again.
"Nothing of importance, son," he says firmly.
Harry's stomach grumbled and he decided that a bit of breakfast beforehand would do.
The Elf was nowhere to be found, and Harry groaned again. He did not, for a second doubt that the spirits were real. The visions, however, left him rather dubious.
i've let it slide this time, because they technically did credit me at the end of the repost-- but it still doesn't change the fact that they never asked me if i was alright with it before doing so!
interested in dating him after years of vehemently rejecting him and he said I was only a rebound fuck until his one true love came around and I had to dispose of the engagement ring I'd custom ordered for him-"
“It’s not
Deep down, Harry’s a bit wounded. Would Malfoy really prefer to lose the hair he thinks is so superior over the slight chance that Harry could find it attractive? Right after he’d defended him in front of his best friends, too. He’d really hoped the man had changed, as he watched him whizz around on his broom after practice, blue robes billowing behind him like a flag.
"But- that bloke-"
“I want you… more,” he whispered back, leaning forward to lick at Harry’s lower lip. He closed his eyes against the feeling, fingers tightening on Draco’s body.
"Oh fuck, oh Merlin, Draco-- yes!" Harry's face was buried in the junction between Malfoy's shoulder and neck, suckling on the skin there between little phrases, "So fucking tight, baby--"
"Oh yeah?"
"Hey! I was gonna see myself pummelling Malfoy again!" Harry whined, but the Elf raised a hand to stop both his stream of words, as well as the scene before them.
He did so eagerly, and the brunet loomed over him. He looked him in the eyes, currently blown wide with lust and anticipation, and spit into his mouth. Draco groaned low and loud, his lips still parted with a glob of Harry's spittle visible: sitting innocently on his tongue.
Then something did explode. A loud bang sounded and ricocheted off the stone walls. Even as Draco struggled to relieve his eardrums of the aftereffects of the noise, four bright red letters dancing above his head revealed his cursed fate to the room.
