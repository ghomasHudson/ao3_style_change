As Harry feels his power igniting in the scar on his forehead and spreading down across his face and sparking in his hair, he studies Dracon for his reaction.
want.” He tilts his head further, maintaining eye contact. “You want to bite me, don’t you, Potter?”
With speed he's unaware he possessed, Harry slides off the crate and dives for the electricity box on the wall. As the first shots ring out and ping off the sides of the metallic cargo, he touches the box and pulls a string of electricity from it. Tangible lightning crackling in his hand, Harry whips it out at the villains coming from around the stacked boxes. He watches them stumble backwards, some falling down while others flee. Quick as a flash, he strikes one of the stacked crates, sending it toppling over the other side amid shouts of alarm.
Harry takes off the dragon skull mask and juggles it between his hands as he eyes Paper Dracon. If Dracon did get sentenced tomorrow, would Harry
Neither of them move, and Draco releases a frustrated breath. “This entire time, I thought you were afraid to touch—to be around other people, around
What he gets is a sharp inhalation and the subtle shift of Dracon’s hands to steady himself against the tree behind him.
At Voldemort’s summoning, Prancing Peacock shuffles over in the most demure and subservient stance Harry had ever seen him take, head held low.
“You know, right? Just listening to him...” Potter leans against one of the walls and sinks down to the floor. “My vampire—I never told you, maybe because I was ashamed, maybe because you wouldn’t believe me, I don’t know. My vampire was a woman too.”
Harry can’t help but grin a little as he lets the two masks fall to the ground. Slowly, he internally reaches out for his electricity. He finds it, though it feels much weaker than it normally does when he goes to power up. But that’s fine; there’s enough.
“Jeeze. Are you and I always this stubborn?” Ron mutters something about understanding Hermione’s frustrations a little better. “I’m saying that you started something with that villain. Your opinion of him didn’t really negatively change when he was involved in the Westminster break-in, or any of the other crimes he was involved in during your other interactions with him. Yet the way he’s interacted with you has steadily changed for the positive since the start of all this over a month ago.”
“Don’t know, really.” He moved as though to sit next to Harry on the bed and floated just above the spread, hands twisting in his lap. “Just remember going for my nightly promenade and musing how much my afterlife was wasted, knowing I couldn’t pester you. I wanted to haunt your every moment so badly, I felt it more than the air whistling through me.”
Harry’s pleased to have found the final ace in the deck, and he places it in its fourth separate pile. “But, really, he seemed kind of upset that you gave me your rendezvous point. Got into a whole tussle over it. He’s still injured, by the way. You wouldn’t happen to know who gave those to him? Or that broken leg?”
When Dracon reaches for his arm again, Harry doesn’t pull away. Instead, he allows the villain to lead him along the crate to its edge where they both hop on a paper swan Dracon pulls from his pocket.
“Well, I mean, I first was having doubts when I thought over Dracon’s injuries. Like how he got them, and why he was left in a ditch in an abandoned part of town. One of the theories I had was that he’d received them fighting with another villain since the attacker didn’t bring him in to the police.”
A smirk works its way onto Harry’s face—not that anyone around could see it with the two layers of masks covering him. The Hero Order may have been led around by the nose for several weeks, but, in this moment, they’re the ones playing the Villain Agency like a fine-tuned harp, note for note. With all the chaos and destruction the other heroes are causing, the Agency wouldn’t expect their prisoners to escape on their own.
It gets a chuckle out of Potter—a light thing whispered out on a breath, but Draco still feels a fierce thrill at having made him laugh. “So, what, Malfoy? You saw my name on the paperwork and jumped at the opportunity to see me like this? See what’s become of
“If it’s not yellow-taped too much, I’ll try to have a look around there too. See what I can find out in daylight.”
“Oh... around,” Malfoy said with a wave of his hand. At Harry’s seething look, Malfoy relented. “These fine fellows you see before you are much older ghosts than I am. They’ve been around so long that their original haunts have since been destroyed by time, construction, natural disasters, and the like. Untethered from a specific location, they’re free spirits, roaming about to haunt whomever they please.”
He doesn’t know what she’s referring to or why the both of them are suddenly hugging him so tight. But he feels an odd sense of calm washing over him nonetheless, and he sinks into their embrace.
Harry looks up towards the second level, but he’s not at a great angle. The light’s too blinding where it streams in from the hole in the ceiling for him to see properly up towards the roof.
As his thumb runs back up the crack, Harry’s eyes are drawn back to Dracon’s lovely piano fingers. Involuntarily, he thinks of all the times those same digits would dig into Paper Dracon’s pockets and fling sharp, deadly paper at him . . .
Snorting, he says, “That’s a way to put it. Fear-Near demanded we move them to my flat. I’d felt uneasy about it, but I did it.” He lets out a shaky breath. “Then Fear-Near comes in with a new
Potter. You out of everyone is meant to last, to survive. Just the thought of damning you to my fate—”
Despite the parasol and his trussed-up state, Potter still does not walk beside Draco. He has to keep turning his head several times to check that Boy Wonder is still there. Each time, Draco spots him, not directly behind him, but several paces behind and to the side. He decides not to ask. If Potter wants to follow him in the oddest way possible, who is Draco to call deliberate attention to it in the middle of a public street?
. Nevertheless, Harry’s breath catches once his brain latches onto the first bit of Dracon’s response, and he tries his best to hide his sudden interest.
“He attacked me with one of his giant paper swans. Think he flew away on another one while I was distracted.”
Twilight reflects off the glass windows of the shops and businesses in the financial district, painting everything a purpling pink with dashes of golden orange. The street lamps start to turn on in the gathering dusk, prepared to replace the dying light with electrical radiance. In this type of setting, Harry loves to just soak in the sense of being connected to the bridge between natural and man-made wonders. His electricity is both a power of nature and power of man, and here he stands, living proof of that. It’s enough to make him breathless.
Since Dracon hasn’t moved much aside from his initial reaction, Harry goes for a friendlier smile. “You wanted to see me?”
Harry mostly sat poking at a stray pea on his plate through the exchange, the argument a familiar one. He’s glad this one doesn’t seem to be going on as long as usual.
“Sorry to bother you, but would you know where the evidence items were put that were recovered from headquarters?” Harry bounces on the balls of his feet as he awaits her answer.
Alpha Bee, who keeps his mask a simple felt one that wraps around his eyes like a headband, blinks at Harry. “I’m afraid you’ll have to get a little more specific than that, my boy.”
“Er... He sort of did that on his own. And you can get your cloak before you leave this time. It’s still on the rack.”
and Mad-Eye. Harry winces as he watches the poisoned tips of Peacock’s feather darts graze the two heroes. That’s one Supervillain Harry had hoped to not fight again after his first run-in with him a year back. To this day, Harry is unsure if he has grown to be a match for the skill with which Peacock fights.
Crackling echoes around him as every last bit of whatever Dracon had attacked him with either turns to dust or catches fire. Harry’s eyes shoot open to see the last flurries of paper scraps burn in front of him.
His eyes dart over the piece of machinery, begging for answers. Pressing his gloved hand against the glass, an idea strikes him as he stares at the electrical current running in its lightning pattern along his gloved hand. Carefully, he slides that hand down until it presses against the table surface and not the glass. Then, Harry shoots little bursts of electricity through the crack where the glass meets the table.
As he heads out of the hospital, Harry thinks about how the cop told him one worthwhile detail—however unintentionally he may have done so. The police are stationed to watch over the survivors of the hostage situation. Which means they have reason to suspect the culprit to come after them—that it wasn’t a circumstantial kidnapping-turned-murder after all.
“Hmm?” Harry opens his eyes and wonders when he shut them. He sees Justin’s hair standing on end. “Oh! Sorry!” Letting go, Harry steps back. “I forgot myself there.”
says, “This was why most of the older heroes didn’t want you younger ones to be involved in this case. You’re too inexperienced to know when personal morality has to be put aside to benefit the greatest amount of people when you’re placed in a difficult situation where no truly right path exists. Unfortunately for us, the Villain Agency appears to have no qualms to subjecting their younger members to the harsher realities.”
With how Draco’s mood seemed to spiral in the following days, Harry approached his best friends with a dangerous idea—a positively Gryffindorian idea.
Draco sees a flash of green as the light reflects off Potter’s glasses. Not red. He feels himself exhale.
From this angle, Harry can see that some even fell to the floor in all the commotion. Moving his gaze to the left, he notices that Blaizing Fire now sits limply in his seat, head turned toward the ceiling. He has half a mind to ask whether he’s all right, too, but his tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth.
Draco sighs. “It’s none of my business what caused the rift between you and your friends, just that being bitten made it worse. And, thing is, just as isolation may have helped in choosing targets, it was also meant to silence them. But—do you feel alone now, Potter?”
The Weasley family roof has a small square patio with black rails boxing people in and preventing them from falling. It’s empty when Harry steps out into the night. Stars and a half-moon glitter above in a rare clear sky.
Nodding to himself, he darts inside the nearest building and starts to climb the stairs. Once he reaches the roof, albeit rather winded, Harry leans over the edge to peer down at the fight happening below.
s, now he could just take people’s powers, and, while the robots would be the ones to have them, Voldemort would be the one to control the robots.”
Draco shrugs. He’s never come across it happening before. Vampires tend to use their hypnotic allure to keep their victims pliant. Would Polyjuice affect that?
The four kids chatter different excuses at him, telling him that “it’s all right to skive off sometimes,” and “it’s been so long since” he last played with them, and that, surely, the city could stand “five minutes” without him.
“Then how about you tell us why you stole Superheroes’ identities from the government.” Hermione speaks this time, arms across her chest.
Dracon grabs the front of Harry’s costume—Harry’s electric current so weak it doesn’t phase Dracon—and lifts him partially up from the ground. “I. Am
He’s taken to carrying an unburdensome first-aid kit with him on his patrols, the handle sliding nicely through his belt loop and the box tapping lightly at his thigh. The extra amount of care he can now provide endears him faster to the people he helps. Turns out gauze and bandages go a long way.
Then Draco is racing out of the observation room after Potter. He pauses as he enters the empty stretch of hallway. Looking left and right, no sign of Potter appears; Draco hopes that he hasn’t Apparated home by himself. Pausing and trying to still his fast-beating heart, he takes the time to listen. He notes the scuffling noises coming from behind the door to the right, the one that leads to the interrogation room. Beyond that, he doesn’t hear much.
Sliding off the roof, he lands in the nearly empty street. Apparently, he had been the only one not to check the weather report today. That’s fine. If the storm ends up being real blustery, not many folks would want to be out and about, meaning Harry could head home early.
Harry rolled his eyes. “No. Unless you bit it at this block of flats, I don’t see how you could be here at all. Aren’t ghosts confined to the area of their death?”
Harry felt uncomfortable at how sad Malfoy seemed at that and hated himself a little for feeling that way. “Where were you before? Maybe I can stop by and see if I can find it?”
cut off your connection, the device continued to run as though powered by you. Further attempts by him to deaden its power were useless. The device—the arm, as you call it—felt the need to release the energy you had given it—”
Harry had faced Dementors, Death Eaters, and Voldemort himself, his Gryffindor credentials well earned. So it was not a mark of cowardice from Harry when he spun on his heel and bolted back to his room, locking the door with every legal protection ward known to wizard-kind. No, Harry was just tired; now two months after Voldemort’s demise, he’d had his adventures and didn’t need any new nonsense thrust upon him.
Harry catches the sleeve of his coat—which he must have put on at some point when Harry had been turned away. His periphery vision catches more black further up, and his eyes involuntarily flick up.
This is Ron’s territory exclusively now for over a year, and Harry tries to feel confident with him at his side. Ron certainly walks like he has nothing to fear in these streets, the same way Harry‘s come to feel in Shoreditch. Hands behind his head, Ron slants a look Harry’s way. “So what d’you think Fire meant exactly? You reckon it’s a rendezvous point or some kind of ambush?”
But as Harry looks at the paper lighting bird, realizes it’s manned by two people, and that Voldemort has two hands, he knows it won’t be enough.
“What more could there be to it?!” His glasses nearly fly off with the emphatic hand movements that come with his statement.
As they walk, Harry stuffs his hands into Blaizing Fire’s coat pockets and is surprised to not find any of his matches, lighters, or bottles of lighter fluid. Although, he’s grateful not to have to worry about the latter—had it still been there, Harry could have caught on fire or caused an explosion when he powered up. Luckily for Harry, Fire had thought to keep those items for himself when handing over his clothing. He wonders if they’ll run into Blaizing Fire when they run back in.
The aging Auror plops two moving pictures on the tabletop—one of Ms. Adams and one of Mr. Park, both before being bitten. “Recognise these folks?”
“No bringing other people into the fun? I suppose I can cope with that. But, Potter, give up your cooking? Why, I’d die again without it!” He batted his lashes at Harry.
There were a number of things to say crowding at the tip of Harry’s tongue, but a greeting wasn’t one of them. Instead, Harry settled for: “Where the fuck did
Striking as the beauty around him was, Harry began to feel unnerved with how everything looked not like it should. He stopped moving and tried calling out for Draco. With the third attempt, he got a reply.
, really. And, it would be... irresponsible? Of me as an Auror in-training to just, let that—that monster go after someone else.”
“I believe it was Granger that filed the paperwork, but I’m not sure. I wasn’t in the office when it happened. And,” Draco says with an involuntary twitch of his jaw, “before you get your knickers in a twist, they didn’t exactly
There, they found Malfoy pacing like a caged hippogriff—overly proud, yet dignified in agitation. He rounded on them as they stepped from the shadows. “Took you long enough, Po—oh. Hello, Granger.”
The hum of the electricity in Harry’s ears is so loud, and he’s closed his eyes at some point to try to block out the blinding light surrounding him. That’s probably why he doesn’t hear Ron again until he’s much closer to Harry than is considered safe.
“I doubt our encounters would be as interesting otherwise,” Harry says. “So, why are you letting me go?”
“Hmm, I see.” Alpha Bee’s face softens from the radiant look it sported a few moments ago. “Then I suggest you head off and do that.”
He lowers his voice when he realises he’s started shouting and drops his hand when he notices it pointing accusingly at Potter. “Anything to
“Nah. He’ll figure that out when you show up. Plus, if it is a trap, he’ll at least be uncertain about whether you’re actually coming.”
If the investigators are just now getting around to sweeping the flats, Harry finds it unlikely that they would've checked outside first. While plenty of clues probably exist directly at the crime scene, other hints are as likely to be just outside of it, considering the culprit had to flee somewhere.
In Harry’s case, he heads off to find Ron and Hermione. He’s got a lot on his mind after talking to Finch-Fletchley.
“You just said it’s been awhile since you’ve used your powers without your costume. You expect us to believe you have ‘em suddenly under control?”
Harry doesn’t know how to begin to explain this morning’s exchange to Dracon but finds that a large part of him wants to try.
“Er . . . Sorry about that.” He takes a breath and, as he slowly releases it, tries to bring the level of energy pumping through him down alongside his heartbeat. When he looks back at the sleeve, Harry feels a spark of pride at how much calmer the electrical jumps appear. “First time in a while I’ve been powered up without my hero suit.”
Patches of what Harry assumes must be skin peek out from multiple tears throughout the costume, noticeable from this distance only for the sharp pale contrast they provide to the surrounding darkness. His long, black trench coat fans out under him like a cape. Little white shreds decorate the ground where any of Paper Dracon’s numerous pockets have also torn.
Draco had the same idea because he rose above the trees moments later, a scowl reminiscent of their school days twisting the joy off his face.
She doesn’t take his hand, so Harry lets it swing back down by his side. Together they walk out into the corridor where Harry hands her the note.
The policeman with Harry darts him an accusatory glance, but Harry ignores it. His powers had detected the electrical currents present around the bodies of people still alive. With the smoke being as thick as it was and dead bodies producing no energy output, there was no way for Harry to have known more people were inside. Maybe if he’d only argued with the boat lady from earlier for five seconds instead of five minutes . . . .
“Er . . . . I mean, when you say it like that, it sounds kind of stupid. But, you see, my aunt and uncle weren’t . . . great people—to me—even though they raised me. Excellent to their wanker of a son, though. I have a feeling they never really got over my mum marrying my dad.”
Harry opens his mouth to retort when he suddenly finds he can’t breathe right. It’s as if his heart is being squeezed inside his chest, and he feels cold, oh so cold.
“Well, I’m awake. Great bloody job.” He scrambles to his feet, his back to Harry. “Now go home, hero.”
Taking that as all the invitation he’ll get, Draco boldly climbs fully into the attic, his head nearly brushing the ceiling when he stands at his full height.
holding that over my head that I took that threat off the table myself.” The stiff way the villain holds his shoulders tells Harry that decision had been less simple than that.
“Yes, why, Malfoy? And don’t feed me any bullshit about doing your job because we both know this is way beyond what your job calls on you to do—unless you make these kind of holiday house calls with your other clients?”
“Yup.” The officer rocks on his feet. “Best to not keep wasting your time here. Or do. Doesn’t matter to me. But know you’re not getting in to see those patients.”
Harry dashes inside the shed and takes shelter behind a stack of crates yet to be loaded. He peers around the corner of one and is suddenly mask to mask with one of the black-clad figures. When the man starts to let out a warning shout, Harry shoves his hand on the henchman’s chest and twists it into the fabric before sending an electric jolt stolen from his watch through the man, knocking him out. The grip he has on the unconscious man prevents him from crashing to the floor and alerting the others to the spy in their midst. Harry pulls him into his hiding place and props him up against the crates.
Once inside, chaos erupts. Everyone—all the Weasleys and Potter’s two best friends—try to swarm him, however Mrs. Weasley plants herself between them and Potter. It’s tense; unspoken grievances linger in the air. But gradually, as conversation carries on, the tension fades.
Three weeks into the manhunt, Narcissa Malfoy returned to England from whatever hidey-hole she’d snuck off to when Voldemort’s reign fell apart. Aurors had to escort her raving form from Ministry premises, calling out for her son. Evidently, the Aurors couldn’t turn over Draco’s remains for family burial rites because they were needed for the upcoming case against his murderers once they were caught and taken into custody.
While Mad-Eye hadn’t been serious with his declaration, it gives Harry an idea. He looks back to Alpha Bee hopefully, and the old hero scans Harry’s masked face with his eyes before assenting and handing Harry the key. Relieved, Harry roots in the drawer by the door and nabs the deck of cards he’d used the last time he spoke to Blaizing Fire.
While Harry hadn’t liked Malfoy when he was alive, this version of Malfoy unsettled him too much for him to pin down any single emotion. So instead he said, “That explains the baby peacocks, then. I remember seeing grown ones stalking your yard.”
“—and, yes. I do expect you to burn it once you’re finished here with the traitor.” He tugs a key out of his pocket and tosses it at Harry who catches it out of reflex. “Be sure to lock up when you’re done here. Do well, and I might take you off your probation.” Then he gives a chilling smirk in Paper Dracon’s direction before grabbing Prancing Peacock by the back of his costume and dragging him out.
As Mr. Hendricks gives his lips an unimpressed lick, the Auror maintaining the atmospheric spell says, “How about you walk us through one of your—incidents.”
Draco holds his hand out to Potter, palm up. “That said, I’d appreciate it if you stayed. I honestly don’t know what I’d do here otherwise.”
“Why not?” Tonks reaches a hand across the desk as though to grab Harry’s, but he doesn’t respond to her movements. “Don’t you trust us to watch out for anyone bad coming in? No one’s going to try to hurt you here.”
Harry got his head injury wrapped, and he had been told he does have a slight concussion. Which is great. Just fine. He still has to wait for the main bulk of the other patients to be treated, though, before Poppy plans to handle his less pressing injury.
It was that last line of thought that led Harry to his current solution—dress to impress, tuxedo-style.
“I say we knock this smart-arse around some more until he tells us what we want to know,” the small villain says.
“Well, er, I guess what I’m trying to say is that it was really . . . nice. Having someone look out for you. Or, well, to be included in the group being look out for, rather . . . .”
He walks over to Potter who’s fumbling with his own wand. “Here.” Draco holds out the handle of his wand to Potter, his fingers near the tip. “The spells should hold on their own for at least a little while.”
By the time Potter returns from the loo, Draco’s finished up with the witness and is waiting by the front door. Potter meets him there, redressed in his head coverings. He glances back toward Ms. Adams, whose legs are now stretched the length of the couch rather than curled against her chest.
When it’s Harry’s turn to go, the two heroes aiding him release Harry's arms. He still sways on his feet, but he doesn’t fall. A part of him says that he should be one of the last ones out considering this is his rescue mission to see through; however, another part argues to go now, since Paper Dracon already went and is out there. Plus, from the looks of it, the heroine that took charge of the group seems set to be the last one out. He can respect that.
As it appears Tracey is struggling to decide if she can answer, Harry takes it off her hands. “I’ll assume that’s a ‘yes, but I can’t say.’” At her nod, he continues, “Why did they steal the boat?”
Somehow, by the end of it, Harry’s hands have tangled in Draco’s blond locks, and Draco has Harry pinned against the safety rail of the balcony with one of Harry’s legs wrapped around his waist. When they part, both are panting.
Mouth suddenly dry, Harry wonders if he should be more careful when dealing with his first “proper” villain encounter.
As they run, Harry starts sending his electricity through his system, and he feels the added boost to his legs and the added tug on his hair from the wind as it stands on end. Once powered up—and he can feel the sparks along his throat—Harry shouts to Ron, “What do you think’s—?”
Harry feels a flash of guilt but tamps it down. “Well, if you know an ally has an issue with it, you don’t do it without their permission, which is probably more important than always having it ‘work out.’”
Fire doesn’t move. Instead, he provides Harry with that annoying sensation again of being measured for all he’s worth. “Strip Poker, huh?”
Together, the three of them Apparated to the gates and snuck into Malfoy Manor like they were precocious twelve-year olds again up to a spot of mischief. They chose the ballroom with tall windows overlooking the grounds and with furniture draped in white cloth as if affirming the manor was now a home only for ghosts. With care, Hermione selected the comfiest chaise lounge of the lot and, with Ron’s assistance, levitated it over to the windows.
moves to even out the spread from Harry’s wrinkling. “Hmm . . . . You should have been thinking that way before you decided to mess with it.” She pauses a moment. “That said, it isn’t ruined completely. Just in more pieces than when it arrived. Though, it might have some water damage from Cho’s attack.”
But that’s not all that Hermione’s page of words has provided. Little jolts of electricity jump through the moisturized air, easy enough for Harry to just reach out and grab hold of them with his power should he have the need. He feels his tensed shoulders relax at not having to expend much more energy from his own body.
Facing back toward the stairway, he swallows back the tears that threaten to fall and compromise the visibility of his lenses.
Right. He’s dressed as a Supervillain now. Not an unmasked civilian. Of course the captured Superheroes would be distressed to see him. As much as he’d like to reassure all the prisoners that they don’t have to fear him, he’s all too aware there may be listening devices planted along the walls—perhaps the other reason for Fire speaking so vaguely to him and having Harry continue to write his words down. Additionally, it’s too dark in here for them to see any note he’d write . . . .
Once she’s beside him, Harry leans up to her ear and whispers, “Superhero Izulu reporting for duty. Can’t stay around to help out. I’ve got another person to set free.”
“Right.” His tongue feels like sandpaper against the roof of his mouth. “Would—Do you have any of Kevin’s Villain Agency items? Like, hideout locations, perhaps?”
Two of the villains collapse while the third falls to his knees. The light from the blazing building starts to dim as the rain finally hits, creating giant puffs of black smoke that rise and cover the surrounding area.
Latching onto the fabric covering Paper Dracon’s chest, Harry pins him to the alley wall, their masks nearly touching. “I know exactly who I’m talking to. Someone who has information we need to prevent unnecessary deaths.”
was showing you young heroes the new piece of evidence dropped off by detectives in an ongoing investigation. While you were all supposed to analyze it in due time, you,
“Anyway, I think the other hint is that his injuries were still untreated and his outfit unmended the next time we saw him almost a week later.”
Potter looks down and notices his hand still bunched in the fabric of Draco’s robes. A sheepish look steals across his face, and he smooths the hand out but doesn’t remove it. The hand settles against Draco’s chest, over his heart. “I don’t—I don’t know. Certainly not like—not like Mr. Hendricks.”
“Probably until the explosion happened. I think the masked figure fighting the robot caused it to explode somehow.”
He doesn’t know what to say that, really. He’s hardly had to deal with this kind of pain himself. Yet as he thinks on it, Harry knows he would readily die for Ron and Hermione—as they would for him. The mixture of love and despair that blooms in his chest at the thought is nearly enough to crush him. “But you’d have died for him, right?”
The suspect stares at the chains wrapped around him, bewilderment crossing his features. “Why, what in Merlin’s name is going on, Aurors?” His voice is surprisingly soft coming from a man who looks like he could bench-press a troll. “Surely you don’t mean to imply that someone identified
“Local secondary school Superhero. And the London public—though some might say the Hero Order would be more accur—”
Potter chuckles darkly and leans back against the wall. “You’d think. That’s what I thought too. But when I was alone after walking out, thinking I needed to collect myself... I just didn’t—need to. I thought the tears wanted to come then, but even after hearing their stories, their experiences, they still didn’t. And, Merlin, I remember standing in Ms. Adams’ loo with dry eyes and an empty reflection wondering if my compassion had dried up.” His gaze turns to the ceiling. “What if that vampire sucked more out of me than just my blood?”
“Nice meeting you.” Potter gives a half-wave that he aborts partway through. Then he turns back to Draco. “All set, then?”
“Why would an attack on an empty home be intimidating to us? Yeah, it’s unsettling that the Agency knows where a good number of our older heroes live, but that just means updating security or staying here at headquarters until this situation gets handled.”
Alpha Bee says, “It was what they had found in the rubble in the affected flats. While there is the possibility that it belongs to one of the flat owners, the complexity and damage it’s sustained suggests it had a part to play in the attack that night.”
A sudden thought stills his hands as he nears the top of the break. “That night, when I found you just off of North Circular Road—” the leg tenses beneath his hands “—did you happen to fall off your swan after running away from me?”
By the time it reaches the squabbling pair, the paper bird is easily the size of the boy. It goes to tackle the girl, but the boy shoves her out of its path.
Harry brings his right arm before his face and is surprised to see the level of electricity skittering along the sleeve, almost a meter away from the actual fabric. He’d forgotten what it’s like to be powered up without his costume on; without its assistance containing the electricity, Harry couldn’t afford to be unaware of the energy flowing off him.
As Harry crawls to the stairs, trying to remember if he saw a lift anywhere when running around the building earlier, he realizes Dracon really did let him go.
“Oh, no you don’t,” Harry yelled and propelled himself forward. At this rate, their game would be over soon, with Draco making snatching grabs at the Snitch already.
When Harry doesn’t, Draco brushes his lips against the mask. Then he pulls away and rushes from the room.
have no choice but to use his powers, revealing himself to be the Superhero Izulu, he’d prefer for the villains to not recognize his real voice after the fact. So, in the event that he gets accosted by anyone, Harry has a Plan.
Mr. Dawkins lives in a rented flat above Flourish and Blotts, a place accessible without having to go through the shop. The windows on the door and the side of the building remain covered with curtains that do not stir as Draco’s fist meets the wood.
For Harry’s part, his time has been eaten up by school, picking up the slack in other patrol areas while Kensington gets top priority, and attending funerals of fallen heroes.
“Again, those pesky friends you’ve been ignoring finally realised they might not be enough to handle this... situation on their own.”
“Come on. We have to get out of here. It’ll only get worse the longer we stay.” Dracon takes a step forward and stumbles.
Approaching the swearing villain, Harry cautiously lays a hand against his arm. “I don’t know what’s going through your head, but what happened is probably not what you’re—”
Harry takes a breath that feels more watery than it should be and nods his head. “Yeah. I’d-I’d appreciate that.”
“Besides, I have something special I’ve been saving up for ages.” He pats the pocket over top his heart.
Walking over to Dracon, who is bent over with hands on his knees, Harry pats him on the back and quietly thanks him for his help. The two of them speculate on who should go over and check for a pulse. As much as they wanted to defeat Voldemort, they hadn’t aimed to kill him. The high voltage but low current rate throughout the bird declared as much.
“Yeah.” The hollowness in Dracon’s voice freezes the blood in Harry’s veins. “What’re dreams to villains are nightmares for everyone else.”
Still, the rush of power he feels makes his toes curl. He could probably power that paper bird forever now.
He feels a flash of irritation at the villain’s odd behavior. Perhaps that’s why he’s a bit more forceful than he’d intended with the next bit. “
“Convenient, isn’t it? Having an obvious physical marker of guilt. Most evil doesn’t even show on a person until they are in the act of committing it, and, after, it submerges itself again.”
“Hang on.” Hermione’s nose scrunches as she thinks. “Harry, didn’t you say you found him unconscious?”
The door opens on the third knock, revealing a portly man around Ms. Adams’ height. Sweat decorates his face and mats his black hair to his forehead. “Oh. You’re here.” He blinks at Draco and Potter as though doubting his eyesight. “Come inside, then.”
If Harry squints, he can sort of make out what appears to be two figures on the roof. As he strategizes how to dodge the incoming attack from the horse and the flock of flying demons, he nudges Ron. “The roof!”
“You have a problem with bringing him in for interrogation, but no problem with knocking him out to tend to his injuries?”
“Do we know it’s the Villain Agency, though? That’s doing all the attacks, I mean?” Ron nibbles at his thumb nail. “Like, they could just be selling the information on the heroes to the highest bidder and that’s why it’s taken so long for these attacks to come.”
“Yeah? Well best of luck to him,” Mad-Eye says. “At this rate, we might as well let the little blighter go, for all the help he’s been.” He kicks at a loose chair.
Harry’s not watching Ron, and the horse keeps heading towards them, Harry’s attack too weak to cause harm.
And, true to his word, Malfoy did. For three months, Draco Malfoy made it his afterlife’s mission to annoy, agitate, and harass Harry in the sanctity of his own home. Harry would be trimming the petunias he was growing on the terrace ledge and nearly drop the shears on the unsuspecting crowd below because a ghostly chill followed a ghostly hand along his back. Harry would be peacefully showering, and Malfoy’s head would pop out of the wall to ask if the water was warm enough, his mere presence causing the temperature to turn frigid. Harry would prepare a plate of food for himself, and Malfoy would run his open mouth through it, telling Harry his “cooking was shite” and leaving the meal mould-encrusted. After a while, Harry stopped throwing out the moulding food, and instead cast a good
Draco spares a moment to feel grateful for his mother’s connection to this family; undoubtedly this part of his task would have been more difficult otherwise. Once inside, Draco shucks his cloak onto the coat-rack by the door. “Where can I find—”
For a minute, Mr. Park’s hands clenched into fists on the table before they relaxed entirely. “We—we had a lot of garlic bread at the restaurant. When... When I was shoved into that alcove, I could... I could smell it on my d-date’s breath as those
“So after that, the machine followed after him. I remember its outstretched arm touching the beam of light, reaching out towards the figure. Very skeletal and creepy-looking, too.”
“Ah, but that’s where I got her, Ron.” Harry briefly paused in his job as Professional Pacer and Fretter. “Once the question was asked, Hermione
When Potter reaches out and grasps Draco’s wand, the lack of contact between their hands is much more noticeable, less excusable than with the sunglasses.
When the three heroes exit the building, they come face to face with multiple police units, some ambulances, and
Alpha Bee says, “Hold onto it, of course. Westminster has already proven unsafe for this type of information. And especially until we know why the villains had risked so much to steal it.”
Draco looked up at Harry, some of the hairline fractures reappearing along his face. “What if I don’t want to be?”
Yeah, he knows how breathtaking the whole sight is the first time around. After all, he first managed the full effect in front of a full-body mirror a week before his fourteenth birthday. Yet, Harry can only imagine the effect of seeing it in muted darkness.
Something snaps in Draco then—likely his restraint—and his head lunges forward. A whine tears through his throat as his lips crash against Harry’s.
Dracon’s fingers twitch in Harry’s grip. “It—You don’t know what they’re doing to those heroes. And I—I can’t—”
“I-I better go after her. Let her know I didn’t mean anything by it.” Harry has to wait a minute before his hands stay steady enough to grasp the door handle.
“—and she said that maybe Paper Dracon as a person hasn’t really changed. Rather how you saw him. Like, for the most part, you’ve just viewed him as another enemy. But the night you found him in that ditch badly injured, you started empathizing with him. And because of that, you changed how you behaved towards him, which in turn, has changed what side of himself he shows you.”
They throw open the double doors with ease—as pushing on them causes them to collapse inward. Stepping inside, they see almost all the house’s walls and floors have been leveled. Most of the roof has either caved in or been blown off.
Harry winces. He really should stop holding important conversations when beaten and knackered out of his mind. “Not the best choice of words, I admit. I just meant why would you come to an intense fight knowing your powers would be—uh—disadvantaged in this weather?”
“Please,” Malfoy scoffed. “Stop acting as if you have any power over this situation. Now sod off; your bitching is ruining the mood.”
A hissing sound comes from Harry as he rushes to obscure his view again. He can hear Blaizing Fire laugh. Suddenly, he feels the clothing hit against him as Fire evidently tosses the articles Harry’s way.
Harry opens his mouth to speak, but, finally, self-preservation awakens within him. Is he really willing to risk revealing to so many people what Izulu really sounds like? Cutting off his words, nothing but a wheezy gust of air comes out. All right then. Should he power now? His muscles ache at the thought.
The sensation of being analyzed is back, but now it feels like one scanning for weakness. In a hospital gown and with his body aching all over, Harry’s never felt weaker in his life. Not even during some of the more intense villain confrontations. But damned if he’ll appear vulnerable in this moment. He tilts his head up and juts out his chin to meet the challenge.
“I'd been incautious—reckless in my behavior and ignorant to the consequences.” Despite her attempts to approach the subject from a subjective, analytical standpoint, emotion still creeps into her voice. “Riding high on a successful early career with my partner, I felt like nothing—no obstacle, no villain—could stop either of us. We were soaring high above all expectations. So, when—
The two of them circled around the treetops on different ends of the Manor gardens, hawks hunting any halos of light from the heather below.
Bursting into tears, Mrs. Weasley gestures both Draco and Harry toward The Burrow, and she makes several aborted attempts to hug Potter along the way but remembers and pulls herself back each time.
It also feels good to know that his plan to keep the other heroes safe has mostly worked so far. Only one attack has occurred since the implementation of the schedule shift, but the ambushed hero had been able to fight the attackers off. That had been thanks to an additional idea set forth by Mad-Eye about the targeted heroes pairing up and sleeping over one another’s houses to limit the possibility of a successful attack.
Her finger taps the wooden arm of her chair. “Well . . . . It’s a bit of a family secret, but since you told me who’s responsible for taking it—and I really have no fondness for the scoundrels—I suppose I could tell you a family secret. It’s made from really expensive wood.”
“Meaning you’re not here, sir,” Harry says, “if the villains have most of the older pro-heroes’ files.”
7:00 pm was the boat theft a little old lady decided to hound him about for a quarter of an hour that seemed to stretch into six. Stolen right from off her lawn. Family heirloom at that—apparently passed down several generations. She also explained to him that he “should get right on the case like any beneficial hero worth the air he breathes” would.
” Draco said coldly, enunciating his vowels. “Go back to camp. I can handle this today.” He tossed Harry’s wand at his feet, spinning on his toes and Disapparating to Harry’s ‘buts’ and pleads of ‘darling, wait.’
Prongs (named after the signature at the end) describes how they and one of their friends modified the Animagus meditation process because neither of them could manage to sit still. They describe their feelings and how they managed to achieve the necessary state of calmness, and how they succeeded in becoming Animagi despite Kinetomagical tendencies. They didn’t figure it all out alone; their parents, believed to have had experience with non-European magical practises, gave them advice on meditation techniques.
The words of your letter made its strange behaviour clearer to me. Sometimes when a witch or a wizard has an emotionally charged interaction with an item, the item absorbs a piece of their magic and being. It is usually too weak to be perceived by anyone who does not have a strong connection to you - unless the witch or wizard who sent it are as powerful as you.
Draco grinned. “Yes it could,” he agreed. “We need proof, but that can wait. They’ll be months in the lab and presentations and theses--”
Draco bathed while Harry ate, and then vice-versa. It maximized the amount of time they got to spend talking. When Harry stepped out from behind the cubicle, towel slung low on his hips and biceps flexing as he ran his hands through the dripping curls at the nape of his neck, Draco nearly passed out.
The first item was a glistening carton of buttered popcorn, a box of off-brand Mike-and-Ike, and a coke, complete with a paper cup and straw. Draco hated movie theater snacks. Heck, he even hated movie theatres-- they were loud and overwhelming, and tended to make his head spin and his sleep suffer. This particular plate of movie theatres snacks, however, made his mouth water eagerly. He was just so damn hungry.
Three members of the opposite tribe had also pulled green, and Draco assessed the young woman and two middle-aged men shrewdly as they shuffled to stand shoulder to shoulder. The girl was the Mississippi-beauty-queen he had deemed spoiled and vapid on first impression, but she smiled brightly at Draco, and he grinned right back. The elder of the men stood protectively at her shoulder, holding himself with a gentle sturdiness, thick salt-and-pepper stubble tickling his kind expression.
“I can win against you, too. Besides, I’d rather lose than let her get one vote.” Draco let the familiar posh flavour of indignation colour his vowels.
“Contestants, let’s get started. This game has three core principles: Outwit, Outlast, and Outplay. Outwit is the social portion of the game, the relationships you make and the values you stand on. Outlast is your tenacity, your ability to make the choices that put you in the best position. It is your refusal to give up. Outplay is your overall understanding of Survivor and whether you were able to show true mastry to get you to this point. You’ve done the hard part, now it’s time to fill the Jury in. Claire, let’s start with you; tell us why you think you deserve their vote for the winner of Survivor Wa’ab?”
Draco licks broad stripes across his hole, coaxing his cock with a loose, warm fist, gentle but sure. Sweat beads in the defined hollows on Harry’s lower back, catching the light as he rocks his hips off-rhythm to his moans. Draco sucks, soft at first, but then strong and pulsing, his laps becoming faster and deeper. His chin is slick with saliva, and the backdrop of colorful plastic holds and the hum of a fan blur until all he can see-- all he can hear-- is Harry.
Harry gladly handed over the tank, giving the squat brown toad one last suspicious look. “Can’t wait.”
“If we didn’t do something, one of us – probably me – would have been seriously hurt,” Harry replied. “I know I had a weird feeling about him right from the start, but I didn’t think he’d actually try and hurt one of us.”
“Well, you’re kind of biased,” Harry muttered. “Anyways, I like her. She’s got spunk. And she’s not stupid.”
Grabbing the pale skeletal branches that rose from the water, he climbed gingerly onto the dead tree, placing one foot in front of the other and making sure to avoid stepping on places where time or moss had polished the wood to a slip-n-slide. He inched upwards, swinging his knees on either side and locking his ankles behind him when the angle got too steep to walk. Using his hands to leverage himself, he worked his way into the crevice where the two trunks met.
He told Harry such as they traipsed through the woods, heading towards the location of a third Rai stone that they had tracked the previous evening. This one was larger, nearly eight feet in height, and stood at the center of a wide swath of ruins. The town had to have been at least 100 years abandoned, but the skeletons of palm-thatched huts remained as obscure lumps in the undergrowth. Draco got the uneasy feeling that he was intruding. The seemingly sudden dereliction of the village struck him as off.
. Can’t you see?” Harry’s eyes sting, and the rain on his face begins to taste like salt. He wants his mother. He wants his friends. The Stone’s siren call is sawdust in his ears.
He doesn’t quite know how he is able to drag himself up from the dirt, dizzy with exhaustion and teeth chattering, but Harry’s laughter, clear as ever, greets Draco when he stumbles into the living room.
“Did it rub off on you?” Harry asks. He thinks he knows what Malfoy’s answer will be. He knows he thinks the opposite.
He dresses quickly in the white shirt and jeans he keeps in Harry’s bottom drawer, slipping through his floo to a cacophony of hammers and whining machinery. Stopping in the guest bath to check his neck for visible hickies, he bustles towards the back porch,
The post-coital bliss was short-lived, as the rain had begun to fall in heavy droplets. Forgoing an Impervious Charm, Draco took Harry’s hand and apparated them back within a few hundred feet of the water well. Unable to risk being away from camp for any more time, especially in such unpleasant weather, they trudged back to camp, deciding that sleep would likely be hard to come by and that, with everyone up, they wouldn’t be tracking any Rai stones for at least another day. Their trip was not going as planned, but it turned out it wasn’t shaping up to be all that bad either.
Survivor unfolded with a cyclical cadence-- Reward, Immunity, Tribal, repeat-- but Draco felt one step behind, the next twist just outside of expectation’s reach. His brain was
I am able to live mostly self-sufficient, cooking and cleaning for myself. Often, I can do other non-magical activities as well. On good days, I feel almost invincible, a manic magical charge running through me that makes me feel like I can accomplish any spell or physical feat. On bad days, however, I am barely able to function.
P.S. Excuse these random chicken-scratch notes on the back of the letter. It’s been a few hours and I totally forgot to add something. You mentioned living with your mother-- please let me know how she is. Tell her hello from me, as well.
“Between us, there was no definitive leader or ulterior goal. We had genuine friendship and respect for each other, and we used our compatibility to symbiotically move each other forward. It is rare in Survivor to see a player who can learn to trust others without becoming complacent, and I feel the two of us managed to achieve that.
You are lying in bed, looking gorgeous, and I’m so happy I can’t sleep. I want to dance, I want to shout my happiness from the rooftops. I’ve never in my life been so happy, not even when I was a child and got my first broom! They say most people are never again as happy as in childhood, but you gave me a happiness that is so much more than anything I have ever felt.
Potter sighed. “Was there not any other way we could have traveled to Micronesia? We had to do this stupid gameshow thing? I think I’ve seen some pretty nice resort ads in the
Draco, though, was also sad to see the camp go. He had grown rather soft in his ripe age, and he hated divisive endings. It came from the fact that he, after so many years, could finally say he was blissfully, disgustingly, sustainably happy.
Malfoy sighs deep in his chest. The sharp points of his shoulders deflate from the shape of a boy to the shape of bones. “I get it.”
Draco’s movements were jerky and scattered, his lips slightly parted and teeth clenched so tightly the corner of his jaw twinged. There was no way he was going to make it much longer. Fortunately, Marissa seemed to be in the same boat. She made a narrow save, barely managing to swoop in and right one of her balls after she dropped it into the chute slightly off-center.
Draco didn’t have much time to explore upon arriving at the new beach, but from his short tour of the well and the fire-pit, he considered it dreadful. Much was the same as their old camp, but he couldn’t help thinking that the cot here was lumpier and the sea murkier.
On that note, I thank you for making me aware of the magical force with which the letter entered your office. Desdemona, my owl, has been limping recently, and I could not for the life of me figure out where she had hurt herself. I feel truly terrible. I will have to bring her back into the clinic to let them know. If this message arrives a few days late, know that is why.
“I’ll file that away for future reference,” Draco smirked at him over his shoulder, an eyebrow lifted. “And let it be known that I don’t hate being called sir, either.”
“Um… hi,” Harry muttered, looking flabbergasted, both eyebrows lifting high and a hand twisting through his hair.
“No bells,” he replied, immediately batting Harry’s hand away. Those hands were dangerous. “Never bells.”
Harry was missing a piece of the puzzle, but he could feel it begin to creep up his spine like an icy wind.
“He should’ve taken me at my word,” Harry growled. “He should’ve trusted me, and he didn’t. That’s what hurts me so much.”
Draco hesitated for a moment, vaguely recalling their agreement not to cross any lines last night. He would never violate Harry’s trust by pressuring him into something they’d already decided not to do, and yet… his hand was under Harry’s t-shirt, and they were sharing a pillow, and Harry was hard. They were
“Nothing is wrong,” Harry said, his eyes finally refocusing and turning to Draco. “Really. Just a tipsy melancholy. Or… a melancholy tipsy?”
“No! Let me throw the damn pillow at you, Potter!” He picked up his last pillow from the couch and clutched it madly in one hand.
It wasn’t long before Harry’s breathing turned into erratic panting, and Draco felt himself shiver when he heard Harry moan, “I’m gonna come... Draco...”
Harry knew, given the precariousness of the moment, that he should’ve given it some thought first, but all he could say was, “You’re as smooth as silk.”
Andrea was eying him suspiciously, both Gareth and Ramesh were glaring at him, and Draco wasn’t looking at him at all.
“Ron never has tea in the evenings, and if he does, he’ll just steal some of Hermione’s,” Harry said. “Oi, grab the sugar. By the fridge, blue bowl.”
“I guess if my hair gives me away so easily, I should consider a hat next time I leave the house,” Potter said.
Once his hair was no longer dripping wet, he flung his towel haphazardly over the bed post, shot a quick drying spell at it, and stared at Harry again. He couldn’t fully grasp the fact that Harry was here, in his bed, in his space. His head told him that it was all so incredibly bizarre, but in his heart, it didn’t feel bizarre at all. Draco almost felt as if Harry’s presence had been long overdue, as if he should have been sleeping in Draco’s bed all along, since the beginning of time.
Draco sighed as well, disappointed for Harry’s sake. Was the whole world always going to be half for them and half against them? Never mind half; if not even their nearest and dearest could support them, how was anyone else ever going to approve?
“You’re as full of shit as ever, Potter,” Draco told him as he stood up, a warm affection blooming deep in his chest. When Harry smiled at him, nothing felt wrong.
He slowly pulled his gaze off of Harry’s face and ambled toward the fireplace, stepping in carefully. He thought he could feel Harry’s eyes on him, but he was certain he must be imagining it.
Harry released a long-drawn-out groan and stood up, dramatically lifting his arms up high as if cursing the heavens.
“Rest assured, we’ve put extra security measures in place so that if he does turn up at Prophet headquarters, we’ll know about it.”
“Oh,” Draco said softly. “I’d gathered you weren’t fond of her, but your face says that’s an understatement.”
Groaning, Draco immediately splashed his face and brushed his teeth. He paused for a moment, debating whether or not he should leave the love bites on his neck, not only as physical evidence of the night before, but also just to see how Harry would react. The thought made him giggle.
“You’re having tea, not your usual butterbeer,” Harry pointed out, fancying himself very wise in his hazy state of consciousness. “And Ron’s been even handsier than usual all evening.”
In his gut, he knew he was stalling because he was convinced that his presence wouldn’t be welcome, and it made him anxious. But he was determined to do this, and finally, just before two, he cast a glamor charm on himself and apparated to Diagon Alley.
of him. He wondered how likely it was that he would even see Harry again after tonight, and he felt a little sad about the slim odds. What would be the harm in agreeing to this now, if that was the case?
“Yes, I felt as if the moment called for it,” Draco said, chiding himself for continually letting these rather telling comments fly from his mouth without a moment’s hesitation. Speaking before thinking was decidedly abnormal for him, but it seemed impossible to control it around Harry.
Harry threw his head back as he burst out laughing. Draco unconsciously leaned forward as he watched Harry’s unbridled laughter, feeling like he had just conquered some hitherto uncharted territory. When Harry laughed… fuck, Draco wanted nothing else but to be near him.
“...and I know I don’t deserve you, Harry, I know I’m insufferable and high maintenance and moody, but please don’t do this… please don’t leave me.”
He kicked off without warning, shooting high into the air, and Draco wasted no time following suit. In seconds, he was chasing close after Potter, the wind beating against his face, and he could’ve sworn they were right back in second year.
“Do forgive the hitting,” Hermione said with a sigh. “She’s all about hammering objects on people these days. Luckily, we’ve not reached the stage where she’s running about yet, getting into everything; she still loves being held. And at least you’re only getting hit with Oscar; I got a sippy cup to the temple this morning.”
“Because of Harry,” Draco answered simply. “I’m sure you and I will be thrown together on more than one occasion in the future. You two are best mates, after all.”
“Ask away,” Harry responded, trying his best not to sound scared. He stroked his stubbled chin and watched the way Draco tapped his quill against his lip.
“Two years. I write under a different name,” he explained patiently, his voice still much stiffer than Harry was used to, and even more posh. It was maybe (definitely) just a wee bit sexy. “And I’m essentially support staff, anyway.”
“I’ve often wondered how on earth you can presume to call me the arrogant one, Potter.” Draco smiled.
going with Harry. His life was so much a part of Ron’s and mine from the time we were children that it would’ve felt wrong to desert him when he needed us the most. Like cutting off a limb, or something.”
Hermione tucked a loose lock of hair behind her ears as Ron started to assist their daughter with her dinner. “Lord, is anyone else completely famished?”
Draco automatically looked down at his smart black trousers, grey blazer and fitted white dress shirt, but everything appeared to be in order.
“I told them,” Harry muttered, without segue, against his forehead. “I told Ron and Hermione that we’re together.”
“Anyway, don’t worry,” she said, buttoning her jacket. “Surprisingly, there’s nothing in the rule book about banging the subject of your interview. As long as it doesn’t interfere with the piece, you go right ahead and take him to the bone yard.”
“I suggest you cease questioning my vocabulary before you embarrass yourself, Potter,” Draco huffed.
She took a long sip of her tea, and Draco observed her for a moment: plaid throw blanket twisted snugly around her and Rose, bushy hair pulled back into a loose ponytail, contented smile on her face. This woman was the very picture of peace, and suddenly, the idea that he had ever hurled a single bad word at her (let alone everything else he’d done) made him want to vomit.
Harry didn’t turn around from the stove, so Draco gently wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and kissed his shoulder, waiting for Harry to speak.
After a moment, Draco pulled his slippery hand away from Harry’s and moved it back beneath the bedsheet.
In the end, he puttered around his garden for a long while, watering all the flowers and checking the progress of his sweet peas in particular; yes, they were finally starting to climb up the trellis. Vaguely Draco wondered if he should plant lilies next year; he thought Harry would like that.
“Well, the weather has been rather lovely. Rather less rain than we’re used to in the spring months, I’d say.”
Draco studied him for a moment as he shuffled his way around the kitchen, flicking his wand and busying himself with his cooking.
“And yet you had no idea I was bisexual,” he said, grinning despite himself. “Somehow that one slipped under your radar.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered, immediately clutching his arms and rubbing them in a feeble attempt to calm him down. “Harry. You were dreaming. You’re okay. You’re okay.”
Harry let out a surprised huff of breath, but he quickly divested himself of his white t-shirt and hurriedly unzipped his fitted black jeans.
Draco had looked over and recoiled; red eyes peered back at him, a menacing smile creeping onto the face that Draco would never forget: Lord Voldemort.
The way Potter looked at him… it made Draco feel as if he was about to cry, and he hated the feeling. But at the same time, he felt oddly alright with being vulnerable around Harry, though he couldn’t say why.
Harry didn’t know how those last three words had slipped out, and he wasn’t convinced they were entirely accurate: if there was one thing he struggled with, it was trust. But then, this was Malfoy, and Malfoy was always Harry’s exception.
“Alright if I go fly for a bit, then?” Harry asked him a few seconds later, as if it was his duty to ask. As if Draco was his primary concern.
Draco graced him with a tiny, hopeful smile. “Well… As I said, no pressure. Nonetheless, I would like to tell you, before the liquor buzz runs out, that I’ve had a spectacularly horrible few months, but talking to you, for however short a time, has made me forget it entirely. So, thank you for the momentary reprieve.”
“I love you,” Draco whispered back, the intensity of Harry’s emotions nearly driving him to tears himself. “Three times.”
Hermione studied him for a moment; she was wearing one of her deep-thought faces, and they always made him nervous.
“Great minds, and whatnot,” Harry said, watching absentmindedly as Draco picked up his portfolio and self-writing quill.
After spending several hours getting lost amongst the teetering shelves of books in Flourish and Blotts, Draco left the store and saw that the rain had finally let up. He wandered the street and ended up buying an owl treat for both Ariadne and Artemis, his parents’ owl; a bottle of ink for his quill; some of his favorite skincare potion; and a tube of broom polish for Harry. The shopping trip had successfully chased away the gloom of the morning’s nightmare; now he had only to contend with the anxiety of having to tell his parents he was dating Harry bloody Potter. In truth, Draco was terrified.
Harry swallowed. “Can we please try this again? I don’t want you to get in trouble for missing a day’s work or something. And I… well, I still feel bad.”
Harry leaned back and folded his arms across his chest, contentedly listening to their easy banter for a moment. His two favorite people, two sides of the same coin. Not for the first time, Harry wondered where he fit in that equation now.
“Look,” Hermione interjected, “neither of you owe us any explanations. Whatever this is, it’s for you two to sort out for yourselves. But Ron is right. Harry has dealt with more than enough as it is… just don’t hurt him, Draco.”
Draco peered at him in silence for a few seconds. “Well… I know it’s still a bit early, but suddenly I don’t feel much like being here. Can we--”
Draco scoffed, secretly overjoyed and simultaneously fucking terrified. They were rapidly venturing into territory that they couldn’t come back from.
“Lots of things,” Harry said evasively, setting the teacup down on the countertop as he shed his robes and kicked off his boots.
Harry set the beer on the coffee table slowly, somehow (purposely?) grazing his arm a second time over Draco’s knee, and still maintained eye contact.
Now it was Draco’s turn to laugh. “Would you sod off? I’m trying to pay you another compliment, you infuriating arse, and a better one than usual.”
“So, how did I do?” Harry asked him, his voice unexpectedly shy, handing him back the tea cup. Perhaps he was thinking about fingers as well.
“Like this,” Harry breathed out, gripping Draco’s thighs. “You’re in control this way. You can stop if you want, okay?"
“She doesn’t mind,” he continued. “Well, she might’ve been a little exasperated with me, but that’s normal, isn’t it?”
It comforted Draco to know that they were at least on the same page in that department: Draco wanted to touch every inch of him that he could reach, and then kiss him until they both ran out of breath. Unable to resist another impulse, Draco touched his fingers briefly to Harry’s prickly cheek.
“I certainly couldn’t have gotten much worse,” Draco chuckled, though Harry could hear a fair bit of gloom in it. “Which apparently you already know.”
“But… but why on earth would he request David bloody McKinnon to conduct a lengthy personal profile on him? I’m not exactly our A-list reporter. I write about useless things--no offense, of course, ma’am--like shops closing down, and the new beds donated to St Mungo’s, and… and bloody wand core materials!”
He cast a quick spell at Harry which caused him to stumble back into the armchair behind him in a comfortably seated position. Harry looked up at him in surprise, but he was now grinning broadly.
He rolled his eyes once again. Harry Potter was the cutest person he’d ever met, and he loathed him for it.
“Yes, please.” Draco grinned. “I feel as if I’m right on the cusp of it, but my drunken brain cannot connect the dots. It’s quite maddening, frankly.”
“I’m sorry that you hate yourself sometimes,” Harry replied. “And I’m sorry for getting angry at you when you do. You can voice your thoughts with me, even the bad ones. I’ll tell you you’re wrong as often as I need to.”
Before Draco could respond, Harry sucked at his bottom lip. Draco let out a low moan and Harry dragged his teeth back along Draco’s cheek.
Once Harry had figured out how to work the Daily Prophet visitor’s entrance, he meandered up a tall brass staircase into the open, bright newsroom filled with a maze of cubicles. He resisted the bizarre urge to yell out “olly olly oxen free” as he sauntered through the eerily deserted office, peering into each cubicle as he went along.
-little Slytherin, I’ll let you choose,” Harry said, continuing to massage Draco’s neck as if he hadn’t just done anything unusual; and maybe he hadn’t, really. “Anything your heart desires.”
Harry narrowed his eyes at him, his filthy thoughts suddenly replaced with anxiety. “You will be nice, won’t you?”
“Besides,” Draco said, fighting to regain his equilibrium. “The scars are rather sexy, I’ve been told.”
“I would hope not, but how could I be sure?” Draco shrugged again. “My moral compass hasn’t exactly always pointed due north. I believe you’re placing a higher amount of faith in me than I would place in myself.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but he simply couldn’t contain his smile. “Well, for goodness’ sake, at least slow down a bit and let me catch up. Your four versus my seven makes me look utterly ill-mannered.”
Before the barkeep could turn around, Draco blurted out, “Fuck it, make that two firewhiskeys. Please.”
Draco couldn’t control the noises coming out of his mouth, and he didn’t want to. He wanted Harry to know how he was feeling, how mind-blowingly, over-the-top
“I should’ve told you this a while ago… I was going to tell you tonight, but… It will come up when you’re questioning me, I’m sure, but--”
Draco spent the better part of the weekend ignoring his mixed (and extremely confusing) feelings, feverishly researching everything he could find regarding Potter, and subsequently brainstorming every conceivable question for their interviews. By the time he had exhausted himself of anything and everything that the public could possibly want to know about Harry Potter, he had an entire notebook full of questions, another full of research, and a metaphorical trunkload of apprehension. He felt as if a tornado was on the horizon, and there was absolutely nothing he could do to stop it.
Draco often felt mystified at the fact that someone as wonderful as Harry could ever deign to give him the time of day, but he dare not point it out, lest Harry finally see reason and agree with him.
Draco didn’t dare speak for fear of revealing the unbridled lust in his voice; he wanted Harry to be surprised.
Draco felt a rush of pride and relief, but it quickly diminished when he realized that Harry probably wouldn’t be sitting alone in the rain in such a melancholy fashion had the news been well received.
“And you play up your poor manners just because it pleases you when I point them out,” Draco countered.
When Draco didn’t reply, Harry straightened up and turned around, two bottles of Newcastle in hand. “Dra--” he started to call, before seeing Draco there in front of him. Harry’s eyebrows lifted as he slowly closed the fridge door.
Harry snorted, amused against his will, and released Draco’s arm with one last shove. “Why won’t you let me see your notes?”
Draco rolled his eyes and pointed his wand at the closed bottom cupboard of his bookcase. The cupboard door hinged open and the album in question flew out, hovering in front of Harry for a moment before Draco sent it neatly back into its home and closed the door once again.
Draco laughed. “Don’t worry, I won’t put anything too slanderous in the feature. Teammates, remember?”
“Indeed,” Draco said, plucking up his courage and choosing to speak unguardedly. “When thanked, for instance, it’s always best to simply make a joke instead of telling the person that they are most sincerely welcome, and that said person deserves to be defended with all the Slytherin ire on earth.”
“But… it’s more than that, isn’t it?” he continued. Part of him knew he was taking a risk with these words, but he recalled them hinting at this subject not so very long ago. He didn’t care as much as he should’ve, anyway; all caution was lost in a haze of overpowering lust. “You like being dominated.”
“I was wondering if you had a spare moment to speak with me,” Draco began. “I’m sure you know what about.”
Malfoy took a prim sip of espresso, and Harry was annoyed at how well he could still pull off pretentiousness. Yes, in spite of all the minuscule changes, this was certainly the Malfoy he knew. He rolled his eyes, feeling much less nervous now.
chose.” She pulls her head away from her knees—straightening them out on the tiled roof—faces him and places a hand over her chest. “I didn’t choose for him to die for me. I didn’t even dare think either of us would die.”
“You implied it well enough.” Narcissa walked past him. “Now where did you find him—my son’s body? Point it out to me.”
Draco’s not prepared for the look Potter levels at him then; even if he had anything to say in response, that look reached out to Draco and squeezed his throat tight.
Standing as he is on the edge of the battleground, Harry debates what would be the best course of action. He wants to help, but his powers would be too erratic in all the rain. He would be much more likely to accidentally zap his fellow heroes than strike any of their enemies. The last thing he wants is to become a hindrance rather than a help in this situation.
Harry doesn’t know how to fight these robots properly, and there’s no real way to ask Dracon without giving any listening Supervillains a clearer taste of his voice. And despite his stellar performance getting off his bindings, Harry doubts Paper Dracon is in a good enough condition to fight it, either.
“No, no. Nothing like that. See, I used to work at this indie film company as their lighting expert, since I was pretty good at Control over Light.”
“Well, they’re not about to stay here. Out with you lot. I’ve already got enough ghosts to deal with.”
“I know,” he repeats as he stares up into her wide eyes. “I know how hard it is to look in a mirror and see nothing.”
Realizing what he is seeing, Harry darts his gaze away. “Put your mask back on. Please.” Out of his peripheral vision, he sees Blaizing Fire jolt and turn his face toward Harry. Resolutely, he keeps his eyes averted, counting the bricks on the far wall. Still, the image of Fire when Harry first walked in burns on the back of his eyelids every time he blinks. The shorn dark hair, the deep brown skin . . . .
. I’ve not cried once this whole time, not even during the attack,” Potter says while he sounds like he may very well cry right now. “I don’t even know if I can, anymore. I just feel—hollow. Empty. Dried up. And you saw all of them, right? This isn’t normal. Even—even that vampire that bit Ms. Adams and Mr. Park and that other victim that was too
“I’m sorry about his death too. And that you’ll both be trapped in a place that’s caused you so much pain.” At Harry’s startled look, she said, “Oh, please, Harry. You know I’m fully aware that you’re not going to leave him alone in there. Just, promise me you’ll sleep in your own bed at night and come back for the daytime?”
He sucks in his bottom lip for a moment and looks at the kitchen light swaying imperceptibly above them. His lip slides back out with a light pop. “He had lots of cuts all over him. Like someone was slicing away at him. Some larger and longer than others. I couldn’t tell how deep they were, but, by the way he struggled to move, either they or other injuries I couldn’t see were causing him distress.”
“Oh, yes! What did Justin have to say?” Hermione suddenly waves her hands before herself. “Wait, hold on. We should probably get the other heroes involved in the case—”
Draco shields a grimace. With Potter’s sickly complexion, he couldn’t pick up any usual hints of Potter’s discomfort. Who really knows besides Potter how long he’s stuck it out, being reminded of his own horrible experience?
Voldemort raises his hands—to either turn their limbs against them, choke them, or kill them—but is too late as the paper lightning bird dives down from the sky and rams the ground where Voldemort stands. Electric bursts run their way down the stairs from the point of impact.
“C’mon, Harry.” Ron held up the bag of remains. “Got to get this to the Ministry for proper inspection.”
Blaizing Fire leans across the table, a cat prepared to jump an injured bird. In a voice several octaves lower, he says, “Deal.”
Harry’s skin prickles while he collects the articles into his arms, certain that he can feel a set of eyes riveted to his back.
He also remembers Hermione having one of her nerd moments the first time he’d tried explaining it to her when she'd asked about it. She’d muttered “of course!” and then she said something about his chemical makeup changing with his power coursing through his system, and about pregnant women’s chemical shift sometimes affecting their curl patterns. He’d nodded along at the time, even though he half understood. However, he had to draw the line when she asked him to try sending electricity through her to see if it would cause the same effect. Some quests for knowledge have to be abandoned for safety’s sake, and the power coursing through his system is one of them.
“Regret... yes. There are many regrets when it comes to my Draco. Tell me you’ll do anything to track down his killers and have them face justice for what they’ve done. Tell me you’ll do that?”
While Ron wrestles with the swan, fighting off its wings now that its beak is out of commission, Harry attempts to gather the electricity he can feel circulating in and around his body—a newer ability he’s found he had, but it’s still experimental at best. Tiny sparks flicker at his fingertips and between his hair follicles when Ron finally flings the swan aside enough to toss his hand in the villain’s direction.
Of course Potter would be difficult. Draco'd brought this on himself when he said yes to Potter, so here he is, living with the consequences. Shrugging, Draco sighs and turns back to the door. He knocks thrice sharply on the wood and calls out, “Hullo, Ms. Adams. I’m Detective Malfoy from the Ministry’s Department on Creature Incidents. You reported to us that you had an encounter with a vampire. My partner and I are here to discuss that with you.”
Potter doesn’t let go, though there is uncertainty in his step as he follows Draco—who’s walking slowly backwards.
The electricity appears to tease the mechanical arm at first, making it shake where the sparks strike the metal. But when the current catches some of the frayed wires at the end, the entire arm jolts and comes alive.
Draco breathes out in a huff. Excitement thrills through him—looks like they have the perp. But they still have one more victim to get to before they can close this bit out.
When they finally pull back from one another, Potter’s hand is still buried in Draco’s hair, and Draco’s hand has found a way inside Potter’s robes to rub his back. Both pant heavily in the space between.
Their voices drop to a point that not even Harry can hear. Still, after a few more minutes of them whispering, Harry decides to clear his throat.
He strides toward Harry again, but this time, instead of grabbing him and hauling him up, the villain crouches next to Harry. “What kind of game are you playing at, hero?”
“Got a nice tear in the leg of my suit at the first one and had a pleasant chat with the police at the second one.”
Finch-Fletchley doesn’t seem to notice, since he continues anyway. “Then he flings something at the robot at the same time that the robot throws something at him. The machine’s attack causes part of his mask to nearly fall off while also making more slices in his costume. As for the robot? Got one of its arms fully sliced off.”
The top edge of Vice-Net’s silver, identification mask is just beginning to come into view from where’s he’s crouched down when the unmistakable
Sometimes, Harry also hates how much his friends know him. He lets out a long sigh and scrubs a hand down his masked face. “I know. It’s just . . . . Of course, the reason he was injured was due to some nasty situation of his own making. And, damn it all, his nonsense got people killed this time.”
“I don’t know. The fight basically sucked up most of our attention since me and the other hostages didn’t plan on dying.” Finch-Fletchley looks up at the ceiling. “Being tied up, though, makes it real difficult to dodge anything. At one point, the masked person had been right in front of us before dodging one of the machine’s attacks. We weren’t able to.”
!”  Ron’s voice sounds rough from inhaling the tainted air as he shouts Hermione’s hero name. “They’re getting away!”
“What made everything worse was this giant . . . .” She stops speaking and brings a fist up to her mouth.
Spinning on his heal, he spots the figure sitting on the higher part of the roof where the slanted sections come together. Her feathered, blue butterfly mask looks grey in the moonlight.
Beside Harry, the villain’s stopped his moaning and is gathering himself together. Harry’d like to do something heroic about it, but his muscles refuse to move. “Hey,” he tries to shout, but Harry’s still winded and it comes out too weak to hear. Harry watches blearily as the villain takes a moment to fix his askew mask and digs around in one of his side pockets.
“Well, one of the arguing voices went up in pitch. I remember that pretty clearly because it matched well with what I had been feeling at the time. The person the machine was now facing ended up backing up into the light cast by an adjacent room in the flat.”
“That’s kind of easy for someone with lightning powers to say.” Justin glances down at his bare feet. “Besides. I had to quit my lighting job because they haven’t quite been working since I left the hospital.”
Accepting that none of his friends will change their minds, Harry remains in silence for the rest of the trip home.
“Oi! Easy there, bovver boy. You’ve done what you’ve done. Now, it’s in the law’s hands.” The man’s mouth doesn’t say “bugger off now,” but the tilt of his head and the jut of his chin certainly does.
But those aren’t the only high-profile cases to be brought to the court. Particularly difficult and prolonged are the cases given to the Youth Justice court.
And—and that makes sense to Draco. Of course, Potter’s date would have been a woman; somewhere in the back of his mind, he must have known, for it to not shock him now, for him to not have asked about it up until now. His hands slide into his robe pockets, and he tries to pass off as neutral an expression as he can for Potter.
Harry wiped the grass off his robes as he stood, now as eager to get this excursion over with as Ron.
“So . . . you convinced him?” Ginny at least seems to be taking it a bit better. Though, it may also be that she’s currently too baffled by the situation to have energy to spare to be upset.
Part of Harry had expected Malfoy to escalate his malignant behaviour in a haunting blitz after the bruising his ego took, so he had ferreted away anything of remote personal value to him at The Burrow. However, in the following months, Malfoy’s crusade against Harry seemed to crawl to a standstill, wherein he just started occupying space in Harry’s flat without being much of a bother. On the other hand, Harry’s moving of personal items to The Burrow led to a flurry of questions from the Weasleys wondering if he planned to sell his London flat and move in. Harry dismissed the prodding inquiries with the explanation of having “a pest problem.”
Dracon only seems to increase the speed of his pace, which turns out to be to his detriment when he stumbles and has to latch onto the alley wall.
Police and construction workers still swarm the Palace of Westminster, trying to fix the damage caused by the attack several days ago. All the extra police are there to guard the House of Lords and Commons should any bad actors choose to strike again. Harry personally feels that they’re wasting law enforcement’s resources since the Villain Agency already collected what they wanted from the House of Lords, but he won’t complain about not having to worry about the government section this time around.
“Night, Potter.” Malfoy’s expression was uncharacteristically soft as he drifted away while Harry scrambled to gather his thoughts. “Don’t worry. That won’t be happening again. You’re right in that it could only be a net loss for me in the end.”
He waits until Harry sits on the bed after closing the door. “Well, I’m here right now because they don’t expect tomorrow’s decision to go over well for me. Or at least, not as well as Blaise’s,” he says, apparently noticing Harry’s concerned expression. “After all, he’s not facing charges of three accounts involuntary manslaughter.”
“Oh, were you serious, hero?” His laughter finally winds down to a few chuckles. “Thought I told you the first time we met that I’ve been trained for this my whole life. Who would want these skills to go to waste? Combat training’s hardly needed in some cubicle.”
“Yeah. “Finch-Fletchley bobs his head. “Everything after that went a little crazy. I think attacking the robot made it mad because it then attacked the person who hurt it.”
The blow Sir Cadogan dealt to Harry caused him to stumble, but as the older hero is removed from Harry’s personal space, he recovers his senses.
. His eyes dart toward Alpha Bee behind his lenses. The old Superhero’s shoulders are hunched, and his hands are held behind his back. Harry shifts his eyes back toward Cho.
Harry looks away from them. “Er, I didn’t know. I don’t really know now. But I couldn’t just leave him to succumb to treatable injuries.”
He can’t handle hearing that much controlled despair in Potter’s voice. “Maybe—maybe he is. Remember when we suggested Polyjuice? That might be viable... Do you want to stay for the round of questioning from the Aurors so you know? Maybe there’ll be something recognisable.”
“I didn’t want him to wake up and attack me—which he did! And my second blast hit him accidentally when I was trying to rid myself of his stupid paper swarm,” Harry says.
Everyone jumps a little when the villain snorts, a deep chuckle rising from the depths of his chest. “Really, now?” Blaizing Fire’s voice comes from the Supervillain. “Well, only if you answer mine. Why are you wasting your time interrogating me about what you already know?” His cuffed, gloved hands lift and stroke the tabletop, and his voice drops an octave. “Your lot did confiscate the file from me.”
Harry’s already reaching for his duffel bag when he remembers his costume’s currently out of commission.
Dracon rolls around so he lies on his back. “Ah. You seem to have forgotten the detail of me and my cohorts having stolen from a government agency. A high federal offence. And that what we stole is deliberately meant to
Potter meets him on Christmas Eve at the place designated on his missive. Just like before, he’s bundled from head to toe.
Potter grabs hold of his other wrist. Then they stand there for an undetermined amount of time, just staring at their linked limbs. And Potter’s still so far away.
Blaizing Fire serves six months for the attack on a government building. Each month, Izulu sends him roughly eight playing cards, until, when he’s finally released, he has the full deck and an invite to a weekly card game at the Weasley house.
His hopes sink as he realizes the pieces are too small to put back together, that he won’t be able to confirm whether he had hallucinated the lettering or not. He wonders if Justin Finch-Fletchley, one of the victims of the incident, would know.
Harry replied indignantly with a strangled string of syllables. He was still trying to answer her when she grabbed his arm and Disapparated them away from that nightmare of a place.
Clenching his teeth, he braces himself and then rises above the pew as well. With perhaps more force than necessary, he rips the electricity from one of the flat-screens hanging on the upper walls and strikes
“Allow me to help you get that.” Harry reaches out and pulls the coat tighter around her frail frame. “It's getting nippier out now that Autumn’s here.”
“I told you!” Harry says. “It was just a light one! I didn’t put anything serious behind the first one.”
He awakens to the smell of smoke and the sensation of extreme heat.  Whatever isn’t blanketed in thick black fumes is covered by a flashing orange. Lolling his head around, Harry can see the shape of bodies in the distance.
Just one more circuit around the last section of London, and he might make it home by ten to eat Mrs. Weasley’s delicious cooking. Sure, it’s a little early for him on a Friday when crime’s busiest, and he doesn’t have to worry about waking up the next day with assignments due for classes. But he wouldn’t mind having a soak in the tub for his sore thigh—after all, a guy working this hard has got to treat himself right sometime.
“But Harry,” Draco said sadly, “in the admittedly slim chance that this doesn’t work out... you’re not the one they’re all going to blame.”
Harry shifted in his chair and nervously continued rubbing at his chin. “I don’t, erm… I dunno if I want to--”
When he pulled away, Harry sighed and then swore under his breath. Draco brushed the shaggy black hair from his face and stared at him for a moment. A just-fucked Harry was downright addictive to stare at.
“No... you know what?” Harry said, standing up and shuffling towards the fireplace. “You’re being a huge knob, and I think I’m done for today.”
“Well… then, I suppose I should leave you alone,” Harry said, biting back a sudden onslaught of unexpectedly bitter tears.
Harry laughed. “Sorry, sorry. We dated for a few months, but there wasn’t a deep enough connection to take it further. I mean, emotionally. Physically, on the other hand… Yeah, that part was never an issue.”
Something about the teasing challenge in Harry’s voice fiercely reminded Draco of the adolescent duels, idiotically risky flying, and scathing insults of years past, but somehow the memories no longer carried any sting with them. Draco didn’t dwell on what that meant, however. Instead, he followed the sudden (and likely alcohol-influenced) impulse to playfully point his wand at Harry with a smile, earlier nerves forgotten at the happiness of holding his own wand again. Harry held his hands up and raised his eyebrows, a grin playing on his face as well.
“We keep busy, as you can imagine,” his mother replied, across the table from him, with a soft smile. “There are all sorts of tasks to attend to, duties to fulfill, social obligations. You remember.”
“It’s really nice, actually,” Hermione said pensively, pulling a stray noodle out of Rose’s hair. “All of us getting along now that we’re older.”
Draco stared at his reflection in the mirror and felt a sudden wave of utter hopelessness washing over him. So, this was it, then. This was the end of their extremely short-lived friendship. Harry had witnessed him losing control of his bodily functions, he would tell everyone he knew, and Draco would become an even bigger social pariah than he already was. If it wasn’t all so pathetically absurd, Draco might have sat back down on the bathroom floor and had himself a good long cry. The only silver lining here was that Draco had thrown up most of the alcohol he had consumed and he now felt reasonably more coherent.
“My apologies, Potter,” Draco murmured, and he found that he really meant it. “I suppose I keep teasing you about being spoiled simply because it makes me feel slightly better about being spoiled myself. I apologize if I’ve hit a sore spot.”
The day had progressively cooled off, and it looked as if it might rain soon, so Draco lit a cozy fire in his sitting room and put on some comforting classical music. He curled himself up on the armchair under a grey throw blanket with a book and a cup of tea while he waited for Harry.
“There’s a million reasons why,” Harry continued, taking Draco’s hand and slipping the ring on his finger. It felt warm. “But I can give you a few, if you want.”
Harry snorted in confusion. “Honey, if you’re trying to tell me you're a genius, I already got that memo ages ago.”
He watched as Harry leaned forward and quickly peeled off his own t-shirt before falling back against the couch, flinging his arm over his head and closing his eyes. Once Draco had unclasped the belt, he made quick work of the flies of Harry’s trousers and tugged firmly at the waistband. Harry obediently lifted his hips and Draco pulled the trousers down, along with his pants, past his knees, down his legs, and over his ankles. Draco tossed them aside to join the two shirts on the floor.
Before Draco could dwell on the idea further, particularly the fact that Harry fitted so easily into his mental plans a year in advance, he was distracted by the faint outline of an owl a short distance away.
Draco cleared his throat and took a deep breath before sauntering over to Potter’s table, fists clenched tightly.
“I think you’ve answered more than enough of my questions,” he told her, hating himself for his cowardice. “Actually, I believe I garnered the most information by just observing all of you together this evening. The way you interact with each other speaks for itself, really.”
Draco heard the high-pitched whimper fall from his own mouth and was powerless to stop it. He felt himself melt against Harry, their cocks still rubbing deliciously against each other beneath their clothing.
“Well,” Harry began, “you still talk fancy. You’re still a sarcastic little git. You still use more styling potion in your hair than anyone I’ve ever known. You still smirk at me sometimes. You’re still ghostly pale and skinny and you walk like you’re doing us all a favor.”
“Plenty of things, as it happens,” Draco answered. “I have an extensive series of questions planned for the evening, and we’re about to dig a lot deeper than we have thus far, so I hope you’re ready.”
Draco ignored the snitches in his stomach again and sighed in mock consternation. “Alright, then. What else?”
“Just to piece it all together for the report,” she explained. “It’s a work-related thing, so I scheduled it for you. At least this way it’s on company time, so you can get paid for it.”
After a long period of confessions, Draco finally paused and stared at Harry, who stared back at him.
Harry picked up a macaron and walked back over to him, nudging himself in between Draco’s legs and shimmying up close to his body. Draco could feel his heat and smell his heavenly scent, and he was suddenly very glad he was sitting down. Harry made him quite weak in the knees.
He figured he should wait to owl Draco, because he knew how pathetic it would look if owling him was the first thing he did when he got back to London. He didn’t want to seem obsessed, but bugger, he kind of was, wasn’t he? Besides, Draco probably hadn’t thought of him once the whole week, and what difference did it make to Malfoy whether Harry sent an owl at all? Anyway, he would be seeing him again soon. Only twenty-four hours to go.
“Unintentionally, I assure you,” Draco muttered under his breath as he walked, dignified as he could in such a situation, into the kitchen. Harry followed him like an eager puppy.
“I’m not entirely sure,” Draco answered truthfully. “It was my understanding that you and Harry left things on shaky terms yesterday--”
“I’ll be right back,” Draco said and left the room swiftly. He went to the loo himself, partly because he needed a wee but mostly because he felt as if he was about to jump out of his skin. He had no idea why he was suddenly so nervous. Most likely it was the fact that Potter was in his home, in his space, and it was… alarming, to say the least.
“Potter, if you think we’re suddenly close enough for me to be able to somehow decipher what on earth you’re saying, you are sorely mistaken.”
Draco grinned over at Potter, who just stared at him as if he had no idea who this person in front of him was. And maybe he didn’t, not anymore.
“And working at the Ministry automatically puts me squarely in the public eye,” she continued. “We’re no longer enigmas to people, so they’ve mostly left us alone. Granted, you were always a more interesting public figure than us--”
“You secretly adore my terrible manners,” Harry said with a full mouth. “You like it when people give you a chance to show off how proper you are in comparison.”
“And you?” Draco asked, wiping his eyes. “I know this is a lot, Mother. I know it seems impossible.”
“You know, you’ve called me Harry twice now,” he said gently. “You can keep doing that if you like.”
“I’m just trying to see if I'll have time to run to the shop before I leave for work tomorrow,” he answered, yawning. “I dunno how much food I have for you here.”
Draco only shrugged again. He wasn’t sure how he could get himself out of this one, so he decided not to bother trying; let Harry make of it what he would. He threw back the last of his tea.
Draco snorted. “I’ll be back to normal in the morning, you’ve said so yourself. No use missing a day’s work over this.”
“Well, I’m glad,” he said, trying to figure out how to phrase his thoughts properly. “You all deserve some happiness, after… I mean, after everything.”
“I know,” Draco said softly. “Though the clandestine secrecy has admittedly been a little bit exciting, don’t you agree?”
“I feel something for you, Draco,” he confessed, and he forced himself to simply sit inside the fear for once. “And I really didn’t want to, but I do, and I can’t help it. I like you. I like spending time with you.”
Draco knew Harry couldn’t be as comfortable as he looked, having slept in jeans all night. Curiosity prompted him to glance down at his own body and, sure enough, he too was still wearing last night’s clothing: white dress shirt, black trousers. He decided he wasn’t wholly uncomfortable, but he was certainly ready for a shower, a wee, and a fresh outfit. Maybe not in that order. And now that he thought about it, his mouth tasted rather grungy as well.
“I thought you two were meant to be together,” Draco said a few moments later, as he forced his shaking legs to propel him forward again. “Get married young, have several redheaded children with green eyes, and the like.”
“I essentially live in the muggle world now, Potter,” Draco said, staring at Harry’s hand. “But I am surprised that you have decent taste in music.”
He was midway through his fourth cup of coffee (and a rather steamy daydream, which may or may not have been set in a deserted cafe) several hours later, when a pale orange note flew into his cubicle and landed in front of him.
“You can’t ask me to tell you what I’ve written every time I write something,” Draco sighed, shaking his head in exasperation.
They kissed again, and Draco felt the snitches in his stomach slowly begin to nudge him out of his melancholy mood. Kissing Harry still set his body on fire.
, for Merlin’s sake. Draco was suddenly concerned that he might expel that fourth cup of coffee all over Rosalind’s desk.
“I suppose that changes things, then?” Draco said rather bitterly. He pushed down a sudden lump in his throat.
Their breathing mingled heavily between them, each of them alternating between staring at each other’s eyes and staring at each other’s mouths.
“Because I know you hate the things I’ve done, you hate that you’re in love with someone who hurt people,” Draco argued.
Harry was so excited to see Draco again so soon after their last rendezvous that he made sure he was in the lobby of the Auror department at precisely 11:59 am, with a massive coffee in his hand. (He had even managed to find an
When Draco pulled back, he kissed Harry’s chin, his neck, his collarbone. He wanted to feel Harry’s heat again.
“It’s like I told you three weeks ago, Potter,” Draco said gently. “I knew our shared history would come back to bite us one day.”
Nodding in approval, the heroine in charge commences to lead the group down the hallway and to the stairs.
She yanks her ankle from his grip. “What would you know about it?” Cho strides right up to Alpha Bee. “He’s there, isn’t he? Behind that door?”
Pulling back from him, Potter scans his eyes across Draco’s face. Merlin, Draco knows he gets terribly blotchy when he cries.
Again, I couldn’t really say. If anything, this just means there’re two things we should all be worrying about regarding the Villain Agency,” Harry says.
“It had been a small explosion at first. Enough that it lit some of the knocked-over furniture on fire.” Finch-Fletchley leans back on the couch. “Looked like some fancy stuff too. But anyway, with the fire, I could see that both the masked figure and the robot were pretty banged-up. Lots of rips in the one bloke’s outfit. Little harder to tell with the robot since I didn’t have a good look at it before the fight started, but it seemed to be sparking in places it hadn’t before.”
“Rescued three of them, though. I’ll have to stop by the hospital tomorrow to see if the survivors knew the other victims. See if I can hunt down the families and let them know. Offer what comfort I can.” He shrugs like it isn’t a big deal. Like doing so will change anything.
“Like he’s complained! Potter could’ve rid himself of me whenever he fucking wanted!” He then turned his full attention to Harry, expression losing some of its hard edges. “Your magic. Potter, you could free me of this place.”
“Not fond of tea? That’s all right.” Alpha Bee gestures to Hermione who already has her notebook out. A chair materializes on the opposite end of the table, in front of Alpha Bee. He takes it and sits down across from the prisoner. “
A voice hisses next to his ear. “I don’t know what kind of fool you take me for, but you better tell me who the bloody hell you are before it gets a little messy back here.”
Hermione either doesn’t hear Ron’s comment, or she’s too happy to care at the moment. “Have there been any books either of you two have been eyeing?”
“Yeah, I was getting to that. I was just thinking of how to word it, since I’ve only really come to understand it recently myself.” Harry takes a long breath in through his nose and slowly releases it. “So, like
, Harry swallows hard and nearly chokes on his tongue. With unsteady fingers, Harry writes on the card:
Hermione hums into her tea cup. “I know that this was a situation none of us have really been in before. Often, we rush in right when an emergency is occurring. There’s no real time to ask questions. We just act based on what information we have to go on at the time. Then once the immediate danger has passed, we’re often thanked for what we’ve done.” She taps the table next to where she’s placed her saucer. “I don’t think we’ve run into any serious problems yet that people haven’t been happy to have us solve.”
His head turned away from the direction of Dracon’s voice, Harry shuffles back over to the trolley. He lifts the sheet enough to see Paper Dracon’s costume, under-mask, and dragon skull mask on the bottom shelf. Yeah, he was right to assume Dracon stands exposed behind him.
in the manor. Wasn't much of a secret as I thought, where I went when I slipped away. I led them here—to the babies. I—I—”
By the time he and Dracon reach the bottom of the stairwell, the battle ends. The victor shoves his opponent’s body down the staircase, leaving Harry and Dracon to jump out of its way. When Harry glances at the corpse, he sees
As relieved as Harry is to hear that the evidence hadn’t been totally destroyed, he can’t hide a wince when he imagines the moment Cho’s famous rain burst attack hit the highly electrical arm. He doesn’t have to make much of a leap in imagination to envision exactly how the arm came to be in many pieces. “Okay. And what about what else I’ve missed the last day or so?”
“Yeah, mate,” Ron says as all of them are steadily lifted in the air by bats. “How did you get out?”
“What? They didn’t mention to you that thing activates when someone uses their power? I thought you had a plan?”
Blaizing Fire is hunched over the table, elbow placed on its surface and head propped in his hand, his under-mask clutched in the other.
Cho sucks in a deep breath as she draws back in her chair to fold her arms across her chest. “I still don’t see what this has to do with you letting him go
The door swings open, and Harry’s somehow the last one inside. Everyone except Ron seems to be giving the villain enough space. Both Alpha Bee and Hermione stand against the walls, facing the desk, while Ron leans his hands against it. The door closes behind Harry with an audible
Blaizing Fire jerks his head away from where he’s continued to bore a hole into Harry’s head, ruffled at being addressed in such a manner. “Pardon?”
Potter turns his head to the side to stare at a point on the wall to the left, his shoulders hunching. “It’s not really something I try remembering all that much.”
Another villain would make more sense. Likelier to fight and leave once Paper Dracon’d been defeated.
As awkwardly phrased as that was, Draco gets it, and he hums his understanding instead of using words that could become twisted in his mouth. And even though he said just as much to Potter in their last meeting, it wouldn’t really be his fault should the vampire decide to go after another victim. Placing his saucer down, he pulls out his notepad and self-inking quill. “All right, Potter. Tell me what happened.”
Suddenly, the arsehole with the dragon mask’s in Harry’s line of sight—except the mask now rests slightly askew on his head, as if deliberating on the benefits of falling off. He’s gesturing in the direction from which they fell. “You see that? Do you
There are three flats above the shop—two for tenants and one for the owner. Mr. Eeylops leaves them off at the one on the far end, slipping in more bright-eyed pleasantries before departing.
Draco knocks one last time and glares at the door when it refuses to magically open for him before he spins around and pushes past Potter in a huff.
“When would you have...? Oh.” Malfoy’s face morphed from confusion into a grimace. “Your war-time visit. Guess they would have had to march you up the drive; only family could Apparate directly inside. Family and—”
“You’ve frustrated me,” she continues. “Your actions have seemed senseless to me and spoke of a willingness to put your fellow heroes in danger while you flirted with letting a villain escape justice. It appeared careless, the way you behaved. Like, as long as what you did didn’t affect you, you didn’t have to take your duty as a hero seriously.”
Vice-Net opens a lamp stand drawer, pulls out some notepad paper and a pen, and hands them over to Blaizing Fire.
“Hold on,” Harry says as Dracon tries to stand. He unthinkingly grabs the villain’s upper arm when he starts to fall over.
“Two months, Harry,” Hermione said. “It had been only two months after the War that Malfoy came back into your life like this. That’s hardly enough time for someone dealing with the threat of being murdered for seven years to come to terms that they’re allowed to be at peace.”
Harry feels the indescribable itch return to his fingertips, and he knows it has nothing to do with the electricity surging through him.
“Yes, you bested me, hero.” Scorn drips from his tone. He crosses his legs at the ankle. “Now what?”
“That’s everything.” Petty, interrupting the elf right back, but Draco knows he’ll need to get it out of his system if he’s to handle this situation properly.
“You offered; I accepted. You backing out now?” While the last part had clearly meant to come out forceful, it instead leaves Dracon sounding hesitant and uncertain.
The villain leans back and raises his voice. “Got ourselves a little new boy trying to play hero. And what a hero costume he has! Tell me, did your Grandmother knit that jumper for your dog? Are those used joggers? And did that mask come from a cereal box?”
Meanwhile, Draco and Potter watch as Mr. Hendricks’ skin develops a sickly grey quality, his facial features sharpen more, and his blue eyes shift to a burning scarlet. With Mr. Hendricks still staring intensely at him and Potter, Draco feels relieved that the other two victims aren’t in here as even
The Thatcher statue is shifting around to face Ron again, while Vice-Net prepares another barrage of attacks, and, to top it off,
It’s a few days since his last run-in with Paper Dracon in the alleyway in Kensington and since he last spoke with Blaizing Fire. Even more since he last tried to see the people injured in the kidnapping-turned-murder. He wonders when they will be discharged at the hospital and whether they’ll all still be babysat by the police for protection. Mrs. Figg had shooed him away when he went to follow up about the boat situation, and the blood tests Hermione has been running on that piece of fabric he’d given her have turned up empty of matches in the police databases.
Spinning on his heel, Draco starts to trek down Diagon Alley, hoping Potter excused the colour spots in Draco’s cheeks as coming from the cold.
“Blimey, that’s incredible dedication.” His blue eyes have gone soft with the affectionate look he sets on Hermione.
Harry bites the inside of his cheek, and then lets out a sigh as he lightly rakes a hand across his hair. “Don’t you think I want to know, too? Yeah, they took a lot of heroes’ true identities, and are planning who knows what with them. But . . . it’s just—it’s wrong to just tear off someone’s mask like that. I’d feel wrong. It’d be breaking the Super Code.”
Truthfully, Harry had been aiming for a hug. What he got was a wide-eyed Draco locking lips with an equally startled Harry.Their shock lasted mere seconds while their kiss lasted much longer, both of them surrendering to the embrace of the other—a surrender far more gentle and kind than the surrendering of their souls from their bodies.
A numb sensation washes over him. His mind races with so many thoughts that he feels as though he’s hardly thinking at all.
“Well, good work, anyway, mate.” Ron strides forward and pats Harry on the back. “You got some good information.”
“Well, yes.” She moves a hand to tug an errant curl caught by the wind back behind her ear. “But you both so rarely ever come with me when I get books.”
and his breath kissing the sides of Harry’s face. He also loosened his hold on Harry’s hand enough that the Snitch slid from their fingers, disintegrating into a cascade of silvery magic that swirled up and into Draco’s chest and pulsed once before settling and sealing up the hole there.
“I know that,” Paper Dracon snaps. However, he doesn’t move away from Harry’s sudden close proximity.
Harry’s hands itch. He squeezes them into fists and tears his gaze away from the figure—back toward Alpha Bee, who is lifting a folder from its place on the counter that stretches the length of the glass.
“It was definitely an all-black get-up. I could definitely see why it had been hard to see him in the shadows of the room. But he stopped retreated before the angle of the light could shine on his head.
“Foolishness, more like. We, unlike you heroes, know not to grow attached to those who can’t handle themselves in a bad situation.”
“Yeah, well, I say it’s kind of lucky you’re still cooped up in here, mate. Cho’s still pretty steamed about the Blaizing Fire situation.”
s Cho thrashed. Reaching out a hand, he yanks what electricity remains in the robots and strikes Voldemort with it.
In spite of himself, Draco can feel his lips twitch a little. The more things change... “Also, Weasley.”
“Looks like your mate there’s about to give out.” Dracon’s voice becomes malicious. “Then what will you do?”
“Okay, that’s all right. Do you recall anyone else being in the room with you besides the other kidnapped people? Like the masked person or any other type of odd item . . . ?”
“It should be. Enough that is. You picked out distinct enough details that are unique enough for us to identify vampires or victims that match the profile.” Draco knows he should say something else, before he leaves, before he ends this. Before he heads home and gets sloshed enough to fall into his own oblivion for awhile. “Thanks, Potter. For the cooperation. We’ll—we’ll get ‘em.”
For several minutes, Dracon doesn’t move. His chest doesn’t even seem to rise and fall with his breathing.
the peachick hopped down onto Malfoy’s lap, leaving a hole the size of Harry’s fist, if that fist were larger and crueler, where Malfoy’s heart should be.
Potter’s eyes take on a shifty light as he breaks eye contact to stare at a point beside Draco’s head.
Instead, Draco pushes open the shop door to Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour. It had opened just a month ago after being closed down since the start of the Wizarding War.
Her head shifts as she looks at Draco, and he catches a glimpse of more of her face. Her brown eyes have sunken slightly in their sockets. The skin looks drawn and almost translucent, the only splash of colour being the unnatural redness of her lips. A moment later, Draco realises why as he watches one of her small fangs pierce her bottom lip, and blood spreads across it.
“Right. Well, um...” Harry cast about for more to say, and his eyes caught the motion of the peachicks. “So what’s with the little...”
Potter shuffles beside Draco, unnoticed. Though, should Potter remove his wrappings, the shop owner would be sure to take notice then. Yet, Potter makes no moves to do so, even in the perfect lighting for his current condition. All he does is cancel the spells creating the parasol effect on Draco’s wand before clearing his throat and passing it back to Draco who pockets it.
Taking a deep breath, Harry removes the arm covering his face. His green eyes connect with Fire’s deep brown ones, and Harry notices the smirk he wears. Movement out of his periphery draws Harry’s attention to where Blaizing Fire is removing his black trousers.
The door swings open in three minutes, Tracey Davis standing there in jeans and a Wimbleton pullover. “Who are you, really? Who do you work for?”
“Already here, are you?” The voice is low, rough, and dangerous in all the ways that Potter’s voice normally isn’t.
Alpha Bee claps his hands. “She’s been on a long trip all these years, and we’re delighted to have her return to us.”
“But we’ve injured almost all of them! Do you really think they all managed to get far in the state we left them in?”
The ground shakes violently, but the three heroes stand like the earthquake rocking the villains to their knees isn’t even there. Vice-Net’s sharp objects melt in his hands, and the rest decorating the inside of his suit plop onto the street in pools of molten metal. Paper Dracon’s forced to let go of the origami birds he’d pulled from his pockets as they catch alight. GarGoyle’s new army of stone statues can be heard prowling just outside the impenetrable barrier Hermione has formed.
The first time Harry meets Paper Dracon, he’s thirteen and debuting as a hero. He had spent the week hacking into the Villain Agency’s secret radio frequency, aided by his experimental zaps to a junk radio his Aunt and Uncle had given to him two weeks late for his birthday. Through a stroke of luck, he had heard blips of their plans involving a dock by the Thames.
Potter still stares wordlessly at him anyway, and Draco wonders if Potter’s become skilled at Legilimency in recent years.
He lands in a bin stuffed with uncollected refuse. As Harry lays on the pile in a daze, he isn’t sure if the delirium is a result of the harsh landing or the events that preceded it.
She nods, eyes him up some more, and then lets him go. Harry’s glad that he thought to not specify the
“Oh, what could the Ministry want with my quaint old shop?” Mr. Eeylops blinks up at Draco with eyes magnified twenty times their regular size by his glasses.
can’t—do something like that and still claim to be on the side of justice. Even if this is a villain, Harry can’t seem to shake the spark of shame that mingles with the excitement and anticipation at the idea of seeing the face behind the mask. Even if, by chance, the Supervillain before them is Paper Dracon.
“Anyone can be a hero, if they work for it.” Harry crosses his arms before himself. “You wanted to know what you could do that wouldn’t waste your combat skills.”
Snorting, Malfoy said, “Viscount Archibald III has quite the reputation for being horrendous at gambling and even more horrendous at being able to say no to a round. Who knows how much more he can take on before he becomes a Shade? One almost feels sorry for the bastard.”
“You’re right, Mr. Potter.” She looked off to the side. “I couldn’t have protected my son—I couldn’t even protect him from falling in with the Dark Lord. And still, he insisted on staying behind to pay for the mistakes grown-ups made.”
Just thinking about his scar sets his forehead throbbing, and he shoves it under the water to soothe it.
“I know. I know.” Alpha Bee pats at her back. “You want to prevent anyone else from losing their lives to the Villain Agency. But you can’t do so by acting recklessly.”
Harry collects his thoughts and interrupts her mid-sentence. “Do you know why they would take it? The boat, I mean.”
“Nothing too new. Just that it can definitely attack other people and kill them. The witness couldn’t tell how, though. Apparently, its attacks came too fast to distinguish anything.”
That would explain why Dracon’s bearing at the beginning of the fight had been different. He’d been favoring one leg, and neither Harry nor Ron could tell from such a distance. Peering closer at the Supervillain, Harry receives another shock. “You still have your other injuries.”
“Friend? Hmmm, yes, I think I’m beginning to see why you have such a slanted, optimistic view about my future prospects in heroism. We’re . . . comrades for a cause.”
The villain’s weight leaves Harry’s body, and while the pounding in his head makes focusing anywhere difficult, he believes he sees a colony of bats clinging to the many pockets in the bloke’s costume, flying several meters above the ground.
The villain’s laughter ceases, and he sits back up against the wall. He’s silent for a while, giving the impression he’s studying Harry. Finally, he shifts the good leg a little and speaks. “Course not. I’ve never called you by it, have I?”
Potter glances at Draco, eyes giving away nothing, but his anxious lip nibbling certainly does. “If you think it’ll lead us somewhere...”
“Yes.” Now Potter’s doing that distinctly Potter-thing of running his hand through his ragged Potter-hair. “I’d made my decision right after you left, actually.”
“Well, I mean, not every person always feels joy after being helped. At least not right away. Sometimes it’s something they only feel years down the line. Then there are the people who express sadness for the people you couldn’t save, rather than happiness for the ones you have.”
“Why, Ha-Izulu?” Ron doesn’t move his hand away from the Supervillain’s face. “They’re perfectly fine with using every hero’s identity against them for some twisted plot of theirs. The least we can get in return would be one Supervillain’s identity.”
“You let him get away?!” Blaizing Fire is on his feet, arms stretched over the table where his hands grasp the front of Harry’s costume, flinching only slightly at the sting of electricity. Harry’s neat piles of cards scatter as the table jolts.
Paper Dracon’s hand curls around the paper bird, careful not to crush it. Then he lets it go, and it flaps and flutters before him—Harry had never truly appreciated how beautiful an art Dracon’s power is—before it dips down and slices up the crevice of the manacle. A second later, the chain collapses to the floor with a clatter.
“—they go right through me, too, when I ‘catch’ them and—” Harry’s eyes widened. “Hang on, did I actually
The origami bird’s flapping at him with its wings and pecking at him with a sharp beak. As Harry powers back up to blast the swan, he sees another equally large white shape flying away.
“Didn’t really notice that last one. Guess it comes with the territory of having ghosts constantly passing through them. Since I’m not doing that one on purpose, I can't really make that go away.” Malfoy shrugged. “But fine, I’ll stop with the shower visits—though, here, I thought you enjoyed our little shared showers.”
“It wouldn’t be a breach of confidentiality to get your testimony directly from you, however.” Harry nibbles his bottom lip. “That is, if you'd be willing to provide it.”
He tries the first three doors to the left of him and finds a ballroom, a loo, and a closet. Upon opening the door to the ballroom, a maid catches him and asks what he’s doing. Prepared, Harry removes the note in his other pocket that reads:
The Auror that had spoken to Mr. Hendricks before takes out his wand and waves it about, changing the lighting in the room. The effect is not quite what Muggles refer to as Blacklight, but a similar, surrealistic quality befalls the people in the room.
Both their heads snap around toward the Palace of Westminster as the flock of gargoyles rise out of the hole the villains entered through and start an arching wave of hell towards them.
“It was . . . difficult. When I first started out. People would look at me and—wouldn’t see a hero.” He takes a breath that rattles in his ribcage. “More often than not, when I’d arrive on a scene, they’d think I was a villain. Hell, even Supervillains would, too.” Harry releases a watery laugh. “One time, this petty villain was trying to pull a bank heist and asked for my help when I showed up—in exchange for a cut of the stolen goods. And I’ve lost count of the times I was put under arrest for fighting villains.”
Looking up, it’s hard for Harry to make the figure out on the roof from the glare of the streetlamp. But, like with Blaizing Fire, Harry would recognize that voice anywhere.
Harry waved his hand dismissively. “They’re not that oblivious,” he muttered. “But everyone knows you're too smart to let a little budding romance affect your game. I think they pity me. We’ll be fine.”
The race to the adjacent empty alleyway is rushed and desperate. The top three buttons on Harry’s shirt end up undone; somehow, one has even been torn off entirely.
Harry slept wretchedly. He was pretty sure he’d not had a night that bad since the winter Teddy did a stint in St. Mungo’s with pneumonia. More than anything, it was frustrating as all hell. He woke up at half past two, sweat sticky down his back and sheets tangled around his ankles, hot and claustrophobic and reminding him acutely of Venomous Tentacula.
I don’t know if I love you, but I know this: I think you're smart, and sincere, and gorgeous, and compassionate, and when I’m not thinking about that, I still can’t get you out of my head. I think you are the strongest person I have ever met. I think that I admire you, but not in a cold, marble-sculpture way, but as a person, who I want to trust forever, and I want to watch fall apart, and I want to hold, and I want to hold me.
“Oh, surely not,” Hagrid said, turning to look at them properly. “How could he not be happy with you two?”
Harry returns the expression best he can but not half as elegant. “Do you say that because you want to know, or because you think it would be good for me to talk?”
“If anyone has a Hidden Immunity Idol, now would be the time to play it,” Jeff recited, returning after the short recess it took for him to collect and sort the votes.
have to vote with your alliance, you might be able to subtly convince others not to. Manipulation, my dear, is not so hard when you have vastly greater knowledge.
In seconds, all of the kids were in on the chant, even quiet Ellie and barely-old-enough-to-form-sentences Hugo. “Hotel for Dogs! Hotel for Dogs! Hotel for Dogs!”
“Okay,” he said, finally, “let’s talk it out. Making a concrete plan is almost impossible in a social strategy game, so I think the first thing we need to do is gather information. This could blow over in a day; we don’t know. I think we should get serious about eavesdropping-- use charms and stuff to listen in on conversations and then exploit weaknesses. We look for holes and then sew paranoia.”
She cleared her throat. “As the wife of a senator, I have learned to appreciate the work that happens in the background. Just like a government needs a cabinet, a support staff, and families to come home to, so does an alliance. Although I was not the first to speak my mind or the first to share at Tribal, the contributions I made to my tribe cannot be dismissed. I was always present, I never panicked, and I was the person that people came to when they had a disagreement or concern. Namely, I was the calming presence who talked to Jones when he grew upset or uncomfortable. I believe many of you can thank me for the work I put in to keep our alliance together, and credit that to the progress you made in the game.”
Jeff called Draco up last, and he readied himself, letting his mind clear and his nerves quell as anticipation turned to concentration.
Draco rolls his eyes fondly at Harry’s sneaker, his dimples deepening as a grin spreads across his face. “See you at mine,” he says as he steps into the restaurant’s apparition booth, disappearing with a snap.
Taking a deep reassuring breath, Draco gunned it, jumping onto the unstable bridge with shaky feet. He heard more than felt himself hit the water, his body careening sideways as the cylinder spun under his feet. He came up spluttering, coughing to clear the harsh salt-water from his windpipe. He gasped desperately for a moment, his frantic limbs thrashing to keep him afloat.
With this letter, I have sent you Dr. Bulstrode’s contact address and a piece of parchment that you can write your Floo address on. I will not see it, but it will transfer itself into my secretary Monica’s address ledger to enable communication while respecting your privacy. She will then send you the testing kit. There is an Unspeakable-strength Privacy charm on the ledger, so she can’t memorize any Floo address in it.
However, there is one text that helped many magical people recently. Its origin is kind of mysterious, but it’s a handwritten journal found between books about complicated magic, such as becoming an Animagus, in the Hogwarts library. The parchment dates from the 1950s, but we can only date the age of the surface, not of the letters written on it. It’s called the Prongs manuscript.
He doesn’t know what to say, so he goes with, “Will you buy me a drink? You know, for all the trouble you caused?”
“Out out out!” Draco warned, shoving Harry back into the daylight. Harry gasped, running his hands over his limbs and sobbing in relief when he found himself whole.
“Don’t worry. We’ll get that terrarium taken over to Hagrid tonight and then we can get back to normal,” Harry said as they climbed the steps to the main entrance of the school.
Draco pulls back, lips the colour of the scarlet velvet drapings. He soothes the nips on Harry’s neck with the pad of his thumb. “You okay?”
Even with the wind and distant crash of waves, the grating growl of unfinished ceramic rubbing against itself drowned Draco’s senses as the lid of the urn was peeled off. “This has been nothing if not an exciting evening. Shall we get to reading the votes?” Jeff said.
Harry picked him up, both hands under his arse, and spun him. Green, speckled canopy whirled above his head until it looked like a tornado descending upon them. Draco let the whirling tempest whisk him away. It felt like flying.
You know, I usually love when we have Teddy around, but yesterday I just wished to be alone with you. But I guess you realized that when Aunt Andie picked Teddy up and I ripped your clothes off as soon as they had Flooed away.
“Funny,” he said. “Neither am I. Guess we’re stuck with each other’s company. What do you say we make the most of it?”
Dean and Blaise show up next. They share a flat across the river, and they say they’re just roommates, but Draco thinks they might be ‘roommates’.
“Oh come on, that was a long time ago. I’m much better around the creatures now,” Draco said, waving his hand. “Give me the tank. He’ll be alright in my office for the rest of the afternoon, then we can get him home and set up a nice terrarium for him.”
“Simply taking a light stretch, Potter.” Draco jeered bitterly. “It’s a lovely day, don’t you think?”
“I’ll go for the advantage. You need to eat,” Draco said quietly, sidling closer to Harry and appearing as nonchalant as possible. He didn’t want it to look like they were sharing anything more than idle small talk; Lonnie may have been both lovingly familiar with Harry and a fantastic read on people, but the fact that they had broadcasted any signals at all was a red flag.
He faked deliberation; he was a godawful liar, but manufacturing a pregnant pause wasn’t too difficult. “Jessie,” he said eventually. “I’m going to vote for Jessie.”
for you on my wand. If you cast vibrations, it makes notes. I got the idea from the magical signature spell. I’m arse at music, but I thought you’d appreciate it,” he had said to the ground.
Harry’s face broke into his trademark lopsided grin, dimples puckering underneath his dark stubble. Even gaunt and tired, he had a magnetic charisma that drew every eye.
“Draco, this is huge, isn’t it? If a physical structure can store magic so efficiently, we can study it, replicate it. This could revolutionize technology!” Harry said, standing to pull him into a bone crushing hug.
“Yeah, yeah, just keep an eye on him,” Harry replied warily. He watched the toad for a moment before finally pointing his wand at the tank and performing the spell.
I know it must be hard to have felt like you were unable to go about your daily life for so long, but I want you to know that it's okay to need help. Focus on your healing. Reaching out is the first step, and it is incredibly brave and incredibly smart of you. If you had broken your leg, you would let the bone heal, especially if you had no access to Skele-Gro and had to heal it the Muggle way.
“Indeed,” Draco says on an exhale. He draws out his fingers slowly, and Harry mewls in indignation as he clenches down instinctually on nothing. Draco gathers Harry to his chest and flips them. It is a true feat of agility-- Harry is dead weight, putty. When his back hits the mattress, he lets his eyes close and his legs fall open. Both of his wrists land over his head.
Harry tips his head up to the sky. A sun ray falls across his neck. The Thestrals have moved closer. The mother laps at a clear stream, content to let the foal wander in pursuit of a large hairy moth.
Harry whirled around. “I thought you said we were okay? Why won’t you talk to me!” he shouted, his voice wet and broken. He pulled the back of his hand over his eyes jerkily, spreading tears up his brow.
Prepare for the finale! Also, how exactly do Rai stones work? (And how did gear theory wind up in a fic about a game-show?)
“Malfoy?” Harry says. They have their backs to one another, each a score of paces from the center of the corridor and progressing inwards. The floor is littered with soapstone bricks, several of which are shaped far too much like safari animals to be of coincidence. These in particular keep falling from the walls when they are replaced, no matter how much mortar Harry conjures. He rolls his eyes.
I am sorry you still have to live with triggers from the War. I saw glimpses of what you went through those months in 6th and 7th year; I can only imagine the lasting damage of living in and contributing to that environment. Your tenacity and resilience are truly commendable, not because you have ‘reformed’, but because you have survived at all. You have done what I have been unable to, what many have been unable to: live. You, Malfoy, are a force of nature.
The Reward Challenge involved eating bugs. And grubs. And also a pig's brain. According to Harry, a reward of steak kebabs and iced tea was not worth it. Incidentally, Harry also did not seem to care if anyone
I have some problems like that, too. Recently, a delivery man from the Owl Emporium brought me a new supply of owl treats for Artemisia, and the poor sod used the same aftershave potion as my Uncle Rodolphus. My magic went rogue, striking sparks in the poor bloke’s direction and giving him a fright.
Harry lent him a hand, pulling him to his feet and Apparating them to the grassy clearing beside their favorite waterfall. It was in the lazy hours of the afternoon, and most of their tribemates were asleep in a post-Reward coma.
By the time they got back to camp, Draco felt like the bonfire had been burning his emotional stamina rather than oxygen. The Survivor drama had started, and now it couldn’t be stopped.
“What’s going on with you and Harry?” she asked, and Draco laughed stiffly. He and Harry were still not on speaking terms, and they interacted only in polite small talk and in the company of their alliance. Even Lindsay had mentioned that they ‘seemed to be getting along better’. He supposed that compared to their usual scathing banter, it did seem like they were getting along, but in Harry-and-Draco world, getting along meant there was something very, very wrong.
This work is part of "Lights, Camera, Drarry" (LCDrarry), a film-, TV- and theatre-inspired Drarry fest.
“If I wanted to steal a wand and run, I’d have done so already, Potter. I’m irresistibly charming-- haven’t you noticed? In fact, I’m insulted you think, if I were to rob someone, I’d be dumb enough to rob you. You’re disgustingly famous.”
“Alright, Castaways, let’s not dawdle,” he said. “Today’s Reward Challenge is an old-school tug-of-war. If either tribe can pull the rope ten feet towards their side, they win. The best of three goes home with Reward. Would you like to see what you are playing for?”
Draco clicked instantly with the assertive woman, Isabelle, who had directed the challenge strategy. She was, apparently, from Oakland, California and worked for the Bay Area FBI branch. She had long cornrows, a slightly crooked tooth that Draco assumed had once been knocked out, and an intelligent way of speaking that Draco learned was, despite its brusqueness, incredibly thoughtful. Nothing Draco told her about himself was true, but she proved an excellent listener anyway. Even her racerback tank top and hiking pants exuded the air of a person who knew exactly what they were doing. Draco hoped they had a lot in common.
that it was impossible to pretend she wasn’t there at all. Resigning himself to his fate, Draco faked a toothy smile and turned to face her.
Ron appeared at Harry’s shoulder. “Rose and Rhea have their hearts set on Hotel for Dogs again,” he said.
“Third person voted out of Survivor Wa’ab… Doug. Now that the votes are read, the decision is final. It’s time to bring me your torch. The tribe has spoken.”
I think I should end the letter here. My mother sends you her greetings. She thanks you for asking about her and wants me to tell you that she is fine. The chocolates that I sent with this message are actually from her.
“I’m sure Harry’s told you he’s planning on moving in. But you see-- he wants a garden, and I plan to give him one. I had hoped you’d consult.”
Draco fought a growl of frustration. “No, that's okay. Harry’s waiting for me, and we only need two people.”
Harry, it turned out, was right. Harry was right about a lot of things he had said on the Reward Trip, excluding some blatant exaggerations regarding Draco’s sexual prowess, but, namely, he was right about Jones self-destructing his own majority alliance. Currently, it was Jones, Claire, CJ, and Jessie against just Iz, Harry, and Draco. At the past Tribal Council, Lonnie had been booted on a rock draw.
“Actually I’m alright, thank you,” Draco muttered, blushing. When had Weasley become so bloody astute? He stared down at his portfolio and busied himself with his quill. Time to refocus.
Draco gently pushed Harry further away and tucked himself back inside his trousers, watching Harry do the same. It was a strangely erotic visual, and when they were done, they both instantly leaned in for another kiss, this one starting out rough and then gradually turning into the gentlest one yet, a whisper of lips against lips. Draco felt as if he was on a cloud. He felt light. He felt perfect.
Malfoy hesitates, leaning back on his heel as he watches. “I wonder if it’s possible to see all of a person at once?”
Note: Rai stones are a very real historical artifacts with real significance to the indigenous people of the Yap islands. Everything about them in this fic is entirely made up, and it is not my intention to appropriate, sensationalize, or spread false information about a culture I know very little about. I encourage you to research real Rai stones: they are very cool.
“I agree,” Lindsay said. “I don’t like how he treated Isabelle in the challenge, and he’s been so anal about chores. It’s like he thinks we all need someone to take care of us.”
“But--” he protested, and Harry closed the screen with an insistent hand. It was all tooth-rottingly cliche.
Draco hadn’t seen it either, and he didn’t remember moving it. Also, there was the slight issue that the living room smelled overwhelmingly of sandalwood, teak, and pine.
Muggles would call the way your brain works ADHD. Wix usually refer to someone with ADHD as Kinetomagical. Wizarding scientists have only examined it in relation to magical activities that require meditation or concentrating over a longer time. The Muggle approach to studying it is more profound.
“I don’t see any glass anywhere!” countered Harry, throwing his hands up. Ichibod hiccoughed from the direction of the couch.
He’s not prepared for it when Hagrid finds him in the garden. “Harry, my boy!” Hagrid declares. Harry winces when a slap lands on his back. “Come back to my hut. Jus’ like e’ old times.”
Most of his thinking power, however, was spent attempting to orchestrate his alliance. Lonnie naively offered to talk to Tara, and Draco was happy to let him take one for the team. When Harry had started to warn him that maybe he was in over his head, Draco had kicked him from across the hammock.
You are not alone in this difficulty to keep still or force your attention to go the way you are expected to, and, to be honest, hearing this from you doesn’t come as a surprise to me.
They’d only been there for half an hour when Pansy had given an indignant shriek and told them to get out. Harry couldn’t blame her. From the moment they stepped through the door, it was chaos. The door had slammed shut behind them without being touched, and nothing would get it to open again, then the tin in which Pansy kept her Floo powder had mysteriously toppled off the mantelpiece and smashed open, spilling the powder everywhere. To top it off, one of Pansy’s beloved scatter cushions had burst open.
Draco grins, victorious and taunting and delighted and tender. “I married you, didn’t I? What’s mine is yours.”
Draco smiles, eyebrow raised and grin slightly lopsided in a not-so-accidental smirk. “Who knew exhibitionsim got you off like this. We could have tried it sooner.”
Pansy was late, as usual. She burst through the Floo, her daughter Ellie clinging to her hand and Blaise’s son Jake running circles around his godmother. “Come to drop off the litter!” she announced.
“Castaways,” Jeff began as he sauntered into view from behind the captain’s wheel, “Welcome to the 25th season of Survivor. You have been divided into two tribes, Ngael and  Nge’k. Ngael, you represent the West Coast, and your color will be turquoise. Nge’k you are from the East, and your color will be orange. Over the next 39 days, you will compete in a gruelling game to Outwit, Outlast, and Outplay your opponents to prove yourself as the Sole Survivor. In a moment, we will get started with our first Reward Challenge of the season, but first, let’s hear a little from our players; Harry, would you like to speak about what the game of Survivor means to you?”
Stomachs full, they basked in the shade of a red striped umbrella. “The Rai stones are incredible, Hermione. I can’t quite figure them out, but god, you would love them. I wish you could see. Their magic is like nothing I’ve ever encountered,” he told her.
Harry fixes a bubble bath for them both, pouring in just the right amount of lavender potion and testing the water with his foot before helping Draco in. Harry steps in next, drawing Draco to his chest. “You’re pretty,” Draco whispers.
“Draco dips in with one digit, and then two, opening him up with efficient precision, but indulging in rhythmic pumps against Harry’s prostate. “Yes. God, yes. Merlin.”
He didn’t bother with a real breakfast, but brewed coffee with the Keurig in the kitchen. He found cantaloupe in the fridge, and nibbled a slice on the window-nook as he waited for the beans he’d ground to steep. The machine dinged, and he summoned the pot lazily with a swish of his hand. Before pouring it into a to-go tumbler, he snapped his fingers, and frosty condensation appeared on the outside of the pot; he preferred his coffee iced.
“Ooh,” he says, crouching down to get a closer look at Luna’s cart, “Black Eyed Suzies! Are these from your garden?” Draco shudders-- he’s seen Black Eyed Suzies, and they’re exactly what one would imagine: pupil, iris, lid, lashes, and all.
Footsteps echo through the deserted courtyard, familiar despite the fact that Harry hasn’t ever been here when it’s lonely. His nails leave goose pimples as they catalog his body.
The charm is working well, but I still don’t think it looks right on me. You might have to take a closer inspection…
Hermione and Ron’s television was hidden behind a clever charm that transformed it into a coffee table when not in use. Harry transfigured it back with a flick of his wand, pulling out the crate of DVDs and leafing through them with a smile on his face. He picked up the top stack-- the most watched movies-- thumbing the worn plastic. There was something fun about reading the covers of films he’d seen dozens of times, just to find out which still-frames were deemed worthy of a feature.
Harry climbs like he casts; raw and gritty and imprecise, but with such intentioned emotion that his sheer power never runs astray. He is surprisingly methodical, using random jugs on the wall to pull himself into position and practicing the same move over and over. Every time he jumps, another lock of wild raven curls escapes his bun.
“I can see,” he replies. “Neville filled you in, I take?” He leads her towards the kissing gate that opens up to his back garden, suddenly excited to show off his project.
“Of course,” Draco says, a little too loud, but when Harry rises to his knees, Draco stops him with a frantic hand. “Actually, can we do your place? There’s construction outside today.”
A smiling crewmember placed their feast in the ornate Tree-Mail basket shortly past 11 in the morning. Harry was still fast asleep, but Draco was long since up, pacing the woods as he rehearsed his Jury speech.
In the remedial amount of research that I have done, I know that the core of a wizard does not in itself produce magic, but instead creates a sort of charge that induces a force on the magical field in the atmosphere around it. When a spell is performed or interacted with, the wizard shifts their core, creating what is akin to a magnetic flux and transforming magical potential energy into other types of energy in the physical world.
“Ready?” Harry whispers. His lids shut, mouth shaping the vowels of an incantation. In a second, Draco is naked and slick. Harry’s legs slide up his hips, ankles crossed at the base of his spine. He is so, so ready.
“No, but I really don’t think this is a regular toad,” Harry replied. “I’m not taking any chances. The deeper it is, the less chance of him getting out.”
“I love nature, and my garden is my favourite place in the whole world. I have a cat named after a mathematician. My University research thesis is my proudest achievement. I watch Survivor obsessively every Wednesday and my partner always falls asleep, but when we watch his shows, I do my best to stay awake.”
“Draco, I’m fine. I think I was just trying to manifest an explanation, rationalize how I could have done something so awful, even at the cost of myself. But the reality is that the world is unpredictable. I’m okay. What’s not okay is that I had to figure it out on my own.”
“Perfect,” Draco says. “I was wondering if you could come over after work. I wanted to show you something.” Ron’s freckled face pops out from behind a corner, and he flashes Draco a thumbs up, waggling his eyebrows. Draco’s really going to need to talk to Neville about the definition of a ‘secret’.
He takes two steps forward and hesitates on the third. “What are you doing, Malfoy?” he asks, bitter and commanding. “What’s in your hand?”
“Harry. Harry, really, I’ve got to go.” Draco pulls his jacket off the back of a rustic wooden chair. The cafe has been painted pale yellow and robin-egg blue, and a bucolic hum of birdsong has been charmed to play through the dining area.
Draco just carries on. “That bloody piece of junk was built in the stone age-- the noise it makes, that can’t be right. And what even
“I don’t want to promise,” Harry says. “I want to choose. Every day I want to get to choose. Nothing feels better than choosing you.”
He starts with one finger, conjuring lube with a snap and pumping lazily, barely brushing Harry’s prostate with each supine stroke. Harry is bucking back unevenly, breaths heaving around desperate mewls. In this position, he is unable to reach for his cock. “Ah, ah. A ringlock will get you nowhere here,” he gasps. “Better go for the full hand-jamb.”
Draco donned his sweetest, most soothing tone. “I know, love. It’s okay. Why don’t we go back to bed.”
had been stolen away. Survivor was something that he loved and that Harry tolerated, so why did he suddenly feel so incredibly inadequate?
Draco tried again, this time landing the front end of his wave of water into the elevator pail. He raced up the structure, the pail ascending quick and easy with a few rotations on the handle. Then he did it again. At one point, Jessie growled with rabid irritation. Draco shared the sentiment. The silver lining was, according to Jeff’s constant snarky commentary, everyone else was faring just as poorly as he was.
And Merlin, Harry was indeed gorgeous. He had shaved clean again, although Draco had asked him to keep some stubble, and his jaw was sharp and chiseled, his chapped lips full. Both of them were struggling to regain muscle mass, but a temporary soft patch had formed beneath Harry’s belly button, and Draco liked it very much. His dark hair was thick, flouncing around his shoulders as he walked, and his skin was tanner than it had ever been. Even better was their unofficial no-clothes-in-the-suite policy.
My work on your case will be limited on the academic side on the one hand and on the technical maintenance of your McKinnon amulet. I believe that after we have found out what aggravated your situation, my colleagues can handle everything well.
“Fine by me,” Draco agreed. “When we go back up to the school, we’ll have to find Hagrid to see if he knows what Ichabod will eat.”
Draco shook his head and reached into the tank, gently lifting the toad out with one hand and placing him onto his free arm where he sat perfectly still. “See!”
“Well, what are you waiting for, Potter,” he snarked. “The cuisine not up to your standard? I didn’t think the bar was very high.” Harry shot him a glowering pout but said nothing. “Cat got your tongue? If you’re smart enough not to talk back, maybe there’s hope after all. See, you're meant to pick up the food on your plate, and then you're meant to eat it. It’s simple, really, and I’ve already given a demonstration!”
When it was Draco’s turn to step up to the pedestal, he was up against Marissa, who, while boring, was one damn tough cookie. When Jeff lifted the cover, the spectating contestants blanched, but Draco just grit his teeth, took a deep breath through his nose, and shoved the thing down his throat, careful to chew in a way that avoided spreading the disgusting, gooey larvae over his taste buds.
He sets them up with lawn chairs and bottles of an effervescent fermented tea that Harry adores, tuning the wireless to a jazz station and leaning back in the sun.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said with a twisted grin. “By the time I’m done with you, you’ll be sufficiently sweaty again.”
Draco slaps back-- there is something uniquely disarming about Neville’s smile. “I hope I didn’t keep you long. Harry demanded pudding.”
“Castaways,” Jeff started, “welcome to your first Immunity Challenge. Both teams will navigate a series of wooden obstacles. Each obstacle is on a separate free-floating dock. To reach the next obstacle, one tribe member must dive below the dock they are currently on. There they will untie and retrieve a rope with a weight on the end. The first rope is secured 4 feet underwater, but they will increase in depth up to 15 feet. You will then toss the weighted end of the rope into a hoop on the upcoming obstacle’s raft and drag it towards you until it is close enough to step onto. If anyone falls into the water while attempting to cross an obstacle, they must restart it. The weighted ball at the end of each rope will have a key tied to it. You will collect all six of the keys and use them on the last obstacle to unlock a machete. First to use their machete to cut the twine securing their flag wins. The winner is safe from Tribal Council. Losers, I will see you tonight where one of you will be the first person voted out of Survivor Wa’ab.”
He was laid out in the sand alongside a clothesline that dripped a steady metronome of white noise onto a piece of driftwood. His hair was covered with the turquoise-green of his buff, and he thought the colour rather suited his eyes.
He throws himself into the first dark cabin he finds. With the curtain shut, it is quiet except for the hum of the engine. Even that is too loud, too overwhelming. It fills him up until his skin feels tight.
“I found something!” he said, “It doesn’t feel as powerful as I expected, but we got one that hasn’t been museum-hopping since the British came in and stole the place.”
“No, no. Ichabod is fine,” Harry said hastily. “I’m sure I’ll get used to it. Right, is this cave okay for him?”
Harry took it upon himself to get sloppy drunk on shitty, too sweet champagne. He’d lost about 20 pounds, and had clearly no clue where his tolerance lay. That, or he simply did not care.
I’m so glad that Robert Service has piqued your interest. Could I interest you in any more nature poets and essayists? I am rather well educated. If I can’t be in nature myself, I read instead. When I am at my most reckless and my magic at its most volatile, I sometimes apparate to the alps (rather far, but, again, I’m special, aren’t I?) and run through the mountain trails until I can’t anymore. I’ve spent many a night sleeping under the stars and snow, feeling the stones and the moss beneath my feet. No literature could capture that feeling, but something about you makes me want to keep looking. I want you to read it; I want you to read me.
“You wanted to vote out Harry last Tribal,” she said with forced terseness. “We can make it happen in this one. He’s a threat; everyone likes him, he hasn’t screwed anyone over, and he’s loyal. Emotional votes will go to him. But if I’m up there beside you, well, they’re ambivalent towards you and they hate me. I won’t be getting any emotional appeals.”
With the charming members of the tribe occupied, external conversation curbed to a halt. Ian sat leaning against the hull of the speedboat, listening along to Harry and Lonnie with mild interest. Isabelle broke the ice stiffly, introducing herself skittishly to the remaining East Coast contestants. Draco flinched at the volume of the response, the man’s coarse Boston drawl grating his nerves. His name, apparently, was Jones, and he was a consultant. Draco wondered what kind.
By late afternoon, Draco’s teeth were smooth and clean, and his throat free of exoskeletons, bitter grit, and crawly things, and the sun was custard-yellow and warm. He had a constant peeling sun-burn going, but he was growing fond of the pleasant, sleepy feeling of being baked. It helped soothe his aching muscles and distract from the ever-present hunger.
And how is the McKinnon amulet working? Is it easier to control how much energy you use when casting a spell? As I told you, you shouldn’t wear it 24/7, but you can wear it for three hours before both you and the amulet need a break for at least 7 hours.
If you will have me, I can still do lunch on Tuesday. I can’t promise I’ll show, or, given I do, if I’ll stay. I should probably talk to Bullstode, rather than worry you with my thoughts, but you might have to drag me there. Hermione and Gin tried to get me to go today. You’ll have to ask them whether they were successful.
After the insanity of Jones’s final Tribal, the alliances had shaken into rough twosomes of Draco and Isabelle along with CJ and Jessie. At the previous vote, CJ had been sent to the jury with a four to two majority, and Claire, lost without the guidance of Jones, had been taken under Harry’s guiding wing.
’. The surface of the Black Lake is still, the only movement a cascade of ripples timed to the cadence of their steps echoing through the cool, dark water.
Draco was good at focusing. He was good at compartmentalizing. On command, he could block everything out except for what was directly in front of him. His peripheral would darken, colours would dull, shapes would sharpen, and any noise not worth hearing would reduce to a steady hum. The trick to the challenge was to establish a rhythm, and Draco was looking forward to giving it his best shot.
The club is heady and overwhelming, and doesn’t feel nearly like the escape Harry craves. He staves away the fear that even this-- even the booming music, the stranger’s cologne, the neon signs washed out by strobe lights and techno-- won’t be enough to forget, even with another drink. He staves away today, and yesterday, and tomorrow with more drinks after that.
Jeff called go, and, suddenly, nothing else seemed to matter. The big picture was no more; only details remained. Draco took a calculated breath and dropped his first ball. His right hand, the non-dominant one, was tied behind his back, but he opened and closed his fist unconsciously, tapping his thumb to keep time.
Shit, have I exhausted all other points of discussion? Are we back to the nitty-gritty? Alright. The potion I took was a modified Draught of Peace, with the hellebore switched with powdered root of asphodel and sopophorous bean to mimic a Draught of Living Death. I also added a wit-sharpening potion to counteract the drowsiness and an experimental muffling potion that put a permanent glamour over my visible magical signature.
It was the third straight day of back-to-back challenges, and Draco could have sworn the quarter-mile slog from the beach drop-off point to the competition site took 45 minutes. When they finally padded around the corner, CJ groaned from the front of the line. Eight tall, grooved poles rose from a sandy flat at the center of a shady glen.
Ron’s retort was cut off by a ruckus of pattering feet, greasy fingers, squealing, and roughhousing.
When he turned back to Jeff, he was wearing a massive, ear-to-ear grin. Iz gave him a cuff across the shoulder and a fidgety hug. She was clearly thrilled. Harry smirked and mouthed ‘I’m proud of you.’
He kisses Draco instead. The first brush of lips is as impulsive and clumsy as he is. Draco is the first to turn it filthy.
I have spent the past several years confined to my house. In that time, I have done my share of sulking, of screaming, of cursing the injustices of the world. I have also, in stubborn refusal to ask for help, attempted to understand how the human magical core works, in hopes that I can fix my issues without professional interference.
it seems to me I have to write two letters to you, one about healing your magic, and the other about you and me. I write them on a single paper, one on each side. A charm ensures that this introduction appears on the side you read first, no matter which one it is. With you, I can’t limit things to the professional, and my feelings refuse to wait in line to be written into the lower part of the letter. I can only flip the paper over again and again to give you concise answers about your magical and mental health and put the things I feel in one place.
She looked at him, brown eyes bright and wide. “If there was a clue, maybe. But there hasn’t been. We know a new Idol has been hidden, but there haven’t been any Rewards for clues to be found at, no people disappearing from camp in the daylight, nothing. It has to be somewhere we’d expect it to be.”
Then, as soon as the Council commenced, Jones’ pockmarked, leathery cheeks split in a Pennywise-grin. He pulled the neat roll of parchment from the tote in his lap, slid it from it’s twine, and smoothed it out with grimy, coal smeared fingers. From the Juror’s stands, Marissa leaned forward in her seat, elbows on her knees. Ben giggled, hand covering his mouth.
Lonnie smiled with a nod. He probably knew it wasn’t the full truth, but what Harry had said was hardly a lie-- even if he hadn’t realized it before arriving on the island.
“We should go for flint and tarps first. Everything seems to be secured with ropes, so we should choose the people who are best with knots to collect items. Someone faster and smaller can switch to attacking the other tribe after the first minute. We should also have two people guard our mat. What do people want to do?”
Draco’s back had erupted into hundreds of freckles and a blotchy tan, and Harry counted them with the pad of his finger, using an orb of light above them to see. Draco lay on his stomach. Eyes closed, he ran his knuckle over Harry’s ribs, down over his hip and against the coarse grain of his powerful thighs.
Ron had already started on dinner-- a barbeque spread of brats, coleslaw, beans, and sweet potato fries. It smelled delicious; Harry had been living off watermelon and ritz crackers since morning. Hoping Ron and Luna could handle serving the kids, Harry slipped inside through the open screen door.
“We make Doug paranoid by isolating him. I invite Marissa or Ian or Lindsay or any combination of those people out for chores or swims until Doug gets the message that he’s an outsider. He’ll start asking questions, and the alliance will turn on him because, subconsciously, they
“I don’t know, Potter. We’re meant to research ones that haven’t been heavily trafficked.” He pressed his lips together on the first syllable of ‘Potter,’ pronouncing it with a traditional Malfoy sneer.
However, if he did this, it would also maximize the amount of torque needed to turn the handle, which, when the bucket was filled with water, might be too much for Draco to lift. He also had to make sure he achieved his intended gear ratio using as few parts as possible, to avoid losing energy to friction.
“No, not pulled. I have a joint I was going to smoke. If I keep it all to myself, it’ll make me throw up.”
Harry sits down beside him. It is odd enough to make him feel alive. He is numb enough that it doesn’t make him want to run.
“Welcome to your final Immunity Challenge. Losers, you may be the last player voted off Survivor Wa’ab. Winner, you are guaranteed a place in the Final Three and a chance to plead your case to the Jury,” Jeff greeted. “This challenge is complex, so listen closely. To begin, you will climb to the top of your platform where you will configure a set of gears to lift a pulley. This pulley will raise and lower a bucket from the bottom of the structure. There are many ways to configure the gears, but some will be more favorable than others.
Harry Apparates them straight to their bedroom, tongue down Draco’s throat and a hand shoved into his trousers to get one finger on the wand holstered to his thigh.
4) I, and my own owl, Artemisia, would like Desdemona to visit us tomorrow, when the dittany has done its work to pick up a protective leg ring that I made for her according to an old Black family owl-keeping instruction. Don’t give her a letter to carry. If your magic is always eager to get the letters to me, we have to make it easier for Desdemona.
Harry rolls his eyes, embarrassment evidently dissolved (but awkwardness nothing short of permanent). Picking up his chalk bag, he ambles towards the cave, waving Draco a sardonic adieu.
“You want her opening that can of worms at Tribal? Absolutely not. Get your head back on, you infuriating, insufferable prick.”
He broached the subject while helping Harry untie the tarp from the top of the shelter. A sheen of sweat coated his skin in the humid noon-heat, and a lock of his hair had fallen loose from the bun at the nape of his neck. Draco reached out and tucked it behind his ear gently, smearing the drip of perspiration on his temple up and away from his eye.
They landed in the thick undergrowth of a deep jungle. The moon rays rippled a watery teal through the filter of foliage. There didn’t appear to have been people around for a very long time, but the forest teemed with life.
My offer is this: to provide you with myself and my magic for the purpose of studying, without limitations or ulterior constraints. I am willing to remove my emotions and my desires from this interaction as much as I am able.
Neville’s laughter echoes through the stoop, harmonizing the wind chimes and distant drone of city traffic. He is easy to amuse. “What can I do for ya.”
to be. Draco was having trouble sleeping anyway, and he saw no harm in getting a headstart on the paper summarizing his Rai stone research.
“You don’t need to apologize. But I wanted you to know. We work best together. We help each other,” Harry said gently. He stepped forward, placed a broad hand on Draco’s bony shoulder.
He gave her a long hug, blinking back tears, and then her torch was extinguished with a gentle puff. It finally hit Draco that his Survivor experience was coming to a close. Characters were disappearing, plotlines closing, and, after over a month of mystery and misery, the adventure he had dreamed of was nearing climax.
The morning of the first Immunity Challenge, Tara coached them all through a round of yoga. It was torturous, so Draco planted himself right where he could get the best view of Harry’s arse. Harry even sent him a cheeky smile during downward dog, but it did nothing to ebb Draco’s growing disconnect with his husband. He really hated sharing.
I have never heard of Robert Service before, but his poems are beautiful. The Oscar Wilde book is exactly the one my ex never returned to me after our breakup, and that I never got around to buying it again. It’s a funny bit of irony that you were the one to gift me this book again. I’m sorry if I’m being unclear. I think I’m getting a bit drowsy and have stopped making sense.
“You know, like, sticking your fingers into the t-nuts. Like, where the shaft of a screw goes. Fuck.”
Draco sighed dramatically. “Really, Harry? You could charm a Grindylow. Tell Claire that Jessie has made more big moves in the game, and that, even if they don’t like her, the Jury will respect a player that did whatever they thought was best for their game, regardless of consequences.”
Harry chokes on a moan, and Draco yanks him flush, chest to chest. The desperate groping of his hand tangles in the corset’s intricate lacing in the same moment Draco’s teeth close over his pulsepoint, and he just about comes. Every sensation is heightened; blood and trumpet and keyboard rush in his ears. Draco’s skin is hot-- so hot-- but the ribbons on his back are cool to the touch.
Draco listened, entranced. He was surrounded by people in Britain whose life stories were all identical. Everyone had been through hell, but everyone had been through the same hell, and the exceptions were public knowledge. It had never occurred to Draco just how varied the world really was.
“No, now that you mention it, he doesn't, does he?” Draco mused, gazing at Ichabod for a moment before shrugging. “Oh well. I’ll just make it slightly balmy for now. We may have to visit the library when we get back to the school.”
He tries to sit up, but Harry catches him as he turns to his back in a show of martial-arts agility that has Draco cursing how he could have ever teased this man for being clumsy or oafish or anything less than perfect.
“We need to get a proper tank for him, you know,” Harry said as Draco set the small tank down on the kitchen table. “This one is too small to be permanent.”
Malfoy sheds his shirt, too, and sits, rocking down to his back and laying wide-open to the sky, platinum hair and freckled shoulders against a century of pebbles and dust. Harry stares because he can.
Draco moved closer to the table and nodded. “That’s brilliant. Nice and dark, I think he’ll like that.”
Draco collapsed onto his forearms, and the manic scaffolding he had built in his brain crumbled around him. Merlin, he was exhausted.
“I think you’ll be allowed home now that you’re awake,” Draco replied. “I’ll go and get a Healer to come and look at you.”
“I used to sit here and read,” Malfoy murmurs, “and the fairies would whisper, just too quiet for me to make out, and I would think
A healthy, normal wizard’s core only incites magical particles to deviate from a state of equilibrium when it has reason to, whether that be because a spell has been cast by, on, or around them.
He waved Harry over with a conspicuous flap of his hand, mouthing ‘save me’ and feigning a stroke. Harry rolled his eyes and ambled to meet him near the Tree-Mail box.
When water was boiling and rice portioned into the pot, Jones sidled into Draco’s blind spot, standing over his shoulder so he had no choice but to remain seated and crane his neck.
“Well, just be careful with him,” Harry said warily, watching as Ichabod made his way over to the side of his tank and placed one foot up on the glass.
3) If it is convenient for you, I would like to come by and bring you the tests today at 5 pm. There is no need to send Desdemona today to confirm or postpone the appointment. Just Floo me. Your magic was very eager to see me today, and, while I examined Desdemona and didn’t see any new injuries, I think we should not have her work before tomorrow, especially not for a message with a maximum of five words.
Draco dashes into frame from a curtained booth in the corner of the stage. An apron has been tied around his waist, the black linen dotted with electric blues and yellows. A bit of fluorescent orange has made its way to his cheek.
This shouldn’t be news to you. You told me that when Sirius lived in Grimmauld Place he had depression and drank too much firewhiskey. In addition to the residual effects of Azkaban and the grief associated with the loss of your parents, I believe the House itself was contributing to Sirius’s mental health. It preyed on his frustration, traumatic memories, and fear, making him hyper focused on his failure to protect his loved ones. Likely the only reason the house did not attack the two living members of Sirius’s found-family, you and professor Lupin, as it attacked me yesterday, is because the magic in the house sensed that the latent danger you were already in was more harmful to Sirius than any physical damage it could do.
“Sorry, Harry, I don’t,” Hagrid replied with a shrug. “He did say he was an exotic species, that’s all I know.”
“Your alliance consists of Doug, Ian, Lindsay, and Marissa. Doug might be our best bet to target. Everyone has sort of fallen under his wing because he’s older and commanding, but we can use that. Either Lindsay or Ian might be insecure enough to flip if we plant the seed. The question is, how do we tell them they’re sheeple for following him without explicitly telling them they’re sheeple for following him?”
Harry summons his holly wand from the holster at his thigh with a snap of his fingers, holding it just out of reach. “The Wizengamot would say this is an astronomically bad idea.”
“I guess I didn’t mean it,” Draco said sadly, and Harry pulled him into a hug, summoning both of their wands from where they were hidden outside of camp and apparating them away without warning.
Harry hummed in agreement. “Good point. Well, I’ll only be able to do fake ones for now anyway, so it shouldn’t be a problem.”
“I just want to start over, but I can’t. I can’t, or I wont, or I don’t even know! I still hate you! I fucking hate you, Malfoy. Why can’t I just have this one thing? Is this it? Is this what my life will be? I want a
Pansy sounds like a gem. I’d love to meet her sometime-- when she’s not dangling off Ginny’s lap. I’ve seen them thrice in as many months, I don’t think either has said a word that wasn’t not whispered into the other’s ear. They look happy. It’s awfully sweet-- and awfully disgusting.
Hermione, Ron, and Ron’s extended family helped me move into a cottage in Devon. They have helped care for me over the past 2 years, and I could not be more grateful. However, a major reason I have finally decided to seek professional help is so that I will no longer have to leech from my family in order to survive. One day, I hope to give back some of what they have given me, but today, I can only bring worry and heartbreak.
Continuing his customary commentary, Jeff’s jaw hung open in awe. “There’s a lot of tension around here. It almost seems flirtatious. Frankly, I don’t know what I’m listening in on.” He addressed the seated row of other contestants, “Do you?”
Several of my friends have offered to write this letter for me, but I refused; I have been running from my past for far too long as is, and a proposition such as this one can only work if I am entirely transparent.
Jones cleared his throat loftily. “This voucher grants you an extra vote at any of the next five Tribal Councils. You may write on the blank side of this sheet and cast it in the urn in addition to your regular vote, and it will be counted against the player whose name you have written down.”
Harry, it’s not a new thing for me to have feelings for you. The first time I saw you at Madam Malkin’s, I think I knew. I didn’t know what to do with those feelings.
