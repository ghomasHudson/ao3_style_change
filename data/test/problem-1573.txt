"No. If you go on this date then I will never talk to you again." Ron threatened and Harry's eyes glistened with tears.
"Draco I-"
"Good news, the baby is healthy and fine, a bit shook up but overall is very healthy." The tan Medi-witch with dark hair smiled sadly at him before turning to her working.
"You're lying."
"Whatever Ron." Hermione scoffed and opened the bathroom door, stomping out. Ron hot on her tail, calling out her name before the bathroom door slammed shut.
Lucius couldn't help his good mood, his son returning to him and asking to stay home for a few days was the best thing to happen to him in a long time. He sat in his office, savoring two fingers of elven wine as more plans formed in his mind. He had to keep the Potter slut from his son in all ways. No letters, no floo calls, no meeting.
"That is a very interesting idea, Harrison." Lucius leaned back and took a sip of his tea. "I may just have to talk with some unspeakable, some of the Board members to have it a law that every Muggle-born take an inheritance test."
Everyone was silent, waiting to see what Harry would do while the Staff - except Umbridge - and the Head Boys/Girls took points away under their breath.
"Stand him up!" Ron was practically shaking in anger, Harry winced at the volume of his voice.
"Says the Slytherin straddling me." Potter pointedly looked at where their hips met.
"I'll find you for the next feeding." Draco promised before slipping into the shadows and disappearing from the hidden room.
"Well, well, well." Harry turned to see a boy slightly taller than him, with platinum blond hair, startling gray eyes and an overall regal air around him.
"He's funny, always makes me laugh when I'm down. He's great as chess and is always patient when I need help, always pushes me to be my best. He'd never turn on me and-"
"Harry, some people are here, and they would like to speak with you." Professor Snape's voice called through the painting. Trusting the man to not bring any bad people to him, he quickly made his way to the front room and opened the painting to see just over a dozen men and women. He silently let them in and stood very near Professor Snape. He didn't recognize most of the people and was a little overwhelmed. "Harry this is Madame Bones, the Aurors have already collected Dumbledore, Granger, and the Weasleys. She is here to talk to you."
Harry gave silent sobs of relief, he wanted a family more than anything but he didn't know if he could ever look at his own child conceived of rape and not think of the worst night of his life. He wanted children with someone he loved, not with a greedy murderous witch.
"Yessir." Harry lowered his head even more and pulled out his Potion text and parchment before going back to his text and began reading on the Antidote. He sighed in relief when the Potion Professor left to supervise the other side of the classroom.
"I do have my own money you know." Harry giggled when Draco dug his fingers into Harry's sides, tickling him and swirling them around, the borrowed Slytherin beanie slipping off of Harry's head as he laughed and squirmed.
Severus could only sigh when he saw the nearly collapsed child slumped against the tub; saliva dribbled down his chin, the stench of vomit made it clear what had happened just before the child passed out. Flushing the loo Severus crouched down next to the small fourteen-year-old, he pulled out a handkerchief and wiped away the sweat and saliva before casting a breath-freshening charm on the Gryffindor. He gave some thought before decided the Muggle way would do, he slid his arms under the boy and rose, grimacing at the popping his joints gave, he was getting too old for this Severus thought as he settled the boy on the bed.
"So-So hun-h-hungry." He gasped out. It was only then that Harry noticed the porcelain white fangs that gleamed under the moonlight that shone through the large windows that lined the corridors. Harry could feel his hero complex kicking into gear as he immediately lifted his bleeding hand to Draco's lips without a second hesitation. He watched silently when Draco's lips sealed around the wound. His eyes flashed silver before his fangs pierced the flesh.
"Draco this is going to cast a load, I can't let you buy all of this." Harry tried to place items on the shelves but Draco just puts them back and locked both of Harry's hands with his own.
"Father! Tippy said I could find you in he-" Draco's joyous voice was abruptly cut off. "WHAT IS THAT HALFBLOOD SCUM DOING HERE?!" He shouted in outrage. His son's outburst seemed to be the breaking point because the raven-haired teen snapped, his magic suffocated the room, his sobs and screams were deafening. Everything in the room was thrown into the air and the temperature fluctuated between freezing and boiling temperatures.
"Maybe we should, a nice room for a night, some fancy romantic dinner, some slow music and maybe a little dancing-" Draco was cut off by Ron's shout of anger.
"That woman!" Severus hissed.
"Won't they just ignore it once they find out it's a marriage contract?" Harry asked nervously.
alert Professor Snape and Umbridge of your wanderings around the castle at night."
"Your father is not how I expected," Harry admitted shyly as Draco pulled him along the aisles of Honeydukes.
"Do you think he went down there?" Ron asked.
It was only two days later that Draco cornered Harry in a boy's bathroom again. "I've got the draft." He pulled out his wand and warded the bathroom to repel others and so that no one could hear anything said between them.
"Yessss." Harry hissed, taking in the scent of the vampire.
Draco jumped to his feet when the flames flared green; he gently pulled the nearly catatonic Gryffindor to the couch just in time for his uncle to step through. The man sighed at the sight in front of him before pulling out a calming draught and gently tipping Harry's head back and let the boy drink the Potion.
Lucius only nodded and quickly made use of the floo in the office and quickly made his way through to each of the Governor's houses, collecting the men and woman as he said he would in the letter he had written and sent the night before.
"This is terrible Harry! We've got to get you out of this!" Ginny leaned forward and set her hand on Harry's thigh, it made him a bit uncomfortable.
"I think you should go to Gringotts, see if you have any more," Draco suggested and Harry nodded.
"Shut up Malfoy!" Ginny screamed. "Harry is mine! He's supposed to marry me!" She screeched.
-----
Aurors walked down the hall and stopped in front of the Muggleborn's cell; they stupefied her through the bars and quickly levitated her out; the first trial was ready to begin.
Potions was better than usual, entirely because Severus ignored him instead of lashing out at him, he verbally flayed Ron and Seamus, both ruined the points with their partners Hermione and Dean respectively. Harry was partnered with Neville, and while that usually meant the focus of Snape's attention, Harry worked hard to keep Neville for ruining the Potion, and with Draco not trying to sabotage, Harry was successful. However, the liquid was a few shades lighter than intended; it was one of the top potions in the class. Professor Snape had kept his face blank but let his tone reluctantly admit their Potion was 'adequate' before sweeping over to the other Gryffindor potions and banishing them away with a snarl of 'pathetic.'
"No, I was just looking for him. He left dinner pretty early." Hermione's voice was even closer than Ron's. "I was thinking he might be in here, Ya know he comes here when he gets upset."
"You're not my girlfriend." Harry furrowed his eyebrows at the anger that crossed Ginny's, Hermione's and Ron's faces. "I never asked you out nor did you ask me and even if you did I wouldn't say yes." Harry pulled his arm back to his chest. He took a few steps back.
"You're a wizard, you could have used magic to do that, but instead you're doing it the Muggle way." Harry gibed, a smile on his lips when the blond jumped off of with a disgusted look on his pale face. "Thanks." He rolled his eyes as he stood and walked past the glaring Slytherin.
"Who were you with?"
"Did Luna find you?" Harry asked, a small smile on his lips.
eat vegetables, a lot of them, lean meats, fruit and nothing junkie." Draco listed, smirking when Harry just nodded. "Good boy, now run along and get sleep. Do not tell anyone of our
Draco watched silently, guilt building in his gut while subtle hunger itched his throat as the scene played out before him. Potter looked so tired, dead on his feet, with a permeant frown on his face. The two youngest Weasley's were angry and when Ron listed his wand to Harry's turned back Draco felt a spark of anger and dread hitch his breath. He only let out a sigh of relief when the Twin Weasley's stood and blocked the poor stunner.
"Sod off Malfoy." Harry tilted his head back in exhaustion, wiping away his tears as he went to walk past the Slytherin only to be stopped by a pale hand clutching his elbow. "What?!" He hissed out between clenched teeth.
"Yeah, I mean Lord Malfoy could have done much more damage. He could have demanded an Absolute contract but if anything it's better for Harry than Malfoy." Neville passed the contract to Dean and Seamus who read it quickly.
"You will not have to sleep in the tower Mr. Potter," Snape assured, "You don't even have to keep your things there, I promise you."Â Harry gathered as much courage as possible; he feared Voldemort less than this and threw the floor powered into the flames and walked through before he could convince himself to stay.
"She's my sister, I didn't want her to get in trouble." A few of the Wizengamot members softened as his answer.
"S-Sure." Harry stayed silent as the other boy picked up his trunk and heaved it onto the shelves.
"What father?" Draco asked tiredly.
Instead of stupifying the boy the Aurors just let the chains fall and lifted the boy to his feet and took his arms and led him from the room.
Harry tugged his heavy trunk behind him, his arms ached from the weight as he struggled to find an empty compartment. A little over halfway down the train Harry has seated alone in a compartment. He knew without a doubt he would never be able to get his trunk onto the shelves so he just set it down by his feet before he sat down tiredly. His back hurt from the welts, his limbs were exhausted and overall he felt like he would never be able to move again.
He felt drained and he knew his magic was the only thing keeping him alive - just like at the Dursley's - and that if he lost much more blood he could die.
Sat next to Professor Snape Harry was curled in the chair, having watched Hermione's trial he had been horrified to learn that he was only worth some books and some money to the girl he had called his best friend. It was all he could do to prevent himself from analyzing each and every conversation or moment he had shared with the girl to see if he had missed any clues as to her true nature.
"Legal matters, I'm afraid." Sitting up straighter Amelia pulled out a bank file and waited for the man before her to list the basic details to copy it and put it in the system. "On behalf of my client, Harry Potter, I would like to press charges against Albus Dumbledore, Molly Weasley, Ronald Wesley, Ginerva Weasley, and Hermione Granger."
"I'm s-sorry." He hiccuped, voice drowning in emotion.
"Not as a Slytherin. But I'm here as Harry's Dominate, not a Slytherin." Nevile quickly opened the portrait and pointed to the dorms and smiled sadly to himself when Draco raced up the steps, calling out Harry's name gently.
"Against whom?" Lucius directed the question towards Harry who looked up nervously.
It was Professor's Snape warm and solid hand on his shoulder that kept Harry in the present. He desperately wished for the small comforts that holding Draco's hand had offered. His first day back to the school after the incident Harry had slowly pushed the blond away, the proximity and closeness were too much while stuck in the halls that had bared witness to the worst moment of his life. While safely cocooned in the Malfoy Manor Harry had been able to forget some of the horrible acts and had been able to fall slowly into the arms that Draco held open for him.
"Take me to him." Draco all but demanded, he knew that it started out all show but after a month he really was growing concerned over Harry.
after all.
-----
"I can afford it, it won't even put a dent in my vault." Draco set his basket on the counter and waited patiently as the girl counted up the prices.
"Fine!" Malfoy hissed and pulled Harry into an alcove before erecting Silencing Wards around them. "What is your plan exactly?"
"Hello, Narcissa." Harry accepted the hug hesitantly, tensing when the woman's arms tightened around him.
Draco wanted to scream, Blaise hadn't even lifted a brow in his direction when he told his friend's of the contract. Pansy was outraged, Daphne was sympathetic, Crabbe and Goyle were upset that Draco was upset, Theo was detached and Blaise didn't even care!
"Yes Harry, Sir." Dobby popped away just before Severus strode into the room, his robes billowing behind him like always, the familiarity bringing comfort to Harry.
"Maybe, but we can't very well check, now can we Ron?" Hermione's sharp tone almost drained Harry of all his arousal.
of you."
"Yes, yes. You told me that he still was saddened by his Godfather's passing and something about muggles." Lucius hadn't really paid attention to his wife that night, more than angry that his son had told him whom he had been seeing.
"Why didn't he just use magic?" Draco asked with a glare.
"I don't want to be forced to-"
- The Submissive is required to produce two Heir's by the age of 30 and is welcome
"Detention." Harry tried to blink the darkness from the corners of his vision. A few seconds - minutes - later Harry felt his body being gently placed on soft cushions and his body being embraced in a warmth he hadn't experienced before.
The Slytherins walked out at an average pace, Draco lagged. "You okay?"
"Merlin Harry, you don't need to apologize for anything like that," Draco smirked before kissing Harry deeply again, tugging gently on the hair and relishing in the moan that he swallowed. He quickly plunged his tongue into the wet, warm, mouth of Harry's, mapping it out, groaning when Harry gripped his hair tightly. "I'm sure that you're versed enough in kissing me to be able to do a peck or two a day when our public relationship mellows out."
"Jeez Draco, what about other people that want sugar quills?"
"There is nothing
Striding to his office Severus quickly flooed to Lucius', sitting ungracefully in front of his friend who had just been enjoying some alone time with his brandy. Upon receiving a glass, he downed it, ignoring the raised blond eyebrow as he collected his words.
"Dragonis Lucius Malfoy?" Harry bit his bottom lip when Draco pulled him closer.
Harry and Draco must return to school, and Harry has to act like nothing is wrong so word does not get to Dumbledore about the upcoming trial before anything has been set in motion.
"Nice to meet you, Harry, you aren't what I expected you to be."
"Are you crazy!" Harry shouted a jigsaw of emotions flooded him.
Lucius immediately flooed to the Ministry. A hurried walk to the archives he summoned everything about Harry Potter. He quickly scanned file after file until he saw a large one from only a year before.
-----
"That's much more like it." Draco murmured against Harry's lips, both hands holding Harry against him. Harry moaned into the next kiss, his arms wrapping around Draco's neck.
- The Dominate will listen to any worries that the Submissive brings to the Dominate's attention
"You, Potter, are by far the best virgin I have ever touched," Draco whispered in Harry's ear, his lips brushing against the sensitive skin, a smirk playing on his lips.
"No, I thought that speaking to you was a better alternative." Draco handed the letter back to his father who just nodded and beckoned him to follow. "What was the letter in reference to?"
It was then that Harry snapped back to reality and everything came into sharp focus. He twirled around and immediately straddled Draco's hips, surprising his classmate and his teacher. "Are you okay!? When did you become a vampire!? Why weren't you feeding!? Are you still hungry!?" He looked at Draco's face, forgetting the Potion Master still in the room.
"So, Harry - can I call you Harry?" after receiving a nod, she continued. "Now I've looked at the memories; I am going to start compiling a list of questions to ask all those involved, are there any questions you feel need to be asked?"
"Why did you help drug Harry Potter?" Lucius Malfoy asked, stepping closer and enjoying the hatred that glared at him from the small girl.
"Thank you, Lucius, good night Harry, Draco." Severus nodded to the two teens before following his long time friend out of the library.
"And the Heir par-" Harry started but closed his mouth when Draco put a finger on his mouth to silence him.
"Y-" Draco noticed the tears and the voice crack and felt terrible for assuming what he had. His soon to be Submissive was hurting, even if he really didn't care he knew that if he wanted their relationship to be believable at any rate and for there to be any foundation for their relationship he needed to start acting now. He slowly approached the shaking Submissive, wrapping his arms gently around his shoulders and lowering them to the cold ground. He pulled the smaller of the two into his lap and made comforting noises and rubbing his back. "Shhhhh, Sub you've done nothing wrong. I am at fault. I did not think of those situations and you did well by bringing them to my attention." He praised, pulling back a bit to thumb the tears away from the soft cheeks.
"Do not worry Harry, I hated History of Magic; I'm sure Draco will help you with it." Draco nodded along with his father's words.
"Hello?" Hermione asked. "I don't think anyone is there Ron, it was probably Myrtle pranking us." Hermione sighed.
"Draco, I'd like you to take him to the apprentice room."
"Why are you doing this? Why are you helping me right now? The contract doesn't-"
"So even if we had each found someone else we would have been forced to marry?!" Draco glared at his father,
"So if someone bound you and drugged you with a modified version of a love potion that kept you aware of everything but unable to control your own body and proceeded to have sexual relations with your unwilling self without your ability to stop it, all in the name of her getting pregnant with your child to later kill you in some way in order to obtain all your money, what do you call that?" Severus watched Draco heatedly, waiting for a response.
"Relax and think of memories. Even the one with the Headmaster." Severus coaxed him through the few silent minutes with the tight hold around Harry's chest.
Watching his friend being led away Harry didn't know how to feel. He would never forget Ron's action, yet seeing his best friend, his first friend, fall apart and admit to not knowing the full plan or what fully would occur after he restricted his friend caused some conflicting feelings. Logically he knew Ron was manipulated, lied to, and had only been acting under the assumption that what he was doing was going to work out for a happy ending. Sure, he knew what he was doing wasn't fully okay, but he had feared for the safety of his sister and hadn't wanted to get in trouble so he didn't speak out or get help.
"What?" Draco narrowed his eyes at his father.
"Then what?" Harry asked airily, gasping when he felt the tip of the wand pressed to his neck warm with power.
The next morning Harry sat on one of the armchairs in the common room as he stared into oblivion. The two youngest Weasley's and Hermione surrounded him, all asking questions rapid fire. He ignored them as he stood and robotically grabbed his bag before walking out of the tower. He ignored the angry glares from his three friends and the worried or confused stares from the other Gryffindor's.
"Any letters or-"
"If you tell any-"
After struggling for a few minutes the boy finally slumped in the chair and the words he fought hard to keep to himself flowed past his reluctant lips. "Ginny was just supposed to have seduced him when she said that that night was the night I thought she had convinced Harry to sleep with her."
"I know." She grinned at the praise.
"The dark Slytherin." Harry didn't point but he nodded in the general direction of the Slytherin table, taking a bite of the mash potatoes on his plate.
Harry sighed, tears streaming down his face, his shoulder shaking. "Yes....." He whimpered when Ron glared at him and ripped the cloak in half before throwing it down and stomping out of the room.
The vote was called. Guilty to being an accomplice to second-degree assault and innocent for conspiracy to murder.
"I don't want to intrude," Harry said quickly, waking up a bit.
"You'd think with all the reading you do you'd have been able to translate Parseltongue and learn to speak it." Ron retorted sarcastically.
"I'm not interested in her," Harry said quietly, not really preferring that the entire school hear their conversation. "Can't you drop it? This isn't a deal the entire school needs to hear about." Harry was confused when Ron's cheeks brightened. Harry just turned and went to walk away.
"Are you telling me that I- that I-" Draco stilled, tears dripping down his face as he gasped. "I crucioed him." Draco raised his hand to his mouth. "He said he didn't cheat, that-that-" Draco flew from his bed, struggling to dress as he stumbled out of the room.
"I'm not just going to let you walk out like that." Draco frowned, confused as to what he had done to get Harry to want to leave. "Can't we talk about this?" Draco had wanted Harry since he met him. He wanted close to the teen in front of him and after hearing him in the bliss of pleasure he wouldn't settle until Harry was
Harry didn't know if he should be jumping for joy or crying in despair. He looked down at the pregnancy test one last time, letting out a watery chuckle followed by a sob when the answer still hadn't changed.
"This is disgusting!" Hermione cried in disgust and outrage before handing it to Ginny who looked near tears at what she saw.
Draco didn't know if he could answer so he stepped closer, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist, nosing along the pale neck. He relished at the sound of the breath hitching and the feeling of Harry's heart beating faster through his chest. He licked a small stripe across the collarbone. He almost moaned at the hint of innocence and the sweet taste of blood. '
fits the offense.
"I think you're forgetting what you told Harry earlier, Weasley. Didn't you say that you wouldn't talk to him anymore because he did as his Dominate asked him? how can you be friend's with someone you won't talk to?" Draco pulled Harry under his arm, smirking when Harry turned and buried his nose in Draco's neck.
"What did you just do?" Harry asked curiously, not understanding the significance of what Draco had done.
want."
"If he kissed me I-"
"Sirius left him as the sole Heir when he passed." Narcissa sighed sadly. "Then my great aunt was his paternal grandmother so he was already blood-related and then when he was born Sirius had blood adopted him as well. So he was second in line for the Black title after any of Sirius' children if he had so chosen to have any." Narcissa explained with a frown. "That poor child."
"Oh."
"No," the boy began weeping, the reality of his actions, how they would have ended, overcame him. Anger boiled in his gut to learn that his other friend had only been apart of the Golden Trio to gain money and books. Ron cried for his friend he knew would never forgive him, for the injustices his own family had done, what he himself had done.
"I'd buy it." Draco gripped Harry's hips and rolled them over, smiling when Harry shouted his name before breaking down in giggles, his wild raven hair standing out against the perfect white snow. "Anything for you." He whispered softly.
"He lied to you Draco, to all of us." Lucius stood and settled down next to his son, pulling him onto his lap like he did when his son was younger. "It is okay Son, we can work through this." Lucius rubbed his son's back gently, mentally smirking as his plan unfolded beautifully.
He was alerted by a small trinket that Minerva was coming up the stairs, he slid some of his notes about Harry into his desk and welcomed the woman with his trademark grandfathered smile. "Albus, here are last weeks progress reports, I still don't understand why they are needed now with Yule break almost upon us." He only thanked her and handed her the letters before waving her away. He had needed her busy with the reports so that she wouldn't notice what was supposed to have been sex between two very young teens.
Only a few moments later and Lucius grew impatient. "What is this business?" He inquired professionally.
"Draco I, I lied."
"I'll be a Squib if I-"
Both Harry and Draco moaned when Draco's fangs buried themselves into Harry's skin. Pleasure erupted behind Harry's eyelids while ecstasy flowed down Draco with the blood.
- The Submissive must abide by the rules set by the Dominate unless they are
"But you're the smartest witch in our generation!" Ron smiled dopily.
"Harry y-"
"That you were hurt-"
but because Ron liked him.
Draco let the Gryffindor cry into his shoulder for a few more minutes, smiling sadly when he pulled back and wiped at his cheeks and avoiding eye contact.
"Good, now Severus, I believe your room is still ready for you to stay."
When they all sat Draco stood and smiled at Harry with all the adoration and love he held for his lover. "I have something to say." Draco pulled Harry to stand with him, sending a nervous look to his parents before looking to Harry who smiled softly at him. "I love you, Harry, I have for a very long time and even when we met and you turned my hand away I was fascinated with you and not just because you were boy-hero." Draco and Harry chuckled. "You were loyal and you stood up for your friend, even if I didn't like him at the time." Draco paused and ran his thumb over one of Harry's knuckles.
"And kissing? I don't know- I've never- I-" Draco leaned forward and pressed his lips against Harry's firmly, quieting his Sub. He moved his lips expertly, guiding Harry's with his own. He was pleased when the movements were quickly learned and Harry wrapped his arms around his neck.
"Are you saying you're going to hurt me?" Harry asked unevenly, voice shaky from nerves and slight fear. But underneath it all there was excitement - but Harry was going to ignore that - and arousal - Harry was going to ignore that too - that mixed together in a pleasant way.
-----
"Yes."
"I don't care how much you hate me Draco or why you hate me but I will not let you die. If that means waiting until you are on the brink of death and forcing you to drink my blood then so be it!" Harry growled. "I don't care if you hate my blood, it's the only kind you got right now." Harry puled his hand back before striding out of the office, tears slipping down his cheeks again.
"Does it bloody matter?!" Harry shouted, eyes blazing. "You don't care! Why would you?! I'm the
"My grandson crucioed Harry in a fit of anger when he believed that Harry had cheated, on him," Severus spoke up, tensing when both his husbands stared at Harry in horror. "Harry didn't get the chance to tell him of the news because of a lip-locking charm."
"How did the Lions take it?" Draco snaked his arm behind Harry's back and pulled him onto his lap, forearms resting comfortably on Harry's thighs that were spread to sit comfortably on Draco's own lap.
One month later and the resentment between the newest couple has dropped in the public and they go on their first date. Some friends are supportive and others aren't happy.
-----
Dragonis Lucius Malfoy
He sat down nervously, aware of all the eyes on him.
"Oh my god I'm sorry I-"
"Get your hands off of my friend you slimy snake!"
Amelia looked very shocked for a few seconds; she forced herself back into her professional self. "What charges?"
-----
"Yes, Sir!" She popped away as Harry finally stood up. He didn't want to brave the rest of the school, especially his supposed best friends, it was only a week, but just a second was agony. Harry wanted to cry at the injustice, scream out his anger, physically attack them for their betrayal, rip his skin off to rid himself of her dirty touch. It was overwhelming, and he had never been good at keeping quiet in the wizarding world.
"Get your hands off of me!" Potter hissed, struggling weakly, still in pain even though the damage was gone.
Harry Potter."
"Yes, well do come in. Tea?" He asked and when Severus nodded he snapped his fingers and ordered Tippy - a house elf - to prepare tea for three and set it up in the largest office he had. "Follow me, gentlemen." Lucius led them to his main office, easily bigger than the dorm rooms by itself. There was one large oak desk, two armchairs in front of it. Off to the left side of the room was a sitting area surrounding a modest fireplace. To the right side of the room was a flooing fireplace with another set of chairs and couches.
at anyone else I will kill them. You are
"From this display, I must conclude that you, Potter, are a virgin." Draco mused between his own heavy breathing. Harry just nodded quickly, hands roaming over Draco's chest in an attempt to map out the body of the most untouchable Slytherin in the castle. "An eager virgin at that."
The weekend had been rough. Harry woke at least twice a night, screaming, crying, or gasping for air. Draco was always close, to offer a shoulder to cry on, lend an ear for Harry to vent his feelings, his fears, and his nightmares to.
"What do you mean? Draco was in line for the Black Lordship under you?" Lucius was confused, he sat up straighter, his wine forgotten as he looked to his wife expectedly.
"He ended up killing millions of people before he took his own life when his headquarters were invaded by American soldiers." Harry paused to look at Cedric, who was ghost white and frozen. "A lot of non-Jewish people died too. Soldiers fighting to free the Jewish were killed and people trying to keep the Jewish in the camps were killed as well. It was terrible. Genocide is what my teachers called it. He killed over 1/3 of all Jewish people."
answer me." Draco demanded, eyes narrowing when the tears started to appear again.
"You're welcome to try, no one has been able to tame this thing." Harry giggled and leaned back into Draco's chest, enjoying the comfort when Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist.
"Honeydukes, I've been craving some sugar quills." Harry tugged Draco with him down the snowy alley, a little further away from the hustle and bustle of the main area.
"Do you know any more about this plan?"
"Yes I will, Draco Malfoy. Let us fulfill this contract together." Harry smiled and brushed Draco's lips with his own, a blush on his cheeks when Draco nipped his bottom lip playfully.
"You will not be forced into anything. If either of us ever wants out of the contract then the contract will be fair and more than generous to both parties of the relationship. But we both must remain faithful or Lady Magic will punish us."
The first weekend had been spent around Draco from the second he woke to the second he went to bed, Draco had warmed him while sleeping, keeping the nightmares at bay for most of the night. The library had occupied his mind during the day, and at night Draco led him back to their shared bed and pushed as much comfort and support into the small and damaged Gryffindor as possible.
Laying in bed, Harry stared numbly at the wall. His dinner sat untouched on the desk, Winny had brought it in, but Harry hadn't the energy to get out of bed after Transfiguration. He lost five points for not paying attention but had been able to avoid detention. The second class ended. He had raced down to the dungeons, avoiding any Gryffindors and Slytherins as he slammed the painting closed behind himself. He called out the password to lock the canvas; only Professor Snape would be able to get in as he was there when Harry set the password.
"No! I will have my treacle tart!" Harry would
"I TOLD YOU TO SHUT IT!" Draco growled and threw a lip-locking charm he made himself.Â Harry felt panic crawl up his spine, his eyes welling with tears the closer Draco got to him. "I asked you to marry me, and you turn your back on me and sleep with that blood traitor!" Draco accused. Harry tried to speak but the charm was still on him so nothing came out. "My father was right! I should have never even wasted my time with you." Draco shoved his wand away and stalked towards the door. "Be gone in an hour or I will kill you." Draco hissed before canceling the charm.
Draco had relocated to Harry's side instead of by his father's. He inched closer and closer until he was pressed flushed against Harry, providing comfort and support. "They will pay for what they've done to you." Draco ignored the unfamiliarity as he let his rival cry into his neck, rubbing his back slowly as he watched his father pull the last memory from Harry's head.
Harry forced the memory back to the box in his mind that he chained up, he gasped for breath as he re-entered the real world. He fell to his knees, taking in shaky breaths as tears leaked out of the corners of his eyes. He was humiliated that Snape, of all people, had seen that. He was thankful he had been able to cut it off before the clothes had started coming off and the sexual activities had taken place.
"The faithful th-"
He stood again, groaning when he felt dizzy before he forced himself to turn the corner, incidentally falling into another student. They both went falling and Harry groaned in pain, weakly pushing the other body off of him as he struggled to breathe. A moan of pain from his left had him slowly turning his head. He stared at the blonde haired student that he swears he knew but the name escaped to just beyond his fingertips.
"But I have to give him children?!" Harry shivered at the idea,
"I need to view your memories Mister Potter, there are two ways to do this." Lucius waited until he saw that Harry was understanding what he was saying before he continued. "The first way is for me to enter your mind and view them there or I can pull the memories from your mind and can view it in a pensive either with you or without you," Lucius explained professionally.
He stepped out of the fireplace with just enough time to catch Harry as he flew out of the fireplace, soot covered his robes and face while not even a speck hovered around Severus' personal space.
Draco chose to be silent instead of answering. He closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. Severus just left the pint on the desk before leaving the room. A dangerous second later and Draco sipped the blood greedily. It was the best he had ever tasted, sweet, rich, thick, warm and so very good Draco moaned as he savored each gulp. He was disappointed when it was all gone. His knowledge of who the blood came from didn't change his body from craving it, begging for it nor his body for singing in joy when he got to taste it.
He stepped forward and Ginny screamed insults. The spell wove around Ginerva's abdomen before slowly dispersing, a breath of relief escaped many's mouths. She wasn't pregnant. "You filthy death eater! I KNOW I'M PREGNANT! I'M A WEASLEY!" Spit spewed from her mouth as Aurors stepped forward to give her the antidote and stupify her before carrying her away.
"Harry?" Hermione asked.
Just the idea disgusted him to the core and scared him enough to cause a very small crack in the walls he had learned to build around himself. And seeing the teen break down in front of him brought out a side he had only shown with his godson. He held the child against his chest and tried to appease the distraught, sobbing child of his nemesis, a little more than uncomfortable by the physical contact.
"Has it taken place yet?" Harry asked as they neared the room, no one was in the hallway but the door was open so they weren't late.
"I have a question though, I've wondered since the first year but what are Muggle-borns exactly?" Harry felt a bit stupid when both Malfoy's looked at him oddly. "I mean when two magical people have kids they have magic or are squibs but squibs have magic but can't access it. So if Muggles don't have magic at all how can they give birth to someone who has magic.
"Surface mamories." Lucius supplied vaguely.
"Um....." Harry looked to Severus who just nodded. "I'm pregnant." Harry smiled a small smile to himself. Whoops, and hollers broke the calm silence and Severus winced at the loud sounds.
"Kill me?" Harry asked breathlessly his eyes glancing up to meet the pale blue eyes that sparkled with silver.
"Did you read the letter?" Lucius asked emotionlessly, barely able to conceal his glee at the plan he was finally able to work out, and tonight was the time to start things.
"Didn't you read the Muggle-born pamphlets?" Neville asked with furrowed eyebrows.
worries, concerns, emotions and/or needs.
The Wizengamot whispered to each other as Ronald Weasley was brought into the room when the stupify was released the boy snarled at everyone and tugged harshly at the chains, his efforts proved futile. Cornelius gave the beginning statement and once again the accused claimed innocence.
"I'm disgusted by you! I mean you blew of Ginny like she was nothing!" Ron pushed Harry's chest and grabbed his book bag before throwing it across the hall, trying to get a reaction. Harry didn't respond. He felt lost.
"Your grandfather is Lord Black, the first one born and the last from the original line of Blacks. My wife and her sisters are from the second line. He blood adopted you, making him 1/3 of your parents. He has no children so you're is Heir."
"No matter what anyone is Slytherin said I was always drawn to you and I had no doubt that somehow we were soulmates or we hadÂ been lovers in a past life." Draco continued. "I don't know what I could have possibly down to deserve you - I probably saved a million people in my past life." Harry chuckled and smiled impossibly brighter. "And if I could go back in time to when we first met I would relive my life all over if only to get to call you mine earlier in life." Draco hesitated before dropping to one knee.
"Shut your trap!" Draco snarled, wand raised at Harry who froze, mentally making sure his wand was in his back pocket. "How could you?! I gave
"That Godfather of yours almost lost a few times but he seems to care about you enough to defeat his cousin, a master dueler. I was impressed."
"I've been with eight people, three of them virgins, not including you." Draco ran his hand through the raven locks, gently pressing the smaller wizard against the stall to press himself further into the Gryffindor's space.
Sweeping over the rambunctious students his gaze landed on Ginny, she was whispering to her brother and Hermione; the girl was no doubt excited to be the future Lady Potter. In just two days, she would get find out if she was pregnant, to avoid questions from Poppy about pregnant thirteen-year-old girls Molly would floo it to do the spell herself. The Prewett Women had always been fertile; Ginny would likely be the same.

! Why does my crying-in-a-bathroom concern Draco fucking Malfoy for?!" He pulled his arm out of the harsh grasp forcefully, going to stomp out o the bathroom only to be shoved, and held, against the stone wall, his head slamming against the wall with a loud 'crack'.
"17 Galleons." She handed them a bag after shrinking all the items and placing them in the extended bag.
The room swayed dangerously in front of Harry's eyes, his vision swimming slightly as he lost focus of his surroundings. "R-Rela-Relation-relationshipÂ problems...." He slumped into the hands hold his wrists, his unexpected weight causing the blond Slytherin to fall to the ground with the injured Gryddinfor.
âIt was really close at the end there. I thought you had me.â
Tibby looked concerned but gave Draco a nod of acknowledgement before disappearing once again. The walk to his fatherâs study seemed to be a lot longer than he remembered. A feeling of dread built inside Draco with each step. When he finally reached the large oak door, he knocked softly hoping Tibby had been mistaken and there would be no response.
Draco and Potter both pulled up at the last second, narrowly avoiding a nasty collision with the ground. It was an impressive feat of flying executed perfectly by both seekers but with one key difference, Potter was holding the snitch.
He was already on his way to the kitchen to put on a pot of tea when Draco elegantly stepped out of the fireplace.
Draco laughed.
He ran into Asim a few times throughout the year but not even that could get him down. Heâd heard that after graduation, Asim was going to apprentice with a reputable book dealer down in Tunis, not that he cared. He was too busy preparing for the finals, which were to be hosted at Durmstrang Institute in Russia.
The next couple of weeks carried on much in the same way. Harry and Draco worked out, analyzed old games, and took their meals together. The soreness faded as Dracoâs stamina increased and he found it easier and easier to keep up. Harry was still well above him in terms of muscle mass but Draco was making progress. And the entire time he didnât touch a single bottle. He didnât really need to, since every night he would knock out as soon as he hit his mattress.
In the morning, he woke up to a splitting headache. He showered again, shedding off the sweat and nightmares that had accumulated through the night before joining Pansy downstairs for a cup of coffee. They got to work cleaning the rest of the house. Even using magic it would take a while.
The entire world held its breath as Krum and Potter battled head to head in the last
He tried for weeks to tap into his magic again, but Draco could never get it to work. He thought back on the incident, the magic had poured out of him like a wave. His mother had taught him that the heart was the source of a wizardâs magic, their core. Magic flowed from the heart through the veins, which was why blood was so important. So, Draco concentrated on that feeling, the sensation he had felt that day in the dining room. He pictured in his head that he was pulling that magic out of his core, sending it through his body, and out into the world. A few times he thought he could feel a tingling in his fingertips but that could have just been poor circulation. Still, he practised.
While Draco was disappointed in this new revelation, he still figured having fake friends was a step up from his previous situation for surely the appearance of friends was better than no friends at all. It was all a game. He just had to figure out how to win.
Hours later Draco felt that it was finally safe to come out. He just had to reach an apparition point and this nightmare would be over. Maybe he would stay in France. There wasnât anything for him in England anymore.
âSo what? Youâre just going to give up? Drop out of school and stack boxes for a living. Sorry to be the one to tell you this but you wouldnât make it through a day of manual labour.â
âDraco slow down. I have no idea what youâre going on about. Start at the beginning.â Harry handed Draco a cup of tea and sat down.
He made sure to spend just enough time with the others so that it would be clear that he was one of them - he had shed the persona of the âweird kidâ and it was not one he planned to pick up ever again - but once his social obligations were upheld, Draco would retreat back into himself. He still had grades to maintain after all.
It wasnât long before more symptoms started to show. Instinctively he hid it from Pansy but he realized that was counterproductive so he let her see the tremor in his hands and the sweat on his brow.
âÐ·Ð½Ð°Ð¹ ÑÐ²Ð¾ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð²ÑÐ°Ð³Ð° (znay svoyego vraga).â
âWell, I suspect you were unsuccessful, which is quite lucky because weâre all going to be spending quite a bit of time together. Whatever it is that happened I suggest the two of you work it out sooner rather than later.â She looked at Draco meaningfully.
Draco froze. His father had never asked for him before. This was not part of the routine. Draco was supposed to be the one to go to his father, and it wasnât sposed to be this early in the day. His heartbeat quickened. What if his father was angry again? Draco couldnât think of anything he had done wrong lately, but he was sure his father could.
âWhy not?â
âGood.â Draco glared back. This was the strangest argument he had ever had.
He did it. He beat Harry Potter.
Draco felt his breath catch in his throat. âIâm sorry. I have to go.â
âI donât want to work it out and my problem is nosey, four-eyed arseholes who think they are better than everyone else.
Draco showed up one morning to find Harry out back with a smirk on his face, well as much of a smirk as the golden boy could muster.
âWeâll never know that, will we?â He shifted over. âI talked to Coach and the owners, the Tornadoes wonât be renewing your contract for next season.â
âI think I would like to tell Pansy as well, if that is ok. She already knows Iâm not interested in girls, and well Iâm sure she at least suspects the rest of it. Honestly, if she doesnât know already she will the second she sees the two of us together.â
âGot it,â Draco spoke with conviction. This game wasnât over yet.
But if Potter canât take on the Russian, is there any hope left?
Draco continued to take the little orange pills daily over the summer months. It had become routine for him, and he didnât like who he was whenever he was off of them, namely irritable, unmotivated, and unfocused. Whenever they would wear off Draco felt like he was returning to himself, which was something he wished to avoid at all costs. Plus, they gave him enough energy and focus that he could still study after a long day of flying.
âIt was pretty amateur of you. I mightâve even though you threw the match if I wasnât so sure that your Gryffindor pride would let you do no such thing.â
âWell, if it isnât Draco Malfoy.â
âI was going to take the day off, but there is an emergency at work and I donât trust anyone else to handle it.â Pansy sighed. âWill you be ok on your own for a few hours?â
âYou know I study better alone. Every time weâre in the same room together I get distracted by your beautiful face. How can I be expected to work on my revisions when I would much rather be touching your hair or kissing your lips or listening to you read?â
After lunch, Draco would often play in his motherâs gardens. He would climb trees, collect rocks, or play games of make-believe. His favourite game to play involved his imaginary friend, Nicolas. They were explorers travelling the globe and cataloguing their adventures together.
âHiding from someone in particular or just the world in general?â
âYouâre absolutely mental. You know that.â He shook his head in disbelief. âI bet you were a total nerd in school. You are too competitive to settle for anything less than top of the class and too smart not to get it.â
âThen I play.â
He wasnât taking the pills, hadnât for a while, and the days were a struggle to get through. His moods erratic at best. He knew he had let himself get pretty bad but he was trying - trying to get his shit together.
âLook, I donât mean to be rude or offend you in any way. I just thought I would make it clear that Iâm not in the market for any friends. Save us both some time. That way you all can carry on as normal and Iâm perfectly content to keep to myself.â
"I don't think he can wait a week, Lucius; the boy was miserable."
Harry lay in one of the guest rooms, his body aching as he finally relaxed. He felt cold, alone and sad. He let himself cry, cry for his unborn child, his lost lover and for himself. He cried for Cedric, for Sirius, for his parents, and for Remus. He cried from all his friend's he had lost and all the damage that had taken place since he had entered the magical world.
Harry panicked; he desperately looked up at his professor, who nodded at Malfoy.
- The Dominate will provide for his Submissive.
"Why Harry. You
Harry felt a small smile creepÂ onto his lips as he nodded shyly. When the other boy sat down in front of him, smiling brightly Harry couldn't help but smile back.
"Did you drug Harry Potter knowing Miss Ginerva Weasley would rape him?"
"Men are too strong to be overpowered by a woman. And we have magic, it is just impossible." Draco said firmly.
Harry squeaked, jumping in surprise, falling further into Draco's embrace. The blush on Harry's cheeks didn't last long. The mind-blowing kiss had blood rushing away from his cheeks and down to his southern region.
Severus didn't know what to feel, the abrupt ending of his research was both a relief and a disappointment. He was relieved he wouldn't have to witness whatever had mentally scarred the boy but disappointed and angry that he wouldn't be getting an answer. He could assume and would most likely be correct in the assumption that the fourteen-year-old in front of him had been raped.
"No friends around to stop me from hurting you? From killing you? From torturing you?" Draco was toying with his wand, walking closer with every step until Harry could reach out and touch him.
"I couldn't sleep, love." Lucius smiled at his wife. She only hummed in understanding before venturing further into the room to sit on one of the many armchairs across from her husband. "Did my absence wake you?"
"I do I-" Harry turned and cried into the man's shoulder.
"What Potter!" He hissed, his annoyance very clear.
Harry didn't know how Draco was going to react - or god forbid what Lucius would do - when everyone found out. He let out a sigh when he heard the door slam closed.
"Draco I don't know what you're t-"
Draco took him all over the Manor, from the first formal dining room to the fifth. He led him to the throne room, the dungeons, his room, all three gardens, the Quidditch pitch, the lake, a few sitting rooms, the main flooing room, the kitchen and the library.
"The Headmaster is supposed to give them to the Head's to give to the children they get in the Muggle world. Even though you're half-blood you have been raised a Muggle." Neville explained.
"Amelia Bones will ask for your memories and present them to Wizemgots by herself and ask everyone to vote on the validity of the memories and to vote on her punishment or if she will even be punished at all. Lucius Malfoy will not require memories unless you want to present them. He will charge her with Rape and anything else he can learn from watching the memories himself. She and you will be put on trial in front of all of the Wizemgots and forced to takeÂ Veritaserum, the most powerful truth serum known. Either Lucius or Amelia will ask both of you questions separately and when she is found guilty then Lucius, Amelia, and Mister Fuge will come up with the punishment themselves and give her a sentence if they agree she deserves one."
"Loony Luna of the Lovegood." She twirled slowly. "Your Raven is waiting." She giggled at his dropped jaw.
The court was abuzz with whispers and hushed conversations. The lack of a defense team for all the underage witches and wizards was causing quite the stir, in the folder laid out in front of them were signed contracts were they all agreed for no defense, believing themselves, no doubt, to be able to get off scot-free on their own. It was highly inadvisable but not uncommon, it was shocking for the purebloods to know that neither Aruther nor Molly Weasley had been able to convince, if they even tried, their children to get a barrister. They could be appointed for free if the family hadn't been able to afford it.
"Please Ron, give it back," Harry begged, a little scared that Ron would damage it.
"If I did would you stop me?" Draco asked, a perfect eyebrow raised, a smirk on his lips that Harry definitely did not look at. "Would you...." Draco pressed the tip of his wand into Harry's throat, pushing in slightly. "Let me?"
"What about arguments? That could count as hurting me emotionally if I get emotional. I think you should add that you can't do it intentionally.
"Mister Potter? Can you hear me?" Fingers snapped in front of his eyes and he turned to look upon his Potion's Professor, Severus Snape. He blinked owlishly before nodding slowly, his mind was still muggy and clouded. "What happened?" He asked in a calm tone that Harry had no idea the man was capable of.
"Yes, remember, we will break it when we both get what we want," Draco promised before scowling at him.
"Master be okaying?" Dobby asked worriedly, wringing his hands together in concern.
He sighed before standing and retreating back to the Slytherin common room. He felt sick when he recognized the salt tang of tears in the air that he knew came from Potter. Guilt settled in his throat at the thought of making his rival cry when Potter kept him alive.
The wand was dropped and two large cold hands wrapped around his neck, pulling him closer. Harry whined at the touch, arching into the body against him like a cat in heat. When they pulled apart Harry was panting for breath, his lips swollen from the rough contact.
"Hi!" The other boy chuckled to himself. "I've lost my manners, my name is Cedric Diggory, I'm a third-year Hufflepuff." The boy leaned forward and offered his hand. Harry shook back weakly, again embarrassed that he was so weak he couldn't even grip someone's hand.
"It was a gift." Harry tried to swipe it but Ron pulled it back too quickly. "Please Ron give it back, I have to wear it to the-"
"Flattery can get anyone anywhere."
Lucius looked insane with glee at the prospect of charging the blood traitors and the old coot. "On what principals?" He raised an eyebrow at Severus who inhaled slowly.
They ate the rest of the meal is silence, Harry idly wondered where Draco's mum could have been the whole weekend but decided against asking, he didn't want to ruin the friendship that had started forming over the weekend. The first day Draco had hated him, but when Harry woke up, the Slytherin wished to comfort him, had encouraged his interests in books, and been a substantial presence he needed to fall asleep feeling safe, a protector of sorts.
"No, I am in fact
Harry felt a large, uncontrollable smile spread along his face. "Do you know something I don't know?"
"Why?" Draco asked shyly, walking further into the room to sit on the arm of the armchair his father was sat in. He leaned against his father's shoulder.
"Cissa is fine Harry, let us migrate to the sitting room." Narcissa kissed Harry's cheek before taking her husband's arm, kissing him as well before leading all four of them towards the sitting room.
"Bye Harry." Hermione waved but Ron just continued to eat and stare at their other friend, Harry frowned but quickly hurried out of the Hall.
Looking out over the students, Albus frowned once again. Harry Potter was not in the Great Hall. The boy had also been absent for every meal since he refused to help the boy after he had sex with Ginny. He hadn't expected the boy to come up to his office and had been worried the plan had fallen through, upon hearing the boy's story he relaxed. The boy should have been grateful, Albus thought to himself. The idea had been for Ginny to seduce Harry, Molly had improvised, and Albus approved.
"He wears a mask, just like many purebloods," Draco explained as he pulled piles and piles of candy into their bag. "You wanted sugar quills, correct?" When Harry nodded Draco pulled all of the sugar quills on the shelf into the bag. "What else do you like?"
"I'm sorry." Harry whimpered quietly, embarrassed about his uncontrollable emotions. Ever since he and Snape had been working on his Occulemency he was everywhere with no control.
"Mister Potter y-"
Harry knocked on the dark oak doors, wiping haphazardly at the tears on his cheeks before hanging his head.
"Potter?" The student asked, voice weak.
"Fine, you may have your tart. You
"Good," Lucius smirked at the gaping faces in front of his. "You don't really think the contract was fake, did you? Your mother and I set up the contract the day after we married. We assumed that Regulus would have an Heir." He frowned. "He died shortly after the contract was made."
"Harry Potter memories."Â  Amelia pulled out a pensive at these words, and she would need to review the memories before arresting those charged. Lucius opened the vial holding the memories and let them slide into the pensive's liquid, he waved away her offer to join and waited as she dipped her wand in the liquid and her body went still, seeing the horrors of the memories.
"It will definitely get their attention and maybe make them a bit envious. Blaise will see just how attractive I am and-"
"You're conveniently forgetting the fact that Weasley assaulted another student." Blaise Zabini drawled before getting down on a knee next to Harry's body.
Cedric's smile faltered for a second before he looked at Harry intently. "M'Harry Potter, I do-don't have a house yet." Harry was mildly confused about why Cedric stilled minutely before smiling again.
"Where?" Harry asked mentally.
"He was devoted to the gold that would come along with marrying into the Malfoy family." Lucius drawled.
"I get the gross picture you're painting," Draco said softly, pulling back a bit, more than disappointed that Harry still wanted Ron when he had already given up on Blaise, an entire week ago.
"Abbot, Hannah."
"Hagrid picked me up to take me shopping, he isn't a Head and I never got those. If it wasn't for Mrs. Weasley I'd never had even gotten onto the platform, Hagrid didn't tell me how to get on."
Their friendship only grew when Harry had saved his life and over the past three years especially when Severus married the Weasley Twins.
"Fuck Harry, just like that baby." Draco groaned out at the feeling of Harry's wetness seeping into his pants as Harry breathily moaned into his neck. He rutted a few more times before spilling inside his pants. "Oh fuck." Draco gasped into Harry's collar bone. "Jesus you turn me into a fucking third year," Draco smirked, helping Harry balance on his feet.
"Yes, I will find out after Father sends the draft." Draco nodded at Harry before striding down the hall and towards the dungeons. Harry waited a minute before following, not wanting to be seen walking with Draco just yet.
He froze. "No, no, no, no, no, no, no!" He pulled a picture from the file and felt his mouth go dry. It was of Potter's body. Scars and burns, words and bruises married his body, overlapping until only small patches of skin hadn't been scarred.
Harry would let out. His other hand let go of Harry's wrist to wrap a protective arm around the slim waist. What surprised him was how easily Harry slumped against him, not even caring that he was potentially being kidnapped. "Shhh." Draco purred into the ear, smirking when two redheads and the bushy haired muggle born ran past the opening of the alcove.
-----
"Buy me things?" Harry asked shyly. "I don't need-"
Thank you for reading my lovelies, any and all feedback is welcome!
"What's a shotgun?" Cedric asked in confusion.
"Then where?" Harry asked, pawing at the Slytherin robes.
Severus flooed them back to his home and was met with two identical worried faces. "Thank god-"
"Things normal couples do. Hold hands, dates, kiss. Most couples don't do this but as it is a contract I am officially courting you as well. It's a pureblood custom. One that Malfoy's still upholding."
"C'mon Harry! You've been ignoring me! Why are you being like this?" Ginny's voice was sharp, screechy and annoying. Harry winced at the sound.
"I'll tell you later." Harry clenched his jaw and glared at the back of Malfoy's head. "You're not going to like it." He warned under his breath as McGonagall tutted softly until the class quieted down.
Draco pulled out a random book from the pile he had created and started reading, only vaguely paying attention having read it before. Most of his awareness was on Harry - who was nose deep into the book - and he was eraptured by the beauty he hadn't noticed before. "You're beautiful." Draco sighed the compliment, unable to stop himself before he said it.
"Say another word and I will not hesitate!" Draco threatened.
"Well, I know some purebloods don't kill their squib children so what if they put them in the Muggle world and after a few generations or something the magic has built up to a Muggle-born?"
"Will you tell us now?!" Hermione hissed at him, sitting close to Ron on the loveseat in the common room. Neville, the Twins, Dean and Seamus, and Ginny were sitting around him, staring at him intently.
"That's not how you treat your girlfriend Harry." Ginny batted her eyelashesÂ in an attempt at a flirty manner. Whispers broke out at her statement.
"Oh fuck-yeah, just like that baby." Draco hissed in pleasure, latching his mouth onto the pale expanse of neck, biting, licking and sucking marks of his dominance into his new lover.
"N-no, I'm Harry Potter," Harry said shyly, his cheeks burning when voices started to whisper his name and a few people just gasping.
Fear slithered up his throat when she was unstupified and she twisted her head wildly around, glaring at everyone.
"Maybe but you never know. Someone may hear and maybe, maybe I just feel that way." Draco whispered, shivering a bit from the melting snow. He wandlessly put up a warming charm around both of them, feeling a bit brighter when Harry sighed in comfort.
-----
"I-I was t-too." Harry pressed himself against Draco's muscled body. "But...." Harry frowned, his shoulders slumping. "I know this isn't-isn't like dating and I know I sh-shouldn't be asking this of y-you but-" Harry cut himself off as he extracted himself from the blonde's hold. "N-Nevermind I'll ju-just g-go." Harry went to leave the stall but was pulled back by a hand around his wrist.
"Yes! YES! Yes, Draco!" Harry cried and slipped the ring onto his finger, jumping into Draco's open arms, forgetting the threat looming over him or the glaring eyes from across the room.
It took a little over half an hour to get everyone ready before they stormed Hogwarts.
"Are you serious! You can't not having sex until Weasley and Blaise notice-"
"When you don't have an obnoxious, red head plastered to your side or a haughty muggle-born behind you, you really look beautiful." Draco wanted more than anything to close the small space between their lips but held off, not wanting to assault the other teen.
He startled when he felt a hand touch his back, completely having been lost in his own mind, that he jumped and fell out of the chair, it clattered to the stone floor loudly and the desk was shoved back a few inches by Harry's flailing leg. He was about to stutter about an apology but the concerned look on the man's face effectively stopped his mouth from forming any words.
Albus enjoyed the rest of the meal before retreating to his office. He wrote back to the Minister and left all the letters from the Board of Governors for Minerva to do. Later he would call Ronald and Hermione up to his office to ask if Harry was in his Potion's class and again try and figure out where the boy had been sleeping. His two spies had been up on Saturday morning to tell him Harry hadn't come up to the tower to sleep. Everyone's fear of Harry leaving the school had been put to rest by all of his belongings staying at the end of his bed.
"How did this happen?" Ron finally spoke up and much to Harry's surprise he was glaring at him.
"And if you were threatened? If someone told you that if you didn't have sexual relations with someone they'd kill your mother, me or Severus?"
"Dad? Wh-What are you doing? What time is it?" Draco rubbed his eyes tiredly.
- The Dominate must take the Submissive's wishes and needs into consideration before
end this fling with my son before I do. I will not let you touch a single Sickle of the Malfoy money. Draco can and will do much better than you." Lucius snarled, raising his hand and smirking after the Potter brat flinched and ducked his head. "You will do good to remember this and if you ever mention anything to my son I will ruin you before torturing you in the worst way possible."
"Don't get the wrong idea Potter, I'm detaining you." Malfoy glared.
"Red hair, hand-me-down clothes, you must be a Weasley." The boy smirked and Harry felt lost and confused.
"NO! You're lying!" The boy accused, a single tear slipping down his left cheek. "Dumbledore wouldn't do that!" The boy swung his head around wildly, looking to the members of the court for proof of Malfoy's lies. "No! Harry's my best friend! He wouldn't do that." A few women dabbed their eyes, the boy on trial looked absolutely devastated by the news. A few of the wizards cursed Dumbledore for manipulating the boy to play a part in the rape, drugging, and eventual murder of a boy's best friend.
"Just Ron."
"You're safe now Harry, we will not hurt you here. I will try with all my power to see that those responsible are punished accordingly.
"Yes Harry, Sir! Dobby serves yous!" Dobby answered quickly before stifling a scream when he took in his Master's condition.
an abuse of power.
Draco wanted to drink and drink until there was nothing left but he was already full and content. He pulled his fangs out and kitten licked the puncture wounds closed. He sighed happily, nuzzling where the wounds once were. Harry panted heavily, coming down from the euphoria as he sagged against the vampire.
"No." he shook his head slowly, wrapping his arms around himself.
Much like the previous trial, the boy lied about his whereabouts and whom he had been with. When the memory played Ron had to be silenced as he had begun screaming that the memory was false. No new information was provided by the memory but it served to scare the boy into some compliance, instead of remaining silence he answered, although he lied through his teeth until Lucius grew tired and forced the truth serum down the bo's throat after the Wizengamot voted in favor of the potion.
"I still don't even understand how I have the Black Lordship," Harry muttered softly, leaning into Draco's side.
"Do we have to sit together?" Harry asked, wondering when he should tell Ron and Hermione.
"Mr. Weasley, what did you believe would be the result of these actions?"
"What if we help each other! I don't know how to get Ron to notice me and maybe we can get Blaise to notice you." Harry was desperate, he felt near tears every time Ron looked at Hermione or just plain bailed on him to be with their bushy-haired friend.
"I don't know-" Fred looked to his twin pointedly.
"Are you in agreement?" Draco asked after a few moments of silence.
"You could have just ruined the opportunity of a lifetime Draco, you might have, all because of a school rivalry!" Lucius was displeased with how his son had acted.
The blonde pulled back and licked the wound closed slowly, eyes closed as he moaned at the taste of the last drops of blood. A silent second later and Harry found himself on the ground, a fuming vampire standing above him. "I don't want your help! I can do fine on my own!" He shouted in anger.
"Why not!" Draco yelled in frustration. "Everything here benefits you! Every-"
I hope you guys like this chapter, slow updates because I'm having a hard time writing Molly and Albus' trials.
"Father, I told you that this conversation was done. I'm marrying him and that is final, nothing you can do will change that." Draco stated a hint of frustration seeping into his voice.
"We need to look like we've been arguing." Draco fixed his hair quickly before pulling Harry with him, quickly healing the swollen lips back to their normal plump and plushy state.
Harry didn't feel right about it all.
Draco personally had yet to read it. He relaxed against the window, the plush throw pillow behind him back making it extremely comfortable.
"Second door on the right." Severus pointed to the small hallway that was hidden behind his personal potion supply closet. He waved his wand and the closet moved to the side before he ushered Potter into the hall before watching him open the second door on the right. He put the closet back before opening the doors, mood already sour by the information he had just found out. His impatience was wearing so thin by the end of the class he shouted at them to all leave and assigned an extra foot on the essay than he had the other classes.
"Well...." A dusting of pink on the pale face caused a moment of attraction in Harry's chest but he forgot it when he remembered Ron's smile. "We're going to have to fake a relationship."
The second he finished his food he practically booked it from the Great Hall and hurled himself through the doors of the Potion Classroom. He wanted to crawl through the hallway and hide in the office of the Potion Master and get control over his breathing but he was stuck. He didn't know how to open the hidden hallway so he just sat in his normal desk, breathing shallowly.
"Harry, hmmm, such a lovely name." Draco let his fangs graze against Harry's neck, causing the raven haired teen to shiver. "And you taste heavenly, you must have been made special for me."
"I tried to te-tell him." Harry whimpered again, pulling back to wipe at his cheeks hastily.
"Not all abide by the contract. My mother's sister was supposed to marry my father but ran off and married a muggle." Draco explained -
Harry stood, moving to go out the door only to be stopped by Draco, who gripped his wrist hard enough to bruise. "You will stop this at once! I refuse to drink your contaminated blood." Draco hissed in disgust.
"Would you two quit it? You're in public Draco, you'd do well to act like it." Pansy hissed at him, glaring at Harry, snatching a quill from their basket and walking past them, shoving Harry to the side.
Severus didn't know how to respond to the story. He believed his friend and was ashamed of his godson but he didn't think he could take sides in the matter, at least not completely. He wouldn't let his godson hurt Harry but he couldn't cut his godson out of his life either.
"And you are going to be sore but you'll be okay. Do you want us to contact anyone specifically?" The witch asked hesitantly.
"In a month Ginvera Weasley will have announced the pregnancy, the Wizengamot would be hard-pressed to charge a pregnant woman, it is Harry Potter she raped, and the evidence of line-theft she should be charged to Azkaban but being pregnant she may just be fined."
"Don't sully my name with your breath." Lucius stalked closer to him, glaring intensely. "Let us get one thing right, Potter." Lucius spat the name. "I hate you and I always will, I despise you and nothing you do will ever change that. You
"I would like to petition the court for a low dose of truth serum." Much weaker than veritaserum but safe for adolescence and would not force the girl, to tell the truth, it would cause a heavy strain on the girl to lie or avoid answering. The more she struggled, the harder the potion worked. A quick vote was in favor of Amelia, and when brought te potion, she quickly forced the girl's mouth open and dropped the liquid down the girl's throat so she could not spit it out. "What did you mean by accident Miss. Granger?"
"I will simply inform him when we send back the agreed upon clauses that if he changes anything he will have a Squib for a son," Draco stated nonchalantly.
A small disturbance at the Slytherin table caught his attention. The fourth-years looked to be arguing, he was too far away to hear, but it was evident Mr. Malfoy was angry. The blond stood quickly, scowling at Mr. Nott and Miss. Greengrass before storming out of the hall.
"Yes, Father." Draco smiled at Harry who smiled back nervously.
"I'd never hurt my Sub." Draco pulled Harry as close to him a possible.
"Could we read it before it is made official?" Harry was tired and he knew that Potion was going to start soon.
"Yes, poor child, he grew up with his Muggle relatives." Narcissa seemed to grow angry after a few seconds. "They were abusive, treated Harry worse than Abraxas treated your house elves." Narcissa stood and kissed her husband's cheek before wishing him good night and leaving.
"In your dreams, Potter." Draco actually gagged at the thought. "Like I'd ever find the likes of you even remotely good enough for
"I get the gross picture you're painting Potter." Draco nearly gagged. The raven-haired teen just glared at him.
"Drink!" Harry thrust his wrist into Malfoy's face but the blond shook his head. "You idiot!" He turned around and grabbed the sharpest thing in his reach - a quill - and stabbed his wrist before dragging it sharply up the arm a few inches, ignoring the cries of panic before he threw the quill to the side before he shoved his bleeding flesh under Draco's nose. His eyes flashed silver again and his lips enclosed the deep puncture and sucked greedily.
The hour and fifteen minutes went by so fast that soon enough Snape was kneeling in front of him, voice soft and void of any hatred or disgust. His eyes were soft and his face was gentle and made him look so much younger, it was then that Harry realized that he was the same age that his parents were supposed to be. He sniffed, cheeks burning as heÂ carelessly rubbed the tears off of his skin. "Sorry."
"I will get you anything you want," Draco promised, pulling Harry right back to his chest, smiling at the bark of laughter Harry let out.
"Isn's that bad." George gave Harry an obscene wink.
Three days later the post came in and two birds of prey flew through the crowds of owls, one to Gryffindor table and the other to Slytherin table. All eyes in the Hall stared at Harry and Draco as they received their post.
"No, Potter, I do not want to hurt you..." Draco tilted his head and leaned in closer, his eyes flicking down to Harry's lips. "But I do want to do something to you." Draco lifted his free hand to toy with a raven lock of Harry's hair.
"Saving your godson from starving!" Harry hissed back. That shut Severus up and the man seemed to finally look at Draco before his eyes widened in horrorÂ and regret. The room was silent for twenty long minutes while Draco fed to his heart's content. harry didn't worry about his blood because he could still feel the large amounts of blood replenishers still working inside his veins.
"Because you didn't send-"
"Come along Harry, sleep is well overdue." Draco slipped his fingers into Harry's hand, tugging him along easily.
"Yes or no!?"
"Draco!" Harry giggled, turning around to wrap his arms around Draco's neck loosely, blushing when Draco smirked down at him. A silent second later and Harry pulled Draco down for a chaste kiss.
"I do-don't want to-" Severus didn't need to read his mind to understand that he wasn't going to be able to go to the next class.
A slow week later and Harry notices the blonde was absent the entire day. He skipped History of Magic and instead found himself in Snape's private office, sitting silently in front of the tired looking teacher. A silent agreement later and Harry gave a pint of blood before promising to be back in three days to give another.
"I'm pr-preg-pregnant." Harry whimpered, clutching his shirt tighter.
"You cannot stop me from buying you things, it is my duty as the Dominate." Draco pulled Harry closer.
"No problem Father." Draco didn't want his Father to suggest Harry sleep in another room, he wanted to be the one to hold Harry while he slept.
"And if I asked for something crazy, something that is extremely expensive?" Harry let one hand twirl around one of the blond locks that fell out of place.
"Father, Uncle, are we needed?" Draco asked, closing his book and sitting up straighter, his arm pulling Harry to his side, effectively causing the smaller one to yelp and fall onto the other teen.
pay," Draco assured, shuffling closer to the smaller teen, holding him closer to offer comfort and support.
"Of course Harrison. Yule break is coming, you'll just come back with Draco and we will have him over."
"Draco, what did I tell you about letting scum into my Manor?" Lucius snarled from the archway, sneering in disgust at the raven-haired filth that clung to his son like the gold digger Lucius knew he was.
They entered the room, everyone staring at them. They scowled at each other before walking to the sides of the room, sitting as far away from each other as possible. "Why'd you arrive with Malfoy?!" Ron hissed in anger, his face as red as his hair.
"Yes?" He asked, one perfectly shaped eyebrow raised, sipping his tea.
The dour man hummed disapprovingly but kept quiet as he returned to his paper.
Harry was thankful that is was Friday because he wasn't required to show his face at all during the weekend because right after dinner he met his Professor back in his classroom. He felt even more exhausted than before because he had to spend the entirety of dinner avoiding his two - former? - best friend's and his rapist. The only thing that kept him from exploding into tears and screams and panic was gentle, mental probing from the professor. He wasn't looking at any memories, he was just occasionally brushing against Harry's mentalÂ mindscape? He didn't know how to explain it.
"Goodmorning boys, did you finish your homework?" Severus questioned as he read the paper, raising an eyebrow and glancing at them when he didn't hear an answer.
"I could hex her," Draco growled, twirling Harry around and clasping their hands together and tugging him along down the aisle. "Nosey, pug-faced Parkinson, always sticking her bloody nose in my business." Draco piled all the Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Chocoballs, Cockroach Clusters, and a few packages of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans.
Draco paused to check the girl out silently. "You are?" he asked icily. She just giggled behind her hand.
Harry sat on his bed, breakfast long cold in the desk. He only had a few minutes left before he would need to go to Charms. Not knowing if he had the strength to face the day Harry started to weep, it was the sound of a knock on the painting that brought him out of his grief.
He knew that he was known for being a grumpy, unapproachable, git but he wasn't heartless enough to push the child away. The sound of students outside the doors brought Severus to reality. "Harry, Harry, child, you may stay in my office for the last class of the day or I can write you a late pass for your last class." Severus knew it was out of character but he couldn't even imagine the mental pain the Potter spawn was going through.
." The hat's voice was smug and a bit curious. "
"How many have you touched?" Harry was gasping for his breath as he lay, boneless, on Draco's chest.
"Men cannot be raped! He should have liked it!" She struggled to say the words; it was clear to all those that she fundamentally believed men could not be raped but knew Harry did not want or like what had occurred after the memory cut off. "If he had just slept with her the first time she offered none of this would have happened!"
He cleaned the soaked pillows and transfigured the clothes into pajamas before banishing the food. Seeing that everything was in order he left, he had planned on talking to the boy and maybe helped him with his homework, he often had available time for his Slytherins and wanted to make sure Harry would have help now that he wouldn't be doing his work with the Gryffindors. The fight at lunch among his Slytherins meant that Draco wouldn't have much time to spend with his new friend without alienating his year mates.
Class ended an hour later and Harry had only managed three feet and five inches. He went to put his things away when Snape's voice called him to the front. "Stay behind Mister Potter." Harry sighed before standing still, waiting for the others in the class to empty out.
"That's Baise Zabini." Hermione sat down in front of them, cutting off their view of the Slytherin table.
-----
"As much as I love an eager virgin, Potter, I believe that doing this here in the corridor is just asking to be on the front page of the Prophet." Draco pulled back, his arms tight around Harry's waist.
The rest of the trial passed quickly, Harry curling tighter into himself and his professor's embrace as the plan for her to get pregnant and pause the pregnancy was confirmed. When she admitted to not yet knowing if she was pregnant the court murmured amongst themselves, there was no doubt this girl was guilty but the idea of sending a pregnant witch to Azkaban did not sit well with many of the members.
That continued for two weeks and Draco looked healthier, tired, but healthier.
"What's the difference?" Harry asked delicately.
"I haven't finished my History of Magic essay, but it isn't due for two more days," Harry was quick to explain himself, having seen the softer side of the professor he found himself wishing to please the man. He wanted to make him proud. He was his hero, after all.
"Harry, would you like to explain why my husband's and I were interrupted during our throws of passion by a medi-witch of St. Mungo's?" Severus drawled sarcastically, frowning when Harry didn't laugh like he usually did but instead broke down into sobs again. "Harry, what's wrong?" Severus transfigured a chair before quickly sitting by the man's bed.
"Is that what you want?" Draco knew he knew, that that was
- The Dominate is allowed to punish his Submissive for disobeying the rules as long as the punishment
I hope you all liked the update, please leave feedback in the comments, I do write this for you, and I don't want to write something you'll hate.
"I'll have my father make a fake marriage contract between the Malfoy's and the Black Heirs. You're Heir Black now that that fleabag is out of Azkaban. Lord send them to their Heirs around the fifth or sixth year because they must marry after seventh."
"We're wizards, Harry." Draco teased as he dragged his wand along the rips and watching in satisfaction as the fabric stitched itself together perfectly. "Perfect, just like you. Now, let' finish you getting ready." Draco stood and pulled Harry with him, thumbing away the tears before leaning forward and pressing a chaste kiss on Harry's forehead. "Now if we could only fix that hair of yours."
"Well, if the rumors about second year have even remotely true then it seems Myrtle's bathroom is the safest place in the world to do anything." Harry glanced around and found that Draco had walked them all the way to the bathroom. "Now, Potter, where were we?" Draco smirked, one hand sliding down and squeezing Harry's bum.
"I told the Headmaster and because he said it's safer for me there."
Harry didn't even turn around, just laughing hysterically, tears choking him as he felt frustration and anger and pain crawl up his throat.
truthful."
"Yes, I will have to view them multiple times in order to come up with charges I can bring in front of Wizemgots."
"How did you get these?" Draco asked through clenched teeth.
"Potter! Potter!" Draco quickly caught up to Harry and grabbed his elbow and quickly pushed him through the corridors and to an unused classroom. "You did wonderful, my Sub." Since they opened the mail Harry felt a weight lift from his shoulders.
Two weeks later and Harry started noticing the longing looks that Malfoy kept sending to the dark Slytherin. "Ron, who is that?" Harry asked, fighting down a blush when Ron turned to him, his face close and his eyes bright.
"Harry would be my brother-in-law, no one would refuse my applications as best friend and brother-in-law to the Boy-Who-Lived." The answer brought on a few moments of silence. The answer was childish and full of grandeur but there wasn't exactly evidence of Ron planning of knowing what had happened, if anything it seemed like the boy had been slightly manipulated into his part of the plan.
. "Why would there be a closed trial?" Lucius asked himself before opening the file.
I hope I can continue to keep updated, I really screwed myself by starting so many fanfictions with ideas I don't want to give up but never finishing one before I start another.
"I, Dragonis Lucius Malfoy, swear on my magic that the clauses in the marriage contract are truthful and once agreed upon will be in the actual contract." A blue light enveloped Draco before fading.
"Potter." Lucius spat his name.
"Ron I-"
"Are you okay?!" Harry kneeled next to his Slytherin rival while he turned the weak boy on his back.
"I like who I like Malfoy, I don't see why you're so curious..... Or maybe you fancy me? Is that it Malfoy? You want in my pants and you want to see who you have to contend with to win my heart? Well-"
"Indeed he is Little Malfoy and if you-" George and Fred appeared, their tones and faces serious.
"Why is it called World War?" Cedric asked.
"We'll be late for Transfiguration if we don't leave soon." Harry felt flushed, even though he liked Ron he didn't think Ron would ever be able to kiss him like that.
"I don't care, just tell me." Harry felt anxious as he waited for the blond to speak again.
"It is not common anymore Harry, but generations ago when young witches and wizards were married very young, after proof of conception a ritual would halt the pregnancy and some few months or even years later the ritual was reversed, and the pregnancy would continue, Based on just the bits of conversation taken in front of you I can assume that at some point they expected an accident and logically they would start the pregnancy again and just shortly after you've passed or been out of commission she would birth your child and use the blood to gain access to your family money."
"About Gin. It-" Fred was quick to hand the contract to Neville.
"Does the victim have any memories they'd be willing to provide?" He asked, not wanting to target Mister Potter who looked near as white as a ghost and shook so bad that Lucius was almost afraid that a large gust of wind could carry him far away.
"We will continue this, Potter." Draco purred and Harry almost wept in relief.
- The Submissive must remain faithful to his Dominate under all circumstances.
"Mmmmm, let's first get this cloak on you, you probably look dashing." Draco purred lightly before turning Harry to him and throwing the cloak around Harry's shoulders before fastening the clasp together. "And I was right, you're very handsome in green."
"What did you mean by accident, Miss Granger?" Amelia Bones asked.
Of course, his subconscious was not yet convinced of its safety, and knowing he was going back to school, Harry couldn't see himself getting better. The mere thought of going to Gryffindor Tower, let alone sleeping there, sent chills over his body, his hairs raised on end, and nausea to roll through his stomach like a freak storm.
"I know son, but I found some new information and it is exactly what I feared." Lucius played the concerned father as he sat down in his private office across from his son.
-----
"He is the only one who knows of your condition and the only one who can give blood that you can access. Dumbledore isn't here anymore Draco, he cannot get you blood and we both knew that Umbridge won't help you. I will not let my godson starve!" Severus hissed while he closed Harry's wound with a twirl of his wand.
"Why are you wearing this! You just throwing money around-"
The young Slytherin couldn't imagine the emotions Harry must feel. He was overwhelmed. He wondered if sending Harry back to school had been a good idea. He knew Harry legally never should have left, just like Draco shouldn't go one weekend a month, but letting Harry be around the people that had hurt him didn't seem to be in Harry's best interests. Trying to hide the trial for just a few more days didn't seem like a justifiable reason to him.
-----
"Just to clarify, you knowingly and willingly drugged Harry Potter so Miss Weasley could rape him, and went along with the conspiracy to murder your classmate so you could have access to his family books and money?"
"Lucius? Why are you still up, darling?" Narcissa asked from the doorway, yawning tiredly.
The Twins, Neville, Dean, and Seamus looked alarmed while the other three looked near panic. A quick exit for the two youngest Weasley's and Hermione later, Harry was too tired to answer more questions.
"Ron, Mione, and Gin were mad like it was my fault. And when the twins asked why I didn't know about male pregnancy it then that brought up why I was picked up by Hagrid instead of a Head and then why I didn't get the Muggle-born pamphlets and then the three just seemed to run out of the tower like Merlin himself was chasing them."
Going to bed every night in the giant Manor alone had been terrifying for Harry, he curled tightly under his blankets, desperate to hide from the nightmares that always found him. Without arms to secure him he woke four to five times a night gasping for breath with tears streaming down his face. Although he missed Draco a great deal Harry yearned for Professor Snape even more. The man had been his first savior, had provided a safe place, and had taken him to get help.
"Lovegood, a long history of seers correct?" Draco knew he wouldn't get an answer, seers didn't have it easy, people sought them out to just use them. "Well Luna Lovegood, I do wish you a pleasant day." He turned on his heel and raced to the seventh floor, following the girl's riddle of directions. He walked in front of the wall he was told and quickly raced into the room that appeared. The room shifted around him and the once office was a comfortable room with a large couch, which Harry was sat on.
"Wizengamot, I have memories to submit to the court, already checked and tested against fabrication. Due to the private nature and the underage nudity in these memories every member here, today is asked to swear on their Wizengamot Seat to not share the details of these memories to anyone outside this room or within hearing distance of anyone outside this courtroom." Bones waited as every member raised their wand and uniformly recited the oath, it was the standard oath when such private details were exposed during memories.
"How do I know that your father has sent a fake draft and the real one is going to make me do everything you command?" He was nervous, shy even, that whatever he and Draco planned was going to backfire.
Neville lead Draco at a fast pace up to the tower. "Can I trust you with the password?" Neville asked hesitantly.
"Every night for the past two weeks." Harry droned, eyes glazed as his sight kept slipping out of focus.
Wow... I know this update is out of nowhere, and it has been way too long since I've written for this fanfiction, or really any of my fanfictions.
"I love you." Draco smiled softly, rubbing his nose against Harry's who giggling.
"I could suggest to Fudge to ward the room with anti-biased wards or have all members voting to take an oath on their magic." Lucius offered and smirked when he received a nod. "Good, now it is late. Draco, if you wouldn't mind-"
"Bloody-" Draco exhaled sharply through his nose, breathing in deeply before rolling the dead weight off of him in order to control the situation. He straddled the waist of his nemesis, holding his wrist again, feeling slightly guilty when he saw the glazed eyes of the teen underneath him. "What relationship problems could the Chosen One have?!" He snapped angrily.
"You can't
"I think maybe viewing the memories would explain it better." Lucius pushed his pensive filled with false memories to his son who hesitantly lowered himself in.
"HARRY! GET OUT HERE RIGHT NOW!" Draco shouted, his anger causing Harry to shiver in fear.
"But I heard-"
Harry opened hisÂ mail quickly, making a show of his horror and anger on his face as he stood and stomped out of the room. He heard small gasps when Draco stood and called his name, quickly walking after him.
The words caused some concern for most of the adults in the room, especially Madam Bones, who was careful to keep her next words calm. "Is there anywhere else you can go?"
"Thanks." Harry smiled at the girl and followed Draco out of the store.
Professor Snape arrived in a billow of his robes, an entrance that demanded attention, and he stared at them on the couch before his gaze softened just the smallest bit. "Winny," he called out, and when the house-elf arrived, he spoke again. "Collect all of Harry Potter's things from Gryffindor dorms and bring them to this room, do a wash, and put things away."
Fudge was slumped in his chair, this case was the highest-profile trial he knew he would ever sit, it was clear that Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, had been dealt an extremely unjust hand but Fudge knew convicting Albus Dumbledore would be a challenge, getting him in Azkaban, and kissed would be even harder. He hoped Lucius was ready, if Lucius won, the Wizarding World would be changed forever.
Harry and Draco read in silence for only a few minutes before the sound of footsteps interrupted their comfortable silence.
Before Harry could even begin to formulate a response his mouth was full of tongue and wet heat. Harry practically melted, only being held up by Draco's arms and the sheer determination to never let the lips leave his own.
Within fifteen minutes, Harry was flooing to Malfoy Manor, Mr. Malfoy following him with all his things, Madam Bones coming after last to ask some questions. Both guests were led to the Lord; tea was set out with some biscuits; Harry only made his tea after Mr. Malfoy nodded encouragingly at him.
"Malfoy!" He ran after the retreating figure, pulling on the blonde's elbow sharply.
"Bring in the next accused."
Harrison James Potter
"Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge providing over Harry Potter versus Hermione Granger in front of the full Wizengamot. Barrister Lucius Malfoy will be questioning with Madam Amelia Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, who made the arrest. Charges are as follows, accomplish to second-degree assault and conspiracy to murder against Harry Potter, how do you plead Miss. Granger?" Cornelius' voice was level as he stared down the fidgeting girl.
Harry thought to himself as he stood and stuffed the parchment into his pocket.
"Why wouldn't father tell me about this?!" He ran his hands through his hair in mock stress.
"Not that either." Draco lowered his free hand to brush his knuckle against Harry's cheek in an almost-not-there touch.
what Harry wanted if his facial expression and body language were anything to go by. "Because I was looking forward to going further with you," Draco smirked at the blush on his lover's cheeks. "A lot further."
- The Dominate will do whatever he can in his power to make the Submissive
I'm back. Its been a minute but chapter 6 is up! Between the last post and now I've moved, started a new job and working nights, and started my online college classes. So it has been a busy time but I will work in time to finish these fics for you guys!
"Is someone there?" Ron asked.
"Who do you want to take this to, child?" Snape asked slowly, continuing to pet Harry comfortingly.
"Did you know that after you drugged Harry Potter your sister Ginerva Weasley would rape him?"
Lucius couldn't even finish the first page. He felt sick. He banished all the files back to their places before leaving.
"Then that can be done," Lucius promised before casting tempus. "I believe it is getting late. Goodnight Draco." Lucius laughed maniacally when his son apparated away. He couldn't wait for his son to return. "Potter, I told you that you would regret trying to take my son away from me," Lucius smirked to himself before leaving to seek out his wife.
Every few years, there was someone who needed to be separated from the house for some length of time. Sometimes it was just for a few weeks while someone grieved the loss of a loved one, for protection if an inter-house argument ended up in injury, or back when his uncle had gone to school, a betrothed couple had to fulfill a part of the contract if they still hadn't graduated yet.Â Betrothal contracts now were less popular, purebloods still used them occasionally, but with the last few years, blood-adoptions had skyrocketed, and the need for contracts to get heirs fell out of fashion.
"Go say hello to your Mother, Draco," Lucius pulled his blank facial expression onto his face.
It was only three days before the trial started, Amelia Bones and Lucius Malfoy had spent those days planning out the questions they would ask each Gryffindor. There was some debate on whether or not to have Harry present at the trial, with the memories and hopefully veritaserum, and there would be no need for Harry to testify. However, if the use of veritaserum led down other criminal paths, then having Harry nearby to question may be useful. It was decided that Harry would sit in the gallery with an adult.
"I get the gross picture you're painting." Harry chuckled at his own joke and brushed off the glare that the blond sent him. "But how? It will make no sense to do it randomly and everyone will suspect it false."
"May I eat in my room?" The professor paused, considering it, before nodding. Harry turned and left quickly. He needed some time alone. He had enjoyed being around the Slytherins over the weekend, but after having to see Hermione and Ron, he wanted some alone time.
"What you're talking-" George nodded subtlety.
"NOW!" Lucius shouted, glaring at Potter while his son kissed his cheek before slowly walking further into the house to find his mother.
Lucius glanced at Harry Potter - who was curled up into himself on the couch, his head lowered - before he made eye contact with Severus who gave him a pointed look. Horror filled Lucius to the brim. Rape did not happen often in the Wizarding world but it wasn't unknown. It was the second worst thing you could do in the eyes of any and all wizards. It was right behind child/marital/human abuse.
The blond pure-blood coerced them to the left side of the room before sitting down in an armchair. Severus sat next to Harry on the large couch. Tea appeared with a quiet crack of displaced air. Lucius used his magic to serve the tea before they settled for silent sipping.
"I have to Ron." Harry sighed heavily, disappointed that Ron hadn't noticed him in a romantic any more than before and it's been an entire month.
"The Dominate isn't to physically, sexually, mentally or emotionally abuse his Submissive under any circumstances," Draco stated confidently.
"Shhhhh, Sub, you're perfectly fine." Draco hadn't known that his soon to be Sub was so emotional, it would definitely be hard to keep people from seeing his Sub and taking advantage of it but it would be helpful for when Draco needed to know how his Sub was feeling, what his Sub needed.
"What if you father ch-"
alone.
"Before class,Â were you talking to the Headmaster about this? About the Miss Ginerva?" Snape asked, seated at Harry's feet - which was close since Harry was curled up in a ball, his knees to his chest and his arms around his legs - one hand on his knee in an effort to provide support. Harry nodded in answer to the question. "By your actions, I'm going to assume that he wasn't helpful and wanted to push the problem under the rug?"
"Girl's can't rape men." Draco scoffed in disbelief.
Hermione Granger was flushed in anger. How dare that attention-seeking brat expose her, she thought furiously.
"You should go to him, he is your Submissive and it bound to be distressed right now. I know you hate him but you'll have to get over it. This contract supports a healthy relationship, for both of you." Pansy tried to comfort him, smiling sadly.
"Lucius." Harry kept an emotionless mask on his face, his eyes lowered in respect.
"Oh, Merlin! Pl-Please- Oh God!" Harry whined, his fingers tugging on Draco's hair, his head thrown back, exposing his neck to the Slytherin.
." The hat's voice was projected inside Harry's skull and he was curious about how that was possible and made a note to look into it later when he had the time and the right book.
"A what?" He asked, looking to the other students looking at them.
"Shhhh Harry, we are just sleeping." The words seemed to relax the tense Gryffindor and only moments later he was asleep, nuzzled closer in his subconscious. "That's more like it." Draco pressed a soft kiss to the base of Harry's neck before burrowing his nose into the soft raven locks, breathing in the smell of pine and drifting to sleep.
"I hate him and his blood and I refuse to drink it." Draco hissed.
"You like that Zabini kid, don't you." Malfoy gaped at him slightly before fixing his mask and glaring at the Gryffindor.
"Courting?"
The next day Harry was released from care at lunch. He walked into the Great Hall, slumped shoulders. All the houses quieted. The Slytherins watched closely while glaring at the two youngest Weasley's and Hermione. When Harry sat down quiet murmurs spread throughout the school. He sat beside Neville who smiled at him but his eyes were sharp and angry.
Draco slumped in he seat Potter had just vacated. He looked up at his Godfather who looked at him with disappointment. He felt like a scolded child. "Why?" Was all his Godfather asked?
"Of course, Sub." Just like that the room changed into a bedroom, they were on a giant bed that was easily the biggest Harry had ever seen. The room was still the creams and browns of before but the sheets were silk, the color scheme was green and black.
"Draco! I didn't cheat! Pl-Please believe me!" Harry sobbed, taking in a shaky breath when the tip of a wand was pressed against his throat.
Draco continued to kiss Harry deeply, wordlessly cleaning the mess on his robes, in his hand and the mess of Harry's prick. He gently tucked Harry back into his robes, his other hand cupping the back of Harry's neck, angling his head to kiss the raven haired boy deeper.
By the time they made it to the front porch, Draco had gone quite pale, a sickly colour not too far off from the storm clouds in the distance. âPorchâ was a bit of a loose term; Harry may have more accurately described it as an open-air ballroom. Draco darted forward to knock on the door, then stepped back next to Harry, letting out a slow, shaky breath.
Harry had to pause to think about that, which left him feeling quite old. âTwelve years. I grew up in a village in Somerset, but I moved in with my godfather and his partner when I was fifteen, and Iâve been here ever since.â
They finally reached Islington, and after several minutes of fruitlessly searching for a place to park, they hurried into the restaurant, which fortunately had saved their reservation. The matron guided them over to a polished booth, and Draco and Harry squeezed in next to each other, Dracoâs hand spanning Harryâs thigh under the table. No one seemed to notice except for Pansy, who smirked knowingly at them from the other side of the booth.Â  They idly chatted as they browsed their menus, but after the server took their orders, Draco announced he needed to use the loo and ducked out, leaving Harry and Pansy alone.
âYou hardly need that,â Draco muttered, rolling his eyes, but he complied anyway, resting a hand on Harryâs chest as their lips met. âGo kill it out there, Potter.â
Draco inhaled, eyes shut, and he rested his head in his hands. Harry could feel the anxiety rolling off him in waves. âOne and a half years ago, I was promoted from covering Manchester United to the English national team. I didnât want to be a sports journalistâIâve always preferred politicsâbut Father thought sports would be a better match, because the public still cares about it, and it wouldnât interfere with his political career. So four months ago, I was thrilled when a whistleblower informed me of possible corruption on the national football team.â He swallowed. âSorry, could I have some water?â
âWhy is everybody still here? Whatâs going on?â he asked, cutting between two pairs of broad shoulders.
âGlad one of us did,â Harry said as he stepped onto the pavement. The Volkswagen was pulling away when he remembered his football bag was still in the boot.
âI know.â They both sat in silence for a while.
His knock against Dracoâs door echoed into the night, mixing with the sounds of raucous laughter, slamming car doors, and boots on wet pavement. London never grew tired, Harry thought, and he wondered what that would feel like. His limbs were sodden with rainwater, exhaustion, confusion, but out on the street, the night was just beginning.
âThat was one time, you bastard!â But Pansy was laughing.
âBugger off,â Harry said, standing up. âYou know I cook eggs better than you do, even if you refuse to admit it.â He planted a soft kiss on his boyfriendâs mouth, then hurried out of the room, hiding his smile behind a fist.
