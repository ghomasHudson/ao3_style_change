Harry opened his mouth to scream in protest at what was happening. Alec took his chance and made the child drink some calming drought. Harry was forced to drink every bit of the drought, once it hit his stomach, the effects where immediate. His body sagged in relief, as those dark thoughts now just drifted away once they were thought of; none lingering too long. Alec slowly rocked the small child in his lap as the younger tried to catch his breath.
Harry’s face too turned red at the thought of sharing a kiss with Draco after thinking of such things of him when he first woke up. Both boys where reluctant to kiss but being so close together was suffocating too. Harry was the first to move, wanting to get this over with as soon as possible. He leaned in and placed his lips against Draco’s. Draco felt the breath in his lungs being stolen away before he closed his eyes and returned this kiss. It was a sweet and gentle kiss nothing passionate about it. But they stayed like that longer then needed, liking the feel of one another. A hand rose of it own accord, softly cupping Harry’s check, one of Harry’s rising to bury itself within the silky locks of hair at the nape of Draco’s neck.
Ragnok was writing out something on a parchment and as soon as he was done, the little goblin that led us in here came back. They exchanged a few words in Gobbledegook before the other goblin took off once again.
“Everything alright here?” the warm velvet voice said, causing some of the warm breath to brush against my neck; I had to repress a shiver and moan at the closeness of my mate to my person.
Harry bit his lip, having known that Draco would ask the question, questions that Harry could not answer himself. He looked everywhere for an answer himself, but he always found none. Just like he was back in the Dursley’s, Harry was once again left in the dark unsure of what he is supposed to do, or what the correct answer was.
“As you can see here, Mr. Potter has a lot of connections thanks to the Potter’s blood, Black blood and the dead line of Morgan Le Fay, which was thought to be erased after Merlin. We will be looking into how exactly you are related to her, but it appears that an old squib line that your mother is from is the reason.”
Hello lovelies, I hope you all are doing good! Sorry for taking so long between chapters, college has been non-stop lately and I can barley get any breather room to do anything.

At the end there is a little thing I want you guys to do for me, I left a little challenge in the end notes for you to read. I hope to see what you guys think of this chapter and what you guys come up with for the challenge. There is one more thing I have to say it's a big fat thank you to amandadubose88 for being the beta to this chapter! :) you are an amazing friend and supporter of mine, so thank you! Well enough from me, I will let you guys get to the story.
Levi said to the boy, using their mental link. He was keeping a close eye on the man in front of them, unsure if he trusted the man just yet. He and the Headmaster both smelt of death and lies; but there was something more dangerous to the Headmaster than to the man in front of them. The man in front of them smelt sick, but not the type of sick one was used to, Levi was unsure of what that meant so all he could do was watch afar and make sure that his Hatchling was safe. Harry relaxed knowing that he was not alone anymore, he took the tea from in front of him, letting the warm drink also work its magic, letting it warm him from the inside out.
Harry had gone to Severus quarters now at least three times to talk with Levi, and as well as inform his head of house of a headache that happened in DADA. Severus frowned at the news, but Harry only chalked it up to the way the man talked, and ran around in circles. Severus gave him a headache reliever for when he was having troubles in the class, and told him come to him for when he need more.
“That would be fine, boy, but if you so much come back late or didn’t do your chores, it is your own head.” She smiled with a wicked smile that would make anyone shudder in disgust. Harry only nodded before leaving to go back to cupboard to get the tin box before making his escape from the house; to the secluded destination of the park.
“Malfoy,” Harry plucked up the courage to speak first, “I wanted to say I am sorry for not accepting your friendship at the beginning for first year, I am sorry for the hell we put you through. I am sorry for everything this war has done… But if possible… Can we put this behind us?” Harry asked optimistically. Hoping they can end whatever silly hatred thing they had going on.
It took a while for him to hear the soft voice above him, cooing at him to calm down telling him that he was safe. His exhausted body sagged in refile his ragged, his heavy eye lids forced open. First he saw a pair of mercury pair of eyes staring at him with such concern, but the softness of his voice never wavered. Next he saw Severus standing just at the foot of his bed, dressed in his nightwear, fear written on his face.
“I think that answers your question Draco,” Gemma said with a smile, looking at the young Slytherin as he looked around the room. Harry was too, he spotted the door on the other side of the room, but in its way, was a broom. Taking a closer look at the fluttering wings he noticed that they were keys.
Draco face went whiter than what is already was; Gemma let a small gasp pass her lips. Being children of other dark followers, of course they have heard about the Dark Lord and what he could do.
The Dark Lord hissed to the snake. The only reason why he was here was for the stupid stone. He wanted his body back and the stone seemed like his only ticket, but it just so happened this was the same year one Harry Potter was here. He was going to, as the muggle say, get two birds with one stone while he was here, but things kept on getting stranger and stranger, and he didn't like it.
Levi said to his Hatchling when he noticed that the sun had disappeared long ago. Harry’s head whipped up from the book that he was reading to see what Levi was talking about, cursing softly at how late he was. He picked up everything he brought with him.
A girl made her way to the stool and sat down looking a little bit sick, and stiffened when the hat was placed on her head.
:) I hope that you like this chapter it was more light then the first chapter sadly slightly shorter, most of the chapters that I have types so far are 2,000 words or more. Please leave kudos and comments on what you think of this twist in the story, and if you like it. If you have request, or question and you are too shy to ask on here please email me at demondog136@yahoo.com I do enjoy reading what you have to ask. Well until next chapter lovelies! <3
The words echoed in Harry’s mind as the snake left and in its place a very angry Vernon staring down at the boy in disgust.
“Trevor!” Neville shouted, scrambling out of their boat and on to the shore line scooping up the toad in his hands smiling, “Thank merlin I found you Gran would have been so mad if I lost you.” The boy said to his toad. Everyone stared at the boy holding the toad, Neville notice the stares and blushed crimson before retreating to the back of the group.
The two older Malfoy’s looked up at Severus begging for information on why there was this thing hanging on the boy, and the boy letting it happen instead of screaming.
Hermione surprised both Draco and Harry as she was placed in Gryffindor, along with Neville. They were happy for the two, and agreed silently that they would stay friends with them, along with the twins of course.
“No, you didn’t, it was to be expected. Draco and I are here if you ever want to talk about you went through, or if you don’t want to talk to us, then I can get a mind healer for you to talk to.”
The snake hissed to the younger wizard, and as if the boy could understand the snake. The dreams went away and the child went into a deeper more restful sleep. The Dark Lord was again surprised, he knew the child did not have an ounce of Slytherin blood in his body, so there was no way the child should understand the snake.
With that last little thought, I rolled out of bed and made my way to the shower to begin this long day.
Tom had become a stable part in their lives even if it only had been a few short months. He was becoming almost an Uncle or maybe another Father figure to Harry, but to say in the least he had been helping with everything. Taking control over the wards to keep the headmaster out, helping dismantle the charms that Harry had, and just offering up his home. Knowing that the headmaster would not think to look for them there.
“Sorry about the dragon, my mum had it painted before I was born, and we haven’t gotten around to painting over the thing yet.”
“Slytherin, of course, every Malfoy has always ended up in Slytherin.” Draco said proudly, studying Harry, “What about you? Have you thought about what house you would like to go into?”
So before I got around to fixing it, Merlin told Harry that he was going to be the Dark Lord, but I hated it, but I just couldn't change it for the longest time. So shortly before posting I was able to make the changes to make myself a little happy with the outcome.
Harry saw Hermione shove her way past the red head boy, noticing that her eyes where glistening a little.
My nerves settled down to just background noise when Draco gave my shoulder a squeeze, and a sly smile, he always knew what needed to be done. Maybe I am just a burden to him; he would be the perfect mate for anyone.
“Call me Harry, I mean we aren’t in school anymore and with how close we’ve been this year I think you have every right to call me by my name.”
“Harry has been having nightmares the whole time he has been home. We are concerned for both his mental health, as well as his general health with the lack of sleep he has been getting. Sadly, we cannot tell what sort of dreams he has been having seeing that he would not talk to us about what’s going on.” Severus said, meeting the blue eyes of the healer.
Harry whined he loved Draco’s fingers in his arse and if he was not in heat he would have enjoyed the loving attention he was receiving but he need his alpha in him he was burning inside and out and need his Alpha now. “Alpha please, please please, need you, need your cock in me, need the knot. Breed me alpha please please, give me your pups!” Harry begged over and over, but Draco just kept using his fingers.
Severus was the first to react. His magic swirling around the room making it hard to breathe. Planning many different ways on how to kill those muggles for doing such a thing to his son! How dare they do that to a Kid; let alone his son. They were going to pay.
That was the last journal entry since today was the 16th of July, Alec was sick to his stomach at the actions that took place. He was unsure of what he could possibly do, at this moment in time. All he wanted to go do was hunt this muggle down and bring him to justice, but right now Harry needed him here, to talk about everything. It tore him up of what this kid went through in his short 11 years he has lived, and is continuing to live through night after night. He closed the Journal and turned to face Harry ready to talk to the young wizard. To his shock, but least of all surprise he found the young boy asleep, curled up with drying tearstains on his face. Alec did not have the heart to wake up the young boy, after all the sleepless nights he has been having instead he would let him sleep, and go talk to his guardians about the actions, and possible imprisonment of a certain muggle.
“’Mione don’t worry about Ron said please, he is just upset that you are better than him in every way possible.” Harry said, taking a seat outside the stall Hermione barricaded herself into, “so there is no reason to cry over such a stupid person if they can’t see how nice you are.”
“Thank you sir, for what you have done for tonight. We are taking our leave, so that we can look after our nephew.” Malfoy Senior said as Severus scooped the child into his arms, very concerned from the lack of emotion from the child and how cold he felt. Lucius then placed muggle bills into the owner’s hands. “Here is for your troubles sir, and I hope that we can come back again. Good night.” With that, they all left the shop, unsure of how they could fix their broken Harry once again.
The three adults started to chant in Latin, using phrases that Harry had yet study, it sound more like they were singing a promise to the air around them. The room grew warm and he felt the magic in the air began to thicken. The fire of the log, that was burning a bright yellow organ seemed to flicker changing from green to now a purple color flickering as the magic crackles around them. At this point the singing had stopped and the elder Malfoy was brought his hands above the fire, where it seemed to lick his hand but yet not burn the white pale skin.
They drew closer to the castle which was a hunting sight, even in the distance it was big, so the closer the got it appeared huge. The boats docked at the other shore line and there waiting was a single toad.
“I was soo worried are you okay is the baby okay?” I asked quickly noticing that Harry wasn’t holding our child and was scared that something happened to them.
Draco let out a low coo, as he tried to ease my pain the best he could. I could feel both the older Malfoys looking at us with a smug smile, but I was too busy with Draco. He released my hand and that was when I saw that the cut that had once been on my hand was now healed. I was in shock, I did not know that Veela had a healing ability for their mates, or maybe it was just a Dom thing. I will have to ask Draco about that later. Because our attention was being called back to the goblin who now had in hand a paper turned in our direction that was just filled with names and vault numbers.
“I’m fine just a strange feeling is all,” I answered as I felt the strange pressure leaving, and finished our short walk to the living room.
“How many are there?” His cousin asked browsing over everything with a fine eye much like what his dad did over the breakfast.
The last few days had been hell for the small home. Harry’s nightmares continued and showed no signs of letting up anytime soon.  Poor little Harry had large dark bags under his eyes.
Sorry lovelies for the long wait, I was swamped with exams and papers over the last few weeks, but fear not the semester is almost over I only have next week! So I might be able to get back to regular postings again :) anyways here is a short chapter and very late at that. I will be trying to get back to your comments and answer questions when I can~ I do hope you enjoy the chapter
Draco pulled away breathing hard gave Harry’s neck a small lick as to apologize at his roughness. Harry head rolled on his shoulder his eye very tired. In the mirror he look sated at the situation, his belly bigger now from the extra cum that was filling him once again. He purred and his hands went to his stomach stroke the tender muscled there.
Just when it started, it was over as they both pulled back. Blushing at the feeling of warmth the kiss left behind, neither one of them could look each other in the eye. Neither spoke a word as the sound of a door formed behind them. Nothing was said as they left in silence, but neither feeling as a lone as they did when they first entered.
I blinked in shock, my head snapping up at Ragnok. They have been trying to get hold of me? Why haven’t I ever gotten something like that?
The Dursley decided to take a break from the hot sun outside, and relax in the reptile enclosure for a bit. Harry of course had to follow where ever they went so they could make sure that he did nothing “freaky” while at the same time pretend that he didn’t exist to the world. At one point Harry was in front of a snake enclosure just admiring the lovely serpent, when Dudley decided to join. The Snake of course was done for the day of people pressing their fat ugly mugs into its glass and was taking a nap not paying attention to the outside world anymore. Dudley wasn’t having it, for his birthday he wanted all the animals to at least do something for his day.
“W-w-well Mr. P-P-Potter, seeing that you are f-f-free, w-w-would you like to j-j-join me for t-t-tea?” The Professor offered Harry, looking at the young boy wringing his hands together with nerves.
“Harry,” Draco said, taking Harry’s chin and lifting it back up to look eye to eye with him, “It isn’t your fault, there is no need to worry. What happened last night is not something anyone can control, but Severus and I are here for you. Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked, knowing sometimes it’s better to talk to someone about things, and he wanted to be that person for Harry. If not, he knew Severus would go find a sort of healer for him.
Alright guys pole time once again! :) Since I did not add Nev in this chapter it gives me a chance to pull a small pole, like I did at the beginning of this story. I want to know three things! 1.) do you want Nev's mate to Theo or Blaise? Or is there someone else you want? 2.) Do you want Nev to be Dom or Sub? 3.) what creature do you want Nev's mate to be? I want to hear your thoughts, and I might end up taking up your idea :) I think it's fun to have the readers create the story along with me.
For the rest of the train ride Draco, filled Harry in on what to expect of the opening feast. He then promised that even if they where is separate houses, Draco would be there for him; even if he was in Gryffindor. Harry didn’t understand Draco’s hatred for Gryffindor, but happy that Draco would be there for him.
“Tell them for me Alec… Levi says if I don’t he would tell Tom himself…” Alec looked over to the snake and mouthed a thank you. Knowing that Levi was looking out for the best for Harry.
It was as if the room noticed the somber mood and what the wizards needed in that moment a large jug of fire whisky appeared next to the mugs. Draco took the bottle and poured them each a glass.
“W-Well sir his real name is Leviathan, and well, er, he is a snake.” Harry cursed himself for sounding so stupid.
“Good morning to you too Harry, I’m surprised that a first year like you is awake.” Harry’s eyes grew dark at the statement, but it wasn’t Gemma’s fault.
“As you know, Harry has been having very vivid nightmares…” Alec began looking at the two, “these nightmares were just the beginning of bringing up suppressed memories.”
Draco ran up to the Head Table, making his way up to his Head of House, grabbing the sleeve his robe. Severus spun around as he was going to making his out of the hall to help like every teacher was going to do. “Draco what are you doing up here? You are supposed to making your way to safety with the Prefects!” Draco tried to steady his shaking hands as he looked up at Severus.
Severus looked at Alec before his magic died down, and he slumped in sadness. Sad that he couldn’t protect his son from what had been done to him.
This continued on for several minutes before the boy calmed down enough to see that he was not in the place of dreams anymore, but instead in the warm embrace of his Papa, with Tom sitting next to the bed keeping his distance from the pair. The boy’s tears slowed, but did not stop. Sniffles and hiccups could now be heard from the younger wizard, as he buried himself deeper into the night cloak his father threw over him in a rush; seeking warmth and comfort from the memories that lingered in his mind, chasing away the fear.
“Harry today I want to ask about these nightmares you have been having. You father, is very concerned with this, and has asked me to talk to you about this.”
“Vault 687,” Griphook said, looking back at the wizards as they struggled out of their seats of the mine cart.
Harry quickly placed the food upon the kitchen table, which today was surrounded by the overabundance of presents, and quickly made his way to make a cup of coffee for his uncle. The door swung open to revealed his oversized uncle making his way into the kitchen, Harry handed him his black coffee, in a mundane white mug, before sitting himself to the side of the table. His uncle took his seat at the head of the table inspecting the food with a through eye as too make sure that he didn’t botch up the food. After a few seconds of looking at everything taking a sip of his coffee.
“I am sorry to hear that, please take a seat Luna tell me more about your adventure to South America,” I smiled up at her waving my hand to the empty chair across from me.
love kudos and comments on your thoughts about what you thought of the chapter so leave those below as well ~Gives best puppy dog eyes possible~ please?
“Ohh Harry we could never hate you, Severus loves you soo much, and so does Tom. They are very worried about their little boy who is in so much pain. They want to help you, but they are unsure how to go about it.” Alec said, “So am I, Harry we all want to help you, but you have to let us.” Harry sobs where just hiccups now, and he laid limp in Alec’s arms. “We want to help you Harry, but I need to be able to tell Severus and Tom.”
Harry just nodded, this was the first thing that Harry has ever had that belonged to his real Father, if only now he had something from his Mother, but he wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
“I understand Harry, do not be afraid to approach us when you are ready to talk to someone please. We are here to help you as much as you will allow us.” Severus explained. “There is one more thing that I would like to ask you.” Harry looked back up at Severus, as he pulled his hand away from his lip. “How would you feel if someone else took custody over you?” Harry eyes widened and his breath hitched.
It was about 1:30 in the afternoon before Severus emerged from the green flames of the Floo. He and his robes making such a dramatic entrance that he would have even the older students cowering in their seats. Harry and Draco where sitting on the love seat opposite of the Lord and Lady Malfoy enjoying a cup of tea while Levi and Neit where curled up by the fire, but out of the way for visitors who like to show up unannounced. Levi hated being here or at Hogwarts since the winter here are not made for snakes and had been hissing and grumbling so much that even the Malfoy’s swore that they understood him. Severus just raised an eyebrow at the snake before walking more into the open room. Harry had a small smile on his face when he looked at the meanest teacher at Hogwarts, if anyone said anything, Severus would deny that he might have smiled back to the smaller boy.
She regretted feeling nice about not knowing what they were saying; now she was dying to know. Soon enough, the woman disappeared from the portrait leaving a sighing boy behind.
to extinguish the flames. Seeing the fire dying, the water flowing, and hearing the sobs beside him were enough to let his own tears fall.
“When I was coming back, I sensed a strong magical fluctuation. I followed it and found a Ward; it was a powerful Ward that could put the ones from the Parliament to shame. When it fell, I found him inside. I think he created it, or more like his magic created it.” Lord Dahl mused out loud the events of the night.
He was still young, not even 30 years-old, with long blond hair, high cheekbones, a sharp nose and blue eyes; a handsome man to most women. So, if he so wished, he could meet another woman to conceive another Heir. Those would be the thoughts of the Noble Houses if they knew the truth about his situation. They would parade their daughters in front of him to pick like cattle. After all, who wouldn't want to be part of the Noble of Most Ancient House of Dahl?
The overall situation was too much for Sirius and Remus was of no help either. Or more like, both didn't know how to deal with everything that was happening around them.
"Grandma, why are these people looking at me?" Asked a pudgy boy while hiding behind the skirts of his grandma to avoid being looked at by the people who were also in Gringotts waiting to be attended.
A suuuuper long chapter for this fic... Let me remind you that this fic only had three chapters written so far and that it won't be updated soon. I hoped you enjoyed these three chapters... I will try my best to finish my other fics so I can resume this one.
Lord Dahl thought it was lucky that he himself was not sick, as that would have meant the disappearance of the most prominent house in Magical Sweden. Not only the Parliament would be in such disarray if that would happen, though, he also didn't want to think what the rest of the Magical community would do. So, although it was Lady and Heir Dahl that were going to die, there still was one remaining family member.
"Master Malfoy, sir, there's being guests in the Receiving Room, sir." The elf squeaked rubbing its hands together, nervous. He was young and new so he was prone to make mistakes.
They were staying in the Ancestral House of Black because a week after the funeral, Sirius was notified by his mother that his brother, Regulus, was missing and when she went to check on the Family Tapestry, it showed that his little brother was dead. Walburga Black, regrettably confessed to Sirius that he wasn’t officially disowned due to his Father’s, Orion Black, wish. He was simply erased from the Tapestry or burnt, just how it looked; meaning he had been Lord Black since his Father’s death.
Sirius stayed silent after those words. His friend was right, they were about to fall down to pieces -or at least he was going to get torn to pieces by the werewolf if he kept fighting him. Their best friend's family was gone. His own family was practically gone with Regulus dead. His Mother, even alive, didn’t count. Remus had nobody but him and he still had to deal with the full moon. It wasn't hard to think that all the problems of the world were on their shoulders. They were alone. Maybe...
No more, though. He not only had one but two kids. It was a bit of a shame that they were both girls but it had been a long time since the last female Malfoy was born that he didn't care they weren't boys. Due to his standing of the second richest family in Wizarding Britain, then there was no doubt that whoever married his little girls, they would be marrying into the Malfoy family and not his girls marrying to another family.
"What do you mean he's gone?" She asked when they separated. The black bags under her eyes, contrasting with the whiteness of her skin, reminded him that she had been having less and less sleep due to the constant calls of their Lord for meetings. It showed how much she cared for him, and how worried and stressed she had been lately. It was a relief that she never took that much interest in whatever Lucius was into and never believed in what he was fighting for, as she never received the Mark like him.
"Lady, you cannot go further," a young Auror said stopping her strides. She threw him a nasty glare and the young man flinched back, but when she was about to make a biting comment another aged voice beat her to it.
"Miss Capella." The woman's voice took her out of her thoughts and she felt ashamed that she had started to zone out. "My son tells me you are in a bit of a problem." Capella blinked. The woman was speaking in English to her. Granted, she had an accent but she could understand. Capella nodded and glanced at Henrik who was looking at his Mother with reverent eyes. Capella felt a bit irritated to be forgotten but continued to pay attention to the woman. "I already explained Henrik how to unblock the Fireplace. Your impromptu arrival blocked it since you are not part of the family. Once it is unblocked, just say the place where you want to go and it will take you."
"Then, let's make a deal." She said with all the intention of the world. Her daughter, despite her age of 6 years old, was a bit skeptical. Guarded, would be the word. "If you find someone who can take both your sister and you as Wives before you turn 15, then forget about the betrothal. If not, your birthday present will be a betrothal with one of the few men without one."
But Augusta's expression was not the same as him. A scowl appeared on her face while she wondered why the Dark Lord had to attack her son's house. There was no way that a pair of Aurors and a baby were any threat to him. She wanted answers.
A blond man hurried along the drive, almost tripping in his haggard appearance, even forgetting that Apparating to the large and sumptuously decorated entrance hall of the house would have been easier than walking all the way to the doors. But he had news that would change his future and the one of his family. Whether it was good or bad news, he would leave it to the joint decision between him and his Wife.
"Nej...it...ok." Henrik scolded himself for not paying attention to his English tutor. Now he needed to make use of his limited English but he was sure that he was going to embarrass himself in front of the British girl; the accent telling on her. Capella frowned when she heard the response; she had the feeling that she was not in England anymore, what with his accent and the... nej. She stood straighter and clearing her throat, she curtsied.
"As if you have any right to say that to me! You are the pettiest man I've known my whole life, what with being a werewolf-!"
“Salazar’s knob, your arse feels fucking amazing!” Draco panted as he sped up his thrusts, his orgasm speeding up on him.
Harry snorted at that. It wasn’t the first time his tongue seemed to move faster than his brain, but so far his moxie had worked in his favour. “You know I can’t promise that, Hermione,” he said, fighting back a grin.
Harry gave the driver his address and proceeded to spend the rest of the cab fighting every instinct in his body that was screaming at him to pounce on Draco. The fact that the man took advantage of the dark shadows in the backseat to let his hand wander up the inseam of Harry’s denims, close enough to graze against Harry’s rapidly filling cock.
After a few minutes, Harry spun around at the sound of the heavy door creaking open again to see Draco emerge wearing a soft grey coat which perfectly accentuated his eyes. “So Lettice works for Big Lettuce?” Harry asked as they turned and began walking down the street, Draco leading the way.
Lucius eyes slid over to the Boy Who Lived, sitting beside Draco. His mind was a jumble of anger, resentment, and gratitude that he didn’t have the time to sort through right now. Potter’s testimony in Narcissa and Draco’s favour had been pivotal to their light sentences, and he couldn’t help but feel a newfound gratitude for the kid. As he stared, lost in his thoughts, Harry reached out and placed his hand on Draco’s forearm in an act of comfort and he couldn’t help but notice how the tension in Draco’s shoulders seemed to ease.
“Umm… sure,” Harry agreed reluctantly. One shot to be polite and then he could go back and pick up where he left off with the blond.
“I’m Draco’s alibi, I definitely think I’m part of it.” Harry crosses his arms, scowling. “What has become of the Auror department? Maybe I should file a report to Kingsley…”
“Thank you, Hogwarts,” children and teenagers with all different kinds of voices say as they pat the school walls.
“Don’t worry, he won’t bite. If you have any trouble, bring him back to me. Potter, I’ll show you the Eighth Year bedroom later.”
“Ah,” Das nods. “Same, I have to get my mum to send me stuff, but she doesn’t like using owls...Muggle, you know.” She gives Michelle a side glance, as though waiting to see if the-dastardly-Slytherin would say anything snide about it.
Harry froze, eyes wide. Then, his eyes narrowed, lips tugging into a smirk. “So you’re calling me handsome,” he said.
“Mr Malfoy! You’re back! You’re back!” Jamie stands up. His eyes widen as he notices Charlie Weasley. “Are you the dragonologist Charlie Weasley? The one who works with dragons
“You’re such a Slytherin,” River says. “Fine, bring your table over here. And tell Mesa to come over too, she’s watching us...”
Blaise smiles slightly. “You’re learning well. Maybe in a hundred more years, and you’ll be as good as me.”
, a sequence fixated very much on those lips. Draco couldn’t wait to render it in loving, immortalised detail and tease Harry with it.
“He apparated,” Malfoy responded coldly. “If you incite disorder and disruption on Diagon Alley, you are liable for a large fine. Do you understand?”
Richard Garren has already decided to quit at the end of the academic year. He has started to organise a job that doesn’t involve children, brewing potions in a new potions apothecary set up by a group of muggleborns—though he will later find out that
There are a lot of people looking at him this morning. Flitwick has a complicated considering expression, and Hagrid clearly wants something from Draco.
Draco’s cock hardened further. He reached down and gripped his own cock hard to stop it from forcing its way into Harry. He had to go slowly. He had to make Harry love it so much that Harry would want to get fucked again and again.
Warm fires crackle from the fireplaces around the Slytherin Common’s perimeter and many candles light the ceiling like a carpet of stars. Holly and ivy hang from the walls, and the scent of pine permeates the air.
But Garren knows how to pull a polite smile regardless of his emotions. “Thank you, Minerva. Is there anything else?”
When Draco and the other Slytherins approach the Great Hall for dinner, Granger and Weasley are standing outside, eyes scanning the incoming crowd.
“...You all get dressed first, there’s some chocolate in the basket…” Draco’s voice is low and husky, and surprisingly close.
After a meeting with McGonagall, Draco descends down the stairs. He pauses by a window, which is slightly open and letting in a warm breeze, carrying joyful laughter. He can see students in their casual wear from his vantage point, scattered across the green lawns and colourful gardens and adventure playground. Some students appear to be asleep with their books covering their faces. In the distance, he can make out the motion of students whizzing across the quidditch pitch.
Draco and Harry glance at each other. Pansy smirks at the establishment of their silent couple communication.
Malfoy sighs heavily, and hands Harry the chess set. They get back into the cart, and it starts moving back up.
“Hey, I want to play too!” Harry says. “I recently made a new card that summons a silver-eyed white dragon with really good attack ability.”
Harry childishly poked Draco in the thigh. “I’m not scared!” he said, while not looking Draco in the eye. “I have some spare quilts so that we can each have a set.”
Magicked snow blanketed Wizarding London (Muggle London had no snow), and soon the Christmas season was upon Christmas-celebrators.
Pomfrey’s lips purse. With sharp jabby movements, she casts the diagnostic spells on Draco. “Still running a high temperature,” she mutters. Her sharp eyes flick up to Draco. “The were-dragon is bleeding into your daily life.”
“One of the fireplaces here is connected to the Floo network with firecall access. You could, hypothetically, use it to contact anyone you wish.”
“And I’m Jamie Ottley, a pleasure to meet you,” Jamie says coolly, trying to project a sense of Mr Malfoy.
risking these books until Hogwarts is stabilised. Many portraits and statues from the lower floors have also been bought out.
Harry’s eyes widen as his head turns towards the wall that separates this room from his and Draco’s.
Draco can see the conflicted expression on Harry’s face. But he will not compromise on safety, not right now.
Draco throws more of his own power into the wards, feeling as it weaves in with Felicity’s from the other side of the pitch. For a brief moment, the wards shimmer, especially in the eyes of those more visually sensitive to magic.
Harry sends the last of his gardening tools back home, just as Andromeda and Teddy emerge from the house.
“As a new Slytherin, I need to make sure your academic skills meet my standards,” Malfoy says self-importantly. He leads Harry to a table a little away from other students and casts a light muffling charm around them.
Harry squeaked when Draco suddenly pushed his legs apart again. “You’ve already watched him getting fucked.”
Pansy waves a careless hand. “Sort it out, boys. Our bed is calling me.” Without further ado, she heads up the stairs.
Harry tried not to shift uncomfortably in his own clothes, which were much more casual. Dark jeans, leather jacket, a clean shirt…
It’s the thestrals! A group of adult thestrals emerge from the Forest. In a wave, everyone notices them.
Narcissa takes one sip of her tea first. Then, she lets the teacup rest in her hands as she speaks, “Now, darling, how have you been? Your letters have been quite short of late. Some of your most recent missives were...quite confusing.”
Narcissa looks between Draco and at the others, her eyes narrowing on Harry. This time, Draco moves to stand in front of Harry, blocking her view. “Mother, I’m glad you’re safe.”
Draco gave him an unimpressed look. “You’re a useless source of muggle knowledge. Don’t worry, I’ll determine the wizarding equivalent, and create a drawn movie of you. Remember those loving drawings I sent you back in Hogwarts?”
The thestral leader tries to reprimand him again, but it’s too late. The little thestrals now want to copy Draco.
The day after the match, Pomfrey finally lets Draco go. Blaise accompanies him out, under strict orders from Pomfrey to look after him.
In the morning, as the students wake up, get dressed, and have some light breakfast thanks to Harry, Draco extends his invitation once again.
Guilt slogs up Draco’s throat as he throws the door open and descends upon Sequoia Hawks, slumped over her table. A student seated behind her leans back, smirking. The soul orb is held in their hands under the fucking table, its aim pointed at Sequoia.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hair again, tugging him back. Sensation sparked across Harry’s scalp, going straight down to his groin.
“Unlike an animagus, I cannot transform my clothes with my body,” Malfoy says. “Do you really want to watch me strip?”
. Harry reigns his magic in, which makes him feel antsier. He takes another deep breath and exhales.
“I remembered at the beginning when you and Hermione weren’t so…” Harry sighs, trailing off. “I suppose there’s no rule that my friends must also be each other’s friends. But future family dinners will sure be awkward.”
all of the others who helped build the castle. Over the years, thousands of students of all four Houses have walked the halls and corridors, adding their own magic. Take away one-fourth of that magic, and the rest of the castle can no longer stand. Hogwarts is not Hogwarts without all four Houses. Gryffindor is fundamental to Hogwarts. Hufflepuff is fundamental to Hogwarts. Ravenclaw is fundamental to Hogwarts. And so, Slytherin is also fundamental to Hogwarts.”
Harry collapsed onto Draco’s body, trying to breathe. He descended slowly from the high, and he didn’t want to move at all.
“Forget it then,” Ron grumbled. “Hermione, sign me up to some more cooking classes. Maybe if it’s not my mum, then I might learn better…”
“My dear lady,” Blaise greets the entrance portrait, “I hope the commotion has not bothered you too much. Have you done something new with your hair? It looks particularly lucious today.” His voice is calm and unhurried, in contrast to tension, ready-to-snap magic of Hogwarts.
The first years all filed around the front of the head table where McGonagall placed a four legged stool down along with a rugged looking hat. Harry just stared at the hat, wondering how this was going to put them in the house they belong to. Just then the hat moved and a great rip near the brim of the hat appeared, and the hat began to sing:
Harry quickly made his way out of the Christmas room, with Severus following him closely. Harry led him to a sun room overlooking the gardens. At the moment everything that was in the gardens was dead, for the winter storms came upon the manor unexpectedly, not giving the house elves enough time to protect the plants so the yard below was a barren land, frosted over with ice, and a blanket of white sat upon the ground. Off to the side there was the pond that they had ice skated on, as well as the stables which housed horses and other creatures expertly taken care of as well. The inside of the room very inviting. It was decorated in natural colors, the walls a warm tan, it had couches and chairs, both a brown color, a few green pillows, a table in which food was severed on, and a few house plants in the room. Some of them trees, others flowers sitting in the window giving the room life. With a quick call to the elves, they had abundant amount of food, as well as a hot coco for Harry and some tea for Severus.
It was shortly after sun down that the newly instated father and son both walked into their living area and looked at each other, thinking about their lives, and inevitably the war as well. It was what seemed like hours going over everything the thought and felt to be right. Severus explained a lot more about the Dark side this time, opening up and explaining why he joined. Severus told Harry about the controlling factors of both sides, and how there was no for sure that either would come out alive. Harry expressed his thoughts and feelings on the war and everything that he had read up until that point, and everything he felt from both men. It was a hard time for both, trying to figure out what might be safest route for them to take, and everything that they might go through.
Hello Lovelies, I hope that you all are have been good first I want to thank everyone for the birthday wishes :) and then apologize of how long it took me for this chapter.

So thank you all for being patient in waiting for the next chapter!

Like I don't know if words can even descried how happy I am for something like that could happen to me! So once again thank you for everything, for reading for leaving comments and Kudos, everything guys!
“How did you even mange this?” Harry asked as he slowly unraveled Draco from the silver glitter mess.
“Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Malfoy! Thank you for coming. Heir Malfoy, welcome! Mr. Potter, we are pleased to see you.” The young goblin quickly ran through our names with no introductions needed (I guess if you are part of a well-known pure-blood family and have an appointment this would happen). “If you follow me, please, Ragnok, the head of your accounts, is expecting you and he will help you with everything you desire to have done today.”
“Good morning to you too, sir. What can I do for you?” Harry asked, unsure what to call Severus now that they were at Hogwarts.
that you should have read, there is a hat that will decided what house you go in.” He explained to Harry, his friend blushing knowing that he really should read the book. Just when Harry was to retort to his friend’s jab, shrieks from behind them caused them to turn around and look. About twenty ghosts suddenly started to stream in looking at the first years with great interest. They started to talk amongst themselves some talking to other students about the houses and hoping that they were in theirs. Harry smiled at the excitement that never seemed to dim in the wizarding world, when he was about to give up hope on everything this world came to him; it had introduced him to a new life and one that he looked with great excitement and eyes open wide at the sight of new adventures that await him.
“Shhh, child I’m here, you are safe. Those monsters are not going to hurt you anymore.” A voice said through his sobs and pleas; hands rubbing his back in a soothing gesture, instead of bringing pain.
“No, No baby! Don’t think like that. We where waiting until we got the all clear from Alec, we would like you to be there, since I will be putting you as Heir to the prince line. Since the blood adoption was done, we can put you down. But we didn’t want to take you out too soon.” Severus tired to explain, he didn’t want Harry to think it was his fault.
After getting back from the dinner, Harry had been completely shut down, the happy boy that they had grown use to now was completely numb. Severus sat Harry down on the couch and turned his back for a moment to fetch a calming potion, and when he turned back around the boy had disappeared. Severus was disappointed, the boy had taken off and hadn’t talked to him, and it hurt him. He had shown the child that he had cared for him, and at the sight of those muggles, had Harry back into his shell hiding from everyone again. Severus went in search of the young dark haired wizard, determined to show him that he was such more than what those muggles said.
“Can I know who this Levi is?” Severus inquired, he knew this Levi couldn’t be dangerous to Harry, but he was still cautious.
It was a very awkward time, silently sipping the cocoa, staring listlessly into the fire and thinking back on the war and everything leading to this moment. It’s hard to tell who broke the thickening silence first but someone did.
All and all, it was a pleasant morning with no spells flying around and no insults shared, so I counted this as a win. It was then that Draco dropped a bombshell. “Harry, I would like for you to meet my parents.” I felt my blood drain away from my face at that thought, and my breakfast threatened to make a reappearance.
“Certainly.” He pointed to the first on the right, “This is the lordship ring to the Potter line and the one next to it is the lordship ring to the Black line.”
“Yes, of course there is a potion for it. It was made mainly for small children in mind, since they are more susceptible to the slight changes in balance in the inner ear, but was later adapted for older witches and wizards who just could not get the hang of flooing,” Draco answered with much patience and not rubbing it in my face about the common knowledge of this potion. I just nodded, fascinated by the many functions potions can offer the magical community.
Gemma and Draco made it back to the key section of the cHamber when they saw Professor Snape and his flowing robes jogging up to the chamber, with a very angry snake on his tail.
Griphook smiled, showing all his pointy teeth to the young wizard. At least this wizard was smart enough to ask the goblin for help, instead of taking his money in one go. Yes, he liked this wizard a lot already.
This is a short and to the point chapter, it seems that everyone was tired of goblins and banks lolz. So yea this is short then the last few chapters and I am sorry for that. I also will not have as much time to write, but hopefully I can work something out because I got a summer job :) woo hoo! but I will see about writing during my free time when I have some. I hope that this chapter answers some of the question you had, but sorry about not going into detail, I wanted to, but the characters where done with everything and would not let me write >.> bad characters. Anyway if you do have question on things I accidentally left out, ask them either at my email or in the comments and I will try to answer them!
The whole hall was quite till the end of the hats song, before applauding and cheering. It bowed to each of the tables as if it knew how great it was, before going still once again.
Severus just smiled coldly. “No, he doesn’t, he is now my charge in every legal aspect. You will never see him again.”
Harry just shook his head no, but didn’t tell him anything about it. Not wanting to worry his friend about anything, “Just thinking that I need to see Levi tonight, but with all the homework we have, I don’t know how I am going to do it.” Harry said, easily coming up with a quick lie for his friend, Draco just smiled.
Much to Severus disappointment though, Lucius decided to hang around with him instead of his wife and the boys. So he was forced to listen to the blonde man, talk about almost nothing, while he shopped around for the ingredients, well until one part caught his attention.
Alec had shown up exactly on time for when he scheduled the appointment. The fireplace flaring green before the dark brown-haired man stepped out of it. To his surprise instead of the young wizard that he was supposed to meet with; he came face to face with two grown wizards. Severus stood there his face grim and his own dark bags underneath his eyes as he greeted the healer. The other man was unknown to Alec. He had red eyes that made his hair stand on end. He too was sporting racoon eyes, he was just as concerned as Severus was but had an easier time hiding it.
The boy thought it over a moment, thinking of ways to get Harry in trouble while at the zoo, “Yes mother that will be okay.”
The three young Slytherins stood before the debris of the fallen chess pieces. Draco put up a fight, making sure that he, Harry, and Gemma would not be hurt in the battle that was taking place. Of course, this didn’t save them from the flying marble when one of the chess pieces where destroyed, but at least that it was healable and non-life threatening.
Hello Lovelies I hope you had a good week :) soo this chapter is unbeated I have no idea what happened and I hope to hear from them soon :( if/when they do send the chapter I will post it. I am sorry for all the mistakes that are found in the story if you find any (I know you will) please point them out or email me. (Edit 10\3: Yeah I have gotten the revised chapter so I have posted it! )
They both tried to move away from one another, but something kept them from moving apart. In fear they looked around till they spied a mistletoe formed above their heads.
Draco groaned, “my luck! Mistletoe right there,” he looked at Harry, who gave him a confused look, “You don’t know?!”
I looked at the time and realized that we have been sitting there through the afternoon, “Luna would you like to stay for dinner tonight?” I asked seeing that Draco would be home soon.
“Severus wanted to be the one here when you awoke, but he needed much rest after spending three days sitting in this chair. It took both myself and Lucius to put that man into bed,” the man said with a smile.
Hello lovelies! I am sorry that it took sooo long to get this up, my beta had a little problem with their computer and had to get it fixed. :) It's all good now and we are back in business! Okay some news I am back in college, for my spring term~ of course I have better internet here, but that also means that I am going to be doing a lot of work (again) but I will find time! :) Okay enough from me! Lets get on with the story!!
“I’m sorry Alec…” Harry murmured, and you could hear how exhausted the boy was. “I feel asleep I didn’t mean too.”
After the long day outside Harry was grateful for the AC in the house, but that was until he saw his cousin raffling through his stuff. He froze as he saw the plump boy dig the tin box from its hiding space; his cousin didn’t even realize that Harry was standing behind him, as he opened the box. Harry not caring of the consequence of this pushed his cousin from the doorway of his cupboard taking the opportunity to throw the tin box inside the small place before closing the door and standing in front of it.
“Its fine Harry, I won’t push you, you’re safe, you can talk in your own time,” Draco promised, trying to sooth his distraught friend. “Come on, let’s get dressed and talk with Severus.” Harry just nodded and followed Draco’s instructions.
Harry scowled to hide the blush, “You’re just jealous I would look better in a dress then you would Malfoy.” Draco jaw dropped his face turning a bright red as he imagined Potter in a dress.
Later that night, Harry slipped on his cloak and started to walk the school in the pitch black, he thought that if he didn’t do this now, he would never be able to find the answers that needed. He knocked upon the door of the DADA professor’s room, hoping for help.
The hall was quiet staring in shock at the small boy who calls himself Harry Potter, some think that it was a joke and that he wasn’t the real Harry Potter; others where in a state of shock and denial that the savior of the wizarding world was put in the dark house. The first house that was to recover was Slytherin, a few scowling at the sight of a half-blood in there house, others cheering. Harry just walked over and took a seat next to Draco, waiting for the sorting to be done.
Harry was a little stunned at first when Snape turned to ask him if he knew, of course he did, it was all within the book, with a small nudge from Draco, Harry was able to respond. “Y-Yes Sir.” Harry said, shaking his head to clear the thoughts that were drifting around his head away. Severus raised an eyebrow to his young charge, encouraging him to continue on with his answer, “To answer you first question, what asphodel and wormwood together do, it creates the Draught of Living Dead, next a bezoar is a stone found in the stomach of a goat, and last, there is no difference between monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant.” Harry said, trying to conjure the knowledge from what he read and understood from his potions textbook.
“It’s okay Harry I understand.” Draco promised and gave his friend a smile when his green eyes met his own grey eyes, “If there is something going on, I will help you. So don’t worry, you aren’t alone in anything. I am also sure that the other Slytherins are willing to help as well.” Harry felt his own lips tug upwards, is this what a friend was for? Someone to stick by your side when you feel lost, a person to help you in a time of need? If so Harry loved it, it made this lonely world not so lonely anymore.
“Yes, sir I did.” Harry paused a moment before continuing on “I-I am also sorry for what happened at Gringotts, and all the trouble I have caused today.” Harry cast his eyes downward, he really didn’t mean to be such a bother to the people that are trying to help him.
The day after the New Year’s party, Harry and Severus left Malfoy Manor to head back to Hogwarts. Severus needed to head back to make sure that his schedule for the next semester and all the supplies he needed were all set. He did give the choice to Harry to either stay with the Malfoy’s for rest of the holiday, or to come back to the castle with him. Of course, to Severus it would seem the child would like to stay with his friends instead of going back to the castle where there was nothing to do, and none of his friends were there at the time. Harry, not wanting to leave his new Father just yet, and much to Severus’s surprise, chose to go back with him, to enjoy having a castle all to himself. This would be a good chance to explore all the empty classrooms, and maybe ask his father help on some of the homework, or at least proofread it. So with that settled, they both said their good-byes to the Malfoy family thanking them for opening their home to them, Harry promised that he would see Draco in a week’s time, and they left.
Harry blinked slowly, unsure of what to believe. “Yes, hard to think of, isn’t it? That the big, old, Dark Lord that you never heard of wasn’t the one that killed you mummy and daddy. But I can show you, I can prove to you that I didn’t do it, little Harry. All I need is your trust.”

He settled in front of the fireplace, the logs popping every once in awhile as they burned. A soft music played from a record player somewhere in the room, a happy Christmas room. A house elf brought cookies and hot chocolate, shortly with a smile and wish of Merry Christmas. In this moment, Harry could forget he was alone, that he could enjoy in pure bliss of calm and serenity. Of course - him being Harry Potter - that didn’t last long.
Severus shot his friend a glare, angered that he raised his voice at the boy, but also angry at what the physiological damage has been done to the boy to get to this point. The older Malfoy noticed his mistake when he saw the young boy reach the way he did, his wife did try to warn him, but he didn’t believe her for a moment. Now in front of his eyes was
“I don’t know Harry here let me check to make sure that it is safe before we open it.” Severus said, taking the package from his son and casting spells to make sure there has been no tampering done. When it showed nothing, he handed it back to Harry. “Well since it is safe, I will let you open it.” Seeing that there was nothing to fear from it, Harry removed the card from the top of the package and read it.
Harry just smiled at Levi, missing the conversation they had right before Hogwarts started. “There isn’t much I can do Levi cats have a mind of their own.” He said, walking into the living room and taking a seat on the couch.
Before Harry could ask why, they were whisked away, traveling at mind boggling speeds. Harry could barely process as they passed other mine carts and other vaults. They came to a stop in front of a large vault before the goblin hopped out.
We handed the paper over to the older Malfoys so they could read. “Dear Merlin!” Cissa exclaimed as she set the paper on the desk. This was a lot more information than what I was expecting from this small visit.
“Now why would I poison you after I fought so hard to heal you back up?” was his reply, to which I did not have an answer. I tried my best to fight off the pout that was trying to set itself upon my lips at the displeasure of not knowing how to answer. I looked at Draco, Malfoy, in hopes that the pout was gone, by the look on his face I can tell I failed, his eyes shining in laughter at my pout.
“Severus what a surprise to see you, I was expecting to see Harry first than come talk to you afterwards.” Alec greeted the bat like man before him.
Harry did want to tell his friend of what happened, but he couldn’t not yet it was too soon. The memories too fresh for him, he knew one day he would tell everyone what had happen at his relatives, but today was not the day. It was a few minutes later when they finished getting ready for the day, walking out of the room, and entered into the main part of Severus quarters. There was the man sitting at the small kitchen table, sipping on a cup of coffee, he looked up upon the boys entrance.
have a lot written out at the moment, I've come to a slight stand still unsure if you guys are going to like the first part I have written. This stand still has been happening for about 4 months now, and I just grew tired of trying to write, so I decided to see what you guys think of it. Because of this, there isn't going to be a clear posting schedule, as there was for part one so I thought I would give you a heads up.
Onto the second part I have to tell you this fic only have has 2-4  chapters left in it! Yes, this part is coming to end here soon, but fear not I will be continuing on in a second part, which will be book two!
“Stupid, Potter!” Draco yelled at the raven-haired boy, “Like you could get rid of me that easily! You are not about to start on wild, crazy adventures without me. If you think so much about going on one, make sure to tell me in advance so I can save you.” Harry felt tears come to his eyes and he hugged Draco back, hiding his face in the blonde’s robes.
“You can understand me?” Timidly Harry asked looking around to make sure that the Dursley haven’t noticed this. This caught the snake’s attention, this boy seemed not to notice that he was talking in another language, so this intrigued the snake greatly. The snake lifted its self-up to look at the young hatchling and nodded. Of course this action made the oversize boy look over, Dudley was fuming that the Freak could make that snake move, how dare he do something that he couldn’t do on HIS birthday.
Harry was sitting behind the blonde as he took a step up onto the stand with the women. Madam Malkin took measurements for the blonde and writing down everything. Draco, of course, was up there scowling, unhappy that the woman had to touch him.
Harry took a step forward to the stool, since he was the smallest, he was hardly seen till he took a seat. The hat was placed on his head and jerked to life. Harry was looking at everyone in hall, nervous at the gleaming eyes, a voice whispered in his head making him jump, this voice was nothing like Levi, and it was probing through his thoughts and memories.
Levi said before Harry felt a rush of warm power rush into his mind. It gave Harry enough strength, to sit up and pound his little hands against the door a couple of times before it left him dry.
Tom sighed, “Alec is right though, we need to start taking steps now, or Dumbledore will become a pain in our sides. Severus needs to claim the Prince line and I need to claim the lines I come from, good thing no one knows that Tom Marvolo Riddle is really the Dark Lord.”
Drawn from his thoughts, the singing started once again and the magic seemed to fade from the room. Like a switch was flipped in Harry, he felt a calm come over his body, and his eye lids grew heavier with each passing second.
Harry sorted through his thoughts of Christmas, or what is known as Yule in the wizarding world according to Draco. It was planned, recently, that Harry and Draco make a trip to Malfoy Manor where Harry would stay a couple of days before Severus joined them, from there they would start the arduous journey of adoption. Harry was both excited and scared, excited because this would be his first time he would have a family that would love him, but he feared that Severus would turn on him just like his Uncle did. Of course that was ridiculous to think of, since the older wizard went through the trouble of rescuing Harry from his relatives, but that didn’t stop the fear since that is all he has ever known of a home life.
At this point, Harry let the cloak slip off and he got a better look at the room that they had entered it seemed to be a forgotten classroom. Instead of desks and chairs with years of dust, there was a mirror standing as tall as the ceiling, which was saying something, alone in the room. It was a beautiful thing, it had an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet; on the frame, there was writing on it, “Erised stra ehru oy tube cafru oyt on wohsi” but it wasn’t the words that captured Harry’s attention. It was what was reflected at him, he wasn’t alone there in the mirror. Of course he was himself and Levi staring back at them, but beside them was a man and a woman and behind them was Severus and the Malfoy’s and many others Harry did not know. It was the man and women that made tears come to Harry’s eyes; the woman had dark red hair that waved down her back, and her eyes! Yes, her eyes where almost like Harry’s, they were a bright green, dancing with life and happiness, but also sadness as tears pooled around them.
“Good morning my little elf,” Draco’s voice was so soft and soothing to hear, I couldn’t stop the blush that appeared on my checks when he called me that, “Mipsy told you were awake, so I thought that I would come join you for breakfast, if that is okay?” Draco asked me, unsure whether or not he was pushing the boundaries that we have created between ourselves at this moment. I just gave a small nod, still not trusting my body to make a fool of myself if I looked at him dead on. I did risk a quick look to  see a shining smile on his face, showing off his perfect white pearly teeth. Shit! I shouldn’t have done that! Draco now took a seat in the chair beside my bed that had yet to be moved, “Well, little elf, it looks like you have a full breakfast.” A sigh could be heard from his lips as he spied my potions, “Little one, how can I make sure you are healthy when you don’t take your potions?”
“Next time Harry please find me, and tell me, I was very worried of where you went.” Draco said softly, eyeing his friend in concern. Harry couldn’t help but smile at his friends concern, happy that for once in his life that he had someone worried about his health and well-being. He was reminded that Draco was safe, the twins were fun to be with, but they were new. Draco, however, he knew, and he knew the blond wouldn’t hurt him.
“Be still, don’t move!” the alpha ordered, his own cock twitching again within the omega, “sleep we have plenty of time little one. I will give you pups don’t worry.”
Draco, still staring at the snake in awe, asked the question on everyone’s mind. “Why do you have a snake?”
Harry was coming to get used to writing in the two separate journals, it was becoming something that was second nature to him. The first time that he had to do it, it felt stupid, but as soon as he finished the first entry it felt like someone took weight off his shoulders. So, he does it when he remembers to do so, liking the lighter feeling that it left him with. With his head much clearer, he started his search once again for information covering the stone; so far it seems to yield to nothing, in fact Harry was close to giving up hope finding such a thing. He really had one last place to check and that was with Severus and what he could possibly think of what it was.
“Shh, little one, he is not mad at you. You have nothing to fear.” The professor promised, rocking the boy back and forth.
“Of course Harry, they are not mad. In fact it was them that came to us about the papers that are being put together and having a goblin to talk about the gold flow from your accounts in the other areas without consulting you first.” Severus said, explaining something that shouldn’t be talked about just yet since it was after all very close to Christmas. “But that is a talk for another time young one, for now how about we get you ready for dinner?” Severus smiled motioned to the clothes that where set out for the younger wizard, while he slumbered.
“I would like that Alec… I’m so tired,” Harry answered laying his head back down on Alec’s shoulder letting out a yawn. His body wanting to sleep, but his mind so afraid. Alec just smiled and gently rubbed Harry’s back allowing his magic to flow through his hand into Harry gently coaxing him in to a dreamless state. He gently placed Harry back into his bed and tucked him in. Levi took it upon himself to drape his massive body over the boy, gently as he didn’t want to hurt Harry. Neit hopped up from her hiding spot underneath the bed taking her place right by his head curling up purring.
“No! I will not go with the other students! Harry is my friend and I will not leave him behind!” Draco said eyes on fire at the suggestion of being left behind. Severus cast a look at Draco, studying on how serious he was. Finally, he decided it would be safer to take Draco with him rather than having him sneak out alone.
I want to thank you guys (the readers) for all your amazing comments, for almost 300 kudos and for over 5000 views in just 5 chapters. This means the world to me, and I can't thank you enough for all the support :)
The Dark Lord explained. Harry listened carefully, slowly adding pieces of information he had himself. That is what the Cerberus was doing in the school, the Headmaster put it there to see how they would go about getting information and the rest was a secret to see if they had the power to get across all the obstacles that would be put there. Harry was upset about the Cerberus being here, where it was supposed to safe for children to learn. “
It was shortly after Severus left that Levi made his appearance, the small child had already drifted into a restless sleep, while the Dark Lord himself had found sleep, while Severus was comforting the small wizard.
“I know Nev, I know,” I said, “I was going to tell you before he stepped through, but I got wrapped up in my emotions before I could tell you. He is my mate.” I dropped the bombshell, just like that, on my brother.
Heyy lovelies, how have you been? I am very sorry about leaving you guys hanging for a long time, I really didn't mean to take a long break. But it was needed, I was unsure of how to write the next chapter and I just got a major writers block. I am still very unhappy with the chapter I am going to post, but no matter how many times I go back and fix it I still hate it. I hope you guys like it, and I hope I can pick back up on writing for this fic once again since I have finally made it past this chapter. Warning this chapter was not beta, there might be a lot of mistakes. I did try to read over it, but it got to the point all the words start to run together. If you see something that is wrong post it down in the comments so I can fix it when I have time.
Hello lovelies, sorry about the long wait yet again, I was having difficulty with finding time to write between my classes and homework; and when I did have time I just didn't have the inspiration. The semester is coming to an end next month, so hopefully I can have a more reliable updating schedule instead of being willynilly about times and how long I go without posting. Lots of Love and thanks to amandadubose88 on here for being my beta and reading over this chapter; couldn't have done it without you sweetie! And all of you lovelies and your kudos and awesome comments and being so understanding about what takes so long, so thank you. :)
Since it was growing closer to Yule, every first year was excited, and the teachers didn’t put a lot of work effort in their classes, mainly because the effort would be wasted. They were going through the exercises of different fun spells that contributed to the season, as well in Potions class they were brewing a wizarding like candy cane. Sadly it seemed that no one read their books, and had even managed to botch up the easiest of potions. Harry was really looking forward to Christmas this year, and even had owl ordered almost all the presents he needed; for Hermione, he found some transfiguration texts as well as a Charms texts, for Neville (with some help from Snape), he had found some seeds that can be useful in Potions that he can grow, since it seemed that he a knack for Herbology. For Draco, he had found a cloak that was green much like their house colors, with a silvery trim, and a silver dragon acting as the clasp with emerald eyes. For the twins he had found a prank book that he bought them, unsure if they would like it, he also got him a few pranks from the local prank store. For Madam Malfoy, he found a beautiful emerald dragon necklace, and he got Lord Malfoy a pair of cufflinks to match. For Severus, he was unsure of what to get him, what would you get your soon to be father? Harry knows that he loves potions, but was sure that everyone got Severus potions related things, but he couldn’t just give him nothing since he was doing so much for him. So for now, Harry was left present hunting for Severus keeping his eye out for something that would fit his soon to be father perfectly. For Harry this would be the first Christmas he would participate in, as well as celebrating with his new family as well. Harry wondered if Severus would allow him to call him names such as “dad” or “papa”, but he shouldn’t start to get his hopes up just in case something went wrong, and he would not become family with the dark haired wizard.
Hello lovelies :) yeah this is later in the day then I post, in all honesty I was not going to post today. (Insert gasps) Yeah, last weekend I had to take my laptop in because I thought it had virus(which it did; 32 of them) and it would take awhile for them to shuffle through everything. So I told my beta that and that I wouldn't be able to send the chapter off till late this week. Well being the amazing beta they are, I sent it off Wednesday(?) and they knocked it out! Got it back today just in time!! So everyone lets throw a big thanks their way for correcting it in such amount of time! <3 :) any who! Chapter 20 the last adoption chapter, and I will try to start on the Yule/Christmas chapter... I am still unsure how it is going to go just yet! xD I also I would love to thank you my lovelies :D thank you for over 100 bookmarks over 400 kudos and over 8,000 views! I am soo happy that you are liking the story so much, and I hope that you will stick with me to the finish line!
“Sev~” Harry whispered, the man stirred a bit in his sleep but not fully waking up, “Sev.” Harry tried again poking the man’s check this time. The man’s eyes popped open glaring at the person who dared to wake him up. Harry had to bite his lip from flinching, even though he was used to it most of the time, it was just a few days ago he ran in
“Sorry,” Harry said bashfully, “I was thinking about where to start. I guess it really started with after Sev and I left the manor to come back to Hogwarts.” Harry turned to Gemma, “I guess I should first explain what Draco already knows, but you don’t Gemma. It is not known yet, except for the Malfoy’s, I’ve lived with Severus since the start of the summer. I-I don’t want to tell you just yet how I came to be there, so please don’t ask, but I am now Sev’s ward. So, I was staying with Sev when we came back and I went exploring around the castle, w-well Professor Quirrell caught me out of the rooms one point, a-and he invited me to his room for a cup of tea.” Draco leaned forward placing his hand on Harry’s knee, he knew that Harry always got headaches when he got close to the Professor, but he had no idea of why it happened. “I got a shock of my life seems like an understatement at this point, but I found out something shocking… The Dark Lord has been Professor Quirrell this whole time, or kinda has been.” Harry set off explaining everything that happened between the Dark Lord, Sev, and himself, leaving out what happened in the past seeing as that is something that should stay between those that are close to him. He then went on explaining what the Dark Lord set for his task. “I-I am supposed to retrieve the stone for him, but he isn’t going to use it, like one would think. I-I convinced him that it would be a better move to take the stone and give it back to the owner since it seems like the headmaster stole it from him originally. B-But I am going to need help with this, and have asked if I could possible tell two people, with you guys in mind, he said that I could as long as I knew they were loyal, and that if you guys would swear a vow; either to never speak of the things that were said here and now, and go on with your life, or to help me out through. I-I don’t care which you choose, just know that you two are my closes friends here.” Harry mumbled, a blush making a way up his face, casting his eyes downward.
The man was worried about the young boy, he had tried everything he could possibly think of, and yet three days after taking responsibility of the young one he still has not woken up. Here he was pacing in front of his fire place thinking of what to do, to ensure the safety of the boy. Of course the headmaster said that he had no idea of the goings inside that house, but he also seemed upset that the potions master had removed the small child from his relatives. The man took a heavy seat in the chair just before the fire, a glass of brandy sitting beside him that he had been nursing for most of the night. He had his head in his hands when the fire before him turned an emerald green and a blonde male took a step into the parlor.
“So full alpha so very full.” Harry said mumbling praise to his strong alpha. Draco happy with that let his omega fall asleep as he ran his hand over Harry very distend stomach hoping Lady magic will grace them with strong healthy pups.
Harry woke up in a fright, he was found himself back in the Malfoy Manor and the last thing that he remembered was that he, Severus, and Lucius were at Gringotts filling out papers and then he received some unsettling news. He vaguely remembered Severus pouring a calming draught down his throat after his magic lashed out, Harry’s cheeks grew warm at the thought. Throwing a fit like that when he was eleven was very unbecoming, and all of places it had to be Gringotts, he was for sure that he would be welcome there anytime soon. He had destroyed the private meeting area, and had not even apologize for it either. Harry felt guilty about it, but it really wasn’t his fault. It was the Headmaster’s fault, for stealing from him, and for placing him those muggles. Harry felt his magic acting out again in rage at the thoughts of the lies that where giving to him.
It is now nearing Christmas break, and everyone seemed to forget the Halloween incident. Everyone was excited about leaving the school to go spend time with their families, especially the first years who aren’t used to staying away from their families for long periods of time. The students were talking about what they hoped to receive and what they thought their parents would love to get from them. Draco, of course, was excited. Yule was a yearly tradition dating way back; it is a Pagan holiday that most have forgot as the time has moved forward, but for a few Pure Blood families it is much a tradition when it was first taught. He would get to spend time with everyone since they would throw a huge new year’s ball as well, so it wasn’t too long before he would see his friends again. He had also just received a letter saying that his Uncle Sev and Harry would join them at the manor for Yule traditions, or as most muggleborn known as Christmas. This, to Draco, would be the best Christmas ever, and Yule as well, since he got to teach Harry of the old holiday.
I made my way to the living room to see everyone gathered in there with a worried expression same as mine, as we waited on news about Harry.
Harry sat there in silence, absorbing everything that they told him.  How could the so called “leader of light” do something as place those types of spells on a child? What of “Tom”? Was he really trust worthy, he knew he could trust Sev, but the Dark Lord?
Harry leaned back resting his head on the couch, his legs stretched out underneath the coffee table. Draco was smiling happily, leaning back into the couch cushion, closing his eyes happy that he no longer had to worry about the assignments and due dates. Severus noticed that the boys where done set aside his book.
The door that lead from the hallway to the private chambers swung open, and in stepped the Potions master. He was unsurprised to see the young dark haired wizard sitting upon his couch, but surprised to see his godson sitting right next to him. The young blonde wizard was studying the younger wizard as he spoke softly to the snake, something Severus had become use to in the week Harry and Levi had stayed with him, but Draco seemed to puzzled over the Parseltongue. Severus quickly cleared his throat as not to startle the young wizards with his presence, but sadly Harry still jumped when the sudden noise drew him from the conversation. He had begun working with the boy to reverse the damage that had been done by his muggle relatives, but the work had been slow going. The physiological damage had been done to a very deep extent, that Severus sometimes worry that Harry would never truly be able to live a care free life. There were rare moments when instead of seeing a broken young boy, he would see a curious child creeping out from the depths, that gave him hope that he did not come too late to save the boy. He was still mad that Albus would leave a child in such a home, but the headmaster didn’t care, he had left Severus with his parents as well when he went for help and didn’t even try to do anything for him. Severus was still a little upset with older wizard for what he has done to meddle in everyone’s lives, but there was nothing he could do to change it but help the kids the best he knew how.
Draco turned to give him an appalled look. “If you think I am going there reeking of sex and sticky with come, you are sorely mistaken.” Draco seemed satisfied with the temperature and stepped into the shower, his pale hair darkening as it dipped into the water.
The surfer didn’t last long, shooting his load after a few minutes of vigorous thrusts and a steady stream of babble that was peppered with more “mates” and “dudes.” Draco stared witheringly at him as the man held up his hand for a high-five after depositing his trophy in the bowl, the awkward gesture stretching on for long moments until he finally caught onto the fact that Draco had no intentions of returning the gesture and he sloped off with a muttered, “Chill out, dude.”
Slughorn looked up to watch as Seamus poured directly from his bottle of Lethe River Water into his cauldron, not bothering to measure it. “No, no, Mr Finnigan. You must measure out two drops exactly!” Slughorn cried, rushing over to the other table and entirely distracted from Harry and Draco.
“I’ll be fine. I’m going to grab one more pint and then I’m heading home,” Harry assured her. “You two get out of here.”
“Maybe, just as long as it doesn’t have kale in it?” At Draco’s inquisitive eyebrow, Harry added, “I can’t stand the stuff.”
Harry let out a choked sob and, on command, he came, his ejaculate spraying out between the tight fist of Draco’s hand and onto the floor, where Draco aimed it. He stroked Harry through it, offering soft thrusts of his cock to milk every last drop from Harry’s full testicles.
“At least if she misses with this spell, the worst you have to worry about is not having to wash your bits for a few days,” Ron joked.
“Sorry ladies! I need my friend back,” Ron consoled the bridal party, who gave Harry and Ron exaggerated looks of disappointment as the two men made their way back down the bar. Harry was disappointed to see that there was no sign of the mysterious man he’d been pulled away from earlier. “I thought maybe you went to the loo, but I definitely didn’t expect to see you using a woman’s belly button as a shot glass.”
Harry shifted forward carefully, not letting any of the shiny condom wrappers slide off from where they were resting on his lower back for easy access, and they kissed gently. Their lips brushed together, but Draco didn’t push for more—this kiss was an affirmation, not a claiming; they both knew they belonged to each other.
Harry looked around at the stony faces in the room, their expressions giving away nothing about how his presentation was going over. He smiled inwardly, knowing this next part would be the hook that landed them this account.
Harry snorted. “If you had that power, you definitely wouldn’t have to be working here, and then where would I be?”
His fourth had followed not long after as Harry had reclaimed that sweet hole and had fucked him hard, pulling the other man’s hips back against him again and again, not relenting until he had felt the tell-tale stiffening of the man’s body and the unbearably tight squeeze of his arse.
Harry swallowed nervously, trying to shake off the creeping sense of dread that those cold, shark eyes staring unblinkingly instilled in him. Whether she sensed his discomfort, or just couldn’t handle the pregnant pause, Hermione leaned forward beside him and flipped open the brown leather folder in front of her on the table.
“Now, the person that has been in charge of Heir Potter’s account has made some frightful changes, 500 Galleons per year to a Hogwarts scholarship program, another 1,000 Galleons twice a year to something called the Order of the Phoenix, and lastly a monthly withdrawal of 1,000 Galleons to go to a family called the Dursley’s.” All air felt like it stopped in Harry’s lungs when the goblin said that. They were being paid to take care of them, and they said nothing about that and treated him that way?
As soon as the goblin had left the room, Lucius quickly spoke before they were interrupted, “Harry why did you bow to the goblin race?”
Seeing how uncomfortable the boy was, Narcissa smiled at the young wizard. “Welcome Severus, Harry, to our home.” Narcissa voice echoed off the tile. “Harry I would like to introduce to my son, Draco.”
“Morning,” I replied fighting back a yawn, as I slowly sat up in our bed. Draco walked around to the bed leaving the room once again to get dressed. I slowly pushed myself out our bed but have difficulties now that I was in my final month. I couldn’t wait till I held my little one in my arms, and see their face. Draco came to my rescue just then helping me escape the confinements of our bed.
The rest of the class went by in ease, some students still struggling with the spell while others exceled and didn’t have to practice it for homework.
The older wizard cleared his voice giving his knuckles a rap on the open wooden door, so that he could make it known that the boy was no longer alone in the room. The pen scratching against paper came to a stop as green eyes jerked away from the page to look up at the healers face as he entered the room,
He was murmuring reassurances to the child; he summoned a Calming Drought, and coaxed it down the boy’s throat. They sat there for what seemed like hours to Severus, before Harry was breathing regularly and the panic was gone. Harry still sat in his lap, his ear still pressed on Severus’s chest, listening to the strong steady heartbeat. Harry’s eyelids were growing heavy with exhaustion, growing closer together with each passing minute. His body felt like lead and sluggish from both the potion and the panic attack.
Severus finished his drink to drown out his thoughts to get a peaceful night sleep. He didn’t want to ponder those dark thoughts to obscure his judgement. The boy that was in this house was a spawn of James Potter, and as the saying goes, like father like son. There was no way that boy was anything like him or like his Lily. With his night time drink done, Severus retired to his chambers for the night.
Hello lovelies and Welcome to chapter 6, sadly this might not be the chapter you are looking for, it is not the trip to Diagon Alley. Nope this is a sneak peak into the past since Harry still doesn't know anything; next chapter will be shopping with everyone :) Thanks again to my awesome Beta for reading through the chapter! And thank you for over 100 kudos!! I am really happy that you are loving the story!! Thank you everyone :)
Severus knew this was a lot harder for him to take in, he feared for both his own safety and now the safety of his son. All he wanted was the truth of what happened that night. Everything he was told could be a lie. He was caught between his master, the one he served faithfully until he was going to target the women he loved, and the old geezer who saved him from everything, but asked too much in return. He had to put his faith in one of these two men, and with that it wasn’t even a promise that Harry would be safe in the end. That was his concern, he didn’t care about his own safety that much, but whatever side had the greatest power to protect Harry was all that mattered. Severus sighed, his mind running in circles already, for he had no proof, he only had to go with what his mind and heart believed to be the best. That, and whatever choice that Harry had as well, since this was also going to be affecting him in the long run, as well.
“Good morning sleepy head,” he said as he came round to my side of the bed giving me a quick morning kiss on my lips. I sighed happily at the contact of my mate, just knowing that he was there.
“But freaks like these shouldn’t be allowed to have a table here!” Vernon yelled at the owner who had the nerve to step in.
Yes, this is what Harry needed, a support system throughout his schooling at Hogwarts, and he could not have asked for a better group of friends than what he already had. Of course, he couldn’t forget about the four loins, but right now he needed his calm snakes, before he told his loins of anything, especially those twins.
“You’re fine Harry, I’ve got you, I’m sorry little one,” The voice said as he released his grip, whatever the man gave him helped with the pain instantaneously, making the deep, aching pain in his body disappear. Harry felt a hand settle on top of his head, he tensed thinking that a blow was to follow, fingers slowly threading through my hair. He slowly relaxed, his body and brain catching up on thoughts swirling around in his head. Harry slowly opened my eyes, the light that was blinding when he first opened them, but nowhere as bright as when the fingers where taken away from my head. Harry let out a small whimper, missing the comfort of touch; he heard a chuckle and turned to face a blur of the man that was taking care of him. He saw the hand coming closer to his face, and then cold metal was placed on his nose and everything started to come into focus. There sitting in the chair beside him was a man with brown hair, his skin was pale as if he never seen the sun, and his eyes where pools of crimson. Harry’s eyebrows furrowed together, he never met this man in his life, and this was not someone he knew.
“Yes Harry, we are here for you when you are in need.” Tom answered, knowing if he didn’t Harry would let his thoughts think that he was angry at the young wizard. When in reality he was concerned for his well-being. It seemed that every few days Harry’s dreams would turn into nightmares, leaving the boy in such terror he would shut himself in his room the next day; refusing anything and anyone. At first the older wizards where unsure of what was going on, as it seemed that the boys magic would create a silencing spell around his room from habit of living with his muggle relatives.
“And does young Mr. Potter have his key,” The goblin snarled, leaning forward to peek at the terrified young wizard.
“Harry are you in here?” Harry heard Severus open the door and call into the room. Harry couldn’t hold it back any longer, he placed the kitten on the floor and crawled out from his hiding place, and as soon as he could, he threw himself in the potion master’s arms. He bawled into those black robes, getting tears and snot everywhere his face touched; but the older wizard didn’t seemed to mind one bit wrapping his large arms around the tiny, shaking body holding him close as possible, letting him get everything out of his system.
For the voting I have now closed the voting I know who and what Nev's mate is! So thank you for posting what you want to see, as well as some very lovely descriptions. I will give hints here and there, and hopefully in a chapter or two you guys will met him :)
Okay this is  going to be a very long long note; so sorry about that you can skip it if you want (Just read the warnings located at the end of this note), it's an apology of how long this has been as well information of why the wait, as well as an update all in one so yeah.....
She stood there for a moment frozen then a bright smile spread across her face, “Yes! I would love to!” a few tears had gathered in her eyes as she stared at us, “This means so much to me.”
Hello lovelies! I hope that you all are doing good! :D I am going to try to start updating once again every Friday, if possible, sometimes I will not be able to or I just have really bad writers block. With that this chapter has not been beta, I sent it late to them, but I really want to update on Fridays so I will edit it later when I get it from them and post it then, so sorry for all my mistakes that are found in here.
“I-I do not have a wrapped Christmas gift to give to you, i-it is something that I would like to share with you, before anyone else.” The boy said, looking between him and the floor. The man raised an eyebrow at the child, encouraging for him to continue on. “If we could, I would like us to head somewhere private for a while, maybe enjoy some snacks and hot cocoa.” Harry said with a glance to the Malfoy family, as if he was worried that they would be offended by what was happening.
I gulped but could not take my eyes from the door, I was transfixed. “W-Will Draco be allowed to go in?” I asked. I knew the answer but I had to ask, I would have loved for him to go in with me, but since he is not of blood or magic, he couldn’t.
Two hands were thrusted into Harry’s view, Harry accepted them and was lifted to his feet when he turned around to thank them, he thought he was seeing double. There were two red heads that looked exactly the same smiling down at the young boy.
Harry just shook his head, he had no idea why Severus was giving the boy so many chances, it’s clear the boy hadn’t opened his potions book up yet.
“Hello Leviathan, is it okay it I just shorten it to Levi? My name is Harry.” The boy said looking at the snake in great interest now.
“Harry, you do not have to pay me back for any of this, the eyesight potion is easy to make, as well as the nutrition potion which many kids take. The nurse would likely give you the same one, but I would prefer that you take mine instead.” He removed a vile from his sleeve and showed it to Harry. “This is the eyesight restoring potion, you take it once and it will help your eye. You might feel some discomfort in your eye, maybe a little stinging. It should last no longer than one hour.” Snape said as he studied the boy.
We had been sitting there for a few hours listening her tell about her trip to South America, and even a few trips to the Caribbean Islands in search of some of these rare magical creatures, some of them hard to believe, but knowing Luna they really happened.
Harry had silent tears running down his face, Levi was hissing at his hatchling encouraging him to tell his Papa, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t bear to see their disappointed faces at the adoption of a freak.
I jerked my head up in shock. We’ve already been here half the day?! It seemed Mr. Malfoy was stunned at how much time had gone by as I saw a flicker of surprise pass his mask.
“YOU FREAK!” He yelled slamming down his utensils in disgust, as if the mere presence of Harry was revolting. “What are you doing here?! This place is for normal people like us!” At this point the man had gotten out of his seat, and was making his way over to the table the wizards and witch sat at. At this point the Malfoy’s had seen their Harrys reaction, and how the fat muggle reacted to piece things together.
Another note: I am thinking of other stories that I can do for you guys, but I would like some help. :) I am looking for a co-author to help me out. It would the first piece I would ever write with another person, but I would really love to give it a chance! So if you want to give me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com :)
“Well look who found his way out.” A voice said from the doorway. Harry was too tired for him right now.
Right before the start of the next term, Harry once again found himself in front of the Dark Lord, this time sharing a spot of tea. He was brought here right after receiving an owl requesting him here, Sev was unhappy with it, but after a promise from Levi, Harry could go. Both Levi and Neit went with him, Levi, so that he could hear what this new stranger wanted from his boy, and Neit, well you cannot leave her out of an adventure.
When the pain passed I released my death hold on Draco’s hand and taking a shaky breathe to finish the sentence I started, “I-I think the baby’s coming.” I said, that was all it took to get my message to Draco before he was rushing for the floo. He contacted our Healer along with Hermione and Ron and Luna and Neville. When he made it back to my side I saw people stepping through, just in time as I felt a trickle of fluid warm my pants. I looked up in horror and shock, “m-my water broke.” I whispered to Draco before everyone was rushing around me, taking me back the bed we set up in the guest bedroom.
“Thank you my Lord, you are very generous to us.” Severus said before standing and bowing, he took Harry’s hand and they escaped the room. Thoughts swirling around them and they were left unsure about what the future holds for anyone.
Gemma shook her head, “I’m sorry Harry I was just in shock at seeing such a large snake,” Gemma turned her gaze to the said large snake, “Levi huh?” The snake nodded its head, which made Gemma’s jaw drop, “H-He can understand me?!” Gemma’s voice squeaked, almost above the whisper.
“Gods and goddess I am your vessel, please bring a blessing upon me and my family for the next year. Allow us to prosper and live, allow our magic to grow and love.” He repeated with confidence. It was as if something was guiding him and his body, he brought the knife to his palm, slicing a burning gash and allowing the blood to drip down into the fire. It had done exactly what the others done, but instead of a silver wisps it was gold, as soon as it touched his hand, he felt the magic gather into his body, feeling love and protection, and the feeling of power as well. It was something that he had always needed in his life, it was as if the gods knew this and they had gifted it to him, their protection from the world, but also love that was brought to him in the form of Severus and the Malfoy’s.
Now Severus looked at him with wide eyes, “It really is a good thing, it means he trusts you and that his mind is willing to heal from the past abuse. But there will be some behavioral changes with these new memories… I’ve gotten permission from Harry to share with you what memories have surfaced.” Alec looked gravely at the two older wizards before him, “first I need to make sure you keep your cool and understand that your actions will have consequences. Please think before you act on anything, we will deal with everything that is coming to light as legally as possible. So we can take care of both those Muggles and that Headmaster that took him there.”
“Alright Firs’ years follow me!” The giant said, leading them up to the castle, some first years gasping at the haunting sight. Straight to the entrance of the castle, its huge wooded oak door were a sight in themselves, holding centuries of secrets waiting to be revealed. They opened to reveal a tall black-haired witch with emerald eyes that almost matched Harry’s own. Harry smiled at the familiar witch he meet a few weeks ago at Severus’s house, and watching how the other first year withered underneath her scrutinizing gaze as she passed over each and every one of them.
As always I do hope that you enjoyed the chapter :) leave comments and kudos below so I know what you thought about my story thus far. If you are too shy email me at demondog136@yahoo.com
“I guess you can, Draco, Harry, since you had to get us up at the crack of dawn.” Lucius said, chuckling at his son’s impatience. A cheer erupted from Draco before he dove in the presents head first, ripping away the wrappings. Harry just smiled while he carefully unwrapped his, wanting to savor every moment, remember every detail of his first Christmas; the way Draco squealed at each new present, the way the paper felt in his hands, the way it sounded as it tore away to reveal what was hidden, the way the air around them smelt of coffee and pine, the way he felt that he could fit in somewhere. Yes, he wanted to remember everything, he wanted to remember down to the last detail so that can always cherish these moments, so that when someone asked what a family was, he could tell them with great accuracy.
“Happy new year Draco.” Harry whispered back before the shared another searing kiss… Maybe the year did end on a high note.
“P-P-Potter!” Quirrell stuttered out, noticing the fleeing boy. “I-I-I thought t-t-that you went h-home.” Harry silently thought of running from the Professor so that he wouldn’t have to talk to him, but forced himself to smile before turning around.
Harry gave the man a small smile in thanks of starting easy, “Ummm, b-blue, it’s calming.” Alec gave Harry a smile of encouragement, “M-my turn… What house where you in at Hogwarts?”
“I think she heard you,” one of the other Gryffindors said to Ron, who just smirked at the retreating figure of the young girl.
The elder Malfoy was astonished. “What do you mean he says?! It’s not like you can talk to the thing.”
“I-I’m sorry,” Harry’s voice cracked from how raw his throat was from a combination of the nightmares and from the panic attack he just had. Healer Alec was about to speak to him, most likely to tell him he had nothing to be sorry for, but Harry beat him to speaking, “I-I-I just can’t speak about these nightmares…. I-I-I just can’t” The boy slowly slid from the healer’s lap, “I-I,” Harry paused taking a few deep breaths trying to get his stutter back under control, but his breaths came shakily. “I-I am going to give you the journal to read, so you can understand… P-Please don’t use whatever you find against me.” Tears gathered in his eyes scared that once this secret was out that he would be dropped off the face of the earth; that once they found out he was dirty, they would no longer care about him. So he retrieved the small journal opening to where the nightmare started, “from here on is where the dream started and has gotten worse.”
Once again this is un-beta, I will post the beta version once I do get, so I do apologize for all the mistakes that can be found in this chapter. I'm hoping to hear from them soon, and then for me to remember to post the corrected version instead of taking a few weeks to do so ^^
The Goblin spoke in the riddle-like tone that most creatures seemed to get around me. I bowed my head, not wanting to be such a great wizard. I just wanted to be Harry.
Draco careful not to fall on top of the over stimulated omega hooked his arm around the waist of the omega and rolled away from the mess the omega created when he came and drew him close to his chest for cuddled causing his cock to go deeper into his omega and release more into him. The omega gave a strangled moan at the movement and just how deep his alpha was in him. But he was sated and full and gave a happy purr each time another load was unleashed deep into his womb. Yes he will give his alpha pups this time! He will be a good omega, his hand drifted to his belly where there was a slight bulge from the amount of cum was in him already, he was very full. Harry gave a quick wiggle, but his alpha growl made him stop.
Severus took a calming breath, “It is fine Harry,” Severus came to stop right in front of the young boy, “We are not running late as of yet, so if you please take a step into the floo.”
I didn’t even take a second to recover from the almost fall before I wrapped my brother up into a hug, squeezing the life out of him, “Nev! I’ve missed you so much!” I cried as I just held on to my rock and my support system. Nev took everything in stride and laughed while hugging me closer. I closed my eyes and enjoyed being close to my brother once more.
It was an unexpected heat that caught Draco and Harry off guard they were at home, they were having a great time laughing as Harry attempted to make some Holiday themed cookies and Draco was trying to put tensile around the tree. Even though it was still Early November they needed the small joy of looking upon the tree, plus magic kept the tree around longer than normal. As Harry mixed the battered Harry looked up and laugh to see all the glitter that ended up in Draco’s hair as well as how tangled up he ended up in said tensile.
“This one will move us forward.” Harry said, holding up a smallest vile, and then picking up a rounder bottle. “This one will let you back through to the chest set.”
“I would love too! Your cooking is always the best!” She said smiling at me, I pushed myself off the chair having a little difficulty, and waddled my way to the kitchen. Even though I would never admit that I waddle out loud.
“D-Draco…” I called knowing that he had left the room for something, another pain ripped through my body knocking the breath from me, “Draco!” I screamed now try to breathe through the pain like the healer said when labor started, how come I didn’t realize this sooner?
“Since we are here, I thought that we could go ahead and look into the vault of Merlin and Morgana. I wonder what that vault holds.”
“YOU! What are You doing here!” His Aunt shrieked at whoever was at the door; Harry slowly felt the edges of his world blurring before he felt a slimy presence enter his mind once again.
Harry just nodded looking back down to the ground. Severus sighed, knowing that he wouldn’t get the boy to talk about last night at the moment. “Alright Harry, after dinner tonight I would like if you would come down to my rooms so that we can talk about it.” Harry just nodded once again, not really saying anything. Severus dismissed both boys after getting Harry to eat some breakfast and his potion. Severus was deeply concerned for him, and decided that it was time to write his friend about action that needed to be made.
“It’s such a nice place,” Harry’s voice was above a whisper unsure what he should say since he never talked to someone his own age. Dudley always made sure that while at school that Harry was always isolated, even the teachers seemed not to notice him that much.
“Sorry Lee, but we must get this Kitten to his proper owner, but do you think that we can barrow this guy for a bit?” Fred ask Lee.
While he did this, his Papa and Tom ordered a light snack from the elves. along with hot drinks; tea for them and hot coco for the raven-haired boy. As soon as Harry was through they gathered him up and sat with him, much like the first time they found out, talking with the young wizard and wished him better dreams when they saw him drift off once more. Knowing no more dreams would come, since Severus took it upon himself to spike his coco with a small amount of Dreamless sleep potion.
“Good afternoon, Master Griphook, may your enemies blood coat your blades and their bodies fall at your feet,” I greeted the young goblin with a bow. Draco better be proud, his teaching is being put to use.
“Is he truly dead?” Harry didn’t know why, but he felt like he had to ask that question, he wanted to know if this man that had killed his parents was truly dead. He really didn’t want Severus upset with him because he asked too many questions, but he felt like this might be the only time that someone would be willing to tell him the truth.
As always I do hope you like the chapter, please leave kudos and comments what you thought about it. If you are too shy email me at demondog136@yahoo.com :) till next time!!
Draco’s face paled, but he nodded. Of course, he would never try to hurt Harry, that was what he was there for, as a good friend, there to protect him and make sure he stayed out of trouble. That is all he felt for Harry was friendship… Right? He was just in first year, too young to worry about anything like what the twins were insinuating! So Draco just brushed those feelings off as brotherly feelings, one that would feel like he had to protect his younger brother; especially since he was family now, thanks to Uncle Sev adopting him. The twins just smiled, of course the young heir Malfoy could not think that way just yet; he was just a child.
The Dark Lord said after some thought, knowing that the child will unable to do the action alone, and it might be possible for him to have help.
“Thank you Heir Potter, you may raise you head, we will forgive your group and will offer our services still to you.” The Head Goblin said, taking control of the situation seeing as the lesser goblin had no idea of what to say in such an action, “please allow Ironfist to lead you to the private rooms and we will have someone there shortly.” Harry raised his head to face the Goblin, giving him a smile and nodding his head in thanks, before following Ironfist to the private room that was provided to them.
“We missed you too, Kitten,” the twins said together, giving the raven haired boy a hug and smiling at him.
He made it to the Room of Requirements and asked for a room, it was a shock to see a room decorated in festive colours. Garlands and tinsel strewn across the room, a beautiful red and gold decorated tree and a couch settled in front of a cracking fire. It almost made one forget how lonely one was. Harry shook his head. If the room thought he needed it, then he would enjoy it while he could before someone came looking for him.
“Come on Vernon, they are not worth this!” Petunia begged, tugging Vernon towards the door. “We will find a better place than this, one that doesn’t allow freaks like them.” With the last tug they were out the door, leaving in their wake a mess.
Severus just smirked as Harry’s face turned a shade of red, “Alright you two, get your homework done and I will make everyone some tea to pass the time.” Severus said before exiting to head to the small kitchen and leaving the boys right in front of the blazing fire, opening their books and taking out some parchment.
Harry turned to Pansy, “Hey Pans, have you seen ‘Mione?” Harry asked knowing that the fellow first year hears and sees everything in the school, even when there seems to be no one nearby. Pansy, who was considered to be the eyes and ears of the school, turned to and look at Harry. Harry and Pansy where friends of sorts, helping each other when possible, of course being in the same house had a lot of do with it.
Once again, I met the goblins harsh stare flinching back into myself, “I-I’ve never received something like that either, sir. This is only my second time to be in your bank since my first year at Hogwarts.”
Severus couldn’t help the small smile that came upon his face at the youth. “Alright then, I will send for someone to open the door for your friend.”
Also thank you too all of you guys! over 600 kudos as well as over 14,000 you guys are awesome! Thank you very much!
“You will have to wear your lordship rings all the time to prove that you are the Lord Potter-Black. As for you heir rings, no you can just put them back in the vaults as soon as they accept you,
Harry stood right behind Draco, excitement thrumming through his body, his eyes taking in as much as he could when the doors open to reveal the Great Hall. Harry could never imagine a place like this, it was such a grand place to be, that he almost never wanted to leave. The doors revealed a hall with four large tables filled with excited students looking at the first years with great interest, mumbles about what student belonged to what house. Harry looked up and saw candles floating on the ceiling as well as the night sky above, a gasp escaped is lips at the sight.
“Yes sir, don’t worry,” Harry replied before leaving the Malfoy family to make his way to Severus’s room.
I quickly made it through the Gryffindor ring without much of a wet feeling and almost instant glow and warming of the ring. The Morgan Le Fay Heir ring was a little different, I felt my power being drained into the ring. At first, I thought it was denying me the heirship, as my magic was sucked up into the black stone, but after a moment, it warmed to the touch and my magic rushed back into my body, with the glow that indicated it was through.
Next was the man, he was tall and thin, with a thick head of black hair that seem to have a mind of its own, much like Harry’s before he took the blood adoption potion. He also had glasses on that seemed to match Harry’s. He knew that the figures that stood before him was his mum and dad, his real parents. Why where they here?! His whole-body trembled as he tried to fight back tears. He could stay there forever, but at the same time, he couldn’t. “I-I-I’m sorry,” was all he said before he rushed out the door, grabbing the cloak and going back to his rooms.
“Good morning, Severus, Harry,” The professor greeted, he dropped the stutter as soon as the wards were in place, giving the two a chilled smile, “Let’s get right down to business shall we?”
Draco steadies himself and slowly begins to untangle Slytherin’s magic. The problem is that Slytherin’s magic, especially in common areas like the Great Hall, is an integral part of the structure. However, the benefits outweigh the cost. A tear is much harder to mend than a clean cut. Draco slowly pulls Slytherin’s magic out and balances it with spells that will hold Hogwarts—for now.
When Negesydd returned, she found Harry lying on a bean bag in one of the rooms, staring up at the twinkling charmed constellations on the dark ceiling. He was trying to get inspiration, but he didn’t get any inspiration, because rather than thinking up lovely stories, his brain was conjuring up all the things Malfoy could be doing right now.
Later that morning, the Slytherin students and the Hufflepuff students in particular gather by the castle.
Twas the night before Christmas Eve. Tomorrow and all the way til New Year, Harry and Draco would be busy visiting respective family and friends. It was their last chance for quiet and privacy.
Meanwhile, Creevey has tagged along at the end of the group, trying sweet-eyes at Harry. “Please, Harry. Come back to Gryffindor.”
: Ummm because your magic is unstable, don't want to cast magic on you (never mind that the bond is magic, that Hogwarts is magic...*cough cough*)
Somehow, this destruction of Hogwarts feels different compared to the damage sustained during the Battle nearly a year ago.
His tone is so yearning that Draco can’t help but agree. Communicating to humans is not conducive in dragon form, so Draco focuses his magic on Nolan and directly levitates him onto his back. After a moment of thought, he levitates Harry on too.
Green stumbles out of the Forest. Relief is clear on her face, followed by suspicion as she looks around, unable to see Draco.
He meets Madame Pomfrey at the door of the Hospital Wing on the way out and together they go down to meet the students at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
Andromeda comes by with little baby Teddy, and they redo the main sitting room with comfy sofas and plush carpet for a baby to crawl on. When Malfoy comes, he makes a face at everything and gasps in shock when he sees Harry’s bedroom. “
“Hmm.” Malfoy’s hum is dubious, but he accompanies Harry inside Gringotts anyway. Malfoy shoos away the guards, and they take one of the carts down.
In fact, everyone is thinking of how to make black floating censor bars that will automatically appear every time the two of them french kiss in public...
“I expect you to work together while the rest of us are gone. There will be some Slytherins with study periods around, too. I will
“I don’t transform with the moon. It is, in practice, closer to an animagus form than a were-creature form,” Draco says.
By the time Draco transforms back, he’s exhausted having played with all the energetic children, both human and thestral. The only upside is that all the magic that the Slytherins gave him has now fully unified with his own partially recovered magic.
Nolan is sad he doesn’t get to sit next to Mr Malfoy, but at least Potter isn’t either! He sits up straight as Minister Shacklebolt walks over and stands behind the podium. Quiet descends.
them,” Harry protested weakly. “What they got was...fair, given that we would never be able to prosecute them under Muggle law.”
to help Harry adjust to Slytherin,” Blaise says. “I’m sure Hogwarts and the elves have already placed a new bed in the bedroom and moved Harry’s items.”
“You’ve been a great House,” he says, “And you’ve been so welcoming. So this is just a small token of my appreciation…”
“Didn’t you see Harry Potter standing next to Malfoy?” Taylor jeers at some Harry Potter supporters. “He’s clearly in on it! Wake up! He’s not a Gryffindor anymore! He’s been clearly hiding a slimy snake inside...no one with
Inside are the cracks snaking across the floor. Inside is the missing Slytherin Hourglass. Inside are the new supports and floor, and waters being suppressed below.
Meanwhile, in front of Slytherin House, a pulse of magic from Hogwarts jolts Draco from his shock. “You mean...”
Official #1 opens his big mouth, “Unfortunately, Slytherin cannot rejoin. Headmistress, please return our wands post haste, we officials are very busy.”
Draco obligingly did so, making it easier for Harry to reach Draco’s mouth. When Draco pulled off his glasses, Harry
Instead, McGonagall pulls in the sixth, seventh and eighth year students to help...while she locates and reinstalls the heartstone of Hogwarts where it belongs.
“Hermione’s wondering why you’re at Gringotts so often,” Ron says, dangling a newspaper in front of Harry.
reckless and that I go running off in the night too often, but you did it too!” Harry says. “Why didn’t you wake me?”
“You were a minor,” Granger says coldly. “Of course I would allow Harry to testify for you. Anything less would be obstruction of justice.”
Or rather, if Draco were standing by Harry’s side, he would find it hard to resist slipping a hand through Harry’s robes in public. Just a little slit, just a little
Three variations of a protective ward potion bubble in the miniature cauldrons on Draco’s workspace. Their bubbling calms down, and it’s now the perfect time for the next step.
Draco makes an annoyed sound in his throat. “Our Samhain will still proceed,” he tells the Slytherins, now congregating around him. He outlines the slight modifications with the Halloween event—just because it goes for long doesn’t mean they have to attend for the entire duration. In fact, the other houses would
“Sir,” Auror Inkwood says, “Narcissa Malfoy has requested to report several criminal charges against the members of Aegis.”
. If we cannot trust the Sorting Hat, an ancient artifact belonging to the Founders, then House delimitations become useless. Shall I call for the demolition of the Houses?”
In his current work office, Draco Malfoy held the two letters from Harry. His usual day had been interrupted by those quick green eyes. He thought that he had gotten over him.
One by one, Harry and Draco acquired the items on Harry’s list, and it was all put neatly away in Draco’s small bag with expandable wizarding space.
After Lucius strides away, Narcissa also has no appetite. Suddenly, Draco feels very, very far away.
“They will not Harry, this was not your fault of what your uncle did to you, there was no way of you stopping him. You are not a freak, you are just a young boy.” Alec explain to the young wizard, “they need to know so we can all help you understand that. So, will it be okay if I tell them, or will you be able to tell them?”
It was the next day, night to be exact, and tonight was Harry’s first time celebrating anything with a family; and this was the first time that the Malfoy’s would be celebrating with Harry. Everyone was very happy to show Harry how exactly Yule went, but at the same time, they were not going through the whole ritual seeing as this would involve so much more than the night had to offer. Instead it would be the traditional burning of the Yule log, the only difference from the muggles was that they added drops of blood to the fire, offering their magic to the gods of the season. It was after everyone ate that they made their way into one of the many study rooms but this one was set up so that the wizards can kneel in front of the fire place comfortably, to worship this magical holiday. An elf brought a log and placed into the fire place and left the wizards in peace.
Severus looked at the boy in shock, a snake? But Severus couldn’t tell this boy no without a good reason. “What do you mean a snake, Harry?”
Pansy eyes widened at what she just said. Meanwhile, Draco was already taking action, pushing his way to the head table as the other students pushed to get out of the hall.
“I know sweetie,” Harry’s aunt said to comfort her son, “How about this, we take him with us, and we will get you an extra gift as an apology?” His Aunt said to sooth her son, as she pulled the over grown boy into a hug.
Severus took Harry’s hand and bent down to whisper into his ear. “Harry, please don’t be scared, these people are friends of mine for a very long time. They will not hurt you, now come on and show yourself.” Severus said, giving the boy a little push on his back to encourage him.
After a minute of silence, Draco couldn’t help himself anymore. “So Harry, what is troubling you so much?” Gemma sent a glare at the blonde boy, before turning back to Harry who was giving Draco a small smile.
“Firs’- Years! Firs’- years over here!” Harry stared at the giant, he couldn’t help but smile at him; even though he didn’t talk to Hagrid that much when at Gringotts, he was a likeable person.
Also I will say this up here as well at the end note, I am looking for a co-writer, I have some big ideas I want to do, but sometimes I am unable to put words to paper. So I would love to work with someone! Well enough from me and on to the chapter!
Harry only nodded, not really wanting to anger his new friend, and quickly made his way over to the bathroom. He found that robes where confusing to put on when you don’t know how. Just before Harry could step out of the bathroom, Draco called out, “Come on what is the hold up?” Harry gulped before existing the bathroom, for the first time in his life was he wearing something that was his size. It felt nice, but at the same time it was new to Harry, who always had worn baggy looking clothes.
“I-I’m sorry sir, f-for worrying you so much.” Harry spoke first, feeling that is what he needed to say. Severus smiled at the younger wizard, happy that Harry was back to talking once again.
Luna smiled and sat down, “thank you Harry, as long as you tell me about the news that I seemed to have missed,” looking at me sternly.
Theo let out a soft chuckle, “Good morning Harry, I see that you are an early riser. The others can sleep all day for all I care, I have classes to attend.” Harry just smiled at Theo, before gathering his newly acquired robes and taking it to the bathroom to change. Harry was changed and ready for the day, and was surprised to see everyone was still asleep. Theo had already made his way to the common room, leaving the others to sleep. Harry smiled wickedly, and stepped out to the common area in search of someone.
“Now you go back to sleep, you have a long day ahead of you tomorrow, and you are still recovering.” Severus said getting out of the chair that he had been occupying and turned to leave the room. “Have a good nights rest and your snake should be in here shortly.” With that Severus turned and left the room. Harry nodded at the man as he retreated back into the hall, as he felt his eyelids grow even heavier with each passing second. The boy slipped into a deep sleep, with no nightmares that night, the first ever peaceful sleep the youth has ever known.
“These are so much bigger than the Malfoy’s vaults,” he said, awe seeping from his words as he admired the vaults. It would have been something at just the large doors alone, but the doors were decorated too with runes, other ancient script, and depictions of animals were guarding the door.
Harry was still trapped in his mind, in his past where his uncle was using his body. He couldn’t stop it he couldn’t do anything. He was frozen in fear, he knew deep down he was safe from the monster, saved by Severus never to endure such pain again, but he was trapped still in the memories. Pain echoed through his bones at the memory of the first time his uncle did such a thing to him; to Harry that was the worst he had ever received.
love kudos and comments on your thoughts about what you thought of the chapter, of what you want to see next stuff like that so leave those below as well ~Gives best puppy dog eyes possible~ please?
Harry found the note odd, and handed it over to his Father then proceeded to remove the wrappings. Inside was a cloak that felt much like water in his fingers and that had a silvery misty color to it. He looked at Severus which had his eyes narrowed at the object, but hasn’t said anything about it. Harry then wrapped the cloak around himself. A gasp from Severus made him look at himself, what he saw had him in shock. His body has seemed to disappear! Harry began spinning around, making himself look like a fool doing so.
“N-No why would I be jealous of you?” Draco asked, his face bright red now, cursing himself for being so see through.
Harry felt him numb cold body move, his fingers wrapping themselves into Severus cloak as he cried for the boy. As he cried for himself in the past, it was over, there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and he was going to fight everyone for it.
After many stops, Lucius and Severus decided it was time for them to take a leave, and head down to another ally way leaving the boys alone with Narcissa, who dragged the boys off to
“Yes sir, sorry sir.” Harry said his eyes down cast, Levi hissed something to the young wizard to convey a firm message to the boy. Draco’s lips twitched at the sight of the smaller wizard getting scolded by the large snake, happy that someone was there to tell Harry stuff when he wouldn’t listen to anyone else.
It was a few hours passed dusk Harry was still sitting in the backyard, which now has taken on a colder chill to it. His Uncle returned home hours ago, he had heard shouting back and forth between his Aunt and Uncle then everything went quiet. Harry was now fearing the worst, what was going to happen? Where they just going to leave him out forever much like a dog? A shiver took over Harry’s body as a chill wind swept through the night. The back door suddenly open and there stood his Uncle looking down on the small child, his face redder than it ever has been before, behind him was his Aunt looking just as mad as her husband as they looked down at the freak in their backyard. The one that has been living in their house for the past 11 years. In his uncle’s hand Harry saw the letter he tried so hard to hide; he began shaking out of fear of what was to come.
