“I already have a green scarf,” Harry reminded him. “And the Sorting Hat said I would have been a great Slytherin.”
“No. And I wanted to ask you something about it…” Harry bit his lip, and glanced at him. Draco guessed he felt guilty for asking him something about soulmates. He would feel worse if he knew who Draco’s soulmate was, he thought. “Is it normal to always dream about the same thing? I know Ron and Hermione dream about each other saying different things each time; sometimes it's a joke or something silly, and sometimes it’s something deeper. But for me, since the first time, it has been that song. Hermione promised to do some research, but she hasn’t found anything yet.”
“I hope you’re not coming back with another awful name like Chrysanthemum.”
The pub was full when they arrived, but luckily Pansy and Greg had reserved them some chairs.
She took a big sip from her cup, and Harry properly looked at her for the first time that night. As always, she had put an effort on looking dashing, but he could see the pain in her eyes. He realised that they had both lost the person they relied on the most: his husband, and her best friend.
“Okay.” Draco returned with two bottles of butterbeer and two coasters he placed on the table. “So, where do you want us to begin?”
“How was the trip?”
Draco
“I’m still here!” Sarah piped up. “Don’t talk about me as if I can’t hear you!”
“Get out of my house!” Harry screamed too. He hoped one of his Muggle neighbours would call the police.
I haven’t finished my drink when Parvati leaves, looking defeated. I smile.
“It’s the worst thing I have ever heard.” She took a sip from her teacup and looked at her watch. “I have to go to work in ten minutes, enough time to make you see reason.”
“I know,” I answered with a sad smile. “He’s always been such a caring man.”
So it isn’t a cow
Harry tried to explain, but his friend hushed him, and kept hugging him.
Harry had found the note on the big tray full of golden Swiss buns Dray had left on the kitchen counter. He picked one up and bit it. It was the most delicious thing he had ever eaten. He decided to skip his usual dinner at 8 a.m. and had a coffee with as many of Dray’s buns as he could.
Dear Harry,
Are you going to be a dramatic git now over one word?
“I think that’s a nice idea, Scorp. I write him notes too,” Harry confessed.
Harry: Merlin, Draco… I can't go on like this… I need you here with me. I'm going crazy without you.
Harry noticed how two soft pink marks appeared on Draco’s cheeks. Apparently he wasn’t the only one nervous about it.
“Who the fuck are you?”
“Okay, we’ll need five couldrons. I don’t think I can brew ten potions at the same time, but five is more manageable.” He waved his wand and five cauldrons appeared over the five potion stations placed in the different tables. “The potions we'll be brewing today are these ones." He showed Harry the instructions he had written the night before. "Help me put the ingredients beside each cauldron, please.”
Sarah sat on the bed and turned so he could look at her back and her left shoulder, where a scar had ripped the skin and turned it into a mess the Healers had barely healed before the girl lost too much blood.
Harry had to agree with him.
Harry: Did you know about this!?
Pansy turned around too, and contemplated the distant buildings, cars, and people with him. It all seemed to belong to another world, far away from the pain and the grieving.
Harry: I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I went with the Granger-Weasleys to a cottage in the south of England and forgot my phone at home. So then Hermione decided that it was a little holiday to forget about the real world, and turned her phone off too.
That name, he didn’t want to hear that name. He couldn’t even say it himself. It was too painful.
Harry: Goyle's going to be my partner now, although he takes half an hour to draw even the simplest things, but no way am I pairing up with Pansy! She's scary, and so is Blaise. And I wouldn't dare break the unstoppable force that's Hermione-Ginny.
I run inside and look frantically around. He has to be here still. His portkey time hasn’t passed yet. I look in the bars, in the lines before the check in desks, I even go to the toilets, but I can’t find him anywhere. I’m about to give up and go home, when I see a jacket just like Harry’s. The man is wearing jeans just like Harry’s too, but he can’t be Harry, because this man is holding hands with a beautiful Indian woman who laughs and kisses him, leaving a red mark of lipstick on his cheek. Parvati.
“We have to beat, Ginny, okay?”
Radwah hugged him while he cried and thought over and over about how stupid he was being.
“Oh! Are we allowed to criticise that bastard at last?” Greg asked, picking a biscuit from the dish Draco had served on the kitchen table.
Harry: He swears it's a lighthouse, but come on! A lighthouse, my arse!
“I have a date. I’m nervous. Shut up.”
He gave the piece of paper to Harry, and observed how Harry read the words moving the lips. Harry’s face seemed to light up with every word.
“And it wasn’t Ron either, right?”
On Draco’s cashmere blanket on the bed:
Draco turns around and stares at him. She's sure her eyes are wide open and she can't close her mouth in her surprise. Her father apologizing about something is a new occurrence, especially about misgendering her.
“You hate your job.”
“Oh, I don’t remember…” Narcissa answers after leaving her fork and knife delicately on the plate. “I think it was when I was six or seven and I got so angry at Bella, my oldest sister, because she hid my doll, that I had set her hair on fire.”
“Yes?” Harry’s smile faltered at seeing his expression. “What’s wrong?”
The car’s turn signal blinks. I look over and see a hotel. Expensive. Like the ones we used to go to. The car goes to the underground parking lot. I drive past it and go around the block. Once. Twice. Thrice. I don’t see them leaving.
. I hope it’s good.”
“Can you take this seriously?” Draco asked. Sometimes, he thought that strangling Pansy wouldn’t be so bad.
10 pm
“I meant your mum, Scorpius, I’m sorry,” Lucius finally says. “She was a boy before. I always forget she’s a woman now.”
“Is that a new sign they forgot to teach us in the BSL class in first year?” Blaise asked in a mocking tone.
“Potter doesn’t think that.” Pansy waved the note she was still holding. “Draco, we’re past our school years, we’re mature now. This isn’t going to devolve into a magic duel in the living room if you ever run into Potter now.”
Draco felt tears run down his cheeks, before a pair of arms hugged him and three voices whispered calming words in his ears.
4:23 am
“It’ll be fine, Ron! Stop worrying!” Harry said with a smile.
Harry laughed, and kissed him on the lips.
Draco had arrived home after a long day at work, and the last thing he needed was a bouquet sent by Michael. He looked at the note attached to the flowers. Michael said he loved him and wanted him to go back home. Draco cast a drying spell at the flowers and then vanished everything to the bin. Home was no longer Michael’s big flat. Home was his small shared flat with James.
“I don’t know. It just feels… weird that he wants to be with me after all the things I’ve done.” Draco took a sip of his glass and made a grimace. He didn’t like alcohol. He left the glass on the side table.
1:34 am
Harry: I'm sorry I didn't text you yesterday, but I had training, work, park with Cassie and Leo, and then game night.
“You’re lost without me. You can’t even choose a nice flat. You’re pretty useless when living on your own, Dee.”
“Pretty good. He’s very easy to live with, although I suspect he’s fattening me up with all the cakes he bakes.”
Michael greets me with a nod, and I nod back at him. He’s an idiot, but he’s smart enough to figure things out if we get suspicious. I see today’s copy of
“Seriously? This thing is an F?”
Pansy choked on her tea, and Greg had to pat her on the back until she recovered.
“He told me you were having problems…”
I look in every drawer, in every folder, and in between the pages of every book, but I don’t find anything. I do the same with Padma’s desk, and here, I have a little more luck: I find a spare key to her flat.
“Do you think you’re better here with him?” Michael glanced at Harry, and a second later his eyes widened in recognition. He burst out laughing. “You’re dating Harry Potter? Dee!” He laughed again.
“It's just a bed.”
He closed his eyes, and thought of when he was little, maybe six or seven years old, and his father bought him his first broom. He smiled. He opened his eyes, with the wand ready, and then dropped it when the door opened and a smiling Harry entered.
Harry: Hey, how are you?
“Pans, I think we’re going to hear a lot about Potter again,” Greg said. Then he took a bite of his pastry.
Harry: Yes, I already read it! I couldn’t put the book away.
Harry: I went back to work today and had a breakdown when Sally asked me how I felt.
“That’s what you liked? That I looked like Weasley? I have always known you three had something weird going on!”
His parents kissed him and hugged him before disappearing in the fireplace. This is lonely, he thought, alone in the drawing room and with his huge body anchoring him to the sofa. However, he didn’t have to wait too long until Harry came back and helped him go upstairs and into the deliciously hot and calming bath he had run for him.
“Idiot.” Harry dragged him to a nearby table by the hand he was still holding. They sat on it and kissed again.
“I can’t compete with that,” Harry says. “Are you ready to go now?”
And btw I’m in a meeting, I shouldn’t be texting you right now
“It’s tiny,” Pansy said, looking in distaste at the bed. “Are you sure you want to do this?”
Harry: They’re like pests.
“Because you love me when I talk.”
On the kitchen table, next to a dish with a piece of cake and scattered crumbs:
Harry looks at Draco over the stupidly rich dinner he made today. He’s been like this all week and it’s starting to get on Harry’s nerves. Besides, there are all the weird things Draco has been doing lately, like going to his work from time to time, telling him that everything is alright, and talking about Padma with a nervous expression whenever her disappearance is brought up in a conversation.
“Do you think I haven’t tried? I hate doing this, I hate sucking cocks for a living. I assure you this wasn’t my dream job when I was younger. But who do you think is going to hire me?” Draco’s angry now. Harry knows. He doesn’t shout and tries to hide it, but Harry knows him too well. He’s angry and hurt.
He could feel Martin’s avid eyes observing them from the other side of the room. Oddly enough, it made him feel safe. He knew Michael wouldn’t make a scene with someone else watching.
They stayed in the living room together sharing stories about Draco, and for one glorious night, it was almost as if he was still with them.
“He never screamed like this, nor hit anything…”
I'll be updating the fic these days. I have all written and betaed, but I have to fix some things yet. Besides, I've always wanted to post a fic chapter by chapter 😂 I'm a simple girl, with simple dreams.
“Fine,” she said, making a surrender gesture with her hands. “Do you like living here?”
It was past midnight when they left the shop. The potions needed a few days or weeks to be finished, but Draco would do that during the next weeks when he had time at work.
“Yeah,” Draco said, laughing. Harry noticed he liked his laugh; it was a sound he wasn’t used to hearing but he could get used to it easily. “I knew you were my flatmate, but now it’s like getting hit in the head with the idea.”
“Why are you always in such a bad mood?” Harry asked.
Michael laughed.
“I want you to come back home. I miss you, Dee.” There was no cold in his eyes anymore, but love. That love that had made Draco felt wrapped and cared for so many times before.
Draco
No, there’s nothing wrong.
“DRACO!” Michael screamed again, and this time Harry heard steps from behind. He turned and saw Draco coming slowly, very pale and with scared eyes. “Finally! Let’s go home! I’ve had enough of this nonsense!”
Harry: I love you.
“Oh… Who do you...?”
“Father, do something! They’re being rude to me.”
Harry: I miss your hugs.
Harry: Guess who the vet was?
“Then that’s their problem, if they can’t support their friend in his relationship.” Draco tried to say it calmly too, but it irked him a little imagining Weasley and Granger laughing at Harry because of him.
“Yes. Madam Pomfrey said it was a concussion, but that I’ll be able to leave next week.” Harry looked at Draco again, and opened his mouth as if to say something else, but must have changed his mind because he closed it again.
“I have a house.”
He went straight to the girl’s room, where he found her with her worried parents. She looked too pale, and she kept grimacing in pain.
He took a few minutes to relax and to think of what he’d say if Draco hadn't left for work. He had imagined many times how it would be if they met sometime, but this hadn’t been a situation he had thought of before.
“Nope. That’s something Weasley and Granger would use for their child. And we’re not done discussing Chrysanthemum.”
Harry: Oops, I’ll have to leave you now, because we have an Alcoholism session now! Love you!
Draco snorts at her husband’s words, and Scorpius lets out a small giggle. Scorpius is usually so quiet that hearing him laughing so much makes Draco’s heart float with happiness.
Harry picked up one of the expensive quills, and caressed his face with the feather. Draco would kill him if he saw him now. He tore a bit of parchment, and wrote:
9:26 pm
He knew he couldn’t sleep after the dream, so he dressed, and left the room quietly. He planned to go to the library for a few hours before the first class to look for more information about his dream, but Pansy was in the common room, and dragged him to the Great Hall to have breakfast.
“You’re always so serious, Lucius! Congratulate your granddaughter as you should! Hug her, for Merlin’s sake!”
“Harry? Malfoy?” It was Ron.
“You idiot!” he snapped at Martin. “You should learn manners! Screaming doesn’t make you right, don’t you know that?”
Draco’s mouth opened in surprise, and all his body reacted in some way: his heart skipped a beat, his stomach jumped, butterflies occupied his gut, and he could feel how his cheeks blushed.
Harry: On the games topic, however, Ron, Ginny, Blaise, and Goyle tried to explain to Hermione and me how to play some weird wizard game, but they’re rubbish at that so we told them to shut up. You’d have explained it better.
Then we had lunch together in his and Hermione’s house, and we played chess. He won, obviously, and was pretty smug about it until he had to change Rose’s diaper and one of his fingers touched the shit. I cried with laughter and now I’m not welcome in the Granger-Weasley house until I beg for forgiveness. Or so Ron says. You and I know that he can't live without me.
and not
“You’ve told me you’re gay, so I guessed it was a boy. Do I know him? Is it Blaise?” Harry asked, with too much interest in Draco’s opinion.
“What do you think? I thought that after all this time, it’d feel better, but it still hurts.”
“I didn’t know you knew how to dance. I was there during the Yule Ball, you know?” he signed, smirking.
“I could teach you.”
“When I was three or four I think,” Harry says. “I unlocked my bedroom door.”
“So he’s Potter again?” Pansy smirked at him. Draco glared. “Why don’t you ask him if it’s a date date or just a friend’s outing?”
“Yes. He’s pretty stupid to be a Healer, isn’t he? It was midday! The full moon isn’t even near!” She giggled.
“Maybe,” he signed just to appease her. He had missed their conversations the past week, when he had been too preoccupied with Harry’s revelation to pay any positive attention to his friends. He took a sip of tea, and thought that he wouldn’t bother Pansy again with his soulmate problems. “Did you finish the DADA homework last night?”
“We better go too, darling. You need to rest.”
“You cried so much Lucius and I had to make real efforts to not throw you out of the windows.”
Later that night, Draco went to sleep with a big smile, and for once his dreams were about a certain green eyed boy not telling him how a horrible soulmate he’d be, but about sweet things whispered in loving ways.
“A bit pretentious, isn’t it? A double door in such a small space?” Pansy asked when they reached the landing where the flat Draco was going to rent was.
“I bring this to someone called Dee that lives here. From Michael White,” the postman answered.
11:06 pm
A tree
“So? How was it?” Harry asked with a smile when she had swallowed the last drops.
“Sorry, honey,” her mother said, kissing her on the cheek.
“In the NEWTs exam you’ll have to demonstrate you know how to cast a patronus,” said professor Arias the next Tuesday during their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. “They’ll ask for it just in the written part, but it’s better if you already know how casting one feels. I know that many of you have already learned how to cast it, and have even used it in trying circumstances. So… Miss Abbott, how do we cast a patronus charm?”
“I’m sorry about yesterday,” Pansy said in a hushed voice. “Feles!” Her toad jumped a bit, and two whiskers appeared on its face.
Draco felt a bit better, he even smiled back, with a true smile, and not the grimace he had been doing lately. It was easy talking to Harry when he forgot about all the soulmate mess.
They took a step back to admire their hard work. Harry frowned and Scorpius looked in disapproval at the big tree.
“It’s interesting that both of you are having the same dream every night,” Pansy signed carefully, as if she was scared of saying the wrong thing and hurt Draco, “but it’s not like both of you are dreaming about the same thing. And there’s the problem of the voice, Draco. I think Granger is wrong, and you shouldn’t get your hopes up about this. If I were you, I’ll try to find the person that has you as their soulmate and forget about Potter.”
“Let’s see your big scar, then,” he said.
“It looks too red. I’ll put that salve you love so much on it so the itching stops.” He waved his wand, and a little bottle came flying from a cabinet.
Harry: I can't believe you aren't here. It's surreal. You're Draco!
“Congratulations.”
“She likes it too! She just kicked me!” Draco smiled, and received a bright smile from his husband in return.
Harry: Sometimes I think Hermione's heartless, or too rational to understand feelings.
He elbowed her so she looked at him, and shook his head.
Ron didn’t try to talk to him, or to rush him. He sat down next to him, and held him, while muttering nonsenses and kissing his hair.
Red lipstick.
“I’m sorry!” Pansy said with her best contrite face, and in an exaggerated low voice. Madam Pince seemed happy enough with it, but she kept looking at them like a vulture would look at its prey.
Harry: Don't worry, I didn't tell Blaise I love him this time.
4:07 am
“Good. Thanks,” Draco said, and got up. “I’m going to Pansy’s.”
Harry: Paperwork isn’t fun. I’m so bored, I want to die. I think I’m going to George’s shop to have some fun and to get my will to live back.
What?? Which one was it??
Harry: That’s how you say I love you in Hindi. So you see, I love you in a lot of languages, and want you to forgive me for my slip.
“He’s lying,” she says instead. “He only got to Hogwarts because he was the famous Boy Who Lived. He can’t do magic, but we all pretend he can out of pity.”
“Idiot! We’re friends! Nothing else! And you look nothing like Ron!” Harry felt a bit embarrassed after saying that, but letting Draco know how perfect he was seemed very important. “You’re handsome.”
Harry: Git.
Harry: Also when I say I drink with Blaise and Goyle I don't drink enough to get drunk (and neither do they!).
Then, I leave the alley through the Leaky Cauldron, as I need a muggle for the next step. I wander the streets of London until I find a man with a build similar to mine but with different hair and skin tone. This one has red hair and freckled skin. Perfect. A simple accio aimed at his head procures me some hairs. I go to a nearby alley to put the hairs in the polyjuice potion and take a sip of it. It tastes as awful as expected.
Draco
In spite of the winter weather, sunlight bathed the room, making it look cosy. He had often mocked Draco about how serious it looked, like an old lawyer’s office. However, Harry felt a pang of longing when he saw the mahogany furniture, and the dark green leather sofa. They were another reminder that Draco was far away now.
“You have cute freckles.”
“Yes, but —”
“I don’t mind, Harry.” He rolled his eyes. “I’m just embarrassed. I can’t believe I told you that.”
“You didn’t believe him, right?” Suddenly it was very important to Harry that Draco knew how likable he was. It hurt him seeing him so small. “When he said that nobody would like you, you didn’t believe him, right?”
“I still have to write a few inches about the defensive curses, that’s why I woke up so early. Do you want to go to the library now with me?” Pansy asked, as she cleaned her lips with a napkin.
, she thinks.
“And when did you do magic for the first time, Grandma?” Magic is all Lily speaks about lately.
“Ah, fuck! The living room! Well, I’ll leave! Bye!”
Harry: I love you.
It had been the hardest year of their lives, and he knew it wasn’t over, that they had to learn to live with all the pain and the sorrow that Draco’s death had caused. He knew that he had to learn to live with the hole in his heart, and soul; with the fear of forgetting about Draco; with the angst of seeing his things, his chair at the dining table, the picture on his bedside table, and the right side of the bed intact every morning. However, he knew that little by little he was getting his life back, people to talk to, reasons to smile and to laugh, people to rely on. And he also knew that it would be hard to find reasons to live without Draco, when he has so much to say, and Draco was so far away.*
They enter the study that hasn’t changed since Draco was a toddler, and Lucius serves two glasses of the liquor. Draco takes one and takes a sip.
Harry: How do you think animals learn to swim? Is it instinct? If so then we're the most useless beings on Earth because we're the only ones who need a beefy man to shout at us and teach us how to do it.
“Why did you do that?” Harry asked, with his face green and gagging. “You could have warned me!”
On the kitchen table, next to a tray of Swiss buns:
A dog?
“A sexy lullaby?” he signed, with his eyebrow raised. “Who the hell is your soulmate, and what the fuck is that kink of yours, Potter?”
Harry hasn’t told me anything yet. I know he’s suffering, this can’t be easy for a good man like him. He’s used to being the hero, not the villain. That’s
Draco sighes, defeated and disappointed, and leans against the window that she has been using to look at her family.
Draco shook his head. It was like Harry’s words had awakened him from his astonishment. He called Harry’s attention by waving a hand near him, and when he was sure he had his undivided attention, he answered.
Dear Harry,
“How do you know that? How do you know she doesn’t fake it?” Draco decided to ignore the first part of his father’s discourse, although it had touched him. It wasn’t usual for Lucius to admit he felt guilty about something.
Harry rolled his eyes at him, but picked his foot up again and kept massaging it. Draco’s feet were so swollen it hurt just looking at them.
“That’s a good idea! My mother's name was Lily, and my aunt’s Petunia. So we can follow the Evans traditions here.”
Harry: Or at least, that's how I learned.
“You’re right.” Harry smiled a little more at him, and kissed him on the cheek. “Am I forgiven for my little outburst before?”
A pale hand appeared in the shower holding a towel. Harry grabbed the towel, and the hand disappeared.
“It’s cute,” she said, looking around the living room.
Harry: DRACO! FUCK! PANSY'S GOING TO KILL ME! WHAT IF SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO THEM BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO KNOW!! FUCK FUCK FUCK I'M DEAD.
9:08 pm
Harry: I hate this. It's like I can't make the effort to remember things because you're not here anymore, so what's the point if I can't tell you about them?
It was orange
“It tastes almost good. I’m glad to see I’m your favourite patient again. I guess I can’t give you the dead spider I had wrapped for you.”
“No. Can we talk about something else?” he signed quickly.
The four of them got up with excitement, though Draco wasn’t about to drop the subject so easily. They left for the landing, and a few minutes later — they had to wait for Pansy because she had forgotten her purse inside — they went downstairs and to the café where, with a piece of cake before them, it was more rewarding to discuss Harry’s intentions.
“I’ll ask him out this morning,” he said, and Mrs. Williams smiled brightly at him.
Harry: I’ll tell you I love you in Hindi when I learn how to say it. Do you think there’s a lesson in the app for romantic sentences?
Harry: I know they aren’t a proper dinner, but who cares.
“Sorry! I fell asleep, I didn’t hear you!” Draco said. Harry’s heart did a weird jump at hearing his voice. It had been so long since the last time he had heard that drawled voice.
Harry: Aww, look, it's our wedding day! You were so handsome there!
“Draco isn’t coming right now. And you better go before I call the Aurors,” Harry said, standing before Michael and noticing that the other man was bigger and stronger than him. He wished he had brought his wand. He felt vulnerable just wearing his pyjamas.
Harry snorts and tightens the grasp of her hand. She does so too, thankful for his support.
“I dropped him. It’s us, Dee. I can’t leave you,” Michael said, making a movement as if to touch Draco’s hand, but Draco crossed his arms over his chest in that moment.
Harry: I had you last year and all the other ones before. I can't go to the cemetery this time, all alone, knowing that I won't have you to hug me and make me a hot chocolate when we're back at home.
“It tastes worse, doesn’t it?” Sarah said with suspicious eyes.
Draco sat up too, and readied himself to ask the question.
“Let’s try again,” Draco signed.
1:04 pm
I understand Harry’s plan when the waiter goes inside, but it’s too late to stop them.
Harry: What do you think? Is a month of isolation and crying for you enough?
As always Harry’s name was mentioned, Lucius let out a long sigh. He had taken the news of Draco and Harry dating better than Draco had expected, but he still had some opinions about it.
Draco showed him his middle finger. When he was close enough to Harry's bed, he sat on the chair next to it, and threw him the present he had brought.
“You’re wearing rubber gloves, sir.”
“It’s all wrong,” Scorpius said.
“I’m fine!” Draco signed, glaring at his friend. “I’m going to class, I don’t want to be late.”
“So how’s life with your bedmate?” Ron asked while he, Harry, and Hermione were having dinner the next day in a small restaurant.
Radwah laughed, and pestered him for more details all morning. Yes, he definitely could get used to that.
Harry: Today I had my second class of Introduction to Alcoholism courtesy of the Slytherin gang.
Dear Harry,
“You howled?”
“It was a mistake!” He signed with fast signs and with exaggeration so Weasley could see them clearly.
Sarah took the bottle from him and drank, still glancing at him with her eyes untrusting.
It all went down on Saturday, when during the quidditch training he threw the quaffle at Dean Thomas’s head on purpose because he made a comment about him and Seamus going to Hogsmeade later to celebrate their anniversary.
Harry: I’m going to be very busy these days buying all the presents, and I’m going to stay at the Burrow so this doesn’t get too depressing. I love you!
“Of course, we don’t want that.”
“It’s difficult and no everybody is able to do it,” Harry said with a calm expression that only managed to infuriate Draco.
He made up his mind. Who could he trust more than his soulmate? He needed someone who listened to him, who calmed him down a little, someone that just held him, and not started plotting something to fix his life. He needed a soulmate, even if it just worked as a friend, and nothing else.
Harry snorted at the note he had found stuck to the kitchen counter. He didn’t mind his new roommate eating his food; since the moment he had met Ron on the Hogwarts Express all those years ago, it always filled him with joy to have someone to share his food with.
“Why would I be jealous of the stars, Potter?”
Draco glared at Harry, but the idiot just smiled. Luckily for him, he kept the massage, so Draco didn’t hate him that much.
“Thanks, but he is not… I’m not in love…” he stumbled over his words.
Harry left the note just before leaving for work. He had one of those shifts ahead that lasted way too long and left him completely knackered. However, it was full moon night, so he was glad he’d be at the hospital, as his worry for Sarah had only grown in the past days.
Harry: Your friend sent me a howler at 8am telling me about her date with Ginny. I don’t know how it went, though, because I was too busy trying to make the howler shut up. I’m going to pay for this. I know it.
He left the note stuck to the book and called his friends. He needed a bit of support.
Draco opened his eyes to look at Harry, who was looking at him with a silly smile.
“Blaise is right, you know?” Pansy said with a spoonful of soup half its way to her mouth. “You’re being a dick to us. More than usual, I mean.”
“Yes.” Pansy glared at him, and Draco finally surrendered to her and decided to admit what had been on his mind since that moment. “No, and I think… Do you think that I should… I mean...”
“I hope so.”
“Leave me alone,” Draco said at the same time that he grabbed the door and slammed it in Michael’s face, who screamed again.
Harry read the note thrice in a row before letting out a relieved sigh. He didn’t know why Malfoy staying made him so relieved, but he supposed he had gotten used to sharing his flat with the git after all this time, and the truth was that he really liked having him as a roommate.
“Idiot. Well, it’s my way of apologizing. I can sing to you too, if you prefer.”
With no more words, I go inside Harry’s office and find him reading the article.
4.- Harry is coming back. Everyone has affairs. They’re part of marriage. Harry is going with Yours to Spain for two days, but he’ll come back, because I’m his husband and he loves me. We made our vows long ago, we’ve been driving each other mad and been obsessed with each other for ages, we love each other.
Draco didn’t answer. He had his gaze fixed on his hands, which rested in his lap.
“Are you alright?” Pansy asked as soon as he arrived. She had asked him that every day after that horrible encounter with Michael.
Harry: नमस्ते! I haven’t learned new words, so this is all I can tell you.
“Are we going to stay here all night or are we going to have fun?” Blaise said, putting away his empty butterbeer bottle and getting up.
“And the bedsharing?” Ron asked, smirking.
“I’m sorry, I —” Harry felt how he blushed too. “I didn’t intend to stare. I just — I had forgotten about it.”
“I heard you yesterday. You told Hermione you weren’t going to go to work until next month.”
“A business trip, I’ll be back on Sunday evening.”
“WHAT!? I don’t! It’s just that the person I fancy doesn’t like me back, so I can’t have what they have.”
“I… This is stupid. Forget it.” He turned his face, and looked intently at a tree to avoid Harry’s gaze.
Draco was finishing telling Radwah about the Harry Potter mess the next day at work when Martin shouted at them to get back to work, causing Draco to drop a very valuable potion.
8:09 am
“I told you, I’m jealous.”
Harry: Mornin*
Harry storms in the room and runs to the toilet.
“I miss him so much, dad,” Scorpius whispered at last, his wet face hidden in Harry’s jumper.
Harry: Because if that exists, you’re there, no matter what you think. You’re not evil enough to go to Hell.
“I thought we weren’t brewing anything,” Harry said as he looked at the list Draco had given him and picked some of the ingredients they’d need.
“Oh.” He felt a bit sad, with the nice evening they were having ending so soon because of his discomfort. “Okay.”
“Ron and Hermione are shiny?”
On the living room sofa, under a cushion:
“Are you blushing?”
“You saw me in Charms this morning, Potter, don’t be ridiculous,” he said, only because he knew it’d annoy Harry. He had missed him too. Painfully.
“I’m lucky I have someone as pretty as you then,” he mutters against her neck.
Harry: I’m doing sandwiches for dinner, do you want some?
“Mate,” Ron smiled, “you’re going to make a mark on the floor if you keep pacing.”
“Making a whole new potion is hard, Ron,” Hermione said. “The Wolfsbane they’re using takes all the suffering away, even during the transformation. I don’t think it’s just an improved Wolfsbane, but something entirely new.”
role and I know how to play it. I don’t know if I should tell him that I know everything, that I’ve taken care of everything. I think I should, because otherwise, how will I be sure that he disposed of Padma's body?
Ron let out a long-suffering sigh.
On Harry’s side of the bed:
“You would have, you prat! If I wouldn’t have killed you first.”
“Flowers?” Ron asked with his eyebrows raised, as if he had never heard about something so strange as flowers.
“He is! I did the laundry the other day and cleaned his clothes too, and the next day when I arrived from work, I found a note on the kitchen table thanking me and accompanied by a chocolate frog.” He smiled at the memory. He had had a not-so-nice night, as he had been thinking about Michael and about how he didn’t miss him that much anymore. It had been strange, as Michael used to be the centre of his life. But lately, he had felt happier, lighter, like the anxiety that had so often plagued him when he lived with his boyfriend was finally leaving.
He looked around and saw that most of his classmates had done it. Harry was petting a big stag with a proud smile, and a bit to his left Granger and Weasley were looking happily at theirs. Blaise was looking in astonishment at the big leopard that had appeared next to him.
You spent TWO HOURS yesterday talking about supermarkets
“Harry, I understand that you miss Draco, but—Harry?” Hermione looked at him worriedly.
I want to scream. I open my mouth to do it, but the sound doesn’t leave. I’m speechless, and the only thing I can do is watch as my husband walks away from me holding hands with his lover.
He walked past Ron, and a moment later they heard the loud crack of someone Disapparating.
“But, Grandpa…” Scorpius pipes up, furrowing his brow. The rest of them look at him, surprised, as it’s so strange for him to speak directly to Lucius. “You’re Mum’s father, not Dad’s. Why were Grandma and you so worried about his homework?”
I look closely at him. His surprised expression quickly changes to a calculating one. He’s trying to come up with a lie for me, I can tell, but I keep talking before he can come up with one. We have more important things to discuss than his trip with Yours.
They laugh. Draco has the article and the picture framed in her study, although she moves it to the living room whenever Ron is visiting. It’s one of the little pleasures of her life.
Harry: I miss you so much, Draco. I don't know how to keep living if you're not here. What am I supposed to do without you?
Scorpius wriggled a bit, so Harry let him go off his embrace. The boy put his head on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry hugged him with his arm, not wanting to be separated from the only person that kept him sane.
“Yes. It hurts so much. I didn’t know that prat was going to make us so miserable.”
“Yes, yes. Just… Draco. Er…” Harry blushed again, and seemed unable to look at Draco. Draco just stared in confusion. Finally, Harry looked at him again. “What spell did you use to save me?”
“Merlin, I don’t know how you put up with him, Harry. I wasn’t this bad when I was pregnant.” His mother said without even looking at them. She had her sight set on the blanket she was knitting with magic. It looked soft and beautiful, just perfect for their little baby.
The drawling voice came from behind. He turned and there he was, as perfect as he had pictured him in his mind. He was wearing a white shirt and jeans. The Muggle attire looked very good on him. His hair was less messy than the last time Harry had seen him, but it looked like Draco had messed it on purpose, in a way Harry couldn’t imitate with his own hair. He was also carrying two bags, so Harry hurried to take one.
“I think we have talked about it a lot already,” Draco drawled.
10:17 pm
“You’re in a hurry, aren’t you?” Harry whispered, pushing him towards the bed so Draco was lying on it.
“I can’t go—” he says in an annoyed whisper. “Fine! Fine! I’ll see you in ten minutes!”
The chasers hugged briefly to celebrate their goal. Over Thomas' shoulder, Draco saw Harry smiling at him.
Harry: I knew I shouldn’t have accepted! She looks as smug as you do when she thinks she’s right, that prat.
“I threw it into the lake. I picked a boat, rowed out into the middle and dropped the body there. I doubt anyone will find it,” he says in a whisper.
They turned around. For a moment, Draco thought she was talking about Potter, but it was just a man that looked a bit like him. Then he saw him; it was Michael, who had seen them too and was striding toward them.
Draco tried with a different memory, but again nothing happened. At the end of the class, he was the only one that couldn’t do it. Arias had tried to comfort him telling him it was a very difficult spell that not many were able to cast, but that didn’t make him feel better.
“I say that you’re an idiot for believing her,” Blaise signed and crossed his arms over his chest.
Harry: We had a busy and stressful weekend around here. Cassie got hurt, so I called Luna but she was in Finland (no idea what she's doing there though), so I had to take care of her hurt wing, and give her all the love I could. She's alright now!
McG is looking funny at me. I think she suspects something
Sarah nodded with another grimace, and her parents hurried to help her. Harry left, feeling useless, wanting the potion the hospital refused to buy more than ever.
Harry: We had game night at theirs tonight, and they announced it! I asked them to be the godfather but they said I already have Teddy and Rose, and that the new baby is for Ginny. She was very insufferable after that, the prat.
Harry stared at the tombstone —the delicate words etched into the marble surface, the date —he couldn't understand the date. The gap between the birth and death years were too small. He tried to stop the tears threatening to escape, but couldn't manage it. They ran freely down his face.
“I’m not a child, Mother. I can swear if I want.” He kicked Harry. “I didn’t say you could stop with the massage.”
He had liked Harry since before he knew he was his soulmate, although he hadn’t been able to make the other boy know that, and instead began an enemies relationship that lasted until Harry found him crying in a bathroom in Sixth Year. That was when he  had told Harry  what happened, what the Dark Lord had wanted of him, and Harry had helped him as best as he could, even when Draco refused to talk to Dumbledore about it.
“Are you our boss now?” Radwah asked angrily.
Oh, we’re back at the guessing game
“Just two years older,” Draco points out with feigned dignity.
Harry: I miss your sense of humour so much! I half-cried half-laughed over all the things you said. And I could hear you again, Draco! There was a voice message from you! After all this time, I could hear your voice! How can a voice be so beautiful even when you were saying “We’re not spending the night at the Weasels, Potter!”?
“Draco, I have something to tell you.”
Harry hugs him tightly and deposits a small kiss on his shoulder, smiling.
10:57 pm
6:08 pm
“Prat,” Harry said. “And yes, you are that. I was a better person before sharing a flat with you.”
Harry: I KNOW WHAT I’M DOING ABOUT PANSY!
Carefully, I drive back home. I think of helping Harry with the body, to destroy everything that could lead the Aurors to him, but then I think that it would have been better if I’d have stayed home. It’ll be Harry’s alibi. If any neighbour is watching our house, they’ll see the lights on, and that I’m there. I’ll have to trust Harry, and that he’ll be smart enough to destroy anything incriminating.
“Are you alright?” I ask.
“I’m amazing. Haven’t you read
With a sigh, he tried to focus on the Transfiguration class. They were supposed to transform a toad into a cat, but only Granger had managed to make some hair grow.
“Not a problem per se… I know who he is.”
“Me too. This will be like ten years ago and his ranting about the Yule Ball,” Pansy said.
“I had fun with him too!” Draco said. “We did a lot of things together, and I have very good memories of my time with him. You don’t know everything. I liked him. I loved him.”
“I have to agree with you there.”
“Beer is fine too, thanks,” he answered before taking a seat in front of Pansy. “Are you going to ask her out already, Greg?”
Harry: I think they’re trying to transform me into you. I should have checked the firewhiskey, maybe there’s some shady potion in it.
He’s still confused, I can see it, but he shakes his head no. Of course.
Harry’s body was closer and closer to the ground, and still, it seemed like none had noticed. He couldn’t lose him. He tried again. He closed his eyes for a second, and thought about Harry, about his smile, about how happy his presence made him, and let the memory of those happy moments overcome his scared mind. Then cast the spell.
“Ask him; talk to him. That’s what Narcissa and I do and it has worked so far,” Lucius said and finished his liquor, leaving his empty glass next to Draco’s.
Harry: She made an homophobic comment, that's why I wanted to kill her. I knew you wanted to know. Impatient git.
Harry: He's deaf. I couldn't leave him there with all the other dogs barking and ignoring him, could I?
Harry has always been a smart man, but I’ve always been very smart too. I Apparate home, and just for a moment let the rage I feel overcome me. I hex everything in sight, until I calm down enough to think properly again. Then I take a bath. It’s just my luck that when I’m getting dressed, I see Harry’s wand on his bedside table. He’s always been a mess. I sit down on the bed and plan. It doesn’t take me too long to come up with a perfect seven-step plan; after all, I wasn’t a Slytherin for nothing.
4:58 pm
Harry: It'd be nice if you answered me some time. Scary, but nice.
3:21 pm
“Can you write the spell?” Harry asked.
“A mistake my arse!” Thomas said. He had his hand on the head, and Draco saw that he had a bit of blood on his forehead. “You did it on purpose! I don’t know what’s wrong with you lately but you’ve been an arse.”
Harry smiled at how perceptive the woman was.
“The Ministry took it as war reparations. I don’t know what they did with it,” he said. “They took the manor too, although I don’t mind that too much. Too many unhappy memories there.”
3:27 pm
He shrugged and pointed his wand to the toad. Nothing happened.
Harry laughed and took it off while Draco looked with hungry eyes. Yes, that was better. He let out a gasp when he felt Harry’s hands on him, undoing the buttons of his shirt now. He didn’t wait for him to finish before taking it off over his head.
I wait and wait and wait and wait. The weekend drags itself on forever, only filled with my worries about if Harry is coming back and loves me or if he’s going away with Yours. In between my worries, I read news about Padma’s case in
“I’m your supervisor,” he said with that superior air that made Draco want to curse him.
He won’t be such an idiot to call the Aurors. It was an accident. He won’t ruin his life, his reputation, for an accident. No. He’ll take care of the body.
I don’t want to disturb him, so I lay on my side and try to sleep.
The restaurant staff guided them to their table in the little terrace at the back as soon as they stepped inside. The night was warm, perfect to have a long dinner while listening to the fountain in the middle of the terrace. Little pixie lights lit up the scattered tables.
“Well, maybe radiant is a more appropriate word for them.”
“Me too.”
Draco closed the flat door and ran downstairs. He could still feel his cheeks blushing, and his dick was hard, even though it had been a really embarrassing — and delightful — encounter. Harry was more beautiful than he remembered. He had grown up a few inches and was less thin than during the war. Draco saw a scar on his chest he didn’t know he had, and a birthmark on his shoulder that looked like a flower. He had tried not to look, of course, but he couldn’t help but to glance at his cock too. A smile turned Draco’s mouth upwards. He could get used to that sight every morning.
Harry: Say hi to our new family member!
5:47 pm
“In the bedroom!” he called.
“Idiot.” Draco took a sip of his butterbeer and glanced at him. “Are you feeling as awkward as I do, or are you more comfortable?”
“You’ll need a potion master for it,” Ron said. “It can't be that expensive to contact one and ask them, right?”
Harry: I’m meeting Pansy for lunch today. I’m waiting for her outside her office. Any tips to survive this?
They had left the restaurant after the desserts and had gone straight to their flat. Draco had made some sexual innuendos, and Harry had too, and now, standing in the living room, he didn’t know what to do. He knew what he wanted: to kiss Harry senseless and maybe something else. Something more daring than a few caresses. But he didn’t know if Harry wanted it too.
Harry: Did you know that duck shit stinks!?
Harry: Someday, Draco, I’m going to kill Pansy Parkinson and her love for waking people up way too early on the weekends.
“Uh, Draco… the towel!” He hid behind the shower curtain, and Draco seemed to snap out of his staring too, as he turned to find the towel.
On the kitchen table:
“This is so weird!” he said. “I think I’m only now realising that you and I are living together. It’s different now that we’re both here, because usually, I only know you live in the flat when I see your things or read your notes.”
“I’m shiny and beautiful, too.”
“Do you… Do you like Ron!?”
“Did you see that?” He asked with quick signs.
“I’m going to sleep too. I’m too tired to write this,” Draco signed. He didn’t bother to put his things away, knowing that none of his classmates would dare to touch them. Well, maybe his friends would, but he didn’t mind that.
The shop is as dark as I remember it from my youth, and hopefully it’ll be as discreet with its customers' demands. I wait, observing the shelves until the other clients leave, and when I’m alone with the shop assistant, I buy a bottle of polyjuice potion. I leave fifty galleons as a tip. I can’t have them babbling that I was here.
Nobody had seen Harry. He was going to catch the golden ball and win the match. Draco smiled a little, but then his mouth turned into an horrified grimace. Bakshi had seen Harry too and had hit a bludger his way. The ball hit Harry on the head, and now he was falling to the floor, unconscious.
Harry: Are you angry because I haven't visited you in all this time? I'm sorry, Draco, but I can't. You're not there. I like to think that you're around here watching after me, so I'm not going to go put some flowers in a tombstone because it'll make this more real, and I'm good as it is.
Draco nodded. Suddenly, he wanted to be very far from Harry.
“Isn’t there anything you can do to help her?” her mother asked. Her eyes were red, and her face looked tired and old, even if she was only a few years older than Harry.
“Your only fear is about Weasley and Granger’s reactions, right? Or is there something else?” Draco asked, already feeling awful for mentioning this, instead of going on with the snogging session they had planned.
4:38 pm
“Come on! It was a Gryffindor, wasn’t it? And I’m guessing it was a boy… or do you like girls too?” Harry said, now with a knowing smirk.
And that’s it. There’s no other possibility. He’s having fun with Yours, a few days away to relax and forget, but then he’s coming back home to me. I know.
"I'm trying, but sometimes I forget."
Harry: That's namaste. Hello in Hindi for you, you uncultured prick.
“The one that smells like lavender?” Sarah exclaimed. “Ugh! I hate that cream! You should give me one that isn’t that one, as I’m your favourite patient.”
“That’s because you’re a nosy bastard,” he said, smirking when she showed him her middle finger. “He’s kind of cute, though.”
Harry launched himself in a detailed explanation of how much it had improved Sarah’s life, and it made him even happier seeing how Draco glowed with pride at his work.
The thought had been bothering him since the week before, when he saw a butterfly and couldn’t remember if Draco loved them or hated them.
They were lying on the grass of the gardens of Malfoy Manor, hidden from the house, so it felt like it was just the two of them, lost in a secret forest.
He leaned back and let his hand work on Harry’s cock, finding a rhythm comfortable for both of them. His own cock was hard, but he ignored it a bit more. Finally, Harry came with a great moan, and Draco kissed him again.
I KNOW you’re rubbish at it
Harry kept tickling him in every part of Draco’s body he could reach.
“Idiot.” Harry pushed their shoulders together in a playful way. “I think we came here to do something else other than talking,” he said, raising an eyebrow.
Yes! Ours to spend the rest of our life in!
It’s very late when Harry finally arrives. He looks awful, and nervous, although he tries to hide it.
Draco and Harry laugh at Lucius' discomfort while he hugs Lily awkwardly, although the child doesn’t seem to notice.
“I like you! Okay? I was jealous! I want that too, what they have.  And I want it with you.”
“Right, but I don't mind. I feel bad making you sleep in another house instead of in your own bed. There’s no problem on my part, really.” He and his friends had slept in the same bed multiple times without anyone batting an eye about it. Of course, it was different sleeping with Harry, but they were going to sleep, nothing else.
He tried to put all thoughts related to Michael away and focus on the food. He hadn’t bought anything, so he hoped James wouldn’t mind too much that he used his food to make himself a sandwich. He left a note apologising and promising to buy everything soon.
Harry: MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
He couldn’t breath. Michael’s words were like a strong vice around his chest that got tighter and tighter. He used to joke about that, and Draco used to laugh. At how useless he was in cooking. At how he wouldn’t leave his bed in the mornings if Michael didn’t wake him up. But now… Draco had done all those things. He had proven he was capable. And Michael’s laugh and words didn’t make him laugh this time too. He felt tears in his eyes.
Harry: Sorry, Charlie threw a cushion at me because the light of the screen doesn’t let him sleep. Good night, Draco, and Merry Christmas!
The last sun rays entered the library bathing everything in a beautiful red and orange light. However, their group and their classmates didn't have time to enjoy it. The NEWTs were coming closer and closer, and the amount of work the teachers expected of them grew every day.
“I’m fine now. And it was you who told me to go away in the first place,” Draco said, crossing his arms.
They stared at each other silently for what felt like hours. Part of Draco wanted to snap back at Harry, to insult him, to tell him that maybe that’s what they should do if he was such a coward. Another part of him wanted to beg for forgiveness and assure him that he was willing to live in a hole forever if that’s what Harry wanted. He took a big breath and let the most rational part of him take control. He couldn’t lose Harry now.
“Aren’t you the one obsessed with me being up to something?” Draco smirked.
“You make it complicated,” Pansy muttered. “Let’s go to the café on the corner. I need cake.”
“She and you…?” I say, as if I don’t know that Padma is Yours, as if I don’t know she’s dead and rotting. He doesn’t continue. He’s so scared of hurting me! He’s always loved me too much. To help him confess something like what I know he’s about to tell me, I go for the jealous husband role. “Are you trying to tell me that you and Padma had an affair?”
“Why don’t you shut up already?”
He left the note stuck on top of Dray’s one and went to the bathroom. He had noticed small changes here and there all over his flat that showed that another person was living there now; however, nothing had prepared him for the bathroom. In the single shelf he had over the bathtub, there was now what looked like an entire apothecary of soaps, shampoos, and bottles, and Harry could only guess what they were for. He had trouble finding his small 2-in-1 gel that looked like an old man among all those other fancy bottles.
“I was in a hurry the other night when I wrote that!” Draco half shouted after him, but Harry showed him his middle finger over his shoulder and kept walking down the aisle. He smiled and went to look for his own ingredients.
Harry: At 7am.
“Draco…” Harry disentangled their hands and moved a bit away from him. He looked tense, and the warmth Draco could always find in him was no longer there. “I don’t think that’s wise.”
3:25 pm
, and I wear his favorite lingerie at night. It’s my way to tell him that I’m here for him, that he has me, that I have hidden the notes, and the tickets, and the pictures, that he’s safe. That he doesn’t need Yours to be happy, that I can be as good as her and everything he desires.
“If you’re sure…” Greg said, still unconvinced. “It could be a psychopath.”
“Were you... distracted?” Draco’s voice sounded like a purr. Harry looked at him and saw that his cheeks were still pink, but his eyes had relaxed and were bright. Maybe it hadn’t been such a bad idea to praise his body after all.
“Are you sure you two are alright?” Ron asked again.
“He’s just stressed,” Harry laughed, as he picked up a T-shirt. Draco looked avidly at his naked torso before the shirt hid it. “Wood was worse. He followed me around to tell me his ideas.”
Draco took a deep breath.
“He’s still Dray!” Harry said, emphasising his words with a hand movement that sent his dish flying to the floor. “Fuck!”
“But lately I’ve always dreamt the same. The words change, but he… he’s always doing the same thing. I wanted to research too. I don’t know if that’s a normal dream or something else.”
5:43 pm
“We’re both a bit fucked up, aren’t we?” Draco smiled.
He visited other patients in the ward, leaving Mr. Robinson for the end as he didn’t want to deal with him so early in his shift. As usual, the man insulted him and reminded him of how great the Dark Lord’s reign had been. Harry attended him in silence, as he wasn’t in the mood to discuss.
“You what!?”
“You think we all can agree I was a prat?” he said to lighten the mood a bit.
I nod and rest my head on his shoulder. I haven’t done this in ages, but it feels so good. However, a few minutes later Harry wriggles and I lift my head.
Harry: Good night.
“It’s a bad idea,” Hermione said, getting up too and vanishing the teacups to the sink. “I’m going to work now.” She pecked Ron on the lips, hugged Harry, and left.
“You can stay at my place until you find something better, Draco,” Greg said.
“Don’t worry, Weasley,” Draco signed, “We don’t want to lose against  the Weaselette either.”
“Do you think Ron will give us a speech?” Daphne asked when they were near the goal posts.
“Yes! I told you it’s all about the memory!” Harry exclaimed, going closer to Draco and engulfing him in a hug.
He tried to swallow the lump on his throat again, but he couldn’t. He nodded.
Harry: Anyway. Pansy. Tomorrow I’ll meet Ginny for lunch, and then I’ll tell her about how nice, and interesting, and intelligent Pansy is… And then I’ll ask her to date her!
“You’re going to share your bed with a stranger!” Ron said, still looking at Harry as if he had gone nuts in front of him.
She gave him a one armed hug.
I hear steps. Closer and closer. Two people. Flat shoes and high heels. They laugh. Yours lets out a silly giggle. I roll my eyes. Parvati opens the car door and slips inside. Harry curses under his breath about the tyre. He’ll need to change it, as modern muggle inventions don’t do well with magic. He goes to the car boot. I walk towards Parvati’s side of the car, crouching down so Harry can’t see me. When I’m close enough, I pull Harry’s wand out of my pocket, still wrapped in the handkerchief. I get up, point the wand at Parvati’s surprised face and say the words:
Draco??
“That was Theodore’s experiment. I don’t know if he was trying to make a drink or a poison,” her father says, taking a seat on one of the armchairs in front of the fireplace.
Draco sighs and Harry sees how his back hunches a little as he stares at his feet, already on the floor. Then he turns to look at Harry.
“And that’s not a problem, how?” Ron asked, his eyes as wide as saucers.
Harry moves to wash his hands, and in spite of herself, she misses the hug.
“Tomorrow, you’ll go to the Aurors. You’ll tell them that you were having an affair with Parvati and that Padma discovered it, that’s why she had all the pictures and notes in her flat.”
“I didn’t confirm nor deny if it was Weasley.” He got up and picked up the trash bag. “Let’s get brewing. I’ll warn you before Apparating this time.”
Harry: As I’m sure you know, I haven’t been feeling well since Thursday, so I’ve been too busy eating buns with chocolate chips and feeling pity for myself. So I couldn’t talk to Ginny about Pansy until today.
“Oh! Do we know him too?”
“He isn’t,” Greg said. “If I’d ask out someone, I wouldn’t do it in the same note I ask them if they’re still living with me.”
I go to the garage and the sight of his dirty car welcomes me. Doesn’t he know that there are ways of tracking someone’s location by the dirt on their shoes? I clean the car until it’s as good as new. As I clean it, it starts raining, which fills me with joy. It’ll destroy the car’s tire marks near the lake.
In the following weeks, Draco tried to be his old self.  He ignored all the dreams he was having in which Harry whispered different versions of what he had said that first night in the Astronomy Tower. However,  Draco kept going to the library to look for something that explained them, but he hadn’t found anything yet. Meanwhile, Harry hadn’t mentioned to him anything else about the beautiful voice that visited him in dreams, but Draco had overheard him talking to Weasley and Granger about it.
“My big scar is itching again, and I howled when Healer Stevenson entered before, and he ran so fast he broke his nose against the wall,” she said, smiling and with her blue eyes shining.
“At different times!” Harry reminded him. “So it doesn’t really count!”
Harry wrapped the scarf around his neck. It was a very hot July, so it made him uncomfortable, but he’d do anything for Mrs. Williams to smile again.
Harry signed the note and went back to the kitchen, where Ron and Hermione were having breakfast next to his morning dinner.
“But you like Potter,” Greg pointed out. “And I’m not talking about your crush now. I’m talking about the weird thing you have with him here, with the bed, the notes and all that.”
“I think it’s some kind of steak with sauce,” Draco said, reading the menu with his brow furrowed. “Mmmm, I think I’ll have a risotto.”
I’m glad you have a heart next to my name in this horrible muggle device. However, I’m not writing as a barbarian even if it’s to you. I think I stated my point in my last message, but here it is again: no, I’m not.
He was so focused on his shower that he didn’t realise the bathroom door had been opened until he heard a gasp. He opened the curtains and stared at Draco Malfoy, who was standing in the door with his mouth agape, only wearing pants.
tree in all Britain!” They said together, and laughed.
I’m crying!
OMG, DRACO! Why didn’t you say so before??
“Let’s look on the bright side,” Greg said.
“What?” Draco smiled at seeing how his friend blushed. “No, of course not!” Greg muttered something else and took a sip of his beer.
Harry sat next to him, and threw an arm over Draco’s shoulders, squishing a bit.
“I heard him” he signed with quick movements. Pansy, and his parents were the only ones that knew enough BSL to follow Draco’s natural signing speed. For anyone else, he had to slow down. “Harry.”
His father looked offended at that, but Draco didn’t care. He couldn’t believe he had been that close at naming his precious daughter something as egregious as Ruth. He rubbed his belly, asking the baby for forgiveness.
The pictures.
“Hello,” he greets me. “I’m back.”
Michael can’t think there was anything more than a boss-secretary relationship between Padma and Harry.
5:34 pm
Ron found him in the Ministry toilets, sat on the dirty floor, and crying his eyes out. It was the 5th of June, Draco’s birthday, only this year, he had no one to write a card to, buy a present for, bake a cake for, to tease, and to talk, and to spend a lovely day with. No one at all.
“Okay, that’ll be great. Yes, we were together that night.”
“Good, good. Look what I knitted for you,” she said, showing him a green scarf.
Harry: Just… what’s wrong with her? Seriously, Draco, is she ill or something?
“That you share with Harry Potter.”
“Not especially,” she said with a bored voice, but the blush that had appeared on her cheeks didn’t fool Draco.
“Idiot!” Harry punched him playfully on the shoulder. “It’s a joke, isn’t it? Git.”
“And flower names? My aunt’s name was Daisy,” Lucius cut in the incoming bickering.
Harry: Blaise and Goyle came by this afternoon. They brought firewhiskey and we drank together. It was weird.
“Ugh!” He tried to change positions, as he was becoming uncomfortable again. “I’m going to call her Pain. Fuck!”
He noticed Draco looking and smiled shyly . Draco smiled back, and making sure the professor couldn’t see him, he signed a quick lucky bastard. Blaise’s smile grew bigger.
I wonder what they’ll find, and the fear of them finding anything that incriminates Harry makes me sick. But he told me how he cleaned everything; he’s a smart man, my Harry, they won’t find anything.
“This must be the
“Shut up,” he said. “What do I do now? I can’t keep living here after this! He’s Potter, for Merlin’s sake!”
Draco was sitting on the bed, still looking tiny, and crying quietly. Harry didn’t know what to do.
“Oh, there’s no need…” Harry felt how he blushed. What was Draco thinking? There was only one bed! “I’ll stay at Ron and Hermione’s. I always sleep there on weekends. They don’t want me to be alone for so much time. They’re a bit… overprotective sometimes, you know? Thanks though.”
Pansy burst out laughing when she finished reading the note, and Greg had a stupid smile on his face. Draco wanted to slap them and to curse Potter. Potter! He had been living with Potter!
He sat on the desk chair, and looked around.
“Don’t you have a husband and two children to look after before they destroy my garden?” Her father asks annoyed, although she knows him well enough to know he’s teasing her back.
“Sometimes it’s hard to believe that
“You’ve told me that,” Draco interrupted hastily. “But when are you going to do that, eh? What’s the difference between telling them now or next week?”
Summer and climate change are things
7:30 am
Witness’s Name: William Smithers
After I fainted at the portkey station and some good people helped me recover, I went back home and cried. I cried for hours, for our broken relationship; for my own idiocy at not recognizing who Yours really was; for Padma, dead in a lake; and for myself.
“Well, what do you want? Apart from murder me with butterbear, that is,” he signed.
Harry: Ron says that I have done enough grieving, and that I should get back to our daily training, and to work.
On the wall, next to the myriad of mirrors:
“Can you leave us alone?” Michael looked at his friends like they were dirt, and Draco knew he wasn’t going to give up until he had what he had come to get.
“Good evening,” he greeted the old lady. “How are you today?”
“Your friends risked their lives to defeat You-Know-Who. They’ve been with you through a lot of things, and now they’re going to leave you because you’re dating me? Seriously, Harry! I think I know them better than you do.” Draco was glad to see Harry’s mouth turned a bit upwards.
“What are you doing here? Can’t I have a moment of peace?” he signed quickly. He was a bit annoyed because he was sure that this time it would have worked.
“I think he’s asking you out on a date, but in the clumsiest way I have ever seen,” Radwah said.
“What?” Draco’s blood had gone cold. Then he realised, all made sense then. “You told Michael where I live, and did you tell him I was meeting my friends in that pub too, didn't you?”
I change into my best shirt and trousers that I haven’t worn so long. Then, I take Harry’s wand from the bedside table with my hand wrapped in a handkerchief. It wouldn’t do for me to leave any fingerprints there. I need Harry’s.
“I was just going to say that we have to be careful to catch the snitch once we’re winning by twenty points!” Weasley said.
“Greengrass with the quaffle.” The commentator’s voice reached Draco’s ears. He looked at the terraces and saw a girl he didn’t know sitting next to McGonagall. “She passes it to Malfoy, who passed it to Thomas, who passes it— Ouch! That must have hurt! A bludger thrown by Peakes hits the Eight Year student who drops the quaffle. Weasley with the quaffle.”
Harry: Merlin, Draco! I begged Robards to give me a case again, because doing paperwork was making me want to kill someone, so he agreed and… well… it didn’t go well.
“You two are like little children. It’s a miracle Lily and Scorpius are such good kids.”
He looked at the lake again. It would be great if Harry was right, if the voice he heard was Draco’s or, well, some magical voice supposed to be Draco’s. They were friends, they had an amazing relationship, and they knew each other better than anyone; they were perfect for each other already. Draco thought that maybe that’s everything he was getting out of this. Maybe he didn’t need a soulmate to marry or to have a romantic relationship with. Maybe he was only getting friendship. But what would happen when Harry finally met his soulmate, the lullaby singer? Would he forget about Draco? Would their friendship change?
“If you mention Bakshi again, I’ll hit you with my bat” Pansy said.
“I fucking hate this,” Draco complained for what felt like the hundreth time that day.
10:10: pm
today. They look pitiful, as always, and they have written a sad article about how much they miss Padma. I fear that their words get to Harry’s heart, that they break him, and make him confess. We can’t have that. I get dressed and floo to his office.
“And finally, remember to get out of Bakshi, their new beater. I don’t want any of us to end in the floor with their brains scattered all around us. Alright?” Weasley asked, frowning at all of them. “And most importantly, I don’t want to lose against my sister’s team!”
I honestly have no idea of what it could be
“I think you should relax, and start thinking about other things.” He furrowed his brow in indignation, and was ready to start ranting at Pansy, but then she interrupted him. “I mean! I know it’s awful, Draco, I know it is, but you can’t be thinking about it all the time! You’re driving me crazy, and you too! Maybe it was just a normal dream.”
On Thursday, Harry leaves early. The portkey station is usually very busy on weekdays, so he likes to arrive with enough time to spare. When I’m making the bed, I notice the blue folder on his bedside table. I swear to myself, and putting on the first clothes I see, I Apparate to an alley near the station. Typical Harry, forgetting something very important behind.
“I’m going to the bedroom to get dressed!”
He comes home at his usual 5:15pm, and I don’t say anything about the note. If it’s important, if it has any meaning, I know he’ll tell me. We have dinner in silence until his mobile rings. He excuses himself and goes to the living room for some privacy. I get up and spy from the shadows.
Harry: I have so much free time and so little to do.
“Harry,” Draco said, smiling. “What are we going to do on our date?”
Harry entered the room of his favourite patient. Obviously, he wasn’t allowed to have favourites, but the little werewolf girl reminded him too much of Teddy for him to be neutral.
The last Saturday of April, they had their quidditch match against Hufflepuff. Thankfully, Ron didn’t have to look for another chaser as Draco hadn’t thrown any other quaffles into his teammates' heads. They won for just ten points when Harry caught the snitch under the Hufflepuff seeker's  nose. The eighth years threw a party to celebrate their victory.
Harry: Good news! Leo learned to do a handshake with me! Isn't he adorable?
“Maybe the Latin version of little monster, for posh points, you know?” Draco sighed. “We have thought of some names, but Harry doesn’t like my options.”
“I’m not his soulmate. He dreamt with someone else’s voice.”
Harry: So Pansy found out about me telling Blaise and Goyle about her, but she says she'll let me live and have all my body parts, if I convince Ginny to go out on a date with her.
“It’s an old building,” the caretaker answered, taking out the key and opening the door. “They were bigger flats, but they did a renovation to make a bunch of one-rooms flats. Come inside.”
It’s Friday when I read a new article about the Padma case in
“My boy?” Harry said, confused.
The first step of my plan leads me to Gringotts. I have to wait ten minutes before a goblin is free to guide me to our vault. I take as much money out as I’m allowed without having to sign any parchments, as the vault is shared with Harry and they need both our signatures to empty it. It doesn’t matter. We have enough for me to leave the bank with a good sum. I put it all in my satchel, charmed to carry an infinite amount of things without it being too heavy. Then I change some of it into muggle money.
Draco rolled his eyes, and readied himself to defend James once more. The conversation kept going like that for a few hours, and Draco went to bed that night feeling a lot better than how he had felt that morning.
Harry: Sorry about that. Hermione caught me texting you, and asked me who I was talking to. My phone fell and she saw. I had to endure an hour of her explaining that you're… that you're the d-word. As if I don't know! As if I am not painfully aware of that every second of my life.
“So gentlemanly of me!” Harry laughed. He glanced at the clock on the wall and cursed under his breath. “We should go, it’s getting late. I’m Apparating us!”
“Just because you said ‘please’. Besides, I can’t let you live on your own much longer. You don’t fold your socks.”
Martin had gone pale. He had always enjoyed being the important person, the one in charge, so Draco guessed that hearing about Michael using him hadn’t felt very good. Draco looked at him with distaste once more, and strode into the back room. He thought that Martin wouldn’t bother him again in a while.
Harry sighed. There was too much at stake in his relationship with Draco. There wasn’t just their past, but their living arrangement that would become uncomfortable if he said anything about his feelings. He remembered that Draco had said he was his crush, but a crush was just that. It wasn’t real liking — love. Was it? And maybe Draco had been talking about the past, about Hogwarts. Then there were the notes. After the bathroom encounter, they had exchanged some notes praising each other’s bodies, but they hadn’t meant anything, right? Harry had meant them, of course, although he had hoped that Draco thought he was just joking.
“How are you feeling today?” he asked softly. He hated this part of his work, seeing his patients in pain and being unable to help them. He had thought that becoming a Healer would keep his saviour heart happy, but he hadn’t realised that he wouldn’t be able to save everyone.
“It wasn’t that hard.” He shrugged. “I may have gone there and they saw my scar and almost forced me to book a table.”
“Your fifteen-year-old self must be jumping with happiness at sleeping in the same bed as Potter,” Greg said, with that silly smile still on his lips.
“I didn’t. I was… distracted. I mean, you were wearing just pants… your arm wasn’t something I noticed at that moment.”
“Sarah will have her first transformation soon, and she’s so small…” Harry said.
Auror’s Notes: Mr Smithers place of employment is the café across the street from Padma Patil’s flat.
“Draco!” Her mother chastises.
My nails are shorter than ever as I haven’t stopped biting on them, and I have bags under my eyes from lack of sleep. Padma and Harry and Parvati are all I think about all day. Harry’s DNA on Padma’s body; Harry and Parvati shagging in the sun in Spain; signed Yours with red lipstick; Padma’s swollen corpse; Harry coming back because he loves me; Harry not coming back because he doesn’t love me; Parvati smirking at me…
“But you can fl- Wait. It’s not because they’re flying… It’s because they’re together!?”
“Sounds good.”
“Harry? Are you listening to what I’m saying?” Hermione asked with her eyebrows furrowed. It wasn’t a good idea to zone out while she talked.
“No. The hospital refuses to buy the potion other hospitals are using because they say it’s too expensive, and that someone here can come up with the right ingredients any moment now. However, we need money for it, and I think I’m the only one that worries about it,” Harry said.
The doorbell rang again for a few seconds. Annoyed, Harry opened the door and found a man he hadn’t met before.
“And according to the idiot named after an oversized lizard, Lyra is a musical instrument not a person’s name.”
“She harassed me, Draco. Sexually. She kept insisting and insisting, and I— It was an accident. I pushed her and she fell. She broke her neck.”
“I think he’ll fill out a report about me again.” Draco shrugged. “I finally found a new flat.”
Some years later, on Draco’s side of the bed, next to a little box:
“Well? What is it?” his father asked, waving his wand to fill two glasses with firewhisky and handing one to Draco.
“You will. When people learn about us, it won’t be funny, Harry,” Draco says, looking at him with pity in his eyes as if Harry doesn’t understand how evil the world can be. “They won’t leave you alone. The Boy Who Lived dating a Death Eater turned whore? You could lose your job and reputation.”
Lucius tries to keep explaining himself, but luckily for him Narcissa decides to change the topic and starts asking her grandchildren about their week. Draco engages in the new conversation, but part of her is still thinking about her father’s words. He isn’t going to change. He’s going to see her always as a man who is playing to be a woman.
“No,” he signed. “I've just  stopped thinking about it all the time. It’s not like he’d love me back, is it? Have you learned anything new about your singer?”
It’s not that I don’t trust Harry, because I do, I love him, but I don’t think he can do this on his own. I know some part of him is still hesitant about incriminating Parvati. He doesn’t love her, but his heart is too noble to do something like that. That’s why I’m Apparating outside the Auror’s office, to see if he actually goes inside or if he chickens out.
After some cleaning charms, they snuggled together in bed to sleep. Draco couldn’t stop smiling.
“Does this mean I win?” Harry asks in disbelief.
“So you being suddenly so understanding isn’t a symptom of a terrible illness?” She teases.
“Aren’t you going to show me the infamous bed?”
“Come in!” she says.
“You usually write better than this, you know. Okay, wish me luck finding all these things!” Harry laughed and went away.
They heard Ron’s voice getting louder, and then a bang as the door was closed with too much force.
“In your dreams again? What did he say this time?” Pansy asked with interest.
“I’ll see you soon, Dee,” Michael whispered when he pulled apart. “At your flat, in a few weeks, okay? I have a business trip now, but then we’ll talk about this, about us.”
“Sure, and, please, feel free to enter this time. There’s no need for you to wait on the landing until I save you.” Draco smirked, and Harry cursed to himself. “Do you want to...er… sleep here tonight? By the way, where do you spend your weekends?”
“Good evening, Mrs. Williams, how are you?” he said as he entered the old lady’s room.
“Dashing! I’m sure all the young ladies would fall for you when you wear my scarf,” she said proudly.
He opened the door with more force than necessary and stared at the little postman, who tried to look over the big bouquet he was carrying.
Lucius got up from his chair behind his impressive desk and sat on the armchair in front of the fireplace, his usual spot when Draco came to talk to him. Draco sighed and sat on the couch.
1.- It was a coincidence. Harry has known Parvati since they were eleven, and he and her sister were coworkers. Parvati is a journalist, she has to travel a lot for work. They met at the portkey station and as they have known each other for ages they decided to go together. Harry’s a kind man and Parvati is suffering, hence the hand holding.
“I… On Monday, the phone call I received wasn't from Ron. It was Padma. She and I…” He looks at me and hesitates.
Harry: I had such a busy day today! First, running in the park with Ron, and looking at the ducks on our bench.
Harry: Wow. That was cruel, wasn't it? I’m sorry. Fuck, I’m crying now. I love you.
They were right. As soon as they arrived —they were the last ones— Weasley began to remind them of the importance of winning their last match, against Gryffindor, if they wanted to win the Cup.
“It’s a great idea! Hermione, tell him it’s a great idea!” Harry said from his place on the sofa, next to his best friend.
“Bloody hell!” Ron exclaimed when he went back to the kitchen. “Who the fuck is Michael?”
You’re so cute when you talk about him
5:09 pm
He hesitated in the doorframe of Draco’s studio. He hadn’t gone inside since Draco asked him to bring him one of his books to the hospital. That had been a lifetime ago, when Draco was ill, and Harry had hope. The book was in their bedroom now. Draco hadn’t finished it, and Harry had left it on his bedside table, as if he would come back some day and read it before bed.
“I know!” Harry said, making a placating movement with his hands. “It’s just weird.”
Harry woke up sweating. The sheets only covered his waist, but something heavier and hotter was pressed to his back, and something else was wrapped around his chest. He looked down, trying to understand, but his brain was still foggy with sleep. A pale arm was hugging him. Draco. Draco was cuddling him. A soft snore on his back confirmed it. Well, at least he was still asleep. Maybe Harry could disentangle himself and Draco wouldn’t notice the erection he had.
He spent the Saturday morning in the library studying, and doing his homework, and after lunch, Pansy, Daphne and him went together to the quidditch pitch for their training session.
“No… Can you run a hot bath for me, though?” He looked at Harry with his best pleading eyes.
“Can’t you?” Pansy asked, wiping her laughing tears with her hand. “You like living here, and, honestly, I haven’t seen you this happy in years. What difference does it make that ‘James’ is Potter?”
6:25 am
“Good morning!” he greeted cheerfully as he entered the shop.
Harry: Luna was studying a magical species indigenous to Finland! That's why she was there! And drinking mulled wine, the most amazing drink on Earth! Don't worry, I'm not actually becoming an alcoholic, in fact it doesn't have alcohol at all.
Harry kissed the scars on his chest with care, as if his kisses could make them heal, and then sucked his nipples. Draco kissed him wherever he reached; a hand, a shoulder, the forehead, and buried his hands in Harry’s hair.
Harry: Yes I know it’s bloody early for this but I couldn’t sleep because I needed to pee and then Leo woke up and followed me around so I put him on the bed with me and I don’t know how it happened because he’s tiny but now I only have a little space in the bed for myself so I can’t sleep
“It’ll be fine! We won’t even see each other! I’m planning on spending all my weekends at your house as always,” Harry said.
Draco left work early that Tuesday, so he, Pansy, and Greg met in a café in Diagon Alley to enjoy the summer afternoon together.
On the living room table, stuck to a glass bottle with a turquoise potion in it:
Harry laughed and finished preparing the ingredients while Draco focused on the work at hand. He loved potions, and the thought of discovering the formula for the improved Wolfsbane excited him a lot. From the corner of his eye, he saw how Harry was looking curiously at the shelves full of jars, liquids, potion ingredients, and books. He moved in silence, as if trying to make the least noise possible to not bother Draco.
8:02 am
aren’t going to brew anything,” Draco pointed out. “I’m going to brew them in the potion’s shop I work in. I asked my boss, and he said it was alright. Come on, let’s go to the alley here to Disapparate.”
Harry: I was awake until very late last night rereading everything I’ve written to you in these last months, and all our conversations before that.
“I’m sorry. I think— well, I know I wasn’t trying hard enough but after what Scorpius and Lily said today I think I’ll do better. I know this is very stupid of me but I haven’t realised they hadn’t met you before, and— I’ll do better. I promise, Draco.”
I trust you. I know it’s perfect
On Draco’s desk, stuck to a book titled
“You’re paying that potion from your salary, Malfoy.”
“Maybe it is,” Draco signed with a blissful smile. They looked at the lake for a few moments, until he gathered all the courage he could muster to ask what he had been dying to know. “You haven’t answered me, who is it?”
Draco let out a suffering sigh.
1:12 pm
“Okay. You’re a bit higher up. You’re an… acquaintance.”
After Harry trusted me with what had happened that night, I hoped that our relationship would improve, but he kept his distance as before. I think he was too affected by all that. Not because he cared about Yours, but because he’s a soft, good man who had been forced into a horrible situation.
“Yeah, they can be like that.”
Lucius looks at her, as if looking for help, but she raises her eyebrows awaiting his answer. Then he looks at Narcissa, who smirks at him, and, finally, he looks at Harry, which shows how desperate he is. Obviously, Harry just glares at him.
The five Slytherins that  had returned to Hogwarts for their Eighth Year were sharing a table in the common room, and doing their homework,  books and parchment were scattered all over the place. On the purple sofas near the fireplace, the Gryffindors were playing chess, and talking quietly. Draco looked at them from time to time and wondered if Harry had dreamt again with the beautiful voice.
“The stars?”
Next to the last note:
“I was trying to do the patronus charm, but…” His fingers wavered, but he saw that Harry understood.
“Vega. It’s the brightest star in the Lyra constellation, so it’s like a peace offer: it’s not Lyra, but it’s close to it. Do you like it?” He looked at Harry hopefully.
Harry: Pansy wasn’t there tonight, so no news on that front.
“I’m going to Spain on Thursday,” he says when we’re in bed.
“Bedmate, more like it,” Ron muttered.
My pine? You want to touch my pine?
“What?” Harry started rubbing the scar with the salve. “Excuse me, but my favourite patient is Mr. Robinson next door.”
I can help Harry. I can end this. When he comes back, he’ll see how much I love him, and we’ll be as we were before, with the sex, and the passion, and the kisses.
“That’s not kind of cute, that’s really cute,” Radwah said, emphasizing the last words.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry asked, putting the dirty napkins in the bag they used for the trash.
“Dean’s right, you know, you’ve been playing badly all day too. I’ll look for someone who plays as chaser against Hufflepuff if you’re going to be like this,” Weasley said. Draco thought he was a bit worried for him, but he wasn’t sure. Ron hasn’t forgiven him as easily as Harry for the war. “Training’s over.”
Harry: Ron is on Hermione's side now, telling me to look for help because I can't go on like this. But this is normal. I looked it up on Google and it said that mourning lasts 6 months.
“Do you want to live with me or with Greg?”
“You what?” she finally asked, with her voice raspy and tears falling down her cheeks.
“I’ll talk to him. Promise.” He smiled, and the old woman smiled back.
“At different times,” Draco reminded her. “I’ll use it at night and he in the mornings, and I’ll have the flat for myself on the weekends too. It’s perfect! And cheap. I can’t afford anything else, and no way I’m paying for that mouldy flat we saw in Knockturn Alley.”
“And what is going to happen in a bit more time? Is Weasley going to be my best friend in a week? Is Granger going to hug me in the corridor in a few days?” Something inside Draco snapped as he talked. He had waited enough, and Harry’s excuses were always the same. Waiting wasn’t going to change things. “Harry! Things aren’t going to solve themselves just because we wait! You have to tell them! Aren’t you a Gryffindor? So be brave! Tell them you and I are together! This isn’t like before, we’re friendly now. They should understand. They—”
Harry: I couldn't find Leo when I got home (yes, I went back to training with Ron). I was so worried! I found him curled in one of my slippers. Isn't he adorable?
Draco ran through the castle corridors while cursing under his breath. He was late for his secret meeting with Harry in one of the empty classrooms. It hadn’t been his fault, really. It was Pansy’s and her endless blabbering about this new girl she had met. Merlin! Were all people who were in love like that? He was sure he didn’t talk about Harry that much. Not that he could, anyway.
Harry: I want kids. Or wanted. I'm not sure I can have them now because how am I going to, without you?
Harry: Have I told you that I’m going to kill your friend Pansy? She came here AGAIN, with Blaise and Goyle, and I had to hear about her date AGAIN! How did I end with all these overtalktative Slytherins in my house? Ah, yes, because I married their king.
“Of course.”
3.- He’s running away with her. They’ve been having an affair for Merlin knows how long. They love each other. She’s Yours, and Harry loves her, even if she doesn’t know him at all. They’re going to live in Spain together, in a nice flat near the sea. Harry will forget about me, except to send me the divorce papers.
Witness’s account: It was some months ago, but I remember well because he was very weird. He looked like some rich wizard, you know? Expensive robes and everything. Very pale and with white-blonde hair. He was wearing those gloves muggles use to do the dishes. At first, I thought he was one of those pureblood wizards who don’t understand muggle clothing, but when I pointed them out to him, he took them off quickly and said he had forgotten he was wearing them. Who forgets something like that?
Harry! He loves me! I knew it! Of course, he loves me! This thing with Yours doesn’t mean anything. Maybe it even ended while they were away.
“Really?” she exclaimed. “How is it?”
“Hey,” he greeted. “No, we’re going to the beach. There’s an apothecary in Brighton that has more variety than the one in Diagon Alley. Besides, the bloke at the one in the alley is an idiot.”
Draco lets her gaze wander down her reflection on the big bathroom mirror. She’s naked, and her long hair feels soft all the way down her back. Her eyes stop at her breasts. She smiles, happy, and keeps looking. Her chest is crisscrossed with scars of a long time ago, and her belly looks softer than it looked in her teenage years, but who has the time to exercise with a full time job and two little menaces roaming the house? She shrugs. Her penis is flaccid against her tight, that is marked with stretchmarks and a bruise (she had told Harry to move that stupid little table after using it, but he keeps forgetting and she keeps bumping into it). She looks at her feet. They have always looked too masculine to her, too big. Even the pale pink nail polish she uses on the toenails doesn’t hide the fact that they’re male feet. She sighs, and picks her knickers from the bench next to the mirror.
Draco sighs to herself, now actually disappointed at her father. It has been ten years since she came out to him as a trans woman, but he’s still treating her as a man. Harry looks at her, and she notices that he's angry on her behalf, so she smiles a little to reassure him that she’s fine. However, she can see he isn’t convinced. He turns to Lucius and opens his mouth to speak, but someone beats him to it.
on his desk. The Patil’s article must be common knowledge by now.
Harry: I'm not going this year. Do you think my parents will be angry?
“Idiot,” Draco smiled.
The Aurors work quickly when there’s foul play; by Sunday afternoon the Wizarding World is shaking under the news of Padma’s cruel murder. Apparently, someone hit her in the neck with a heavy object and dropped her body in the middle of the lake. They find a boat on one of the shores. They’re looking for fingerprints, but the Auror leading the investigation doesn't think they’ll find anything after all this time. I sigh with relief.
“It’s one I found in an old Charms book,” he signed. “I haven’t tried it before, but the usual gliding spells weren’t working, and I was desperate. You were right, by the way,” he added with a smile. “Happy memories make magic work better, not only patronus.”
“Yes, but after seeing him naked the other day, I don’t think it’ll be that bad, you know?”
Harry: This week reminded me of when we went to that cottage in the north of Spain. Remember when you thought you had seen a bear, and even insulted me when I told you it wasn’t, and then we did a magnifying spell and saw it was a cow? Or that time we spent all night awake, looking at the stars and almost freezing to death because it was November and we forgot we’re wizards and can cast warming charms?
Harry: Ron says I’m a sentimental idiot because I’m still worried about the woman and her husband (I firecalled St Mungo’s and they told me the man is fine).
“Of course I want!” Harry almost shouted. He sat on the bed facing Draco and took his hands on his. “Can I hug you, my saviour?” He asked in a hushed tone.
“Hah! Does that mean you’ll reconsider Olivia or Ava or Isla now?” Harry asked.
Harry: This is stupid. You’re thinking I’m an idiot, right?
“Hey! Thanks.”
“It was easy since we already knew some of the ingredients and steps we needed, and I didn’t do it alone. Radwah helped a lot, although I must say that the good potion was one of the five you and me brewed together.”
Harry: I asked Hermione and she thinks Pansy is well, only grieving too.
“Muggle movie.”
“Everything hurts,” she said in a small voice.
“You heard me.” Draco was immensely enjoying the effect his words had had. “I’m going to help him with some potions.”
On the living room table:
You pouting isn’t going to make me guess what the hell you found
Dear Harry,
“You stay here, and get on with Potter. You’ll be fine,” she said with a smile
“No, sorry. I have something to tell you, and I don’t know how you’re going to react,” he said, which immediately made Hermione’s eyebrows relax.
He parks near a lake and gets out of the car. A person is already there waiting for him. I park, too; close, but not enough so they could see me. They talk. I think Yours is a woman. Padma. It’s Padma Patil, his coworker! I can’t believe he’s cheating on me with
“I did. I cast a locking spell.” He moved his head a little, so his mouth was just where he wanted it to be, ready to kiss Harry.
“Nothing, absolutely nothing. Harry’s just an idiot.” He paused. “No, wait. Do you like it? I don’t think I like it anymore.”
“How do you know? That it wasn’t your voice, I mean,” Harry asked, taking his hand again, tightening it, and then letting it go to allow Draco to answer.
Harry: Mrnin
“Do you think it’s safe?” Sarah’s mother asked, hope and worry fighting for her features.
Harry: I called Blaise and Goyle. I need hugs. I could have just called Goyle, but it felt wrong to leave Blaise out.
Draco nodded. He was a lot like his father, in looks and personality, so he hoped this was another thing they had in common, and that talking was all he needed to put his insecurities away.
“Mmm, I think I was around eight,” Lucius answers in that serious voice of his.“I hadn’t done my History homework, so I accidentally burnt it when my tutor asked me to return it. Luckily, my parents were so proud about the magic they forgot that I hadn't done my homework.”
“I shouldn’t have said anything!”
Ron didn’t insist, and Harry kept looking at the rain. Would the sweater stop smelling so good if he wore it often?
“He was the one who broke up with Malfoy,” Harry said. “I don’t know why he insists so much now.”
“She has always been a woman, silly!” Lily points out with a glare that makes Draco’s insides warm.
“Are you blushing?”
Harry’s mouth took the tip of his cock, and then little by little he took more. It felt incredibly delightful. Harry’s tongue played around his cock, and Draco thought he would come then and there. He moaned. Harry took a bit more and began moving. In no time, Draco felt really close to his orgasm.
His hand touched it, and Harry let out a soft moan. Draco wriggled, pushing Harry to the bed and making himself comfortable on top so he could touch him better. His fingers wrapped around his balls, carefully, and then he kissed the tip of his cock, making Harry moan again. Precome wetted Draco’s lips.
“Because apparently Cassiopeia sounds like the name of an eighty year old,” Draco said, kicking Harry again, and receiving a soft slap on one of his feet.
“We can have one tomorrow if you want.”
When Draco finished telling her about his living arrangements, Radwah began a two-hour story about how Draco and his secret roommate will fall in love in the most ridiculous of ways.
11:38 pm
did something happen?
“It only hurt a bit!” she exclaimed.
“Dee?” Michael ignored her. “It’s important. You haven’t answered my letters, and we need to talk about your boyfriend.”
Draco closed his eyes for a second and let himself feel the warmth of the hug. It was nice having Harry comforting him. He missed his friends a lot, and he couldn’t help that part of him agreed with Gregory about who was to blame for Vincent’s death. He wriggled a bit so he could face Harry to talk to him, and Harry let go of the hug, although he was still very close to Draco.
Harry nodded. That was exactly how he felt too. He hoped that soon enough they could be as friendly as they were in the notes.
The next week didn’t go fast enough for Draco. He couldn’t focus on his work enough, and even Radwah had to call him out a few times. He was too impatient for Saturday.
Harry: I went with Ron, Hermione, and the unborn baby that is not my godchild to an Indian restaurant.
Draco took a deep breath and turned to look at him.
“So what do you say?” Draco signed, a bit angry that his friend was so reluctant to believe what seemed like something evident to Draco.
“Mr. Robinson is very nice, you know.”
He looked at Scorpius. The boy had tears on his face too, and looked at the name on the tombstone as if he were trying to learn it by heart. Harry hugged him with one arm. It wasn’t fair.
Harry: I love you
“Good,” Draco says, trying to ignore the hopefulness that is making itself comfortable in her chest. “Are you sure this drink isn’t poison or that you aren’t dying? You don't sound like my father.”
“That’s because you’re a sap, and Potter’s an idiot,” Draco said.
On the bed:
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, Potter, but I’m mute,” Draco signed, smirking at Harry and raising his eyebrows. Harry rolled his eyes.
Angrily, he made a mess with the sheets and blankets. They ended on the floor. Soon enough, the pillows followed. He got up, and made an effort to not look at the picture on his bedside table.
“Whatever. What were you talking about then?”
“Fuckers,” Pansy said a bit too loudly, which earned her another glare and a throat clearing from Pince.
On Draco’s bedside table:
10:23 am
“Hey!” Harry greeted him. “My saviour!”
“I’m an idiot,” Draco whispered. “I don’t know how I could fall in love with him.”
Woah! Are you supposed to speak like that in the baby guard??
“I’m sorry, Draco,” he says when he comes back. “Ron called me, and I have to go back to the shop. I won’t be late.”
“And that’s supposed to make it better? You’re going to share your house, and your bed, with a total stranger and plan to keep it like that?” Ron shook his head in bewilderment, and said goodbye with a hand gesture before Disapparating.
A field
Harry: Good bye, Draco. I love you.
Draco looked at her with his eyebrows raised, and shook his head.
Draco’s heart was beating so fast and loudly he thought it was a miracle that Harry and his friends didn’t hear it. Harry wished he was his soulmate? He breathed deeply a few times trying to calm himself, and then kept listening. A few minutes later he returned to his table.
“We have never seen something like this before! The Gryffindors don’t let the Eighth Years catch the quaffle, they seem resoluted to score!” The commentator’s voice said.
They didn’t hear screams this time, only a soft whimper. The night seemed to last forever, until finally another soft whimper made them listen with attention. When they entered Sarah’s room, they found her sitting and smiling, although she looked tired.
“I’ll answer!” Ron said.
“Okay. So no Greg or Vincent. Do you think my mother would work? What about when I came out to her and she hugged me?” He asked. It was one of his happiest moments with his mother. It had happened the summer before his Fifth Year, and he was so nervous, so sure she was going to reject him… However, she had hugged him and had to promise him a hundred times that it was fine, because Draco couldn’t believe what she was saying.
He’s sad; he looks so scared! I take his hand in mine, reassuring him. He has to know that I won’t leave him alone with this.
“Lay the table, please.” He hated that chore. It made him feel like he was going to make a mistake, and put out cutlery for three instead of just for two. He supposed that putting that task on a child wasn’t fair either. “We’ll talk about it, okay?”
9:30 pm
“I didn’t think that.” Draco smiled. “I was just curious. So… all the rent I’ve paid is going to come to me again when — and notice I said
Harry: नमस्ते!
Harry: Ron and Hermione are here and they're cooking dinner in my kitchen. I don't want to know the disaster they're making.
Harry: Ron came this morning for our training session, but I told him to fuck off. I know! I have to apologise and be nicer to him. And I know you can't believe you said that about Weasley.
“Idiot.” Harry smiled briefly, and then his expression went back to the worried one he’d had since Draco had asked. “Just a bit more time.”
And he was nervous. He went inside the café looking around like someone was after him. He sat near the window and kept looking outside, at the building across the street, I think. I saw him leaving the building before he came to our café, but I hadn’t seen him before. He was really nervous the whole time he was in the café; I thought he was going to pour the coffee all over himself. He didn’t drink much, anyway. He smiled to himself from time to time. I thought he was insane or something, you know? After a while he got up and left, leaving a generous tip. That’s all I remember.
Also, I noticed that I haven't added some tags before! I'm a mess at tagging, but I think I covered the main triggers. I'll add some more if I remember them (and if you think I should tag something else, please, let me know!).
“I’m sorry, Draco.”
“You don’t have to pay me. And you could work in the muggle world or something.”
“Can I sit down?” A voice asked. Harry.
I go to a cafeteria that’s just down the street and sit on a table near the window. That way, I can spy on Parvati. A waiter with a bushy mustache asks me what I want with a funny look.
“You're gorgeous,” Harry whispered.
“And if he says no?” Harry asked, as it was the only reason he hadn’t said anything to Draco.
During the Potions class and all the ones he shared with Harry that day, he could feel his eyes on him. Harry liked mysteries and right now, with no Dark Lords around, Draco was the biggest mystery out there. However, Draco couldn’t let him know. He couldn’t do that to Harry, as much as he wanted to put out all his rage on him.
Harry: I'm making dinner. Pasta with meatballs, like the one they ate in
A house
“Then see if they taught you this,” he signed and cast a stinging hex Blaise’s way, who dodged it by a few centimetres.
“Yes.” I tighten the grasp on his hand. “What did you do with the body?” I ask softly.
And the last chapter is here!
“I’m offended that you don’t trust me for that, you know,” Draco said, walking towards the front door.
Harry: Today, I’m taking Leo and Cassie out to the park. It’s cold, but sunny, so the perfect day to be outside playing with a puppy or swimming in a lake if you’re a duck, right?
“Of course, love.”
“Where is he?” the man asked in a strong voice, taking a step forward and invading Harry's personal space.
“I like James. I have an enemies relationship with Potter,” he said, and let his body drop to the floor with his back against the wall.
“And you still don’t know who James is?” Radwah asked from the next table.
“Do we go to bed then?” Harry asked, and Draco saw how his eyes darkened with lust. With any luck, they were thinking about the same thing.
Draco took his hand and dragged him to the bedroom, where before either of them could change their minds, he closed the gap that separated them and kissed him. Harry kissed him back, wrapping his arms around Draco’s body. When they pulled apart to breathe, Draco smiled, and Harry looked at him like he was the most beautiful person he had ever seen. Something warm expanded in Draco’s chest.
“It’s not my fault you’re a greedy git that took like all the subjects,” Blaise said, scratching something on his parchment with anger.
5:24 pm
He spent the rest of the day reading on the sofa, which was very comfortable, and buying the groceries he’d need for the rest of the week. He only cried once for Michael.
“They’re rats!” he half-screamed, interrupted by a burst of laughter. “Just fancy rats!”
“I haven’t got a soulmate. That happens, you know it as well as I do.” He signed. “Harry’s mine, but I’m not his, and that’s fine. I’ll just…” He made a noncommittal gesture with his hand.
Harry: Draco! This was amazing! We ran in the park and then sat on a bench looking at the ducks! They were so cute!
“Do you know what I was thinking when I was left abandoned downstairs?”
But Yours? Yours is different.
“Yes, you are,” Draco answered. “How do you think he knows I live here?”
“Oh, Merlin! I’m so sorry, Harry. But listen to me, it’s alright. We were at home that night, okay? You and me. Watching one of your muggle movies.”
“I thought… I thought he hadn’t realised it was me… That maybe his dreams were empty.” He pressed his forehead to Pansy’s shoulder, and she began to stroke his hair.
On the kitchen table:
“About Harry,” Draco admitted.
“I’ll see you later.”
“He’s the best. Otherwise, I wouldn’t give my favourite patient his beverages, would I?”
“Hermione, I think our dear ickle Harry is developing a crush on his bedmate.”
The next morning, Draco felt like he did the day after he overheard Harry saying he had dreamt with his soulmate’s voice for the first time. The hopes and happiness that had calmed his troubled mind in some moments had been wiped by his friends’s words. They were right, and now Draco didn’t have any doubt about it. As Pansy had told him, he should forget about Harry. However, it was really difficult to forget about him.
Dear Harry,
“Good evening, Sarah,” he said, smiling. Her second full moon would be that night. Her parents had chosen for her to spend the night at the hospital, as she would be better cared off than at home, and Harry was very happy about it. “How are you?”
After some small talk, he left the room to visit his next patient. It would be easy to help Sarah and others like her. If only they had the money to buy the potions they use in other countries.
Harry stared at him. Had he heard right? He was Draco’s Hogwarts crush? He opened his mouth to say something else, although he didn’t have any idea of what, when a voice in the living room interrupted his intentions.
1:09 am
“I don’t know. Try it,” Harry said with a smile.
“What the fuck, Malfoy!?” Weasley, the captain of the new inter house quidditch team, screamed.
“They acted more relaxed when it was just the three of us,” Draco said, counting the Muggle money he had brought and waiting in the line behind a group of tourists.
“And don’t you forget that!” Harry said, still perched on Draco’s stomach. He smiled and bent down to peck Draco’s nose.
Harry: I let her live.
Harry: I’m home again. This is so depressing without you, Draco, at least I have Cassie and Leo. They looked very cute with the Christmas jumpers Molly knitted for them.
“Are you happy here?”
Harry: Yes, I’m aware of my lack of punctuation and my excessive use of the conjunction “and”, thank you very much.
8:18 pm
“I’m your best friend.”
“Have you decided on a name already,” his father asked instead, finally putting away the newspaper he had been reading since he and Narcissa arrived, “or are you going to keep calling her
He stopped running suddenly when he was close enough, took some deep breaths, and entered the classroom.
“They’re cute! Rats, he says!” Draco saw it as soon as the thought formed in Harry’s mind, because his eyes shone with mischief. And sure enough, a second after Harry jumped over Draco, sitting on his belly, and began to tickle him mercilessly. “Take back your words!” Draco laughed and squirmed, trying to free himself, although he couldn’t move under Harry’s weight. “Say they’re cute!”
Pansy stood too, and hugged him.
“Because now I know who he is!” Draco glared at his friend. “I can’t forget that I’m sharing a flat with Harry fucking Potter.”
Draco thought the flat needed some changes. It was nice, but James, his roommate, was really messy and didn’t have a taste for decoration at all. He arranged his ten cushions on the bed in an aesthetic way and carefully folded his cashmere blue blanket, placing it at the foot of the bed. Now it felt like home.
“I do. Now make yourself comfortable. We’ll be outside,” Harry said, and left to the corridor bench, where Sarah's parents joined him a minute after.
“Yes. He said so in one, and I told him I’m me in another. It felt like the right thing to do. But… do you think this is too weird?” Harry bit his bottom lip and looked at his friends.
Draco smiled a bit. It felt nice hearing all the things Harry thought of him, even if it was a bit difficult to believe.
Easy there, supermarket’s expert
“You’ll tell us if he’s a weirdo, won’t you?” Ron said, getting up too and straightening his Auror robes.
“No, it’s fine. Although you can eat the clams, I don’t like them.” He picked them with his fork and put them on Draco’s dish. It was beyond him how anyone could like such food.
“Are you okay? I saw you didn’t eat at breakfast and you left the Great Hall early.”
“A little, thank you. I can’t wait for the little monster to get out already. She’s a pain in the arse just like Harry.”
The doorbell woke Harry up. Drinking coffee before going to sleep had been a novice mistake, so he had had problems falling asleep, which was why he was in such a bad mood when the insistent noise woke him up.
“Us who are pretty get to do that. I’m so sorry for the likes like you,” she smirks back.
Draco cursed under his breath and guided her to their bedroom. It was weird thinking about Harry Potter sleeping in the same bed as him. It was easier when he thought of him as James.
Harry: Okay. I know you don't care about Luna, but you do about our Leo. He whined A LOT. It's surprising how he behaves so like you without having met you. I gave him a dog biscuit afterwards and he's happy again.
Yours,
Harry tried to close the door, but the other man took another step, standing now just in the entrance.
Harry: YOU WON’T BELIEVE THIS! HERMIONE IS PREGNANT AGAIN!!
He got up to fix the mess at the same time that the doorbell rang.
“Who would have thought,” Draco said. Harry looked at him and saw that a small smile played in the corners of his mouth. “My crush thinks I’m pretty.” He blushed too, and turned his face to the window.
“You should be familiar with my handwriting by now.”
“Thanks,” Harry said once he had swallowed. “Not only for the chocolates, although they’re amazing, but for saving me.” He looked curious at Draco, and blushed. Then picked another chocolate.
“How does it sound like? Anyone you know?” he signed, and for the first time it occurred to him that Harry might know who the beautiful voice he had been hearing in his dreams belonged to. Suddenly his stomach felt very heavy and empty at the same time.
“What?” Greg asked. “I’m not understanding anything.”
“I don’t want to go back to Hogwarts,” Scorpius said on the second day while Harry was making dinner.
After a week of his melancholic state, his friends stopped trying to cheer him up, although he could feel Harry’s worried eyes on him at all times.
“Harry…” His heart was beating wildly.
He went to the lake, and sat in the grass. It always calmed him down, the water movements, and the occasional tentacle that reached for some distracted birds.
“No.” A smile curved Harry’s mouth upwards. “But you know what I mean. And Pansy… Aren’t you afraid of forgetting about him? Sometimes I can’t remember the things he liked or the things he’d say.”
10:34 pm
“Michael. He comes here a lot and asks me things about you. I’m tired of fixing your relationship, Malfoy. Merlin knows why I bother.”
The day of the final match, the Inter-house team was gathered in the locker room listening to Weasley’s speech.
“Draco?” She smiled, and looked at him with puppy eyes.
“They won’t. We’re safe. We were at home that night. Together. Now we just have to fake in front of everyone. None will know anything.”
“Dee. I want to talk to you,” he said, standing just in front of Draco, serious. Draco swallowed. He didn't need this right now.
He took them off, and Harry did the same, hurriedly, without taking their eyes off each other. Draco was sure that the other man would disappear if he stopped looking at him.
. His cheeks were burning. He could have said anything else, literally anything else, but he had to say that.
“I have no idea, Draco.” Harry’s expression was sadder now, and Draco felt the urge to hug him, so he would be happy and excited again. However, he refrained. “I wish it— I supposed I’ll find out someday, right? We all can’t find ours here at Hogwarts. You haven’t told me who’s yours either.”
“Delicious,” he answered with his mouth full.
“He’s shagging you now? First the redhead, and now this one. Draco?” the man screamed, looking at the interior of the flat, and Harry realised that this must be Michael. “Come here! We need to talk!”
“They’re like rats,” Draco said, side eying Harry to see the annoyed expression he was sure would appear on his face. He smirked when Harry frowned.
They prepared the table while Hermione talked about some Ministry gossip, and Harry thought that he should tell his friends about what he had learned about his flatmate in the last days.
“Do you want to move to that old, mouldy, cheap flat we visited in Knockturn Alley, or with that man that looked like he hadn’t taken a shower since 1960?”
“Of course it wasn’t!” Draco snapped and regretted it instantly. He shouldn’t make it so easy for him to guess.
Harry: What the hell was that?? Just… what the fuck is wrong with Pansy??
“I asked her. And she’d have told me the truth.” Lucius looked at him, and Draco felt like his father’s eyes were trying to read his mind, although he knew he wasn’t good enough at Legeremancy for that. “Are we talking about Narcissa and me or about someone else?”
11:37 pm
On the other hand —and now that his friends had pointed out all the failures his dreams had he allowed himself to think about it for the first time since the thought crossed his mind weeks ago—, it was Harry Potter. It had been very arrogant of him to think that he of all people would get a happy ending with his soulmate. Harry deserved someone better, someone that wasn’t a Death Eater, someone that hadn’t torture innocents, someone that hadn’t been very close to become a murderer. It was fair, he thought, that he got Harry as his soulmate, but Harry got someone else, probably someone wonderful, brave, and kind. It was poetic justice.
“That gentleman you’re in love with! I knitted him a scarf too. Navy blue.” She picked her wand up and made a soft, blue scarf fly from the cupboard to her lap. “Here.”
7:45 pm
“I don’t understand why it doesn’t change for me. It’s always that song. Every night. I’m going mental!” Harry whispered, and Draco imagined that he was furrowing his brow in that adorable way he always did when he was frustrated with something.
He shook the hand away, and ran to the back room. Michael wouldn’t like that, but in that moment, Draco couldn’t do anything else.
Draco had pressed himself to the wall so Harry, Weasley, and Granger couldn’t see him while he listened to their conversation. When he couldn’t handle it anymore, he ran to the Eighth years common room, where he found Pansy and dragged her to his bedroom. Luckily, none of his roommates were there.
Draco swallowed, and forced himself to smile again. He should be happy that his soulmate had a soulmate, right? It was the kind of thing he should be happy about, although it wasn’t him. Was he getting too depressing, thinking always about the same thing?
“Just weird. He has a lot of clothes and was a Slytherin, by the way — he made sure I saw his old scarf — and yesterday when I came home, I found flowers everywhere!” Harry said, before eating a good piece of his lasagna.
“You weren’t, Draco,” Greg said in a quiet voice. “I have known you since we were three, and I only had seen you that anxious during the war.”
“I’m trying to look over my essay, can you shut up for a second?” He signed a bit too fast for Harry, and he was glad to see how he furrowed his brow while he tried to decipher Draco’s signs.
I try not to look too proud at my own acting. My voice even broke a bit! I’m really good at this!
“No doubt.”
7:28 pm
“We’ve already ordered,” Pansy said as a greeting, and pointed to the beers and chips in front of them.
2:54 pm
4:15 pm
“That’s amazing, sweetheart!” Narcissa says, engulfing Lily in a tight hug.
“I’ll go to the bar and order something for us. What do you want, Draco?” Radwah asked.
“I’m not telling you.”
“So what’s your plan? Stay here all day, not seeing anyone, feeling sorry for yourself?” Ron asked.
Harry: Hermione says I should have listened to Robards. Astoria says I should have listened to Robards (and gave me a little chocolate cake she baked). Robards says I should have listened to him. Cassie says
Draco gave him the finger.
A beach?
On top of the last notes:
They fell silent after that, and Draco thought that there was something strange there: in the fact that he and his soulmate had recurrent dreams. Was their soulmate magic trying to tell them both something? His heart jumped in distress. Was Harry in danger? Was that why his dreams show him falling or was it because of something else? Maybe it was a way of telling him that once Harry met his soulmate, he’d drop off of Draco’s life. That thought alone was close to bring him to tears, but he refrained. He couldn’t cry in front of Harry.
“I was. It was just that one time. Way better than you, if I remember correctly.” Draco gasps feigning offense, and Lucius raises an eyebrow at her. At seeing Lily’s eager face to know more, he looks at her and continues. “Your dad always forgot to do the Writing homework. Narcissa and I had to bribe him with sweets so he did it.”
Scorpius needed breakfast.
He went straight to the back room without even looking at Martin. An idiot like that one wasn’t going to ruin his good mood. However, the idiot in question seemed eager to have the last word.
“I dreamt with Harry again, but it was different,” he signed slowly. “He said we couldn’t be together and jumped off the Astronomy Tower. What do you think it means?” His fingers trembled a little, and he stumbled over the signs.
He left the note on the desk, as he used to, although this time, he wouldn’t find a note on his desk in answer.
She left, and Draco buried himself in his blankets.
“I’d go nuts looking for something!” she said as she cleaned the table and readied it for the next brewing.
“Fine. Okay. You’re right. I’ll let him know that I’m okay with him being Potter,” Draco muttered, still unconvinced that he was making the right decision.
, when he heard them. He was sure they couldn’t see him, so he approached a bit more to the end of the corridor and listened.
“Fuck! The trousers!” Draco said.
“My dear flatmate was taking a shower, and I saw him. Radwah, it was glorious. It wiped last night out of my mind.”
“Don’t worry. Go.”
Harry: I asked her why she hasn't asked Ginny out yet, and her answer was that she's shy. Pansy. Parkinson. Is. Shy.
“Merlin, Draco!”
2.- They’re business partners. Harry’s and Michael’s shop is a successful business. They have opened shops in other countries, that’s why Harry is going to Spain now. A good marriage doesn’t need the spouses to tell everything to each other. I know that because of my parents. I don’t tell him everything, and he keeps his secrets too, especially the ones related to his job. That’s why he hasn’t told me about Parvati being one of his business partners too. It isn’t necessary for our marriage that I know that boring information. And the hand holding? See possibility 1.
He looks at me like he doesn’t understand what I’m saying, but then he nods.
Draco opened his mouth to protest. He had thought all that too, but somehow hearing Pansy and Greg saying it made it sound a thousand times worse.
“So they hex me on the spot? Of course! How fun!”
“Do you want to go to bed, hun?” Harry asked. “Maybe you’ll be better there.”
It’s important to keep up appearances. Harry is nervous all the time, he refused to go to the Burrow yesterday, and has stopped going running. I had to force him to go today. People have to see us as always. We’re the same as everything; we’re not two killers, but Harry and Draco Potter-Malfoy.
“And what do you suggest I do then?” he asks, an eyebrow raised.
Yours,
“Just a few seconds until the street stops moving,” Harry said. “I don’t like Apparition. Brooms are better.”
I park and get out. I could go inside the hotel. Surprise them in their room. I discard that idea. Too dangerous. I go into the parking deck instead. I see the car. I think. It isn’t the best idea, but it is something. I slash one of his tyres. Then, I wait hidden behind the car. He won’t see me when he comes back.
“I like to think that too. Sometimes I think he’s watching us so we behave, and so I don’t feed you too many sweets or let you go out with just a T-shirt in winter,” Harry said. Raising Scorpius alone was one of the things that scared him the most. What if he fucked up Draco’s child? Draco would come back from the dead to kill him.
“You’re a bit obsessed with the beach, aren’t you?” Harry snorted.
He felt so different from the last full moon. The worries he had this month were full of hope too. And pride, as he was very happy that it was Draco who brewed the potion. Smiling, he entered Mrs. Williams' room.
“Hey! I’ll stop the massage again if you keep insulting me and my daughter!”
“I told you so.”
“Kind of cute? Draco!” She let out a suffering sigh, her way of telling Draco that he needed to tell her absolutely everything.
“Yes, don’t worry. It was some shitty thing at work. It took us hours. I’m sorry I couldn’t be back sooner.”
He walked from the door to the armchair where Greg was sitting and back. His nervousness didn’t let him be still.
Draco snorted, and kept eating. He had missed this place. It felt good to be back, if only for a few hours, and revive the memories of all those past holidays in the summer house. However, being there with Harry added a new exciting memory.
“Ugh! You are the worst! I’m going to sleep!” Daphne said, as she put all her things in her bag and stomped to the girls’s bedrooms.
This time Harry didn’t wait outside or knock, he just went in. He said a loud ‘hello’ to let Draco know he was there, and just a minute later, he was staring at a beautiful Draco. He had his hair in that casual messy way Harry liked so much, and was wearing black trousers and a silky shirt that showed his forearms. Bright grey eyes filled with excitement stared back at him. Suddenly, he felt very shy and very brave at the same time.
Harry: Of course it was Luna Lovegood!
— I brew this potion?” He raised an eyebrow in what Harry thought was a very Malfoy-ish way. That gesture made him feel more comfortable. An arrogant Draco, he knew how to deal with.
“So then how do you know he doesn’t like you or that he thinks it’s complicated too? Talking is key, dear. My Sybille and I always talked about everything, and we were very happy together.”
“No idea,” Draco answered. “He doesn’t have pictures in the house, and I’m not going to look in his private things either!”
Draco laughed. Harry pulled apart, and Draco, still laughing and still feeling the warmth of Harry’s body, tried again. And this time, although the patronus wasn’t corporeal, it was close enough.
“I thought you had seen it before, that time in the bathroom. I can hide it if you want or —” Draco bit his lip. He looked a bit tiny too, like that time when Michael had almost barged into their flat. Years ago Harry would have said something nasty, but now that he knew Draco, he only wanted to hug him and reassure him that all was well.
He knew accepting had been a bad idea. But the night before he had been too tired to think properly, and after such a good day with Draco, he hadn’t wanted to go back alone to Ron and Hermione’s house. It had felt nice, going to bed next to someone. He smiled, remembering how Draco had warned him that he was a hugger in his sleep. Now Harry knew how true that was, as Draco’s arm tightened a bit more around his chest. He picked it up carefully and left it on the bed. He was free, although it didn’t make him feel better.
“...Malfoy catches the quaffle, throws it and... GOAL OF THE EIGHTH YEAR TEAM!”
“I work at night, so my flat is empty that whole time. It’s not that crazy!” Harry insisted.
“Malfoy.” Harry smiled back.
The two of them go down, but somehow it feels different now. She knows it isn’t much and that her father should have tried harder since the beginning, but it’s so strange for him to apologize that Draco wants to believe him this time.
“What bothers me is not having anyone to talk to anymore.”
“It’s very weird,” Harry finally said.
“Harry, they found Padma’s body yesterday. They know she was murdered. But, listen, I have everything figured out. You don’t love Parvati, right?”
Harry: Do you think I should go back to work?
On the living room table, on top of a small pile of books:
“And you were worried about me?” Draco let out a dry laugh. “Michael let you think you were so special, didn’t he?” he went on with cruelty. “He made you feel all important and big, sharing his secrets, and spying on me. He doesn’t care about you, Martin. He’s a manipulative bastard, and you’re a traitor for telling him those things about me.”
He had finished eating and pushed his dish a bit towards Harry to have space to move his hands. It was then when Harry saw it. The Dark Mark. Harry knew it was there, of course, but had forgotten about it. The other few times he had seen Draco, he hadn’t noticed, as he had been more interested in other parts of his anatomy or Draco had worn long sleeves. But now that he saw it, he couldn’t take his eyes off it. It stood out on Draco’s pale skin.
“What if he doesn’t want to talk to you?” Pansy asked in a glacial tone.
“Knew it.”
Draco nodded. He too looked at Harry as if it was the first time. He looked at the bright, green eyes that he had always found so beautiful; at the full lips that were smiling so kindly at him; at the tanned skin with two moles near the nose… Was it that easy? All the waiting, all the crying, the shattered hopes and dreams, and they have been soulmates all along? Happy endings seemed too unreal for Draco, but it made sense. His dreams finally made sense too.
Draco sighs again, lifts his feet from the floor and sits cross-legged on the bed. Harry sits up too.
“It wasn’t that bad!” Draco protested, but nobody paid attention to him.
“I’m not telling you that!” he said in a voice that sounded too high-pitched even for his own ears.
Sally. Yeah. We don't like her.
“Idiot. I hope your risotto tastes like shit.” He pouted.
Harry left Mr. Robinson’s room with a grimace. The old man was as unpleasant as ever. He shook his head and went to the next room, where Sarah was.
“If there’s no difference, then why are you so eager that I tell them now?”Harry’s looked at him, eyes flashing with anger, and just a second before he said it, Draco knew what was coming. “If you can’t wait, maybe we should break up.”
He got up, tired, and stretched.
“A tiny room is more like it.”
“You can talk, you know.” Draco said. “I can do more than one thing at the same time.”
. This smells so good! Do you want some?
“Because they’re horrible!” Harry said. “I’m not naming my child Ruth or Ursula, like the octopus witch in
“You usually storm inside and throw yourself on the couch while prattling nonstop,” his father smirked. “Are you alright?”
“Did you come here with your parents too? It’s hard to think of them eating in a place like this one,” Harry said, looking around.
“You can drink water. Why are you always so difficult? Besides, don’t you want to see Greg?” he smirked at her.
“Try it on, dear,” she said with a bright smile. “I think green looks good in you. Because of your eyes, you know.”
“Well, there’s only one bed in our flat, isn’t there? We’ll have to share it if we don’t want to disturb Ron and Hermione.” Harry’s heart was beating very fast. This hadn’t been his intention at all when he praised Draco, but now… Now it was all he could think about. And he wanted it badly.
“It doesn’t even taste disgusting. Are you sure this will work?”
“Perfect. Do you sleep on his side to let your dark, kinky imagination fly?”
“Are you… Are you scared sometimes that Mother secretly hates you? Because of the war and all that?” he whispered, looking at the liquid in his glass.
“It’s alright. And I get that. Pansy and Greg are the same. Good night then, Potter.” Draco smirked.
“What if I tell them and they don’t like it?” Harry asked, fully calmed again.
“You’re gorgeous, Potter,” he whispered, looking at Harry’s hard cock.
Harry: I wanted to tell you something that happened last night, but I couldn't remember what it was and still can't.
“Yeah, they can’t come back for another four years, and, honestly, I don’t think they will. They have their life there now.”
“Yes, I’m free. That’ll be great. Do we meet here?” Harry asked, stretching. He was bloody tired.
I finally calmed down enough to be a bit more objective. There are four possibilities:
Harry: Maybe I'm too weak for this. Do you think I'm weak? I destroyed Dumbledore's office after Sirius died…
“I don’t have ten inches of information about protective charms!” Pansy hissed back. “He’ll have to be happy with this. Unless…!” She looked brightly at Draco and Blaise that were working on the other side of the table.
“Language!”
! I’m so excited! There’s a lot of people outside the bookshop waiting for it. I hope they have enough books because I need mine!
Draco has to fight a smile, and she sees how Harry and Narcissa do the same thing. Or well, Narcissa does. Harry is openly smiling.
“When did you do magic for the first time, Dad?”
Harry: We played Monopoly too, and I'm happy to tell you that your husband is the rich proprietor of Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley, and Knockturn Alley! I also own hotels in all of those places, but I don't know if you could afford a stay there! Sorry, hun.
“You don’t have a spare bed for me, and I refuse to sleep on your couch. It’s lumpy.” Draco opened the wardrobe and looked inside. He doubted it was big enough for all his clothes, but he hoped his new roommate wouldn’t mind sharing a bit of his space. “And I’m not going back to Michael’s flat.”
He sat on the cold floor outside the Potions classroom, and put out the essay he had to turn in that day about poisons. He was sure he had made a mistake somewhere and the wording seemed weird in the last paragraph, but he couldn’t focus enough to know what was wrong with it.
Harry: But she doesn’t know about that time Pansy woke you up at 5am because they were opening that clothing shop in London, and you hexed her.
Harry: This would be the perfect time for you to text back.
“I’m sure too,” Harry said, taking it off and folding it carefully. He looked at the scarf and thought about the woman’s words. He felt how his smile faltered.
He raised his gaze from the pans, but lowered it almost instantly again. It was difficult to look at Scorpius. Harry focused on the food.
“At Venezia’s? We’re going to have dinner at Venezia’s? Did you tell them you’re the famous Harry Potter to get a table? It’s fucking hard to get one there!” Draco looked very excited, and Harry had a sudden urge to kiss him, although he refrained.
Harry: She doesn’t approve of my plan of adopting a duck, by the way, but I’m not listening to a woman who thinks it's a good idea to get up at 7am on the weekend.
“That’s worse.”
“Sorry, I thought you were ready.” Draco looked at him. He certainly didn’t look well. “Er… Do you need anything?”
Harry: I cleaned the whole house, and found an old photo album. Do you want to look at it with me?
“You can’t ask things like that, Parkinson!” He walked around the table and dropped next to Radwah on the sofa. “Any ideas of how I can face this?”
“How do I look?”
Harry: The Burrow is so full of people, I’m sleeping in the living room with Charlie. I think they put us together because we’re both asexual and alone, so Molly was sure we weren’t going to do anything inappropriate in her house, unlike two certain girls I know.
“I’ll be in the bedroom!”
“I saw you with Parvati at the portkey station.”
“I don’t want to break up,” he whispered, looking at Harry. He saw how his eyes lost some of their ferocity.
“What happened?” Pansy asked, as she took a seat on Draco’s bed.
Harry: IT WAS AMAZING!!
“Can I ask you something I’ve been wondering since I learned you were my flatmate?” Draco asked suddenly.
“Fine, are you going alone?”
Harry: My plan is brilliant, isn’t it? ISN’T IT? DRACO!?
Draco laughed.
Harry looks hesitantly at me; he’s always been too good, too noble for this world. But he must understand that Yours doesn't deserve that sympathy, she’s our perfect scapegoat. After some persuasion on my part, he finally agrees to go to the Auror’s office tomorrow before work. We go to bed together, and I fall asleep with a smile on my lips.
He noticed how his eyes filled with tears. He missed Michael, but he had decided to not go back to him, and he should stick to his decision. Not that he could change his mind anyway, as the same day Michael had broken up with him, he had told Draco that he was dating someone else. It had been two weeks ago, and it hurt as much as that day.
“Can you eat those pork chops at the other side of the table?” Hermione asked as soon as she saw him. “The smell is making me sick. It’s too early for food.”
“What?” Harry asks, surprised. “You told me you did magic when you were just a baby, you bastard.”
Harry: Don't tell this to anyone but I'm going to kill Sally.
Harry: Cassie is swimming and Leo is running around. They're so cute! I wish you could see them! You'd love them.
8:58 pm
He nodded, and got up. He had to finish his homework too, but that wasn't his priority. If Pansy asked, he would say he needed to find some information for some subject that  she didn’t take, like Ancient Runes.
“Yes, the first time they always stay, then they go home.”
5:34 pm
Draco snorts. She wanders to the windows and looks to the gardens. Harry, Lily and Scorpius are playing tag while Narcissa takes pictures.
. The walls were a soft cyan blue, and the furniture was a weird but nice mix, from a modern sofa to an old looking kitchen that was hidden from the living room by a wall.
The only interesting thing that happened that week besides his nervousness was that he began his sessions with a Mind Healer. They were going better than he had expected, although more often than not he ended up crying.
“I think a Mind Healer is a good idea,” Greg said. “They’ll help you better than us.”
“You’re late, Malfoy,” Martin said as soon as he opened the front door.
“I heard, but I see you have it back.” Harry read the notes on her bedside table. “They’re pretty sure it’ll stay this time.”
“...”
Harry: Does Pansy like me!?
Draco ignored her.
Draco stares at the wall in front of him for what seems like years to Harry. Finally, he makes himself comfortable in the bed, laying down and letting Harry spoon him.
A cow
Yours,
5:10 pm
“And you haven’t done magic yet, Scorp?” Narcissa asks.
“Draco. What’s wrong? Did I hurt you?” Harry’s voice was full of concern, and Draco, once more, couldn’t understand why.
They ordered their food and had a bit of a discussion when Draco insisted he was paying for their food and Harry refused. Draco won. Then walked down the coast path until they found an entrance to the beach. They sat on the rocks near the sea and began to eat.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Theo signed, “but I agree with Blaise. It’s great that Potter likes you that much, but, as you just told us, he’s dreaming with someone else’s voice. It isn’t possible it’s you.”
“What do you want to talk about then?”
“You don’t even know him!” Greg exclaimed. “The man wants to share his bed with you. Maybe he smells it when he arrives home.”
8:42 pm
Harry smiled against him, and then locked their mouths together. Draco could only abandon himself to the kiss they shared.
“Do you think I should talk to someone about Michael? Like a Mind Healer or something like that? I’ve been thinking about our relationship and how he made me feel, and about what Weasley and Harry say, and… well, what if they’re right? What if it was… abuse?” He said the last word with a grimace. It was a serious accusation, and part of him was still sure it wasn’t that, but it couldn’t be right that his relationship felt like a suffocating place where he couldn’t be himself around Michael.
“There’s not too much we can do now, sorry,” Harry said, wishing he could offer more comfort. “During the full moon, it’ll be better. She won’t feel any pain at all. It’s just the transformation that makes her feel like this, and, sadly, we don’t have anything that can help her now.”
“No, everything’s fine. Just Pansy talking about Williams, a seventh year Slytherin she’s in love with now.” He approached Harry, and took one of his hands. It felt warm, and it brought him a little bit of comfort.
“I think we convinced him, Blaise.” Pansy said with a smirk.
“Yes, of course. I have the notes and the pictures here.” He raises his eyebrows at that. I keep talking. “You can show them to the Aurors. You’ll tell them that Padma sexually harassed you, and that when she discovered your relationship with her sister she got jealous, tried to blackmail you, so she met with Parvati at that lake. They fought and her own sister killed her. Parvati got jealous, too, of your relationship with Padma. It’s the perfect crime for a jealous person. Don’t you think? And we have the evidence! You can forget about all this and then we can be happy again. What do you think, love?”
And neither had Harry. If he wanted to get angry at Dray for not telling him the truth, so could Dray about him. As he had written in the note, technically he hadn’t lied. Technically, James was part of Harry's name too, even if no one knew in his life called him that.
“What!?” Draco looked at him with wide eyes. “And why am I only learning about this now? Merlin! Imagine if you had gone to Slytherin! I think I’d have killed you in your sleep with a pillow or something.”
“Is that true, grandma?” Lily asks. “Mum didn’t do magic until she was way older than me?”
“Thanks. Sometimes it’s hard to believe that you like me.”
Harry: I had a few bad days, like I used to just after… you know.
“I don’t want to go back. I’m happy now,” he said.
“The Gryffindors have a good team, no doubts there, but our team as a whole is way better. They had really good Chasers, but that’s nothing compared to you three,” he said, looking at Daphne, Dean, and Draco. Inwardly, Draco thanked him for including him in spite of how badly he had been playing lately. “Our Seeker is the best one in centuries, and our Beaters are as fierce as mountain trolls!” Draco didn’t think that comparing Pansy to a mountain troll was going to leave Weasley without consequences, but apparently the nerves for the match made Pansy forgive him. “We only has to be careful with—”
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Draco was screaming now, but he didn’t care. “That’s personal information! What gives you the right to tell anyone that, let alone Michael? You’re really as stupid as you look.”
Lucius nods, and they get up. They go to the second floor in silence, and Draco thinks about how different these visits to her parents are from how it used to be when she was a teenager. Then, her father was her favourite person. She told him everything and trusted him to fix every problem she had, even if ‘fixing it’ meant just ranting about it. However, in the last years it's been as if there’s a wall between them. She can’t tell him everything as she isn’t sure he listens to her and not to the child he thinks he has.
“What a pity. Well, favourite patient, I have to go visit Mrs. Williams now.”
“Yes?” he asked.
Harry: Yup. Me. Astoria fixed everything and sent me home. I went to the Burrow and played with all the kids though. I needed some happiness.
Harry: As I was stuck at home with Cassie, I watched a lot of shitty TV shows and I realised that they're liars. The police told a woman that her husband had been killed, and did she break into a thousand pieces and sob uncontrollably? No. She let out two tears (I counted them), and then told the police about how wonderful her husband was. That's bullshit! The healers told me my husband had… the d-word, and it took me A MONTH to feel like a normal person again and to start talking about you!
“You said it was steak!” Harry exclaimed, feeling betrayed.
The team reassured him, and left to the pitch. The roars of the hundreds of students watching the match welcomed them. Draco didn’t feel as excited as other times, but the familiar space and knowing that soon enough he will be flying cheered him up a little. Madam Hooch made the Weasleys shake hands as the two captains, and then they were in the air.
. Couldn’t that be enough? Couldn’t Harry’s wish fulfil the soulmate gap? They liked each other, and they wished to be together. It had to count.
Scorpius shakes his head no shyly and hides behind Draco’s leg. She puts a comforting arm around his shoulders and he seems to relax a little.
Draco opened the door of his father’s studio but didn’t dare to take a tiny step inside until Lucius looked at him, eyebrows raised in surprise.
“Michael,” he greeted him. “What do you want?”
“Merlin! Not you too! You pay for the whole flat, not just the bed!” Harry exclaimed. It really bothered him that people thought he was a weirdo for his flat-sharing idea.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re a brat.”
“But.”
However, his silence was worrying Harry, who bit his lip, and whatever thoughts he was having cast a shadow over his expression.
“Are you nervous?” Pansy asked.
“Are you free next Saturday?” Draco asked. “We can go buy all the ingredients we need in the morning, and then brew some of the potions in the afternoon and on Sunday.”
“Can I kiss you?” Harry’s whisper sounded in Draco’s ear, sending shivers down his spine.
Harry had to agree with her. Many of his coworkers at St Mungo’s were pretty stupid. The problem was not only that the other Healers were bigoted idiots, but that people in the Ministry had been working lately to create laws against werewolves. He sighed inwardly.
“Are you going to tell us what the hell is wrong with you today?” Blaise finally snapped at dinner after Draco made a very petulant remark.
I’m reading an article about autopsies on drowned people —it’s important to be informed— when I hear the main door opening. My heart beats wildly as my first thought is of the Aurors barging in, but when I get up, I see Harry coming inside.
“Blue isn’t a Christmas colour,” Harry added.
“You’re welcome,” Martin said with a smirk.
The October rain fell heavily on the other side of the windows, making it difficult to see the forest that surrounded the house. The three of them were sat on the living room sofas, Ron and Hermione holding their teacups, and Harry staring at the rain.
Harry shrugged, and went back to sitting on the grass. Draco thought that that was a moment as good as any to ask what had been on his mind for the last weeks. After all, it was in moments like that one when he wondered over and over what the hell was Harry doing with someone like him when Harry could have anyone else.
Harry: I miss you so much, Draco.
A hand touched his, tentatively. He grasped it as if his life depended on it, and indeed, that’s what it felt like. Part of him was under the tombstone, but he needed to remember that the owner of the tiny hand he was holding needed him the most now.
Harry: I skdgka
Harry: Draco, how am I going to face today?
When I wake up, Harry isn’t here. I look everywhere but he must have gone to work. I’m too nervous to wait for him to do something. Knowing him, and I know him better than anyone else, he’ll show his nervousness; he’ll look guilty, and he’ll have left a thousand bits of evidence behind for the Aurors to discover.
“Maybe it helped, if you’d remember what the song is about,” Weasley piped up.
Draco: I’m sorry, I’m not Draco. You have the wrong number.
“Auror’s Office, how can I help you?”
“Vega… Yes, I like it.”
Harry:
“I didn’t want to bother you, and you’re already doing five things.” He pointed to the five cauldrons. “But if you don’t mind, I’ll keep my investigation about your Hogwarts crush. What do you think about Seamus?”
“Can we go play outside?” Lily asks when they finish the desserts.
“Spain? Why?”
Harry: The Ginsy thing went pretty well, if the two and a half hours I had to listen to Pansy talk about it are anything to go by. They’re going to meet again, this weekend, and they’ve already kissed. Isn’t that a bit too fast for you? We didn’t kiss on the first date. But I don’t think we’re better, because on our first date, we fought like 4-year-olds and the restaurant staff ordered us to leave.
I park in the street where Harry’s shop is, but far away enough from it so he doesn’t see me. His car is still parked outside, so I know he’s there. I breathe in and out, in and out, trying to calm myself down, trying to forget what I’m about to do. I try to listen to the radio, but it puts me in a bad mood. Michael leaves. I won’t have to wait too long now. A few minutes later, Harry leaves too, closes the door, and goes to his car. I start mine and wait. When he leaves, I follow him.
11:47 pm
“I’ll bring it an hour before moonrise. For now, take this one to ease the pain a bit, okay?” Harry said in a calming voice.
Harry: Ron says if I keep on like this, I’m going to develop an obsession with her as I did with you in 6th year.
Harry and Parvati.
“This. I don’t want to hide anymore, and I want to annoy Pansy with all the things I think about you.”
Harry: I understand better now why she’s your best friend. You two are insufferable.
lately? I’m hot and desirable.”
“I trust my friend and the potions experts at the hospital. I know they’ve been careful with their work,” Harry said.
The little shop looked eerie without Draco’s coworkers there, but he wasn’t going to complain about not having to listen to Martin. He went to the back room, and heard Harry following him.
Sarah’s parents looked at each other and at their daughter, doubt all over their expressions. Harry  retired a bit to give them privacy while they decided, but inwardly he hoped they accepted.
“I’m going to look for another book,” Draco signed, and then looked sternly at Pansy and Theo, “Don’t look at my essay. Blaise, don't let them copy.”
“Fuck off.”
“You haven’t asked him out yet?” She looked intently at him. “Harry, you have to ask him! How are you going to be happy if you don’t?”
“The bathroom and bedroom are over there, in that small corridor,” the caretaker said, pointing to the opening in the middle of the back wall.
1:15 pm
Harry: I'm alive, don't worry! Pansy hasn't killed me yet.
“Sorry!” Harry said. “Didn’t see you were drinking!”
I hope you liked this last chapter as well. It was my first time writing a sex escene, and although I know I still have a lot to learn about how writinh them, I have to say I have FUN writing this one, and thas't what matters, isn't it?
“You’ll have to go back, Scorp. Not now, but next week. On Monday.” He used a spell to turn the meat on the pan, and looked at the potatoes. Cooking was good. Cooking made him forget about things.
“Of course. I’m tired. Good night, Draco.”
Draco laughed and offered him his hand to take.
She took the turquoise potion in one gulp.
“Hello, darlings,” her mother greets as soon as they enter. She and her husband stand up to kiss Draco and her family. “How are you?”
“Draco, darling, if you name my granddaughter that, I’m disowning you.”
“Once the baby is born you can’t,” his mother said, at the same time she flicked her wand casting a nonverbal spell to ease his pains. He sighed in relief. “Better?”
Harry: Introduction to Alcoholism III.
The intelligent thing would have been to throw it into the lake. Water destroys everything. Bodies can be submerged for days under water until they’re too full of gas to reappear on the surface again. Maybe we’re lucky and that won’t happen with Padma’s body. Maybe algae keeps it in the bottom of the lake. Maybe when —if— they find the body, they’ll think the broken neck was an accident.
“It should be just gold, and white,” Scorpius said,  using his best posh voice.
Harry hugged him tighter, wishing not for the first time that it was him under the ground, so Scorpius could have Draco with him.
Harry: See? I can't live without you to tell me when I fuck up. I think I'm broken. Do you think that's possible?
Harry snorted.
On the living room sofa:
Daphne catched the quaffle, and flew to the Gryffindor posts with Draco and Dean close behind.
Harry: Game night! Pictionary again, and I’m not going to show you the awful things Ron drew for me to guess. I think Rose does it better than him, although she’s just a year old. Thank me for this, really, you don’t want to be scarred for life as I am.
“Unique,” Harry snorted. “It’s awful. What do you think of Rose?”
They laughed, and then Thomas left, saying goodbye with a hand gesture. Harry looked around, making sure they were alone, Draco guessed, and asked:
Harry: BUT I hugged Goyle. Merlin, Draco! He's such a nice hugger! He's so big I felt like the entire world was hugging me. It felt so SO comfy there…
Harry: I'm trying to be cheerful. That's what I decided last night while I cried myself to sleep. That this month, I'm going to be happy! And meatballs make me happy.
“Let’s go home, Scorp.”
“That’s idiotic.”
“Harry could fall in love with you, you know? He likes you, you two have been friends since the end of the war. That had happened before. Or you could fall in love with the person that has you as their soulmate,” Pansy said, while she kept stroking his hair. It was their dynamic by then: whoever was feeling down got their hair stroked by the other one.
“But it’s a pretty name, Mother! Father, what do you think?”
I went to the park after that, and the ducks were being cute. I like Feather for a duck's name. What do you think?
“Sorry, I saw you were here alone and came to see what you were doing. I can leave,” Harry said, biting his lip at the end of the sentence.
“I’m sure he’d scream at you and call you a git.”
Draco took his time to shower, and ignored Pansy when she asked him if he wanted her to wait for him. When he finally heard, Susan Bones and Daphne Greengrass had  left the lockers, he went out too.
After he was dressed and went to the kitchen to eat, he realised that he was alone in the flat.
“Well, you’re my super hero now.”
Harry: It’s snowing! Diagon Alley looks like a Christmas card!
“What the fuck, Draco! Of course not!” Harry was frowning again. “You know I’m capable of telling you if I hate you. But I’m with you because I like you, because you’re fun, and nice, and snarky, and pretty, and a lot of other things. You were a prat before. I think we all can agree on that, and you did awful things, and so did I. But that’s the past.”
Harry: EMERGENCY!! FLEA PROBLEM!!
Harry: Cassie is so happy! Leo doesn't like water though.
“I don’t know. Maybe you feel forced to be with me or you’re too kind to break up with me… Don’t you feel disgusted by all the things I’ve done and…?”
“Good morning,” he said, smiling. “Where are we going today? Diagon Alley?”
“You can stay with me. You don’t need to work, you know? I have enough money for both of us,” he says, knowing that his boyfriend isn’t going to accept, but he has to try anyway.
Harry: I knew you were overthinking that and getting worried.
Radwah stuck out her tongue to him.
Harry ignored him.
Harry: However, I missed you a lot, especially at night when I had to go to bed alone and didn’t have anyone to cuddle with, knowing that in the next room Ron and Hermione were doing exactly that (I don’t want to think about what other things they might have been doing).
“Come here, you,” he said, kissing Harry all over his face while his hands worked on the buttons of his shirt. When he finished, he began to kiss Harry’s chest, his scar, the birthmark that looked like a flower, the nipples, the navel. “Fuck, Harry, put this shirt on the floor, I want to see you!”
Harry: You’d love the first chapter because it was just porn between, yes, Alex and Sylvia! Finally, right? I almost jumped when I read who they were having sex with! They’re officially together now! They both had to go to Prague to investigate a murder, and of course our old friend Lord Vicious was there too (I’ve always found the name funny… Lord V..? Rings a bell, right?). So it was fights, sarcasm, and a lot of detective work! Of course, I knew who the murderer was, you idiot! I’m a great Auror. And no, it wasn’t Lord Vicious, it was… drum roll...MANDY! Yes, I was surprised too!
“Well, you’re two people sharing a flat now. It’s normal he wants to put his touch there too,” Hermione said.
The next day, he left early for work as he had to Apparate from London to a small village near the border with Scotland. When he finally arrived at the small potions shop, he was freezing and soaked due to the heavy rain that was falling.
“Yes, Father,” she says, the chance too good to let it go away. “Why were you so worried about Harry’s homework?”
of all people! They look like they’re arguing, but they’re too far away for me to hear what they’re saying. They stand on the edge of a bluff, overlooking the lake.
“You should thank me, Malfoy,” Martin said with his usual spite. “I haven’t told Mr. Smith about you always being late, nor about the constant visits of your boyfriend.”
I go to her bedroom and wonder if Harry had sex with her in that bed. I look at the sheets closely, looking for marks of semen or pubes, but they’re clean. I cast a cleaning spell on them, just in case. In her bedside table, I find more notes like the first one: stupid, sappy messages written in red lipstick and signed with “Yours”. I have to breathe deeply for a few seconds to calm down. This woman was such an idiot! What did Harry see in her? He hates all those cheesy romantic things. I find pictures, too. Of the two of them, naked, kissing, smiling, hugging, cuddling. The pictures and the notes go together in my bag. They can be useful in the future.
“Excellent! Ten points to Hufflepuff.” Professor Arias said. “Now, you know what I’m going to ask of you! Get up in a line and think of your happiest memory. Then say the words
“Hey! I chose that name myself! It’s beautiful!” Draco protested.
Harry: I'm building a pond in the garden for Cassie! Ron was helping me but he kept getting distracted by Rose, so he went full dad mode and was completely useless.
