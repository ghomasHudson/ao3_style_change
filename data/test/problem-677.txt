Florence disguised his shock with a slight cough. “We couldn’t figure out exactly what happened to Draco—but he was knocked unconscious and we couldn’t wake him up. I’m guessing he got jinxed with dark magic as well.” He reached into his robes and produced a silver pocket-watch—turning his head ninety degrees to read the numbers. “I reckon it’s been close to about 3 hours now since me, Eddlson, and the gang brought the two of them in here...”
A feeling akin to burning fire crawled over the sensitive flesh of Harry's chest. He let out a scream, immediately thrashing to get out of reach as his skin continued to cry in excruciating pain. Davies, as though anticipating this, calmly gestured to a few of the larger male nurses. They stepped forwards and caught Harry's arms—effectively pinning him to the bed.
“Ah, damn...” She muttered with a scowl, reopening her purse and relocating several of the gold disks into Blaise’s outstretched hand—which he transferred to his pocket with a triumphant grin.
"Oh, better yet! Give me that black Muggle box thing." Draco took no note of his lover's interjection and continued talking—mischievous excitement heavily laden in his voice.
Hermione gagged and Ron actually choked—bending forwards and pounding on his chest as he coughed and hacked. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and did the best that he could to remain calm in the circumstances that he was put in.
“I had Florence Knightly conduct his training,” Kingsley replied evenly, and Harry’s jaw about came unhinged. “Knightly was more than happy to accept another protege, and had no problems with it being Mr. Malfoy...I also figured it would be a good chance for Knightly to be able to get a good grasp on the both of you to compare and see if you’d make compatible partners...He came to me the other day with the proposition of making you two both full-fledged Aurors, as well as to immediately instate you as partners.”
"Urg...Knightly...Kingsley?" Harry blinked to focus his eyes, taking in the figures hovering over him. He looked around the room next, catching sight of Healer Davies. "What happened? Am I...at St. Mungo's?"
Draco hesitated for a moment—still looking like he wanted to put up a fight—but eventually relented with a nod and leaned forwards to place a chaste, apologetic kiss on the dark haired wizard’s lips.
Ron and Hermione exchanged frowns and followed Harry into the kitchen, where a table had already been set for four.
The two figures magically floated upwards, and Harry maneuvered them sit onto the couch before releasing the spell.
Draco was still furiously muttering healing spells, not daring to stop for fear that Harry would lose too much blood, so the spell hit them both dead on. With that, the snatcher finally disapparated—leaving the forest in an eery silence.
“Though it may be hard to accept, there’s nothing we can do but hope for the best.” Kingsley advised wisely, clapping a hand on the distraught Florence’s shoulder.
“But out of all of the Aurors in the department—why would you pair up two rookies?” Harry asked with a deep frown. “Our past history aside- just because we’re to be graduated as full-fledged Aurors and won’t need a mentor anymore, shouldn’t we still at least have a senior Auror with us?! At least for the first month or something?!”
“That may be so, but I need to see them. Those two were on a mission for the Aurors and I need to discuss the information they retrieved immediately—it’s extremely time sensitive and important.” He wasn’t exactly telling the truth, but he knew that one way or another he had to get in to see them—and he really didn’t like flexing his ‘
Davies barely restrained a sarcastic snort. He strode to Harry's bedside and stuck out a hand. "Yes, Mr. Potter! An honor! I'm Davies, one of the healers who have been tasked with your care and recovery."
"What're you doing?" Draco asked curiously as the other male pointed his wand at the two unconscious Gryffindors.
“You know we’re technically not related to houses anymore,” Theo interjected pointedly, earning a shrug from the Italian.
Davies hovered over Draco's still form, feeling the boy's steady pulse. He then pulled his wand from his robes and gave it a quick flick—effectively cutting open the front of Draco's medical gown.
“Uh, Blaise! What in Salazar’s name are you doing here?” The blonde called quickly, immediately stopping his movements and dropping his hand out of his hair—trying his best to sound even-keeled with his precarious position perched on top of his lover’s hips. Thankfully the new couch position, being turned away from the fireplace—hid the length of Harry’s body, but still left the upper half Draco’s body visible due to his upright sitting position.
"Hmm, I'd say overnight here should do the trick. We'll have to keep applying this topical potion to help it along." Davies walked over to a nearby cupboard, then returned with a jar of clear liquid, shaking it slightly. "In fact, I'd say it's about time we apply more anyways." He snapped his fingers and several of his nursing staff stepped forward.
“It will no longer be possible, because Auror Knightly has given you a recommendation to be accepted into the department as a full fledged Auror—meaning that you will no longer require the assistance of a mentor,” Kingsley explained slowly, his mouth breaking out into a grin at the end. “Surprised?”
Hermione frowned and cocked her head in confusion. “I’m sorry, but I still don’t understand. How exactly are these
Florence strode from his place beside Draco's bed and stopped at the foot end of Harry's. After a quick glance, he saw white linen bandages wrapped around Harry's shirtless torso. A slight peppering of crimson splatters were starkly visible against the bandages.
Draco groaned internally as he felt the hands on his thighs tighten their grip. “I don’t remember ever complaining about him to you,” He sighed with a frown.
Harry nearly voiced out his displeasure of him having broken the kiss so quickly—but he suddenly remembered that he was in front of his friends. Kissing his lover. Who also happened to be Draco Malfoy. Who didn't have a good history with his two friends. And who also looked like they wanted to throw up and murder him at the same time.
“Not...exactly,” The Minister answered hesitantly—standing up from behind his desk and turning to pace around the room slowly, clasping his hands behind his back and frowning slightly as he collected his thoughts.
“It seems everything is in order now,” He cleared his throat and gazed over at the crowd of Aurors. “With the power invested in me, as Minister for Magic—and with the signed contracts of both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy—it is my pleasure to now officially announce to you the newest members of the Department of Aurors! Auror Potter, and Auror Malfoy.”
“Mr. Malfoy came in to see me about 2 months ago, filing the claim I told you about earlier, and asking to be considered for a job as an Auror...After taking a look at his test scores and doing a preliminary check, I felt there was no reason why he couldn’t start to be trained in. Like you, he exhibited a great deal of knowledge and instinct on the job, and quickly progressed through the training—as you did.” Kingsley paused, resting his chin in his clasped hands.
Draco nodded slowly, still trying to process what happened. “But why was I sent into surgery? I don’t think anything happened to me....” He glanced down at himself, turning his arms and examining for any signs of injury.
Kingsley chuckled and waved his hand dismissively. “Ah, Potter—there’s no need to be so uptight. If there was something wrong with the way you’ve been performing, of course either Knightly or I would’ve said something.” He grinned as Harry sank meekly back into his seat.
“Alright. It’s....2:30 now—,” The green eyed wizard confirmed after glancing up at the clock on their wall. “I’m gonna go take a bath, so you can chat for a bit with your mate and then kindly excuse him—alright? We can have lunch after that.”
Harry had the grace to look slightly bashful as Ron threw an accusatory scowl over at his supposed best friend.
"Harry! Oh it's so good to see you, what happened?" Hermione asked with confused smile, glancing around to survey her surroundings.
“Oh—you mean this little sum~?” Blaise grinned wickedly and jiggled the Galleons in his pocket. “I told Pansy that our innocent little Draco had gotten himself a lover, and it turned out to be none other than dear old Saint Potter himself! Well, of course she didn’t believe me, and I bet money on it...So, to the victor go the spoils~!”
He and Draco had been successfully dating for over two years without telling another soul- and Draco seemed perfectly content with keeping it that way.
The older male nodded and stroked his chin thoughtfully. “I understand, but trust me—you’re doing extremely well for how short of a time you’ve been on the job for...Most rookie Aurors are sent to St. Mungo’s on their first day...”
"Hmm..." Davies moved the wand-light around Harry's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, checking for...something. Knightly and Kingsley watched in silence as Davies poked and prodded Harry's face. After he was done, he gestured to Harry's bandaged chest.
The nurse sitting behind the desk glanced up from her pile of paperwork, and her eyes bulged slightly. “M-Minister Shacklebolt—what can I do for you?”
“Harry...” The Minister started tiredly, rubbing his own temples. “I know you won’t understand now—but all that I’ve done, I’ve done so with a full and complete understanding of the consequences that it may have, as well as the benefits. My decision to make you and Malfoy Auror partners was not one that was made overnight—it was done only after much time of very careful thought and consideration, Alright?”
"Oh." Harry closed his eyes and tried to swallow his embarrassment. "It's because I was screaming, wasn't I?" His voice was flat. It was more a statement than a question.
"Gentleman," he turned to Kingsley and Knightly and made polite shooing motions. "If you would please."
“Easy now, just take a seat,” Kingsley gestured Harry back to his chair as he went around the desk and sat back in his own chair. “You fainted while we were discussing your new assignment.”
Sure enough, though it wasn’t immediately noticeable in the dim lighting, a thin silvery chain was looped several times around the Hippogriff’s neck—the remains hanging limply and trailing behind the beast as it walked.
Draco’s shoulders jerked in surprise at the sudden commotion, but it didn’t take him long to figure out where, or who, it came from. “....
“You already introduced yourself, Blaise,” The blonde replied with a roll of his eyes, glancing over at Hermione. “Granger, er...Mrs. Weasley? No...Bloody Hell, this is gonna get too confusing...”
"Alright, 'Mione......" A second figure, Ron returned with a slight roll of his eyes, as he too landed in the fireplace—again, bending down to haphazardly sweep the powder off his own coat as well. The redhead took no more than one step out of the fireplace before lifting his eyes and suddenly processing the scene taking place on the couch directly in front of him, barely 10 feet away.
He was still a bit peeved at the attitude that his lover had already chosen to adopt as soon as Ron and Hermione had entered their apartment- even after Harry had begged him ahead of time to be on his best behavior.
"Harry!! You were here with Malfoy earlier weren't you??!!" He suddenly exploded—waving an accusingly finger wildly towards his friend.
“This is the partner contract for Aurors Malfoy and Potter.” He turned and made sure that all saw the scroll raised in his hand before continuing. “I as Minister bore witness to the creation of this contract, and have signed my name along with the two Aurors to be partnered. I would now like to invite them forwards to bind and seal this contract by means of the Unbreakable Vow—ensuring that neither will go against the terms that they’ve signed into.”
“That bastard is none of my concern,” Draco replied evenly, forcing himself to keep from getting goaded on by the man.
The pair continued their languid snogging and groping for another few minutes before Draco finally released his lover’s lips with a groan.
Harry groaned again and wordlessly nodded. The wards that they kept up around their apartment weren't harmful—they just caused any person who entered without the permission of either him or Draco to fall unconscious moments after they enter the flat—as was what happened to the pair of knocked out Gryffindors.
“Yeah, yeah....I should.....,” The blonde commented idly, suddenly catching sight of his cellphone vibrating on the kitchen counter. “Hang on just a sec....”
The sudden rustling sound startled the two wizards, and they glanced to the bed in surprise as they saw Draco blink his eyes open slowly—turning his head against his pillow and scanning his eyes around to get a view of the room.
Draco didn’t let his lover’s lack of enthusiasm derail him—slowly trailing his pale fingers down the Gryffindor’s chest and slipping them underneath the fabric of the faded T-shirt to grope at his firm chest. After a moment, Harry groaned in defeat and batted his lover’s hand away so that he could sit up—effectively stretching his arms over his head and slipping off his shirt in the process.
“You’ll officially become partners tomorrow—there’s a special meeting that we need to have to finish all of the formalities, but you won’t start on field assignments together until the end of the week. That way Knightly and I will be able to to monitor and make sure you two don’t try to kill each other before your first assignment together.”
Draco gasped again as another jolt of unbearable pain shot through his chest and he slumped onto his back—his wand falling from his hand.
“Uh...Ron, Hermione...you remember Draco...?” The Gryffindor began poorly, gesturing lightly to his lover sitting at the large, circular table. Draco glanced up at hearing his name, coffee cup in hand, and offered a small smirk.
He waved his wand and muttered a few spells to lift the wards' effects on his company—and moments later the two began to rouse with groans and yawns.
“See? So now it’s facing the kitchen instead of the fireplace!” Draco happily stated the obvious, looking quiet proud of himself for some reason.
"As long as you're happy, Harry. We'll accept you no matter what." Hermione added a bit tearfully, walking over to give the dark haired wizard a hug.
Draco’s jaw slackened in surprise, and a short stutter of disbelieving laughter escaped his lips. “W-what? Harry, that’s embarrassing...”
Harry watched the exchange between the four Slytherins with an expression just short of astonishment.
“Alright then,” Kingsley stopped moving his wand, and only wispy silver lines remained as evidence of the spell, wrapping and curving around the boys’ still-entwined arms. Both stared at the arms numbly as Kingsley stored his wand and turned to address the small crowd of Aurors. “Witches and Wizards of the Department of Aurors—may I present to you the newest team of Aurors to the department!”
“Of course not! I never forget a bet I make with anybody!” Pansy grinned victoriously, opening up her clutch purse and dropping the Galleons in.
The three wizards restrained the barely—conscious Hippogriff and bound it with two more of the silvery chains that Harry and Draco had seen around its neck earlier. Then, one of them produced a leather strap which they used to firmly clamp shut the Hippogriff’s sharp beak.
Harry, instead of reminding him for the hundredth time that he was perfectly capable of apparating himself back to the Ministry, simply indulged the older man’s request and grabbed hold of his arm. The familiar, but still unsettling feeling of being stretched like a piece of taffy traveling a hundred miles an hour came and quickly passed, and his feet made contact with the ground once again.
“I do have to say though, this story is turning out to be a whole lot more interesting than I thought it was going to be~” Blaise crooned gleefully.
“The truth is...,” The older man started quietly, staring at the folder intently. “We at the Ministry have actually been working on something called
This time it was Harry’s turn to flush slightly at the nonchalant way that Blaise explained the situation, though Draco seemed used to his friend’s antics.
"Is something the matter, Ron?" Hermione asked with a frown of her own, clearly feeling as if something wasn't right.
“That’s right! Healer Zabini—certified favorite Doctor of all at the pediatric ward at St. Mungo’s, at your service.” The Slytherin replied with a flourish of his hands and a grandiose bow of his head.
“Alright! That’s enough you two!” Kingsley stood suddenly, his deep voice booming as he silenced the two. “You’re both acting like children, now stop it!”
The three lapsed into silence—Kingsley continuing to pace around the small ward, his face set into hard lines. Florence watched Draco carefully, but the blonde kept his gaze fixated firmly on the sheets covering his lap—his mind drifting off into thought.
Blaise shrugged innocently and swished his wand a few times, sending the couch up into the air before spinning it around and dropping it back to the ground. “
“You first assignment is as follows. You have been tasked to a reconnaissance mission, trying to track a group of snatchers who have been suspected of illegally transporting foreign substances—including magical creatures.” Florence rolled up the piece of parchment and stared at the two boys with an uncharacteristically serious mien. “Though this is only a recon mission, it is very important that you two stay on constant alert.”
The words however merely washed over Draco, who easily scoffed and rolled his eyes at the threat. "Oh
The positively giddy tone that Blaise was using made Draco weary. He knew that he couldn’t risking exposing a more information than that for fear of Blaise putting all of the pieces together. The Italian could be deceptively perceptive when he wanted to be.
“Oh don’t you look at me like that, you’re not dragging me into this,” Draco refuted resolutely, ignoring Blaise’s set of amber puppy dog eyes directed at him.
“Ah, apologies...I guess I missed the greetings..” He drawled smoothly, turning an interested gaze to the new pair of Gryffindors sitting at the table.
He jerked slightly and snapped out of his train of thought as he felt equally firm fingers suddenly contact his own forearm.
“Is that so....” Draco smirked wryly, raising an amused eyebrow at the prospect. “Anyways, glad to know you’re not prejudiced—but he is a wizard...”
“Ah, good question.” Florence pulled an ornate pocket watch out of the confines of his robes and turned his head sideways to read it.
There, marred against the deathly pale skin of Draco's torso, was a wound, exactly like the one on Harry's. Knightly gaped at the wound in realized horror, darting to check the appearance of Harry's wound, then coming back to check Draco's.
"Yeah...I thought so.......Bloody Gryffindor loyalty...." Draco muttered with a wry laugh, turning to glance out the window again.
“I’m sorry.....please don’t be mad~ It’s not like it was my fault that he came over here unannounced....,” Draco pouted and jutted his lip out childishly, trying to rack up some kind of pity points from his lover.
Harry gasped and held a hand to his chest. “S-surprised?! Of course I am! Kingsley, I thought you were firing me!” He stood up and exclaimed a bit too loudly.
“Yeah, but how do we know you didn’t lie to Harry about what happened?” Ron butted in again, narrowing his eyes at the blonde.
The case that Kingsley had entrusted to the two of them had been one they’d been dealing with for nearly a month. They only finally wrapped the case up that morning after receiving a lead that proved to be exactly what they needed to tie up the last loose ends.
“Ugh, enough...’m going crazy.....,” He whimpered—sitting back and grinding his hips down against his lover’s impatiently.
“I’m not quite sure, myself,” Florence replied slowly. “As soon as the healers took a look at you when we brought you in, they said that your vitals signs were all dropping extremely fast...Harry’s were as well, but that was attributed to the large injury on his chest...”
Kingsley grabbed a glass of water that had been set on the bedside table, most likely for this exact purpose, and handed it carefully to Draco. “Easy now, you’re at St. Mungo’s,” he responded, steadying the glass slightly as Draco brought it his lips with shaky hands. “Do you remember what happened?”
“Oh can it, Potter,” Draco bit back irritably, ceasing his muttering long enough to throw the green-eyed boy a piercing glare. “I act how I have to in front of the people that judge my standing in the Wizarding World—are you really any different?”
“Well then—I’m sure you’ll spare none of the details, right Draco?” Theo quipped with a knowing smirk, staring down his friend with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes.
"Well, I want to test a hypothesis. If Davies treated Mr. Potter's chest wound and that wound showed up on Mr. Malfoy's chest, then maybe any wound—or treatment of wound—that one of them receives, the other receives as well," Blackwell explained thoughtfully.
Draco glanced briefly at the eccentric older man, seeing his face slightly stern and serious for the first time. For some reason it made him feel even more nervous—as though now everything he did would be brought back to Florence due to his training. He shook his head and tried to pay attention as Kingsley’s voice boomed through the room again.
Her face erupted into a blush, but Harry was sure that hers was no match for his. He was blushing so much he felt his ears burning.
“Good, good.” Kingsley nodded, retrieving the quill from Harry’s hand and then gesturing Draco forward.
, like you would really kick me out of our bed." He waved a dismissive hand at the obvious bluff and continued, his voice now losing anger and gaining it's usual haughtiness.
“Oh come now, can’t we just continue on with the story like civilized Gryffindors and Slytherins?” Blaise cut silkily, earning an array of scowls in return.
“Honestly Ron, grow up,” Harry finally exclaimed, glaring down the redhead until he finally dropped his gaze with a grumble.
Harry sighed and tried not to grimace as he turned and stood facing Draco’s gaunt profile. Though the blonde had seemed as snarky and confident yesterday as Harry had remembered him being in school, the boy he now saw in front of him looked oddly nervous and timid. Draco’s pale grey eyes flitted around quickly and his pale hands clenched together tightly, relaxing a second later only to clench back into a tight fist.
“Indirectly, yes,” Theo confirmed with a nod. “I work behind the scenes most times, but I do come in to operating room to assist with sedations and the like...as well as administering potions to some younger children in Blaise’s ward...”
“The contract is bound by an Unbreakable Vow,” Kingsley interjected sternly. “Once the terms of the contract are set by both Aurors, they will take an Unbreakable Vow with the other to swear to protect the other.”
“Look. No matter what either the two of you think about this new arrangement, I’m afraid to say that there’s nothing that I can do for you at the moment,” Kingsley refuted firmly, staring each of the boys down with an even glance. “Now I’m going to help you guys set some ground rules first, so this’ll help for the most part with keeping the two of you safe— others as well as yourselves.”
"Don't forget the part about only being attracted to blonde, pureblooded, Slytherin men with devilishly handsome looks and a great body." Draco piped in with flirtatious wink directed at the dark haired male.
“This prick works in the Pediatric ward at St. Mungo’s...” The blonde supplied tiredly, rolling his eyes as Blaise puffed his chest out proudly.
Draco glanced back upon hearing another presence in the kitchen, and offered a somewhat apologetic smile to the dark haired male.
"I told you they would accept us." Harry replied with a soft smile, turning to link his arms behind the blonde's neck.
...Draco....stop,” Harry protested weakly despite throwing his head back in pleasure at the sensation. Draco’s administrations were sending heat pooling straight to his groin—and if he wasn’t careful he was going to end up losing control already.
“Now now, I’ve left you each a spot at the bottom for one request. As long as it pertains to both members, I’ll allow it.” Kingsley finalized, turning to Harry first.
From the way the Draco saw it, he didn't have any family that he wanted to tell about it—his father was locked away in Azkaban (and he didn't give two dragon craps what his old man had to say anymore), and his mother had passed away from emotional turmoil and stress a few years prior—leaving Draco detached from any other familial connections that he had.
Though he still looked the same for the most part, Draco’s entire demeanor seemed far more mature than it had just a few years ago when Harry had seen him at Hogwarts.
“....You really like this show that much?” Draco questioned with a snort, sinking down onto the couch next to the tanned Slytherin.
"Well unless you fancy sleeping by yourself on the couch for the next month, I suggest you straighten your attitude out and just comply,
’!” Florence whispered helpfully, though his voice sounded strangely nervous—as if he himself wasn’t even sure if he had done what was asked.
“No matter—no harm done I suppose,” The dark skinned male continued, offering the pair of Gryffindors a bright grin. “Let me fully introduce myself then. Blaise Zabini—best and one of only three friends of the snarky ice prince Draco Malfoy. We went to school together...not that you guys probably remember me since I was in Slytherin, obviously...”
“Ahhh!” he cried out in pain, searching desperately around for his wand to try and stop the pain. He found his wand and grabbed it, fumbling and tearing at his shirt to try and see the wound that was causing the pain. He ripped his shirt open and pointed his wand at his own chest, but saw no wound. His skin was pale and bare—no different from how it normally looked.
Davies wasted no time getting the potion into Draco's mouth as Kingsley tried to restrain the boy's arms. In a matter of seconds, the room quieted as both boys slowly went still.
Blaise raised his hands in defense and gave a chuckle. “Seriously though, what if he comes on to you?” The Slytherin suddenly stopped and stared at Draco intently. “......Or has he already....?”
—Polaroid! I wanna get that stupid look on Weaslbe's face burned into a picture!" The blonde replied in sheer delight—hopping nimbly off of the couch and trailing after his dark haired lover.
Theo rolled his eyes at her childish display and shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. “I figured that if two of the biggest war heroes of the Wizarding World were getting married, every paper from here to Hogwarts would be covering the story. Since there wasn’t any talk of it besides that one article, I figured it probably wasn’t true...”
“The winner will be the recipient of 100 galleons...?” Theo questioned cooly, and Blaise nodded numbly in response.
“No, not—,” Draco was shaking his head but paused suddenly, cocking his head with a puzzled expression. “Actually, I did get hit.
"As I said—we finished the surgeries and expelled the dark magic—but just to make sure, we then sent both of the boys through an additional scan to detect for any traces of dark magic that could still be lingering in their bodies. And we found some." Davies began to pace again, slowly—his charming face marred by furrowed brows.
"Young Malfoy's wound...it's healing..." Blackwell darted over to Harry and surveyed the wound. "Both wounds are healing at exactly the same rate..."
Harry’s heart immediately dropped and his palms felt sweaty. This was the first time Kingsley had ever only dismissed Florence and asked him to stay.
, because I live here." Drawled the calm and cool voice of Draco as he strolled out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on a towel that he had slung over his shoulder.
Kingsley smiled down at the two and offered his own round of applause before reaching underneath the podium and bringing forth a sealed role of parchment that the pair knew all too well from the night before.
"I get....why you want to tell your friends about us...sorta......You feel like you're betraying them by lying to them.....?"
Harry, on the other hand, had plenty of people that he had been keeping in the dark about his relationship status. Hermione and Ron, Ginny, the rest of the Weasley's whom he considered his own blood family—not a single one of them knew. The dark haired male figured it would have been bad enough to simply keep them out of the loop in terms of him finding a significant other—but when he actually lined up all of the bullet points of things he had yet to actually tell them....
“Um...So how has work been at the Ministry?” He tried tentatively, glancing between his two friends.
Davies groaned and rolled his eyes as the squabbles—mainly of Draco and Knightly—filled the room with incessant noise. Suddenly a movement caught his eye, prompting him to snap his fingers. "Shush, shush. Look."
Blaise grinned and released Harry’s hand, turning to the slightly cringing face of his best friend. “Naughty, naughty Dray Dray. Did you really think that you could keep this a secret from me~?”
The snatcher stared him down, debating if he wanted to continue the fight. Just as he began to raise his wand again, a voice from behind him started yelling.
“Oh no you don’t...” The Slytherin muttered, quickly seizing a hold on Harry’s arm and dragging him back onto the couch beside him.
Before Harry could even mutter a counter-curse, he was sent flying backwards, hitting the ground hard. He groaned at the immediate jolt of pain, tasting blood. He didn’t know what sort of jinx the snatcher had used, but his body felt heavy—pain clouding his thoughts.
Harry’s eyes widened before his brows drew down in a frown. “That’s...horrible...how come there hasn’t been anything down about it?”
“Ah, no....I think he went out to get groceries.....,” Draco lied with another shrug, earning an annoyed pinch on the ass from his dark haired lover. Draco knew that Harry was likely already reaching the end of his temper, but he reached down and swatted the hand away from his butt anyways as he struggled to remain impassive.
Draco scowled up at Blaise with newly remembered annoyance. “I was just going to get dressed....,” He bit through his teeth, dragging his feet over to the staircase with a scowl pasted firmly to his face.
“Do you swear that they were trained to Department standards, and taught with the knowledge of the goal that we here at the Ministry strive to achieve?”
Harry glanced at Draco, but he was still in the middle of a bicker fest with Blaise. Since he was the one that had ordered the drinks, Harry didn’t actually know whose drinks were whose.
“Effective immediately, I’m assigning Draco Malfoy as your new partner, Potter,” Kingsley stated firmly, and suddenly Harry’s vision went blurry.
“But I didn’t do anything!” Draco protested in return, paying no heed to the other Gryffindors as they slowly sank, shell-shocked, into seats next to Harry’s.
Harry rolled his eyes at the dramatic statement. “Honestly Draco, what’s the worst that could happen?”
"There's a chance that that dark magic is somehow affecting both of their bodies at the same time," Davies finished with a nod.
It didn't seem possible, but Harry paled even further—and before he had a chance to stop his lover from doing something stupid—Draco shot him a wink and a smirk before opening his mouth to retort.
The raven haired wizard floundered awkwardly at the waiter’s insistent invitation, and opened his mouth repeatedly as he struggled with what to say.
Davies cleared his throat and resumed. "After we were sure that both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy were safe and free of the dark magic that had been inflicting their wounds, we thought that we were in the free and clear. Unfortunately though, we were wrong."
Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “Well, I dunno...I just thought it might have something to do with the whole ‘Savior of the Wizarding World’ thing, y’know? People still treat me differently because of it...”
Kingsley swept a gaze over Draco’s listless form and sighed deeply, taking a step away from the bed and beginning to pace—hands clasped firmly behind his back.
“Ah, Draco!” Florence exclaimed, tears of relief in his eyes. He knelt down beside the bed and grabbed one of Draco’s pale hand in his own two. “Are you alright? How are you feeling? The nurses here haven’t told us anything!”
This time the Hippogriff gave screech as it fell over—and two of the other wizards quickly ran over to restrain it.
Harry steeled himself for a worse reaction, raising one of his own brows in slight surprise at the docile behavior.
Blackwell rubbed his chin in thought. "I think that we should try waking the two of them up now, and see if we can get some more answers to help us solve this puzzle."
“Good. Do you swear to follow the rules and views of both the Department of Aurors, as well as the Ministry of Magic itself—so long as you are Aurors?”
“Then if we get that chain, it’ll be evidence against the snatchers!” Harry continued excitedly. “There may even be a chance that we could use the chain to track the snatchers!”
“All I need is for each of you to sign underneath your designated line,” Kingsley explained quietly, gesturing for Harry to step forwards. “Right here.”
Florence’s heart jumped in empathy and he rested a hand on Draco’s back. “It’s alright now, Draco. We have a team of the best healers here—I’m sure they’ll fine a way to fix ole Harry up good as new.”
“Alright, let’s continue,” He prompted his lover once he was sure that no one else was going to raise a fuss.
"So, Uh.....Where should I start...." Harry began nervously, flitting his eyes back and forth between his two longtime friends.
Harry grit his teeth. “I don’t need proof. I’m a certified Auror, and if I report you to the Ministry—,”
His protests seemed to fall on deaf ears as Kingsley merely dismissed them with a smile and a wave of his hand.
Harry sniffed indignantly and purposefully turned away from his lover, causing Draco to throw a hand in the air in annoyance. “Alright,
“You’re such a prat...,” He muttered in annoyance, slipping an arm around Draco’s lean waist to anchor him in place on his lap.
“Thank you, sir,” Harry beamed with a grin, almost forgetting that in mere moments he was going to be paired as partners with Draco.
Suddenly, he could hear the faint sound of footsteps padding lightly down the staircase. His heartbeat increased but he forced himself to remain calm as he turned slightly to see the figure emerge from the bottom of the staircase.
“Sir,” Harry interrupted Draco’s dumbstruck train of thought. “You can’t possibly be suggesting that we go out on our own for our first mission together tomorrow already? I mean we haven’t even trained together!”
Harry blinked up at the Slytherin wordlessly, taking several long seconds to comprehend what he was saying.
"I'm sure that no one objects to some Chinese stir fry? Cause if you do, you know where the door is~"
The figure pranced closer to the tree-line until it emerged in front of them—gold and brown feathers glittering slightly in the dimly lit forest. It clicked its beak at them and slowly paced back and forth—eyes never leaving them.
Pansy threw an annoyed look down at the dark skinned male and pursed her lips as she sank into the seat next to him. “You’re not my superior Blaise.”
Draco quickly snagged his cellphone off of the counter and shoved it into his jeans pocket before navigating to the lower level bathroom.
Thankfully, both Harry and Draco at least had the grace to look slightly shamed at the petty squabbling they had been doing. Kingsley took a deep breath and sat back down, rubbing his temples gingerly.
Pansy pursed her lips with a slight pout, and Theo sent an unimpressed look over to Blaise—the first actual facial movement that Harry had seen from the male.
“The hell it is! You’re a married woman! People need to make note of who you belong to!” Ron interjected angrily.
“Dammit, that’s it!” Harry finally maneuvered his elbow free and quickly rammed it backwards. It connected solidly with Draco’s side and his grip on Harry released.
Draco surmised that the spell that Harry had been cursed with must have been some kind of dark magic that was impeding with the healing charms Draco was trying to use.
, and it looks like something she'd wear." The blonde retorted with a shudder, sneaking his wand out of his back pocket and quickly flicking it at the jumper.
“Anything you should know?” Florence paused and cast his gaze up thoughtfully. “I can’t say that there’s anything specific, all the information concerning your mission was written up on that parchment that I read you...”
“Your hand,” Kingsley replied, and Draco finally realized that Harry had his own hand outstretched—waiting for Draco to grasp on.
The comment caught Draco off-guard, and the snatcher used that opportunity to throw a jinx at Harry.
Harry let his hands roam downwards as he busied his mouth with his lover’s, reaching the hem of Draco’s pants and fumbling to undo his belt. The Gryffindor growled in annoyance and groped around for his wand. With the swish of a wrist both of their pants were gone and the dark haired wizard happily returned to his exploring—sneaking his hands around his lover’s smooth underwear-clad butt and swatting it lovingly.
Seconds later the pair found themselves in a carpeted hallway, leading directly to a pair of dark, wooden doors.
Seeing as he usually went out for dinner with Ron and Hermione once a week, questions regarding his dating status were frequent—and he had to make up a menagerie of excuses to cover for his actual relationship status concerning the Slytherin. Hermione and Ron were also employees of the Ministry—but being that they were in different departments, they weren't even informed that he and Draco were Auror partners. But, enough was enough—Harry decided that he finally wanted to come clean to them—starting with them coming over to his and Draco's apartment for dinner......
Davies turned his gaze to the ground. "At this point, I don't think it's a matter of whether or not they're going to be alright," he said after a moment. "The problem is what this dark magic is doing to them in conjunction. And how hard it's going to be to expel the magic from the two of them."
“Do you both swear to protect any and all forms of life—whether wizard, muggle, magical being, or other—so long as you are both Aurors?”
“You.....just vanished.....my favorite......white.....designer...jeans......?” The blonde turned wide eyes on his lover below, and Harry knew he’d just screwed himself.
“What is it, Hermione?” Harry asked as he directed his gaze towards her puzzled face. He could practically hear the gears turning in her head.
“Well if we’re going by how you act, then that’s not actually true Blaise,” Theo finally commented with a quirk of his brow, sliding into the seat next to Pansy.
“Somebody...walking in on us....,” Harry mumbled petulantly, his cheeks tinging slightly pink in embarrassment.
Harry felt a wave of ease and relief wash over him, but Draco’s scowl seemed to deepen. Blaise laughed and shook his head at his friend’s behavior. “I’m sorry to say, but I think you think too little of me as your friend, mate. Did you think that I wouldn’t notice changes in your behavior at all? Tsk tsk, simpleminded Dray Dray—thinking that the world only revolves as he wants it to.” Blaise chuckled and walked slowly to the fireplace, sending another gloating smirk.
“Minister,” Draco started cooly, glancing at Harry quickly before returning his gaze to the older man in front of him. “Can you at least tell us
“They are not to be hunted, taken as pets, or illegally sold,” The snatcher replied calmly, nodding his head in acknowledgement.
"Can we please talk about this? Over dinner?" He asked quietly, pleading with his eyes for the two of his friends to give him a chance.
“Yeah, for when we do apron play~” The blonde bit his lip and dropped his voice down seductively. “I can watch your sexy naked behind make me breakfast in that frilly apron I bought from—
The jumper fit him like a glove and was spectacularly soft and warm. He had to admit—his lover did have excellent taste when it came to clothing.
“I decided to keep his name out of the department system for various reasons. Mostly because I didn’t want anyone making a fuss before he even started officially working here.”
Draco made a noise of protest at his apparent description, but Blaise shushed him before he could get a word in.
“Now now, we have plenty of time for that,” Blaise interjected with a sly grin, motioning for the newly arrived pair to take a seat. “Don’t be rude Pansy, you’re supposed to greet your superiors.”
Harry cringed a bit and shook his head slightly. "I know...that everyone thought that Ginny and I would end up together...." He trailed off wistfully, and Draco felt a painful pang of jealousy in his chest.
“Details, Draco! Details!” The dark skinned male demanded, eyes glittering with excitement at this new found revelation.
Pansy glanced over at Draco with a piercing gaze, which he returned with a quirked brow. “And what, pray tell, does this bet have to do with me
The last thing that he remembered seeing before he completely blacked out was the sky above him—clear and blue.
“Does it really matter, Potter?” Draco returned with an agitated sigh. “If we walk North from here we should be able to make it to Hogsmeade in about 15 minutes.”
The small band of snatchers were still holding the chained Hippogriff, but the creature had started to show signs of stirring.
Draco contemplated Harry’s words with a cock of his head. “I was wondering along similar lines...I don’t want to say that it seems reckless and irresponsible to send out two rookie Aurors together to work on cases when there are plenty of senior Auror pairs that do the same type of cases, but...”
Davies wiped at his brow nervously. "I...I may have a hunch." He paused. "But I'm going to call in another healer to help evaluate the situation." Davies turned to his staff. "Please fetch Healer Blackwell and tell him to report to me in the critical care ward. Tell him it's an absolute emergency regarding patients Potter and Malfoy."
“Oh~?” The Italian quirked his lips into a daring smirk. “Did I disappoint you~?” His tone dropped and took on a flirty note as he stared the brunette down.
The impact of the spell actually didn’t hurt that much, much to Draco’s astonishment. It had been enough to knock him over, but other than that he really didn’t feel any different. He looked down at himself and then glanced over at Harry. Neither of them looked any different either. He frowned and quickly resumed his spell chanting, his puzzlement replaced with an increasing worry as Harry’s wound still refused to mend. Draco had been casting healing charms for long enough that there should have been some noticeable difference in Harry’s condition—but nothing seemed different.
Kingsley waved a hand around. “Your job, working with Knightly, learning all the tricks of the trade...How are you liking it so far?”
“Hmm? Kingsley?” He questioned confusedly, finally sitting as he saw the dark skinned male hovering over him. “Am I...? Laying on the floor...In your office?!”
Ron looked away indignantly, not even meeting his emerald eyes. Hermione on the other hand gave a small sigh, her standing wavering at the heartbroken look on her friend's face.
“But how do we know if what he’s telling us is the truth, mate?” Ron spoke up with a frown. “If you said yourself that you were out of it, then how do you even know what happened while you knocked out?”
“..Wha-?” Florence jerked his head up in surprise at the call of his name. He blinked bleary eyes and looked around in confusion—he hadn’t remembered closing his eyes for a nap.
The four remaining members of the party all shared an equal shudder at the poetically cheesy lines that he delivered with a straight face.
Blaise chuckled and waved his hand dismissively. “I think you two are both overreacting. These are your best mates that you’re talking about—I don’t think things could possibly turn out as horribly as you’re imagining that they could.”
Kingsley bit back the chuckle that threatened to rise in his throat once more and clapped each of those boys on the back with a wide smile. “Don’t worry! I have all the faith that you two will do extremely well together.”
"Wait!" Knightly suddenly exclaimed. "Why don't you finish putting on that healing potion while they're still knocked out? It obviously wasn't a good idea to do it while they were still conscious..."
“Yeah, I do...I’m Blaise’s nursing assistant in the Pediatric department,” The raven hair girl replied sulkily. “Well, I guess I may as well keep introducing myself next then...I’m Pansy Parkinson—only female friend of Draco Malfoy for 10-15 years...? Went to Hogwarts in Slytherin with these three...I already told you I’m a healer at St. Mungo’s...” She trailed off with a slight shrug.
"Mmmm, I know....." Draco responded dazedly, already rocking his hips rhythmically as he continued to move further south on his lover's body.
“Potter, I can understand your feelings—but I’ve already put careful thought and consideration into the decision. It’s final,” Kingsley stated gently but firmly, offering the emerald-eyes boy no more than a slightly pitying look. “It’s been years since you’ve seen Draco Malfoy, so I’d like for you to try and not think of him as he was back when you knew him in school—a lot’s changed since then...”
After seeing Draco interacting so well with Muggle objects, Harry had finally taken the next step about a year ago in purchasing Draco his own cellphone. While the learning curve for using it had been fairly steep to begin with, months of use had made the blonde Slytherin a pro at using one—so much so that he didn’t know how he had lived up until that point without one. Said cellphone though, was currently vibrating on the counter—and knowing that he had only one contact in his phone, Draco knew it had to be Harry.
"Urg, my head hurts.....what happened..?" Ron blearily opened his eyes and glanced around in confusion—eyes darting quickly to the figure leaning against him.
Draco threw a glare over at the dark skinned male. “Oh bugger off Blaise, I don’t wanna hear that from
; either get rid of him, or I’m gonna have to,” Harry finally snapped—redirecting his glare up at the pair of grey puppy dog eyes pleading innocence down at him.
Harry blinked in surprise. She didn’t seem to be acting condescendingly, he noted as she turned back and threw Draco an impressed smirk.
The blonde perked up and swooped down to drop a chaste kiss on his lover’s lips. “Don’t worry love—15 minutes and he’s gone!”
"Well if you're done with your ladies aid, then it's time to eat." Draco commented with a smirk, swishing his wand and levitating different plates filled with food onto the table.
“Why on earth would there be a Hippogriff here? They’re endangered species so all of them should be in Ministry monitored sanctuaries.” Harry mumbled with a frown. “Unless...”
"This topical is sort of a double-edged sword," Davies added. "While it helps to heal the wound quickly, it's also extremely painful for the person receiving the treatment. Thus, we can only apply it in small dosages as the patient tolerates the pain. We wait a few hours between applications to help the pain subside, as well as to give the body a chance to assist in healing the wound itself, as Blackwell was saying."
Blackwell turned to Kingsley in slight surprise. Obviously he hadn't realized that they had additional company in the room. "Ah, how rude. My apologies, minister. It's an honor." The stoic faced healer extended a hand politely and shook hands with Kingsley.
Harry glanced at his wristwatch. “Um...I’m not sure...Ginny never actually replied to my owl, so I’m not sure if she’s actually coming.....Dray?” He touched his lover’s arm lightly to get him to snap out of his staring contest with the wall.
“Hmph, you guys just don’t respect me~” Blaise pouted, turning to Draco for support as the blonde too, returned to his seat between him and Harry.
“My new...? Oh...” Harry closed his eyes and rubbed at his temples. “I thought that was just a bad dream...”
“Don’t worry, this ceremony is a lot shorter— more of a formality, really,” Florence assured, sensing Harry’s shift in mood.
She stood up and braced an arm around Ron’s back as she led him back to where the restrooms were supposedly placed—indicated by a small sign.
Draco sprinted in the opposite direction of the Hippogriff, dragging Harry behind him, and pulled them into hiding behind a dense thicket of bushes.
"But what if they change your mind.....?" Draco whispered, tracing a pattern into the fog of the window pane with his finger as he stared out it—not daring to meet the dark haired male's piercing stare.
Suddenly Hermione stopped talking and stared directly at him, and Harry realized that she must have asked him something.
Minutes passed and nothing but the sound of crunching leaves and the whisper of a breeze filled the air. Harry walked in front, wand held loosely by his side as he kept a steady watch around for anything that might be ahead of them. Draco followed only a short distance behind, his own wand stashed away in the confines of his back pocket as he trained his focus in just ahead of Harry’s figure. So far they had been walking for closed to 10 minutes and hadn’t seen sight of a single thing—person nor creature.
The dark skinned Slytherin rose from his perch on the chair and began strolling idly around the living room. “He seems very dominant and controlling.”
“Well don’t keep us in suspense, Potter!” Pansy crooned giddily, tapping her feet in excitement. “C’mon and tell us what happened next!”
Trapped with nowhere to escape, Harry stood frozen to the spot—waiting until Kingsley had glanced up at him and motioned for him to take a seat on a chair that he conjured in front of the desk.
The snatcher placed a hand on his chest as if offended. “Capturing? No, no—you misunderstand. We saw this poor Hippogriff knocked unconscious and tangled in chains, so we came to its aid! We’re going to bring it back to our headquarters and take care of it before we release it.” The man smiled smoothly, a mischievous glitter in his eyes.
"I'll get to that in a moment," Davies replied cooly, signaling for Florence to step away from the bed.
After donning one of Harry’s faded band tees and a simple pair of ripped jeans (nothing, though, compared to favorite, white, limited edition, 500 galleon, vintage distressed, custom-fitted, designer jeans mind you), Draco finally made his way to the staircase— not 5 minutes having passed since he left Blaise in the living room alone. The sight he came back to upon descending the staircase back to the living room was pretty much spot on with what he expected.
10 minutes later and Harry strode down the staircase, wearily searching out his lover for fear of the mischief that he was mostly likely getting ready to amuse himself with.
"C'mon, put it on~ It's cashmere—ordered custom-made, just for you." The blonde urged with an emphatic wave of his hand.
“Ah yes—where were we now...?” Draco contemplated with a sigh, as if having to search through his memories to think of where the story was going.
, Blaise,” The blonde sighed with a roll of his eyes. He caught sight of it at the end of the couch that he and Harry were currently occupying, and slowly reached for it while trying to inconspicuously push his lover off the couch. “Ah, you look over there by the Telly—I’ll check if it’s here in the couch cushions...”
"How about you start with the part where you're gay?" The Slytherin commented in amusement—grey eyes dancing with mischief as they usually did when he was teasing his lover.
“Ah...” Harry opened his mouth to finally refute the man, but he quickly turned on his heel and stalked away before any words could escape the Gryffindor’s lips.
“Oh just bloody great—more Slytherins...” Ron mumbled under his breath, taking his seat with no great amount of enthusiasm.
Harry nodded stiffly at the explanation. “Alright then. We should start by going to Hogsmeade—maybe we can find some clues about where the snatchers have gone from there.”
Harry nodded in agreement and glanced around the table. “So, Uh...how exactly should we go about doing this...?”
“...Mmm?” Draco blinked and shook his head before snapping attention—glancing over at Kingsley with a slightly glazed-over expression. “...Sorry?”
After he was safe behind the confines of a locked door, Draco perched on the counter and whipped out his phone.
not to mention that it’s in the middle of muggle residentials, and from what I hear from you, you’re always complaining about your roommate...”
Hermione muttered something under her breath akin to agreement, but Harry decided to ignore the snarky quips from his fiends for the time being as he turned back to his lover.
“Ah, sorry...You can just leave them here— we’ll get it sorted out,” Harry finally replied with an apologetic grin, realizing that nobody else at the table was going to speak up.
“Little Draco Malfoy, is it? You were about the last person that I expected to show up here. How’s your father doing?”
“Haha, how amusing...” The snatcher interrupted with a laugh, clapping his hands. “Still so naive, Mr. Potter.”
Ron raised a brow incredulously and gave his friend a strange frown- ignoring the blonde in his peripheral. "Seriously mate? You don't have a thing for girls at all?"
The sound of something sizzling in a pan answered his question, and he meandered over to the kitchen—finding his blonde lover already busy preparing food—pots and pans simmering on the stove and ingredients stacked on the counters.
Florence rose from his seat with a broad grin, waving at the applause that broke out as he made him way down to where Harry and Draco stood.
“While normally I’m against day drinking....what say you we break out the Firewhiskey and settle in for some Telly before we have lunch?” Harry offered with a grin, already reaching for the bottle.
"Look Harry.." He finally sighed, getting up from his place on their sofa and moving to lean against the window next to it.
"So...What now?" Draco asked curiously, surveying the pair on the couch with a cock of his head. "You have a grand plan for breaking it to them when they come to?"
“So...what exactly are we supposed to put in our contract..?” Draco asked with a quirk of his brow, looking somewhat disturbed.
“There must be some sort of curse on it. There’s no way a thin chain like that would be nearly enough to restrain a Hippogriff.” Harry realized out loud, keeping a steady eye on the creature pacing in front of him. “I remember hearing about the cursed objects that snatchers use to capture and restrain magical creatures with.”
Draco watched the scene unfold in front of him and released a howl of laughter—clutching at his sides as he laughed in unadulterated joy—wiping tears of mirth from his eyes after another moment of basking in the amusement. After a few more snickers he glanced up at Harry, who closed his eyes and scrubbed at his face with the back of his hands—a
Harry’s eyes widened in slight horror as he listened to what Kingsley was saying. “But why do we have to make an Unbreakable Vow?! That means that we’ll die if we don’t uphold the contract!”
Harry nodded his head and turned back to the pair to pass on the message—just as Blaise strolled back to the table, returning to his seat next to Draco.
“C’mon, I’ll show you to our table,” The raven haired male replied instead, gesturing for the pair to follow him further back into the cafe.
“As I was saying—” Draco continued, glancing between his friends on his right and his lover’s friend’s on his left. “I suppose we should make proper introductions. The whole reason why we decided to hold this luncheon with all of you lot was so we could all get to know each other better. We’re going to be seeing each other much more frequently in the future, so we decided it would be best to try and get things out and in the open sooner rather than later...”
"So Potter, how are we feeling?" The healer questioned, producing a wand from his white robes and lighting the tip with a swish.
Harry stoped his pacing to gaze over at his astoundingly astute lover, nodding his head in confirmation.
Healer Davies looked uncomfortable. "Ah, yes...Well..." He cleared his throat and looked backwards to his posse, clapping his hands. One of the witches stepped forward and presented him with a clipboard.
"You're not making any sense! Just tell us what's going on!" Florence suddenly growled, bringing to attention his presence from everyone in the room. His normally cheery face was nowhere to be seen.
“You’re allowed to put whatever you want,” Kingsley replied with a shrug. “Within reason of course.”
Draco's normally pale face was flushed and beads of sweat glistened against his forehead and neck. His eyes were still closed but he was stirring—tossing his head back and forth and mumbling aloud.
“Ah—Minister!” He hastily stood and smoothed the front of his robes down, doing the best he could to compose himself after being caught asleep by his superior.
Draco caught the flush that rose to his cheeks and rolled his eyes to cover for it. “Oh please—bugger off you prat. Just because I’m gay doesn’t mean that every man is out to get me.”
“Shh-shush!” Draco playfully swatted his lover. “You have to bait them in suspense! Don’t spoil it!”
Draco nodded enthusiastically and watched Harry stride out of the room and into their master bathroom. Mind made up, the blonde waltzed into their walk-in closet to find some clothes to wear.
“Hmm, sounds fascinating...” The blonde drawled curiously, taking a sip of coffee from his cup before turning to his partner. “I ordered you some coffee when you left, it should be here in a moment...I don’t know if your friends want to order anything while we wait for the rest of our party to show...”
The man laughed and clapped him on the back tiredly. “I have to say, you’re gettin’ pretty good there boy! I reckon you’re about ready to take on your own apprentice soon!”
“Thanks to the tip off we received, we were finally able to track down the head of the organization that was cursing all of those muggle objects and reselling them on the black market. After he was captured, we were able to collect the objects and dispel any traces of dark magic from them!”
Harry glanced up after having his name called and quickly stood, bowing his head slightly toward the older wizard.
..." He started, voice dipping down low as emotions soared through him. "—are the best thing that's ever happened to me.....I wouldn't give you up for the world...."
Kingsley nodded in satisfaction, glancing over a small stack of parchment a top his desk with a hum—stopping here and there to jot down notes with the quill in his hand.
“How about this?” Theo finally cut in. “You each tell us the story from your own point of view and impression of how things happened. Then maybe we’ll all be able to read between the lines a bit and figure out something closer to the truth of what
“Oh...” He slowly extended his left arm forward, hesitating before loosely grasping Harry’s forearm.
"You should thank me for taking time out of my busy schedule to come grace you wankers with my presence." He continued arrogantly—relishing in how purple Ron's face was turning, and how Hermione could do no more than gape at him—no words leaving her mouth.
“No...that guy performed all of his spells non-verbally. I-I tried to fix it, but it wouldn’t mend....” Draco glanced down at his hands in his lap. “There....was so much blood—I couldn’t stop it.”
"Doing just fine, eh?" Florence remarked coldly, glancing pointedly at the blood coming through the bandages. "If he's doing so fine, then why the bloody hell is he still losing blood?!"
“Uh, boss...” One of the snatchers standing near the Hippogriff coughed briefly, hesitantly trying to get the attention of their leader. “I don’t mean to interrupt, but I reckon this thing is gonna wake up at any minute—so I think we oughta skedaddle.”
“I know where we are,” Draco returned cooly, glancing around for show and shrugging easily. “Laimen Forest. Not far from Hogsmeade, if I remember correctly.”
"Maybe we should just Obliviate them and send them home—then call them back over and do that all again?" The Slytherin suggested gleefully, finally getting up from his place on the floor and flopping down on the couch beside Harry.
He sealed the promise with a dip of his head forwards—capturing the blonde's pouty lips in his own, and ravishing them tenderly.
Harry glanced up and met his gaze in surprise. Apparently the strange reaction caught him off guard. Draco shook his head slightly and diverted his attention as the fingers gripped his arm firmly.
“You two did excellent today. I’m glad everything went accordingly...” Kingsley remarked as he levitated a teapot and poured liquid into the mug sitting on the coffee table in front of him.
“Sorry, it’s just that you’re the only one of Draco’s friends that I’ve actually met yet...I’m still kinda nervous about this while thing...”
The three snatchers levitating the Hippogriff immediately froze and looked apprehensively at the newcomer.
He tried to swallow the lump in his throat and maintain his dignity as Kingsley opened his mouth to deliver the words Harry knew would end his short lived career as an Auror.
"That's all well and good and all, but have you thought about what will happen if they don't accept us?"
“Do you...work with children as well...?” Hermione asked timidly, almost afraid of getting snapped at by the other girl.
Harry walked into the room until he was standing directly in front of Kingsley’s desk, Florence striding up beside him. It was hardly Harry’s first time to visit Kingsley’s office, but it still made him feel strangely nervous each time he did so.
Draco grabbed the remote and bent down as he pretended to fish the remote control from between the cushions of the couch.
“Alright now—stay safe and do me proud, boys!” Florence called off with a wave as he retreated back in the office a few feet. On the desk in front of them, a rock shaped paperweight had begun to glow.
Though many still remembered often all that they had lost because of it, most all had moved on—and life had started to become happy again. Once most of the losses and damages had been taken care of, and the greater part of the London Wizarding community had recovered, there arose questions of needing a new leader for the fallen Wizarding community. Thankfully it was near unanimous decision that Kingsley Shacklebolt be voted into office as the new Minister of Magic.
“As it is stated by the law,” Kingsley continued. “Any person—wizard or witch, who wishes to be inducted into the Department of Aurors, must first undergo a series of training to be conducted by a senior mentor in the Department. Once that mentor has deemed the trainee to be competent in both mind and body while out on the job—he may recommend that trainee to be considered for complete initiation into the Department of Aurors, with a rank of full-fledged Auror.”
Blackwell nodded and turned to Harry's bed, the closest of the two patients to him. "He was stable when he came out of surgery—what happened?" He examined Harry's face and took his pulse, pausing at the elevated beat beneath his fingers.
Harry exhaled in annoyance and turned his attention back to Davies, who began to personally inspect the wound.
Kingsley nodded solemnly. “When Aurors decide to become partners, their first and foremost priority is the protection of themselves, and their partner. The contract is just to help enforce the seriousness of that.”
that the two of you aren’t children that I’m not going easy on you. Believe me, I’d like to get away without harming either of you, but....”
Harry turned around stiffly as the sound of heavy oak doors being opened filled the office. The sound stopped, and a tall, blonde figure strolled into the room. Apparently he wasn’t expecting anybody but the Minister, for a sleek blonde brow rose in surprise upon seeing Harry standing next to the desk.
"Minister, may I suggest that you conduct an investigation as to what's been going on here? Clearly this man isn't sane!"
Hermione turned and sent a scowl to the redhead. “I’m not your property, Ronald. I’m free to choose how I would like to be addressed...”
“It depends on the people, really.,” Kingsley responded easily, chuckling slightly. “I’ll admit, there have been some rather atrocious ones in the past—such as;
“Bloody hell, I can’t take this anymore....” Draco sighed with a groan, leaning against the counter and cradling his head in his hand.
“Fine,” Harry scowled , snatching the quill from Kingsley and jotting down his request on the open line.
He kissed a trail across Harry's jawline and down his neck, savoring in the feel and taste of the other man's skin. Draco couldn't resist the temptation and began sucking and nipping at a strip of the lovely white neck—lavishing his lover's neck and creating a dark red love mark there.
“Don’t worry, I’m polite enough to know when I’ve worn out my welcome~ I’ll get leaving so you two can continue your shag that I interrupted earlier.”
Surprisingly, the nurse relented pretty easily. “Of course, Minister.” She almost looked relieved, as if she had secretly wanted him to go anyways. “If you’ll follow me this way...”
“Well, just let me know later how you’re feeling—can’t have you kids sick out on your first assignment tomorrow!” Kingsley managed to say brightly, drawing looks of horror from the two boys.
“Oh?” That pulled a surprised looked from Blaise before it quickly turned into a mischievous smirk. “Got a hot date~?”
"I don't want to be known anymore as the pureblooded snob Draco Malfoy, son of a Death Eater and hater of Muggles and Muggleborns."
Harry watched in horror as she too collapsed on the floor, falling closely beside the large redhead.
Without a word, Kingsley slowly strode over to the bed—his feet shuffling softly against the linoleum. Florence followed a few steps behind, nearly holding his breath as he finally reached the side of the bed.
The sight of blood caused Draco to abandon reason and he turned his back on the snatcher, running the short distance to where Harry lay. He dropped to his knees and ripped open Harry’s coat, then his button-down shirt—surveying the damage that the jinx had caused. A large gash running diagonally from Harry’s left shoulder down near his right hip was carved into his flesh—glittering drops of scarlet blood seeping out from the fresh wound. Draco’s breathing quickened and his heart hammered loudly in his chest. He knew he had to do something or Harry could die. He raised a shaky hand and quickly began to chant healing spells—his wand emitting ribbons of bluish-green light that bled into Harry’s chest. Using his other hand, Draco brought his pale fingers to Harry’s neck, checking for a pulse.
"It was at this point," Davies continued, ignoring Florence, "that we realized that if Mr. Potter had been cursed with dark magic, then there was a good chance that Mr. Malfoy has been as well."
"We both know that you would rather go straight to Azkaban and beg my father for my hand in marriage than go one night without sleeping with me.”
“Come to think of it, you two can never seem to beat me at a bet—can you~?” The dark skinned wizard crooned gleefully, earning scowls from both Theo and Pansy.
Kingsley nodded. "Yes. Based on your information, it's safe to say that dark curse Mr. Malfoy was referring to was the one that's causing this damage..."
"Look you two, I really am sorry.....for...a lot of things...." The dark haired male began quietly, fixing them both with an apologetic look. "I just....I think it'll be better if we sit down and talk....I can explain how this all happened.."
Harry smirked and returned the kiss with one of his own as he rolled off of the bed and stretched his arms over his head.
, Blaise,” Draco sighed in annoyance, as if he was so much more knowledgeable in the realm of muggle objects than his dark skinned friend.
....." Harry groaned and arched his back in pleasure at the sensation on his neck—though that wasn't the only place he was feeling it.
“Wonder what his problem is.......,” He mumbled with a frown, finally directing his gaze up towards the screen mounted across from him on the wall. “Ah yeah! I love The Great British Bake Off!”
“Anyways, I found out that Dray Dray was dating someone about 6 or 7 months ago, but I didn’t come to find that it was the boy wonder until quite recently, though I did have my suspicions...” He trailed off with a mischievous smirk, and all three Gryffindors shuddered at the lethal sheen in his eyes.
“Well, I’m Theodore Nott—please just call me Theo though. Friend of Draco’s since we were kids...I’m now a Healer at St. Mungo’s that specializes in the use of potions for anesthetic as well as for the purpose of healing ailments.”
Harry and Draco glanced over at Florence, who gestured for them to follow him up to the podium where Kingsley stood.
"What Blackwell is trying to say," Davies cut in, "is that now based on the report that we have, we can guess with almost certainty that Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy were most likely hit with the same spell. Likely, one of the wizards they were up against hit them together with the same curse—which means that however that curse affects one of them, it'll affect the other one just the same."
Working together as Aurors for the Ministry as well allowed them to keep the pretense of their relationship as merely partners, so Draco seemed to see no reason in alerting the rest of their colleagues in the department of their true relationship, so all in all—Draco wasn't the least bit concerned about inviting others into their private lives and sharing their secret with them.
This exchange went unnoticed as everyone else had there attention directed towards Hermione with interest—whether feigned or not.
“Ah, I think that’s enough of the story for now. Shall we order our food now?” he suggested innocently, hiding the wide grin that he wanted to display behind a mask of feigned indifference.
"Alright, I'll give you that one..." Harry replied with a slight laugh, reaching his hands up to hook around the blonde's neck as he hovered on top of him.
Harry looked down at the offending item in his hands then up at his lover with a frown. "What's wrong with it? I like this one."
Just then a chorus of low voices could be heard in the hallway, gaining volume slightly as they approached the door that Florence and Kingsley had entered not long before.
Draco quirked his lip in annoyance at the name, but widely chose not to comment—receiving a few gentle strokes to back of his hand as a reward for his compliance.
Kingsley cracked a small grin as Harry suddenly bolted up and brushed his clothes furiously, glancing around wildly.
“Why not? Then I can have a good view!” Draco stated with a mischievous smirk, plopping down on the couch and earning a puzzled frown from the darker haired wizard.
....h-h-he's not actually...." For nearly the first time in her life, Hermione was speechless—stammering as she glanced wide eyed at the blob platinum blonde hair still nestled in the space between Harry's legs with a glimmer of horrifying recognition. Ron turned his gaze as well and looked like he was about to be sick.
“We really have to make the Unbreakable Vow, don’t we...,” Draco murmured aloud, more to himself than anyone else.
"It's alright now Harry. What's important is that you're both safe and sound," Kingsley soothed with his deep and calming voice.
"You want to continue with what we were doing earlier." Draco replied with low growl, guiding them over to the couch and pushing Harry down.
"I thought you said they were coming at 4...." The Slytherin drawled in amusement, causing Harry to snap out of his frozen state and turn a miserable look to the blonde.
"The scan in question revealed dark magic in both boys' bodies, in the same areas. This dark magic, unlike the kind that we dispelled from them, showed no signs of causing any sort of damage within either wizard's system. We ran many different tests on both of the boys, but nothing that we did seemed to affect the magic in anyway. So—while we waited for all of the results from those scans to be brought to us so we could study them further—we finally decided that we would take Mr. Malfoy out of surgery first and see how he would do after the anesthesia potions that we administered had worn off. Meanwhile, we would continue to monitor Mr. Potter under anesthesia while we continuing to try some... different methods of expelling the dark magic." Davies paused—waiting for a reaction.
The blonde huffed and pouted his lips. “Well my Slytherin intellect is telling me that you’re gonna need every ounce of that Gryffindor bravery to survive this afternoon...”
Harry chuckled a bit and rolled his eyes. “Yes, yes, I won’t. But as I stated earlier—I wasn’t conscious for most of this part of the story, so there wouldn’t be much for me to give way anyways.”
“Turning your back to your opponent in battle? Tsk, tsk young Mr. Malfoy,” The snatcher murmured. “I think you’re in no position to follow us now....But just so you learn your lesson, I’ll bestow a small parting gift before I leave.” He smirked and raised his wand a final time, sending a spell flying towards the two boys.
Kingsley glanced down at the piece of parchment in front of him for formality. It wasn’t like he really needed to remember the two names he was going to be calling—but he did so just to keep with the tradition.
Florence sat back down and shook his head sadly. “The message that Draco sent didn’t give much information—all I could tell is that it was desperate. He was out of breath and asking for back-up....he said something about being surrounded by snatchers and Harry trying to take them on....that’s all the message said, so I immediately rounded up a rescue team.” He took a breath and Kingsley nodded.
The “cutesy” voice and pout that Blaise adopted merely prompted a scathing eye roll from the other Slytherin. No one except for Draco would ever know that the cool Italian playboy that broke hearts on a daily basis would have such a side to him—watching muggle cooking shows and trying to act cute to get his way.
“So who else should I expect to be seeing here? You invited a few of your mates, Potter?” Blaise asked with an easy smile as he noticed Harry glancing backwards towards the entrance every so often.
Harry sighed and raked a hand through his dark, unruly hair and paced around the living room of their apartment. When questioned by his friends and pseudo family about having a lover, he outright lied to them......many.....many...
“Potter, stop it.” Draco grunted painfully as Harry redoubled his efforts to free himself from Draco’s hold. “We can’t take them on our own—we’ll retreat and then call the Ministry for back up!”
He glanced down at the wand in his hand a gave a small self-deprecating snicker. You'd think that a seasoned 22 year old wizard, vanquisher of Voldemort and savior of the Wizarding World would be able to perform a simple 1st Year Charm spell non-verbally—but, after trying and failing miserably before to do so an occasion before (resulting in marinara sauce being flung all around the kitchen, and a less than thrilled Draco banning him from trying the spell non-verbally again) he'd kept to his promise and had so far refrained from testing it out again.
Harry gazed worriedly at Hermione and Ron as they traded suspicious glances. He wondered if he should intervene, but before he could open his mouth, Blaise had already risen from his seat and strolled around the table to greet the new faces.
A sudden sound made Harry jerk in surprise, and alerted the couple to the presence of company in their living room.
Healer Davies merely grinned. It was an infuriating type of grin that seemed to hint towards the man's arrogance. "Perhaps it would be better if we have Mr. Potter in here as well. Then I'll only have to explain this once."
Draco opened his mouth to respond, but Harry cut him off before he had the chance. “Ron, honestly it’s fine. Between what Draco told me, and what the other witnesses recounted to me after I came to—I pretty much deduced what had happened and it all seemed in line with the story that Draco had recalled.”
Draco raised his hands slightly and shrugged. “Nothing, just surprised that you guys got married so young is all...”
A collective nod of heads bobbed around the table. Hermione frowned and opened her mouth, looking like she wanted to say something—then closed it again with a deeper frown.
“Ah, well...it’s best to be on the safe side....,” Blaise relented with a sigh, searching around for something. “Where’s the control stick for the Telly?”
“Uh, gee—I don’t know Hermione, maybe...?” He replied vaguely, scratching the back of his neck as tried to appear as though he knew full well what she had asked him.
"How...do you know about Chinese take out food?" Hermione asked hesitantly, looking over the food in front of her curiously.
"Well, Uh....you were just here....a little bit ago.....before you passed out from the wards......." The dark haired wizard supplied slowly—desperately praying though, that it wouldn't trigger any lightbulbs.
“Ah Potter, what time can we expect the rest of our company to arrive at?” Blaise cut in suddenly, trying to steer the mood away from quiet and depressing.
Before any member of the room could utter a response, Healer Davies clapped his hands again. This time, the door to the infirmary suddenly opened, and several more witches busted through. In the middle of their huddled group was a medical bed, identical to the one that Draco was lain on. As the witches progressed further into the room, they pushed and pulled the bed along with them—wheeling it all the way into the room until it was parked in the middle of the space.
“Don’t worry, it’ll be done and over before you know it,” He assured quietly, removing his wand from the confines of his silk robes and raising it slightly. “Now face each other, please.”
“I would like to know the status of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. They were brought in a few hours ago and we haven’t heard anything since.”
Knightly squinted at Blackwell. "Now I'm not some smarty-pants healer like you folk, but I'm pretty sure you just repeated everything that we already know, and just phrased it differently."
"1...2...!" Blackwell and Davies both opened the jars and held them underneath the noses of their respective patients. After a moment, they both retreated and Blackwell passed his jar back to Davies.
A loud banging suddenly filled the room as Kingsley knocked his gavel against the podium, and a hush grew across the room once again. All eyes turned to the Minister as he held up the contract for all to see.
“-Oi! Draco!” Harry protested as he was successfully tugged backwards and fell back onto the couch. The blonde wasted no time in quickly capturing his prey—climbing on top of the Gryffindor with a seductive smirk.
“Nervous boys?” He whispered brightly as he stopped between them. Neither answered, and that spoke loud enough to Florence. “Don’t worry, everything’ll be just splendid.”
Kingsley sighed and stepped forward, rubbing his temples. “After Florence and his team of Aurors found the two of you, they brought you straight here and you were both taken to the critical care ward—which is where we are now. After a few hours, we were told that you were out of surgery and in here—but Harry is still being tended to.”
“Alright, so let me go over this one more time.” Florence Knightly pushed his glasses up his nose slightly as he glanced at the piece of parchment he was holding. “You two, Potter and Malfoy, have been assigned by the Ministry to complete your first assignment as Auror partners together today.”
He paused and Draco continued where he left off with a roll of his eyes. “Since we were the only two present when those...
While the three Gryffindor’s gaped, Blaise merely snickered and moved around the table to where the coffee cups had been placed. “Now now—this can’t be helped. Potter’s not used to being hit on, and Draco’s never had anyone he needed to be jealous of, so of course you’re both going to have opposing opinions on the matter~”
“Dracoooooo!” Pansy whined, tapping her feet on the ground anxiously. “You can’t just stop on a cliffhanger like that! Tell us what happened next!”
Hermione and Ron sat at the table, both somewhat shell shocked at the unbelievable story that they were being told.
