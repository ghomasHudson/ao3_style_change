“I am. You and Potter might be the only people who remember this man is dead and the odd circumstances surrounding it. I’m sure they will send Unspeakables to relieve the aurors at the party to wipe their memories, too. I need you to figure out why the Unspeakables are wiping cases from our minds and if it has anything to do with these so-called magical surges.”
“Indeed, and tomorrow when you wake up, you will either remember this and regret it, or not remember it, and I will regret it. So, if you would?”
“You’re on thin ice.” It took everything I had not to hit her with a hex and kick her through the floo.
A half hour later, Draco broke their unspoken pact of silent wallowing and said, “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“Yes, we do because I’ve waited and waited for something like this my whole life. To feel the way I feel when I’m with you. I’m done waiting, Draco. I died last year, don’t you get it?” Harry’s voice quivered and he couldn’t keep the tears from falling. They ran hot down his cheeks. “I died, and came back and have a second chance at a normal life. I won't squander that chance by being scared of what everyone else thinks.”
Hermione was wearing a tight navy blue dress that was off the shoulder. Her hair was in a complicated looking updo. Ron was wearing gray pants and a soft blue button up. They looked like they were heading out on a fancy date and it made me feel like an interloper. It was not a promising start to the day, but I was on time and I was sober.
I was almost about to say ‘I knew,’ but then Ginny and her date appeared at the front door. Dean was ushering them inside. Her hair was shorter than the last time I saw her. Bobbing just above her shoulders. It made her look older, more mature. Her hand was interlaced with a woman’s, whose back was turned. I could see short cropped jet black hair. She turned around and I recognized Ginny’s date. Pansy Parkinson, author of all those romance novels I read and Malfoy’s best friend. Great. As if today needed anymore surprises.
“I like the two of you for each other. We spent a lot of time together working on his potion, you know? Lots of lunches. He’s actually quite funny, not to mention absolutely striking.”
“I suppose,” Mr. Potter answered and pulled Draco back in and began to sway again, “but they clearly affected you and therefore, are of consequence to me.”
Letter sent, Harry meets Draco and Luna at the Leaky for lunch to plan the stag night, and Luna reveals a little tidbit of info that’s got Harry thinking.
Potter whistled as he took in the sitting room. “Nice room. Very Victorian Earl sitting by the fire after a dinner party.” He nodded towards the tea and added, “Though, don’t they usually drink brandy and smoke cigars or something else ridiculous like that?”
Head back in the game, or at least partially back since Harry was still letting his eyes rake along the line of muscle in Draco’s thigh, Harry noticed the snitch was buzzing next to Draco for a full minute before Draco tore his gaze from Harry’s chest long enough to snatch it out of the air.
“Potter, don’t be daft,” Malfoy called to him from behind, his voice sounding groggy as if he’d just awoken from a nap. He pulled out his wand. Even from a foot away, Harry still felt the magic of Malfoy’s Hawthorn wand call to him. He’d used it during the war and returned it to Malfoy after his trial cleared him. It seemed the wand still liked him. He often wondered if Malfoy hated that his wand had worked for Harry.
It was footsteps. The students had all been shuffled to the memorial, so it was either a house elf or a professor, so I opted for simply turning around instead of hitting them with an expelliarmus that would knock the wind out of them.
“Look, I don’t like you Potter. I think you aren’t cut out for this job with all your reckless behavior, but more importantly, I’ve believed that the Unspeakables have been wiping auror’s memories for a while now. In fact, I am sure they wiped my own memory. Whoever did it was sloppy, or new, or maybe they were in a rush, but they accidentally wiped too much of it. I lost a whole day, one that I spent with my wife and child. One they still talk about often because they had such a good time. I can’t remember one minute of it. And there have been three other cases of aurors loosing time in the last month alone. All responded to an unusual magic use call. I never filed the medical reports because each of them lost that time after a briefing with the Unspeakables on a case. That’s when I started suspecting them.”
“You okay?” Potter asked, closing the door behind them. He clicked the lock into place and Draco felt his heart leap into his throat. He had to be dreaming. There was no way this was actually happening. He would wake up tomorrow and this will have all been a dream.
Finally Draco understood all those stupid Victorian romance novels his mother had made him read growing up. He’d thought them all ridiculous, getting flustered over something as innocent as a compliment from their love interest. And Potter hadn’t even directly complimented him, yet the feeling of falling consumed Draco to his core until he thought he might never feel surefooted again.
“Try to have fun. You are young, start over. Always time to start over.” Draco looked away and watched Potter and his friends again. They looked happy. He felt a jolt of jealousy and realized that he wanted that. He wanted
“That’s sort of how love goes, though, isn’t it?” Ginny said in a perfect impersonation of Luna whenever she brought up Nargals, or some other creature Harry had never heard of until that moment.
“Avoiding small talk,” I joked. Well, half joked. Neville smiled at that and shook his head. “Also wanted to come say hi.”
Draco was half-turned away when Harry’s hand, much to Harry’s own surprise, was around Draco’s wrist, pulling Draco back to face him. “Of course, I’ll write the letter. When is it due?”
Sometimes, it was his insecurities that Draco would pick at like a dead carcass. Shredding him to bits until all that was left was bone. Other times, he would notice Harry’s mood shift—when Harry was sure no one was watching—and seem to watch and wait for Harry to admit that he wasn’t happy.
Lucius seemed to consider Draco before continuing. A soft smile took up residence where usually a scowl was present. “Where were you last night after showing Nikola the cellar?”
“She’s desperate,” Harry found himself saying. His conversation with the Succubus the night before was still a bit hazy, like he was seeing it through gauze, but he remembered some of the things she’d said. “She told me she wasn’t a picky eater anymore.”
“Inform the Unspeakables,” Robards instructed Reed. She nodded and then headed back to the apparition point. “Maybe those mask-wearing twats have something stronger to trace the magic since they just love hoarding all the good spells for themselves.”
“I can tell that you haven’t been touched by another in two years. You barely even touch yourself, but when you do… you think of
“Yes,” he answered. Boldly, he slipped his hand into Potter’s and intertwined their fingers. Potter smiled and Draco decided he didn’t care what the question was, as long as Potter kept looking at him like that.
There was a cracking sound and part of the mausoleum wall broke free just above Harry’s head. Particles and small pieces of stone rained down on him as the Succubus threw the stone across the room to Malfoy.
Harry glared defiantly at Draco and bit his bottom lip. “Yes, I remember.” He crossed his arms over his chest.
“Collectin’ some o’ the ingredients yeh two disappeared, aren’ we?” Hagrid said. He laughed and then shoved a few jars each into Harry and Malfoy’s hands.
I nodded. “Of course, sir.” Fighting with him would get me no where. It was better to let him think he was in control. I could get more done that way. I needed to find out who killed the caretaker. It was connected to the magical surges somehow. Maybe someone killed him to shut him up. Maybe he had another magical surge and was too weak from his previous ones to handle another. And maybe it was something else all together.
“And I’m supposed to share?” Draco laughed. He looked around at the other drinks tables. “There is likely plenty more whisky somewhere else, Potter.”
Nikola, managing to undo Draco’s trousers, was slowly pulling them to pool around his ankles. Again, it hit him that Potter was there—watching. He felt his cock twitch at the thought and then hot breath was ghosting over his groin.
“Quinten said they’ve only been on a few dates. Haven't even kissed yet,” Neville answered and then looked as if he had seen a ghost. His face went white and he nervously ran his fingers through his hair. “Don't tell anyone I told you that, okay?”
“Yes, it is,” Nikola replied politely, taking a sip of whiskey from the crystal glasses which were also reserved for occasions where people were to be impressed.
Ron nodded. “True.” He shifted in his chair, scooting it closer to the table, and then laid his arms flat on the surface. He tried a soft smile, but then it shifted to a concerned look.
Without another word, Ron cast a perimeter spell to see if anyone else was still in the cemetery. It came back negative, lighting up red.
When we arrived back at the front of the yard, more people had shuffled in and stood in small clumps around the tables. Some of them I recognized from school, some from the Ministry, but there were more people that I didn’t recognize.
His wand felt alive in his hand, it pulsed as he gripped it. The wood scraping along his skin, the magic sparking as he stepped out of the mausoleum and sent up red sparks for his partner. Miraculously, the spell worked. They had a Succubus to capture.
Licking his lips, Charlie sighed and leaned his forehead against Harry’s. Their lips were breathes apart and Harry couldn’t feel his hands or feet. They were a mess of pins and needles as he waited to see if Charlie was going to do anything.
My mouth was dry. I felt my magic agitated under my skin. This was usually about the time I would grab a drink to quiet the magic pulsing throughout my body. To numb the thoughts that always threatened to bring up things best buried.
His arousal had been a surprise the first time he struck Potter. Not once had Draco ever considered Potter sexually. He considered him as an enemy, as an annoyance, but never as someone attractive. Though it was
“Thank you,” Neville said when everyone was paying attention. “We are so happy you all could make it out to celebrate with us.” Neville paused and there were a few hoots and hollers from the small crowd. Harry spotted Dean and Seamus, both of whom were cupping their mouths. Neville laughed and continued, “This has been a year full of growth and happiness, and the icing on the cake was when Luna agreed to marry me. We are both so unbelievably in love.”
Harry turned to face his partner and felt his breath hitch when he realised how close their faces were. With the shielding of the potion at full effect now, Harry could no longer deny that he was attracted to Malfoy. “Uh...we, well, we trap her in the Lock Box, obviously.”
Neville raised his eyebrows. “Sheesh, they are loved aren't they?” He looked around at the crowd. “I doubt I know this many people, let alone that they all like me enough to show up to a party like this.”
Draco attempted to be happy for his friend, but found himself sulking. If Pansy were to gain favor, she may be forced to no longer acquaint herself with Draco. That would leave him scrounging around at the bottom of society life all by himself. He tried not to scowl at the thought since he was often reminded his scowl was unattractive.
He looked around and saw some discarded clothes in a corner; a few sparkling dresses that no doubt fit the Succubus much like the slinky black dress he’d met her in. A shiver ran up his spine at the memory. Kissing her had felt so good, and if he hadn’t been lucky...he would have let her kiss him until he was as dead as everyone in this cemetery.
Potter let out a frustrated growl that startled Raul, the Minister’s secretary, as he walked past. The poor bloke dropped his file and almost dropped the coffee he carried with it. To add to the already alarming display of masculinity, Potter slammed his fist down on the table and said, “Where’s that damned map?”
“Look, let’s just forget it for now.” Malfoy sighed. “I’m not giving you the potion and whatever was happening between us is, well I don’t know, so if that’s all?” He looked down at our hands and I felt him loosen the grip.
“You know you were young yourself,” Draco pointed out. “Too young to have bored yourself with being head of a school.”
Draco fought against the spell. He struggled to form the words, but eventually he pushed through his father’s hold and asked the question he feared an answer to. “He—he wants it for Potter, doesn’t he?”
Draco took a beat, seeming to consider his response as though he wasn’t sure how much to share with Harry, then nodded. “Mother tried a marriage set-up. This time with some Russian witch who was as straight as me.”
“What is it your big old brain is debating about?” Harry matched Draco’s position so he could get a look at Draco’s face. Harry wanted to see Draco’s smokey grey eyes because his tone could conceal his feelings, but not those eyes.
“She is right perceptive, that one,” Ron agreed and smiled to himself. After finishing the last dregs of the firewhiskey in his cup, Ron placed it on the table next to the forgotten dinner plates and
Draco smiled, but it didn’t quite touch his eyes. “Slow going, but good. Really good. Magnus lets me have pretty much free reign of the place now. I’m learning a lot.”
Before anyone could answer, the door to the shop swung open accompanied by a small bell ringing. Harry turned around to see Draco, his white-blonde hair windswept, a pale blue scarf tucked around his neck, wearing a long black cloak.
From that far away, Harry could see every feature on Malfoy’s face. The small lines at the corner of his eyes. The gray of his iris’ surrounded by a ring of black with blue-ish flecks that made his eyes look billowy like smoke billowing from a fireplace. A small sprinkling of freckles across his cheeks and nose, which was pointy, but also elegant. Thin, pink lips that Harry found himself looking at for a beat too long.
“Tone, Draco,” Lucius reprimanded and Draco felt ill suddenly. All the calm he felt upon waking was slowly receding like the tides. “Do you recall how Goyle royally fucked up relations between the Dark Lord and Russia?”
Harry nodded. “Yes, like that. Or is there a section of grass that you can’t seem to keep green? Anything like that.”
“I don’t want to fight with you either, Harry. I’m just worried about you. We all are. I mean, we expected you to need time after the war to process things, but it’s been five years and sometimes I worry that you’re worse off now then you were five months after the war.”
Dean had jumped in front of the curse, the green flash of magic crashing into his chest, and died in Harry’s arms while the culprit made a quick exit. Harry had searched and searched for Dean’s killer after. Months of searching the lowest, grimiest places of wizarding London until he’d found him and apprehended him. The man was rotting in Azkaban, but it hadn’t brought Dean back. It hadn’t erased the fact that someone else had died for Harry.
Finally, Draco made eye contact. It was a searching look. And unsure look. Then Draco asked, “And your answer?”
“I know. Last week it was a picture of you punching a perp out in Diagon Alley after he tried to run off with some ladies purse and the week before it was a feature on how Harry Potter doesn’t even need his wand anymore thanks to your drunk boasting at Dean and Seamus’s wedding. And before that, there was a feature on you at a quidditch match getting caught coming out of the locker rooms looking like you fucked the whole Hollyhead lineup. Not to mention their lovely piece about the Boy Who Lived being put on desk duty for ‘reasons unknown.’ They really loved that one.”
“Did I freak you out?” Charlie asked as he sat down next to Harry. He sat close and shoved Harry with his shoulder. It was meant to be affectionate, as it was so often how Charlie had approached Harry at the Burrow in the days after the war.
“I am not against polite conversation, if that is what you mean to imply. It is simply that I do not know what you would like to hear, Mr. Potter. Why not tell me what to say and I will say it?”
Potter let a sheepish grin spread across his face that nearly made Draco melt into his shoes. “Hermione, she, uh, she made me memorise it, and once something is up there,” he said pointing to his temple, “it stays. It was just lucky Ron and I were talking about it today, or I might not have noticed at all.”
I listened to his soft moans echo off the stone walls and slowed my rhythm, stopping at the tip to flick my tongue around the head. I felt his cock twitch and knew he was close, so I took him into my mouth all the way and let him fuck my mouth. His hands found purchase in my hair and he thrusted into me, his breath quickening and his legs tensing until he climaxed.
“Reed, wait,” I shouted. She stopped in her tracks and turned back to look over her shoulder. I was taking a gamble, but I needed to solve this and I couldn’t do that with a memory wipe. I turned to face Robards. “Look, I know you have no reason to trust me on this, but if you bring the Unspeakables here, they will cover this up.”
,” Harry shouted without warning. His magic pulsed in him, pushing out through the wand, but all that came out were red sparks.
Ron made a face that seemed to say ‘well, that’s Ginny for you,’ and then asked, “Well, now that it’s out there, are you going to do something about it or sit on your arse and whine like a toddler?”
The only thing racing through Harry’s mind as they waited in line behind some sixth years Harry didn’t know, was the fact that Draco was still holding his hand. The need for it had expired the second Draco led Harry to the line, yet there it remained, wrapped around Harry’s hand, the faint pulse in Draco’s wrist pumping against Harry’s own.
Flame burst forth out of his wand, hitting the Succubus square in the chest. She hissed in response, her flesh singed. Harry felt the last of her hold on him falter when the smell of her burning flesh reached his nose. It was the best smell in the world because he was thinking clearly now.
Unfortunately, Draco found himself caring about Mr. Potter’s opinion in his current state, though he would be remiss to admit to it aloud. He worked to foster a new image of himself, one that rejected his previous misgivings and misalliances. Partly, it was in hopes of attracting the attentions of Mr. Potter, who he fancied for some time, foolhardy as it was, and partly, he had been able to see the errors of his ways and a genuine change had not been completely unfavorable.
I blinked my eyes open, thankful that my glasses were still on my face because I got to see the pure and utter shock on Ron’s face as if I had come back from the dead as a zombie. “Hi,” I said weakly.
“Oh, do shut up.” Malfoy flicked his wand, whispered the spell to seal the box, and within the blink of an eye, the Succubus was sucked into the Lock Box where she would spend the rest of her immortality, trapped. Looks like she managed to find that loophole after all.
“Okay.” Harry braced himself to say something he hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione for fear that they wouldn’t understand. “My whole life, people have expected certain things from me, right?”
“Are you mad?” Draco’s eyes searched Harry’s face for something. He didn’t seem to find it, though because he frowned. Yet, he didn’t back away. “It’s ridiculous.”
“Are you still up for this?” Harry asked, an edge to his voice that he hadn’t entirely meant, at least hadn’t meant it towards Malfoy. He knew he had made a mistake going after that thing last night without backup. He could have easily called Malfoy and they could have gone after it together, but he didn’t like the idea of needing anyone, not after he got so many people killed in the war, not after Dean. And now a woman was dead because of his arrogance.
Ron’s face was turning red. It did that when he was frustrated. “They obliviated Robards, too. Probably Lamont and Reed, as well as any auror at the party. Would have done us if Robards hadn’t tricked them into thinking he already did us.”
The room got quiet for a moment as a the song changed from The Weird Sisters to Celestina Warbeck. The mood went from rowdy to suddenly romantic. Someone, probably Stav, even charmed the lights to dim. And many of the party-goers started to slow dance and snog.
Malfoy bit his lip to keep from smirking. “Well, are we going to get to it soon, Potter? I do have other business to attend to. Despite what you think, the world does not stop for you.”
He was going to have to stand opposite Draco during the wedding ceremony. And he was also going to have to do it with Ginny there, staring. He’d been in worse situations, he told himself. How bad could this be compared to Voldemort? He just had to write a character letter for his ex-boyfriend, which would bring up all sorts of feelings he’d been ignoring since their break-up, and be the best man to Draco’s best man of honor. No biggie.
Harry tried to focus on the task at hand, but the magic moving through him was distracting. It warmed his stomach as if he’d just finished off a hot cocoa near the fire. Then, as if hit with ice-cold water, he felt suddenly awake. He could feel every nerve ending. All the places his clothes touched his skin felt like someone was tickling him with feathers. He had to contain the resulting giggle.
“Just that Hermione is the best of us,” I called back. My eyes met Malfoy’s as I spoke. He smirked at me. It was brief, gone from his face in one breath. It felt like it was only for me.
The green flames of the Floo flickered as he stepped through into the lobby of the Ministry expecting to see Malfoy waiting for him, but his partner was nowhere to be seen. Curious. Well, not so curious. Malfoy had just confessed that he was attracted to Harry and he hadn’t seemed too happy about admitting it. Could he have travelled home without Harry realising?
Harry shuffled the deck of Exploding Snap cards that he knew Neville kept in his office desk drawer while he waited for him to come back. The greenhouse where Neville worked was a little out of the way, but Harry decided to drop in and visit his old schoolmate before Quidditch practice that night, and possibly to spy on this man that was dating the man that he, Harry, loved.
To Harry’s surprise, Draco agreed heartily and let a snitch go, kicked off the dirt and called back to Harry: ‘last one to the snitch is a flobberworm.’ Harry hadn’t even minded that Draco got a head start.
“Does anyone know that we…” Harry cut himself off because he could hear the quiet desperation in his voice. It had been nagging at him for a while now, but he wasn’t sure how to put into words what he wanted to ask.
“The bloke has always been off his rocker, Reed,” Lamont said. There was some rummaging as if he was going through some papers. “Robards thinks so and this just proves it.”
“My fault?” Harry blurted out. His anger finally getting the best of him. “If you hadn’t been so clumsy…”
In a far corner, Harry spotted Draco with Quinten. It made his stomach lurch. Harry couldn’t help wonder if Draco had read the article in yesterday’s paper. Luna had done a wonderful job with it. It was a classy denial of his relationship with Ginny and the small but important part about him liking men.
Draco straightened his back, swallowed the retort about protocol he’d been about to say for the sake of progress, and instead, he said, “No, of course not, we can send him a letter from the Potions lab. That way, we can tell him our theory, and get the potion at the same time.”
“Well then, Ned, I’m pleased to make your acquaintance. I am Auror Malfoy and this is my partner, Auror Potter. We were hoping you could help us.”
Neville put his hand over mine and brought it a little higher up his thigh. He closed his eyes and breathed hard once. “Merlin, it’s tempting, but I’m not looking for a quick fuck anymore, Harry. That’s all you’d be offering, right?”
Neville smiled. “Is it any wonder Witch Weekly calls you unbelievably tempting?” He brought his fingers up to his collar and tugged on it a bit, undoing a third button.
Without answering, Mrs. Granger placed her hand in Pansy’s. She turned to Mr. Potter and smiled, searching for something in his expression, and when she seemed satisfied he would not object to her leaving, she nodded at Pansy and they headed into the crowd.
“Course not, mate. Plus, I’m not sure it’s serious yet,” Neville mused. He looked truly concerned for Harry’s dating situation. No doubt, he shared the same worry that all his mates shared which was that Harry would end up old and alone. Most everyone else had at least been dating since the war, if not settled down like Ron and Hermione.
Hermione waved her off. “Hey, you didn’t walk away. That’s more than most people do.” Then she headed for one of the tables, leaving Harry and Ginny alone.
Malfoy’s smile abruptly shifted into a frown. It was so sudden, Harry wondered if he’d said something offensive and somehow missed it in his heady, aroused state. He opened his mouth to ask, but then the line moved forward and they were next up. The witch behind the counter looked up and gasped when she saw him. “Oh, Mr Potter, Auror Potter, sir, how may I help you?”
“Only if you want to, of course.” Potter resumed his walking about the room. He stopped in front of a portrait of Draco that his mother had commissioned when he turned eighteen. Draco hated it, but his mother insisted on hanging it in the sitting room. The portrait itself was life-size and in it, Draco stood behind a high-backed chair with one hand resting on the chair and the other tucked away in his trouser pocket.
Dead birds. Harry mulled over what that could mean. Usually, animal deaths happened when someone was messing with Black Magic. It signalled a power imbalance, if he remembered Hermione’s lecture properly. Since the Succubus was the embodiment of Black Magic after compromising her human self for immortality, it could be that her magic mixed with the Ley Lines was creating the imbalance.
Mr. Potter’s voice was a low rumble when he spoke, “Frivolity can be enjoyable on occasion. Can it not?”
“This is a nice festival,” he said, expertly ignoring Harry’s jibe. “Celebrating the Solstice and the graduating students and the future and all that. People should be enjoying it.
Quickly, Draco scanned the room. Toilet. Sink. Judgemental bronze face on the mirror. Then he spotted a small wooden cabinet to the side of the sink that was the same dark wood the walls were made of—he would have missed it if he hadn’t been looking. It was locked, but a quick wandless
Fuck. All my reckless behavior was finally catching up with me. I was too drunk to care what they wrote most of the time. Only about half of it was true, but that didn’t matter. “I wouldn’t do that to her, Pansy, or to you, even though you are the biggest prick I have ever met. I’m not that big of a cock.”
which she turned into a book. Most of it was rubbish and made me out to be this perfect hero who never faltered and always had a ‘knowing smile on my face.’ The actuality of me would be a let down for most of London, so I let them all think what they wanted. It was easier that way.
even bothered to come through or agree to speak at the memorial. “I had to do something, so I did. And maybe we shouldn’t be moving on, Ron. Did that ever cross your mind? Maybe we shouldn’t pretend that because Voldemort is dead that all the ugliness in the world died with him.”
approaching us. Their long black robes flapped in the wind as it kicked up. At the front of the group was Robards. He was tall. At least six-five with broad shoulders and a face that wasn’t unattractive but also wasn’t memorable. His light blonde hair made him more noticeable than most, but it wasn’t striking. It was normal. His gaze landed on me and I could almost feel the disgust in that stare. It wasn’t exactly malicious. More annoyed. Officially, I was on desk duty so being at a crime scene would mean a ton of paperwork and explaining on his part.
“He is quite beautiful, isn’t he?” Luna asked quietly, turning her attention from Potter to Draco, whose stomach had just jumped into his chest with all the force of a bludger.
She had a point. If something went wrong, it would be on her, and like Draco, Pansy had spent the better part of the last five years undoing all the damage her family and the war had done. Nothing mattered to her more than regaining some semblance of a reputation.
Harry smiled at that. He knew Draco hated playing chess with Ron because he was the only person Draco couldn’t beat. He grabbed Draco’s slender hands in his and brought them to his chest. Harry took in one deep breath, and said, “Move in with me, Draco. After school.”
“Potter, talk to me,” Draco said as he rushed to grab the Lock Box once it closed. He picked it up, it was cold to the touch and even trapped as she was—her magic lingered. Once he was sure she was locked away, he went to his partner
“How did you know it was us?” I said standing up in full view now. I stepped around the bush and Malfoy followed suit. He was fanning his face with his hand.
“Ready, Potter?” Draco asked, turning fractionally and smirking. He didn’t wait for an answer, instead tugging Harry forwards with him.
“How are you getting worse as this?” Malfoy laughed that touchable laugh. I could feel it sliding along my skin like a lovers caress. “I didn’t think that was possible.”
I peered over the bush and saw Adeline Greyjoy, the new Divination professor, holding her hands up in the air. She wore a large flowing dress that billowed out as she spun in circles around a small fire. It crackled as a long snapped under the flames. There was an iron kettle next to the fire along with many glass jars full of herbs. She stoped singing abruptly and turned to me. There was a smile on her face as if she expected to find me here.
“Wanted to have a chat,” Harry said and strode over to the only empty seat in her office, which also happened to be her desk chair. He sat himself down and cast a semi-worried look at his friend who always seemed to look pleasantly stressed out.
Weasley posed a similar problem to Thomas and Finagean. Draco wasn’t sure how clean the clothes were, even though begrudgingly he had to admit Weasley’s outfit was the least dreadful of the bunch as he wore a traditional dress robe much like the one Draco wore.
books were only mostly accurate and she hadn’t gotten much better in the years since. The only difference between Skeeter then and Skeeter now was that I agreed with her this time. Maybe that wasn’t enough for them, but it was for me.
“Me too. But it seems you weren’t too tired to tell Robards you didn’t want to be my partner anymore.” Potter stopped walking along the bookshelf and turned to face Draco. He smiled, a half-smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
Hermione grabbed my arm. She was still standing on the cemetery side of the wall. “Harry, we shouldn’t go in there. You know better than anyone that the forest is dangerous. And a black trace can’t mean anything good.”
A wonderful laugh escaped Malfoy’s mouth. It was practically touchable. “I believe that ship sailed a long time ago, George. Sometime after the owl incident, I think.”
He felt irately petulant all of a sudden. It came upon him like a wave against the shore. All of his own insecurities, his doubts, surfaced and tangled around him yanking him with fevered desperation to the depths of uncertainty.
Draco blanched. He’d been staring, he knew he’d been staring, but he couldn’t help himself. Potter looked wild, dangerous, with his hair mussed as it always was, and his jaw clenched in determination. “You memorised the Ley Lines in London? You know things about Ley Lines?”
“It’s not so obvious, Harry. Just, well, we’ve known each other a long time. And I didn’t think it was a secret, just thought you didn’t like talking about your love life.”
It sounded ridiculous even to me, even though I had focused and made myself have a vision at the cemetery earlier today. I was a seer. I was a seer? How could that be right? “I don’t know. This all sounds crazy.”
There were no candles lit, but the fire in the hearth was still burning. It crackled as a log gave way to the flames, sending little orange sparks up into the chimney. Harry set his things down near the couch facing the hearth and moved around it, so he could take up his other avoidance tactic: watching the fire turn to embers, so he could avoid going to his room where Ron would no doubt be awake and full of questions that Harry didn’t want to answer.
Outside, the winter air was crisp, and Harry couldn’t help but think he should have grabbed a coat. Just as he was about to say something, Draco pulled his wand out and cast a warming charm over them. The magic tingled along his skin like a summer breeze.
I hope everyone enjoyed this story!! Lots of it came out of my own stupid ass experiences being a dumb ass (like Harry). Comments and kudos are sooooo greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading. :D
Draco looked intense as he watched the fire in front of them. “You ever think about what you should or shouldn’t want and wonder if your brain will ever shut up long enough to let you make a choice?” Draco asked, eyes still on the fire. He resumed his earlier position, resting his arms on his thighs.
The pair had been inseparable since childhood much like Draco and Pansy, but even more so since each of their divorces. Seems the Weasley clan shut ranks and Mr. Potter and Ms. Granger were left to lean upon one another.
Suddenly, Draco wrapped a hand around Harry’s wrist. His slender fingers cool on Harry’s skin. He couldn’t help the look of shock that ran across his face at the contact. The grip was firm at first, but then Draco’s fingers loosened and slid up Harry’s arm, stopping at his elbow.
Robards didn’t turn around. “Go Reed.” He turned to Lamont. “Go with her and make sure the Unspeakables know about the issues with the trace spell.”
“I’ve been tossing it around since I sat down with you,” he said, chewing on his bottom lip in a quiet moment of thought, then added, “Actually, if I’m being
I turned to walk back to the maze and didn’t get further than a few steps before that drawling voice flooded my ears. “And just where are you off to?”
As the song picked up, Charlie moved in closer, so they were standing almost flush against one another. “Remember after the war, when we all played quidditch in the backyard?”
It also seemed to jolt Potter’s attention away form Draco’s groin. Now, he was gazing up at Draco, unblinking. His face was impossible to read. Draco found he was met with curious eyes instead of disgust. He found Potter’s cheeks were pink and that he was hugging his knees tight to his chest as if he were afraid he would lose them should he let go.
The elderly couple in front of us turned at the mention of his name and the woman shushed us. The man shook his head in disappointment. Hermione gave them a nasty look and they turned back around.
Draco sleeps without nightmares for the first time in a long time. His encounter with Potter the night before still reeling in his mind. However, he must wake up and face the day and that means facing his father.
Granger was a possibility. She wore a floor length blue dress. It was a shiny slip covered by a lace outer layer. It was elegant and he was sure Granger knew how to properly launder clothes.
“Ginny was laughing for a good two minutes before the death glare Parkinson gave her made her stop.”
It hit me then—the coldness I’d felt it at the crime scene and again in the bathroom. The smile disappeared from my face just as the lights flickered. I heard Hermione gasp and then everything went black.
Harry’s throat was dry again and he felt the same warmth from earlier return but more slowly this time, like a cloud moving out of the way of the sun. The warmth hit in small increments until it was everywhere. He shook his head because he was definitely not letting himself go all warm and fuzzy over Draco Malfoy.
“Yeah, he is,” Neville answered and then swept the Exploding Snap cards off the desk and put them back into his desk drawer. He turned back to face Harry. “He’s taken you know.”
“I think that would not be entirely appropriate since it is very late,” Lucius supplied the answer when the Dark Lord didn’t. Instead, Draco watched as the Dark Lord raised his brow in interest.
I put my hand up to stop him from diving into the ‘we all love you’ lecture deep-end. “I know. I know.”
Malfoy must have felt something, too, because he tore his arm out of Harry’s grip and said, “Let’s get this over with.”
Harry barked out a tired laugh. He was exhausted from Auror training and Quidditch practice. He wanted the best of both worlds once the war ended, so he immediately decided to make a career of hunting down dark wizards with Ron instead of going back to Hogwarts like Hermione, and then he decided to make a hobby of Quidditch. Harry was not letting anything stop him from doing the things he loved. Things that made him feel like himself.
“It’s not surprising that the Prophet is covering that. We weren’t fighting. I mean, yeah, I shouted a bit about the surges, but mostly it was about the kid and the hearing. Why are you showing me this anyway? There’s at least one article about me in there every week.”
“Have you got one of those?” Potter asked, pointing behind him in the general direction Girl Weasley had walked.
I just starred at him, not sure if I wanted to give in to him or if I wanted to fight him. Both would serve as a nice distraction from all the thoughts swirling around my head.
After all of that, it would be unthinkable for Draco to truly catch the attentions of Mr. Potter, who was and always would be on the side of the angels—morally untouchable and possibly a bit fantastical. And like so many cruel jokes, Draco’s feelings for Mr. Potter had only grown in the months after the trial. Try as he might, he kept the flame of hope burning speculating that the interference may have suggested, in whatever small way, that Mr. Potter could be persuaded to find Draco tolerable.
I laughed. It was a nasty sound, even to my ears. “So you and your just laws can shove another crime under the rug. No, thanks. I’m going to make sure all the officials have to hear about their pal and the bruises he left on his kid. I’m going to make them face it.” It was hard to have this conversation when I knew only part of the reason I beat the man was because I knew it was wrong what he was doing, but the other part of it had been something more selfish.
“Fuck. Cock. Shite,” Harry cursed. Of course this would make him look bad. Of course it would make things worse, “I didn’t even think about that.”
She shook her head. “Not exactly. I know you’re having them and they will lead to your death if you are not careful.”
“Deal,” Draco agreed, extending his right hand. Harry took it and they shook, but Draco didn’t let go right away. Harry didn’t mind surprisingly, as Draco’s hand was warm to the touch, and soft. After what felt like an eternity, Draco slipped his hand out of Harry’s grip. “Well, you met Ryder, right? So that’s one. Then there was some Hufflepuff named Christian last week. Nice enough bloke, I suppose, but not really my type in the looks department.”
“I—I am, against my better judgement—the things I feel…you have always been…” Draco tailed off. Admitting his feelings was harder than he would have ever anticipated. But he was here now, he was finally going to admit to something that he had been ignoring for his entire life. Admit to something that went against every rational thought he had.
“You had to make terrible choices. You were asked to do things no child should have been asked to do and the world has never really stopped asking things of you, taking them. That is enough to make anyone hurt, Harry.”
“Your indifference amazes me,” Pansy sighed, breaking Draco free from his own thoughts. This was not the first time they had a conversation like this, nor would it be the last.
In the five years since the war, all the promised changes like harsher punishments for muggle hate crimes, or more humane conditions at Azkaban had been pushed aside or forgotten. The only edict that even saw the light of day was the secrecy statues and that was nearly dead now thanks to me.
“Fine. I like the danger. I understand it better than I understand anything else. I always have. It makes more sense to me than settling down and getting married and having kids and all that stuff people swore to me would feel good after the war. Except none of it felt right. It was boring. But that doesn’t mean I can’t also want to keep people safe.”
The dining room was lit by low hanging chandeliers which were bewitched to float above the long oak table. The wallpaper, which Draco had always disliked, was similarly bewitched. From ceiling to floor, the wallpaper showed various flowers blooming over and over. Some roses, some geraniums, others tulips, and some bluebells.
Unfortunately in the harshness of day, Draco found the thought of Potter less relaxing and more nerve-wracking. He also found himself hard pressed to find a good enough excuse to placate what he was sure would be the most withering of looks Lucius would shoot his way across the breakfast table. Skipping was out of the question because that would only mean Lucius would seek him out and lecture him in whatever part of the house he found Draco.
“I don’t understand you sometimes. You never would have said that when we were in school. We broke the laws all the time back then for the same reasons I did what I did now. To save lives.” I grabbed him by the shoulders then and searched his eyes for a hint of the Ron from school, but I didn’t see it. “That used to matter to you above all else. Now all you and Hermione care about is moving up the Ministry ladder and becoming normal married people with kids who go on double dates and discuss the best wizarding vacation spots like the war never happened.”
To Draco’s surprise, the room had been changed since he was there earlier. The long oak table was transfigured into a smaller table, still rectangular, but much more intimate. His father was clearly up to something, but Draco wasn’t sure what it was yet. However, this did confirm he would be offered up to Nikola as he suspected.
“As I was saying, there have been six kills as far as we know. The first three were all Muggle, so we didn’t hear about it right away. You know how Muggle law enforcement likes to keep us as a last resort.” Robards paused when the group of Aurors grunted at the mention of the Muggle authorities. Robards returned the grunt. He got annoyed with them, too, it seemed. “The fourth was a wizard, and so it officially became our case.”
Harry would sneak out, sometimes using the invisibility cloak, sometimes he would just waltz out of the dorm, ignoring Ron’s curious looks. On nights when he used the cloak, he found himself wondering how Draco made it out to the pitch without anyone noticing. He never asked questions though, since the mystery of it was another part of the excitement.
“I’ve always been wise,” Ginny whispered into his ear and then pulled out of the hug. She stood up and straightened her forget-me-not blue peacoat, extending her hand to pull him off the bench.
“This is all your fault,” Malfoy snarled, elbowing Harry in the ribs. The pain shot through him, making him sit up straighter and move away from Malfoy.
I was feeling petulant and way too exposed. I couldn’t meet her eyes and I didn’t want to acknowledge that some part of what she said was true. “Shame you didn’t fall off.”
him plenty, but this wasn’t a laugh at his expense, and it made Draco’s heart flutter stupidly. Seemed like it was allergy season again.
“Then what brings you here? In need of a potion that you can’t get from the Ministry stores? Something a for the bedroom, perhaps? We all know how you like to sleep around.” Malfoy smirked as he stepped out from behind the counter, his letter forgotten and the owl looking truly aggravated. It ruffled its feathers and swooped away. “We have a wide selection of potions, Potter, but I’m sure we can find one that suits your, uh, needs.”
Eyes wide, Malfoy gave him a long-suffering silent sigh, which Harry found oddly impressive, or at least he would have if there wasn’t a man potentially dying on the other side of the door while his partner did it.
Sometimes, I forget that I have magic. It’s like my brain just starts doing things and I have to remind myself that I could just flick my wrist and be done in half the time. A lingering product of my muggle upbringing, so I bent down and started the muggle way while my thoughts trailed off to Draco Malfoy, who I could never manage to be rid of, and started to stack the papers.
“Er, I like it well enough,” Harry found himself answering in spite of himself. He still hadn’t managed to tear his gaze away from Draco’s pale, exposed thighs.
As he approached, she turned her attention to him and smiled. It was warm. She looked pleased to see him. “Ah, my dear son.”
” Draco admitted, “but say I kiss you, and I feel something and you don’t? Also ridiculous because now I’m embarrassed. Then the same result occurs: we can’t be friends anymore because I would be too mortified.”
Hermione took my wrist. “Harry, we all know you like to be the martyr.” She paused when I opened my mouth to protest, but she shook her head. “I’m
I sipped my tea and purposefully licked my lips as slow as I could mange. “I changed a bit. I think I’m rather a good flirt now.”
There was a moment of pure shock on Draco’s face before he schooled his expression and cleared his throat. “A week from Monday. I know it’s short notice.”
This was all a bit much for Draco. His heart hammered in his chest and he was tempted to disapparate right now to the comfort of his home. The wetness of his clothes suddenly became the only thing he could think about. “It is of no consequence now.”
Harry is numbing the memories the Battle Memorial brought up with alcohol when he gets an unexpected visitor who has information on the magical surges.
“Count to ten,” Draco told himself as he watched his reflection in the bathroom mirror. The panic was apparent in his ragged breathing and high-pitched voice as he spoke to himself. The gentle sway of the ship on the Black Lake made him feel nauseous again. There were dark circles under his eyes and his normally pale skin was blotchy and red under the dim lantern lighting.
Yet, last night he had not dreamt. He had not tossed and turned fitfully, only to give up on sleep and read a book in the dim light of his candelabra. He had not woken with the sickening taste of lavender in his mouth. He slept through the night and awoke to the sun streaming in through his curtains which he forgot to shut the night before. It warmed his skin and he felt almost like smiling.
“It’s a nice offer, but thanks. Also, I never realized I was so easy to read. That is not a good trait to have as an Auror. I’ll have to work on my poker face.” Harry was half joking, but half serious. It seemed that everyone knew things about him that he hadn’t shared. It was starting to concern him.
“Pshh, Ron’s a light—” Hermione started and hiccuped. She turned to Ron and smirked. “You’re the lightweight, darling.”
Potter opened his mouth like he was going to speak, then closed it again, tightening his lips into a hard line. Then his face softened, and he said, “Okay, but if the potion was supposed to be stronger around the person you were attracted to, and it was affecting me so much around you then…”
With a sour taste in his mouth, Draco entered the dining room. There was a full breakfast spread on the table and steaming hot tea in front of his seat. However, Lucius was not in attendance. His plate was there and it seemed like it was clean from disuse. There wasn’t even a dirty tea cup to suggest that his father had been down for breakfast.
Ron’s eyes went wide. “You think he just got in the way?” He looked down at the spot where the man had lain bleeding though his jumper. His face paled. “But he was having surges. The rumored obscurial, right? That has to mean something.”
“Will you shut it?” Harry asked, but decided not to wait for a reply. “Let’s go.” With that, Harry started off and didn’t look back to see if Malfoy was following him. He smirked as he heard a huff and then light footsteps behind him.
“Harry Potter, you absolute cock,” Pansy shouted in lieu of a proper hello. She looked wild. Her hair was frizzy, which Harry was sure wasn’t on purpose. Her cheeks were flushed pink and she had char marks on her fingertips.
After Luna walked back to Potter and the rest, her words played over in his mind as he stood there at the edge of the party. He tried to distract himself from the nagging feeling that he was making a huge mistake by even showing up at the party, let alone staying. If his encounter with Potter taught him anything it was that the rule he made at the beginning of the year to avoid everyone at all costs was a good rule and he never should have broken it in the first place when Potter asked to be his Potions partner and especially not now by coming to this party.
“Suppose so,” Harry agreed, and turned to the busy sidewalk, feeling comforted by Malfoy’s magic all around him, and replaying the Succubus’ words.
Except there was someone on the couch. Harry stopped mid-step. A lump of a person, curled up under a throw blanket, lay there. The only visible part of their body was the white-blonde strands of hair sticking out from under the blanket. Harry felt his heart pound in his chest at the sight. He started to back away as quietly as possible, but tripped over his Quidditch gear, fell backward, and whispered, “
I knelt down in front of the upturned earth at the head of the grave. It wasn’t a very deep hole. Whoever was digging this was doing it with their hands and they didn’t make it very far. I saw deep grooves where their fingers dragged the dirt up. I don’t know why but the scene made me think of my dreams. Of the man sobbing in front of the rock.
Sweat rolled down my neck. I felt my shirt sticking to my chest, but no pain, no flashes. Nothing. I felt guilt wash over me. I hadn’t wanted to see the dead man with black ooze flowing from his mouth like some macabre fountain statue. Maybe my own apprehension was keeping me from accessing whatever visions were there. With Voldemort, the visions mostly came when I was dreaming and always when Voldemort wanted me to see something. He controlled them once he knew about the connection in our minds. This was different somehow, but I didn’t know exactly how I knew that. I controlled the visions this time. I pushed my hand into the dirt covering my hand up to my wrist and focused harder. I cleared my mind of all the doubt and shut out Hermione and Ron’s inane conversation about who should go get Malfoy.
I opened my eyes to find Hermione and Ron staring at me. Concern all over their faces. It annoyed me. I glanced back over to Ginny and Parkinson and knew I would have to face them sooner or later, but like any functional adult I had to try avoiding it. “I’m in the mood now, Malfoy.”
Dinner would be served in their formal dining room this evening, since they had the distinct pleasure of hosting the Dark Lord and some diplomat from Russia. Apparently, this meeting was set in order to smooth over whatever slight the Russian Minister for Magic imagined due to Goyle’s recent mistake, which apparently had been what his father was droning on about earlier. Luckily, the house elves warned Draco, otherwise he would have shucked off his dinner duties in favor of sitting alone in his room and received quite the punishment from the Dark Lord.
Robards scowled. “I’m not doing this for you, Potter. I am doing this for all the auror’s who trusted the DMLE and are being mind wiped without consent.”
, I see.” I smirked. Talking to Malfoy felt like being on that edge. He always managed to bring out those nasty bits in me that I worked on hiding from most people. The obsession. The anger. The desire for danger. The overwhelming urge to hurt someone. “Why are you even here?”
“I’m afraid, I don’t know,” Luna sighed and then set her sights on the pigeon who was cooing comfortably in the sunlight on the windowsill, “I reckon, I’m in a similar situation.”
“It will, but I have other things to consider, Harry. The Probationary Board is just waiting for me to mess up, and I’ve already been rejected by four Potions Masters for apprenticeships. I’m going to have to start looking outside of England. I might have to move just to get a fair chance at an apprenticeship. And the papers, Merlin, the papers already got wind of our friendship, and the gossip isn’t kind. People still see me as a traitor, as a Death Eater. I get death threats, Harry. Just for being your friend. Imagine what they will do if they find out we are dating, that we’ve been dating the better part of the year. I can’t bring that into your home. I won’t put you in danger ever again. I won’t be the reason you get hurt.”
The song was nearing it’s end. It was the really slow, seductive part. Harry was conscious of every part of his body that was touching Charlie's. But he kept his eyes on Charlie's face and he was looking exclusively at Harry’s lips now. “I almost kissed you that day.”
Ron never believed me when I told him I was happier as a field auror, even though I told him regularly. He would look guilty and say I was just trying to make the situation less awkward, but I really didn’t want his job. Sometimes, I didn’t even want mine. The look was there now and I felt more hungover than I had when I woke up.
“What I did, I did to save someone's life, Ron. You don’t know what it’s like to be that kid. I do. His father was a sick bastard who liked hurting him and knew no one was going to step in because he was powerful. Don’t you try to compare the two things. Don’t.”
“The what?” Draco managed. They were nearly at the group. He could hear Weasley’s obnoxious laugh over the hum of music.
I poured myself a cup of coffee and turned my back to the sunlit window. The mug was warm in my hands and the sun was warm on my back. Exhaustion tugged at my eyes and I indulged for a moment, shutting them. A minute later, the floo rang.
I licked my lips. I’d never seen the bashful side of Malfoy. This was getting more and more interesting. “I'm still not hearing a reason why we can’t fool around.”
With an exasperated look to match only Hermione’s, Malfoy said, “As many time as it takes to be sure you aren’t a complete dunce.”
Ron huffed out a breath through his nose. “He’s dead. Found him in an abandoned building two days ago with all his equipment and notes. Been dead almost a month. Have you ever seen a body that’s been exploded, Harry? His skin was… ugh, I chucked up my lunch.”
Shaking his head in exasperation, “How will I ever keep a secret from either of you when you both know everything about me without even trying?”
“Letter is from Robards. He says he is sending a few teams out to any clubs or bars that fall on a Ley Line and to be careful and call for backup this time if you spot the Succubus. He underlined that part three times.” Pansy folded the letter and handed it to Potter. He took it and nodded, but didn’t read it.
It seemed so unnatural to hear Malfoy do something so normal as singing while working. Merlin, Harry hummed while working and now Malfoy was doing it like he was a normal person and not Dorian Gray’s portrait come to life. Harry often thought of Malfoy like an exhibit at a museum. Striking and elegant. Timeless. He was there simply to be admired from afar. Looked at, but not touched like a Monet hanging in a gilded frame.
Naturally, Harry wanted to prove Malfoy wrong. So naturally, he had suggested that Malfoy put his money where his mouth was and who better to prove it on than Harry himself?
She nodded knowingly. Harry had been in trouble a few times for forgetting to file reports. “You must have gotten up extra early to be up before me. I missed you in bed when I woke up.”
Harry felt his heart swell as he looked at Draco. He had to admit he’d never seen this coming. A friendship with Draco, maybe, but not this...not this warm, comfortable feeling deep in his gut every time he looked at Draco. It was like coming home, like being safe for the first time in his life. Falling for Draco had thrown a wrench into his plans in the best way possible. His best idea for a life after school had involved becoming the Auror everyone thought he should be and marrying Ginny because that was also expected of him. His heart hadn’t been in either, not the way it should have been. And he had already resigned himself to feeling, well, nothing, and then they kissed...everything changed. And while he was still planning on being an Auror, he felt the passion for it now—or at least, Draco had helped him unlock the passion that was already there.
Best to get right to the point. The longer Ron and Hermione hung around the cemetery, the more likely someone would notice. “I need your magical trace potion.”
In the cellar, Draco finally let himself take a deep breath. The night had taken a turn. He had never paraded Potter about in front of anyone, let alone a strange man whose motivations were still a mystery. He feared that if Potter was obstinate, as he usually was, that Draco would be expected to control the situation. And if he was expected to control Potter, then he expected it would turn him on like it had been as of late.
I breathed out a small laugh that caught Ron’s attention. Or at least part if it. His eyes were still fixed on Hermione who was boasting about unity or some other crap.
Draco paused before answering. Part of him really did enjoy this—being treated like scum, especially by Potter. And another part of him liked inflicting pain. So he answered honestly.
I watched her for any hint that she was fucking with me, but she looked perfectly serious. “What kind of lead?”
In the middle of the room, there was a raised stone coffin with the name Howard Benchley etched into the stone. According to the etching, Benchley died in 1807. The rest of the dead were housed in the walls around him. He must have been the patriarch of the family. And there were a lot of relatives surrounding Benchley. This man’s eternal resting space was bigger than Harry’s apartment. Rich people. Even in death they had to be showy.
“Harry, you really should have your insomnia looked at. It’s unhealthy and coupled with your drinking habits…”
It did not, however, mean he must enjoy himself nor participate in more ways than nodding at guests, occasionally taking a partner in dance, and indulging in champagne. It also did not mean speaking to Mr. Potter or his companion no matter how his insides shouted in merriment at the thought of Mr. Potter approaching him.
“Guess.” Ron’s voice reminded me of McGonagall’s when she caught us out after curfew in school and said, ‘of course it’s you three’ like she wasn’t
Quiet and empty as it was, the emergency ward had an almost other-realm feel to it as Potter stood in front of Draco, smiling at him openly like they were the best of friends.
Potter stopped kissing him and stood back—looking Draco in the eyes. There was a twinkle or something mischievous in that look. “Is that a challenge?”
Ignoring all rationality and the calls of his mates, Harry marched across the courtyard determined to speak to Draco. Since he was making a b-line straight for him, the crowd turned their attention on Harry, hoping to finally understand what was going on between the pair.
I licked my lips. “Yes, very interested,” I said but when I saw him, I knew that wasn’t the answer he was hoping for.
This morning the putrid scent hung over him like a guillotine—threatening to end his life once and for all, if he would just give into the specter of the past. And he was tempted. More than he would admit to anyone, he was tempted.
The Succubus was attempting Thaumaturgy, a kind of magic that fell out of use in Europe around the turn of the century thanks to the focus on wand magic. Doing something on the small scale, and having it happen on the large scale. Using something to represent how the magic should be focused. It’s ultimately what a wand did, but with less ritual than something like what the Succubus was attempting.
Tonight, Harry was trying to be less wild so he could stay sharp. Usually, he participated in the wildness. Ginny always made sure of that as his semi-permanent plus-one. “The league captains think it’s good for us all to let off steam together. Helps promote good sportsmanship, or whatever.”
“I was searching for you, Father,” Draco supplied the lie quickly. He had really come to see what sort of night he was in store for. The arrangement of the room often told him all he needed to know. For instance, if there was a long table adorned with their finest ivory colored clothes, it would be a delegation dinner, but if the table was smaller and the room was dimly lit, the meeting would be more intimate and therefore be less about business.
The lights flickered off and the room went suddenly cold. I wrapped my arms around my torso. Fear ran though my veins like ice cold water just like third year the fist time I met a Dementor. I couldn’t think straight. I should have cast a wandless spell, but I just stood there in the dark. I had to remind myself to breathe.
Now, however, Harry found himself crouching in the snow a few feet away from Malfoy all while looking at a plant that was definitely just a weed. It was Christmas Eve, Harry whined internally, and he was looking for plants. For the millionth time, Harry wondered how he got into this situation.
“Potter, could you—could you move aside?” Draco said in an attempt to sound casual and polite; two things he had never successfully done with Potter.
The more Potter stood there looking at him, speaking to him casually, the more anxious Draco got. The worst part was that after Potter slapped him on the back, he rested his hand there for a moment. The soft pressure of the touch made him think of the roughness with which Potter had swung him around in the privy earlier. So juxtaposed, but still having the same effect on Draco’s breathing.
Ron turned to face Harry and then cocked his head to the side in confusion, then he asked, “Well, why talk about it now if you think it’s too late?”
Pulling back from the kiss, Draco’s lips were pink. “Super.” He kissed Harry on the cheek once more and gathered up his book and parchment, placing it atop his lap to hide his growing arousal. “Now back to our revisions. Remember three correct answers and I will remove another piece of clothing.”
“Oh, yeah. Forgot about that one,” Charlie said, forcing out a laugh. His breath clouded in front of them in a puff.
It annoyed Draco to admit it, seeing as he would have to spend at least two hours fixing what it took Potter all of ten minutes to mess up, but sitting across from one’s partner made a certain kind of sense. It gave them the space to work without being too hard to reach when they needed to discuss a case, but clearly Potter’s slovenliness had not been taken into consideration when the choice was made. Draco was sure that if whoever came up with the system had a partner like Potter, they would have wanted their desks to be as far apart as possible.
“I know,” Draco said, undoing the top button of his dress robes. His fingers trembled trying to unfasten it. Potter was watching him. Eyes fixed on Draco’s fingers while they worked to unfasten the rest of the buttons. Suddenly Draco was glad his dress robes had buttons all the way down. He could take his time undressing. Potter on the other hand, would be undressed before Draco could say whomping willow.
—Though I assume you are often right, so it does not surprise you any longer.” Mr. Potter leaned in to whisper. Draco felt Mr. Potter’s breath on his skin and it felt like the first rays of sunlight in the summer. He wanted to bask in it for an eternity.
It was never my choice. That’s the part everyone forgets. I was raised to kill Voldemort. No one asked me if I was capable of it, or if I wanted to do it. Everything was planned, from where and how I was brought up, keeping me unaware of my magical abilities, to how I had to die in order to save everyone. It was just decided before I could even eat solid foods that I would face down the darkest wizard of my time all because he didn’t
“I do. It’s what I’m hoping with him. I’m hoping if he knew how I felt, that he wouldn’t care about that bloke,” Harry said this and then grabbed Charlie's un-gloved hand, brought it to his lips and placed a soft, warm kiss on the Charlie's cold knuckles.
“I will love you, please you, and you can stop fighting, stop protecting,” she purred, leaning in and planting a soft lipped kiss on his mouth. It sent a jolt of pleasure through him that made his knees buckle. “I will give you all that your heart desires tonight.” Her words came as a comfort. Harry leaned into her touch more, letting her scent wash over him. “You will die with a smile on your face, having experienced love like no other.”
“Hermione?” Harry called out to a seemingly empty office. Hermione’s desk was neat and tidy, but that is where the organization stopped. There were books piled like the shaky towers of the Burrow, constantly looking as if they would topple over at any minute, but somehow reamaining erect. There were also some dead plants lining the windowsills which were charmed to look like her childhood backyard.
“Nikola, is this your first visit to England?” Lucius asked in his guest voice, handing a drink to Nikola. It was reserved for people that were to be impressed. Rarely Draco was on the receiving end, but even those occasions were too far and in between now.
The look on her face was priceless. She was speechless and somber and incensed all that the same time. She tilted her head back and took the shot. Potter watched gleefully. He seemed much more in control of himself than he had in the privy and Draco wondered if he had imagined the interaction all together.
She clicked her tongue at him, reaching out her slender fingers to tilt his chin up—her deep brown eyes, searching his face. “You really believe that, don’t you, my pet?”
Draco, feeling practically naked in Potter’s clothes, followed him out of the bathroom. There was an angry looking Durmstrang girl hopping from foot to foot. She scowled at them and mutter “bloody Potter, of course,” under her breath and slammed the door behind herself.
Harry, careful to cast a Disillusionment Charm this time, snuck quietly around the side of the mausoleum nearest the dead birds. He peered inside and saw what looked like a squatter’s den. It was empty, so he went inside to get a better look.
“And here I thought you just wanted to hear my generic ‘works fine’ routine that I pull out for all the parties.” Harry smiled, matching Draco’s forced smile with one of his own. “What’s up, Draco?”
Hermione and Ron noticed one morning at breakfast that Harry was staring at Draco, not with contempt, but with a very dumb smile on his face. To be fair, Draco was returning his look with an even dumber smile plastered on his face. A piece of toast hanging in front of his mouth.
Robards shook his head, but I could see a hint of doubt in his eyes. “Your hearing in coming up and you’re scared so you want to invent a cover up to distract from the fact that you broke the law. That’s what this is, right?”
“I see it. There’s a blue light in the air where you cast the spell and it leads back to the tip of your wand.” I took a deep breath, and then let it out. I was seeing magic in a way no wizard had before and the gravity of it was not lost on me.
. Though Draco felt it was unfair of his father to be annoyed that the man his father was going to offer him to was attracted to him. If Draco wasn’t mistaken, that was a good thing.
It was The Battle of Hogwarts Memorial Day, and the only remembering I wanted to do was remembering where I threw the file I was looking at last night before I passed out on my desk in an alcohol induced slumber. I’d been at work late, again, looking over my files on recent surges in underage magic usage looking for any explanations, any patterns, for the uptick in reports when Ron Weasley, auror, ass-kicker, and all around my best mate in the world (next to Hermione Granger, of course), had come in and suggested we drink away the blasted ‘memories’ and I had obliged like the daft idiot I was and vaguely remember us shouting ‘screw the memories, screw bloody paperwork’ after our fifth shot and tossing everything off of my desk in a flurry of papers after our seventh. It had seemed logical at the time, but standing in the office looking at the disarray, I wondered why I let him talk me into trashing my desk and not his.
After the coat room, he mostly ignored my advances with the exception of the memorial and the party, of course, but that didn’t stop me. I liked the challenge, the back and forth. It was exciting.
Harry stood up, a little annoyed. He didn’t see anything wrong with that he’d said. “Put what on you?”
I sat back in my chair and took another sip, ignoring the arousal tightening in my groin. I nodded toward the professor and Neville mouthed “She’s new. Divination” and then raised his eyebrows.
“Have either of you been to Russia?” Nikola asked, but he was no longer looking at Lucius. Instead, he was watching Draco with a handsome grin on his face. The shift in attention was noticed by his father who straightened his back and did his best not to look perturbed by the slight. Lucius, while still attractive, had nothing in comparison to Draco’s sharp and striking features, many of which he inherited from his mother. His looks were the one thing keeping him alive, Draco thought bitterly. Well, his looks and his predilection for witty repartee and strategizing.
“You can come by the shop next week and take a look,” Malfoy said. He smiled politely and I almost believed they were always friendly. If you didn’t know their past, you’d say they’d always gotten along.
Pansy took the form and filed it away in its proper place before moving to a glass cabinet and taking out two phials of a red liquid. “Drink this, and hopefully you’ll be immune. Give it like five minutes to kick in, and if it works it should give you about seven hours of use.”
“Yes, Mister Malfoy,” Margie answered and backed out of the office, closing the door behind her, leaving Harry and Draco alone.
Instantly, Harry felt a hand on his hip as Malfoy drew in a little closer. It was a light touch that sent a jolt through his body. Malfoy had barely touched him, but the fabric of his shirt was thin and it was almost like Malfoy had touched his bare skin. For the first time since making the bet, Harry wished he had made it mandatory for Malfoy to remove his robes and just wear his undershirt like Harry had done.
The crowd erupted in applause. She and Ron were nearly as famous as I was, and that was very famous. Their names were household names. Their profiles in Skeeter’s book called them heroes in their own right. It was the one part of her book I didn’t hate.
To her credit, Pansy stood patiently waiting for them to catch their respective breaths. Her hair was cut in a severe bob that highlighted the sharp edges of her jaw. She wore a white lab coat over a plum purple A-line dress with lace pantyhose and staggeringly high heels that made her look smart, but also like she would take a whip to you if you got naughty.
Potter whimpered, pouted his lip out farther, and looked to be considering something. Then Potter stepped backward which allowed Draco to quickly spin, open the door, and exit the bathroom.
Ron burst out laughing. “She hates divination so much. Merlin, I love her but how can she be a muggle who found out about magic and not believe in divination? It’s almost too funny.”
Work was tedious. Harry couldn’t get his mind off of just about a million things. Between the article denying his relationship with Ginny and his proclivity for liking men, Charlie's admission of feelings, and his own nerves about how to tell Draco he had feelings for him…well, Harry just didn’t care much for his paperwork.
“Hasn't it?” Harry asked petulantly. Of course he knew maybe he was being overly moody about the whole thing, but falling in love with someone who might not even care that you had fallen in love with them was much more perturbing than he could have ever imagined.
“Oi, Ron!” Harry shouted, probably louder than necessary and laughed to himself as Ron startled back to life and smiled sheepishly. In contrast with his talk to Ginny, Harry thought it was best to carve out an entire evening to discuss this with Ron, so Harry decided to invite him over to Grimmauld Place for dinner and drinks. Maybe, just maybe, they focused a little too heartily on the drinks part.
Surprisingly, Malfoy seemed equally afflicted. It was only through the sharpened rise and fall of his chest that Harry was even sure Malfoy hadn’t somehow turned into a statue.
At each button, Harry felt Draco’s lip brush against his skin. The sensation drove him mad. The soft, warm breath tickled down until Draco stopped at his waist.
A smile played at the corner of Draco’s mouth. Then he licked his lips. The motion made Harry feel like he’d be hit with a stupify.
A pained expression took over Hermione’s face. It was somewhere between a wince and a smile, “How do I say this politely? You don’t exactly know how to deal with feelings. Remember Cho? You literally didn’t even realize she wanted you to ask her out for like months. And let’s not even get started on Ginny.”
,” Potter slurred, placed the bottle on the sink’s ledge which wasn’t very wide. It slipped as the ship swayed and made a clattering sound as it settled in the basin of the sink. Hands now free, he grabbed hold of Draco’s shoulders. The contact burned through him.
She gave me a slight curtesy and lowered her wand. She bent over to pick up another log and tossed it into the fire. The embers and ashes floated up in small orange-black specs. “Won’t you two come join me for some tea? I’ve been foraging for ingredients. The forest has some magnificent plants to help with divination.”
At the cemetery, Harry, Ron and Hermione try to loo for any clues left behind, but realize they still don’t have enough.
Lucius delivered the news as if it meant Draco won the Quidditch World Cup. As if it was some great honor to be the Dark Lord’s prostitute. His face revealed all Draco needed to know about his father, the cruelty in the smile, the challenge in the narrowing of the eyes—Lucius, despite his mother’s insistence, was not merely distant. He was cold. Empty. At least empty of anything resembling love for Draco. Not anymore. Maybe once, when Draco was younger. But in the last two years since the Dark Lord’s return, there had been nothing there.
Draco’s face was blank. Nothing showed. Not disgust, not happiness, nothing. His chest rose and fell with heavy breaths. He looked at Harry, his eyes narrowed, his lips pursed.
