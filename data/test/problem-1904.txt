Malfoy nodded. “I thought you’d pick that one.”
appeared before their eyes. He wiped his hands on his trousers and stood, groaning slightly as his knees popped.
"Harry, being afraid doesn’t make you a coward," Draco said, grasping Harry’s shoulders and forcing him to pay attention. "Wanting bad things to end does not make you a coward. We all lost things in that war, and we all gave things, but I doubt there were many who would have willingly walked to their death."
True to Harry’s word, McGonagall’s office was empty when the pair of them arrived. Harry led the way over to the large fireplace and lit a fire with his wand.
“It’s too late for me to back out now,” Harry said. “I don’t want to, anyway. Draco’s been really good about this entire thing. We understand each other.”
Usually, he was okay. The fire didn’t frighten him, and he could see the beauty of burning embers and orange flames. But occasionally, all he could see was danger.
Malfoy opened the bag of jelly beans.
Harry smiled, twisted the ring around his finger.
“Draco, what’s going on?” His mother’s voice sounded concerned, and Draco uncovered the mouthpiece.
"That doesn’t make you stupid, Harry," Draco said, calmly leaning against the rampart, arms and legs crossed. "It just makes Dumbledore clever in all the wrong ways."
Okay, so, Draco doesn't
This picture kind of makes me dizzy, but I had a good laugh when I figured out what was going on. Thank you for reading!
Thank you for reading!
Day Eighteen of the 25 Days of Harry/Draco at Slythindor100!
“Harry!”
“I feel like we haven’t had a quiet moment to ourselves in ages,” Harry sighed, leaning against Draco on the couch.
“I thought you liked the outdoors, Po--Harry,” said Draco, drawing Harry from his thoughts.
Thank you for reading! We have one more sleep 'til Christmas! Unless you're in a different timezone from me. I have 15 minutes until midnight! I hope you all have a lovely day tomorrow!
“Luckily for you, I’ve been drinking wine since I could walk.”
“I don’t know,” Harry murmured. “I guess we’d have to find out.”
“You’re not allowed to defend yourself?” Harry asked.
Draco snorted. “That’s not a cat, it’s a bloody monster.” He ran the end of his quill absentmindedly over his bottom lip. “I’d suggest a snake, but you’d simply hiss at it all the time, and I wouldn’t know if you were griping about me, so that’s definitely out.  And I’ve never liked rodents.”
"You’re allowed to be angry with him, Harry," Draco said suddenly.
"Are you ready, Harry?"
Thank you everyone for your comments! I've been swamped with finals, so I haven't been able to respond to them, but I do see them and they've definitely made these past couple weeks better!
“It’s a yes or no question, Harry,” Draco said patiently, though his expression was anything but. Harry grimaced.
Term was nearly over, and Harry could almost feel the Christmas spirit in the air. He was surprised to say the least--everyone around him was much more cheerful than he’d expected, given the circumstances. He supposed they were all mostly happy to be alive. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t feel similarly.
The rest of the morning went on without incident. Harry managed to escape four different sixth year girls, in addition to--much to Harry’s surprise--a seventh year boy.
"And we were all afraid."
He could always tell when people noticed Draco, blond, poised, and unmistakably Malfoy, standing beside him. Their expressions darkened, like the sky darkening just before an unexpected storm. Even after all these years, they didn’t trust him. And Draco knew it. Everyone did.
“A favour would be letting me sleep for more than two hours.”
“I’ll firecall George in the morning and ask,” said Harry, his smile feeling a bit forced as he set the pillow aside. It still felt strange to refer to George on his own. Harry shook his head slightly to clear his thoughts.
“I accepted that ages ago,” said Harry. “The cane doesn’t make it any easier.”
After the war, Harry stops playing quidditch. He lets people assume it's because of injuries, because he can't bear playing without half of his friends, can't bear seeing Ginny. In reality, the Golden Snitch has become one of his worst nightmares.
Draco’s hand was gentle on Harry’s shoulder, and he leaned into the touch. "It’s okay. I’m right here."
Harry wanders the castle without his invisibility cloak. He can't bear the sight of it. It doesn't matter; people have been avoiding him ever since the end of the war. There are rumors, rumors that his powers have increased ten-fold, and not necessarily for the better. Harry doesn't mind the rumors—they keep people away.
"Harry—"
Harry concentrated on the empty space before him, slowly drawing a circle in the air with his wand, and concentrating on the image in his mind. He lowered his wand and looked down.
He needed to get that book sooner rather than later. Besides, he could almost hear Hermione lecturing him about not avoiding his problems, and Malfoy had definitely become a problem.
Thank you for reading! And thank you for the comments you left on yesterday's chapter!!! :D
If he’d just—

“You said the lights were made by electricity, yeah?” Draco asked, looking around in wonder at the lit windows and fairy lights.
Their hug was far shorter than the hug between her and her son, and much less comfortable, but Harry appreciated it nevertheless.
Thank you everyone for reading so far, and for your lovely comments! <3

“I never really thought it was you, you know,” Draco said quietly, resting his hand on Harry’s left elbow. Harry looked down at it, then shifted to rest on his back.
“When I was younger,” Draco said, completely ignoring what Harry had to say, “my mother was very adamant that I could do anything I put my mind to. I just had to get the technique right. You know the spell, you know what you want. All that’s missing now is the technique.”
“Ron and Hermione don’t invite us places, Harry. They invite you.” Draco reached out and grasped Harry’s hand. “Look, they must really love you if they’re willing to put up with my ferrety self for a night. I doubt Hermione would invite us without Ron’s knowing. Maybe he’s…” Draco paused. “We’re going. We have to.”
Harry sighed and tucked the card  into his pocket. He stood up, pulled on his jumper, and crept from Gryffindor Tower.
“Where’s father?” asked Draco.
The door clicked softly shut behind her, and Harry let out a breath he hadn’t even realised he’d been holding.
There were far too many people keen on kissing The Saviour of the Wizarding World this Christmas. Harry was beginning to consider catching a cold.
“You’re not very good at this
know I’m always happy to help."
Malfoy looked at him, then down at his cane, but didn’t say anything. Nobody ever said anything.
That's all they'd called him.
“Right,” Malfoy said. He picked up Harry’s cane and handed it to him. Finally, he said, “So what’s that for, then?”
“I thought, since we’re going to see Andromeda and Teddy tomorrow, and then to your parents’ the day after, that we could have our own Christmas together tonight.”

"What do you mean?" Draco asked.
Draco snorted. “That you did, Harry.” Draco stopped at a door (
“Ow, fuck!” Draco threw out a hand to keep himself from colliding with the wall of the telephone booth.
me!” said Hermione angrily. “I’ve been looking for you all day, and you show up in a bloody telephone booth?”
Draco laughed, though not unkindly. “As much as I love them, I don’t think even I could handle them for two whole weeks.”
"Then what were you going to say? What was so important that you being raised as a sacrifice was okay?"
Mostly inspired by the fact that I am spending most of tomorrow travelling. It's short because I have to pack now. Thank you for reading!
"Guess the Dreamless Sleep doesn't work."
“I’m sure you did,” Harry said, unable to stop the small smile that came to his lips. “To be honest, you never really struck me as someone who enjoyed sweets.”
He’d been at this for ages, trying to create the white rose wreath that had seemed so simple when Hermione had done it the year before.
“Oh, he was absolutely horrible,” Draco said pleasantly. “One Christmas, he gave me a set of cursed Gobstones, to teach me a lesson of some sort. Mother nearly killed him.”
"How'd you get in here? I have wards—"
"Harry?"
The weekend came faster than Harry had expected. Before he knew it, he’d turned in his final assignment and was packing his trunk for the winter holiday.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait,” he said. “The twelfth? That’s nearly two weeks before Christmas!”
"If I say no, can we stay home?" Harry tried to keep his voice light, tried to smile as he struggled to stop his hands shaking enough to do up the buttons of his shirt.

capable of making mistakes.
The room was empty, but a fire was lit, and there she was, sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace in her usual elegant clothes. Purple, from what he could see by the firelight as she turned to face him.
All of these people had lost so much more than Harry had, yet here he was, being lauded as brave and selfless, when in reality he had been none of those things.
“We’ve only got a few more hours before we have to be back to school,” said Harry. “There’s one last thing I want to show you.”
25 Days of Draco and Harry fest.
“I think I would’ve preferred a Howler, to be honest,” Harry muttered, carefully picking up the parchment. At least he thought it was parchment. It was practically translucent and, knowing Narcissa, was probably made of pure silver.
“I told my friend Hermione I couldn’t revise with her today because I had rehearsal, which she figured out wasn’t true when I made eye-contact with her crossing the street three minutes ago.”
“Who lied?” asked Draco’s mother. “Darling--”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I know your parents are traditional and
“You know he and Mal--Draco don’t get on well,” Hermione said, grimacing when Harry snorted. “Okay, so that’s putting it gently, I know. But he’s also feeling a bit betrayed you didn’t tell us. I did, too, at first.”
“One last question.”
And Harry does.
“Are you proposing?” asked Draco without taking his eyes from the silver ring nestled in the box.
The bed is burning, burning hotter than any fire Draco's ever felt, and for a second he feels afraid. The fire doesn't hurt when he touches it. It doesn't burn as he climbs through the flames, into the bed, and pulls a surprisingly—terrifyingly—cold Harry to his chest. And the flames stop.
So I've never had Christmas Pudding (yayyy Americans) and didn't know if it was something only eaten on Christmas Day, so forgive me if this is a little bit...wrong.
"You gave Longbottom quite a scare, but I'm sure he'll recover. He always does. Are you alright?"
As much as he despised the ordeal, Harry was thankful. The longer he and Draco were kept in the entry hall, the less time he had to spend in the Great Hall, surrounded by the memories of broken bodies and broken mothers.
Day Two of hols2014 at Slythindor100!
On Christmas morning, Harry looks absolutely miserable. Not because he'd expected more (or any) presents—he's never done that, even after attending Hogwarts—but because there a few there.
live in the Louvre. I just needed to get the boys to his house, but that is the reason why it's mentioned that Narcissa's in Paris. (Artistic license or something.) Thank you for reading!
Draco loved to be the first to wake in the morning. It wasn’t unusual--Draco’s job meant early mornings more often than it didn’t, and Harry’s day started considerably later. What
“Merry Christmas.”
Harry waited for Draco to turn around before he bent down and picked up a handful of snow. He pressed it into a lumpy ball and, before Draco had a chance to look back to see where he’d got to, Harry threw the snowball, hitting Draco square in the back.
“You brought me all the way up to the coldest room in the castle, at twelve in the morning, to play a game.”
Andromeda swatted his shoulder lightly. “Mind your manners, young man, or I might have to keep Teddy away from you. We already had an event this morning, though I suppose he’s always cranky around the full moon.”
“Okay,” he said. “Fantastic.”
"We’re nearly there," Draco said, giving Harry’s hand a tight squeeze. He glanced over his shoulder to make sure they weren’t being followed and unlocked a nearby door. He pushed Harry through it and closed the door behind them.
Draco's low-key a self-insert of myself. Ferris wheels (heights in general)
"You are allowed to be angry, just like you were allowed to be afraid that night."
Draco leaned against the wall of the telephone booth and listened wearily to his mother chattering on about the weather in France. Really, he did like hearing from his mother, but she certainly had a talent for prattling on about nothing in particular.
“I used to cook for the Dursleys,” Harry said. “It was one of the few chores I actually liked while I was there.”
“Harry.”
“It’s quite strange to be home,” he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry took Draco’s hand and squeezed it tight, and the pair of them followed Ginny into the kitchen.
They aren't quite sure where they stand. On one hand, Draco's mother had saved him; on the other, Harry had gotten her killed. He'd gotten a lot of people killed.
“Draco,” Harry said, backing away. “Draco, remember how much you love me and that it’s Christmas and if I don't come back, somebody will—agh!”
In hindsight, this may not have been the best idea, Harry thought, watching as Draco bent over to scoop up his own handful of snow. He turned, forming it into a ball as he stared Harry down.
“Mine is the time my mother and I went down into Wiltshire to see the lights. I know you think my family was all Muggle hating and cruel, but my mother could put that aside when she chose.” Malfoy moved as if to run his hands through his hair, but then stuffed them into his pockets instead.
her I didn’t want to revise.”
“And--”
“It’s a keychain.”
, but I’m fairly certain even they wouldn’t raise an infant on wine.”
Harry stared down at the parchment in his hands. He wished he hadn’t written that last sentence about the Burrow. Hermione was going to worry even more, and she’d tell Ron, and Harry would have to fend off another round of questions about just what had happened between him and Ginny over the summer.
“Considering our...less than pleasant history, I’m surprised you didn’t run screaming at the thought.” Draco rested his hand on Harry’s arm. “As much as I’d love to spend Christmas with my family, I know the Manor is full of terrible memories for both of us. if you don’t want to go, we can stay here, or you can go to--”
“Look, father,” Draco said, quickly banishing that thought from his head. “I’m happy and I’m safe, and no, I’ll never really know if this was the best choice, but it’s the one I’ve made and it’s going to work.”
Short one today! This has reminded me to buy candy canes. Thanks for reading!
“Right after I thank him for the Wheezes quill he slipped into my bag a few weeks ago,” Harry said lightly. Andromeda’s smile faded, and Harry knew she wanted to ask how he and Ron were getting on, but he didn’t want to ruin the evening with his answer. Draco cleared his throat slightly.
“What are you doing here?” Ron asked, frowning at Draco again. “What’s he doing here?”
I know this isn't very Christmassy yet, but there's a bit of set-up that needs to happen first! Thank you for the comments on the first part of this! I'm glad people are enjoying it! I'm trying something different since I've done 25 Days a few times!
He led Harry up a flight of stairs by the hand, their footsteps echoing against the marble.
“You thought we’d abandon you because you’re dating this ferrety git?” she asked, and seemed to suddenly remember Draco was still there. “And
And so it went. They played for what felt like hours, with questions as small and meaningless as “What’s your favourite colour,” to questions as serious as “Does your Mark ever hurt anymore?” Both of them were competitive and stubborn enough not to pass as long as the other didn’t, so the bag of Every Flavour Beans sat forgotten on the floor, until:
“And I’m doing what I know is right for me,” Draco said, and looked at his father at last. “I know you did what you thought was right, but it wasn’t, and I’m doing everything I can to make things better. Harry saved me, he saved this family, and if your petty hatred won’t let you see that, then you’re going to have to blast me off this tapestry, because I won’t be your son anymore.”
“I know I was a little shit about my money in school, but I’d like to think I had more tact than that,” Draco sniffed.
Malfoy looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then silently held out the bag of jelly beans. Harry took one and put it in his mouth, delighted when it turned out to be blackcurrant.
“I hate these stairs,” Harry said, needing to break the silence.
Thank you for reading!
This is the post for yesterday (Dec 18).
Draco looked away. “I’m not--” he sighed. “What if I’m not like him? What if I can’t do it?”
“It was a call to France. I definitely had to hang up on my mum like that,” said Draco. “Besides, I still don’t know why revising has led to you hiding in a telephone booth--
Dumbledore twinkled cheerfully at Harry from his frame, and beside him was Snape, scowling at Harry like he’d just blown up a cauldron in Potions class.
Flickr isn't letting me post the photo for today, but know that it can be found
those." And, like, am I wrong? They are pretty funny, though. Thank you for reading! I hope you've enjoyed the first two weeks (!?!??!!!!) of this fest!
“We live on bread and water, actually,” Harry said. “Neither of us can be bothered to turn on the kettle.”
“My chest, it’s not--” Harry took a steadying breath. “You know what happened in the forest. Your mother must have told you.”
Harry flushed apologetically and undid the dark blue ribbon around Narcissa’s note as Draco strode from the room. Narcissa’s handwriting was perfect and elegant where it curled and looped across the page in dark ink. It was a shame it was so beautiful, really. It made Harry feel worse for not wanting to read it.
Day ten of Slythindor100's 25 Days of Draco/Harry fest! :D
“I was trying to make a wreath,” Harry snapped. “But I can’t. Just like I can’t transfigure anything larger than a mouse, or keep my champagne flute from shattering in Charms when we do the Unbreakable Charm.”
“You should be in Azkaban, you bloody Slytherin!”
Maybe Draco was trying to drive him mad. Harry was fine with that, he wished Draco had the courtesy to do it at a time later than eight am.
I saw today's prompt and immediately thought "wow Draco would
“I won’t let anything happen,” Harry promised, taking Draco’s scarf and draping it over his shoulders. He smoothed his hands over Draco’s shoulders and pulled him in for a kiss. “Ready?”
Harry's always loved the scent of evergreen.
“Maybe we’ll get lucky and one of George’s fireworks will misfire, and we’ll all have to leave early,” Harry muttered, grimacing apologetically at the furious scowl Draco sent him. To be honest, he’d rather face a horde of angry and betrayed Weasleys than one angry Draco. With that thought in mind, he took Draco’s hand and let the flames whisk them away.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Harry said.
And it was true. The rage he’d felt earlier was back and it was growing with every passing second. Draco’s jaw clenched, and he nodded stiffly, but Harry was already speaking.
“After dealing with Hermione’s cat for so long, I’m surprisingly not too fond of cats,” Harry said.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It wasn't quidditch. It's—never mind."
“A ticket for the Hogwarts Express,” he murmured, feeling strangely choked up. He hadn’t seen one since his sixth year. “It’s awfully pretty for a portkey, isn’t it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just focus on what you want,” he murmured.
“It’s nothing new,” Harry said with a shrug. “To be honest, I don’t think I’ve had more than a few hours’ sleep at a time since about fourth year.”
“Come on, Harry,” said Draco. “My room’s this way.”
“Pass,” he said quietly, staring into his lap. “I’m not talking about that.”
Harry doesn't move his eyes from the fireplace, doesn't say a word as Draco moves closer.
“And whose fault is that, you fucking idiot!”
“Hey!” Harry shouted, moving towards the boys and shoving them back, one by one. “Leave him alone!”
“Tchai
“I’ll be the one to decide that,” said Harry.
"It’s just a few more hours, and then we can leave," Draco said, sounding like he was trying to reassure himself just as much as he was Harry.
"Are you?"
At least it gave him an opportunity to keep up on his French now that he was away from home and his parents’ bickering.
“I’m so tired,” said Harry.
Harry knew he should have comforted Ginny, but instead he went over and sat beside Draco. They didn't say anything, didn't really need to, but it was enough.
“I think we can rule out the chance of it being a Howler,” Draco said dryly. “If it had been, we would’ve lost our eyebrows ages ago.”
“What?”
Draco smiled.
"I couldn't sleep," Draco responds quietly. "I was going to the kitchens for some cocoa. My mother used to— Care to join me?"
Harry’s head snapped up so quickly that he felt his head collide with the headboard. Scowling, he asked, “Is that really important right now?”
“Aren’t you going to ask what the portkey is?” Draco asked, following with his eyes as Harry went to set Teddy’s neatly wrapped gift on the small pile beside the tree.

Written for the
“With you, it usually does.” Draco turned and rummaged through his bag, but managed to catch the face Harry made. “Your face is really an open book, Harry. How you managed to get away with anything is beyond me.”
Harry surprises both of them when he answers no.
He pulled Draco away from the booth and found a nearby tourist shop. He made Draco wait outside as he dashed inside.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think I’ll go back to my cupboard now,” he muttered, closing the door behind himself.
Draco looked over at Harry and then shook his head. “No, we should go unpack.”
“Relieved,” Harry said slowly. “But…happy, I think.”
And then he was crying, huge stupid sobs that made him shake and gasp as the tears ran down his dirty cheeks. He tried to stop, afraid of who might be watching; ashamed that, after everything that had happened,
I keep trying to write fluff (it's a CHRISTMAS FIC!!!) but my hands are like "no, only mild angst allowed!!!" There are still 21 more days, though, hahaha. Thank you for reading! :D
His hands were steady as he slowly made his way down the column of buttons. Then, he reached up and did up Harry’s tie, careful not to tighten it too much. Harry hated when his ties were too tight.
The man straightened, groaning slightly as his knees popped.
"Who says I’m panicking?" Harry asked, lips finally quirking into a genuine smile.
“No, Potter,” said Malfoy quickly, reaching out as if to grasp Harry’s hand. “Thank you.”
“You don’t want a puppy, but you’re okay with a blast-ended skrewt?”
They apparated into Godric’s Hollow Graveyard. Harry paused, still holding onto Draco, and then stepped away.

of his cane against the stone floors. It was freezing, but Hogwarts was always cold in the winter. At least that bit hadn’t changed.
. He just says thank you, and then rearranges them so they can sleep.
"I'm just so tired."
"No, Draco!" Harry snapped. "You wanted me to be angry, so now you get to hear me be angry!"
Harry held up the food container and pensive vial. “Can you take a short break?”
Molly seemed to fall over herself to hug Draco just as tightly as Hermione had outside. “Oh, goodness. You’re too thin. Harry, have you not been feeding him?”
“I’m impressed, Potter. You took family dedication seriously, did you not? Even my family isn’t that bad, and we’ve been inbreeding for generations.”
Malfoy startled but smiled back, nodding.
Harry sucked his lower lip into his mouth and bite hard, body achingly hard, especially with how relaxing his bath had been.
Hermione waved a frustrated hand at Ron, wiping her eyes with the other. “This from the man who was too afraid to come break up you guys kissing because he might say something wrong or see something he shouldn’t, so he sent his pregnant wife to do it.”
Harry smiled, “Maybe a bed?” Draco’s breath caught, and he cleared his throat several times. “I mean, to cuddle. I don’t expect more. I can go home.”
Harry turned, cupping Draco’s jaw and kissing him, soft, slowly deepening it until the other man sighed and sank into him. “I know. I still wanted to try. For you.”
The one who seemed to be in charge waved as he stepped outside. “Morning, Mister Potter, sir. We’ve just about got these decorations up. I’d suggest you put some shoes on before you look at them, though.”
“I should have done something sooner, back then. I knew you couldn’t have, that you didn’t.” Remus choked and dropped his head back. “I let Dumbledore convince me. I’m so sorry.”
Nott scoffed and walked away, broom over his shoulder. Draco glared at him, kicking the heel of one shoe against the ground. “Ignore him.”
Calling for Grinch, Harry scrawled a note to Gringotts, sending 2,000 galleons each to Dragon Defense and Protection Foundation in Hagrid’s name, Werewolf Aid, Support, and Protection for Lavender, Wizarding War Memorial for Colin, Wizarding Pride Project for Dumbledore, and Quidditch for Healing Foundation for Regulus before finishing getting ready for work.
Harry’s head came up, forehead wrinkled as he frowned. “Tell them? About spending time with me or…”
Harry ran his hand down Draco’s chest and stomach, word-and-wandlessly popping open the buttons on both the waistcoat and shirt, letting him nip at the jut of Draco’s collarbone. “I want to taste every angle of your body, lick all that sharpness right off you.”
Draco laughed and nodded then gasped. “Oh! Speaking of snitches.” He pulled the snitch ring box Harry had sent him from his pocket. “I forgot to ask.” He snapped open the empty box, waggling it at Harry with a haughty brow raise. “What’s the meaning of this?”
Malfoy’s head swiveled around, one brow lifting. “Didn’t think you were either.”
Harry’s whole body seemed to light up as he agreed, but he’d then demanded they do it right by pureblood standards, meaning a fancy restaurant and dressing up and Harry picking Draco up at his flat and everything. “If this matters to you, then it matters to me.”
Harry pulled back, making Draco whine as he’d been tugging the two of them toward the bed. “I don’t want to rush you. I know you don’t trust me again, yet, and I don’t want to hurt you.”
“Harry can be an idiot. He was an idiot. Idiots can still fall in love, though. Just give him a chance? Maybe?”
Hands shaking, Harry walked over and lifted the note from the package.
When they parted, Draco leaned into Harry’s side for a moment, “Lunch again tomorrow?”
“But?”
“Just because?”
Harry grinned, stealing one more kiss before standing. “Always.”
Harry stretched, rubbing his lower back. Since Christmas Day was pretty quite for his section of the DMLE, most issues being funneled to the fire section or the St. Mungo’s, he’d spent the day catching up on paperwork. He’d put a decent dent in it all, but he was more than ready to head to Andromeda and Teddy’s for dinner.
Harry blinked the one eye he had opened, as if the flowers might disappear. Dropping his hand, he groped for his glasses, which were on top of his head. Once they were settled onto his face, though, he was still staring four sets of flowers. Walking forward, he examined the four bundles. The first he knew were lilies, a large red bow wrapped around their vase, the second were red roses with a green bow around them, and the third were sunflowers with a gold bow. The final vase held small purplish-blue flowers that looked too delicate to touch and had a silver bow.
Harry felt himself grinning back, crouching down to grab a handful of snow, and the fight was on.
Draco was bright pink again. “I never actually did anything. I mean, Aunt Bella didn’t try to go after Tonks, and Remus always kept her protected.”
date matters so much as asking about
Shuddering, Harry groaned and slanted his lips over Draco’s, mouths fusing and tongues thrusting in a mimicry of what their bodies were about to do. Pulling away, Harry stripped his jeans and pants slowly, giving Draco a moment to catch his breath and make sure he really wanted this. When no denial came, he murmured the incantation for lube and moved back onto the bed, sliding his hand between Draco’s legs to coat his hole before slipping that same seeking digit from before back inside.
“No.” Harry wrapped his arms around him, tweaking his nipples and making him cry out. “But I plan on trying out some Slytherin silver on every flat surface in here.”
She nodded. “I’ll invite Ron and Hermione, too, if that’s all right.” Harry nodded. “Good. Now, help me finish cutting up these pies, and I’ll make up so tea. Then, we can go listen to the Celestina Warbeck Christmas program.”
“No, sweetie. Trinket is getting the table set. We’re just waiting on you. Once dinner is done, I’ll have Teddy open his gift from you.”
Though Harry had agreed to keep the little bird, if you can call not arguing with a letter agreeing, he hadn’t been able to bring the bird home. Instead, he’d sent his assistant to the pet shop for a cage, stand, supplies and seed, and had set Grinch up with a little home and all the necessities at the office. He’d refused to make eye contact with those big golden orbs while he readied himself to go home late that night, but the tiny whoo as he’d opened the door had stopped him.
“I’m alright, thanks.”
"Holy shit"
"Draco-Draco listen to me."
Draco sighed.
Harry's eyes lit up.
“A couple…”
Mrs. Haversham peeked her head in the door.
“But Harry’s being an arse!”
"You don't know that."
He twisted around and watched the rest of the roof slide into the back, a panel covering it seamlessly.
“He demanded the facts and so I told him.”
“Did she suffer?”
carved into his skin.
"Remember what I said when we were in Hogsmeade?"
The wizard took a sip of champagne and looked up to find a distraught looking Potter in his field of vision.
“Erm-yes, yes I’ve got it.”
“Yes, sir.”
"Yeah, well...maybe we can get a flat together," he jokes.
"I can't stop."
They headed for a little pub on the east side of the town, the broomstick screeching loudly as they pulled into the lot at a speed far beyond unnecessary. Harry just rolled his eyes at Draco’s smug grin, passersby murmuring because it’ not often that a stupidly fast broom like his was seen in a small town like Hogsmeade. The pale wizard hovered the sleek transport into one of the ports on the side of the building, setting an extra ward on it so if anyone tried to steal it, they’d turn an abhorrent shade of yellow for-oh, about an hour. They made their way to the front doors which open automatically, and an elven host showed them to a booth by the window.
“It’s wonderful to finally meet you,” he said.
“Draco,
“Well, he would-he would put me in these situations, force me to smile and then he’d take pictures.”
The boy stiffened and turned to face him.
Harry fumbled with the thing, muttering about how
He obliged and was immediately enveloped in the conversation. After the battle, the eighth year students had all taken to sitting together during meals. Except for dinner. The professors allowed it-especially after they'd all been through, though he suspected it might have something to do with the student dynamic. The eighth years had seen some shit and there were new students. Best not to scare them.
“It’s alright, love,” Draco reassured him.
"I love you a lot, Draco Malfoy."
“Oh, no-no, that’s not why, I just…”
”I’m so sorry.”
“I’m sorry, Draco.” His voice was clear and strong, now.
“I’m coming, I’m coming…”
"Ron, shut up. This is one of those moments where you need to shut up. And trust me."
"I-Draco?"
Draco furrows his brow.
"No, you're right. I don't. But you also don't know if they want you to...y'know. It's all conjecture. But the least you can do is look to see what the people around you want for you, since the dead don't seem very talkative!" He spat. Draco stiffened, and ran hands along his eyes. The wind howled outside, whistling through the broken window.
"Yes Potter?"
"What do you think you're doing??"
“Draco?”
“Excuse me?”
"Do you think that's what the people I hurt would have wanted?"
Harry breathed, while Draco was still going through his pockets for the wand. A calloused hand on his wrist stopped him.
He sent the blade flying into the trash can, then healed the gash with magic.
“It’s not that simple. Of course I’m going back. There’s a bunch of complicated muggle bullshit that comes with being a legal guardian, and I’ve got to save Hedwig.”
Draco glared at him.
Harry grabbed the supplies they needed from the counter, levitating the rest over to the far end of one of the Slytherin tables, where Draco lurked in the shadows. He flinched away immediately.
"A full meal."
Draco closed his eyes.
“No, no it’s not. And it was almost for nothing, her sacrifice was…and I
“Harry it’s alright. I’m fine now.”
“Nobody plans panic attacks, Harry.”
“Harry says he’s leaving.”
“Wait why can’t you just transfigure the walnuts into pancakes?”
A crack rang out, like the sound of something hitting a wall. Like bone against tile.
"Fuck, hold on-lemme grab my pyjamas," Harry said.
“Might be a little too dark, but…”
(See the end of the chapter for
She grins.
Harry emerged from his room in jeans, a polo and a fleece, thundering down the stairs and walking up to give Hermione a hug. She whispered something in his ear, and Draco narrowed his eyes.
Neither of them make eye contact for a short while, Draco chewing on his lip and Harry fiddling with his hands.
Harry caught him by the sleeve and dragged him onto the bed, and they had a quick romp in the sheets before Draco’s OCD got the better of him.
He turned back to Draco.
Harry just sat on his bed, staring at the floor. Ron always showered in the evening; he took his in the morning. The wizard stripped, slid a pair of sweats and a shirt over his wiry frame.
"Dolor Aggravesci!" Draco cried, then clenched his jaw as the wounds in his stomach somehow worsened.
“I know. I just...thought you were Bellatrix. Thought you were here to finally finish it.”
"Erm...okay so...powdered slug...and then..." Harry talked to himself subconsciously, not acclimated to having someone stare at him with such silent intensity.
“Name’s taken.”
"I just want to help you."
"I could fix it. Who knows."
there ya go. Fluff.
“Evening, Jameson. Er…” he looked over to the R8 and smiled.
"That's-is that allowed?"
He was screaming, contorting grotesquely.
She shook her head and dried her eyes.
He headed back toward the mess hall, and the wary professor returned to her desk. She'd replaced Dumbledore as headmaster and there was quite a bit on her plate.
"Maybe he just knows 'e deserves it, piece of-"
angrily ate a pancake and a half.
"Out!! Now!"
“It is
huge-but it was pretty remarkable. Harry pretended to be unimpressed and followed the wizard to a massive pile of trunks, taking the ones handed to him and levitating them down the entrance and onto the floor below. Draco climbed down from the stack with a large case swinging clunkily at his side. His blood ran cold when he saw what Harry was looking at it.
Harry unwound the gauze carefully, sliding it under Draco's back and around again.
Okay. So. The first one...erm, becoming a death eater.”
“He was alone.”
Draco just nodded.
"...you could have stopped them, Draco. You fought in the bloody war."
"Alright, wands down everyone, please sit. Place your potions at the front of your desks..."
“No you’re not.”
He smirked.
Harry looked at the ground, clenching his fist and shuddering, like he was panicking and hiding it badly.
It was dusk when Harry awoke and he found Draco going through old pictures on his phone. He panicked just a touch, recalling the time Dudley stole it and dropped it in the toilet, jeering him about his texts to Hermione. Harry told him she was just a friend and ‘I actually know girls. Unlike some people, I’m not desperate to try and fuck each one I meet!’. He still felt the fracture in his orbital bone from that day, and worse things in other places from that night.
"Good Godrick-Malfoy, was that humour?"
“How did you know that?”
“What about our luggage?”
Harry ran up the stairs and was blocked by Dudley, who was flung into his room with the mutter of a spell from Harry’s chapped lips. The doors slammed shut and locked him in.
Everyone was after him. All of them. None of them had the wherewithal to get away with killing him, though, and the only injuries he sustained were from either overconfident youngsters or hateful eighth years who weren’t sure what was worse-that he’d crossed a line and become a criminal, a murderer, or that he was fucking Harry. The antithesis of all things-well, all things Malfoy.
"Well, I'm really sorry. That's awful."
Harry nodded, suddenly self-conscious.
Her gaze trailed down to where Harry lay, safely in his arms. She smiled.
"Did you-wait where were you? You didn't get wasted, did you?"
Harry thought he just might be crying.
"I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry..." Harry whispered, muttering incantations to heal him. His bones popped back into place and it was agony.
The tiniest amount of guilt stabbed at Draco’s chest, and he took the coat from Harry gratefully.
could be heard from hidden speakers. The seatbelt icon lit red and Draco removed his hastily. He hated feeling trapped.
Harry grimaced and they slid into the cold leather seats.
Harry nodded and threw an arm around him, noticing the way his whole body tensed when the tape started rolling.
"Ron!" He giggled.
“I don’t think we should watch those. I don’t think you should relive that.”
He felt a twinge of guilt.
He was all of those things, but it was nothing new and it did not stir anything deep inside of him. There were no flashbacks of his parent’s wedding photos or his mother helping him tie a Windsor Knot. Just a sort of creaky, aching feeling in his chest as the emptiness was once again realised. Grief wasn’t at all cinematic, and Draco was thoroughly disappointed.
"Did you
Harry's face paled.
"It sure doesn't look that way."
"Is that so?"
"Carry on," he said.
He cried for an hour straight that night, and when they woke up to the busy sounds of London traffic and grey light in the rain drop-studded windows, his shirt was still wet and salty.
"Draco?" Harry called.
He re-wrapped the bloodied gauze around his torso and washed his hands frantically. Slightly ticked off, he opened the door.
All Hallow’s Eve had come and gone and now they were sat on the train home with Hermione, Ron, Luna and Blaise. He was trying to get along with the others. Blaise was practically the only Slytherin who didn’t peg Draco for a traitor at present.
“The chocolate cake. It was your idea.”
It was clear he wasn't going to fall asleep any time soon. Cautious not to wake his slumbering roommate, Harry stepped into his slippers and crept downstairs, invisibility cloak tight around his shoulders.
“You didn’t-“
She just nodded and wiped her hands on her apron, shooting Harry a sympathetic look but not bothering to stop her husband. The man’s gaze snapped to Draco.
“No, I am
“I can’t-I’ve got to unpack the luggage.”
“Why don’t they call it a teaspoon?”
like he’d given up on trying to clean the thing. He leaned back with a smug look on his face.
Draco cocked an eyebrow.
He slid down to the floor next to her and held her.
A sleek glass of water was clammy in his hand and even clammier against his chapped lips, and he wiped his chin with a silken sleeve.
Draco nodded tearfully.
“I know. But um...you know what he did to me, yeah?”
Actually, he’d never been on any sort of muggle flying contraption. The only experiences he had with flying were solely magic-based. He did not for one second trust the ramshackle chamber of death that hung precariously in the clouds, the one he was currently trapped inside. His knuckles were white against the cream leather.
"What about-do you have anyone else?"
"You'd like that, wouldn't you? It's not like you're stopping us now!"
Narcissa squeezed her eyes shut in a manner just shy of a wince and nodded.
"I know."
“Shut up Malfoy,” he said, grinning.
“Right. Well, he hasn’t been eating. Nightmares. And he’s been...well he’s been…”
Without warning, Harry leaned down and planted a kiss on the place where the blade used to be.
Ron and Hermione were talking on the couch in the common room.
“Yeah, the one that looks all weird?”
"Draco..."
Harry's eyes shot open in alarm and Draco immediately pulled back.
“You’re an arse!” Harry shouted, and ran to his room to collect his few belongings and change. With a single suitcase, a backpack and a rattled-looking Hedwig, he ran down the narrow staircase and left his things by the front door and returned to the kitchen to retrieve Draco. Vernon was red as a tomato and panting, surrounded by every kitchen knife and fork from the drawer by the sink. Harry sighed.
He disappeared again and a slightly rattled Harry crept up the sprawling staircase to find his partner.
“If you’re gonna have a domestic, take it outside.”
"What would happen if you did? Surely someone would take you in."
Harry blinked the thought away, earning a curious look from Draco that was about as fleeting as his gaze as it darted around the room like a trapped starling.
"Holy shit. How-why?"
Harry immediately regretted that statement.
Draco tilted his head, thinking. Willing the voices to shut up with their choruses of
That night, he slept far better than he had before, and he wondered how much of it was his admirer and his gifts or joy of having given himself a day off to just enjoy life.
“If you’re sure, Mr. Draco.”
Growling softly, Harry gripped Draco’s hips and pulled him close again, lips slanting over his. “I hadn’t expected, hadn’t meant.”
“If he can, he’ll never tell you.”
Grinch landed on his shoulder as he made it downstairs, running late due to getting lost in his thoughts, so he used the floo rather than walking as he preferred. Draco was arriving as he did, hair perfectly coifed back off his face. Harry wanted to run his fingers through it, muss it up, and he blushed.
Harry laughed harder, jerking his head to the side. “I’ve got extra tees and joggers in the dresser, if you want something more casual than last night’s clothes.” He dipped his head to scrape his teeth over the curve where Draco’s throat met his shoulder, the spot marked by one of several bruised love bites, grinning when the other man whimpered and arched his neck. “Though, I’m also fine with what you’re wearing, now.” Winking at Draco, who was sure his whole body was blushing, Harry left.
Harry laughed, pointing up the hill. “That’s where we’d practice quidditch in the summers. And the garden is there. I love it.”
They laid there quietly for a while, Harry staring at his star. He finally lowered his binoculars, one tear running down into his hairline. “Thank you.” He turned his head, smiling at Draco stretched out next to him. “Thank you.”
So sorry to be a day behind! My family is an eight-hour drive from where I live, and between packing and the trip, I wasn't able to finish on time. Here is day eight, though, and I will continue with day nine tomorrow. Thank you all for reading and your patience!!
Draco shuddered, eyes rolling back and closing at Harry’s words. “Oh, gods.” No one had ever said such things to Draco before and to hear them in Harry’s voice, rough with desire. Draco was already harder than ever been before.
Harry reached out and grabbed Draco’s hand, squeezing as the other man’s rant came to a sudden halt. “There’s nothing wrong with any of that. It’s easy, when you’ve heard something your whole life, to believe it. And especially when you’ve heard so much of how you disappoint someone you wanted to impress, that you grew up wanting to make happy, make love you.” His thumb rubbed over the back of Draco’s hand, knowing he spent a long time trying to keep Vernon and Petunia happy, probably would have spent even longer caught up in their opinion had he not found a real home in Hogwarts. Draco, though, never had that. “You’re not a disappointment, though. Honestly, with what you’ve overcome, you’re one of the strongest people I know. There’s nothing wrong with what you’re doing with your life or with you.”
Draco bit his lip and ducked his head. “I…yes. Both. All of it. I know we’re not close anymore, and we’ve drifted even farther apart since my father was released on parole, but.” He paused and laughed a little, shaking his head then looking back up at Harry. “But I’m not afraid to tell them I’m spending time with you.”
Blushing, Draco shook his head. “I brought more in that bag than just your gift. Just in case.”
Harry looked down at his bare, snow-covered feet. Cursing under his breath, he went back inside and yelled for Kreatcher, shoving his feet into shoes. The elf popped up before him, and he pointed outside. “What is going on here?”
They were both laughing and covered in snow, Harry taking longer than normal with making snowballs to give Teddy a more even chance, when he heard Teddy yell.
The wrinkled elf scoffed at him. “Great Harry Potter thinks Kreatcher doesn’t know what’s going on in his own home? Thinks food just magically appears with no help from old Kreatcher?”
until Kreatcher called him for dinner. Sitting on the table was charred fillet steak and a wine bottle.
"I'm usually the right, but I can switch. I mean!"
Harry shrugged. “You’ll get over it. Come help us but the ribbon on.”
Draco choked on a bit of tea at the words ‘harden up,’ quickly wiping his face and nodding along. “I’ll have to try that. In the morning. The technique I mean.” Draco felt how flushed his face had become, silently cursing his fair complexion. The waitress returned with his food, however, and he focused on thanking her and setting up his utensils.
Harry laughed, nodding. “He’s pretty amazing, really. And yeah, I do like him. I like him a lot, really. More than I realized. And I want you all to meet him, really meet him, as you are now.”
Draco turned, as well, laughing softly. “It was a big day for a kid.”
“Larkspur.” Draco seemed just as surprised as the other two that he’d spoken. “It’s. Mother has gardens with lots of flowers and such, so I’ve seen. They’re larkspur.”
Draco paled, reaching over to clasp is left arm where the pale pink remnants of his Mark still existed. “Evan Rosier’s nephew, correct?”
Harry laughed, “I don’t think either of us will ever admit to that, but I won’t deny it, either.”
Harry laughed and joined in, Teddy soon yell-singing along the handful of words he picked up on. Draco grimaced and teased them for not matching pitch and often being out-of-time with the tune. He learned the lyrics faster than Teddy, though, and he started whispering them to the little boy a line ahead to help him yell out more.
Two hours later, the first patronus arrived, telling George he was needed at home. Lee stepped away after that to keep things even, going back to announcing, this time with no McGonagall to silence him for yelling curse words as he called plays.
He groaned as the warm water enveloped his body, relaxing his muscles. He closed his eyes and dropped his head back, letting himself breath in the sweet musk of his bath. Once he’d sat for a while, he looked at the note.
Draco wiped his eyes with the ball of his hand and looked up at Harry. “You haven’t?”
He felt like the grinch, but he hadn’t the heart to steal anyone else’s joy in order to try and create his own.
“Nope, still Harry. I’ll just meet you in your office. I’ve got tandoori chicken and tikka masala.” Harry walked over to Draco’s office, using a quick wandless spell to unlock and open the door.
“I hate you, too, second Harry.”
With a broken shout, Harry’s hips jerked, his release coating Draco’s hand, hip, and stomach. He dropped down along the blond, wrapping his arms around him and hugging. Smiling, Draco let himself be hauled close, snuggling into Harry’s chest.
“Draco, I didn’t mean to make you have to.”
Draco started to stiffen, expecting a jab at how the mighty had fallen if he’s eating reheated food from muggle places rather than being cooked for by house-elves.
Harry nodded again, studying the purplish shadows under Draco’s eyes that proved he was tired, even if he hadn’t said it. Smiling, he leaned forward and brushed his lips over Draco’s cheek. “Thank you for tonight. For everything. I’ll owl you tomorrow?”
Stunned into action at the sight, Harry walked over and took the note from the little owl’s leg before thinking to check it or the rest of the situation for spells or curses.
Fifth came another package. Unwrapping it, Draco gasped as soft, dark rose sweater unfolded, note tucked inside.
“Not on this trip, no. I was too afraid that Harry would steal them.” Draco winked at his boyfriend, his tension easing with how well their relationship seemed to be accepted by the two men who’d come to mean as much to him, if not more by this point, as his own family.
“Some sort of pasta, shrimp, and pesto dish. Kreatcher told me about it, said it went with the wine I found.” Blushing, Harry rubbed his eyebrow with the back of his hand. “I’m still not good at the whole having money and being fancy thing.”
Draco kissed him again, still just as light as before, then lay back, shifting over to snuggle closer to Harry. He pointed out his constellation, Andromeda, Narcissa, Regulus, even Leo, every star and constellation Harry expressed interest in, explaining their significance and when it would be easier to see some of them.
Harry grinned, pressing their foreheads together. “Definitely.”
“Technically, my having a family box means I can go to any game I want. If you’d like, we could all meet up and watch the Magpies play the Kestrels at the end of the month.”
The rattling of the doors opening jarred Harry out of his musings, and he looked up to see Malfoy holding the door, gesturing for him to go first. Clearing his throat, Harry shoved his hands into his pockets and exited. He could feel the heat of Malfoy following as they crossed the atrium, still smell him, and he paused for a moment to breath deeply before reaching for his pinch of floo powder. Looking over as Malfoy stepped up to the next floo over, Harry took in the sharp lines of Malfoy’s nose and jaw, the shadow beneath his angular cheekbones, wondered if he’d grown into his own face quite so well and blushed, coughing again to hide his embarrassment at his own thoughts, even though no one else could possibly know what he’d just questioned. “Um, have a good, uh, a good night, Malfoy.”
Remus placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezing and smiling down at the young man. “Then, let’s figure out how to get you two speaking again, let you tell him that. Knowing you love him, that you feel the same, will mean a lot.”
Their lunch continued with quiet conversation about their time at Hogwarts and growing up, hands brushing throughout, feet and knees pressed together under the table.
“Whatever it’s going to manifest.” He smiled back up. “I’m fine. Really. Mum asked the same thing this morning, and I told her just what I’m telling you. Go. Give Andromeda and Teddy my love.”
Harry looked from Draco back to the bottle and laughed. “I knew you’d know what it was.” His grin widened when Draco blushed. “I honestly don’t know much about wine, but I liked it.” He shrugged. “I’m learning to enjoy things I like, share them with people I like, rather than.” He trailed off, looking around his house. “Well, rather than just being unhappy, I suppose.”
Lunch started once the first batch were in the oven, Molly piling Draco’s plate high like she did Harry’s that first summer he was over. Hermione continued discussing her plan, and Draco made several comments about who she could speak to in order to strengthen her backing.
Both men spent more time on their feet than in their seats, yelling along with the rest of the crowd and playfully wrestling over who got to be closer to the railing during the tensest parts. Finally, the Seekers dove toward the ground. The crowd was on their feet. The score was close. The Bats offense was shooting down the field toward the goals. They shot the quaffle as the Seekers collided.
Draco gave a strangled laugh, fingers digging into the small of Harry’s back. “Go sit down before I change my mind.”
It took a moment, but then Harry started and pulled his hands away, twisting to lay alongside Draco rather than on top of him. “Oh! You’re a virgin.”
He nodded, taking a sip of tea. “I did. Horace finished up the last school term and is taking the summer to find and move into a new place. I’ll start moving my things in August, make sure I have all I need for my lesson plans.”
“Potter.”
“Draco. As fascinating as that is, I’m twenty-five. I’m not sitting on Santa’s lap.”
“It’s still cute.”
“That’s not fair. You’ve been around me too long. You’re turning Slytherin.”
The next owl arrived as they were finishing their cheese toasties, a portkey attached to the bottom of it. “Okay, we need coats, gloves and scarves. We’re going for a sleigh ride.”
Harry laughed. “I’m not good enough to make waffles, but I do make bacon how you like it.”
“I have to live here because of my job, so I’d hope you were at least going to come back to visit.”
“Draco! I thought you were off today?”
Setting his glass aside, Harry stepped forward and took Draco by the arms. “That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. Sirius would be alive if I’d opened a birthday present. If I’d known what was in there, that I could talk to him, he’d be alive. Instead, I led my friends into the Ministry and a trap. Hell, if he’d bothered to write and tell me, remind me to open it.” He shook Draco once, not enough to hurt or jar him but just enough to slosh the wine in the glass he still held. “He assumed I didn’t want to open it. He thought he was still on the outside, still a Black, that that kept him from being family, being loved. And he’s dead for it. Stop assuming, Draco. Stop thinking you’re only your family name or their expectations of you.”
“I’m not a child.”
The tree man walked up then, motioning to the living room where the tree was up, and several boxes were scattered around it. “All done. Rest is up to you. Happy Christmas.” He pretended to tip a hat and walked off. Harry followed him out just in time to see the decorators leave. Turning back, he saw his house decorated in more Christmas lights that he thought existed in all of England. There were also inflatable reindeer and a Santa. A snowman, a set of angels, and a Grinch. Laughing, Harry shook his.
Harry frowned. “You don’t work all Christmas day. Do you visit your parents, then?”
Draco never looked up from where he was clearing up his trash. “I’m off tomorrow.” Harry wondered if he’d somehow been wrong about the signs when he continued. “You could come by mine, though. After work. I mean, I sort of owe you dinner, right?”
Draco shook his head rapidly, looking as if he still didn’t believe Ron was saying yes. “No, that’s fine. The box is big enough your whole family could come along.” He blushed suddenly. “Not that I’m trying to brag or anything. I just meant.”
Once done, they stopped for a few roasted chestnuts and took the long way home, cutting through the park. Harry paused to throw away the wrapper from their chestnuts, but when he turned around, he was hit in the face with a snowball. Shaking his head and wiping away the snow, he faced a giggling Teddy, already armed with another snowball. Harry grinned back and dove to make his own snowball, Teddy pelting him again as he did.
Draco was quiet for a long moment, and Harry turned back to look at him. “I, uh, I wouldn’t have thought I was someone you’d like. Not after.” His face flushed, and he ducked, running a hand through his already mussed hair. “No matter. I’m glad you’re indulging a bit. You’ve earned a little happiness.”
“I know. I want to. Need to taste you.” His fingers worked at the flies of Harry’s slacks. “Let me?”
“All right, true love. If I’m getting Christmas traditions to cheer me up, you are, too.” Going back inside, he sent a letter off with Grinch the floo-called Andromeda, asking for Teddy to be allowed to come over and help decorate. She agreed, and once Teddy had finished his breakfast and gotten dressed, she floo’d over with him. Harry was standing in the middle of the living room, decorations everywhere and a tangle of lights at his feet.
Harry’s eyes went wide, his whole body shuddering. “You don’t have to.”
The Burrow was chaos, and Harry loved every minute. There were more redheads than he could count, and Little Fred was wrapped around his neck from the minute he walked in. He circled all the rooms, hugging everyone and asking if Molly needed help, only to be shooed back into the living room. He dropped onto the couch, squeezed between Percy and Charlie.
Draco’s hips began a slow rock, thrusting back in time to Harry’s tongue fucking into him. Harry lifted his head long enough to suck on one finger then sink it into Draco. He kissed and nipped around the sensitive rim, slowly thrusting as he turned his wrist to hit that sensitive bundle of nerves that had Draco shouting again and arching off the bed.
Swallowing heavily, Harry looked over at the little bird. He was nothing like Hedwig, not in look or behavior. Nothing like her. Nothing.
Draco snorted. “Did you see Aunt Bella? Or Great-Aunt Wallburga? They were batshit, and it showed. They all started out nice, don’t get me wrong, but as their minds deteriorated, their clothing choices did, as well.”
Harry winced. “You know, you can call me any time. I don’t mind. I know I get caught up with work and all, but.” Andromeda grabbed Harry’s hand, squeezing, and Harry swallowed. “I love spending time with Teddy. I’d like to spend more time with him. And you. And honestly, I probably need to take more time away from work to spend with family.”
Inside was another snitch, and Harry sent Grinch over to his tree before closing the door and chasing down the flying ball. He dropped into his chair, not even looking at his inbox to check for messages before opening the parchment.
So....this is where that misunderstanding and angst happens. There's also some light NSFW.
“Made contact with the subject? You mean me? I’m the subject?” His hands began to shake, and he set the paper back on the coffee table.
Sitting on that same table were four flower bouquets.
thought had his mind going in even different directions.
Draco nodded. “Fourteenth century Germany was the last time it was done wide range, but purebloods kept the tradition up until the early nineteen hundreds.”
After work, Harry showed up at Draco’s with a bottle of Ogden’s and an overnight bag, making Draco smirk when he opened the door.
Harry grinned. “Cops. Muggle Aurors are called cops. How long do you think you’ll be here on that?”
Harry’s lips parted, and he started to lean forward.
Draco smiled and kissed Harry’s cheek. “I don’t think it’s difficult to date you at all. And I’m not out to my parents, but I’m not exactly closeted. My friends know. Your friends know. Your godfathers know.” He frowned and squeezed Harry’s hand. “I’m not trying to hide us, or you, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
Draco scowled and shoved back, accidentally knocking Harry into Walburga’s portrait. Harry grabbed at the cover to keep his balance, revealing the screeching image.
“Padfoot!”
“This is for kids.”
“Did you want to tell me what you wanted for Christmas?”
There was a long pause as Draco took his bite and chewed. He let the silence stretch, having not exactly meant to say so much but also not sure why Potter was even sitting here and speaking with him.
He nodded, bouncing over to start looking at the various bobs and bits that were meant to go on the tree.
Draco’s chest heaved, his breath shuddering out of him, and the fingers of his free hand reached out to clasp at Harry’s arm. The two of them were close, almost as close as they had been at the park. Close enough Harry could hear the click of Draco’s throat as he swallowed. Could feel their breathing start to sync. Feel the tension in their bodies bleed into the air and wind around them.
When Draco’s wand buzzed to let him know his lunch hour was up, he and Harry both jumped, having not thought that much time had passed.
“Did you just buy for grandma?”
Draco shook his head. “Obviously nothing is what I thought.” Feeling himself dissolving into full hyperventilation, Draco groped for his wand in the pocket of the joggers and twisted, apparating back to his flat. Once there, he closed his floo and wards before sinking into the floor to sob.
Harry blushed and scrubbed a hand through his still-damp hair. “Yeah, yeah. I get it. My bad. Don’t suppose you can tell me who he is?” Kreatcher snorted again, and Harry laughed. “Figures. I need to step out, run a couple errands. Not sure how long they’ll take.”
He should touch Harry back. He should kiss Harry back. He should, oh fuck, his body lifted helplessly at the scrape of teeth over his sensitive nipple, thought splintering and exploding as he cried out.
Harry held up the paper with the coordinates. “I need to see. I knew you’d be able. I need to see.”
He could feel more tension in Draco’s body, knew this wasn’t something he’d done often, too nervous about letting people close considering his past. Smiling, Harry teased the head of Draco’s cock with his tongue, slowly sucking it into his mouth and taking more and more down as he started thrusting his finger deeper into Draco. When the tension melted into desire once again, Harry added a second finger, rubbing them over Draco’s prostate then scissoring to open him up. By the time Draco was back to murmuring a mixture of curse words and pleading, Harry was aching with want, but he carefully added a third finger first, wanting to make sure his boyfriend was fully prepped.
“Th-that’s…not why I’m ashamed, it’s the reason why I did it,” he says before sniffling again.
He looks down to see a fluff of white hair, sleeping on his chest.
The moans kept coming and the groans followed. The little gasps in between was what made him think it was too real. He came out of his trance and looked back to the real life Draco.
“Hey, Harry,” Hermione starts.
“Oh god, Harry, that feels so good,” Draco moans as Harry makes multiple “love bites” on his neck. The pale skin contrasting to the rushing blood.
“Um,” Draco cleared his throat, “what do you see?”
Harry slowly takes off Draco’s pants but Draco stops him.
Harry starts to kiss the bulge and it jumps inside the pants.
“Yes, and then I saw us…doing it.”
He looked back and saw…lovers lube. Why was there lube in there- what. There’s no way he thought of this, needed it. Suddenly embarrassment washed over him, and he shut the drawer rather loud.
Once Draco realized why Harry stopped, a flow of precum made a straight line down his dick.
“Please.”
“Wow, so warm and tight,” Harry smiles.
He finally got the belt off and took off his black trousers. All that Draco is left in are his pants, which are also coincidently, black. With a really prominent bulge.
Draco’s dick twitches uncontrollably and he leaks so much precum that it could be cum.
Harry only wished that he could hear the sounds coming from his mouth. So much that he started imagining them. They sounded so real that the his jeans became so tight they were painful.
Harry sat back on the bed behind him, suddenly curious as to what was in the drawer.
“We saw to two arguing your way in there, were you two fighting all night?”
“My Salazar, Potter. Now you’re giving out commands? Really full of ourselves aren’t we?” Draco comments slyly.
“Can we just continue?”
“You gonna move?” Draco says, as if this didn’t affect him.
“Mhm,” Although it comes out a little squeaky.
“I saw you! Okay? I saw you and me. It’s embarrassing and humiliating but if it gets you to stop talking…” Draco says, not making eye contact.
“Are you embarrassed? There’s nothing wrong with bottoming. Sure, they’ll know that you like my dick up your ass, and that you beg for more but-“ a long finger went over Harry’s mouth.
Harry started to move again, slowly, and Draco let out soft moans. Harry abruptly shot forward and slammed right on Draco’s prostate.
“I saw you. And it was very hard to not start…doing that…when you did. I mean you just pulled it out. Without thinking. Right in front of me. And finish-“
Harry immediately conjured a wall that was in the middle but wasn’t all the way across the room it covered about a quarter of it. He leaned against it still hearing Draco. His pants becoming louder.
“Ah! Okay, fine.”
“Okay! Okay…I get it. So you saw me and you? Being happy together?” Draco looks like he was about to cry.
But Harry’s eyes were now locked on the mirror. Draco was undressing frantically while pushing his stuff off the bed. Harry was standing in front of him with a smirk and started taking his shirt off as well. Draco was toned and his pale skin was graceful while Harry had abs with tan skin making him model-like. His v-line was prominent with his hood body shape and he started in kicking his belt. Of course, this was all in the mirror.
“Please just, shut up. For once in your life.” Harry snapped.
“Stupefy!” Harry yell.
Draco and Harry get dressed in the clothes they wore the day before and go out to breakfast.
“Clearly,” Harry says, smiling. I guess Draco hadn’t noticed that he has a very strong erection, bursting through the seems of his pants.
“What was that about?” Ron asks.
“I-It’s okay. I…I understand what happened, we’re still young and hormonal,” Harry tried to sound supportive, but he was still wary.
“How do you know that?”
“I see…us.”
“Y-you, um, you touched my chest-“
“Yes.”
Harry looked but at the mirror just to see him pounding into Draco and Draco orgasming uncontrollably.
“Are you seriously hard right now?”
“Well what does it do exactly?” Draco asked, actually curious.
“Mm. So do you mind me describing the steamy, hot, sex I had with Ron?”
“Um, nothing never mind.”
Harry “sludgely” opens his eyes.
“Yes!…Please.”
“Your turn.”
“You look really hot in a black suit,” Harry breathes, breathing heavy before kissing him again. He slowly makes his way down Draco’s throat.
“Can you put it in now, Harry?”
“Don’t get too excited,” Harry smirks.
Draco breathes in deeply. “Please do not talk about you getting it on with Weasley right now.”
“Yeah?” He says as he takes a bite out of his cream covered bagel.
Harry saw himself. But with Draco. Older, maybe in their 20’s. A matching band on both their hands, which were intertwined. Draco was looking at Harry lovingly, and Harry returned the favor. Harry’s breath hitched and he stumbled back slightly.
“Um, Ron, Hermione, there’s something you need to know…” Harry began but then a pale hand covered his mouth.
“Why would you tell them- it was your first time?”
“That was my first time,” Harry admits as he swallows all the cum.
“No, just in general. It was just my first time having sex.”
“You’re up,” He says to Harry.
He grabs Draco’s arm, who looks like he is in a trance, and pulls him to the mirror.
He felt compelled to look back toward the glass and saw him and Draco now fully going at it. His dick going in and out, in and out. Draco’s face in the mirror was the best thing there. He looked as if he was falling apart. Red cheeks, rolled eyes, tears forming at the corners, and he looked loaded with pleasure.
“I-I actually meant Ron…” Harry says, without a thought.
Harry slowly took Draco off him began to get dressed. His erection already went down.
Harry slams the rest in before leaning down right next to Draco’s head. He sits there for a while, letting out a deep, low moan.
“W-wait you can’t just put it in like that,” Hart smirked at Draco’s words, he wasn’t going to do that of course. He has respect, but he wants to here the reason why.
“Mm, let’s go eat.”
When Draco woke up he was rather red-faced. He sat up and looked around.
“Then what?”
Draco shifts on his chest, now his face is planted right on Harry’s abs (from playing quidditch so much, you really work up a sweat).
Harry smirks as he notices the huge tent in Draco’s robes.
Draco finished taking off Harry’s belt right as Harry started taking off Draco’s.
“Why not. We are enemies after all. Shouldn’t we be arguing? Shouldn’t we be insulting each other? Shouldn’t I be be sour?”
“Aw fuck, I really came,” Draco mutters.
“Look, Malfoy, if it makes you feel any better, Ron almost made me do that too,” Harry plays.
Draco saw himself. Himself with Harry. A matching band on both their hands. Early 20’s. The image made Dracos stomach flutter. He looked to the ground, his face growing really red. He had no idea this was what he wanted. But it started to make sense as he thought about it. Even so, confusion crossed his mind, never leaving.
“Ha~ ah! Oh wait! Fuck!-“ Draco shouts, Harry’s dick halfway in, already pressing hard against his prostate.
“Yeah no, I don’t make it a habit of lying, and I want them to know that prestigious, little Malfoy likes it up the ass-“ a whole hand covers his mouth this time.
“What just happened, Draco?” Draco took one of his hands and placed it over his face that was turning red rapidly. The other went on
“What do you mean “not fair”?” Draco questions.
“What.”
Harry takes off his pants and a very, very, large thing bounces out, hot and erect.
“I would be too if I came like that,” Harry remarks, only to get hit by Draco.
Draco stretches his leg over Harry’s and Harry could feel a prominent bulge in Draco’s black pants.
“Fuck!” Draco fisted the blankets, “Stop hitting me there,” he says, even more precum slipping out.
Harry stifles his laughter.
“U-um, so what do you see now.” Draco says.
Harry takes him deep in and the tip smashes against his throat.
Harry smirks, “I was going to prep you from the beginning.”
“This is not a normal mirror. It’s the Mirror of Erised.” Harry explained.
“Um, okay.”
Harry goes in, bang after bang, euphoric moans coming from Draco after every hit. Harry stares at Draco, watching his mouth open, his head tilt back. He looks like he did in the mirror, seconds away from orgasm.
They both pulled it down and what it revealed was simply…them. The mirror simple mirrored what was real. It was as if, that mirror, was not magical.
A soft, transparent, silk sheet covered the mirror in the corner. Which was still going unnoticed by both boys.
“N-nothing, just keep going please.”
“Oh. So it was really your first time?” Draco asks.
“Come on, let’s go on out,” Harry laughs as he stands up.
“Shut up.”
When he pulls out of Harry’s mouth his dick twitches incredibly as a stream of cum flows down.
Harry sits by his friends and they stare at him as he eats.
“So, um…should we leave?” Harry asked awkwardly.
“Ron and I never did that.”
Harry breathed in slow and exhaled even slower. He pressed the heel of his hand against his erection and willed it to go down. He couldn’t, so he cast a muffling charm just as he heard a mangled scream that sounded like a climax.
“I-it…it’s too big,” Draco said, meekly.
Harry looks back up to Draco and sees his face completely red.
Harry angles himself right in front of Draco’s ass and slowly slides in, the condom making it easier.
His face grows boiling hot, and he slowly looks up to Harry, who’s smirking of course.
“I guess we learn something about ourselves everyday,” Draco smirks.
They make out while slowly making their way to the bed. Draco pushes him on the bed and rips off Harry’s shirt and Harry flips them over.
“Mm~ excited?”
“I’m gonna take it off.”
“How does that thing fit in your trousers? Let alone your pants.”
“So you saw me and you getting hot and heavy? Liked it that much you had to pull one off?”
“I’m telling my best friends what happened last night, it was my first time.”
Harry goes over and grabs the cloth. He could now see Draco from the side, and his face was as red as a tomato.
“They’re gonna know I was bottom…” he says as his face turns red again.
This was a sight, Harry and Draco each in their own house robes, one getting yanked by the ear and one yanking.
“Stop! Please. I-I am jealous, okay? And I cannot stand to hear you and Weasley having sex.”
“I’m guessing we found your prostate~” Harry sings, lightly.
“Ah! Fuck, Harry! Oh, God! S-stop sucking,” Draco says frantically. The sensations were too much at one time.
“Smart one, are you?” Harry comments distracted, not noticing the way Draco’s ears go red.
Harry undoes Draco’s tie and pushes off his black blazer.
“I guess we learn something new everyday, Ronald must be very lucky,” He says his name with malice and distaste, as if he was…jealous.
“It’s your fault!”
“Don’t you think I should take them off myself?”
“U-um nothing important…why?” He said nervously.
“Pushy,” Harry says.
“Ugh!” Harry shouted as they unknowingly make their way into the room of requirement still kicking and pushing.
“It um, shows your deepest desire. Even if it’s hidden to your own heart. I-I saw my parents. First year. But I don’t think it’ll be the same, I kind of got closure in the forbidden forest the night I died,” Harry hadn’t meant to overshare, but Draco was listening intently.
“I think this sheet is blocking it from working,” Harry, once again, explains.
Harry’s face twisted into confusion, then extreme happiness, then to a smirk.
“I’m really tired,” Draco says.
Harry sits up and Draco gasps. He hasn’t even seen the damn thing and he already knows it won’t be able to…well fit.
“You shut it rather loud,” Draco says walking closer.
“Um, excuse us for a second,” Draco smiles awkwardly before yanking Harry by his ear.
Harry swallows slowly.
One spurt after the next, all over his chest and Harry’s abdomen.
“Stop, okay. Just stop saying her name.”
Harry smiles, “Okay, Draco, whatever you say~”
He looks around and takes notice he’s in the ROR. But, somethings different, he feels something heavy is breathing on him.
“Oh, do shut up Malfoy!”
“What?”
“…U-um, Ginny!” Harry scrambled, immediately regretting saying that.
“No…”
“What?”
“Okay, okay,” Harry hums.
“Protego!”
“Oh.” Draco’s heart shattered at that, and he really didn’t know why, “Who is it?”
He smiles serenely, he was so lucky. But once the event of last night replayed in his head, something else other than him, rose.
“What? I would’ve guessed you were an expert.”
“H-Harry, I can’t stop cumming,”  Draco says as he thrusts his hips upwards.
“N-no! Malfoys don’t get jealous.”
Harry noticed his hand moving frantically. Then noticed his dick in his hand with the other on the wall. He was masturbating. He was wanking. Pulling one off. In front of Harry.
Harry quickly looked away but couldn’t help but notice Malfoy starting at the mirror.
“Um, yes,” Draco looks away embarrassed, “but you can’t tell your friends!”
“Okay! So what? I came when you were sucking my neck. Stop staring,” Draco says, using one had to cover and the other tightly gripping the blanket.
Suddenly, Harry stops.
“Mm, you’re so sensitive. Was this embarrassing for you? Is that why you were stalling?” Harry says, slyly.
He sits back up and puts Draco’s pale legs around his waist.
“No.”
“Hng~” Draco moans as he throws his head back, fisting the blanket.
“Me too,” Draco says before he jumps forward and kisses him.
“Ah~ ha~” Draco moans.
Before they started anything, Harry stops, “Are you sure you want this Draco?”
“That’s not my problem,” Harry says as he pushes the doors open.
Harry’s abdomen seized and he shot out pump after pump of cum into the condom.
“But…you’re gay.”
“This is about a potion? Get over it Malfoy, it was hours ago!” Harry says as he grabs Malfoy’s face in one hand pushing it away, while Malfoy pushes Potter’s chest back.
“You didn’t even see it yet.”
“I could’ve sworn you and Hermione hit it up sometimes. To you know….release stress.”
He opened it, before looking in he looked back at Draco, who was still looking in the mirror.
“Mm, and why is that?”
“Must you be so- Ah! Fuck! Oh God, what was that?!” Drips of precum leak from Draco’s cock.
Harry tenses once he notices the warmth and the soft vibe of the room. He looked at Malfoy suspiciously, and found himself wanting to touch the hair on his head because of how soft it looked, but then he shakes his head and realizes how ridiculous that is.
“No ones here.”
“With a…guy?”
“You…didn’t see him?”
“If you’re gonna tel them tell them I topped.”
Harry reached up, while sucking, and flicks Draco’s nipples.
“Why’d you stop?” Draco says with heavy breathing.
“But it tastes so good~”
Draco moans just by staring at it.
“What’s in the drawer?” Draco asks, looking back at Harry.
“I didn’t see you pulling one off in front of your enemy,” Draco snaps, resting his knees on the floor and taking his head out of his hands and facing the wall.
By this time Harry has three fingers in.
Harry head, hair in between his long pale fingers.
“Yeah, was it yours?”
“You.”
“I’m not jealous! I just have the decency to stop talking in the right moments. This is clearly one of those,” Draco heaves. “And cover that mirror.”
Harry’s heart tightens a little, “Oh, um, I didn’t know you got jealous that easily,” Harry says awkwardly.
Harry walked closer and heard sniffles. He staggered in his steps, but continued walking once he saw the white substance against the burgundy walls.
“What?! I couldn’t ever do that with her.”
“Harry…”
“Uh, well yeah.”
“What? Saying that you like my dick? That you moan for more? That you are so sensitive the littlest touch of your nipples can get you leaking so much precum? That you even pulled yourself off in front of me-“ Draco put both his bass over the other on Harry’s mouth and looked away.
“I have no idea.”
“What ever your heart desires Draco~” Harry says, smirking.
Harry walks closer to Draco, “Tell me about it, hm?”
Him seeing Draco in the mirror and Draco not seeing him, that was embarrassing enough. Him thinking of this, and him conjuring it in the drawer was a whole different story.
“You’re such a devil in bed,” Draco whines from pleasure.
Harry was trying his absolute best not to cum right on the spot like that.
“Why are you so intrigued? It’s just a nice mirror Potter. Didn’t know you were that self-centered-” Draco was cut off.
“The hell does erised mean…oh it’s desire. But spelled backwards.”
“Was the dream good?” Harry remarks.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was supposed to hear that but, it was hot none the less. “Um, well I guess you really like Parkinson. I’m rooting for you,” Harry says that last part bitterly.
Harry stared hopelessly at the mirror and even had his eyes welled up at a point. He just now realized his feelings, and now that he did, he understood what all those obsessions were about. He couldn’t deny it, Draco was beautiful. His hair was probably as soft as it looked, if not softer.
“Well I wouldn’t have to if you learned how to brew a potion right!” Draco snapped.
Once it does stop, after about a minute of him orgasming, Harry slowly pulls out. He takes off the condom and ties a knot so the cum doesn’t leak out.
“Oh, nothing.”
“Shhh! What if someone hears you?”
Draco’s head flew back as his mouth opens, he lets out a series of cuss words as he cums. And it doesn’t seem to stop.
“Easy for you to say! You’re arse at potions, some of us actually have to keep up our excellence!” Draco yelled.
This time Draco kept his mouth shut, face slightly flushing from the command.
Harry looked mortified.
Draco goes to the end of the bed getting ready to stand before he looks down. His erection straining in his black pants.
He grabbed his robes and headed down the hall, veering sharply as he reached the lift and suddenly walking down to potions. Inside, Draco was leaned back over that same cauldron, the smoke painting his face is shadows that emphasized the delicately crafted lines of his narrow jaw and nose, sharp cheekbones. Harry’s own face was more square, thick brows that were just as unruly as his hair, and his five o’clock shadow often showing up by noon. He was stunned all over that someone who looked like statuesque marble come to life would be interested in him. He felt a sudden urge to push Draco back against a wall and kiss him until the warmth and heat of his body squirming against Harry proved the depth of that interest.
“About tonight. I know it can be difficult, all the reporters and stuff who circle me, and since you’re not out.” He shrugged. “I just don’t want you to be uncomfortable.”
“Draco.”
Scrubbing his eyes, he practically walked over someone else as he reached the lift to head to the atrium and floo home. Someone tall with white-blonde hair and who smelled like sweat and cedar and rain, but the clean kind of rain that left everything refreshed rather than the dirty sludge still falling outside. He barely registered Draco Malfoy was who he’d just barreled over in enough time to stop himself from burying his face in all that pale hair and breathing in that scent.
It was a beautifully delicate scarf in teal green with silver woven throughout. As he looked closely, though, he realized the silver was in the shape of a constellation. His constellation.
Harry kissed him again, the press of lips growing heated for a moment. “Okay. I have to go, or I’ll be late, and you’re worth it, but then I’d be kept late.” His words were murmured against Draco’s lips, more small kisses between each muttered statement.
“It’s not a house, though.”
Harry coughed, brows dropping low over his eyes, and he shook his head and straightened his robes. “No, I shouldn’t have.”
Draco cleared his throat, straightening his pale green tie so it fell perfectly down the middle of his black button-up. “Yes, well, as I said last time. I have a special project going that needing checking on.” He nodded to Ron. “Weasley. How are you and yours?”
After dinner, however, another owl pecked on the window.
Harry started. He’d heard of The Prank but only vaguely. “How did he fix it? How did he undo the damage he’d caused?”
Draco’s tears had soaked the shoulder of Harry’s shirt by the time he finished, and he sagged heavily against him as Harry rubbed his back and murmured nonsense against his temple.
“It took you long enough. You’ve been mooning over him for weeks.”
“You’ll eat your words. This Saturday. Seekers game. Just us. If I win, you have to come to our next pickup game.” Harry poked Draco in the side. “And I know you’re just teasing me to avoid admitting you’re afraid to come.” He grinned, tossing his dark hair back out of his eyes. “It’s fine. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t. I’m not blind to the people around me and their feelings, and if I thought it would be an uncomfortable time for you, I wouldn’t mention it.”
“Draco also betrayed the Dark Lord, when he lied to protect Harry. And he did so in front of Bellatrix and Narcissa, two accomplished legilimens.”
Harry grinned and toasted him with a piece of naan before digging into his takeout container. “I figured you were hungry, if this was when your lunch would be. And I haven’t eaten other than some form of meat on a stick while running down Diagon Alley. Thought we’d eat together.”
Harry groaned into the kiss, feeling his t-shirt shift higher as Draco’s questing hands moved up toward his shoulders. The days apart suddenly felt too long, and he nipped Draco’s lips. “The box is private, right?” Draco nodded, mouth moving down Harry’s jaw to his throat. “And we don’t want to get stuck in the first rush for the apparition points.”
Both men laughed, Harry nodding. “I know. He enjoys watching me struggle with things like that. Oh wow!” Harry finished opening his gift, revealing a broom cleaning kit specifically for the Nimbus 6000 and autographed by the seeker of the Arrows. “I didn’t know they were making a kit just for the new broom.”
Draco smiled and took the flowers, motioning for Harry to come inside as he found a vase to put them in before the two side-alonged to dinner.
Once back at Grimmauld place, Kreatcher already had shepherd’s pie in the oven, so Harry set the table and got everyone drinks while Draco helped Teddy out of his winter coat, gloves, and scarf. Remembering his thought from the night before, Harry poured himself and Draco glasses of wine rather than getting his usual beer.
“Because I’m not seven!”
His words ended as Hermione stepped forward and hugged him tightly, sniffling into his shoulder. “Not the point, Draco. Not the point.”
The fourth snitch darted past his head as soon as he entered the house. Pausing long enough to check that Grinch had food and water, Harry then gave chase, following the flittering wings up the stairs, around his bedroom, then into his bathroom. He slammed the door to keep it in and came to a halt. The large clawfoot tub was filled with steaming water, scented with sandalwood jasmine. Next to the tub was a tray with cheese, crackers, meat, and fruit and another glass of what he assumed was that fancy wine from a few days before. Harry stripped and was almost in the tub when the snitch smacked him in the face, reminding him he’d been chasing it. His hand flew out as it bounced off his glass, snagging it out of the air and opening it as he climbed into the tub.
“Harry.”
Draco smiled at how uncomfortable Harry looked. Biting his lip, he reached over and took his hand. “Well, if we’ve been dating a couple months, then, would you like to go an actual date this weekend?”
Harry smiled as they continued to lay together for a bit, neither too worried about going to eat just yet. He already had plans for next Christmas. And that little snitch ring box.
“So did his.”
“Fuck you.” Draco spoke around a mouthful of rice and masala. “I can find anything I need. Who cares if others can’t?” He swallowed and pointed at the door. “That was wordless.”
Remus snapped, his face lighting up. “And remove the section with her portrait attached to it!”
He was sitting quietly, mulling over what the ticket and note and gifts all meant when the man in question stuck his head in the door.
Molly didn’t even flinch. “Sweetheart, we didn’t mind one bit that Percy brought a him home or Ginny a her, and it doesn’t bother us that Charlie has not interest in bringing anyone but dragons. Besides, I know more than you think. If you like this young man, I trust your judgement. Why not bring him over that first weekend of January, start the year off right?”
The bird didn’t answer. Just hooted and flew off, probably for the next gift.
"Doesn't matter."
Harry laughed, sliding his hand under Draco’s so that he was the one touching where the Mark had been, effectively stopping the movement of the sleeve. “I plan on it. I had to make sure the case would survive so I know whether to verbally or physically flay them alive.”
She moved forward, squeezed Draco’s arm, and honestly smiled at him for the first time. “Yeah, he was a dick about the whole thing. Harry doesn’t know how to hide his feelings, though. How to fake them. Harry’s always been one to rush headfirst into everything without thinking, but he can’t fake what he feels.” She shrugged and let go of Draco, kicking the dirt. “I was worried about you, what you felt, because I could see how hard he was falling for you. I didn’t want you to hurt him.”
"What side do you sleep on?"
Without thinking, Harry lunged forward, tackling Draco to the ground and pinning the other man beneath him. The fell with a soft thump, Harry putting his hands out to catch his weight and keep from hurting the leaner man. He ended up with his arms bracketing the blond’s head, their faces close enough that Draco’s breath fogged Harry’s glasses. The same static that had filled Harry’s head when Draco touched his face came back, and he found himself forgetting that he was helping Teddy. Instead, he noticed how Draco’s eyes were a soft blue grey in the fading sunlight, how snowflakes clung to his lashes, the blond so pale that they were almost invisible, the way his lips parted as he panted from the exertion of their game.
“It’s fine. I was just. Well, I guess I was more like help than family. I think that’s why I got so close to Dobby so quickly. I understood what it was like to feel trapped. Oh, shit, I’m sorry.”
Harry sighed and scrubbed his face, that just more proof of how closed off he’d been. Deciding to change that, he settled back and dug into his breakfast, making plans. He finally got up almost an hour later, showered, and jogged downstairs to meet Kreatcher in the kitchen. “Hey, um, do you know who sent over breakfast? Or asked you to make it?”
Draco sniffed and went back into Harry’s arms, leaning against him until the room turned chilly as the fire started to die down.
“Well, until my shift is done would be the obvious answer.” Harry rolled his eyes, and Draco fidgeted, plucking at the cuffs of his shirt. “I’ve got at least another hour before I even go to lunch. Maybe more.”
“Oh, come off it. You can’t know that, not for real. Can you?”
Draco cleared his throat, tugging at his collar, eyes darting around the table of people now staring at him. “I, well, that is.” He sighed. “Oh, what the hell. Of course, you have my support. And it only set a standard because no one wanted to be known as less kind than the Malfoys.”
“We decorate the gingerbread house the way we did the real house.”
“It blew up. I don’t want to talk about it. I was about to start the next batch.”
“You’re here to what?” The man pushed past Harry and headed for the front room, as he’d said, tree bobbing along behind him. Harry was the distracted by the four other people standing outside his house and pointing wands at it. “What the hell are you doing?”
Draco’s breath came in quick pants, face pink. “I’ll be fine, Harry. But yes, if for some reason, I’m suddenly not fine, I’ll let you know.”
Harry nodded. “You’re not, though.”
“I don’t care why it set a standard, it did.” Hermione nodded and added a third helping of chicken to her plate.
Harry smiled softly, tears leaking down his face. “We’re not at the end, yet, are we?”
