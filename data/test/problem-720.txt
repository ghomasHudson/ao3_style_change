Sirius knew from looking it up as a child, a lot needed to happen before guardians were deemed unfit. While he hated living at home, his parents never did anything that would have enabled the Ministry to call them unfit.
“Maybe you don’t know, but me and Draco Malfoy hate each other. He can’t go one minute without insulting me,” said Harry. “I thought that maybe you didn’t get along because I never saw him at the dinners we had with your parents”
Suddenly Severus Snape spoke up "I might know of someone, however, I will need to confer with her first. There will of course be conditions before she will agree to come here."
Not even fifteen minutes later found Harry seated in front of the desk in Snape his office. On the other side, Serena and Severus were seated.
“Harry this is currently one of the most important sections,” says Severus drawing Harry’s attention away from the properties, “this lists all your investments. It will be important that we look into this and where necessary sell the shares. Depending on the percentage of shares you have, you can also have a say in what the company does.”
Quickly taking the seat next to Ethan Harry noticed that he was the last one to arrive.
If anything that was mentioned in this chapter (what happened to Harry at the Dursleys) seems familiar to you, or any of this, even if just a little bit, is happening to you, do not fear to seek out help. Every country has special chat boxes or phone numbers for these issues, or you can just tell someone you trust, whatever you feel comfortable with. What I am describing is not normal behavior from adult to child and should never happen. And seeking help does not mean you will be taken away from your home, but they will be able to make the behavior stop.
“It only happened when they were really angry. They mostly locked me up inside my cupboard without food. They tried not touching me, my freakiness my be contagious.”
When Harry calmed down once more Severus asked “It is still quite late, do you think you can fall asleep again? Do you maybe want a dreamless sleeping draught?” said Severus trying to keep Harry calm.
I am not so sure what to do with Sirius and Remus. Anyone any ideas? Like how big of a role do you want them to play?
After the meeting, Harry made his way to his room to start making his homework. Normally he would be doing this at Hogwarts in the crowded Gryffindor common room. Some years he had been lucky that most of the students had left for the holidays, so he could concentrate. Other years he wasn’t as lucky. While he did love Gryffindor and the connection it provided him with his parents, he often wondered if it was the right choice. Was the sorting hat may be correct that placing him in Slytherin would have been good for him? Looking at everything now, he would have probably known about his inheritance earlier being surrounded by pureblooded roommates that are heirs themselves.
“I am calling them what they are, Potter. Maybe you should look it up if you don’t understand.” Malfoy sighed. Did Potter really not know that they had officially been declared blood traitors by the ministry after they were convicted a few generations ago? I mean everyone in the wizarding world knows what it means when someone is declared a blood traitor. He did have to acknowledge that the oldest Weasley siblings had distanced themselves from the disgrace that was brought on their families before. There were even rumors that the oldest Weasley was being courted by a veela. Maybe they are on the road to redemption.
“It does not matter what her position in your life was. It was not like she was in any danger, so you should make a scene. And if you went to talk to her you should have taken Miss Patil with you, so she felt included.”
“Now for the next part. As we discovered before there have been some payments that for some reason mister Potter is not aware of. We did some research and have figured out where the money is going. There is a total of 1.000 pounds placed in the account of the Dursleys each month. There is also a yearly withdrawal of 10.000 galleons by one Minster Dumbledore. Of these 1.500 galleons are deposited each in the vaults of Ginerva Weasley and Ronald Weasley. 4.000 galleons are deposited in the account of Molly Weasley and 3.000 galleons are going to the personal account of Albus Dumbledore. There has also been an irregular number of around 500 galleons withdrawn at the beginning of each school year.” states Ripclaw. After he finished the whole room erupted.
“AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH” a scream went trough the house later that night.
“It seems you can be on time. Please come in.”
“I don’t want to be a burden,” mumbled Harry under his breath.
Severus had also been helping him with his nightmares. After the first time, he had been having them almost every night. While taking dreamless sleep potions helped, they were sadly enough addicting. The solution was a combination of occlumency and dreamless sleep potions. Meditating and clearing his mind before going to bed, really helped in keeping the nightmares away. Severus had also spelled Harry’s room to notify him if Harry had one of his nightmares. Being woken up almost immediately and having someone there allowed Harry to fall back asleep.
“Luckily Draco does not have to worry about that.” causing Harry to turn to Ethan who had spoken. Turning his head Harry looked at Draco, waiting for an explanation.
“It is nice to meet you.” said Ethan, holding out his hand.
Today was the day. After spending Christmas Eve with the Snapes and Malfoys this evening would be the Christmas ball at the Greengrasses. As Christmas Eve and even the daytime of Christmas day was reserved for family, the ball is done on the eve of Christmas day. If Harry was completely honest he had to admit that he was quite nervous for tonight. While yesterday evening went quite well with the Malfoys, that did not mean tonight would good as well. He got the feeling that due to the connection the Malfoy family has with the Snapes, they kind off had to treat him well.
Getting upset the longer he read the letter, Harry stood up and threw it in the fireplace. Seeing it burn gave him some satisfaction. Deciding why not, he went back and picked up the letters from Ron, Mrs Weasley and Ginny and also threw them in.
"The pleasure is all mine. May I offer you any tea or lemon drops? They are delicious."
Nothing has changed :) I just changed the date.
“He had this game called “Harry Hunting”. He and his friends would chase me around the neighborhood and beat me up when they caught me”
The summer had finally come to an end. A perfect meeting had dragged his friends away, so currently Harry Potter was sitting alone in a compartment. Completely lost in thought he was thinking about this summer. It was one of the worst summers yet. When arriving at the Dursleys, Vernon had immediately put all his things away in his cupboard. He was also constantly plagued by nightmares. Waking up screaming at night after seeing Cedric get killed or Voldemort rising out of the cauldron. But those were not the worst. This worst were the ones about his parents and/or Cedric blaming him for their deaths. So as you can see it was not such a good summer. He was lucky enough to stay at the Weasleys for the final 2 weeks, which allowed him to finish his homework. Mrs. Weasley had already bought all he needed, saying going to Diagon Alley was not safe.
“After you put the memories in they will disappear and be automatically classified in your file. No one but you and your guardian will have access to them. Three judges will view your memories, today’s questioning, and your file this afternoon. As you are a minor this will be anonymous, which means that any recognizable characteristics will be redacted. As such they will have no idea who’s file they are judging. The latest tomorrow morning you will receive an owl with the final judgment,” Mdm. Hawks explained.
“Miss Lovegood, do you maybe know why Ryan has no friends? I mean you are in the same house?” asked Snape and he really looked desperate to know the answer of what was wrong with his son.
“Oh, ok.” Harry replied feeling overwhelmed. Today had been so overwhelming. He went from having a quite normal argument with Malfoy to discovering that everything he knew was a lie. Well no, it wasn’t a lie, he was just never informed of anything. This was what he hated most, feeling left in the dark. It made him feel like he was back in his cupboard, not knowing anything, feeling completely powerless.
“You mean dark magic?” asked one of the Ravenclaws.
“We are quite good,” beamed both Severus and Serena after receiving a few hugs.
“Are you telling me that you asked her to be your date and then ignored her!?” exclaimed Serena.
“Severus, is there a reason why this contract has turned light blue and not gone dark?” asked Harry looking up from his pile of papers.
“I have no clue, Ryan, after getting tickets for the Quidditch World Cup last year and season tickets for your favorite team I have no idea how he is going to top that.” Said Ethan.
“Is it really that bad?” Harry said sounding really sad.
“We are great uncle Luc,” before both gave him a happy hug. Having not seen their so-called uncle since the beginning of the school year, both could not stop talking. Mr. Malfoy was listening attentively while both boys told him about everything that had happened.
“Fine.” said Malfoy, for one moment there Harry thought he saw hurt in the eyes of the Malfoy heir.
“What happens if you did something they didn’t like, or if you didn’t finish your chores?”
Then she called out: “Snape, Ethan”
“Still hanging out with the blood traitor are you Potter?” said Malfoy.
“Well, the Prince name comes from my mother's side of the family. During my Hogwarts years and my potions mastery, I was known as Severus Snape and as such most of my potion mastery achievements are documented under that name. Since my grandfather did not have any other heirs when he died, and my father did not have a lordship, the Prince lordship was given to me. While I was allowed to change the name when I took the lordship, I never felt the need to. Since I don’t carry the name Ethan and Ryan also don’t carry it. When Ethan takes over as Lord Prince he will have the choice to either keep the name Snape or to change it to Prince.” Severus explained.
“Don’t tell me that the Malfoys are coming over for Christmas? Please don’t tell me Draco Malfoy will be here,” said Harry, already fearing the answer.
“Now there are a few rules you will have to follow. If you do not I will throw you out. Some of the animals we will study could be very dangerous if you take the wrong approach. You will be expected to have read the chapter in your book about the magical creature we will be studying before coming to the practical class. When doing this spend extra attention on the part pertaining what not to do around the magical creature. At the beginning of a practical class I will first make you aware of what you are going to do and how to do it. For the people who want to take this course next year you will have to get at least an E for your O.W.L’s, but I would advice only people with an O to take the N.E.W.T’s class. If you want to do something with Magical Creatures after graduating Hogwarts you will need an O on you N.E.W.T’s.” said Professor Moonlight.
Arriving he saw that only he and Dean had signed up from Gryffindor. Other than them there where 3 Ravenclaws, including Padma Patil, and 4 Hufflepuffs, three of them were Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones and Ernie Macmillan. From Slytherin only Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabine and Theodore Nott showed up.
“Um, sure?” answers Harry.
“Sure, take a seat. What do you want to talk about?”
There is also a section on shares and investments. This will state the number of shares you have in a particular business and how much money you are either earning or losing based on that share. In case you sell or buy new shares, or if there is a big change in your earnings or losses this will be mentioned in the beginning of the bank statements under “changes”,” explained Severus.
Harry knew it was done when professor Snape stopped and started walking again. “Now that you are keyed into the wards, you will be able to go straight to the manor without any problems.” said professor Snape before entering the Manor. The entrance hall was huge; you could clearly see that people with quite some money lived in the house. Harry was not given much time to look around, as he was taken straight upstairs.
“Ok, but what if I have more or less than two sons?” asked Harry trying to understand.
"I did not realize you were still in contact with anyone from school. How do you still know her?" said Minerva.
After having read it over Serena said, “Everything seems in order. Now go send it off and then head straight to dinner.”
Not long after the Malfoys decided to go home as it was already some time past midnight. Overall Harry was surprised the evening went better than expected. The Malfoys were not so bad ones they accepted you and Harry got to know them more. Harry never expected to say this but he was actually relieved that Draco would be at the Greengrass Christmas Ball tomorrow. Harry felt quite confident that Draco had accepted him, and at least would not create any trouble for him tomorrow. Saying Draco had his back, well Harry first had to see that before he believed it.
"You mean the silent girl from Ravenclaw? I thought she moved away after graduating?" asked Filius Flitwick.
“But, why? Do they not want their children to choose their own partner?”
“Uhm, it would depend on if I was able to finish my chores or not.”
“How often were you hit?”
“Lord Prince-Snape are you willing to become the magical guardian of mister Potter till he reaches the age of maturity and to guide him in his future role. If so please sign the following papers.” Ripclaw said handing over the papers to Lord Prince-Snape. After having read through all the files, he decided to sign it and handed them back.
“Definitely by summer, but hopefully sooner. Now go, make sure your room is neat, as the Malfoys will be coming tomorrow for Christmas Eve.
“Yes, I read that here. You staying with Lord Snape-Prince is no issue as he is your magical guardian. Since we did not place you, we were wondering if you had any idea how you ended up at their home?”
Walking into the Ministry for the first time Harry was amazed at what he saw. Wizards and witches were walking around trying to get to where they needed to be. There were owls and paper airplanes flying around. In the middle, he could see this huge statue, which according to Hermione is The Fountain of Magical Brethren. Hermione mentioned in one of her arguments that “other creatures” were seen as less then wizards and witches. Apparently the Ministry sees the statue as unity of the wizarding world. Now seeing it, Harry was leaning more towards the opinion of Hermione.
“Harry, I will probably not have enough time today to teach you everything, so I expect you to improve and work on this in your own time. I understand that you have a lot of work, but your first appearance will be scrutinized since you already offended most people.” Started Serena, going into lecture mode.
“Ok, do you want to talk about it?”
“Now that we are all here we can continue. As I have informed Lord Prince-Snape of what has happened before, there is no need to repeat it. He has also reacted positively to potentially becoming your magical guardian mister Potter” stated Ripclaw when everyone was seated.
“I will explain that at a later time if you want to know now, it is mentioned in one of the books you need to read. Since tomorrow will be a busy day, you have this afternoon free,” said Severus before leaving breakfast.
The next day Harry woke up refreshed. He must have been very tired since for once he didn’t have any nightmares, not that he was complaining. Making is way down to the dining room he greeted everyone before starting his breakfast.
“They would encourage it.”
Seeing that Harry really did not know, Draco decided to inform him, “Harry, I am gay. Which means most likely my mate will not be female.
Letting Harry and Neville say goodbye to each other, Mdm. Longbottom turned towards Severus “Harry was staying at our place normally during the holidays, but it will be better for him to spend the rest of the holidays with you. This will allow him to get used to your dynamics. If for some reason you need to be away for a moment Harry is always welcome to stay at our place. I will be sending his trunk over with a house-elf the moment I arrive home. Do you already have an idea about what you are going to do about his guardians?” Shaking his head he replied, “That would be fine. Concerning his guardians that will be up to the Ministry and I will also first need to discuss everything with my family”
“Guys, did I just see that right? Did Snape smile?” asked Harry uncertainly.
Harry was about to reply when Professor Dumbledore stood up.
"Wait does that also mean he has two sons?"
Please take the time to review, even if it is just a word.
And then it happened the most extraordinary thing that was going to happen in my life. I will probably never see this again. And nobody would believe it if I ever told anyone. Snape turned himself towards Ryan, who was sitting next to him and actually looked concerned.
“You have to understand that the seats in the Wizengamot correspond with all the different houses of wizarding Britain. If houses are absorbed in each other or just die out that means that there are fewer seats in total. This means that there are fewer votes. If houses are merged that means that one person holds more votes than the rest. People will try to do everything to keep their lordship alive.”
The first file was a contract between the House of Potter and the House of Longbottom. Looking at the contact itself there was little to worry about. It mainly talked about supporting each other in the Wizengamot, to protect each other’s House members when necessary, and to never have an unfriendly attack towards the other. Furthermore, the contract promotes that the children of each House are raised together to further the alliance. Reading the details, it became clear to Harry that these alliances were both a protection measure and a friendship.
“You mentioned that you have chores, what would they generally be in a day?”
“If you think that is best?” Harry said, still not completely comfortable. “If you would follow the goblin here, he will bring you to our testing room. The test itself will take around 10 minutes. Once it is finished you will be escorted back here.” Ripclaw explained pointing at the goblin who had just entered the room. Looking back at Neville Harry only saw encouragement and decided to go along with everything for now.
It was on the third day at breakfast that Neville finally received a reply. Shooting a quick glance to Harry, who was squeezed between Ron and Hermione, he told him with his eyes to meet him in the dorm room later that day.
“There you two are, we were getting worried you two would have started arguing again,” joked Severus.
Calming down a bit, Harry replied, “are you sure? It looks ironclad to me.”
“Ok see you then next week, could you maybe extent the invitation towards miss. Lovegood?” said Professor Moonlight.
Harry was happy that Severus had refrained from stating his name. The lady behind the desk was already scrutinizing him enough without her knowing he is Harry Potter.
“Hey, Harry.” said someone behind him.
Harry hesitantly replied, “Ok, there will be a big chance they will soon find out that I am no longer living at the Dursleys. I still don’t want to wait for them to make it an unbreakable contract or to trick me into one.”
Today was the second day of the holidays and Neville’s grandmother decided that today they would be going to Gringotts. Just as Neville had said, professor McGonagall had not denied his late minute request to leave for the holidays. What did seem weird to Harry was that professor Dumbledore had called him to his office asking about where he would be spending his holidays. He even tried to convince Harry that he was not safe outside the walls of Hogwarts. While he had not been able to stop Harry from going, it made Harry wonder about what was going on.
“Oh, and you are certain about this?” asked Harry still not fully believing it would be this easy. “Can we break the marriage contract right now?”
“I see you still hang around blood traitors” spat Malfoy. He was pissed off with Potter prancing around like he owned the place. He might have a high status in the wizarding world but did not even bother doing the necessary work. It was a complete insult that he ignored all the traditions. Even worse he hangs around blood traitors and even had the audacity to defend their actions. His wardrobe also needs an update. It was highly offending that Potter did not were the correct robes and even the material used was substandard. But he probably did this so his friends did not feel left out.
“Uh, thank you for inviting me” said Harry awkwardly.
“So how has your day been so far? No trouble?” asked Snape.
“Who do you think is that woman sitting next to Professor Snape? Have any of you seen Hagrid?” Hermoine asked after looking at the staff table.
Spending time at Neville’s grandmother was very nice. While there were some rules in the house, in general, she left both him and Neville to their own devices. She did question him throughout when he arrived to figure out how much he knew about his lordships. When she figured out it was zero to none, she was so angry she had to leave the room to calm down. Even Neville was surprised, saying he had rarely seen his grandmother that angry.
“So he does not makeup really stupid rules, is very strict and insults you when you do something wrong?” said Harry unbelieving that Snape could act like a normal person.
Leading Harry to the right side of the library he pointed at a few shelves “These are the books that can be interesting and can help you with your heir studies. The books in this section cover politics, contracts, laws, history, and traditions. To give you an idea of where to start I have here a list of books that you are expected to have read by the end of the holidays. They are in order of what you are supposed to be reading first.” Explained Severus handing Harry a parchment with a list of books. Looking down at the parchment Harry had trouble keeping his expression from going to desperate. The list was filled with books covering all kinds of subjects. Doing a quick count Harry saw that there was a total of 28 books he had to read.
Seeing as it was almost 8 o’clock, Harry decided to go to breakfast and start the day. Walking downstairs still in his nightclothes, Harry made his way towards the dining room. While normally you would expect the high up purebloods to always be impeccably dressed, the nightclothes Harry wore were better than any clothes he had ever owned, even his Hogwarts cloaks. Serena had ordered him an entire new wardrobe that included new nightclothes as well. By the feel and look of them Harry knew they must have cost a fortune and he would not be surprised if they were made out of silk.
“Wands please,” stated the Ministry official, before they were allowed to enter.
“Before looking into this further I want Dumbledore removed as his magical guardian and a new one appointed. I am almost certain that Lily and James Potter didn’t appoint Dumbledore as his guardian. But besides that, Dumbledore has shown himself unfit to be mister Potter's magical guardian since he is unaware of his status and he has been denied the appropriate education.” stated Mdm. Longbottom taking charge in this mess. So many things were coming out that Harry had no idea anymore about what was going on. Looking at Neville it was clear that even he had no idea anymore what was happening.
“Well, my boy. Due to his mother’s sacrifice, I gave him to the only family he had left.”
“Make sure you do. But you will need to apologize to miss Patil.”
Seeing the completely devastated look on both of his sons’ faces, Severus added: “I am not saying he will have no free time, but it will be very scarce.” Looking at Harry who probably wanted to go into a million different questions he said. “We will be going over what you will be doing in detail tomorrow.” His tone saying the conversation was over.
“Harry we don’t know what they have been doing with your key or if there are other things going on such as marriage contracts. Hiding someone’s inheritance is one of the biggest crimes, besides line theft and blocking a mate bond.” Neville stated reassuringly. They would get to the bottom of this.
“Yes, females cannot inherit a lordship. They can hold the proxy seat until either the male heir is old enough or until a male heir is born. How much access the females get to the inheritance is based on the arrangements made by each individual house. For example Mdm. Longbottom holds the Longbottom proxy until her grandson is old enough. Mdm. Bones also holds the proxy seat till her niece Susan has a male son. But it is never sure because the lordship of her husband if he has one, will take preference. And the Bones lordship can only be transferred if the husband agrees that one of his children or his only child will receive the lordship.”
“Dad” Ethan said running towards Snape.
“Lord and Lady Malfoy,” replied Harry, shaking Lord Malfoy’s hand and kissing Lady Malfoy’s as Serena had taught him.
I want to say: I don't own any of the characters except the one that I made up.
After everyone took their seats and the refreshments were brought in, Lucius turned to Harry, “So, how are you adjusting to your new life, Harry?”
“Like you don’t know” Malfoy stated before walking away, leaving a very confused Harry behind. Did Potter really think his innocent act would work? Everyone had gotten a personal invite by the Ministry so it was impossible that he did not know anything.
“It is not that I do not believe you Mr. Potter it is just that if we have your memories we are not obliged to further investigate what happened. If you are not willing to provide them we will also need to talk to your current guardians before we make a final decision on your living situation. Both options are the same to me, so it is really up to you what you are comfortable with.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now, I will not be going into detail on what I will all be teaching you as you will find that out soon enough.” Looking at Serena, Severus continued, “Serena will be going over all the social events during the holidays with you.”
Seeing the defeated look on Ethan’s face, he continued, “But your mother and I will be sending you off for a visit on Christmas day. We will of course need to find an excuse to tell Harry, but that is how it needs to be for now. We can’t risk Dumbledore finding out.”
“It says here that the main Potter vault deposits a yearly fund of 25.000 galleons in my trust vault. Is that normal?” asked Harry surprised after seeing the enormous amount.
“My problem is that you seem not to care about our world at all. You didn’t even bother to show up this summer. You might be a lord, but you are no better than us. Even Longbottom had the decency to show up.” Malfoy told him off. Really Potter needs it spelled out why every pureblood is offended? And it's not just the Slytherins, all the purebloods from every house were shocked this summer when they noticed Potter did not take the time to show up. At the first meeting we all thought that maybe there was an issue, but after not showing up for the other four meetings everyone realized he was not going to come. It is really insulting that everyone else takes the time to come, but Potter does not even notify the ministry that he would not attend.
“Maybe you should watch it” Harry bit back. Of course, he had to have a run-in with Malfoy. He had managed to avoid Malfoy and his goons till now, or had they avoided him? Not that it mattered. Harry was glad that he could focus on school for once instead of on this pity rivalry.
“Ah mister Potter, I am glad you finally grace us with your presence. You are a hard person to track down. We have been trying to get in contact with you since your 14th birthday.” Exclaimed the goblin entering the room. “My name is Ripclaw and I have been the Potters account manager since your grandfather. What seems to be the problem here?”
When dinner was finished and all plates and leftover food disappeared, Professor Dumbledore stood again.
“Harry Potter,” Draco drawled suddenly in front of Harry, shocking him out of his nervous thoughts. Without realizing it Draco had already greeted Severus, Serena, Ethan, and Ryan. Looking up he noticed both Lord and Lady Malfoy still talking to both Ethan and Ryan.
“Wait, Uncle Lucius? Don’t tell me as in Lucius Malfoy?” stated Harry, just realizing what might have been said.
As soon as they realized that no this was not a joke, chaos erupted.
“We would like to speak with the Potter account manager, have a full investigation in the Potter vault, and an heir test for mister Harry Potter here” Mdm. Longbottom replied clearly.
“Thank you for the offer, but I don’t know”
“No, all of you have until lunch to tell me if you want to take up the course this year seeing as it will be given on Tuesdays.” answered Professor McGonagall, leaving.
Going through the Gringotts file on her desk, “If, as I believe, your current guardians are deemed unfit you will have till May to decide who you would prefer as your new guardian. This Department would prefer someone that was appointed by your parents' will, which is Lord Snape-Prince, Mdm. Tonks, Mdm. Bones or Lord Malfoy. As Lord Prince is already your magical guardian we would probably prefer that option.
“So if you did finish, what would your meal look like?”
“An old piece of bread, a glass of milk, and if I was lucky some leftovers in the fridge.”
“It will be done as soon as possible. Gringotts apologies for any part we might have played in this. We will do a full inquiry into the Potter accounts and punish anyone found guilty.” Said Ripclaw, with a bloodthirsty grin. “We will now continue with your heir test. This should have been done a year ago, but better late than never”.
The next morning at breakfast Harry was happy to note that a letter had arrived for him.
This shocked the entire hall and Harry saw Ryan take a quick glance in the direction of Professor Snape, like he was scared about what his father would think. Then to his big surprise, Snape smiled in the direction of his son and even looked proud.
They both took a seat in two great chairs standing next to a small reading desk to start their lesson. “So, before I begin do you have any questions? Something you don’t understand?” asked Severus, giving Harry the opportunity to out any of his nagging questions.
“Wha… But, I mean why would you want to do that?” whispered Harry disbelievingly.
Standing up Severus moved across the room before standing right in front of Harry.
Snape’s face changed first to anger then sadness and eventually something that could be described as love.
After their wands were registered Severus led Harry to one of the elevators. The funny thing is that in the wizarding world the elevators don’t only go up and down but also sideways and diagonally. The elevator ride didn’t take that long as soon “Department of wizarding children” was called out and they exited into a nicely lit hallway.
“Heir classes? What’s that?” Harry exclaimed, feeling more and more left out the loop. Harry did not know what was better Malfoy having lied about everything or him finding out that again he was kept in the dark.
“If that is all, we will be taking our leave,” said Severus.
“Today I will be going over the basic knowledge of what your status is and all the duties you will hold when you become a full Lord. We will also go through any basic questions you have today. Tomorrow Serena has volunteered to give you etiquette lessons so you have at least one more week to get used to it before you are attending the balls. The day after tomorrow we will start going over your account statements. You will also start to receive your account statements from Gringotts. I expect you to read them at breakfast and at certain points in time I will be asking you questions about what is happening. This means Harry that if you do not understand something you immediately ask me so that I can explain it to you.”
After eating lunch Harry was guided to the home library by Severus. Entering he could imagine this room would be a dream for Hermione. The Prince library was as big, if not bigger than the library in Hogwarts, but it seemed like it had a bigger variety of subjects. Harry did see that the books on creatures, potions, and DADA were represented the most but that did not limit the collection the Snapes’ had in other subjects.
After saying goodbye to everyone, Harry also walked back towards his common room. He couldn’t stop thinking about what Snape, now Severus had said. He did understand. The Golden Boy everyone saw him as was not really who he was. He did not like having the pressure on him and people dying around him. Could it truly be that there were others who also wore a mask? Could it be people he knew? Could it be is friend and enemies? These were the questions that kept going around in his head while trying to fall asleep.
“Dad?” said Ethan looking unsure.
The second reason is that to create a child a part of parents' magic is used and provided for the child while it grows. This makes it very hard for most to produce more than three to four children. Most couples have to already stop after two. By spreading out the lordships it provides more chances of one lordship going to one child and as such preventing the merging of lordships.
“NO!” exclaimed Ethan. “I really have no idea why everyone thinks that. I mean when we were younger and had nightmares we even crawled into dad’s bed at night.”
“Gryffindor.”
“I am really glad Draco mentioned me not being at the heir meetings this summer.” This surprised Draco as he had not expected Harry to give him some of the credit.
“Ok, what time will they be coming tonight?” Harry wondered, already thinking about what he would be doing the rest of the day. He would probably spend some time going over the appropriate etiquette before hanging out the rest of the day with Ethan and Ryan.
Looking at the other two files Harry found an alliance with the House of Bones and the House of Abbott. Both alliance contracts seemed similar to the one with the House of Longbottom, with some small changes.
“Harry, you came!” shouted Ethan when he saw Harry coming in. Taking Harry’s hand Ethan dragged him over to where he and his brother were apparently playing a game of Exploding Snap.
‘I am surprised she is nothing like Snape. I wonder what we will see today.’ thought Harry.
For a few moments, neither of them moved.
“Just try to get some sleep,” Severus answered while conjuring a chair next to the bed and taking a seat. He would stay next to Harry until he fell asleep before going back to bed himself.
“Do we have to decide now?” asked one of the fourth years.
Giving a small laugh, Harry replied, “I can admit you were correct, but not all the Weasleys are bad. Some are still my friends. But if you mean the two youngest, then yes. After what they did to me they should be happy I am not sewing them yet,” fumed Harry, the anger he was feeling bleeding through in his last words.
“Well, I think that was everything important for today. I would advise you to read all the details in your bank statements to get a better idea of everything that is yours. If something is unclear feel free to come to ask me about it. You now also know enough information to go through the Black bank statements. As you are still just an heir there is very little you can change about them. Even so, I would advise you to at least look into the parts concerning active contracts and shares and investments.”
“Harry, when you are finished please follow us to my office and we will be explaining what will happen from now on.”
Having gotten the confirmation of Harry, Severus attached both his letter and a copy of the marriage contract to the leg of his owl and sends it off. Seeing the big and completely black owl flying to its destination Harry turned back to his bank statements.
“Ah, you must be Lord Snape-Prince, please come in and take a seat.” Mdm. Hawks said.
“If any of these rules are broken this can result in privileges being taken away. If we see that your studies are not receiving enough of your attention you will be banned from playing Quidditch.”
“Well that was interesting.” said Harry standing up. “I will see you soon Luna, need to go drop my bags off before dinner.”
“Wha…”
“You heard that from your Death Eater father, did you not ferret? He’s probably lying, after all, he is a slimy snake” said Ron angrily, his face still red.
“The fact that you asked her last minute would have probably tipped her off on the fact that you were just asking to get a date. Not only that but you also asked a date for your friend which makes it quite obvious. But you should have told her that you had issues with dancing so you both could have worked on that. By not showing an effort you embarrassed yourself and her. And if that was not bad enough, you ignored her for the rest of that evening not even returning her to her dorm room like any gentleman. And if that wasn’t enough you had to have a fight about another girl,”
"Good evening, Miss. Moonlight." greeted Albus.
Seeing that Harry had no idea how to respond Severus stated, “Harry, you don’t have to make a decision right now. The Ministry first has to declare your guardians unfit and then Selena and I are your temporary guardians until the end of the holidays. You have then till summer to make a decision about what you would like to do. We just wanted to make sure that you knew the offer was there.”
All three of them stood up and went in the direction of their first class of the day, Charms.
Lost in thought he didn’t see where he was going until he bumped into someone.
While there is of course a lot more information Harry needs to know about this, Neville said it could wait. Currently, there is other information that should take precedent. He finally got his explanation concerning what these summer heir meetings were all about. At the age of 14, each person with an inheritance is invited to Gringotts to do the so-called ‘heir test’. This test will determine which houses someone is heir to and if there are any lordship positions available. While as a minor you are not yet qualified to be lord, you will still get the name. Officially they call them lord apparent. Since Neville’s parents are not available he became lord apparent to the most Ancient and Noble house of Longbottom.
“Ryan and I were just wondering if we will be seeing grandfather during the holidays?”
“We will begin today with the more practical skills and leave this afternoon for the rest. As you have already been informed you will be attending the Yule ball next week, which means you don’t have that much time to hone your skills.” She started leading Harry to the now empty dining room.
Besides worrying about Dumbledore and his followers, Harry was also nervous about meeting the Malfoys for the first time tonight. He had, after all, Malfoy to thank for his current situation. While he did not have a pleasant experience with both Draco Malfoy and Mr. Malfoy, he had never met Malfoy’s mother. In his classes, he had learned that she was originally from the house of Black, more specifically a cousin of Sirius. He hoped she would be something similar.
“Dad these are my new friends.” said Ethan dragging Snape over to where Luna and Harry were still seated.
Not answering, Malfoy said: “Did you hear the news yet Potter? The big oaf finally got fired. The ministry did an investigation and it seems like he was never even allowed to teach to begin with.”
“I will most likely have a veela inheritance, as most Malfoy’s across history have had that inheritance,” explained Draco, before turning back to Ethan.
“Who knows, maybe you do end up with Pansy,” teased Harry. He could already imagine the new ‘Mrs. Malfoy’. What Harry did not expect was the whole room to start laughing at him.
“I see, living with uncle Sev has taught you something,” stated Draco with a smirk on his face, before surprising Harry and offering his hand, “Hello, Heir Potter.”
“Yeah, same for me I could even change a match into a needle on my second try.” said Ryan proudly.
“I am telling the truth I have friends.” said Ryan in a tone that sounded like he wanted to convince himself.
“Harry was perfectly safe, Sirius. He was with his family and I never had any doubts about his wellbeing.”
“Yes, all these properties are yours,” replied Severus, while looking over the files.
"You all know her, she went to school here. Don’t you remember Serena Moonlight?"
“Why do you ask?”
“Now that we are all here we can start.” announced Professor Moonlight.
Turning back to Harry, Severus handed him the potion saying, “Harry, you can take one gulp from this and it will help you fall back asleep”
“We understand that Harry, but you might try explaining that to Draco and see what happens. Who knows, maybe you will become the best of friends.”
“It’s Professor Snape and yes he just smiled.” said Hermione amazed.
“And what about the Dursleys? Will I need to go back there?” Harry asked hoping this would give him a way to never go back.
That morning before going to the Ministry Harry was called into Severus’ office. Harry had been nervous that entire morning and was not entirely sure what was going to happen. He knew that they would look into his home situation. He was mostly afraid that his life was going to be the big evening news in every witch and wizard’s home.
After the rules were put up all of us approached the golden unicorns. By the time the class finished only Harry, Susan, Hannah, one boy from Ravenclaw and Greengrass got to touch the small unicorns.
I want to say: I don't own any of the characters except the one that I made up.
“Yes, in most cases the sections are either ordered according to date, newest first. Otherwise, they are ordered value. This means the main vaults or properties first,” replied Severus.
"Yes, she did. She was always so good with plants. She could keep them so calm. A bit like Mr. Longbottom today." said Mdm. Sprout.
“Yeah, I thought Freak was my name until I went to primary school.”
I want to say: I don’t own any of the characters except the one that I made up.
Giving the cookies the same treatment as the cake, Harry opened the last letter. This one had no presents attached and it seemed as though the manor wards had attacked it.
“Now onto the lesson. Golden unicorns are slightly different than there cousins the white unicorn or the winged unicorn, not thought in this class. The white unicorn is the most commonly known unicorn as they can be found in lots of places around the world. As all of you should know the white unicorns are born gold in color. After 2 years they turn silver, which then turns into pure white. They stay like this for the rest of their lives. The golden unicorn is also born gold in color, but their color never changes. This is the reason why poachers, stupid enough to capture unicorns, wait until they are at least 2 years old, you can see the different in species then. While the freely given blood of a white unicorn can only be used in potions, the freely given blood of a golden unicorn, when drunk, can protect the drinker for 32h from all magic with bad intent.”
“Can you describe to me how a typical day would be when you were a child?”
Entering the family room Harry was surprised by what he saw. He was sure that the house-elves had been up all morning to change the décor from last night into a warmer pallet. The Christmas tree was largely the same, but now in addition to the classic Christmas ornaments, the elves had added ornaments that were actually made of candy or chocolate. Another addition to yesterday evening were the tons of presents under the tree wrapped in colors of green, silver, blue and red, and Harry could even spot some gold. Severus probably found red ok nut in combination with gold it almost felt like entering in Gryffindor territory.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The house-elves have set up the table to learn you the perfect table manners and what utensils to use for what dish.”
The day of the interview Albus was trying to figure out how to best get the answers he wanted. He was not used to people keeping him in the dark and definitely did not like it. But he did not have a lot of time to think about it because soon there was a knock on the door.
“Hey Neville, how is everything?” Harry said, starting a conversation.
The rest of the day was spent learning many different skills that he would need to be presentable at the societal parties. Just before dinner, he went in search for Serena, wanting to get the apology letter done and over with.
“I was mainly put in my cupboard without food, but one-time Aunt Petunia hit me with a cooking pan.”
In other words, Harry now understood that he was at a huge disadvantage, by not being aware that these meetings were being held. Even worse Neville told him it was a great offense when you did not attend. This only made sorting everything out as fast as possible more important.
“Miss Greengrass, it is not because people have not seen a certain creature for a long time, they are extinct. There are quite a lot of them, luckily for all of you one of them is a good friend of mine and has agreed to come today,” said Professor Moonlight.
Seeing that Ethan was about to protest, Severus quickly gave him a look daring him to interrupt before continuing, “Harry will be spending most of his time learning about his new status and catching up with the classes he missed during the summer. He will need to learn a lot more than you will need to learn Ethan because Harry did not grow up in this world. That means that things that might seem obvious to you might be completely new for Harry.”
"Severus married? Impossible."
"Yes, she was." answered Severus, seeing were this conversation was going.
Looking up Severus Snape saw them entering. To be honest, when he had received the letter from Gringotts not even an hour ago he was surprised. He was called upon because of an issue with the magical guardian of Harry Potter? Deciding he could not ignore the letter he said goodbye to his wife and children before apparating to Diagon Alley. Once he arrived he received a small update on what had happened. Apparently Mdm. Longbottom had found out that Potter was not disrespectful but ignorant. No one had informed him of his legal duties. During the meeting, it was also discovered that Potter did not possess his Gringotts key, had several enchantments placed on him and that Dumbledore as legal guardian had been taking money. The funny thing is that Dumbledore was not even legally allowed to be his guardian, to begin with. If the will had been read, like it was supposed to, he would have been the one that would have raised Harry Potter.
It continued on to list the year they needed to get married, the number of children they needed to have, the fact that while Ginny was allowed to have lovers on the side Harry was not allowed that luxury, the allowance that needed to be provided for Ginny, even were the Potter fortune was to go after he died, and of course the fact that the contract could never be broken.
“Contracts?”
Realizing that he would not get the answer, Albus continued "Can you bring her here next week Thursday at 6pm? Then I will see if she can have the job." He was hoping that he could get the answer from her.
After watching it burn to crisp, he turned around to the shocked faces of Ryan, Ethan and even Serena and Severus who had both decided to join the present opening.
“So did they tell you who is going to be our new Defence teacher?” asked Harry.
“You have to see it differently. When a female marries, she comes under the house of her husband. There are three reasons why women cannot inherit. The first is that you cannot split up most houses. For example, the Black lordship can only go to one person. While there are some trust vaults for the other members-only one can hold the lordship. In the case that females could also inherit you could get cases of the oldest, being female, and her husband having to deal with 2 lordships. Furthermore, they would also have to have two children to pass it on to. On the other hand, you could have her younger brother and his wife not having any lordships to pass on.
“Well don’t just stand there, come in” signed professor Snape.
Harry was brought out of his thoughts when the floo activated. First stepping out was Draco Malfoy closely followed by his parents.
Knowing Ethan was not a Quidditch fan, Harry had bought him a range of Zonko’s products and some wizarding candy.
“I have heard from the third years, who had the class today, that she the opposite of Snape.” said Hermione.
"Well, she has two sons who will need to be transferred to Hogwarts. One of them will be first year, the other third year."
He was happy that his grandmother would be able to help. She even mentioned that she was proud of him for handling this information so well and getting the appropriate help to deal with this. While his grandmother could be very strict, Neville would not want anyone else.
"So I heard you are married to professor Snape?"
“I never received anything, I haven’t been to Gringotts since my first year.” Harry stated. Maybe he was left in the dark. He really felt stupid that apparently he had no clue about anything. Who would do this to him? He thought that a Hogwarts education prepared you for the real world. He sadly had to realize today that he knew almost nothing and if this did not change he was going to be completely lost. Maybe Malfoy was right and he did not know what would hit him when he left Hogwarts.
“Ethan, there you are.” said a distinguished silky voice from behind them.
“For old pureblood families that is a normal amount of money to be deposited. It allows heirs to have monetary freedom and be able to learn how to handle money. Of course, as you can see this amount has increased over the years. In the first years of your life there is no need to provide you with this amount of money. And Harry, if you turn to the next page, you can see that this deposit barely makes a dent in the main Potter vault,” explained Severus. Ethan and Ryan each also had a trust vault in their name with similar amounts being deposited into it. It was mainly used to buy presents or extras that they did not particularly need.
Looking around Mr. Malfoy and noticing both Ethan and Ryan, he laughed, “so how are my nephews?”
“Uhm Ok” stated Harry
Right at that moment, there was a group of six golden unicorns coming out of the forest. Four of them were clearly adults, while the last 2 were smaller. Following Professor Moonlight the class walked towards the golden unicorns. Motioning to the class to stop, a few meters away from the group of unicorns, Professor Moonlight stepped forwards, stopping right next to the unicorns.
“Do you have your key mister Potter?”
Serena and Severus had also been a huge help in helping him get through the social minefield that is politics and etiquette. In just a few days’ time, they had already pointed out so many things that he was doing wrong. He honestly did not realize that you could insult or offend people in so many different ways. It was truly a miracle that he had survived this far. But even with all the lessons and rules that were being drilled into his head, he was still quite worried about attending the balls. This was already his second chance, which meant he would not get another. Meeting the Malfoys for Christmas would be some kind of pre-test. While Harry still had to abide by most of the rules, it would be in an informal setting, which would provide him with a bit more leeway. He had been so relieved when Severus told him that no matter what he decided concerning the adoption, they would still continue to help him with any etiquette and rules he needed. At least that gave Harry one less thing to worry about.
“I would wake up, and make breakfast. After breakfast, I was given a list of chores to do for the day. I would also make lunch and dinner and then go back to sleep,” said Harry.
“I know, Harry. For what you have told me from your home situation, I would be extremely surprised if they send you back there. And believe me when I tell you that I will do anything to make sure that you do not end up there again,” stated Severus.
Looking at Mdm. Hawks and then at Severus, Harry decided “I will give you my memories if Severus is the one to extract them. I only trust him.”
For each of the properties, a specific file is included that lists all the material and human assets on the properties. Some properties had 15 house-elves, while others had rare Abraxans. There were properties that were fully furnished and had a gigantic library, while others were in a state of decay.
Due to several requests, I have decided that the next chapters will be longer. This also means that it will take a longer time for me to update. Let me know what you think.
‘Who is she?’ Harry wondered.
It was unbelievable that people had been receiving money from the Potter accounts without any reason. Harry was wondering how he never noticed that they were never his friends. They were paid to be his friends. To be honest he was glad that Hermione was not part of this, at least that meant that some friends of him had been real. Thinking about it this might explain Ron’s behavior last year during the Tournament. He did drop Harry from one day to another. But this, no he never thought this was possible.
“Now, what I called you in here for is to decide what to do when your guardians are deemed unfit. Selena and I spoke lengthily about this and we also talked to the boys and if you would like it we would like to offer to adopt you if you like. The choice is completely up to you,” said Severus, now directly looking into Harry’s eyes.
“Severus mentioned the horrible things they had done to you. If you need help bringing them to justice, feel free to ask. Maybe Severus did not mention this, but I am also a qualified magical attorney.”
“How come I was placed with the Dursleys and Dumbledore was my guardian when my parents clearly did not want that.” Harry asked desperately for an answer.
Looking at Ethan, Harry replied, “To be honest I never hated Severus. But from the moment I entered Hogwarts he hated my guts, would give me detentions whenever he could. But this past semester I think for the first time he is giving me a chance. Being here for Christmas, it is the first time I know how it feels to be part of a family and I am not sure if I will be able to go back to how things were before.”
“No.” said Hermione. “I do not understand that they do not tell the prefects, we should know.”
I want to say: I don’t own any of the characters except the one that I made up.
While Harry was glad that he was finally starting to learn everything he needed to, he could not deny that he was not looking forward to the work. He had hoped that he would still have plenty of time to play Quidditch and so but that did not seem realistic. It was of course only logical seeing that he was behind almost 2 years on his peers, who started at the age of 14 and lived their whole lives in the wizarding world.
Before Harry could try to run away or hide, Severus quickly grasped him. Holding him like you would hold a small child; he started rocking Harry back and forth saying comforting things at the same time. After the shock wore off being awoken, Harry started crying.
“Youngest first,” ordered Ryan with a smile, already making his way to the mountain of presents. Taking out all presents with his name on he started ripping into them. Harry was very happy that Ryan loved the gift he had gotten him. He had ordered him a live-action Quidditch book. It worked like the muggle computer games, only this time you were in the game. This one specifically allowed Ryan to practice playing Quidditch without needing a broom.
“That is why we are here, my grandson discovered that mister Potter is not aware of anything he should be aware of as the lord apparent of the House of Potter. And for some reason the owls from the Ministry for the summer heir classes also did not reach him.” added Mdm. Longbottom.
“Thank you,” said Harry before entering his room.
“Mr Thomas the ministry adds creatures to the care of magical creature curriculum when a new species is discovered. It only rarely erases a species, this only happens when a certain magical creature has not been seen for at least 500 years. The reason herefore is that most rare magical creatures have gone into hiding because of poachers. That is why certain creatures are considered extinct. The only reason why all of you have seen a phoenix is that fawkes is heavily protected by Headmaster Dumbledore. Others of its kind are in hiding because the feathers and tears of a phoenix are worth lots of galleons.” answered professor Moonlight.
This means that I have been looking for a replacement. Sadly enough I have been unsuccessful. I was wondering if any of you know someone who is qualified and would be willing to teach this subject in the coming years?"
The next letter had an entire different tone.
While Harry was speaking, Mdm. Hawks took multiple notes on what was being said. Sometimes she would react in a sadder tone and sometimes she would look angrier at what was being said. After a while, Harry did feel like he could trust her more and started going into more detail of what truly happened in the years he lived at the Dursleys.
“So Draco, are you ready for your inheritance to come in this year?” wondered Ethan.
“Wait for a second, there was never a will reading of Lily and James Potter. We all thought that there was no will,” proclaimed Mdm. Longbottom.
Quickly glancing at Harry Severus Snape said “I want all transfers of money stopped as soon as possible. I also want a copy of all previous transfers, send to me so we can get every galleon back. Don’t worry Harry, it might take some time but we will get everything back”.
“Creature inheritance?” asked Harry, looking at Malfoy.
“But she was just a friend” Harry interrupted her.
“Now that you are all fed and watered I have a few announcements to make. I would like all of you to welcome back professor Remus Lupin. Due to a change in the law he has returned as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Also due to circumstances, we had to say goodbye to Hagrid as your professor of Care of Magical Creatures. No worries you will still see him around as the groundkeeper.” said Professor Dumbledore in a very sad tone.
When Harry makes his way back to the house, drenched in sweat and rain, he finds Draco still in the piano room. There is someone with him, Harry realises as he opens the French doors and the sound of animated conversation immediately wafts into the wet morning air. Harry steps inside.
Your body is electric and fight-ready, every cell is awake and alive and screaming underneath your skin with want and need. A dreadful sense of loss, too. The sound goes straight to your spine and spreads, deadly and flammable as lighter fluid, to every inch of your body. It seeps into your bloodstream, and you need something to happen, suddenly. You need to turn yourself inside out, you need to claw at your stomach with fingernails and finger bones, you need to scream at the sky and cry out the ocean you’ve been keeping inside you for longer than you remember.
He lets you, and you take an armful of him. You touch him, and you hold him, and you pour everything that you feel into the contact of your skins.
You send him an owl.
“I know you pushed for Draco’s murder to be investigated,” she adds, squeezing my hand, “and I know what it cost you. Just do what you can, Potter. I trust you.”
Harry doesn’t answer. Draco doesn’t stop watching the sunset, and Harry doesn’t stop watching Draco. Only when it is entirely dark, do they push themselves to their feet and walk back to their inn.
cutting his heart into ribbons. Pain radiated in his chest as he forgot how to breathe or how to talk or how to cry. In the silence, Draco moved swiftly towards the door. A soft click: Harry was alone.
You don't expect Draco to come back, you realise. And it might have broken you at any other point in time, but you've just talked about who you really are for the first time in your entire life, and hundreds of people listened, and Lee shook your hand and thanked you, and the world didn't end, and you can't let it matter.
If I agree to your rules and promise I will not try to find out who you are, will you still answer some questions for me? I’m not trying to pry but I still feel we should know some things about each other. You know, just to make sure we’re really compatible? Maybe give us something to talk about? I can’t very well go on sharing my deplorable journal entries about how depressing I find the concept of living if I want to stand a chance of coming across as even slightly appealing.
Draco smiles back.
too much, it’s entirely too much, and Harry thinks he’ll die with the overwhelming sensation of it, but Draco whimpers and cries out Harry’s name every time Harry moves just so,
(There is freedom in the fall: Harry jumps.)
Still, when I drop the glamour, I have to push all the words through my teeth when I tell him about the dreams. I don’t want to leave anything out, in case it turns out to be important, so I make myself go through everything: the forest and the sea and the white lab, the way he looked at me, and the way he talked to me. The kisses. The sex, too. By the time I’m done, I feel nauseous and exhausted.
You punch the wall next to the bed, and it leaves a dent in the plaster.
“Draco…” Harry starts, feeling like he’s standing in the epicentre of an earthquake (wishing the ground might do him the kindness of swallowing him alive.)
, and Harry’s armour cracks. Then, Draco goes and whispers praise onto the skin of his shoulder (
You knock on Draco’s door after a particularly difficult Auror raid. You’re raw and tired and vulnerable, and you need him more than you need to breathe. Draco lets you in. Draco ties you up to the bed, and it’s everything you’ve ever needed.
Mrs Malfoy smiles at the words.
I decide I won’t write back.
“We’d be glad if you did,” Harry answers. “I look forward to meeting them.”
“Please don’t leave me, Draco. Please don’t leave me.”
We spent three months in that forest. We fought a good deal then too, but your grandad, he was always fair and strong and he never gave up. He could have, you know, he could have just gone home and decided it wasn’t his problem what my father had or hadn’t hidden in that forest. He never did, and I admired him endlessly for it.
“This part requires some concentration,” he warns me as the contents of his cauldron turn bright turmeric yellow. I tell myself his change in demeanour is entirely explained by the apparent difficulty of this step in the brewing process and watch him in silence.
The rain is dripping into Harry’s eyes, and his hands are slippery and cold and he runs them over his neck. He is frozen to the bone, and he pretends it’s the weather that’s sending chills running over his skin. (Not Draco. Not Draco.)
It was one of the bad days. Draco hadn’t talked to him since they arrived that morning and refused to admit there was anything wrong despite Harry’s insistence. By mid-afternoon, every organ in Harry’s chest had liquefied into an infinite ocean of sadness and injustice and he was trying to spell the black wallpaper off of the walls in what he imagined would be his study. It wasn’t an easy task: the wallpaper was resisting with everything it had, tearing in long strips and always leaving dark residue on the plaster behind. Frustration left wet trails on Harry’s cheeks as he fired his spells ragingly at the walls over, and over, and over, and over again.
You are. I am assuming you’re male too, for the record.
“I couldn’t stop thinking about you,” you say into the crook of his neck as if it could somehow explain the ants and the emptiness, the nausea and the loneliness. He pulls you closer, fists his hand in your hair, and you can’t find it in yourself to tell him more. Not now, not now, not when he’s warm and soft against you, not when you love him so much and you’ve missed him like a thunderstorm.
Theodore is not at all the person I remember from school. He’s dressed in a healer robe that’s seen better days, his hair gathered in a messy bun at the back of his neck. He looks overworked and worried, not at all rich, or posh, or self-assured. For a reason I don’t quite understand, perhaps because he reminds me how much we’ve all changed since the end of the war, I instantly feel a little more at ease.
“Sorry, I er… I didn’t mean to spend the night,” you add, because your brain and your mouth are apparently not connected.
Love,
. This story starts with a door slammed shut and your own tears, heavy and hot behind your eyelids. You don’t know when it came to this. You don’t know when things went to shit between the two of you, you don’t know when you started fighting in the kitchen and ignoring each other at the dinner table. If you thought about it, it’d frighten you, because the only future you ever saw was you and her with rings around your fingers and a house full of children. It’s all you ever thought you wanted.
You end up at the Unicorn and Thestral. It’s not a choice, not really, it’s just warm and loud, it’s just got alcohol and your friends, and you hope you can lose yourself in it all. You can’t, of course, the alcohol just fuels the dark, heavy cloud of rain and hurt pulsating just behind your ribs. Ron makes a joke, and everyone laughs, and you just think of Ginny’s words, of how their sharp points have pricked right through your skin and lodged themselves in your bloodstream.
“I can try. They’re shy, though. And they won’t be able to speak English, you know? You don't magically learn every language when you’re dead. I only speak it because my mum grew up in England before she came to Switzerland to marry my dad. The rest of them only speak French, with varying degrees of awful, thick accents, might I add. Some people like Mrs Kolly never left the village where they were born before coming here, and it really shows. Then, there’s Greta and Vreni, and they speak Swiss-German, but I don’t think that’s going to help you to understand them more. Even we don’t always understand what they’re trying to say. You’d think some people lose their ability to learn at the same time as their ability to breathe, from the way they act! A hundred years to pick up a new language and they still can’t manage a proper sentence…”
“Miles,” I blurt out, and this is my second mistake. “Miles Bletchley. We’re… Um. Friends.”
“Could have fooled me, Potter”, he spits, before opening the door and disappearing into the empty darkness of the hallway.
My darling little one,
“You said the words were threats, what exactly do they say?” I ask, plopping myself gracelessly down onto the couch.
“Thank you.”
There are nights when feelings drain away from you entirely, and the world turns monochrome, all cotton-wool and wrapping foam. There are nights when you feel so empty you can’t believe anything would ever fill you up. You feel so empty you wish the fire ants were back in your veins. You feel so empty you want to claw at your skin until you see your blood, until you’re reassured that it’s still there, that you’re still alive. And you can’t remember how to exist anymore. You can’t remember how to be human, how to smile or how to cry. All you know is the pulsating emptiness behind your ribs and the unbearable feeling of loneliness and pain, and you can’t live like this, you can’t.
I'm eternally grateful to the lovely
You find yourself on Draco’s doorstep a week later. You have no idea if he’s going to open the door and you have no idea how he’s going to react. You haven’t thought about it. About any of it, if you’re honest.
Sometimes, after Draco leaves, you’d give anything for him to walk back through the door, cradle you in his arms and kiss your hair. Sometimes, after Draco leaves, the emptiness in your chest crushes your lungs and ruptures your spleen, and you collapse to the floor in a panicked, choking heap.
Let us start before that. Let us start with a quiet shop in a bustling wizarding street. Let us call that shop “Patrician Potions”. It is small inside, spartan but tastefully decorated. If you were to ring the delicate bronze bell sitting on the cold, smooth, black marble of the counter, a blond man would appear and ask you in a calm voice how he can help you. But let us not do that, reader. Let us not bother him—he’ll have trouble enough when the story finally starts in earnest.
You Apparate to his doorstep, with a declaration of love on the tip of your tongue. He’ll listen, he’ll have to, you try to convince yourself as your good hand makes contact with the cool wood of the door.
I’m never as honest as when I talk to you. I’m usually a pretty guarded person. I find it difficult to open up, I guess. I feel comfortable with you. And it feels good. I think I’d like honesty in a relationship too. I think I’d like to make the conscious choice to share. I like the idea of deciding to trust the person I love, over and over again, with all the important things in my life. Is it silly that I think about you as one of the people who knows me the most completely? You don’t even know what I look like. I could be ugly. Even if I’m not, I could be the complete opposite of what you find attractive. Maybe I’m not at all your type.
Draco lets out a soft little whine, the kind that sounds exalted and anxious and lightning-struck all at once.
“I did like you asked, Draco,” she announces, a mischievous smile dancing over her round little face. “Everyone has agreed to meet you both today. Not that it was easy, mind you. Agnès, the absolute bint, kept complaining that it was too early for her to be up and that she needed her beauty sleep. It’s quite incredible, the way some people have no concept of what being dead entails.”
(You’re an Auror, and you’re a professional, and some nights, you can hardly sleep because
, Harry thinks, delirious with arousal.
“Don’t…”
“There will be difficult days, because neither you nor I are the kind of people who get to live happily ever after. We are always going to be the kind of people with cracks in their souls and bruises on their sense of self and there will be days when we’ll get swallowed by the dark until we can’t find a way out. But I want to hold your hand in the darkness until you find the light again, Draco. I will sit with you until you’re able to see again, if you’ll let me. And if you can love me for all that I am, for every scar the war left on my skin and every hole it left in my heart, I’ll give you everything else too. I’ll give you the infinite love that lives in my chest, and I’ll give you the early morning smiles, and the soft evening words, and everything in between too. I’ll give you everything, if you’ll have me, Draco.”
“Wait… What happened?” I ask because I’m suddenly flooded with the nagging feeling that whatever happened, it is serious.
“Let them be, Iris. It isn’t always easy, figuring things out. We should know!”
Every single feeling comes rushing back to you, and you feel your ribs fissuring at the tidal-wave impact of love and loss and longing. You reach out to him. You touch his hair. You need to know he's real. You need to know you're not imagining it entirely.
Making Harry come out of his thoughts.
“Miss” “Greengrass”
“Good Harry, are you ok?” Neville replied looking up. But for the first time, he saw that Harry looked both confused and even a bit nervous. Like he was afraid to ask something, or maybe he was afraid of the answer?
Seeing she had his full attention she continued, “The house-elves have already taken them and put them in your closet. Feel free to choose which one you will be wearing tonight; all three are appropriate.”
“Why do people here think that you are so bad? I mean, they keep asking questions about how it is to live with you and when I tell them you are just like any other dad they don’t believe it.” said Ethan.
“I don’t want to hear it,” Serena said forcefully, “Harry, the Patils are a high up pureblood family. It is only your luck, that for some reason your treatment of her has not gotten around. You will write an apology letter by tonight and before you send it off you will show it to me.”
After what had happened with Mr. Potter the Department started an investigation in every orphaned child that was placed in the last 30 years. They were working alongside Gringotts to make sure that they were not missing anyone. The reason here for was that until recently de Department did not even have a file for Mr. Potter. This meant that even if someone had done a regular check-up they wouldn’t have found anything, as Mr. Potter had not existed. Besides the investigation in other orphaned wizards and witches, there was also a special investigation happening concerning Mr. Potter’s case. The Department was desperately hoping that it was just an oversight that had happened in the highs of the war. Because the other option was either someone in the Department had hid Mr. Potter illegally or that they had been spelled to forget about his case. In that case, one had to wonder what other Departments had illegal activities going on. And even worse, that would mean that someone had been able to influence someone illegally and undetectable for more than 15 years. If that would come out the trust in the Ministry would completely disappear.
“Harry,” Severus said, making Harry look up to him, “Over the past week we have gotten to know you, and each of us would love it if you also became part of our family.”
“Feel free to call us Lucius or uncle Lucius and Narcissa or aunt Narcissa. You are considered family to Severus and you are family to Narcissa before through Lord Black,” Lucius stated with a small smile before sitting back down.
‘Have dinner with Snape??? That is going to be fun.’
“No I did that by myself, and I have been doing it for as long as I remember. I can’t really remember not doing it.”
“Ravenclaw.” was then called out.
“I thought they were extinct?” said Greengrass.
“Finally” Harry exclaimed entering the dorm room “I was able to get away from Ron and Hermione as Hermione wanted to do some last minute revision before the holidays. What did your grandmother reply? Can she help?” Harry asked getting nervous and excited at the same time.
While he still did not believe it, Harry decided to drop the subject for now. For the rest of the afternoon, the three of them just talked about everything.
“So females really are second to sons. I never thought that equality was so far to be sought.” Exclaimed Harry, feeling quite disturbed by the treatment he thought women received in the wizarding world.
Taking a seat at the table, Harry made sure to take the one furthest away from Snape, placing him in-between Luna and Ethan. During dinner they talked about random stuff between each other. In the meanwhile, Snape and Professor Moonlight talked between themselves.
“I, I didn’t want you to be mad at them or me. I know you wanted me in Slytherin.”
“Godfather?”
“As you can see, the top of this section mentions the standing orders that we canceled when we visited Gringotts,” said Severus, starting to go over every withdraw and deposit of funds since the Potters were alive.
“Hi dad, I was wondering if you have some time right now?” said Ethan upon entering the room.
“You mentioned a cupboard. Was this just used for punishments?”
"He also mentioned that he never told us about you because he wanted to keep you out of the war. So why are you making yourself known now?"
"Yes"
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked getting really confused. What the hell is Malfoy talking about? Me being a lord? He must probably have misspoken. And what was happing this summer, did Hogwarts provide extra classes to prepare students for their OWLs? He knew for certain that he did not receive any mail about something going on during the summer otherwise he would have gone. Did Malfoy just complement Neville for showing up? But that would mean that Neville was invited to these summer meetings. Maybe he can tell me what the hell Malfoy is talking about.
“Yes, Ethan.” answered Snape in the nicest tone that they had ever heard.
“Harry,” explained Severus in a calm tone “Marriage contracts are just there to protect the child. Normally each party can easily leave the contract when they do not longer find it beneficial. There is of course also always a clause in it that allows a party to leave in case his or her creature’s mate is found. Having a marriage contract protects children from being entered into other unbeneficial marriage contracts. As you know it is impossible to have two marriage contracts. This means that if a child, more specifically the heir to a House, already has a marriage contract he or she can in no way be tricked into another one. This method is used by most old Houses to prevent children from being accidentally being entered into marriage contracts that are there to gain access to their fortune.”
“Well Sir” said Luna, almost afraid of answering the question, “some of the older students warned the new kids about you. Others have siblings who talked about you and well. Nobody wants to be friends with someone whose father is seen as evil.”
Feeling Harry’s magic reacting to his anger Severus quickly intervened, still recovering from his own shock of the absurd marriage contract, “Do not worry Harry they have made some unmistakable mistakes that will allow us to break this marriage contract quite easily.”
Harry looked up and saw Luna with the oldest Snape boy coming his way.
“Did punishments change after you moved into the bedroom?”
“What you can’t do that,” exclaimed Harry in anger, how dare he.
“Are they really the sons of Snape?”
“You said before that all the Wizengamot seats are decided based on the lordships. Does this mean that muggle-borns and some half-bloods are never able to be seated there?” asked Harry, no wonder a lot of people looked down on muggle-borns if they never had any say to begin with.
“Don’t tell me that this child has been stolen from as well!” stated Mdm. Longbottom outraged, who would dare steal from a minor?
“Heir Potter-Black,” stated Lord Malfoy standing up and holding out his hand for Harry to take.
“Harry, this is not ok. No one but you should have your key. Look, I will owl my grandmother and ask her what to do. For now, don’t talk about this to anyone until we figure out who is behind all of this and what is going on.” Neville said. His grandmother would for sure know how to best handle this. This was a complete outrage, a pureblood not knowing anything. This also explained how Harry had acted in these last few years. While we were all thinking he was being disrespectful and did not care, the truth was he had no idea about anything.
“I understand dad, when will we be telling Harry?”
“Is it true that the wills were never read? Why did you seal them?” exclaimed Sirius.
“Yes, sir” replied Harry. While he didn’t like that his life was being controlled this was also the first time that someone seemed to care about what he was doing.
This got everyone to quickly be quiet. Still looking at Severus, he asked: "Why did we not know you were married?"
Unfortunately for Harry the discussion about the Yule ball also led to dance classes. Once Serena noticed that Harry was absolutely horrible at dancing she immediately tried to rectify this issue. Harry would not be able to go to a Yule ball without the bare minimum of dancing skills.
“Hey Harry, you want to join us?” said Ethan looking up from the game.
"He will have to be sorted with the first years and can follow classes with the third years, but if we see he is not up to their level he will have to be lowered a year. Both sons will have to stay in their dorms and will have curfew as everyone else. If this is all ok with you, you have the job."
“Yes, I was able to get through the first few pages,” replied Harry.
“What did Ripclaw mean yesterday when he called you Lord Prince-Snape? And why do you not use it.” wondered Harry. He had never heard of the name Prince before and wondered why Severus did not use it.
Who would have guessed that the present attached was a book? But Harry did not really care about the present, it was the letter that was the best present. It was good to know that he at least still had Hermione on his side. He was hoping to show her some of the evidence against Dumbledore and Ron when he was back at Hogwarts. Hopefully, she would remain his friend.
Before heading to bed Harry was stopped by Severus, handing him a small potion bottle. “Harry, this is a dreamless sleep potion. Take it for tonight, but you cannot take this to much or you will get addicted to it.”
But, while you are a minor you are 15 years old, which means that your opinion will also be taken into account. I would advise you to take your time to choose a new guardian. Your current guardians were muggles, so they had little to say in the wizarding world, but if your new guardian is a wizard or witch they will have a lot more power over your daily life.”
“Nice to meet you sir, my name is Harry” Harry replied nervously. “The problem is that I don’t have my Gringotts key. And what do you mean trying to contact me? I have never received anything from Gringotts.”
“No, no, I mean your magical guardian, muggles cannot sole guardians of wizards. For muggle-borns, their head of house is their temporary guardian. And what do you mean you have never received owls?” Neville asked surprised. How could Harry not know about all of this? Of course, Harry had a magical guardian. It would have been impossible to attend Hogwarts otherwise since they needed someone to contact in case something happened. Since muggles could not enter Hogwarts, this created the absolute need for a magical one.
Seeing he would not get any answers, Sirius decided to leave but not before threatening Dumbledore, “If I find out you had anything to do with this, you can find yourself a new Headquarters and don’t forget that I am a Black. We always get our revenge.”
Tens of meters before the entrance professor Snape stopped and turned around, “normally I would have apparated inside the entrance hall, but since you are not keyed into the wards that is not possible. I need you to stand still for a few minutes to allow me to key you in,” stated professor Snape.
Nothing of book 5 has happened. No one knows yet, except the old members, about the existence of the Order of the Phoenix. Also, Umbridge is not the defense teacher, Albus got Remus to teach again.
Not waiting for an answer he started waving his wand around in what looked like a complicated pattern. While professor Snape was doing this Harry could feel something slightly pulling on his magic.
"You will be known as professor Moonlight, so people do not confuse you with professor Snape." Albus said with his twinkle.
“But, what about inheritances, I would be the oldest,” stated Harry trailing off.
Next he opened the presents from Neville, giving him an ancient looking scroll on dueling techniques. From Luna he received stationary materials with for both the Black and Potter house. Both had written him a short letter wishing him a merry Christmas and looking forward to seeing him tonight at the ball. Knowing both of them would be in attendance helped settle some of Harry’s nerves.
“So you will be staying with us for the Christmas holidays” stated Ethan very exited.
“It is no problem at all Harry, I hope you will have a great time here” Serena replied encouraging before dinner appeared on the table.
“They are fine. And I am sure that you will have an easier time. Most of the time I am learning things both of you probably already know about. Plus I need to catch up an entire year in just a few weeks,” said Harry.
Looking further at all the investments and shares Severus concluded, “everything seems to be in order an there are currently no shares that I would advice you to sell. If you want to look into it more, you can always do so of course.”
“As there were some issues with your vaults and the standing orders, we will go through those first and make our way through all the sections. Today is for you to learn how to be able to read the files and we can also see if there are any irregularities. After today you will be able to propose changes, such as investments, but you will need my approval before they will be applied. For the Black account, you are only the heir, so you cannot make any adjustments yet, you can only review the statements,” continued Severus.
There was another boy walking forwards looking very nervous, he had brown hair and piercing black eyes. All his other features were the same as Snape except for the nose.
“Ethan, Ryan, how do you like school so far?” asked professor Moonlight suddenly.
Looking down at his own list, Severus stated, “It would seem so. Hmm, this would mean that you have some control over what is printed. If you can find someone who has at least 15% of the shares, you can control what they write.”
They quite some time going over the table manners before continuing on to the proper personal interaction. He learned proper greetings for when Harry would be introduced to people and how he had to interact differently with his peers compared to the adults in the room. But even then, he was required to act differently depending on the station of each person. He quickly realized that the way Malfoy had acted in first year was actually normal and it was he who had not replied appropriately. Furthermore, when last year’s Yule ball at Hogwarts was brought up Serena was horrified on how he had treated Parvati Patil.
“Seriously Harry, how do you not know this? Most of the school does.”
A few seconds later Twinkle popped back in “Here master, anything else Twinkle can do?”
They spend quite some time after that discussing what had happened to Harry, before moving on to some more political subjects, before dinner was called. After dinner the adults retreated to have a drink, leaving the children alone again in the sitting room. Harry was actually surprised by how well the evening was going. He discovered that the Malfoys were very enjoyable without their masks on. Narcissa was extremely doting and had, together with Serena, already roped him in for another shopping trip over the Easter holidays. Lucius on the other hand was more serious, but someone he felt he could count on. Lucius did have a very confident air around him, and now Harry knew where Draco must have learned it.
Opening the next letter, he was happy to see it was from Remus. Reading through it, it was similar to the one he received from Sirius, just a little bit more mature but also worried. As a present he received a book on creature inheritances.
“Wait a minute do I not get any say in this. Not to be disrespectful, but why can I not stay with Neville?” Harry said sounding really confused. So much had happened in such a short time that he did not know what to do anymore.
“Well, he would get presents for holidays and birthdays. I also only got his cast downs, clothes, toys, They would also take him on holidays and leave me with Mrs. Figg.”
“Now for today you did not have to prepare anything, so listen carefully when I explain what to do and what not to do.” said Professor Moonlight.
“No, it was my bedroom until I was eleven. After I got my Hogwarts letter they moved me into my cousin's second bedroom.”
“Without him mentioning it I would have never noticed something was wrong. I still cannot believe that they would do something like that. I trusted them and they stole from me, kept my inheritance away, and placed so many different spells and potions on me,” glowered Harry, getting worked up, being reminded of what had happened.
“No. Did you not learn this in DADA? Magic itself is just that, magic. It is what you do with it that defines it as good or bad. This is the reason why even people with unicorn hair in their wand can perform dark magic, as long as it is not with a bad intention. If it is the wand will start to split. If continued to use for bad prepossess, it will break.” Said Professor Moonlight.
“But that’s impossible, your guardian should have informed you at 13 and you should have also received a letter from the Ministry.” Neville exclaimed, getting more outraged as the conversation moved along.
After reading the paper he was in complete shock, but it quickly turned into anger when he saw Dumbledore entering the dining room.
“I don’t think so, Ron. He does look an awful lot like Professor Snape.” said Hermione.
“You keep saying male children and sons, does that mean that females don’t get anything?” asked Harry.
“We shall see, it also depends on where you will be living by then,” stated Severus, before going to taking out the next section.
"She is my wife." said Severus, inwardly smirking at the shocked looks he got from the other staff members.
“Ok, no problem.” Answered Harry before heading back towards the castle.
After classes, Harry decided to go to the lake to relax a bit. Hermione was with Ron in the library explaining some homework.
Seeing where Severus was going, Mdm. Hawks assured Harry, “Lord Snape-Prince is correct Mr. Potter. You don’t have to fear anything becoming public. The worst that can happen is that they will know that your guardians were deemed unfit, the details of why are confidential. This is also the reason that we are in this office instead of in a courtroom. When the case concerns minors we always have the utmost privacy.”
+++++
“You are right, I cannot imagine that Lily and James would have not had several guardians listed in their will in case something happened.” Mdm. Longbottom said looking over at Ripclaw to look in the will.
“I believe you”
Chapter 1: The wife
Looking at the file Harry mentioned, Severus replied, “Since this is a four-way contract the contract between Lupin and Black and maybe even Pettigrew is still valid. It has turned blue to show that it is no longer valid for a member of the Potter House. When you find this contract in the Black files it will show as normal, but James’ name will have turned light blue.”
“Well, with or without the adoption you are already our brother,” exclaimed Ryan, while Ethan nodded along. Hearing this Harry had never felt so included before, not even at the Weasleys.
Looking through the documents. "All seems to be in order. Now I heard you have conditions?"
Taking out his books, quills, ink, and parchment he decided to take a more Hermione like approach and make some kind of plan. Luckily for him, not each professor decided to give them homework this year. He had to write an essay for potions, charms, transfiguration, and DADA. Then he also needed to read and study some chapters for potions, transfiguration, herbology, and care of magical creatures. Under the pressure of Hermione, he had already finished his transfiguration homework and Neville had helped him already with his herbology readings as well. Looking at the time he decided to start with his DADA homework. He hoped he would have it finished by lunchtime.
“Slytherin.” the hat called out. Resulting in the Slytherin table and the staff clapping politely.
“My magical guardian? I don’t even know who my magical guardian is!” shouted Harry getting upset; he had never felt so powerless before. He calmed down when he felt a hand on his shoulder from Mdm. Longbottom telling him “calm down Harry, we will sort all of this out.”
Harry was feeling overwhelmed. His relatives had received money for him? Uncle Vernon always said Harry had to work for his keep and now he hears they have actually received money? It would not surprise them if the money they received had been spent on Dudley. Did he say that money had been taken for the past 8 years? But he only discovered the wizarding world 5 years ago, so how could he have taken money out?
Knowing his present was not as impressive as his own, Harry hoped Draco would still love it. Harry had gotten him a rare DADA book and a silver cauldron, knowing Draco wanted to get his Potion mastery besides his (later) Lord duties.
“Were there other areas in your life where you were treated differently from your cousin?”
“Ryan, I wouldn’t be mad at you, not for this. Them that’s something else, they shouldn’t treat you like that because of who I am. And Ryan it’s true that I would have preferred that you were in my house, but I wouldn’t have cared if you were sorted in any of the other 3 houses. The hat decided that you belong in Ravenclaw and that just means you’re my smart little boy and it’s the same house as your mum.” said Snape.
“Yeah, I am still a bit surprised by the offer. Not sure what to decide yet.”
AU: Harry met Luna in the fourth year.
Another problem was that Dumbledore had not allowed Harry to stay at Grimmauld Place. Sirius had been asking Dumbledore since the start of the summer holidays to get Harry to Grimmauld Place but was constantly told it was not possible. According to Dumbledore Harry had to stay the majority of the summer at the Dursleys for his own protection. When Harry was then finally allowed to leave the Dursleys it was decided that Grimmauld Place was too dangerous with people constantly coming and going. As a result, Harry stayed the Weasleys, but Sirius was not allowed to visit due to safety precautions.
“As I understand everyone of you has dropped Care of Magical Creatures for this year. Since the school board has decided that this is mainly because of Hagrid, some new rules apply. Since there is a new teacher it was decided that it would be allowed to sign up even though the due date has passed. The ones that want to make use of this option will be given an order paper to be sent by owl for Flourish and Blotts so that they are able to order their book for the course.” announced Professor McGonagall.
“Welcome to a new year! Before I make any announcements the sorting ceremony will begin. This year we also have a transfer student who will be joining the third years.” Professor Dumbledore said before sitting back down.
Seeing the cake attached Harry threw it away not trusting there not to be any potions and opened the next letter.
"Yes, I would want both of my sons transferred to Hogwarts. I would also want to have shared quarters with Severus."
In walked a beautiful woman. She had long brown hair that fell to just beneath her shoulders, hazel brown eyes that could see into your soul, and a blood red robe draped around her. But what drew all the attention were the green wings that hung folded on her back.
Looking at the time Severus decided to call it a day. “It is almost time for dinner, so we will stop here for today. Don’t forget to start reading your books when you have time.” Taking out a book from another shelf Severus handed it to Harry saying. “As a Lord, it is also necessary for you to learn occlumency, or mind arts. This is very hard, so I want you to read the entire book and start with meditating every night to try to clear your mind.” Said Severus before leaving.
"Thank you."
“No, not at all.” answered Harry. “So how have you been Luna? People still bothering you?”
“Is it true that you did not like dad?” said Ethan softly.
"No problem, as long as the students are informed of our relationship beforehand. We would want to prevent students drawing wrong conclusions and rumors going around."
“The shared quarters and your son who starts first year will be of no problem"
Seeing that Albus was not going to say more Minerva stood.
“Godfathers, like Sirius, did for the Black lordship, have the possibility to transfer their lordships to their godsons if they themselves don’t produce an heir. The ritual that is done after a godfather is chosen, mixes some of the blood of the godfather with that of the godson. This allows a lordship to be transferred. This is a very extreme measure and is normally only done in case the godfather is unable to reproduce.” Finished Severus, hoping the explanation had been sound.
The days awaiting the reply were very stressful for Harry. It had already been 2 days and he was getting more and more nervous as time went on. He had a hard time concentrating in class since his mind constantly wandered to what had happened. Even Ron and Hermione had noticed that something was up. While Harry noticed that Hermione was mainly just curious about what had taken his attention away, Ron was more persistent. He constantly kept asking Harry what was going on and was very offended when he saw Harry spending more time with Neville.
