“Shit.” He quickly made his way back to Draco, and he offered him the glass. “Can I steal him from you just for a second?” Harry asked Mr Weasley.
Despite himself Harry took a sniff, and he couldn’t exactly say he was surprised when he smelled apples and the typical smell of the lake, followed by the posh perfume Malfoy bought every time he visited his parents in Paris. “Apples," he simply said.
“Didn't want to end so fast.” He smirked, happy to see that he still had the power to rile Malfoy up. He attacked, but Malfoy was too quick and he managed to step aside.
He emerged right outside the forest. Everything was silent at the moment, the battle had been called off to give Harry the time to get to him, and yet he could feel it in the air, as if there was an echo of all the screams.
“I'm fine, I just need a good night of sleep,” Draco said, ignoring Harry’s death stare. Had it been for him, he would have put him in bed rest for a week.
“C’mon, I’m trying to be nice,” he said, laughing at Harry’s disbelieving expression. “We all grew up after the war, if he can change, so can I. And if my best friend ends up falling in love with him, I need to at least stand his presence.”
“I know, it still feels surreal.” He brought their hands to his lips and kissed Draco's. “You’ve been waiting long enough for this moment.”
“Yeah, to save the failure that is my father, who's currently in his house drinking his weight in alcohol. I helped
“Wow, I feel so relieved,” he said, sarcastic. “I just wanted to let you know that I truly admire you and your strength. That’s also one of the reasons I hated you so much, because I was jealous of you and how you just took whatever came your way and made it work.”
“I'd love that. What do you say we make dinner for Ron and Hermione? So we could stay at my place instead of going over. Would that help?”
“I wanted to, I just wasn't sure I would have been able to face all of this. We lost too many friends inside these walls, there are wounds that won't ever properly heal, some that I don’t want to heal because it would mean that I forgot.”
“I can, I just don’t see the point if it’s just me. I mean, I’d love to come home and cook for someone, but if it it’s just for me then I don’t care.”
“I know. I’m just being stupid and dramatic.” He held him tighter, then decided to just go for it and moved to sit on his legs and wrap himself all over him.
“Come here.” He gently put Theodore on the bed and he hugged Draco. “Did I freak you out?” he asked, resting his chin on his shoulder.
“Yes," he simply said. Considering Harry was expecting a punch on the arm, he was pretty happy with the answer.
“Well he seems very friendly, that’s for sure,” she said, raising both of her eyebrows suggestively.
Other people had started noticing how close they were, so he wasn’t really surprised when Malfoy came at lunch that day looking very red in the face and holding a piece of paper.
“I promise you, you can leave whenever you want to. Molly won’t mind at all, and the others just do whatever she says so you’ll be fine.”
“Well, as I’ve already said, we broke up a few years ago. We just didn’t make it public and we are still friends, so I guess people saw us together and assumed we are still a couple.”
“Good, I trust you, too.” He leaned forward to kiss him, smiling against his lips when he felt Draco’s hand sneaking behind his neck to keep him there and deepening the kiss.
“I don’t,” he said, but as soon as those words left his mouth, he wasn’t so sure about them. Did he like Malfoy? He liked spending time with him, he liked that they could talk and just understand each other without the need to explain things, he also liked how caring he was with the kids, and the fact that he was trying to better himself. He was also incredibly hot, especially when he wore his glasses, but that wasn’t the point.
“No, I heard Theo crying.” He hugged him and hid his face against his neck. “I’m going to miss this so much.”
“Of course, I’m sure Hermione will like it a lot.” He laid down and turned on his side to look at him. “Come here, cuddle me.”
“Thanks.” He smiled at his old professor. She had always been so stern and strict, but he knew she cared more than anyone else. He trusted her just as much as he had trusted Dumbledore, or maybe just a little bit less now that he knew what he had hidden from him.
“Is she worse than me?” Draco asked, looking kind of hopeful and so cute Harry just wanted to wrap him up and hide him in his room.
“Seems like once again people don’t believe me when I say there is something dangerous. Let’s hope it's going to be better than last time.” He knew he was being dramatic, but whatever. He was going to blame his proximity to Malfoy the day before. “If you’ll excuse me, I have to go get ready.” He left the room before his boss could hex him.
“But dad.” He got closer and crouched down, keeping Theodore in front of his face. “Dad Harry is sorry.”
“I’m sorry, I'm not the one who’s supposed to be crying.” He wiped at his face quickly, trying to calm himself.
They finally found an alley that was secluded enough to give them a minute of peace, and still holding hands they apparated inside one of the capsule of the London eye. Thank Merlin he had actually bothered stopping by the other day, and bless Hermione and her detailed route of how to get from a restaurant to another.
“See, he already likes you. Feel free to come and visit him whenever you want. Just make sure you bring him some food, he likes to be wooed.”
“If you keep this up, they will stop worshipping you soon enough. How long has it been since the last time you’ve eaten?” he asked, with his nose still wrinkled up in disgust.
“They told us to be careful, as if we could control all those teenagers who wants to sneak out into the night. We do what we can, but I’m pretty sure everyone at this stable has sneaked out at least once and has not been caught.”
"Alright, I’ll go see it. Can I send things over to the Headquarters? I was thinking that maybe Hermione might have an idea of what is going on.”
“No, some of ours had to use several spells on him to look at his memories, then we figured it out and contacted the witch. They are still running some tests on him, I’m not sure what’s going to happen once they are done, we don’t know yet if he can die since he had some human inside of him, or if he will be like this forever.”
“She really does not. She's so proud of what you’ve done these past years, sometimes she just shows me articles about you like a proud grandmother. Although I think part of that is because she knew about my crush.”
All the students nodded and started to work. A couple of them managed at the first try, and Draco was quick to praise them, but he never forgot about the other ones. He spent five minutes with a girl who was going crazy, and when she managed to get the spell right, he seemed happier than her.
Harry just smiled at him and reached him on the bad. “It shouldn’t be sexy, but I find it kinda hot to see you in my clothes.”
They left the room quickly, trying to avoid the busiest corridors, but they still met a couple of students, who were not so subtly checking Harry out.
They stopped holding hands as soon as the trees stopped covering them completely, but luckily for them they managed to reach Harry's room without seeing anyone.
Draco turned around with his eyebrow lifted. “Please no.” He was smiling now, not fully, not his beautiful big smile, but it was something.
“Yeah, that you suck at." He let go of him and finally Draco turned around. “Hi.” He smiled at him, feeling so happy he almost started jumping on the spot. “You are supposed to kiss me.” He pointed his finger to the ceiling.
“I’m fine now, everything is oayk.” He kissed his head, then moved down to be face to face. “Harry, look at me.” He waited for him to open his eyes, then he smiled at him. “Hello, there, beautiful.”
“I hate this," he whispered, and he was pleased to notice that Malfoy was fighting back a smile. Maybe it was going to work. After all, they weren’t that different. The things they had done during the war, they both had done them to protect their loved ones. He knew Malfoy wasn't the same person anymore, he was just raised with the wrong ideas. He, of all people, knew something about being raised in a household with questionable ideas.
“Do you just not want to see my Father or is there something else?” Draco asked, almost in a whisper.
“You too.” They awkwardly shook hands, and Harry had to really fight his huge grin at that. Seeing his boyfriend and his best friends in the same room was making him so happy and giddy. Even if they were never going to get along, it was so important to him that they were trying, for him.
“They already have a Defence teacher, why not him?” Malfoy was clearly not pleased with the request. Whether it was because of him or the subject, Harry didn’t know.
They went from a soup to roast with potatoes, green beans and carrots, and then moved on to a chocolate cake. Harry had discovered not too long ago that Draco loved chocolate more than he loved most people, and ever since he was little all cakes served at the Manor had been filled with chocolate.
“Please do that. I don’t want to hex one of the students. And please be careful if they ever give you a present, you never know.”
“They are so cute.” He saw a kitten staring at him, and he picked him up immediately. “Look at it, don’t you want to kiss him all over?” The cat was so small he could hold it in one hand, its fur was quite long and fluffy, all white with the point of his ears and his paws black, his lively eyes a beautiful blue.
“There are spells for that if you ever wanna try.” He put his hand on his cheek, forcing him to lift his head from their shoes. “Whatever you want, we can try it, and if you are not comfortable with something you can tell me.”
“Okay, then what’s the problem? Do you not like teaching with me? Because I can do it alone and then come here to spend time with you. Or have my own room if you need space. Is that the problem? I’m not imposing my presence too much, am I?”
“Just one or seven times,” he said, not able to hide his smile. “You also look amazing.” He leaned down slightly to kiss him quickly. “Shall we go?”
“That’s amazing, good job,” he said, truly impressed. He knew Malfoy was smart, on the same level as Hermione, but he wasn’t sure he would have been able to do it and especially not so quickly. “Listen, I have lunch at the burrow tomorrow, maybe you could come with me and talk to Hermione?”
“Yes, just please be careful. This is the only thing I have of, you know, my dad, Sirius and Lupin.”
“Well I’m pretty good, I can teach you something. It’s a bit like preparing potions, you just have to follow the recipe and it’s done, and you are great at that.”
“I really don’t think I’ll have to beg that much.” He smirked at him, relieved to know they were on the same page.
“Great, see you at lunch.” He started walking toward the owlery, forcing himself not to turn around to check on Malfoy. The stubborn prick.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” He smiled, and he was pretty proud when it felt genuine. “Well, we better go before we forget the layout of the forest. If you’ll excuse us.”
Draco was nervous, Harry knew he was. He looked tense and like he could snap at any minute, and he was holding Theo tight against his chest, but he was trying he best. He was smiling politely to Mrs and Mr Weasley, he had said hello to everyone, Ginny included, and he had even started a conversation with Ron.
“Alright.” He recovered the cloak from the closet and put it on Draco, making sure all of him was covered. “Ok, we can go now.”
“Ron took him to the Ministry, so that they can keep him away from people and also analyse him. The biggest mystery right now is how he killed his victims.”
“Of course, should I open the connection in your room or Draco's?” she asked, far too smug for someone who supposedly didn’t know the answer.
“I should have known this was an ambush to get me to work more. Alright, I will look into this for you.”
The students got up quickly, most of them left the room talking quietly between them, but a couple of Slytherin boys stopped to talk with him.
“He does. You should see him with the kids, he’s so great with them." He thought about a couple hours before, how nice and understanding he had been with his students.
And then someone screamed, and it wasn’t just someone, it was Draco, and it was a scream of pain. He turned around quickly, ready to kill anyone who had even dared touching his boyfriend, but he had to stop.
“Apparently some students think we look good together.” He unfolded the paper in front of him. It was a drawing of the two of them, not that great but enough to recognise who it was, and they were kissing.
“So, Harry, what exactly is going on?” Mister Weasley asked when everyone had food in front of them and were too occupied eating to bicker.
“Well, I want to go on a walk with my lovely boyfriend, and I want to cuddle him until we have to go back to school.”
Harry kept looking, but he couldn't make out anything. He didn’t feel anything, no chills, no adrenaline kicking in. He was almost one hundred percent sure there was nothing in that moment, and yet Malfoy was scared.
“Fuck, we have a kitten.” Without adding anything else he sprinted to Draco’s room. “Theodore. I’m so sorry, dad got hurt.” He picked him up from the sofa, where he was sleeping peacefully, clearly not caring at all that he had been alone for two hours. “Come, let’s go surprise dad.” He put him in his carrier just to be safe, he didn’t really know how he was going to behave outside and he was already too worried for Draco to lose sight of Theodore. Not to mention that Draco would have killed him if he had lost their kitten.
In that moment Theodore decided he needed their full attention, and they spent the rest of the day holed up in Draco’s room playing with him, asking the elves to bring them food so they wouldn’t have to leave even for their meals.
“We are trying to find a safe path, but since none of us ever went into the forest alone, at night maybe, with absolutely no protection, it’s hard to figure out something.” Subtlety was not one of his many talents.
“I am, I really am.” And he really meant it. Draco had gone from being his sort of nemesis, to a friend, to the person he loved. Holy shit he was in love. When did that happen? They had been properly together one week. It was not normal, was it?
They changed in silence, for the first time in the same room, then took turns in the bathroom. It all just felt so natural, and it would have been lovely, had it not been for Draco's worried face.
“Glad I can help.” He grabbed his penis and started moving his hand slowly, kissing the tip from time to time just to heard Draco’s desperate noises.
“Hi, can you please lower your voice?” He pointed to Draco, who hugged him closer in his sleep. “Fuck,” he whispered, not able to hide his huge smile. He reached out for a blanket and threw it over his shoulders.
“Well this is unexpected,” she muttered, leaving him alone for a couple of minutes while she retreated her vials.
“I know what you mean. I had a couple of panic attacks when I first started training. We would be in a huge field with a lot of people, and suddenly I was back at the battle and I couldn’t move anymore, his voice was in my head and I was scared again. It happens. We were kids, we saw people die, suffer, we saw friends fighting each other, the war destroyed our families, we will never get rid of this weight, but it will get better with time.”
“It’s really not a problem. There it is.” He found the pyjamas and he turned around to give it to Draco. “You have nothing to be embarrassed about, you know that, right?”
“Never had a proper boyfriend. I fooled around with Blaise when we were here, then I met a guy in Paris, we weren’t exclusive, it was just for sex really. I still had not come out to my parents, and they wanted me to marry a girl, so I didn’t want to get too involved and then have my heart broken. I don't think I would have fallen in love with him anyway.”
“There are a couple of Gryffindor who keep cornering us. They are older and usually more than us. They keep saying that we don't deserve to be here.”
“I’ll do it for today.” Hermione smiled at him and kissed his cheek when he settled the pensive in the middle of the table. “Alright, let's do it.” She pointed her wand at her head, and immediately a string of silver came out of it. “Who's coming?” she asked, keeping her memories just a bit over the pensive.
“I doubt it's much better for you. But we do have one very important thing in common and I’m sure we both want to do our best for him.”
Hagrid was there, with Narcissa Malfoy, Voldemort, Bellatrix was still alive as well, with her usual manic smile.
“Isn’t he?” he asked, lighting up. Fuck, he was so gone for that little kitten. “We almost taught him how to sit this evening. I didn’t know cats could do it but Draco insisted that our Theo is so smart.” And he was babbling about his cat. Time to go. “Ehm, anyway. Good night, thank you again.”
“Is it?” He turned his head slightly, waiting for Draco to get the hint and just kiss him already. Which he did, bless his smart little brain.
Malfoy pointed his wand toward the map to see better, and they started looking at the edges, trying to see if they could make out anything from the forest. “It looks like it stops too soon.”
“They are perfect, thank you,” he said, smiling to himself when Draco relaxed. He was such a perfectionist.
“Thank you.” She opened the door with a flick of her wrist, and both boys left as quickly as they could. Old habits die hard apparently.
He tried not to look too to upset at the idea, but he wasn’t sure he did such a great job at it. “I’d like that.”
“I am. Happier than I’ve ever been, or at least happier than I can remember being. And that’s the scary part, because my happiness depends solely on you. I know it’s not heathy, don’t go into therapist mode with me.”
“That’s not the point,” Ron said, sensing he had said to much. “He had a crush on you and he won’t admit it.”
He went back to his room to put away the cloak and collect what Robards had sent him, and then he left for muggle London. Apparently, a wizard had been selling real love amulets to tourists, and there had been many calls to the department to get rid of the spells.
“Oh, now we are getting married?” He sat up more upright to look at him, and Harry was expecting a more panicked smile, not a huge grin and crinkled eyes.
“Evening, students,” started McGonagall, finally taking pity on him, “as I’m sure you all have noticed, we have a new addition to our teaching body. Auror Potter agreed to give you all some lessons on Defence Against the Dark Arts, and he will be joined by Professor Malfoy. The lessons will start next week, and they will be compulsory, for all of you. You will find a timetable in your common rooms. While he is here, I expect you all to treat him respectfully. You will not ask for autographs or photos and you will not follow him around. Let dinner begin.” She clapped once and dinner appeared on all of the tables, including the one Harry was sitting at. If there was a thing he had missed about Hogwarts, it was the food.
He arrived at the owlery and was only slightly mobbed by a couple of first years, nothing that a good smile couldn’t solve, then he was finally able to sit down to write Hermione a note that just said ‘I’ll explain Sunday, can you check these?’, before sending off the owl. It still hurt at times, seeing those beautiful birds and not seeing Hedwig next to them. He missed her so much. He had never thought he would have been able to create such a special bond with an animal, and yet Hedwig had been everything to him in those years. When everyone was against him, when not even Ron wanted to talk with him, he had her. His friends had tried to get him to buy another owl, but he just couldn’t bring himself to do it.
When they got there, Madam Pomfrey basically sent away all other students complaining for a cold, and sent Hagrid to call some healer from the hospital as soon as Harry told her what had happened.
He woke up to Draco caressing his head, his other hand on his stomach and their legs intertwined. “Hi, love,” he whispered, immediately holding him closer. “How are you feeling?”
“He’d rather have followed you around than play Quidditch.  Merlin, it was so pathetic.  Then I thought after the war things would get better.  That he’d finally be able to get over his fascination with you.  But boy, was I wrong about that.  ‘Ginny, do you think they’ll take my statement seriously?  His mother saved my life.  He saved my life.  I don’t think he deserves prison, do you?’  Or every time he’d see your photo in the paper.  ‘He looks so different, Ginny.  Do you think he’s getting enough to eat?  They haven’t taken all of his money, have they?’  I was so done with it, in all honesty.  I’ve lost count how many times I told him to just fucking write you if he was so concerned.”
Pansy let out a small laugh and before she could get a word in about that, Draco interrupted.  “Now, hold up.  So, he’s obsessed with me.  That doesn’t mean he wants to—um, take it any further.  There’s no way Harry Potter is even remotely, er, queer.  I’d seen all those photos of you two in the Prophet.  Nothing even suggesting anything else...”
Marching over to her, he gave in and grabbed the plate of cookies.  He looked down to see they were festively decorated with the words HO HO HO.  He shrugged, picking one up and put the corner of it in his mouth.  Instantly the flavors melted on his tongue and he wanted more.  He finished that first cookie rather quickly and was reaching for another when Dean told them, “We’re baking for some Christmas tins we’ll be putting together.  Each of you will get a sampler for Christmas.  I know it’s not the same as a fancy new book or quill, but we wanted to make our presents this year.”
“Sure, why not?”  He led Draco directly to the center of the entrance way.  They were now standing directly below the tree from the second floor and in front of the larger one in the main hall.  Music could be heard from the party, and Harry didn’t hesitate another moment.  He placed his hand on Draco’s waist, and pulled him close.  Draco’s breath caught.
“They’ve been a thing for years and if you haven’t noticed you just haven’t been paying attention all too well,” Dean smirked.  He dipped his quill in the inkwell while both girls gaped at him in astonishment.  “But well, their first date was a couple nights ago.  I’d say it went really well.”
Never mind the fact that when Draco finally got to sleep, he dreamed of Potter sparkling with all those Christmas lights.  If he had nothing else on but the Christmas lights, that was a tiny detail Draco was seriously trying not to dwell on too much.
At this point, Draco was feeling remarkably better.  He could have even reached for the solution himself and applied the rest to his swollen lips.  But why would he bother when Potter was holding his jaw steady, lost in rubbing the solution over his skin.  Down his nose those fingers trailed, to now focus on the line of his cupid’s bow.  Draco’s eyes never left his face.
This was a rare occurrence in that not only were the twins awake, but so were Dean and Seamus.  The boys had some sort of end of term test they were preparing for, and Draco was supposed to be helping them study.  Draco’s involvement consisted of staring blankly at the Christmas tree across the room, while he twirled a spoon in his tea.  He was smiling.  He’d been smiling for days.
“Well, yeah,” Harry’s grin faltered and he lifted a hand to rub awkwardly at the back of his neck.  “If you want to that is.  If you want to still be enemies or rivals or whatever, I guess you can just forget the whole thing...”  He continued to ramble, his eyes leaving Draco’s to look at the floor.  “I mean, I am a little upset because you seem to be getting on with Dean and Seamus ok.  Even Padma seems to really like you.  But I guess I could understand if you didn’t want to be my friend or whatever...”
Grinning that same maddening smile, Harry closed his fingers around the ornament.  “Thanks,” he said.
“Merry Christmas, Malfoy!”  Potter practically shouted after him as Draco slammed his door shut. He leaned against the wall, panting.
“We can’t....not here.  And I have to...oh,” Draco sighed as Harry started to suck a little harder at a spot behind his ear.  It felt so good, and he wanted nothing more than to get lost in this moment with him.  But for some reason the words kept tumbling out of his mouth, “I have...class soon.”
Ok, my brain just wanted to write FUCK a million times in this chapter.  I think I'm going to change the rating on this story LOL.  Woot, two chapters in a day, now I'm only a day behind again.  Let's do this!
Draco flushed, suddenly taken aback by the praise.  He was at a lost on what to say next and mumbled, “Forgive me, this is not something I normally do.  I think the last time I went on a date was back in 5th year and it was a disaster.”
Instead he settled for playing coy.  “Yes well, don’t worry about me Potter.  I’m only interested in your dashing looks.  You practically killed me when you walked out wearing those dress robes, and it’s still taking quite a bit to recover from all that.”
She smiled, “Please, you may call me Rose by now.  I’ve known you since you were in nappies.”  Her warm brown eyes traveled over to Miss Weasley.  “I’m pleased to see a Weasley attend our annual Christmas party.  I seem to recall the last time we’ve had a member of the Weasley family in attendance was over a century ago.  It’s a pleasure to meet you, I’m Mrs. Rose Parkinson.  You can find my husband, Cassius, attending to the guests in the banquet hall.  My daughter Pansy, I believe you’ve met before.  She should be downstairs any moment now.”
your friend?”  For some reason, he couldn’t stop the words from flying out of his mouth.  But he was rather curious about all of it.  What if they had an open relationship or something of the sort?
“Knowing Blaise, of course,” he responds, nodding to a man across the room.  He came over a minute later with a tray and Draco quickly swiped another flute of champagne regardless.
But then, gradually Harry started to pull away.  His grip loosened, his tongue slipping out to gently caress Draco’s lips.  His hand in Draco’s hair came around to cup Draco’s cheek, the pad of his thumb sliding softly along the skin there.  He let out a shaky breath, and Draco felt it linger upon his lips.  “Sorry...that was...”
Dusting off his sleeves, he straightened his glasses and looked over at Draco.  “Oh, I told you to dress comfortably.”
“Oh, I’m afraid that’s all Pansy’s doing.”  He flipped open his menu and was glancing at the selections.  “Not that I’m against this pub or any of the others we’ve been to recently.  It’s just, without Pansy, I’d have probably just stayed locked up in my dorm for the remainder of term.”
Then they were kissing, and it held a sense of urgency and heat much like their first kiss in the alley.  Draco groaned, his head spinning and he had to lean back on the couch.  Harry took that as some sort of invitation and the next moment he was climbing onto Draco’s lap, straddling him.  Draco’s breath left him in a rush.  “Fuck, Harry,” he moaned, wrapping an arm around his neck and pulling him that much closer.
Draco shook his head, picking up the mugs and bringing them over to the sink.  He washed them by hand, his fingers trailing along the word
Dean preened.  Draco rolled his eyes in irritation, waving for him to continue.  “Well, ok.  We’re struggling with our potions research assignment.  You’re easily the best at potions.  Will you help us tonight?”
Pansy rolled her eyes and was about to respond when Draco interrupted her.  “Before you even start, no.  Harry and I haven’t shagged.  I’ve seen his cock, but no.  We haven’t gone all the way.  You all happy now?”
“Oh, what a fucking liar,” another voice cut in.  Draco and Pansy quickly turned to see Ginny grinning at them.  Blaise stood next to her, his spoon of pudding paused halfway up to his face.  “Harry’s such a fucking liar.  Merlin, he’s been hot for you since 6th year...”
“Oh, nothing.  He’s just in la la land ever since he came back from his date with Harry,” Seamus shrugged, pointing at something in their textbook.  Dean leaned over to get a closer look and wrote a note down on his parchment.
“Oi, shush you,” Thomas pushed him back onto the couch.  “Listen, Malfoy.  I just wanted to apologize.  If I’d have known you were in there with Harry, I’d have never walked in like that.  It wasn’t my place and I feel like a right arsehole over the whole thing.”
“Time’s up!”  He bellowed over the class, clapping his hands and all of the parchments on the desks flew into his waiting hands.  Draco bit his lip.  He hadn’t written a conclusion for that last question.  Great.  “Oh and Mr. Malfoy?”  He asked, just as Draco was about to bolt from the classroom.  He tensed, while the rest of the students filed out of the class.
Draco really hoped she was right.  But somehow, he still couldn’t ignore the lingering sense of doom.  What if Harry didn’t want to be Draco’s first?  Draco couldn’t blame him if that was how he’d really feel.  There’s a lot of pressure there, being someone’s first.
“Yeah.” Ron answered first. “We’ll drop Hermione off, then it’s full house at the Weasleys. Well, minus Bill. But Charlie should be home from Romania.”
“That’s alright.” Hal said wryly. “It’s not like I’d been expecting a secret cousin hidden away somewhere.”
Not for the first time, Draco reflected that Purebloods moved about like the mere proximity of wizards who were not as rich, beautiful and magically pure as they were – or Merlin forbid, Muggles – could somehow taint or contaminate them. They found each other in public places, when they had the misfortune of having no choice but to gather there, and huddled together to better bask in their superiority.
“Oh, of course.” Hal realised he’d forgotten Snape was also a witness – and thank Merlin, since he’d arrived in time to stop Lockhart wiping their memories and collecting another stolen exploit for himself, back in June.
When the witch had led them into a (surprisingly cosy) waiting room and left them there with the promise of coming back with tea, Hal stood back a little as he let the Malfoys greet Snape. After a few minutes, however, to his surprise, the professor turned and addressed him directly.
They moved through the rooms easily once more, and by the time Severus had levitated them through the hatch, Albus was casually waiting for them.
He hopped off the stool, grinning widely as the robes pulled themselves from him and went to slot tidily on a rack to the side. Madam Malkin waved her wand again and a little scroll of parchment followed - no doubt bearing Harry’s name. Draco’s robes followed the same route, but he stayed up there. He knew his mother wanted him fitted for dress robes too.
“If that’s the rumour that he’s Bridget Kildare’s new boyfriend, she’s still dating Cassius Warrington.”
Neville started. He received knitted socks from Ron (who swore he wasn’t repurposing), a succulent in a little clay pot from Hermione (as Herbology was his favourite class), what looked like a hamster ball from Anthony (apparently it was for his toad), potion cheat sheets from Draco (as Potions was his least favourite class) and Toblerone from Hal (because wizards may have cool sweets, they didn’t have Toblerone).
“And finally.” The room fell almost silent again. “For wanting to ensure the safety of others by preventing a potential disaster before it happened, and for his courage in facing a frightful enemy…” Hal held his breath as the old man paused for effect, and looked straight at him as he finished. “One hundred points to Harry Potter.”
Now, conveniently, it seemed he was going to have to do both at the same time, same place. How considerate of Mister Potter to go stick himself in a dangerous situation so Severus wouldn’t have to worry about where he was while the Dark Lord got closer to a chance at recovering his former strength.
He turned to smile warmly at him, and Draco was almost distracted enough to notice he’d conveniently omitted the part where he’d gotten bitten by the Basilisk and had almost died.
“This is Luna.” Ginny introduced her companion. “She’s in your House.” She added, glaring at Anthony and Draco, as if somehow that made them responsible for this situation. “And she was being bullied by older Ravenclaws, so I pulled her out.”
Some aspects were… neither good nor bad, maybe, just weird. Hal received a Special Award for Services to the School, that first night when he could get out of bed and the hospital wing – his aunt had already left, but Dumbledore personally came down to share the new with her and Hal that morning before she did (offering her to stay one more night to witness the ceremony, which she declined so she could get back to Ley for his birthday) and he could see the pride in her eyes. It was the only reason the whole thing hadn’t be 100% embarrassment. They had placed the new shiny plaque bearing his name in the Trophy room where Riddle’s one had stood, after
For plot purposes, Divination/Arithmancy/Muggle Studies are held at the same time, and Care/Runes. Guess for their year nobody (but Hermione) was taking classes in a combination that didn’t work with that ;)
“Oh, spooky.” Anthony frowned, as they resumed walking. “So your theory is, what, the castle is trying to tell us something?”
“We need to give Snape, or someone, the Marauder’s Map.” Hal expanded. “So they can find Remus, and maybe no one gets hurt.”
Whispered erupted around them, and Hal spotted Hermione with a hand over her mouth, and the rest of his friends – and the rest of
“You have a phone!” Hal noted enthusiastically as she stopped moving long enough so he could see what she was holding.
“I thought you couldn’t escape that prison.” Hal said tonelessly, as if he was forcing himself to focus on something, anything else than the fact this gaunt, crazy looking man on the front page was one of the only links to his dead parents out there.
When he saw Arthur Weasley at the funeral, presenting his condolences to his mother alongside other colleagues, he wondered why he'd ever thought the Weasley children were unlucky losers. They still had a father. And if Arthur had been hit by that parcel-bomb instead of Lucius, they would have had each other - all staggering seven of them. Draco knew enough to realise that, with the loss of his father, he was losing the chance at a sibling. By the time he was seven years old, Draco had fully started thinking for himself. He could no longer base his beliefs and convictions on the sole fact that his father had said so. His father was dead. Who was to tell him who was worth his time, who to avoid or befriend?
“I’m fine.” Hal waved off her concern. “Spontaneous magic cushioned my fall, or something. I’ll have a few bruises, nothing to write home about. More importantly, I think Quirrell is going after whatever the dog is guarding.”
“Okay then!” Their chaperone exclaimed again, and Hal wondered how she wasn’t exhausted yet from so much enthusiasm. “There you are, plenty of time to board, I’ll let you get on. Have a great time at Hogwarts!”
“And you can?” She raised an unimpressed eyebrow at him. “I’m not one of the Ravenclaws in the room.”
a good flyer. Doesn't take an exciting game to see that. James would have loved it.” He swallowed, his throat clearly tight and a sheen over his eyes. “He'd have loved teaching you. And flying with you. Merlin, you two would probably have been out every weekend. Lily would have gone mental.”
(Draco thought) showing that some of his brain cells were connected. But the damage was already done, and Draco suspected he mirrored the look of surprise he could see on Hal’s face, jaw dropping and eyebrows shooting up.
Sirius, Hal was pleased to see, looked great. He had put on a bit of weight since Hal had last seen him (and certainly since he'd first met him), he was clean-shaven, his hair was cut just right above his shoulders and had a good shine to it. He finally looked healthy, and as young as his actual 35 years. Hal even spotted a few students, mostly girls, do a double take, and while he couldn’t look at his godfather with the same eyes he was looking at, say, Diggory, he could see that he was in fact rather a handsome man.
with the creatures as a younger kid, and it had come to nobody’s surprise when he’d been accepted for a job in a dragon sanctuary before he’d even received his NEWTs results.
“It’s mostly you.” The boy said. “Colin mentioned you wanted to show your family. But he thought he’d start with one of your parents, because… well, he wouldn’t exist without them, you know?”
“Did you get a letter back? My mother wrote to me exactly 34 words. I counted them, that’s how short the letter is.”
It was beautiful, as far as luggage can be, and looked insanely expensive. With that and the aristocratic way in which he spoke, Hal started to see what the boy meant about his “noble” family.
Hal was briefly surprised he knew Draco’s name too, but then he remembered the Malfoys were quite renowned after all, and the Wizarding world really was not that big. Draco’s dad had been a prominent figure in his time, and Draco apparently looked quite a lot like him, the way Hal did his own dad. Draco’s almost-white hair would probably give him away to anyone who knew of the major Wizarding families. Lupin would probably guess Ron was a Weasley too, come to think of it.
“Thank you.” Draco broke the silence, echoing Hal’s words. He reached out and squeezed his wrist briefly. “For shielding us.”
He tried to press forward again, but it only cemented Hal’s conviction that he wasn’t ready for this, not here, not now, not with this guy.
Of the less canonical classes, I suspect Hermione also takes Magical Theory, and Hal is in Art – it might not crop up in this one, but his drawing skills will definitely make further appearances in later years. I had it in my mind when first starting this verse that Hal would be drawing excellent pencil sketches, not sure why, but I’m sticking with it even if it’s not prominent in the plot!
“It’s lovely to meet you, Pan. Come out of the rain.” His mother said immediately, before Anthony could even add or ask anything.
The conversation was cut short as a voice started echoing down the hall, beyond the doors, accompanied by hurried footsteps.
“It was stupid, really.” Hal told him, still hesitant. “He and his twin sister, they… I guess they like playing games. It was like they challenged each other, and they, just, they kissed me, alright?”
giant mansion. Yours is so… classy. Like you can see your family’s proper posh. Centuries-old posh. You people have taste.”
Hal dropped his spoon, which clattered on the table, splashing ice-cream everywhere. Terry actually drew his wand, though he sat back down (looking almost disappointed) when he was satisfied nothing nefarious was going on. Hal was simply gaping at his godfather, who frowned worriedly at him.
Hal snorted. “Guess you have a point.” But he sobered up almost immediately. “The stuff it was saying, Nev. It wanted blood.” He shivered.
Still looking wary, Ron opened the box, and found a nest of paper and rags from which peeked out a small fluffy ball.
“Hal’s been having a hard time, you know.” He said. “He puts on a brave face all the time, but… You know, there are the ones who think he’s the Heir, and there are the ones who call him a hero with superpowers. He hates both. So…”
Draco didn’t let that sting, he knew she was probably right. They tolerated each other, and she’d just opened up to him for some reason, but they weren’t really friends. However, that didn’t mean they couldn’t be.
It had been on the tip of his tongue, so terrifyingly near to being uttered. He’d realised what he was saying, what he was about to say, just in time to fight off the compulsion for honesty. Hal hadn’t seemed to notice anything beyond the dreadful awkwardness of that whole conversation, thank Merlin.
“Oh good, you’re not denying it.” Draco interrupted sharply. “Saves us that hassle. I’m prepared to be generous and not hold it against you, I know it’s a family trait, I remember being on the other end of your oaf of a brother’s foot.”
“This felt different.” Hal insisted a little, because it had. “The way she spoke… and afterwards she looked like she had no idea what had just happened.”
The rest of the album was filled with pictures of him, and while it was all a little creepy and stalker-ish, there were some nice ones that gave a good idea of his life at Hogwarts, and he’d been looking forward to showing them to his aunt and Ley.
“Right?” Hermione took that as him siding with her. “So what if your dad, Hal, and his friends, became Animagi for him?”
“He’s my cousin.” Hal corrected. “And yeah, there were like five Harry’s in our year group a few years ago so him and our friends started calling me Hal, and it worked really well because of the comet.”
He choked, and his aunt immediately gathered him into her arms, where he broke down in exhausted sobs.
And then they’re wondering who Ley is and if he’s also “super cute and, I hear, super rich as well” and Draco turns around:
“Professor, this is only the first meeting.” Neville, who’d paired with another Hufflepuff near Hal and Justin, tried to argue.
“Alright.” Snape pinched the bridge of his nose, taking a deep breath. “I will speak to the Headmaster about this, he may want to see you.”
Hal glanced over at him and couldn’t stop a wry grin from forming on his lips. Growing up with Ley as the kids with more dead parents between them than the rest of their class put together had taught him things were usually much easier if you could find the funny side.
Petunia was starting to wonder what on earth had possessed her, and how she had come to think trying to teach two twelve year-old boys how to cook was a good idea.
Draco looked up, slapping the diary close. He’d arrived at the station early and boarded the train for a quiet space to write, assuming his friends would find him. It seemed Pansy had found him first.
They’d split up for a bit to get Christmas presents for each other and their friends, wanting to keep it a surprise, and Hal had also grabbed some gifts for his aunt (bath bombs that made the entire bathroom look like a planetarium, and a shawl that kept you warm in cold temperatures and pleasantly cool when it was warmer) and for Ley (a selection of wizard sweets, and fireworks that created different flying or galloping animals – though he wasn’t sure how they would get around to using those).
At any rate, Flint did not make any kind of attempts towards any of them, so that was something. But it didn’t make it particularly easier when other students with no personal history with him glared at him, or gave him a wide berth in the corridors.
He tried to make himself small, as he couldn’t help but feel like the portraits along the top of the wall were watching him, judging him, and sharing thoughts about him. He did see one slip into his neighbour’s frame and whisper something in his ear. Did they all knew who he was too, or were they too old to be up to date on current affairs?
“Or that my scar is acting like a sensor for people who don’t like me.” Hal added humourlessly. “Also a bit of a stretch.”
Hal couldn’t say anything, his throat tight, and Black took that as a need to carry on explaining himself.
“What if he had.” Ley insisted, looking sombre. “Either way, he was taking advantage. No one takes advantage of my little brother.”
The station was bustling, commuters moving like they may be willing to trample a child as long as they could be on their way, tourists in the middle not helping matters in the slightest, and Hal found himself grabbing Ley’s hand, whose other arm his aunt was holding firmly, as they made their way through the moving crowd. He had received his train ticket a few days earlier, an old-fashioned piece of card that looked like it was part of a game, alongside a sensible note informing them to look for the DAMSELS representative in King’s Cross between platforms 9 and 10.
Draco had looked into the steely grey-blue eyes of the little cat, and strangely the first thing that popped to his mind was that if he decided one day to become an Animagus (McGonagall’s little stint at the beginning of the year always had effect on many a first year), he’d be a cat.
“I don’t know, actually.” He said eventually. “Like I said, I don’t want to date before fourth year, I don’t know why but I always had that in my mind, so I’ve not really thought about it. I think I’d want to try different things, and see what feels right.”
Draco hadn’t seen Hal since the end of June, when they’d said goodbye in King’s Cross, and he was a little alarmed to realise how much he was missing him. They had written – Draco first, in one of the biggest tragedies of his young life, when he’d had to tell him he couldn’t come to his birthday party,
Hal liked the sound of that. Ley and him had always wanted to be badass detectives or police officers, and the wizarding version just sounded that much cooler.
, Hal thought – and thankfully, even in his tired state, did not say out loud. He simply blinked at the professor, unwilling to interrupt.
Hal nodded. “How did you know…” He wasn’t sure how to finish that sentence. What was going on? What to do?
But Hagrid simply looked sad, and grave, and he put the kettle back down, and let himself drop onto his seat – which somehow miraculously did not break under his weight.
They made their way down, and it quickly became clear which direction to go as the sound of voices and music filled the air. At least, Hal presumed it was meant to be music, when they got there and saw nobody was re-enacting a medieval witch burning, which was what it sounded like.
“Your aunt has been informed.” The professor told Hal. “She has been invited to visit you, should she wish to.”
Hal talked about his aunt and Ley, about his friends at school, and to a mix of horror, delight and pride from Sirius, about facing off Voldemort in his various manifestations. Sirius talked about his own time at Hogwarts – Hermione was right, it was mostly mischief – and carefully did not talk about his time in Azkaban. They both skirted around the topic of whether or not Remus (with how much Sirius used his first name, Hal had started thinking of his professor as such, much inconveniently) was an Animagus or a werewolf or neither.
Hal had spoken to Sirius, briefly. His godfather was being questioned at the DMLE, ‘just a precaution’ apparently, but he'd sneaked his his mirror and had managed to quickly contact Hal when he’d been allowed to use the toilet.
“The other one is Draco Malfoy. The blondest one. You know, he was in the magazine as well, in that list of the best bachelors.”
It didn’t seem to do anything to lessen Oliver’s intensity, but it did mean the rest of the team tended to look at each other and try not to laugh during his speech, rather than nod gravely and run through tactics in their heads. Not that the Ravenclaws weren’t a threat – but the style of play was always more relaxed, and less prone to injury than playing Slytherin or even Hufflepuff (who had a competitive streak a mile long rooted in not wanting to disappoint each other). It made Oliver’s
Draco didn’t answer, he only gave a small, noncommittal shrug, and Hal noticed the dark circles beneath his eyes, and started kicking himself. Draco wouldn’t have had to tell him if he’d bloody
“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked. For all her brilliance, she didn’t grasp chess any better than Hal did.
She held out a hand to prevent any outward reaction, her eyes slightly downcast so she couldn’t see whatever their faces were doing.
Hal went last has he had been thoroughly distracted by Little John Silver playing with all the wrapping paper, but he was delighted to find a wand holster to attach to his belt from Anthony, a book of Quidditch rules and moves from Ron, a transportable cat bed from Draco that was about the size of a mango once folded up, a tin of Sleekeazy Hair Potion from Neville (Hal had to laugh at that one) and a copy of Shakespeare’s
Two minutes later, she was covered in rashes and struggling to breathe. Thankfully her fellow Ravenclaws reacted quickly – although including, unhelpfully, a Muggle-born sat next to her who was shouting some nonsense about epic pens? Draco decided to ignore that completely as he urgently escorted her to the infirmary.
“Isn’t that a nice conundrum?” Riddle carried on. “By the time your spells can touch me, it’ll probably be too late for dear Draco.”
“Of course, of course.” Fudge nodded gravely. “This is why I am here on official business, you children will be quite safe. Nothing to worry about.”
“Get well soon, Mister Potter.” He said instead – probably starting to see there wasn’t an opportunity for a long, insightful conversation here with Hal in this state. “I look forward to talking to you again soon.”
“Yes.” He said, hoping he could keep it simple without too many questions. “We had just faced a fully grown Basilisk.”
“By getting rid of all the Muggles, of course.” Pan shrugged like it was obvious. “So only deserving wizards will remain and magic can be pure again.”
It seemed plausible enough, Hal wasn’t a bad liar when he really wanted to fob someone off, though he didn’t do it often, mostly just when he felt embarrassed or wanted to talk his way out of something. But Draco knew him well, and he wasn’t buying it, so he pushed.
“He’s right.” Draco agreed. “Your mom was Muggleborn.” He gave Hal a tight smile, before turning back to the rest of the group. “So if Hal had Slytherin blood, James Potter would have had it too.”
They had to go as their five minutes were up, and Pomfrey gently showed them the door. McGonagall escorted them back to the Ravenclaw common room first, dropping off Anthony and Draco, then to Gryffindor. The mood in the common room was subdued, the few groups of scattered students who were still around having clearly heard the news. They shot Neville, Ron and Hal looks between pity and encouragement, and the three of them didn’t have to discuss it or even look at each other to decide they’d rather go upstairs.
And Draco hadn’t been sorted in Slytherin! Dora was excited about that – it showed the kid was growing to be his own person, as she had no doubt he
“Aw.” Myrtle’s plaintive voice greeted them as she gave them a disappointed look. “You’re not dead, then.”
He wasn’t in Slytherin. That was all he could think, though it wasn’t sinking in. His entire short- and medium-term expectations were getting completely reshuffled, and he could hardly wrap his head around it. Oh Merlin, he was his family’s new Sirius. Had his father still been alive, he would have
No, Hal thought immediately. While he’d been looking at boys, he’d been looking at girls too, and his thoughts about them were the same. Just as he had felt over the summer faced with the twins, he couldn’t decide, and it seemed to extend not just to them two, but to their whole genders. If Myrtle had been right, if Hal even remembered that correctly and it wasn’t just the dream feeding him weird things, Draco wasn’t interested in girls at all.
He gave a wide twirl of his wand, and bir… bats, actually, flew out and around the room. A few students shrieked, but the little creatures were quite harmless and most of them settled somewhere in the ceiling almost immediately, as Lockhart started miming wading through the jungle.
. Everything was new, fantastic and overwhelming, and the only thing that put a damper on Hal’s excitement was every time he turned around to comment on something, and Ley wasn’t there. He supposed he’d get used to it in no time, but he missed not sharing this with his cousin. They’d been sharing everything for so long, he felt a bit like he was missing a limb.
Draco knew better than to retort to any of that – at the moment the boys were pissed off, and they would be looking for any excuse to get into a fight. He tried to simply walk away, but Flint shoved him.
Hermione had suggested doing a “Secret Santa” – whatever that was – but in the end they had decided to all buy gifts for everyone else, something small, but they all thought it would be more fun to have a heap of presents going around. Draco saw it as a challenge: would he have gotten to know his new friends well enough, in barely even four months, to get them something they’d like? Would he find out they knew him well enough to get him something
“I don’t really want-” Hal tried, but was interrupted by a cough that shook his entire body. “I don’t really want to sleep.” He managed, sounding like he’s swallowed gravel. It felt like it too.
“See.” The DAMSEL beamed. “You have a buddy already, you won’t be lost. And I have just seen a lovely boy called Justin through. But let me tell you a secret.” She leaned forward and dropped her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “Everyone is lost their first few days of school, doesn’t matter how much you already know or don’t!”
Oliver’s pep talk at half-time reminded Hal of a disaster movie – you’d think the Apocalypse was upon them. At the end of it, he approached him personally and grabbed both his shoulders.
“Speculation, really.” Ron volunteered, his curiosity prevailing over his bewilderment. “The sources are a bit dodgy on what happened the night You-Know-Who was defeated, but they say the Killing Curse rebounded and left a scar on Har-... your forehead.”
When between a mouthful of eggs and a sip of her coffee, his mother suggested a trip to Diagon Alley to get
The most stink eye he got was from Marcus Flint, and Hal could guess it was for entirely different reasons. It was actually hard to tell, when the older boy glared at him from a distance, if he was planning some kind of revenge, or if he was somehow scared of him, either because he’d been taken down a peg by Hal’s promise that he
He did, a little. He remembered it being a lot lonelier, and cold, like he wasn’t shown much love, like his aunt and uncle only touched him to perfunctorily tend to his basic needs or remove him from their way, and like Ley was barely there at all. He was glad he didn’t have any concrete memories, really.
Emboldened by the way the troll didn’t seem to know where to look and kept following the sparks with its whole head looking incredibly stupid, Hal and Draco carried on firing all the spells and hexes they could think of, most of them harmless, while Anthony was giving the storeroom door his all. It held strong, true to form – Snape’s wards after all were as legendary as his scowl.
“My mother’s always loved France.” He said by way of an explanation. “We spent a lot of holidays in different parts of the country. I started learning early.”
He was right – they all reacted like they’d been hit by a stinging hex and left the common room like a dragon was after them, Hal still in his kit, which caused Pince to almost throw him out. She only let him in after confirming, upon a very close and uncomfortable inspection, that there was no mud to be found anywhere on his person.
Sat in a quiet corner, they talked about how Hal’s magic was decidedly powerful, having been told the account of how Hal had escaped and finding it rather amazing he could still perform ‘accidental’ magic at his age, wondering exactly when this stopped being considered something children naturally did and became an impressive and unusual skill to have.
) who had killed his parents, and disintegrated himself in the process of trying to kill him too. He had heard rumours that the rebounding spell hadn’t entirely killed Voldemort – guess those had been right.
He did not like to ‘pull rank’ as a matter of course, but he could still wield some serious Pureblood influence on someone from a wannabee family like the Bulstrodes, and he could certainly put the fear of Merlin into Millie, thank you very much.
They all nodded, assuring Pan that they were cool with it. Although he was rather distracted, and perhaps not giving the news full consideration, Hal genuinely thought it was nice to know exactly who you are, and what to do about it. He wasn’t sure what the magical community thought of transgender people, but he guessed it couldn’t be much easier than in the Muggle world – especially not for a Pureblood like Pansy, whose entire upbringing seemed to be based on bigotry. But, he thought, looking between her and Draco with a smile, maybe the next generation was changing that already, one free spirit at a time.
Hal snorted, and dashed off. The rest of them finished their breakfast before joining the flow of students heading for the Quidditch pitch.
“That could explain the voice.” Hal conceded. “But not the petrified cat or the writing on the wall.”
“Rather than thinking my father’s best friend, my own godfather, betrayed my parents and got them killed? I want to.” Hal admitted.
“Come on.” Hal leaned in to whisper to him as Hermione stepped away. “Let’s get out while she’s distracted.”
“Now, now.” He laughed airily, pocketing the wands. “Let’s not injure ourselves.” He looked them over before adding. “Well, any further. I have no wish to hurt you.” He gave them a contrite look. “But what a great story this will make! Me, rescuing you foolish children who had been taken by the beast! Saving the day! Slaying the monster! Saving your lives
Hal frowned, and Fred tapped the map with a finger and explained. “We saw him on the map, Peter Pettigrew, ages ago. But we thought it was a glitch.”
He did not want to be confronted by idiot Gilderoy Lockhart pointing a wand at their heads even as he smiled his brightest smile down on them, where they were still sprawled on the floor. Hal had inched closer and his fingers were just a breath away from Draco’s, so Draco covered them. He didn’t think Hal would read anything into that, and if he did, Draco didn’t care. They both needed any warmth they could get right now, even if it meant leeching it off each other. Hal’s hand was covered in blood and grime, but Draco decided to focus on the way it leaned into his, rather than think about the no-doubt gruesome tale he’d hear about it later.
However, once it became clear that Lockhart was so busy talking about himself that he only barely glanced at the sheets Hal was handing him before signing them, Hal started having a lot more fun (and volunteered to put the signed letters into envelope and seal them, so Lockhart wouldn’t be able to check them again, because he wasn’t an idiot).
He didn’t want to ask Anthony, because he would have to admit things were a little worse than what he’d led him to believe when he’d asked. And he didn’t want to ask the others, because he would have to tell them about it altogether. But he also really, really didn’t want to stay.
He decided he wasn’t going to accuse the teacher of stopping him before, but he wasn’t going to let him stop him this time again. Even if it turned into a Dementor, he wouldn’t faint this time – he’d face it. He had to prove to himself that he could face it.
“Because it’s my story and I’ve not given Pansy permission to repeat it to you guys?” Blaise answered Anthony, grinning like he knew exactly how much his mere presence was riling him up, and basking in the satisfaction. “Now do you want to hear it or not?”
He tried to think of a similar celebrity to wrap his head around how and why people were so interested in his every move, but he couldn’t come up with anyone, apart from maybe royalty or like, David Beckham’s children, but they hadn’t done anything for themselves. Not that Hal had, in his own opinion – but it was different in that he was famous for himself, not because his parents had been anyone.
The result was that factions of students had seemingly decided it was their job to protect Hal, while others avoided him like the plague.
And the castle, whether it had its own magical will or obeyed the schemes of its headmaster, certainly felt like it had wanted him to be there – the stairs leading them here, doors that were either open or barely needed you to think the spell to open them, these ridiculous challenges… Maybe it was wishful thinking, but it felt unlikely he would have gotten that far if he was going to just, get a curse thrown in his face by an angry little man and die. So he drunk the potion, and he walked through the flames, and he looked at his new surroundings.
“You already knew Black was one of your parents’ mates and that he was in prison, but with this happening… I thought maybe you’d want to hear the full story from a friend.” Draco explained. “Rather than read it in the paper. Merlin knows the
“No, Hogsmead is a strictly Wizarding village.” One of the Aurors answered. “It is possible the suspect avoided using her wand on purpose, but that would imply a degree of premeditation that does not match Mister Black’s account of the attack. Resorting to physical means is very rare for experienced wizards and witches. We think she might be a Squib.”
He didn’t mind admitting it – it was one less thing she could potentially use against him if she found it in her to talk back.
“Hey.” He said more softly, putting a hand on Hal’s shoulder so he’d look up. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable.”
“Yes, but…” Draco hesitate, casting a glance towards the various Weasleys, but nobody was really paying attention to them. “Hal, they don’t have a lot of money.” He revealed. “Several course books like that, expensive as they are? It’ll make a big difference for them.”
“I know, it’s ridiculous.” Draco admitted. “I only started realising that after my father died, you know. I probably wouldn’t be… well, anything like this, if he hadn’t died. I probably would be in Slytherin, and quite proudly so.”
“Let me briefly give you a little bit of context.” The Professor addressed all of them long-sufferingly. “Mister Potter here, apparently unbeknownst to himself, just spoke Parseltongue, which is the language of snakes.”
of the chocolate that his aunt Marge had sent him for his birthday (almost two months late, which was rather like her), in one go, and it had been a very, very large box. His mom had only chastised him. He’d been ill over dinner, but they’d still put it down to the chocolate.
“Fair enough.” Snape admitted. “As long as you’ll come to me if anything happens that could get more out of hands?”
He’d also felt stressed about trying out for the Quidditch team, which, combined with everything else, could have explained why he far from played his best. He still made the team, just avout, but a fifth year was given the main Seeker position, and Draco was appointed as reserve. He wasn’t happy about it, but he had to admit it was fair. He had to pull himself together.
“No, it was alright actually.” Draco smiled. “I think he’ll be nicer. I was just thinking that Hal has already grown quite a bit since I first met him.”
Ley leaned forward to look at it, clearly having immediately sensed his cousin’s distress, going by the look of concern on his face and the way he probably unconsciously squared his shoulders a little as if to shield Hal.
They both gave him a look of absolute terror, and ran off promptly, glancing behind them as if to check he wasn’t following or drawing his wand on them.
Hermione walked up to the table and caught the boy’s attention, obviously eager to do her part if there was anything she could do to help, and they started discussing if the charms that had been in place the previous year (when all students had to be escorted due to the attacks) could easily be reactivated, and would they reach the professors if they needed to call for backup.
Hal snorted, feeling some history there – he’d gotten the impression, from Sirius’ Hogwarts tale, that Remus had been a bit like the Hermione of their group.
“I’m glad you’re okay, my darling.” She then narrowed her eyes. “But if you and Ley weren’t going to drive me up the walls if you stayed indoors, you would be grounded for the entire summer.”
Ley, who had been fully briefed by Hal (Draco wondered if there was anything Hal didn’t tell him), was explaining the situation to Dora in stage whispers. She made approving noises, her hair (probably unconsciously, she’d explained to them how it happened sometimes based on her emotions) turning striped: blue, pink and white. It was a good thing they weren’t in a Muggle area right now.
Looking at the drawing, Ley saw a large group of people. He recognised himself, and Hal, and his mom, and his aunt Lily and a man who looked a lot like Hal whom he supposed was his dad.
“Magical beasts can live for a long time.” Hermione pointed out. “It could very well be the same monster.”
“Yeah, it clearly looks like it. Because, don’t think I’d not spotted the one on your jaw too. Harry said you told him you fell, but-”
The name of Potter had been spoken with scorn in his household for as long as his father had been alive, and not at all after that. His mother had carefully removed herself from anything she called ‘political’. You know, like the murder of people most of their current acquaintances had called friends.
“I was never mad at you.” Ron said. “But no, I’m not mad at them either. I get it. It’s a brother thing.”
“I don’t see anyone else doing anything to figure this out or stop it.” Anthony insisted angrily, still in a hushed voice. He brushed furiously at his eyes, and his voice broke when he added: “She’s so cold.”
, and all around it were various other hair, skin and nail potions all promising to make any witch or wizard well-groomed and beautiful.
“No, alright, I’m sorry.” Pan whispered back. “I didn’t mean to say that. But you can’t force me to tell them either.”
They talked about school for a bit, what electives the boys had picked, until they all became conscious that while listening patiently and with some interest, the Muggle among them must feel a little left out.
It was a little of an exaggeration when it came to Hufflepuff, where he was friendly as best with a couple of them, and probably even more when it came to Slytherin although he could distantly count Pan and Blaise. He wasn’t sure what to make of either of them yet, if he was honest. But anyway, the kid didn’t need to know that.
“I get that you’re stressed out.” She said. “But don’t lash out on us. Least of all Hal. All he wants to do is help.”
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the dark wizard trying to take over the world at the time, tried to murder a whole family.” Ron put it simply indeed. “There’s this curse that kills, but somehow when he cast it on the baby it… bounced back. And killed him instead. And the war ended.”
He sprung up from the common room armchair he was stroppily lounging in, suddenly struck by an idea. His godfather! He could ask Severus if he could stay with him, say he just wanted to get a chance to spend time with him outside of school. He only had to mention the fact that Narcissa would be away, he didn’t need any other reason than that, it wouldn’t be suspicious since he was family.
Hal’s life had gotten weirder, which was a spectacular feat in his opinion. Ever since the news about Colin Creevey, the atmosphere had been tense, and there were countless theories as to what was going on, was the Chamber of Secrets real, what monster was in it, and who the Heir could be.
“Well, no, I mean.” She babbled, flustered. “Not exactly, but there isn’t any harm in getting some information, is there. Anyway. What I was saying was. James Potter is really highly ranked in a lot of them, he was brilliant. And Lily Evans was best in her year in Charms for OWLs
“Oh, I’m on the team!” Hal realised he had completely forgotten to mention it in his letters. He was going to, but then figured he would need to explain Quidditch, and what a Seeker was, and reassure his aunt that broomsticks were quite safe really, and he’d decided to come back to that later, and hadn’t remembered.
Fred and George had a different theory, or at least an additional one, which was that Oliver did not feel
Book one of this rewrite is almost complete, so while I can’t promise I will get to the end of rewriting all 7 books (I have a full-time job, it’ll take years!), this one for certain will not be abandoned.
They were huddled up in the library, creating an odd looking group of green, blue and red. Madam Pince had given them an appreciative look, like they had taken it upon themselves to actively promote House unity, rather than just being a random group of normal schoolchildren. Something was so wrong with the House system, Hal thought, probably for the hundredth time.
“I won’t lie and say it’s not nice.” She admitted. “But I’m not into girls. I just hope we can be friends.”
When they managed to corner him between two classes, Draco thought at least he’d been carrying money on him, so maybe this would be the end of it. He gave Flint the galleons, and made his escape. And tripped over a leg one of them stuck out.
Hal heaved up his book bag and shoved his hands in his pockets, sulking, but did not try to run away from Draco at least. They let the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs trickle out of the greenhouse, walking a few steps, tentatively at first, then naturally falling into one of the paths they’d trekked so many times the previous year, chatting away and practising spells, enjoying the outdoors. In that moment, Draco missed that so much it was physically painful.
Sirius shrugged. “Not really. What mattered to me was for my name to be cleared, and that’s done. If Peter can be convicted, that’d be nice too, otherwise I might go and commit actual murder.”
The look Lupin gave him was a little bit like he’d just opened a treasure chest full of gold – wonderment and disbelief.
Draco broke into a run, his blood turning cold at the fear he could hear in the voice of whoever had just called Hal’s name. As he skid around the corner, he saw Rolf Scamander, rushing to the foot of the stairs, and Draco thought his heart was going to stop when he spotted a small body curled at the bottom of the steps, the mess of dark hair unmistakable. It did stutter, and restart, as Hal rolled on his back, eyes shut tightly closed in a grimace of pain.
Draco sighed. She was right (what else was new), he had seen himself how Hal had gotten irritable when Draco had try to make a point about how Black not being harmful didn’t mean he harmless. He still didn’t like it.
, he almost expected the disgusting face to say in its best villain voice, but he didn’t need that to abruptly be keenly aware that he was looking at the man (
She straightened back up and looked at Petunia and the other parents reassuringly. “I can take it from here.”
Hermione flushed slightly, like she still did every time her outstanding reasoning in figuring out the Basilisk and Chamber of Secrets was mentioned.
“So in order to do that… I guess, what would you want us to be?” He blushed as he finished asking the question.
He allowed a small pause, and silence actually fell as the school waited with bated breath to hear any snippet of ‘official’ information about the whole showdown.
He still felt a bit odd about that, and he didn’t want any special favours or anything, but having been selected against the rules for his skill… that was nice. He wanted to be proud of that. He explained the friendly game – he had to go into a little detail about Quidditch, such as the fact that it implied flying on broomsticks – and Fred and George convincing their head of house, and the other player quitting…
“Oh, yeah.” Hal nodded. “I’m not allowed anything strenuous for a few weeks – magic won’t be a problem but my aunt said we’ll take it easy in July anyway.”
They had to say goodbye to Anthony and Draco so they wouldn’t get in trouble going back to their common room too late, and then to Hermione as she headed to the girls’ dormitory. Up in the boys’, Hal spotted one more present at the foot of his bed. When all the other boys had denied it was from any of them, he opened it looking for a note. There was one.
“Why me.” Hal complained one evening, exhausted by another day of fending off supporters and opponents in equal measures.
Draco had been a little wary, at first, that the speculations would lead Hal to start wondering about the rest of their group and who they each might have a crush on, but it quickly became clear he had no interest in steering away from what, Draco suspected, they both saw as a safe subject of conversation. Kept them away from all the uncomfortable ones, and it really was good fun.
“I cannot believe.” Anthony shook his head, looking between Hal and Draco. “That after last year, you are willingly planning to spend Halloween in the dungeons.”
He followed the same gestures Lockhart had done, but he didn’t expect the puff of powdery smoke that rose up when he stepped in, and made him cough and splutter something like “Hogwa-hrt-tch-Derhk-fish!”
“School records.” She said breathily. “I was looking up what the highest scores for OWLs and NEWTs had ever been, and…”
Hermione tried to explain all of it, which in Hal’s opinion only muddied the waters. It was Dean – who was as Muggle-born in education as Hal was, when it boiled down to it – who eventually intervened. They were sat together in the common room, during a time engineered by McGonagall so that older students would be available to answer questions about the new subjects that they had to chose. Hermione had gone around asking a lot of people and had made notes, so the rest of them had decided they probably didn’t need to.
“The creature!” Hal could barely contain his excitement. “I said – ‘Do they think I’ll set a snake on them or something’ – it makes sense!”
, and the only reason Hal was deterred from screaming I AM TWELVE YOU PSYCHO was that, given the content of the song, he suspected someone even younger to have sent it.
This one's a longer one! Some more exposition, and then some of the plot kicks off. Some headcannons/liberties about magic and spells along the way.
“Well.” George piped up – Hal could tell it was him because at some point during the game, the twins had shouted each other’s names before getting into a quick mud fight, and he remembered which one had had the truest aim. George’s forehead was still smeared. “The altitude, speed and angle weren’t of professional-class proportions, sure.”
Hal had gone back to the mirror only once, to draw it. He didn’t want to let himself get stuck staring into the friendly faces of the family that would have been – he knew it wasn’t real. Getting wistful about seeing his mom and dad seemed ungrateful to the woman who had raised him like a son. Laughing at Violet’s stubborn pout felt like distancing himself from the boy who was in every way like his brother. And while he knew the Weasley and Longbottom families had been close to the Potters, would he have been friends with Hermione, Draco, Anthony, had he not been orphaned?
“Hal.” She told him once they were out, seriously but not reproachfully. “It was very good of you to intervene for that girl, but this isn’t how you deal with a bully.”
Hal didn’t let him finish speaking before he cast a jinx at him, but the red light of the spell went right through him.
To make it worse, a steady drizzle started after ten minutes, and the players were soon soaked to the bone, unable to benefit from the shielding spells placed on the stands for the spectators. After a painful three hours, though Gryffindor had put up as much of a fight as they could, the Hufflepuff Seeker ended the game.
Draco was startled into a laugh, rolled his eyes, and followed him, resolving to write to his mother. He hoped telling her about his amazing friends would make her feel better seeing he was as happy as he could be.
They came through to the next room, which was filled with giant dragonflies. At least, that was what it looked like – upon closer inspection…
Hal snorted loudly, and it was only Draco’s education that prevented him from doing the same. Unfortunately, it seemed to cause the scraping noise ahead to move with more intent in their direction. Hal pointed to one of the doors on the side of the corridor, but they only had time to take one step. The scuffing, the grunting, the
“You were late for class, Mister Potter.” He said a tad more coldly, though still smiling – as if it hadn’t been his responsibility to get him here on time. “Now, we wouldn’t want Gryffindor to lose points so early in the year, would we?”
“Is Harry here?” Draco heard Sirius say, causing Lupin’s already worried face to crease into something deeper. “Is Hal- Tell me he’s here, tell me-”
And his mother, he thought. He did not really want to think about how she would react. He knew she loved him, and probably still would. But he had a feeling she also would be disappointed, worried maybe, and sad. And he had no intention of telling her, not in the near future at least.
Ravenclaws whooped and clapped, but the most calculating among them sagged in disappointment, well aware that although current points put them on top, two more Gryffindors in the celebrated group hadn’t received their rewards yet. And sure enough, the headmaster went on.
anything to defeat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. But he had survived a curse that nobody else had ever survived. She couldn’t be the only one wondering if he had special powers, if his magic was somehow stronger, or different, to that of any other known wizard since maybe Merlin himself, who had been reputed to be immortal. Some rumours said he was still around. Some rumours said he was reincarnated in a certain Boy Who Lived.
He swallowed around the sudden lump in his throat, and unfolded the bundle of cloth he found in the paper. It was a cloak, the thick, soft fabric shimmering in the candlelight of the dorm. Clearly an adult size, he could probably throw it over his whole head and still have it pool up on the floor, but he wrapped it around his shoulders regardless to try it on.
“But if you want to meet me in my office on Saturday.” Lupin carried on. “Instead of focusing on the spell that makes Boggarts go away… maybe I can teach you the one against Dementors.”
She gave him a long, calculating look, and Hal realised he still had one hand holding his head – covering his scar, where the pain had lingered. He dropped it hastily, but the damage was already done.
“One, like you.” Neville answered. “It happened two days later. After… after you…” He took a breath, swallowed. “The night You-Know-Who went after your family, and after he, he… disappeared. His followers had no idea what had happened or where he was so they… Tried to get information, out of people they thought would know.” He wiped his eyes, and Hal realised they’d welled up with tears. “My parents were Aurors.” He added. Hal had heard that word thrown around, he knew it was like the wizarding police. “They were captured and tortured.”
The dog was bloody massive, and even though it was apparently asleep, Draco felt the blood drain from his face.
Here’s that photo of Lily <3 http://diffusionph.cccommunication.biz/jpgok/RepGR/415/415326_19.jpg (Jenna Thiam)
“Alright, so maybe he’s always been in rubbish health and it’s stopped him from going through the Animagus process?” Neville surmised.
“You know Luna Lovegood?” Draco dropped a register or two, but maintained all the icy haughtiness he knew to muster in his voice.
Draco was rubbing at his neck, looking unamused, but he was the one to point at the door at the other side of the room – the one and only door in the room.
Draco, and everyone else around them, knew he wasn’t really asking. There was an authority in his voice that could only make you think the words
“I think I would, too.” She echoed honestly. “And that doesn’t mean there’s a better and a worse version. It doesn’t mean we would have been happier, or less happy. Only one thing would have been exactly the same.”
Draco’s strangled voice still managed to be sarky as he mumbled something about being a little tied up, but Neville seemed to manage to get one of his hands free, and shouted the spell. The effect was immediate, the plant… shrieking? and shrivelling back to the sides of the room.
The room was horrifying. It was covered, from floor to ceiling, with pictures of him, articles about him, scribbles of his name surrounded by hearts, drawings of his face (not very good ones either), and items associated to him: a Gryffindor scarf, pairs of glasses on the shelves, Quidditch memorabilia, books, newspapers and magazines in which Hal was pretty sure he or his parents would be mentioned.
“I disliked your father.” Snape admitted plainly. “And I was biased against your physical resemblance to him. But.” He looked like he was implying that if Hal repeated any of this to anyone, he would murder him. “You are not your father. And you are my godson’s friend.” He paused before he added, a little softer. “And Lily was my friend, once upon a time.”
They both cracked up, and started laughing so hard they actually had to stop for breath, doubled over and leaning on each other for support. Once their hilarity had subsided, and they carried on walking towards the castle, Draco looked back thoughtfully at the (still faintly smoking) hut.
Hal blinked at Draco, standing at his bedside, and briefly wondered confusedly where the rest of his family had gone.
I have a feeling some of you may start to ship Anthony and Pan, but I must disclose there is no plan to get them romantically involved! I love their friendship though, and this will definitely keep on growing :) and who knows, sometimes you can’t predict where your own characters might take you!
His legs locked and he fell forward, tried to spin and landed hard on his shoulder and the side of his face.
He really would have to take a moment, at some point, to ask himself why exactly he was so defensive of Hal as a person, more so than for the rest of his friends. But in response, Hermione’s eyes widened.
“Okay, that sounds like a lot.” Hal breathed. He turned to Draco slightly helplessly. “Is that a lot?”
As for Care, it had begun when he had found Fire salamanders at the back of the rose garden one day, crawling all over the fire pit where the gardener had been burning autumn leaves, and he had been utterly fascinated. And quite distraught when they had all died once the fire had gone out, not that he had admitted that to anyone. He’d wanted to know more about the creatures – and any creatures – ever since.
Hal thought everyone else would still be at the feast, but when he reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, there was someone standing there. He’d probably just gotten there, seeing as she was sleeping, a three-quarter eaten box of pumpkin-shaped chocolates on her lap – Hal wondered why portraits went through the motions like that. Surely they couldn’t really eat anything, nor did they have any need to sleep.
Well, that was the dilemma. He could stay. On his own, since all his friends would be going home to their loving families, while
He shook his head, smiling to himself at the memory of that poor fish Ley had won at the funfair. It had turned out you could not replicate cryogenics on goldfish by putting them in the freezer. Who would have guessed? It hadn’t seemed obvious when they were seven, at any rate.
“For being ready to face a troll, and for getting a wounded friend out of the line of fire, twenty points to Anthony Goldstein.”
” Anthony breathed emphatically when Ron turned around after stuffing his winter coat into the overhead rack. “What are you
He didn’t mean that to be addressed to the Hat specifically, but well, the thing was inside his mind.
She seemed to understand anyway. “Okay.” She said softly. “You know if you change your mind, you can just call me, alright?”
“I t-trust your exams went well.” Quirrell added – Hal thought it sounded rehearsed, and simply nodded and smiled uncomfortably. “I won’t k-keep you, P-Potter.”
Hal and Draco had taken full advantage of magic meaning they could come back from holidays with twice as much stuff as he’d left with to buy an unreasonable amount of gifts and treats to bring back to their friends, including a box of French Every Flavour Beans they had to buy again after they’d sampled them and ended up eating the whole thing (Ley had helped with that).
Things got a little hazy from there, but Draco could tell he was hit by a series of jinxes, and that he just needed to hold on and wait for it to be over. At one point, one of the four boys got a little overeager, and the bottom of Flint’s cloak caught fire. He put it out, but he looked furious.
Hal could only blink at the man, taken by surprise, but he supposed if the woman who’d taken him had been a witch, or at least by all indications was involved with magic, and with Hogwarts and Hogsmead being so close, it made sense for Wizards to be posted within the local Muggle police force.
Thanks for reading, comments will definitely reach me even if I don’t answer or post for a while, so feel free to leave plenty! Love to all.
With that, Hal was dismissed, and the usher saw him out again. The lady from the witness suite had brought Draco up, they exchanged a smile as the two staff swapped them over, and he went back down with her as Draco went into the courtroom.
Hal swallowed back that this wasn’t Jurassic Park – it wouldn’t have helped, and he didn’t know if a mountain troll did have anything in common with a T-rex. It didn’t seem very likely, and the reference would most likely have been lost on his friends either way.
Here’s the translation of the conversation in the ice cream place for those don’t speak French, or didn’t jump right on GT ;)
She glared at the books in question as if they had personally offended her. Ever since the events on Halloween night, she had been relentlessly going through every book she could think of that might refer to it.
“No strings attached.” Fred interrupted him. “Honestly, we want you to have it for all the reasons we said, but it’s not forward payment for anything. We hope you can benefit from it, the way we did, or for bigger things.” He shrugged. “No pressure.”
place to be for a lot of kids , and Draco had no doubt it would only intensify as they got older and bolder and learnt more spells.
At the bottom of the staircase leading to where the Defence office was perched, he spotted Anthony’s cousin staring at the wall. They had spoken to the boy a few times, throughout the year, and he always seemed to be on a different planet.
“It rings a bell, actually.” Draco said uncomfortably. “I’ve heard that story. But I thought it was a monster he left in the Chamber.”
“Probably because she thought I might be interested.” Hermione answered, trying to make it sound like she was supremely unaffected by the prospect.
He pointed his wand at them again. Hal shifted, his hand slipping from underneath Draco’s, only to turn and grip it better.
“Can we take a picture!” Louise screamed, louder than she had excepted going by how she then clasped both hands over her mouth.
“Albeit in a certainly twisted way, Mister Potter.” She commented eventually, sounding bemused. “You are a very lucky boy.”
“We should have asked if I could sleep over.” Hal said with a pout at the end of the day, hating that it was over, as he got ready to use the Portkey again.
“Why would someone take something out of a secure vault in Gringotts and bring it to a school for safekeeping?” Anthony insisted.
The buzz of excitement resumed as they docked and started making their way to the castle. It wasn’t a very long walk, and soon enough they were in front of the doors of the Great Hall being lectured by the Deputy Headmistress – she was explaining, really, but her resting face made everything she said sound like she was telling you off. Draco tuned out slightly, and as they were led into the Hall, he started people-watching.
“Do you see how easily they are carrying these?” She pointed at a couple of students lifting great big trunks on top of the other against the window of their compartment. “There’s a spell that makes things feather-light. I very much want to learn how to do that. There is also a spell that can make things go really small so you can fit them in your bag, you know like that scene in
He purposefully mentioned Draco’s and Anthony’s parents rather than his friends themselves, thinking that would probably reassure Snape more than arrangements between children.
“Luna, I swear to Merlin.” Ginny said between gritted teeth, pinching the bridge of her nose. “You can’t let people do that!”
He tried to remember if he’d heard or read anything about phoenix tears – he vaguely though Snape might have mentioned it in relation to poison antidotes – but he was drained and unable to get his thoughts in order. It hardly seemed to matter, anyway. If he wasn’t dying anymore, then he needed to get himself and Draco out of here before something else happened. For all he knew, the Chamber was spelled to self-destruct or something.
He’d chatted and laughed with Harry Potter, a boy he could only have dreamed of being friends with considering both their heritage. He couldn’t say having ran into him on the train was lucky – he’d pretty much kept walking down the carriages until he’d reached him. But the way the boy had taken him in stride was… unexpected. Not surprising, because Harry didn’t know anything about their world, or the Malfoy family, so why would he be prejudiced against Draco. But unexpected, maybe because Draco had prepared himself for the worst (a lonely year at school where he didn’t fit with his house, but still had to bear the stigma of being a Slytherin, unable to really connect with kids from other houses – the prejudices would be there, this time).
Hal still wished he could do something. Maybe he’d be a Healer when he grew up. Petunia worked in an office, and that didn’t appeal to him at all. Ley wanted to be a pilot – or something that involved him having his own private jet, it wasn’t always clear. With a jolt, Hal peeled himself off from his aunt to ask her what he’d suddenly realised he didn’t know.
His own future was meant to be eloping to Asia at nineteen years old with a married woman and adopting four Vietnamese orphans.
“I’m with my aunt, but she’s getting a cup of tea with the DAMSELS lady. I think she was a bit overwhelmed.”
“We have to trust him to make his own mistakes.” Hermione told him supportively, visibly sharing his opinion though they both kept quiet about it.
Draco had spoken to her only a few times, since the train after Christmas, but that was enough times that he knew she didn’t like to talk about the bullying that was still going on at regular intervals, though she also didn’t like to lie about it either (unlike himself, Draco was always uncomfortably reminded. Whenever he thought about it, he always determined to tell someone immediately if Flint ever tried anything again). Her way around that was to outdo herself being particularly cryptic and evasive.
hadn’t done that.” Ron retorted venomously. “Seriously, what in the name of Merlin was that? He wasn’t even anywhere near the Snitch!”
Finally, Hal’s draw was Ron, and he was rather pleased with what he’d gotten him; he’d been inspired by Ley getting overly excited watching his favourite football team on the telly, and had wondered how much live or recorded Quidditch wizards were able to enjoy. After some digging, he’d found out that you could buy play-by-play picture books of each game – if you made the pages flip themselves quickly, it was like a film and you could watch the whole match, but you could otherwise linger on each action. The photographs were moving as was customary, and zooming in at all the interesting moments and details. Hal had found one for a recent Chudley Cannons game he knew Ron was gutted to have missed.
It wasn’t just that he had made a promise to his friends – he still thought he could just start pouring his heart out and tell them everything that crossed his mind. But to be fair, it would do him well to remember he didn’t have to struggle with strong and confusing emotions alone. As helpful as Tom had been to him, he wasn’t his only option. Draco had
He flipped it over before emotion overwhelmed him, and turned to the rest of the box. There was a key, he wondered what it opened, and a letter. With another deep breath, he opened it.
– which surprisingly, given how they both doubled over laughing, came from neither Fred nor George, but actually Percy.
She was probably right, Hal thought. He knew there were Healers in the Wizarding world, which was proof not everyone could just wave their wand and make it all better. Even the fact that they had a school infirmary – it wasn’t just about doing a spell, or administering a potion, otherwise the teachers could do it, and they wouldn’t need Madam Pomfrey.
She remembered the one magical friend of Lily’s she had met as a child, and that seemed more than enough. She knew the friends Lily and James had made at school could not possibly all have been as unpleasant as this boy, but she wasn’t interested enough to seek them out.
The atmosphere for Ravenclaw games always seemed to be less intense than it was when other teams were playing each other, like they were more interested in the
something similar was up with him. He did know about the Felix Rosier story. He’d probably put two and two together. And strangely, probably due to the fact he could see how Severus was handling this with Pan, he found that he didn’t mind. He felt like this was a safe zone, like he wouldn’t be judged for his orientation.
He felt the sudden urgent need to find Hermione and apologise, or give her a hug, or just check she was okay.
aristocrats. If the way Draco held himself at the table was any indication, his education had been quite strict in that sense, at any rate.
She hopped off the bench and walked away, just like that. It took the boys a second to pick up their jaws and follow her, catching her up as she settled back down at the Gryffindor table. They sat in stunned silence for another minute, until she looked up.
Hal took the cloak off, and Dean proceeded to take the piss out of Seamus, as Neville and Ron came to take a closer look, both looking flabbergasted.
Anthony gave him an encouraging look – so far, Pan had been all over trying to make his presence as helpful and the least disruptive possible, helping around the house and offering all kinds of ways to ‘compensate’ for his imposition, despite the Goldstein’s assurance that it was their pleasure, so Anthony thought that was a nice change.
He wasn’t provoking him, Hal reasoned to himself. He was simply biding his time, until reinforcement arrived. This has been the point after all, to slow Quirrell down. Even though from here, it looked like he had stalled all by himself.
“You bloody fools.” Severus snarled, but Draco knew him well enough to hear that there was more worry than anger in his voice.
Draco still didn’t understand why Pan was so intent on getting him to confess his feelings to Hal, but he had to admit, this actually was proper motivation if there was any. He needed to beat Hal. He could beat Hal.
“Harry, come up!” Lockhart did not seem to care about anything else but his little performance. “Let me show you – I won’t hurt you of course, there is nothing to worry about! – let me show you how I defeated the great sorcerer, when, towering over me-”
He was reminded of Colin. Did families like his, like this one in front of them, really only exist thanks to him? He hoped not. He hoped, if he hadn’t destroyed Voldemort in a fluke, that people like his parents and the resistance they were part of would have fought him back and won.
Pan opened his mouth, then closed it, and shook his head. “Actually, I’d rather not comment on that.”
Hal rolled his eyes. “It’s just a colour. And it’s not like it’s going to be a statement, out in Surrey.”
“Oh, my dear Harry.” He focused his attention back on him. “When I learnt that you were stranded, of course, I immediately volunteered to assist.”
And it worried him, because what if Hal didn’t miss him as much either? What he wasn’t even thinking about him? He had his cousin, he was surely having a much more exciting summer. He’d probably barely even noticed Draco’s absence at his party, since everyone else was there. His heart probably didn’t beat faster, louder, when he thought about Draco, the way Draco’s did when he thought about Hal.
He had just been speculating about what had happened to Harry Potter next, presuming he would surely be at Hogwarts this year as he thought he was their age, and Hal didn’t think he could face coming clean just yet.
Tom had been very patient with him, considering, and he had helped him admit to himself that what he felt for Hal was not simply friendship. It was too consuming, verging on slightly obsessive, and he certainly didn’t feel this way about any of his other friends.
“Who do we speak to?” Neville asked. “The logical teacher would be DADA, I suppose, but I think we can all agree that in this case it’ll be our very last choice.”
“Oh.” Hal startled – both at the statement, and at the fact it was so rare to hear someone say the name, he’d started thinking of it as taboo himself.
He chuckled, walking over to the music player and fiddled with it some more.  “Oh, it’s on the auxiliary setting.”  Flicking another switch, he was able to pop open the thing and took out the existing disc.  He slipped it into a paper folder and then turned towards Draco, his hand outstretched.  “Here, let me,” he practically whispered, his hand hesitant as his fingers brushed over Draco’s hand that held the disc.
Either way, the only way for Draco to find out how Harry would feel about it would be to tell him.  Draco inhaled deeply, trying to calm his nerves.  He stood up from his spot at the table and made his way back to his room.  He forced himself to avoid looking at his bed, because even thinking about what happened there made his head spin and his stomach lurch.  Shaking his head, he stared at his wardrobe and began to pick out an outfit for tonight’s date with Harry.
He stared sadly out his bedroom window, admiring the ice crystals accumulating upon the glass.  A few moments later, he pulled his wand out and pointed it at the icicles.  Swishing his wand in a swirling pattern, he watched in fascination as the ice formed intricate shapes.  If he squinted just the right way, he could make out a spider, or maybe a hummingbird.  It reminded him of his childhood, looking at the abstract shapes of the clouds within the sky.
“Yes,” Draco agreed, looking away from the couple in question and trying to find the nearest waiter.
Thankfully, after their first drinks the conversation shifted away from Draco and his poor health.  Pansy’s life had remained mostly unchanged after the war.  The Parkinson’s were fortunate to have remained mostly neutral during Voldemort’s rise to power.  As such, she was able to keep up with her lavish lifestyle of living in large beautiful homes, with more wealth than she knew what to do with.  Draco envied her in that respect, not so much the mansion living and expensive clothes—but simply the security wealth gave a person.  He missed the feeling of being able to travel to wherever he wished, simply because he wanted to go.  He missed the feeling of buying things, just for the sake of having it.  Now if he needed something, he had to consider whether it was something he needed right that moment or if it was something he could wait till his next paycheck.  He was slowly adjusting to his new circumstances, but at times it was still difficult.
“Mate,” he sighed.  “Let us help you, please.”  Draco blinked in surprise.  It’d been so long since anyone had called him
“Fuck,” Draco groaned, outside the dorm.  He had slurred the wrong Floo address and had to make the embarrassing trek from the Ministry back to the training dormitory.  Now here he was, practically midnight, standing outside in the cold.  The brisk air stung his cheeks, and if he hadn’t drunk all those shots he might have felt even slightly more sober.  But it did nothing, the world still spun around him.  He leaned against the door, his face pressing into the wreath hanging there.
“In a way,” she said simply, closing the distance between them by wrapping her arms around his waist.  “You just need to let it go.  Stop punishing yourself for what you did while we were kids.  We can’t go back and change the way things happened—but we can go forward.  I’m proud of what you’ve done so far, even knowing you have had little choice.  You’ll make a fine Auror someday.”
Draco couldn’t believe his luck.  All he wanted to do was finish his morning jog, perhaps grab a cup of coffee on his way back to get a shower.  But the frantic patronus of his stealth and tracking professor put that plan on hold.  “Shit,” he swore, running out of the park—the slick of snow licking up his trainers.  How could he have forgotten?  It was Monday, he had an exam on Monday!
“Ugh, don’t get me started on all that.  He’s a terror to live with, the whole lot of them.  They are loud, they are messy, they are carrying on and playing music all hours of the night.  Finnigan and Thomas are always making out on the couch.  They have their own room for fuck’s sake.”
Draco blinked, his mind having a hard time processing what he’d just said.  He gaped silently and was just about to respond when Harry quickly cut in.  “Listen, if it’s too soon, that’s fine too.  I’ve just thought about this and I don’t think I can handle the idea of you with another person right now.  I mean, I realize it’s pretty common to just date around, or get to know several people at once.  But Draco, I guess—what I’m trying to say is I don’t need to do that.  I think I’ve found what I’m looking for.  So, if you need more—”
Nothing could have prepared Harry for the image he was assaulted with.  Draco Malfoy was situated in such a position where he was hunched over, his wrists tied to ankles on either side, long sinuous legs spread wide and inviting.  His skin traveled for miles, pale milky flesh glowing in the subdued candlelight.  His back muscles clenching from the restrained position of his arms, sweat trailing down his spine and further down.  Jesus Christ.
“Yes well, Slytherin darling.”  She dug around in her purse and dropped a hefty amount of cash on the table.  “As pleasant as this late lunch was, I think it’s about time to go.  I’m meeting Blaise later for some sort of double date.”
Smirking, Harry tugged gently on the toy and pulled it free.  At once he was transfixed on Malfoy’s loosened slick lubed hole.  Without thinking, he dug his thumbs in and pressed his face against him.  Malfoy actually bounced above him in alarm, whining.  He couldn’t help it now, licking his red and swollen rim, he’d tasted of a dessert Harry wanted to indulge completely in.  At any other time, Harry would see the irony in that he was finally kissing Malfoy’s arse after all these years.  But he didn’t care.  Gripping both globes of Malfoy’s glorious arse, Harry stretched him further apart, completely devouring him.  “Merlin, I’m going to...” Malfoy began to pant, his legs clenching tight and almost trapping Harry inside.
Draco was ready to hex everyone.  “I hate every single one of you,” he groaned, feeling his face warm.
“Aurors always wear their proper uniform while on duty at the Ministry.  I’d have the same expectations for my students as well,” he looked pointedly at Draco’s sweatpants and muddy trainers.
“Yes,” Draco agreed.  “It was rather unexpected though.  Did you...”  He paused, considering how best to ask what he wanted next.  “Did you mean what you wrote?  About going there together someday?”
“Right,” he smirked.  They made their way outside and stood underneath the awning, where he leaned in and kissed her cheek.  “Take care of yourself.”
Draco had imagined their first kiss would be slow, hesitant, sweet even.  It was anything but that.  Harry kissed Draco like he was a man starved, lips and tongue bordering on brutal.  He plunged his tongue deep inside, and Draco answered that with a loud moan and parted his lips further.  Harry’s grip on his jumper tightened, and he’d brought his other hand up to tangle in Draco’s hair and around the back of his head.  He was pulling him in even closer, and Draco was so thankful for the wall at his back.  He didn’t think he could stand very well with this attack of Harry’s lips on his.
Before Draco could continue on that train of thought, their waiter came to get their orders in.  Draco ordered the roast, Harry the fish and chips.  They got a bottle of wine for the table as well, and Harry smiled charmingly as Draco questioned what bottles were available and finally settling on a Chardonnay.  “It’d go well with your fish,” he explained to Harry.  “I prefer champagne with fried foods, but maybe this will still be a nice balance for both our dishes.”
She rolled her eyes to the ceiling.  “Merlin, you’re fucking hopeless.  Just fucking tell Potter already.  It’s driving me around the twist.”
“You’re not even halfway done with your report!  Do you want to be an Auror or not?”  Draco huffed, irritation rising.
“Obviously,” Harry agreed.  Then he took a larger pull from his glass, clearly enjoying the selection Draco had chosen.  After he’d swallowed, he allowed himself to ask, “Just...how long have you known you were interested in other men, Malfoy?”
He had to close his eyes.  It was absolute torture.  But eventually Harry began to take him deep and Draco had nothing else to think of but the tight heat of Harry’s mouth wrapped around him.  He started out slow and steady, the pressure almost too much.  He could feel his body strung tight and clenching, trying to hold it all back.  There’d be no way Harry wouldn’t take the piss if Draco finished so quickly.  Draco shouldn‘t have been surprised.  It was just another of Harry’s many talents.  Who knew the boy who lived was a natural cocksucker?  Draco tried not to let the jealous thoughts come forward.  But he was naturally curious as to whom he’d been practicing on.  Clearly this wasn’t his first time.
He took a shuddering breath, trying to calm his racing heart.  When he finally felt like he had everything under control he muttered, “Then show me what you can do, Potter.”
“Oh bugger off, Draco.  These smell too amazing,” then she took a ginger bite into her lemon square and moaned softly.  “Guys, I need your recipe,” she whispered after she’d devoured half of it.
Humming thoughtfully, he tilted his head in consideration.  After a few minutes passed and their meals were finally brought over, Harry answered, “I guess I have a thing for Quidditch players?”  He took a bite of his fish and moaned softly.  “No, not really.  I think I’m more attracted to just certain people.  And well,” he paused, frowning.  “I’ve had to be really careful after the war.  It seems like too many people are only interested in me because I saved everybody, and not well, interested in me for
“I’ll clean you up,” Harry smiled as his chest heaved.  He waited till he caught his breath and then made to move down Draco once more.
After Draco watched Potter give his statement in court on his behalf, Draco ran even more.  In the mornings, he’d run past the few remaining peacocks.  They’d startle as he jogged on past, and any other time of his life perhaps he would have been amused at that.  But his mind strayed to Potter and just
.  He couldn’t help it, he gave one more lingering kiss along his length and followed the trail, taking time to lick teasingly along his testicles—then further back.  Draco’s breath immediately hitched, and he lay mostly motionless, except for his legs which seemed to tremble on either side of Harry’s face.  He didn’t waste another moment, and licked a stripe along his entrance.
Word had travelled fast about the confrontation from last night.  It was the next morning when Draco was slipping on his jacket and practically out the door when he was stopped by Padma Patil.  “We heard what happened, Draco,” she started.
“What?” He asked, dumbfounded.  “How in Merlin’s beard do you see that?  He wrote that he sends cards to all his friends.”
She shrugged, grabbing a biscuit and taking a nibble.  “No, you don’t.  But it just seemed sort of obvious with how you two were making faces at each other at the party.  You were absolutely besotted, dear.”
In order to prolong this, Harry decided to tease him for a while.  If this was to be the one and only time they’d fuck, Harry was going to make sure Malfoy would never forget it.  Harry would gladly ruin him for anyone else.  Smirking, he moved his cock away from Malfoy’s back and replaced it with his lips.  He nipped harshly along his skin, marveling at how the creamy flesh bloomed under his teeth.  Draco gasped, his muscles tightening everywhere Harry placed rough kisses down his back.  He tasted amazing, smelled like sex and sweat and it was all so very intoxicating.  He was inching closer and closer to where he smelled the sweetest and Harry wanted nothing more than to bury himself there.
“Um, yes.  But so does Hermione.  Lives here, I mean,” His smile turned nervous.  “She’s not here now though.  On holiday with her parents.  And um, I told Ron not to come over tonight.  That I had company over and that I’d see him tomorrow...”
It was as if he was on autopilot.  Draco reached blindly into his wallet and pulled out plenty of that Muggle paper money and set it on the table.  Then he stood up, Harry mirroring his actions.  Draco didn’t hesitate, and as they were walking out of there, he put his hand on Harry’s back.  Immediately Harry leaned into his touch, and Draco resisted the urge to grab the back of his shirt and pull him close.
“Hey, Draco, you in there?”  He recognized the voice as Dean Thomas.  Draco quirked his brow in confusion, before he pulled the door open.
Harry hadn’t spared them a second glance, and kept sucking at the peppermint.  But he paused abruptly when he noticed Draco’s expression.  His grey eyes were flickering with want and intent and so much heat, that Harry had to stifle a groan.  He slipped the peppermint out from his lips and dipped it back into his cup.
Harry chuckled, and started to pull himself up.  Draco wasn’t having that.  He pushed him again, this time at his shoulders.  Harry fell back in a loud thump.  Then before he could recover, Draco leaped.  He swiftly slipped an arm around Harry’s waist, holding him in place.  Harry started to lift his legs for better leverage, only to have Draco press his knee down on one calf, the other hand holding his thigh down.  “You give?”  he asked, panting.
“Well I wasn’t going to just barge into his room!  I was hoping to catch him out here,” Draco frowned, considering.  What if Potter didn’t even come out of his room till he was leaving?  Draco might have to actually knock on his room, and his stomach lurched at that idea.  The last time he was in that room—ugh, Draco wanted to think about it, but he also didn’t.
He shut his eyes, his whole body clenching from the feel of Potter touching his back.  His hand was warm, traveling up and down Draco’s spine and driving him completely mental.  Draco needed to get out of there before things got worse.  He was seriously considering another coughing fit to see what Potter would do next.  Would he notice if Draco was faking it?
“Mate, it’s fine.  Harry isn’t going to be bothered by that.  He really likes you,” Dean smiled, reassuringly.
Harry, who was staring at him reverently and in wonder.  Draco felt his already present blush travel down his neck, his cock twitching under Harry’s gaze.  He sucked in a sharp breath, falling to his knees in front of Draco.  He grabbed Draco’s waist, pulling him to the edge of the couch.  Draco automatically spread his legs which allowed Harry to settle in the space between.  Then Harry hadn’t hesitated another moment and leaned over to kiss Draco’s inner thigh.  Draco jerked in surprise, and Harry chuckled.  “Trust you to look absolutely fucking perfect,” Harry inhaled, “and you smell just as good.”
He slunk out of his bedroom, darting his face around the corner to make sure Weasley had truly left.  It seemed to be the case and he breathed deeply, willing his heart rate to calm.  Palms sweating, he rubbed them upon his pants nervously before he made his way to Potter’s door.  He knocked once, twice, was about to do it a third time when Harry yanked the door open.
“I know,” Harry smiled encouragingly.  “I guess what I’m trying to say in all this, Draco, is that I’m wanting there to be more.  I’d like a repeat of the other night, and preferably many more nights just like it.  If you weren’t that important to me, I wouldn’t even bother with telling Ron—especially given I know he‘s not going to react in the best of ways.  But I think it’ll be worth it.  I want you, Draco.  I think I’ve wanted you for quite a while, and I just had no idea.”
Why did he say that last bit again?  Draco had no idea, but it resulted in both Dean and Seamus laughing hysterically on the couch.  Draco grumbled, made his way to his room and slammed the door shut.  “FUCK YOU GUYS,” he shouted through the wall.
“Yeah, yeah,” he said behind a baroque room divider.  He’d been hidden behind there for ages and Draco was just about to get up and go downstairs.
He felt ridiculous.  Here he was, the night of his date, staring at himself in front of his bedroom mirror.  Pansy had nailed down every detail from the way he should style his hair to the socks and shoes he should wear.  Now he hardly recognized himself and he felt horribly under dressed.  He looked as if he was about to go to the store to pick up some groceries for the week, not go on a
Pansy smirked, looking back and forth between them.  Blaise sputtered, which caused both Ginny and Draco to look at him suddenly.  “Oh, for Merlin’s sakes,” Pansy cut in.  “It was 5th year and they just shared a couple of blowies in the Prefects bathroom.  Everyone in Slytherin knew about it.”
