The blonde boy opened his mouth to say that he’d not been in any state to notice

Ron looked at Harry up and down, just shy of leering. The gaze made Harry shiver in revulsion a little bit. “And who’re you again?”
"Dobby was
“Oh, sweet-
But, as all things do, the night passed into the morning, and with morning came sunlight. Sunlight, which as it is wont to do, stabbed cleanly through the minute space in the curtains straight into Harry Potter’s face. Jerking his head backward and opening his eyes resulted in him cursing and getting himself into the shower and ready for his morning meditation. Since it was so late, Harry decided to take his alone time outside.
looking forward to seeing.
Harry followed her instructions, and she was right. It took him about thirty minutes, but he found it. It felt like a little ball of dark pink energy that was radiating heat like a furnace.
***HCTHtM***
“Sod off, mate.” Harry responded lightly, taking the proffered limb with a grin.
“Now, Harry.” She started, squeezing his hands to let him know she was still there. “Now carefully close your hands around your Allure. Let as little light out as possible.” As an example, she guided the boy’s hands into a tight ball, as if he were trying to keep a small bug inside the space between his hands.
Harry thought absently as he was nudged by Ron.
After the brown haired girl turned her attention toward Harry, Ginny ran her hand along his side, from armpit to hip. “What is this?” She asked, pointing out the slight curves, where normally there was only a straight profile.
Amos held his watch up and counted down. “5...4...3...2...1…” When Cedric’s father reached zero, the old boot glowed blue, and Harry felt the hook feeling behind his navel again, before being swept away into a maelstrom of blurred and distorted images.
"Did sir just call Winky Dobby?" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Harry’s little friend’s had been, a tinny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected, though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf, that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.
***HCTHtM***
Harry smiled at his godfather’s letter, shaking his head at Sirius’ way of writing. He seemed like a teenager himself.
Once the two muggle-raised had finished their exploration of the tent, Harry was subjected to potentially the most mortifying physical inspection he’d ever been a part of. Ginny had his shirt off in a trice, and was turning him around while poking and prodding, and Hermione was looking at him pensively as if he were a puzzle she couldn’t quite sort out.
Harry scoffed at Hedwig and gave an amused grin at her disgruntlement. He then got back on task, looking at the title of the book. ‘The Marauder’s Guide to Becoming an Animagus in Six Months or Less!’ Harry thought it was a bit childish to add the exclamation point at the end, but to each their own. Harry, though excited to go through it, decided to see what Professor Lupin’s letter said before going any further with the book.
“Young lady, have you no decency?”
A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything and everyone had an aura of strange golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as could be from up here, and Harry knew the grass was likely trimmed and made to look presentable just before the public was admitted.
he thought, flagging her down and stage whispering her name so as not to be heard down the hallway.
After she followed him back in, Hermione engulfed Harry into a hug, then pulled back to look at his state. The first thing she noticed when looking at his face was that he looked completely exhausted. Then she took stock of his facial features. Blinking a couple times, she tilted her head then raked her eyes over the rest of Harry’s form. She pursed her lips and sighed, tousling her already bushy hair into absolute madness.
When Harry sat back up, it was to the annoying sight of a grinning Ginny and a Hermione that looked at him like he was mentally compromised. Ginny, like she was a cat that had cornered a particularly juicy mouse, sauntered up to the embarrassed teenager and sat beside him. “Haaaarryyyy,” she whined exaggeratedly, putting her head on his shoulder, “I thought you were crushing on Bill!”
The younger girl’s eyes were closed, a gentle smile on her face. Her hair, blonde as the elder’s, was tied back into a very loose braid. Her face was delicate, with moderately high cheekbones, a soft curve of the jaw, and a cute, slightly turned up nose. With long eyelashes and full lips, she cut an adorable and classically feminine figure. Her body was well formed, with a generous bust, narrow waist, and moderately wide hips.
***HCTHtM***
“Harry, you and Miss Granger have been excused from class this afternoon and tomorrow. I am sure your friend Ronald will bring your assignments to you. I will also inform your professors about this development.”
“Pet.” Vernon began suddenly, “It seems the Potter boy fancies himself an athlete. Probably the only thing productive he’s done in his life. Did your sister ever tell you about this game?”
As he looked back on all of this, Harry eventually got stuck thinking about his godfather. Sirius Black; James and Lily’s friend, escaped innocent convict, prankster, and illegal animagus. Really, it was this last point that Harry was stuck on.
Harry felt a little hope. This was going much better already than he thought it would. “Well, uncle. I’ve got an invite to a sports event from the ma… uh, of the type my sort would go to, and my friend Ron’s family has agreed to host me for the summer if you’re alright with it.” The boy took a second to gauge Vernon’s interest. Seeing him not entirely for it yet, Harry decided to go for broke.
“Ughhhh…
The remaining two weeks actually kind of concerned Harry, because he’d reached a point where his hair was almost completely blonde, and Hermione was starting to ask questions.
“So Hermione has a new crush, eh?” Harry smirked, ready to needle her like he had with Lockheart.
Harry, leery of showing off such obvious magic, but not wanting to ruin what little goodwill he’d been able to gain today, straddled his broom, set his feet in the stirrups, settled back against the cushioning charm, and lifted off a couple feet into the air. As always, the feeling of weightlessness brought a smile to his face.
“There’s no possible way that…” Harry trailed off, gawking at himself in the mirror. At first glance, he didn’t notice much besides the fact his hair was now fully platinum blonde and miraculously laying down flat. He’d known it’d gotten long enough to need to tied back, but it was still weird to see. Once he started taking note of his body though, he saw that he did indeed have slight curves. A light flaring of the hips and a barely pinched waist. Turning to view his profile, Harry sighed in defeat at what he knew was coming.
Harry was wary now, but it was ingrained in him to answer his uncle’s questions, so he did. In as normal terms as he possibly could.
“Oh wow,” he said. “This’ll certainly take some getting used to.”
“Whenever you’re done then…” Harry muttered, a little miffed.
As promised, twenty minutes later, all the Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were safely ensconced in the Burrow, Molly stress-cooking furiously, and all the kids finally succumbing to the stress now that the adrenaline was gone. The teens were dropping left and right, dragging themselves back into their rooms to pass out on their beds.
After he’d told the entire tale, Albus Dumbledore, he of the many names and titles, leant back in his chair and chuckled lightly in amusement. “As always, the ingenuity of your parents and their friends astounds me.”
“Found it.” He said, focussing on keeping his attention on the little ball.
“Sir, are you thinking Harry somehow messed up the process?” Hermione piped up, interested in the goings on.
“You’ve gotten noticeably shorter and more slender, your hips are definitely wider, now that I look at it, and… not to put too fine a point on it Harry, but it’s almost like you have… well, breasts.”she breathed deeply and exhaled slowly through her nose before stating reluctantly, “It looks like you’re growing breasts, Harry.” The boy in question reflexively put his arm over his chest, self-conscious about the point she’d made.
“Hi Ron, it’s me.”
Harry groaned, letting his head fall backward, then rolled his eyes and tried to focus on whatever it was that Dumbledore was saying about the Goblet of Fire. It really was unfortunate that when he focused in that direction, the magical artifact seemed to reach out for him.
girly. I’d definitely mistake you for a girl if I didn’t already know you.”
The dressing-down Hermione had watched Harry get was objectively impressive, especially coming from such a reserved woman. It covered everything from dress code, to respecting oneself as a woman, to managing time properly concerning study and sleep. The talking-to she’d gotten afterward left her feeling sad she’d disappointed her Professor. Hermione had lost her house 5 points for her misdemeanor.
The Great Hall eventually filled up, and lunch was served. Ron dropped into the spot across from Hermione and asked where Harry was, while looking starstruck at Fleur and, mortifyingly, Harry. The boy in question hung his head in disappointment, and the two girls started giggling madly.
Putting the letter aside, Harry picked up the book and sat down on his bed absently. Hedwig took insult to this, having almost been squished, and flew over to her perch. She tucked her head under her wing, and unceremoniously fell asleep.
Harry shrugged. “I mean, it’s not like it’s something I’m gonna have to deal with forever, right? All I have to do is figure out how to turn back, and it’ll be fine.”
put on your shirt!”
““Never!”” The boys sang together, causing both Harry and Ron to groan good naturedly.
weirder," said Harry fervently. He then reached into the satchel he’d brought, pulling out one of his sets of omnioculars. Seeing the second pair, Harry remembered suddenly why he’d gotten them in the first place.
Fact: His animagus form was a veela.
Ignoring other students was second nature by now, and without too much delay, Harry had made his way up to the owlery. A few moments after that, Hedwig was winging her way to her mystery destination.
“HERMIONE!
Barring the difficulty Harry and Hermione had with holding a conversation with Bill, the rest of dinner went swimmingly. Harry caught up with everyone, Ginny was opening up to him, Mrs. Weasley had stuffed him to bursting (“You’re always so skinny, dear”), and sleeping arrangements were made (Harry would be bunking with Ginny and Hermione, at the command of Mrs. Weasley).
the chores for the rest of the week I’m here. They want to come pick me up on Saturday.” Harry waited with bated breath for his uncle’s verdict.
“Aughgh! Hedwig!” Harry cried out, somewhat hysterically, from the floor. “Some effing warning! Please!”
“Innocent-”
“That was a-”
“Potter. Finish eating, then go get into your uniform and bring down your… broomstick.” Harry’s eyes bugged out and he shoveled the remaining food into his mouth before sprinting up to his room to get into his quidditch robes. He could hear Dudley complaining about the attention Harry was getting.
“Go on then,” he stated. “Show me how you sit on the blasted thing.”
He kind of felt like his mind was slowly disconnecting from his body. He couldn’t really deal with this right now. ‘
Harry had no answer to this question, so he just shrugged with his face screwed up in a hopeless grin. “Looks like it’s just another one of those weird ‘Harry Potter’ things.”
over you.”
“Uhh.” Harry let out unconsciously, baffled that Vernon would ask anything about it at all. “It’s uhh, called quidditch.” The boy bounced lightly on the balls of his feet, slightly uncomfortable, but never turning down a chance to talk about his favorite sport.
The rest of the day passed pretty uneventfully, with Harry buying a black and scarlet, short-sleeved Bulgaria jersey that reached partway down his thighs, two sets of omnioculars (Ron was sure to want a pair), and various small quidditch themed tchotchkes. The Weasley clan and guests converged back on their campsite that evening to gorge on sausages and some snacks Ron’s mother had included in a basket filled with fruit, bread, and miscellaneous other baked goods. After dinner, the children were too tired from a day of exercise and excitement to stay awake much longer, so they collectively decided to call it a night.

“Girls! Harry! There’s been an assault by death eaters across the clearing. Stay inside and keep your wands out. I’ve fitted the tent with an anti-flame charm, but it never hurts to be safe.” And with that, the three were left alone again, huddled together in their pyjamas and with their wands out
Madam Pomfrey tutted and levelled a glare at Harry that was intense enough to have him blush lightly. “Turn back, Mr. Potter? I take it you know the cause of your… condition, then?”
***HCTHtM***
Helping his friend to catch her breath caused Harry to miss a lot of what Arther had started saying to the other kids, but he gathered that Cedric Diggory and his father Amos were present, and boy, was that man proud of his son. Amos was going on about how Cdric had beaten Harry at quidditch last year, and honestly, the man was right. Even if Harry had gotten messed up by the dementors, Cedric still made the catch. After some more catching up between the two men, and between Cedric and the other kids, everyone was gathered around the old boot Mr. Diggory had found.
“Harry, we’re in the hospital wing.” She said slowly. “ Madam Pomfrey is getting you a Wide-eye potion to wake you up because you haven’t been responsive to either professors McGonagall or Moody.”
***HCTHtM***
Once the game was finished (which Ireland won, to Harry’s minor disappointment) and they’d dodged the other occupants of the top box, Draco was instructed by his father to escort his companion back to her family, then to take his portkey home.
Transfiguration had gone spectacularly terrible for poor Harry, even with Hermione helping out. Harry couldn’t get the spell they were practicing (changing a mouse to a rat) to work at all, and lost a total of 20 points from the deputy headmistress for falling asleep in class.
Regardless of Percy, Harry’s birthday was a blast. He got some good presents. Mostly clothing and replacement items for his broom polishing kit. Nothing really too interesting. The first two weeks after his birthday however, had Harry showing some real progress with his animagus form. He’d managed to shrink himself (His form seemed to stand roughly 5ft tall, because for the life of him, Harry could not make himself even one fraction of an inch smaller), and to give his hair platinum blonde highlights. Though when he got his hair to about half blonde, his chest started aching for some reason.
Petunia, seemingly coming to a decision, scowled. “Set a place for yourself tonight, boy.” She ordered, then swept out of the kitchen to begin the process of tearing Dudley away from his video games. Harry, struck again by the oddness of today, obeyed his aunt.
*****
“Can you turn back at all?” The boy nodded silently.
“Well, I cannot go into much detail about it to someone who is not a veela, but the basics are as follows…”
***HCTHtM***
He’d dozed for a couple hours when he heard the portrait hole open. Harry snapped back to awareness, hoping the person coming through would be uninclined to ask questions. He levered himself to his feet as the shadow became a person, and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw it was Hermione.
After doing this for an hour, Harry headed back inside and up to Ginny’ room. He gave a brief knock and entered once he’d received acknowledgement. The boy’s trunk was in the only uncluttered corner of the room, alongside a cot with a thick blanket and fluffy pillow. Unfortunately for him though, both Ginny and Hermione were there, and they’d fixed knowing grins on their faces.
Harry James Potter was a naturally curious thirteen year old. He also seemed to be blessed by Tyche with the most absurd amount of luck. This combination got Harry into (and out of) many a sticky situation. It was almost as if he was led by a beacon into danger, then led by the guiding hand of fate back out.
*****
“Alright everyone it’s about that time.” Mr. Weasley announced. “Make sure you’ve got a firm touch on the portkey, or you’ll get left behind.”
As the week went by, Harry found himself ordered to make himself protein heavy breakfasts, and to go on runs through the neighborhood (“An athlete’s got to build muscle and endurance boy, see to it while you’re away”). He also was made to lift light weights in the garage, taken to an optometrist to be fitted for contact lenses, and to sporting goods and department stores to get what Vernon called ‘superior quality gloves’, some high quality spotting goggles, and what Vernon described as ‘respectable clothing for a budding sportsman’, but really meant a new, fitted wardrobe’.
Honestly, it was kind of a relief.
The group finally made it to the stairs and started climbing, and climbing, and climbing. At last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and smack dab between the goal posts. About twenty purple chairs with gold embroidery stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined.
Tall, lithe, and well-dressed in a trendy vest, a button-down shirt, comfortable jeans, and dragonhide boots, with a dragon fang earring hanging from his left lobe, the eldest son of the Weasleys was… fit. It seemed the only way to describe him. Harry blushed deeply, and hid his face behind his hands. Hermione giggled at Harry, knowing exactly what the problem was, and Ron groaned out “Ugh… Merlin save me, not
Fleur moved closer to Harry and took his hands. She closed her eyes, and Harry felt the warm aura exuding from Fleur recede until it was naught but a blip on his metaphorical radar. He frowned at the loss.
Harry gawked at Ginny, feeling vaguely insulted. “She’s sort of right though, Harry.” Hermione piped up from behind him. The half-dressed boy spun around, a  light expression of betrayal on his face. His best friend’s eyes were roving his body, unfazed and unrepentant.
***HCTHtM***
Please look forward to more chapters at sporadic intervals and lengths of content. I generally write anywhere between 5 and 15k chapters, but average between 6 and 10k. It's weird on my brain and I'm sorry if my writing is weird for anyone.
The entry continued with the Marauder’s sniping back and forth at each other in the third person, which had Harry cracking up silently.
Harry figured he must be making good progress, because the book said that once he could get the warm feeling all the way to his fingers, toes, and the top of his head, he’d be ready to start making minor changes in his anatomy. Harry had made it to his neck, elbows, knees, and pelvis. It was on Friday evening he’d finally been able to spread the feeling to his entire body.
disapproval.
Hermione snorted in a decidedly non-Hermione fashion. “Well, first…”
As the two teens made their way back to the Gryffindor tower, Harry decided there was no time like the present to work on staying in his ‘Harry’ form. He’d decided to name his veela form Lauren, in homage to Draco’s made up name for him at the World Cup. The boy switched back to ‘Harry’, and found -to his surprise- that the feeling of his transformation had changed. It went from feeling like he was trying to pull apart an impossibly thick spring, to feeling like he was pulling against one of those really, really thick rubber bands. The ones used for bungee jumping. So, hard, but still doable.
“Uh, hey owl…” Harry started. “Good owl, c’mere and give that letter up, eh?”
Harry looked down, and
Lucius Malfoy, on the other hand, narrowed his eyes thoughtfully and smirked a bit, thinking about how he’d never seen his dragon interact so freely with a female peer. He’d have to put feelers out to this Devereaux family to see if they would be amenable to a betrothal in the future. If not, he would need to subtly push his boy away from the girl. Lucius sighed and chuckled a little, thinking he was getting ahead of himself.
After they caught up with the Weasleys, they wound up making their slow way along with all the other spectators to the stadium. As the family plus two walked, they could hear the voices of thousands blend into a background static that set the mood in the best way. The atmosphere was tense, the excitement and giddy anticipation made it so Harry couldn’t stop his lips from forming a small grin. They walked for about twenty minutes at a good pace, joshing and roughhousing with each other, before the crush of the crowd made such actions impossible. They had arrived at the stadium.
he thought. Harry trudged quietly down the stairs, then into the living room, dreading the coming conversation.
“Now boys,” Arthur looked at the twins with a sharp expression. “Make sure to keep a tight grip on that trunk.”
Feeling a little feisty, and not wanting to play the blonde boy’s games, Harry retorted “Aww, Malfoy, you say such sweet things.” He clasped his hands together at his chest and fluttered his eyelashes at his confused rival. “Surely that means you’d love to come sit with us for the game?”
As he was putting away the cleaner and mop in his old room under the stairs, Harry heard a crash from upstairs, and the panicked cries of Hedwig.
Fleur was pretty pleased at the situation though, overall. The boy had completed his transformation like he was born to it, and with a minor bit of spacing out aside, seemed to be taking to his new form well. The boy-cum-girl looked like he was coming to terms with his new circumstances.
In the evenings, Harry would practice connecting with his inner animal, but all he could do so far was recreate the feeling of warmth in his chest that he’d experienced in his primal mind. It was a bit frustrating, but the Marauder’s book said a disciplined (or stubborn) mind could get the process completed in two to three months, while an undisciplined (or weak-willed) person could get it done in about five months.
“You feel my Allure, do you not?” She inquired.
“Yes, uncle Vernon,” Harry stated, looking up to meet his uncle’s gaze.
And so armed with a book, a leaf, and a potion of dubious efficacy, The Boy Who Lived began his journey to become the most badass creature he could possibly be.
“What the…” Harry trailed off, confused and irritated at the terrible sight of all the men being idiots.
“How intriguing.” Dumbledore responded lightly. The old man then proceeded to run a battery of diagnostic spells that had Harry’s skin tingling, and caused static to run through his long, blond hair.
"Sorry," Harry told the elf, "I just thought you were someone I knew."
“Harry?” Hermione asked oddly. “Have you just been sitting in here all day? Did you not want to explore? I found this great stall on the history of-”
?!” He moaned, frustration beginning to slip through in his tone.
Harry went over to the ground floor bathroom and did as he was told, then came back to enjoy the breakfast provided. The majority of the breakfast conversation was about the quidditch match, but Hermione and Ginny had pulled Harry into a little huddle at one end of the table to discuss things that were more interesting. (Draco Malfoy, primarily) It seemed like breakfast was finally winding down when Harry spoke up to the family matriarch.
An amused sounding hoot was the only response he got.
In his second year, Harry had had to deal with a mad house elf, his relatives locking him in his room, a rogue bludger (sabotaged by said house elf), the fact that he could speak to snakes being known to the entire school now, the ostracization that came from his Parseltongue ability, a basilisk petrifying students, and Voldemort (again?) draining his friend’s sister of her life force to resurrect his sixteen year old self. All in all, a bad year for everyone.
Harry’s hands were cradling his face. They’d gotten the hated bra on him and adjusted his shirt to drape over his chest nicely, even if it was still a bit tight. On their way to lunch, Hermione leaned in to whisper in Harry’s ear. “You know, if Draco were around today, he’d have had kittens. The boys were fairly
“And boy,” Vernon turned when he reached the hall. “The entire house had better be
“So, Harry.” the girl began, leering obscenely. “Have you taken a look at the goods yet?”
Fleur squealed quietly before putting on what seemed to be her best poker face. She rose gracefully, and Harry was saddened that she seemed to clamp down on her Allure as she made her way into a sade chamber of the Great Hall that Harry hadn’t even known existed. Or at least, if he had, he didn’t remember until just now, his own tired brain supplied him.
“Hellooo Harry!” Ginny nearly crooned. “I saw you were having some trouble with my eldest brother…”
Draco Malfoy. The git. The insufferable, maddening smirk on his face made Harry want to kick the prat in the shin just to hear him yelp in pain. Harry did have to stop to appreciate the figure the Slytherin boy cut though. His upper-class breeding had resulted in fairly aristocratic, fine boned, and graceful body structure. His childhood fat was coming off, leaving toned arms and legs, and Harry blushed lightly as he thought
On August 24, Harry was woken up gently by Hermione at a truly ungodly hour. It couldn’t have been later than 3 in the morning when Harry and Ginny were both dragged yawning down to the kitchen for an early breakfast. Harry didn’t even get up this early for his runs. Thankfully, they didn’t have to wait long before all the boys trooped downstairs and the mood started to pick up. It was the day before the World Cup, and they’d be leaving soon to take a portkey to the location of the arena campgrounds.
Harry had just cleaned up after himself when he heard Vernon’s car pull up in the driveway. Looking around, he thought about anything else he could do in the short time he had before his uncle walked in the door.
Time spent at the Burrow was much different than time spent at the Dursley home. There were still chores to do, but with five brothers, a sister and two guests present, it almost seemed like the chores finished themselves. De-gnoming the garden was still a favorite task of Harry’s, along with tending the chickens and helping Mrs. Weasley prep meals. Ginny needled Hermione about Bill, and the two of them jeered at Harry for his inability to stay calm around the man (“Aww, you’re just like Ginny was first year!” Hermione had joked). Harry did finally get around to asking about the tiny owl that Ron had sent (“I call him Pig. Ginny named him Pigwidgeon, and now he won’t answer to anything else.” he’d informed Harry).
Hermione punched him on the arm and berated him about his language, but the medi-witch had a wry grin and was shaking her head. “Indeed not, Mr. Potter. I must say though, you’re taking this remarkably well.”
“What I think is happening is that we’re being more than civil with one another, friendly even.” Harry started pacing while talking. “I think that this is the best night I’ve had all summer, and it's only partially because of the quidditch game.” Draco’s eyes widened in apprehension, looking behind the feminine boy, but Harry continued on. “
Vernon’s eyes bulged in disbelief, then strange enough, narrowed in interest. “Hmm. Enjoy this sport much, do you?”
Fleur leaned down and whispered to Harry, “You see, this is what I have to put up with daily, everywhere I go. It’s like they don’t even look at your face.” Harry ignored her, and looked up at Ron.
Harry nodded his head nervously and stammered out “Nice to m-meet you, uh… Lord Malfoy…”
Back in the girl’s tent, Harry was laying on his bed, pillow over his face, wondering where it had all gone wrong. He thought it might have been during his face-off with Draco before the game. It had definitely gone off-rail when he’d thought of the blonde as a person instead of a rival. But really, it was that confession, he thought. When his filter had temporarily gone missing behind steel walls of impulsivity, embarrassment, and determination to find some answers.
The girl mumbled an apology, and went to sit down. McGonagall called out, “Stay after class!”
The boy with green eyes thought about the time-turner Hermione had had access to, and how neat it would be if she still had it. He thought about the adventure through time they’d taken to save both Buckbeak, and Sirius. And he thought about that time where Hermione had decked Malfoy straight into the ground. Good times. Of course, he could not forget about the year-long lessons with professor Lupin to cast the Patronus charm. Those days were the highlight of his year. He often learned about his parents through anecdotes Remus shared of their time in Hogwarts.
Today, our intrepid hero was sitting on his bed, ruminating on his past year and the events thereof. This last year, Harry had received a most wondrous map and an amazing broom, learned an advanced spell, learned his greatest fear, and met his godfather. He had also come out as gay to his friends, roommates, and his teammates on he quidditch team yesterday evening (to surprisingly unanimous support). There was of course more than that, but that’s what it boiled down to, really.
Wait… did I say two girls? I meant one girl and a boy.
Fred and George quickly turned to each other, exaggeratedly shocked looks on their faces and simultaneously exclaimed ““How did he know?!””
“So, we must help you control your Allure by tomorrow morning.” The born veela said, as if lecturing. “The control does not take much effort, though it may take a few tries. It will be a task of concentration to reign it in, and you will never completely succeed, but it should keep you from having to fend off boys all the time.”
The only real downer of the bunch was Percy. When Charlie had arrived, he and Bill had proceeded to have an epic table battle in the backyard one night before dinner, and right after Bill’s table had smashed Charlie’s to pieces (amid the cheering of those underage children watching), Percy had poked his head out of his window to rain on their parade.
a sister (brother?), in a way. All veela had an affinity for gathering into groups, and felt most comfortable when surrounded by their own. This sense of camaraderie and the warmth of each other’s Allure made for easy attachment to other veela. And Fleur could feel the Allure rolling off Harry like gentle waves. It caused her to feel more relaxed than she’d been since she’d seen her mother and sister this last summer.
He was brought out of his thoughts by a more serious tone in the older girl’s voice.
The resident medi-witch shook her head, knowing he was lying, but he didn’t seem to be exhibiting any terrible side effects of the transformation, so it wasn’t her business. He knew what he was getting himself into, he just needed to be given the paperwork to register. “I would go speak to the headmaster about this, Potter. But first,” Madam Pomfrey twirled her wand, conjuring something Harry wished he would never have to see in the context of him having to wear it.
The headmaster stroked his long beard in thought for a moment, then asked, “Do you consent to me casting a spell over you, Harry?” The boy nodded, wary, but interested.
Halfway through his pushups, he heard Mrs. Weasley call everyone to breakfast. Harry finished his set, then hopped up, jogged back to the house, and entered the kitchen. He tried to sit at the table, but Molly was having none of it.
“Well, my dear, I’d say
he thought. Anything to save him from the teasing he was about to endure.
think,” he whirled and pointed agitatedly at the boy, “that I’ve thought twice of our interactions as a date, and that if you weren’t such a… such a…
Viktor Krum was quickly chosen for Durmstrang, and Cedric Diggory for Hogwarts, but this entire process was not something Harry was interested in. He knew he was fading fast, and prepared himself for the end of the feast, making sure he’d not spilled anything on himself, when he heard something that hit him like another Wide-eye potion.
“He’s been learning how to become an animagus, Madam.”
“You should be fine going to the rest of your classes, Harry, but I would suggest going to your headmaster’s office first.” Hermione nodded in agreement, and even offered to go with him for moral support. Harry figured he might as well get it out of the way now, and when all the food disappeared, he and Hermione made their way up to Dumbledore’s office.
It seemed the first thing Harry needed to do was to put the mandrake leaf under his tongue. There was a small note about a sticking charm, but apparently Moony had already accounted for this. So, Harry popped the bottle open and stuck the small leaf to the bottom of his tongue. It felt weird and uncomfortable, but the sticking charm felt like it was doing its job. The worst part so far was the rancid taste of the leaf itself. This took first place on Harry’s ‘grossest taste ever’ list, and he’d had his head shoved into actual dog shite before. Retching a bit, Harry took one of the small chocolates in the basket and popped it into his mouth to drown out the taste for a while. It worked, but barely.
The blonde boy took his hair down from its ponytail and ran a hand through it, cherishing the relief something so simple could provide. He then began the tale of how he’d come to build the fantasy in his head that he was on a date with a boy he liked, and that it wasn’t necessarily Malfoy that it had to be. He did, however, admit to thinking Draco was very kissable. This caused squeals of delight to burst forth from Ginny, and earned him a fond look from Hermione.
On the floor of a room in a magically expanded carriage, sat two girls. The older of the two was blonde, hair bordering on silvery white. Her features were aristocratic, elegant, and above all, beautiful. She had her slim arms wrapped around the younger girl’s shoulders from behind.
Harry and Ron broke, laughing quietly, and the twins gave their guest their best mischievous smiles.
Ron looked a little closer, which caused Harry to redden a bit. A lightbulb apparently went off in his head, because he did next what he often did best; put his foot in his mouth.
“Ginny, can we discuss this later?” Harry asked desperately. “
“Too true, Georgie. Seems all the witches want a piece of our dear William.” Harry assumed from past experience the one who had spoken was actually George. Then, the meaning of whatever twin it was that had spoken pierced his thoughts.

The poor little thing looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose like a ripe tomato. It wasn't Dobby - it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry's friend Dobby had been.
Harry put up with the manhandling for just a minute or so more, before backing away, grumpily putting his shirt back on. “Yes! Obviously I’m a boy. I have a… dammit. Y’know. A…” He awkwardly motioned in the general direction of his crotch
“Ugh, I swear, you two have to have some kind of twin telepathy or something.” Harry grumbled, miffed that he’d already had to start dealing with the madness that was the Weasley twins.
“Best not to be-”
***HCTHtM***
The green eyed boy leveled an unamused stare at his friend. “Yes, thank you Ron, for that wonderfully insightful gem of knowledge.”
Hello dears. Here’s a new chapter. I had a lot of inspiration leading up to today, so I hope you enjoy. If it seems to be going quickly, there’s a reason. The story will slow down significantly as we go and we get into the details. If anyone finds anything to critique, please let me know.
Harry had made sure to inform Mrs. Weasley of his new diet, as mandated by uncle Vernon, and kept up with his running and cardio regimen. Lacking a neighborhood, Harry did laps around the property’s fence line instead (It was more than adequate for his purposes), and lacking weights, he just used some heavy items from around the house. He did get heated looks from Ginny and Hermione for waking them up when leaving the room, but nothing good came without a price.
Harry let out a whoop of joy, while Albus smiled gently at him. Hermione was happy as a clam as well. “Well, Harry. It seems that is that done and sor-”
“I saw it. That’s what happened with the men at the World Cup this year. It wasn’t as bad, but the boys
somebody had gotten a job in the ministry, and his
The seventeen year old rubbed Harry’s back as he sipped on his water, while she catalogued all the things she would need to do to help out her new sister.
Hermione gave a rueful smile, then said, “‘Oh’, indeed.” The elderly woman in front of him had an expression of
Harry thought to himself, his face heating again at how close his rival had moved his chair so they could talk over the background noise. Their laughing and general demeanor was the source of astounded looks from Hermione, Ginny, and the twins. Ronald was too enamoured by the game to pay attention.
“What?” The redhead asked, confused at the reactions of the three in front of him.
she thought absently. Fleur had expected a scream of surprise, or at least some hyperventilation. Something, at least. She was almost disappointed.
“I’m gay, not an effing girl. Merlin, Ginny.” All of them blushed a little at Harry’s implication.
Deciding to spend the day practicing instead of wandering, Harry headed back to the tent and crossed his legs on his bed. Reaching toward his link to his (what he was beginning to suspect was a humanoid) animagus form, Harry let go and tried for any further changes.He passed the morning and afternoon in this fashion, but only felt a slight tingling in his abdomen for his efforts, which he ascribed to being hungry again.
“It is like this for many beautiful women. But for you, it will be worse. Because you are veela.” With a light squeeze, she told him he’d done a good job controlling his Allure for the duration of lunch.
The venue in question loomed above them, all golden walls and extravagant architecture. Its size was such that Harry was sure it could fit about the Dursley home inside it about a hundred times. The plus side of this was that his friends and he were already within its shadow, and it blocked out the sun on the horizon, making it much easier to see.
As he and Hermione crossed the threshold of the headmaster’s office, he heard Dumbledore call for his attention.
Harry was not the only person in the room to stare at the large, intimidating man. Petunia shot a glare of what seemed to be equal parts exasperation and betrayal..
“Harry,” Ginny wondered aloud while running her hands around his hips and the sides of his chest area, which had gained a little fat and was very sensitive. “You
As the minutes turned into an hour, then two, she could feel him getting the hang of taking the Allure in hand. Now, it was time to control it.
Harry stopped, then replayed what he’d said, his face slowly going from pale, to pink, to crimson in rapid succession. He looked back up at the boy opposite him, who had his face in his hand. “Potter,” he said resignedly, looking past Harry, then into the emerald eyes across from him. “I think it’s best that I let you go back to the… your friends tents. I will send an owl to arrange a time to meet up so we can discuss this with clear heads.” With that, Malfoy turned around and a shiver went down the green eyed boy’s spine when he heard two voices clear their throats behind him expectantly.
“I’m knackered Hermione. Can you just tell me the password to the entrance so I can go to sleep?” Hermione did so, and the boy turned around and walked away, waving over his shoulder as he said “We’ll talk about this later today, Hermione. It’s a good thing it’s still pretty early. G’night.”
***HCTHtM***
“Uncle Vernon?” Harry began tentatively. “Do you have a moment?”
“So, boy. You play the…” Vernon looked down at the open book in his hand. “... seeker position, is that right?”
Another fifteen minutes of walking, they had reached their destination. A decently sized spot, big enough to fit two small tents. Mr. Weasley wrangled the children into setting up his borrowed tents ‘the muggle way’. The elder Weasley tried to help, but it ended up being Harry and Hermione that figured out the entire process.
charm, her conflicting emotions gave way to amusement.
The lines of questioning went similarly for the next hour. Vernon’s keen eyes noted Harry’s comfort in the sports robes, asking about the differences between models of broom and quality of armor in the matches.Then came an order he couldn’t believe he was hearing.
*****
“Dammit,” He continued, suddenly remembering the daze he was in this morning. “What happened in class? I remember getting pretty much yelled at by McGonagall, but not much else.”
Harry was shifting from foot to foot outside the headmaster’s door; so much so, that Hermione backhanded his arm and hissed at him to quit fidgeting. The two teens waited for a couple minutes, then heard Dumbledore call out “Enter!” Harry opened the door, then let Hermione in after him.
Dumbledore’s eyes glittered a bit. “And how did this come about?”
Harry thought, dumbstruck at the sight.
Ten minutes of awkward silence between the two passed before he heard Malfoy whisper, “Potter, what the hell are you playing at?”
“Ugh, Ginny. Why can’t you ever actually be dressed when I come in?” Harry complained, dropping on to her bed next to Hermione and helping his best friend with her hair.
on you!” The boy in question wished whole-heartedly for death.
Vernon eyed the boy up and down. “You don’t look the sports type, boy.”
***HCTHtM***
Harry elbowed Ron in the arm as he held out the complicated looking device. “Here,” the boy chirped conspiratorially, “see what you make of these.”
“I see. That is very similar to how Minerva describes turning into her animagus form. But for her, letting go returns her to her… well, let us call it her ‘base’ form.”
“RON!” he yelled, careless of the stopped conversations around them, and the searing gaze of Draco Malfoy from across the room. “I swear to God, the next time you look at my chest like that, you’re getting a face full of pumpkin juice!”
She continued for a good minute more, then she was able to calm herself. After her laughter died down to the occasional giggle, Fleur wiped a tear from her eye.
Dumbledore started talking about the tournament again, and Harry spaced out. Not like the tournament was even really interesting to him, except in the way the World Cup was interesting. He came back to awareness when Fleur nudged him in the side sharply. The reason for the heinous assault became clear when she pointed out the Goblet of Fire and its little stool being brought in and set beside The headmaster.
“Here sister, drink.” She implored, putting the cup in his hand “You need water. Drink.”
boy.”
The boy turned his attention downward to take stock of his new features, and blanched slightly at the breasts he could clearly see protruding from his front. His shirt was uncomfortably tight across the chest, probably due to the aforementioned breasts. A little movement of the thighs and a wiggle of his bum demonstrated that his… well, he’d definitely turned into a girl.
“What, Pet?” Vernon defended himself. ”You know how I feel about sports and athleticism in youth. Teaches discipline and respect for a team.” Turning back to Harry, he continued. “Alright, off you go then.”
“Ronald!” Hermione reprimanded, while Harry pressed the bridge of his nose with his hand. “It’s Harry! For heaven’s sake, you can see if in his eyes, if nowhere else.”
going a bit mad over Harry.”
Harry’s face was red, and his mind was whirling in panic. “Uhh… yeah.” He responded lamely. “It was uh, about midway through first year when I started.”
Thusly interrupted, the topic was dropped. The three teenagers unloaded their bags, and already putting the conversation out of their minds, went to enjoy the festival.
“before you meet our Bill.”
“Y’know. A ‘Harry Potter’ thing.” Harry responded. “Like, instantly being good on a broom, or being a parselmouth. Or having a murderous psychopath come and kill your family, only to have the same spell that killed your parents bounce off of you and kill your attacker.”
“Seriously though Harrykins,” one of the twins began.
He grabbed the bra, turned around, and began unbuttoning his shirt. Pomfrey politely pulled the curtain, and Hermione helped him figure it out.
“Nothing, Malfoy,” Harry grinned innocently. “Can’t a boy enjoy a game of quidditch with a
Harry was woken at 8am by Hermione, who was babbling something about being late for class. He’d only gotten about an hour of sleep, but he dragged himself out of bed anyway and stripped himself of his nightclothes. He didn’t even register Hermione’s gasp at his exposed breasts and lack of visible parts downstairs. He got dressed at a snail’s speed, and was ushered off to class by Hermione before he could go through his morning routine, or even put his bag fully on his shoulder.
Today, Harry was sitting on his bed doing some Transfiguration homework when the love of his life, the beautiful and regal Hedwig, unexpectedly swept into his room through his window, startling him so badly he fell off his bed.
Fleur raked her gaze over the room’s other occupant, and took stock of her appearance. The magically flawless skin, silky hair, the perfect bodily proportions. She sighed, then thought about her situation while Harry did… whatever it was that Harry was doing.
“D’you see that, Hermione? That was like, three times longer than when I last tried! I’m sure I’ll be back to myself in no time.” Hermione made a concerned, but happy noise that he took as agreement.
*****
And with that, Arthur tapped his wand to the rope and incanted “The Burrow!”
-- Pyrdiu Lefquo
“Because Harry,” Ginny shot back in a snotty tone. “it’s hot as hell in this room with three people, and it’s not even like...” The redheaded girl trailed off, looking thoughtfully at Harry before walking over.
He thought excitedly. If he didn’t have to buy a book, Vernon was sure to be happy. Harry lunged up the stairs, dove into his trunk, and victoriously pulled out ‘Quidditch Through the Ages’ from the sea of loose clothing and school supplies.
“Ah. P-Professor. I-I can explain…”
Harry decided to foist his magical viewing device off onto the twins, happy he’d convinced Ron to use the other pair.
The more he thought about it, the more Harry’s curiosity turned into want. And oh how he wanted it. If only he had a…
With a predatory smile, the redhead put a finger to her lip as if thinking. “What was it you said to me this summer, Harry? Oh yes!” Ginny clasped her hands underneath her chin and continued in a high-pitched, mocking tone “‘I’m gay, not an effing girl. Merlin, Ginny.’” She then flopped on Harry’s bed and across his lap, giggling madly.
Harry smiled widely. Ron’s writing style was very distinctive and entertaining to read.. He wasn’t all that angry at his friend spilling the beans about his sexuality, he was actually grateful he wouldn't have to bunk somewhere near Ron, having had more than enough of that during the school year. It would certainly be awkward sleeping in the same tent as Hermione and Ginny, though.
Once more, minutes turned into hours, and night turned into dawn. Nearabouts the time the sun finished tearing itself away from the horizon, Harry had finally completed his task. He was able to grasp and control his Allure without going into meditation.
“You go wash up, young man.” she ordered, brandishing her spoon. “I’ll not have you at my table with grass stained hands and sweat dripping down your face.”
The man hummed in thought, then asked the oddest line of questioning Harry had ever heard from his uncle. “This… sports event. What’s the game called?”
“Well, it’s been pretty eventful, sir.” Harry’s friend looked at him pointedly, and the boy understood he was supposed to take off his outer robe. He did so, and watched as the headmaster’s bushy eyebrows rose marginally in surprise.
Hermione looked exaggeratedly grave as she turned to Ginny, stating “Oh, we’ll be talking about this later for sure. It would be a crime to let you keep wearing boys clothes with a body like that.”
***HCTHtM***
~~~~~
Harry thought, eyes widening, and mouth subconsciously forming a shit-eating grin. ‘
~~~~~
Harry leant into Fleur’s embrace, confused and not understanding what the situation was, but experiencing a lightheaded warm feeling. As far as he knew, the transformation had gone swimmingly, and he could now work on going back to his normal body.
Before they could continue their inquisition, Mr. Weasley’s voice called out from the closed tent flap. “Harry! Girls! You alright in there? We’re going to go explore the campgrounds for awhile. If you leave, make sure to be back by 6!”
The black haired lad was still processing his trip into his primal mind, and took a moment to parse what aunt Petunia was hollering at him. When he finally realized it must be the next morning, he called out a quick “Yes aunt Petunia!” and swiftly got changed.
“Y’know, Harrykins,” one of them piped up, “Our older brother Bill is in residence this month. Your friend Hermione seems smitten.”
“And try to man up, Potter. No more of that stuttering and looking at the ground shite. You’re a sportsman, show some self-confidence.”
Harry then crawled into bed and fell asleep almost instantly.
When the two arrived in the Great Hall, only a few people had already made it down to the tables. Those here were likely the ones who had free periods before lunch. They made their way to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to Fleur, who had apparently been waiting for them.
“Ginny!” Hermione exclaimed, scandalized.

“Harry, what possessed you to dye your hair such a
It was unfortunate that attendance at dinner was mandatory tonight. The revealing of the names from the Goblet was supposed to be sort of like, a celebration or something? Hermione had told him at some point, but he didn’t remember, due to other pressing concerns. The girls seemed to remember right at that point that it was getting to be that time, so they grabbed Harry’s arms and frog-marched him to the Great Hall.

“And you… fly about at high speeds, then?”
After he’d sent a response off to Ron with Hedwig (and also the excitable little owl),the entire day was spent cleaning. Harry obsessively cleaned even the gutters outside and mowed the lawn. Harry was a dervish, sweeping all dirt and dust away from its place, leaving all surfaces in the house veritably gleaming.in his wake. Petunia didn’t even need to tell the boy to fix up lunch. She had come into the kitchen and there were two place settings with a turkey sandwich, orange, and water each already set up, with Harry vacuuming the living room while his aunt and cousin ate.It was in the lead up to dinner that Petunia had had enough.
The elderly man took his wand out and swished it through the air. Harry felt the warm feeling he got when he changed forms sear through his body, and would have hollered in pain, but the sensation lasted for too short a time. Luckily, the boy was distracted by the fact he was in his normal, non-veela form again.
*****
?!” she exclaimed, a little louder than she probably should have. “Get inside!” She hissed, motioning him in impatiently while looking up and down the corridor. Harry gratefully followed her directive, ducking in through the portrait hole with haste.
Fleur Delacour was feeling smug, concerned, and kind of offended all at once. She was still disgruntled that Harry’s animagus form was a veela, but she still enjoyed being correct. She spent a couple of minutes comforting the boy turned girl in front of her, then guided him to the chair near the wall of her room. As she conjured a glass and filled it with water from an
Halfway to the Weasley’s tent, Harry had forgotten his arm was still linked with Draco’s. They’d had to keep up appearances for his father, and had just never let go of each other. It was comfortable, and could he be blamed for wanting to pretend to be on what could be called his first date? The newly blonde boy was shocked out of his thoughts at the sound himself giggling. Did he just giggle? Was he legitimately enjoying time with his biggest rival?
“Well, it’s a bit like a cross between dodgeball and footie.” Harry mused. There was no need to explain the snitch to his uncle. He wouldn’t get it anyway, the boy thought. “Granted, it’s played two hundred or so feet in the air.”
“Yes sir.”
What followed was one of the most enlightening, amusing, and baffling conversations Harry had ever had. Harry and Hermione learned that elves were not only made to do things they may not want to in addition to their normal duties, they were made to wash, cook, and clean without pay. They seemed a lot like indentured servants, really. It reminded Harry unpleasantly of his childhood at the Dursleys.
“”Yes dad”” the boys responded in stereo.
All too soon, it was September 1, and Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron were seated on the Hogwarts Express. They were waving at the Weasley parents when a letter dropped into Harry’s hand. He looked at the envelope, hoping to see who it was from, and wondering why he'd gotten it on the train.
pureblood companion?” The rich boy’s face took on an interesting shade of pink as he opened his mouth to (presumably) continue their verbal sparring, but he was interrupted by a deep cultured voice.
Garish tents of all sizes, color, and quality were on display. Some of them looked like miniature castles, some like dinky little muggle tents. And once you’d stopped taking the tents themselves into account, there were people of all nationalities and colors. And Harry
“Well, boy. You’re off then.” He stated awkwardly, “You… you do well in that quidditch game, you understand me? I’ll not have you wasting my investment in you.”
Harry hung his head, before nodding in agreement. He then straightened back up before stretching.
Arthur gave a little chuckle at Harry’s distress. “That was a portkey, my boy. Magical transportation for those without floo access, an apparition license, or who can’t afford a ride on the Knight Bus. We’ll be taking one to the World Cup arena next month.”
Malfoy’s face darkened in embarrassment, and he obstinately said with as much grace and charm as possible, “Of course Potter, how could I turn down such a polite invitation.” The blonde stepped up beside Harry and held his arm elbow out, making eye contact with his green-eyed counterpart, eyebrow raised and smirking snottily.
Conclusion: He had turned into a girl.
Never one to turn down a challenge, especially from Malfoy, Harry blushed deeply and  threaded his arm with the other boy’s and let the Slytherin lead him to two empty seats, leaving behind a confused and slightly mortified Hermione trying desperately not to laugh.
Nestled inside the basket were some candies and snacks, a tiny bottle with what looked like a mottled brown leaf inside, a book, a potion that looked like what Harry imagined LSD felt like to be on, and two innocent looking letters. Taking a look at the seemingly random items, Harry sighed, then picked up the letter from Sirius and broke the seal on it.
Harry grumbled something about “-not cute…”, and crossed his arms. This caused his mood to sour a little, because he found the way he crossed his arms to be a little uncomfortable in his new body. He’d have to learn to do a number of things differently, he noted absently.
*****
“Ginny!” Harry near-shouted, covering his eyes as she got closer in nothing but jeans and her bra. “
“Ah, hello Harry, Miss Granger. How has your morning been so far?” Harry shrugged helplessly, both unwilling to start the conversation, and impressed the old man knew it was him, and let Hermione answer for the both of them.
Upon entrance to his room, he saw the spastically fluttering, miniscule form of an absurdly adorable little owl carrying a letter bigger than it was ‘round the room, knocking things everywhere and harassing the life out of Hedwig.
Hermione and Fleur apparently thought that was the funniest thing they’d ever heard, because they started cackling. Well, Hermione was cackling, Fleur’s laugh was too elegant for such a crass word to apply. It still irritated Harry, though. He crossed his arms over his chest again, serving the dual purpose of helping him sulk, and hiding his bust from Ron and the other boys.
On Saturday evening, Harry was packed and ready to head to the park a few blocks away, Hedwig was winging her way toward the Burrow, and uncle Vernon was standing in front of his nephew, looking down on him with what was a comparatively softer expression than his normal glare.
***HCTHtM***
“It’s true, Harry.” Hermione added. “We showed up right after you giggled at him. I suggested we take a moment to announce ourselves to see how you and he got along without everyone present.”
“Gently, Harry.” She said soothingly. “Do not grasp, cradle. Treat it like a fragile glass sculpture. It is a part of you. Treat it gently. It is not an enemy.”
The girl was wearing Gryffindor colors, but an ill-fitting men’s uniform for some reason. Also, her hair was decidedly rumpled, and she looked like she’d fall asleep at any moment. It took her a moment, but she noticed that the girl’s top was tight around her chest and her eh-hem… assets were on display in a very unbecoming way..
Harry spent the rest of the afternoon in Gryffindor tower, sulking at his inability to hold his original form for more than a minute. It was
Harry picked himself up off the floor and looked over his girl. All feathers were in place, and she didn’t look too tired. She must have taken a good amount of rest while on her way back from Sirius. Speaking of his godfather, Hedwig was perched atop a moderately sized package that looked like a basket wrapped in a cloth of some sort. The green-eyed boy fingered the tag that was on the string tying the cloth closed, then pulled at the bow, causing the cloth to fall away and reveal the basket.
The little bird certainly seemed to have heard him, for it zoomed straight into Harry’s chest and fell to the ground, fluttering madly and looking slightly concussed. Harry took advantage of the poor bird’s unfortunate state by reaching down and relieving it of its burden, then quickly putting it into Hedwig’s empty cage. Shaking his head in disbelief at the poor creature, Harry looked at the letter and saw it was from his friend, Ron Weasley.
“Yes, Mr. Potter, a brassiere. The main complaint with Minerva this morning, according to miss Granger here, was about you being ill dressed and… well… I believe you students call it ‘nipping’, these days.”
"So that's a house-elf?" Ron muttered. "Weird things, aren't they?"
The morning passed in a blur. Transfiguration, then Defense were on the schedule today, and he only remembered little flashes of classes. He must have done pretty badly, because he recalled being dressed down for his appearance and demeanor, then a minor bit of pain that had temporarily gotten his attention. He came back to himself once Hermione shook him into awareness in a room he felt like he recognized but was too tired to place.
“Again.” Fleur commanded. Now knowing what to do, Harry got to work.
~~~~~
“Huh.” Hermione said, tilting her head in thought. “Harry, it may be that I’ve never seen you in properly fitted clothes before, but you’ve got an incredibly feminine frame, did you know that?” The Boy Who Lived lightly flailed his hands at Ginny to get her to back off, then turned to look in the girl’s mirror.
The older gentleman looked like he was merely indulging the excited englishman until he saw Harry’s scar. At that point, he gabbled something unintelligible in his native tongue to one of his attendants, then took a closer look at Harry. The man looked him up and down, then looked somewhat smug upon seeing Harry’s Bulgaria jersey. It was then that the worst possible guests made their appearance.
As his uncle made his way through the kitchen and out the door, Harry stood in the living room motionlessly, thunderstruck at the concept that all he’d needed to get through to his uncle was to talk about sports of all things.
