I turn to Dudley. He blows me a kiss, tosses his rucksack over his shoulder, and walks away. He won’t look back. I keep calling out to him, but he never looks back.
Draco reached out, his magic melding with Harry’s, pulsing as it connected. It wasn’t like talking, it was more of a feeling. But he tried to tell Harry, through emotion—love, compassion, joy—that he needed to relax and let go. That he would be there for Harry and would take care of him.
Draco bit into a prawn and Harry delighted in his blissed-out expression. Harry started with the bruschetta and smiled as the tropical flavours exploded (metaphorically) on his tongue.
. That was one of the few times Draco had wished he still carried a wand. But no, hexing his Muggle boss wasn’t a good idea—that was something his father would do.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” he said and removed his glasses. He opened the bottle, tilted his head back, and placed a drop directly into each eye. It burned, like getting soap in your eye, but became more tolerable after he blinked. He replaced his glasses.
Harry exhaled. “No, it’s excellent. It always is.” He guided his cock back to Draco’s hot, wet mouth.
“That was intense,” Harry said when he could speak again. Draco grabbed a napkin from the picnic basket and cleaned them up. Not as tidy as a Scourgify but just as effective.
Harry paced the room. He lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. He paced the room some more. He banged at the door.
With surgical precision, Draco spoke the incantation to access the vortex and create a carefully constructed rift. Never taking his eyes off his work, he instructed Hermione to begin. She took a deep breath and commanded the Elder Wand. Her hand vibrated, then jolted, but nothing else happened. After a moment of silence, a low buzzing noise, like static, filled the room.
Draco sucks on the tender spot behind Harry’s earlobe and Harry can’t help but moan. He can feel Draco’s triumphant smirk as he goes pliant in the man’s arms. Which gives Harry an idea.
“That was him on the phone, wasn’t it?” He took her silence as confirmation. “You can’t keep us apart.”
A tap on the glass brought him out of his thoughts. Artemis. Two letters from his mother in one day was too persistent, even for her. He almost sent the owl away in anger. But then he had a better idea. He removed the letter, added it to the pile, and pulled out his stationary. He raised his eyebrows as the owl hopped closer to his curry.
“Oh God,” Harry said. “I think I’m having an acid flashback. It sounded like you just said we’re wizards.”
, grew inside him until it was overwhelming. He didn’t know if he could spend the rest of his life with the knowledge of what might have been.
Harry looks over and sees that Hermione is already halfway through her drawing, and it looks so incredibly realistic that it could be a photograph. Maybe he can ask her to give it to him later… so he can study it… for technique purposes. He bites his lip and resolves to focus.
Harry cancelled the Sticking Charm and turned. “You arse. You’re absolutely incorrigible.” He pulled Draco into a searing kiss, tasting himself on his lips.
Harry sorted through the pile: a bible, a syllabus along with the first books to complete his A levels at home, and a brochure for Grunnings, a company that sold drills.
He left himself detailed notes outlining his plans to study and apply to medical school. He’d lined up a new job for himself at a wine store—he knew plenty about wine.
“We don’t have to.” Harry seemed nervous. Perhaps he was still worried about exposing this part of himself. But Draco hadn’t stopped thinking about it since Harry had confided in him. Was he somehow accessing his latent memories while high on LSD? Draco needed to know, both as a boyfriend who cared, and from a medical perspective.
Rage, unlike anything he’d ever felt before, bubbled inside him and pushed the pain aside. He needed it—he needed it
Harry passed him the money. When their hands brushed, an electric jolt pulsed through Harry. When Harry looked into Draco’s eyes, he was certain he’d felt it too.
Harry held Draco tight and whispered, “So good. You were so good for me. Took me so well. So tight, so perfect.” Draco didn’t expect the rush of pride from the unexpected praise, but he held on for dear life hoping he’d always have this, that Harry knew what he was saying when he told him he’d always want him.
—set the cups down, had to steady them to keep them from toppling over. When he looked back up, like an apparition, the man and the woman he was with were gone. Maybe he’d imagined the whole thing? Except Jess had seen him, too.
It’s done. I no longer need to worry about Draco Malfoy. Harry, on the other hand… It’ll be all right, though. I’ll set him straight. He’s so lucky he has me.
He’d never sent it, though. He knew Potter would only laugh at him and show it to all his Gryffindor followers. Draco couldn’t risk that—the Malfoy reputation had to be upheld at all costs. The chance of public humiliation outweighed the slim possibility of a positive outcome, and the old Draco would never risk pride or public appearance. He’d only sent Potter the notes intended to hurt.
Draco arrived home, still fuming, and paced the flat. He picked up Harry’s letter and studied the ♡H. He was beyond reach. But that didn’t mean Draco couldn’t help him. There was still a mystery to unravel—the swirling mass pulsating inside Harry’s head. How had it gotten there? What caused it?
“That’s what I thought,” Jess said, and slid off the counter. She grinned mischievously. “Speaking of, four o’clock. Tall, dark, and handsome is giving you the eye. Good luck.” With a wink, she grabbed the broom and headed for the stockroom.
Draco comes up behind him and rests his chin on Harry’s shoulder as he meets his eyes in the mirror. “Because I endured the Weasleys last Christmas.”
“Speed up the magical drain. I know. We did LSD together—don’t give me that look—and that’s how I found out how it affects wizards. But I also had a clear re-play of the final battle. The Dark Lord’s defeat. You disarmed him, and the Elder wand became yours. I saw it.”
The bird continued to groom her plumage. Draco sighed. There was no letter to add to the pile, but he saw a very old book on the table, familiar, leather-bound, from the Malfoy library.
Harry examines himself carefully in the dusty mirror—his eyes travel along his arms, over his torso, and down his legs. He’s not the scrawny boy he once was, neglected and malnourished, fueled by fear and determination. But he’s also not the toned athlete who downed protein shakes and kept track of his macros. Harry is blatantly aware that
It felt dangerous, but there was only one way he could think of to find out. He lifted the dropper and placed a drop in his mouth. It was tasteless. He sat for a little while, feeling increasingly stupid and naïve. He wasn’t sure what he had expected to happen. But something. He sat down on his bed and decided that maybe he should take more. He was just about to open the bottle when it hit him. He felt a pulse of electricity, like what he’d felt when he’d touched Draco’s hand, but stronger. It intensified, and all the hairs stood on the back of his arms. He stared at them, each hair, unique and upright.
Work at a cinema? Not something Lucius Malfoy would do. Study Muggle medicine? Not what Lucius would do. Give up magic and live as a Muggle? Draco hoped his chosen lifestyle had the man seething in Azkaban.
, you look just like you did when you won the League Cup. You had the finest arse in the entire league. I couldn’t take my eyes off you.”
flew through the air. Draco caught it like a snitch. He opened the box, and when he grasped his wand, it pulsed and sparked, eager to be of service once again.
Hermione gasped, and Draco felt an electric rippling, the exotic pull of Harry’s magic as it siphoned through the Elder Wand, through his arms, his body, and into the room. Draco’s entire body pulsed; the lights flickered. Mesmerised, he watched as a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours filled the room: currant and ruby, marigold and amber, daffodil and fire opal, fern and emerald, spruce and lapis, lavender and amethyst. Draco watched in awe as the colours swirled and danced. This was the essence of Harry, stupendous and enchanting. This was why he loved this man—had always loved him.
But when Harry opened his eyes, they were gone. He blinked; they writhed inside the chamber pot. He blinked again. No slugs.
Harry’s pencil snaps. The man seriously has no shame. He works in accounting yet finds any excuse to be in the Auror department whenever they call in the Curse-Breakers, fawning and falling all over Malfoy. It makes Harry sick. Hermione passes Harry a replacement pencil and loudly tells Goldstein he has no class. But the incident has not affected Malfoy, who remains poised in his pose. Graceful. Gorgeous.
He hurried to the loo and splashed cold water on his face. He took three breaths, deep and steady, while he looked in the mirror. His face was paler than usual. He’d thought he’d moved on. Made peace with Potter’s death. Why would he suddenly see him now? Clearly, he wasn’t over it. He hoped this wasn’t one of those post-trauma situations where he’d start seeing versions of Potter everywhere he looked.
Harry takes a deep breath and stares at Malfoy, hating himself (just a little bit) for his puppy-dog crush that inconveniently won’t go away no matter how hard he tries. He knows full well that nothing will ever come from his
(seriously, who names these places?), a shady apothecary at the far end of Knockturn Alley known for its unsavoury clientele. Malfoy enters the store first, carefully silencing the doorbell before it can make a sound, and I follow closely behind. (We’d fought about that, too. About which one of us should take the lead. Malfoy won the game of wizards, goblins, and trolls—the wizarding equivalent of rock, paper, scissors. His haughty sneer made my blood boil.)
“I didn’t want any part in it, but they gave me no choice.” Draco rolled up his left sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark—Petunia gasped. “My family supported the wrong side; I was branded and put to work. The things they forced me to do…” Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “They manipulated and used me.” He pulled his sleeve back down and buttoned the cuff. “I left home, and the wizarding world as soon as I could. I’ve renounced magic. It’s brought so much pain and suffering.”
. He’s early, but it’s nearly time. The butterflies grow in his stomach but become overshadowed by something darker, something not so sweet.
Draco set to work brewing a potion of his own devising, a blend of wizard and Muggle components. Artemis perched on a chair and casually observed.
Harry needs to calm down, to do something to counteract his arousal. He purposely looks at Malfoy’s left arm with the Dark Mark prominently on display. The Muggles probably think it’s a cool biker tatt, not the brand that it really is. Malfoy has it glamoured so a wreath of holly surrounds the skull and snake. How very festive. Malfoy’s part in the war still nags at Harry’s conscience, but not enough to interfere with his desire.
Harry and Draco decided early on it was best to start fresh. Their flat was in a Muggle neighbourhood, but it combined the best of wizarding and Muggle technology. Draco had the perfect study into which he disappeared for hours at a time to conduct his research. They travelled frequently and extensively—never to the same place twice.
. There were many things Muggles could see and diagnose that wizards could not. For example, the Greengrass family carried a Blood Curse, a malediction passed down from generation to generation, but they never knew which child the curse would affect until it was too late. If they had access to genetics, perhaps they could predict in advance who carried the gene and prevent the illness from taking hold.
Harry mouthed, “Sorry,” and ushered Draco into the living room, a garish monstrosity decorated with conflicting patterns in obnoxious cranberry hues. An elongated oval wooden coffee table—the cherry wood clashed hideously with the cranberry decor—already set up for afternoon tea, was sandwiched between an overly plush sofa and a matching wingback chair. Harry’s aunt Petunia wore a sour expression and eyed Draco with obvious disdain as she lit a cigarette. Well, he’d had a lifetime of dealing with difficult people; he could handle one more.
“Ouch! All right, all right. I’ll go see him.” He feigned annoyance but fetched her a piece of extra spicy jerky. While she ate, he cast a Tempus. It was already 1 pm—he barely had enough time to make himself presentable.
“He must have been under the cloak because I never saw him. He slipped the note, the pouch, and your wand into my bag. Must have done it when I was consoling Ron. Fred had just been killed, and we were all so distraught.” She took a moment before she continued. “I wish he would have told me what he planned to do. We would have found another way. I would have stopped him. But he willingly sacrificed himself to save us all.” She huffed a wry little laugh. “It’s such a
In the kitchen, he lit a cigarette and stared out into the garden. The roses were blanketed in darkness, save for a sliver of light cascading through the back door. What was he going to do with his aunt? She needed help, and he wasn’t sure he was the one to give it to her. He reached down and grabbed the nearest teacup—hand-painted with dainty roses, Petunia’s favourite. Absently, he brought the cup to his lips and drank deeply.
After a moment’s hesitation, Harry picked up the bird and flopped back in bed. Faint lines of ink visible through the paper informed him the bird contained a message. He took a moment to appreciate the artistry—he knew he wouldn’t be able to fold it back up as neatly. Carefully, he smoothed out the paper and instantly recognised Draco’s tidy script. His stomach fluttered as the words swam on the page. Harry took a deep breath, and the writing steadied.
“Exactly. He used significant objects. Salazar Slytherin’s locket. Helga Hufflepuff’s Cup. That’s why we came to the school. We were seeking Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem.”
“Do you think I’m mad?” Harry asked. “Seeing all these impossible things and feeling like they’re real? Craving them? Needing them?”
He picked up his snacks, his change, and returned to the film. As he opened the door, he glanced back. Draco was still staring at him. With a parting wink, Harry disappeared through the door.
on Harry’s forehead, but much to his concern the crack remained untouched by the Healing Charm. He tried not to worry.
“My Saviour,” Harry said, and Draco was very much aware of the irony—one of the Saviours of the wizarding world calling him, a reformed Death Eater,
Draco’s job at the cinema wasn’t a necessity—a visit to Gringotts connected his vault to a Muggle bank so he could withdraw Muggle currency—but it was something he enjoyed. It gave him ample opportunity to observe and interact with Muggles (they were nothing like what his parents—or the Dark Lord—had told him) and he genuinely liked films. They were just like wizarding photographs, but instead of an endless loop, they continued onwards and told the full story. It was also fun to see wizarding influences on Muggle culture. He strongly suspected
was interesting news, but Harry found it hard to focus because Draco’s hand had made a slow descent down Harry’s crack and was now gently massaging his entrance, still pleasantly sore from the night before.
Draco stared back. The sudden shift surprised him, but he refused to be intimidated. “Where’s what?”
The full moon was so bright its light scattered over every leaf, illuminating the surfaces as though coated in glitter. Harry blinked. No, no glitter—just ordinary light. A cool breeze brushed past him, tenderly tickling at his exposed skin. Or maybe that was Draco’s hair? Harry’s fingers wound through the silky strands.
I received a postcard from Madrid, and then another from Ibiza. He said he was having the time of his life, and I wasn’t to worry.
, and then he’d push inside in one long, slow, deliberate motion, only pausing when balls-deep. Harry would suck in his breath while he adjusts to the stretch and fullness. Then, just when Harry can’t take it anymore and is about to cry out for more, Malfoy would pull out, almost all the way, and thrust forward. He’d establish a rhythm, building towards a crescendo, and the sound of skin slapping against skin would echo throughout the room.
Briefly, Harry’s eyes opened—completely bloodshot—and he looked right through Draco as though he wasn’t even there. His body trembled, and Draco could feel sparks of Harry’s magic pulsing weakly beneath the surface at irregular intervals.
Harry went to make it for her, but she insisted on making a cup for both herself and Harry. He went to set out the rubbish bin for collection instead. When he came back, he found her fast asleep with her head on the table, cigarette nearly burned down to her fingers. He stubbed it out, then carried her upstairs, laid her down in bed, took off her shoes, and covered her with a blanket.
, echoed throughout his mind—he’d waited forever to hear those words; never expected them to be spoken. Harry Potter, with his memories intact, would never have said them, not to Draco Malfoy. Was Draco brave enough to tell him the truth?
The next room is the billiard room. The tree is larger than the one in the lounge and very simply decorated: fairy lights that twinkle and an assortment of picture frame ornaments.
Harry’s just finished Malfoy’s face, his eyes moving of their own accord downward, tracing the delectable line where tendon meets clavicle. Harry has the urge to bite, to mar that perfect porcelain skin and leave his mark. Malfoy’s chest is chiselled to perfection; Bill ensures that his Curse-Breakers are in peak physical condition and Malfoy clearly has not skimped on training. A series of silver-white lines crosscut Malfoy’s chest, marks Harry left years ago, and he stares at them with a fascination formed from equal parts guilt and arousal. He wonders what it would feel like to run his fingers along each sinuous line, followed by his tongue. He draws them instead.
Petunia plunked herself down on the couch and smoked while she watched Harry work. Occasionally, she tapped the ash delicately into an overflowing ashtray. Goosebumps prickled along the back of Harry’s neck—he felt extremely exposed and self-conscious under her constant observation. He didn’t expect to be thanked, but it would have been nice. However, Petunia didn’t seem like a very warm person, so gratitude was unlikely, and she certainly wasn’t in a good place right now, especially if this Vernon person had recently died.
Fourth, he used to sleepwalk. Sometimes he would end up in the garden, and once Vernon found him at the end of Privet Drive at 4 am. That’s why he installed all the locks on his bedroom door—to keep Harry safe. This made Harry feel so loved.
“This is serious,” Draco snapped, resisting the urge to hex the vile cow. They were out in the open in a Muggle neighbourhood. “He needs help, more help than what a Muggle doctor can provide.” Petunia scowled, but Draco pressed onward. “He needs to go to St. Mungo’s, the wizarding hospital.”
They kiss feverishly, Draco stroking their cocks together, and Harry pulls back long enough to purr, “You feel so good.” His hands tangle in Draco’s hair and his breath catches as Draco adds a twist over the top. Harry rocks his hips into Draco’s fist, the drag of cock against cock within Draco’s firm grasp feels electric, the pleasure intensified by the warming sensation. It feels so good Harry doesn’t know how he’s still standing — why haven’t they moved to the bed? — but he also doesn’t want to move now that he’s so close. Pleasure coils in his belly and he tries to hold off, to prolong the rapture, but when Draco nips his lip, groaning as he comes, the pain and the added lubrication from Draco’s release push him over the edge. Harry cries out and comes hard, shuddering as Draco holds him tight. They cling to each other as their muscles clench and release.
Harry got up quickly. “Um… boxes! Yeah, I have to go pack in my room, I mean, unpack...” he stammered out, grabbing a random box.
He’s known about his cousin’s whereabouts for a long time. Death Eater or not, they’re still family, and secrets like these are ones he’d take to the grave.
Draco blinks his eyes open sleepily, as if the strength of Harry’s thoughts have woken him. Slowly, he smiles at Harry. Then he goes more alert and his eyes widen as he sits up, catching sight of Harry’s timer. “Fuck,” he says quietly.
“No. I wouldn’t do that,” Malfoy says, frowning at him. “I do try my best not to be a terrible person nowadays, Potter.”
As he watches Malfoy walk into the meeting room, black Unspeakable robes billowing around him, tall and lean and unfairly handsome as he strides over to where the rest of the Apprentices are standing—it all comes rushing back to Harry.
“Wait,” Harry says, and Malfoy stops. It takes Harry a moment to speak—the words building up in his chest are ones he’s terrified to let go.
“Unspeakable Malfoy,” Adams says sternly. “Sucking up is not going to get you anywhere in this department and you know that. Now move along to your rotation before I start to second guess whether or not you and Potter can be trusted to work together.”
Potter looks at him then with such emotion that Draco nearly has to look away. “You are,” he says, then repeats it, “You
Harry huffs, jealousy and shame sparking at his edges all at once. “If you’re so put off by me then, why even bother?”
Harry doesn’t relish the thought, so he crosses his arms and huffs a sigh. “It wasn’t pleasant, when we came down last time in the middle of—you know.” When they stopped loving each other in the middle of fucking, is what he means, but he can’t really say that aloud, can he?
Harry blinks a couple of times and nods, trying his best to focus on the first years as they walk into the Hall. They’re young, so much younger than he remembers being at the time, and in their faces he sees excitement and anxiety and hope. Hope for their futures, of being placed in the same houses as friends, hope for happiness and good fortune and learning about the most wondrous thing possible—magic.
“There, see? It’s like I was saying before. Just because you could hurt me doesn’t mean you will,” Harry shot back smugly.
Harry goes dizzy with wanting. “Have at me then,” he says, reaching forward to tug at Draco’s trousers, suddenly wanting to expedite the process of removing their clothes. He’d Vanish them if he didn’t think Draco would throw a fit.
. But this position is completely new, Harry all tied up, Malfoy’s hands at his hips and breath at his back—and so is the way that as soon as he bottoms out, Malfoy immediately starts slamming into him, harder than they usually fuck,
“Fuck,” Draco says, pulling away after a few moments, but he doesn’t go far. He looks down at the bracelet on his wrist. “This is probably dangerous.”
He hadn’t even noticed Potter come into the room, and he’s so frazzled that it takes him a moment before realizes what the mirror’s about to do—but the mirror’s already opened its stupid fucking invisible mouth.
Harry thinks back to the beginning, of when he’d first started wanting Draco so much he couldn’t bear it, and he laughs. “Yeah,” he says, grinning—and then, in a snap decision, he crawls down so he can take Draco’s cock into his mouth.
It’s not something he’s thought about in a long time. Honestly, he mostly considered himself to be over it years ago. He met Astoria and began researching her disease, and then from then on, he didn’t worry about anything else.
“Yeah, it did, actually,” Harry says, because—well, it didn’t end with scars or a broken nose, so that’s at least something, and with all things considered he thinks an unfortunate erection is relatively tame for how it usually is between them.
“Obviously,” Draco says, because they still bicker probably too much and also he thinks he’s been hiding approximately half of his feelings at any given time. “But your family already thinks we’re dating anyway, so we might as well.”
“Okay,” Draco says, feeling a little numb. Somewhere between the awful pain of the bond and the warmth of Potter’s arms, his anger seems to have receded, and he’s not sure he could get it back even if he wanted to.
Far from being surprised, Draco lets out a short laugh. “I thought she might,” he says, smoothing out his robes. “She gave me a couple of weird looks when I first started working at the hospital, so I assumed she knew something was different. I didn’t get it confirmed until now, though.”
want it. “I’m not going to complain either way, but. It seems...” He bites his lip. “It just seems like it’d be hot—to have you lose control.”
“No,” Harry says, feeling shaky. But then a thought appears in his head, sobering him. He bites his lip and then says it—“At any rate, it’s not like you could possibly be attracted to me.”
He has to think of how he hadn’t told anyone, not a soul, how much he wanted Potter not to hate him in sixth year. How he wanted Potter to turn to him and smile for once, to pull Draco aside and let Draco spill his soul to him, to maybe even sordidly kiss him, hidden in the dark behind a tapestry in the corridor.
“Fuck—!” Harry cries out, feeling suddenly like his limbs are made of gelatin. “S-sorry,” he mumbles, swaying in Draco’s grip.
Harry surveys their new living quarters. It’s smaller than the Gryffindor common room, all done in sand-colored wood and accented in cornflower blue, soft furniture and low tables scattered around. Despite no longer being in a tower, the room feels more open than he’s used to, possibly due to the one entire wall devoted to a large, floor-to-ceiling set of windows that looks out over the lake. And like Hermione said, it’s nice—much more peaceful and quieter than Harry’s used to.
“What the fuck is this?” Draco says, giving Blaise an appalled look as he tears the last bit of wrapping paper off of the long, bulky box Blaise just handed him. It’s the last one of his birthday presents. The others are stacked in a small, neat pile beside him—a cookbook from Greg, who is always trying to convince him that cooking is “
Harry grins. “It’s some sort of pheromone suppressor,” he explains. “Hermione said it tracks fairly tightly to your body—usually they use it for contagious patients. She wondered if it might work for some of your Veela symptoms.”
Draco shakes his head. “Certainly not,” he mutters. “I’d like to think my impulse control is better than that.”
She clucks at him, casting a couple of diagnostic charms, and Harry’s eyes are drawn to a new scar on her hand—a curse scar.
But that day, crumpled in the hallway at the Ministry, he hadn’t been stronger. Not at all. It’d been too fucking much and then he couldn’t breathe and he was alone alone
“If you’re going to invade my flat unannounced, you could at least Floo,” Harry says, frowning at him. He’s in the middle of cooking dinner.
what Lupin’s trying to do to him, not now, not when he’s been hiding away and going mad in this bloody safehouse for nearly a year while the war moves on without him. He’d do anything to get out of this place, and he hoped against hope that when Lupin mentioned visiting today, it might mean a treasured taste of freedom or even just seeing his friends again—
“Mm,” Potter hums noncommittally, and Draco expects him to get up then, but instead Potter adjusts his position and pulls him closer.
Draco thinks of the resounding pain he felt when Potter was barely several paces away and winces. Fine. Potter’s right. “What do you suggest, then?” he asks, even though he thinks he knows the answer and is dreading hearing it.
Malfoy stills, looking faintly distressed for the smallest of moments. “Of course I am,” he says, face hardening into steel. “Didn’t you know? It’s the Malfoy way.”
After a while, Harry rolls off of Draco, trying to catch his breath. He looks up at the sky, partially covered by the trees at the edge of their makeshift pitch. The wind, ever playful, is shifting the leaves artfully about. The sun alternates between hiding and blinding him, and he’s content.
Slowly, Draco sits up. He feels blurry, discombobulated, and he crawls off the bed and starts to find his clothes. Potter follows suit, and then they’re standing there, trembling, much too far apart.
He supposes it’s not even surprising. This is always how Malfoy has been to him, an unhealthy obsession, a puzzle that he wants desperately to crack, even as he continues to slip out of his grasp.
For a second, Harry says nothing, and Draco’s lungs seize in terror—but then Harry pushes at Draco’s hip, turning him over and climbing on top of him, and Draco can see that he’s smiling.
“All right,” Draco says, stunned a little. Potter’s never called him Draco before, and of course it’s just for show, but he has to fight to keep a straight face as they stand.
Feelings rushed around in his body, buzzing and tingling as he tried to pin them down. He knew he was
Potter lets out a pleased hum, and when his eyes go half-lidded Draco knows he’s about to kiss him, oh fuck. His entire body flashes warm with the thought, and his breath hitches as Potter leans closer.
When he finally pulls out, Harry almost expects him to immediately leave without looking back. But instead Malfoy slicks his hand and wraps around Harry’s cock instead, avoiding his eyes, stroking with a quick, sloppy rhythm that makes Harry shudder beneath him.
Potter’s so close. They aren’t touching, but all it would take is for Draco to tilt his head over, and he could be kissing him—
But he also knows that there’s really nothing he can do about it, because he’s gone and done the most outlandish, idiotic thing he’s ever done in his life—
He can’t believe this is happening—to think that he nearly gave it up, for pride or fear of not being wanted.
Hermione’s mouth hangs open. “The Hat... it’s going against the Founders in doing this, isn’t it? I can’t believe it...”
She leads him further into the stacks of prophecies, which are barely half in number as they’d been the first time Harry visited. Moore ostensibly blames Harry for that—which, yeah, is fair considering the DA knocked down several of the shelves and broke probably thousands of prophecies, but it’s still a bit annoying that it’s taken weeks for Harry to get in Moore’s good graces because of that.
“I thought you’d be out here. Why do you look so glum?” She tossed her hair behind her shoulder, striding to catch up with him.
“Don’t come any closer,” Draco says, and Harry can’t even begin to fathom why—maybe Draco is repulsed by him now, so much that he can’t even be in Harry’s presence. God.
Then Potter reaches out, fingers gentle, and touches Draco’s shaking elbow. “Hey,” Potter says, “It’s okay, it’s just me.”
,” Draco gasps, because it’s not just warm, it’s tingling, and at that point Potter seems to have found his prostate because he has to cry out at how good it feels.
“Oh,” Draco says, feeling distinctly ineloquent. His head is going all fuzzy from being so close to Potter, and he sips his tea, wishing that he could clear it.
Eventually Harry succeeds in pulling the book away, quickly turning so that Malfoy can’t reach it, except Malfoy still reaches for it anyway and then—
“There’s no way I’d be able to stop now,” Draco says, something predatory in his eyes. “I want to make you mine.”
“Listen, Potter,” Draco says, and for a moment he looks desperate. “I won’t be indebted to you. Not again.”
As for Draco… Harry’s not sure what that conversation meant to him, if anything at all. But he does know that Draco started giving him a curt nod of greeting when they saw each other in the corridors, which makes him think that at least their relationship was strengthened that night.
“Harry, don’t—don’t think about that,” Draco tells him, knocking their foreheads together. “You don’t have to think of it for now.”
Draco opens his mouth to say something, anything, and is surprised to find his breath coming out all ragged like he’s been stabbed. He should’ve seen this coming, but he didn’t, and that makes it worse.
Potter only holds him tighter. “I won’t,” he says, and even though Draco knows it has to be an empty promise, he feels better all the same.
They sit on Draco’s couch, and Potter is uncharacteristically silent for a moment—he seems nervous, Draco thinks. It’s strange. Usually Potter is all bluster and bravado.
Merlin. There was no way he could be attracted to Malfoy. Except… it seemed he was truly, seriously attracted to Malfoy.
“Okay,” Draco says, smiling softly. “And in the meantime, we can finish prepping our lesson plans. First term started a week ago, you know.”
Draco pauses. “Actually…” He looks Potter up and down, noting the way Potter is most definitely hardening in his pants, and thinks briefly of Potter wanking off in front of him. His mouth goes dry.
Harry laughs breathily, letting his eyes trail over Draco’s body, all pale skin and reddened lips and grey eyes that are looking, staring at Harry again. Waiting.
He may have no idea what the hell happened last night but at least, here and now, Potter wants him back.
“You can go ahead now,” he tells Draco, motioning to the shower, and Draco nods and heads into the loo, shutting the door behind him.
“If you don’t recall, at the time I was devastated about the end of my marriage,” Draco retorts with a scowl. “So excuse me if I didn’t have the time of my life in your oh-so-loving arms.”
“You were partnered with him during the summer rebuild, right? Occasionally?” Hermione asks, and Harry nods—he’d mentioned it off-handedly to Ron and Hermione, but hadn’t elaborated much. “What... what was he like?”
“I know,” Malfoy says, looking away. “I didn’t... I couldn’t...” He shakes his head. “I’ve thought that for a long time, okay? And when you first found me out on the front steps back then—I didn’t fucking know what to do about it.”
This is wrong, he knows, but even as he tells himself that, he can’t stop himself from walking out into the cool night, from following Malfoy and the other man discreetly into the alleyway. Malfoy leads the man further down into the shadows, almost out of sight, and then he presses him up against the brick and kisses him.
Part of Draco wondered when Potter would finally show up at his door. The other part of him is surprised to see him here, especially since it’s been a fair bit of time since they’ve spoken.
Draco nods, barely able to think as Potter assaults him with kisses. He’s fully hard now, gasping as Potter lowers his hips to Draco’s, and Draco lets his legs fall open, pulls his knees up, moans, “
“I knew you would say yes when I asked about the portrait,” Malfoy tells him. “I knew you would help me. But I really hoped to be able to learn quickly and have it be over with, so I could...” He sighs. “So I could stop bothering you. Except I’m bloody useless at painting, and now you’re—I don’t even know what you’re doing. You’re being
Maybe it’s a bad idea, but if he does it quickly enough, Draco won’t even notice. Anyway, the glass wall of the shower is already fogged from when Harry was in there, so it shouldn’t be a problem.
Draco crosses the room to sit on Harry’s bed, raising an eyebrow. “Don’t tell me this wasn’t what you were thinking when you invited me over to stay the night.”
“Oh,” Draco says, eyes wide, startled at the change in location. Then a slow smile grows on his face. “Are you taking me to bed, Harry?”
“But,” Draco says, “You have other things to care about.” Like winning the war, like offing Voldemort, like protecting everyone else he loves from people like Draco. Things more important than the two of them, more important than Potter’s own life.
Harry nods, handing her the last couple dishes to be put away and moving over to their kitchen table so he can slump into a chair. Hermione follows, sitting next to him, putting a comforting hand on his arm.
“Sounds infuriating. What did you do to them?” Draco murmurs, tapping the seconds on the inside of Harry’s thigh.
Harry probably wouldn’t have asked it if he knew that the answer was going to make things so complicated.
Then Malfoy continues his casting, and Harry is left with a heat in his veins that has nothing to do with the warming charm he cast before he undressed.
“Potter, I swear, if you don’t stop...” Malfoy says, seeming almost frantic, and Harry pauses. Malfoy’s face is flushed, which is rather amusing in the moment, and Harry marvels that if he’d known taking his clothes off was enough to render Malfoy speechless, he might’ve tried it ages ago.
That night they crawl into bed, and Potter finally holds him close, and Draco is embarrassed at just how fast he curls into Potter’s embrace.
They land on Draco’s bed, Harry on top of him, laughing at Draco’s incredulous expression. “You’re mad,” Draco says in horror, “Absolutely mad,
It was shortly after Ron stopped coming out when Harry started to think that maybe Draco felt just as out of place as Harry did.
Harry blinks rapidly, his head spinning. His body aches like he’s been hit by a bludger, and he reaches immediately for his wand, scanning the room wildly for whoever attacked him.
, at this point. “I just never really thought about it before, and... now that I have, I can’t unthink it.”
“Oh I will,” Draco says, shucking his trousers and pants off once they’re undone. “But—just so you know... You do know I won’t bite you during sex, right?”
Draco snorts, standing. “Come here,” he instructs, and Harry stands and goes to him. “You’re as subtle as ever,” Draco says.
“I don’t have to—I know you want it,” Harry tells him, forcing his voice into one that’s more authoritative, body hot with arousal as he picks up his wand. “But I’ll spell them off if I have to.”
Harry snorts, shrugging out of his rain jacket and hanging it on the hook with his umbrella. “You mean he drank a bit too much last night,” he says, and Esther hangs her head sheepishly and nods.
Draco presses his forehead into the pillow in front of him, feeling more vulnerable and exposed than when Harry first saw him naked.
He tosses and turns that night, feeling torn and desperate and alone, hating the fact that Malfoy sleeps only a few metres away.
Draco groans again, and he licks his lips, taking a deep breath. “I bought a dildo recently so I could fuck myself with it while I think of you.”
“Probably,” Malfoy says, a flicker of amusement in his expression. “Anyway, what I’m saying is—shall we make some sort of truce? For gatherings like this, at least. I don’t fancy having to be on my toes the whole time I’m out with Pansy, and well… she’s been spending most of her time with you lot, so. If we could agree not to hex each other, that would be grand.”
there—it could’ve been a friend’s place. Or a lover’s, he thinks, with a frustrated twist in his chest that feels almost like jealousy.
So Harry has no distraction from the fact that he wants to kiss him, has wanted to kiss him for weeks. The longing is particularly strong now, pulsing in his chest with every step they take, and Harry feels like he might burn up from the heat in his chest as Draco finds his hand.
“I... I don’t think I want to be an Auror,” he admits, pain in his throat as he looks up at Hermione.
His heart cracks in his chest when Potter avoids his eyes as they crawl into bed. He feels like he’s teetering, hanging over the edge of a cliff, with Potter the only thing keeping him from freefall—and Potter’s about to let him go.
His stomach turns. “It was years ago,” he says, trying to shut them down as quickly and efficiently as possible. He hates this the most of all.
Harry sighs in relief, pulling out his notes on the tenants of broomstick manufacturing that Hermione had helped him research late last night.
His heartbeat starts racing as Malfoy slowly starts working it inside him. Fuck, Harry can’t even tell how big it is with his face to the wall like this—all he knows is the slick sounds of the thing sliding in him, the feeling of its tapered sides working him more and more open, and Merlin, he’s so fucking
“I think that sounds like a good idea, actually,” Ron says, smoothing his hand up and down Hermione’s back. “I’m bloody tired of researching, you know, and I bet even you are, ‘Mione. Why don’t we go to the pub?”
Usually he’s able to brush it off, to at least pretend like Potter’s ugly expressions aren’t upsetting him—but this time is different, because Potter doesn’t even give him the chance to pretend nothing happened.
“No. Here,” Malfoy says, and then moments later he’s spreading his legs wider and leaning himself back and positioning himself over Harry’s cock—
“I’m mad about you,” Harry says, gazing down at him. Then he nudges Draco’s legs apart, waiting for Draco to pull his knees up before positioning himself.
Inside is a plain leather banded bracelet with a metal clasp. “It’s charmed with something Hermione taught me,” Harry says. “I dunno if it’ll do anything, but you should try it and see anyway.”
Harry nods, and then he braces himself for the inevitable wave of rejection to start slowly crushing him.
“It’s been a long time,” Potter says when Draco pulls him to the creaky bed, and Draco nods and swallows his doubts and tries to pretend that it’s been a long time for him too, that this isn’t his first time ever, that it wasn’t always Potter he’d wanted to do it with in the first place.
“I’m fine,” Draco says brusquely, and unfortunately Potter’s talking to him now and so he has to open his eyes and look at him.
That last thought—that Malfoy didn’t even know he was there—makes Harry feel a bit guilty, and he pulls away slightly with a sigh.
So Potter comes and sits on the very edge of his bed, perched in a way that looks nervous, almost uncomfortable. He’s poised to flee, Draco thinks.
He continues going through the rooms one by one—he’d seen all of them during their initial tour, but after that the Trainees had mostly been confined to the various Unspeakable meeting rooms for lectures and study and testing, so it’s been a while since he’s looked through everything. Space, with its hovering planets, Time, glittering and full of possibilities, the Hall of Prophecies, many shelves less full than when he’d been here in his youth, and so on and so on until he hits Love—
“You made it easy,” Potter tells him, raising a hand briefly as if to reach out to Draco, but then changing his mind and pulling away, grimacing as he looks down at the mess that’s covering his fingers. “Er. Mind if I use your loo?”
“I dunno,” Harry says. “Just not here.” Then he spares one glance at the dais before grabbing Malfoy’s arm and Apparating them to the first place he can think of—his flat.
Draco considers it, and Harry feels like he might burst with the longing that’s building up inside of him. Finally, Draco opens his mouth, a small smile appearing on his lips. “I suppose that would be all right.”
Draco stares at him. “You should be,” he says sullenly, but then his shoulders relax just the slightest bit. “But... all right,” he says. He sets the empty potion down on the bedside table. “I mean, I liked it—of course I did. It was just dangerous.”
Draco sighs, looking nervous. “I need to bite you,” he says, and it comes out nearly like a growl. “On the neck.”
manual labor, absolutely despises the bugs and the filth and the need to get his hands dirty that all come with the task. But he grins and bears it (well, heavily grimaces and bears it, anyway) for one sole reason, which is in fact a fairly big part of why he loves this job so much in general—
Malfoy shakes his head, pushing himself up out of the chair. “Whatever, Potter. If you don’t want to talk about this like an adult, then yes, don’t mention it to anyone else.”
“Common knowledge, honestly. You know how the Hogwarts rumor mill went,” Draco says loftily, and snickers when Harry curses again.
Malfoy would make that assumption. He snatches the brush from Malfoy’s hand and examines it, picking up his wand and casting a couple of diagnostic spells. “This has been tampered with,” he says after a moment, furrowing his brow. “There’s an extra layer of magic that’s not supposed to be there.”
George gives Harry a slow nod. “Interesting,” he says, a smirk growing on his face. “I can see it, though.”
Harry smiles at him, heart fluttering like the wings of a pixie in his chest. “It’s nothing, really.”
“Yes,” Draco says, and for once he doesn’t feel guilty for being a good liar. He can’t look at him. He can’t. “I’d like to be alone.”
“Why not?” Harry asks, arching a brow. “It’ll help, right?” Swiftly, he unloops the tie from around his neck, draping it over the chair behind him before undoing his robes.
“Yes,” Harry says. “I do mean it. We don’t have to kiss, or hold hands, or—or anything, if that’s what you need.”
“Barely,” Malfoy says, though he can’t seem to mask the small bit of hope in his voice. “I suppose—I suppose it helped.”
“Yes,” Harry says, and then he helps Malfoy shove them off and away, his pants going with them. Then he takes Malfoy’s off too, leaving them bare from the waist down under the covers, and fuck, it’s nerve-wracking—
They’re both tired, he thinks. Maybe that’s why this is happening, that and the couple of months of having their bodies pressed close together while they sleep, of Draco reveling in as much of Potter’s touch as he could get. Still, Draco’s terrified and blown away all at once when Potter sits up to pull his own shirt off, when Potter lies down again and starts kissing Draco’s neck and collarbones and Draco can’t hold back his gasps.
His jaw drops open as he reads, ‘URGENT: ALL MAGICAL NEIGHBORHOODS ON HIGH ALERT IN WAKE OF OVERNIGHT VIRUS EPIDEMIC,’ and then the sub-headline,
In front of him, the Amortentia shimmers, and again he smells Astoria, fleeting like her voice in the morning when she calls him to breakfast.
“For the time being,” Lupin said. Sure. That’s what they said when they locked Harry in the safehouse too.
“Get what over with?” Malfoy asks smugly. “What, did you think I was going to stick my cock in you?”
A warm sensation spreads through Harry’s body, starting oddly at his palm and then spreading through his wrist, up his arm, and straight into his heart.
Most likely it was just Draco’s lust-addled brain projecting his desires in the spur of the moment. But… what if it
He just hopes from the bottom of his heart that there’s a light at the end of this tunnel for her to hold out for.
When he finally sees Malfoy again, over a month later, he almost doesn’t believe it. He blinks, expecting Malfoy to disappear, no more than a late night hallucination—but Malfoy stays, sat on the stoop in a white Muggle dress shirt and trousers, cigarette in hand.
“Harry,” Draco sighs, pressing him backwards until Harry’s knees hit the sofa, and he bends obligingly, letting Draco lay him down and whimpering as Draco crawls on top of him. “You’re so—fuck…”
Malfoy comes back and hands him a glass, and Harry is thankful for the coolness of it against his skin. He stares at the ice cubes Malfoy’s put in it this time, two of them, clinking around against each other as he takes a sip. It’s not whiskey this time—it’s something else, something sweet and spicy and comforting, and he savors the feeling of it in his throat as he waits for Malfoy to say something.
He can’t quite bear to look at Potter as Potter takes his arm to Apparate—Potter doesn’t need to know that the reason Draco’s chosen his own flat is so that he can at least smell Potter on his sheets when Potter inevitably leaves afterwards.
Well, here went nothing. “There’s someone else in training this summer, and… it’s Draco. He’s going to be the new Potions professor. I have to get along with him now, so… er, be nice?” he asked, cringing internally.
—” Harry groans, quietly panicking because part of his mind is saying that they shouldn’t be doing this. But the rest of his mind is telling him to wrap his arms around Draco’s waist and tug him closer, so he does.
“Just trust me,” Malfoy tells him. Then he slumps backwards onto the bed, hitting the mattress with a thump. “I’m going to hate myself in the morning.”
“Like you can talk,” Harry mutters. “You’re literally a vampire. You can’t even be out during the day.”
“Really?” Hermione says. But then she tilts her head, thinking, and says, “You know, I can see that, on account of his background and all. I can imagine he wouldn’t particularly like to be bound to anything, or anyone.”
“It’s just—even the Muggles haven’t devised a way to change genes in already-developed humans. And the magical chromosome has never been mapped out because half of the Healers out there don’t even know it exists—it’s just. It’s hopeless,” Hermione says, staring at the floor.
Draco goes to hold him then, folding his arms around him, and it’s only then that Harry realizes he’s crying.
Harry can’t even begin to decide what Malfoy means by that, so when Malfoy turns and walks toward the curtain, Harry lets him. But just before Malfoy reaches the edge of the Muffliato, Harry opens his mouth. “I already told Ron and Hermione. Back then, I mean. Just so you know.”
Malfoy stares at him, mouth rounded into a little ‘o’, and Harry is reminded unfairly of just how beautiful he is. “I...” Malfoy says, blinking. “Really?”
Harry sits up too, his jaw working, trying to think of a response. Finally, he settles on, “I don’t want to do that if you’re doing it out of some sense of—of what, justice?”
But that’s never enough for Officer MacDowell, who locks Draco every three months into his tiny office that’s mere yards from the entrance to the prison cells of Azkaban, the only way out a Portkey back to the Ministry. MacDowell berates him for every little misstep, hurls slurs at him and belittles his family and does everything he can to abuse Draco just short of actually causing him physical pain. And Draco is forced to sit and bear it, lest he lose his temper and
. Draco reaches a hand down to touch his cock and is surprised when his knuckles knock against Potter’s—then Potter pushes his hand away and wraps his own fingers around Draco, still slick with lube, and Draco cries out, bucking his hips forward into Potter’s hand, throat growing hoarse as he groans.
“Yes, Daph visits sometimes, but it’s not nearly enough.” She shrugs half-heartedly. “Sometimes I feel like I’m losing my mind.”
For a moment Potter looks hesitant. Then he reaches out and starts to rub Draco’s back again, and Draco has to hide his shock, even as he can’t resist leaning into it.
And maybe this was what Draco was trying to prevent, but it hurts like hell anyway. Because all Harry wants to do is to hug him, to press his face into Draco’s shoulder and breathe in his scent and have Draco stroke his back.
He stands up and does something extremely dangerous, Apparating to Potter’s flat without being sure of where it is. But somehow he lands in one piece, right in the middle of Potter’s sitting room, and there’s Potter, sitting on the couch, looking at him in horror.
Harry wonders what it would be like if they weren’t in the middle of a war—if they were allowed to just be two people with chemistry, with wants and needs like everyone else—but he supposes they’d never be together without some amount of baggage, and at any rate he thinks it’s probably the war-soaked desperation that led him to want Malfoy in the first place. He’s not sure he could even stand to be around him if he were still the Malfoy of years ago, proud and arrogant and missing that hint of franticness that Harry now identifies with so well.
It’s a dirty habit, isn’t it, staring at one’s boss half-naked while he works in rich wizarding gardens?
He’ll have things to look forward to. France is home to some of the largest broom manufacturing companies in the whole wizarding world, and even though Harry doesn’t quite have a plan yet, he has some ideas, some people to call.
“I’m a wanted fugitive, Harry. You can’t stay here forever. They’ll find out sooner or later. And this... being here like this isn’t good for you.”
Draco leads him over to the bed, undoing Harry’s necktie before helping him up into it, and Harry lies down gingerly on his stomach, minding the plug. “You okay?” Draco asks, perching next to him, hands smoothing over one of Harry’s thighs before beginning to massage it.
“Sorry,” Harry says, watching as Malfoy casts the distinctive swirl that Harry knows from asking acts as the ‘undo’ charm. When Malfoy doesn’t answer his question, continuing with the painting instead, Harry continues speaking. “I mean, I’ve come here every other night for a couple of weeks now, and... I dunno. I just thought we ought to be friends now.”
“Because,” Draco says, and is this what self-sacrifice feels like? This awful pain in his chest? “I don’t want you to.”
“Tell me how it feels,” Harry says, forcing himself to stop wanking for now, because if he touches his cock now he thinks he might come,
conversation that he avoids Draco entirely at work. It gets so bad that even Ron notices, remarking nonchalantly that Draco hasn’t been by their shared desk space lately, and Harry’s almost worked up the courage to say something to Draco about it when Draco makes a move first.
“I have to weave in quite a bit of Muggle-repelling magic, usually.” Harry picks up a sponge he’d been working on charming to self-Soap for a demonstration, casting the spell he uses to visualize all of the charms on an object. They light up, glowing around the sponge in their usual network of webby looking magic traces, and Harry points out the Muggle-repelling spells, which are a bright pink. “I try to color code all the spells that go together. It makes it easier later on.”
Ginny rolled her eyes, though her face was amused. “Fine, I’m sure you’ll tell me later… Come on, let’s keep walking! I have exciting news.”
He’d expected to see a picture of Potter in the showers, just as he’d been that day, or maybe a vision of Potter wanking at best. He would’ve been happy enough with that, he thinks.
fine. He hates that part of him still feels warm when he hears Draco’s voice—he hates even more that Draco can tell how nervous he is, hates that he
It’s softer than Harry remembered, or maybe Draco’s just being gentler with him, but either way it’s everything he’s wanted in the past few days. Harry sighs, sliding his hand up Draco’s cheek—
But now it’s warm and quiet, the charmed windows all around the large chamber showing the sun as it goes down, setting the room ablaze with the warm colors of a sunset.
the letter was done and after checking it over she decided that it was the best that it was going to get
Harry and Draco looked at each other for a bit before Hermione decided that her and Harry need to have a long over due talk about everything, she knew that harry wanted talk to but that he would never just leave after been told and finding out what he just had, it just wasn't in Harry's nature to do that, he would want to talk to the person that told him and not just leave it on a ' hey lets be friends after everything thing that we've said and done'.
Harry was kind of happy that he had said yes to trying to be friends with Draco if only because it seemed like the best way to go, you cant just go from being enemies to being boyfriends, can you? you need to go slow with that type of thing, sure harry had feelings for Draco but he knew nothing about him apart from what he was shown when they fought and that wasn't the best kind of way to base Draco's personality on. " come on hermione, we better go find Ron, he might be looking for us or with the headmaster and we nee to make them think that we know nothing about whats going on" he said, hoping that he could keep at least a little bit friendly when seeing Ron again. “ yeah, I wonder if he’ll say anything about you leaving?” Hermione says and it raises questions that Harry didn’t want to think about, how was he going to be able to lie to Ron? you don't hang out with and live with someone for years even If your going to back stab them and not know when they lie to you.
I've just found them, I say found but the only reason I know that they are here is because I heard harry talking in a low voice, I wasn't even thinking about letting them know that i was here till i heard what was said by the blood traitor that I cant help the loud "WHAT" that leaves my mouth, making them know  that I'm here.
hi again! I'm hoping that the few that have seen the first chapter enjoyed it( thanks for reading it, I'm really thankful)
Ginny was on her way back to the common room after saying goodbye to her father, on the way she was stopped by Ron, he didn’t look angry at her for talking Harry into leaving with her earlier and that fact kind of scared her, she would of preferred him to be angry, like she would really like him to be at least a little bit angry at her but no, here he was standing in front  of her as calm as could be. " Ron?" Ginny asked, her eyebrow raising, it didn't raise that far but Ron would see it of that she was sure. " I want you to give a message to Harry, I've saw that things while helping mum and the headmaster that id really like to make up for, and none of you need to believe me but I thought that I could spy on them from now on." Ron says and as good as he is with plans, he couldn't lie his way into the good graces of someone that had known him for as long as she had. " I can bring it up to him but I cant say that hell trust you even if he lets you back." Ginny says with a smile, that was strained and didn't reach her eyes like it normally did.
Ginny was a bit taken back by the name that harry near whispered when he was barrel hugged by Hermione or harmony as harry called her, she knew that there was a reason and the look that she had on her face said that she wasn't really shocked that he knew the name and more that he used it, what in merlin's name was happening, she had been told from a young age that the potters had twins but that the girl died soon after she was born but that didn't seem to  be the case and now that she thought about it nobody seemed to recall the girl, they also never said anything about her when harry was around, Fred and George always seemed to hang out with harry and she knew that they liked him as a brother, the fact that they were twins and would know what it felt like to even thing about losing the other probably fueling them to be the protective older brothers they were with him, by blood or not, they would face the dark lord for him of that she knew, the same could be said for her father, he would do anything he could for family and harry was family.  Ginny came out of her thoughts just in time to see Harry hold his hand out to Draco and a small smile saying that he wanted to be friends like the should have been since first year, the thought of them been friends from first year made her heart hurt because harry might not have saved her if he didn't know Ron, she didn't want to think that but she knew that it was the truth, but that was nobody's fault but her own, she should have been herself and not some fangirl nobody that ran whenever they saw him, great way to become friends with somebody, it all worked out for the best thought and she know was happy to have Harry try to be friends with Draco, he needed new friends any way and if he made the effort then she would too. she smiles too when Draco takes the offered hand.
“I thought I heard the door open,” Hermione says, nodding. “I assumed I was dreaming. Why? Was everything okay?”
Harry wonders in the early hours of the morning, lying on Ron and Hermione’s couch where he’s barely moved from the entire weekend, how much trouble he would get in if he simply… stopped going to work.
Draco laughs. “No. Stay here,” he says, stopping Potter as he tries to climb off of Draco by snatching his wand. Then he tosses the wand lightly across the room. “But no more drunk casting for you.”
Draco can’t do anything but wait until the wanting buries him alive, until his throat is on fire, burning him from the inside out.
“I. Am. Not.” Draco spoke through gritted teeth. “Harry Potter, I am going to Azkaban. For life. Don’t you get it? The fucking Minister couldn’t get me out of this. And I don’t want to rot in there, Harry!”
“Hm.” Malfoy begins painting, and Harry assumes that the conversation is over until Malfoy pauses briefly in his spellcasting. “You should look into broom manufacturing. It’s rather interesting.”
Malfoy gave him an exasperated look, pulling his nightrobes tightly around himself. “I’m here for the CRAP event, same as you. War reparations and all that rot. And then you—“ he cut off as Harry started laughing. “What the hell, Potter?”
,” he says, trying to swing at Potter again, but Potter manages to grab onto his arm and hold him back. He wrenches out of Potter’s grip. “It’s all your
“Oh,” Draco says, feeling surprised and embarrassed and so happy that he could almost cry. He pulls Harry close and kisses him, and for this one moment, he holds on as tightly as he can.
Draco stops right in the middle of a story about one of the first times he went flying, staring at him, eyes wide.
The Amortentia didn’t improve anything either, he’s sure. All it’s done in the end is make Draco guarded and unreachable.
Instead he curls closer to Malfoy, wrapping an arm around his sweat-sticky skin even when Malfoy makes a noise of annoyance, pulling the covers up over them. He holds him even though his heart pounds raggedly in his chest, even though Malfoy is stiff in his arms when only moments ago he’d been almost warm.
Fuck. “No—no,” Harry says, shaking his head, and maybe Harry did want that at the beginning, just a little bit. But he knows instinctively that if it had been anyone but Malfoy sitting on that stoop, he wouldn’t have given them another thought. “It’s...” He looks at Malfoy. “It’s because it was you, I think. Not in spite of it.”
Harry’s prepared to lie, except then he looks over at Draco and Draco is starting to look offended and maybe a little hurt. “Sorry,” he says quickly. “I, er...”
“Fine. You have one minute,” Draco drawls. “After which, I am going to completely demolish you, Harry Potter.” The last words are a murmur against his neck, and Harry shivers.
The next time Harry gets the courage to sit down at Malfoy’s table at dinner, Malfoy arches his brow but doesn’t try to make him leave.
Harry stands in front of the door to Draco’s room. He has half a mind to turn around and walk straight back out before Draco sees him through the small window in the door, but if he leaves, he won’t be able to come back easily. Hermione let him in so that he didn’t have to alert Draco he was coming. He’d been worried that Draco would deny him on the spot.
There’s barely room in the Hogwarts class schedule for the eighth years as is, and Harry... Harry’s probably too distracted to really even do well in his courses, but that’s the least of his worries, considering how hard it is just for him to climb out of bed every morning.
Behind him, Malfoy’s silent for a moment. When Harry peeks back to look at him, he’s able to tell that Malfoy’s on his knees, but taller than normal—he’s probably sitting on top of the footstool.
To be fair, they’re more business partners than anything, and Potter hates when Draco calls him his boss. Which is precisely why Draco continues to do it.
He won’t be seeing Draco again, and from what the letter sounded like, Draco doesn’t even want to be friends anymore.
Malfoy frowns. “I no longer have a home,” he says, and then instead of explaining what he means by that, he stalks out of the room, heading over to sit at Harry’s kitchen table.
“It’s a similar method of capture,” Draco tells him. “At least, I assume you’re utilizing the Dodson 1465 materialization algorithm?” he addresses Hermione.
He’d tossed and turned all night the night before. As much as he hated it, Malfoy was all he could think about, Malfoy pressing him up against the wall and pressing his lips to Harry’s neck, so fucking close—
“Potentially,” Malfoy says vaguely, and Harry makes the mistake of looking up just as Malfoy’s swallowing back some of his drink, his Adam’s apple bobbing above the line of his collar. His shirt buttons are done all the way up today, and Harry has a sudden and intense urge to walk over and unbutton the top couple, to loosen him up a bit. Malfoy catches his eye then, raising his eyebrow in question. “What?”
Draco clears his throat, which is suddenly dry as the conversation moves on in front of them. “This was a long time ago.”
Draco’s throat goes tight. “Sentimental prat,” he mutters, trying to deflect the sudden sadness that wants to swallow him whole.
Harry takes a quick look around the shop to make sure there aren’t any customers. Then he walks up to Draco, checking that Esther is indeed watching, and presses him into a nearby shelf, kissing him soundly.
this. Who would’ve known that you secretly wanted to be tied up, right here, where anyone could find us? Ha! Pervert.”
In response, Potter moves closer, until his body is pressed all up against Draco’s back. And then Draco’s eyes widen for a different reason, because suddenly the pain is completely and totally gone.
Potter—Draco finally lets his eyes drift shut, lets himself fully experience the sensations of Potter touching him as Potter bottoms out, hips pressing flat against Draco’s arse.
“That’s fine,” Draco says. “Owl me when you’re free and I can come up. I’ll help research too, if necessary.”
“All right now, Potter, we’re done with foreplay,” Malfoy says, sounding oh-so-pleased with himself as he crouches down behind Harry. His smarmy attitude is driving Harry positively fucking insane—it shouldn’t be this sexy, but it
“It was tolerable,” Draco says, and then because he’s trying to stay on Potter’s good side, he adds, “Molly is nice.”
Draco’s lips slide against his own, again and again until Harry’s dizzy and hot, his body caught between Draco’s and the counter. He can’t believe they’ve never done this before. How had he never known how good it was to kiss Draco, to have him warm and close and intimate like this?
“Tell me,” Draco says, terrified, staring straight at him, at those green eyes he adores so much—“Tell me the truth.”
His heart starts racing. Has someone Polyjuiced as Draco, just to calm Harry down? It’s a brilliant idea, maybe one of Hermione’s, although he wonders how they found out about him and Draco having been lovers. But now that he’s realized the truth, he feels uncomfortable with someone else in his bed, and he starts to shove away.
Harry’s throat feels a little dry, and he coughs. “You could say that. We were in the same class at Hogwarts. We weren’t friends, though.”
“I’m a coward,” Draco says, looking up at Harry and feeling ashamed. “I could never have said anything.”
“Well good, because I’m ready,” Draco says, and God, it’s happening so fast. He pulls his fingers out with a wet squelch that makes Harry shudder. “I—erm. Just to warn you,” Draco adds, looking embarrassed. “My wings might come out.”
“I like this,” Harry says after a moment, smoothing his thumb over the back of Draco’s hand, making Draco’s chest go all fluttery.
Draco’s head is swimming. He takes out a piece of parchment. Hand shaking, he writes a few words, scribbles some out, then writes some more. Then he turns it face down and leaves it on the table.
It’s worth it, for the way Potter’s eyes go all soft. “Yeah,” he says, smiling as if Draco’s just given him some sort of gift.
“We’re going to have to share a bed, aren’t we?” Potter asks, completely ignoring what Draco’s just said.
They stand there in the corner near the bar until both of them are done with their drinks. Then Draco Vanishes the cups, looking at Potter with no small amount of uncertainty—what’s going to happen now? Surely Potter won’t
Harry shudders. “Fuck,” he says. “Okay.” He wants to kiss Malfoy more than he ever has, but Malfoy doesn’t want it,
“You didn’t cover me up last night,” the mirror remarks, speaking in its own voice for a change. “Interesting.”
“I rather thought you might’ve grown closer,” she murmurs, and he nods, turning his face to the side to breathe—this, he can’t hide. “Did he decide not to come today?”
Grief cinches in his throat, and even after so many months it feels like he can barely breathe. He dreams every night of the expression on her face when the curse hit her, like she was screaming for help with no sound, but Ron was too far away and Harry wasn’t fast enough—
He knows immediately that he doesn’t want to risk that. He’ll do whatever it takes, he thinks, to figure out what exactly Malfoy’s getting at with this stupid air of nonchalance. He’s always been a little obsessed with Malfoy, and it feels like here, out in the quiet, chilly Knockturn night, he might almost be able to have him.
“Fuck, that’s hot,” Potter mutters, and Draco wants to give in but then Potter’s smirking at him, and Salazar, he’s going to have to
because people keep getting sick, and God, and I’m so bloody tired!” She shakes her head, looking miserable as she turns and trudges over to the sofa, sitting next to Ron. Ron puts his arm around her, holding her close for a moment, and Harry turns away.
Draco clenches his jaw and looks at Potter, thinking he understands but not believing it one bit. “What do you want from me, Potter?” he asks, his voice suddenly hoarse.
Harry nodded. “Yeah. It’s kind of a relief, you know? Something I thought I would never be rid of… How are you with fire, now?”
next to him, and somehow the covers got tossed aside and there’s only a sheet covering them, doing nothing to hide that Potter also seems to have morning wood, and Potter’s just
His hand flies to his wand to cast the spell, but it’s too late—Malfoy’s already spotted him, his eyebrows flicking upwards for the briefest of moments. Harry casts the Notice-Me-Not anyway. The other man still hasn’t seen him, and though Malfoy briefly trains his eyes on Harry, he doesn’t give him away.
He looks up at Malfoy just in time to see the faint flush in his cheeks. “I didn’t,” Malfoy says, but Harry can’t help grinning at him.
“It would be bloody fantastic if—” Draco stops, then lowers his voice, as if he’s telling a secret—“If I could stop wanting it so damn much.”
Draco suddenly feels frozen, even as Harry continues to move inside him, insisting on thawing him out with every press of his hips.
Draco gives a small, tight shake of his head, and shoves the thoughts of how fond he’s growing of Potter right now out of his brain. “Later, maybe. I don’t want to have to explain this to her,” he says, gesturing between them, which is at least partially the truth.
“Hullo, Esther,” he waves, spelling himself dry from the rain and cursing the fact that he lost his umbrella a week ago and hadn’t bothered to try and find it since. Except—hang on, isn’t that it, right over there behind the counter?
“What the hell are you talking about, Malfoy? I hate it! I’ve always hated it, and I’d love to be rid of it forever if I could! People always looking at me like that, and trying to talk to me, and—“
Potter eyes him quizzically. Then, slowly, he reaches his hand out and smooths a knuckle over Draco’s cheek.
“Quiet now,” McGonagall says, tapping her wand against the podium, and the chatter in the room quickly dies down. McGonagall looks over them, something unreadable in her eyes, and lets out a long sigh. “There are thirteen of you,” she says, and Harry skims the room to confirm that it’s indeed true.
to move, especially when he feels the warmth of Malfoy’s breath ghosting over his arsehole—fuck, they’ve never done this before, Harry never even knew Malfoy
When the end of the workday finally comes, he Apparates straight to Mungo’s, planning on taking supper in Astoria’s room. He hopes she’ll only need to stay a night or two, now that she’s awake, although he assumes they’ll want to run more tests on her before she leaves.
Draco stares back, taking in all of him, smooth planes of skin the shade of coffee with cream, unruly hair and glasses slightly askew. He’s… he’s gorgeous.
He has to force himself to tear his eyes away from Malfoy, sitting alone in the front row of desks. But it’s hard. His subconscious keeps telling him that if he keeps his eyes on Malfoy at all times, he can avoid him better... right?
“Oh, come off it,” says Trainee Four, his voice and face carefully disguised by the Identity-Masking Charms that shield all of their identities. The Unspeakables take anonymity almost frighteningly seriously, especially where Trainees are concerned. “You'll be fine if you stop whinging about it long enough to actually study.”
. Harry comes right then and there, shaking and gasping as he spills between them, causing Draco to laugh in surprise.
Harry thinks he might explode with all the feelings building in his chest, tumbling through his veins and filling him with longing, with love, with joy. “Oh, Draco,” he says, and this time when he smiles, Draco smiles back.
But Potter’s already saved him once, sheltering him from the heat of the Fiendfyre. He can’t burden Potter again.
“What do you want?” he asks gruffly, casting a quick surveillance spell to ensure there’s no one else around. It comes up empty—for now, at least.
It’s honestly more than he’d expected, to be able to look Malfoy in the eyes, to reach over and link their fingers together without Malfoy protesting.
the smirk in his words. “Why yes, Potter, I think I might. After all…” He reaches around and wraps his fingers around Harry’s cock, stroking it once, and Harry fights not to whine as he bucks his hips into the touch. “You need to be taught not to go sticking your nose around like the bloody snoop you are. What better way than to give you a punishment you won’t forget?”
Harry holds him, heart slowly returning to its normal pace. “How do you feel?” he asks after a moment, stroking his back.
“Did you know he’s gay?” Astoria asks abruptly. Which. Harry didn’t. Huh. “Which means that there’s absolutely nothing I can do to give him a fulfilling sexual relationship, even if I wanted to.” She sighs. “I think he misses it.”
They were having some petty squabble in the kitchen about Harry leaving his shoes in the middle of Draco’s entryway, which Harry fully admits to. Really, he thinks it isn’t that big a deal, but Draco seems
feel really bad for him, but... I can’t bring myself to go talk to him yet. I wish I could, but, well. He’s... he’s simply one of the people who reminds me most of the war, I suppose.”
“Well… I suppose,” Draco says, smirking at him. “I’d like to use it after you though, if you don’t mind.”
Desperately, he thinks to himself that it will be fine, that he can talk himself out of these feelings. It’ll be just like ripping a bandaid off. All he has to do is catch Potter unguarded and lift his wand; all he has to do is say those six syllables to save his own life.
Which makes it unfortunate then that he’s hard as fuck, arousal is pumping into his veins as surely as if
“He’s a vampire, yeah?” Ron asks, finally going back to eating his stew. “He’s didn’t try and bite you or anything, did he?”
Draco lets out a soft sigh. “Okay,” he says, and rolls away again, closing his eyes. Harry resumes stroking his hair, and he hums softly.
“That’s fantastic, Granger,” Draco says, a smile gracing his face as he stands from the bed. “I should say that I have some news as well—I’m sure Hermione has gleamed this from our Owls back and forth, but I’m very close to perfecting a more robust potion for core regeneration.”
Potter sighs, closing his eyes. “I dunno. I just woke up a couple hours after going to bed, and I just knew I had to go check on the warehouse.”
Potter’s quiet for a moment. “I had a magic map,” he says eventually. “I could see where you’d gone.”
Grief briefly threatens to bury him, grief for the years of life he is missing, for the years that were ruined by the war, snatched away from him by Voldemort’s cold, half-dead hands. But he has hours left to be bitter about it. He may as well keep talking to Potter right now, seeing as he’s got nothing better to do.
“I… don’t know,” Harry answered. “It just… feels right. And don’t make fun of me for saying that. It just does. And if she says no, you can go back to France and I’ll be out of your life. So can I just try?”
So he’s had to stay on his best behavior for the better part of four years, always with the Ministry breathing down his neck. One step out of line, even unintentional, and he could end up right back with the Dementors, going mad from visions of his worst memories.
“You’re still wearing too much clothing for that,” Harry says, and Draco snickers, stripping his pants off.
After the weird feeling of disorientation goes away, Draco gets his bearings and looks around. They’re at Blaise’s party, but it’s not the one he’d been expecting—instead, he spies a large banner hovering over the stage where the Weird Sisters are playing, advertising ‘
Harry is both annoyed and confused as he walks into the Death department the next morning, as usual skirting as far around the dais as possible. He’s annoyed because Malfoy showed up in his living room last night and actually tried to fight him; he’s confused Malfoy was
