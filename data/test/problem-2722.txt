Malfoy stands there, looking cross, holding a bright blue plastic bowl with Thomas the Tank on the side, and a plastic spoon shaped like a duck. Harry’s stomach does a thing, like it just fell off something high, when he sees Malfoy. It happens nearly every time, lately. Has done for months.
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco started to feel panicky again, and Blaise guided him over to the settee to sit down before he fell down. Theo got more coffee. Except for Draco, who received another glass of juice.
“The blush suits you.” He looked over Harry’s shoulder, Harry supposed at Malfoy. “It’s good you have a friend to look out for you. Coming out can be hard.”
“Harry, mate, light of my life - I say this with the deepest love and affection, but I don’t think you’ve ever had a good idea in your life.”
The bus screeched to a halt in the street outside their flat. There was a collective grumble as Aurors were thrown forward in their seats, thudding into each other and the chairs in front of them, but it wasn't a problem for Harry, because he had virtually leaped from the vehicle while it was still moving anyway. He ran for the gate, tripped on the carry strap of his field pack and fell sprawling into the garden bed just outside the small block of flats. The faint echo of laughter reached him as he struggled out of the clutches of a bush, and he glared squintily (his glasses were on the ground somewhere) at his colleagues who were still parked on the curb. A moment later, the van was roaring away and Harry was sorted, pack over shoulder, glasses on nose, some leaves and twigs still decorating his hair. He pushed past the gate, slightly more sensibly this time, but only barely so, and jogged quickly up the path to the front door of the building. His key was ready in his hand, had been ready for about half an hour before they'd even approached his street, and he was inside, he was taking the stairs two at a time and wishing he had been taller, like Ron, so he could take them three, or even four at a time. Green door, six-oh-five, that was him, that was
Malfoy had the good grace to at least look visibly surprised this time. “Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office – what official business would bring you to my establishment, Potter?”
Jesus. “Nevermind. It’s nothing, actually. False alarm.”
“Potter, I’m starting to get really concerned about what else you’ve been hoarding. You promised me no jars of piss or bags of hair.”
“No. But I’ll take one if you’re having one.”
“I want to come over Thursday, and help you put some decorations up. And I want you to make me this famous pasta salad that has every Weasley in such a lather.”
Ginny opened her mouth again, but then filled it with chicken, and said no more about it.
He wasn’t sure whether he was supposed to laugh, so he took a chocolate, and then Lovegood arrived with Granger in tow, and the ensuing chaos pushed the lingering tension, and any further questions about he and Potter, firmly off to the sidelines.
“Potter!” Someone from the Wizengamot had spotted him, and barged over to clap Potter so hard on the shoulder that he had to throw a hand up against the glass to avoid cracking his head on the window. Draco stepped away and into the depths of the compactus, and tried to get a hold of himself while he searched for Potter’s files. It took almost as long as the task itself, and when he emerged, Potter was gone, and had left another scrap with a scribbled note:
“I’m not joking, Potter. I don’t want to see that man in my office again about this issue.”
, and said loudly, "I - erm, yes, thanks. Good. Please bring an invoice, I'll pay you right away - galleons are fine? A promissory note will take longer to arrange..."
Draco felt like he’d just been hit with an Ennervate. He jerked his hips, wrenched Potter’s hand out of his jeans, and pushed off the wall, managing to dislodge Potter with the element of surprise. “And I’m not a
“Mmm. Almost. But obviously it was just luck.”
“I’m sorry I got a bit carried away there. I didn’t mean to shout at you.”
“Too fucking hot, mate,” Ron said, which was true, even with the strategically placed electric fans, and a cooling charm that had Hermione written all over it. “Gin’s going to the chippy on the way over, so we only have to have the hob on long enough to fry up a couple of tenderloins each.”
One side of Malfoy’s mouth quirked up. “Yes, for the night. An old friend from Beauxbaton’s is visiting, and I think we could both do with a night away from each other. I think he’s met some barista at my usual coffee shop, and if possible I’d like to be out of the house if he’s brought her back for a shag tonight.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Firstly, he doesn't actually want to go to Hampton Wick, he wants to go to the cafe in Bushy Park, but he insists on saying Hampton Wick because at heart he’s still fourteen.”
“This can go.”
“Merlin,” Ron laughed, turning back to the chicken. “If that’s not the Black gene making an appearance.”
“Right, protect the cashmere, sure,” Potter gave him a very thorough look over. “That’s one issue. The other — not sure how to put this delicately…I can see the full outline of your cock.” He looked down pointedly and added, “And your balls.”
“Otherwise known as
"I imagine you'll be needing this quickly and discreetly, Potter, and probably not flying through the halls of the Ministry by owl.” That was a very good point, actually. “I can-" Malfoy hummed slightly. "I can be at your office at a quarter to five this afternoon, if that suits?"
“Would you prefer if someone else were riding him, instead?” Her voice was carefully mild, but Ron huffed a laugh directly into his drink, and splattered his cards with fruit punch.
. The asparagus which is supposed to be garnishing this prawn is so limp that it actually looks depressed, and I can assure you, a depressed asparagus amuses nobody’s
“Of course,” Draco replied. “Get me a 2782 while you’re there.”
He smiled at Harry. “Have you, though? You seem to expect yourself to adapt to every new skill as if it was your first time on a broom. Why should it be? Why isn’t it okay to struggle for proficiency?” Harry just looked at Malfoy, not sure what to say. “Granger was never very good with flying, if I recall.”
“That’s Ron,” Harry said, already slumping halfway back onto his ruined pillow. He recognised Ron’s noisy pissing. This was nothing new for those who’d ever shared a dorm with him, or an attic bedroom, or a tent. “I’m not in charge of Ron’s penis.” He was barely in charge of his own, to be fair.
Harry gazed wide eyed at the big pot of tea, his favorite earl grey blend by the smell of it, positioned right next to a large jug of orange juice, pips floating on the surface and sticky fingerprints all over the glass. Beside both of them was a giant punch bowl, filled with what looked like the sliced remains of thirty bananas, an entire vine of grapes, whole strawberries, some with the little green bits still on top, and irregularly shaped chunks of apple, peach and pear. And a platter of toast, some of the bottom slices looking suspiciously dark. Draco had even set the table, using all the best silverware and china that he'd inherited from his parents, cut-glass goblets, linen napkins rolled in silver napkin rings.
Ron snorted. “Now
. I see quite a bit of that in my line of work, as you can imagine - it both enlarges and lengthens, if you hadn’t worked that out already.” Harry felt his cheeks burn. Yes, he had worked that out. “You can clearly see that it was cast deliberately. I’d say the
brushing their lips together.
!” Harry shook his head with amazement. “Still in their boxes! And I was doing the Academy, and then I was an Auror, and I was so busy all the time, and I had so much space here, so I just closed the door and didn’t look unless I had to throw something else in.”
His pulse was deafening in his ears. Sweetheart. “How many children do you think we’ll have?”
The last time was different, though.
is fuck yes.”
“Now, historically he likes to make decisions in patterns of three; two ‘no’s, then a ‘yes’. Make sure you make your real request
Potter looked up, saw him. "Hi."
An umbrella with a jewelled peacock handle. “Now, come on, that could come in handy...Potter...Potter!”
“Potter – you haven’t
The outline of the door they had just entered through was still visible –  easy to find, despite the fact that it and the wall around it was now a sort of slightly green glass. And more surprising, he could see people – customers, he supposed, lots of them, milling up and down the aisles, mostly singly but some who were clearly couples. He could see a man and woman not far from the rear wall; she was holding what looked like a harness of some kind against her waist as if to test the fit, while her partner compared the length and girth of two rather intimidating dildos. “What...?”
, a little voice inside his head piped up,
Harry nods vigorously. “Oh yeah, totally. I’m seeing someone, actually.”
Draco sighed again. “What am I going to do with you, Harry?”
Malfoy was - well, ridiculously pretty, it couldn't be argued. Harry may know next to nothing about fashion, but even he knew Malfoy was dressed to kill last night. He looked expensive, he smelled lush, everything about him made Harry want to touch, or maybe taste. Definitely taste.
Draco blinked for a moment, then cleared what was now a very dry throat. “What are you doing, Potter?”
Harry looked at Malfoy, who looked back, utterly unfazed. “How fortunate that he saw someone he knew. Almost like magic.”
“I don’t need a nanny, Potter,” Draco said with annoyance. “Perfectly capable of giving an update on my own.”
“I know the owner well,” Malfoy said over his shoulder, and then the stairs ran out and they were in a large, open space that was filled with the deep, syrupy beat he could hear from outside. The bar itself wrapped around the entire right-hand side of the room, and the left was a series of booths and alcoves, small and large, with leather seats and narrow tables. But most of the room was taken up by the enormous dance floor, which was sunk three steps down, and which had a platform in the very centre in which  several people seemed to be setting up musical equipment. There were people testing lighting rigs, bartenders polishing glasses and slicing fruit. It was a hive of activity, and there was not a single other patron in sight but himself, and Malfoy.
“About nine hours, give or take,” Hermione said, putting take away boxes on the coffee table, and Summoning cutlery. “Fork or chopsticks?”
Hermione tossed her card in the middle, and Harry looked distractedly at his, before chucking the highest one in the same suit on the table.
A short while later, he was standing in the hall outside the study, Time Turner in hand, watching himself talking to Draco inside.
The mirror had only enough time to offer an opening squeak before Harry’s Silencing charm clamped solidly down around it - he was absolutely not in the mood for any pervy comments today, especially while naked and vulnerable. It wasn’t long before he was under the hot water, the spray of the shower pounding down on his shoulders like needles, rinsing away the lingering evidence of the previous night with soapy water and steam. His fingers in his hair felt nice, pushing shampoo around the thick tangle. When it pulled suddenly, snagged on his fingers where the curls had become particularly knotted, the answering flutter of arousal in his belly was almost surprising.
“I don’t want to investigate this,” Harry said mournfully. “I have biting tea cups. I even have biting toilet seats. There’s been a lot of biting action lately and I really don’t have the time.”
“Fucking hell.”
“It’s barely six, Draco. Surely you can spare me ten minutes? I won’t see you all week.” Draco raised an eyebrow, and Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine, twenty minutes,
Ted’s breath was hitching, but it seemed the surge of tears was a brief one. “S-sorry Uncle Harry. I know I’m not a baby, I don’t know why I’m c-crying.”
“Potter.”
“Stirring.” A copper pan full of what would soon enough be risotto bubbled slowly on the stove, gleaming with fresh, green peas, asparagus, and spring onion, and another smaller pot of hot chicken broth sat on the burner beside it, to be ladled gradually in. The smell of crisp pancetta had Harry’s mouth literally watering, and the salt of grated parmesan with it. “You have to be patient for another fifteen or so.”
“Not sure,” Harry made a face. “What would a new ward be worth?”
Malfoy grinned back. “Sounds like she hasn’t changed much. So, what’s a week like in the life of The Workaholic Who Lived?”
“Never mind that – Harry, how are you getting on with Throttlebottom’s cocks?”
“Erm, Mr Malfoy? He says he’s your ten-thirty interview, but I think there must be some sort of-”
“Oh my god Malfoy, you were always a bitchy little prat,” she elbowed him with a grin. “Don’t let Ron hear you say that about Hermione’s hair. Fancy any Ice Mice?”
“You can probably start using the spell, now,” Harry told Ron that morning. He had eggs today, scrambled, maybe seven of them, drowned in a lake of brown sauce.
“From…?”
“Yes, he certainly did.” Draco pulled at Teddy’s uniform jersey, checked his pads were strapped in place securely. “Got your broom?” Ted held up his Cleansweep Jr, but his eyes were worried, and his hair shifted restlessly from black to blond.
Draco’s laugh was one of Harry’s favourite things. “You can tell her that, then. Just update your will first and leave everything to me.” Harry blinked up at Draco, then kissed him, softly at first, then more deeply, until Draco pulled away with a desperate gasp. “Harry. You really make this hard, you know.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, and took a deep breath. “Okay, so, this isn’t just me trying to stall for time, but I don’t think we can get through this in time. I mean, this is the weekend before the party, we still haven’t had the elf service in, and I haven’t bought a single posh soap.” Christ, he was panicking again, but Draco squeezed his hand and didn’t loosen it.
He turned away and disappeared.
“The thing is,” he started eventually, and then he paused, shovelling several large bits of egg into his mouth to buy some more time. “I mean, it’s not really anything. Yet. It might not become anything, actually. But you know. That’s still more than I’ve done in forever, so, it's something. Well. It’s nothing. I don’t know.”
Harry sighed, and came in after him, closing the door behind.
Draco turned in his arms, kissed him just beside one ear, and tilted the shower head so that the water began to properly wet Harry too.
Potter’s hands slid roughly over his hips, rucking up his tshirt, his fingers spreading low on Draco’s belly and scratching through the fine hair there. He thumbed the top button of his jeans, and Draco drew in a sharp breath. “Think I’ll abuse my position again right now,” Potter said, and slid his palm straight down into Draco’s pants, palming his erection. His hand was hot, and too dry, Draco couldn’t help the way his body moved, his spine arching against Potter’s chest, head dropping back onto Potter’s shoulder. “I saw you out there with Zabini. He had his hands all over you, right here,” Potter scraped his teeth over the nape of Draco’s neck. “You fucking him, now?”
“Anus next?” Malfoy set King Dong on the workbench and uncapped the lubricant again to slick his fingers.
"But I-"
,” Draco was furious, his temper rising fast. “And recommended I put them on before trotting off home. Not sure how many ways that can be interpreted.” He held up his hand to cut off whatever Potter was about to say in retort. “It’s fine, Potter. Message received. I left, didn’t I? My apologies if it’s been a little inconvenient for you to have to find another willing body, but rumour has it you’re up to your ears in offers. So just, find yourself a new routine and,” Draco waved his hand dismissively, “carry on.”
“Exactly, mate! I was pestering girls and you were splitting your time between staring at my sister and staring at Malfoy.” Ron’s appetite seemed to have recovered, and he speared bits of mushroom and sausage determinedly.
Zabini should be green by now, based on the expression on his face. “Guerlain. Guylian are the chocolate seashells.”
“No,” Potter shook his head. “The last time we were together, you were
Harry tried to catch his eye, but Malfoy was stubbornly keeping his focus on his injured hand.
Draco sighed, miserably. Theo placed a cup of fresh coffee in front of Blaise and gave him a peck on the lips. “Made with love, darling.” For Draco, he placed a tall glass of cold orange juice on the worktop, and said, “This one’s made with deep annoyance, you prat.”
“Yes, Ron, we can go to the pub. Go and round up the others, and don’t fucking forget Bujalski this time.”
“Neville’s moved into Malfoy’s room,” Ron said, later. He’d generously cooked a portion of bacon and tomato for Harry, who needed a bit of protein after the morning he’d so far had. “He looked a bit traumatised.”
“His name is Simon, and he’s more than just my little mate,” Ron said, coolly.
The elf service had done a remarkable job. Grimmauld had never looked better, certainly not in Harry’s lifetime, anyway. The air smelled softly of roses and beeswax. The soap in the bathrooms was triple milled and luxurious, and the towels were thick and soft. Every bed had a brand new mattress, and expensive sheets, and there were small, square vases of roses on the bedside tables.
into every unsafe crime scene in London. Always shouting at me, after.” Malfoy took a resentful mouthful of beer. “Prick.”
Circe’s arse.
Draco sighed again, long and noisy, and melodramatic. “I’ve been sort of fucking Potter for a couple of months.” Blaise and Theo just looked at him. “Fine, six months, although the last two months we’ve sort of been on the outs. I, um. May have caught feelings, slightly.”
“So, never then,” Harry said with a laugh.
The mirror appeared to be breathing heavily. “Just fine, pet...oh, my.”
The last time he’d fucked Potter, Draco realised that it’d been him getting fucked all along.
“Obviously not strictly, otherwise I wouldn’t have been-” Draco stopped and waited while the elf served Weasley his drink. “I’m traditional in principle only. Mother isn’t actively looking on my behalf, I’m clearly not keeping celibate, and there certainly won’t be any sort of announcement about my availability. I’m well past the point where I could be persuaded to marry a woman, so children are entirely off the table. We don’t go to the pureblood events, and we won’t start, either.”
“Sometimes people ask me about you,” Longbottom said, frankly. The waves pushed them around some more, and Draco belatedly renewed his Warming charm. He couldn’t imagine who would be asking Longbottom about
“Not this again. There are three reasons you want to go there, and none of them are the quality of the food.”
“Not ‘what’
“Did you seriously think he wouldn’t?” Draco’s hand was warm. “Are you feeling alright?”
think you’re hot, just Charlie is
“Cabbage Head?” Draco felt slightly more awkward calling him that in the currently-still-sober light of day, but it was only half-five and three sips into his drink. He’d feel less awkward about it soon enough.
Potter's hand was firm and warm against the small of his back. He led him off the stage, through back passages until they were out in the normal Ministry corridors again, and heading for the big, brown door that would let them leave. A crowd of wizards surged out behind them. So many people, all turned out to see his review. It was amazing what the name Malfoy could still do for ones reputation. It would always be this way. Draco would be first and foremost a Malfoy. Not a war hero, no, never that. Not a philanthropist, should he chose to be, or a friend, should he make one. He'd be a Malfoy. A dangerous criminal from a long line of dangerous criminals. Death Eater family on both sides of his tree, more relatives former residents of Azkaban than not. What was he supposed to do, now? He may have resented his sentence, but at least it had given him purpose, something to rely upon and fight against, something to keep the angry fire burning in his belly to fuel his mind and spirit. What was his purpose now? Where did he belong? What was he meant to do with his life, now?
me, you kept helping me! And now here we are, and I can't even give you that - it's
. He’s demanding just completely unreasonable resources for the investigation. He asked me to recall Shacklebolt. Shacklebolt! Like, as if he’s just been off fieldwork for the last fifteen years, or something. He’s the fucking Minister for Magic!”
"Your opinion means more than my two years of sweat and blood and sacrifice. I should have known it would be this way before I ever came to your stupid Order for help. What was it worth? Not a thing, not even my freedom. Everything I've done has been for nothing."
“Please,” Harry said, and after a moment, “Sorry for being so arsey.” Vicky politely said nothing, and left to fetch the tea.
“A regular here, are you?” Harry asked Malfoys arse, the sound of the street falling away as they ascended the stairs. “They all seem to know you. I notice we didn't have to line up. Or pay the cover charge. ”
“Mmm, yes, I gathered as much.” Harry squinted at Devlin’s armload of dicks, in no hurry to reach out and claim them. “Did our good friend Mr Weasley happen to provide any further information? I was under the impression that this case was more of a political stunt than anything to do with our sort of investigations.”
It was hard not to fall in love with someone who flew down from the flames to save your life. Someone who cut you open, his face so full of shock and fear as you bled on the tile. He’d had a long time to come to terms with this, to accept this feeling, to close it off in a box inside him so he could get on with his life.
"No questions!" Potter shouted. "No questions! Draco Malfoy deserves his privacy, and some goddamn peace and quiet. You might as well give up now as there'll be no questions!"
Draco was deep in a fantasy about an alternate future in which he was happily employed at the International Magical Trading Standards Body, perhaps overseeing the import and export guidelines for wands and wand materials, when he rounded a corner and caught sight of Potter exiting the elevator at the far end of the hall. Draco’s stomach lurched. Potter held a take away cup in one hand, and looked distinctly rumpled. It was irritatingly attractive.
In his excitement, Harry accidentally apparated himself into the apartment, and blinked for a moment in confusion at the sight of their living room, and the familiar blue curtains he'd always secretly hated.
Theo found Draco’s moka pot, and set it on the stove to brew them some coffee, and Blaise frogmarched Draco to the breakfast bar and onto a stool like an insubordinate child. He steepled his long fingers and stared at Draco, until Draco gave in and snapped, “
“No!” Harry blurted. “You could never be - I’d love to have you. Over.” Sometimes Malfoy smiled at him in a certain way, and it made Harry feel like he’d just done something very special, very clever. Even when Harry had just done something quite obviously stupid, like say ‘I’d love to have you’ and then forgetting to say ‘over’ until the pause between the words was a bit too long to excuse.
"Dawlish - I am queer."
Harry threw down a card with annoyance. “I feel like I shouldn’t have to remind anyone, but I did die to save you all, not that long ago.”
“So, any details, or am I supposed to just imagine the worst on my own?”
“Oh, right,” Potter tapped the side of the pot with his wand, and steam began to pour from the spout. “I’ve knocked it off my desk a few times, it’s better off in there. The charm to keep the tea at the perfect temperature without stewing the leaves is actually kind of fiddly, a real pain in the arse to have to re-cast all the time.” Potter poured Draco a cup, then retrieved his own from beneath an assortment of balled up parchment. “So I take it postponing the Cup itself is out of the question?”
“Draco loves you, Ron. He told me. We talked about it.
Granger twisted the stem of her glass, her eyes narrow and unforgiving. “What did Harry do to you, to hurt you this much?” He felt a shiver of panic. She saw that, too. “Did he say something to you?”
“That’s my favourite, you know.”
“Dig deeper, Malfoy. You’ll find it.”
tonight. I’m going to see if he’s up for a little horizontal refreshment, later.” She swirled her butterbeer martini twice, and downed the lot. “You know, see if he’s as long in the front as he is in the-”
Harry slicked the wand quickly, and pressed the tip against his hole, breathing out slowly as he pressed it in. It went easily, felt quite nice.
“Happy birthday,” Harry said again, his voice softer, a little rougher. “I’m sorry I didn’t realise. Bit thick, sometimes.” He pulled away, realising that Malfoy was just standing there, with his arms raised slightly, not touching Harry. Malfoy’s face was quite pink. Harry laughed, embarrassed, and took another step back, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “Sorry for that, too. Just wanted you to know, I...appreciate you.”
Ignoring Ginny, he picked up his fork again and smushed some beans on his toast. “No, it wasn't like that. He was very professional. Well, I think he was flirting with me a little bit, but he didn’t ask me to go out with him until he stopped by at work the next evening.”
sentencing. To say the least. Rather than a term in Azkaban, the Wizengamot had seen fit to saddle him with a five year term as gamekeeper at Hogwarts. And the added clause that he was only allowed to use magic when dealing specifically with magical creatures - meaning, that all the grunt work was to be done by hand. The muggle way.
Harry stood by the wood pile, waiting, until Draco was almost at the door.
Draco kissed him then, leaned in and brushed his lips very gently over Harry’s mouth, then ran the tip of his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip. Harry could smell mandarincello, and then with a very small sound of pleasure, Draco tilted his head, and kissed him properly.
Draco heaved, and rolled them both over slightly. Harry grabbed the back of the settee for balance, lest he roll any further and end up on the floor. “You don’t expect to live past ninety?”
“Do you really think that pairing is a good idea?” Blaise countered. Draco thought it was sort of nice, actually. Longbottom was a good sort, and Pansy could be very sweet, in her own way.
Malfoy turns, finally, and looks at him. “Who?”
Weasley took a huge mouthful of his beer, grinning. “You want to be courted.”
They watched
ago to stop her meddling in his business.” Weasley chuckled. “So if she wants to get involved, she has to do it via you.”
exactly. I only meant to Summon the small ones, and leave the bigguns, like the Snowy owls and the like.”
There were pages of transcripts from interviews with suspects, all of whom had so far been ruled out. It was apparent that this would come down to lab work, and probably some fairly tedious fieldwork. He would have to make a start on some of the tests right away to give them time to develop, if he wanted to get started on his fieldwork. He definitely didn’t want Shacklebolt to come down and shout at him again.
Seven o'clock had come that morning - after all the other hours had passed on the face of the clock, one by one, while Draco watched. He didn't move from his place on the bed, knees drawn up to his chest. At just after eight, like always, Potter rose, and this time paused outside Draco's door for a long moment before moving past. Draco's throat constricted almost until he couldn't breathe. He pulled the duvet over his head and squeezed his eyes closed.
Harry blinked at him. “You’re going to come around and hang balloons with me? And this would be me doing
“Please don't tell me you’ve been touching the deer, Ron,” Hermione said, poking him sharply in the knee. Ron stubbornly refused to respond, and Harry shook with laughter as Hermione really got into lecture mode. “Oh, Ron, for god’s sake! I swear, one day I’ll drown you in the bloody fountain-”
“I know you,” Potter said, and his eyes were dark, and very green. “I know the cleverest Auror in his division. I know a man who stopped to protect a fallen colleague before himself. I know how you like your tea, and all your favourite meals from the caf at work, and that you hate Ice Mice but love a mint humbug.” He got up, and knelt on the settee, one knee on either side of Draco’s thighs, and slowly sat on his lap. “I know you’re stubborn to the point of idiocy. I know what your face looks like when it’s filled with love for Teddy, and that makes my heart ache. I know you like the way my mouth tastes when I’ve just had a cigarette, but you’d never tell me because you don’t approve of smoking.” Potter pressed his fingers against Draco’s top. “I know when you wear this, you look like you walked directly out of a wet dream. I know what your arms feel like around me when I’m coming, that you’re strong enough to hurt me, but you don’t. I’ve watched you grow and change for more than half our lives, Draco. There are plenty of things for me to learn about who you are, but I
The silence went on for so long that Harry nearly gasped with relief when it finally broke. “I’m going to need a bit more information.” Draco looked at the hallway around them. Piles of stuff spilled over into other piles of more stuff, with even more tumbling out of cupboards and drawers, and from shelves, and under a pair of twin beds in the room opposite.
“You - we - I’m not Teddy’s godfather,” Draco managed, and Ginny smirked at him again.
This was the plan. This was going according to plan. Draco swallowed his nerves, and rolled onto his back. He pushed the jersey up, right up under his armpits, so one nipple could be seen, then he arranged his legs so it was clear he still had no pants on, without going for a full frontal shot of his bare cock. That was more than he was prepared for today. Draco held out the phone and took a flurry of snaps. Some of them were a bit blurry, some very clearly included his whole entire dick, but he found just the right one: back arched, nipple out, hint of rough hair low on his belly. It was clear he was sprawled in bed, but he thought it couldn’t hurt to say so, just to be absolutely crystal clear, and he sent that off too before he could change his mind.
Agatha had been thrilled. Potter sent him a memo that swooped and pecked him hard on the ear, and which said only ‘What the fuck, Malfoy?’. Draco spread it flat, and traced the letters carefully with his fingertip, then quickly set it alight before he could do anything else even more stupid with the thing.
. This was not the time to examine such things. He’s in
Potter made a hand gesture that was not very festive at all. “You look like you just sucked a lemon. What’s the problem?” He didn’t bother to invite Draco to sit, not that Draco would have waited for such an invitation anyway. He pushed a pile of tinsel off the spare seat with the tip of his wand, and felt his face draw even more tightly into a disapproving pucker when a half-eaten piece of shortbread was revealed underneath. “Oh! I wondered where that got to!” Potter looked pleased, and leaned over the desk to snatch up the biscuit, taking a huge bite to Draco’s great horror. “Sit, already. You’re making the place look untidy.”
Theo looked at him carefully. “What’s going on?”
“I love how you’ve turned my sweet gesture of devotion into some grubby plot to exploit you somehow.” Draco held his gaze in silence as he sipped his wine, then he rose and came around to Harry’s side of the table, and stopped beside his seat. Harry felt his breath catch in his chest, just slightly, then Draco twitched his wand, and Harry’s chair slid away from the table just enough that Draco could lift one, long leg over his lap, and settle himself down into a straddle on Harry’s thighs. Harry’s hands came up instinctively, and he smoothed his palms from Draco’s knees right up to his hips.
“How do you do that?” Harry wondered aloud. “You’re like a Niffler, but for kitchen smells.”
“Fine,” Draco said with a put-upon sigh, one that he used when he was just putting on a show of being a grumpy shit. He got up to retrieve a wine glass, and a bottle of what he liked to call ‘dirty kitchen wine’, which just meant a lovely, reasonably priced bottle of very drinkable Muggle vino. “Out with it. What am I being manipulated into this time?”
His friends left him just before nine, with instructions. Leave the phone to charge, have a shower, go to bed and stay there, ideally asleep, until at least two. Then, have a light lunch, take some suggestive photos, text them to Potter, and report back on the progress.
the logical next step for a former war hero, trained by specialists to subdue and arrest criminals, and every now and again kill a person. How silly of me.”
“Very manipulative of you Potter, well done. But there’s no need. He’s also a proud little fuckweed, so he’ll say something nasty about everything being out of season, and then silently seethe over it until he can find something else to one-up me on.”
“What are you asking for, you dick. Do I
Bog handed him a note.
Potter laughed, and popped a vol-au-vent in his mouth whole. There were a few flakes of pastry on the lapel of his jacket, and Draco’s fingers itched to brush them away. “This thing – what is this thing?” He popped another into his mouth, and a shower of crumbs followed.
“Well,” Draco said against his knuckles. “In the short term, all of the stuff you bought for me is moving directly into our wardrobe, because I want it all, and it doesn’t really matter if it’s out of season.” He pulled both of Harry’s hands onto his chest, and Harry spread his fingers across the plush velvet of the peacock blazer. “In the long term, I think, and I say this with the deepest love and affection, that you need to go back to therapy.”
Numb. Surely he shouldn't feel so numb? It was good news - he was free.
“Yeah. It was October. You first kissed me at my birthday drinks, and you finally acknowledged we were actually dating in August. So stubborn,” Harry kissed him on the tip of his pointy nose.
Draco looked away as he huffed out a laugh, and Ginny walloped Ron as hard as she could on the thigh. They argued for a while, and Draco didn’t look at the way the light wind tousled Potter’s curls, or the way his track pants seemed to cup his thighs around the hamstring. He definitely didn’t watch Potter squint in the late morning sun, tracking the Snitch, or crouching to talk to the kids on his team with a wide smile.
“I think these would look nice in the hallway, up near the ceiling,” Malfoy said, still looking up. “The sitting room as well. What do you think?”
It was exciting, not knowing where it would all lead. Like, he knew where
this, then Draco was going to go back upstairs to his room and wallow in his misery again. He moved quickly, collecting glasses and knives, scraping the plates, filling the sink with dirty dishes until all the table was cleared, and he could set the dishwashing charm Potter had taught him in motion to fill the sink with water and suds, and start the scrubbers and scourers rising to take on the mess.
“Okay. I’m really sorry Malfoy. You know I wouldn't have brought you in if I could’ve avoided it. This is just a big problem, and we needed our best on it. I’ve got everyone else on detail trying to keep the peace, but I need you with Harry to track down whoever’s taken off with the owls, and get them back before something really bad happens. You’re the only one I’d trust with this.”
Draco pressed the end button viciously with his thumb and dropped the phone on his bedside table, then rolled over again and shut his eyes.
“Yeah. He’s been...yeah.”
Malfoy took the pint from Harry’s own hands, and gave it a suspicious sniff. “How many of these have you had?”
Theo looked unimpressed. “Why would this necessitate the urgent acquisition of a fucking Muggle mobile at fuck-thirty on a Sunday morning, exactly?”
“Yes, the attic is full of my crap. I know. I’ll have to get rid of something, won’t I?” Draco made a face. “I suppose that’s only fair.”
“Granger and Weasley will need to stay as well, and that means Pansy will want to stay lest she be accused of being less of a super friend than your little pals, and that probably means the Ginger Harpy will bunk with her even though we’ll all pretend it’s not happening.” Draco’s nose wrinkled with disgust, which was mostly performative. Mostly.
“Find myself? Oh, yes. Very thoroughly.”
When Harry woke promptly at seven on Sunday, it was to a thumping headache and a mouth that tasted like something low-flying and evil had died and fallen into it overnight, but not before taking an enormous shit on his tongue.
. They sat in Draco’s kitchen again while Theo set the phone up and showed Draco the basics, and they put in their own numbers, and Pansy’s.
Well, that was a good start. “And the tie?”
“Ouff, Longbottom is looking
“Do you check that often, Malfoy?” Potter said, with eyebrow raised. Draco wanted to slap the stupid look right off his witless face.
“I wouldn’t,” he said, his voice hoarse, and gestured for another drink.
Draco sighed. He was always a bit weak for Gryffindor praise, not that he’d ever let on.
“Oh, have a day off, would you Malfoy?” Potter had spotted the tin of paperclips on Draco’s desk, and was reaching for the lid. Draco’s wand had rapped Potter hard across the knuckles before his brain even registered the command to do so, and Potter let out a yowl of pain. “What was that for?” He rubbed his other hand hard over his now red fingers. “I just wanted to know how you get them all to sit so perfectly in their place without getting caught in a great big tangle, that’s all!”
His face was burning and he tried to tug his hand away from Potter.
Dripping, soaking, sopping wet fury.
Harry shrugged. “Why not? It’s only six months, and if Draco’s already teaching, then we won’t have to do the Floo-in, Floo-out thing again. Honestly, I’d do the Groundskeeping or even the Caretaking, whatever, I don’t mind. Hagrid and Filch are surely on the verge of retirement. I’m ready for a quiet life. As long as we’re able to sit down for dinner together every night, and wake up together every morning, I’ll be happy. I don’t care what I do.”
He knew there was something going on around him. Lots of noise, lots of people talking loudly, excitedly. He could hear Potter shouting over the top of the crowd, something about making sure there were no clauses. He couldn't see. He couldn't seem to focus his vision properly. Was this how Potter saw the world, when he hadn't any glasses? Just a murky blur of colours and shapes, no clear outline of who or what he was staring at-
Potter looked irate. “Malfoy, I swear to god I’m going to really lose my temper with you in a minute.”
my aunt. Dean and Seamus. Bernie and Will from work, and Hagrid, I can’t believe you left him off. Oh, and you forgot Hannah.”
He felt his eyebrows climb. “Spell blocker? I didn’t realise I had one on me.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at Teddy. “Victoire, eh?”
Harry shoved both hands, caked with dust and grime, into his hair. “I’ve been keeping a secret from you.” His heart was thudding in his chest, somewhat due to the recent startlement, and the rest due to the confession which was bearing down on them like the Hogwarts Express. Draco just continued to stare at him, affording no relief.
It wasn’t actually fair to feel quite this horrible, considering he hadn’t really had all that much to drink. The bottle of mead hadn't been very large to begin with, and he’d shared it with Malfoy after all. Having said that, it had been fairly hot in the club, and they’d been sort of dancing, almost, and he hadn’t had anything else to drink in all that time. And there was the small matter of all the wanking he’d done in the night, of course. It was really no wonder he was rather dehydrated.
Harry looked from Ron, to the cock, and back again several times. “You want me to… interfere with a piece of evidence, one that was recently buried under a quantity of well fertilised soil, and before that had Merlin knows what done to it?”
When he lay on the bed, the smell of Potter surrounded him. The sheets were soft, and dark red like sweet wine, and his pillows were a mellow clementine-orange velvet. When Potter finally touched him, his fingers were warm, gentle but firm, slippery with an oil that smelled of sweet almond. He tried to hold back a groan of satisfaction, entirely unsuccessfully, and Potter settled his weight on the back of Draco’s thighs with a low laugh. “Just relax, Draco. Let me make you feel good.”
Draco was silenced for another long series of minutes, after which he couldn’t possibly claim that it wasn’t absolutely, positively, rock hard.
"Why are you running away from me?"
He jerked awake abruptly, some hours later.
“I like you, Draco Malfoy. You’re posh and bitchy, and extremely confident, and good at your job, and you wear clothes that cost more than you earn in a year, and all I want to do is take them off you.”
“Do you need anything?” Harry touched her elbow. “What can I do to help?”
“Is there a statute of limitations on saving the world?” Hermione mused, reorganising her hand for the dozenth time.
“Shut it,” Harry said, low, looking over at Malfoy’s closed door. “He was threatening violence, I’ll have you know.”
“The chateaubriand, with the lemon sorbet for afters.” That sounded good. Very Malfoy. Harry’s stomach growled, and he thought belatedly that he should have at least got someone to bring him back a sandwich or something, because he was fucking starving.
If he’s being honest, he wants to call Malfoy, but as much as Harry wants to, he also feels skittish and nervous when he thinks of it. He hasn’t liked anyone in such a long time. He never had to do all this with Ginny; they already liked each other as friends, knew each other for years, had grown up together. When they first started seeing each other it felt so natural, from the moment they kissed in the Gryffindor common room, and then when she’d taken his hand again for the first time after the War, and kissed the tips of his fingers and pressed his palm to her face... Malfoy was going to be different. Not the innocent blossoming romance he’d had with Gin. This was going to be molten hot and probably filled with the itch of agitation between them that they’d always had, rivalry and irritation and two lives lived as differently as they probably could have been; it was going to be exciting, and like nothing else Harry had done before, and Harry felt restless, and ready, and unbelievably
Hosford looked impressed. “So, you haven’t even tried to cast all week?”
“Is it Ministry business? Do you have your warrant card?”
“Harry - is this
“It would never stick. For a start, you tried to steal food from the very mouth of the Saviour of the Wizarding World. Secondly, you clearly broke into my private home in order to do so. I think I could have
“What are you talking about, Ron?” Harry tried to pull him back towards the Potions classroom, but Ron was a lot bigger than Harry, and just applied both large hands to Harry’s shoulders, and pushed him down the corridor. “He’s clearly up to something!”
“Ink on you,” Malfoy said under his breath, pulling out a chair for Harry right beside his. Harry’s gut lurched in a familiar way.
“Sure,” Harry said, trying to sound normal. “Fine.”
“Well, you know the power of a good list, Potter, I’ve told you a thousand times.”
He sounded sort of surprised, like he thought that perhaps Draco was only joking when he'd accepted the offer of accommodation.
He was bare chested, and up to his hips in the water, glowing blue waves breaking gently around him. There’d been tourists on the shore earlier, but a few well placed charms had taken care of that, and now he was free to collect his samples, his wand refreshing the Warming charm wrapped tight to his skin like a wetsuit. He was thinking about the last time they’d been together. Always at Potter’s house. His bed was never made, but the sheets were soft and clean, and smelled of Harry, and Draco smelled of Harry later as well, and it was an effort sometimes to push himself through the shower, and wash it off.
, I put an end to it a couple of months ago.
“Get dressed, and come home with me. I’ll give you a back massage, sort out the last of that stiffness.”
“Thanks.” Draco’s voice was rough.
“I’m married to my work, Potter,” Malfoy said, his nose in the air. “And I’m quite satisfied.” Harry just laughed at him, and he could tell Malfoy was pleased by it, in the way his lips tightened against a smile that he couldn’t quite keep from his eyes.
-ever, which is how long I’ve been waiting for you to get home.” Harry linked their fingers, and pulled him towards the kitchen. “Come with me, I want to tell you all about my day.”
, so…” Potter smiled at him, and Draco felt certain the goofy face was back again. “Besides, I don’t plan on staying retired for long. After a week, you can re-hire me as your security and risk consultant.”
“I think I’m starting to rub off on you, Potter,” Draco said.
“The knob job,” said Ginny immediately. “How could we forget?”
“Yes...well, you probably know the story, I suppose. It’s been well covered in the press – my tragic childhood.” The ladies clucked in sympathy, swiping away tears with lacy handkerchiefs, and the gentlemen murmured somberly. “Of course, my situation was a bit different to most, but when I think about how something like the Summer Swim program could have changed my childhood experience...making friends, having fun, an escape from things at home. All while learning something valuable like swimming and water safety...well. What was it all for, if not for the next generation of kids, am I right?”
“Don’t go yet!” Harry hastily picked some left-over bits of Cumberland sausage from the pan he’d used for dinner, and quickly filled a scrap of parchment with as many ink kisses as he could manage. “I know it’s a bit late, but if you wouldn’t mind?” The owl let him tie on the note, and took off via the kitchen window.
“Must be at work,” Harry knew he’d bloody forgotten something. “Good thing Draco was with me.”
Maybe that’s what made him do it. He wasn’t really thinking, between the beer that had slowed his thoughts a little, and the heat of the summer night, and the hotter stirrings in his chest. With his rational brain subdued for a moment, distracted for just a second, something else took charge, and he stepped forward and folded Malfoy - a very surprised Malfoy - into a hug.
This was all dead useful, because as sartorially challenged as Harry was, he was even worse at hanging up after himself; the last straw had really been the time a spider had actually crawled out of his shirt pocket during a dinner out with Hermione and Ron. Both of them had been equally vexed with him when he’d confessed he’d picked the shirt up from a pile on the floor and hadn’t even bothered with an ironing charm for it. Apparently, everyone worth his salt knew you shouldn't leave your clothes in piles if you didn't want pockets full of spiders. Harry had reminded them that he’d grown up under the stairs, and having pockets full of spiders was basically normal as far as he knew, but for once neither of his friends had let him get away with that as an excuse. Ron’s lecture had come from behind the safety of Hermione’s hair, while she gently Levitated the spider out the front door of the restaurant and into a hanging basket of summer flowers. Sometimes Harry still thought about Ron’s face that night, when he needed cheering up.
“Well enough,” Draco said, leaning back in his chair and stretching. “I feel sorry for the girl, but it looks like Granger will let her off relatively lightly. Thanks for that, by the way.” Weasley shrugged.
Well, that was a bit unexpected. “Wait, what?”
Bog appeared in the lift, just as Draco was turning the lever to take them back down to Level 2. “Auror Malfoy.” Draco started and lurched right into Potter’s chest, his hands spreading across pleasantly firm pectorals.
Right on cue, Draco whipped his wand at the Senior Auror’s office door and strode in without waiting.
“No, I don’t think I will. I think I’ll fuck on, actually.”
“Potter?” Malfoy said, and Harry blinked and checked his holster, then his back pocket for his wallet. Anything else he’d left behind he’d have to come back for on Saturday. His brain was too fried by the heat and Malfoy’s perfect hips.
He turned Draco in a circle, until they were both laughing. “I’m going to quit the Aurors and come with you to Scotland, so we can be together every day and make lovely babies together.”
“I know. I’ll make it up to you.”
Harry realised with a start that Malfoy was standing right beside him, a look of restrained amusement on his face, and he waved his wand at Harry and the seemingly endless rolls of parchment that were unfurling completely against his will in every direction, and the scroll coiled up with a snap. “I do, yeah.”
“You made Not-Mousse,” Draco said, with an unreadable expression.
Draco swallowed, and nodded in acknowledgement. Nothing else was said on either of their parts, although Draco could feel that infernal prickling sensation which indicated Potter was watching him again, and probably wanted to say something. He sat down at his normal place at the table, then got up again remembering it was his job to set it. He moved about the kitchen, silently removing forks and side plates, and a pair of napkins, with his eyes carefully slipping over Potter to focus on just about anything else. Their silence was uncomfortable, for the first time. His fault.
“You wanted to be in a relationship with me, and your solution was to unplug yourself completely and never see me again.” Potter leaned forward. “Couldn’t have just asked me.”
“I sent the video I took before, and a couple of snaps, to a friend,” Longbottom said. “He’s just replied.”
Harry just stared at Malfoy, who was starting to walk away. “What - no goodnight kiss?”
“Godric bless that woman.”
to do it.”
it, before Conjuring a fresh, hot cup of Darjeeling. He handed it to Harry before Conjuring a teacup of his own, and filling it with what smelled like a white Jasmine tea. He let Harry sip for a few moments in silence, watching him shrewdly over the top of his cup.
They both watch Teddy’s eyes turn from green to the warm brown of strong tea, and his hair black, and wild.
Malfoy smirked, and it did things to Harry’s guts.
Teddy looked small in the gurney, even though he was eleven, and due to go to Hogwarts in just a few months. When he saw Harry and Malfoy pull back the privacy screen, he burst into tears, and Harry was crouched low beside his bed a moment later.
“Hey!” Harry poked him in the side. “Naughty boys who call their fiance a liar do not get dessert.”
“Kill…well. Robards, obviously, no need to spell that one out. Marry...Potter.” Harry’s eyes jerked up, his whole entire head hot with blush. Malfoy’s face was full of mirth. “We’re like an old married couple as it is, and I might as well make an honest man of him if I’m going to have to put up with the nagging and lack of sex anyway.”
No fucking buffer. He was in serious trouble.
“We’ve had the pleasure of your company on many occasions over the years, Mr Potter, and despite what you’ve been through, there’s no sign there that you have anything malicious lingering to pass on to your children.” He raised one eyebrow at Harry, “Though you may like to think about your career choices if you plan to be the one carrying.”
“Drama
Potter looked stunned. He raked a hand through his hair, which was already wild. “I didn’t - I don’t see you like that. Is that what you think? I wasn’t trying to send you away, I-”
“Harry only left because he knew he could and the department would be in safe hands with you and me.”
“What was that look about?”
“Shut up,” Malfoy sulked, but he got in. Harry smiled and slipped his arm over his hips. Malfoy hadn’t bothered with the robe this time.
“You like photos of my body, Potter,” Draco pulled the top on, and pushed the cuffs up to his elbows. “Well, get ready.”
lick the sculpted ice centrepiece.” They both followed Draco’s pointed finger, to see a swaying wizard looking amorously at the frozen dolphin with slightly puckered lips. “Secondly, take this tray back to the kitchen and tell the chef that if he would like to cater another Ministry function at any point in the foreseeable future he will do a far better job at the
“Yeah,” Harry said again, confused. “That’s why I made it, you noodle.” Draco just stared at him, until Harry rubbed his hand through his hair self-consciously. “What?”
“Potter,” Potter said. “Harry Potter. And yes, I’ve worked in a very similar role, quite recently, actually.”
“Stop overthinking it. Let yourself have this, Draco.”
“Perhaps you should let her know,” Malfoy’s face is getting red. His neck was already blotchy. “I hardly think fantasising about what your babies might look like is a sign of two people being over each other.”
Unfortunately, Harry’s natural rhythm for this seemed determined to be ‘heart palpitations and almost falling on your head’.
mouth!”
“Then I guess I’ll be seeing you at the round-robin.” It wasn’t really a question. Draco’s throat felt tight, like he’d swallowed something too large and it was stuck part-way down.
Ron threw up his hands. “C.U.M., go, I couldn’t give a fuck really, as long as I can get on with some actual work instead of wasting my team’s time on ridiculous pranks.”
"Later," Draco finally decided, inclining his head towards the hut. "Right now, I'd like some tea."
“You look nice,” Potter said, and Draco reached out and snatched a fresh glass of champagne from a passing waiter, deliberately breaking contact between his shoulder and Potter’s chest. Potter moved to stand beside Draco instead, to his great relief, and sipped from a short, square tumbler of amber liquid. Champagne was Draco’s preferred poison, but whisky and Potter were a disturbingly attractive combination.
Draco made a pleased sound, and started a fresh list.
He stepped through the Floo into the Atrium, and utter chaos. There were elves everywhere, and memos thick in the air like clouds of parchment insects. And then there were the birds. Pigeons, by the look, and pigeon shit just everywhere. Draco spelled a shield around himself just in time to avoid a spatter of it which dropped from directly above him. His coat was last season Givenchy, for fuck's sake.
, not professional.”
“You might as well. Maybe I’ll even answer you, Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was teasing. “Go on, then. What do you want to ask?”
“Today was shit,” Malfoy said, with feeling. Harry hummed agreement as best he could around a mouthful of Stella.
“How’s work, Harry?” Ginny stretched out a leg and poked his shoulder with her foot. “Anything exciting happening in the world of cursed Muggle objects?”
The thing was, really, that Harry couldn’t work out which would be more awkward; being seen entering a Knockturn Alley sex shop, or seeing someone he knew from the Ministry actually inside the sex shop. “Or being caught loitering in the doorway of said sex shop,” Harry muttered under his breath. “Grow a pair, Potter, you used to be an Auror for fuck’s sake.”
“Go now, or I won’t be held responsible for my actions.”
What the fuck was a relish fork???
“I would ask you all the usual questions, such as whether you’d used them before, what size you might like, what shape. But I’d also ask you if you were prepared to clean your toy manually, and if you said you only wanted to do so by magical means, then I wouldn’t recommend anything in the jelly range, but rather glass, acrylic, or silicone.” Malfoy held up the dong, and waved it towards Amy. “Fingers out, Potter. She’s more than ready. How are you going to record this - I presume you have a spell?”
“Potter.
Draco’s laugh was honestly the best thing in the world. “Most excellent. He’s such a competitive little fuckweed, this will absolutely kill him.”
hot, anyone who’d seen Underworld would agree with that. The leather trousers alone...
“Harry said Malfoy got weird after they shagged that time I got hexed on the wolfsbane case. Mum’s knitting you a jumper, by the way, Malfoy.”
“And the wand. Yeah. So, it's not just about me and what I can move on from. There’s a lot of horrible shit that went down between his family and ours, and if any of you, any of you at all,” and here he meant all the Weasley’s, his family. “If it would hurt any of you, I wouldn’t go any further. I’d never call him again.”
It was a minor miracle that Ginny was still upright and breathing, considering the eye-daggers Hermione aimed at her. She took Harry’s arm. “You tell us what you want to, when you’re ready, and in the meanwhile we can have a nice meal together.”
“Harry,” Draco was breathless. “Be good. We haven’t even done the speeches yet.”
Harry stepped up to the bench and stood beside Malfoy, his professional curiosity almost overriding his embarrassment. “Right, so that’s not how one would normally feel?”
Draco laughed. “Not that traditional. I was...I had someone I was sleeping with for a while, but not anymore.”
“No. I mean. I don't know.” It shouldn’t really matter. There was really no telling where this thing with Malfoy might go, beyond maybe a shag, or a couple of them. Did it really matter about all the things that had happened so long ago? He knew it did, to him, anyway. Harry didn’t do one nighters, or flings, or fuck buddies. There were many reasons for his long period of singlehood, and that was one of them. He needed there to be a real connection. That’s why a Muggle or a casual shag would never work. How could he possibly connect with someone that he couldn’t talk about...well, everything, with.
“No,” he managed, strangled. “I can’t-” Draco stepped back, increasing the space between them. “What feelings?”
He counted on his fingers. “Ted’s room, and maybe two more on that same floor. They’ll just be the usual amount of dusty and creepy.”
“Ah, no. Expensive though, goblin made. They were a housewarming gift from...” The last bit was mumbled. Harry narrowed his eyes.
Malfoy looked up from his mischief with a pleased smirk, and then saw Harry’s presumably surprised expression. “I do like men. I also like women. I like people who weren’t born with the body to match the gender they know in their soul, and I like people who don’t feel they were born with any specific gender at all.” Malfoy shrugged. “I tend not to use labels, myself, other than to say I am a sexual person. I like who I like.”
Harry laughed a little hysterically. “I don’t know how peculiar it is, Malfoy. Throttlebottom’s making a lot of noise about the case, and that means the Minister’s been breathing down my neck to get it done. I’ve just been working a bit too hard this week. I probably just need a nap, and something to eat that didn’t come out of a packet.”
“I’ll be late, Potter. McGonagall will have my arse.”
“Chicken is nearly ready, and Harry sees us as his surrogate parents.”
“What stage are you up to?”
“Yeah,” Potter stalked closer, pointing a finger in Draco’s chest, just short of actually touching him. “What does traditional mean?”
Draco felt himself go red, and imagined he must look nearly purple, given the electric blue glow. “Nonsense. Agatha was better suited for this one.”
He lifted the hem so it sat high on his waist, his arse bare, and turned away from the mirror. He cocked his hips, bent his left knee slightly, and held the phone up to his left shoulder, so the camera lens would clear his arm, and rapidly snapped a number of shots over his shoulder via the mirror.
Malfoy was nudged in the back by an enthusiastic dancer, and was abruptly pressed against Harry’s chest. He didn’t move away again, instead placing his other hand back on Harry’s hip and bringing his mouth back to Harry’s ear once again. “Tell me what you were nervous about.”
He gestured Harry into a seat. “Quite so. Well, how can I help? You look like you’ve been shopping,” Blaise’s eyes were greedy on the gold branding of the bags. “Is that such a good idea, given your predicament?”
He had a basic Ministry uniform of plain business shirts in various inoffensive shades - strictly without patterns, so that he was never at risk of making any potentially jarring matches using his own judgement -  and in a seemingly endless quantity, because if Harry was indifferent to hanging things up, he was even worse about doing his washing. He could probably go at least a month without washing, and still manage not to wear the same shirt twice. He had trousers in equally inoffensive black, grey and navy, and a collection of neutral ties which Hermione added to every Christmas, and which didn’t clash with anything else he owned. They all hung neatly on hangers and hooks on the left, helpfully ordered by colour.
“That is truly the pot calling the kettle.” Harry adjusted the temperature, and gave the rice a quick taste, before adding a tiny pinch more of fresh thyme.
“Yes,” Draco said. “And I may need you to escort me to my bedroom. I’m really very tired.”
"…and it is our conclusion that the sentence imposed on Draco Malfoy should be considered served, reduced by four years and six months, with due consideration given to his expressed remorse for his crimes, and subsequent invaluable service to the Ministry during The War. Mister Malfoy - you are free to go."
, and that means you two knobheads.” Draco twisted his mouth, but managed to keep it shut. “Malfoy, Harry is consulting for tracing and hostage retrieval.
in Weasley’s infuriating voice. It was a mistake to have allowed Weasley to program the thing. When he was back from hols he planned to stuff the cursed device directly up the ginger git's arse.
How could that be possible when Malfoy worked in a
A solid gold magnifying glass.
There was a short pause, and then Malfoy gave Harry the thumbs up with one hand, while picking up his quill in the other. “You did? Mail order, you say? What was the customer name?” Malfoy scratched the details out on the back of the list of suppliers. “Hmmm, doesn’t seem to be the same name as the person who came in to see me. Well, look maybe they got it as a gift, I’ll see what happens when I speak to them again...what’s that? Oh, why was it being returned?” He looked at Harry, and casually dropped his gaze again to Harry’s mouth, and over his chest, and down to his thighs. “The guy said it wasn’t stiff enough.” He gave Harry a slightly wicked smile, and Harry’s heart thudded suddenly. “Right-o, well thanks Les, I’ll send the fellow in your direction and you can argue the refund policy with him if he shows up. All the best – bye.”
thingy about it,” Draco said honestly. “This man, Harry Potter. He’s a hero, you see. He saved me from a fire once-”
“Yes, and he’ll have to stay that way for a little while longer while my team works through our existing caseload.”
thought about anything, only they’d always had a sort of rivalry, hadn't they, always trying to get one up on the other. One
The door to Potter’s office was open, so Draco rapped his knuckles thrice on the door frame, and stepped inside.
“Both of you, for different reasons.” He felt Ron’s big hand ruffle his hair.
Harry was not what anyone would describe as fashion conscious. Or naturally blessed with any sort of style. Hermione was largely responsible for anything to do with Harry’s clothing, including the system of fitted wardrobes she’d convinced him to install about five years earlier. They had been disgustingly expensive, but even Harry’d had to admit, kind of amazing. All he had to do was toss his clean items onto the floor of the wardrobe, and magic took care of the rest - steaming and pressing, hanging, organising. The
He imagined Malfoy was behind him on the bed, watching him in the mirror. He tilted his hips, spread his legs wider; imagined it would give Malfoy a glimpse of his balls which were growing higher and tighter as he stroked. Malfoy would be softly giving him instructions in his low sweet voice; telling him to move faster, now slow; to twist his wrist
“Fantastic. Thank you, Potter.”
That was actually pretty funny, and Harry was too sleep-drunk not to laugh. Malfoy seemed to preen a little, before he remembered he was cranky.
He took a steadying breath.
Harry shuffled his own cards, and silently cursed Ginny for taking so long. Honestly, was she fermenting the booze herself? “Seven diamonds. And yes. No. A bit.” He sighed. “I don’t know.”
Malfoy shrugged. “I really want that pasta, Potter.”
The last time he’d fucked Potter, he hadn’t known that it was. That it would be. If he had, maybe he would have done things differently, taken more time.
“Let’s put it this way, Malfoy, even I noticed when you rocked up looking like that,” Ron was clearly deeply amused.
Harry looked at himself for a long while in the mirror when he finally left the shower. The sense of shame was largely gone, although something gnawed along the edge of his thoughts, about why he should have felt such self-disgust in the first place. He deserved to feel good. He deserved to feel pleasure, and enjoy his body, he knew that, a body which had done many things which he was rather proud of over the years. He wouldn't judge someone else for something like this. Hermione had been telling him a version of this for years, forever really. He deserved pleasure. He deserved happiness. Why did he find it so hard to enjoy things?
Draco followed Potter up the stairs.
Harry was glad to be able to do something useful with his gifts, but it was also a little embarrassing when people called him heroic.
“Exactly,” Harry said, pushing all ten fingers into his hair and dislodging several erasable pens in the process. “So you agree that this looks like an accidental hexing - or rather, someone also deliberately cast the Gemino for some reason, but didn't know about the
“I suppose that’s to help you tell the difference between jumpers and trousers, then.”
Morgan pressed himself even more closely against the wall, and raised a pair of purple opera glasses to his face. A row of small, golden letters along the handle caught the light: WWW.
, the twat - and shoved them in his mouth, a testament to how tired and probably tipsy he was. He would never normally do something so crass as stuff his face with crisps straight from the packet, especially not so many at once. That was rather Harry’s department. “Yeah, well. You’re special, aren’t you.”
“Well...I can see the Undersecretary...”
“A person!”
, who was possibly the fittest person he’d ever met and who was the present owner of a thriving sex shop and therefore was about a thousand times more sexually experienced than Harry. He was going out in clothes which were basically painted onto him. If he so much as had a mildly sexual thought tonight, it would probably be visible to the wide world, and he strongly suspected he would be having a number of sexual thoughts around Malfoy whether he wanted to or not.
But Draco couldn’t. This was too much to take in. Too hard to believe. He tossed in the Floo powder, and looked at Potter, then quickly away again. Potter was just standing there, unhappy.
As he climbed back up into the stands, he scanned the rows for a gap in a section with a decent view. His mother and aunt could be anywhere, but frankly he didn’t fancy a lecture on top of everything else.
Malfoy leaned closer and pointed to the opposite corner of the club. “Over there - can you see? You better go and see what they want.” With a slight push in the back from Malfoy, the man ambled off as abruptly as he’d arrived, and he was soon lost in the mass of people.
“You want to
no smart comments!”
Malfoy rapped Harry on the forehead, hard, and yellow sparks came out of the end of his wand as he did it.
“Go ahead,” Draco said, straightening up and brushing non-existent grass from his knees. “That was the point of sending him away, was it not?”
“Oh, christ,” Granger rolled her eyes, but it didn’t come to that, thankfully, as Longbottom arrived, and Pansy leaped from her chair to greet him.
“None of you ever do, but it seems at every turn lately all I find is another Gryffindor asking intrusive questions, then telling me it’s because we’re friends.”
“Bye, love.”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “So I have a habit of buying people things and then not giving them to that person.”
Harry gave Malfoy a wry smile. “I think Hermione Granger is one to talk about being a workaholic.”
Draco didn’t let him down this time, his post-coital pink deepening. He fussed with his hair, scooping it back from his face and neck into a bun, which only showed off more of his flushed skin, to Harry’s delight.
“Harry,” Draco said, softly. “Everyone will know.”
Draco sighed. “Once again I find myself asking, what the fuck am I looking at here, Potter?”
After a moment, he lifted a hand to Summon the pack of chocolate Hobnobs he kept in his desk drawer, for emergencies, and had stuffed one into his mouth whole by the time Vicky was back with his cuppa.
Draco was still wet and relaxed from their last round.
“I’m going to go out on a limb here, and assume this has something to do with the lead article in this morning’s
“I’d like to see the rule book, thank you.”
“Ready to admit you’ve been awake these past few days?”
“I’m afraid you won’t want to marry me anymore after you see that room,” Harry blurted. Oh, god. That was embarrassing.
Harry started to laugh, and went to hoist Malfoy up and off to their room for another round, before realising he was not in a decent state to be seen, and promptly sat down again.
“No moping,” Hermione tapped her wand on Harry’s leg and his greasy fingerprints vanished. “Tell us about your friend.”
Logic only slowed Ron down for a moment. “How about you come to our place, and look after the kids for a few hours while me and Hermione go out for a pint, then?”
Harry felt inexplicably warm at that, and stood, clearing his throat. Malfoy stood as well, and gestured for Harry to follow him back out through the warehouse, and to the front door of the shop. It was strange to pass through the warehouse doorway again, for the dozens of figures milling about the shop aisles to suddenly disappear, for the wall to become solid again, and to walk silently down a row stocked with a dizzying array of personal lubricants while following Malfoy’s confident strides. When they reached the front door, Harry hesitated for a moment, then struck out a hand. “Er, well, thanks again Malfoy.”
Harry plugged the phone into the charger, and rolled over onto Draco’s side of the bed. Only two more days til he’d be home.
Harry’s mouth twisted wryly. “Yeah, apparently a front garden full of rubber dicks isn't everyone's idea of a good time.”
That caught the girls’ full attention, and Harry favoured Ron with his most withering look. “You only sent it up this afternoon. I’ve barely read the case file.”
, not think, and that thing may one day get him killed, but it still seemed to be right nearly every time.
“Sorry,” he said, when he saw Malfoy watching him with narrowed eyes. “That’s a bit gross, I know. Let’s go in and get the insides done, and I’ll clean up properly before we eat anything.” He laughed. “I probably smell a bit ripe.”
Harry nodded solemnly. “Yes, sweetheart.”
“Have you broken it?” Draco heaved the pack onto his shoulders, and began the hike across the damp sand. “Why is it making that noise?”
“Mmmm, for approximately the rest of your life, yes.”
“On the table,” Potter said with a waggle of his brows, and Draco gave him another two fingers for his trouble. “Seriously though, I’m happy for you to take the lead on this. I’m only the consultant, after all.”
“Have you actually moved since I saw you last night? Or have you permanently reserved this seat.”
“As long as you’re not into goblin porn mate, I think we can accept almost anything.” Ron’s grin fell slightly. “It’s
“You’re angry at me.”
A very large trunk full of lace. “That’s quite delicate Potter, be careful. They only make it in one tiny village in northern France!”
It had been many years since he’d seen or really heard much of Malfoy, before meeting him at the shop. One evening spent molesting a sex doll together, and one spent half-drunk and leering at near-nude clubbers wasn’t really a foundation for much. They’d talked a bit, but Harry really didn’t
Then Malfoy let him go as abruptly as he’d grabbed him, turned and Apparated away.
“I like you sweaty,” Harry said, low. Draco bit his lip. “I want to make you sticky, too.”
“One final word, ladies and gentlemen,” Scrivener boomed. Draco shielded his eyes, and watched the children screeching in the water, a life guard treading water nearby and watching carefully to make sure none of them tried to drown one another. “After a great deal of consideration, I would like to announce my retirement from the Department of Magical Games and Sport.” Draco’s head snapped back to the Undersecretary immediately.
