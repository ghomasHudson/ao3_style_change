Harry opened his mouth to say something before closing it quickly and looking at the floor. He had been freaking out ever since Draco had agreed to go on a date with him. Harry hadn't been able to eat because with all the butterflies in his stomach and his head buzzing, there was no way on Earth he'd be able to swallow a bit, let along a whole plate.
"I know you were." Harry's eyes flicked down to Draco's crotch and smirked. "I need to ask you something."
"I'm fine, mother."
"Draco."
"Pansy, Blaise, I need to talk to Potter alone. Don't even think about spying." Draco said, before grabbing Harry's wrist and dragging him along the corridors into an empty class room.
Harry looked at his reflection in the TV screen. He was still breathing heavily, sweat lined his forehead, his cheeks were flushed and his eyes were wide. Harry could see where Ron was coming from.
"I was going to propose today."
Draco nodded his head in reply.
Draco couldn't help but smile slightly at hearing Harry's voice. Draco loved listening to Harry's voice, he could listen to it for days.
Malfoy hadn't said anything all day, only shooting Harry smirks and winks. It was almost worse than the little insults thrown around because at least Harry remembered to be a functional human being when insults were being thrown at him. Harry needed to do something because he couldn't focus on anything without Malfoy invading his mind like the plague.
With that, Draco walked out of the room and got all the wrapping paper, labels, scissors and sellotape. He ignored Harry's complaints and whines as he wrapped the presents. They had gotten presents for pretty much everyone they knew. To most people's surprise, Harry was the one who was amazing at wrapping presents. After about 10 minutes, Harry had stopped complaining and Draco got on with wrapping the presents. He heard Harry sneeze and cough every now and then. He had about 5 presents left to wrap when he heard Harry have a coughing fit.
Harry searched up YouTube on his laptop and got up a compilation of all the John Lewis Christmas ads since 2007.
tw: homophobia, mentions of physical and emotional abuse, mentions of rape and sexual abuse, mentions of depression, anxiety, PTSD and anorexia, mentions of homelessness, mentions of suicide and self-harm
Draco stared down into the forest green eyes before leaning down to capture Harry's lips in his.
He watched as a sick, twisted grin made its way onto all three of their faces.
Draco sniffled as they pressed their face into the crook of Harry's neck. "I don't know." They whispered as they clutched onto Harry's shirt.
"Ron doesn't know what?"
"What if he's by my place, or yours?" Draco asked.
Hermione had made the best Christmas dinner ever. The turkey was cooked to perfection, and the potatoes were roasted amazingly. Everything was perfect. Lots of crackers were pulled, Harry winning none. He stole Draco's paper crown though and placed it on top of his messy curls. After dinner, presents were opened from each other. Lots of hugs and 'thank yous' were shared.
"I'm sorry Dray. I didn't mean to worry you. This is going to sound like the shittiest excuse but I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry." Harry wrapped his arms around Draco.
"It's honestly like he's disappeared off the face of the earth. We've been doing this everyday, the police have been searching for him everyday but there's no trace of him. Even magical tracking isn't picking up anything." Hermione said.
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine and crossed his arms to try and stay warm. It wouldn't work, of course, it was like three degrees outside but Draco just didn't want to go back inside. He didn't want to look at the flat because everything just reminded him of Harry. Draco had slept at Ron and Hermione's a couple of times because it was just too painful to be inside his own home.
"I haven't, it has to have been well over a week since I last spoke to him. Let me ask Ron." Hermione said. Draco waited a few moments. "No, he hasn't heard from him either. Why?"
Next, Draco found himself staring at the lipsticks. The red one he had currently was nowhere near finished, so he didn't need a new red one but he wanted another one and Draco knew exactly what colour he was looking for. He scanned the display, all the colours were so pretty and Draco wanted to buy all of them but he knew he couldn't. Not if he wanted to keep his makeup a secret. Draco's eyes immediately lit up when he saw it. A tube of black lipstick. Draco smirked to himself as he added black lipstick the the mental image of himself. He knew he would look stunning with black lipstick on and he couldn't wait to see Harry's reaction.
i hope you all enjoyed this fic :)
"We have potions together in the afternoon so let's do it after that."
"Have you ever done it before?" Harry asked as he payed for their tickets.
Draco slipped the gold band onto Harry's finger. The words 'Until the very end' were engraved on the inside.
Draco and the two officers were led to the living room inside the house. Draco looked around. Jesus, this place hadn't been decorated since the nineties, the only modern thing was the flat screen TV. Petunia and Dudley sat on the sofa and Vernon sat in an armchair. They looked like every other family but god, were they far, far away from being like every other family. See, most families were sane, this family was not.
"You don't care?" Draco said, slightly in shock.
"Hey Hermione." Harry gave her a hug back. "Ron." Harry shook his hand before bringing him into a hug.
"Harry, for the love of Merlin, please don't get a beer one."
It was 11:50am and the vows were going to start at 12. Hermione, Ginny and Harry rushed downstairs and waited outside the door that led to where all the guests were sat and where Harry's future husband was waiting. Arthur was also waiting outside. Harry had asked Arthur to walk him down the aisle because he was like a father to Harry and Harry wouldn't have wanted anyone else. As soon as the clock began to strike 12, Harry pushed open the door.
"It's beautiful. Thank you so much." Narcissa kissed Draco's cheek.
in tiny delicate letters.
"Potter!" Draco screeched. "Put me down right now!"
Hermione managed to concentrate enough not to mess up her potion again.
It started when Draco found some eyeliner under a sofa in the slytherin common room. He knew it belonged to Pansy, she had been whining about losing it all week, saying 'it's the best eyeliner I've ever owned'. Draco rolled the small, black tube between his fingers, he was almost fascinated by it. He could and should give it back to Pansy but she had already ordered a new one so it wouldn't matter and also, Draco was curious. He was curious as to what it would look like on him, the stark contrast of the jet black liquid against his own pale skin.
"Harry? Harry? Mate, are you okay?" Ron asked, looking down at Harry with a looked of concern and confusion.
Draco sighed again. He was getting tired of the internal battles and he just needed to clear his head. Draco put on some shoes, his coat and a scarf and headed out of his apartment to the elevator. He stepped in and joined one of his neighbours in the elevator. Draco wouldn't say he was friends with him but they were familiar.
"Because nine times out of ten you lock yourself out of the apartment."
Harry turned his head and looked at Ron, who was stood behind him in a similar suit. Ron shot him a reassuring smile and Harry could feel the pounding of his heart slow down a little, though the thrum of excitement under his skin only seemed to pick up.
Harry leant forward and lifted the legs of Draco's trousers up and there were the things Harry wanted to see. Draco was wearing some light blue socks with penguins wearing Christmas hats on them.
"Harry, Harry Harry." Draco whispered. "I'm going to find you, even if it kills me. I love you."
"Um, yeah. I'm fine, I'm just worried about Seamus, I haven't seen him in a while but I'm sure he fine, probably just crashing at a friends house." Draco said. "Thanks for your help."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Could ask you the same thing." Harry yawned. "Bed was empty so I came to find you."
Sleep came painfully slowly to Harry as he fell asleep to his mind playing the earlier scenario on repeat.
"Oh, yeah. Sorry." Harry loosed his grip on Draco's hand.
"What's been going on with you and Parkinson?" Ron asked.
Harry woke up the next morning and rolled over to snuggle into Draco. Instead of rolling into the familiar body, Harry rolled onto his face. Harry sat up in confusion, also why was it a little bit cold in here and why did he have a jumper on?
"Let's go to the ministry." Hermione said softly.
Draco hadn't even realised he had fallen asleep until he woke to a banging on the door. He tried to ignore it and go back to sleep but the banging was incessant.
(not every country will be on this list)
"Give him a few moments."
Harry lightly smacked the back of Draco's head but smiled despite himself. He grumbled under his breath as he stood up to get the food.
"But it's not the same. We're both better now." Draco tried to hold back a cough but ended up failing.
Draco took out his phone and told Harry that he had to work late tonight and wouldn't be home until a couple of hours later.
"What? Tinsel?" Harry was extremely confused.
"Oh, don't worry. I'll teach you."
Harry sat in silence again before bursting out into laughter. He didn't stop for a good 5 minutes.
"You know christmas is coming up and mother mentioned that she wanted some new makeup so I'd thought I'd buy her some for Christmas." Draco explained.
"Hmm, no, you set it for 150 minutes."
Harry looked up and saw mistletoe fall from the ceiling.
Draco had no idea how long he had been running for but he found himself at his and Harry's place. Not their flat but a forest. There was a small forest about a ten minute walk away from Harry and Draco's flat. If you walked into the forest far enough, you would come across a small stream that you could dip your feet in. It was so peaceful and calm. Draco wasn't sure anyone else knew about this place. He and Harry came here every weekend without fail. It was their safe space.
"Hello. I'm sorry but I don't have an appointment. I wondered if you could just squeeze me in because I found this puppy in the snow about 15 minutes ago and I just want to make sure it's healthy." Draco said to the receptionist.
"I know you will." Draco said, the corners of his mouth curling up slightly.
It took Harry around half an hour to get into town on the bus. In this time, he was thinking about the type of Christmas jumper he wanted to get Draco. It needed to be predominantly black, otherwise it was out of the question. Harry wouldn't return without a Christmas jumper because Draco would win and he didn't want that. As he stepped off the bus, Harry checked his watch and did some quick mental maths. He had two hours to find Draco a Christmas jumper. If Harry was buying a jumper for anyone else, two hours would be too much time, but when shopping for Draco, two hours wasn't enough time. Harry made a list of all the shops he should visit: Jack Wills, Superdry, John Lewis, H&M and Abercrombie and Fitch.
As soon as Draco heard the door shut, he turned to face the Dursleys. He looked at each one of them with disgust.
"You were right when you said the earlier ones were better." Draco said, when the compilation ended.
"Harry! Wake up, it's Christmas!" Ron shouted. A second later, Ron had pushed back Harry's bed curtain to reveal the two boys in each other's arms. "Okay. Cool. I'm just gonna tell Hermione."
tw: strong language, physical abuse, rape. this chapter is very dark, so please don't read it if you don't feel safe doing so.
"Sure." Harry smirked.
"Of course."
"What do you mean?" Hermione asked gently, rubbing circles onto Draco's back.
"Oh, well I think he's in his room doing some homework." Hermione said. "Is everything alright?"
"Thank you." Draco whispered.
"Also fuck gender stereotypes, like whoever invented them, literally nobody asked. You are the best partner I could ever ask for." Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's nose.
"I wonder if I can make this the best Christmas ever." Draco said, softly.
Draco played Silent Night so Harry could hear what it was supposed to sound like.
"Oh my Jesus fucking Christ! I turned all of them down because I've already asked someone and they've said yes!" Harry snapped.
It took a while for Draco to build up the courage to wear the clothes out in public. They took it in small steps: first they wore nail polish out in public, then they wore makeup and finally they wore the clothes they felt most comfortable in. Their mother and father didn't know about anything and frankly, Draco was glad they didn't because Merlin knows how they would react.
"Can I ask you something?" Harry asked, he seemed quite nervous.
"They're Altostratus clouds."
Draco walked past the mirror in the hallway before taking a few steps back. He stared at himself in the mirror. Fuck, he looked awful. His hair was messily pushed back with a few strands falling in front of his eyes, Draco couldn't remember the last time he brushed it. He had very dark circles around his eyes, which were extremely bloodshot. He had light stubble on the bottom of his face. Draco hated stubble on himself but he loved it on Harry. Draco ran his hands over his chin before running to the bathroom and shaving.
"Yes, love?"
Harry linked his and Draco's hand together while Draco placed his other hand on Harry's waist. Harry slowly began to sway to the music. Draco joined in and slowly took a couple of steps around the room. Harry span Draco round, making Draco smile. Harry closed the gap between them and looked up into Draco's eyes.
Harry was still recovering but he was slowly getting better. He had spent one week in a muggle hospital before Draco transferred him to St. Mungo's where he stayed for another week. He had to attend therapy twice a week and he had been prescribed a lot of new medicine.
It was two days before Christmas Day and Draco got what Harry had been asking for ever since they moved in. A kitten. A tiny, fluffy, grey kitten with white socks. Draco had picked out the smallest he could find, he picked out a little boy. Draco knew the name Harry would want to call him. He also knew the name that Harry would've wanted if he was a female. If the kitten was a girl, it's name would've been Pip, but because the kitten was a boy, it was given the name Boo. Draco knew it was the perfect name. Boo had a habit of hiding and then jumping out. It was quite cute. Boo was the only thing that was making a tiny smile break out on Draco's face. Everyone was so glad to see this. Draco needed Boo and Boo needed Draco.
"Aw, thanks Pans." Harry said.
Pansy's lips turned upwards slightly. "Like you could take me down, Weasley."
"I didn't kill someone, you dimwit. What- why would you think that?"
"Please, I'll be less that half an hour." Draco begged.
"Harry!" Draco struggled underneath him but Harry was quite a bit stronger. He still played quidditch, which Draco was
"Uh, can't say I have." Draco said. Ron nodded in agreement.
Draco wasn't sure if they were supposed to hear that or not so they just looked down at the floor, silently basking in the compliment. They turned to go back into the fitting room but stopping before they closed the curtain.
Harry waited as Draco went over to ask a worker whether they had any Colorado Blue Spruces. When Draco came back, he told Harry that the worker said that there was only one left and it was in the fourth aisle, middle right. Draco and Harry walked to where the worker said the tree was and the found it. It was laying in its side so Draco pulled it up.
"I understand. I'll be back three weeks on Monday."
"That fag deserves nothing but death." Vernon spat.
"And when I say anything, I mean anything. You know, like sex, where to buy the best lube and toys-."
So he just screamed.
"Yeah, you didn't but it's a bit of an emergency." Draco nodded his head down towards the puppy.
"My hair isn't working." Harry replied.
"By the power vested in me by Merlin, I hereby pronounce you husband and husband. You may now kiss."
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. He did not just say that. He did not just say that. Harry looked around and judging by everyone's shocked expressions, he had definitely just said that. Harry was sure his expression matched everyone else's because that was possibly the dumbest thing he has ever done. Harry felt a part of him die inside because he knew the pestering would get worse and he knew it wouldn't be long before he shot a hex at Ron. Harry mentally slapped himself before turning to meet Ron's shocked and confused facial expression.
If Draco could take away all of Harry's pain, even if it were just for a moment, he would because no one in the world deserved it more than Harry. What Draco would give to see Harry without his pain and trauma.
"So, hows everyone holding up?" Neville asked, his caring nature too big to be kept silent.
"Draco." Harry breathed. "You look..."
"Hotel Chocolat or Lindt?"
"Harry, it's 10. Why have you got mince pies?"
"I love you." Draco whispered into the phone before ending the call and turning to face Hermione and Ron.
"The beds comfier so I think I'll stay here. Thanks for the offer though." Harry said as he slipped under the covers and looked at Draco with a smirk.
Harry just stared at Ron who just stared back at him as he put his shoes on.
Harry noticed a gentle Christmas playing quietly in the background as he walked into the library. He walked over to where Draco normally sat and found his favourite person. Harry went to give Draco a hug from behind.
"Ah, right. Well, tell him I said get well soon."
Draco had no idea how they managed to end up with someone perfect but they were so thankful for it.
The vet came back with a small bowl of food for Bud. "I think what would be the best course of action for the little one is take him home for tonight and drop him off at a shelter in the morning, unless you want to keep him of course."
"It is actually kind of perfect isn't it."
Harry sucked in a deep breath and shut his eyes, waiting. It would only be a few moments now, he could wait just a little bit longer. He couldn't blame himself for being impatient, he had been waiting and waiting and waiting for this moment to finally arrive and if he had to wait any longer, he might scream because
Draco stood there awkwardly, not really knowing what to do. Pansy was currently caressing his face. Normally, he would've shoved her hand away and told her to 'get the fuck off him' or something like that but right now, he was too confused to do anything.
Draco just nodded as he sunk down into a seat.
Harry gave a Draco a look that said 'no'.
Draco pulled Harry around the ice until Harry could kind of skate by himself. This is when Draco started to show off. He did a couple of spins and jumps, earning a couple of claps from the public. Harry took notice of a guy who was staring at Draco. Draco looked over in the guys direction and the guy winked at him and started showing off. Harry did not like this at all. Not one bit.
Draco kept knocking and calling out Seamus's name because all he wanted to hear was an answer. He just needed an answer. Draco heard the lift open behind him but kept knocking.
Harry returned the middle fingers, laughing, as he backed into his room to get ready. He sighed contently to himself as he shut his bedroom door and smiled absentmindedly as he got out the clothes he was going to wear. Harry was happy, he was truly happy. The early stages of his life were horrible but at the moment, he had a good life and Harry was so thankful for that.
"Don't try me Weasley." Draco said, threateningly.
Harry leant forwards and captured Draco's lips in his own and Harry knew that anyone who got to kiss them like this would be star struck. The feeling of Draco's breathing, the small noise they made in their throat, the softness of their lips, the warmth of their skin, it all made Harry feel like his heart was breaking apart and being mended together again, over and over. Draco's hands tightened around Harry's waist, their mouth pressing against Harry's bottom lip and god, what Harry would give to feel like this constantly.
He walked into the living room and was greeted by a very confused looking Harry.
Draco raised his eyebrows and shook his head before returning to his search for the baking brush. By the time he had found it, Harry had managed to clean up all the milk and successfully get it into the cup without spilling any. Draco gently brushed milk over the top of each mince pie whilst Harry sprinkled sugar over them. When they had finished, Draco put the mince pies in the oven.
String. Different coloured string lead from photo to photo, from bits of paper to bits of paper, from wall to floor, from floor to furniture. The bright yellow colour of the string almost seemed obnoxious, like it was purposely shoving its happy colour in Draco's face.
"The what?" Draco asked.
He walked over so he stood in front of Harry before getting down on one knee and pulling out the velvet box he had been keeping in his drawers for over a year.
Harry and Draco spent about 30 minutes building the perfect snowman. It was made up of 3 balls of snow, gradually getting smaller as they went up. They were perfectly round and were placed on top of each other just right. Draco sent Harry to look for stones and sticks to act is the snowman eyes and arms while he finished off the head. Draco was nearly finished with everything when he felt something very cold collide with his head.
Draco honestly preferred the silence, he liked it when people didn't talk sometimes. This was a situation where everyone walked on eggshells, scared that they were going to say something wrong or something insensitive. No one wanted to be the person who said the wrong thing, especially at a time like this. In the end, it was Neville who broke the silence.
"Pans, are you free this weekend?" Draco asked.
tw: extreme amount of pain, hints of sexual abuse
"Belle?" Harry asked.
"I'm sorry, Dray."
"Wait, you said magical tracking isn't picking up anything, right?" Ron asked, suddenly sitting up.
It felt wrong to involve the muggle police in this. Draco was used to working with wizards and only wizards and wizards could do so much more then the muggle police. But, as much as Draco hated to admit it, Hermione was right. There would be a higher chance of finding him.
"Don't you have enough suits already?"
It had only been recently, around the start of advent, that Draco stepped back into his and Harry's house. Even more recently that he started sleeping there again. Draco had been living at Pansy and Blaise house. He was scared of being alone, he needed everyone. Everyone was upset, why wouldn't they be, but Draco... Draco was broken. He couldn't sleep. He couldn't eat. He couldn't force a smile. He was only alive because his mother and Molly somehow convinced him to eat every night.
"It's so scary." Hermione sighed. "I never thought something like this would happen to us."
The seven reached the doors of the great hall but Harry stopped outside.
"Yep."
"I don't know if I'm the right-,"
"Are you okay?" Harry asked, looking at Draco as if they were the entire world. Just looking at him almost made Draco break.
what happened?
Harry burst into a fresh set of laughter. Draco sat watching him for 5 minutes with a very unamused look on his face before he got up and decided to leave. He would just have to perform a solo, it wouldn't be the same but at least it'd be something. He was just about to open the door before a voice stopped him.
As Draco got ready, they couldn't help but make themselves look extra nice on the off chance they would run into Harry. They made sure their clothes had no creases and that their eyeliner was even. Draco gave themselves a once over in the mirror and felt satisfied with how they looked, the blue flares made their ass look good and the soft lavender hoodie made them look cute and approachable. Perfect.

"I know, just, you know me." Hermione forced a laugh to hide the fact she was lying to Harry's face.
tw: mentions of eating disorders, self-harm, PTSD, anxiety, flashbacks/nightmares, abuse, rape
"Uhhh, the biggest."
Kingsley's eyes scanned the room before landing on the empty chair.
"Ron, that's a little bit of a stupid suggestion. Our friends wouldn't kidnap Harry." Hermione said.
"Fine. We'll go after I see Molly." Draco said.
"Uh, yeah. Pretty much." Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
"I'm sorry for all of this." Draco looked down at the floor, they didn't mean to burden Harry like this.
All three whipped their head around and looked at Harry. A smirk danced on Draco's lips when he saw who it was.
"I'm tired so I'm going to nap instead of going to dinner. One of you bring me back a pumpkin pasty." Draco said, not waiting for a reply before heading towards the slytherin common room.
Jesus Christ, chat? Chat? A chat is what you did when you went for afternoon fucking tea, not when you're reporting a missing person.
"Yes, but it is in the drawing room as it is quite big."
Harry and Draco both wore their Christmas jumpers to Pansy's party and Draco received a lot of compliments about his and every time he got a compliment, Harry just smirked and winked at him.
Draco hung his head and let the tears fall freely down his face. He didn't notice Harry's hand moving and his eyes slowly flickering open.
"I understand. Well, we'll be off now but we'll make sure to keep you all informed."
Draco had seemed to have caught up to his mind when he found himself in an empty part of the park. He had to go, Harry would want him to. Draco double checked no one was around before getting out his wand and apparating to Godric's Hollow.
Draco lightly pushed Harry into a chair.
Harry glanced down at their hands, which were loosely intertwined, almost like a constant reassurance that the neither of them wanted to let go and escape one another. Harry saw a burst of colour on Draco's arm as they rolled up the sleeves of their shirt. Harry raised Draco's arm and looked at Draco for confirmation that it was okay before running his fingers over it.
Harry smiled to himself as he thought about what he wanted. He wanted to run his hands over every line, dip and crevice in Draco's body, he wanted to feel hot lips and heavy breaths, he wanted to learn about Draco in ways no one else could, he wanted to wake up next to Draco forever, he wanted the lazy mornings wrapped up in each other's arms, he wanted to be the one to cause the singular dimple that came out when Draco smiled, he wanted the unnecessary blankets Draco had on the sofa, he wanted Draco's body wash sitting next to his own in the shower, he wanted all the houseplants that Draco kept on every surface because it was all just so
"Maybe it was never the right time. You never know what goes on inside someone's head." Ron said.
"I won't sir, I'm sorry sir." Hermione apologised as she went to clean her cauldron.
"Yay!" Harry's voice was dripping with sarcasm.
Draco's heart pounded with excitement as he leant closer and closer to Harry. He almost expected Harry to turn and run away, but he didn't. Draco met Potter's gaze, his eyes full of anticipation before he pressed kiss to Potter's neck leaving a perfect red kiss on his skin.
"Draco, it still could've happened. You wouldn't have been with him all night. Look at me." Draco flicked his eyes over to Hermione. "None of this is your fault, okay. None of this is your fault."
"We need to check the park again." Draco walked away before the other two could say anything.
Why didn't he want to go?
"I know what you've done to him. I know about the abuse, the torment. He still has hundreds of scars. Do you actually have any idea how much you broke him?"
"Mate, you're nearly 18. You literally sound like an 8 year old." Ron said.
"Ron, why am I nervous?" Harry asked.
"Hey!" Harry gently shoved Draco back. Harry leant forward and gently kissed Draco.
Three months of Harry not being here.
"I will force you." Draco poured the medicine onto the spoon.
"Yeah."
"Draco, he's been kidnapped."
"Fucking fine!"
"I know." Harry wiped away the tears that were falling down his face.
"Hm, so mean that I spent three hours baking cookies for you."
"Thank you, this afternoons been great." Draco said.
"Yeah, of course I'll come. I need some new highlighter anyway. Why do you need to go to the makeup shop though?" Pansy asked, her brows furrowed in confusion.
"First things first, have you seen yourself?" Harry then turned Draco's body so the pair were facing each other. "Draco, you're... god, I don't even know how to put it into words. It's like my entire body fills with warmth whenever I'm around you or think of you. I could say all the cliché things as they're true but it's so much more than that. Yes, you make me laugh and smile but you fill me with a sense of belonging. I want to see you at your best and I want to be with you through your worst. I want to wake up next to you and cook you breakfast on a Sunday morning. I look at you and I think 'yeah, I can imagine spending the rest of my life with you'." Harry smiled softly. "Honestly Draco, I think I might be falling in love with you."
Harry felt his feet make contact with the ground and he for a fleeting moment he felt relief before his knees buckled, unable to support his weight. Harry shut his eyes as he prepared to make contact with the ground but opened them in surprise as someone stopped him from falling. Harry immediately regretted opening his eyes as the world spun violently around him. He gripped onto the arm holding him up to stabilise himself.
"You're prepared, this is so unfair." Draco called out. Harry chuckled as he pelted all of his snowballs at Draco. Draco ran inside and ducked under the windows that looked over the quad. "You're going down Potter!"
The men hadn't choreographed a dance, they said they just wanted to dance how they were feeling. Harry obviously let Draco take the lead as Harry had two left feet and couldn't dance to save his life. Both men were staring into each other's eyes and mouthing the words. Once the song had finished, Harry stood on his tip toes and pressed a gentle kiss to Draco's lips. Everyone applauded and joined to two men on the dance floor.
"Merry Christmas, baby." Draco whispered back.
"Yeah, I do."
"Get up! We're going ice skating!"
"No, you look so much more than beautiful." Harry said, as he walked towards Draco.
"It's... it's home."
Draco felt an all too familiar lump rise in his throat. He didn't even try to push it away because he knew that it wouldn't. Draco sunk lower in his seat, hoping no one would notice his blurry eyes or the shaking of his hands. Draco shut his eyes, trying to calm himself down. He didn't want everyone to see him breaking.
Draco, being the aesthetic person he is, brought a Polaroid camera on the trip and had taken hundreds of pictures that he and Harry kept in a box in their living room. Draco got up and retrieved the box. He sat crossed legged on their bed and started going through the photos, reliving his past happiness.
"Harry James Potter, it is one pm so get your ass out of bed before I drag it out!" Draco yelled.
"Hey, Dray?" Harry asked the boy he was cuddled up next to.
Draco licked his bottom lip before drying it with his thumb. He leant forward and ran over his bottom lip with the lipstick, leaving a rich red colour drying on his lips. He kept going over until his lips matched the colour in the tube. The lipstick felt soft and velvety against his lips, gliding over them with ease. He took just as much care with the top lip, not wanting to make any mistakes. He cleaned up the edges of his lips with tissues until it was perfect.
"Hello." Hermione said. Draco could hear the tiredness in her voice.
"The John Lewis Christmas advert that is coming out tomorrow." Harry said. Ron and Draco were still confused. "Please tell me you've heard of the John Lewis Christmas ads."
"I thought Harry would've told you." Draco smirked.
"Right." Pansy snickered. "Well, I'm just gonna go. Sorry for interrupting your date."
"Yeah."
Draco squeezed his hand and sent him a questioning look.
"You're forgiven."
"What?" Draco's heart immediately dropped. He knew this wasn't good just by the paramedics tone.
can't tonight babe, we have the reunion remember?
"No, I would like to stay and talk for a while." Draco replied.
The rest of the walk to the apartment was filled with light conversation. Harry was so glad that both Ron and Hermione so easily accepted Draco and held no grudge against them for their school days. It was a welcoming and refreshing reminder of just how amazing his friends were and just how lucky Harry was to have them in his life.
"Wait until the next one." Harry smiled.
Draco let Harry put the tinsel up. Draco forbid him for putting any on the tree. He claimed that he didn't want to ruin the 'masterpiece of the house'. Harry sighed but obliged. He didn't put the tinsel on the tree.
Draco was just about to turn around and leave when Harry tackled him to the floor. Draco screamed in shock and the two fell to the floor. Draco was cursing at Potter the whole time whilst Harry was just laughing.
"Okay, this won't take long. Before I say this, I just want you to know that I'm not trying to be inconsiderate because I know what you're going through must be really hard and I haven't made this decision lightly but I can give you three weeks before I need you to return to work."
Draco looked at Hermione, worry laced on her face, and that's when the whole world came crashing down around him.
"Still demanding as ever, I see." Harry smirked.
Harry nodded slowly as the world slowly stopped spinning and he stood up slowly, supporting his own weight. Harry could feel Draco's hand on the small of his back rubbing soothing circles into his back.
"Wow! That was so difficult, wasn't it?" Harry's voice was dripping with sarcasm. Absolutely dripping with it.
"Perfect, let's go over it again one last time." Hermione said. "So, I'm we are going to set up the mistletoe just before the lesson and make sure no one goes under it. Once we leave, I'll be walking with Harry and you'll be walking with Draco. Then we'll both push them under the mistletoe and they can't leave until they kiss."
Draco and Ron were looking between with confused looks on their faces.
Draco muttered something under his breath.
Draco jumped and woke up. "What? What's happening?" Draco looked up and saw Harry. "Harry, are you okay?"
"No."
"No I didn't!" Draco said, a little desperately.
"Uh, yeah. I guess I am." Harry giggled.
"Are you okay baby?" Draco asked, rubbing Harry's back.
"Excuse me Draco but who gave you the right to look this good?" Belle asked, gushing over Draco's dress.
Draco followed his friends into a small cafe and sat down at a table.
"Yeah, I'm just stressed out." Hermione replied.
"I'm not going to give you money because you still don't fully understand it but I'll give you my card. When you go to pay, just place the card in front of the card reader, okay?" Harry held his card out to Draco.
Before Draco payed, he picked up several brushes, some setting spray and some makeup remover. Draco swung his bag happily as he left the shop and met up with Pansy who was waiting outside. Pansy looked him over, looking suspicious.
"Draco, are you okay?" Hermione asked, softly.
"Of course."
"I'm sorry." Harry whispered. He leant up and kissed Draco gently. Harry was about to pull away but Draco pulled him closer.
"Please." Harry was desperate to see Malfoy with the lipstick and eyeliner again.
The paramedics were rushing Harry to the ambulance which panicked Draco as he knew that it meant it was a lot more serious than he thought. He turned to Hermione, tears in his eyes.
Harry clutched his hand over his chest, his heart thundering so hard in his chest that he felt dizzy. Harry fell onto his bed, he was so utterly fucked but he didn't care at all.
"Of course you can but be back in time for dinner."
The two had been together for a month, and very early on, the topic of Voldemort and the war came up. They had had a long conversation about Voldemort and the war and how it had affected them but they had come to the conclusion that it was okay to make jokes about it, but the minute either of them felt uncomfortable, they would stop.
"All right, all right. Let's go then." Draco smiled.
"I have no idea. I set the timer and everything."
Draco and Harry had spent the evening decorating their house with Christmas decorations. Their house looked stunning but there was just something missing and Harry couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. It wasn't until he looked at the tree again until he realised what it was.
"You are, Harry." Draco said. "I love you so much."
Draco looked down and ran his fingers over the bracelet. He wondered if Harry was still wearing it or if the kidnapper had taken it.
Draco picked up the box that contained Bud and held it behind his back. Bud was quite light so it wasn't too hard. Draco handed Harry the bag full of the things for Bud first. Harry rooted through the bag with confusion.
Harry wanted to laugh but one look from Draco quickly shut that idea down. He would quite like to make it out of this night alive.
He quickly ran a hand through his hair and decided that it looked good enough. He had long since given up on trying to tame his curls and it had taken four hours, a pair of straighteners and a whole bottle of hairspray for Draco to give up too. Harry quickly rifled through his bag, making sure he had everything he needed before swinging it over his shoulder and walking out of his room.
Pansy rolled her eyes. "We're meeting up with Blaise, Astoria and Daphne for lunch."
Harry grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him up off the stool. He threw the invisibility cloak over them both and they slowly walked back to the Gryffindor common room. They stopped outside a window on the way to admire how beautiful the Black Lake looked in the moonlight. The light of the moon reflected in the water, beautifully distorted.  They crept silently back to Harry's dorm and into bed.
Draco placed his hands on the edges of the sink and looked down. He could feel the tears threatening to spill. That's when he became aware of the bracelet sitting on his wrist. He had always knew it was there but recently he had just forgotten about it. He slid it off his wrist and held it in his hands.
Harry looked at Draco with an amused look on his face. "Of course I can."
"I've missed you so much baby." Draco said, his eyes full of tears.
Even though Draco was tearing up at seeing Harry's face and seeing how happy he looked, every photo managed to make Draco smile. Draco could almost hear the photos and laughed to himself as he remembered the stories behind some of the pictures.
"I'll see what I can do." The receptionist looked on her computer at the moment. "You've come at the perfect time. There is around 20 minutes before the next appointment is due. If you walk through the door, you should find the vet."
"This is- this is-," Ron's face broke out into a huge smile. "This is awesome! You two look so good together!" Ron walked towards Hermione and hugged her. "I'm happy for you 'Mione."
Draco smirked as he noticed how flushed Potter was. There was a pink dusting over his cheeks and he couldn't seem to get a sentence out for the life of him. A different flush ran through Draco's body as he realised exactly what was happening.
Harry opened the box and his eyes lit up when he saw what was inside. "Boo."
Harry didn't say anything, he just picked up his wand and flicked it. The music changed from upbeat to soft and romantic. I'll Be Home For Christmas by Micheal Búble. Harry walked up to Draco and stuck his hand out.
Draco felt a spark of joy as they eyed all the new clothes. They saw a soft grey cardigan and picked it up, thinking that it would be good for lounging around in. Draco walked slowly between the aisles of clothes, running their hand along the material. They stopped in front of a black denim pinafore dress and a black and white striped long-sleeved top to go with it.
"Why?"
The environment was comfortable and friendly. Everyone was talking, eating and just having a good time. Harry shut his eyes and let himself bask in the warm sunlight and soft grass. It was so peaceful here and Harry knew that this was a memory he would take and store forever.
Draco smiled softly at Harry. The small dimples on their cheeks, the way their eyes crinkled slightly and they way that they smiled with their eyes was all the same as it was five years ago. Harry felt a warmth run through his veins and he knew that his crush on Draco was returning, not that it ever really left in the first place.
Harry took a big sip from his latte and felt immediately more awake. Harry swore that stuff did miracles. Draco and Harry sat and drank their drinks and talked about some really random things. About an hour later, they were ready to leave.
As soon as he was out of the Great Hall, Harry ran to his dorm to grab his invisibility cloak before sprinting to the slytherin common room. He muttered the password and entered into the room. Draco had given him the password a while ago, the two sometimes went to each other's dorm room during the night so they could sleep next to each other. There was something so calming about being in the presence of Draco.
"Like joking or seriously?"
"It's so beautiful." Draco whispered. Draco turned to face Harry. "I love you."
"Yes, Ronald. Stop complaining." Hermione said, getting out her wand.
"Yep." Harry got off the top of Draco and helped him up.
"It's okay."
"It was just a question, jeez." Pansy muttered.
Draco crawled around to the door next to where Harry was standing. He looked up to see Harry cautiously looking around for Draco, two snowballs in either hand. Draco quietly stepped out and grabbed two handfuls of snow. He crept up to Harry before shoving both handfuls of snow down Harry's back.
It had been a long road to get where he was today. Harry had always supported and accepted the LGBTQ+ community and most of his friends were a part of it but accepting himself was much harder than he expected. It was only when he finally sat down with all of his friends and talked about his confusion and doubt and fear did he really accept the fact that he was bisexual, leaning towards men.
"Fine. Yes I'm wearing Christmas socks, but only because I didn't have any other socks to wear." Draco admitted.
"Uh...," Harry pretended to think for a moment. "Nope. No, I didn't."
Soon enough, the pair were the only ones left skating around the rink. It felt like they were in their own little world where they could both be who they wanted to be without fear of judgement. Words didn't need to be spoken at that moment, there was no need.
It wasn't until Draco had reached the far corner of the graveyard that he spotted the graves. Draco felt oddly lost as he stood in front of the graves. He knelt down and used his wand to place a wreath of flowers by each grave. After he had finished, Draco didn't stand up, he just stayed kneeling on the floor.
Draco nodded before being pulled into a hug by Ron. Draco returned the hug and felt a single tear roll down his cheek. Draco pulled away and stepped into the fireplace. They took the Floo to the ministry, it was the fastest way.
Draco sighed and put some change into Harry's hand.
"Why?" Draco asked.
Draco lay down on the sofa and placed the bracelet over his heart.
Draco jumped when he heard people enter the common room, he immediately wiped off the eyeliner and hid the tube deep in his bedside drawer. He couldn't let anyone see him wearing makeup, his father would not be happy of he found out Draco was wearing makeup. Also, the other students would probably make fun of him, whether he looked stunning or not didn't matter, the fact that he was wearing makeup, annoyingly stereotyped as a 'girl thing', would be enough to make the other students ridicule him for the rest of his time at Hogwarts. At least that's what Draco thought.
Harry looked more closely at the person trying to figure out where he had seen those eyes before. He could see that colour and gaze in his mind like he saw them yesterday but the memory that they came from was foggy and unclear. He took a sip from his drink, and then all of a sudden it hit him.
Draco nodded and smiled at the man. The rest of the ride down was held in a comfortable silence. The doors opened and the two parted ways.
The banging just became louder and louder.
"Come back with me." Harry whispered as he gently ran his hand through Draco's hair.
He was rifling through the photos when one caught his attention. Draco wasn't sure what it was about this photos but it just jumped out at Draco. It was a photo of Harry, laughing. His eyes were focused just above the camera and Draco knew that Harry was looking at him.
"That boy was never right in the head. You know, I wouldn't be surprised if he killed himself. I mean it's about time." Petunia said.
Light conversation filled the air as Harry led Draco to their date spot. Harry was still trying to comprehend that he was actually on a date with Draco. He was also slightly worried that Draco wouldn't like the place he had picked to have their date. Harry knew he was taking a risk when he decided on this place, knowing that it wasn't exactly everyone's cup of tea but Harry though it was a risk worth taking because this had the potential of being a really great date.
A couple of days had passed since their anniversary and Draco felt worse than ever. Nothing could take his mind off Harry. All Draco saw in his mind was Harry, all Draco heard was Harry's voice and all he dreamt was Harry. Draco hadn't slept at all, he was scared to. He didn't want to dream of Harry coming home, only to wake up and find out that it was all in his head.

"Well..." Ron slowly turned back around and stuck both his middle fingers up at Harry, though the effect was ruined by Ron's failing attempts at not to laugh.
"I could've been naked." Harry said.
"Mean."
"Please." Draco said, his voice shaking. "It's an emergency."
Harry is missing.
"Yes, sir. I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted."
"I would do anything to make sure your happy, Draco." Narcissa whispered back.
"Well you should've tried harder." Draco snapped.
"Draco?"
"What's happened to him, Hermione?" Draco asked. "Where is my Harry?"
An idea suddenly came to Draco. Maybe the tradition could be saved, this could either go fantastically or horrendously.
Draco stepped into the apartment. The once comforting place now felt cold and unfamiliar. It felt like all the light had been sucked out. Nothing felt right anymore, everything felt like too much. There was too much room in the apartment, there was too many things.
It was a Saturday morning when Draco's owl dropped a small package in front of him. Draco felt his heart skip as he picked up the letter and ripped it open. Immediately he recognised his mother's penmanship and a smile made its way onto Draco's face. He quickly banished it though, Draco was notoriously grumpy in the mornings and he didn't need people questioning why he was so happy that particular day.
Think, Draco, think. Where was Harry last night?
Harry stood there for a moment with his hands over his mouth and his eyes welling up.
"It's cute." Harry's voice cracked as he tried to hold back his laughter.
"I also have a stag and a doe over my heart and a stitch one that just flies around." Harry absentmindedly placed his hand over his heart.
"You two are good together. The nargles will be kind to you." Luna said cheerfully, before skipping off in the direction of Ginny.
"What do you mean you've asked someone?" Ron asked, his mouth still in an 'o' shape.
"Now." Draco flicked his wand and a christmas song started playing. Harry recognised the song, Mistletoe by Justin Beiber. Pretty much everyone in Hogwarts was obsessed with this song.
"Wait. Really?" Harry looked up at Draco.
Maps. Draco didn't think the maps he had were even readable anymore because there was so much pen on them. The pen circled everywhere Draco hadn't searched yet and crossed everywhere Draco had already been. There were a lot more crosses than circles and that scared Draco.
"I'm not going." Harry announced to whoever was listening.
"No problem. See you around."
He opened Harry's contact and scrolled through the messages Draco had sent over the past few days. Draco had found his coping method, he liked to send Harry texts and voicemails. He has no idea if Harry is able to read the texts or listen to the voicemails and he knows there will be no reply but just knowing that Draco and sent them made him feel slightly at ease.
"Want to go for a walk?" Harry murmured into Draco's ear.
Draco sat down and sighed. This promise was all he could think about and Draco couldn't understand why he was getting so worked up over a promise. He needed to push away this feeling that he was making an empty promise but he had no idea how to do that. He could just not promise it anymore but then it would become a broken promise and the thought of that seemed so much more painful to Draco. He could actually say the promise out loud to somebody and promise them that he was going to find Harry but he didn't have anyone to tell. Yes, he had all of his friends but they didn't seem like the right people to make the promise to. Draco needed to make that promise to someone who needed it, to someone who was so helpless in this situation, but he simply had no idea who he could tell.
A light thump and Ron's mutter of "dick" left Harry feeling satisfied.
"Were you staring at me?" Draco asked, sleepily.
Vernon, Petunia and Dudley just smirked.
"Uhh... no." Harry was now sitting on top of Draco. He made sure that he was sitting on Draco's crotch to tease him.
"I can see you, you know." Harry called out from the hallway. Draco stared in disbelief at the space where Harry had just been. "I have eyes everywhere."
"I cannot believe you, Harry James Potter. I am your best friend."
"Come on. Let's make a snowman."
"I'd take fighting Voldemort over this any day." Dean said.
"Right now?" Draco whined.
Draco looked up and saw forest green eyes staring at him. "Harry? Harry! You're awake. Oh Merlin, you're awake." Draco flung himself onto Harry and covered him with kisses.
"Less of the sarcasm please." Ron said, smirking.
"Oh, sorry. My mistake. I just  though you were sneaking out of the house for Merlin knows what reason." Draco said, sarcastically.
Harry landed one final kiss on Draco's lips before walking over to where Seamus, Dean, Ginny and Luna were sat and laid out his own blanket. Everyone gathered round and sat in a big circle and helped themselves to all the food that was piled in the middle.
"Harry." Draco replied, softly.
tw: mention of self-harm
"Yeah, everything's fine and thank you." Draco said as he began to walk towards the stairs. As soon as Hermione had disappeared out of sight, Draco started to run up the stairs.
"Draco, for all I care, you could've come with a table. As long as you're happy, I'm happy." Pansy said, smiling.
Draco wasn't too fond of apparating. The sensation of being twisted around and crushed wasn't the most pleasant but apparation was extremely convenient. Harry hated apparating, it always made him feel dizzy and sick. Whenever Draco was apparating somewhere with Harry, both of them preferred to do side along after a few incidents where Harry had fallen over or passed out.
Harry walked up to their bedroom muttering to himself.
Hermione and Pansy had the perfect plan. After 6 months of planning, this was it. It was going to be amazing. They had planned everything out to the minute detail.
"So, where are you taking me?" Draco asked.
"I've missed you so much." Draco pressed a kiss to the mans lips.
Draco had taken Harry on holiday to Cancun for Christmas. It was always a dream of Draco's to spend Christmas in a hot country and Cancun was pretty hot in the winter. Harry had been a little off throughout the whole holiday. They had been to the beach together, gone shopping, romantic walks and meals but Draco knew something wasn't quite right. On Christmas Eve, Draco decided to ask Harry.
Narcissa squeezed Draco in response.
Harry cupped his hand to his neck, wanting to preserve the memory of what had just happened. He ran a finger over the red lipstick that lay on the side of his neck and looked at it. There was red on his fingers which meant what happened in the changing rooms definitely happened and Harry didn't imagine it.
That's what it felt like. Inside the club it was like dancing on the Northern Lights; beneath the dry-ice smoke swirled an array of ocean blues, acid greens, hot pinks and blinding gold. The alternative music played over the dance floor as if had fused with the bodies, controlling the movements, giving everyone what they so desperately craved, the feeling of elation, to feel the bond that was denied in the coldness of the streets outside. Bottles, glasses, pills, money. Every surface was covered in something but it felt right. The cool, light atmosphere of the club gave a new source of life. It felt free.
As much as Harry wanted to take in the beauty if the hall, he couldn't as every single person in the hall slowly turned to face the two boys who had just walked in. Harry moved so he stood slightly closer to Draco and squeezed his hand in reassurance. Harry could feel the stares of everyone as he tried to gauge what the entire school was feeling right now.
Draco internally screamed at themselves again for not getting Harry's number. Draco couldn't believe their own stupidity sometimes. They made a mental note to text Pansy later so she could yell at them about their own stupidity. That could be their excuse for opening a new bottle of wine tonight: their best friend told them that they were stupid. Not that Draco would argue with that, but still.
Draco grinned before he captured Harry's lips in his own. He would never get tired of this, the way Harry's lips fit perfectly with his, the way he still felt the fire at the bottom of his stomach and the way he still saw fireworks when the kissed. This was something Draco wouldn't trade for the world, because after all, he already had his world standing in front of him.
most of the time
Draco stubbornly turned away from the mirror, not willing to let themselves see them look like that. They took a deep breath and tried to clear their head and heart of fuzziness. Draco took their clothes off and quickly glanced in the mirror. They had always appreciated their body shape, long and slender, lightly defined by muscle.
"Draco, hurry up!" Harry shouted. "I will leave if you're not down in 10 seconds!"
"I'm just on my way to a meeting but I can spare five minutes."
Draco smiled as he slid the silver band onto Harry's finger. He stood up before bringing Harry into a hug. Draco pressed his forehead against Harry's and stared into his emerald eyes. Draco wondered how he managed to get so lucky. Right now, in this moment, everything was perfect.
Draco Malfoy standing there in a mesh top and skirt looking really, really good. Draco looked at Harry, their eyebrows furrowed in confusion before turning back to their drink.
Draco wasn't sure if any of his friends knew about today, they probably didn't seeing as they most definitely would have mentioned it if they did. Draco knew he needed to be around people he trusted to keep himself grounded. The bracelet on Draco's wrist made him feel ever so slightly better as it was like he had a tiny part of Harry with him today.
"No."
A phone ringing pulled Draco from his thoughts. Draco sighed as he saw the name on the screen, Althea Downvale, head of St.Mungos. She was the only person in the hospital that held higher authority than Draco and Draco knew what the call would be about.
Professor McGonagall had decided to hold a Christmas Ball for the whole school. After the war, the students weren't as happy as they used to be, everyone seemed a bit uneasy and on edge. McGonagall knew she had to do something to raise the spirits of everyone before Christmas. She remembered how everyone enjoyed the Yule Ball before the Tri-Wizard Tournament and decided that a ball would be the perfect thing. It was announced at breakfast that the ball would be held in the Great Hall on the Saturday before school finished. It was only a week away.
Ron's mouth dropped open in surprise. "Have we seriously been watching the office for five hours?"
The next morning, Harry and Draco were awoken by a banging on their door.
"Hey, Harry. Do you smell burning?" Draco asked, sniffing the air.
He groaned into his pillow. Tonight seemed so far away, he just wanted to see Draco again. He was so fucked but he didn't care one bit. All Harry could do was feverishly await the evenings arrival.
Draco reached Seamus's flat and knocked on the door. And knocked again and again and again.
Draco went to the bathroom to get Harry some cough medicine. They seemed to have run out of the black currant flavour which meant Harry would have to have the lemon one. Harry hated lemon. Draco walked back to their room with the lemon medicine and a spoon in hand. Draco knew a disagreement was going to occur.
Usually, Draco's arm would hit the chest of his boyfriend. Harry and Draco had been together for four years now, they had gotten together in their eighth year and since finishing Hogwarts, they lived together in a flat in London. Draco and Harry loved living together because they loved each other. Harry was Draco's universe, he was the reason Draco got up in the morning, he was Draco's happiness.
"I'm happy for you Harry. I truly am. I'm so glad you've found your person."
Him standing there and Draco walking towards him dressed in a beautiful white dress that flowed down their frame perfectly was so right that it made Harry want to laugh and smile, scream, shout and cry.
"I ordered food earlier, it'll be here in twenty minutes." Draco said as they flicked through the channels, stopping on one that was playing his favourite romantic comedy.
Draco stared at the spot Pansy was just standing, their brain taking a few moments to register what she had just said.
"You... I can't believe you got this for me." Draco whispered.
Harry walked up to his dorm, shut the door, flopped onto his bed and screamed into his pillow. People were really goddamn annoying sometimes. Harry groaned and rolled over, he knew everyone was going to be asking who he was going to the ball with and he honestly would rather throw himself off of a cliff than endure the questioning. Harry hoped Draco wasn't going through the same thing because Draco was not a people person.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the evening watching Netflix. Draco went to bed very excited for the next morning. When Harry woke up the next morning, he was very surprised to find Draco not lying next to him. He wandered into the kitchen to find Draco opening his calendar.
"Maybe I do, maybe I don't." Harry shrugged, teasingly.
"Come on." Draco grabbed Harry's hands. "I'll pull you until you get the hang of it."
Draco narrowed their eyes suspiciously. "Why did that sound sarcastic?"
"I hate you." Harry said, his fond tone completely betraying his words.
Draco pressed a gentle kiss to Harry's lips. Harry and Draco got ready to go out and get a tree. Draco drove to the shop and the two went outside to find a tree. There was all kinds of tree but Draco seemed to know his stuff.
Draco was sat on the sofa and he could feel the frustration slowly begin to build up as he kept going over things in his head, trying to spot just something that would help them but he couldn't find anything. Draco sighed before sitting up and counting to ten, this calmed him down as he focused on counting rather than everything else swimming around in his head. He finished counting and headed towards their bedroom, he just needed to sleep.
Harry rarely went anywhere alone, he liked having someone with him to provide him with a sense of security and safety. The only place Harry went alone was Godric's Hollow where his mum, dad, Sirius and Remus were buried. Harry went back to his birthplace every month to visit their graves. Draco offered to come with him every time but Harry had always declined. Draco knew that Harry needed his space and it was still very painful for him and Draco knew Harry would bring him along one day when he was ready.
When the two pulled away, Draco pressed a kiss to his cheek and when Draco did that, Harry felt like he was going to melt into a puddle of emotions and affection because he loved Draco
Harry turned and faced Draco, confused. "Sure." Harry turned to Ron and Hermione. "I'll catch up with you guys."
"I'm going to personally lead this investigation and I promise we won't stop until we find him." Kingsley said.
Harry hadn't realised how long he had been thinking about Draco until a loud banging noise came from the opposite side of the door. Harry jumped and scowled at the noise for ruining his peace.
The two drove to the nearest supermarket and went inside. They passed several bits of tinsel that made Draco want to throw up. They were so tacky, like how were they even legal? Eventually they found some plain silver tinsel. Harry first grabbed an armful but Draco told him to put most of it back. Harry protested at first but gave in as he knew he wasn't going to get anywhere. On their way to the checkout, Draco picked up a tin of Roses for him and Harry to share. Draco knew to leave all the strawberry dreams for Harry and Harry knew to leave all the signature truffles for Draco. The two paid for the tinsel and the chocolates and drove home.
"Fucking rude. I am never ugly." Draco turned to Harry. "Right Harry?"
Draco ended the call and sighed before heading to the room where the meeting was held.
And honestly, Harry didn't blame younger self because Draco looked stunning to say the least. Harry watched as a person approached Draco and strike up a conversation with them. Being an auror, Harry was extremely good at reading people's body language and right off the bat he could tell Draco was uncomfortable. They stood tight and upright with their hands were folded in front of them. Their movements were stiff and their expression mirrored one of discomfort.
Draco tried to see what Seamus was pointing at but all he could see was empty fields and a slight smudge of grey. He also tried to remember what Seamus was shouting, but he just couldn't. It could've been anything, it could've been about a tree for all Draco knew.
"They healed me and the eyebrows grew back, thankfully."
The tree looked stunning in their grey and white themed living room. Draco put the tree in a stand whilst Harry went upstairs to get the decorations. There was no tinsel, Draco hated tinsel. There was loads of white, silver and blue decorations and a few red and green decorations. They had an elegant silver star that would sit on top of the red and white lights to be wrapped around.
Hermione stood close to Pansy as she slipped an arm around her waist. "Yes, I am."
Draco had been yelling Harry's name so much that his voice had become hoarse. There was a sick feeling at the bottom of his stomach. How was he going to cope without Harry? How was he going to function? Draco's heart was unrelenting as it pounded against his chest, sending gallons of panic around his body.
"Oh, of course. Place the little one down here." The vet motioned to the table.
Draco smiled fondly as he opened a cupboard revealing their mug collection. The two had way more mugs than they needed but they couldn't help but buy a new one every time they went shopping. Draco reached blindly into the cupboard and pulled out a mug. He laughed softly when he saw which one it was. Draco went through a phase a couple of years ago when he was obsessed with Britney Spears after Harry and introduced him to the song 'Toxic'. As a joke, that Christmas, Harry bought Draco a mug covered with Britney Spears's face.
Three months.
Then there was eyeshadow. Draco wasn't too sure about eyeshadow, he wasn't sure if he needed it on top of eyeliner and mascara and it all seemed a bit too colourful anyway. Every palette had some sort of colour on it and Draco didn't see the point in buying it if he wasn't going to use the colour. He was about to move on until he saw a palette in the corner of the display consisting only of whites, greys and blacks. Draco pictured himself using the palette to create a smoky eye look and immediately put the palette in the basket.
Draco leant into Harry's hand and sighed contently.
"No, Dray. It's so beautiful. I love spending time with you and going on walks by the beach. I just miss Christmas."
"And they said yes?" Ron asked, like he couldn't believe it.
"Well it's not like you're gonna be wearing it."
"I think it would be best to tell the muggle police."
Draco had never been to Godric's Hollow before. He knew it was inhabited largely by the magical community but some muggles lived there. Draco had always wondered what Godric's Hollow looked like, whether it was a lively place or more quiet. Draco wondered if Harry's home was still there, if it had been rebuilt, knocked down or just left how it was. He also wondered what Lily, James, Sirius and Remus's graves looked like. He wondered if they were the most decorated graves, if there was always flowers next to where they lay.
"Of course you were." Ron patted Harry's shoulder before going back over to his mirror and fixing his dress robes.
"What?" Draco whispered, his voice trembling slightly.
"You're the best, mother!" Draco quickly got his slippers and dressing gown before following his mother downstairs.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the day together before parting their separate ways to go to their dorms. Harry went to sleep praying it would snow overnight.
Draco had no routine anymore. He had taken a break from work, Draco was sure he would have lost his mind if he was still at work. Draco found himself eating pasta or cereal at midnight and having a shower at 3am more often than not. Draco honestly didn't know what to do with himself anymore, he just felt so lost. He felt trapped.
"Harry, can I have some muggle money please?" Draco asked.
"Thank you." Draco whispered, leaning forwards and capturing Harry's lips in a short, sweet kiss.
"Draco." He gasped.
"Thank you, and once again, I'm really sorry." Althea said.
"Yeah."
"Not another word, Potter." Draco glared at Harry but there was no harshness behind it. "What about you? Do you have any?"
Draco had so much to say yet nothing at all and it was confusing him. Draco had no idea what he was feeling right now, he just felt empty. He felt no emotion, no sadness or anger, he just felt lost within himself. Draco never knew it was possible to venture so far into your mind that you don't know if you're going to come out again.
Draco decided that instead of wallowing in self-pity and embarrassment, they would go out shopping. They had been meaning to pick up some new clothes and they had nothing better to do with their time so Draco got up and mentally slapped himself before getting ready.
Draco scrunched their face up, pondering for a moment. "Yeah, I would. Don't test me."
Three months since Harry went on that auror mission.
"Do these have like magic in them or something? Like, I didn't think it was possible for me to cry this much."
"Sure, Malfoy." Ron laughed.
Draco wanted to punch them. The sadness and shock on their faces was so obviously fake.
"Okay, so I believe this is the last present. There is a reason I have been saving it until last. So, Draco." Ron passes the present over to Draco.
Molly had welcomed Draco with open arms. She took care of him like he was her own child.
"Yes, Healer Rhodes?"
"Hello, Althea." Draco greeted.
Draco loved all of his friends and they had all been really supportive and helpful through this entire hellish nightmare. Well, he says all but he hasn't heard from Seamus in quite a while. Actually, he wasn't sure if anyone had. He was always coming up with some excuse as to why he couldn't come to any meetings or hang out with anyone.
Both Harry and Draco shuddered slightly at the memory.
Harry looked up at Draco and smiled as the whole school clapped for them. He heard a couple of whoops, presumably from his friends. Harry saw Draco's gaze focussed on something and as he followed it, he realised he was staring at Pansy who was motioning for Draco to come over.
Before Draco had the chance to reply, Harry gently pressed his lips against Draco's in a sweet kiss. Draco hummed happily and sighed contently as the two broke away and curled up into Harry's chest. Harry wrapped his arm around Draco, a comforting weight leaving them feeling safe and secure.
Harry searched around in a few drawers before finding the cookie cutters. He took the biggest circular on and handed it to Draco. Draco went to cut a circle out right in the middle of the pastry.
As Harry and Ron approached Draco's place, Harry shot them a quick text letting them know they were here. Harry took a deep breath and wiped his slightly sweaty palms against his jeans. Was he nervous? Why was he nervous?
"Hey."
Harry stumbled over his feet and felt a heat rise to his cheeks. He wasn't expecting that. When Draco complimented him, Harry was convinced his heart wanted to be a professional gymnast because there was no other explanation for why it was flipping so violently in his chest. Harry wasn't complaining though, the warmth that spread through him felt like it came from the light of a hundred suns. It was almost like Draco was his own personal sun, shining bright for everyone but shining particularly bright for Harry.
firstly, what the fuck does that mean? aura my ass
Draco pulled Harry around the ice a couple of times before letting go of Harry's hands and letting him glide by himself.
The five of them stayed out a lot longer than Draco would have liked and it was a relief when they headed back towards the castle. Ideally, Draco would've like to return to the castle hours ago but Pansy was being stubborn and wouldn't let Draco go back. At least whilst everyone was at dinner, Draco could put on his new makeup without fear of interruption.
"Nothing." Harry replied quickly.
"Right, so you are gonna start like this and then move your arm across your body whilst straightening and bending your knee." Draco demonstrated the start of the dance.
"That was hilarious." Draco laughed.
"No, I actually need to talk to you."
"I know you don't want to hear this but this conversation needs to happen sooner rather than later. Mr. Potter is showing no signs of improvement, he is getting worse everyday. The rest of the healers working with Mr. Potter and I have had a lengthy conversation and we think it would be best if Mr. Potter is taken off life support in the new year if he still shows no improvement. Of course the decision would be up to you but this is what we think would be best moving forward." Healer Rhodes said.
"How long do they need cooking for?" Draco asked.
Draco bent over, his heart pounding in his ears. He didn't know what to do.
"A few? Bullshit, more like half the school." Seamus snickered.
After saying goodbye to Draco, Harry ran back to his apartment as fast as he could. He wasn't really sure what had just happened because the whole time, it had felt like he had ascended to heaven. He wasn't really sure why he was running away either, he enjoyed what just happened but also slightly scared because Harry made a mess of a lot of things in life but this was one thing that he could
"Thank you for an amazing Christmas." Harry pulled Ron and Hermione into a hug.
"Oh, Draco." Hermione whispered, her voice shaking slightly. Hermione led Draco into the living room and onto the sofa.
"What day is it?" Harry asked.
"Hey baby." Draco fell into Harry's hug. "Are you okay?"
"I knew you were wearing Christmas socks!" Harry called out, triumphantly.
Harry didn't develop crushes quickly, it was just something that didn't happen. His crushes involved a lot of angsty pining before Harry realised he liked them and by that point, it was often too late. He couldn't have just developed feelings for Malfoy like that and the more Harry thought about, the more he realised he didn't develop feelings for Malfoy just like that. Harry had always thought Malfoy was good looking and he always had admired his stubbornness and unwillingness to back down from anything he set his mind to. Harry did often find himself thinking about Malfoy and what he was doing, staring at Malfoy in class and following Malfoy's name on the marauders map.
i mean, you do bottom most of the time-
Harry just shot Ron a glare that cause him to laugh, slightly irritating Harry.
"Harry, aren't you coming in?" Hermione asked.
"And you didn't think to tell me who it is?"
"Nightmares. Nothing new. I could as the same of you." Harry replied.
"Harry, I have embrace the festive spirit, I just don't show it in the amount that you do."
"May or may not might've missed the cup when I was pouring the milk."
"What? I'm not hiding anything." Harry laughed. "Why are you so clingy today?"
They hadn't had a dream like that for months. Draco had forgotten just how terrifying and damaging they could be. Spirals of doubt began to form in Draco's mind as they shakily filled a glass with water.
"I love you too."
"Oh, I see." Harry said. "That must've taken her a lot of courage. Uh, next time you see her, can you tell her that I'm happy that she can live her life as she wants to?"
Draco made sure the guy was gone before he leant against Seamus's door. He was so confused, where the fuck was Seamus?
Draco turned away from the woman and carried on towards the church. The interaction he just had was strange but it was quite reassuring. Maybe it was the fact that he saw another human alive in this place, but whatever it was, he felt more at ease now.
Harry opened his mouth to protest but closed it promptly when he realised that Ron was right. He really did need to work on his social skills. Harry silently stood up and began to make his way towards his room.
"You didn't..." Draco whispered in shock, running their hands over the material.
"I hate you."
Harry stared up into the storm grey eyes. "Of course."
"We need a cookie cutter." Draco said, when he'd finished rolling out the pastry.
"Oh, my dear boy." Molly brought Draco into a hug. "You know I'm always here for you, no matter what."
"All right, let's not get ahead of ourselves." Harry laughed as he took a bite from a cookie. "They're not actually too bad."
Draco sat on the sofa and wrapped his arm around the raven haired boy. The two had been dating since just after the war.
"Draco, mate, are you alright?" Ron asked.
"Very nice. I was thinking of getting a Lint one. Or a beer one."
"There are signs of sexual abuse. We won't know for sure until we are able to do a proper examination at the hospital but there was blood on his trousers and as he has not cuts near that area, it suggests something may have torn and whenever someone touches his lower torso, he seemed to subconsciously flinch." The paramedic said.
Draco felt their cheeks heat up. "Really?"
Harry could barely think about what he was doing as he pulled Draco's closer to him and locked eyes. But everything became clear when he felt the soft touch of lips against his own. It was in that moment when a million loving thoughts collided and exploded as the rest of the world fell away, leaving only him and Draco. It was slow, soft and comforting in ways words never could be.
"We have no idea. No one has any reason to take him."
While waiting for Hagrid to bring the tree, Harry helped Draco had up the lights. When they were finished, there were icicle lights hanging from the banister of the stairs, smaller lights all around the top of the room and lights wrapped around pretty much every piece of furniture except the chairs and the sofas. All the lights were white, they looked very elegant. There were some coloured lights but Draco refused to use them. When Harry said he was going to put them in the tree, Draco grabbed a pair of scissors and chopped them up. Just as they finished, Hagrid arrived with the tree. The tree was perfect, not to bushy and just the right height.
"I love you too."
thankful for.
"Right, I'm going to wrap the present while you stay here."
"This is the third time you've said this, what's wrong now?" Ron asked.
"Oh. Whoops." Draco stifled a laugh.
"You so were." Draco grinned and gave Harry a playful shove.
"Wait, wait. I'll help but only because I love you." Harry sighed.
that? Who kisses their childhood crush (maybe current crush) on the cheek after not seeing them for five years on the cheek? And who doesn't ask for their number after doing that?
Draco worked as a healer but had been allowed time off work. He couldn't think. He couldn't focus. He couldn't do anything. He never imagined that he would have to treat Harry for something as bad as this. There had always been a possibility, Draco knew that, but never in a million years did he expect it to happen.
"Don't cry." Harry whispered as he gently wiped Draco's tears away with his thumb.
"Yep, I got everything." Draco replied.
"Harry." Draco exclaimed, slightly surprised to see Harry in this shop because as far as they knew, Harry was never one for shopping. "What are you doing here?"
It was confusing, to say the least, not knowing who you are. Everyday Draco's head was screaming at them 'this is not who you are', over and over. Always being labelled a boy, everyone always using he and him. It made Draco hate the world along with themselves.
Draco chuckled hollowly. "It's stupid."
"Fuck off. Actually fuck off."
"Alright, calm down. I'll just wait until the ball to find out." Pansy said, raising her hands.
"I do." Harry slipped a sliver ring onto Draco's finger. The inside was engraved with the words 'Forever and More'.
"Why'd you bring me here?" Draco asked, tilting their head slightly to look at Harry.
"I know. I still don't think it could top some of the earlier ones but you never know."
"No, Miss Weasley, I'm not saying that. We will never lose hope but what you need to understand is that it's very difficult to continue with this investigation with no leads."
"Oh, I don't mind. They said 'why don't you be a good boy and come be my slut' or something like that." Draco's eyes dropped to the floor in discomfort. "Which I had a lot of problems with. Firstly, I hate the word slut. Like hate it hate it, I just find it so degrading and just really not a nice thing to say. Secondly, it's like I just met you, so no, I'm not going to go and suck a strangers dick. Like I'm sorry but I have standards."
"No, what is it?"
"Liar. You did have other socks to wear." Harry smirked.
"I'm here to see you."
whatever, i'm gonna top you tonight
What if Draco doesn't show up? What if it's been an act this whole time? What if Draco doesn't actually like him? What if this was all just an elaborate prank?
"Shut up." Harry tried and failed to hold back a smile.
"Fuck off."
"I think it would be best if we got a Colorado Blue Spruce." Draco said.
"I mean... the mornings aren't exactly your best friend." Harry teased.
Draco sometimes wondered how such a damaged person could light up a room so easily, but then he remembered it was Harry. Harry who could do anything and everything. It was sometimes scary to remember what Harry had been through, Draco couldn't even begin to imagine the pain Harry felt. Harry's anxiety and PTSD were still severe and he suffered with nightmares, flashbacks and panic attacks, but he was getting better. Harry had made so much progress over the last few years and Draco was so proud of him. But this, this would just take back every bit of progress Harry had made and this made Draco's heart break. Knowing Harry might be back where he was when they first started dating killed Draco. Harry deserved nothing but happiness.
And interviews. So many fucking interviews. The ministry wanted interviews. The Daily Prophet wanted an interview. The muggle police wanted interviews. Every muggle newspaper and news station imaginable wanted an interview. It was so incredibly frustrating to Draco because the same questions were asked over and over again.
"I love you too. More than you could ever imagine." Harry whispered, taking Draco's hands and pressing a kiss against their knuckles before lowering them down to their waists.
Harry got out of bed and subconsciously placed the slippers on his feet that weren't there before he went to sleep the previous evening. Harry pulled open the door that led from the rest of the apartment to the bedroom. Harry stood there in shock at what was in front of him.
"How?! How did this happen?" Harry asked in disbelief.
"I know, it's just, you scared me." Draco leant down and placed a kiss on Harry's forehead. "I'm just gonna grab you some cough medicine."
The clock chimed 8 and the ball had officially started. All the 8th years made their way to the Great Hall. Draco arrived before Harry and decided to wait outside.
"What if it's someone we know? One of our friends?"
"Do you have them with you?" Harry asked. The question was so vague yet Harry was sure Malfoy knew exactly what he meant.
"Get you dressing gown and slippers on and come downstairs. I've made you your favourite breakfast."
"I'm so bored, Dray." Harry whined.
Hermione and Draco walked back downstairs. "Yeah, the colours match perfectly. You've done a good job." Draco said, as they walked back into the kitchen.
"I cannot believe you just did that. You have just wasted so much room on the pastry."
The silent thought that occurred every day inside Draco's mind. Draco wouldn't help but feel as if it was a somewhat empty promise, they'd checked three places on Draco's list and they still hadn't found Harry and did it even class as a promise if he didn't actually say it out loud? And who was he promising it to? Himself, yes, but other than that there was no-one.
Draco got into the ambulance and let out an involuntary gasp when he saw Harry. He was lying down in the bed with his shirt taken off. Over half of his torso was covered with bruises and his ribs were painfully obvious. Several cuts also littered his torso and all Draco wanted to do was kiss Harry and reassure him it was alright.
"Have you ever had hot chocolate before?" Harry asked.
Draco couldn't be happier that all of Harry's abusers, the people who made his life hell, were all in prison. He saw a change in Harry too, he seemed less on edge and more at ease. He was so proud of the progress Harry had made. Sometimes, he just watched Harry go about his day because he couldn't help but admire him. Harry was so much stronger than Draco could ever put into words. Harry was so much more than he ever could be, he was so much more than anyone could ever be.
"Is that... Pansy Parkinson?" Ron asked, as they approached the figure. "What's she doing here?"
Harry was dressed in a traditional tuxedo. Jet black with a crisp white shirt. The blazer and trousers tailored to fit perfectly. A single white lily was gently sitting in the breast pocket of Harry's blazer. Harry wanted lilys as the flowers for the wedding and Draco agreed. Hermione and Ginny had been trying for the last half an hour to get Harry's hair to do something but they were failing. Miserably. His messy curls refused to be flattened or styled in any way. Eventually, the two girls gave up. The did some finishing touches and stepped back to admire Harry.
"I'm aromatic, Harry, so I'm not quite sure how to want me to respond to that." Ron deadpanned. "Anyway, who are you not sure about being in love with?"
"Jesus Christ, Draco. You're alive." Hermione brought Draco into a hug.
"That's actually a pretty good idea."
"Well, if they wanted Harry, why not just take me?" Draco said.
Draco was struggling to comprehend the words that were flying out of these three monsters mouths. They didn't care about what they did. They didn't care that they broke a human being. They didn't care that they destroyed Harry's life.
"Harry. You will not get better if you don't take this."
"Thanks, I guess?" Draco said.
"Of course. We'll go out to the shops in a bit and we'll find one."
"Yes. Yes they are."
"Can I have some change for the bus please?" Harry asked, quietly.
"Jesus Christ, Harry!" Ron exclaimed.
"Mum, come to our flat. I think Draco needs some support right now."
The warmth became more intense, and they felt the heat spread to their cheeks. But they couldn't break away, despite the embarrassment. It felt like in this moment, the two only existed for each other, stuck in a bubble just for them. The trance was broken by the doorbell ringing. Draco looked up at Harry and hoped that he understood that they would not be moving.
"Draco, look at me." Hermione said. "You can do this. I'm going to be with you throughout the whole process, okay."
Draco and Harry had gotten together during their 8th year at Hogwarts. They were tired of hiding their feelings for each other and both admitted their feelings at the same time. Ron thought it was absolutely hilarious. When finished their 8th year at Hogwarts, they decided to move in together. They had a flat just on the outside of London, not to far from where Ron and Hermione lived. Harry worked as an auror and Draco was a healer at St. Mungos. Draco still hadn't quite got the hang of how muggle things worked. He hated the microwave and dishwasher and he was terrified of the toaster (though Draco referred to it as the tooster which Harry found so cute). Draco also didn't really like going to muggle shops as he still didn't understand quite how muggle money worked but he was learning.
It was Christmas Eve and everyone was getting ready for bed. There was a big pile of presents under the tree all wrapped in red and green paper. There was a sense of magic in the air, the fire was slowly dying and the fairy lights dimly lit the room. Snow was gently falling outside, the ceiling of the room mirroring outside.
Their eyes... don't even get Harry started on Draco's eyes. Harry had held the belief that Draco's eyes were simply grey or silver for a long time but any traces of that belief were wiped out when Harry had taken a true look into Draco's eyes. Spirals of metallic grey collided with ocean blue droplets and faded out into the lightest blue at the edge of their irises. Their eyes weren't grey, that had simply been Harry's terrible judgment. Their eyes were breath-taking.
"I've got a stomachache so I'm just gonna go back to the common room." Harry said, not waiting for a reply before he walked out of the Great Hall.
"To my room so I can gay panic." Harry replied.
Harry didn't say anything, he just kept staring at Draco and munched on the cookie.
"Will you need help picking stuff out for your mum?" Pansy asked.
"Did I make this the best Christmas ever?" Draco asked.
"Apple pancakes?"
"Uh, yeah, I-I need to go." Draco said, quietly.
"What the fuck?" Draco spun around and was greeted with a snowball to the face. And another to his chest. And another to his stomach. "HARRY JAMES POTTER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!"
"Right, have you set everything up?" Pansy asked.
Harry stood in front of the mirror, closely examining himself, picking apart everything that looked wrong. There was a wrinkle in his top, a tuft of hair sticking up (who was he kidding, all of his hair was a mess) and did his jeans even match his top?
Harry shot him a confused look and mouthed the words 'why are you so happy'. Draco just smirked and winked at him before sitting down to eat breakfast. Draco kept one hand in his pocket, holding the tubes of eyeliner and lipstick in his hand. He couldn't wait until he could stash more makeup in his pockets.
Draco looked at Harry and raised an eyebrow. "Cookies don't take three hours to make."
"How long has it been?"
Draco ran over to the ambulance, he needed to get there as quickly as possible. Draco still didn't know the full extent of the injuries that Harry had but he knew they were serious. Draco couldn't help but panic because what if there was something seriously wrong with Harry.
And then it hit Draco.
"Come on! We're all getting bored here." Pansy called out.
"Yes Ron. I turned them all down." Harry said, through gritted teeth.
Draco looked at Harry, some warmth in their eyes returning.
"Teach me how to play something."
"Oh, I wasn't aware I had an appointment now." The vet said as she noticed Draco.
"Draco, come here." Harry called out.
The day was finally here. Christmas Eve, oh and it was also Harry and Draco's wedding. Ever since they first got together, Harry and Draco had dreamt of having their wedding on Christmas Eve. They had been planning since they first got engaged. Everything had to be perfect, the newspapers were calling it the wedding of the century. Harry and Draco hardly thought it was 'the wedding of the century', they just saw it as two people vowing their eternal love for each other.
Harry made a happy noise at the back of his throat and carried on. Draco wasn't sure how long the two had been sitting on the sofa, the movie had changed at least twice and they could feel themselves slowly drifting off to sleep. The low buzz from the television and the pleasant sensation that ran down their spine from Harry running his hands through their hair turned out to be the perfect, soothing combination.
Everyone ordered (Draco just getting a black coffee) and thanked Dean. Everyone got their drinks and quietly sipped. A silence fell across the table, no one knew what to say. It was strange because everyone had so much to say but didn't know where to start.
It was going to be hard, but they were going to get through this. Draco knew it would take time but he was going to make sure that Harry felt safe and happy and he was going to make sure that Harry knew he was loved so much. He was going to help and support Harry through this.
"Best Christmas ever." Draco said, whilst running his hands through Harry's hair. The two were disturbed by shouting.
"One more question." Harry took a deep breath. His heart was pounding, Harry didn't think he'd ever been more nervous in his life. "Would you like to go as my boyfriend?"
"Yeah. I'm sorry for shouting, forgive me?"
"Yeah." Draco held out his hand for Harry to take.
Even though Harry was so clear to Draco in this photo, nothing else was. He couldn't remember where this was taken. Draco looked at the rest of the photo. He saw Dean and Seamus in the background, Dean was driving and Seamus was pointing and what looked liked shouting at something.
"Yes babe?"
"Yeah."
Harry raised his hands in defeat. "All right, all right. I'm going."
maybe tomorrow
"I'm sure you are, the problem is me. I'm a lost cause."
Harry rolled his eyes. Of course he was going to play it this way, it was Malfoy.
"Oh, Draco." Narcissa gently placed her hand on Draco's arm. "I'm sure he feels exactly the same."
"Merlin, if you're so desperate for my company just come with me because I'm going anyway!" Harry sighed, exasperated.
As soon as the taxi stopped, Draco shoved the money into the mans hand and jumped out of the car and ran into the small block of flats.
Draco placed his head in his shaking hands and sighed deeply. He climbed out of bed and walked out onto the small balcony. He leant his hands against the railings and looked up at the sky. Draco wasn't exactly sure what he was looking for but he couldn't help but examine the sky.
"Why?" Draco whined.
A shooting star flew through the night sky, overthrowing all other stars for a fraction of a second.
Harry looked at Ron incredulously.
"Well, open it and find out." Narcissa's face was decorated with possibly the biggest smile Draco had seen.
"You don't need a coffee, you want a coffee." Draco said.
As much as Draco tried to push it away, he couldn't help but worry that Seamus had actually taken Harry. He kept telling himself that he couldn't jump to conclusions and he wouldn't jump to conclusions because Seamus was their friend.
The husbands danced and laughed throughout the night. They caught up with their old school mates, ate food and had the best time of their lives. At ten minutes to midnight, Harry and Draco said their goodbyes to everyone before heading up the hill that lay just outside the burrow. The men would be going on their honeymoon tomorrow afternoon, after they had spent Christmas morning with the Weasleys and Hermione.
"Yes." Draco sighed. "On one condition, we only get silver tinsel. Only silver."
"Merry Christmas, Harry."
The pain was unbearable. It is the sort of pain that burns, as if some invisible flame was being lit inside of Draco. It seared through Draco's abdomen but the worst was when it hit his heart. It felt as if someone had sent a spear straight through the middle of his heart. He felt as his heart broke and shattered into a million pieces across his chest. Draco began to claw at his chest, desperate for the pain the go away. Dark red scratches lay above his heart as if he was trying to rip his heart out.
"I never really thought about it to be honest." Harry shrugged his shoulders.
Draco just stared at Harry. "I hate you."
"Of course I will." Harry whispered and he ran towards Draco and pulled him into a massive hug.
"Draco, are you okay? You've been acting a little strangely over these past few day." Narcissa asked, gently.
"Shh, it's okay, it's okay." Draco squeezed Harry's hand and pressed a kiss to it. "You're home now."
He looked towards Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle and they were all just nodding their heads in approval. Draco nodded his head before turning back to Pansy. Draco was confused as to why she hadn't questioned why he had gone with Harry.
Draco sat on top of a rock, shut his eyes and listened to the gentle trickle of the stream. When it was hot, sometimes Harry and Draco dipped their feet in the clear water that ran through the forest floor. It was peaceful and beautiful here, no matter the season. In the summer, the rays of the sun broke through the trees, illuminating parts of the forest and there was so much wildlife. In the winter, everything frosted over, giving the sense that you were in some sort of winter wonderland. It was just perfect here.
"Don't lie to me." Draco said, softly.
The glances and looks that Seamus shot Harry and the way he always seemed to be walking alongside Harry whenever everyone went out together used to seem like nothing, but now they were everything.
Things started to get better when Seamus was caught. He had been apparating around the world and it had been extremely tricky to catch him, but they eventually did. Seamus got sent to Azkaban for kidnap, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, rape and use of an unforgivable curse, and there he would stay for the rest of his life.
Draco recognised the voice immediately and felt frustration rise up within them before the promptly fell back onto Harry's lap to go back to sleep.
"Of course we won't know for sure until the patient confirms it but all the signs are pointing towards it." The paramedics voice was laced with sympathy.
"Hello? Earth to Harry." Ron waved his hand in front of Harry's face.
Not real, not real, not real, not real, Draco repeated in their head over and over as they waited for the tightness in their chest to loosen. Their heart was still hammering in their chest as they reminded themselves that they were safe, they weren't back at Malfoy Manor, Lucius was in Azkaban and they weren't drowning
"Who else is here?" Draco asked.
(That was actually one of Draco's favourite memories. The way Harry had just said "Of course" and took his time and was careful when he painted their nails just made Draco's heart melt every time they thought about it).
"Draco, it's not Christmas without a proper tree!"
"We should do this again sometime, Harry."
Harry already had his coat, hat and gloves on and waited for Draco to get his on. As soon as Draco had got them on, Harry dragged him out the door. A new Starbucks had opened just a five minute walk from where Harry and Draco lived. Draco grabbed Harry's hand and moved it so Harry's arm was over Draco. Harry tried to hide his smile so Draco wouldn't have the satisfaction.
and thats the end of 'skirt'!! i hope you enjoyed reading!!
"Everything is so beautiful." Harry whispered.
There was a sheer gloss coating their lips and a white highlighter was delicately dusted across their cheekbones. They had some light eyeshadow but what stood out most to Harry was the eyeliner. Draco had made it look perfect and it somehow managed to accentuate every feature of their face and show off just how pretty their eyes really were.
"I don't know." Draco replied, trying to push the lump in his throat away.
"What? No, why?" Draco faked a smile, looking slightly confused.
"Yes?"
His nails, once a nice length and a nice shape, were now bitten down and looked ugly and jagged. Harry had to get Hermione to file them for him and he put a charm on his hands that prevented him from biting his nails. He also had to try and stop himself from biting his lips. He needed to look his best tonight for Draco, who would undoubtedly look stunning.
"That's so boring." Draco complained.
"Harry James Potter, 23 and he was last seen last night around one o'clock at a house party."
Tears blurred his vision as he made his way to the door. Draco was breaking again and a part of him hoped someone would follow him and catch him but another part wanted them to stay so far away from him.
They were so close yet so far from finding Harry. It was so frustrating because it was like they were lost. No one had no idea how to continue the investigation, it's like they kept running into wall after wall in a maze, no one knew how to reach the middle and it was starting to affect Draco.
Draco's head instantly whipped to the side, they knew that voice.
"Alright, but if you ever want me to slap her, I will."
"Well, I don't want our extremely playful kitten to play with the tree and make a mess of our living room!"
"Then I'll buy you some chocolates or something." Harry said, throwing a sweater on.
"You did all this for me?" Harry asked, close to tears.
"He's not with me." Draco had to force the words out of his mouth because saying it was basically confirming his worst fear.
Draco and Harry had stopped throwing petty insults at each other and instead just pretended to ignore each other. Pansy actually congratulated Draco on growing up when she realised he and Harry had stopped fighting. Draco rolled his eyes when she said that but it was true, he couldn't deny it. He much preferred the secret glances, smirks and winks during class.
Draco rubbed a hand across their face, surprised when they felt a dampness on their cheeks. They hadn't even realised they were crying. Draco let out a heavy breath as they swung their legs out of bed and got up to go to the kitchen. The cool tiles were a nice contrast to their burning skin.
Draco sighed. It wasn't just a plausible suggestion, it was a perfect suggestion because it made sense. Draco had never considered this before but now it had been said, it made sense. Draco seriously underestimated Ron sometimes. But, just because it made sense, it didn't bring them any closer to figuring out who took Harry. Draco couldn't think of anyone who would kidnap Harry. Draco didn't think any of them had an evil bone in their body. Their friendship group consisted of Harry, Draco, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Dean, Seamus, Ginny, Pansy and Blaise and they were all so close. Draco didn't want to believe that maybe one of them had taken his Harry.
"What happened?" Draco asked, pointing to his chest.
"There's a second part to the present." Draco smiled as he gently handed the box that contained Bud over to Harry.
"So, Harry. Who are you going to ask?" Hermione asked.
"If you ever apologise for being upset again, I will steal one sock from all of your pairs so you only have odd socks." Harry said as he tilted Draco's chin up so their eyes met again.
As Harry approached Draco's apartment block, he found the blonde just leaving the building. As Draco walked towards him, Harry felt the blood waking up his brain, even though he already thought he was awake. His smile grew of its own accord and Harry didn't want to hide what Draco ignited. Draco could easily become the most fun thing in Harry's world.
Hermione's face remained still for a few moments before her lips turned upwards into a soft smile.
Harry. Draco had never called him that before and it sounded right, they way his name rolled off of Draco's tongue with such ease. Draco raised their eyebrows and smirked at Harry. They pressed a quick kiss to Harry's cheek before turning on their heel and walking away. Harry swore on his life that Draco was swinging their hips a little as they walked away. Harry's heart was pounding in his chest and a fuzzy feeling filled his veins.
"Minor details Harry, minor details." Ron decided to keep the cushion this time and leant back again the sofa, sighing. "What time do we need to leave later?"
"I love you." Draco whispered.
Harry didn't know what he was expecting when he realised he was in love with someone, maybe a monumental moment with music and fireworks going off in the distance. But he wasn't expecting it to be this calm and this simple. His heartbeat didn't even change, it was only the feeling of being whole that came across him as he realised that he didn't just love Draco, but he was in love with them.
Harry just laughed in response.
"Come in." Draco said.
"I would love to."
"Fuck."
"I don't know." Harry groaned.
Harry had been to all the shops and couldn't find anything. Al, the jumpers were too colourful and too bright. All the black ones had some sort of pattern on that Draco wouldn't like. Harry only had 15 minutes left before he had to leave and was beginning to give up hope when it suddenly hit him. He hadn't been to M&S. Harry ran out of H&M and to M&S, luckily, they weren't too far away from each other. Harry ran up the stairs to the men's section and looked around frantically. He just wanted something, anything, but it was all the same as the previous shops. Too bright. Too colourful. There was nothing. Harry was just about to turn around and leave when something caught his eye. Stashed right in the corner, was a rack full of black jumpers. Harry walked towards them and pulled one out. There in front of him, was the perfect Christmas jumper. It was all black and it had a small, brown leather Christmas tree where a breast pocket would usually be. This jumper literally screamed Draco. Harry did a little happy dance in his head before buying the jumper and going back home.
"Your socks, let me see them."
"You do?"
Seeing Draco make Harry's heart twirl. Hearing Draco's honey-like voice made his stomach flutter. Their eyes, those beautiful metallic eyes could tell a whole story just by looking at them. The way they almost floated along, always being the most beautiful wherever they went.
The two woke up in the morning and spent half an hour just cuddling before going downstairs to open presents from each other and family. Draco got Harry some of his favourite chocolates and a framed version of his favourite picture of him and Draco. Harry got Draco a personalised tin of quality streets with just the green wrapped chocolates, because naturally, they were Draco's favourite. Harry also got Draco a black band ring with a tiny but stunning black opal embedded into it.
He took one final glance at the photo before he went to put it away, but then all of a sudden, Draco heard it.
Draco and Harry sat down in the living room and started watching Shrek. The two were so absorbed in the movie that they didn't realise that a long while had passed and the mince pies should've been cooked by now.
"We think he's been kidnapped Luna, Harry wouldn't just walk off."
Harry laughed before wrapping his arms around Draco from behind and peppering the side of their face with kisses.
"Dray, I'm sorry. You're right. She would play with the tree and it would make a mess."
"I would like some blood circulation in my hand by the end of this." Draco said.
Harry swallowed. "I'll be fine."
But, despite having all of this, Draco couldn't help but feel like there was something he hadn't done, like there was something absent from his photo covered walls and his paper covered floor. It just seemed like he hadn't done enough.
Hermione noticed Draco hanging slightly further back from the crowd.
"A mislocator? We learnt about them very briefly in our last year, didn't we? They prevent anyone within twenty metres of the device from being tracked magically." Hermione said, repeating the definition from memory. "But, isn't there only ten in the world?"
Draco chuckled lightly as Harry's awkwardness and Harry shot them a cheesy grin back in response. Draco's heart fluttered and almost hurt at the sight. It was so adorable. Draco never thought that they would use that word to describe Harry but that was completely demolished when Draco saw the slight crinkles as Harry's eyes and small dimples in his cheeks.
"I'm always here for you, Draco. Whatever you need."
"To add to the festive feel and to put on the tree."
"Your feelings aren't stupid and they never will be. Your feelings are valid, you are valid."
Harry saw a light pink dust across Draco's cheeks. He lifted his hand and placed it against the side of Draco's face and gently ran his thumb across Draco's cheek. Harry felt Draco lean into the touch. It was such a simple gesture but it seemed to say everything that needed to be said at that moment as the two boys simply smiled at each other.
"We have some news about Harry Potter, sir. So could we just come inside for a moment please?" An officer asked.
Harry held his hand out and helped Draco up onto the slightly raised platform. Harry couldn't even describe what they looked like in that moment. Maybe like an angel but even an angel didn't stand a chance next to Draco's pure beauty and radiance.

"Good luck on your search for finding absolutely nothing." Draco said.
Harry tilted his head upwards as a sob escaped his lips but also laughing quietly. He didn't know that it was possible to feel this many emotions at once. He also didn't think it was possibly to fall even deeper in love with Draco but, alas, here he was.
"No, sir. Harry suffers from severe anxiety, depression and PTSD and he's not one to just walk off, even when drunk. He only ever sleep at our flat or Hermione's flat." Draco said.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?" Harry grabbed a hold of Draco's arm.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked as he walked into the living room.
and he never wanted to give this up.
Both Harry and Draco shrugged, waiting for Ron to catch on, shooting each other an amused but also mildly concerned glance when he didn't get it after a couple of seconds. It was only when Hermione opened the door and pressed a kiss to Pansy's lips did Ron finally seem to understand, stopping dead in the hallway with his mouth hanging open.
"Harry, what are the cups different than last time?" Draco whispered.
It was the night of the ball and excitement hung in the air. A bottle of fire whiskey had been passed around the 8th year common room to help calm everyone down. The fire whiskey did nothing for Harry or Draco however. Both boys were dressed in their finest dress robes and each boy had put a huge amount of effort into their appearance, wanting to look the best for each other. Harry and tried to tame his curls but had given up. Draco's hair was the definition of perfection.
"Fine, I'll get a Lindt one then."
"What?" Draco asked.
His hair, for once, held no product. It had simply been pushed back to form a small quiff, and even though it wasn't his usual style where each strand of hair was perfectly placed, it seemed more perfect than it had ever been before. You could see small waves in his platinum blonde hair and it just seemed to frame his face perfectly. His skin was flawless and his lips were carefully tinted red. You could see the precision behind each stroke of the red and also the black that framed his beautiful eyes. His eyelids and cheekbones shimmered with white ever so subtly, it was so perfect. Not too much but not too little. His lashes were long and thick, they batted as he waited for Harry to say something.
Harry watched as Draco lightly ran his fingers across the flowers, tracing a few. Their eyes softened as their fingers traced a large narcissus flowers that stood slightly brighter against Draco's skin than the rest of the flowers.
Harry just chuckled and grabbed Draco's hand as they started to walk towards the town so Harry could buy Draco his precious chocolate.
"You know, you never fail to surprise me Ron." Neville said.

"Harry, help me. It's so heavy. It must have an undetectable extension charm on it."

Everyone was having a good time. They were laughing and talking and managed to fit in a quick game a charades before dinner. Harry's cooking skills were excellent. Everything was cooked to perfection and everything tasted delicious.
Draco pulled the jumper out and studied it. He looked a little bit annoyed.
"Come on Harry. There has to be at least one person you want to ask!" Ron exclaimed.
The three began to climb the stairs up to Hermione's apartment and headed towards her door to find someone already standing outside. Harry and Draco recognised who it was instantly but it took Ron a few seconds to catch on.
"I've never dealt well with apparating." Harry explained, going to pull his hand out of Draco's because he didn't want to get their hand sweaty.
"Hey Pans, Hermione." Draco greeted, hugging each of the women in turn.
Not many students came back to complete their final year, there was around 40 students. Draco, Pansy and Blaise were the only Slytherins to come back. McGonagall decided to have one common room for all the 8th years. She appreciated that it would be hard for all of them coming back to Hogwarts as they all fought in the war so she had a kitchen put into the common room if the students wanted to eat their. Every student also had their own room with a double bed, a wardrobe, a desk and an armchair. The room was charmed to customise the colour of the walls to whatever student wanted the room to look like.
Harry could feel annoyance slowly rise up in him as the person talking to Draco wasn't getting any hints and kept moving closer towards Draco. All of a sudden, Draco froze and the person placed a hand on Draco's cheek. Harry felt disgusted at what he was seeing and immediately walked across the club.

Belle reached out one of her front legs and batted on of the expensive baubles.
"You defeated Voldemort. Making edible cookies should be considerably less difficult." Draco deadpanned
Harry just knew this was going to be perfect.
"I'm sorry, it's just, what am I supposed to do?"
It was about ten minutes before Draco's name was called. He and Hermione followed a police officer into a small room.
"Look, I know I may not be the smartest sometimes but I've actually spent a lot of time thinking about this." Ron said, after a minute of silence.
"Okay." Malfoy smirked, he knew exactly what he was doing.
"Oh, I mean that makes sense because reading is so much more important than helping out your best friend who's being harassed from every bloody direction." Harry said, sarcasm practically dripping in his voice. "You know, sometimes I wonder why I even bother!"
"Harry?" Draco ran their free hand through Harry's hair. "Are you okay?"
This new information was overwhelming Draco. He didn't know what to feel. Knowing that a mislocator was involved made it so much harder to actually find Harry because magical tacking won't do a thing but if they find out who stole the mislocator, then they find who stole Harry. Was he supposed to feel happy and excited or even worse than he already felt which he wasn't sure was possible?
"Pansy, hurry up." Draco said, impatiently.
"You know what's annoying? I actually really like this and I'm going to wear in tonight."
Draco tore his eyes away and walked up to the front desk.
His dress robes were black like Harry's but whenever the light hit Draco, you could see a silver sheen. But, even behind all of this, you could see Draco's true beauty because it wasn't his makeup or his clothes Harry was drawn to, it was his eyes. Harry had always labeled them 'grey' and if he was feeling particularly poetic, he called them 'silver' but neither word did them justice. They were so solid, so bright, the exact lustrous color of a polished shard of metal. If you looked closer, like he was just now, you'd see the swirls of glittering ocean blue and tinges of light blue at the edges. They weren't monochrome with a slight bit of blue, that had simply been Harry's terrible judgement. They were beautiful.
Harry rolled out of bed and put on his slippers and wrapped a blanket around himself. Draco got out of bed, surprisingly without any complaints, and put his slippers and dressing gown on. Draco grabbed Harry's hand as they walked out of the room and downstairs.
Harry came sprinting into the kitchen, put some oven gloves on and carefully took the burning mince pies out of the oven. He placed the tin in the sink and turned the tap on. The flames died out pretty much straight away but them smell of burnt pastry lingered in the air.
Harry knew he hadn't developed feeling feelings for Draco just like that. He didn't develop crushes quickly, his crushes often involved a lot of angsty pining before Harry realised he liked them and by that point, it was often too late. Harry had always felt something towards the blonde, being the most oblivious person, Harry thought for the first six years he knew Draco that what he felt towards them was hatred. Until Harry realised that maybe hatred wasn't the reason behind him constantly thinking about Draco or often following their name on the marauders map.
A flash in the mirror distracted Draco and he immediately whipped around to see what was there. His eyes met emerald green ones that hid behind circular glasses. Draco could see that Potter's mouth was open slightly and he immediately felt a rush of embarrassment. Draco grabbed up his things before rushing out of the changing rooms but he didn't get very far as a hand grabbing onto his wrist stopped him.
