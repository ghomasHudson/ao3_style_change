Harry had relaxed a little after that and was taking a sip of his beer when he noticed Travis reaching a hand over under the table, probably to lay on his husband's thigh and he growled.
"I don't fancy anyone," he blurted out. At their weird looks he blushed and turned away, clearing his throat. "I just mean, I have a um- a
The messy haired man nodded before closing his eyes, taking a deep breath and dropping his hands. Draco's eyes moved immediately to follow the movement before going wide at the sight in front of him.
As if in a trance, Travis moved out of the seat with glazed eyes and stood before saying goodbye to the group and leaving. When Blaise turned his eyes to the blond he stood and rolled his eyes.
"Alright," Draco said with a mix of excitement and nerves. He took a few steps back and appraised the man im front of him. "Let's see the surprise then."
to." As he spoke he turned away from the blonde and divested himself of everything but his briefs. "Oh, gods, I want to. Do you know how beautiful you are, of course I want to. I just don't think you'd want to...no one else I've been with-"
Draco thinks it's different loving someone after you've saved their life enough times. Before, even after years of marriage there was always that part of him that still thought Harry pitied him. That Harry was with him out of obligation. Out of an idea of keeping him safe. But Harry was the one in trouble back at the ministry the past week and although Draco had saved him— saved the whole fucking DMLE if Weasley was to be believed— Draco would have gladly given his life to protect his husband. He had
"He's going to see right through you," Travis says, standing in Harry's way. He has his arms crossed and a put out look on his face. Harry is fully prepared to walk away when the junior curse breaker speaks again. "It's obvious that all of this is a ruse. You don't really care about him at all, do you? Just missed seeing your name in the papers, I bet."
"You romantic sod," said Draco finally, pulling Harry in for a kiss just as the door to his office vibrated with the sound of an excited knock and they pulled apart rolling their eyes. "It's Travis," the pale man said by way of explanation.
"Is that what you were doing," asked Harry before leaning over and whispering to Draco: "It was a piss poor job then, wa'nnit?"
They're trying to decide which Muggle place to go to for lunch as they walk through the ministry on their way out. Prying eyes and ears had been following them all week and they thought a lunch out would be much more comfortable.
"You can think in the car," Harry insists, placing a chaste kiss on his husband's lips as if he just couldn't help it.
"You're telling people now, aren't you?" she said somewhat excited with a sort of proud gleam in her eyes and he shoved at her shoulder.
They had thought that after confirming their marriage, the scrutiny and spying and watching would be over, but now everyone was waiting for the big event. They were keeping a close eye on both men in case one of them slipped up about their super secret plans to renew their vows with a huge wedding. Truth be told, neither of them were even a part of the planning process and Luna, Hermione and Pansy were still in the color picking phase. That doesn't stop everyone from staring, though, especially after Harry's explosion in the hallway. Once they remember that, they make it to the lifts in record time.
"Well, this is just great. Everyone thinks my boyfriend's a girl," says Harry plopping onto one of the armchairs they found in one of the more deserted areas in the library
"I thought you and Ackers went for a date," Harry said after the initial shock was over. He walked behind his desk and sat down rolling his chair back a bit as he pulled open the bag, the crinkling almost deafening the responding silence.
. Draco pulls Harry in for a kiss and the ravenette leans into it easily. They pull apart for only a moment before continuing to pepper soft kisses on each other's lips, the world around them melting away until their plates are finally placed on the table. They eat together in companionable silence, peeking at each other with soft smiles on their faces.
"I panicked and told the whole school I was bringing some girl from the states. So he brought Pansy Parkinson."
The man in question moaned around the cock in his mouth as his actual dick began spurting all over the floor in front of him. Malfoy grunted behind him as he tightened around him from the pleasure of release, causing the blonde to cum inside of him.
"Bloody he- stop calling me sir." Harry took a deep breath to calm down. This kid had a way of pushing his buttons and he wasn't sure how to make it stop. "I just wanted to...er- apologize for my behavior at pub night, last week. And I thought I should extend an invitation for tomorrow. I know Hermione'll be upset if you weren't there. Other than her, you're the only other muggle born."
"I mean the papers and anyone at work who asks. Draco, I love you, you know that, but I've wanted to share
Harry let go of Draco's hand once they were standing side by side on one of the highest hills the furthest away from the Manor. They were both looking up at the stars. Draco pointed out his own constellation and when he looked over Harry had started peeling off his own tee shirt.
"What did you really bring me up here for, Potter?" The blonde asked not looking anywhere but the darker man's eyes, as always, blown wider, but slightly less green by his rounded frames.
Once the fact of the matter that Hermione had a secret date to the ball was out, Harry decided to ask Padma and Parvati if they'd want to accompany him and Ron. They agreed and he thought that would be it.
Draco started buttoning up his shirt in front of the mirror. His scars had long since stopped terrifying him and his nightmares were a lot more domestic now. He took a deep breath as he looked at himself and realized with a heavy sigh that it was obvious how much he looked past his prime. His hairline had been thinning and receding slowly. He had wrinkles at the corner of his eyes and he wondered when in the name of Merlin they had even gotten there. It had been years since Harry had saved the Wizarding world, but he was still handsome enough to capture any witch or wizards attention.
The music is soft as it flows from the rafters over the congregation of party goers. The charmed lights and silver snitches flicker and flutter in the air surrounding the tents, ready to glow at a moments notice once the sun begins to set later. Draco's robes are perfectly pressed and gleaming, even though both he and Harry have only opted for a soft cream color as opposed to the typical pearlescent white of weddings and funerals. He plucks a nonexistent piece of lint from his shoulder before continuing through the manor's gardens to find anyone else.
"Uh...Auror Potter," Travis said, because he still won't just call him Harry though he loved to say Draco's name as though it were so precious. Harry's anger almost inflated again. "You and Draco are close, aren't you?"
Another tear falls as she gets him to the altar. She pulls a handkerchief out of seemingly thin air and pats lovingly at his face before kissing both he and Harry on the cheek then taking her seat in the front row next to Pansy and Theo and Blaise and Greg and Millie and the rest of his friends who'd been there from the beginning. Ron and Hermione sat on the other side of the aisle where Harry's family and friends were. Even if they'd all become family and friends after more than 5 years together.
"I work for the Ministry so far as it takes to pay my checks. But this job? The politics? It comes second to my husband, always has. Always will." He grips his wand tighter and sends an
"Don't move. I will be back after work and I expect to fuck you again after you've stayed like this for a day. And I may think about letting you bathe. Maybe then you'll learn to not disobey me. Understood?"
to say is," he murmurs before he loses the nerve, "I'm ready now. The picture isn't too bad and I don't think anyone will be too surprised with how much time we spend together anyway. I'm not glad we didn't get to share the story ourselves, but I am glad it's finally out. I couldn't keep you to myself forever."
"Oh, I'm sure you have plenty of things you could share with me though, eh?" The guy, Travis, slid closer. He was one of the Junior Curse Breakers and he had taken to Draco almost immediately. He had cropped dark brown hair and wicked blue eyes and it wasn't long before he was joining their group for weekly pub nights, though Harry abhorred it. He was around so much Harry wasn't really sure why Draco hadn't already told him they were married. All their other friends knew. When Travis placed a hand on the blond's forearm with a sly smile, Harry looked down and remembered that Draco never wore his ring to work.
"Do you mind if we order something and eat in the office today?" Draco says tiredly, pinching the bridge of his nose. Harry stands up and walks over to him concerned, wrapping his arms around his husband's waist and pulling him closer.
He knows that he should probably turn Travis in, but he also knows the younger curse breaker well enough to know it was a mistake and he knows, probably better than anyone, how a mistake can ruin your life.
"You seem jealous, Auror Potter. If you like him so bloody much, why don't you just tell him that and let him choose who he would rather spend his time with."
"It's terrific," Draco started with a shrug, running a hand through Harry's hair, "but I haven't been too worried about it, if I'm honest. Not anymore. I'm good at my job, and she knows it. They all do."
Draco stepped forward and placed the tip of his wand on Harry's chest before releasing a stinging hex. He tried to twist away without any success as the wand tip was placed lower and lower until it rested on the top of his thigh. He shivered at the closeness of the hex next to his more...important bits.
"When we're— Oh bloody hell," Draco says once he notices the glowing blue sheen of Travis' eyes. Who knows what artifact he'd gotten in touch with down in the Curse Breakers den. Draco tosses all the vital reading spells he knows to try and understand what the fuck is going on. The best he can gather is an infatuation curse from a temple of cupid, but even then he can't break the curse without knowing
"I know, I know. I think I've just about heard it all," he said angrily, balling his fists up to keep himself from covering up again. "'
He slipped out of Harry and cast a cleansing charm on himself before tucking his softening prick back into his trousers and zipping them up.
The blonde smiled at him before removing the wand and placing it back into his sleeve holster. He was still fully dressed. He was always fully dressed when they did this. Harry supposed it was to make him feel worse, but it made him feel better knowing that even his torturer felt some things were too intimate to share with a sex slave.
"They did, then Travis had to go and tell everyone we were married." Draco's arms were crossed, but Harry looked away, back towards the road.
He shouldn't feel so close to tears seeing Harry look at him like that. He's done this before. They've been here before. But something about doing it in front of all their friends and family this time strikes a cord with him.
guy. The one that walked around asking about everyone's weekend plans just to see if they asked him, but he did it anyway. The only person who asked in reciprocation was Hermione who thought he and Draco wanted to have dinner with her and Ron when he came to her office while asking around.
that nickname," Draco says mildly, his arms crossed and his head on Harry's shoulder, even if it means he's drawing attention from people around the room who are starting to whisper. "I told her I'm seeing someone."
The music begins to start the ceremony and he watches as Harry rushes around towards the altar to stand and wait for him with nothing but love in his eyes.
"This is your decision. You know I'm not going to force you into doing anything that makes you uncomfortable...whether you want to or not." He stood and walked towards his boyfriend who took a step back in surprise before they were practically standing nose to nose.
There were coughs and groans heard around the table and even Blaise, who had moved over to throw an arm around Neville's shoulders, had to stiffle a laugh.
The glint in Harry's eyes made him shut his mouth on whatever else he could have thought to say. They had kissed, of course they had. Harry had given Draco a blowjob more times than he could count by this point, but he never let him reciprocate. He had asked, because
"Really!" Draco insisted. "She knew we were married. Or suspected it, at least. She said it's fine, though. I haven't lost my job quite yet."
"Well obviously," he said as Harry walked towards the door where Travis had knocked again, "they all have a talent for planning things."
He and Harry had talked about doing more, sure, but Harry usually averted his eyes and responded with something non-committal. He had told Draco before that he bottomed with most of his other male partners, and his female partners never made it all the way to having sex with him.  Draco nodded and asked if that's what he liked but Harry just stuttered out a neutral response before excusing himself to their shared bathroom. Draco never got the chance to tell him how much he longed to be pounded into. How he wanted to be bent over and forced to just
"It's what makes you such a bloody pain in my arse half the time," Harry said easily forgetting Travis was there when Draco looked so pleased with himself. "I wish I could hex that bloody smirk off your face, git."
"Not as much as I would if you said my name," The man behind him leaned forward and licked the sweat from the poor ravenette's neck while still running the end of the riding crop against the warm, sensitive skin.
"Yeah, of course!" the brunette said with forced enthusiasm. Draco could tell he was disappointed and he wondered if he and Harry had been as obvious about liking each other before their first shag, but he doubted it. Their relationship had started in secret with passionate yelling and rough sex and he was almost positive there were parts of them that still hated each other back then. There was no room for the soft smiles and giggling until they were forced on a mission together and had to talk things through. Things were easier after that.
Harry just smiles before leaning forward and pulling the floating chair Draco is sitting in closer. He kisses him soundly, his beard rubbing at the soft skin on Draco's face. When he pulls away his face is indeed red in patches, he can't be sure how much of it is blush and how much comes from him, but he thinks it's gorgeous. He cards a hand through the blond hair as they both try to catch their breath.
"Draco!" gasped the ravenette stunned and the blonde merely raised his eyes to meet his before opening his mouth and wrapping his lips around the tip. Harry's breath was more of a wheeze that time.
"Y-yes sir, Mr. Potter...uh Auror Potter, sir. Crystal clear. Clearer than crystal. Extremely clear. The clearest."
"And when we got married and I didn't want anyone to know...it was never about the fact that I didn't love you, I just wasn't ready to share
"Is this because father's dead?" Draco asked very carefully with his arms crossed, staring at his husband from across his desk.
. The press haven't bothered us in years! They get one shot of us out together and piece together that we're married now everyone and their crup want to know whether or not our wedding will take place at the manor. We don't even live in the manor. No one does!"
look like?" Harry said confused. He glanced around before meeting Malfoy's eye and smiling small to himself.
Harry grabs his hands as Kingsley clears his throat and begins talking to the crowd. Draco and Harry only have eyes for each other.
"Should I start with the fact that I invited you to the ball and you said no so that you could come with Prostitute Parkinson?"
were the one who didn't want people to know about us and now they don't even suspect it and you're angry?"
“My Lord,” Lucius said as he stopped pacing directly in front of Tom’s desk, eyes blazing with something Tom could only assume was self-righteous fury, “he is arrogant and rude. Must you allow his disrespect for authority to continue?”
Some discussion of Hadrian's life, some flustered Severus, some flustered Draco and some seriously amused Dark Lords.
“That’s what they were for?” Severus asked, having made an abundance of those potions for his Lord for years, even when the Dark Lord had no visible reason for them.
“He’s getting more and more violent with me each summer I come back from Hogwarts and I keep asking Dumbledore to be moved somewhere else, but the blood wards are too damn important aren’t they Headmaster? It doesn’t matter that the most danger I have ever been in while living with the muggles has been from bleeding out in the cupboard under the stairs. I’ve had more broken bones than I have bones in my body, more scars than skin on my back and still no one seemed to notice that they didn’t just ‘hate me’ as I told anyone who asked. They despised me, and magic, and made it their life’s mission to beat and bleed the magic out of me.”
Hadrian led the two to the formal sitting room and situated Draco on the plush armchair closest to the welcoming hearth. He couldn’t help being a little disappointed he and Hadrian were not currently occupying the loveseat, but understood this was probably not the time for pining the loss of the vampire Lord’s warm thigh against his own. Hadrian had important business to do after all.
“You!” Lucius spluttered out and Severus could see Draco’s face getting increasingly more mortified. His father was about to make a fool of himself. “How did you do this?” he gestured wildly around the room, “Do you really expect me to believe you have been deceiving us all this time?”
The smirk that graced his father’s face was positively feral and Hadrian couldn’t help but return it. It grew in strength as he noticed Albus Dumbledore rushing through the Hall in the direction of the lifts, no doubt to warn his pets about the incoming demise of the Dursley Family.
I for one was appalled to hear our great Albus Dumbledore has held a prominent position in our governing body unlawfully for all this time, and asked whether that was the reason the Potter and Black seat alignment has changed parties.
The wolves come out to play for a little bit next chapter. I'm really looking forward to it so I hope you are too.
Tom snorted and raised his refilled glass in Hadrian’s direction. “You did well my dear, keeping him occupied while we began our overthrow of his Light world.” Barty could heart the contempt in Tom’s voice as he talked about the Light side and agreed with it. Dumbledore needed to be taken down and that was exactly what his Lord was trying to do.
Padfoot stood watching as the team of healers levitated a small body out from the charred house on a stretcher and had to close his eyes. He couldn’t believe it. There was no way he could believe that Harry was dead. Taken from him before they even had the chance to be a proper family.
Ronald’s face was redder than his hair, and Sirius was beginning to think this alone would make up for the two days of intense worry his son had put him through. If this reading went the way he thought it was going to, Hadrian was well on his way to being forgiven.
“Your glamour?” Severus asked his face mirroring the inquisitive ones of both Malfoys sitting beside him.
Bowing low, the demon twins thanked their Lord sincerely and rounded on the wounded little bird, grabbing an arm each and dragging him out the door. Luna smirked darkly as she thought of all the wonderful products the twins were currently working on down in their lab, and the truly terrible things they could do to poor Avery.
“Tom sent Barty to watch over me when he heard what was going on that year and we got to talking. He taught me a lot that year and I taught him a few things myself. Barty’s the main reason I survived the stupid competition and, because of that, he became my first marked follower.”
Severus looked overwhelmed and like he was completely unable to comprehend any more new information today.
killed you stupid, irrational Gryffindor!” he ranted as he stalked towards the boy he’d sworn to protect with his life and magic. The rash, impulsive brat that, despite all Albus - fucking - Dumbledore’s manipulations, he’d come to respect.
I have no idea how long this fic is going to take. I have it all planned out but my writing gets away from me sometimes and ends up thousands of words longer than I originally thought. We'll see what happens *shrugs*
He had just received his first mission from Lord Thanatos, who held his loyalty equally with Lord Voldemort, and he was confused. Severus hated being confused, so the whole ordeal was already affecting him, but these orders were the strangest he’d ever received.
Now, I have a rough draft of this fic up until, about half way through March 1998 and then we'll see how it goes from there. There are a lot of Prophet articles coming up and they're all dated so I decided to make it easier on us all and date/location stamp the chapters so when the articles come in you know exactly when they are in relation to the rest of the chapter. I've just gone back through the last 11 chapters and edited them so there won't be inconsistencies for new readers. All you need to know is that Hadrian and Draco met at Gringotts on the 19th June and it's now only the 21st.
“The vicious harpy who calls herself our mother was on our case about the shop again,” the other twin said and Draco was momentarily shocked by that statement. Were all the Weasley’s not on the same side. Draco just assumed that where Harry Potter lead, a flock of redheaded blood-traitors followed. He must have been wrong.
So sorry this is a day late! Easter caught up with me and I barely made it out alive... All that chocolate.
“Do you know who they are, my Lord,” Draco asked, and Lucius had to suppress the urge to whack his son upside the head. You didn’t just ask the Dark Lord questions like that, no matter how good a mood he seemed to be in.
Lucius moved to sit in the chair next to Tom when Hadrian shook his head. “No need to get comfortable Lucius,” Hadrian rose and stalked across the room. “I’m sure Draco’s told you but I’ll reiterate; these two gentlemen here,” he gestured to the two, still slightly shaken Weasleys, “are in need of an upstanding pureblood family to learn from for the next month. I’ve volunteered the Malfoy’s for the job.”
“At the end of the month,” Hadrian continued, “you will come to me and outline your experience, how you felt about it and we’ll go from there.” Incredulity was present on the Weasley’s faces as Hadrian paused. They clearly thought this whole plan was crazy, but Draco could see the appeal. Letting the eldest Weasley boys see how they
“I’m Hadrian Peverell,” he said, and Dumbledore leaned forward slightly at the mention of his last name. Hadrian had had enough last names to choose from, Sirius wondered why he had chosen one that interested Dumbledore so much. “I’m here for the same reason everyone else is, because I got a letter stating I was mentioned in Harry Potter’s will. The Goblins would not have allowed me in this room if I were not invited.”
Charlie looked up from the egg and stared disbelievingly at Ragnok. “Is this what I think it is?” he asked, his voice shaking just a little.
“It must have been a painful few days,” the second twin said. A look of pain flashing through his eyes. Draco thought these two must really care about their Lord.
“I have a fair idea about those he will invite,” the Dark Lord said, surprising Lucius with the ease of his response to the too-casual question from his son. “You will just have to find out tomorrow when we meet them, it is Hadrian’s secret to tell, though I imagine you will both be surprised.”
“Neville Frank Longbottom,” Harry began again, “there’s not a lot I can give you but thanks for being the best friend I could ask for. I have named you, heir Longbottom, a Friend of the House Potter so if you ever need assistance, refuge or help of any kind, the House of Potter will always be there for you. I have also asked the new Lord Potter to grant you access to Euphema Potter’s greenhouses at Potter Manor. She has some seriously interesting things in there that I think you would love. Thanks again Nev, you really are the best Gryffindor there could ever be.”
“I have the blood of a Most Noble and three Most Ancient and Noble Houses running through my veins and I am the Lord of all four of them. You speak to me as if I am below you, but one word from me and your family name becomes synonymous with
At Harry Potter’s will reading just yesterday morning, it was found that his titles have been passed on to none other than Britain’s latest curiosity, Lord Hadrian Peverell. In a short interview with Lord Peverell as he left the  Wizengamot, I found that Harry Potter’s two seats; the Black and Potter Lordships, had been used by Albus Dumbledore since the late Lord and Lady Potter’s death, under the proxy agreement of 1765.
Dumbledore paid the owl, opened up the paper and Sirius’ dread increased as he watched the Headmaster’s face pale. The paper dropped with a soft thunk onto the table and Sirius realised the room had gone completely silent. No one dared to speak and find out what had affected the Headmaster so until Bill Weasley, Sirius blessed his soul, picked up the paper and cleared his throat. His voice tight, face pale and hands shaking as he read the article emblazoned on the front page.
I know now this all looks extremely suspicious and I can’t help wonder whether tonight’s fire had something to do with my article this morning. Someone out there didn’t want Harry Potter spilling his secrets and took matters into their own hands. Trust me when I say this dear readers, Mr Potter’s life was being controlled by someone and I won’t stop until I can give you the truth. Until then, join me in taking a moment to remember all that Harry James Potter has done for Wizarding Britain and praying that justice will come for this boy who was taken from us too young.
A minuscule smile crawled its way onto Sirius’ face. He had hoped but now he had confirmation; his son really was fine and oh Merlin was he going to get an ass kicking for making Sirius worry so much. He understood of course, Sirius’ reaction had to be genuine or the Order and old Dumbles would have been suspicious but a little more warning would have been nice. Stupid kid with his insanely smart but incredibly reckless plans. Sirius didn’t know where he got it from.
“Are you completely sure, little moon. You know I would never force you into this. You will have to live for a
Luna’s tinkling laugh echoed through the ballroom. Her Lord, who was setting up a dais at the far end of the room, looked over at the noise.
Hadrian laughed, of course that was what Tom knew, he was so completely obsessed with immortality. “Exactly, we have heartbeats, eat normal food and are, for all intents and purposes, alive. We also have a destined mate and donor and, as soon as we find them, we need the blood of our donor or mate to survive. Preferably both but it’s not necessary, in case you find one years before the other or something like that.” He paused to make sure Tom was following before continuing. “I’m going to age until my mid-twenties then stop for an indefinite amount of time, extending the life of my mate and donor with me. According to the Goblin’s records, the lifespan of a Living Vampire is directly linked to how much magic the Vampire has but even the weakest Living Vampire can live for thousands of years.”
“WHAT?” Hadrian was slightly surprised the enraged shout that rang through the room came from the Malfoy Lord. Lucius’ perfect pureblood demeanour was completely cast aside as he stood, silver eyes shining with righteous fury. Hadrian felt for sure Severus would be the first to start yelling, but the dark Potions Master was just staring at Hadrian, frozen in shock.
Lucius smirked, “I have a feeling you’re not going to be the one resisting, son. He sure didn’t mind looking at you tonight.”
“Oh, Severus. So sweet that you care,” the raven haired menace drawled, placing a hand over his heart dramatically. “But, I am perfectly safe here. In fact, right here, in this room with you five, is probably the safest I’ve ever been.”
“You have your pick of an estate from either the Potters or the Blacks, though I recommend the Black Cottage in Italy, it’s sunny there with lots of open space, you would like it. As Lord Black I officially welcome you back into the Black family and therefore reinstate your Allowance Vault. If I could, I would have named you my heir but you know that’s not possible. You also might find that Amelia Bones comes into contact with you shortly, I’ve given her a rat to think about.”
Narcissa is impressed by the Weasley boys, Umbridge starts feeling chills and the Wolves have a meeting.
Severus watched as his friend’s face got considerably paler as Lord Peverell continued to talk. He re-organised his mental schedule to make sure he spoke to Narcissa as soon as possible. He didn’t think Peverell would ruin Draco but he had to make sure Lucius knew his place.
The room was completely still, holding their breath at the sight of the clearly irate vampire, no doubt wondering what the second oldest Weasley had done to incur his wrath. Remus had moved every so slightly in front of Sirius in an attempt to protect his intended mate. Hadrian was pleased. They should be fucking scared right now. He was pissed.
Okay, this week is for something a little different. I haven't completely figured out how I want my Luna to be at the moment so I used this chapter to study her a little more. Let me know what you think of her and how you think she and Draco should interact as time goes on.
Harry rose, offering his hand before the two Marauders could be fully seated. “Hadrian Peverell, it’s a pleasure to meet you, despite the circumstances of course,” he said with a wink in Remus’ direction. Sirius shook the offered hand, relishing in the flare of warmth from the mark on his left shoulder and seated himself at the table.
He looked conflicted for a moment before striding forward on those long legs of his and elegantly lowering himself into the wrought iron chair opposite hers. “How are you this morning, Draco?” she asked in an attempt to break the ice. There were a great many things Luna could say to the blonde now, but she knew her Lord had plans and, as much as she knew Hadrian was going about this the long way, Luna would not get in his way.
“Ginevra Molly Weasley, I leave you this: I never would have married you. Even if you weren’t a gold digging whore, I’m so
of the magical hierarchy, Lucius. So much more than the diluted Veela blood you try to hide from the world while you preach blood purity like you aren’t a hypocritical idiot who doesn’t know when to shut his mouth.” Peverell was in Lucius’ face now. Fangs bared, eyes glowing and magic choking the air from the room. Lucius was fucked if he didn’t stand down and Severus hoped he knew that.
“Do you think we will survive those two?” Lucius asked as the delighted, slightly unhinged laughter of Lord Thanatos rang out through the house. The smell of burning polyester reached the two, who applied disillusionment charms in preparation for their departure.
The two Black women looked contented as they felt the Family magic return to them. Draco could relate and absently wondered whether Hadrian could get Andromeda to talk to his Mother. He knew she missed her eldest sister greatly, especially since Aunt Bella was still halled up in Azkaban. Perhaps the traditional meeting of the Black Family when the new Lord was officially appointed would serve as an opportunity to reacquaint the estranged sisters.
Draco was standing next to his Father behind the seated form of the Dark Lord, watching the fireplace with growing anticipation. Hadrian Peverell was talking quietly with Barty, a man who was apparently allowed to leave the Dark Lord’s service and go into that of Lord Thanatos, on a couch to the left of the fireplace. Severus, ever the dour, antisocial type, was leaning against the wall to the right of the room. Looking out at its occupants with a blank mask. Only years of observing the man let Draco see that Severus was just as anxious about this meeting as him.
Hope all the explanations aren't boring you too much! Hang in there, there's mate and donor talk coming up soon!
Harry ended it there and Draco could feel Hadrian’s shoulders shaking with mirth. The affronted look on Molly Weasley’s face was something Draco would savour for years to come. His Mother would undoubtedly love to see the memory. She loathed the Weasley matriarch.
“You need to drink, my Lord,” she said again and tilted her head to the side. Baring that perfect neck to him without fear or apprehension. Trusting him completely. Hadrian’s head swam with pure need.
“Hello, Draco,” Luna said, as she poured a second cup of tea. It was early still, the sun illuminating the room with a soft glow and bouncing off the silver blonde locks of the girl seated comfortably at the garden table in the room’s centre.
Hesitant nods were once again directed at him and Hadrian snickered at the look of pure glee written on Barty’s face over by the fire.
“They threw the heir to a Most Ancient and Noble House into Azkaban without a trial?” Draco suddenly asked. An incredulous look on his face, as if he couldn’t believe a Noble pure-blood could possibly be treated that badly.
Sirius looked over the array of seats behind Madame Bones at the Lords and Ladies of the Wizengamot. None looked particularly thrilled to be there and Sirius supposed he could understand. There was not a lot of charm to be found in these dank court rooms so deep beneath Muggle London. Lucius was seated directly to the left of Madame Bones, his rightful place as the new Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and gave Sirius a nearly undetectable nod. It meant he was confident they had the Lords and Ladies of this court on their side and all would end well after this farce of a trial. Despite himself, and the unquestioned fact that Lucius Malfoy was a stupid git, Sirius was reassured.
“Are all those things people talk about true?” Draco asked. “Like did you really stab a Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor?” Severus was admittedly quite excited to find out what the Golden Boy had actually got up to during his years at Hogwarts. People worshiped the ground he walked on and, despite the proof sitting in front of him that Hadrian Peverell was nothing short of brilliant genetically, Severus wanted to know what more Dumbledore had been hiding from him concerning the boy.
As they made their way to their seats at the left of the table, Remus stiffened beside him. Sirius jumped slightly when the werewolf grabbed his elbow and hissed his name. He turned to Remus with a questioning gaze and the man inclined his head in the direction of the stranger. “That man smells -,” he hesitated and Sirius saw something akin to hope shining in his best friends eyes, “Sirius, he smells like
“There’s something else I wanted to give you,” Harry said, startling Draco out of his thoughts. “I, Lord Potter, do hereby recognise all life-debts to the Potter family owed by Severus Snape fulfilled,” a golden light flashed through Severus and Draco watched as his godfather’s shoulders relaxed. Releasing a tension he had obviously been holding for sixteen years. Draco was
Percy had more awe on his face than Draco had thought possible. He remembered the academic Weasley from his first years at Hogwarts and hadn’t thought the Prefect knew how to look up to another person. Percy always seemed more pompous and arrogant than Draco himself, and Draco had to admit that
“You, of course, have the opportunity now to decline Harry’s offer and go on your merry way,” Hadrian said, with a hint of a smirk across his lips. “But know that as soon as you accept, you will be required to carry out the full month before you can return to your normal lives.” Hadrian flicked his wand slightly and a pile of parchment appeared in front of him. He shuffled through the stack, found what he was looking for and passed it over to William. “This is Harry’s instructions to me in case you were doubting my credibility. You can check its authenticity if you want.”
Hermione’s face was red with embarrassment or anger, Draco couldn’t tell, but he was loving every minute of this. Severus was next to him, trying admirably to suppress a snort, but ultimately failing in the face of Albus Dumbledore’s completely baffled expression. He wondered just how long the potions Master had waited for someone to take the know-it-all down a peg or two.
Hadrian sat back in his seat, positively smug at this new information. “I must thank you Lady Malfoy, it seems this all just got a lot easier.”
“My Lord, we came as quickly as we could,” one of the twins said, Draco wasn’t sure how to tell them apart. Or if there even was a way.
so he could shut down Skeeter easily. He could fight this war in the name of Harry Potter and gain all the recognition in the process. Albus sat back in his chair and popped a lemon drop into his mouth. Everything was going to work out fine.
again for a very long time. “You, my dear Lucius, have to understand that, while my Hadrian may be young, he ranks above you in every aspect of society and he will not stop until you have learnt your place.”
“Severus, the Goblins did that already,” he said quietly and looked deep into the eyes of the frantic Potions Master. “I’m perfectly fine now, clean bill of heath with the Goblin seal of approval.”
“Yes, my Lord - ah, I mean - yes, Hadrian?” It was clear Draco still was not completely comfortable in his new Lord’s presence. Hadrian would have to rectify that mistake as soon as possible. His mate would have to be sure of his position in Hadrian’s life: above all else and completely superior.
He confirmed as such to his Lords and, with a nod of his head, went to wait with Lucius at the door.
“I understand your concern Lucius, but it is unfounded. Hadrian is completely on our side and has been since he was eleven. He is the reason I stand before you today, more than a bodiless wraith and with my complete mental faculties once again,” the Dark Lord said.
Charlie opened the paper at his first morning in Malfoy Manor and gasped. He knew he should have expected this, it should have been obvious as soon as Lucius Malfoy was so blatantly ordered to house him and his brother by the Lord Peverell, but for some reason it shocked him.
“That year ended as all others have, with a showdown between that year’s ‘great threat’ and my ‘friends’. The Weasel, Granger and I ended up following Pettigrew and my godfather to the Shrieking Shack where my information from Tom was confirmed and Pettigrew was revealed to the rest of the Golden Trio. We were interrupted by Lupin and Severus and it all went to shit from there.”
Gasps came from the Weasleys and Granger and Draco had to wonder whether they paid the slightest bit of attention to Harry Potter while he was alive. Everyone knew how much the Hedwig meant to Harry. She was his familiar and Harry would have done anything to make sure she was safe. Draco had seen how reluctant the snowy owl was to interact with Harry’s supposed best friends and even he could have guessed Lovegood would make the best choice.
“What is there opinion of Dark Magic?” he asked and the Lady Malfoy’s eyes lit up in a most unexpected way.
He grabbed Remus’ hand under the table, needing the strength of his best friend to keep himself upright. Remind himself that he didn’t know what had happened yet. His son could be fine.
I'm so sorry I took so long with this chapter! I was sick for a while and time just got away from me. This chapter's a bit longer than usual though, so I hope that makes up for it :)
Draco, Lucius and Severus were sitting on a couch off to the side, watching intently and likely wondering why they were included within this discussion. Hadrian’s Wolves were scattered around the room, eyeing Skeeter intently, constantly on watch while their Lord was in the presence of a potential enemy. Tom stood just behind Hadrian, his hand on his shoulder and a powerful glamour changing his features ever so slightly to be closer to Hadrian’s. Not that it was particularly difficult to begin with, they were already very similar.
Hello all you lovely people. I had a bit of writers block for a moment there but I am finally back with something for you! I hope you're all doing okay in this isolation and urge you all to keep safe :)
“Arthur Weasley,” Harry said with a sad smile and the Weasley patriarch looked up at the image before him. Draco once again wondered whether the grief displayed on his face was genuine. He hadn’t noticed before, too distracted by the myriad of more interesting people filling the room, but Arthur Weasley looked significantly more distraught than his wife. As Hadrian once again squeezed his hand, a rush of warmth flowing through the young Malfoy, Draco thought there might genuinely be a strong relationship between Harry and the eldest Weasley.
“We think we’ve found a solution, my Lord.” Fred said. They were cloaked and hooded but the inner circle had been able to tell them apart by voice long ago. Her Lord could undoubtedly tell them apart by sight alone, but he was on a different level.
“Lord Peverell is correct,” Ragnok spoke up, “the late Lord Potter-Black has requested that you all remain attentive for the final aspect of his Will.” The vicious grin the Goblin sported spoke only of pain for the occupants of the room. Well, at least for those opposing Harry Potter.
“Harry has asked that you spend a month as the guests of a traditional pureblood family in order to accurately understand both sides of the current political climate. You will of course be allowed to work as long as you spend at least a total of twenty nights within the chosen family’s company and actively seek to learn about their lifestyle, political views and general understanding of magic.”
This is a very Black chapter and there will be a few others coming that are along the same lines. You'll find I have a massive weak spot for the family and I just can't help making them all exactly how I want them to be. There are just so many options after all.
“I see,” Tom said. “We shall be talking about this at a later date Severus. It is a good thing Hadrian is to be protected with your life no matter what side your on now, isn’t it?”
There was a look of understanding immediately within Draco’s eyes and Hadrian could not have been prouder of his mate. He was just so damn smart Hadrian could swoon. He wouldn’t though. At least not in the presence of others. “Of course, Hadrian,” Draco replied, making his way to the door after a deep bow in Hadrian’s direction. “I will make sure he behaves.”
Lupin gasped as the magic of the marking ritual settled over him and his mark formed. He lifted the hem of his right pant leg to expose his newly decorated calf. Running from knee to ankle on the back of Lupin’s leg was the mark of Lord Thanatos, surrounded by tender pink skin, the wolf howled up at Death’s moon and Lupin could not have looked prouder. He turned to Black and beamed at him before they both stood and bowed low to their Lord.
He strolled down the hall towards Peverell and the Dark Lord, Lucius remaining by the front door to ‘guard’ the premises. Secretly, Severus mused Peverell only brought Lucius along to prove to the man who was in charge. It was amusing to think and Severus found himself glad this new Dark Lord was less inclined to torture people to prove his superiority, if only for the sanity of his friend.
which was surely waiting for anyone else that tried it. There must have been some compelling evidence that convinced the Dark Lord to ally himself with his destined vanquisher, and Severus was sure no one else would ever know what it was.
Severus was, however, dedicated to the Dark and the Dark Lord’s goals. And if his Lord believed that Hadrian Peverell would be instrumental in achieving those goals, Severus would do as he was told. It was what he was best at, after all.
“I think you do, my Lord.” Her tinkling laugh made his breath catch and he stopped, inches away from her, and stared. She was his donor. His to cherish, protect and love for all eternity. There would be nothing sexual about their intimacy, but there never had been with Luna. Hadrian had to wonder how he had not guessed this outcome already. Because of course she was his donor, she was the only person currently alive who had the ability to keep him sane. Keep him level headed, safe from himself and stop him from being a danger to others.
Tom could understand the appeal, of course. Riling Lucius up has been a favourite pass-time of Tom’s since he marked the boy straight out of Hogwarts. Lucius’ haughty Malfoy exterior hid the most Gryffindor emotional tendencies that would leap out at the first sign of an insult to his name, and Tom had no idea where he got it from. Abraxas Malfoy was the most Slytherin of Tom’s original Knights and he assumed the late Lord brought his son up in his image.
“I leave to you a trunk full of your old stuff I found and there’s also a trunk of stuff that was Mum and Dad’s. There was a letter left to you in their Wills, which I finally had read, which I am now passing it onto you. You have my permission, as Lord Black, to browse all the Black Vaults and take whatever it is you want. I wasn’t sure how much, if any, of your family’s stuff you would appreciate.” The nervous look on Harry’s face made Draco’s heart break. Surely Hadrian had to know they would all love anything he could give them.
of London Gringotts as the executor of his will) was a tall, strongly built young man Sirius had never seen before. He was naturally tanned, had dark raven black hair down to his shoulders in a style fairly reminiscent of the Black Family, pulled back at the base of his neck in the traditional pureblood fashion. There was something strikingly familiar about the man but Sirius couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
Severus eyed the young vampire as he moved closer to the damned cupboard. That the brat was going to be in his House this school year was already giving him a headache. He was too powerful to comprehend, one forgot he wasn’t even seventeen yet.
“I, Harry James Potter-Black, of sound mind, magic and body do hereby declare this as my last will and testament. All previous wills should be overridden and this will sealed only by the word of the new Lord Potter-Black.” Harry’s voice rang out through the room as everyone listened intently to the young man.
“There’s a letter here from Mum and Dad for you as well. You have my permission to take whatever you want from the Potter or Black Libraries, and Potter Cottage, just outside Hogsmeade, is yours. I hope that you,” Harry paused with a teasing smirk, “
“Nonsense, Draco,” Luna replied, leaving out more of her airy tone than usual. She knew Draco was uncomfortable in her presence at the moment and didn’t want to scare him away. They would have to be able to get along after all. Their Lord would not be getting rid of either of them for a
The blonde opened his mouth, no doubt to stammer some weak retort about his worth in the eyes of his son, but Tom lifted a hand to silence him, nothing but finality in his tone. “He is far more capable of looking after young Draco than you will ever be Lucius, so cease with this useless pacing and figure out a way to get on my Hadrian’s good side so I no longer have to field your petty arguments and Draco no longer feels caught between the two of you. Because, dear Lucius, I can assure you that if he has to choose between his father and the powerful Vampire Lord who has taken his fancy, your Draco would
“You need to drink, my Lord,” Luna said as Hadrian warded the doors to his room. He was not being disturbed right now, not for anything. “You have been resisting your mate for too long already.”
Hadrian drew another memory from his temple and a painfully boring looking muggle street appeared at the end of his wand. Hagrid, Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall stood outside number four Privet Drive oblivious to the fact that baby Harry was wide awake.
Hadrian’s eyes went wide as Tom spoke, remembering something he’d missed from his discussion with the Goblins. “Oh, I can’t believe I forgot!” he exclaimed. Tom cocked an eyebrow in question, motioning for Hadrian to go on. “He’s been using my seats in the Wizengamot! Granted it’s only the Potter ones, but if I align those and the others I gained claiming my Lordships today with the Dark, Lucius could be Chief Warlock by tomorrow night.”
In all honesty, he hadn’t been paying too much attention when Hadrian and the Dark Lord were talking to the Skeeter woman. He was too busy reeling over the ease at which Hadrian Peverell took control of a room. His mere presence drew they eye and Draco was sure Skeeter had completely forgotten there were other people present as soon as the young Lord started speaking. Draco was out of the loop but, as a large, black Eagle Owl swooped through the open window and dropped a copy of the
“We decided to take everyone up to the castle to sort everything out legally and then the full moon came out. Lupin is a werewolf, you see, and after nearly thirty years of taking the wolfsbane potion every full moon, without fail, he ‘forgot’ that night.” Severus’ eyebrows rose, he hadn’t thought of that. He’d always been too busy disliking the wolf on principle.
“Luna Pandora Lovegood,” Harry said and the whole room recognised the extremely fond look in Harry’s eyes. From the shocked looks on the opposite side of the table, Draco concluded very few people realised how close Harry was to the Lovegood girl. “I really do love you Luna, you wonderful human, and I have also established you as a Friend of the House Potter. There is something immensely important that I need you to do for me and I know you are the only person who ever could. I need you to look after Hedwig for me, she loves you almost as much as I do so you should get along fine.”
I’ve enclosed a letter with the names of all four Marauders so you can look them up yourselves. You’ll be surprised, I think, at what you find out.”
powerful man and Dumbledore’s life just that little bit harder. Too bad the man didn’t know just how far Hadrian was willing to go to make Dumbledore’s life harder.
with him. How he managed to ruin so many of Albus’ plans from beyond the grave was quite frankly astounding. He was beginning to think Harry had been a great deal smarter than anyone had given him credit for. He had certainly managed to get Rita Skeeter on his side, something Albus had never been able to achieve, even at the height of his power.
Peverell looked a little exasperated, and Severus really couldn’t blame him. If he had gone through half of the ‘challenges’ Albus Dumbledore had put the boy through, he’d be a little exasperated too. Perhaps more so, but he doubted he was seeing all of Peverell’s emotions right now.
“We will of course be accepting the offer,” William started when he was sure of Harry’s instructions credibility. “What family will we be required to stay with?”
“How does no one know about this?” Skeeter asked, her eyes so wide Hadrian could see how her animagus form was a beetle.
“Perhaps, Hadrian, we should explain a little more before poor Lucius here loses his head?” the Dark Lord said, unsuccessfully hiding his smirk behind his whiskey glass once again. Lucius shrunk further back into the couch as he remembered the Dark Lord was present in the room for his outburst. Severus wanted to pity his friend, but couldn’t deny that Lucius got himself into these situations all on his own.
Across the room, his beautiful blonde mate looked at the pair with unmasked jealousy written across his face. Hadrian knew he wouldn’t have to wait long before either he or Draco snapped.
hoped it wasn’t just for that. As he made his way to the left of the large table set up for the benefactors of his son’s will, Sirius clutched Harry’s note tight within his trembling hands.
Someone cleared their throat next to Draco and he turned to face the Weasley twins. Draco had never spoken to the twins in his time at Hogwarts and looking at them eating at with his family was unnerving. The Malfoys and Weasleys had been at odds with each other for decades and he never would have thought this day would come.
It was all Hadrian could do to soften his eyes and keep his voice steady as turned to the Malfoy heir intent on getting him out of the redhead’s line of sight. “Draco, darling?” Hadrian asked, revelling in the slight blush that adorned Draco’s cheeks at the term of endearment.
“Thank you so much for this honour, my Lord,” Lupin said, shaking slightly with what Tom assumed was residual magic running through his body. He wondered how it felt, exactly, to submit to someone so freely, to be so controlled by one person that your very magic is linked to theirs. He didn’t think he wanted to find out, no matter how good some people seemed to think it felt. He was used to being in charge and he didn’t think he would give that up for anyone.
Harry’s words scrawled messily before him and Sirius could do nothing but stare. His son was fine, had said so himself. Whatever Harry’s plans were required him to be dead. But he was fine. He had to be. Sirius couldn’t cope if he wasn’t.
“Of course he will, my Lord.” She gasped as his long fangs pierced her skin. Blood, hot and sweet rushed into Hadrian’s mouth as he sucked  at his donor’s pulse. He pulled away after a few mouthfuls, delirious look on his face as he licked the wound closed, pulled down his wards and leaned back in his chair.
“A young Death Eater,” Hadrian looked pointedly at Severus, “heard the first half of the prophecy and reported it to his Master immediately.”
“That’s our Lord though, never complains,” the first twin said again. Looking away from Draco to the two sitting across the table with a fond smile. Draco looked back to see Lovegood leaning back into Hadrian as the Vampire’s arm tightened around her. Jealousy crashed through Draco yet again, making his heart hurt at the thought that he might never be able to be in that position. It never occurred to Draco that he was having such strong reactions to Hadrian because, that is exactly where he was always meant to be.
“Good, I believe she will be excited, perhaps even uncover more than we were able to. Hopefully we can get him out of Chief Warlock position before the Hogwarts term starts.”
Tom was very interested in Hadrian’s marking process. He knew there was no pain, unlike his own, and the Magic determined the positioning of the Mark, rather than the caster’s own intentions. But he knew very little else and was almost excited to witness the act in person.
Draco succumbed to a sudden need to comfort the vampire beside him and grabbed Hadrian’s hand under the table. Interlocking their fingers and giving the man something to ground himself with. Even though he doubted he was Hadrian’s mate, he hoped he could give the Vampire even the smallest amount of comfort.
I didn't set out to have Lucius be an idiot but it just kind of happened. I ended up having to split this chapter in two because our little blonde dumbass kept talking when he wasn't supposed to. Hope you enjoyed a little bit of angry Hadrian as well. He needed to show a different emotion, I thought.
Dumbledore’s face was deathly pale and Draco didn’t think he had seen anything so satisfying in his entire life. He was
“I’m still mad at him for that thoughtless mistake,” Tom said, his face expressing a little of the deep hatred Barty knew he felt for the rat animagus. “If you didn’t have plans for him Hades, I would have killed him years ago.”
His eyes roamed over the new Lord and Peverell's flash of a smile at the stumbling form of Severus' godson next to him made Severus notice two things; this man was a Vampire, and he looked a whole lot like an arrogant
Albus Dumbledore had been in indisputable control of magical Britain for as long as Charlie could remember but things were obviously  changing. Lord Peverell, whether he was working on Harry’s orders or not, would shake the foundations of Magical Britain in a way even You-Know-Who never managed. He had the Daily Prophet on his side and an openly low opinion of Dumbledore. He could influence a great many people, pureblood, halfblood and muggleborn. Charlie dearly hoped the young Lord would change things for the better.
“Are you okay working with him, considering the past between the two of you? Do you think you can look past all that adversary?” Draco was surprised his Father was asking. He thought he was being obvious, especially in his own home, about the way he felt about Harry Potter. Well, Hadrian Peverell now.
This chapter is fairly uneventful in terms of furthering the plot but it's full of Drarry and Luna and my best bud Sev so I really hope you enjoy it!
Hadrian watched as Dumbledore slumped back into his chair, no doubt having realised that Lord Hadrian Peverell was the only person in the room Harry hadn’t bequeathed anything too yet. He was so
Harry Potter is going to die, and be replaced with something better, something he really should have been all along. It would have saved him some extremely unnecessary betrayal.”
Said Dark Lord sat chuckling at the looks of horror on his followers faces. Lucius was horrified that someone could talk so openly about the Dark Lord while the man sat right next to him. He could not comprehend ever feeling comfortable enough around the immensely powerful man to
“I merely suggested, Ms Lovegood, that his Lordship might as well have Weasleys for followers for all the good they do for the cause.” Avery’s voice was barely above a whisper and Luna could see he was shaking like a leaf.
Tom offered up no explanations when five imploring looks were suddenly directed at him. A few moments of the deceptively innocent look plastered on the Dark Lord’s face caused Hadrian to continue after muttering about stupid secretive dark lords under his breath.
not interested. So all the love potions you were trying to slip me wouldn’t have worked anyway, sorry.” Harry shrugged and Draco wondered why Hadrian chose that moment to squeeze his hand again.
having Hadrian around. He was always so entertaining… and in the most creative ways! Tom never would have thought to punish Lucius by making him play host to
“Harry is perfectly fine,” Dumbledore said in an attempt to quickly placate the room full of concerned Saviour fans. How this room of overage and fairly competent wizards were okay with letting a nearly seventeen year old save the world on his own was astounding to Sirius. These people had all fought in the war before baby Harry had first defeated the Dark Lord and now they expected a child to fight their battles for them. For the whole world really. If he didn’t know Harry like he did, as a confident and extremely fucking brilliant wizard who could probably wipe the floor with anyone in this room (besides maybe Dumbledore and Snape), Sirius would have been concerned about the mental state of his son after having this much pressure heaped onto him.
Hadrian was deeply enjoying the looks of astonishment on all three men’s faces. Especially Draco. He felt a deep seated sense of self satisfaction at breaking through the young blonde’s infallible mask. Breathing in deeply through his nose, Hadrian once again caught the scent of the Malfoy heir and confirmed what he suspected from their meeting outside Gringotts that morning.
“Ah, but Severus, then I wouldn’t let you use it,” the boy smirked at him and damn if he wasn’t a little bit tempted. “And what would be the fun in that?” Severus scoffed dismissively but said no more on the matter undoubtedly confirming his desire to see, and thus use, the possibly ingenious creation of the thrice damned Marauders.
Severus didn’t even want to think about the dismissive tone Peverell used when saying that. This boy always managed to give him a headache, secret prodigy or not.
“Why don’t we join Barty for a drink?” He walked over to the fire and Tom summoned a House Elf to fetch firewhisky and some light food.
“Your fourth year, my Lord,” Barty said, emphasising his formality despite having permission to address his Lord informally. He felt the situation called for it. It would send a clear message to Malfoy and Snape just who had his loyalty.
“You are correct, however,” he continued when the Malfoy heir looked down at his plate. Those stunning silver eyes rose to once again fix wholly on him. He was being selfish, he knew, but Draco was the embodiment of perfect. He wanted nothing else to claim Draco’s attention. “Tom, Severus, your Father and I are taking a little trip this afternoon to a lovely disaster of a house in Surrey.”
“Dumbledore’s actions now, I’m not entirely certain of but, taking advantage of a mind plagued by guilt and despair, he managed to get Sirius to hunt down the traitorous Marauder who sold out his friends and ignore his urge to look after his godson.” Hadrian’s face was murderous as he talked of the man he thought most responsible for his parents deaths.
It was apparent that Tom assumed wrong, however, as Lucius Malfoy himself was pacing the Dark Lord’s study muttering incoherently at the audacity of Hadrian Peverell’s latest insult to his character. The group of wolves as well as Draco and Severus had recently departed with Hadrian to Gringotts for Harry Potter’s will reading (another thought that greatly amused the Dark Lord and he hoped Hadrian would be willing to share the memories upon his return). During their journey to the floo, Lucius had expressed the intent of accompanying his son to the bank to ensure his heir’s protection, despite knowing the Goblins would never let him enter without an invitation and not having received one. His mistrust of Hadrian’s ability was clear with his actions and Hadrian did not take kindly to the insult. He was the more powerful of the two Lords and Lucius should have known not to question Hadrian’s ability to protect his guests.
“Is that right, Lucius?” Peverell said, his voice turning dangerous as he passed the Lovegood girl to Barty and finally stood. He was taller that Lucius only by a centimetre or two but he seemed to tower over the Malfoy Lord as his magic whipped around him. “I have purer blood than you could ever hope to have, Lord Malfoy.” The title was said with such condescension that Severus would bet his best cauldron even Lucius could pick up on it.
“Would you mind running a diagnostic test please, Severus?” Peverell asked turning wide green eyes down to the pitiful sight before him once more. “I’m afraid my medical spells aren’t quite at the professional grade.”
Severus was frozen as he watched young Harry hand his first report card to his Uncle, a proud glint in his eyes at the ‘A’s he’d gained in all his areas of study. He dared not breathe as Vernon Dursley’s face turned an impressive shade of purple and Severus’ swore his heart stopped as the fat man exploded. He watched as Dursley dragged the young boy towards the cupboard under the stairs before throwing him against the wall. Yelling about the ‘ungrateful freak’ who dared get higher grades than his stupid son. He watched as the man removed his belt and whipped the boy in front of him until all he could see was red. Severus watched as a young Harry Potter was thrown into his cupboard, blood streaming from the lashes in his back, and told he would be staying there, with no food, for the week.
Draco nodded emphatically and Severus sent up a prayer to whatever gods were listening that the world would survive Hadrian Peverell and Draco Malfoy working together.
I'd also like to thank my Beta Liz for being the set of eyes I need after looking at the same 3000 words for two weeks. You're a saint.
“Well,” Peverell started, “there was the Philosopher’s stone in first year. Dumbledore had it all planned out to trap Tom and test me at the same time, but he obviously didn’t count on me having a mind of my own.”
His mouth was so close to the redhead’s pulse, fluttering frantically with the pure terror he was no doubt feeling at the moment, and Hadrian just
“Mr. Peverell,” Rita said, seeming to regain her confidence as she attempted to saunter her way up to Hadrian. “It is so good to finally meet you. I am honoured that you would ask me to be here today.”
“I admit I’m not sure Mr. Peverell. I’ve had two interviews with the boy, in his fourth and fifth year, though I never had the chance to ask him more than a few questions, what with Tri-wizard tournament going on and the Ministry breathing down my neck about You-Know-Who. You seem to think that his childhood is something worth talking about, though, Mr. Peverell?”
There were no pictures of the boy, Severus found as he perused the living room. Only those of a whale-like child and his equally animal-like parents. No trace that a fourth person lived in the house at all. Considering this property was actually part of the Potter estate, Severus found that in extremely poor taste.
My dear readers, this is where I bring you news almost too painful to share. At 5:15pm Harry James Potter’s body was found locked in what appeared to be a supply closet under the main staircase of the house. After a careful examination from St. Mungo’s best emergency healers, it was determined that Harry Potter’s death was not caused by the fire. Instead, he departed this world more than 48 hours before the blaze was set.
“I don’t think those were the exact words you used little bird,” she said and the answering growl from her Lord confirmed. “But oh, what the Fire Demons will do to you. You’ll be surrounded by blibbering humdingers for weeks” A glance at her Lord and she knew he had summoned the demons in question. “While we wait…” she raised her wand again and fired a quick succession of silent spells. His left arm shattered, his kneecaps disappeared and he was left with the feeling of spiders crawling over every inch of his skin. As Avery’s cries echoed through the room, Luna made her way back over to her Lord. She curtseyed low again then plopped back down onto his lap to watch the rest of the meeting fold out.
“Now, I’ve saved the best for last.” Harry said dryly, and the greedy glint returned to the eyes of the remaining members of the room. “Molly Weasley, I leave to you thanks in abundance for the food. You unwittingly saved my life that summer after first year, so cheers.”
Okay, some updates on Lord Thanatos. This story starts in the Summer of 1997 so in September Hadrian will be going to Hogwarts in his seventh year. I don't think I've mentioned that clearly before so there you go.
Albus Dumbledore was panicked. Harry Potter was dead and this was not at all what he had planned. Damn that imbecile Dursley and his undoubtedly heavy hand. He had warned the walrus of a muggle what would happen should he go too far with the boy and now here Albus was, sitting in his office trying to contain what would probably be a national crisis, all because the useless oaf couldn’t keep his fists to himself. The Dursley’s should be glad they’d gone on a holiday to Greece, if they ever came back to England they’d face the full wrath of Albus Dumbledore.
Hadrian chuckled, baring his teeth in what might possibly pass as a smile when Lucius caught his eye. He wasn’t very happy with the Malfoy Lord at the moment and he hoped Draco had managed to talk some sense into the man before he entered the room. Hadrian was already in a bad mood. He didn’t need Lucius making it worse.
“Hermione Jean Granger, I give you this advice: you are not the smartest person in every room, and no one wants to hear that you think you are.” Harry’s smirk was positively deadly now and Draco was reminded of Lord Thanatos’ first meeting with the Death Eaters.
The room was silent as everyone looked at the Headmaster in shock. Was this real? Was Harry Potter really abused by his relatives? The Headmaster himself looked furious at the accusation that he refused to save Harry Potter and Sirius was suddenly very certain that it was all Albus fucking Dumbledore’s idea. He wondered if Hadrian had proof and just how vindictive his revenge would be. Personally, Sirius couldn’t wait.
“And what vow is that exactly, Severus,” Tom said, his voice suddenly dripping with barely concealed threat.
Severus stalked into the house he had only seen in memories. It was painfully clean, reeking of chemicals and synthetic fabrics you would never find in the Wizarding World. That a young wizard as enamoured with magic as Hadrian Peverell had to grow up in such an oppressive muggle environment and managed to be even slightly sane, was a testament to Peverell’s strength of character. If he had lived here, Severus was sure he would have strung Petunia Dursley up by her painfully polyester floral patterned curtains within a week.
After a good twenty minutes of the entire Order inhabiting the Black kitchen, Albus Dumbledore finally stepped through the floo. Lilac robes with yellow stars bombarded their way into the room and turned to stand at the head of the table opposite Sirius. Another power play by Albus Dumbledore, but one by Sirius too. By all polite societal rules, the two of them were on equal footing in this meeting and it was clear from the unimpressed look Dumbledore was sporting, that the old man didn’t like it.
to. He scraped his fangs along the pale expanse of skin before him and snickered at the tremor that wrecked through Charlie’s body. He would never look at Hadrian’s mate with that interest
A hoard of Weasleys and Order members inhabited the other end of the kitchen to Sirius Black and his best friend, Remus Lupin. The two remaining Marauders sat in comfortable silence as they observed the sea of red distributing food amongst the Order. All eight Weasleys (sans Percy) surrounded the Granger girl, Ted and Andromeda Tonks, Hestia Jones, Emmeline Vance, Dedalus Diggle, Elphias Doge and Alastor Moody. Dropping platters of food onto the centuries old table engraved with the Black Family crest. If Sirius’ father could see this, he would have rather set the house on fire than eat at this table again. Sirius was very close to sharing that sentiment, though, probably, for rather a different reason.
“That’s good news for your horcrux,” Hadrian said, giving the Dark Lord a pointed look as a smug smile graced the aristocratic features of the older man. “And now that there’s no known way to kill me, maybe you should stop being a prat and absorb the rest of them, oh immortal Dark Lord sir.”
‘The DMLE is working as swiftly as possible to rectify this mistake and a trial for both Peter Pettegrew and Sirius Black has been scheduled for the 3rd of July.’
He stood abruptly, his chair clattering to the ground behind him, and strode determinedly to the front door. Ignoring the pale faces of the Order and the chocked calling of his name from Remus. He had to see it for himself.
Hadrian paused once more for dramatic effect, damn Tom and his overzealous habits, scanning the room and seeing the fire burning in his inner circle’s eyes. “Tonight, Draco darling,” he said, locking emerald green with silver once more, “tonight, Harry Potter dies.” Smiles were wide all throughout the room. They had been waiting for this day for too long.
“There’s no need for formality, Draco,” he said, anyway. His mate need not bow to him the way his Wolves did. Draco was better than them, above them in every way, and would be for an eternity if Hadrian had his way. “You may call me Hadrian.” The light blush that coated his mate’s cheeks, was quite possibly the most endearing thing Hadrian had ever seen. As Draco practically whispered, “of course, Hadrian,” he reminded himself to get Draco alone as soon as possible. They needed to establish an equal footing relationship before Hadrian subjected him to the idea of decades together. He wouldn’t go rushing into this, no matter what Luna thought.
The door at the end of the kitchen opened and Sirius amused himself watching Severus Snape trying to decide whether he should stay closer to the door, and thus the exit, or move to Sirius, Remus and Minerva, further away from the ruckus of Weasleys and food. The dour Potions Master eventually decided on quiet over escape convenience and settled himself next to Minerva to await their illustrious leader.
Neville cleared his throat from his position at Hadrian’s right and he looked up to see the eyes of everyone present locked onto him. His wolves were tightly wound in anticipation, at his left Luna was practically bouncing in her seat with tense excitement, as they waited to see if Skeeter would pull through. Hadrian met the gaze of his beautiful mate as Chronos flew back out the window, no doubt in search of Hedwig, and smiled. It was all white teeth and crazed eyes and Hadrian saw Draco shiver with an emotion Hadrian dearly hoped was positive. “Let’s see what the
Draco observed the stiff composure of the four newcomers that showed how uncomfortable they all must be in the presence of such wealth and power. He wondered how different their reactions would be if they knew exactly who sat before them. The Dark Lord himself was probably just down the hall planning a revolution in his study. Draco watched as Hadrian ordered tea through a House Elf and introduced himself formally, probably aiming to relax his guests. Draco didn’t think it worked particularly well if the forced, unpracticed responses were anything to go by, but maybe Hadrian wasn’t going for friendly in this meeting, rather
Sirius’ patience for the old man and his manipulations regarding Harry was wearing very thin. If he didn’t have the whole, being-an-escaped-prisoner-with-a-rather-large-bounty-on-his-head thing going on, Sirius would have been making Dumbledore’s life a living hell in the political arena. He could no longer take up his Lordship, his time as a convict exceeded the respectable amount for even a
“Remus John Lupin: you’re the kindest man I have ever known and there is nothing that will convince me that you don’t deserve the world. My advice to you; tell him how you feel. I have it on good authority that he feels it too.” Harry winked from the glowing orb and a blush as red as the Weasel’s hair ran up Lupins face so quickly Draco had to resist the temptation to smirk. Black gave Hadrian a questioning look and the slight nod Draco witnessed caused the man’s face to split into a grin so wide there was no mistaking its genuinity.
He noted the stunned forms of the three Weasley’s, Granger and Dumbledore sitting stiffly at the table and wondered how long it would take before Ragnok threw the rabble out.
“This concludes the last will and testament of Harry James Potter-Black, Lord Potter, Lord Black. I wish half of you a very long and happy rest of your lives, and to the other half; fuck off and I’ll see you all in hell,” Harry finished, sadistic mirth in his eyes and the image faded. The orb stopped glowing indicating the end of Harry Potter’s will reading and Ragnok rose from his seat at the head of the table and nodded to Hadrian. He would be taking Griphook to retrieve the items Harry had bequeathed and returning to distribute them accordingly.
“You know, my Lord, you could just tell him.” His little moon bared her throat more, drawing a soft growl from Hadrian.
Avery whimpered and struggled with her iron grip, trying desperately to distance himself from her now hateful stare. “I -,” he started before breaking off suddenly, his eyes flicking to her Lord sat elegantly on his throne. Luna imagined he didn’t want to repeat his damned words, especially not in front of Lord Thanatos, who was insulted the first time. She tightened the grip on his chin and Avery was forced to meet her eyes one more time.
Barty turned away as the image of a bruised, five year old Harry was thrown outside in clothes barely small enough to stay on his tiny body, and told to give his horrid Aunt an award winning garden ‘or else’. He could not bare to watch the memory’s of his young Lord once again. He could never understand how Hadrian had survived his early childhood.
“I can still confiscate items when we get back to Hogwarts, brat,” Severus said to the bane of his existence. “And give you detention.” He added just because he could.
“He still needs someone to ground him.” Draco was struck by the meaning of the twins words. Lovegood was Hadrian’s donor, not his mate. Did that mean that Draco still had a chance? He could only hope, right?
Bill and Charlie get a surprise, Lucius is not happy about it. Hadrian goes territorial and Tom sits back and enjoys the show.
Harry was smart. Scarily so. So Sirius knew there was a reason Harry had sent him that note and he didn’t think it was just to comfort him. At least he
Draco was finding it exceedingly hard to keep an appetite as he sat in the dining room of Peverell Manor. Sat across from his father, to the right of the Dark Lord was Hadrian Peverell, looking completely content with a little blonde sitting on his lap. His strong arm was wrapped around her waist as he fed her food, straight from his plate. There was a slight smudge of red on Lovegood’s pulse point, making it glaringly obvious that the Vampire Lord had spent the better part of the day feeding off the young woman.
This couldn’t be happening! Severus’ life was about to get much more complicated. He was not looking forward to it.
Hadrian was smirking openly now as Lucius’s looked at him in complete horror. “Weasley’s, my Lord?” he said and Hadrian was mildly surprised he managed without stuttering, he looked do shaken. “You expect me to house
They were going to Harry Potter’s will reading and Severus was to look after Draco. That was it. No keeping tabs on certain members of the Order. No distracting Dumbledore while the wolves completed some covert mission. No slipping a poison into Molly Weasley’s tea. Nothing of the sort. Just to make sure Draco sat between Severus and Hadrian Peverell and to look after the boy.
"I'm not really picky," Harry says nodding but looking away. He freezes when his eyes lock on Malfoy twirling Pansy from across the room. Her dress is beautiful and Harry had to bite his tongue when she takes a false trip to move closer to Draco.
"Potter, don't act like an idiot. You're Head Auror for a reason. You're smart and handsome and people trust you-"
"You know, you could even renew your vows. It'd be so nice to have everyone there this time. Draco could have the full show he wanted last time."
Travis doesn't quite give up the charade, but his look becomes more searching as if he's expecting something to happen.
"This is your favorite spell isn't it, Potter? Being able to fuck yourself like this. You're such a pathetic little slut. It's amazing. Some saviour you turned out to be. You're just a slave like everyone else.
"We're not having this conversation again, Potter." Draco stood and kissed Harry on the cheek before starting to walk away. "I'm glad you aren't dead."
"Well he has eyes, hasn't he?" Harry says still angry and drags the tired and bobbing blond out of the bar towards an apparation point so that they can go home.
"D-Draco, I've never- I'm gonna- Oh fuck-" Harry rambled on, but Draco pulled his mouth off with an obscene pop and tightened his grip around the base of the throbbing prick in front of his face. Harry looks down at him and his swollen lips and his cock twitches in his hand.
Malfoy hasn't spoken to him in almost 2 weeks and Ron keeps making jokes about dating (like he would even know) and it's starting to drive Harry more than a little barmy. He's been sending owls and training on his own, but when the first trial happens and there's a dragon chasing after him, he can see the terrified look on Draco's face and the tight grip he finds himself in afterwards is proof enough.
"We're going to a muggle place?" Draco asked surprised. They owned a car, sure, but only for muggle excursions. For places that it would seem odd to just appear to. Otherwise they just apparated and walked.
"Of course I do, but unlike Travis and your other junior CBs, it's not the only thing I love about you."
Then Professor McGonagall informs her that the champions start the opening dance. Oh boy! Fred has no idea how to dance either, so she figures that both of them can just wobble awkwardly on the dance floor for a bit. It's only fun embarrassing yourself when someone else is embarrassing themselves with you.
Harry squeezes her eyes tight, then takes one step up. Then another. Then another two. She glides up the stairs with ease and all her hesitation slips away. Still, she waits with bated breath for the stairs to slough into a slide, to whisk her away. But they stay standing, grounded, under her feet.
By herself, she sits in her common room. Later that day she ends up buying her own ad in The Prophet. Although hers is on the second page and Gemini is on the cover, hers garners just as much buzz.
A cooling touch presses into her shoulder. "I'll take it from here, thank you," Gemini says, tone blindingly cross.
Millicent blinks slowly. "I said, I heard from Professor Snape that the third challenge involves a maze with creatures from the Forbidden Forest."
Instead of sitting by the tables, however, they sit by the bookshelves, so Malfoy easily spots the book Harry is carrying and nearly forgets to cast a hasty silencing spell before she starts to talk in her excitement.
Since Malfoy had insisted that they shouldn't be spotted in public together, they had taken residence in the library whenever they met. Something to do with a death eater father, Harry guessed. If she met up with Malfoy in private she could escape any of Ron's or Hermione's prying questions, so she didn't complain.
Harry turns away to the fire. "I've always cared. Why do you think I was so angry every time you made fun of me? If I didn't give a fuck I wouldn't retaliate."
The Slytherin dorms are barren when they step in. Malfoy puts on the blouse and skirt. They don't fit as well as they should because of her wider shoulders, and she visibly sulks over that, not trying to purposefully fish for compliments.
"I didn't even give you your present." Harry reaches into her coat to take out a necklace with a pink charm hanging off its reins. It digs into her palm when she holds it tight. "I hope you'll like it... it's a portable voice modification charm, to make it more feminine. I know your voice already started breaking. I hope it helps."
Second year is as eventful as it can be when you’re a walking target for what seemed like the entire wizarding world, trying to escape death at every step. She gets called the heir of Slytherin,  pulls a sword from a hat, murders a basilisk, finds out Lucius Malfoy’s probably in cahoots with Voldemort, and kicks a different skirt under her bed every time Dean Thomas does homework on her bed.
Hey guys, lmao, i know i'm updating this slowly, but to be fair, i used to be incapable of finishing fucking anything even oneshots so this fic is kind of a big deal to me, like, if i can finish this, i can write a novel, and i reallllly want to write a novel lmao
Finally, Draco swallows his pride and brings his eyes up from the ground to settle instead on Harry Potter. He’s dressed smartly in a muggle suit and a black dress robe. His hair is even tamed beneath a genderless, grey headband. He picks Edward up with a smile that rivals the tenacity of the sun, though it hides behind the clouds today. Just as the smile doesn’t reach Potter’s eyes.
“He can sleep through anything, aye?” Harry hums awkwardly, jutting his thumb in the pushchair’s direction, a still slumbering Edward inside it. Draco huffs a humorless laugh and buries his hands deep into his robe pockets.
“I hardly know how to apologize. Andromeda did help, of course, or else I’d be rotting away in a fucking cell with my parents by now. This is to say, I am sorry.” Draco closes his eyes and takes a shuddering breath. For Edward. “I make no excuses. I was a shitey little twat, I know that now. I made all the wrong choices, and I know now that they were wrong. I’ve hurt so, so many people, you and your family most of all, and I…well, I have no excuse.
Draco hikes his cousin further up his hip, and encourages the boy with two gentle fingers on his chin to meet his eyes. Edward’s appearance conveys his mood, his eyes heavily-lidded and a deep black, his hair limp and grey. He’s confused, somber.
Draco’s answer comes in way of another sigh, defeat of his own in place now. No, Draco supposes, there would be nothing wrong with a simple cup of tea with Harry Potter.
He does feel a smidgen better than before, relieved in a way he still doesn’t think he quite deserves, but it’s a start.
No, because this is Harry Potter, who has a rather terrifying, war-ridden stubbornness and a radiant, inescapable light about him that has never failed to draw Draco in like a moth to flame.
“Sorry to leave you waiting, I’m sure you’re not used to it.” Draco chuckles, coming into the room as though he’d never spied on one of the most intimate moments he’s ever seen, much less one with Harry Potter involved. Besides, he doubts it’ll be the last one of the night.
“Out like a light, that one. How does he do it?” Potter comes back with his usual, dazzling smile, and Draco looks at him steadfastly. Potter stumbles and his smile falters. “What’s wrong?”
“Malfoy, I will never say that the things you did are okay. But, I know a thing or two about not having control over your own destiny.” Potter begins hoarsely, and he’s staring Draco down as though if he looks away he’ll lose all his nerve. “I’d be a bullock not to understand that you weren’t entirely in control of your actions. I saw it, actually. You know.” Potter gestures to his scar.
He grabs a handful of stale owl treats from their dish on the windowsill, and throws them at the screeching thing.
“Morning, Draco. Morning, Teddy!” Harry alights, grabbing the swing from the air and stopping Edward’s ascent abruptly. Teddy trills at the sensation, his laughter like so many bells. Draco hides a smile behind his gloved hand.
“Fair enough, where are you staying?” Potter asks, foraging for a piece of parchment and a quill, which he finds, though as haphazard and crumpled as they are. It reminds Draco glaringly of Rubeus Hagrid.
Or perhaps, that’s just Draco. Because as certain as the light, joy, and love in Potter that not even Draco denies is there, all its opposites and antithesis lie in Draco like sleeping beasts. Maybe, Draco seems to think he needs Potter’s light to wake them up, shoo them off. But, hate is what Draco was taught, hate is power. Pride, survival, hate; Malfoys were made of these things and not much else.
Potter’s cheeks gleam strangely and his eyes glimmer. He looks as though something about him has fundamentally changed all at once, and fuck if Draco doesn’t know exactly how that feels.
Harry seems to have been watching him, surely to take note on Draco’s extraction of his godson, but the gaze feels heavy. The transfer of the love of Draco’s life to his former archenemy feels elephantine. The warmth of Teddy beating between them makes Draco’s insides swoop and twist, and as soon as Harry has Teddy completely in arms Draco takes a hearty step back. His head feels clouded, his skin prickly; he’s beyond overwhelmed.
Oop, another one, I'm gonna post a chapter a day until I run out and then I'm gonna finish this hoe :D
Dread leaks under his skin and weakens his bones, and the strength it takes to even get up and move to the window is fragile.
Feeling a bit victorious when Potter cracks a crooked smile, Draco cannot help the breathy laugh that leaves him. He sucks it right back in, shaken, his cheeks no doubt blooming an acute magenta. This, however, only causes Potter’s smile to grow until he, too, is laughing.
“Yes, well, he seems to have taken up Weasley’s table side manners.” Draco replies quietly, face pinching, hands in fists. “Tea?” he asks in a desperate attempt to bide more time.
“Yes, Edward.” Draco relents, stepping around Andromeda’s grave. The closer he gets, the more vibrant the green of Potter’s eyes become. They always look so much greener than they are on days like this, when the sky promises a proper storm.
“Right.” Potter says shortly, and Draco spares him a habitual glance. Potter is staring at him almost in shock, his tea now in his grasp, the cup looking small in his long, seeker hands. Draco looks away again. No, meeting Potter’s eyes in this moment is impossible.
“No, poppet, I’m not okay. Your godfather and I have very important things to discuss.” Draco chatters, eyes flickering to the table where the three of them had eaten dinner. Indian, that Harry bought and Draco had put on Andromeda’s fine, black and gold china. Dinner had been simple, consisted of everyday small talk over the scratching of silver- which anyone can handle, even Draco and is once loathed enemy.
Certainly, surely, Draco has always felt an unmistakable pull to the other man, even before he’d met the bastard. From what he’d hear slithering out of his father’s mouth, to the extravagant illustrations of him in storybooks Draco stole away, Potter has always been present in his life. It’s practically in any wizard's childhood itinerary, to go through a healthy if obsessive fascination with The Boy Who Lived. Although, whether it be out of admiration, envy, complete loathing, and the presently and confusedly unlabeled, Draco supposes his Potter phase never ended.
“Yeah, thank you.” Potter hums, already advancing on Edward, who bounces and squeals into his arms, and then Draco is in the kitchen and they’re out of his sight, and he can’t breathe.
I know i said i'd post a chapter everyday, but yesterday was like...not a good day for me, while also being a really great day?? i was distracted, basically, so, here we go!
“I suppose I should start with an apology.” Draco stares pointedly at his hands and nowhere else, blushing at their trembling. “You know better than most how hard this is for me, so let me just- get on with it, yeah?”
Draco has always simply acquainted it to his celebrity, his almost tangible power, his talent; glorified and romanticized as it is. How could one not be drawn to that? Jealous of that? Hate that? Inevitably are drawn to that time and time again?
“Another time, perhaps.” Potter sighs, waving his hand and standing. He comes to sit beside Draco, who of course scoots further away; he certainly cannot handle any touching right now. If Potter touches him Draco is sure he’ll combust.
“Teddy, Andromeda will always be with you. Here.” Potter tells him gently, pressing a long, spindly finger against Edward’s chest. Draco rolls his eyes.
