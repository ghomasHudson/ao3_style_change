Draco spends the rest of the week amongst his plants in the garden. He digs in to the dirt and plants flowers beds, pulling weeds until his body is left sweaty and aching as the sun sets each evening. Some mornings his mother joins him. She doesn't say anything as she crouches next to him, lovely in her sunhat and apron, and they work in that comfortable silence. Theo rides Persephone around the property line and even offers Draco a turn, such a rare offer, that Draco becomes stricken with the realization that his wound is bleeding onto everyone in the house.
“Professor!”
Unbeta'd, but I'm trying!
"Who would have thought Draco Malfoy would have a green thumb?"
Draco crosses out another line, his quill digging into the parchment. At least it wasn’t running away with his hand anymore. Having Harry by his side meant Draco’s magic felt balanced more often than not. Unfortunately it did not to help him when it came to drafting a letter to his mother.
Draco snorts. "I'll bet! Does it mean more to you that they're happy as long as I'm miserable?" Draco swipes a small bowl of Bertie Bott's
"Auror training must keep you busy, Harry." This comes from Boot, finally pulling himself away from Draco's side to say goodbye to the rest of their companions. "Have you found another flat?"
Draco snaps the newspaper shut and tosses it into the fire, which roars a brilliant green.
"No, I just don't see you as the type to work outdoors. Get your hands dirty."
Blaise blinks rapidly, for once too stunned to make a flip remark. Instead, he offers Potter his genuine thanks, pronouncing the save to be quite agreeable of him.
“And Gryffindors are the braves ones. So you can see the complication,” says Parvati.
“Me?!” Potter’s eyes flash. “I just saved his life!”
"That’s funny." Potter doesn't lower his voice, despite sounding annoyed. "Considering I didn’t know myself until a year ago."
and the reminder of Potter’s presence is reassuring. Honestly Draco thinks he should be used to the stares by now. He certainly would have eaten up this kind attention a few years ago when he’d been so desperate for it.
Sunday is spent in bed. It’s an opportunity for Draco to catch up on his sleep, to watch the dust mites dance in the beams of sunlight coming in through his window. He thumbs through the books on his nightstand but they don’t catch his interest, tries parting his hair several different ways in the mirror, picks out several of his pristine robes to be sent to the tailor for minor infractions.
“Gladly! Go be superior somewhere else!”
Draco examines the spread before him with a critical eye. It'd been difficult to put together, even with the entire network of people he'd reached out to. Somehow he'd been able to track down more of those horrid frozen pizzas, using a strange telly box Chang said muggles were crazy about. Neville had helped him track down the ingredients used for Potter's favorite dessert, and strangely Weasley's mother, through Weasley, had shown him how to make it. In another twist of fate, it was Romilda Vane who'd helped him track down a box of crazy straws, and Lovegood who'd known just what to do with the information he'd sent her.
"You've been talking to Theo," Draco says, watching Blaise's face for confirmation.
The skeptical look he receives is not completely unwarranted. "This is starting to become a habit with you."
Draco grabs Harry's wrist and pulls it towards his aching cock. A few strokes and he’s spilling over Harry’s fingers, thick strips, and Draco wants to cry, he’s so grateful for release.
Distilling their relationship down to something as simple as friendship, would never be the most viable option, but remained

of heels. “I’ve nearly finished my essay and if I don’t do it now, I’ll never get to my Charms work.”
"Draco, honestly, I don't know! I get my orders through the Aurors and--"
“If this is where I’m supposed to start kissing your arse because we’ve managed to go five minutes without socking each other, you’re going to leave quite disappointed.”
stocking i is currently the heaviest.
"You spent five weeks with The Order rooting out the last of the dark lord’s followers," Theo continues, failing to see Abernathy’s entrance or unbothered by it enough to censor himself should his voice carry, though Draco isn’t sure of which, "and yet they’ve still got you jumping through hoops."
"Henry?"
“And the ring?”
Draco frowns. She hasn't said anything he doesn't already know. "Your point?"
Then the carriage jolts and Draco pulls off roughly, panting. Harry's stares up at him, his chest heaving, his face flushed. His lips are so full, they look bruised and Draco wants to bite down on the pout of his lower lip, feel the flesh of it between his teeth. Dimly Draco registers that he's hard, that the night air feels cool against the back of his neck. The horses have slowed. Draco dismounts from Harry's lap and flees for the safety of the seat opposite.
“It wasn’t bad,” Weasley nods, and he sounds just as surprised as the others look to hear him say it. “See you around, Malfoy.”
“Feel?” Potter’s confusion is tangible as he shifts his weight. “What do you mean?”
"Not yet," says Potter, carefully. "I’m sure Ginny’s ready to kick me out on my arse, but Luna’s put her off it until convocation." He smiles fondly at Lovegood, who smiles back.
“Half right doesn’t earn you a knut. It has to be exact to count.”
“Are you alright?” Ernie leans in, placing a warm hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco turns to him. His blonde eyebrows are knit and it makes his entire face scrunch. Draco wants to laugh. Objectively, Ernie isn’t his type with his fair features similar to Draco’s own, but he’s handsome enough, and if Draco didn’t suspect that he was hopelessly straight, he’d would be tempted to make a go of it. As it were, he only nods, suddenly incredibly tired.
says Draco lamely, knowing full well he looks, and sounds, like an asshole.
“Wise, that Lovegood.” Draco makes a mental note to check on her when the next time he has a chance. He’s already bought her present, but had thought to send it anonymously, lest she get the impression that he cares about her.
Draco turns onto his side and snuggles into his pillows, already feeling sleep settle over him, pulling at him down into its depths. “Clean yourself up,” he mumbles as his eyes close. “And don’t get caught.”
“C’mere Fang, you mangy scamp. Let ‘im eat in peace.” Hagrid pats the dog’s head as he bounds noisily to his side of the table, before passing Draco a dingy handkerchief with a grimace. “Sorry Malfoy. Still getting used to you, I suppose.”
"Christ. Has Theo been experimenting again?"
“Sure, Hagrid. Why not.”
Prompt:
"Their beater is best in the league, but I don't like him much. Bit of a show-off." Potter's eyes widen and Draco feels himself blush. "Their new seeker could use a bit of work," he says quickly, "but their average hasn't dipped yet and they're on track to qualify for the finals."
Pansy lifts a hand to rub his arm. Her sympathetic expression is almost comically insincere. They settle into a comfortable silence.
It’s with great reluctance when Draco finally rises onto his knees, stretching his arms over his head. He has to get back to the dungeons soon for a quick shower before bed. If he’s lucky he’ll avoid Theo and Blaise, who are just as bad as Pansy when it comes to gossip and will undoubtedly want an account of his entire afternoon.
"Wait— what?"
“I said I’d
"You tell me, as you've just done it." Potter shoves by to greet Lovegood, leaving Draco to fume.
"That's not true," Lovegood shakes her head. "Harry's been looking forward to it every week. He told me so. I knew you kissed before Blaise told me."
They step into the fire and are gone, leaving Draco in the middle of the floor, alone with his thoughts.
Potter shakes his head. “I think this is different, Ron. Malfoy’s not the one actually issuing a command, so there’s no intent behind it. And it doesn’t seem like we can use it on each other…
Draco chokes on his spit. "E-excuse me?"
“Malfoy!” Potter sounds breathless, his arms full of paper and bows as he rounds the corner with Ginny, Weasley, and Granger in tow. “Sorry, we got caught up talking about some stuff. Over here.” He leads them towards the squishy sofa and low table in front of the fireplace. It’s occupied by two second years girls who depart without a word at Potter’s arrival, one grateful smile from him enough to send them giggling to the other side of the room. Draco drops his bag onto the table with a thud.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hermione's been busy. She's got things going on at the Ministry and then there's the thing Harry asked her to--"
“I’ll decide who and I do, and do not, consort with for myself, thanks!” Potter’s furious voice rises above the din. Draco shakes off the ugly thin man and approaches Potter. He sneers at the reporter, contempt written all over his face. “And I’ll ask you to stay out of my business, as it’s the holidays and I just want to get a bit of shopping done! Excuse me!”
Items secured, Draco grips his wrapping paper (a tasteful roll of deep green with a hint of silver sparkle), a roll of ribbon, and heads for Gryffindor Tower.
“Put it on. Let’s see if anything’s changed since last year.”
"Draco."
"What friendship? You said yourself:
“So bring her along,” says Pansy, waving a flippant hand. “We’re not going to
She nods, a wane smile on her face. "I know. Don't worry about me. I just want to make sure you'll be alright. Run along now, it's almost seven."
Draco smirks. “I didn’t know you cared, Granger.”
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy?” She ask with barely concealed trepidation.
Karrey opens the door and indicates Draco should pass through. By route, he pulls out his wand and hands it to Karrey, who has yet to produce his box. He fumbles with Draco's wand, almost dropping it, before recovering. Karrey's bat-like ears stand to attention. "Mr. Draco..."
Draco decides to order the most visually pleasing meal on the menu: a plate of artfully arranged chicken wings, dipped in a marinade of liquid gold and dusted with gold flakes.
"You've read my file?!"
Draco shakes off the sudden wave of arousal. “Morning, Potter. Bit of a late start for you, isn’t it? Spend the wee hours of the morning skulking about the castle again?”
She blushes and moves aside, allowing him to climb through. He winks as he pulls the door closed.
Rather than answer, Parvati leans forward and sticks her finger through the middle of Draco’s scroll.
“Fucking hell!” Weasley howls. He grips an arse cheek in one hand and fumbles for his wand with the other. Draco hand goes to his thigh.
Harry has the nerve to laugh. “How’d I know!? I followed you, you arse.” He indicates the invisibility cloak, lying abandoned behind him back by the stairs. His smile turns cheeky. “That’s kind of
Karrey brings their menus, and there's a lull in conversation as everyone deliberates. When the entrees are presented, much faster this time than at the market place, their plates are laden with all form of decadence - no galleon has been spared. Potter however, frowns.
Potter speaks suddenly from behind Draco. He hadn't even noticed his approach. "I didn't know you liked flowers."
His head whips around, eyes bugged behind the lens of his hideous glasses as Potter cranes his neck to look up at him. “How did you get in here??” He leans his torso around Draco to check the door behind him. Like he’s invited everyone in his house to accompany him. The memory of the cabinets prickles uncomfortably in his memory, and Potter’s agitation hits him.
Prompt:
He tosses it in disgust, shaking his head when footsteps come to a stop behind him. Draco really ought to have known. He’d probably watched the whole thing like some vigilante voyeur.
Potter snorts. "Can't have that, can we?"
Blaise looks at Draco like he’s asked him to spell his own name.
With a shaky breath, Draco opens his eyes. He isn’t aware he’d even shut them until now. Around the circle, everyone stares back, looking, if possible, even more expectant than when he’d began.
Harry whirled around, confused. "Sorry?"
"If you're referring to Harry's hunch about Malfoy’s behaviour being correct," Granger continues without missing a beat, "I'm likely to agree with you. Because I'd hate to think you've forgotten the five years prior that Malfoy spent making Harry's life miserable."
“How about, how did you sleep last night?” Malfoy bites the inside of cheek, doing his best to sound casual as he keeps his eyes forward.
Harry starts with a suddenness that suggests his mind was very far away. “No, that’s okay. I think they suspected something was up anyway.”
"I wasn't spying on you!" Harry shouts back, sitting up. "Everything isn't always about you, believe it or not! Have you ever considered that
Draco shrugs as he stands, testing his weight. He’s annoyed and he can’t tell if the feel is coming from Potter or himself. He knows Potter knows he’s here by the way he won’t look anywhere in their direction and it rankles his nerves. Without another word to Pansy, he pushes out onto the ice and does a lap around the rink, taking pleasure in the way his blades slice into the surface of the ice and the way the cold air burns his cheeks, whips his hair. There’s a shadow of flying to it if he moves fast enough. Draco angles his body low to reduce drag and increases his speed.
"I thought you said you were observant," Draco says. He's certainly observant. Potter's moved closer. They're touching from hip to knee. "We're the ambitious ones, remember? I'm the kind to do whatever I have to to get what I want... if I want it bad enough."
“I sleep enough,” Potter snaps with the kind of subtly that confirms he’d have been eaten alive in Slytherin.
"Stop following me, Potter! I mean it, I'm liable to do something I'll regret!"
Unlike the Sorting Hat of their first year, there’s no whispering voice inside Draco’s head. What there is, is a pouring warmth, followed by a cooling sensation -- like being submerged in an icy bath or the icy brush of Dementors robes.
and feels helpless to stop. Shocked, Draco claps a hand over his mouth, nearly displacing a display of self-indexing parchment as his shoulders shake.
repeats, roused from his thoughts. He takes a good look around. Sometime during his tangent, Potter spelled the bed-hangings shut.
“Goodnight, Malfoy,” Granger echoes. Her eyes dart from Potter back to him. She bites her lip as if she wants to say something but thinks better of it, linking her arm though Weasley’s sister’s and heading for the girls dorm.
Then Ernie’s cheeks start to swell. “Whuu—” They never get to hear the rest. Ernie’s tongue falls heavy from his mouth, slopping onto the ground and unfurling itself like a slimy, pink, carpet. Several students scramble out of the way as his tongue keeps rolling further down the tiers.
“They wouldn’t let us in,” Pansy starts immediately, her eyes roving his face. Draco thinks she might be checking to make sure everything is still where it belongs. “Hangingbone sent us all off immediately after they too you and he-who-shall-not-be-sorted to the infirmary.”
"Oh yes," Lovegood says, her ridiculously oversized earrings swinging as she nods. "I suspect he’s been following you for quite some time now." She turns to Blaise as she straightens to stand tall once more. "We should check the hall for rocks before we go, just to be safe."
Hangingbone takes another step closer this time and Draco startles to realize he doesn’t have enough room to take anymore back, unless he plans to jump into the water. It’s not a terrible plan; he’s a decent enough swimmer after many summers on the beaches of France. But the water tonight is black and angry. He’s seen enough of their depth from the other side of the dungeon’s thick glass and understands why Potter had to face it to become a Triwizard champion.
“Tell the Headmistress what?” says the cool, confident voice of Ginny Weasley. “That he’s threatened you all with a roll of Christmas paper? Threatened to hogtie Harry with ribbon?” She snorts. “At least Malfoy’s got gifts to wrap - now that Marie’s dumped you, your shopping list is lighter, isn’t it Simon?”
“One has to play to their strengths.” Draco smirks. “Since when has modesty ever worked on you?”
!” Draco explodes. “Not pit me against them!”
"Draco. Go tomorrow. Talk to Potter. I can tell you with certainty that he'll be there." He flicks his wand in a quick tempus. "We have to go before Robards gets back to his desk. Come on, Lovegood, I'll treat you to one of those Beetroot drinks you enjoy so much." He catches Draco's eye over Luna's shoulder and shakes his head.
+++++
"White strips, Potter."
Blaise stands. Lovegood does as well, wandering around the room to check under the chaise and behind the side tables. Draco assumes she's still on about the rocks.
"Pretty sure staying out of it counts as 'something’ And I'm already suffering." The corners of Theo’s lips twitch once, twice, before they finally bleed over into a smirk that stretches across his face. "I’ve been here over a month and yet still not a one of your house elves has revealed themselves to know how to make a decent cuppa."
Soon the clearing transforms into a tree-lined path. The sun continues to slip behind the horizon and Draco can't help feeling nostalgic – the surroundings remind him a bit of Wiltshire and the Manor, before when the Dark Lord had been nothing more than a whisper of a name. The path at the end opens up to a giant glass Conservatory, complete with a large circular drive and huge fountain sitting in the middle. There are flower bushes and topiaries, giant hedges and gorgeous fruit trees everywhere Draco looks. It's beautiful.
“Oi, Death Eater, scum! Should have gone to Azkaban, like your father!” The man’s face is blotchy with angry, purple robes swamping his thin frame. “Potter’s been through enough without having to put up with the likes of you!”
He’s also grown use to the way people grow quiet when he enters a space. At least this time Potter is suffering the same. It must be strange, after the news of their Muggle Studies brawl spread around the school, to see the two them walking side by side, voluntarily in each other’s presence with no wands drawn.
The thought of stroked egos makes Draco think of other things. He subtly rearranges himself, spreading his napkin over his lap. His shoulder bumps into Potter, and Potter turns to smile at Draco, bumping him back. Weasley distracts Potter’s attentions away with a tray of bacon; Draco silently curls his fingers into fists under the table, inhaling through his nose.
“Alright.”
"Will do," Harry waves them off, then turns to Draco. "Shall we?" He indicates the empty carriage.
Potter spins to face him. “The truth?”
"Fuck," he breathes, watching Harry from under heavy-lidded eyes. Draco brings his hips up. "Do you know how good you look?"
“Naughty,” Draco points to himself. He points to Harry. His pupils are blown. “Nice.”
(See the end of the chapter for
So it wasn't until Malfoy arrived, hair rumpled, mouth sleep soft, as if he'd risen from a sensuous dream to slip on his tighter-than-regulation-sanctioned uniform and appear before Harry, that he realized he might have a problem. That really, he should have called anyone
"I'll bet. And now you've given me your cake."
It seems to happen in slow-motion. A branch in a neighboring tree, directly over Blaise’s head comes loose. Draco barely has time to open his mouth when Potter, quick as a flash, lashes his wand at the branch and it explodes into a shower of wood chips and splinters.
"I’ve been telling you you’re ordinary for years! Then you actually do something that can’t be denied — you save my life twice — and you don’t want anyone to acknowledge it?!"
Draco falls forward, jerks as Harry removes his fist, so that each pulse is caught, slick and wet, between their stomachs. Biting his bottom lip, Draco curls in hand into Harry’s hair, let’s him fuck up into him, whines when as hot pulses of spunk fill him up.
“How enterprising of her,” Draco muses as he ties his skates. As far as he’s concerned, Anthony Goldstein is the most oblivious wizard
to go along with it. There were plenty of girls and guys, Draco suspects, vying for the opportunity to have Potter press them into the mattress. He can only imagine the damage it would do to Potter’s reputation if anyone were to find out he was shagging a former Death Eater. Not to mention the
"I didn’t say I’d read it." Romilda pouts. "I said I’d heard. What’s good journalism without sources?"
“I wouldn’t worry. You’ve already proven you’re not great at it.”
It’s hard not to just stand and admire someone like Harry Potter. Even with the frown and the slight slouch as he buries his hands in his pockets, Potter cuts a striking figure. It’s not just his dark hair and bright eyes - it’s his broad shoulders, the dip of his waist, the way his denim hugs the curve of his arse just right -- he seems to exude a brooding confidence, a strength, that draws the eye. Draco notices as others stand on Potter’s perimeter, gesturing to him when they think he’s not looking, debating whether to approach him for a picture. It’s something he’ll probably have to deal with his whole life, the public scrutinizing his every move to filter his actions through the lens of their own morals.
From the bed, she shoots him a rude gesture before motioning Draco to continue.
“Yeah,” Potter agrees cryptically, lowering himself onto the bleachers to perch on the end of it. “Say Ernie, how’s a hot drink sound? Some butterbeer?” Draco darts to grab Potter’s wrist, but he’s already summoned a house elf. “Two butter beers, Minzy, please. That is, unless Malfoy— would you like one?” Potter offers, turning to him.
“And what about me? I have to put up with Potter,” Draco tries to joke, but it doesn’t work for either of them. He can feel Potter’s anger, made worse by the fear that roils in Draco’s stomach as he feels the eyes of the crowd upon him. “If you have a problem sir, I suggest you take it up with the Ministry. They’re the ones who made the final decision.”
"Well, not all of it."
Draco’s brows nearly disappear into his hairline. “
“…and it might even be a way to calibrate our magic,” Draco says, shaking his head as if in a daze. Was he really suggesting they fool around in order to preserve their magical ability?
Draco descends the staircase, his polished shoes clicking on the marble,
"Be well, Draco," Lovegood says, darting forward for a quick hug. Blaise grabs a handful of floo powder off the mantle and throws it into the fire. "Ministry of Magic, Head Auror Gawain Robards office."
"Potter?" Draco blurts gracelessly. He could kick himself. Instead he crosses his arms tightly, willing himself not to fidget. He shrugs nonchalantly in the face of Weasley’s knit eyebrows. "He always did like keeping track of my whereabouts."
To his horror, Draco’s vision goes blurry, the elderly man obscuring into smears of colors as fat tears roll down his cheeks. He feels his chest hitch and a moment later, he’s crying in earnest.
“Luna did say I’d have made a good Ravenclaw,” Potter muses, as they pass the runaway crup once again, tearing the opposite way up the road. “But she also regularly reports that my Aura would benefit from a good bowl of boiled gillyweed and cabbage for regularity.”
"I knew you were upset about that!" Potter twists to face him, tamping down on a disbelieving laugh that almost sounds fond. He jostles
“Yeah.” Harry tilts his head, thoughtfully. There are smudges on the lens of his glasses. “Besides, something tells me it’ll be much more entertaining if I stay here. I’m sure Parkinson has read the article by now.”
“I like your --” he motions to Theo’s pencil thin moustache and beard combo.
"And not a modicum of modesty. Because then we'd both be in trouble."
"So why couldn't you tell me that?" Draco leaps off the bed, running a furious hand through his hair. "I wouldn't have judged you! I'm seeing the same fucking Mind Healer if you hadn't noticed!"
Pansy lowers her sunglasses. "I don’t understand."
"No."
The assessing look Bellero gives Potter says she greatly doubts this, but she goes obediently, Draco wincing as her talons dig once again into his shoulder as she takes off.
Draco goes very still. Weighs his options. "The suppers?"
Potter softly clears his throat, "Karrey, could you bring us something to drink, please? Draco likes apples. Perhaps you can make something?"
“I’ve never really had time to consider it before. I think it started around The Cup.” He doesn’t need to elaborate any more than that. They both know which event he’s speaking of. “It was the first time I really realized there’s magic all over the world, not just Britain. It makes me curious.”
"I’m not a Slytherin anymore either, but that’s still a problem for you!" Draco rounds the bed, pajama bottoms in hand. He thrusts his naked arm under Harry’s nose. "Look at it. It’s there. It’s never going to go away." He yanks his arm back to tug on his pajamas, wrestling with the ties when they knot. He doesn’t know what he’ll do if he has to stay here another minute. "Someday you’re going to have to accept it. Or not. Fucking hell!" Draco gives up and pulls on his robe.
On the edge of their group, Potter fidgets. Draco feels an almost odd detachment as he watches him from the corner of his eye. Potter looks just as out of it as Draco feels, standing with his hands buried in his pockets, dark hair falling into his eyes. Distantly, Longbottom motions for Blaise to come help, asks him to aim his wand at a knot high in the tree while they attempt a severing charm at the base.
"Thank you, Granger." Pansy stifles a
“I told you it was a bad choice,” Weasley laughs. He has a pair of slippers on the table before him, sizing up how much paper they require. “There’s house pride and then there’s just plain obnoxious. One year, mum had a roll of paper with festive gnomes dressed in nothing but Santa Hats and Poinsettia flowers.”
That’s when it hits Draco. His mean-spirited laughter dies on his lips as his stomach drops to his feet.
“She never found out who’s naughty or nice.”
"I'm an enormous fan of fresh herbs."
“I think you’ve earned this,” Blaise says, slipping a piece of paper face down across the table. Draco picks it up. It’s another calendar page, this one of a thin, but toned, dark haired man with nothing on but a stylized reindeer thong covering his bits. He’s much more Draco’s type, but like hell he’ll let Blaise know that. “Why does your calendar have two Decembers?”
“I am rather fond of blood pops.”
Potter steps forward with a curious sort of reverence that Draco chalks up to Potter’s general curiosity of his surroundings. Draco tries to view the room through Potter’s eyes, like the common room, his heart skipping a traitorous beat when Potter approaches the bed on the far end. His fingers splay over the sheets. “This is your bed.” The statement books no room for argument.
to thank for that.”
“You’re a pig,” Pansy scowls, though her words hold no real bite. “I swear I don’t know who’s worse, you or that succubus that spawned you.” Pansy’s turns back to Parvati, who wears a solemn expression. “I could write her if you’d like?” Pansy offers softly, her voice gentling as she reaches across the table to place a hand over Parvati’s. “I wouldn’t mind, you know. I don’t want you to be alone.”
Draco feels his face burn. He wouldn't say miserable, thank you so. That's a bit much even from Granger.
Prompt:
"Don't like it? I know you don't like carbonated drinks."
When Malfoy refused, Harry rolled his eyes, summoning it himself.
"No," he answers without looking up. There’s ink on his fingers and dotting his cheek, a left over childhood habit of gnawing on his quills.
Weasley closed his eyes. The red hat and his red hair make for a horrible effect and Draco’s tempted to stop looking when the cap swells, a warm glow appearing to emanate from within. Along the brim of white fur, shining gold letters begin to appear. The pom at the end of the hat stands erect, and when the words NICE appeared, it pops like a Christmas cracker, filling the air with confetti and a fragrant peppermint smell.
“I’ll live,” says Harry with a groan. As if he could do anything but.
"I don’t think she’s looking to start a family, Pans, though the Goldstein name wouldn’t be a terrible match. Maybe she just wants a thrill. You know how that goes.”
Draco has just begun sharing his doubts about the cleanliness of muggle currency, when Karrey’s ears bat-like ears twitch. With a snap of his fingers, he vanishes.
“Thank you for having me,” Draco says with complete sincerity, looking at each Gryffindor in turn. He hadn’t expected to have as good a time as he did, but he won’t be as foolish as to lie about it. Draco’s eyes linger on Potter, who wears an unreadable expression. “I had a really good time.”
“That’s why you wouldn’t talk to anyone yesterday?” Pansy asks, her brows raised. “That dumb sorting hat? You were in such a foul mood when you got back from Hogsmeade, you practically radiated a stink. The first years were casting coins to see who could sit closest to you without passing out from nerves.”
His breath ghosts across Draco’s lips, making him shiver with anticipation. He feels like his whole body is on fire, waiting for Potter to touch him. Wanting to touch him just as much. Draco knows he’d only have to tilt his head to press their mouths together, to taste him. Wants to run his tongue along the seam of Potter’s lips and steal inside.
“I understand, Professor," Draco says, turning back around. "I absolutely believe Potter should have a go at it. Right after myself, seeing as I brought it up.” He stands and walks towards her desk. “And I’m right here, after all. It’ll be quick, I assure you.”
The path that leads into Hogsmeade is lined by great trees on each side, their branches heavy with snow. They arch overhead like joined hands, opening up the sky the nearer Draco gets to town. He makes a mental list of where he needs to stop:
with distaste. "She’s one of my dearest friends. Imagine how surprised I was when she mentioned you."
“He touched the hat before you put it on,” Hangingbone snaps, her face twisted in a nasty scowl. “Which wouldn’t have meant anything if you two weren’t already connected. It severed the the load. Made him take on half of it!” Spittle flies from her mouth as she becomes more agitated. “I thought I could reverse it if I made him put it on, but then
“You didn’t,” Potter says with obvious shock. Spots of color appear high in his cheeks, practically giving him away. “You might have said something to me!”
, Draco flipped to the section he knew would be there. In place of Squill & Spoon's advertisement, was a letter. An apology sent over a year ago. And along with that letter, an invitation.
“Oh.” Draco’s not quite sure what to make of that. The idea that Harry might have been talking to them about anything concerning Draco makes him nervous. “I guess that makes sense.”
And that’s a frightening thought, isn’t it? Just the
"What is it?" Theo asks with a note of concern, sitting up on the bed.
"Not embarrassed of me?" Slowly, Draco slides his hands over the ridges of Harry's chest, fists curling into his dress robes for leverage as he starts to circle his hips. "Don't pity me at all?"
Draco’s not sure why he’s disappointed. He examines the small fish between his thumb and forefinger. Better to let Lovegood go first.
back to his room to test his bed for lumps.” He emphasizes the word, hoping Potter will catch the hint so that one of them can brooch the topic. While Blaise has stopped shoving calendar pages under Draco’s nose, he doesn’t know anything about where on the spectrum Potter’s sexuality lies. He’s had his suspicions, but Draco also knows that when one is turned on, it’s easy to make whatever’s available work if your imagination is vivid enough.
Draco shakes his head. “You’re a sadist. Pansy’s much more a Witch Weekly person.” She’s also a terrible gossip. There’s no way she hasn’t not only read the article, but geminio’d several copies for the rest of their housemates to peruse.
+++++
"Are all Gryffindors so quick to stereotype?" Draco makes a nasty face. "The whole purpose of Squill & Spoon is so that we move past our assumptions of one another. But I know how you work, Potter. It’s just like you to make me your little pet case and assign house elves and who knows who else to keep an eye on me."
Boot, who looks happy to avoiding drawing out a conversation with Romilda about her latest article in the Prophet, continues to converse with Draco instead. He seems to be making a name for himself as a portrait historian after having interviewed several of the Hogwarts portraits and a rather large handful of portraits belonging to old families of magical importance. Draco finds himself genuinely interested, especially upon the discovery that one of the portraits Boot’s been trying to track down happens to currently hang in the east wing of the Manor.
Draco stands.
"Ron!" Potter laughs, smiling so wide that his teeth are on display, brilliant white and a little crooked. Draco’s alarmed to realize how endearing he finds it. "What are you doing here?"
Instead of heading back to the dungeons, Draco heads across the foyer to the Great Hall for dinner. He’s tired of feeling like he has to avoid the space and the prying eyes of his classmates every time something happens. Potter attacked
It was Thomas’ idea to go ice skating.
Now fully awake, Draco bathes and dresses. Once he’s done he gathers his things and heads into the common room in an attempt to catch up with his remaining school work, and more importantly, distract himself. A well-placed
"It’s definitely not friends," Potter warns.
"The straw?" Harry looks down at it. "I don't know what to say, it's a crazy straw. You drink through it." He sucks again to prove his point.
“It’s some arsehole spouting off. Sorry to say, but it’s bound to happen if you’re out with me. I should have warned you.” Draco runs a hand over his face, through his windswept hair. “Honestly, they’re bottom feeders with nothing better to do. It probably won’t even make the back page.”
He shuts his eyes. Somehow his wand is already in his hand and as he turns his head away, it aims itself at Ernie’s bottle.
"He says he doesn't want to see you." Opal was never one to mince words. "But. If you were to return in, let’s say, twenty minutes time, with a pumpkin pasty from that place in Diagon Alley, you may find me away from my desk. Just around the time Headland takes his midday nap."
Potter rises onto his elbow to protest and Draco silences him with the motion of his hips as he lifts them to open his fly. Draco bites his lip, feeling his heart race.
“Nothing happened,” says Weasley, stating the obvious. He crosses his arms, looking smug. “I figured he was making it up, mate. Doesn’t have anything better to do than try to pull one over on you.”
Draco holds up his hands, palms out in deference. Ugh. The things he has to do sometimes. “Believe me Potter, I wouldn’t step foot into this
A quick pat to his head assures Draco that his hair is just as artfully tousled as he intended it to be. Potter had seemed fond enough of it last night. “Bite your tongue, I look as immaculate as ever. Just because no one’s ever taught you a grooming charm.”
"I'll give you a hobby in a minute," Draco grits out.
The sight of Potter on his bed does things to Draco’s head. They’re alone in his room and suddenly it feels as if the entire atmosphere changes around them, a tension that fills the air. Draco can feel the way his body responds to the idea, the arousal that makes his prick swell in this trousers.
“Well.” Old Scrivenshaft, from behind the counter, cranes his neck. His bushy brows lower as he eyes Draco with suspicion. “You’re in good spirits.”
Mean laughter breaks out across the table as Draco ignores it. Madam Pince will swoop down on them soon enough. The thought of cancelled plans and holidays spent alone aren’t all that funny to him at the moment.
The warm feeling in Draco’s stomach dims and sinks like a stone. Potter’s giving Ernie a very cool look indeed, and despite his efforts to fight it, Draco immediately registers the irritation in his clenched fists and narrowed brows. There’s also a flash of something unexpected, but it’s gone so fast that Draco doesn’t register it. He’s focused on Ernie’s straight white teeth and his blonde hair and his smug happy pleased smile, who does he even think he is with his hands all over—
In response, Potter sucks harder, groaning around Draco's cock as he takes him deeper into his throat. He pulls off to run the flat of his tongue along the underside, to tongue at his slit. Draco sways on his feet, a throaty moan escaping him as he steadies himself against the wall with his free hand.
Harry nods. "I know you are. It's okay."
"How'd you manage to get Granger to let you off your leash for a night?" Pansy takes a delicate sip from her tea. She's charmed her lipstick so that it doesn't leave so much as a speck on the rim.
“Nothing to worry your head about, Potter. Let’s just say she has a few thoughts on the matter.”
Please tell me which Spice Girls these five are, because Hermione can not be Baby.
“Oh yeah,” Ernie lilts. “With your mum. She told me to let you know that you’re staying home for the hols, and I forgot. Sorry mate. But we’ll have a good view of Uranus from up there.”
Unfortunately breakfast is much like the first six months of their reconstruction year spent at the castle. Since the incident with the hat, everyone has been keeping their distance, including the few people that would normally keep Draco company. Further down, on the other side of the table, Ernie looks up long enough to offer a sympathetic frown before tucking back into his meal. Seated beside him, Parvati sniffs and ignores Draco completely. Apparently the indifference of a charmed magical object made him even more of a social pariah than if it’d pronounced him evil incarnate. In their eyes, the fact that the hat had misfired made Draco an unknown entity, and with the war still fresh in everyone’s memory, no one was prepared to deal with that.
I had apple pie while I wrote this, so at least I was happy.
Harry cocks his head at Draco, a crease between his brows. "Well that is where the training facility is, so I would be there."
Harry pushed himself to his feet, nodding to let Malfoy know he understood. Wandless magic always zapped his energy at the best of times, and the Siren's song, as well as Malfoy's probing, had reduced his limbs to gelatin. But there was no choice.
. I suppose he forgot.”
on the other side. I believe we’ve reached the part of the story where someone rolls the stone away.”
in an obvious attempt to discourage Hangingbone. Theo takes his usual seat near the windows, the chair closest to him already occupied by Longbottom, which forces Draco to drop into the only seat left upfront.
"I didn't think they'd let us be in the same group. Thought it'd be a conflict of interest."
Draco feels himself blush. He scowls. "Everyone doesn't move as fast as you do, Potter."
"What is it?"
After a moment’s deliberation, Professor Hangingbone presents the red cap to Weasley, who looks shocked to be picked first.
A thick, woolen scarf wrapped around her neck, Professor Hangingbone nods curtly. “I received your note. I’d like a moment alone, if I may.”
Harry looks confused. "But your sentence was only one year. I remember from the trial. How could you grow all those things?"
Draco picks up his fork. "If you already know, you shouldn't say anything at all."
"Our wands," Draco says, stifling a moan. "And Abernathy, he'll--"
He stifles a yawn. The cold stings his cheeks as he steps onto the grounds. He can only hope it will keep him awake long enough to make it through Muggle Studies.
"Mmm," Potter hums happily, and the theory quickly dismisses itself by virtue of his not being face down on the table. Relief settles in Draco's stomach, followed by a rush of warmth. Potter’s pleased moans are a thing of beauty, positively indecent. He’s tempted to let him keep going, but Potter isn’t the only one with a sweet tooth.
Instead of answering, Potter scoots to the edge of his chair, feet planted wide. “Why won’t you sit down, it feels strange talking to you while you loom over me like that.”
Draco leaps from the carriage like he's being chased. "It won't happen again."
Pansy doesn't even blink. "Darling, I told you before that I was thinking about joining this supper club. And your experience has been going so well, I figured, why not? Obviously we were going to run into each other sooner or later."
“Are you okay? You were going so fast, I thought you’d snap a dozen bones! What were you thinking?” She snaps at Potter with an accusatory glare. “You riled him up on purpose, even though Draco’s been trying so hard—“
, Harry’s going to go around conjuring cushions for everyone??”
“—to find out who is truly naughty and who is nice.” She finishes, as Draco tunes back in.
"You don't have to like it to want it." Draco clenches his fists. Another hiccup. "That’s exactly why you're still here. Because you want me and you
Twenty minutes later, after the Siren was taken away for questioning, after the muggles in the area were
“Why not use your wand?” Potter asks, pushy as ever. He doesn’t appear surprised in the slightest to see Draco cast without one, despite asking. “The new one,” he clarifies like a total berk.
"Don't make fun of him Pansy, I imagine Draco thinks himself a martyr." Theo rubs Persephone’s muzzle affectionately one final time, before leaving her to graze freely, strolling over to seat himself on the end of Pansy’s chair. "He’s finally braving the outside world. Something we’ve all had to do, mind you, without the most influential wizard in the world personally pleading on our behalf."
Malfoy to his home in the middle of the night. Especially when he looked like
"Yes, yes, you're very noble and heroic," Draco laughs, rolling his eyes. "Let's both be grateful it's not the other way around. Pansy, Blaise and Theo have been pushing me towards you for years. Now that I've finally managed it, I'll never hear the end of it."
Harry throws an arm over his eyes, gasping, and even then Draco doesn't stop, sucking and lapping until Harry has to push him away, his arm trembling.
Lips no longer moving, Malfoy spoke again, and Harry could hear his voice, clipped snatches, as if it were coming from inside him.
Maybe he won’t go on Saturday. It’s the night before Potter’s birthday, so it’s unlikely that he’d be there. On the other hand, what if he is there and Draco is not— would he take it personally? He certainly wouldn’t come looking for him, Draco scowls.
“Hey.” He gives Draco a distractingly handsome smile but Draco can hardly appreciate it. Harry narrows his eyes. “What’s wrong?”
“The only charms work you’ve planned is Anthony Goldstein,” sniffs Draco, curling his lip. “I hardly think that’s worth half a bottle of
"I know what you’re thinking."
"I've had a lot of practice."
He bites the inside of his cheek. He doesn’t want to answer with Potter next to him in case he’s overstepping his boundaries. Maybe he thinks it’s one think when Harry thinks its something else, and to find that out while receiving the third degree from his friends an idea that Draco finds beyond mortifying.
Honestly glad to push past that, even if it was necessary to the plot.
Carefully Draco slips his shoes off and puts his bag down. He’s shrunk the presents and slipped them inside for safekeeping, a cushioning charm on Blaise’s records so that they don’t bend. Draco can feel the weight of Potter’s gaze as he approaches the bed. Wipes his damp palms on his expensive slim-fit trousers. Feels his cock twitch.
Once he’s climbed the stairs and found the portrait of The Fat Lady, he braces against the wall opposite. Her eyes are round as she takes in his green and white scarf, his pale features. “Are you sure you’re in the right place, love?”
"Mr. Draco, Miss Luna." He rises, blinking his large brown eyes. "Karrey is to be taking your wands, please."
He doesn’t know where it came from. Nothing like so extreme as what happened at Scrivenshaft’s has happened since, and he’d allowed himself to think the few hours of relief meant whatever curse, hex,
Draco's quill moves so fast, his hand can barely keep up. He bends low over his work, sweeping aside the loose strands of hair that brush his cheek, and wills his arm, under threat of every deity he’s ever come across, to steady.
“I told you so,” Potter smirks, obviously in favor of lightening the mood. “I’m starting to rethink the idea of beds altogether. We ought to sleep standing up. Take a note from the vampires and get ourselves some coffins.”
"The directions for the next dinner party. Tomorrow evening. I'm to wear a riding cloak."
"A crazy straw," Draco repeats skeptically. "This is a muggle thing, isn't it."
“Hangingbone’s back,” Draco glances back towards the front of the room. He’s alarmed to find she’s staring straight at him. She looks away and he looks back at Harry, whose eyes furrow even more. “You caught that, right? Something’s off. I don’t like it.”
"Timely observation will save you from delayed revelations."
Draco concentrates on the setting sun on his face, the zip of the insects flying by. "I couldn’t stand being in that house. I suppose that was the point. Anyone would go nutty being cooped up for too long, but at that time.." he trails off, swallowing hard. "I spent all my time outside. Sunrise to sunset, even sleeping in the garden when I could get away with it. My mother has a thing for flowers. She began planting them as a way to pass the time. I started as a way to keep her company, but I started to enjoy it. We started planting topiaries. Herbs. Trees." He snorts, wistfully. "By the time we were done, we had an entire orchard."
dragged his name through the mud. Draco couldn’t begin to imagine the looks of shock he’d receive if he donned the hat and ended up on the good side of things.
"I could ask you the same, mate!" Ron glances at Draco and Pansy, his smile dimming a bit before he focuses back on Potter. Without a word Potter scoots a bit to make room for Weasley on his other side, so that Draco is forced to set directly across from him and complete their little square. A low table is set the middle of their cushions, and it produces another mimosa, an empty coffee mug, and an entire tea setting in front of Weasley, waiting for him to make his selection, though Draco suspects the uncultured glutton may partake in them all.
"It doesn’t matter. I should have expected it." Draco rummages for his clothes. "You weren’t interested in me. How could you be, the great Harry Potter, debasing himself to bed a Death Eater?"
Reaching down, Draco slips his wand from his holster and spells himself clean. Rolls his neck and feels the bones click. “Well, Potter,” Draco purrs. “I assume you can find your own way back?”
Draco stops. They’re right outside the large entrance doors but he doesn’t move to grasp them just yet. “You’re more of a freak than I realized, Potter. I’ve said a lot of cruel things to you over the years. True things, but cruel things. Now you say them back and it feels right.” Draco smiles ruefully. “You and I have always been truthful with each other. Our contempt, our anger... You remember every single thing I did and you’re still standing right here.”
“Yeah..” Harry makes a show of sorting his textbook and parchment. He lowers his voice so that only Draco can here. “She might still be cross about the hat.”
“On the contrary, I’ve hear Hangingbone’s eager to try again," says Theo. "Draco’s little misstep meant she couldn’t get a read on Potter. Holed herself up in her chambers the past two days, trying to figure out what went wrong. Personally, I suspect the whole ordeal is an attempt to get to him. Probe Potter's mind,” Theo muses. “As it were—”
"Malfoy." Ron Weasley scrunches his long nose as if something foul wafts beneath it. Draco mirrors his posture, squaring his shoulders. "Weasley."
“Oh fuck,” Potter begins to match Draco’s strokes, rolling his hips with growing urgency as Draco twists his wrists on the downstroke, rubs his thumb over the slit. He feels daring and wonton in this space of theirs, Potter’s moans spurring him on. Draco scoots back on his knees and buries his nose in the curls at the base of Potter’s cock, presses the flat of his tongue to the fine trail of hair that leads to his belly button.
“Oh I think we all know who Malfoy is referring to,” Blaise drawls, somehow both mocking and fond. “He’s only been glancing at this table every five minutes.”
Draco nods. The Abernathy's letter includes the necessary provisions. The location spells are temporarily lifted. Draco walks out onto the front lawn, takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes.
"Potter has shown up twice now. It could be a coincidence, but given your history, and who both of you are, you'd have to be naive to think so. I’ve been looking into who's behind this Supper Club, and have also asked a few people help me dig further. So just," Theo makes a face of utter disgust, "be careful."
"Ha!" Draco laughs, scornfully. "Because you were so honest about skulking around my Mind Healer's office! Making vague excuses when I ran into you! Honest,
Potter shifts awkwardly. He makes a Herculean attempt at his rock cake, but thinks better of it when the bit he manages to gnaw off, crackles like glass between his teeth. “She saved my life. Seems like the right thing to do.”
Potter nods. “You were an asshole, Malfoy. You were a coward, a bigot, and a bully, who made a lot of bad decisions that you weren’t forced into and you realize it until you were in too deep to get out.” Draco watches Potter’s eyes, green as glass, as he searches Draco’s face. “But you’ve made a lot of decisions I never expected either. Ones that cost you something. Ones you still don’t think anyone notices.”
"Do you?" Draco turns now, shouldering the wall. "Because you looked like you had an appetite a few minutes ago."
has held this long."
“She can do whatever she wants, I don’t care,” Pansy grouses. She leans back, studying Draco’s face. “And speaking of thrills, what’s going on with you and Potter? I thought you were attached at the hips and now you’re ignoring him?”
"Don't you tell me to calm down!" Draco wants to throw something. He waits when people try to soothe him out of a proper rage. "I told you there was a problem! These pointless dinners are only making things worse!"
Draco doesn't want to be late, tonight of all nights. What if Potter thinks he's scared him off? Or that Draco doesn't want to see him?
Draco hadn’t missed the way the Headmistress had looked at them as she mentioned supper, had made the all too right assumption that wherever they went, they would spending the rest of the evening together. Heat rushed to Draco’s ears and spread across his face. It would be naive to think the rumors of his relationship with Potter hadn’t spread to the faculty.
There's a strange intensity to Harry's eyes as he lifts his glass, studying Draco. "To overcoming differences."
"After you," Blaise says politely.
"Have you been, Milli?" Finnigan continues, turning towards her so there's mistake who he's addressing. "It's brilliant, though a bit rowdy after hours. I think you'd like it."
Hangingbone turns back to Weasley. “Now try to think of the last time someone said something kind that elicited a strong reaction from you. Or, the last time someone said to make you very very cross. Negative emotions are usually much easier to access,” she titters.
"Don't make fun of me, o chosen one. I'm not the one in that shirt," Draco says, nodding at Potter’s chest. "Let’s talk about your far more amusing preference for underdogs that seems to extend to your supporting the worst team in the league."
"You know, maybe this supper club is what you need," Pansy says, after a moment. "Theo's here because of his father, but I had to practically sign my life away to the DMLE for chaperoned visits. I’m positive they’re only allowing it as some kind of test."
“Please,” he answers. Draco feels he should probably warn him that Slytherins prefer their drinks strong and occasionally laced with Veritaserum. On the other hand, it’s Harry
He has to laugh.
“Never,” Potter grins, and it’s a real one now. “Now where do you want to start?”
"But you did notice" Pansy pats the bed next to her until Draco abandons his research to join her. There’s a calculating gleam in her eyes. "I know you noticed."
"Special pardon," Draco says it
Despite the fact that Potter had returned his want via the Malfoy family barrister, it hadn’t felt the same once it was back in his hands. He’d refused to use it and Narcissa refused to let him be without. There were weeks of furious silence before one of them finally broke. The connections his mother had had to exploit in order for Draco to obtain his new wand stretched quite thin. There was an air of finality about it that made it very clear those channels would not be available to the Malfoy name again.
“Don’t talk to her like that,” Potter snaps. His dark curls fall across his forehead as he whips his head around.
"I'll explain to them later, I promise." Potter buries his face in the crook of Draco's neck, running a hand down his arm to find his hand, lacing their fingers together. "But come with me."
Malfoy bites his lip. He hasn’t thought this far. Their moods seem to mirror each other accurately enough, but the things they’ve done involuntary seem a bit trickier.
the one who cast that spell and you should be glad, because it’d probably have been twice as strong had
“Is he ill?” Pansy again. She’s moved closer, the curtain bulging as her body comes into contact with the
“Actually, Professor Hangingbone,” Potter says, stepping into the aisle and walking forward with the determined, confident gait Draco knew Potter to adopt when he was set to throw himself into something. “I’d like to try that Sorting Hat, after all. I think I could use a laugh.”
"They're generated at random," Draco says, entering the conversation with forced calm. "Or so I've been told." He shoots Pansy a pointed look.
He’s grateful when the plates of hot, delicious food appears in front of them on the table. He tucks in, relieved to concentrate on something else.
“Not just any calendar.” Blaise looks around, his grin mischievous. “Nicked it from the girls when they weren’t looking. Thought it might cheer you up.” He carefully turns it so that only Draco can see when he flips the it open. December is a decidedly toned man’s torso, sat on the ground and covered in the same colorful muggles fairy from their last class. Blaise taps the page with his wand and the lights wrapped around the man’s body twinkle as he stretches suggestively. “See?”
Draco glances down, unfurling the jumper to reveal the giant R knit on the front. The tail of the ‘R’ look especially sticky, smeared white. He shrugs. “It looks better now, to be honest.”
“What is it McGonagall’s always going on about? Inter-house cooperation?” Draco agrees, grateful for Granger’s tactful assist. “If Potter’s finally come around to my glowing personality and insists on befriending me, I suppose I’ll have to be a good sport about it.”
“You’re welcome.”
A burst of laughter causes them both to look up.
Harry and Draco walk back to one of their common rooms
"For not wanting me the way I am."
“Oh come on, Malfoy!” Parvati pleads, quickly lowering her voice at the approaching
Frowning at the pies and cakes on display, the reflection of someone tall standing directly behind Draco catches his eye. He turns.
Potter jerks violently, nearly upsetting the nuts in Draco’s hand as he turns to face him.
“But you can watch if you want.”
"I never said I wasn't hungry." Potter leans in, brushes his nose against Draco's jaw. Nipping small kisses along his neck. Draco shivers, pressing against Potter's chest. "Let's go back to mine."
“Happy Christmas, Draco.”
"Mmhmm."
Draco decides it's time he take a walk around the gardens, maybe give himself a little space away from the group to focus on his thoughts. He heads towards bank of hedges and rose bushes, examining the blooms as he slowly makes his way along the grounds. His mother would love it here. The beds aren't as artfully arranged as what they've worked on at the manor, but he can still see that a lot of care has gone into the grounds. There's several species of trees and magical insects that he has yet to see anywhere near the manor, and he wonders if it's possible that the yellow rot that Longbottom has successfully helped him conquer has anything to do with the variation of creatures.
“It’s not--” Draco’s swallows his tongue. Potter’s hand is suddenly heavy and warm on his cheek,  fingers caressing his skin as Potter leans in close. Their foreheads rest against each other.
,” she indicates the hat again with obvious excitement, “is that Father Christmas’ red hat is actually a
There's a loud crack and Karrey appears with a tray of drinks, taking the mention of ice-breaking quite literally: the glasses are brimming with crushed ice and a mixture of pineapple, ginger, and lime. He reaches for his glass as it’s placed in front of him, and noting everyone doing the same, he takes a sip. The tartness bursts on his tongue, sweet and refreshing.
"Chang. Yes, Hello."
“Have you been feeling out of sorts lately?” Draco asks, getting right to the point. “Episodes? Strange mood swings?”
“It was that or hiding out in Gryffindor Tower with Potter.” Pansy stands to her feet, throwing her bushy beard over her shoulder to keep it out of her drink. “I was
Granger lips are a firm press. "There's something you have in common," she says coldly.
“It looks different than the last time I was here,” Potter murmurs, almost to himself before turning to look up at Draco. “It’s.. nice.”
“Hey, wait!” Potter dashes after him, his face writ with concern. “What did she say?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Been keeping busy, Potter?" Blaise cuts in, his posture straight as a line and the smile on his face perfectly charming. "Auror training and all that?"
"Some people don't move at all. Are all purebloods such moralists?"
Professor Hangingbone’s classroom is located on the first floor in Classroom Eleven, a room Draco briefly remembers hearing Pansy mention in passing during fifth year, when she'd taken Divination with the exiled centaur from the Forbidden Forest. Years later, the room no longer resembled a mossy forest floor now, but a classroom not unlike those Draco’s seen in images of muggle primary schools: individual wooden desks, a large green chalkboard, and impressively, a telly attached to a steel arm in one corner of the ceiling that Hangingbone has rigged to work, despite the lack of electrical wiring within the castle.
"Are you alright?"
Draco hurriedly nods again, clapping his other hand over his mouth
Draco exits the bakery and crosses the street, walking briskly back towards the Ministry. He tries to stop himself from thinking about the exchange that just took place. Why was Potter talking about him? How did his name come up and what else might he have said? It was enough to drive Draco mad if he allowed himself think on it too long. Potter was an Auror — of course news of his release would have crossed his desk. But did Potter know the terms of his sentence? The idea of it sent a hot flush of embarrassment up Draco's neck.
“I’m cumming,” Potter gasps, “I’m cumming, Draco.” His spunk splashes wetly over Draco’s fingers, covering the back of his hand to pool along his flushed skin. Draco’s mouth falls open as he catches his breath, curling the fingers of his free hand in Potter’s sheets to ground himself. It’s hard to ignore the way his name on Potter’s lips sends a jolt of heat to his belly.
They walk through the gardens in silence, coming to a small cropping of shrieking irises. They're still young, just buds. Their horns have yet to open, so the sound emanating from them is more of a hum.
“Good. Then finish up, and we’ll take Fang out to stretch ‘is legs. Grawp’ll be happy to see ‘ye too. We’ll introduce ‘im to Malfoy.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco snaps, feeling his face heat. Beside him, Potter leans forward.
Potter throws it down in disgust. “There’s nothing to deny! We’re classmates trying to move past the war. What business is it of theirs whether we spend time together or not?!” He tucks his chin into his scarf, swirling the tea in his mug with more force than strictly necessary. Potter is oddly magnificent when he broods. His strong jaw and dark features were made for it, like a modern day Heathcliff waiting for his moment.
Before Draco can say anything, Potter opens his mouth. “I know it upset you this morning, and if you really don’t want to, I won’t pressure you, but you don’t have to leave.” In the light of the fire Potter’s stare seems to grow in intensity, eyes like bottled flames. “I don’t want you to leave.”
He’s absolutely not, but Draco jerks his head anyway, squeezing his eyes shut against a guffaw. Puffs of air hit his palm, making a squelching noise that sounds suspiciously like he’s made wind. Scrivenshaft leans forward.
“Excuse m--” Potter’s lips are soft and warm when they brush against Draco’s. They’re standing an awkward angle, connected no where but their lips, and yet Draco’s brain short-circuits, caught in a full body shiver that spreads from that single point of contact, out to every part of his body. Potter tilts his head just so, applying just the right amount of pressure and Draco feels his breath hitch. He’s entirely too aware of his need, his desperation, as he moves his mouth in tandem with Potter, until they’re kissing so hard it’s almost bruising.
He inclines his head, gives her his most charming smile — the one he used to ask Pansy to the Yule Ball even when he knew he wasn’t attracted to her (or anyone with a fanny). The one that had gotten him his first kiss afterwards, hidden in the bushes, with a dark haired Drumstrang boy.
clutched in his hand.
+++++
Draco nods. He can feel it too. His magic crackles like static electricity, making the fine hair of his arms stand on end, even beneath the sleeves his turtleneck. “That’s because you haven’t done anything more productive than fix your hair in a store window.” He reaches up to pat Potter’s curls for emphasis, lingering just a little before letting go. They’re in public, after all. “It’ll never work, give up.”
"What of the other thing ...?" Romilda trails off suggestively.
"You'll have to forgive Bulstrode," he says, setting the champagne back down and pushing it away with distaste. He's not a fan of fizzy drinks. "Barely out of school and the details of her love life are already too sordid to repeat in polite company."
He turns to Draco. “I’m sorry. Really.”
“Only until Hangingbone returns.” Hermione glares at them. “She’ll be back before we leave for the holidays. Ron and I will help if we can, but I won’t hesitate to say something if it puts your lives in danger.”
An image of the two professors scrambling after the bulbous shrooms flashes unbidden in Draco’s head, and he snorts, helpless. Ernie grins back, flipping his blond hair. “Can you imagine?”
Abernathy stops a particularly enterprising apple with the tip of his boot, flicking his wand to clear the rest. Once done, his face returns to its usual stoic expression. "I'll return in a few hours time, Draco. Miss Lovegood." He nods politely and disapparates with a pop.
? But Harry can throw that off! I’ve seen him do it.” There’s a note of pride in Weasley’s voice as if it wasn’t Potter but
“Move along, Potter,” Draco sighs, suddenly as tired as he looks. “Surely you have better places to stick you nose than up my arse.”
“Cheers. I always said Potter was a man of taste,” Theo tells the room at large, only looking up a moment from the game of Exploding Snap he’s playing with Daphne Greengrass. “Just because Father Christmas has a beard the size of Greenland doesn’t mean the rest of us have to.”
"You hands look better than last time."
Draco clears his throat. Smoothes down the front of his gray jumper. “Potter.”
“What am I going to tell my parents?” Draco groans. He doesn’t know why he says the words out loud. He doesn’t even know how much he wants to tell them. He knows they’ve had their suspicions, but confirming as much is a different story altogether.
"How’s his arse?"
“Combines them?” Potter repeats, leaning up on his elbow. “You mean like together?”
Because, well, the Potter in front of him is... fit. Better than he'd been in school. Better than the last time he'd seen him, right after the mission when they'd hesitantly parted ways at the Ministry, Draco lingering at the end of the hall, too stupid to form the words with his mouth that he’d eventually forced himself to write down . Now, Potter's dark hair falls haphazardly over his forehead to cover his scar, searching Draco’s face with a vaguely impatient expression. . Draco clears his throat.
yourself for it."
"The terms of your probation say you need to have an escort should you leave the grounds," Pansy reminds them. "Are aurors accompanying you to these dinner as well? Robards hasn’t mentioned anything."
Still playing catch up!
“She’d be holding a grudge! That was ages ago!”
"You don't believe that." He can feel Potter's warm breath on his face now, the way their torso brush when Draco tries not to sway. He's too close. "It matters to me," Potter whispers, looking up at Draco from under his lashes.
Opal rolls her eyes but does as he asks, making a show of rising from her chair on tremulous knees. She slowly shuffles towards the mind healer’s office, disappearing through the oak doors. Hardly more than a couple seconds pass before she returns with much more spring in her step than when she’d left. Draco levels her with a dry look. "Really?"
"Darling," His mother sweeps into the room. She's holding a piece of parchment, her face apprehensive. "This just came for you. It has a ministry seal."
"Draco, stop."
“Imagine that,” Ginny rolls her eyes. “And here I thought my entire existence depended on what you think of me.” She turns to Draco, a hand on her hip, fiery red hair falling around her shoulders. “Harry mentioned something about you dropping by, but I didn’t think you’d be brave enough to actually do it.”
Nothing happens.
“And howlers, I suspect,” scowls Potter. His voice softens as he turns to Draco. “I’ll talk to McGonagall. See if she can have them turned back or re-routed. You should probably contact your Mother and.. warn her, I guess?”
Prompt:
"Hello, Pansy." Potter has stopped addressing Pansy by her last name quite a while back, but he was still as cautious as ever around her. It seemed to be a mutual understanding between them that only served to confuse Draco.
“Or me,” Draco adds with a sniff. “Potter’s the sort to come with a warning on a good day. Adding a crisis of sexuality to it certainly doesn’t help matters.”
Draco cuts his eyes away. It's a mistake. The back porch that leads into the garden proper falls directly into his line of sight, as does Auror Abernathy. There's a glass in his hand, no doubt something drained from Mother's favorite bottle of port. Abernathy catches Draco staring and holds his drink aloft, his expression smug.
"Draco, wait."
Amongst the gold bricks and stacks of funny green papers is a table made of glass. Three
“N-no!” Draco howls, his knees buckling. “I’m— I need to buy —hehehe!” Shaking his head, Draco reaches for the bag of goods, dragging it as he falls to the floor. Lying on his side, Draco reaches shakily into his robes, down now to hiccuping snorts, to produce his money pouch.
“If you were in my position you wouldn’t have allowed yourself to be controlled and manipulated by Riddle at least.” Draco said flatly whilst looking down at the table. “You would have let him kill you before you hurt anyone or followed his orders.”
“Oh cut the crap you two!” Harry burst out in a half annoyed half amused kind of way. “I know that Pierre is really Malfoy.”
“Well I sort of did but I didn't really believe it.” She said honestly. “I just can’t see you together, don’t you just argue all the time?” She asked with a frown.
The only thing I will promise is that the chapters WILL comes and I will never ever completely abandon this story!
Harry gave a little laugh. “Not a bloody clue to be honest! How does anyone write a book?!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco snapped back up and turned fiercely towards him. “I’m sorry, did you just say your cupboard?!”
“Potter meet Mattie. Mattie - Potter.” Malfoy said, lazily waving his hand between them.
Also, random side note, I wrote this chapter a few days ago whilst listening to James and Oliver Phelp's 'Double Trouble' podcast on Youtube where they featured a chat with Tom Felton! It was so good, my little Fred, George and Draco all together! I'd recommend checking it out!
Harry stopped what he was doing and turned to Draco with a look of surprise. “What? You serious? I thought it was just old storage down there, I’ve never looked. I was a bit afraid of what I’d find to be honest. We always saw Kreacher going in and out of that room during the war, we figured he was hiding stuff in there too that he didn’t want us to get rid of.”
Draco stood up to leave. “Not a problem, Professor, thank you for your time.”
“Thank you Harry, you look rather dapper yourself.” Daphne smiled back.
His head was still just about resting on Harry’s shoulder and Harry had tentatively put his arm round the back of the sofa again but this time slowly brought his hand down so it was resting on Draco's shoulder. It was still only a light pressure, Harry didn't quite have his arm around him but he almost did. Their body’s relaxed around each other into this natural position.
“Well there we have it ladies and gentlemen of the Wizengamot. I shall now summarise what we know of Mr. Malfoy's actions and indeed intentions. We have established that Mr. Malfoy does carry the Dark Mark but was not a follower of Lord Voldemort by choice. I shall remind you that he was underage at the time. Coerced by his father, forced and threatened by Voldemort himself and his other, more loyal, more... willing followers. His life, and the life of his mother was on the line, he did what he had to do to survive. Mr. Malfoy failed to carry out his orders in the execution of Albus Dumbledore, he lowered his wand that night and did not partake himself in any of the battles fought. In addition, when given the chance to deliver Mr. Harry Potter himself to Lord Voldemort he did not take it. I ask that you take all this into consideration when making your decision.”
“Yes Master Draco, right away. Kreacher be thinking that is a good idea sir.” Kreacher bowed to Draco and threw a bit of a dirty look to Harry.
“Yes, if you take that pile I’ll take this one.” Draco said as they each picked up a pile.
Some nice Blaise and Daphne moments here too for those of you who were worried about Daphne!
It was dinner time really but he didn’t want to rush Draco or set any rules. Draco had eaten the biscuits an hour ago anyway so maybe a later dinner was in order today. Harry thought he’d just chill in the lounge with the TV on until Draco came down. Sure enough, ten minutes later he heard movement in the stairs and then Draco’s familiar figure came round the open door into the room.
“You never had to apologise, it’s ok.” Fred said, giving Harry’s hand that he was still holding a little squeeze.
at Draco’s chest.
“Pritchard?” Draco said blinking in surprise.
“Our new room.” Draco repeated happily.
“Man, Harry, this is bloody good.” George said with his mouth half full.
Then he hesitated slightly before he gave in to his urge. “Will you show me what you do in the kitchen from now on? Doesn’t have to be every time but bits and pieces here and there would be good. I want to learn how to cook and prepare food for myself.”
Harry had greeted Daphne with a polite but friendly kiss on the cheek and had given them two VIP passes and told them to apparate ahead saying he’d meet them at the gates. Blaise held out his arm to Daphne who took it and then shortly they were gone. Harry turned to Draco as he pulled something out of his backpack.
*warning: nightmare scene here involving death. It's not graphic but just thought I'd warn for it just in case.
First they talked more about the details of the case and Lucius. Harry even explained how the engagement with Daphne had been a plan to just get Draco’s parents off his back for a while and that they’d never actually been together. Even Ron admitted that he felt sorry for Draco having to deal with that form of fatherhood. He even went as far as to say he understood a little more now why Draco had been “a right royal prat” at school.
“So you spent all your money on the business? Put that first and yourself last?” Harry asked after another silently quiet awkward moment.
“Did what?” Harry questioned looking softly into his eyes.
“But how could you…?” She started again looking at him as Draco sunk back into the chair by his desk.
“Oh I am most definitely right.” She said confidently with a smile.
Teddy was getting to that age where he could understand things a bit more and had lots of questions. Dromeda and Harry had already had a long chat with him the year before about his parents and the war and his Grandmother loved telling Teddy stories of when his mother was little. Thursday Teddy was asking Harry lots of questions about his dad so Harry told him the story of the Marauders all turning into animals again. Then Teddy demanded to hear the one where they made a magical map before bed and Teddy snuggled up with his little wolf cuddly as he fell asleep.
Draco tried to sound casual. “Yes, it’s no big deal I’ve done it for Blaise and Daphne. It’s what I’m best at, working out what scents remind me of what people and creating a unique blend of what they’d like. You saw what I did for Granger, seemed fitting to make you one too instead of the generic one you usually order from me.”
“We were only talking this morning about your shop as Andi still hasn’t seen it. We might stop by tomorrow, maybe we could come just before lunchtime and then take you out for lunch?” Narcissa suggested warmly engaging Draco back into the conversation as Dromeda continued serving the dinner.
Harry whipped round to look at him. “Of course Draco, I would never have started this with you otherwise, I mean I could have done because we were never exclusive, but that’s not me, I wouldn’t have done that. I ended things with him just over a month ago.”
In the evening they finally have time to talk about the book.
“Honestly guys it’s cool.” Harry said seriously looking between them. “The petty school boy rivalry was ages ago do you really think I’d hold onto a grudge like that?! Yeah he was a prick at school but so was I at times and then we had a fucking war! We both saved each other's lives when it mattered and even though I met him as Pierre he does seem different now.”
“Erm, yeah, I’m good actually thanks. How are you?” He asked back.
“Draco, I know Sunday kind of made things a bit awkward between us but we’ve both said sorry and explained our side of things so can we just move on now?” Harry started. “Like, we can learn from it so stuff like that won’t happen again and I think we both need to get better at expressing how we feel but otherwise let’s just pretend it never happened?” He suggested.
Draco shook his head fondly but got up to lie next to Harry anyway. “You tell anyone about this and I’ll hex your cock off.”
“Yes because apparating here takes so much time away from your busy work schedule.” Draco muttered, rolling his eyes.
“Boot and Rogers you’re coming with us to Harry’s. One of you take Mr. Zabini, the other Miss Greengrass. Collect any evidence you can, you know what to ask and Harry reckons they’ll be cooperative. If all parties agree then collect memories too so grab the vials and relevant forms for those before we leave. Harry and I will take Mr Black and Ms Black.” Ron outlined the rest of the plan and there were nods all round.
It was really nice, no tension, sexual or otherwise, no serious conversations about uncomfortable subjects, just lunch on the beach as friends. The only problem was that it was hot, very, very hot.
As he came over the last hill the Burrow came into view, because Harry had obviously been there countless times before he could see what muggles couldn’t due to the protective charms around the place. As he got nearer he could already hear the music playing in the garden and smell the BBQ food cooking. Then he heard the familiar sounds of chatter, chaos and the young girls running around and squealing. He smiled to himself as he got ready to put his thoughts away and allow himself to relax.
Harry felt good after his appointment with Pierre, it had been interesting to say the least. Even though it was mostly a professional meeting he enjoyed the way they’d interacted and there was something about the casual way they conversed together. He’d had a nice chat with Daphne, as she insisted he call her, too. She had that twinkle in her eye again and she almost seemed excited to introduce him to her boss giving Harry a mischievous smile as she left.
“... and how you treated Pansy 4th year was typical of a gay boy with a crush in denial! We all know who was suddenly getting even more attention than usual that year and for all the right reasons!” Blaise added and paused before continuing.
He sat back on the arm of the sofa and swung his legs up to rest them over Harry’s lap then relaxed into the position with an exaggerated content sigh.
“What?” She said innocently back at him catching his expression. “You need to eat more Draco and you know it so don’t look at me like that! You’re far too skinny!”
“Yes?” Draco prompted him when he didn’t carry on.
Draco stopped short of pushing the trousers of his overalls down and left the dungaree straps hanging loosely down his back as he looked at her in mild surprise.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So you are gay then?” Draco asked. “I thought you might be bisexual.”
“Good, I think I’d like some fresh air. Could you please tell her that I’m ok and that I will come to her in just a moment?”
“Good, that’s good then.” Draco said smiling broadly back. He gave Harry a playful nudge with his foot too. “So you planning on getting dressed anytime today or is it a pajama day?”
Her black tight curly hair was piled up high on top of her head poking out the top of a thick colourful scarf she had tied around her head in a ridiculously large bow. Her plain black t-shirt showed off her curves and was tucked into a bright floor length skirt that was a completely different pattern to the one on her head scarf. The two fabrics really shouldn’t go together but somehow she made them work.
His mother turned towards him and saw his smile matching it with one of her own.
Guess we'll find out soon!
Draco had stood up and held Harry for the longest time. Neither speaking, nor moving, just holding each other and providing comfort for one another in that moment. Hopefully they would always be there to give that to each other.
“Yeah I can imagine with the final coming up!” Harry said as Ginny picked up Rose and brought her into her lap.
“Didn’t catch the name sorry, but your mother was sorting out food for later with… her? I think it was female…” Leo seemed a bit bewildered. Draco wasn’t sure what sort of upbringing he’d had, in fact he really didn’t know much about him at all, but he got the impression he wasn’t used to house elves.
“Oh sorry Harry, I didn’t realise you were here.” Daphne said as Harry came into view behind Draco. “You can be darling too.” She said as he stepped forward to kiss her on the cheek too.
Draco was twitching slightly in his seat and looked a bit uncomfortable still. Harry was nervous too really, they both knew today was the day that Harry was going to tell Ron and Hermione and truthfully Harry didn’t know how it was going to go but he was doing his best to reassure himself as well as Draco.
Harry huffed from the doorway. “Well I’m going to use this pent up energy and go for a run then and when I get back I’m going to be dripping with sweat but I’m going to completely ignore you and go straight into the shower without you.”
“I understand completely Harry but I wouldn’t have worried.” Daphne said and the corner of her mouth turned up in a small sly smile. “Being caught out with you would do wonders for my dating life I’m sure! Besides, this is a very exclusive restaurant you know, being at the chef’s table is an honour I’ll be sure to tell all my friends about!”
Harry scoffed. “Yeah you could say that, with no one believeing me and treating me like a mental case. Plus Umbridge, the nightmares and occlumency lessons with Snape… yeah, it wasn’t my favourite year.”
The final battle at Hogwarts was May 1998 and this story is set in February 2006, just so you know. :)
He looked back at Harry who was carrying on cooking looking noticeably less tense but still not quite at ease. Then he turned back to his mother and hissed in a low voice. “Well I wouldn’t have to handle anything if you weren’t deliberately causing trouble.”
Without giving himself time to change his mind he called Pinky in and asked her to deliver the note to Leo to be sealed and sent. Then he went to his bathroom cabinet to get a much needed pain relief potion for his headache before remembering that he didn’t have any left. It wouldn’t take him long to brew one but he hadn’t been under ground to the potions lab yet. It would remind him too much of Severus and he hadn’t really processed his Godfather’s death. Now wasn’t the time to do that either, surely it would be fine to carry on repressing it.
Harry chuckled. “Yeh they are a bit. Pippin especially always makes me laugh.”
“Yeah, I can understand all that.” Draco said honestly. “But why are you telling me this? You think I have a problem with you being fit? Because I can tell you that I most definitely do not.”
“I will.” Draco said, giving a knowing look to Harry and then nodded at Fred. “Thanks for being here.” He said politely.
Harry seemed less suspicious of Blaise after that answer and shook his head in an amused way. “The Quibbler is usually the most accurate.” He said simply.
“I didn’t mean to scare you, I realise now that I probably shouldn’t have just turned up but I tried to floo call and you didn’t answer.” Harry rushed out quickly trying to explain himself. “And we did say we’d meet up today, I guess I just got worried which I know sounds stupid but I- er- well I don’t always think about things before I do them I guess so I just came here but if you’re busy I can go.”
“Mattie -or Mats?- is nice and you guys seem close.” Harry commented as he watched her practically bounce away to greet some more customers who had just arrived.
His mind made up, he made towards the stairs and out into the shop below. Verity was behind the counter, Harry suspected Fred was out the back making a start on the owl orders but he didn’t look for him or George. He greeted Verity politely and went out the front door into the street. He stood outside the new shop for a few moments giving it another look close up. True, it was a little bit poncy for Harry’s taste but it was also very sophisticated and really rather beautiful. He read the sign in the window about bespoke gift baskets and thought it was the perfect excuse to speak to the shopkeeper about something for Hermione. It would be nice to get something especially made for her anyway. He still couldn’t see anyone inside but it was definitely open so he placed a hand on the black wooden glass panelled door and pushed it open.
He told them what he’d seen and then how Draco had been so cross with him, how he’d broken Draco’s trust by pushing too hard and how Draco now wanted nothing to do with him. He told them how angry Draco had been and everything he said but then the worst thing was right at the end when Draco had been hurt and sad saying that this was a mistake. Then explained how he’d felt after and how he’d come here and summoned the whiskey too hard and how it had smashed.
The Malfoy white blond hair was still apparent but it was different to Harry had ever seen it. It was longer than he’d had it during the war but definitely not long enough to look like Lucius and not slicked back like he’d worn it when it was longer at school. He had a left side parting and the hair there was tucked behind his left ear, the rest of his glossy hair was effortlessly flowing down the right side of his face in a slight soft wave stopping just below his jawline.
In the end I came up with this so sorry again for the wait but hope it's worth it.
“Hmm.” Draco said. “No wonder we’re both so crap at this then.”
“This room is really nice.” Blaise said approvingly as he looked around, being the only one of the three who hadn’t yet seen it.
“Well for me family has always been the people I chose.” Harry said casually. “I know we’re not actually related, thankfully, but Draco is my family now as are Dromeda and Teddy. That makes us family too.”
When he got closer to the beach house he smiled as he heard the TV and recognised what film Harry was watching. That song
Draco was looking between them strangely but smiling slightly. “You have an odd relationship with your house elf.” He said amused.
“Hmm.” Harry said as he wasn’t quite sure what else to say. “And now?”
“Well it’s not like he’d find out.” Fred pointed out, slightly put off.
“Part of it is about healing the past, I think. If we can put aside our differences and become friends then it’s like a true measure of moving on and leaving the crap of the past behind us if that makes sense? That’s how it started anyway but now I think I might actually like the guy. He’s really different to how he was before and I honestly think if I met him now without knowing who he was then we’d probably get on well.”
“We’re both pretty fucked up with a shit ton of issues huh?” Harry said to break the tension.
“I’m here Harry.” He replied soothingly.
“Maybe that’s true.” Draco said softly. “But they followed him because they believed in him... because he has the biggest heart and the purest soul...”
Draco just laughed. “It’s fine, you’re right. It is a bit shit.”
He wouldn’t pick a fight with Potter now even if he wanted to, he had better sense than that, but he actually understood what Potter meant and really he didn’t have the energy to harbour that kind of hate anymore either. So that was his truce with Potter sorted, now for the other matter. Snape was actually going to have a funeral and they could go… if they wanted. It wasn’t really a choice though was it? He knew he’d never forgive himself if he didn’t go. Nothing for it really, he’d better go find Mother and talk it through with her. Rising to go and find her he thought maybe it was finally time to confront how he felt about the death of his old Potions Master.
“Mother” he said and before he could even think about his actions he found himself rushing over and giving her a rare hug. She welcomed him into her arms in a way he could only remember doing a couple of times and they stood there for a moment saying everything they needed to in that embrace. Finally she stepped back and looked into his eyes, once more
“I’ll buy somewhere else.” He suggested simply. “I’ll buy somewhere new for the three of us. We can arrange it all in a new name, I’ll get a separate vault and everything. Then we can set up every security measure known to man.”
They had now started work on the main family sitting room which hadn’t really been used over the past two years and was one room that Draco did actually have positive memories of as it was always the room they unwrapped the Christmas presents in. It had always been one of the brightest rooms too in a nice light blue which Narcissa was keen to keep. The curtains, however, did need updating as Aunt Bella had taken her frustrations out on them once after a rather unpleasant meeting that hadn’t gone her way. Draco had been struggling for a while to transfigure them to the exact shade of powder blue whilst his mother was effortlessly plumping up the cushions. Eventually she decided it was time to break for lunch so he gave up and made them cream instead to match the cream trim of the upholstered blue sofa. She looked over with a raised eyebrow at his failing but then must have decided that the cream looked good as she didn’t say anything.
“I knew him quite well at school. I thought he was a bit pompous at first but he’s a good guy! I don’t know your sister but I’m sure he’ll look after her.” Potter said, smiling that dashing smile again. “He works at the Ministry doesn’t he? I know at first he was helping a lot get things… erm, settled. I didn’t see him much to be fair but Hermione’s department worked with him a lot, he’s in the International Magical Office of Law right and he’s in the Wizengamot? Or at least he was… we kind of lost touch I guess…” Potter trailed off awkwardly.
Draco kissed his thighs on either side and then trailed his kisses back up Harry’s body as he scooted up the bed once more. He moved onto the bed next to Harry and laid himself on his side looking at Harry with a single hand on his chest.
The next day they had begun working again straight after breakfast and had soon established a bit of a routine. By the end of that week the greenhouse was looking quite presentable and Draco had found himself tolerating Auror Proudfoot’s company quite well. They started working on the flower beds the following week and Draco was able to revive some flowers using the spells in the book. He had started picking some of the more brightly coloured ones and putting them on his mother’s tea tray. This seemed to slowly start cheering her up and gave them something to talk about when he visited her. Slowly he started to encourage her to come out of the bedroom during the day and see the flowers for herself. Even his father looked up from his desk when he saw Narcissa up and about a bit more and gradually the atmosphere in this little house became a bit more tolerable for everyone.
“Yes.” Harry said smiling.
After that realisation Draco felt a lot better about the whole situation and gave Biscuit a friendly rub behind the ear to apologise for being temporarily mad at him before suggesting to Harry that they call it a night.
“Thank you for your concern but I will be fine. I have plenty of practise apparating after wine and I’m always in control of myself.” She said confidently.
Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing... but given you a couple of breaks!
The manor had hosted a number of Death Eaters over the past two years and most of the planning for the war had been done here. The Dark Lord himself had taken over the master suite after Lucius’s failed attempt to get the prophecy had landed him in Azkaban the first time round. Fortunately that suite was in the West Wing away from Draco’s own. The Lestranges had the next biggest suite in the West Wing which had meant his mother was forced into one of the smaller guest suites in the East Wing next to Draco’s. His father had been quietly livid about it when he got broken out of prison but he was too scared to actually voice his opinion. Everyone knew who the real master of the house was at that point.
“I don’t need a bodyguard!” Draco said instinctively with a frown.
“Well no not really, as much as I hate that term, they were worried about what it would look like to the public if I wanted to leave.” Potter said calmly.
A few more bits of background fluff thrown in for you! :D
Tried to edit it down but I like the dialogue and lots of little things I wanted to get in there.
He got out and quickly drained the bath and dried himself off not looking back at the bath, not allowing himself to think about what could have happened. Maybe baths were another thing to add to the list now. He laughed out loud at that. He actually laughed. What the bloody hell was wrong with him? Maybe he had finally lost it.
“Oh right, sorry, thanks though appreciate it.” Potter said running his hand through his hair and making it even more messy. It fell back softly when he removed his hand and was effortlessly scruffy but in such a good way. Draco almost had the urge to run his hand through it too. Merlin, what was happening here.
Draco took a step closer to him and started running his soft wet hands over his chest getting lower and lower. “You know, I don’t remember you getting off before we went to sleep.” He said casually.
“You are safe Draco.” Daphne said firmly. “You’re here with us now and we won’t ever let you be alone.”
Harry chuckled slightly before giving Draco a proper kiss on the mouth and then straightening up. “Seriously though, have fun tonight. You deserve it.” He said sincerely. “But tell Blaise he better not flirt with you either.”
“Oh, brilliant comeback Potter, really witty.” Draco snapped back smugly enjoying the banter they’d always had now that it was no longer malicious.
This week has been busy for me and my schedule it all over the place now. No Friday update this week sorry but I'll get the nect chapter out at some point over the weekend I promise. This story is still very much a priority for me!
“Yes, she didn’t sleep that well last night so I expect she’ll be out of it until dinner time now.” Hermione said unconcerned and sipping on her tea.
Draco nodded again.
“Nonsense!” Harry said cheerfully. “I like having you here, I actually hate being here by myself.”
It was nice that Narcissa and Andromeda had stepped up for both of them and they cared about Draco’s business too. Harry also told Draco that Fleur was going a bit stir crazy at home and he wondered if giving her a part time job at the shop would enable Draco to open the shop on Wednesdays now without asking Daphne to work extra hours. He was really happy with that idea and said he would talk to Fleur about it.
“Godric save me.” Harry muttered as he turned back towards the door and left the room.
Thanks so much to all you lovely lovely people for continuing to read this and sticking by me even though I've made you wait!
“Just… relax OK? I’m not going to
“His foot is healing. He can’t put any weight on it yet as it’s still a bit swollen and painful but the gash in his skin has joined together well and I don’t think it will scar.” George said simply taking the box that Harry was floating towards him and walking into the kitchen.
Harry felt Draco stiffen up slightly besides him and heard the slow inhale and exhale he took before speaking. “Thank you Mother. I don’t think that will be necessary but I appreciate it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fred...” Harry called out as the other man turned back round. “Thanks for today, you’re the best.”
He thought he’d probably save his childhood until last as that was the worst thing, the trouble was when it came to talking about the book it obviously had to be done in order and his childhood was sort of first so in a way it had to be done. Now that he thought about it though he found himself glad that they’d started with that. He’s shared the worst part of his life with Draco, the part that he never tells anyone, and their relationship has come out the other side stronger. Surely that could only be a good thing? Surely that meant the talking about the rest of it wouldn’t be so bad?
Fleur who was hovering nearby saw Teddy and recognised this emotion too. She mouthed to Harry to check he would be OK but Harry could see her already struggling with a crying baby Louis in her arms and Dominique running around her legs so he gestured to her that he would be fine but thanks.
“Doubt it.” Draco scorned. “The Ministry must be desperate without Potter, that's all, wonder why he really left…”
“I’m leaving Father. I shall no longer be living here and I don’t expect we’ll see each other again.” Draco said coldly.
Harry was very happily cooking in the kitchen having just discovered that Draco was staying here for good and not moving in with Blaise and Daphne after all. He was hoping that he would but he hadn’t brought it up with him yet because Draco had said about taking it slow, although that didn’t seem to be happening.
I realise I probably should have posted the chapters more spread out like I'd originally intended to so I had a chance to write the rest but I find it so hard to sit on a chapter once it's written! However, as I'm back to work now my life is a lot busier than it was when I started this story which unfortunately means I don't get as much time to write :(
This was obviously a dynamic they were used to and when Harry questioned it Draco admitted that he used to visit the Malfoy owlery a lot when he was younger. Apparently he would then walk round the grounds for hours with Aquila on his shoulder just chatting away to her. Draco blushed slightly in an embarrassed way as he said this, which was rather cute, but it was also painful for Harry to be reminded again just how lonely Draco’s childhood had been at times.
“You don’t understand, I don’t have time.” He said stubbornly shaking off her hand and managing to undo the second clip on his left shoulder. “If you don’t want to see me get undressed you should leave now otherwise I will do it in front of you!”
Harry spoke calmly but detached from it all as if he was telling someone else’s life. It was strange to see in a man that was usually a sea of emotions. Draco didn’t like it.
“You saw him?” Draco asked quietly, obviously already knowing the answer really. He’d known the moment Harry described the Death Eaters in the book and some of the conversations they’d had that Lucius would have been there, even if Harry didn’t name any of them.
The door opened out onto one reception room that was dark and dingy. It had a small corner kitchen and a couple of lounge furniture bits in the middle of the room. The opposite side of the room he could see an open door just showing a scruffy old bed that clearly dipped in the middle of the mattress. All the furniture looked like it had seen better days and the whole vibe was pretty depressing, it wasn’t what he expected from somewhere that Draco would live and it looked completely different from the glamorous shop downstairs. It was also so sparse, nothing personal here at all and not even any sort of entertainment. How did Draco spend his free time? He couldn’t even see any books.
“You’re spending an awfully long time looking at my outfit, is there something wrong with it?” She asked with a playful smile.
“I reckon you could really do it this year though Gin!” Ron said enthusiastically sitting on the vacant armchair. “I mean the Bats really messed up last week against the Magpies! I couldn’t believe it! But it really opened up the table. If you win on Saturday you could win the whole league! You just need to make sure that you win by-”
They ended up oven cooking fish and chips from the freezer and having them with peas done in the microwave as Harry couldn't be bothered to cook properly. Over dinner Draco told him that he’d met with Graham today in his lunch break, originally still disguised as Pierre but felt confident enough at the end to tell him who he really was. As predicted Graham really didn’t seem to care he was just grateful for a place to live and said he’d happily work three days for Draco for free in exchange.
“No bother, Mr Potter, I shall be here regardless and Daphne said you like to avoid the crowds. You can pick it up from the back entrance after closing anytime.” Draco said before he really thought about what he’d offered.
Harry sighed. “Ron, can we not? You know this discussion never ends well. I never wanted to hurt him and I don’t think I have... He understands it.”
“Er, yeah, great.” Harry replied. “Thanks so much for this, for all of this.” He said slightly awkwardly.
Fred came over to give Harry a big sloppy kiss on the cheek which he whipped off dramatically and Fred laughed just as George joined them in the kitchen.
“I’m just sick of people treating Ron like he’s some sort of useless side-kick to me, he deserves more than that. That’s what I meant. You did your part Draco, for the right side.” Potter said the last part so quietly that Draco could almost have missed it. Draco didn’t think he was breathing.
Harry hesitated but then saw the sincerity in Fred’s face and then looked at George who gave him an encouraging nod. He nodded slowly and took a deep breath. Then he told them everything, well almost everything.
Ron shook it with a smile before turning back to his professional mode facing Draco and Narcissa who had just been watching this whole exchange.
Harry took a while to arrive and Draco was pleased he’d cast a cushioning charm on the floor before he knelt down. When he did it was obvious he’d only just gotten out of bed. He was wearing blue chequered flannel pajama bottoms and a baggy grey T-shirt. He still looked quite groggy and his hair was absolutely indescribable in it’s messiness. Still though, he managed to look hot and Draco actually felt weirdly privileged to be seeing him in this natural state. He had this vision of relaxing in Harry’s home together in their pajamas or even waking up next to each other in the morning… No Draco, dangerous thoughts!
“Oh shit.” Ron said calmly.
“Alright Mr ‘I-have-a-fancy-house-but-I-never-use-it’! Even though I hate missing your workout, I like it when you do it here!” Fred teased back.
Intriguing, thought Draco. He must get a lot of offers after all, it was odd that he wasn’t married himself by now, what witch in the country wouldn’t want to be with Harry Potter?! Even if he was ugly he’d bag anyone he wanted but he definitely wasn’t ugly.
Potter laughed. “I expect Hermione might give him a run for his money, he might have to settle for being her deputy!”
Harry laughed and held up his glass. “Cheers to finding a good husband.”
“-and you know you loved it.” Fred finished with a wink.
“I’m sure first names all round would be fine with everyone here.” She said as a statement rather than a question but Blaise nodded anyway and stepped forward to come and meet Harry.
Draco took a deep breath, it was now or never. He needed to just say it with his emotionless Malfoy mask on like he’d practised.
“Dinner is at half six by the way.” He said to Harry. “Remember what I said, be yourself and challenge her back.”
“I, erm, brought breakfast.” Harry said as he noticed he’d come from Fred’s room and not his own. “How is he?” He asked gesturing towards the door George had just come from.
So the plan really did seem to be coming together. Draco said he’d organised for Graham to work Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays at the Potions shop and then he would be at the joke shop Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays with Sundays off. Fred and George had said they would probably need Graham on the Saturdays that Hogwarts students flooded into the Hogsmeade village but that could be arranged. Seeing as they’d just had one there wouldn’t be another for a while and Draco and/or Harry would just have to be in the back of the shop on those Saturdays so that Daphne wasn’t alone. Hopefully by then though the threat of Lucius Malfoy would be dealt with.
She paused for a moment before adding something else. “I think you have a lot of confusing feelings towards Harry and I think it’s because you just have all these different versions of him in your head. Maybe try to just forget everything you know, everything to feel and start again? Just get to know him as Harry like I’m doing?” She suggested tentatively.
“Huh?” had been Leo’s not-so-eloquent reply which had just further infuriated him.
“Now I’m just staying in mostly. Focusing on work, focusing on George and being there for my family and trying to figure out what I want.” Fred spoke in a normal flat kind of voice but he didn’t seem sad, just thoughtful.
Harry was looking into Fred’s small mirror trying to make his hair look even slightly better. Fred laughed at him.
All the aurors in the room were paying close attention and eager for action. Ron turned to Harry. “Which team do you want to be in?” He asked simply.
“I had wondered if you still got fan mail as I never saw any.” Draco thought out loud. “Kreacher is really a saint for putting up with you.”
“Sounds great thank you.” Draco replied before hesitating slightly. “You doing it yourself? The muggle way?”
“You were lying?” Draco asked with amusement.
“Well he says that but you know he’ll end up helping me, what else is he going to do?!” Fred said with a smile now back on his face too. “What about you? You starting your journey as an author here or you working back at yours?” He asked.
“Dramatic as ever I see.” She said with a small smile. “Was there something you wanted?”
He stepped back from her and took a deep breath. “I guess I just feel a little alone at the moment which is ridiculous because I see you almost everyday and I’m used to sleeping alone it’s just… well I thought maybe I wanted to go out and meet someone with Blaise and I just couldn’t do it. It was awful, guys coming on to me left, right and center-”
“No, trust me, he is most definitely not perfect.” Draco said, looking at the scroll now in his hands with what Draco could only assume was his own name in the slanty black scrawl. “And yes, you’re correct, his handwriting truly is atrocious, why does that not surprise me?” He said dryly.
Harry rolled his eyes. “George I think all the girls have heard that one now, might be time to find some new material!”
“Oi!” Harry chuckled. “Behave or you won’t get any!”
“It’s perfect.” Came a soft low voice that made Harry shiver.
“Go get changed then.” Draco said commandingly. “I’m giving you precisely two minutes.”
He again tried to sound casual although he wasn’t sure if he’d achieved it as successfully as before.
“The Potters are descended from the Peverells.” He said simply.
He wasn’t quite sure how much he could get Graham to do at the shop to fill three days. There was plenty of work that wasn’t the problem, the problem for Draco would be delegating and letting go of control in a few areas. Hopefully the man was good with potions and Draco could trust him to do some of the most basic brewing in the cellar downstairs whilst he did the complicated stuff at Grimmauld. It would take a while for Draco to trust him completely but he’d start him off small and test everything he made before he’d allow it to be sold and then take it from there. At least he knew from George that Graham could do stock checks and accounts well enough. Draco hated those, they were boring so having someone manage the paperwork might be nice. He had to admit getting some help would be good as his workload was piling up. Then he would have some time to work on the book with Harry.
Watching Harry treat this place like it’s his home, Draco thought it was no wonder Harry had made himself at home at Draco’s place. Clearly this was how his friendships usually operated.
Fred shrugged. “Yeah, that’s fair!” he said as George was dishing up two portions.
Pinky was standing by the table beaming at him. This hadn’t gone unnoticed by his Mother who looked over at the house elf with a raised eyebrow.
Poor Draco :(
But he didn’t just speak, he jumped off the bed as quick as he could and rounded on Harry. He didn’t shout, he was too stunned at what had happened to shout, but when his voice came out it was a low threatening voice that even he was scared of.
He kept the shop stocked up, he didn’t want his customers to notice anything different but he moved all his spare stock from the storeroom to Grimmauld Place in case the shop front got ransacked, then at least he’d have some products left. He would have to still be here on Tuesdays and Thursdays of course to meet with clients but he was hoping he could work the rest of the week from Harry’s. The man was right, he would be safer at Grimmauld Place and Draco had to admit the prospect of brewing safely at Harry’s appealed to him much more than being here. He no longer felt safe here and that was a big thing for him. He no longer felt safe at Blaise’s or Daphne’s, the only place he felt safe was at Harry’s house. Also, with Harry at his side it was even better.
“Harry? You know people usually wait until after work to come and raid our alcohol cupboard!” Fred said with a half smile but then when Harry looked up and made eye contact with him Fred’s face turned slightly more serious.
Lucius turned quickly to face her but Draco shot a stunner at his back before he could even think about it. His mother shot him a quick look of gratitude and relief.
Another nice long one for you and I've been writing all weekend as I was just so excited to get this chapter out!
“Of course,” Harry said quickly. “You’re always my first thought.” He smiled sweetly at Draco and then his face shifted slightly and he looked a bit guilty once again. “There is one other thing though…”
“Why wouldn’t I?” He said casually.
Harry woke up on Sunday feeling the most content he’d been in a long time. Things since Draco randomly floo called him and then came round his house had been good. Well, things were still a little confusing and intense but also… good, hopeful. Last night had been really good too, fun and relaxing after Wednesday and things between him and Draco had definitely gotten a little flirty a few times, something that Blaise had only encouraged. Was Blaise trying to set them up? Did that mean that Draco had told Blaise he fancied Harry? He hoped so.
“Nothing to apologise for Harry, I’m enjoying myself immensely already.” Daphne said with a twinkle in her eye as she picked up her wine glass and took a delicate sip.
Draco took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure how to answer that question but the issue had been in his mind ever since he saw that annoyingly adorable photo of a toddler looking just like a mini Harry. He knew that it was still incredibly early days but when Draco formed a plan he always thought of every tiny last detail. The plan of dating Harry Potter involved knowing if the man wanted marriage and children and whatever the answer Draco needed to know himself what he’d think of any given scenario. He knew he wanted Harry, but did he want what Harry wanted?
Oh and some flirting... did I mention the flirting?!
He allowed himself a little half smile as he sat up straight to deliver his final line. “So I think the position I’m currently at is, if I found the right man to be by my side then I would consider it. If it was what he wanted of course but it wouldn’t be a deal breaker for me if he didn’t.”
Ginny floo him at home an hour later and they had a really nice chat. Charlie wrote back too and invited him over to the reserve where he also lived in the morning. Harry had visited the reserve a couple of times before but not for ages and he had a great time. He always loved seeing the dragons, they were so special and the welsh greens were particularly beautiful. They walked around the reserve and had a great chat, Charlie was always good company and was easy going like the other Weasleys.
Draco turned to address Harry again with a tiny flicker of a smile in his expression. “It’s our code, I set it up right at the beginning. Green means it’s safe. She’s telling us she’s OK.”
He sighed and then spoke painly keeping his voice emotionless at first. “I would be lying if I said I felt completely comfortable with people knowing, not because I’m ashamed of it or anything, far from it actually there is part of me that wants to yell from the rooftops that I kissed Harry Potter-” Then he paused to smile slightly at Harry.
“I think it will, I want to read it when it’s done and I’m always here if you want to talk through anything but I understand why you couldn’t say things before.” Fred said putting his hand on Harry’s leg under the duvet in comfort.
What Draco doesn’t expect, entirely too conscious of Potter standing at his side.  is the next paragraph. The one not only encouraging his newfound relationship with Potter, but instructing him to take advantage of the situation. What an advantageous union their friendship could be for the Malfoy name, and the use it could be to them were it to develop naturally into something more.
“Draco! What the bloody fuck!?”
Pansy leans in, whispering under her breath. "I think there's someone who wants to proposition you first."
“I have never been more grateful to know a freak like you,” Draco says, returning Harry’s smile with a rueful one of his own. “It almost makes me glad sixth year happened. Almost!” He hurries to add when Harry opens his mouth.
+++++
Draco checks his shoulder, brushing for the hairs he can’t see, before her words register. "A pogrebin?"
“Hello..” says Draco, slowly. He offers the nuts with a raised eyebrow. A little girl races past them on the sidewalk, chasing a small crup who’s gotten off its leash.
Draco huffs a small laugh. He knew Potter would follow him. He was counting on it.
Draco scowled. "You don't say."
"Karrey is not allowed to visit Malfoy Manor without express permission. He is the one asking the auror to let Mr. Draco come."
Prompt:
"You asked?" Draco vaguely registers that they're heading towards the corridor that leads down to the seventh-floor. He stops short. "Where are we going?"
“I'll keep waiting, then.” Draco digs into his bag for one of his new peacock quills. He’s still debating whether to give the other to Parvati as an apology, or wait until they’re closer to the holidays so it will double more as a thoughtful gift than a guilty regret.
Entrees done, Draco's plate promptly vanishes, the tablecloth as immaculate as when he'd first sat down. Wiping his fingers on the heated towel Karrey offers him, Draco selects a slice of cake for afters. Harry declines, seemingly content to nurse his cup of tea-- a decision Draco both tries, and fails, to reconcile with after years spent observing Potter's developing treacle habit. That is, until the cake arrives. It's chocolate: moist and decadent, creamy mousse sandwiched between two layers, topped with a chocolate ganache. Exactly the kind Draco would consume without a second thought.
"Of course my dear," Blaise says smoothly, and it doesn't sound as even half as patronizing as it should. "Right after we straighten Draco out."
The shops hum with activity this close to Christmas, shoppers bustling from store to store with their bags floating before them, boughs of holly draped around their shoulders, drinking warmed bottles of butterbeer, children enchanting sparkling bobbles to dance in the air before them as they eat peppermint flavored ice creams. Draco pays a merchant for a rolled newspaper full of roasted chestnuts sprinkled with salt and cinnamon and drizzled with honey. He’ll knows for a fact that Potter’s sweet tooth is as bad as his own, and figures they can share the snack between them.
"Mr. Malfoy," she seethes through clenched teeth. "I don’t believe you have an appointment now."
"That we coordinate our outfits." Draco indicates his own emerald dress robes, flecked with silver. "I knew you were obsessed with me, Potter, but if overcoming our differences requires a matching wardrobe, I'll pass. Solidarity only extends so far..."
"I didn’t ask anyone to put me there! Least of all you!"
“It’s not working.”
“But she’s bringing the hat?” Draco leaps down from the alcove’s raised bench to shrug his robes back on, hurriedly threading one arm, then the other through the sleeves while grabbing for his bag.
Harry comes to a stop and Draco stops besides him. Stars are already winking into existence, faint in the orange-blue haze as the sun disappears beyond the horizon. Harry laughs.
,’ out before he’s fast asleep.
Prompt:
He wills himself to think pleasant thoughts, but the memories are fleeting. Instead, negative thoughts crash over him like waves. The terror of it all makes him tremble, tempt him into occlusion -- just the way Snape had taught him when he was still alive, robes swirling as he bade Draco to try again, and again.
Draco flushes from the base of his neck to the tip of his ears. Was he imagining it or was Potter flirting with him? “That not possible,” Draco leans forward so that a lock of pale hair fall into his eyes. He bites his lip. “The Headmistress bought all the mattresses wholesale for a reduced price.”
“Your mattress?” Draco fights to keep his voice steady as he feels his own face heat. “You said mine was nicer, but I have yet to compare the two.”
Drawn by the noise, Potter’s gaze meets Draco’s and then darts away as a reedy voice fills the air.
He's pointing towards the fountain, where a small set of tall circular tables have been set up. The house elves present are serving finger foods from small trays held above their heads, despite Granger's protest. Next to her stands–
“What are we looking at,” Draco whispers, bumping his shoulder against Potter’s as he joins him in front of the window.
Weasley shakes his head and pats the cushion beside him. “You’re going to need one of these.”
Draco felt his jaw clench. “Quite.”
“Then spend the hols with Harry. He has a place to himself, doesn’t he?” Ernie bites at a hangnail on his pinky as Draco makes a face. “I don’t mean for
A brief glimpse of something like recognition flits across Potter’s face, quickly replaced by annoyance. “I think that’s more your thing, Malfoy.”
Draco feels the tell-tale muscle in his jaw, twitch. “You know me,” he drawls. “I’m just full of surprises.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t dream of it, Malfoy,” Potter give him cheeky grin. “I may not leave at all. Your bed’s much more comfortable than mine.”
"I've been talking to quite a lot of people. Theo, sure. Ran into Finnigan at the bar and he had some pleasant words to say about you, not that he remembers much about the night. My connections in Headland's office Geminio'd some files that made for a very interesting nighttime read."
"Who?" Draco wrinkles his nose, reaching for the linen napkin in front of him and draping it across his lap.
Granger is in her element as they trudge into the snow, she and Longbottom leading them all towards the part of the forest where the best Evergreens are known to grow. Draco idly listens to their discussion of needle fullness and branch quality, until his mind begins to wander. He thinks back on the last few days, still trying to nail down what’s been so strange about them.
Headmistress McGonagall wastes no time calling Draco and Harry into her office as soon as they set foot back into the castle. She’s made efforts to get rid of the owls, as well as the howlers and fan mail that regularly comes for Potter, even before the revelation that he’s been spending time with Draco Malfoy. Unfortunately, some still managed to slip through and she warns them that they should prepare themselves both physically and mentally for what’s to follow. She’s very vague about the revelation and her thoughts on it herself, which Draco is grateful for. She does warn them that they should limit their fraternization within the castle walls, but she also understands that they’re healthy, young, men who have urges (which makes Draco want to melt into the floor), and that they whatever they do they should be safe.
"What do you mean, worse?? Everyone I've spoken to only has positive things to say about you!"
“Shall I start with the Sorting Hat and work my way up to how lumpy your mattress is?”
Draco hurriedly stuffs the letter into his coat pocket with the ring, lengthening his strides as he heads back towards the castle.
Odd, Draco thinks, that it's not Snape’s words nor his father’s, but Remus Lupin's that choose to haunt him in moments like these.
"Just curious about your definition of good company."
"You know," says Romilda, "I should’ve known you had a thing for Wizards when you failed to invite me to the Slug Club."
Draco would much rather ignore the situation entirely. The idea that he has any kind of connection to Potter, especially after how miserable they’ve been making each other lately, feels like the icing on top of a perfectly
The light is faint down here, just a few torches set into the walls. Their flames reflect on the dark water and cast strange shadows across her face. Still, Draco can see that’s she’s still drawn and pale compared to how healthy she’d looked earlier in the term, so enthused about her lessons and Christmas traditions.
Instead of answering, Potter grips his wand and points it at him. Draco feels the warm pulse of Potter’s magic, shivering involuntarily as it slides like a caress down his back, spreads radial heat through his groin. Behind him, the bookshelf ripples until the engraved lettering of each book shines golden and pristine.
"Want to mold me into your image, Harry? Fuck the pureblood out of me?" Draco presses his lips to Harry's ear. "Every mad thought? Every cruel word I've ever said?"
Hagrid tactfully chooses to address Draco. “Yeah. Wrote to us a few times to see how Grawp and me were makin’ out. Mentioned a few things.” He takes a swig of his tea as Draco waits impatiently. “Always suspected there mighta been something more under the surface.”
"We should be going." Abernathy steps forward, the authoritative tone of his voice, brooking no room for argument.
Draco licks his lips. Lets out a shaky breath. “Yeah, me too.”
It just doesn’t make any sense.
Potter shrugs. The moment brings attention to his coat, which is frayed a bit at the seams on his shoulder. Draco unholsters his wand and taps it to the threads so that they neatly stitch themselves together. “I’m happy with anything, really. Lately I’ve been thinking it might be nice to go away somewhere.”
Ernie shrugs. “No one knows. It basically disintegrated on top of Harry’s head. Hangingbone suspects it has something to do with his magic signature. He got upset and it went haywire. No one’s seen him since.”
"And yet, here we are." Draco uncrosses his arm and sits up, so that he can level Potter with a serious look. He allows for a dramatic pause. Potter’s eyes are terribly green. "Do you have something to do with this? Are you keeping an eye on me too?"
Potter grabs Weasley by the back of his hideous ‘R’ jumper and lowers him down onto the cushions he’s suddenly transfigured out of marshmallows. He tucks one cushion behind Weasley’s back as another slips itself under his feet and onto his lap, propping him up until there are so many pillows surrounding Weasley, he looks like a ginger-haired snowman.
"And you'd know what appeals to Potter, would you?"
Potter’s face softens. He takes one and pops it into his mouth. “Sorry,” he shoots Draco a grateful look as he takes a few more. “I’ve forgotten what it’s like when Hogsmeade gets busy like this. I’ve been kind of on edge.”
Draco turns towards Theo who was sprawled across his bed, furiously scratching at a bit of parchment. "Are you expecting an owl from anyone?"
Instantly there’s a feeling of euphoria. A thrill rushes down Draco’s spine and zips back up.
he’d be under was ending. Out of the corner of his eye, as the chortling subsides, something pulls Draco eye to the other end of the table. Potter is laughing too, Weasley gesturing with his hands. He smiles, and as he does, Draco feels a flutter of warm content in his belly.
"My teeth," Malfoy smirked and exposed the objects in question. "I use whitening strips. I even have a muggle dentist I see twice a year, thanks to Granger." He moved to stand in front of Harry, colorless eyes impish under pale lashes. "But if you're curious about the rest.."
,” he uses air quotes around the word, “the other feels compelled to do the opposite.”
Draco stills, heart thumping. He turns to Blaise. "He told you?!"
"No, you don’t."
Unfortunately, Draco can’t say the same for himself.
"Nothing that I blame you for. " Blaise glances around the room, perching himself on the edge of Draco’s abandoned chair. "Potter has nothing to do with the two of you running into each other all the time."
“Just as insufferable as always! I should have known.” Potter isn’t the only one with a trick up his sleeve. Draco picked up Potter’s abandoned butter beer from the bench and with a jerk of his arm, splashes it in his overbearing face.
“We are under a lake, you know.” Draco casts a warming charm anyway, and does not mention Potter’s casual use of four-syllable words. “I suppose you think the Hufflepuff common room is like being buried alive, or an earth worm, crawling about.”
An owl prods its sharp little talons against the glass outside Draco's window on the Friday before his next dinner. It was unusual, as most of the owls sent to the manor followed the procedure of dropping their items to the front door where a house elf would receive them properly. The fact that the owl came personally to Draco meant that it was under special instruction and was quite secretive.
"You ought to come out with us sometime, then. Bring Blaise and Pansy, we'll make a night of it. You too Harry, now that you've rid yourself of that last bloke. What a knob he was. No offense," Finnigan adds quickly, looking sheepish.
Potter blinks, both eyebrows raised. “That’s. Different.”
He shakes his head. “I just wanted to say, that makes three times I’ve saved your life now.”
Eventually a small girl, whose tie identifies her as a second-year, climbs through the portrait hole, and Draco glimpses a shocking amount of fairy lights and tinsel, inside. She starts, when she sees him, still holding the door open.
“What’s so funny?” Harry asks, his voice warm with affection.
rendered useless as she shrieked with rage.
Prompt:
“You talk a big game now Potter, but you’ve never seen me tie a proper bow.”
Now, as Potter enters the Hall, his messy hair tumbled in every direction and his robes rumpled, Draco’s not so sure.
"That doesn't mean I want to kiss him or anything, though. He's not as handsome as you."
Potter wears an expression that clearly states he remembers his last experience with Romilda and her drinks. He feels something akin to satisfaction watching Potter lean away from her. "I think they’ve got it right.. Never know what someone might be up to."
Draco can feel the anchor of sleep pulling him down, down. There’s something about a hard won happiness that works as strong as a sleeping draught. Giving in, Draco nods, his eyes closed. Even Christmas Eve with a gaggle of redheads doesn’t seem as daunting. Idly he wonders when Harry’s mattress became so soft. “Yes,” Draco sighs happily and doesn’t even get the
Draco snaps to attention following the direction of the voice. Strange lighting makes his vision swim, and Draco blinks rapidly, shielding his eyes until they can adjust. The light recedes to reveal Luna Lovegood staring back at him, her moony eyes wide with concern. Abernathy, all but forgotten, appears at her side looking entirely too amused by his display for Draco’s liking.
Prompt:
He shakes his head. "I do. We were both awful to each other. I didn't know any better. A lot was happening." Harry chokes out a laugh, but there's no amusement to it. "Besides, we didn't we just hate each other. We hated each other's beliefs, families, friends... you wouldn't believe the amount of times Hermione had to talk Ron and I down."
“Malfoy...”
“Who’s for more tea?” shouts Hagrid with forced cheer. He doesn’t wait for either of them to answer as he tops off their mugs and piles more cakes onto their plates. “I’m startin’ to understand what Hermione was on about. The two of ye’ bicker like ye’ been together for years.”
Malfoy had very white teeth. Harry imagines he used all sorts of whitening and freshening charms morning to evening to keep them so pristine. If he were to kiss him now, to slide his own tongue alongside Malfoy's, into the wet heat of his waiting mouth, Harry thinks the experience would be pleasant. He'd be able to swallow Malfoy's moans as they tasted each other, feel his body tremble in all the places where their bodies aligned. He'd brush his fingers along the line of Malfoy's throat, tight as a bow. Drift over his Adam's apple just so to feel his pulse jump as Harry's fingers threaded into the soft hair at the nape of Malfoy's neck, angling him to deepen the kiss, to sink into--
"Like your newfound love of pizza?" Pansy turns onto her side. "Or the fact that you’ve failed to mention the most interesting part of your night?"
"The odds aren't so bad. I've survived two so far."
Prompt:
"Don’t you?" he asks, pointedly.
?’ Others have been asking you see, and I’d like to have an official statement prepared.” Blaise continues to give them his most charming smile, but Draco can hear the seriousness that underlies his words.
"Well of course I did." Pansy turns another page of
“It was, a bit.” Draco instantly realizes his mistake. Blaise’s eyes flash, and in that moment the target of his vitriol switches.
Relieved, Draco allows the others to continue discussing their plans and attempts to slip back to the relative safety of his essay. He’s determined to avoid the topic of Christmas altogether and Parvati’s hapless reminder leaves something sour in his chest.
Stretching his arm, Ernie attempts to pass the cap, dropping it as another coughing fit overtakes him. Potter kneels and picks it up instead, shaking it free of snow as he wordlessly hands it to him.
“Good.” Draco sits up and folds his legs under him. “Our magic acts up when we’re together but the effects of the curse weaken. If we work at it, we can keep each other from going off the skid. It’s when we’re apart that the effects of the curse increase.” After a pause, Draco shares with them what happened to him in Hogsmeade, as well as his interactions with his friends. Surprisingly, Potter also shares an embarrassing episode about a dramatic outburst that resulted in Seamus wearing a giant bowl full of pudding, and scaring off a parliament of owls after sobbing in The Owlery.
We just feel the other’s mood?” He looks to Draco, who shrugs, playing his best at nonchalance while his heart pounds in his chest.
“You’re still young, but you’ll never hafta stop makin’ grown up decisions. What’s right and wrong fer you. An’ I know you’re trying, Malfoy. Harry’s a good judge of character.” He smiles fondly at Potter and there’s so much love in his eyes, Draco feels like he hasn’t earned the right to see it.
Lately it feels like he can’t tell if any of his feelings or subsequent moods are his own. After fleeing the stationary store, Draco hadn’t bothered to make any of his other stops except
Potter pulls out the chair next to Draco and drops into it without so much as a glance towards the place card. "We meet again."
He ignores this and picks up his wand. “Fine. What should I do?”
“I haven’t the vaguest idea what you’re on about.” The Mercury quill happily makes ribbons of his Runes essay in an attempt to cross several ’Ts’ at once. “You must think I’m desperate.”
“Sex is a grey area, Malfoy. Think about it: it can be naughty and it can be nice all at once. It’s a way for people to communicate physically. It’s enjoyable?” Potter lists his points with growing fervor. “It could be a way to curb the need for satisfaction we feel when the curse flairs up!”
The air around Draco shivers and the room fades, the foyer’s marble floor dropping away from beneath his feet. The familiar jolt of apparition wraps around his middle, and he clenches his eyes shut, pops of color flashing in the darkness behind his lids. Then it's over, and Draco’s body comes down. Hard.
The elf is back in a flash, and again, Draco tries to elbow Potter out of the way and take the bottles for himself. At least if he hands it to Ernie, the curse may misconstrue the action and credit it to him. But as usual, Potter’s reflexes are quick, and when Draco move left, he moves right, handing Ernie the uncapped bottle of warm, frothy, liquid over Draco’s head.
Harry enters the kitchen, a copy of
Scrivenshaft stands behind him, bent over his cane as his eyes dart to the pockets of Draco’s robes. He fights not to roll his eyes. Three years ago his father would have purchased this entire store if Draco asked, and used the space to store his dress shoes. It would be nothing to give this older wizard a dressing down to which he would never recover and, for a moment, he misses being the Draco who had the freedom to do so.
Hands trembling, Draco grabs one at random and leafs through it, eyes moving unseeingly over the page.
“But I’d make an excellent keeper. All I’d have to do is stay in one place and handle the balls.”
“I know,” Potter interrupts. He has the grace to look ashamed of himself. “I know. It was a shitty thing to do.”
“And how about you, Draco?” Blaise asks, as if he and everyone else at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Misery couldn’t already guess. “Any plans yet? I hear traveling alone can be quite rewarding. Sailing, perhaps. There’s one island in particular I know you’d just
Headland spells the jellybeans into his wastebasket. "Of course it is, Draco," he says, exasperated. "Anyone can be nasty. it doesn't require any effort, just ignorance."
“Let me try something,” he says, instead. Draco grabs the needle and thread from Weasley’s slackened hands. Fingers the needle with a moment’s consideration but doesn’t give himself too much time to deliberate before he spears Weasley’s behind.
Gathering his courage, Draco stares up at the plaster ceiling. "Harry," he murmurs into the dimly lit room.
“So,” Granger begins, doing a terrible job at faking her casual tone. “You and Harry are… getting along?”
Draco lifts a brow. If Millicent's surprised to be addressed so casually by a Gryffindor he's fairly certain she's never exchanged more than a sneer from across the great hall with, it doesn't show. Perhaps, Draco considers, true reticence shines brightest in the company of the socially reckless.
The Siren had gnawed through the tape, her blunt square teeth now sharp as daggers, the
Feeling overcome, he shifts his attention back to Mr. December and his shiny red bulge. Draco folds the image over, pressing one sharp crease, then another. “What happened to the hat?”
He pushes it towards Potter.
“I thought it might be better to discuss your situation somewhere others wouldn’t overhear. You’ve been the topic of conversation long enough, wouldn’t you say?”
The blood seems to drain completely from his body. Draco feels hallow. Has to swallow thickly. “Your. Your sister.. she taught..”
Harry rolls onto his side and brings his hand to his mouth. Slowly, he licks Draco's come from his fingers, and it’s so hot that Draco feels his cock give a weak twitch of interest. If he had his way he would do it. Draco wants to push Harry down and rut inside him, bury his cock into his arse until they both black out. But for now, he settles with kissing Harry hungrily, the taste of his come still on Harry's lips.
suggest otherwise,” Draco spits, trembling with rage. “I may not be in Azkaban, but I am
"Draco!" Potter steps back, his face rapidly turning pink.
On Sunday Morning in the Village of Hogsmeade, witnesses report that young hero and defeater of Voldemort, Harry James Potter, was seen Christmas shopping with none other than son of convicted Death Eater and heir to the Malfoy fortune, Draco Malfoy. According to witnesses, the two appeared to be very close, canoodling shamelessly and engaging in all sorts of public displays that are too graphic in nature to be reported at this time.
been know to laugh at his own expense.
Abernathy is late. Draco paces the foyer, stopping every few turns to pull a curtain aside and gazing out into the darkness. The invitation that arrived for tonight's dinner, Draco's fourth, advises he dress for bed. It's a bit strange, but Draco has learned to go along with it. He pulls the sash of his silver robe tighter, letting the curtain fall back into place.
Draco rolls his eyes at the comment, and almost misses the way Lovegood shakes her head. "Ron's your best friend, Harry. They can’t place you together all the time. The point is to get to know new people."
Apparently muggles have fairy lights too, but he finds the name wildly misleading. There are no actual fairies involved like he’s used to, but multi-colored bulbs that blink, powered by something called electricity. Draco’s not sure how Professor Hangingbone’s managed to make any of it work at Hogwarts, but he suspects complicated charms work is involved.
“That’s it.” Draco rolls his hips again, lifting off slightly to relish the delicious burn. His cock, damp with lube and pre-cum, slides along the clenched ridges of Harry’s stomach. He feels the way Harry’s thighs flex beneath Draco’s own as he brings his hips off the bed, the way Harry huffs, trying not to cry out as Draco takes him deeper. “Split me wide with that prick of yours.”
"Indeed." Blaise smiles into his glass.
"Has he?" Draco takes his mother’s hands in his own, smoothening his thumb over the delicate ridge of her knuckles. When her eyes soften, he can’t resist giving her hands a gentle squeeze. "Are you sure that's a good idea? The two of you have only been on speaking terms for a few weeks."
"He's exaggerating. As usual." Draco rolls his eyes. "Pansy says she saw you having lunch with some mystery man just this week."
“I’ll thank you not to threaten me, Weasley. I’m quite comfortable, even if your common room is as hot as a Ridgeback’s arsehole.” Draco pulls at his collar. “Do something nice. That’s what the hat was about right? Trying to sort us as one or the other.”
"Laying low is a polite way to phrase wizarding pariah."
Potter still has his back to him, prattling on about some nonsense like an utter ponce. As Draco can't hex the prat anyway, he pulls his wand from his robes and deposits it carefully into the box. He gives Karrey a hard
Draco opens the latch and the small brown owl flew in, landing on his bureau and holds its leg out expectantly. Draco takes the small roll and unfurls it, his eyes moving rapidly across the page.
"Right now?" Potter asks incredulously.
Potter sheds his coat and hands it off to Karrey with a grateful nod. He starts to remove his gloves, (GLOVES, Draco thinks, in a daze), but seems to thinks better of it, and keeps them on. "Neville, I didn’t know you’d--" Potter falters, surprise in his voice as well as his face glancing at Draco. "Er, training ran over."
“Then, err,” Potter frowns. “What are we supposed to do about it?”
Potter stops at a four poster with drawn curtains and Draco wants to laugh - their beds were both in the far corner of their respective rooms. No wonder Potter was able to pick his out with such certainty.
"You don't seem surprised to see me here."
Prompt:
Draco knows better than to answer. He thinks. He could go for his wand, still holstered on his thigh. But he’s fresh off of parole and the Ministry wouldn’t hesitate to spin the situation to suit their narrative. They’re were already mad enough that unlike his father, Draco escaped Azkaban. Had not only Harry, but Lovegood take the stand at his trial — no, stunning a Hogwarts Professor would not reflect well. He thinks he hears scurrying, but mice are prevalent in this area of the castle, so near to the Owlery, and he puts it out of his mind. He needs to stall for time. “Why me?”
I were to decide anything, it wouldn’t concern you, Ern.”
Draco’s throat constricts, his voice tight. "Does it matter? Potter and I are barely acquaintances at this point. Thank Merlin the damn dinner guests rotate each time." He sighs. "I know Potter never wrote back because he doesn't want anything to do with me. And I refuse to embarrass myself again."
, a voice in Draco’s head clarified.
Potter has the nerve to laugh, and it sends warmth through Draco’s chest. “Ravish? Now who sounds like a prude. I’m much more concerned where your lot hides the bodies.”
That night, Draco has a strange dream. He’s seated in the Great Hall, a golden plate placed on the long table before him. Draco swallows mouthful after mouthful of coal until his mouth turns black. He can’t stop, even as tears prick the corners of his eyes and stream down his face. Out of the darkness, Potter appears before him, dancing in nothing but Father Christmas’ well-placed red hat and urgently shouting something Draco can’t hear. Potter’s eyes become increasingly panicked as he reaches out, but it’s too late and Draco can’t, he can’t..
Just because they share the sentiment doesn’t mean Draco has to tell him as much. “So no cause of the week? You’re usually self-righteous about something.”
"Good." Malfoy's eyes lingered on Harry's face, his mouth, a moment too long, then skittered away. "It's two a.m. and I'd much rather be in bed than subduing your murderous neighbor. Forgive me for trying to speed things along."
“We were the only two who weren’t...” Potter says, his eyes darting back and forth as the words sink in.
right.”
“Yes. Alright.” Draco purses his lips. He wants to ask why Potter is being so forward, but figures now is not the time to push his luck. He’s trying to get along with Potter, be something close to friends, even if it’s just for appearances. Draco rises from the table. “I’ll come by later. And I expect hot chocolate.”
All heads turn towards the back of the room to Potter, who focuses his scathing look on Draco alone. It sends a delicious thrill of malice through him. There was something so disingenuous about
Draco’s fingers slide under his shirt to stroke the hard muscle of Potter’s stomach that clenches at his touch, breathless when Potter pulls him down on top of him. Draco straddles Potter’s leg, ruts his hip so that Potter can feel the swell of his prick, hard and insistent against his thigh.
Maybe he can still get what he wants.
"The almost sounds like a compliment, Zabini. Don't tell me you're going soft."
In actuality they’re too exhausted to allow for much more than furtive touches and slow, deep kisses up to their necks in the warm, soapy water of the Prefect’s bath. It doesn’t stop Draco from feeling contentment sink into his bones, the solid weight of Harry’s arms around his waist as their lips meet over and over, making Draco feel as light as a feather.
“Oh yeah!” Potter jumps to his feet as Weasley sputters. “I almost forgot! I’ll be right back.” Draco watches as Potter climbs through the Portrait Hole as if he’s being chased. When he turns back, both Weasleys and Granger are staring him in various states of curiosity and discomfort.
"Careful. I should have warned you, they're a bit strong. I don't know what it is about house, elves but they have a much stronger tolerance than the rest of us."
Secretly he fears that after all this time, he might actually be losing his mind.
“How’d you know I was down here?” Draco asks, just this once unable to keep the awe he feels around the other out of his voice.
++++++
Deep in Draco, an alarm goes off. There’s something about the woman in front of him that’s become unsettling, and they’ve left the topic of conversation without even properly broaching it. “You said you read my note, Professor. Potter and I were both affected by that Sorting Hat. It didn’t fall on a decision of
“I’m sorry, Ernie, I — stop staring and send for Madam Pomphrey!” Draco roars. “We’ll get you fixed up, alright? You’ll be fine.”
Potter nods. Sitting on the edge, he toes off his trainers, then scoots towards the headboard.
Hangingbone deflates, exhaling noisily.
"Potter," Draco greets, and his voice sounds high in his throat. He swallows, tries again. "We have to stop meeting like this."
"We've tried it your way." Harry gave the rope another sharp tug. "Now we're going to try it mine."
Draco climbs in first, his blood thundering when Harry seats himself beside Draco instead of across, bumping his knee. "I like to see where I'm going," Harry explains. Draco nods, wondering why he would volunteer such innocuous information. "How observant of you."
Draco emerges from the bedroom to check around the doorway. Peer down the empty hallway. He could have sworn he’d left Harry asleep under the covers.
"Oh, of course he's been busy. He's flitting all about the ministry these days."
“I’m trying,” Potter says. His fingers drum rhythmically on the arms of the chair. “It’s just a bit, cold?” He screws his face up in thought. “I feel like I’m in a mausoleum.”
Draco snorts into his tea, doing his best to drowned out their bickering, the bells, and the chains as he keeps his eyes trained on the double doors. He expects Potter chose to sleep in this morning, as rested from the previous night’s activities as Draco is. He’d tried to sense Potter when he’d first sat down, but all Draco found in return was a general sense of relaxation, and  that had been good enough for him.
"I don’t want to be infallible! I make mistakes, Draco!"
Thoroughly irritated, Draco endures the whispers and pointed glares of the elevator for a second time, and descends back to the third level. He’s just reached the corridor leading to Headland’s office when he nearly collides into Potter coming out.
"You think so highly of yourself." Potter’s eyes have narrowed now, his breath coming quick as he glares at Draco. "Do you honestly think I have nothing better to do than watch your every move? That you just garner so much attention, no one can help but focus on you whenever you’re in the room?"
Abruptly, Draco stops. Stands on shaky legs. Harry sits up, wild eyed as Draco steps back and runs a hand through his hair. He doesn't bother to hide the fact that he's hard when he readjusts his robes. He wants Harry to feel at least some regret, even if it's nothing close to the kind coursing through him in this moment.
“The connection?”
Potter's nose wrinkled. "But you're here?"
From the floor rose a high-pitched, earsplitting wail. Harry stumbled, had barely enough time to clap his hands over his ears before it rose in volume, blurring his vision around the edges.
“Ha, ha.” Draco turns to the game, reeling back as the Hufflepuff seeker, Margaret Willison, pulls the end of her broom up to avoid the crowd by a hair’s breadth.
for either of us, and our magic and emotions went haywire.”
Fang props his head on the knee of Draco’s trousers, soaking them with an alarming amount of drool. When Draco tries to nudge his away, Fang growls, the thrum low in his throat.
“Are you sure I didn’t write the story?” Potter glares back at him. “Because you’re certainly treating things that way.”
Prompt:
Slowly, Draco unfurls his fingers and rises onto his knees, making sure Potter’s eyes are locked with his when he lifts his wet hand to his mouth.
“Why Potter, then?” Draco blurts. “If you wanted to target me, drain my magic, make me miserable. Why did it effect him?”
“Seamus and Dean are still in Hogsmeade, Neville’s gone to his Gram’s for the weekend, and Ron’s gone off with Hermione, I think.” Draco didn’t think it was possible for Potter’s face to get redder, but somehow he accomplishes it. “I might have… asked them all to make themselves scarce.”
his i’s, zipping across the parchment to strike entire paragraphs of it’s own volition.
"Er, I’ll think about it.."
He floos to London, then makes his way into the Ministry, exiting the grate and crossing the foyer. Ministry appointed visits were the only trips Draco was allowed to make by himself, for obvious reasons. Mind healers were on level three, a dimly lit stretch of offices far more intimidating than their intended purposes would suggest.
“Have fun,” Blaise sing songs as the damp stone reforms at Draco’s back.
hat.”
Then he’s in the lion den.
"No one informed me of that." If they had, Draco thinks resentfully, he probably wouldn't have come. He's only just gotten his wand back, a fact Potter is certainly well aware of. "Why wasn't it on the invitation?"
The thirty-first of July finds Draco sitting at the Manor's kitchen table, staring out the window. The sky outside is a fiery orange turning blue, bleeding into the night. It reminds Draco of the night at the conservatory, the night he'd first kissed Harry Potter.
Oh well, Draco thinks, as he clears his throat and offers the password Potter had given him as they parted that morning. “Peppermint Toad!”
it to mean. Wanting anything from Potter might be the most frustrating thing of all.
“And you’re not usually this dramatic either.”
“More like who can make the most noise,” Pansy sniffs. She places painted fingers to Theo’s chin and turns his head away from her. “And yet I can hear you masticate as if you cast a Sonorous on yourself.”
Then there was the dream. Draco stares out into the gloom of his bed hangings. He’d never been one for Divination — he considered Millicent the expert in that area, her tarot readings more than alarmingly accurate — but there was a reason he had top marks. One didn’t have to be an scholar to interpret that eating coal until your tongue turned black was likely a bad sign.
“Two peacock quills. One porcupine..,” Scrivenshaft carefully examines each as he puts them into a bag. He adds another quick quill and three bottles of ink. “The total will be four—“
first, and is barely through the oak door when Draco is overcome by the sudden urge to
"Spoken just like a Squib." Malfoy walked the length of the room, his Chimera-lined boots erasing each footprint as he went. "You said the others are on their way?"
“Nothing!” Draco shouts, and this time, his outburst draws eyes, including those of a concerned Granger and a suspicious Pansy. He can feel his magic rising in his core like sickly bile, and Draco does his best to taper it down. If he does something now, it’ll affect Potter too. Thankfully studying with Ernie means that he won’t be using his magic for anything more than note taking -- he can deal with a haywire quill if it meant not causing a scene.
“Something like that,” Ernie returns, grimly. He looks to Draco again. Stands. “Just think about what I’ve said, alright? Happy Christmas, Draco. Harry.”
Draco braces a hand on Potter’s shoulder, breath hitching as he pressing it into the mattress, as his other hand fists the sheets. He leans forward over Potter as he ruts in earnest. His eyes sweep Potter’s face before settling on his mouth, his moist lips parted, so close they breath each other’s exhales as they pant.
Stubborn as ever, Potter crosses his arms. His jumper is burgundy with a golden stag sewn into the fabric. As his chest swells, the antlers seem to expand with him. “No problems here, just enjoying the game.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Draco answers. “But it might do you better to ask Potter, than me. All I can offer is that you’re cutting way more paper than you need, and if you were to just fold that corner over the other, your wrapping wouldn’t be anywhere near as abysmal.”
Draco stumbles back, crushing a discarded bouquet underfoot. "You don't get to say that to me, Potter. Not anymore."
“You could come to mine.”
he feels knowing someone has his back. It doesn’t feel like enough. Even within his own house, among his friends, Draco has a lot to make up for.
Draco licks his lips.
Draco swallows hard. “I know.”
Slipping it into his pocket, Draco doesn’t bother to answer, tearing into the envelope to remove the slip of parchment folded neatly in two. His eyes race over the page, his mother’s handwriting feminine and precise as she expresses her surprise at the contents of the morning’s paper, as well as Draco’s failure to bring any of it to her attention. He exhales through his nose, draws another shaky breath. He’d expected as much.
+++++
for new quills (and extra inkpot thanks to Patil),
Draco's eyes find Potter's, who colors but, again, does not stop staring.
After a healthy bribe, Pansy managed to sneak a few photos of Potter ‘
“If you’re referring to one Gryffindor in particular, it had better not be me.”
"Sorry, sorry, I know I’m late." Potter climbs through the circular door of the vault, wearing that sheepish smile Draco hates the most. He hates it so much, it’s the first one his mind usually supplies him when he works himself in the middle of the night, careful to bite back his moans now that he can no longer cast silencing spells on his doors.
A pair of feet appears before them. Draco’s eyes trail up from the neatly laced oxfords to the face of one Hermione Granger, who looks shell-shocked to see him sitting next amongst her best friends in front of the fire Gryffindor Common Room. She seems to push that aside, pushes herself to ask, “Do about what?”
“Do you hear yourself?” Potter shakes his head. “You sound deranged, Malfoy!
He finds Harry's eyes in the dim, doesn't break contact as he grinds down. There's an answering lift in Harry's hips, the faint jump of his cock within his trousers as it stirs.
Draco doesn’t know what any of it means and his stomach is squirming too much to process it. He nods dumbly, concentrates on his cutting charm as he snips a perfectly square piece of paper to wrap his the record in.
“Hehe-he-here,” He drops the money and shuts his eyes.
Draco’s eyes widen. “Was that today?? I completely forgot!” The Beard Party is an annual Slytherin tradition, a modified holiday classic, as no Slytherin would be caught dead in anything so horrid as an ugly Christmas jumper. Draco’s preferred style of facial hair is particularly distinguished, if he says so himself.
“That’s pretty generous for a Slytherin.”
Fuck. Dark and lean, Potter looks positively edible. Doing his best to stay on track, Draco nods. “I’ve been thinking about our situation. How going out of our way to be nice to each other hasn’t changed the effects.”
,” Draco says delicately. “You skate rather well, Potter. It takes a lot to be able to keep up with me.”
He had no chance to address it as their Professor chose that moment to sweep into the classroom, a cool breeze accompanying her as she shuts the door and deposits her bag onto her desk. Blaise quickly stuffs the calendar back into his bag and faces front.
He feels Harry draw away from him. "This, Draco," he says, rising up onto one hand to stare down at Draco, eyes glittering dangerous. "What we're doing right now."
"Draco?"
Draco snorts. “I’m absolutely sure it’s the wrong place, but that’s the point.”
“Are those--?”

Rising to his feet, Draco picks up Parvati’s gift from the pile of presents he’s finished wrapping. There’s one he has to deliver to Ravenclaw for Lovegood, along with a strongly worded letter to pass along to Padma Patil, and Ernie’s tickets, but the rest are all Slytherin. In front of the fire, he finds Parvati’s stocking and drops her gift inside. When he turns around again, Potter is right behind him.
"Are all Slytherins this suspicious?"
“Malfoy…” Potter’s hands pull his hips down, holds Draco in place as he rocks up, in search of friction. The hard line of Potter’s erection drags along Draco’s leg, the shape of it alone making him salivate. A warm hand moves under Draco’s jumper to splay over his back, down the back of his trousers to grope and squeeze his arse. Draco keens, angling down so that his prick thrusts against Potter again and again.
. But he’s your boyfriend, isn’t he? He’d be hard pressed to say no.”
“What--?”
Shaking her head, Parvati slips her hand back. Curls it into the sleeve of her robes. She clears her throat. “We’ll talk about it later.” Her eyes dart to Draco with something like guilt, before turning back to Pansy. “So, about this Greg. How does your mum plan to get around the statute on
i'm behind, but i haven't given up!
. Draco made a face. The last one might be a lie. He and Potter had been exercising a lot of free will and had few lines left to cross excluding penetration. But that felt like too huge a step to take lightly. Despite being a Slytherin, Draco still had areas in which he felt quite traditional. He wasn’t holding out for Potter’s hand in marriage, but, well. Something more permanent would be nice..
As they descend the curved staircase, Draco clears his throat. “Shouldn’t you go clear things up with your friends? Let them know you’re alright?”
Potter stares, apparently at a loss for words. "I do mind," he says after a moment. "I just think they made an honest mistake, that's all."
“Sorry,” Potter says, his voice strangled. His hand grips Draco’s bicep. “I didn’t expect you to do that and my neck is a little..”
“Malfoy.”
Potter shakes his head as if he can read Draco’s mind, “Your house elves did it all, didn’t they? Don’t tell Hermione, even if they liked it. She expects you to be crap. It might be fun to throw her off.”
"I think it’s more about the experience."
“Get 'em good, Harry! Serves the tosser right!” Weasley shouts, looking as if he might join in, as Granger grabs Potter by the back of the robes in an attempt to pull him off. Ernie and Blaise each take one of Draco's arms, dragging him out of range of Potter’s still swinging arms.
"As the delicate type,
Draco and Ernie both start. The movement startles a squirrel on the trunk of the tree nearest them. Harry’s behind their bench, hands in the pocket of his robes. Saying he looks displeased would be an understatement.
A Pause. Half a second too late. "You're wrong."
Draco raises his hand to shield his eyes. “Yes.”
“Merlin’s beard… here, son.” He hands Draco a handkerchief. “Just tell me what you need and we’ll see if we can ring it up for you and get you on your way.”
"I’ve never made you feel like anything other than what you already felt about yourself." Potter draws back with a sigh and Draco immediately feels the distance
Not that the tower is much better, but Draco feels catching Potter off guard will be to his advantage. He won’t expect Draco to come anywhere near him after yesterday and because it’s the weekend, there won’t be as many people around. Deep down, Draco’s honestly a little curious to see what the inside of the famed house common room looks like. It’s probably a disgusting mass of red and gold that will sear his retinas and offend his sensibilities.
“Haah, stop,” Draco guides his hips back down to the bed. His fingers slide down, down, until they splay over Potter’s bulge. He strokes it gingerly, hears Potter’s hiss in the darkness as he tightens his grip. “Can I touch you?” Draco whispers.
"They're doing just fine if you ask me." Potter makes no effort to hide the bite in his voice. Another predictable choice, Draco thinks, but one that has much more potential to be entertaining.
Harry held his stare. "Is that all I'd have to do?"
The rest of the evening goes relatively well. Blaise's mouth goes a mile a minute, somehow carrying conversations with Potter, Granger and Chang individually. At one point he and Potter burst into laughter, standing close as Draco watches their mouths move. He tells himself he's happy to see it, but the relief he feels when they separate and Potter's eyes meet his, is a lot more apparent.
