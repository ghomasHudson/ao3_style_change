Harry put his hands on Draco’s shoulder and turned him until he had no choice but to meet Harry’s eyes. It felt calming and familiar and like happier memories. It sent tingles through Draco’s body, starting at all of the places their skin met and flowing all the way down Draco’s spine. “Breathe.”
As he stepped off the train at King’s Cross, Harry knew that there was a good summer, and hopefully a good year ahead of him.
Draco landed and found Harry, standing a ways off, the snitch clutched in his hand. He rushed over and wrapped Harry in a bone crushing hug. Moments later, Ron was there, then Hermione and Blaise, then Pansy and Hannah and the whole team was hugging and laughing. This put them at the top going into the House Cup Championship matches.
He often found himself joined by Hermione who had three tests that week. She was good at keeping him focused on his work, if a bit annoying to be around when she was studying. She had a habit of tapping her pen while she worked and it sometimes made it hard to zero in on the reading.
Harry turned to the students and put up a sound barrier between the two halves of the classroom “Okay each of you will have a go at dueling your roommate. Use the most complex spells you know that are not lethal, illegal, or able to cause severe bodily harm. Mr. Longbottom you’ll be  with me, is that okay?” The group seemed taken aback that he used Neville’s last name. Harry too, thought it was strange calling his friends by their last names like that, but he thought it would help him get into the habit for the younger years.
If anyone deserved their own room, it was Potter. Potter, who had defeated the Dark Lord. Potter, who had hunted Horcruxes, broken into Gringotts, escaped on a dragon, defeated a basilisk, earned the philosopher’s stone, warded off hundreds of dementors with a single patronus, led a secret club to teach others how to defend themselves, how to fight. Won the TriWizard Tournament, saved his life, despite everything that had happened between them, and done about a million other things, that Draco didn’t know about.
The date went well. It went so well in fact that by the end it had been established that it was in fact a date. Or at least it had been intended to be such.
Harry was pulled from his thoughts by Ginny “So, are Professors Granger and Potter gonna go easy on us this year?”
Sirius talked Harry’s ear off about a reality tv series he has followed religiously for as long as Harry could remember. Harry had caught a few seasons of the show here and there, but wasn’t as interested as his Padfoot was.
“At least you won’t have to worry about her going poor,” Daphne said, attempting lightheartedness. “Tracey came home from Albania, she’s got herself a special friend.”
“Ready to admit that you’re stalking me yet?” Harry asked pleasantly, as though he was merely remarking on the fine weather they were experiencing.
“Oh you know, pre-med, biology, chemistry, you name it. I’ve got to do the whole lot if I ever want to actually become an anesthesiologist.” Brittany said.
Draco collapsed onto his own bed and stared at Potter unabashedly. “How are you so hot?” He asked Potter, his voice slurred. Potter’s eyes snapped up and he squinted at Draco.
Ron stared at Harry for a minute, as if he was trying to see if Harry was lying. Then Harry saw the wheels turning in Ron’s head, like he was trying to piece together something.
“Trust me they’ll love you. When they’re in a good mood both Remus and Sirius Lupin have the personalities of small puppies. With just a dash of old married couple.”
Draco should have believed Harry’s words because they turned out to be right. After the first round of matches, Timber Coast University beat out Chase College and stayed in the running for the Championship title. Next they were against Gretenburg University, a school that had never posed much of a threat to them. They easily knocked them out of the competition and moved on to the next round. The University of Brecken was a bit more tricky. They usually made it into the quarter final, so it was strange for them to go so quickly, but Draco and the rest of the team managed to eliminate them.
“Yes, preferably before you act on whatever you feel towards Draco. He’ll react badly if he finds out both at once, you know he doesn’t handle change well. And I know you feel something, don’t think I didn’t notice you have been saying ‘Draco’ this whole time.”
After eating the two headed out and followed their route back towards the dorm until they reached the bookshop Harry had seen, the Red Riding Book.
Drinks were shoved into his hands and in spite of himself he choked it down. His head began to swim as the alcohol took over. Slowly, people began to leave, either stumbling up the stairs or through the portrait hole and back to their own common rooms. Some people had fallen asleep on the various sofas, and a few were even passed out on the floor.
Draco was shocked when he found that the class would be focused around occlumency and legilimency, for the next few lessons. This was something Draco was rather skilled at and Harry... let’s just say it wasn’t one of Harry’s strengths. Granger, on the other hand had mastered it with ease within a few mere weeks. Draco still had trouble sometimes comprehending how Granger had ended up in Gryffindor and not Ravenclaw.
The fall festival was beautiful, the whole town was decorated in fall colors and twinkle lights. Draco made them stop at the Rise and Grind for coffee and they all ordered fall themed drinks. Pansy got the cliche pumpkin spice latte, as did Blaise. Hermione got some sort of warm apple cinnamon drink, and Draco got a cinnamon hot chocolate. Harry hadn’t been sure what to order, all the fall drinks smelled amazing, so he picked the easiest think to make and went with a caramel latte with a dusting of cinnamon on top.
And together they set off, walking side by side, their fingers intertwined, the summer breeze running through their hair.
Hermione seemed to be wrapping up just as he and Neville were finishing. All the duels that day had ended in a draw due to time constraints so far. The class switched over so that they could finish the assessment.
Tay didn’t have internet and I spent most of the afternoon watching Wizards Tales of Arcadia with a friend. Anyway, that kiss in the last chapter was something, lets see what develops in this one!
Draco was happier than he had been in a long time, happier than ever before, if he was being honest with himself. He had been operating under a heady bliss ever since the conclusion of his mum’s trial. The feeling was so strong that he had been able to ignore all of the articles speculating about his and Harry’s relationship.
Harry took a quick trip to pick up some flowers in Hogsmeade during the day on Saturday, then went to his empty classroom to get ahead on homework.
Harry remembered the conversation he had had with Malfoy, “Yeah,” Harry then tried to distract himself by checking the Marauder’s map.
The female auror laughed, “No one knows what anyone is going to say because that paper forbid all those testifying to speak about it. Go on, try to tell me what you’re going to say.”
“Also there’s gonna be a part on the first floor of our building tonight, if you want to go. I’ll probably go.”
“We should probably connect our calendars once we have our activities schedule set. That way we can figure out when we’ve got free time to do stuff like groceries together. Also its easier to know where we’re supposed to be when.” She paused for a minute, “There’s a self defense class on Sundays for a few weeks that we could probably sign up for. I’m going to. I don’t quite trust being the only girl on a boys floor.”
“Now we match,” Harry pulled out a rainbow flag from the same box and tacked it in the same place above his bed.
“Sorry,” Draco mumbled and made his way to his bedroom. The auror followed him. Draco rounded on the auror, “Are you going to follow me into the shower too?”
I think this is actually my favorite chapter of all of the one’s I have written for this fic so I hope you like it!
They’d admitted their feelings towards each other… so progress. Harry had feelings for Draco! He still couldn’t really believe it, not entirely anyways.
“My mom is a little upset that I felt the need to get away, but she understands how… intense my dad gets. She wants to give me space to be an adult. But my dad is pissed, won’t even talk to me. Hasn’t said a word to me since he found out, aside from the initial screaming.” Pansy said, sitting on Draco’s bed and pulling out her phone as it chimed. Her eyes darted back and forth across the screen for a moment before she stood again and said, “I’m going to head out guys, Brittany invited me to go with her and a couple of the girl’s she met earlier today to a twenty-four seven smoothie bar down the street.”
He made a break for the library where he spent the rest of the night studying. Definitely not feeling like he was on cloud nine cause he sort of asked out Draco Malfoy.
He ended up buying a pack of playing cards themed after his favorite sci fi series and a few pads of sticky notes to support the business.
So classes suck write now and this is the first real thing I’ve written since my last chapter two weeks ago. Apparently exhaustion isn’t good for motivation.
“Ok Draco, you’re up.” Hermione said. Draco gulped and stepped forward, raising his wand with a hand that only slightly shook.
Harry walked over to Draco, who had been struggling, he was the only one who was left without a patronus at this point, though Harry thought he had been pretty close a few times.
Harry headed into the common room after he finished proctoring the final exam of the day, the sixth years. His boyfriend was holed up in the little seat that had been put under the stairs to the boys dorm. Draco really hadn’t sat there a lot as of late, it seemed to have been his hiding place at the beginning of the year more than anything.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut as he scrambled up the curved staircase. He rushed into his room and collapsed onto his bed. He knew better than to expect them to forgive him, no one would ever forgive him. After several minutes, he dragged himself into a sitting position. He had to finish his homework. He sighed and got back to work, trying his best to push away all thoughts of Quidditch and the others in his year.
“How’d he die?” Draco paused, “If that’s not too personal, don’t feel like you have to answer that.”
The dorm room Draco stood in the doorway of was more spacious than he had originally anticipated, especially for a double. He glanced around at the large wooden desk, with identical beds on either side of it and chairs of the same wood tucked against it. A miniature refrigerator was build into the center, lined with storage drawers, for snacks perhaps. There was a large window behind each of the beds, offering a view that would surely be incredible during sunsets. The lake was visible, blue and glittering in the afternoon light. A gentle breeze glided in through the windows, filling the room with the fresh scent of pine and sand. It was a pleasant combination, and it settled Draco- made him feel more confident in his decision. Perhaps distancing himself from his parents and their plans for his future wasn’t a completely bullheaded choice after all.
Harry had always enjoyed the thrill of scary movies; not much actually frightened him, and they never really gave him nightmares. He really just enjoyed the suspense of a well written horror movie.
He had not killed Dumbledore. He had not killed anyone. He had not given up Potter to Bellatrix or the Dark Lord. He had tried. But still, he had become a death eater. He had nearly murdered Weasley and Bell. He had used the unforgivable curses. Things were not looking good for him.
“You really were bored, you’ve done out to May. Smart move you made with the patronus lesson.” She said.
“Sorry, I just,” Better to get right to it instead of dancing around the truth. “I really like you Harry, like, like you, like you.” Draco stammered out in a rush of hurried, nervous words.
Malfoy nodded, dumbfounded, as Harry said, “I guess that means Mr. Zabini and Mr. Goldstein are up.”
Sirius set the microwave on top of the mini fridge; at the same time Remus entered the room, a box in his arms.
He put the champagne in a bowl with some ice and got out a bowl and filled it with his favorite snack mix. Hopefully that would be enough for tonight. Hermione headed to Pansy’s room at seven thirty. This allowed Harry a solid half hour of nerves and pacing before Draco knocked on the door at eight.
Malfoy’s letter arrived the morning that he and Hermione were to head back to Hogwarts. Harry figured that it would be easiest to wait and talk to Malfoy in person later that night.
They continued watching as if nothing had happened. Harry did his best to push the thought of holding hands with Draco out of his mind. At the next jump scare a few minutes later, Draco grabbed onto Harry’s hand, and didn’t let go.
The way she wouldn’t meet his eyes confirmed his suspicions. He scoffed and turned away from her, stalking across the parking lot and back towards the main campus.
“Looks like Potter’s our new seeker everyone!” Malfoy called “Meet the rest of you new team.” Malfoy said motioning to the people he had called down. “Weasley is keeper, Granger and Pansy are beaters, and the rest are our chasers. Now you all smell go take a shower and get your homework done.”
Before he knew it it was already six thirty, meaning breakfast was opening up. Harry realized how hungry he was and made his way up from where the patrol route had landed him in the dungeons to the Great Hall. He still had a while to go before he was off duty, then he had Transfiguration right after, not to mention Delacroix was probably going to be tired and snappy today because of Harry’s lateness to patrol. He also had second years to teach. That was the worst year, because they all remembered him showing up at the battle, and then them being promptly sent home, but were too young to know any decency regarding personal questions. The first years were at least too wary to ask questions. He also couldn’t forget quidditch practice, Malfoy would probably have his hide if he missed the first one.
“Trust me it’s bad. And the only real time I’ve spent around them is when we moved Harry in.” Hermione added.
“Well if you were to steal a bottle of something from the liquor cabinet to have a celebration for after midterms and invite him to join you…” Sirius trailed off.
“Hello Harry, nice to see you. You seem to have lost quite a few wrackspurts since the last time I saw you.” Said Luna cheerily.
Ok, so I totally forgot to write until like Friday last week, then it ended up being super long cause Tay and I decided I was gonna write the date. So here, a week late, is a near double length chapter for y’all.
Draco sighed and his mind continued to drift. He had a test in Transfiguration next week and one in charms the week following. And there was that Quidditch match to prepare for. He knew he was forgetting something, but- his mum’s trial!
“Those who say he was under duress and should not be considered guilty.” She paused to count, “Draco Malfoy is not guilty of use of the Unforgivables. Those who say guilty of attempted murder.” Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy seemed to be slowly starting to breathe again. “Those who oppose.” The witch paused to count again. “The opposition has it, Draco Malfoy is not guilty of three counts of attempted murder.”
“Okay, but before I go, I’ll give mine so you can keep the game going,” she looked around the group “Harry truth or dare?”
“Mr. Malfoy, you are the son of Narcissa and Lucius, are you not?” The head wizard asked, his voice booming and echoing around the room.
“They didn’t tell me because they hate anything and everything to do with magic. My aunt was jealous of my mum’s abilities when they were small and ended up carrying that hate with her. She married my uncle and they ended up having an obsession with being very normal.”
Harry frowned, “I never wanted to get into trouble you know. It just came with the title. And giving an eleven year old absolute freedom for the first time, especially when the headmaster gives you an easy way to sneak around.”
Draco scratched the back of his neck as he said, “Uh. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to sleep. But I’m not sure where else to go.” He cringed inwardly at himself. He was surely laying it on too thick. Harry was going to see through him at any moment. Only… he didn’t see through him at all.
“Hey, I’ll call you back afterwards. It finishes up at six, then I just have to shower quick. I can call you on my way to grab dinner from the dining hall. I’ll take it back to my dorm room and we can catch up then.” Draco offered quickly. He hated to upset her.
The Malfoy bit was hard to take, but Ron would come around. Wait. He didn’t really have a shot with Draco anyway. Draco had told him outright that he didn’t like him. That thought made Harry almost frown. But he still wasn’t sure how he felt about Draco anyway, or was he sure?
“You alright mate?” Ron asked, raising his eyebrows from where he sat on his bed, his legs crossed and a book settled in his lap.
“Hey!” He shot back defensively as he rubbed his arm and toed the door closed. “How was I supposed to know it was you?”
He was considering getting ahead on the reading he needed to do for next week’s poetry 101 lecture, when his phone began buzzing inside of his jeans pocket. He pulled it out to see a picture of him and his mom, both grinning into the camera. It was his contact photo for his mom. He quickly hit the answer call button and said, “Hey! Mom, how are you?”
Should he suggest it be a date? Probably not. “Yeah, Hermione and Pansy have cutesy couple plans that night, the others still all have exams.”
“Good morning class.” Hermione said, “Today we are finally moving on to the research, we will work on the rest of term. We want you to take turns calling out the questions you should have come up with, Harry and I will add them to the board.
He looked over to where Potter lay, sleeping soundly, as though no nightmares plagued him. Potter’s hair was messier than usual (quite a feat) and his lips were parted slightly. He didn’t have his glasses on. Draco looked away, because, well, without his glasses Potter looked... vulnerable.
Finally she was gone and Draco was left alone with Ron. He gulped thickly and opened his mouth to say something- anything, but no words came. Ron stared at him for a moment with narrowed eyes before he scoffed, rounded on his heel and stormed out of the dorm room. Draco supposed he deserved it, after all he hadn’t made the best first impression, but he had hoped for a little more sympathy on Ron’s end. Draco didn’t think he would be mad if the roles were reversed and Ron had wanted to switch roommates so he could live with his best friend.
“I know it can be hard, especially with everything that’s happened, so how are you feeling?” She asked again.
“Room nine!” The hat called. So, Daphne and Padma then. Draco idly wondered what they could possibly have in common.
Okay guys, here we are; the end! I can’t believe it’s here already. Thank you so much for joining Appie and I on this journey. Before I go off on a tangent, here’s the chapter!
Harry sighed and stood up to take his seat in the witness chair, somehow they had added a new title to him since the last trial. Granted it was one he had held for nearly eigtheen years, but he had figured they decided it didn’t count at the last trial. Apparently the boy who lived would be his title for life.
After lunch Harry, Sirius, and Remus drove back to Timberland. Harry joined them for the afternoon and then dinner. By the time Harry felt normal enough to walk back to his dorm it was dark out.
Harry made to dive for the snitch, a moment later Layla noticed and followed. The snitch had buzzed around towards the Gryffindor goal posts and Harry made a sharp turn and followed. Layla, who was earlier in her dive, was able to pull away quicker and had nearly caught up by the time he reached the goal posts where the golden ball had started hovering. Or at least Harry had thought it had. It had disappeared once more.
“I see you redid your colors.” Said Harry. He had decided to try to be civil to Malfoy this year, he was going to be his teacher and wanted to treat him and the other Slytherins fairly. Harry might have a newfound respect for Snape, but he was not going to let a grudge get in the way of his teaching.
Harry lifted the snitch into the air above his head, signaling that the game was over and the eighth years had won.
“Relax, he’s not a newborn, he’s almost one, you just need to hold him so he can face out, make sure he doesn’t fall, or try to crawl away. He’s pretty active and can pretty much walk if he’s holding onto something. You won’t break him.”
They ate lunch discussing this and that for a while, one of Hermione’s swim friends came and joined them for a while before they went to watch the disaster that was a few dozen first timer freshmen doing yoga on the lawn.
Harry kissed Draco’s temple, “Hey, love, I’m not going anywhere, I’ll visit as much as you like and we can write and its only six months, then you’ll be free- we’ll be free to do whatever the hell we want.”
Harry knew it was bad if Hermione was swearing, “You know you’re one of the best players we’ve got right? You and Pansy are almost as good as the twins were.” Not the best reminder at the moment, but it was all he had to go off of. “You okay?”
The two weeks leading up to the trial were utter shit. Draco wasn’t talking to him, and neither was Ron, though Ron seemed to be heading towards some sort of reconciliation. Draco, however, was on edge all the time. Worse than back in the fall when it was his trial. Though, Harry supposed, most were more concerned for their loved ones rather than themselves in times of crisis.
Draco heard Potter’s sharp intake of breath and knew he hadn’t been quiet enough. But what did they say about alcohol, ah yes,
Once he found that he started chopping up some onions and garlic and threw them in the pan with some oil. He found some meat in freezer to brown up and added that to the pan after defrosting it. He planned to make a meat sauce and pasta, so he set a pot of water to boil.
They made it back to the dorm and Harry collapsed onto his bed. Hermione had gone downstairs to use the bathroom on the girls floor. Harry pulled himself up and changed and went to brush his teeth in the bathroom and then returned to the room. Hermione had already gotten back and was curled up with a book on her bed.
And the third photo depicted Draco holding up a little black lab puppy- his dog Zoe. She was four now and an absolute menace. His heart jolted with a sudden sadness at the thought of having left her behind. It wasn’t as though he could have taken her here with him though. He knew it, but a part of him still felt so very guilty about it. He missed her terribly and it hadn’t even been twenty four hours yet.
“It’s just that I’m going to be staying by myself in London for most of the holidays, with Ginny and Ron in relationships there isn’t any room for me at the Weasly’s so writing you would at least ease some of the boredom. You sound like you could use someone as well.”
“It’d be great if you did some grocery shopping. There’s a little stove and an actual oven downstairs so we can actually cook if we want to. But make sure to get some microwave staples too.”
“And yet she still welcomed You-Know-Who into your home, into the manor. She let him set up his base there, right?”
“Yeah I guess. I saw a notification for the news app on my phone saying we’re advised to be wary because there’s rumors of the criminals planning to widen their scope.”
“Potter?” Draco’s voice was raw, with shock and apprehension. He was confused, why was Potter here? Why had they been paired together?
Suddenly a loud buzzing sounded from Potter’s side of the room. Draco jumped violently and was immediately embarrassed. He glanced back to Potter, to see if he had awoken. But he hadn’t. Cautiously, Draco stood and walked towards the sound. Then he thought better of it and returned to his bed. But the sound was unceasing. So, Draco began to pace, his stomach a knot of anxiety, his head scattered. What was he meant to do?
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, what can I do for you?” She asked, and her smile was kind, if not a little surprised.
Everyone gathered around the TV in the game room, Harry distributed bowls of popcorn and took his seat between Draco and Hermione. Brittany cued up the movie and the opening titles began to play.
He laid there, staring up at the blank, off-white ceiling for less than ten minutes before he was interrupted by the doorknob jangling. He sat up, his eyes trained wearily on the door. Ron never had this much trouble with it. Had he lost his key somewhere?
“Our story starts with Slughorn, and one of his then favorite students, Tom Riddle, who would later rename himself Voldemort. You see Voldemort’s main goal was not pure blood supremacy, in fact he wasn’t even pure blood himself. His father was a muggle and his mother practically a squib. His goal was life eternal.”
The next photo was of Pansy, Blaise and Draco, their arms wrapped around each other protectively and their smiles wide as could be. They were ten at most in the photo. Draco couldn’t quite remember where the picture had been taken, either some sort of petting zoo or maybe a fair- he couldn’t be sure though since the three of them took up the entire frame.
Potter was still asleep when he got there. How late was he planning on sleeping? He ought to wake soon if he intended on making it to his first lesson on time.
The swim practice ended and Harry went to change in the locker rooms before meeting Hermione outside.
He had been so distracted by happiness that he had completely forgotten about his mum’s trial. His gut churned painfully, overwrought with worry and guilt. He would have to write to his mum sometime this week or the next to check in on her, see how she was feeling. Though, he highly doubted that she would be honest with him. After all, she was his mother, and though he was of age now, she still made it her duty to protect him from everything, even the truth.
Harry wasn’t sure when the eighth years had found the time to decide to use the song that the Gryffindors had made improvements on when they stole it from the Slytherins. But he was glad Ron was getting some confidence from their classmates.
Next to him Pansy and Hermione were cuddling and looking away at the same jump scare moments, they really were meant to be. On his other side Draco appeared to be attempting to hide under the blanket without being conspicuous.
Though that didn’t mean there weren’t hard days. He usually ended up at the manor with Draco those days.
“I’m sorry I can’t tell you how I’m testifying.” Harry truly was. Right now Draco- er Malfoy needed something to comfort him. But legally Harry couldn’t say anything regarding how he was speaking at the trial to Draco, oh screw it he’s Draco now and there was nothing Harry could do about it. The alarm on Harry’s wand went off. “That’s the end of lunch. We should get to potions.”
“Okay. See you later.” Harry got up and went to go get ready for his morning run. Sometimes he really regretted being in a college sport. He would rather have returned to his bed. Or maybe stayed on the couch with Draco.
“Yup,” Pansy said happily as she nudged Draco’s dorm room door open with a foot. “She is entirely as I predicted. Super nice, she’s just as pretty as she was in her Instagram photos- you owe me twenty bucks by the way, I asked and she said she didn’t use any beauty filters or editing software on them. I quite like her, but she’s aiming to join Alpha Kappa Alpha, so she’ll probably off to live with them sophomore year onward. Kind of a bummer but whatever.”
Occasionally he fiddled with a camera instead of studying and would take pictures around the shop. One time he even asked Harry to watch his stuff while he went out and took pictures on the street. When he came back in he was frowning down at his phone.
There it was, room seven. It was time for him to find out who his roommate was. His insides roiled in trepidation and his hand shook as he reached out for the doorknob. He swallowed hard as he pushed open the door, to find-
“For the first charge those who say guilty please stand.” Harry glanced around at the Wizengamot. Most of them had remained seated. That was good. Killing Dumbledore was the worst charge.
The thought sparked an idea in his mind and he immediately got to work, his fingers flying across the keyboard of his laptop. Before he knew it, the essay had practically written itself. The higher the word count climbed, the more sure he was of himself, and by extension the more complex the essay became. By the time he’d finished, he was quite proud of his work and confident enough to submit it, despite the fact that he still had three days left to get it in.
His father was arguing with Greyback now, and Draco locked eyes with Granger. Ever so slightly, she shook her head. But he wasn’t sure if he could do it. His nerve had failed him at every turn. He looked back at her with pleading eyes, silently begging her to come up with some plan, to get them all out of this. She was the smart one, after all. She had shoved him down into second best in every subject.
His mother was still a bit traumatized by the death of Harry’s father when Harry was four years old. Harry did his best not to think about that though. He only had a few fleeting memories of James and a few of James’ things.
“It’s not that I hate it here, it’s my childhood home and I have some good memories here, but being here all the time is getting to me.”
Some of the class didn’t realize he had actually died. They just thought that he had been hit by the curse and played dead the whole time, at least up until today. Then came questions about what ‘the other side’ was like. Harry found himself physically unable to tell them. Not in that it was emotionally difficult to say, which it was, no, this was more like the fidelius. There was magic at work keeping him from saying. People aren’t supposed to know what happens when you die.
After all was said and done dinner was admittedly a success. Remus and Sirius seemed to like Draco, and Sirius also seemed to have whatever burden from work he was carrying lightened off his shoulders, at least for a little while.
I hope you enjoyed it! Love you all! Please leave some comments, and kudos if you haven’t already. Keep on the lookout this weekend for Appie’s chapter.
Draco got three more inches out before he was interrupted yet again. This time it wasn’t because of his own wandering mind, but rather an announcement from McGonagall.
“We have been preparing for over a month, and they know it’s our first class. If we mess up, we learn from it. Also this first class are our age it’s not like McGonagall set us up with first years. So take a deep breath, and find that Gryffindor courage. Trust me, we’ve got this.”
He looked healthier than Draco had seen him in a long time, certainly healthier than he had been while serving You-Know-Who. The bags under his eyes had faded some, from the deep purple they’d been to a dull, hardly visible blue. And in his eyes, Draco hadn’t seen that in a long time- hope, pure and unfettered. It was then that he realized how much he’d missed his dad, and that he forgave him, or could forgive him with time. So, reached forward and embraced his dad. His father returned the hug without hesitation, holding him close. “I’ve missed you.” His father whispered.
Draco flung out his arms around Pansy and Blaise’s shoulders as they loped across the lawn to partake in their annual tradition of having a pumpkin carving contest. The rules were simple. Each of them had an hour to carve their designs into ten pumpkins. Then all thirty pumpkins would be mixed together and everyone would try to guess what the designs were supposed to be. You received one point per each pumpkin you guessed correctly and two points if your design was guessed correctly by one other person, five points if both other people got it right.
“Well,” Draco started— wait since when was he Draco? How often had Harry been calling him that in his head? “My friends started making plans for the holidays. I couldn’t bring myself to join them.” Draco sat on his bed.
“Not really, they would’ve kept us as prisoners regardless of whether we were who they were searching for or not. Bellatrix would have likely kept us as playthings for her to torture. And Lucius recognized Ron pretty quickly.”
They had his entire half of the room looking rather good within an hour and all of the boxes were soon discarded. The last thing for Draco to do was to organize the surface above his dresser that was meant for displaying personal items. Carefully he set up the few photos he had brought with him. One was from when he was little. They’d been on some camping trip in the mountains. He was perched on his father’s shoulders, his little arms wrapped nervously around his father’s head. They were both grinning ear to ear. Beside them stood Draco’s mom, her sister Andie, and Andie’s daughter Tonks. Tonks was in her early teens in the photo, her hair a vibrant neon green.
Draco watched everyone fly, contemplating who would make the best team. Of course Potter would be the seeker, he was certainly superior to everyone else, including himself. Draco knew he would make a poor keeper and an even worse beater, so that left him with the position of chaser, which he was adequate at. But he would only take up that role if he was truly desperate, he hoped he would be able to find three chasers.
Harry got up to stretch his legs about halfway through the day. He wandered through the hallway that had students running to and from their compartments. When he got to the back of the car he noticed an auror standing outside the last compartment, out of which came Draco a moment later, Harry nearly running into him.
Molly was up early baking something that smelled delicious. Harry followed his nose into the kitchen and took a seat at the table.
Molly turned around from where she was working, “Oh, good morning Harry, dear. You’re here awfully early, would you like some tea?”
He scanned the options and decided on the churro booth in one corner, since the line was far shorter than any of the others and seemed to be moving rather quickly. They were to the front of the line within minutes. Draco bought churros for them both and they wondered around, admiring the scenery as they ate. Draco was the first to admit it was the best churro he had ever had.
“Would you ever consider joining a sorority?” Draco asked as they settled the boxes onto the ground.
Malfoy apparently had had enough time to change the colors on his side of the room to swirls of navy blue and emerald green along with unpacking and getting ready for bed. Though the green was technically a Slytherin color Harry thought that it gave Malfoy’s side of the room a more peaceful look.
He tried asking Pansy and Hermione for help but neither of them had any suggestions that were even worth noting in Draco’s mind. He was stumped. Blaise and Neville were useless too. Draco was out of options, so he did the only logical thing and turned to the internet. He visited countless websites, each claiming to know the best places to go on a date. He considered everything from thrift shopping to visiting a local museum, karaoke to bowling.
The ministry witch nodded and scribbled something down. “Was Mr. Malfoy ever forced to kill anyone?”
Draco massaged his temples and impatiently awaited Ronald’s arrival. After about an hour and a half of simply waiting, Ronald still had not made an appearance. It was starting to worry Draco. Just about everyone else on their floor had finished getting their boxes inside and yet his roommate hadn’t even arrived yet.
His trial had arrived... and Draco was beyond nervous. Of course Pansy, Daphne and Blaise had offered to accompany him, but he refused. He needed to do this on his own. Or rather, he didn’t want them to see him as he was carted off to Azkaban. He was a Malfoy after all, he still had a little bit of pride remaining.
Their relationship was off to a rough start and they’d never even met… or spoken… or texted. Draco had not been too happy to find he would be rooming with a complete stranger when his two best friends from Linton Dale Prep had come here with him. He’d contacted the dean about being switched, but she had refused him and notified Ronald of his request to a room change.
“So, this is probably really boring for you, huh?” He asked, grinning broadly. It was as though they had never had their previous conversation at all.
“Hey, love,” Draco said, gently removing the glass from Harry’s grip, “Come to bed.” Harry seemed to be about to retort so Draco continued, “If you have anymore, you’re going to feel dreadful in the morning, hell you’re already going to feel pretty shitty.”
A couple days later were the quidditch tryouts. Harry was, frankly, a bit nervous. He was trying out for all the positions, though he had really never played many of them before. Aside from that he had never actually tried out for anything. He had been volunteered by McGonagall for the Gryffindor team and turned out to be a natural,
Draco’s problems with his dad suddenly seemed so very small and insignificant in the face of Neville being orphaned before he could so much as walk. Draco opened his mouth to speak but before he could form the words, they heard a car door slam outside. Draco turned to the window and watched as Ronald stepped out of an old minivan, an older woman who couldn’t have been anyone but his mother hobbled out of a slightly newer minivan beside him.
Harry could hear Ron asking Hermione if she was okay. Harry was glad his friends were together, but he knew a single argument could blow them apart for good.
Draco shrugged, “I thought I was going to Azkaban. Didn’t really do a whole lot of career planning in the midst of all that.”
“Okay, that will be all Mr. Carrow, you are dismissed.” He was escorted out by two aurors. “Now for our next witness if you please.” She looked down at something written before her and then said, “Antonin Dolohov.”
He needed to remember that at least Azkaban no longer had the dementors, so it might not be complete torture, should be be locked up. No, he couldn’t think like that, like he had already received a life sentence.
“The Wizengamot shall come to order.” The head wizard spoke, “The Wizengamot shall now decide which charges Narcissa
The holidays were fast approaching again. Draco would be let off his house arrest just after the new year. Draco liked to joke that it was a new millennium and therefore a new phase of his life every time he was reminded about it.
“So I applied for a job at that coffee place we went to last night. I should hopefully get a call about an interview soon.”
Draco rubbed his chilled fingers and moved closer to the fire raging within the hearth. “Where’s Pans?” He asked the other two.
“Listen Potter... Harry.” Draco had called him Harry? That was new, Draco hadn’t even called him that in class. Though Harry wasn’t sure that he minded all that much, “There’s something I need to say.”
Harry was busy with grading all of the Defense exams, he’d started with the eighth years and begun working his way down. For obvious reasons, Draco hadn’t been allowed to help him with the eighth years, but once Harry finished up with them, he and Draco had split Harry’s work between them. Surprisingly the pair of them worked well together and finished up all of Harry’s grading before Hermione had even finished half of hers. Granted she had a few more exams than they did, even so, to Draco it felt like an accomplishment.
McGonagall sighed and pursed her lips, “Well, alright, but if you want to talk about anything, I am always here.”
The campus was fully decked in Halloween decor, from bats hanging in every tree, to fog machines billowing across the grounds, adding an eerie effect. Even the sky was clouded and dim.
“Hi Draco, it’s your father. I’m sure you know that though since you probably watched the phone until it stopped ringing. Listen, your mom didn’t want me to tell you this, but it’s getting to the point where you need to know. Mom’s cancer came back Draco, and its worse this time, with her being older and the stress… the doctors don’t know how much time she has left, they don’t think she’ll be able to fight it off this time. You need to come home, at least to say goodbye- just in case.” His voice broke on the word goodbye and Draco was left standing on the bustling sidewalk, a bag filled with clay dinosaurs in one hand and the sound of that broken word ringing in his ears.
“Oh, uh, eight?” Harry responded easily, turning back around to face Draco as he did. “I’m not quite sure when Hermione is going out, but she’ll probably be gone by then.” He reached into the little bakery display case and pulled out a blueberry muffin, passing it off into Draco’s open hand.
Draco turned his attention back to Harry’s letter. There was much there to take in and he didn’t know what to make of any of it.
“It’s gonna be tough. If McGonagall hadn’t made us all try out I wouldn’t have gone for it. She made Malfoy captain and he’s a good enough seeker for me not to see a need to try out. I still think we can do it though. I do agree with Neville, you should do some sort of girly bonding activity with Parkinson. It wouldn’t be the end of the world, Malfoy and I have shared a room for weeks and he and I haven’t even tried to kill each other.”
Hey Everyone! I hope you like the story! This is my first time doing a collaboration, so I hope it goes well! Enjoy :) This chapter is my writing.
“So what? It’s bigger than breaking into the Ministry? Bigger than stealing from Gringotts and freeing a dragon? Bigger than fighting You-Know-Who half a dozen times and killing him? You could do all of that and now you’re what? Afraid of a slap on the wrist?” Draco shouted.
Harry waited out the fifteen minute recess in his seat. He considered going out after Draco, but since the trial was still in process they might be finicky about letting someone interact with the convicted death eater, regardless of their relationship status.
Draco did his very best to avoid Harry at all costs. He had risen before Harry every morning, which was quite a feat considering that Harry had to wake up at incomprehensible, ungodly hours of the morning to patrol the corridors in search of unruly students. He would hide himself way, usually beneath the staircase that led up to their dorm rooms. He waited to enter the Great Hall until Harry had already seated himself, so as to be sure to sit as far away as physically possible. He sat on the opposite side of the room for every lesson and waited to enter their dorm for the evening, until he could be sure that Harry was asleep.
That last one was easy to write since he was in the shop, he liked the atmosphere, and could tell that the other employees were quite happy with their jobs. Mr. Orange was nice as well and seemed devoted to making the place better. He mostly just wanted to work there for money, and probably free coffee.
A little brightness came into Draco’s life with the arrival of an owl. Clutched in its claws was a letter, from none other than Harry Potter himself.
By the time he came back to himself he realized he had just bolted from his boyfriend for no good reason. No, it was an okay reason, his brain supplied in a voice that sounded like the mind healer he had seen a few times this past year, mostly the previous summer.
Harry only glared and glared and glared. The minutes stretched on into hours... into days or maybe weeks. Finally, Ron scoffed and went up the stairs, being quite sure to ram his shoulder into Draco on the way up.
Aaaaaand we’re done! This has been an incredible adventure for the last six months. I hope all of y’all are well and those who celebrate are having a Merry Christmas. No we did not plan to end with a Christmas on Christmas it just worked out that way.
“Do you remember me writing to you over Christmas about how my relatives knew I had magic and didn’t tell me?”
Draco smiled politely and didn’t respond, but Pansy couldn’t hold in her snort of laughter at how absurd the statements were. “Sorry,” She muttered lowly in between her little bursts of laughter.
He also knew that he was going to testify on their behalf. They had both done things that had kept him alive, and while he wasn’t sure how much good it would do, he would at least try to let Malfoy finish off the year at Hogwarts.
It was odd to compare Draco escaping punishment to Potter defeating the most terrible wizard of all time, but alas, here he was.
The male auror spoke then, turning Draco’s attention, “You didn’t read the paper you signed in order to testify, did you?”
After that Harry and Hermione wandered through the campus gardens and libraries, attempting to find the good study spots. Harry also took a more detailed look around the athletic center and gym. He would run track in the spring and had regular workouts to train and keep in shape during the off season, he wasn’t there on scholarship or anything and was probably one of the slower runners on the team, but he had mostly been there for the exercise anyway.
Gryffindor’s new seeker was a third year, one he had actually made a reserve for himself back in sixth year. That meant that she had quite a bit of talent and he might struggle to beat her, he didn’t mind though he liked a challenge.
Harry pulled himself away from Draco and continued past the stairwell to his dorm where he collapsed into his bed.
After a brief recess, it was time for the verdict. Draco stopped breathing. He wouldn’t begin again until it was over, one way or the other, it would be over soon.
He moved stiffly, ever closer and then he was bending down in front of Potter, for this was unmistakably Potter. Just say no, come on, please, say no. Say no. “I don’t know.” ‘Damn you!’ Draco thought to himself.
The terror Draco was feeling made his appetite disappear. He attended most meals, pushing around the food on his plate, but never actually eating, until Pansy began to notice. So he hid out in his room during as many meals as he could, claiming to have the house elves bringing him food.
“I just wanted to say,” Draco was finding this to be harder than he’d expected. “Er... I just wanted to say, thank you. Thank you for giving me a second chance and testifying and all of it. Thank you.”
While he roamed the halls looking for threats or out of bounds students Harry couldn’t help but let his thoughts wander to Draco. He had woken Harry up, that had never happened before. Draco always seemed too afraid to do anything so bold, Harry guessed would be the correct word even though what Malfoy did wasn’t all that bold. Malfoy had seemed subdued this year, not wanting attention like had almost every other year. Though that might have something to do with his upcoming trial.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna shared a compartment on the train ride back from King’s Cross. Hermione and Neville were deep into discussion about some plant and Ginny and Luna were curled up next to each other by the window. Ron was still oblivious to the fact that Luna and Ginny were most certainly an item, and Harry wasn’t gonna state the obvious.
Draco walked with Pansy back to her dorm before heading to the boy’s floor with Blaise and Neville. “So,” Blaise asked with raised brows and a smug expression, “You and Harry? Gonna be a thing?”
He thought it was best to get the class out of the way, as quickly as possible. He skimmed through the rest of his classes for the day and then headed back up to his shared dorm room.
His hands started to shake from within his pockets, and he forced himself to swallow down that fear and walk in the door, knowing he might never cross over that threshold, on his own two feet, again.
“No idea. But he is to escort me to the manor, then put a shit ton of tracking spell on me to make sure I don’t leave the property. Mother already has the spells on her and there is always an auror on the property somewhere.”
On the first day of classes, Harry woke up early for once in his life. Okay not early, but he didn’t snooze his alarm charm at all. His brain registered that Malfoy had gone down to breakfast already, but it was too early for him to care. He headed down to the great hall and sat down at the ‘Gryffindor’ table. While there officially weren’t any house tables anymore, but most students still sat at their old house table with the rest of their house. It was habit more than anything. Hermione was already halfway through her breakfast when he got there.
Harry was dressed nicely in a red button down and his warmest, yet still nice looking, pair of pants. He had decided not to touch his hair, it wouldn’t do any good anyways.
“Why do you have to be so good at everything?” Draco groaned. “Perfect Potter, you always have to one up me in everything, even being drunk.”
Sunday breakfast in the great hall was always bustling. Harry and Hermione sat with Hagrid at the staff table talking about a new generation of bowtruckles that had just been born on a tree near Hagrid’s hut. He was concerned because the bowtruckles were too young to make it through the winter without help. Harry was simply glad that Hagrid’s new creature project was not dangerous this time around.
He and Draco said goodnight to the girls and went upstairs to say their goodnights. Since they passed Draco’s room first they said goodnight at the door there. It was limited to a bunch of sappy goodbyes and small kisses, the two not wanting to separate for the night. Eventually they did and Harry went back to his dorm to get a good night’s sleep.
Draco scoffed. “Hasn’t shown yet. Maybe he’s speaking to the Dean right now, trying to get switched out with someone else.”
When the last day of exams finished, Harry, miraculously, had the entire afternoon free to spend with Draco.
But now things were worse than ever before. Draco chastised himself internally, that wasn’t true. Things were better now, the Dark Lord was dead. He wasn’t being tortured or forced to torture others every other day anymore. He didn’t have to watch people being murdered.
“Have you ever noticed that none of our Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers lasted longer than a year?” Draco asked Harry, still looking at Hermione. For, he knew it he looked at Harry, made eye contact with him, stared into those bright green eyes, he would never be able to look away, never be able to let go. And he desperately needed to let go.
Potter sighed and grabbed Draco’s arm, “Then I guess we will just have to celebrate in the common room.”
By the following night, Ron still was refusing to speak to Harry, something Draco could tell that Harry was really bothered by. His reassurances that ‘everything would be alright’ and ‘Ron would come around eventually’ did nothing to convince either of them. For, they both knew, Ron could be quite stubborn when he wanted to be.
Draco pulled his phone away and checked, sure enough there were twelve missed calls from ‘father dearest’ and four voicemails, one of which was three minutes long. “I didn’t have my phone on me.” Draco said lamely.
He also had a few new tricks up his sleeve this year. Draco had taught him them during practices, he even ran a few drills with Harry occasionally. Harry chose not to dwell on that too much as he sat down at the staff table for lunch before the match. Of course he had lunch duty before the big game today, that was just how his life went.
Some kids still looked skeptical. “When I was sorted I almost went into Slytherin and I think that I might have done well there, perhaps have even better than I did in Gryffindor. Now follow me, the sorting is about to begin.”
“Better than expected. It wasn’t easy, but it was good to see him again.” He didn’t know how to explain it, not in a way that made any sense, but she seemed to understand enough of it to nod her head.
Draco was working in the little nook that he liked to work in in the common room. Harry gave a little wave and headed up to their room. He had just left the bathroom and was about to collapse onto his bed when Draco pulled him into a kiss.
Everyone took to the skies, searching for the snitch while Malfoy sat on his broom and watched. After about ten minutes, he called, “Weasley and Pansy.”
“No I’ll answer. You can pry a bit, we’re friends now, remember. I have to finish closing though so if I walk away while I’m talking that’s why.”
Harry hoped he didn’t sound like a fool, but before he could second guess himself, he sent the letter and small package off.
When he was finished, he stood to leave, but was stopped by a brisk calling of his name. It was McGonagall. She walked to him and pressed a piece of parchment into his hands, all he saw in her eyes was kindness. Odd.
Half an hour later, the cafe just needed to be locked, Draco was done with his paper and Hermione and Pansy had finished their drinks.
He glanced over at the pair of them and saw that Hermione was pulling Pansy up from the couch and leading her from the room. They were completely focused on one another and didn't have a single thought to spare on anything else- on anyone else.
Each practice was harder than the last, leaving his body sore and aching. The whole team was feeling it, and they had become easy to spot among the student population since they were all sluggish and constantly yawning. Draco was frequently stopped by other students wishing him luck and asking him how he thought they would do.
Next up was Narcissa. She mostly spoke about her family’s actions during the battle of Hogwarts and admitted to Voldemort using the manor as a home base.
“I’ll take a decaf iced coffee with one sugar, no cream.” Harry told the man, “And I suppose the same sandwich.”
Blaise and Hannah were next to master theirs, an Anaconda and Percheron respectively. But Draco was still struggling to even form a noncorporeal Patronus. A happy enough memory just refused to come.
Harry smiled as Draco led him into the sitting room where Narcissa was sitting on the couch sipping some tea.
“Andie?” Harry looked to Andromeda, who was pushing a stroller, headed towards them, “What’re you dong here?”
“So a party huh. I guess I’ve got nothing better to do tonight. And a job? Won’t that stretch you a bit thin?”
They stopped outside the cemetery and found Lily, Petunia, and Dudley already there, standing under an umbrella as a fall rain shower drizzled down on them. His mother was in tears, and when he said hello he could tell this was one of the days she wouldn’t speak at all. Petunia and Dudley hung back while they placed flowers around the grave.
Harry let out a breath as the wizard went through his concluding remarks, the last trial was over. Narcissa wasn’t going to Azkaban. Harry had stepped from behind the short barrier into the main part of the courtroom when he was crashed into by someone.
He was certain that he liked Draco at this point, but had no idea how to express his feelings without putting his friendship at risk. Not that Draco considered them friends. He still scoffed when Harry used the word to refer to them. They were most certainly friends, but there was a level of familiarity they had that made friends feel like an odd label.
“Books,” Draco scanned through the titles. “Potions books, muggle novels, and is this?” Draco pulled out a rather large book, “What is this?”
Draco laughed, but managed to play it off as a cough to keep Harry from glaring at him. Sometimes Draco forgot that Harry was rather oblivious to everything around him. It only made him more fond of him.
He woke up at the crack of dawn, put on his nice Christmas pajamas in favor of his t-shirt and joggers. He headed downstairs and flooed over to the Burrow.
He took the longest shower in the history showers, and found, much to his pleasure, that the auror was gone when he flung the curtain open.
I’m on Tumblr at @/ appalyneinstitute1 if y’all want to go check my blog out. I take Drabble requests there if you have an interest.
Molly Weasley was a lot to take in, with her wild red hair and her patchwork dress that had at least twelve various patterns. She’d come bustling into the dorm room, closely followed by her son, introduced herself to Draco immediately and wrapped him in a warm motherly embrace. “Er, I’m Draco.” He said awkwardly once they parted. The hug had been nice, though Draco would never admit it. But it made him miss his mother, so he pushed the thought from his head and turned to survey his new roommate.
Draco returned to his and Harry’s shared bedroom to find a passed out Harry and a note on Draco’s own pillow. He read it quickly, smiling faintly Harry’s hastily scribbled words. Draco wouldn’t be able to see Harry in the morning because he had hall duty and would be out early, but at least Draco would see him during Defense Against the Dark Arts. And they could talk tomorrow evening. How was it, that to Draco, tomorrow seemed years away?
He watched Harry making his way down the stairs, to him. When Harry reached him, Draco asked, “You helped me?”
He ate quickly and in silence. Professor McGonagall sat at the head of the staff table, with the new head of Slytherin, Professor Delacroix. Someone else was there, a younger Hufflepuff, but that was all. It was better this way, Draco thought. If he kept out of everyone else’s way, he had a higher chance of surviving this year.
Draco was so relieved he could have collapsed to the ground. He had to physically keep himself back from laughing at his own stupidity. He had never had any sort of trouble with break ins, and yet that was where his mind had first gone.
“You watch too many horror movies if you were scared by me knocking on your door.” Pansy drawled from where she had seated herself on Draco’s bed, right in the place Draco had just vacated.
“We’re gonna get you ready for your date, duh.” Said Ginny, who had moved to open his wardrobe and started tearing it apart.
He found the best available seat to be one of the study nooks and sat down, taking out his phone to fill out the application.
“The court is now out of session. An auror shall escort Mr. Malfoy back to Hogwarts.” Draco felt like crying when the chains that had been trapping him unraveled. He rubbed his arms, but didn’t stand.
With that said, would y’all be interested in reading a spin off of sorts? If so, what would you be interested in seeing? Let me know in the comments.
Draco was a nervous wreck. He hadn’t spoken to Harry at all since their ‘fight’ and now he had no idea what to expect. He paced back and forth in the hall. Nymphadora’s auror friend was back, she’d been the one to escort him here today, but she hadn’t been alone. Two other Aurora had joined them in Hogsmeade. The three of them seemed friendly with one another, but Draco wasn’t sure how that would translate over to him.
Harry sat on the floor by the end of the bed. They had joined it to one bed at some point in the past month after waking up to one of them nearly falling off one of the twin beds one too many times.
That wasn’t all that great of a response to Draco’s confession, but it was better than flat out hatred, and right now, Draco would take anything he could get with Harry. The next bit made it a tad better and Harry had apologized. Draco didn’t really think he had anything to apologize for, but still...
“That’s cute.” She smiled, “Okay I’m going Blaise don’t give me that look.” She grabbed her shoes that she had ditched at some point and headed out to the bookstore.
Pansy gave a little shrug before pulling him further into the room. “I don’t know, one of Brittany’s friends I guess. She said it was an open invite. Something about trying to get people to meet each other and make new friends.” She winced as they walked past a couple who were making out a tad too passionately for such a public location. Draco quickly averted his eyes as they girl’s skirt rode up just a bit too high.
“I got some of your favorites. If you wanna talk I’m here.” Draco whispered into Harry’s dark hair as he slung an arm gently around Harry’s shoulders and held up a bit of fruit to Harry’s lips.
Harry could hear groans from about a third of the class, “Relax, it’s not that bad, she made me take it too. And anyways, you knew that you were signing up to retake a year of school. I will be doing a practical test. Rooms two through five are with me to start.”
Draco nodded, “He saved me from Crabbe’s Fiendfyre and from a death eater just after, though that may have been Weasley.”
Azkaban wasn’t nearly as frightening as Draco had imagined it, nor as disturbing as renderings had depicted it. Draco chalked that up to the fact that the dementors had been removed from the premises. Draco was searched the moment he stepped inside. After several minutes, the guards seemed satisfied that he had nothing dangerous hidden away.
And standing before him, seeing him looking so… beaten down as he did… Draco’s instincts took over and he wrapped him in a hug, pulling him in close and trying to offer him any semblance of comfort.
“I was under the impression that I could testify as I please. Therefore I will tell you that I do not believe Draco has committed any serious crimes.”
“Voldemort cursed the position, the curse broke when he died, so Hermione and I could stay as long as we wanted.” Harry explained.
“My mum’s moved on to husband number eight. She really knows how to pick them, rich and old... or sick. I can’t see this one lasting very long.” Blaise said, his expression souring.
“My mother’s maiden name was Narcissa Black.” Draco said, “And my Aunt Andie would visit us when I was little, less so in the past few years. She married a man named Ted Tonks I believe.”
“Are you sure you want to go back?” His mother asked him. Her hands were shaking and her right was clasped tightly over her left forearm. Draco unconsciously mirrored her movement, covering his mark.
Once he served Draco his drink and his muffin the rest of the afternoon went well. He bought a sandwich before he left so he could eat dinner before Draco came over.
It wasn’t long before Blaise arrived with Neville and they started up a game of truth or dare that ended in Hermione and Pansy making out and Pansy offering up her phone number to Hermione. Draco wished he could have that courage as he was now sure he wanted to make out with Harry, and maybe even give him his phone number. But while Hermione had been dropping subtly hints to Pansy all night long, Harry had offered up nothing to Draco, leaving him more confused than ever.
He entered the chamber and nodded to Hagrid. Hagrid left to take his seat at they staff table. He turned to see a group of awestruck eleven-year-olds.
Ronald was tall, very, very tall. He had at least four inches on Draco- and Draco had never been considered short. Usually it was Draco who was towering over the rest, but it seemed that that would not be the case anymore. Ronald concealed his anger well in front of his mother, giving a polite smile and introducing himself as “just Ron.” They made quick work of Ron’s things, of which were much more personalized than anything Draco owned, and much more worn down. The Weasley family certainly wasn’t a very wealthy one.
“Okay your turn.” Draco said pulling Harry down and placing a box that was a bit bigger than the one he gave Narcissa.
Individually, Hermione moved around the room, sparring with each until she was satisfied that they had the basic grasp of it. Then she would pair them with someone else to spar amongst themselves. Draco had been so distracted watching her that he failed to notice as Harry sidled up to his side.
He made eye contact with Hermione across the hall, who was talking with Neville, as Ron went into a story of a quidditch match he had played in the snow with his brothers New Year’s Eve.
The wizard prompted him before he had even sat down completely, “Mr. Potter, can you begin by telling us all the times you interacted with Mrs. Malfoy beginning with the night you-know-who returned.”
A little under two hours later, Draco and Harry had finally made it to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom.
“I know what you need.” Harry looked around, most of the others had gone up already. He picked up the remote and flipped around on the channels they got until he found the movie he wanted, an animated kids movie.
So they were safe then. No one else would be bothering to pay them any attention. But still, Draco felt like he needed to let go. “Oh.” He said, trying to make it seem like he was only just noticing that his hand had crept into Harry’s. He pulled it away hastily. “Sorry.”
A calm silence settled over the kitchen for roughly the next hour, then people slowly started to trickle down the stairs to join them.
“After you left the party Ron and I had a big fight over me being on the quidditch team. He was being drunk and stupid, he thought I wasn’t good enough and that I should ‘stick to the books’ or some shit.”
“That’ll be right up.” Harry made the drinks quickly and plated the pastries, giving Hermione a chocolate cookie. He gave them their orders and proceeded to start closing the cafe.
“She’s just as smart as you’ve said, Harry.” Sirius smiled, “Oh! We got something for you.” He reached in the box Remus had just set down and pulled out a pink orange and white striped flag and handed it to her.
Draco shook his head, clearing the thought. He had more important things to worry about now. His trial was a week away and he was terrified. Who would be testifying and would they be for or against him. He feared that the majority would do the latter and he would be forced to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban. No one alive had been in the astronomy tower when Dumbledore had been killed, at least not anyone who would tell the truth.
“Yeah, sorry, I’m just running late and I really just fucked something up I think.” He darted over to his side of the room and grabbed up his tennis things for speeding across the campus, taking care to avoid any paths Harry might have taken. He ended up going around the long way, making him very late to tennis.
“I was sitting under the stairs, I tried to pull you under there with me.” Draco said, “I’m sorry, I had no idea.”
With the trial out of the way the eighth years first quidditch match came rather quickly. They were set to play the Gryffindors, captained by Ginny this year. Harry was actually really excited for the game regardless of that pre game pit in his stomach.
Was Harry avoiding him? Or was Draco just being paranoid? Draco wouldn’t put it past himself to be being absurdly paranoid. It wasn’t as though he hadn’t done it before.
Neville was quickly followed by Blaise, who’s patronus was a snake, then Hannah whose was a horse of some sort.
He went to a little jewelry shop to buy some nice, but not overly expensive earrings for Hermione, who had decided to get a second set of piercings over the summer. He also got a nice pin for Mrs. Weasley, and an everblooming flower crown for Luna. Next he meandered towards Zonko’s for something for Ron. He had already ordered a Muggle dart board for Ginny, a set of watercolors for George who had taken up painting in the wake of Fred’s death, and some Muggle records (including ones in French) for Bill and Fleur who already had a record player. He had gotten both Mr. Weasley and Charlie Muggle radios. Though Mr. Weasley’s was the most modern design so he could have fun picking it apart and Charlie’s was more similar to the design of a Wizarding wireless.
“Yeah but I want to see if I can find upperclassmen that have taken them and ask their opinion tomorrow before we have to have selections submitted.”
The school year started again. Harry was able to return to Grimmuald most nights. He really only had to stay when he had hall duty, though if he was there late grading or had a student that wanted an early morning tutoring session he would stay the night. He had decorated his rooms to be an odd combination of the blue and green he and Draco had used with a few Gryffindor colors here and there.
“Draco, you’re drunk, go to sleep.” Harry tried, he wasn’t quite in the headspace for this conversation, not yet at least.
Pansy devoted herself wholeheartedly to flirting with Hermione, a task that surprisingly involved little drinking on Pansy’s end. Draco didn’t mind though. When she wasn’t looking he kept sneaking sips from her cup, rather than getting himself another. The four of them made light conversation- just surface level stuff- and Draco found that Harry was rather pleasant company.
This was as it always was, yea after year, these two schools battling it out to see who would land on top. Every year Cadence University fell just a little bit short of victory, and this year was no different.
“When I was little she had cancer and was able to fight it off, but now it’s come back. My father says that he wants me to transfer to a school closer to home at the end of the semester. I want to be closer to her, but I can’t just up and leave here. Besides, Mom was supportive of me coming here, father was not.”
“You don’t have to tell me more about them today you know, if it’s too much. Just tell me what you’re comfortable telling when you’re comfortable telling it.” Harry nodded, as Draco continued. “It seems you’ve got a lot of hurt in your past, I just want you to know that I love you, and I’m here for whatever you need.”
Afterwards Draco headed back to the hotel room he was sharing with Harry for a shower and a bite to eat. When he stepped out of the shower he toweled himself off and pulled on a pair of jeans and a tee shirt before heading out into the bedroom. “You know,” Harry said from his place on one of the beds before Draco had even fully walked into the room, “It’s only noon.”
“It’s okay Draco. Really. Thinking about them doesn’t hurt as much as people think it does. I really don’t remember them enough to truly miss them.”
“Mr. Corner and Mr. Finch-Fletchley.” Nothing truly to note there other than they looked as though they were a year behind, which they were.
No, this was not his home. This was a prison, that he had grown to loathe over these past few years.
“I didn’t know you were good at cooking.” Draco said to his mother just after he had swallowed the last bit of food.
They had had this conversation before, several times in fact. And he had gone back and forth in his mind, having the same argument with himself. But he needed to finish his education. So here he was, walking through the barrier and onto platform nine and three quarters.
Daphne shook her head, embarrassed. “Well, anyway, mum spent the entire holiday trying to convince her to stay. See, Trace won’t take any of my parents money, so she’s real poor. Mum and dad don’t like that she’s wandering Albania aimlessly with some random person who she’s just met and no money.”
When he was in the stairwell off of the second floor, the top boxes were scooped right off of his pile. He turned to find his best friend, Pansy, standing there, her arms filled to the brim with his boxes. She turned without a word and started up the stairs. He quickly followed behind. “I cannot believe you are still bringing up boxes Draco, I mean really, how much did you pack?”
Draco hurried on to his own room and dumped the boxes on the ground beside the rest. They were all in the center of the room- he still had yet to claim a side, waiting on his roommate’s arrival. He didn’t want to be rude by just forcing Ronald to take whichever side he didn’t select, but if Ronald didn’t arrive soon, Draco would be forced to choose one- at least for the night.
Draco had to physically hold back the scoff that threatened to bubble to the surface. Did Harry honestly think he was scared? Draco was about to tell him just how wrong he was when Harry slid a little closer to him, pressing right up against his side and Draco’s brain just… stopped. It was like he was short circuiting or something. It took him a moment to draw back his thoughts and then he realized something. If he could make Harry think he was genuinely scared, then maybe they could end up like Pansy and Hermione, limbs tangled together, happy in their relationship with one another. Secure in the knowledge that they cared for each other.
“Aside from not wanting to sit near a bunch of people who will try to thank me for being a hero or some shit? Maybe I just want a quiet breakfast with my boyfriend.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and kissed his cheek.
He bought himself a latte before his two classes for the day and only half paid attention until they were dismissed and he was free for the rest of the day. He hurried to find Pansy and dragged her away from a very annoyed looking Hermione, then they found Blaise in the dining hall for a quick bite to eat.
Harry panted and sat up. He lit his wand and went over to the window seat. The nightmare had felt so real, aside from the way it changed over and over. He opened the curtains and sat in the window. He turned his head towards the sky, it was a stormy night and he could see lightning off in the distance. If it weren’t for the thunder, which sounded eerily like Hogwarts falling apart during the battle, the storm would be extremely relaxing. Once he thought of this, he cast a sound barrier around him to keep the noise out of his head. He fell into a restless sleep in the window seat, looking out at the lightning.
“I’msorryIwasatotalidiotIshouldhavetrustedyouIloveyou.” Draco said without a breath, almost too quickly for Harry to comprehend the last part.
“I mean, it had been months of not hearing anything from you, then suddenly, you’re found by snatchers and You-Know-Who is on his way to get you. You decide to flee, and then like a week later, we are here at the battle. Why not confront him at the manor? Why not kill him long before that? There must be a reason.”
“What, so you’re just going to ignore my mother?” Draco asked, his nerves showing through as irritation. He climbed into the shower with his clothes still on and pulled the curtain closed. He chucked his clothes over the side, hoping to hit the auror with though. He missed, probably for the best though, otherwise the auror could have had him charged for assault.
He stepped inside, closing the door gently behind him with his foot and dumped the box with everything he’d brought up onto the desk. The rest was in his car, but he wouldn’t bring it all up until his roommate arrived, hopefully with a parent who would help them both with unpacking. He pulled out the packet he’d received once he’d committed to Timber Coast University and scanned it, looking for his roommates name. He always forgot things when he was nervous, and he was especially bad with names. After a minute of searching, he finally located the name; Ronald Weasley. It was a peculiar name, but no more so than his own was.
He sighed and scrolled through his instagram for a bit, finally making a post of a picture of him and Hermione together from earlier that day, saying he was settled in. He set an alarm for seven am the next day, planning to get in a morning run before the campus truly woke up.
The day of Malfoy’s trial arrived. As it was on a Friday he and Hermione canceled all of their classes. Harry would go to the trial and Hermione could get in some time to herself, or maybe to her and Ron.
They also got their campus maps, student ID’s, which functioned as meal cards, and those who hadn’t requested a roommate or had not met the early deadline got room assignments.
Harry headed down early to make the popcorn. He had volunteered mostly because many of the others were terrified of burning it and setting off the smoke alarms.
Draco’s heart leapt inside of his chest and he had the urge to put a hand on Harry’s face and kiss him until the movie ended. But, luckily for them both, Draco still had a little more self control left. So he merely shrugged off the offer with another muttered, “Idiot.”
P.S. For those of you who are in school(or literally just alive in this cursed year), I know things are super stressful right now (for Appie and I as well) so just remember to step back and take a breath every once in a while. We love you all. <3
Harry let Malfoy make the first move, the Slytherin sending out a few non verbal jinxes in rapid succession. Harry batted them away and went on the attack with a few jinxes of his own. Malfoy easily put up a very strong shield, and sent out a petrifucis totalus from behind it. Harry narrowly avoided the jinx and as he was settling back into his feet, Draco had disarmed him.
Her hands were on her hips and she looked as though she were about to start scolding him. It reminded him vaguely of his mother and his heart warmed. He immediately liked her. “Do you want any help with those? Surely you can’t be unpacking everything on your own.”
“I have something other than just sitting in the Great Hall planned. I’m not dumb enough to realize that’s not a particularly exciting date.”
There wasn’t a party when they returned. The former Slytherins pulled Draco aside to talk details, and hear the verdict. Harry wandered to their room, while Draco caught up with his friends.
His father wouldn’t accept that answer, he was too anxious to get into the Dark Lord’s good graces again. “But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!” Why couldn’t his father understand that Draco didn’t want to be a part of this?
“It was on Halloween. I had actually fallen asleep in my costume. I was a lion that year, my best friend next store had been a prince and we went trick or treating together. Someone broke into my parent’s bedroom, we still don’t know who or why. They killed my father and my mum had called the police and the killer ran. She was pretty traumatized after that, still is. He died from a cut throat.
“And do you miss me?” Draco asked, turning the key in the doorknob of his dorm room and shouldering the door open.
The day finally came for the students to share the research questions they had come up with. Harry and Hermione sat side by side on the teacher’s desk in the defense classroom as the rest of the eighth years filed in. Before they started the class Harry had an announcement to make.
“Oh really? Please don’t make it too hard, I’m pretty sure no one has the brain capacity for that.” Draco said, still groggy as they slid from the bed. Draco padded across the room and into their bathroom to brush his teeth. Should he shower today?
It didn’t matter that he had always hoped that one day he would be reunited with his long lost friend and now he had been.
“Yes, we’re friends. That came out wrong, I’m just really kind of freaking out right now because I keep getting insanely cryptic phone calls from my parents. One telling me constantly that I need to come home and the other telling me to stay away and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what’s going on with them and I don’t know whether or not I need to be worried.”
A soft tune played from a phonograph in the corner, Harry had pulled Daphne Greengrass aside one day to ask about Draco’s music taste. He had found a record with a bunch of good date songs that were both wizard and Muggle, the Wizarding ones including some of Draco’s favorites, according to Daphne.
The beginning of the week was quite nice. Harry spent his time working on odds and ends around Grimmuald Place or hanging out at the Burrow. He was still getting used to the idea of being independent and not needing to stay with anybody. He rather liked to escape to the solitude of Grimmuald place when he felt like he was exhausted from being around people at the Burrow. Though he wouldn’t mind living with another person, so long as it was one person.
“Well, I was leading and had only had a crash course. I’d let you lead this dance. From what I’ve seen you must have had some dance lessons growing up.”
“Does anyone know who the new teachers are gonna be this year?” Asked Neville, breaking the tension.
Harry stepped back and left the room, he now had to go tutor some fifth years who were nervous for OWLs.
“Thank you for being so awesome.” Harry mumbled once he had finished his portion of the meal. He moved closer to Draco, and buried his face.
“Fine.” Draco’s worry didn’t leave him, but it did ebb slightly. He let out a long calming breath and watched as the others made their patronus’s appear and move around the room before fading into air and mist.
Okie doke, here’s my chapter! I’m on vacation right now, so excuse if it’s a little rough! I haven’t gone through and proof read it at all. Sorry! Hope you enjoy it anyways! Love you all!
“Your wand alarm went off,” Draco said coolly. He was proud of how even his voice was, how calm he sounded.
He set up a word document on his computer and named it green. It became a sort of dumping ground for all things Harry related. Every little thing that Harry mentioned liking or being interested in went into the document. Within those initial two weeks of brainstorming, Draco filled pages and pages with things Harry had said and did. Thousands of words dedicated to planning out their special date.
Quite graciously, (and very Gryffindorly) Harry offered to grade half of Hermione’s remaining exams. Draco, though he complained throughout the entire thing, assisted Harry in completing them too. In all, it took six days for them to get it all done, leaving them with the final three for themselves.
It was another half hour until Harry saw the snitch, this time it was hovering in the middle of one of the goals. Harry zoomed towards it and went through the hoop as he grabbed it. He held it up and went back down to the field.
“And yes to Hogsmeade, it sounds fun.” Draco continued, “Although you need to work on your Valentine skills, I would have expected something a little more cutesy from you.”
It was nearly a half hour later that Hermione came into the room, subdued and crying. “Can I come stay with you tonight? I just ended it with him, it just wasn’t working.”
Harry tore into the gift and found an expensive looking jewelry box. He opened it and pulled out two necklaces. “Necklaces?”
Draco didn’t know what to do with himself. It was too early to go down for breakfast, too late to go back to sleep. He could’ve gone back to sleep, there technically was enough time, but he was too awake to manage it in time to get any real sleep. So, he preoccupied himself by staring at Potter’s sleeping form.
“I don’t know yet, I always wanted to be an auror, well ever since fourth year that is. Crouch Junior, the death eater, was actually the one to suggest it to me in the first place. And I don’t know, it just kind of stuck. But now, I really like teaching, its just a lot. Especially If Hermione decides to move on to something else. Then I would have to teach all by myself, and I am not sure if I am ready for that. But do I really want to be a co-teacher for the rest of my life? It’s just odd, it’s an odd situation. But I still have six months to figure it out, so we will see.”
Hey all I actually wrote this before Friday! What a concept!! Got some interesting stuff for y’all this week.
“It’s eight right now, which means plenty of time. Besides weren’t you gonna go set up before curfew?” Hermione asked.
“The police figured out they’re connected. And that it’s not just people wanting to steal from the rich.”
Harry had offered to go with him, but Draco had declined, this was something he needed to do on his own. His mum understood that and stayed back too. So, when he set off for Azkaban, it was just him and Jess. He was glad to have her with him, she was not easily fazed and she would make sure he went through with it and didn’t back out. Not only that but she had seen his father since he’d been locked up and she could offer some insight as to how he’d been since he’d been sentenced to life in that prison.
The initial questions like name, date of birth, and things like that were easy. Then there was work experience, he had worked in a local restaurant as a waiter during junior and senior year. There was a spot for awards and volunteer experience, and finally why you want to work at Rise and Grind, and what you would bring to the team.
