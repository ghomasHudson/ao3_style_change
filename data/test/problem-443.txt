“And then the house – that was the only place I really could be. The only place where I wouldn’t be a danger to anyone. So I was stuck there, and people suggested I should fix it up, and it’s not like I had anything else to do, so that, that…” he trails off. He searches for Draco’s eyes, and Draco’s too shocked to avoid him. “When you said that, about never forgetting the war. That – I understand that, I guess is what I’m trying to say. How everything is still about that.”
“Why would he bother going, then?”
“Same reason I don’t play cards with a buy-in under a thousand pounds.”
“As I said, good morning. Welcome to the Vanishing Department.”
“I can.” Draco hesitated, and not because he couldn’t. “Whether I will depends on the rest of our negotiation.”
“Thank you,” Draco said. “Though I’ve really just provided the venue.”
In toiletries he adds a shaving set to his pile, admiring the sharpness of the blade. Whoever’s lost this knows how to keep a razor. It’s a skill Draco would like to develop.
“No,” he breathes.
“When did that stop being surprising?”
“Pardon?”
Potter nodded again.
by Zora Benthurst. He’s probably got more robes on under his robes. And even if he doesn’t, even if it’s, say, just a pair of pants, maybe silk boxers or – he stifles a grin – leopard print Y-fronts, he probably looks the same in them. He’s probably as stiff and decorous naked as he is in his uniform, and wouldn’t that be a sight? Draco Malfoy in his pants, at the front desk,
And Potter will want him for a quick shag now and then, and won’t that be glorious. Merlin, he wants Potter bound again, wants him tied to a headboard, his legs spread, that gorgeous cock in his mouth. Wants Potter shooting down his throat this time.
“I did, but…” He looked back to the ex-bread.
ed. “One never knows.” She leaned back and folded her arms. “Besides which, I happen to think Mind Healing is perfectly respectable.”
to live like a Squib? You can’t possibly like it in here.”
“Yes.”
I asked if he was sure, if he wouldn’t rather it the other way round. He shook his head, said no, but yes, he was sure.
Harry groans and sinks down, and Draco is there to meet him. He relaxes his throat and takes Harry in, and he can feel the moan that resonates through Harry. “Fuck, Draco.”
Mirrors. It made sense, now he could see it.
He’s left breathless, pulling back only out of necessity, resting his forehead against Draco’s. The exhalation comes, unbidden. “Fuck, I missed you.”
“You were given the material to blackmail Harry Potter and you took that opportunity to get a date?”
“Sometimes?”
He didn’t look back, but heard their footsteps follow him down the hall, past the end of the void, and into the library.
fall into one of those categories?”
Draco waited until he was out of earshot. “That was a surprise.”
Draco returns the nod, buoyed by Harry’s warm fingers between his own, and lets himself be guided to the bar.
“In what world can you guarantee that? You’re an Auror, not a reporter.”
The moment I pushed into him…that’s the face I’ll always remember. There was moment of pain, a choked gasp, all to be expected I suppose. I stilled and let him adjust. And then he had his hands on my back and was pulling me into him, and the look on his face was awe and newness and wonder, and then pleasure when I started to move.
“Yes,” Draco drawls.
“Thank you. I’ll send an owl with the details as the date approaches.”
Pansy looked at him, considering.
“Answered letters. And…dates.”
He looks to Blaise for backup, but he’s only got eyes for Pansy. Draco sees him squeeze her hand and tries not to feel the pang that’s settling in his stomach at the sight of them, his two best friends, madly in love. Though whether this ache is for Potter or his friends, he’s not sure. The chances he could keep all of them have always been infinitesimal, and it’s no small part of the reason why this madness with Potter has been a non-starter. Still is a non-starter.
He lowered his glass. “Because Potter is an idiot.”
Draco, coming back. Relieved to know it’s not all brusqueness and
Draco felt the urge to sag against something. Mirrors were not conducive. He held himself straight. “I want to try. If I had known what I know now, who I know now, I never would’ve believed any of it. If I had known what Muggles were capable of—the good things, not just the destruction—it never would’ve made sense. It would have seemed ridiculous when my father said what he did, or when the—when other people did. I could never believe that now. They amaze me.”
Harry really doesn’t know why they don’t tell him these things beforehand. The element of surprise? Seeing how well the cloak and its users will adapt in the field? Some weird desire to
Granger rolled her eyes.
“Fun? Vaguely. Are we counting the times he was a complete tit but we loved him anyway?”
“You’re dismissed.”
“It’s not rocket science. Arithmancy. Whatever. This is not that hard, Draco!” He’s yelling. Properly yelling, his face flushed and his eyes red.
Except it went on another minute, and another.
Draco pressed his finger forward. “I’m going to be inside of you,” he whispered, making good on the promise. His finger slipped past the tight ring of muscle and he bit back a groan when he felt Potter’s arse, warm and smooth, around his finger. He slid out, and back in. “So deep inside of you.”
“Don’t joke with me.”
“Er,” Potter starts. “Uh.” His eyes dart to Draco’s chest and widen. “Uh.”
“Or variations in colour or scent. But I do expect it will be flowers each time, or at least plants.”
And bragging, of course. She natters on endlessly these days. Today it’s about Finch-Fletchley, as though that’s anything special. Rode him till he popped, etc. etc.,
Harry, who is stunning in emerald green robes that do astounding things for his eyes. Harry, who smiles at him and asks if he’d like to come in.
Potter stared at him, stone-faced.
Something welled up in his chest. He could imagine that the room might have been full, once. People might have had merry dinners around the sort of table that could’ve fit inside. They, whoever they were, might’ve filled the room with light and sound and warmth. But all of it was gone; it was a room he couldn’t enter.
“No,” Draco found himself apologising. “A bit tired.”
“Welcome to the Vanishing Department.” Draco quirks an eyebrow. “How may we help you?”
“I’ll argue the point after. Jacket?”
Harry goggled. “I didn’t do anything to it! Or you, for that matter!”
Draco bends his knees and jumps. He doesn’t fall, and it takes Harry a long moment to realise what he’s seeing. Draco, suspended over the ground, without a broom.
“It’s not—” Draco stopped. It wasn’t worth the argument. “Look, Potter. Usually in wizarding museums and galleries, curators and gallerists rely on the paintings themselves to report back in case of theft. The artist paints a small replica or extension of the original, which remains in a locked vault until the work is purchased, in which case it goes with the new owner. If the original contains a person, the replica doesn’t need to; in case of a landscape or still life, the replica will extend the subject of the original and include some sort of portrait. If the painting is stolen, the person who’s been painted into the world of the work can travel to and from the replica to tell the owner or, in the case of a public institution, a designated steward, who has stolen the work and where it’s being kept.”
“Yes,” Draco breathed, coming a step closer. He reached out a hand and hooked his index finger around Harry’s. “But I have to—”
While I’ve normally got to keep my goings-on to the bedroom, the eighth years are allowed to leave at the weekends. Provided we’re not on probation, in which case outings require Ministry approval, only granted for familial visitation and good works. This particular weekend has everyone occupied elsewhere, save yours truly, which leaves me with the whole tower to myself.
“Okay. I needed to know.”
He pushes open the door. The office is empty. He feels something about that, though he’s not sure what. He doesn’t want to stand around ringing the bell again, but he also doesn’t want to risk Malfoy’s ire by just going into the back.
"Very well. Have you brought the list of names?”
The thought disappeared as soon as he opened the door to the kitchen.
“Take me in your mouth.”
“You know. Love, care. The really important things. Those don’t depend on magic.” He ruffled the fur on one of the kitten’s hindquarters. “Kittens, chocolate, sunny days, hot tea. There’s a lot in the world that doesn’t come back to magic. And I figure, if you are right and I can’t go back to work, I’ll have the time to take care of them.”
Draco turns it inside out, looking for imperfections.
He wasn’t waiting more than a minute. They stumbled toward the beach together, stopping for a grope or two but otherwise determined and deliberate about their intended destination. Draco held out his arm as soon as they were out of view and Apparated them both to the foyer.
Harry caught Malfoy’s eye again. He thought he saw something there. He wanted to.
Greg nodded. “They do.”
Slowly, so slowly, he trailed his index finger around and over Potter’s hole. When he slipped inside, it was Potter who took him there, who canted his hips so that Draco’s finger slipped into his rim, and Potter who pushed down until his fingertip was inside. He didn’t need more of an invitation. He slid halfway in and, at Potter’s moan, all the way.
Harry jumped back, shocked. He'd forgotten about Malfoy's hidden wand pocket. Stupid, that. Not that he'd admit it. "What the fuck, Malfoy?"
“Yeah,” Harry mused, stepping into the hallway, his shoulders relaxing as he left the void. “It was. And the same thing with the others, too. I always thought I’d be miserable if I skipped one. Wracked with guilt, unable to do anything else, just thinking about the kids, or the Crups, or whatever. And I did think about them.” He lowered his voice, sounding a bit embarrassed. “I had Gringotts send over a bunch of Galleons.” After a second, he cleared his throat and went on. “I do still want to help. It just wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be.”
“Funnily enough, I haven’t got much of an appetite.” She glared.
“What?”
I’ve just sent off my registration form for the Ministry’s “Weekend of Commemorative Service.” Vomit. But it’s one way to get around this on-campus probation requirement, and Potter’s sure to be there. In addition to posting signs in the common room, he’s been touting it in this week’s
Confusion crosses his features. “Isn’t it...what else is there?”
“A manner of speaking?”
It shouldn’t have been as difficult a question as it was. “We went to school together.”
“Yes,” Draco said. “He flew back. Instead of south.”
he’d almost said.
- Sexual favours
“I haven’t set foot on British soil in almost a decade. I don’t mean to start now.”
The obvious existence of that not-insubstantial erection made Potter’s behaviour even more mystifying. Perhaps a Gryffindor could be forgiven for failing to see how such a circumstance might have been mutually beneficial, but weren’t they supposed to charge ahead even without such basic calculations? Rather than practically tripping over their own feet in the rush to leave?
“Of course.”
Though “generous” is not a concept Draco’s particularly concerned with when he realises who he’s looking at. The height, the dreadlocks, the line of a face caught in profile. Oh, yes. He can certainly work with this. It’s material for the front of the section. Probably would be even if Lee Jordan hadn’t turned him down in favour of the WWN.
Harry’s eyes flew open. “What was it?” He asked even before he’d had a chance to look.
“Towards the end his house elf picked it up whilst cleaning, wound up Imperiusing himself and, essentially, the Wand made him bring Potter home. He was in the middle of a stakeout.”
Draco’s barely processed the tremendous, echoing racket, or what it means for his workload, when he realises it would be wise to duck.
Harry stopped him before they could descend onto the grass below. “I can’t be gone too long,”
“Pansy.” Draco turned towards her so quickly he pushed his chair aside in the process. “Where did you hear that?”
"I was thinking maybe we could try implementing a different protocol for their return. One not usually available to the public."
“Yeah,” Harry answered softly.
“It should leaf normally. No harm done.”
“Doesn’t it also answer them?
“Ogden’s, 12 year, rocks,” I repeat. “That’s what you want.”
Draco cups Potter’s cock and trails his fingers towards the head. He has to fight off a wave of dizziness at the sounds Potter’s making. He steels himself, his free hand gripping Potter’s bound arm for support.
All that’s left, then, is to figure the damn thing out.
The feeling of his legs against mine was as thrilling as the meeting of our chests. His skin…I don’t expect to ever have enough of it.
“I like how you taste.”
’ But then he thought, too, ‘
“In part because I’d like to reduce the amount of time you spend in the void. There can be long-term complications and you’ve already spent over a month primarily or entirely in magic-free spaces, either at the Department of Mysteries or here.”
“Fine.”
“Why do you want to go back, then?”
He is fine, but he’s not
“Yes.”
“No.” Harry turned to begin the walk back. “I’m cold.”
“That’s tomorrow.” The pitch of his voice went up just enough to give it a hint of panic.
“Wow.”
He’s on his way to water the plants when Draco notices a new arrival. He diverts his course immediately.
She slid the book out from under his hands. “I’m going to suggest that you step away. Take a break. Come back to this with fresh eyes.”
“I’m allergic to gingers.”
Harry freezes. Malfoy’s eyes aren’t straying from his face, but what if they do once he moves? What if Malfoy’s planning something? But standing still is probably just making it worse. This has to be the kind of story Malfoy will tell for ages. He can imagine the headline now, “Harry Potter, Down to His Pants, Requests Bureaucratic Service.”
“Yes, I can see how thoroughly selfless that was.”
“Precedent? Other photos, you mean?”
“What—? Why—?” Harry glances to the poker and back up to Draco’s impressively stoic face. “What are you doing here?”
Aside from wanting to host it, Draco tried to pay very little mind to the WWN Breakfast Show with Lee Jordan. If he was honest, it didn't even take very much trying. He loved hosting his own show - loved the rhythm of it, the focus it demanded, the way it kept him totally present and conveniently out of his own head for hours at a time, loved that sounding calm and in command made him feel that way, loved that he'd been able to double his show's listenership even in the graveyard of a time slot he'd got stuck with, loved the daily reminder that he'd crawled his way back to being someone people wanted to tune in for. But Lee was far more upbeat than anyone, even a radio presenter, had a right to be before noon, and while it might've been done under the auspices of Muggle-friendliness the Breakfast Show's practice of stealing gimmicks from their BBC counterparts was, in Draco's opinion, terribly gauche. Though Draco's opinion didn't matter especially much when he was, technically, contractually, obligated to sit opposite his fellow hosts from time to time and perform tricks like some sort of trained Crup in the name of cross-promotion.
“And it’s a bastion of goodness now?” I held my breath while he considered. It was entirely possible that Potter hadn’t picked up a Prophet in months and even more likely that he avoided the political reporting hidden in the back pages.
the time, you know? Could just have five minutes off to be…” He sighed. “Whatever. I’d really like to see what could happen between us.”
He isn’t offered a drink. He isn’t offered a seat. He isn’t sure whether Potter’s just that rude, or making him uncomfortable intentionally. Harry had told him, once, as they’d lain across the bed upstairs, that he’d almost been sorted Slytherin. Draco can see it.
“Between, thanks.”
Anger. Of all the possibilities, Harry had not been expecting that. “I – What? Did I do it wrong? Is there, um, some proper pureblood way I’m supposed to ask?”
He picked up the files and rifled through them aimlessly. Tried alphabetising, then reverse alphabetising. It didn’t work. He wasn’t the least bit distracted.
“No.” Draco folded his arms.
He shoots up, then leans forward, urging the Firebolt to move him through the space between the shelves and the ceiling, avoiding the obstacle of the aisles altogether. Once over the last aisle he dives almost directly into Harry’s path and they both veer sharply, barely avoiding a collision.
“It’s in the records,” Granger answered. “But if I remember correctly it’s been at least a month.”
I’d wonder if he was hitting the unicorn horn too, but his neck was sans chain. Just naked skin, tan and soft and covered in fine, dark hair at the base of his neck. And he never would.
“That’s it,” I answer, rubbing the backs of his thighs. “Relax.”
He was almost surprised—almost, but not quite—when Harry took it in his own hands and pulled it off, balling it in his hands between them.
“The Vanishing Department makes every effort to maintain the confidentiality of client requests. In the interest of serving the next client, we ask people who have received their items to leave the premises as soon is possible.”
“No.” I take a step forward, fingers tightening around him. “Exactly the opposite.”
Harry stood, walked around the table, and wrapped her in his arms. Draco thought he saw the hint of a sob as she gripped him back, and they stood like that for some time.
If he couldn’t have expected Potter’s delight, he also couldn’t have expected Potter’s embarrassment. Yet he was fairly certain that was what it was. The light in Potter’s eyes had practically exceeded his wandlight, but as soon as he’d seen Draco he’d looked like a child with his hand caught in the cookie jar, like he was expecting to be punished. That had quickly been replaced with his familiar scowl and a white-knuckled tightening of his fist around his wand. Potter’s familiar anger, back again. And then they’d been plunged into relative darkness with Potter’s
“If we could, we most certainly would!” McGonagall turned the full force of her gaze on Harry. “However, as you may well recall, students are not so easily thwarted when it comes to discovering Hogwarts’ secrets. On Tuesday Mr. Filch caught half the Gryffindor Seventh Years hissing at fixtures in the girls lavatory. Last month it was the Slytherin prefects. If Granger and Malfoy say they’ve got a solution, it would be irresponsible to ignore it.”
Except… He thought of Malfoy as he walked. Of Malfoy, with his pink cheeks and his glazed eyes and his ‘leave it on.’ With his insistence that everything had to be a fight, with his bravado, with his Diffindo. Malfoy, with his bound hands and his breathless ‘please.’
Not this time, though. Harry tries to duck around him, but Malfoy’s got a fist in his jumper before he can pull clear. Instead of a clean dodge Harry goes down hard, forms flying everywhere.
“It’s not exactly inspirational, poking around there like your healer.”
Draco turns to face the window. “If it’s even necessary. There must be dozens of men who can testify to the particulars of your technique.”
“Draco.” Millie’s voice softened. “It’s not as though Shacklebolt can give you detention. He wants to meet with you. He has good reasons. Reasons that might be of interest to you. That’s all I can say.”
Harry didn’t look like he had any idea what to make of that.
The heavy thud of Potter’s boots punctuated every thought that came to him. He needed it to stop, needed to be able to clear his head.
Malfoy shook his head, still pale, and looking wary to boot. “Muggle security system.”
He can hear Harry land on the broom. Hears him grunt as he always has, without even realising it, when he reseats himself after some insane trick. Hears the broom pick up speed and fade into the background. He’s not worried that Harry’s been hurt.
“I could hug you.”
them without responding—and feels even worse. And really, that’s another reason it won’t work. He’s not courageous like Harry. Not a Gryffindor bone in his body.
“Fuck, Draco. All of this, I thought maybe, after all this waiting...but no.” Potter laughs again, and this time it’s a cracked, half-empty sort of a sound. “You still can’t.” He sighs. “Maybe you never will.”
“And in exchange?”
“Yes,” Harry promised. “Do I just—?” He lowered himself back on an elbow.
And then he tucks into himself and he’s turning up again, the gold-green grass flashing by in a blur as he corrects himself. He opens his mouth to let out a victory whoop.
“That it’s not a choice. Not my choice, anyway.” Draco’s voice is rising alongside his ire. “That it’s a sentence.
Potter gaped.
“Want you to give it to me,” Potter mumbled, half into his arm.
“Malfoy?” Harry said. He barely recognised his own voice. It was a low growl, half whisper, half demand.
“No.” Potter shook his head. “It’s fine. Do you need anything else?” He grabbed his shirt from where he’d dropped it on the slate and pulled it back over his head.
Millie sighed and opened the folder. “Subject: Harry James Potter, born July—”
“Sounds like heaven.”
“I’m afraid you’ve reached a juncture where it’s unavoidable. Either you find a way to express whatever it is you’ve been holding in, or you leave and risk being killed, or you, I don’t know, disappear into the Department of Mysteries, never to be seen again.” He wasn’t above the low blow. “I doubt Molly Weasley would be overjoyed about any of those.”
It followed him home, too. He didn't stop for a drink. He barely ate. He nearly stubbed a toe pacing in front of the hearth and was moments away from calling Millie and demanding answers when his fireplace leapt to life.
Draco’s pupils were almost black when his eyes met Harry’s. They both stilled.
when you wake up, but I really want to talk to you right now, and I don’t know how else to do it.
“Good.” Potter rose. “When can I get the records?”
Harry chuckled. “Thanks.” He took another long drink of water and looked for a place to set it down.
“For Merlin’s— There’s no need for that, Potter. Nor is it helping our cause.”
Fair enough. But the Ministry types weren’t meant, and hadn’t wanted, to be seen. He sighed. “The music room, you said?”
Granger gave Shacklebolt a look so pleading that Draco almost scoffed.
“Lovely. Come fuck my face.”
"Except your insults, sense of humour, and pride, you mean?" Harry knew he was pushing his luck, that it was the sort of thing that might make Malfoy explode. He just wasn't sure whether he was hoping for it.
"Been there, done that." Malfoy moved his hand to his trousers, fastening them and then moving on to his shirt. Still, he did not turn around.
“Draco?” He turns back, and Draco is stunned by the open question written across his face. “Is it?”
“I’d say I was looking forward to it, but let’s not stretch credulity.”
“What? Harder what?”
an offer. The distance between an offer and a deal, however, is about as vast as the difference between our respective aptitudes for fashion.”
Draco felt a tug at his magic, perhaps even more powerful than it had been last time, and the leaf fell to the floor.
His chest emptied. He wouldn’t have been able to find enough air to sustain his objections even if he had the words for them.
He hums his approval around Harry’s cock, and that’s all it takes to get him moving.
Potter didn’t reply.
Robards picked up where Potter left off, and Draco had to force his attention back to the front of the room. “At best, we’ll catch the killer in short order. At worst, we’ll be in the same position we’re in now. Either way, we’re short on time and it’s high stakes stuff. Worth a shot, I’d say.”
Malfoy hummed. “Take a Severing Curse, for instance. Its effect is clear, but there are several different ones that build from the same basic magical function. If we can separate the strands of the curse, we might use them to provide Healers with a new tool. They can’t repair curse damage from Severing Curses at the moment, but if we could isolate the part of the curse that has to do just with cutting, rather than with cutting destructively, or cutting in a way that can’t be stopped, they might be able to. Curses respond to other curses in a way they don’t to healing magic, such that, for instance, using a modified curse might allow Healers to cut out a section of cursed bone and then regrow it using Skele-Gro, such that the curse damage is effectively cured.”
Harry turned it over, but there was nothing more.
It’s almost peaceful. Peaceful in a way Draco’s job hasn’t been since week 158, since before Potter’s pile of Hippogriff droppings made their appearance, since his days became consumed with helping Potter, or waiting for Potter, or trying to get twice as much done so he’s free on Potter days.
“We’re similarly aged white men of similar height and build, we have the same educational history, the same employer—”
There’s a woefully familiar look of stubbornness on Potter’s face. “No.”
“I’d like to think I can find better ways to do it than running out of the room.”
“I’m sure you handled it well, Galder. Is this why you’re soaking?”
The absurdity of that statement. As though everything in both of our lives hadn’t been designed for seriousness, as though we hadn’t just barely survived a war meant to destroy us both. As though we hadn’t both held death in our hands on numerous occasions.
“When you ask why I’ve done this… I’ve told the truth, whether or not you believe it. I can’t tell you that I’m always certain it’s unselfish. I can say, though, that it feels different to want peace. That what I want now, what I’m working for now—it feels different than anything before it ever has.”
Above him, Potter took a shuddering breath. It only made Draco want him more.
Though Pansy was always quick to remind him that a lifetime’s training in apathetic disdain hadn’t done much good for either of them.
Fortunately, they’re all deluded enough to believe going back to Hogwarts will have the desired effects. Reintegration, adjustment to post-war society, blah, blah, blah. It’s so much Hippogriff shit, of course.
shows 9:56. It’s early. He’s early. He came. Or maybe it’s someone else, maybe it’s a random customer and they’ll need something and Potter can just sit there, being baffling and waiting his turn.
Harry looked at him strangely. “I’m not sure whether that was a compliment.”
But the consequences of fisticuffs while on the job—particularly when unprovoked and directed at the person he’d been sent to help—weren’t worth it. Besides which, he was an adult. He knew better.
“Yes. The cat wandered on to the property at some point. Both parents did, I think. She’s not ours. You might as well.”
“Sheets?” Harry asks, adding, “Still haven’t felt the sheets.”
“Good.” Draco pulled closer next to him, and every few steps Harry could feel Draco’s hand almost brush against his own. “But,” Draco went on, “I didn’t just bring you out here for the scenery.”
Okay, maybe the “fuck” wasn’t quite in line with the mission, but he was fairly certain it was still an improvement.
He looked around and focused. The mirror-Malfoys were all dark outlines. Parts of them were ever so slightly too long and too lean, distorted slightly by concavity. They didn’t have features, or when they did they were fragmented or cast in shadow.
“Are you?” Draco arched an eyebrow at him.
“True, but that was the question I had in mind. I assume the answer isn’t ‘peppermints,’ especially if they’re not all they’re cracked up to be.”
Draco cut him off. “They’re house elves. They have plenty of protective magic. This is their forte. And frankly, they’d be offended if we brought in contractors.”
He whirled on the spot when it hit him. “What about the Wand? It was acting up before it was implanted. Dangerously so, right? What do you think will happen when you have to leave the magical world altogether? You can’t take it with you, you won’t be able to defend it. But if it’s the Department of Mysteries and starts behaving erratically, that’s dangerous as well.”
Trick panel, Malfoy had said. He pressed both hands to the wall, and then quickly pulled one of them back. His fingers were still coated in Malfoy. It had gone clear, but the light reflected, and his mind flashed back to the moment when—
They were both silent, moving towards the void by force of habit, until they reached the steps to the gardens. Then Harry spoke out of nowhere. “It’s the 9th.”
“Did you wear jeans to one of London’s premier financial institutions for safety, too? Or is that down to poor taste?”
Under his cloak, Harry’s fingers ached and his lips were numb. The sun had set with barely any colour. Just a long descent into grey, and then black.
The front office is unattended. He hasn’t finished labelling Harry’s items. He could use this time to dust things. This vantage point, even. That’s what he should be doing. Much closer to what he should be doing.
"Let's see it, then."
The night air hit him like a Bludger, but at least it did something to clear his head. He needed a walk, he decided.
“A bit of wand-waving would suffice for a wizarding audience, but for Muggles?”
He almost wavers when Potter wraps his fingers around Draco’s shaft. He wants to see. Merlin, he wants to see. Wants one more memory for the Pensieve, even if it’s better live, with the feeling of Harry’s calloused fingertips running over him, the particular pressure that only Harry manages perfectly every time.
It’s my turn to wince as I pull out of him. I’m so sensitive, so spent.
“No, I suppose not. That’s a lot of travel.”
, his mind suggested, in spite of his protestations—and reached for his wand. A quick
“I have, yes. I didn’t know you liked animals.”
“Some more than others, sir, but on the whole,” Higsbee puffs up, looking at least half a dozen times prouder than usual, “quite a lot.”
Harry couldn’t decide whether to keep up with Malfoy or wander off on his own. Malfoy didn’t seem bothered either way. Harry was, though; no matter what he chose, he felt itchy and restless and unsure of what was up or down. It had all seemed…soft, somehow. Intimate. That was confusing enough. To have it disappear through a doorway was like finding himself on the receiving end of a
“Fine. I want to know. Will you stop making that face and tell me?”
. He leans into Draco and, to his delight, Draco doesn’t pull away. Instead, he rests his hand on Harry’s thigh.
She raised a questioning eyebrow.
“Do you want a coat?”
“After three weeks, it’s possible that I’m looking forward to the Eurostar just to have two hours to spend alone together.”
Harry let out a breath.
In the interlude, while I recovered my breath, he asked if he could try instead. Remarkable, again…neither imperious nor uncertain. He wanted something and asked for it, but there was no leverage involved, nothing at risk if I’d said no. Though that didn’t come with any lessening of desire. His interest was clear, from the glances he kept casting towards my erection to the hand he had resting, at the ready, on my upper thigh. I assented. Lay back.
“But it is going well?” Mill asked, looking both concerned and hesitant.
Draco tries to conceal his shock. This was not anywhere in the range of reactions he’d anticipated. And he doesn’t want it back. Not at all. It’s a part of the past he’s happy to see gone. He just wants Potter to recognise that he knows what he’s talking about, that he doesn’t need any handouts, that maybe, just maybe, Draco has an expertise worth an iota of respect. “Of course not,” Draco spits. “That would be highly irregular.”
It was the only time in anyone’s recollection that he’d asked Padma if he could take some paperwork off her hands. She’d felt his forehead for a fever and sent him off with a stack of forms.
“Perhaps because I didn’t respond to it?”
“Yes?”
“In that case, and towards that end, we came to a tentative agreement, pending your approval. I will no longer be the lead on your case. In addition to the ethical concerns, and more importantly, really, a Mind Healer is better suited to determine where we go from here. I will contact a colleague for a list of Mind Healers with relevant expertise who can work with you on the fundamental cause of the issue. That can be done here, and privately, without informing Robards or Shacklebolt, or the Ministry more generally. You can, and should, select whichever of the Mind Healers on that list you feel to be most competent and trustworthy. You’re welcome to speak to or meet with all or some of them to figure that out. Once you’ve done that, he or she will work with you daily. You and I will continue to meet to…” Draco sighed. “Well, to see if there’s anything to all that stuff I made up to buy time with the Ministry. If you’re amenable, we’ll work on increasing your focus and control. As with our walks, time outside of the void and using magic will be broadly beneficial, but we will, in particular, be trying to see whether and how you can use the implanted Elder Wand. Again, we needn’t tell the Ministry. They’ll ask for reports, but I can put them off, at least for a while. The idea, with all of this, is to secure your ability to proceed privately with a more productive line of treatment. Is that agreeable?”
The door to the Vanishing Department is ten feet of dull grey metal. There’s nothing remotely inviting about it. Which might, maybe, be why Harry doesn’t want to open it. It just doesn’t look like it wants to be opened and who is he to argue?
“Anything else I ought to know before we meet again?”
Malfoy turned and fixed him with a piercing gaze. “What?”
He twisted his fist into Malfoy’s jumper and pulled Malfoy closer. They stumbled into the bannister. The clang of metal ricocheted down the stairwell and Harry barely noticed; Malfoy had moaned into his ear and caught his earlobe between his teeth. The sensation ran down his arms and he grabbed for Malfoy.
He leads Potter straight back towards the dais, unwilling to give anything away before he absolutely has to. They’re almost there before he takes a sharp turn to the left. Past office supplies, past musical instruments, past the start of kitchenware. There’s bakeware, crockery, glassware. As they reach knives, Draco continues, “I believe we have some unfinished business.”
He watched her leave, and sighed.
Potter hesitated for a moment, but shook his head.
“No harm in trying.” Draco reached down for another Roundway. “I’ll do it too, if you like.”
“It dims them automatically at one if no one’s turned them off manually. It makes the art less visible from the street. Wait a moment.”
Potter flushed at that, and Draco felt a twisting, visceral sort of satisfaction he hadn’t felt in years. “And what about that, Potter? Those other things you’re running from?” He smirked. “Or hiding from, as the case may be.”
He leaned in and pressed his lips to Malfoy’s.
“And yet Millie, who saw it, suggests otherwise. Mill?”
“Yes, sir. Mr Robards, an Auror, and myself. He knows the test is on.”
“Can you explain to the Wizengamot why, in spite of serving as one of the primary investigators at several relevant crime scenes, in spite of the pain so many wizarding families have felt at the loss of their loved ones at the hands of this killer, you would be unable to offer your professional opinion on the guilt of the accused?”
“You, no. Never you. But newsflash, Potter: it’s not always about you.”
I’m closer all the time, and this charity bit is the perfect next step.
“You told me so.”
“If it gets us somewhere. You do realise you’ll still have to stand?”
“So…?”
He breathed. In four, hold four, out four.
A bouquet of pink roses grew from the tip of his wand, interspersed with Lily of the Valley, each stem dripping in tiny, perfect flowers. An ivory ribbon came last, tying itself in a perfect bow around the stems before it fell, in perfect order, the few inches to the floor.
“Harder,” Harry repeats. “Yeah.”
“Whoa.”
He went off to work with a spring in his step. Granted, it felt a bit forced, but still. Spring.
They walked along in silence for another half block, crossing the Boulevard Saint-Germain to the Rue Saint-Jacques.
Harry follows his lead.
“Fuck the galas.”
Potter threw up his arms. “Seriously?”
Excitement stirred in Draco’s chest even as he narrowed his eyes. “Still holding a grudge, are you? You’ll sit through everyone else's requirements, but doing the exact same thing when I’m asking is a bridge too far?”
-- -- --
That’s not the point, though. Precision. Flips, spins. Everything Draco can do.
Malfoy found it first, pulling away to grin. “Who’s keen now, Potter?”
He takes a deep breath and, to my surprise, spreads his legs even further.
Harry pulls back, sits up, surprised. “You okay?” His voice, even laced with a hint of concern, is gruff and raspy.
“Bloody leave it,” Potter repeated, rolling his hips and grasping at the glass.
be done are not always the same thing,” Draco replied.
“Oh?” Draco focused on lifting his own glass.
“Rarely if ever.” Draco laughed, or tried to.
“You’ll just have to trust me.”
Each cell in Draco’s veins felt like it came to a stop, replaced with a fuzzy numbness that made it hard to speak. To figure out what even to say. “I.” He cleared his throat. “In some ways. I don’t think… It was hard to sort it all out. During a war, you know.” A laugh bubbled up, low in his throat. “Of course you do. That made it hard to think about those things much at all.”
Harry’s always been there, as a possibility if not a reality. All he needs to do is pull out his Pensieve or send someone on assignment and there Harry is. He’s seen him at balls, at pubs, at parties, at press conferences. Seen him out in Diagon Alley getting ice cream for his godchildren, shopping with friends. Among other things. He’s the Boy Who bloody Lived, for Merlin’s sake, and of course he would always be there.
“All the same spells again. Lumos to start, a patronus, levitation, and then I’ll ask you to end a spell of mine.”
“Mill, in all the years you’ve known him, and Granger, and Shacklebolt—are you sure it’s just been what’s in the file?”
.” He suppressed a smile when Croaker’s eyebrows rose, almost certainly against his will. “You’re welcome to review the results when they become available. You have my recommendation in the meantime.”
Draco was, very grudgingly, impressed.
Potter cleared his throat.
He dumped two vials of Dittany in the tub and turned on the taps, stripping off while he waited for it to fill. It was bliss, sinking into the tub. His skin cooled almost instantly, and he let go a breath he hadn’t realised he was holding.
Harry opened his eyes and stared down. “Wow.” He looked up. “Do I leave them? What do I—I don’t want to hurt them.”
He stands up. He’ll just ring it. Once. And then he can wait, and if Draco comes out and tells him he should’ve rung the damn bell, he can say that he had and Draco just hadn’t heard it.
“It’s a very stark, very noticeable, as yet inexplicable contrast for me,” he answered.
He looks up from my trousers to my face.
, Draco thought, the word barely taking shape in his mind for all that it was full of Potter. He wanted their bodies together, this time.
“Oh. I didn’t—I’m sorry I didn’t think of that. Draco is fine. Or Malfoy, if you’d rather. Though it’s been ages since anyone’s called me that.”
Malfoy looked up, startled, and his soft smile turned to a scowl. “Piss off.” He curled around the bird protectively and stomped past Harry, back towards the hide.
“Draco,” Narcissa smiled. Lucius’ curt nod avoided Harry entirely.
Harry's heart picked up speed, and he felt his rib cage begin to thaw as blood rushed through him.
“And if I told you I’d had direction? Told you it was a command from home?”
“Draco?” Harry asked, suddenly serious.
Granger frowned and sat back.
“Why don’t the others do it, then? The WWN doesn’t report on my choice of starters. The
“Promise,” I add, still stroking his skin.
Fine, then. There are other tasks he can do. That he should be doing.
“Oh,” Draco pauses. “Yeah.”
“And Harry?”
But then, Harry wondered if he had. If in bed, if at home alone, if at private dinners, if in the throes of sex, Lucius Malfoy, with all his blood supremacy, all the pleasure he took in humiliation and viciousness, was every bit as excitable, as exciting, as his son. If Lucius, like Draco, could make people feel good. Feel lots of things.
Malfoy threw his hands up in obvious exasperation and turned his back. Harry tried to ignore him completely, even as he started to restlessly tap his finger against his arm. Shutting his eyes, Harry dropped his hand to his jeans and gave himself a cursory sort of palming, trying to fill his mind with pictures of cocks and arses and muscular backs and long, lean legs.
“Increasing your magical exposure is a top priority.”
Harry locked eyes with him as he flicked his tongue into Malfoy’s slit and then slipped his mouth over the head of his cock.
“I— yes. I’ll see you then, then.”
“He’s in the void at night. He can’t do anything like that.”
When he went to see Potter the next morning, Draco found Granger waiting for him at the end of the corridor. She was pale and fidgety, looking down at the floor and rocking back on her heels, clearly trying not to pace.
“Am not,” he retorts. He knows it’s not his best.
Potter’s breath grew shallow, but his eyes were clear and full of desires. He rolled his hips. Draco slid his finger out, and then in again, slowly, firmly.
“Fine. What would you suggest?”
“Why?” Harry pulled off, his fingers still wrapped loosely around the shaft.
“Leave Potter alone, would you?” Draco said, his annoyance becoming apparent. “He’s our guest, Pansy.”
Harry spent most of yesterday looking at the troll leg umbrella stand. It’s hideous. It’s one of the things he actually had considered intentionally Vanishing, before he knew where Vanished things went. He’d hesitated over a memory of Tonks tripping over it once, but that wasn’t really a reason to keep something so grotesque. Certainly not a reason to keep it in the front hallway once he’d learned that he had an attic.
“You really think it’ll just produce different kinds of flowers?”
It’s dripping. It’s the first thing he notices, his eyes fixed on the thin white strand trailing down Potter’s shaft. It’s thick, too, and long. Big enough that he knows with total certainty that he’d feel gloriously full with Potter stretching him open. Big enough that he wants to know whether he can take it all in his mouth.
“That’s right!” Harry’s stomach curdled as he said it.
“Is it that you can’t?” Draco asked. “Or that you won’t?”
“Yeah.” Harry nodded. “All the way.”
"No," Harry answered, crossing his arms over his chest and watching as Malfoy's eyes tracked the leather of his jacket as it moved across his chest. "I've seen the way you look at me."
He could do this. Merlin knew he’d done much worse for much less.
“Yeah?”
The Minister was willing to travel to Paris. Specifically to meet with him. About something so top secret it couldn’t be discussed over the Ministry’s most secure Floos.
“I’m sorry.” Even when inaudible, the shape of the words was unmistakable.
Rather than answering, Draco took Harry’s arm and held it, stopping at the Western corner of the Rue Saint-Jacques and the Rue Soufflot.
“Okay,” Harry whispered, fingers pinching a clasp.
* * *
“When would I meet with the Mind Healer, if I did this?”
Finnigan and Wilkins turned, fencing Harry and Draco in and pressing them together in the centre of the formation.
“Oh.” Potter looked down at the book. Opened the cover and closed it again.
It’s bliss, Draco’s skin against his like this, but he wants Draco there with him. He wants, desperately, to make Draco come too. “Please let me.” He struggles to turn around.
Bliss. For all our early morning one-offs, we’d never been like this, pressed together without obstacle. He bent to cover my back and his skin was as warm as the air was cold; I melted against him in relief, in warmth, in abject desire.
Next, he crossed the Channel. Chapelle Notre-Dame du Salut had an Apparition point where the roof of the nave had been torn off in storm. He felt exhaustion mounting and thought he might walk a moment, but the smell of sea air was still too strong, the salt too eager to settle in his lungs, and it was just two more jumps.
“Wasn’t aware saving Harry Potter from himself was high on your to-do list.” She traced a fingertip around the edge of her glass. “And they only told me after the fact, once it became a problem. They really did think it would work.”
I asked him, once, on our fourth night out together, if it was strange for him to do this while he was, ostensibly, in the Ministry’s employ, when he had been tasked with catching the same man he was now abetting.
“Potter.”
“Since you’re intent on playing host to Harry Potter, I’d say not.”
“Why Potter, I’m so glad you asked. I’ve haven’t known how to tell you but I’ve been absolutely dying for you to suck on my littlest toe. Don’t know how we haven’t gotten round to discussing it in depth.”
“A Patronus is not corporeal.”
Harry blinked again and hugged the bird closer. “What?”
I catch his eye. “So hard, Potter.” I lean back and unbuckle my belt. “So hard I’m going to come. Come in my fist while I’m eating your hole.”
“Yes. Yes, there are women. There have been women.”
Harry is already gone, and the full force of this ridiculous folly hits Draco in his absence.
“Maybe it’s just the thrill of a successful negotiation.” He held out the stack of folders.
Potter surveyed his suit, seeming to linger over the top button of his waistcoat before his eyes snapped to Draco’s face. “Are you ready?”
He almost dropped the book when someone knocked on the door. “One moment,” he yelled, catching his breath and setting the book down on the end table. He wasn’t in the mood for Pansy’s prying or a late night visit from a guest. He didn’t want to consider the other possibility.
Draco
Again, Harry is waiting for him, arm extended. Again, Harry hands a card to the herald, who announces “Harry James Potter and Draco L. Malfoy.” Harry squeezes his arm on the “L.” Draco squeezes back.
Draco felt the question more than he heard it. He nodded, and tilted his head, opening his neck to Harry by way of agreement.
“I disagree, and I look forward to resolving the issue.”
“But I want to try.”
Though the people are interesting too. People who he’d wondered about sometimes, since the end of the trials. Who he’d wondered if he would ever see again. Not that he’s thought about it much, but it had been a bit strange to go from spending the better part of a year following him to going on the run and still bumping into him at every turn to reading about him all through the trials, testifying for him, and then never hearing anything more. It makes sense that he’d think about him from time to time. That he’d wonder. That he’d be surprised to bump into him after that much time had passed. Really surprised. Shocked, even. And a bit curious. Though he doesn’t seem to have changed all that much, circumstances aside. A little taller, maybe. A bit broader through the shoulders. Just as sharp, though.
That’s one of the major problems with owls, he decides. Like the Royal bloody Mail’s Signed For, with extra pecking.
before. However will I survive?”
Harry turned towards him. “Apparently it’s meant to be good for me to be as honest and direct as possible. Avoid all that bottling up.”
Malfoy hadn’t moved an inch, as far as Harry could tell. Not a muscle. He might’ve been made of ice except, Harry thought, ice would’ve melted under the spotlight and Malfoy hadn’t even begun to break a sweat.
,” he hissed. “
“Clever girl, Mill.”
—with the cloak in order to figure it out.
Harry nodded.
“In, was it, five years?”
“Internal oversight is one of the many ways in which the Ministry prevents fraud and mishandling.”
“Really? Because it sounded like you were all just coming round to Potter’s queerness.”
And the quality of the looking. Another mystery. Draco was certain that his uniform was properly maintained. He had checked afterwards and hadn’t found anything in his teeth, nor any blemishes, and his hair was in place. He had concluded that they weren’t corrective glances. And Draco was working far more efficiently than Potter, so reproach was out of the question.
“Who said I was going to?”
“Back to the sex, please.”
“I –“ Harry paused. “I want you.”
In short, it worked. No matter the wand wood or the core, no matter the sourcing, no matter the illness. It worked.
Harry’s eyes shot open. “Fuck.” He blinked. “Fuck.” He looked up, and his sleepy unguardedness destroyed any possibility of guile. He looked panicked. A bit afraid, even. “You’re leaving.”
“Well, what the hell else were you going to say?” Harry throws up his arms. “You wouldn’t even kiss me back, you were clear that you didn’t want anything said, you treated me like a total stranger—”
“You could invite me in?”
Harry whimpered. “Please.” He dug his heels in, pulling Draco closer to him.
“You asked me to trust you once. Clearly, I do. If you think you can trust me back – if you think you can trust that I won’t keep you a secret, that I won’t run as soon as there’s some ridiculous headline, that I like you and would enjoy your company for an evening – meet me there at eight on Saturday.”
“No,” Harry resisted, “Not until you say it.”
And didn’t I see that I hadn’t won at all? That she’d got me to give up my one big chance at love, over an idle threat? Over a suggestion?
He’s afraid to turn around, to see Draco’s eyes glazed over with frost instead of lust. But his clothes are behind him and he hears the rustling of Draco’s. It’s a fine line between post-coital and exposed, and standing here naked won’t be a good option for much longer.
“But it’s dangerous—”
"That is a remarkably accurate guess. Could it be that you've already retrieved them?"
“Would be hard to pull off when you won’t even give me a second look in front of them.”
“But it’s blobs! And weeds and things!”
Draco deflated, sinking down into his seat and focusing on aligning the end of his knife with the edge of the table.
“No? Your career, then? That’s not a game to you?”
“Potter?”
Malfoy had moved on to a thorough recounting of a key Wronski feint in the 1971 World Cup qualifying matches. Neither of them had been alive to see it, and it involved the completely unlegendary seeker of a Lichtensteinian team that no longer existed, yet somehow, Malfoy had found a way to make it something passably close to interesting. He was describing the weather conditions—“a southerly wind gusting at up to 37 knots per hour made for exceptionally difficult conditions, given the ease with which a 70s-era Snitch could be buffeted about”—when Harry felt, not for the first time, the urge to ask a question.
“No. It kept behaving more dramatically when it was separated from him, and after shorter periods of time.”
“All of them have something else in common. Two or three things, actually.”
Malfoy’s question hung in the air. Harry wasn’t sure how to answer it. There were reasons why he’d come looking for Malfoy originally, and reasons why he was glad he had, but they weren’t the same reasons.
Inferi, creating them, is completely out of the question anywhere in the DMLE, as I’m sure you recall from training, as is doing anything to the state of anyone’s magic without their fully informed consent. We have very strict internal research protocols, and the intent of our projects is always to improve our understanding of the magical world. In spell repurposing, we also aim to improve it.” By the end, he sounded like he could have a promising career in writing Ministry training manuals. But it wasn’t just small talk; it was real. Real interest, real passion.
Draco knit his brow. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“Oh, yeah,” Harry snorts. “There was an article in the
“What?”
“But before that, I thought we might work up an appetite.” Draco slips the cloak around his shoulders and slips a hand into his other pocket, pulling out a snitch. “What do you say to some flying?”
“Wait a moment? For what?” As Harry spoke, a set of recessed lights flickered.
“I –” Potter scowls. “Whatever. Whatever. Right. Two things. One, I ran out of room on the form. Two, I’m not sure what exactly I Vanished.”
He didn’t know. The water pressure was miraculous, and it pounded into his shoulders and sluiced down his back. He felt quieter than he had before. Shakier, too.
Potter looked at him curiously. “You think it’s important to protect me from harm?”
“Up here, Potter.” Harry blushed as Draco continued. “Of course he is. What was it you said? ‘Throwing money at things and holding on to dark books’? The Malfoy way?”
“If it’s all the same to you, I think… best not.”
Draco and Harry were alone again.
Draco stilled for a moment. “Is that it?”
“I—” He frowns. “I don’t know.” A shrug. “Feels all right, I guess. You’re very clean.”
, you and your do-gooders, you insisted on it.”
“Some parts. Any of the parts where you do what feels right, I’d still advise.”
Draco starts walking before Potter can reply. When he turns, he sees Potter in his periphery, looking hurt and bewildered and on the verge of crumbling. Draco walks faster.
“You’re working? Now?”
what that is?” Draco can’t help the exclamation or, unfortunately, stuff it back into his mouth.
“Since when are you the expert?”
Harry shrugs. “You could always return them to me now.”
There’s nothing professional about Draco’s smile. “What do you think, Potter?”
Neither Harry nor Hermione managed a word for several long moments after the door clicked shut.
A heavy silence sat between them, though it felt less tense than others that had come before.
He jerks, eyes flaring open. “No,” he repeats.
“Or…” Harry pulls him in for a kiss. “That really didn’t take that much longer more than fifteen minutes, did it?”
“And it always happens?”
Harry managed a nod.
“Brilliant,” Draco answered, lifting the top sheet for them both. He settled back when Harry followed and wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulders.
“Yeah. Okay.” Harry stood shakily and walked to the sink. He rested the tip of the marble against the faucet and pressed it upwards. The tap glowed again and seemed to absorb the stone as Harry pressed it upwards.
He turned one over, and felt his blood go cold. At the next, and he almost dropped his wand.
“Here we go!” Lee continued, switching off their mics and sitting back, with a curious look at Draco.
Thinks back to the day he’d done it. Lying naked in Harry’s bed two autumns after the war, with Harry running his fingers through the fine hair on Draco’s chest and talking about next summer, next year, shopping in Diagon come Christmas, trips to places Draco had always wanted to see. And his father’s voice—and his mother’s, and his own, with all those little misgivings that hung on like a horde of angry Pixies—still overtook Harry’s. And then Harry had looked up at him, eyes wide, and said, “I love you, you know.” Draco had pulled Harry to his chest and hoped Harry couldn’t hear his heart icing over. He waited there, an hour, maybe, his hands carding Harry’s hair as he tried to find the words, but when Harry's breath slowed and they didn’t come he left—slipped out of Harry’s bed and into his trousers and carried his shoes as he snuck down to the Floo, and never opened any of the notes that arrived every day for a month after.
Potter scrambled to collect them.
“Actually, if you’d like you can stay longer.”
Draco nodded.
“Of course,” Draco scoffs, quickly adding, “it’s my business to know.”
Cora Floydam, vampire chaser, on the other hand…they gladly bought the photos from her, as well as the line. “The vampire would only pose for photos under the pretense that it was a glamour shoot for a Muggle lad mag. They had to be nudes, or I never would’ve recorded the specimen’s natural mating behaviour.”
“Was something damaged? You know that we are not responsible for the condition of items after they are recovered.”
He breathes in deep and lets it out again, willing himself to stay cool in every sense of the word. He pushes himself forward again, remembering to tuck his knees, rolling into nothingness and hoping his momentum will be enough. He can feel the cloak begin to catch on his shoe and pushes himself through the turn even more quickly, righting himself before he can stumble.
“Manners, Potter.”
Then, thankfully, blessedly, springtime came to Paris.
“Okay,” Harry said slowly. “Okay.”
Ten minutes later, an otter perched on the edge of his desk. “Don’t you think that’s a question for him?”
He sat in the chair opposite and forced himself to meet Potter’s eye. “Good morning.”
Malfoy held the door open and Harry stepped through. He looked back to see Malfoy say a quiet “
And yet. He steeples and unsteeples his finger, furrows and unforrows his brow, puts his feet up on the desk and takes them down again. He decides to turn around, to look disinterested and preoccupied. The king observing his domain, looking down at the insignificant people below.
“I don’t want to end up with just lots of random tables.”
Draco steps out of his shoes and clothes and steps towards him. Harry’s half-convinced he’s going to faint. Draco steps between his legs and grips his chin. “Is this what you want?”
“And Godric, too.” Draco paused to watch Harry’s mouth bend into a smile and relax again. “What would you do if you left? Have you given it any thought?”
He veered away from Malfoy in search of a foothold. It didn’t make sense. Malfoy didn’t make sense. He hadn’t made sense before the conversation, and he made even less sense since.
A plain, sturdy, trestle table follows, and Potter frowns. “This isn’t mine.”
Draco stiffened. “Pardon?”
Draco laughed. “Twelve? Twelve
He cleared his throat and glanced down at his bare chest, hoping it would be enough hint for Millie. “I am not able to speak to the Minister at present. May I ask what this concerns?”
He was just a bit reflective, he said, wondering what it would’ve been like if things had been different. He was so open about it, so sure of his emotions, that it’s hardly surprising that he’s not falling all over himself in despair as those idiot reporters would have us believe. Besides which, it’s one thing to read it in the papers, but quite another to have the great saviour between your legs, confessing as though that kind of honesty, that candour, is nothing.
Draco cleared his throat. “Is that it?”
Draco lifted his hips and felt Harry’s knuckles brush his hips as he was relieved of pants and trousers in one go. He fell back on the bed and shrugged his shirt off, and lay back, naked, his cock hard and entirely on display.
Harry risks a look at Malfoy. His eyes are lined with black, his lips are plump and glistening. His skin radiates heat.
“The vase?”
“Quite sure.” Harry heard the chill in his voice, and wasn’t sure whether he was glad for it. “It was because Skeeter was writing those articles about me.” He paused. “As you may recall?”
“Shall we continue on?”
Potter relaxed against the ground reflexively, then shot up to his feet. “Fucking bastard.”
“But then.” Potter looked up into the trees. “If you don’t… where are they? The actual apples?”
“You wouldn’t.”
A week and a half of sleepless nights and too many drinks and torturous memories would put anyone round the twist, he reasons. And he’s probably just overtired and needs to get it out of his system. Needs to get anything that can jog those memories out of his life.
Harry takes another step towards him. “What else?”
And then there’d been that damned smirk, and Malfoy’s insistence that Harry meet his eye, and ‘you should try it some time.’ It wasn’t just a brush-off, Harry was sure of it. You didn't have that kind of history of getting under someone's skin, or them under yours, without picking up a few things about their tells, and Harry knew Malfoy was up to something.
Harry nods, too relieved even to laugh. “All the way?”
It was Draco’s turn to hesitate. “Towards what end?”
Lifting one hand from the desk, Harry shifted his angle and grabbed his cock, moving until just the tip grazed Malfoy's hole. He pushed forward slowly, and gave up entirely on suppressing the shuddering moan that reverberated through his chest as he was surrounded by tight heat. He rocked back again, and then in again, still slowly, barely hanging on to his reserve but determined not to be too rough about it.
“You like that?”
“Fine,” Draco groused, letting go of Harry so he could gather their cups. “There’s an alley back that way anyway, we can Apparate from there.”
Draco pulled him closer, resting his forearms on either side of Harry’s neck and moving his hips in time with the music, hoping Harry might feel more at ease following. It worked, to an extent. He wasn’t able to move with the beat, quite, but he did respond to Draco’s body, did let himself relax into Draco. It wasn’t anything flashy or impressive—they wouldn’t be taking home any awards—but it felt good to Draco. Very good, to move together, to see Harry’s limbs loosen, to feel his hands trail up Draco’s sides and to his neck.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Thanks. That’s… I’ll think about that. Good to know.”
“That is why I supported the MbRC Reparations Act of 2000. That is why my fellow Aurors and I devote ourselves to protecting the security of wizarding Britain.” On the bench, Robards gave a single, approving nod. “That is why I cannot, in good conscience, support the SAFE Act.”
It wasn’t a no. “There’s only one way to find out.”
“Bit of both. You’re really not worried about cameras? The gendarme? Mobs with pitchforks?”
“Do you?”
Potter swallowed again, his throat clicking audibly in the silence. “I’m a man of my word.”
Still, given that the parties involved were Gryffindors, watching them was almost as telling. Granger rushed to scoop Harry into a hug, which he returned, though with tense shoulders that belied the sentiment.
Harry catches his bottom lip between his teeth and bites down as he lowers his fingers to the metal. He’s entirely focused as he slips it through Draco’s belt loops, almost startles when Draco tells him to, “Set it down next you. I might want that later.”
“Please,” Draco said.
- Re-read October
“Pansy.”
“Will they be making any concessions to protect you, or are you expected to go in on your own?”
“I guarantee that one of us will be commenting. Possibly at some length and in lieu of sexual favours.”
“Oh no, no. Out with it.”
“Just a house,” he repeated under his breath.
Draco doesn’t.
She hesitated, then gave a firm nod.
Though perhaps a strategic loss is in order. The thrill of victory in his veins, etc., etc.
He’s surprised that Draco relents, but he does. And then they’re standing chest to chest, cock to cock. He tilts his head to capture Draco’s bottom lip between his, heart surging when Draco’s hips push against his. “Please,” he murmurs again, his breath mingling with Draco’s. “Please let me make you come.”
“Yes. In case you hadn’t noticed,” Draco rolls his hips under Harry, “there are some things that make me quite happy.”
Draco watched him go. He was halfway to the Manor when Draco remembered Shacklebolt’s letter. “Wait,” he called. “Potter. That’s not it.”
Could smell his hair from there, the skin behind his earlobe, his breath. The pull on my lower lip between his two.
Robards smiled at that. “And how is the work coming?”
“We might if you’d bloody well tell us.”
Potter keeps looking at him, an urgency rising behind his eyes. “Draco,” he says again.
“Okay,” Harry said. “That’s fine. I understand. If you have any questions about it—about any of it—and you want to ask them…”
“Ninety degrees to the left?” He held his hand out and turned it.
He is aware, in the back of his mind – or, just as frequently, the front of it – that Draco may not show up. He never said yes, never even picked up the parchment. Harry is aware that he may have told his friends for nothing, or for something that’s about to be a bit of egg on his face. But if Draco does come, and it does come up, he can tell him with a straight face that he’s already keeping his promises.
“Yeah.”
“The other end of this aisle, seeing as I’m at A.”
“Fuck,” Harry managed, drawing a sudden exhale and opening his eyes. “Fuck,” he said again, this time more vehemently. “That was…”
He looks to Blaise for help.
“It’s okay,” Draco whispered. “Just getting dressed. You can go back to sleep.” It was a poor effort, and as soon as it was out Draco realised he’d probably known that.
“Mind Healer,” Potter said, as Draco watched the man leave.
“Bully for them. We still have a task to complete.”
“It’s, er,” he mumbles, looking down. “It’s gross.”
“I don’t think you are.”
He’d only been into the kitchen once before, on the pretence of having a drink, which quickly turned into Malfoy pulling them both off against the worktop. Still, drinks had been poured, and Harry found glasses in the cupboard over the sink, where he’d thought they’d be. He cast an

“Harry,” he said again, “I want you. I’m not afraid of your magic.” He half-laughed. “I’m
That possibility had kept Draco awake through so many nights he’d lost count. He’d imagined it printed across the front page of the
Draco watched him, unsure of what to say.
“I shall be managing routine rubbish disposal. I will return at the end of the day to check your work. These four sets of shelves hold the items that are likely to be a part of your lot. When in doubt, I recommend checking for monograms and examining the seams for notes to do with origins or inscriptions.”
Harry looked at her nervously. “He told you everything? What I did?”
Dropping to his knees felt natural, obvious. Right. So Harry did, gripping Malfoy's hips and leaning in to mouth at the bulge in his underwear.
“Yeah. I’m pretty sure.”
“Except, I’d like to be.”
“Ah. Right.” Draco gripped the base of his cock and pulled it free of Harry, who rocked backwards and tried to follow. Draco smacked his arse. “Duty, Potter.”
“My soufflés don’t fall.” At Draco’s look, he adds “Anymore.”
Then Harry pulled away, licking one last long stripe from the base to tip of Malfoy’s cock. “Is that how you want it? To come in my mouth?”
“You’re stealing a priceless statue? That’s a twist.”
“Fuck,” Harry gasps. “Fuck.”
“If it’s a problem…” Harry trails off.
He gave her a look, but did as suggested.
Except when he steps around the skip, the street beyond the alley is dauntingly bright and someone else has had the same idea, is leaning against the wall, lanky and pale and staring straight ahead.
Potter started unlacing his boots. “Right. Night then, I guess.”
The Minister was the first to speak. “In that case, shall we schedule a next meeting? I’m sure we’d all like to stay up to date on the details of the case.”
After so many years spent worrying that his instincts were evil, Draco wasn’t sure he could trust the fluttering seed of hope behind his sternum.
Only, Potter’s eyes were open. He looked down, and Potter was looking back at him. His eyes were the deepest green Draco thought he’d ever seen, and so fiery that, for an impossible few seconds, Draco forgot that Potter was sucking his cock. It was the two of them, together, and something passed through Draco’s chest, through his stomach, and he wondered if what he felt with Potter had ever been nerves. If the kicking, twisting heat he’d taken for unease hadn’t been pure molten gold, waiting to be shaped into something more valuable, more precious, than he’d ever managed to be.
“You should keep up daily exercises, and perhaps try running through the activities we’ve done together on your own. And you’re welcome to stay here. I’d encourage it, even, both so you have the void as a sort of insurance policy, especially if you’re concerned about the possibility of an incident occurring while you sleep, and so that the Ministry can remain unaware of the work you’re doing with Healer Barrett for as long as you’d like.”
“What, a second phone call?” Potter was teetering on a precipice between incredulous and outraged.
“Don’t wanna stop.” Draco struggles to get the words out.
Harry nodded, head buried in his arms.
Harry’s eyes go straight to Draco, who looks shocked in the split second before cool professionalism takes over.
“Strong words.”
Millie’s eyes widened and Draco could see the wheels turning. She thinned her lips and spoke carefully. “I do believe I am at liberty to assure you that the matter does not concern…” she paused, frowned. “That the matter is not of any personal concern.”
“Good, good.” Draco can hear the hint of a smile in the portrait’s voice. “Now, Harry, about this woman of yours.”
Draco sighed. “What happened?”
Draco settled a hand on Potter’s hip and drove into him harder. They edged forward, Potter now almost pressed against the glass, his forearm beginning to slide against it.
She shrugged apologetically. “Either way, here we are. I share Hermione’s concerns. If you leave, it throws things out of balance. There’s no way of knowing how the Gobstones would fall. If they’ll go back to the surgery, if they’ll bring in someone else to try to train him to use the Elder Wand, and Merlin only knows how that would go.”
Lupin offers some similarly joking reply, but Draco doesn’t hear it. At the sound of Harry’s first footsteps, he’s jarred into action.
“No, I cook, but about the other da—”
“One Quidditch jersey. Standard Hogwarts uniform item. Gryffindor. Area G, Aisle 11, Shelf 16.”
She sighed again. “Knowing what you know, and don’t know, yes. Knowing what I know, no. I realise it’s not your forte, but you’ll just have to trust me.”
“Ta, Potter. Have Kate walk you out.”
Draco rolled his hips, angling himself in hopes of hitting Harry’s prostate again.
“Yes, I’m here.”
to know that. There was a headline about it in the bloody
“Feels good,” Harry said. “Really good.”
“And if it’s a simple case of bad options?”
Harry grinned “Just remember, all you have to do is ask.”
s on one of the bedside tables, while the other lies empty. There’s a broomstick leaning up against one of the windows, and the cuff of a dress shirt caught in the wardrobe doors. And it smells like Harry. Like his sweat, and his soap, and his skin.
Draco was still until Harry’s tongue met his, and then his hands were on Harry’s back and in Harry’s hair, and Harry pulled him down until Draco’s weight covered him, his back arching towards Draco and away from the cold stone floor.
“I did, yes.”
We were finished painting just in time for him to leave. He had to charm our banners still, to change, to glamour away the last lingering streaks from his face and fingernails, to go out to meet the Minister.
Malfoy clears his throat. “Theft of Ministry Records is clearly prohibited by Wizengamot statutes.”
“No,” Hermione agreed. “That’s why we floss.”
“You looked fine.”
Draco began to move his finger steadily, slowly, in and out of Potter’s arse. He could feel Potter relax around him, could feel the slickness of his finger as it entered Potter’s hole. Noticed the tension in Potter’s shoulder’s ebb, and his forearm come to rest against the glass. When Draco next withdrew, Potter followed him back.
“No reason.”
He keeps his hand on Draco’s side, using it to urge him forward, deeper into his mouth. He’s waiting for Draco to give in entirely, to start fucking into his face, to come all over him. When Draco begins to pick up speed, the anticipation grips him. He’s ready. He wants.
Draco takes another sip and Harry thinks he sees the hint of a smile around the corners of his mouth. Still, the silence feels laden and it’s making him anxious, though he’s not quite sure what about.
He opened and closed his mouth, but there was nothing against it any longer.
“It is. And, with this, we’ve run through every exercise I had planned. We might do them all again, or come up with more, but there isn’t really a need for it. As far as control, as far as integrating the Elder Wand into your casting, you’re as improved as I’d expect. Maybe more so. Continuing the exercises on your own should suffice as long as you continue working with Healer Barrett.”
“Technically, yes, but they often choose not to. We see fewer cases of this now that the implants are becoming standard protocol. It was mostly an issue for patients who spent long periods of time in the void as a result of their magical outbursts. As,” he added, “Potter has. After leaving the hospital, either after their illness was resolved or after receiving an implant, many of them moved to predominantly Muggle areas. Switched to careers that keep them away from magic. Herbologists go to work in Muggle botanical gardens, that sort of thing.”
“Ah.”
“I…” Harry waffled. Momentarily. The mélange in his chest was good for his resolve. “So will you, if you don’t stop arguing with me.”
Potter’s jaw tightened and his eyes narrowed ever so slightly. Draco might not even have noticed it if he hadn’t sat through quite so many negotiations. Or so many Death Eater meetings. Though in the end, he thought, Muggle and magical megalomaniacs weren’t so very different. They all clenched their jaws and narrowed their eyes sooner or later.
“No, actually. I guess that’s something.”
Draco snorts. “I have very delicate skin.”
“He’s invested in quite a few important causes,” Granger interrupted.
After an hour on the Floo to Paris with mixed results, Draco decided he was well past clinging to stubbornness where Granger was concerned. Between them, they had profiles of half a dozen Mind Healers—all with background checks, daily availability, and a willingness to make house calls—ready with time enough to have Lobsey deliver it with Potter’s breakfast. Draco also enclosed a note encouraging him to write down any questions and to please advise as to a best time for their first meeting.
“You want me to stick my cock in your arse? To fuck you till you’re begging me to let you come?”
I’ve prepared the bedroom in advance. My bedroom, rather than the guest room. I want to remember Potter’s arse laid open for me every time I lay my head down. He doesn’t need to know that, nor see the trinkets that would’ve given it away, now safely stashed in trunks and wardrobes. All he needs to see is the four poster and, perhaps, the chest at its foot.
His lack of curiosity didn't seem to bother Lee in the slightest as he slid on his headphones and gestured for Draco to do the same. "That was 'Incarceroused My Heart,' the hot new single from Dohaghan Tremlett and the Tremblers! We're here with our very own Draco Malfoy, from Daily Dose of Draco, and it's Call or Delete day on the Breakfast Show! First things first, Draco, good morning!"
“So,” he tried. “How about those Falcons?”
“Uh, right. Which way?” He wants to stuff the words back in as soon as they’re out.
“And my point is that I want to do it anyway.”
“Why?”
I worked down his body until he was an inch from my mouth. His breath was coming in shallow gasps. I mouthed the underside of his erection through the soft cotton of his pants and felt a tug when his fingers threaded through my hair. I thought he was pulling me off, but when I looked up I saw him overtaken with lust, still certain, still wanting. He licked his bottom lip and drew a deeper breath. My name came on his exhale. My name and a word. “Draco…please.”
“Oh. Okay. Does that matter?”
.” Draco let the spell drop and saw Potter’s shoulders relax as he did.
“I didn’t go into any details, nothing about Healer Barrett or that larger plan. But I did say, truthfully, that you’ve made remarkable progress. I’ve asked Millie to keep it to herself, and she’s agreed, but I’ve realised it’s true. Your control is improved, you haven’t had a magical incident in over a week in spite of the amount of time you’re spending outside of the void and the amount of magic you’re doing. Your casting is accurate and powerful. Your work has been very effective.”
“No.” Draco held out the handle of Harry’s wand.
“No. I have a job to do,” Draco replies, his voice trembling.
“Hardly.” I cross my arms. “Pin the tail on the saviour.”
“Oh.” Potter looked like he was biting down on a smile. “Okay.”
"Would you try a revealing spell?" His heart sped up. "There's another possibility."
- HP returns from Quidditch pitch between 9:05 and 9:25
“Okay…”
The door clicks shut. There’s a trace of the beat, of the bass. It’s as loud as your steps in the pools of last night’s rain. It’s as loud as the cars that roll past out of sight. It’s as loud as his breath against your neck. It is as loud as the
“Alright?” Blaise repeated.
“Yeah.” Harry paused, rested his fork on the edge of his plate. “Does it make sense, why I couldn’t see you?”
In any event, she’s off to the continent and there’s no way she or her mother will see the photos until they’re in wide circulation. Cora Floydam will prove impossible to find should they attempt it. Besides which, the story’s not even wholly untrue; they
“This one’s called
He had to remind himself of what Pansy had said to him, and of how many times he’d repeated it to himself before he began to think it might be true. “It’s not that it’s what I’m good at. It’s that it’s what no one else can do.”
Whatever he wants, it’s not contained in Phillips’ features, entranced though they are at the prospect of what’s about to occur.
Shacklebolt gave Draco the sort of piercing look that implied that he knew exactly what Draco was suggesting. The bags under his eyes suggested that he was too tired, too eager for a permanent resolution, to give up the possibility that he might be wrong about Draco’s intentions. “You recommend against an armed guard?”
“Okay, well.” Harry didn’t follow him.
“I find it preferable to being a sanctimonious former Golden Boy who’s incapable of nuance.”
Despite his better efforts—which are, admittedly, rather feeble at the moment—Harry’s shoulders slump in a bit. It’s bad enough for Draco to have to come, and for him to have found Harry in a bit of a shabby state, but really, he’d been quite embarrassed enough already.
“It doesn’t.” Draco crossed his arms behind his head. “Just wondering how Potter managed to pry himself away from her and Weasley long enough for the Wand to notice.”
His work was coming along too. Uagadou didn’t take visitors—about which Draco was a bit relieved once spring was in full bloom—but Madame Sissoko made introductions for Draco among the community of Malian expatriate wizards in Paris. Whereas Draco came to Muggle science through and for his magical research, Professor Traoré had done the reverse, and the combination of her work on nervous disorders, including their relationship to magical deprivation, was a perfect match for Draco’s own. It was a ten-minute walk from Draco’s office to the École Normale Supérieure, and long brainstorming lunches with Amina became at least a weekly ritual.
“Shhhh,” he reassured, letting it settle on his arm. “Let’s have a look at you.”
Draco’s smile only wavered when he saw Harry falter.
I pull all the way out this time, my cock leaving his hole with a wet pop, and he looks up at me in open anguish.
“For apples?” Potter asked, confused.
“As badly as it did?”
“I do.”
“Beautiful casting,” Draco added, hoping that, if nothing else, Harry was too distracted to notice the nervousness in his voice.
“Whenever you’re ready.” Draco stood back to give him space.
Half a dozen quips hit the back of his teeth, and Draco barely ignored the urge to run. With a curt nod, he took the proffered seat.
It takes Harry a moment to respond. Seems to take him a moment to even comprehend the words entirely. Then he nods and scrambles to turn over.
“As you prefer. Thank you, Doctor Malfoy.”
From the corner of his eye, Draco can see Potter’s chest rises and falls quickly, his fingers fisting and releasing, fisting and releasing. “You arse—”
Potter propped his arm on the back of the bench and twisted.
“Er, yeah.” Harry said. “He’s not— I asked Millie to set up the meeting.”
Potter narrowed his eyes.
Almost. Almost. Instead, he murmured, “More, fuck me,” and pushed back against the incursion.
“How?”
“As I said.”
“Was that just –? Professor Sinistra? Are they –? Do they both?”
“My fingers look so good inside you.”
“Sandwiches?” Draco asked. He grinned. “Is that what you were doing in the kitchen? Making sandwiches?”
“Work. Years of work.” Draco’s throat tightened. “To learn everything I possibly can. To re-learn everything I thought I knew.”
“Are you going to talk to the snake for me?”
He crooks his index finger to smooth the hair where his hand is held to Harry’s chest. “I meant it when I said I’m not just fine. That there are things that make me happy. As you may recall, you were on that list.”
“It’s not too far.”
Draco groaned and dropped his head back down, banging it twice against the table. When he lifted it again he found an unmistakably startled elf staring back at him.
“I–” Potter shuddered as Draco’s finger tips stretched his entrance.
“An omelette and toast?”
“I’m sorry if it’s an incomplete accounting.”
“The exact same spells as before.”
“I’m full of surprises,” Harry grumps, shifting his weight to one side.
He crumpled a barely legible note from Potter and threw it into the bin without reading it. Then, as promised, he perused.
“Love?” Harry repeated.
“It’s part of it.” Potter lets out a ragged sigh, and launches into an explanation much like the one he’d given Draco. His attempts at jobs, his isolation, his frustration with the way he’s treated by the public. The portrait, whoever it is, listens silently, and Draco thinks Potter is winding to a close when he adds something new. “And I think I’ve met someone I like, someone who understands all that, and there’s nothing I can do about it. About any of it.”
And so, what to do? I enjoyed a hot shower, did my best to scrub my fingernails clean of errant pigment, passed a sound night's sleep in silk sheets, and laid out my third best casual robes for tea with Pansy. If it was my last night as a free man, best to enjoy those comforts. If it wasn't, well, a down duvet and elf-brewed tea never did a man harm.
“Fuck, Malfoy,” he bites out. “Fuck, that fucking hurts.”
“For fuck’s sake.” Draco closed the distance between them, grabbed Potter by the collar, and pulled him into a kiss. He felt as much as he heard the start, and almost immediate end, of a muffled objection. Potter’s mouth was warm against his, but Potter was stiff with surprise, his lips unyielding. Draco stepped back, half prepared to send him packing. He’d specified that Potter would be an active participant. If he’d just wanted to get off, he was blessed with two good hands. Or a high cash withdrawal limit and the cards for several fetching rent boys, if needs must.
“But,” Draco continued, ”we also know that your magic has creative force. The kittens, the apples—when you feel affection or want something badly and let yourself experience that, you have tremendous constructive, reparative ability. It’s possible that you’ve used this more than you realise; a falling roof tile or a frozen bedroom is much more obvious than a blossoming flower or a ripened piece of fruit. But you don’t know
“That’s not exactly the ritual Granger and I had researched. The sign bit, yes, but having you there, not having the plans in advance…”
“Thanks,” he said. “Though it was really the elves. You were right about the thread counts. I’m thinking of introducing them to flannel, too.”
Harry dropped his hands and sat back, looking straight ahead into the fire. “It wasn’t.”
Draco moves to follow him down onto the bed. It’s Harry’s turn to stop him. He reaches a hand under Draco’s suit jacket and looks up, meeting his eye. “Please.”
“In exchange for the positive publicity associated with attending a charity ball with you, we will refrain from printing your name in association with the photographs.”
“Excuse me.” Draco points to the shelves behind Harry.
Damn. The spot. Draco forces his most pleasant smile and waits.
If there was any part of these evenings that could convince a serial killer that the two of them were really together, Harry was certain it was this.
Draco was both very, very over Scotch and a little bit under its thrall when he woke the next morning. A Hangover potion, a tall glass of water, and a cold shower did the trick. Trick enough for him to be dressed and on his way to the Floo while Millie still slept in the guest room.
He laughed again. Thanked me.
The end of his sentence is lost to Potter’s mouth. One moment Potter’s coiled on the edge of rage, the next Draco’s pinned to the shelving again. Potter is a hot weight against him. He kisses Draco urgently, pressing first lips, then tongues together.
“Mhm?”
“I’ll walk you, if that’s all right.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah.”
“No. Rhetorical.”
If Draco comes.
“Er, yes. I’d like that.”
has allowed for; I will be happy to speak with our head of Fashion and Lifestyle about changing those protocols permanently, if that would be helpful.”
“Well you clearly like posh old stuff!”
Draco groaned and nodded.
Harry’s flushed. His lips are full and open and not more than tongue's length from the head of Draco’s cock. He’s half-smiling up at Draco, but it’s more than a smile. It’s knowing and ravenous and it only disappears when he speaks. “Draco,” he repeats, making sure to lock eyes with Draco. “You know I know what you want, don’t you?”
“What? They overrode it?”
His voice is scratchy, barely a whisper. “What?”
“Lots of money for the rest of us.” Bitterness crept into Ron’s voice. “Probably tuppence to Malfoy.”
He passes it over without comment.
? My father’s in France and, if Snape’s portrait is to be trusted at all, it turns out buggery is one of his preferred pastimes.”
“Better than the alternative,” Potter agreed. “Though explaining everything is a little tricky.”
“Thank you, yes.” He moved out of Potter’s line of sight with uncomfortable urgency, and started speaking before Potter had made it all the way into his seat. “We need to discuss your training.”
“What would help you –” Harry rests his hand over Draco’s and Draco’s breath hitches “—make a positive identification?”
Pansy waved him off. “When they’re done fucking in public. If I last that long.”
“Are you?” Draco muses. “It’s really very nice. Bit rough. Don’t you want to touch it?”
“Dare I ask?”
“If you didn’t want to apologise, I—and Mill and Blaise, certainly, and I think most anyone—would understand. Considering—what was it she said about Granger’s teeth at dinner?”
“Oh?”
As much as he dislikes it, as much as he completely understands why he has avoided it for so long, it is, now, only the familiar tug of fear, and his commitment to pursuing it, that makes him stay.
The intensity of it edged at Draco’s calm. “I’ve answered your questions.” When Potter didn’t speak, he continued. “Why did you come back here?
Potter pressed back against him, rolling his hips to try to catch Draco’s shaft.
“Bed?”
“And?”
“But it’s not necessarily possible, either. Honestly, Granger. Think about the theory. He doesn’t need a wandlore expert or a biomagicologist. He needs to work with a Mind Healer. Every indication points to repressed emotion as the root cause of his magical outbursts. If he isn’t bottling things up there won’t be any explosions.”
At ten, he began to think he might attempt sleep. Finding the will to get up was not as easily done as it was thought. He thought about sleeping on the settee, and might’ve done if there wasn’t a knock on the door.
“They’re not bad.”
“Excuse me.”
Draco pushes through the doors to the warehouse, unbuttoning his robes as he goes. The Ministry’s required uniforms are stuffy even for someone with a pureblood upbringing, all starched collars and thick wool and rows of double-breasted buttons that must be polished to a shine. They’re appropriate enough for the increasingly chilly weather, but too heavy to really permit free movement. Most Ministry workers resolve the issue by wearing them improperly, a shortcut that sets Draco’s teeth on edge. When his work requires a greater range of movement – which, happily, only occurs when he is out of the public eye – he prefers to remove them altogether, lest they become wrinkled or stained. He has therefore made a habit of doffing his robes on his way in to the warehouse, hanging them near the massive dais where Vanished items come to rest.
“More,” Draco exhales, and threads his fingers through Harry’s hair. He tugs—because he knows Harry too, knows Harry so well—and tries not to buck into Harry’s throat when he feels the moan vibrate around his cock.
Potter took a deep breath, and Draco felt the warm exhalation over his skin, complemented by the warmth of Potter’s knuckles as he lowered Draco’s trousers and pants to his thighs. His fingers were calloused, rough against the skin of Draco’s prick.
He’s sick of not being able to have a job without putting people in danger. He is sick of sitting in his half-empty house – half-empty
Draco stepped forward, bringing them almost chest-to-chest. “Slytherin’s snake won’t be the only one you’re begging for more.”
He still knew what to do with it.
“Imagination?” Potter sputtered, the sound of his outrage resonating beautifully through the room. “What the bloody hell do you want from an Auror patrol?”
It took Draco more than a moment to realise he should step back, and another few to make himself do it. The only reason he had to be glad about it was the sight of Potter’s back, shining with sweat, picking up the reflection of a thousand city lights.
“Well, Potter?” Draco nodded at Harry’s hand.
"I have neither need of nor interest in favours from the Ministry."
The corners of his mouth turned up and he raised his brush. “Obviously.”
“That’s good. Right?”
He has to dodge another one as he steps forward. Has to jump aside when Draco sees him getting closer and levitates a polished tree stump at him. Almost trips when Draco slides a heavy oak night stand into the diminishing space between them.
“Okay.” Harry frowned. “What is it that you want to know?”
“That little incident with Potter” – and that she can call it that really says it all – “has cost me an awful lot of work. Redemption is so demanding. All that fucking, all those donations. It gets terribly old, and fast, and it’s all Potter’s fault.” The same old song, and apparently it’s got her quite determined to see his heart broken. Can’t say I cared about that any more today than I did last night.
“Mmph.” Harry mumbled. Then he stilled. “Draco?”
He nodded.
“Complications?” Potter didn’t look over, nor did he seem especially bothered.
With a satisfied smile, she tucks her wand away and turns back to Draco. “The grapefruit, darling?”
“And if you’ll do as I say.”
“Then I suppose I ought to have dinner with him again and hope for more charitable ones. At the very least, the public can be convinced that I haven’t poisoned him.”
“Yeah.”
“Are you—” He looks flummoxed, then his voice softens inexplicably. “Draco, are you asking me on a date?”
“Whisky’s a good second choice.” He ran a hand over the marble.
“No.” Draco stood. “But you do. You know whatever it is that’s at stake and you’ve already made clear that you have no way to address it. If you did, you certainly wouldn’t be here, would you?”
Maybe it would go to voicemail, Draco thought. Hoped.
Harry runs a finger over a shiny black toe. It’s surprisingly soft, the scales barely registering under his fingertips. “They’re mine?”
Harry looked confused. “That I want to go home?”
Hermione jumped in before Ron could answer. “There have been several recorded cases where killers have volunteered information to law enforcement offices, Harry. Even worked with them. There are some serial killers for whom it’s part of the thrill. Getting close to the case, keeping track of the investigation, planting false information.” Hermione pulled a fortune cookie towards her and started playing with the corner of the wrapper, looking at it instead of at Harry. “There’s no way to know that’s not the case here.”
“Uninvited.”
Draco stared, unable to believe his ears. “What?”
“But,” Draco continued, “He really does need to be working with a Mind Healer, and that’s not an area of expertise either of us have. I’ll only work with him concerning the potential for him to learn to use the implant, and nothing more. And that only provided that he’s seeing a Mind Healer as well, and that the Mind Healer takes the lead on Potter’s case.”
Beneath it, there was an envelope addressed to a Mr D Thomas in Brighton. Harry couldn’t imagine his first instinct could be correct, and yet… He shifted through the pile and at the bottom, in a familiar script, was a note from Dean.
But he was nothing if not inventive. “Fine.” He dropped it on his desk and stepped away. “We’ll see if you prefer going without. Bend over.”
Draco ran his thumb over the seal, half wishing it would prove unbreakable.
“I need everything you can give me on our suspect and his three known associates. Bank statements, payment records, investments, known aliases. Anything and everything.”
“It just doesn’t make sense,” Harry said, feeling more than a little out of place. For one thing, though he’d never want to admit it, it felt a bit odd to be the only person scowling in a room full of revellers. For another, the case file had said “Muggle dress,” not “Muggle dress of the chic, fashionable, posh twat variety,” and feeling underdressed was doing nothing for his mood.
His neck is long and elegant and his Adam’s apple bobs as the first sip goes down. Then he lets out a satisfied little
Shacklebolt nodded and turned from Granger back to Draco. “Absolute discretion, Dr Malfoy. On your word?”
Draco scoffs. “And have you disturbing the entire department’s organisational system? Keep you around for weeks on end? I think not.”
*          *          *
But he isn’t head of the department. So when Robards calls Harry into his office and requests—“requests”—that Harry walk with him to Research and Development. Harry can’t object. What is there to say, anyway?
“Waiting for you.”
“Relax.” I run my free hand over the curve of his arse. “It’s going to feel so good, Potter.”
“We were just peeling the vegetables,” Draco said. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other.
“Oh?”
Draco’s not biting, though he matches the appearance of Potter’s smile. “You just had to include the ‘Lucius,’ didn't you? Wouldn’t want anyone to forget that, would we?”
“I will only point out that it would be extraordinarily easy for the elves to sneak a Puking Pastille into someone’s dessert.” He thought of Robards again.
“After the war, the stories stopped. And no one came to burn us at the stake, or take our magic. The trials…” This part was always harder for him. He missed his parents. He wished he didn’t. He swallowed. “The trials were fair.”
She took a duelist’s stance. "Supporting, sir."
"Your word, not mine," Harry answered, and reached out with the rest of his hand, brushing his knuckles over the front of Malfoy's thigh.
£    £    £    £    £
“I’d ask what that’s supposed to mean, but I strongly suspect you’re trying to change the topic.” He laughed. “Though, now you mention it, I do have some rather up close and personal experience with evil. You’re not it, Potter.”
Draco does his best imitation of scepticism. “That you can control a barely-moving Snitch with both feet firmly planted on the floor? Hardly impressive.”
“Bit late to play the blushing saviour, Potter. “
“C’mon now.” The man leans over the counter, his cologne posing an increasingly serious threat to Draco’s supply of clean air. “Couldn’t you give a little friendly assistance?”
“You?”
“Draco…”
Startled, Potter grabbed the frond away. Behind him, the plant it had come from rocketed out of its pot. It hit the skylights and crashed into the ground, scattering soil and bits of roots over the room and breaking off several branches, on which the Kittens pounced as soon as they’d finished taking in the spectacle.
The food tasted like sand and ash, and he felt like he was falling and falling.
He was not used to waking up to the rattling of silver against silver as Prippa bounced nervously, holding the tray out and then pulling it back towards her. “
Except.
“I thought three or four events ought to do it.”
Draco screwed his eyes shut and pushed himself to standing. He tucked himself away. It was as good an excuse as any to look away. The air was cold. His hand was sticky.
For once, he left feeling like the whole thing wasn’t destined for failure
Draco knew the Rue Guynemer loomed ahead, even if they couldn’t yet see it for the trees. Gravel crunched underfoot, two sets of steps, side by side, and Draco realised he hadn’t noticed it earlier. It didn’t sound out of place to him at all, unaccustomed as he was to making this walk with company.
Harry whirled on him. “And you’re still preoccupied with being a smug little arsehole who’s better than everyone.”
There were so many things that could mean. Draco found that he’d be fine with any one of them, so long as it was the sort of thing Potter would never be able to forget.
Draco sneers. “Well enough not to let them in here.” It’s all coming back like second nature. “Well enough to be perfectly aware of what happened to the last Ministry department they tried to search.”
“Who with?” Draco’s voice is edged with bitterness. Another subject to avoid, apparently.
“Oh!” Galder looked down at himself and jumped. “Master Draco! We is sorry!”
; and Draco’s redecoration of the Manor. In company, Draco would maintain that the last was a matter of simple preference.
Harry shrugged. “Not the end of the world.”
“If you’re that averse to touching it, I suppose so.” Draco puts it on a bit of empty shelf and turns back to the task at hand.
“You mentioned my… political family.”
“You’re relentless.”
Draco trails a warm hand over his shoulder blades. The gentleness of it is new, the softness in Draco’s voice as he leans over and whispers it again. “Trust me.”
“No point denying it,” Harry said, so low he wasn’t sure they could hear him. Knew it wasn’t an answer to the question Ron was really asking.
“Tell the snake, now. Tell the snake what you want me to do to you.”
Draco nodded at the kitten. “Have you named them?”
Draco doesn’t miss it. His smile returns, slow and unmistakably salacious. “You do. Though it’s a wonder how you have any energy left.”
“Yeah,” he mumbles, his eyes fluttering shut again. “Yeah.”
“I may live among them and do near-magical things with their money, but a wand, Potter… Much like a black card, one should never leave home without it.”
“Yes,” Harry managed, arching his neck, not caring when his head hit the plaster behind him with a thud. He scrabbled at his buttons, pulling them free, stepping on his own heels to get barefoot. Then he turned to Draco. “You too,” he said, hands sliding under Draco’s shirt. “Touch you.”
“You don’t believe that, or you don’t want to believe that?” Pansy asked.
Pansy, in her eagerness to listen in, slid her elbow so far forward she knocked into her plate. Granger glared at her. She smiled back.
He tried to focus on what was in front of him. The floor. The dim spotlights cast randomly about. The paintings, though they registered more as shapes than as works of art. Malfoy.
“Yes, sir, and might I say? Remarkably fast adaptation. It took—”
Weasley hesitated. "Yes?"
“That doesn’t make any sense.” It doesn’t, but that doesn’t matter. Older Draco is embarrassed at the speed with which his younger self colours, at his involuntary bucking when Potter’s hips suggest a deeper meaning to the punchline.
Harry was suddenly indignant. “You’re one to talk! Stalking around, watching other people…you know.” He trailed off, embarrassed, and tried to regroup. “And why aren’t you at Hogwarts, anyway?”
“That was good, you know,” Harry laughs, weakly, “I thought for a second…” Harry trails off. “Nothing. Nevermind.”
?” Hermione turned to him, eyebrows raised.
“Don’t you
“To the contrary say Nay.”
, but he simply didn’t have any need of anything in its pages. He’d moved on from that life. If he wanted top speeds, he had his choice of cars. If he wanted a view and the wind in his hair, there was always the roof at Shoreditch House.
“Okay?” Harry remained unclear as to why Norfolk suddenly merited such gravity.
Draco’s not sure he’d mind, though. He likes Harry like this, sitting over him, come dripping onto his unlaced Quidditch trousers, eyes shut, chest flushed.
But at least, Draco thinks, if this is it he will have tried.
“As a literary agent?”
Potter shrugged. “A couple of days.”
He sighed. “I’m now late to my appointment with him.”
"Cleaning spell, wait," Harry murmured, fumbling for his wand.
“We’ve got students to save and Basilisks to vanquish. And I believe I’m supposed to plunder your arse while we’re at it. Or are you just here for the company?”
Freezing. It’s freezing. Casting a warming charm in a mixed neighborhood seems unwise. I’ve no idea how long I’ll be here. Should’ve brought a stiff drink. Could use one. Not that I can afford to lose a clear head. Not when this much is at stake.
He said as much, again. That it’s just that he “doesn’t want to do anything that’s not done with…” he paused, took this deep, shaky breath, “…with love.”
Draco approached them quietly, willing his heart to slow, trying to ignore Potter’s presence at the door. He slipped one from the curve of its mother’s body and lifted her for examination. She mewled plaintively and scrabbled at the sleeve of his robes.
His stomach drops when he sees the handwriting in which it’s been addressed, and turns over completely when he sees what it’s written on.
“Thank you Galder. That’s helpful.”
“Not quite it, actually.”
Harry pauses. “Okay.”
? He needs help, he’s upset.”
When Harry presses in, Draco braces his hands against Harry’s shoulder and pushes and, for one horrible second, he worries that he’s misunderstood. Then the backs of his knees collide with the mattress and he realises that it’s an encouragement, not a rejection
Lifting his wand, he levitates the item and it falls into shape instantly. It's a pair of handcuffs. Well. Hogwarts students must be getting up to considerably more interesting things nowadays than he ever did at that age.
“The results are still under review for publication.” Draco drew their attention back. “Should’ve called me sooner.”
Harry cleared his throat. “Hi.”
Potter’s eyebrows climbed still higher. Draco couldn’t be certain if it was scepticism or intrigue, but he could feel the taut tension in the air between them. It certainly wasn’t a no. Perhaps with a bit of convincing…
, with your eye for fashion, who am I to argue? Keep them on. The only thing I might ask for is your stylist’s name.”
“And if I’m not?”
Draco’s stomach churned. He turned to Blaise. “Not a Vow?”
Harry watched him, eyes wide, as he lurched along, and didn’t answer right away.
“Greedy, are you?”
Harry studied him, and Draco resisted the urge to squirm under his gaze. “It’s… Well, not okay, obviously. Not really okay. But I understand you asking.”
“Thank you. Dr Malfoy, are there any special precautions you would advise beyond the use of an armed guard?”
Erumpent in a potions shop. Merlin. “Before,” Draco repeated.
Draco shirt is still untucked and it’s thoroughly wrinkled. He’s stepped back into his shoes and his belt is more or less buckled but his robes lay, untouched, in a pile on the floor. He shoves his hands in his pockets and catches Harry’s eye. “That desk.” He nods at the writing surface that’s got a spot of Harry’s ejaculate decorating the edge. “Is it yours?”
“Yes.”
If he agreed, the Head Auror would tell the wizarding press that they owed their safety and peace of mind to his sacrifice. He could be known, again, in all the right ways. No longer relegated to an open-plan office in the far reaches of the Department of Mysteries. The spotlight would warm his face, as it once had, and so would the praise of grateful witches and wizards across Britain. He would be their saviour, for once. The power he’d been promised, the access… Circe. It was everything he’d been working for, hoping for when he fought so hard to get his lowly underassistantship. It was everything he thought he would have to spend decades more trying to attain.
Draco cleared his throat and put his hand at the small of Harry’s back.
It’s real.
Silence hangs uncomfortably between them.
Draco gave a wry laugh. “All other attempts to digest them have left me with more questions than answers. Perhaps we ought to try it.”
“Well,” Draco surveyed Harry, whose skin heated, “it’s not as though I’m not getting anything out of it.”
He climbs into his sheets, naked, to wait.
“I want the surgery. I want this over with. The politics, all of it. I don’t care about the side effects if it means this whole damn thing is over. Do you know what it is to have the world eat at you in tiny, tiny increments? Use the people you love to get to you? It’s fucking torture, and I’d rather give up magic forever than live like that.”
From beyond the doorway – the kitchen, he thought – there was laughter. He strained to hear, but couldn’t make out the particulars.
Millie shrugged. “Doubtful.”
“Some things are.”
He didn’t have to consider. “Yes, I do. But whether it’s a force I want to be a part of…” He sighed. “I like my work. Some days—more days than most people, I think—I love my work. To give that up?”
- Test for reduced drag
Which Harry was determined that it wouldn't. He was an adult, and a damn competent Auror, and he wasn't going to let any of this get the better of him.
“Which Croaker is entirely wrong about.”
“And if that’s your position, I’m hard-pressed to see what playing at interrogator and prisoner is going to accomplish. I’d rather speak to my barrister, if it’s all the same to you.” It felt like Malfoy had been replaced with someone else. Like their dinner might have happened on another planet, in another lifetime.
“Know how good my tongue felt?” I open the phial and let a good amount drip onto my fingers. “That’s just the beginning.”
Draco laughed. “I sold £1.5 billion in securities this morning. One of the lads at Credit Suisse bet me a Goodman’s fillet and a bottle of Chateau Margaux that I couldn’t get a penny over 1.45, but the poor bastard’s in meetings all afternoon and can’t pay up until this evening.”
“That’s all you want?”
They both waited for him to go on, while Shacklebolt leaned back in his chair looking like he’d rather be elsewhere.
“That’s it?” Robards asked into the ensuing silence. “Running more tests? No disrespect, Dr Malfoy, but aren’t we bending over backwards here because you’re supposed to be the best?”
“I wasn’t aware I was being interrogated, Alistair.” He sounded almost amused.
He leans forward again, running his lips over the shaft, kissing the tip as gently as he can.
It’s not that the routines aren’t different, in ways large and small. These elves haven’t decorated for Christmas in three generations and Father and Mother have had more than a few words to say about their attempts. The dining room is smaller, less formal. The meals look less grand. But considering what (or who) has been eaten in the Manor dining room and how…perhaps that’s for the best. Perhaps the ostentation isn’t as important as Mother’s tearful, grateful toast about the unexpected, rather unbelievable, luck of being together at all this Christmas.
He strokes Draco’s cock, moves away just far enough to kiss Draco’s hipbone again, to suck the flesh there into his mouth hard enough to maybe leave a bruise. “Want me to stop?”
Draco’s smile was gone in an instant. “No.” He stepped forward and pulled at the hem of Harry’s jumper. “Definitely not.”
“Because they still had the Wand.”
“I don’t quite know how to put it. It was a lot of different things. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, of course.” He looked over to Draco, who nodded his acknowledgement. Harry continued. “I didn’t want to make my health any worse. Things I’ve already said, I guess.”
He has closed his eyes but not his mouth. He can’t see what he takes in: a sweet pink lip in his teeth, his tongue at the pulse of some boy’s throat. He licks and sucks and grins with the beat and you would not watch if you could help it. You would not know this face if you could help it.
Harry shrugged into his jumper. “Right, well. Guess I’ll have to wait with the rest of the non-committee members.”
By 1:59pm he was outside Potter’s door, watching the seconds tick away on his pocket watch. He let himself in at exactly two, only to find Potter deep in conversation with a fatherly-looking man in his 40s. Potter looked up, saw Draco and, rather apologetically, told his visitor he’d lost track of time. They shook hands, and the man nodded at Draco and saw himself out.
He huffed, but he felt his shoulders loosen. “I know. I do. It’s just… frustrating. To say the least.”
“Something that makes you happy. Focus on that happiness.”
No. He turns to the last clean quarter of a page and tries again, quill hesitating over the page.
“We’ll see.” Potter started walking again.
Draco shook his head, tiredness making it feel leaden. “You can’t keep beating the odds forever. That’s not a lack of faith. That’s…” He sighed. “It’s a different kind of faith, I suppose. Believing it’s important to protect someone from harm, rather than putting them in its way and trusting they’ll come through.”
Potter tilted his head the other way. “A garden, maybe? I don’t know it’s—” He cut himself off.
“Lovely, as I’m perfectly delighted to receive.”
“It was,” Draco admitted, and took another sip. “But ‘Potter’ had started to feel strange, too.”
“Stranger?”
Draco turns to face him, hands in his pockets.
“Who’s to say I’m not a perfectly well-mannered troll?”
“Okay.” Harry picks at his thumbnail. “Well. I can come back.”
“In this case, no. When he doesn’t—can’t possibly—mean what he says.”
Potter’s voice was even. Quiet. “Keeping them safe is the most important thing.”
Potter tugged at the buttons on Draco’s shirt, seeming to remember only halfway through that he wasn’t supposed to be eager. He slowed, but the message had already been sent, and Draco heard it perfectly. Saw it perfectly, as Potter brought a sliver of his chest and stomach into view.
His attention turns to my glass. “Where’s the bartender?”
“Too intense?”
“And is there a specific type of day? Can you describe it in brief?”
Perhaps they can slip in a quick last encounter. If they have enough time. Though, Draco reminds himself, it’s really quite a misuse of his time and therefore probably best avoided. As is this pointless navel-gazing.
“Yeah.”
“Robards and Proudfoot know full well that you’re impulsive. Everyone with a
“I guess I feel kind of… different? It’s more… do you know the feeling before a storm, when it feels like there’s a lot of energy in the air?”
It couldn’t have been more than thirty seconds between Draco’s arrival and Finnigan’s, but it felt much longer to Draco. He hadn’t been back since the end of his trial, and had never meant to return if he could help it.
It looked like Wizard Space, Harry thought. It had to be. But it didn’t feel like it. The only magic he could feel thrumming through the air was his own. The rest felt like cool air and warm light and electricity.
His stuff, he reminds himself. He wants his stuff. That’s what’s on the other side.
“A great deal about adjusting to magical exposure after time spent in the void.” It was true, if not the complete picture. But given what was at stake, and Potter’s strange, oft-maddening willingness to say no to Draco when he’d roll over for anyone else, Draco felt… well, any means, he reminded himself.
Harry’s expectant, and flushed, and a little breathless. “Yeah?”
“With all thanks to you.” Malfoy had never thought he’d owe genuine thanks to a Hufflepuff; life was, if nothing else, full of surprises. But Finch-Fletchley’s promise to deliver a cadre of Etonians and the like to diffuse the crowd, and his assistance in mediating between the Muggle and magical attendees, had been almost as invaluable as the painting he was threatening to splatter with Cab Sauv.
“If we must.”
Potter looked away as soon as Draco turned towards him. Cleared his throat. “Well.”
“Salt water.” She didn’t offer any additional explanation.
“Did they have a falling out?”
“And Potter? For the record, the grovelling doesn’t hurt.”
Draco’s smile vanished. He was glad – gladder than usual – that his job involved learning to perform a certain amount of bravado even when one’s stomach had begun to twist uncomfortably. He knew he hadn’t done anything the Ministry could bring him in for. He also knew that that didn’t always have much to do with whether they brought people in or not. “Your job involves coming to see me?”
It took Draco a moment to understand, then he snorted once. “Fair. But…” He sighed. “But worth it?”
“Tables are sorted by date of arrival. This corresponds with the rest of your lot.”
“I see you didn’t Vanish your thesaurus.”
“You were fine,” Draco mumbles.
She shook her head. “Couldn’t. Tried. But…” She frowned.
“Perhaps. But potentially a complicated way.”
Draco looks up, heart lifted, just a bit, by Harry’s words. “Okay. Let’s try.”
“Fine?” Harry squeaked.
The snake began to uncoil, and Harry could feel Malfoy’s hands trembling around his waist.
“Doctor Malfoy,” she began.
Harry hummed his agreement and tightened his arms around himself.
A horse from Ginny said about the same thing, as did a weasel from George, a dragonfly from Angelina, and a smaller fox from Seamus.
“And leave me to the wolves?”
“Is that relevant?” Draco didn’t pause before his question. He was well trained in deflection, and bloody thankful for it.
An air horn blared all of a sudden. Draco jumped. Lee leaned in to his microphone, his eyes still pinned to Draco. "We've been caught!! Harry Potter, it's Call or Delete day!"
Rather than seeming especially put out, Malfoy gave him an indulgently warm smile. “Never hurts to be prepared, does it,
You don’t get it. Why he’s left like that. But he has, he’s gone to the floor and found boys who strut and purr and buck against him.
“I do, but…” Draco’s heartbeat and the stability of his stomach have belonged to Potter for weeks now, but in this moment he suspects the rest of his body has joined the conspiracy. His lungs refuse to fill. His toes tingle. His cheeks are numb. His thighs are strung tight. His head is light. His chest is warm. His fingers feel heavy and sticky, like he’s stuck them in preserves without noticing. He’s not sure how to even get the next words out. Not sure what he’ll do if he gets them out and finds he’s misunderstood Potter’s meaning entirely.
Potter’s scowl deepened.
“Want me to suck your cock while I fuck you?”
“Hmm.” Draco sits back, considering. “Intriguing point. Though,” he raises an eyebrow, “I hope those won’t be the only new things we try.”
He watched Harry look the building over, its old stone façade, cream-coloured stone wrapping around the corner and down the Rue Soufflot to the Panthéon.
"Draco?" Harry sounded confused, now, and there was a hint of something else Draco couldn't suss out.
“Hilarious,” Draco retorts. “I thanked you for the berries five minutes ago.”
Still hopeful, Draco pressed for clarification. “To the end of the orchard, or back to the house?”
But no, no. Of course not. The Wizengamot had been firm on that. No permanent Banishment. Had to install a rubbish chute to Rubbish Incineration and Permanent Banishment so the keen minds of that department would see if he’d tried to discard anything valuable or suspiciously dark. As if those half-wit O.W.L. dropouts would know a dark object if it bit them on the arse.
It didn’t bother Draco, but it did intrigue him. Potter’s determination to avoid him was the sort of show of displeasure that Draco hadn’t seen that since Potter had arrived. And Potter in a snit was reassuringly familiar, compared to Potter the doormat diplomat.
“You’ve seen me,” he continues, cock stirring at the memory. “Please, Draco. Let me see you.”
“And what about you?” Potter turned to face him. “You did know. You knew exactly what that Hippogriff would do. What that necklace would do, and that mead, and that werewolf you let into the castle.”
“Will we be eating Potter’s records?” Millie leaned back and crossed her legs. “Or will you be clearing the table?”
“No,” Draco spat, “just the quality of it.”
“Negotiation?”
“120 over 80.” He removed the cuff and traded it for his stethoscope, rubbing it over his palm for warmth and bending over Potter to set the diaphragm against his chest. “Breathe deeply.”
It was good that you said all that, you know. For me, anyway.
“Yes.”
“Master returns.” The elf, who had bowed so low her oversized nose brushed the stone, did not look up.
“Yeah?” I manage.
Harry closed the distance between them in a flash, coming to Malfoy's side and taking in the sharp lines of his profile. "Looked more than all right to me."
Draco issues an exaggerated sigh and sets the morning
It takes Draco a solid half hour to recover his legs.
“So you’ve had it sent on to the Manor because…?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Joke all you like. I’m not actually stupid.” He waited for Draco to laugh.
“We can’t—” Granger struggled for words.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “It would be.”
“Coffee will help.”
“You don’t want them?” Draco asked, already knowing the answer. “After all that trouble you went to? Seems an awful shame. Ah, well.” He shook his head and raised his arm again, “
But he’d been through worse non-mortal peril, as well, he told himself. He’d been on stakeouts where he couldn’t leave his post for hours on end. He’d been on plenty of overnight stakeouts. He’d been on overnight stakeouts with Senior Aurors who smelled like cheese and took their shoes off in tight spaces and burped up Kingfisher and Curry while they were sharing Omnioculars.
“Mhmm.”
“No, don’t send her.”
Potter mumbled something that sounded distinctly like, “–clearly didn’t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room.”
“To remind him that he needs his magic. To convince him of my theory. To try and develop a treatment plan that won’t require surgery.”
All I want is the heat of Potter’s rectum gripping my cock, and the sight of him passing a thumb over the head of his prick to smooth his precome down the shaft.
Potter and I have a Seeker’s game planned for this Sunday morning. Warming the pitch up before the first match of the season. Must have my broom polished before then.
“Ah.”
* * *
Oh, Salazar. “How. Many?”
Malfoy, who’s kept his footing admirably, leans in and hisses, with breath that smells like peppermint tea. “You just have to have it your way.”
His pounding steps reverberated down the shaft like pennies falling into a well, sounding smaller and smaller as he left them behind him, and eventually vanishing into soundless nothing.
“What are you going to do if he doesn’t?”
“Not really.” Harry put his cup down and leaned on the embankment. “I did like walking last night. And that bar, and the idea of it, being able to be out in public with another man—with you—and not having such a divide between the two worlds. Just about as soon as you said it, I liked the idea of being here again. But moving… Where did this come from?”
Prippa nodded eagerly.
“Er, yeah.” In Harry’s periphery, Draco frowns. “I mean, I know. He’s helped me a lot.”
Draco sized her up, hoping to get some measure of Pansy by proxy. “For a warm welcome?”
*    *    *
“Pans, of all people, I don’t think Potter is one to make decisions based on one’s becoming-ness or lack thereof.”
For the second time in ten minutes, Draco’s got no idea what to do with his face. There’s nothing predictable about anything Potter has ever done. Accidentally Vanishing the entire contents of his home is no exception. “It’s hardly a common occurrence. Follow me.”
“Oh.” Harry sat up straighter as he realised, and tightened his grip on Draco’s side. “That means…?”
Not that Harry seems to mind. He pulls Draco towards him, halfway onto him, without hesitation, and opens his mouth to Draco, who’s quick to take what’s being offered.
“You think you’re so clever, don’t you? Luring me back here, trying to get me to feel your fabrics.”
“If anyone asks, you’ll say?”
He sighed. “Unfortunately, yes. But I can hardly consider it conclusive when it raises so many questions.”
Granger picked up as though they hadn’t spent the better part of three very long minutes in an awkwardly shared silence. “We have not yet, however, branched into your particular field.”
“There was one second where you looked so curious, I thought maybe, you know? Maybe if I told you it was okay, or if you said something, but then you just said something like ‘takes all sorts’ and went back to your pint. I never thought you might—” Harry stopped. Swallowed. Still couldn’t bring himself to say it. “If I said anything I thought that would be the end of it all. If I didn’t say anything at all, at least I could be around you. I was holding my breath, I guess, and if I’d asked and you’d said no—hell, maybe if I’d asked and you’d said yes, and I’d told you I’d rented a one-bedroom five minutes outside of Museum Square and you’d offered to expand the space or transfigure a second bed or any of those things that you’d have been well within your right to do, because we were friends, and of course you would want your own space—then what? Maybe I was holding my breath because it was the only breath I had.”
But then, he realises, smiling against Potter’s mouth, he’s not being forced. He’ll take both. Have his cake and eat Potter, too.
Blaise interrupts before she can settle on a follow-up. “For what, exactly?”
"Oh." Potter shifted, half stood and then sat back down. "Sorry."
“Still sure,” Harry said.
“That’s when I met him,” Luna said. “A few months after that trip. Properly, not in a dungeon.”
In response, Draco unhooked the clasp on his robes and levitated them to a hook inside one of the stalls. “Make sure everything lands outside of the circle.”
“Peace.” Potter sounded raw.
, it’s all I can do not to plough into him.
Malfoy lifted his arm and Edgar took flight again. Instead of rising straight up and staying there, Edgar took a short lap of the marsh.
“And you plan to faithfully relay that theory and its importance to a Mind Healer?”
Ron raised an eyebrow higher, and it was clear that his restraint was wavering. “We have a stack of detailed crime scene drawings, all of which were restricted to a small group of Aurors with high-level security clearance. The only other person who could have seen them is the murderer. Malfoy’s not an Auror with high-level security clearance. How the bloody hell else does he know the scenes? Down to the details? The position of the bodies, Harry. The way they bloody died.”
The smooth syllables slipped over Harry’s tongue. He could feel Malfoy shudder and lean forward behind him.
And still, he pants for more. I can feel myself getting closer.
“I’m not lying.”
At least relying on instinct to see him through was the kind of strategy he could get behind.
As he spoke, Malfoy began to pound his arse, moaning low in his throat and grabbing at Harry’s hip and the edge of the bar.
“And the smell. Are you aware that there’s a smell? There is. The smell of the unshowered masses. Or perhaps you’re so unshowered as to pass for an entire mass yourself.”
“Door?”
* * *
Harry stilled, his breath still coming quickly, but suddenly ragged in a different way. Slowly, cautiously, he freed his wrist from the loose circle of Draco’s fingers and stepped back. “What?”
“You tried a flip without asking for instruction, and wound up taking a head first trip into Wiltshire’s finest dirt.”
“Faster, maybe?”
“Okay,” he says slowly. “How about this.” He grabs a piece of parchment from Draco’s stack and turns it over. “Can I have a quill?”
“So you keep saying, yet you keep your distance.”
“Art, though?” Potter sounded…entranced, maybe? Or confused? His face was cast in shadow. Draco wished it wasn’t.
“Very well, then. I imagine you’ll be wanting home delivery, as well?”
Harry starts at the noise and gives up the pretence of looking elsewhere. He stares at Draco, shocked at the suggestion that Draco will be giving him more than is required. That Draco will be giving in.
Harry doesn’t. Saying so, and saying so to Malfoy, though…
Except that Unspeakable Wardwell was present, side by side with Robards at the end of the long oval table, and they’d hardly try it on a senior Unspeakable.
Potter crosses an ankle over the opposite knee and rests folded hands on his lap. His face is unusually, unfairly, blank.
Shacklebolt stood and extended a hand. “Mister Malfoy.”
“Tell me.”
, Unspeakable Croaker, that we have a common purpose and it isn’t helped by useless posturing.”
“No need. There will be more sooner or later.”
“That one?” Draco repeats.
“The hell we can’t,” Croaker spluttered.
At least it’s not Marcel’s pants. Yet.
He left for Titchwell instead, and spent his lunch walking along the dunes until his fingers were freezing and he couldn’t feel his nose. He wondered if Malfoy ever came out there, and if he did whether it was to work or just to look. He thought about how good Malfoy had looked when he was relaxing over a pint, back when, and how funny he’d been when they’d walk down Brompton Road taking the piss out of tourists. He thought about how shocked Malfoy had looked when Harry had taken him to the pub with his friends the first time, and how quickly it had turned to hunger after a few pints. He thought about how he’d come back from Amsterdam to a stack of letters he’d sent to Malfoy, returned unopened and interspersed with his postcards, and how Malfoy had never spoken to him again.
and you wouldn’t say a word about us to your friends, let alone the fucking Wizengamot.”
“Tut, tut, Potter. No. Pierre Frey of Paris, expert craftsmen weaving wool and silk onto a custom designed frame with a Savonnerie knot. Though I suppose compliments are due; I wouldn’t have thought you knew a Persian rug from a bathmat.”
“I agree,” Draco said. “A change to his magical status would not detract from either his accomplishments or his character. The length and quality of his life, on the other hand…”
“Granger,” Blaise interjected.
It’s several long, delicious moments before they withdraw. Draco looks almost stunned. Harry certainly feels it, the impact of the kiss reaching to his toes.
Though the headline suggests that perhaps witches are not his quarry.
“Which are part of a temporary disruption, and which do not interfere with your living arrangements.”
Draco worked on remembering what words were, and how to use them in ways distinguishable from self-immolation.
Potter eyed him sceptically. “Is it? I don’t like it, especially.”
He tried to strike up a rhythm, but Malfoy beat him to it. Fingers threaded through his hair and Malfoy's hand held him firmly in place as he thrust up into Harry's mouth. His grip was harder now and Harry felt the pull on his scalp, but he didn't mind, not when his fingers were digging into the well-pressed crease on the back of Malfoy's trousers and Malfoy's cock was hitting the back of his throat and he was taking it, all of it, everything Malfoy threw at him. Not when it was one more sensation driving him closer to an edge he hadn't known before his last night with Malfoy, a blissful, empty depth made by the blurring together of the strain at the edge of his mouth and the tightness at the back of his throat and the pinch of Malfoy's fingers on his shoulder and the reverberations of Malfoy's groans, and his own, and the soft roughness of wool against his skin.
Draco snorts and nudges Harry with his elbow. “Well done.”
“Because you called.”
He traces his fingers over Draco’s button. “Please,” he whispers again. “Let me.”
“But now—Draco?”
“The cloak, Potter. You can’t just keep it.”
“I,” Harry coughs again, banging a fist into his chest to clear it. “I can.” He pouts.
“It’s my fucking
“The Wizengamot’s schedule operates independently of the Minister’s office. We didn’t know about it at the time.”
Blaise groaned. “Work? There was going to be food.”
Draco squeezed the stems between his hands.
“It’s exactly how they taste. It could’ve been October, fresh off the branch. I swear to you, that’s exactly it.” He offered Potter back the apple he’d taken a bite of. “Try another?”
“Really? What is there?”
“No, it’s fine. I’m not too tired to talk.”
Harry sighed. “Right.”
He disregards the idea before it’s even fully formed. Groveling lost its appeal about the time His Noselessness moved in, and it’s not the sort of thing Potter’s likely to appreciate anyway.
Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and stepped back into a dueling stance. Draco wondered if he noticed or if it was pure habit. He wondered, too, if it meant he was about to see Harry’s competitive side, which made his heart race in a way that didn’t feel anything like fear or trepidation.
Draco cleared his throat. “How are you feeling?”
totally impartial on the question."
“Or suck you?”
“So says the man who’s in his stocking feet five minutes before a charity ball.”
“Yes.”
“Ginger?”
- Granger and Potter are nevertheless working together on more charitable projects.
He set a cucumber down next to the teapot with a satisfied sigh. “Clear?”
“There. Are. No. Other. Men.”
It wasn’t that it didn’t last long enough, but that it was so unreal, so unbelievably fantastic, that the minutes blurred together. It wasn’t that it wasn’t long, but that it seemed not to be time. And then he was stroking himself while I thrust into him, and his breathing grew faster, his grip on my shoulders stronger, and then he was coming, arching and groaning and calling my name, and I let go of everything, filled him, let it carry me away entirely.
“I’m going to suggest something you won’t like.”
,” Malfoy repeated.
He’s met, at first, with the same inscrutability he’s had to break through so many times. Then Draco exhales and nods his assent.
He felt the tug of Potter’s magic against his own, but it wasn’t enough to end his spell.
It’s time to start taking it back. All of it. The power, the place in society, the Manor. All of it.
Potter’s head snapped up. “Are you seriously arguing that having Death Eaters’ relatives show up at your party is good for society?”
He rolled his eyes.
“Did I?”
If Draco lived to be two hundred, he thought he’d never forget the sound of that.
Granger frowned.
He doesn’t expect the sweetness of Potter’s saliva, or the plumpness of his lips. Doesn’t expect to feel the heat of it radiate through his chest. Doesn’t expect Potter to be the kind of kisser who moves with it, who rolls his hips and arches his back in time with the pressure of his lips. Doesn’t expect the firm pressure of Potter’s fingertips at his neck and on his arm, or the insistent tugging at his collar, or the way Potter bucks his hips to throw Draco off guard, to make sure Draco falls into him so that their bodies are pressed together. He doesn’t expect to mirror Potter’s gasps and moans.
Draco cracks a smile. “Yes.”
“They are your things, but I would advise against putting century-old silk on the floor.”
“No,” Harry crosses his arms, “and you know it.”
Draco sighed, “Yes, Potter. Have you already forgotten that I told you to strip?”
It slid free without struggle, and around Malfoy's wrists just as easily. Harry pulled it tight around them and took half a step back to admire his work.
“The elves?”
- Dislikes: Jelly Slugs, Pepper Imps, Lemon Sherbets, red currant rum, Gillywater
cock would feel good, but
Draco waved a hand for him to stop, and took a long sip of water. “Fine,” he coughed. “It’s fine.” He cleared his throat. “Surprising, but I understand the unique charm of Pansy Parkinson. That was actually a bit of food down the wrong way.”
“Outside of the void, if you will.”
"A hand." Harry deadpanned. "Is that what you want?" Draco wondered if the low, angry vibration he felt in Harry's voice would came through over the wireless. It was better than wondering if their listeners had got the subtext, and much better than wondering what the subtext might mean for him.
“’Kay,” he gasps. “Okay.”
Shacklebolt nodded. “Look for my memo.”
“No, Harry. This is too important. And you’ve promised McGonagall. And anyway, if there’s actually a problem maybe we can fix it.”
“Another minute, though. You do need the rest.”
Harry’s mouth quirks into a smile and his hands move to his waistband. He unbuttons the single button, revealing the laces beneath. He’s done them up properly. Habit. Even in the middle of a snit, Draco thinks he would’ve done the same.
“Wait.”
“And Blaise has only got the 12-year and his collection of vodkas, the heathen. Plus, your chairs are far more comfortable than the torture devices he tries to pass off as furniture.”
“Right.” Potter took the wand tentatively, barely gripping the shaft. “Right.”
“No!” Draco exclaimed, immediately and without thinking. He could feel his cheeks heat. “No, I haven’t. Just a bit surprised, I suppose.”
.” Draco shoves the lacy red slip of fabric across the table. “The Vanishing Department has returned your item. You are free to leave.”
“Fuck my face,” Sydney whined, and bit at Draco’s hip.
“Er.” Potter ran a hand through his hair, as if it might make any sort of difference in either his appearance or Draco’s disposition. “Yes?”
“No?” Ron sounded more furious than querulous. “Who knows what sort of games he’s been playing? What he could’ve done with you? What he might’ve done tonight, or the next— Fuck, Harry. Did you see the evidence? Are you really giving that ferret—that murderous, Death-Eating ferret—the benefit of the doubt?”
“Of course I have.”
“Parkinson,” Harry replied warily, clearly uncertain of what he was seeing.
“I love touching you.”
There are whispers everywhere.
“That doesn’t make it any more ethical for me to stay on.”
“What next?” Harry’s lips are flushed pink and Draco can’t imagine he doesn’t have a dozen ideas,
Draco did, turning to watch Potter’s reaction to stepping over the threshold.
“My shoes are inside.”
“That all sounds fine.”
It makes Draco’s chest ache. “Right.” It’s more decisive than he expects. But that’s right, too. He is certain, and Harry is right.
“Might want to call for them.”
He stares back, just remembering to set his own box down and step away.
Draco frowns, squares a pile of letters and pushes them aside. “Pass the strawberries, would you?”
Draco leaned over and shouted down the bar, and waited for the bartender to return with two glasses. He handed Harry a pint and held his Scotch up to cheers.
“Yes.”
Potter’s note came after breakfast the next morning. He asked Draco if they could have their next meeting in the conservatory after lunch, and added that he’d picked a Mind Healer.
“Hands above your head and don’t move them.”
“About Kingsley?”
“Mmm,” Draco agrees.
“There’s more to it than that, but potentially, yes.”
“You’ve left out all the stuff about the war,” Pansy adds.
Potter’s breath was shallow and Draco thought he saw wetness collecting in the corners of his eyes. “No,” he managed, barely even a whisper. “You.”
“Oh, yes.”
“Just to see what happens?”
Malfoy pressed his lips together and refused to speak.
Draco’s confusion must be showing; Potter leans back, arms crossed over his chest, and sighs. “You left.”
Draco spoke before he could talk himself out of it. “Have you named them?”
“Yeah.” Harry coughs, trying to clear the taste of the Potion from his mouth. “Stay.”
Millie laughed. “Four Aurors will arrive at half one. Finnigan and Weasley—Ronald—volunteered for the job, then I think it’ll be Helen Goshawk and Ella Wilkins. Weasley—Percy—is working on a story to explain the guard. Robards is still saying no to anything more, and Shacklebolt says no to a closed court. Potter’s not as useful if the media aren’t aware he’s involved. Of course.” Millie rolled her eyes in sympathy with Draco’s open disdain. “The hearing may last several hours. He’s been asked to write a statement, and there will be questions from the Wizengamot. Shacklebolt would like to make him available to the press afterwards, but we’ll see.” She leaned in conspiratorially. “Between us, Granger’s been on a bit of a tear.” She grinned. “It’s impressive. I wouldn’t bet on Shacklebolt winning that one.”
“I really don’t mean to interrupt.”
of a danger to himself and others.”
Harry swallows. “Please.”
“Next week?” Robards balked.
, even
He looked up with a friendly smile when Draco entered, though was visibly startled to see that he was alone.
“Then why are you drinking?” Potter retorted.
“I could do with a walk.”
Potter didn’t–seemed unable to–look at him. He moved Draco’s hand away from the button. “Let me.”
It’s experimental at first. A knee between Malfoy’s two. The slow lean forward. The dropping of a hand next to Malfoy’s face.
Nor would he have been able to, after Harry emerged in his own uniform half a minute later.
He laughs, a half-nervous, half-pleased huff of air that I can’t take any offence to. He sounds pleased. As well he should be.
“What’s your point, Malfoy?” It came out muffled, spoken mostly into the heel of Potter’s palm.
He didn’t have to wonder long. He almost jumped when something warm brushed the side of his hand, then realised it was Draco’s hand against his own, Draco’s little finger coming to hook around his. He had to close his eyes against the sensation of it, and tried not to revel so deeply in it that he lost track of himself.
Draco couldn’t stop a sharp laugh. “I see your point. You do have a mental picture, though?”
Potter stopped abruptly, then resumed rubbing Granger’s back, even as she assured him she was fine.
He just wants to walk somewhere without anyone grabbing at him. Wants to take long strides and breathe air that doesn’t smell like 12 Grimmauld Place. He walks towards the Thames – just for somewhere to walk – but there are more and more people the closer he gets and when he bumps into two confused Muggles at once he ducks into an alley, hiding himself behind a skip to stuff his cloak into the Mokeskin pouch he still wears.
Silenced echoed through the room.
“What about the Muggle world?”
“Bullshit. It was personalised and in your handwriting.”
After a moment’s consideration, Harry thought it best for all involved if he took that as a yes.
Draco turns around, alarmed. “How many people have the bloody story?”
He didn’t take much coaxing. A mumbled incantation, the head of his cock pressed against me, and a magnificent fullness that left me arching and aching, scrambling for purchase as he withdrew and entered me again.
Potter had the good grace to look vaguely chagrined at the reference to their last conversation as he climbed to his feet. “About that.”
fucked Finch-Fletchley before. And no one’s ever fucked Pansy before, unless you count the entirety of Slytherin house and, at this point, half the members of Dumbledore’s Army. How she keeps it a secret I’ll never know, but her strategy is painfully obvious: she’s got spectacular tits and no reservations about using them, or that stupid charm she’s got wedged between them.
He added another finger first, letting Potter adjust; which he did quickly, readily. Eagerly.
“You should try the coffee somewhere real next time. There’s a café near my flat—well, several, but a favourite one, if you’d want to.”
If he hadn’t been able to believe Malfoy before, something in his kiss spoke to the reality of his passion. There wasn’t anything cold or calculating about it. It was open. It sought him out. It had depth. He felt it. From the way Malfoy exhaled a moan into his mouth, he thought Malfoy felt it too.
The sort of singular fixation Potter brings to everything he does might, in some circles, be considered a liability. He has since admitted it would’ve spelled the death of his Auror career even if he hadn’t left voluntarily. He’d pick a case and let it become him, assignments be damned. Not that anyone who’s faced him on the Quidditch pitch could think otherwise.
Another unfortunate pause preceded Draco’s answer. He was overdue for one of those games, if his poker face was suddenly failing him. “I suppose that’s for me to know.”
- Also spends time with Longbottom, Thomas, Finnigan, Abbott, Bones
Draco snapped his head to look. He’d known freeing the elves would lead to disaster sooner or later. Though, upon examination, there wasn’t anything there.
At last, Draco exhaled and shook his head. He drew a shaky breath. “Well. I think we know, then.”
“Yeah.”
“Want you,” Harry breathes.
Draco was two seconds from pulling out his hair. “And if he decided to jump off the Eiffel Tower, you’d let him do that too? Hold his hand on the way up?”
“Oh, and you’re the one to teach me? Is that what this is?” Potter is advancing, step by step. Draco does his best to look concerned.
And then he was kissing me, his fingers in my hair, pulling me closer, onto my feet. Everything went cold when he stepped away.
“Just like that, with your hand, Merlin, no, harder.”
“That, what, it’s ‘not of any personal concern’? What does that mean, exactly?”
Millie kicked him under the table. He was almost certain he didn’t flinch.
“Go on in,” she droned, picking up a copy of
He was wearing a three-piece charcoal grey wool suit, all of it fitting like a glove over a pale blue dress shirt, the collar starched so crisply Harry wondered if he should classify it as a weapon.
Potter failed to repress a sigh, but nodded.
“Potter discharged my life debt before the trials, in exchange for the one he owed my mother. Life debts all around, Granger. I don’t owe him a thing.”
," he spat. "You're so full of shit, Malfoy. I've told you why I've come. If you're just going to give me the runaround and parade your smug attempts at logic all over the place, I'll see myself out."
Millie was openly intrigued, and Draco grinned at both of them. “Let’s have it.”
It all started to feel so mad so quickly that when an owl did alight on a fencepost in front of him, Harry figured it couldn’t be for him.
“I get the point.”
There was a long moment’s silence. Draco lowered his hand and took a long sip. It had got warm. Waste of good gin, that was. Then he heard Potter’s boots shuffle across the carpet, heard the leather of his jacket against the leather of the sofa as he retrieved it, heard the quiet “
A nervous knot bubbles into Harry’s stomach.
“Yes, well,” Draco repeated, trying for testy. It was over. And he’d got what he wanted, as he always did.
“Let me get this straight. You were trying to clean out your house. You’ve spent a substantial amount of time doing that. Now, having succeeded at it, you would like to undo it?”
“We need—well. We need bait.”
Pansy paused, looking quite thrown off.
Still caught up in the state of mind that seemed to come from running, Potter complied without objection.
It’s a long moment before Harry feels Draco stir, before he plants his palm on the tabletop and pushes away.
“What would be?”
“And?”
“They’re very sought after at the moment. There’s no one else who has the same fundraising ability or political influence. That was the whole problem, wasn’t it? So for him to set out on his own—everyone thinks it’s going to be a force.”
And there he was, with his hand reaching for mine, telling me he’d just borrowed the name, there was no Trevor, there wasn’t anyone else. It was just that he needed to know it meant something, that he’d seen what actions came from hate, from apathy, from manipulation on both sides of the war. That he knew I knew what he meant, because he knew I’d seen it too. Knew that I knew how much those things could hurt someone. Knew that there was something more between us – wasn’t there?
Potter slowed. “I—Is that a medical order?”
“You redecorated.”
“And why? Why there?”
“Obviously.”
“It is. For me, at least. But our positions during the war were quite different.”
“Or both?”
Draco furrows his brow. “So?”
That wasn’t what he’d meant to convey, but… “Yes.”
. A command, a plea. Between his body and Malfoy’s, his cock was full and aching with want. He stilled his hips. Malfoy followed immediately. He wrapped his legs around Malfoy and levered himself up, until they were face to face, Malfoy still deep inside him. The grey of Malfoy’s eyes was barely visible around his pupils; he started to ask, “Wh—?”
“And for harnessing wandless magic,” Croaker added, a repulsively dreamy look on his face. “Or spell amplification. Salazar and Godric both.”
They stand, staring at each other in silence, for a moment that seems to drag on endlessly. Draco’s stomach feels tight and sour and, worst of all, he’s not exactly sure why. He’s called far worse on a fairly regular basis. Potter’s outburst is pure sentimentality, mawkish and simple, the sort of thing he can barely tolerate at the best of times. It’s all the more reason to get Potter out of here as quickly as possible.
, he thought.
But he reckoned even the blobs were better than hours of interminable tossing and turning.
“Fine.” Granger was clearly struggling to ignore his frustration. “How so?”
“Muggle shops they bring them in from other parts of the world.”
“On your own head be it.”
“Muggle attacks?” Wilkins asked. “Knives, thrown objects?”
He loves this about Harry. His expressiveness. Knowing exactly how, and how much, he likes it. Knowing what it means when he starts to roll his hips like this.
“You want more of it, don’t you?”
“Yes. I suppose we should.” Malfoy started towards the door.
“At the charms work or the daring?”
“Yes, sales. It’s a business, Potter. You’re good for business.”
Eventually, Draco stands and extends a hand towards Harry.
I can. I slip a third finger into him, and he’s so slippery, so open, it goes like it’s nothing. When I move to slide them out again he tightens around me, determined to keep them there. I suck him down so far he’s hitting the back of my throat, thinking it might release the grip he’s got on my fingers, but it’s quite the opposite. He bears down harder, arching his back and making it almost impossible for me to move.
Harry stood. Malfoy didn't react as he stepped forward, nor as he moved his legs to bracket Malfoy's knees. He offered only the tiniest exhale when Harry leaned forward, slipping his hands onto the edge of the desk between Malfoy's hips and his thumbs.  It took conscious effort not to press his body into Malfoy's entirely. To hold something back.
“Please….fuck, Draco. Want, want.”
“Yes, I think so.” Potter shrugged, returning to total calm. “We worked on a potions case a while back and had to read a lot of journals for that.”
“Yes,” Harry croaks, nodding desperately. “Yes, please.”
“What is this?” He held out the brochure, now creased down the middle from its stay in his pocket.
Potter stares at him, intent and expectant.
“I’m sorry.”
Draco reached out an open palm and Harry dropped the cock ring into it. “Nifty device.”
“You’ve seen me do it. You know I’m perfectly capable.”
He shrugged. “Not really.”
“Stop.”
“But you do have it.”
“As you see fit?” An unmistakable note of panic tinged Granger’s voice. “I’m sorry, Dr Malfoy, but that really won’t work.”
When he did lift his head it was with clear hesitation, and the apology was out of his mouth before Draco had a chance to greet him. “I’m sorry about Parkinson. Pansy. It was rude of me.” He sighed and closed the book. “I’m happy to apologise. I should. It’s gracious of you to have me here, and I don’t mean to make your life more difficult.”
Potter baulks. “You heartless bastard. What the fuck is your problem?"
Malfoy hadn’t told him about any of this. Not a word. His fingers itched to re-open the folder. Had Malfoy really mortgaged Malfoy Manor? Was that
“I didn’t say that.”
“An enterprising Wizard could think of plenty of other things to do with an item like that.”
He lets himself be pushed to sit back against the bed. He’s on the verge of pulling Draco down on top of him when he realises he’s at eye level to Draco’s waist, and there’s something he’s been wanting to try again.
I’d say it was funny that it was Sectumsempra, but it’s really not funny at all. If I caused one, it at least seems fair that I should stay with you while you recover from the next. And I’ve woken up here enough times to know that it’s scary to do it alone. And I don’t want you to be scared. I think we’ve both had enough of that.
“Merlin’s fucking pants.” Potter laughed and turned away again, walking across the room as he couldn’t stand being within a dozen feet of Draco. “It’s not that you’re great at it, it’s just that you’re better than everyone else?”
“Right.” Harry looks over at the pile. It’s massive. He wouldn’t even know where to begin. Though obviously, he can figure it out. He’s an adult and, regardless of what Malfoy may think, getting dressed is not actually beyond him. “Yeah. Okay.”
“What?” He jerks up at that. “What? You can’t, that’s—”
“Fuck, you’re hard.”
“Would you be able to cast a spell right now?”
“Yes.”
“What? Super wizard?”
Draco slowed and pointed. “Look down.”
“Not that. Turn around.”
“Why does it matter? Draco–” he looks at Draco, shakes his head, mumbles something to himself. “Did you hear anything I said to you the other night?”
Dark and light.” Robards spoke slowly. Draco would’ve described it as deliberate, if he thought Robards capable of that sort of intentionality. “In their looks, in their magic, in their… activities. The contrast seems to be the killer’s focus. We’ve seen it in the way he treats the bodies, as well. He scars them, marks them with runes for… well, for balance, essentially.” Robards stopped again, as though waiting for questions.
After a quick stop in the exam room for his bag, Draco waited for Potter on the terrace. He was too impatient to even manage to take a seat on a newly reconstructed bench. Though it certainly didn’t feel like Potter was in a similar rush.
“Sure,” Harry said. “I’ll ask Lobsey.”
“Or another?” Draco’s stomach turns over.
Harry stumbles back, hand to lips, and stares, only to be met with a look of appalled shock.
He heard rustling behind him as Potter approached. “Not?”
With a wave of his wand, Draco closes the door. “Wanker? If you’ll recall, that was never my preference.”
* * *
“Fuck, your mouth. Please, Malfoy, need your mouth.”
“Which is?”
“In the first few weeks of trying to do it the other way. First month, maybe. Never since then.”
Potter was sitting, quite unassumingly, in a yellow bergère, with a book closed neatly in his lap, his index finger still marking his place. Between a white Aran jumper and not-quite-brown Muggle trousers, he was practically camouflaged into the room. He didn’t move until Granger approached him, her arms out and voice laden with worry, asking how he was, how he was feeling, what he needed. Potter shook his head, smiled, stood, and folded her into a hug, and Draco thought he could lip-read a few mumbled reassurances. At least, the general idea was clear.
Potter’s frown deepened. They remained in silence as they reached and walked up the stairs, as they made their way through the winding slate paths of the garden, and were almost back to the steps before Potter spoke. “I don’t want to be unhelpful.”
“I’ll be here when you wake.”
, these things take
At least he’s not feigning innocence.
got teeth. Interesting.”
upset about the blind item. Not exactly a pleasant day at work, thanks very much. Pretty crap move of you, really. I mean—is that what you asked me here to apologise for?”
Unfortunately, getting to Longbottom will be harder than getting to Pansy (obviously) or Slughorn. He’s actually on the right side of things, which significantly decreases opportunities for extortion. They have money, so bribery won’t work. None of us could think of any particularly embarrassing information aside from his already well-known general incompetence.
Harry perched on the edge of a settee. Granger looked between it and the one opposite and seemed to ask him where she should go. He shrugged. To her credit, again, she insisted, gently, that he tell her.
He blinks. Catches Harry’s eye. “Warm is not a bad thing.”
The moment stretches on. Draco realises he’s stopped breathing, but it takes several more seconds for him to start again. To remind himself that
“No,” Millie said. “I don’t think it is, actually.”
“Their father must have been a Kneazle. Their mother is a cat. She may not be able to provide enough nourishment to support their magical growth, in which case we’d supplement her milk with store-bought Kneazle milk or dandelion root.”
“There wasn’t any question.”
“I will find an answer, Potter.”
Weasley
Draco turned to books, then, instead of thinking any more about it. They had the advantage of offering familiarity. The feeling of parchment against his fingertips, the sound of pages turning. The promise that if he kept looking he might find the perfect bit of information, the key to this puzzle. It had happened before. Books on illnesses, on wandlore, on the history of magic. And the Manor had volumes he hadn’t seen in ages, let alone thought to check. There would be an answer there. There had to be.
“It has,” Robards reiterated, and Draco realised it was more threat than pleasantry.
The sort of purpose he’s in a rather good position to see through.
Harry cracked a smile and started for the door.
He hesitates, seeking Draco’s eyes. “You’re sure?”
Except, he realised, he didn’t. He wanted Harry, and Harry had been perfectly clear about wanting him back, and there was no reason at all that he couldn’t just do it. So he did. Stepped forward and hooked an arm around Harry’s waist and watched him go wide-eyed and then breathless as he pulled him closer, and though he couldn’t be certain afterwards, he though Harry might actually have kissed him first.
And Malfoy’s sofa was probably “supportive,” and it probably cost thousands of pounds, but it was hard as a bloody rock.
In the cloak, it is a moment’s work to grasp it.
I’m rock hard and newly grateful for my trousers. It’s hard enough not to slip into him as it is. So much as touching my cock would incendiary.
He didn’t stop.
“No.” Potter paused. “But isn’t it worth a shot?
, he added to himself “—you do. And the Kneazles. The way you were with the apples. I think you love magic, or you could do if you had the chance to use it for something other than war or work.”
He pushed back from the desk, returned two of the three pamphlets to their piles, and set off in search of Malfoy.
Potter’s head was bowed, but Draco thought he saw his eyes come back up to Draco’s cuffs, first one and then the other.
“Yes.” Draco sighed. “To be entirely honest, I… haven’t especially wanted to go to the Ministry. I don’t have the fondest memories, nor do I expect a warm reception.”
“Only if you want to risk losing our place in line.”
“Right,” Harry scoffed. “Unless your killing’s better than your fucking, I think not.”
He doesn’t respond, except with the smallest cant of his hips.
I’m glad he’s looking at the ceiling instead of my face. I doubt this particular combination of shock and smugness would be quite my best look.
Harry felt as though his heart had stopped.
Draco ignores him.
Draco cut him off before he could talk. “I bet you are. I bet your arse is gagging for it, Potter, just like you were gagging for me.”
Because only two of the Howlers have come from Lucius, and none from Narcissa, and the threats to have Draco sectioned at St. Mungo’s have no real weight, Draco is assured by legal.
“Then how?” Harry didn’t care that his voice was thick with desperation.
“It’s – what?”
“What do you do?”
And when a determined Pansy has the subtlety of an Manticore.
“Fine,” Harry laughed. “But only because I’ve missed your company so much.”
Harry ploughs on before Draco can respond.
