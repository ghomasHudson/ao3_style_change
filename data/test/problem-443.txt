He collapsed against the desk surface while Harry carefully began to pull out.  He reached for his wand and cast a cleaning charm over both of them before gathering Draco in his arms and sinking to the floor.  They lay like that for a while, though neither could really say how long it truly was.
"P?  Who the hell is P?"  He muttered aloud. "Pansy maybe?  No, it's not her handwriting."  He'd know Pansy's handwriting anywhere, with its flowery loops and delicate slant. No, this definitely wasn't Pansy's writing. Not to mention, she wouldn't pull a prank like this. She might send him a letter like this to cheer him up, she hated when he acted so self-conscious, but she certainly wouldn't add any of the sexual shit. Draco was pretty sure she was gayer than he was, which was saying a lot.  Letting out a frustrated sigh, he set the letter down and leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes.
Draco frowned a bit as they continued to wend their way through the maze of hallways that eventually led to the potions classroom, and subsequently Draco's office.  The corridors were quiet in the Sunday calm and seemed to be nearly deserted, save for the odd prefect on patrol, leaving him to his own thoughts and Potter's distant words.  If he was being honest with himself, Draco was focusing more on that particularly disturbing floppy flutter, and what it definitely did not mean, than on Potter's deep, rumbling ramble.
Reluctantly, Harry wrenched himself away from the kiss, taking a step back as he did so. Draco whined at the loss of bodily contact and reached forward to grab Harry's shirt and drag him back again, but a hand on his wrist stopped him. He looked into Harry's eyes, only to get lost in their viridescent depths. "If we keep going, there's no going back," Harry warned. "I'm not planning on letting go anytime soon, so if you don't want this, if you don't want me, say so right now."
So, with his hands shoved deep in his pockets, he began to slowly walk towards his ex-rival.  It wasn't until he was about ten feet away that Potter finally took notice of him, seemingly startled by the knowledge that he wasn't alone anymore.  His head whipped around, right as he let loose another stone.  Only this one didn't skip, it hit the water with an impressive splash and sank to the bottom of the lake, while Potter stared.  And stared and stared.
"Yes, I'm well aware of that, Golden Boy.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the entire Wizarding World is aware of that."
"Well, yeah. I thought that was obvious.  Was it not?  I mean, considering what just happened and all.  The letter was actually what I had initially come to talk to you about."
Of course, when you have been obsessed with someone for seven years, it can be hard to put them out of your mind and simply move on. "Not that I have ever been obsessed with Draco," thought Harry. "I was merely curious as to what he had been doing. I was suspicious, is all. And rightly so. So then why haven't I been able to get him off my mind?" Harry continued to speculate over his habits concerning the Slytherin as he let his eyes rove over Draco's lithe form. With his slender hips and gorgeously tight ass, Draco Malfoy was the epitome of what Harry considered to be sexy. "Wait? Did I just...? No, I'm admiring him. That's all. I find him aesthetically pleasing. I am most certainly not attracted to Draco Malfoy of all people."
"Haven't the faintest, Ms. Marks." Harry managed to squeak out, before shaking his head and continuing on with his lecture.  It was almost ten minutes before the end of class and by the time he let his students go for the day, all Harry could think of was Draco and his office.  Apparently, many of his students were in the same boat, as they shot a good deal of poorly concealed curious glances at the wooden door as they left.
Potter was still staring, one black eyebrow arched in either confusion or suspicion, Draco really couldn't tell which though.  He was standing stock still, his muscular frame silhouetted against the gently lapping waters of the Black Lake.  He looked so shocked Draco had spoken to him that the blonde was beginning to get nervous.  He looked back down at his feet, and then shot a fleeting glance over towards the  Forbidden Forest, distinctly wishing a rouge hippogriff would come charging out of the trees and attack him.  Maybe an angry werewolf would be better?  Hell, he'd even take a blast-ended skrewt at this point.  Anything to break the deafeningly awkward silence stretching between him and Potter.
"Nothing's wrong?  Why does something have to be wrong?  Does it seem like something's wrong?"  Draco winced at how high pitched and panicked his voice sounded, even to him.
“About a month ago?  Maybe a little more?  I’m not entirely sure.”  By now Harry was looking anywhere but Draco, clearly wanting this conversation to end so he could wallow alone.
"So...?"  Draco looked expectantly at Harry, brows raising ever so slightly at the ravenette, who seemed to be lost in thought as he continued to stare at the blonde in front of him, smile still plastered on his face.
"I'd heard about you becoming a Potions Master.  You'll make a good professor, much like your godfather."  Potters words were quiet yet firm, as if he was daring Draco to say otherwise.
“Of course, you pillock,” Draco said fondly, as he rolled his eyes.  “I mean, it’s not as you’re not absolutely gorgeous yourself.  Not to mention almost sickeningly kind and deceptively clever, well, most of the time.  Honestly, Potter, how could you ever doubt tha-oomph,” Draco’s sentence was cut off as Harry launched himself across the desk, spilling both their tea in the process, and pressing their lips together in a heated, yet reverent, kiss.
"Hello?  Earth to Malfoy.  Are you in there?"  Draco blinked back into reality to find they had stopped in front of his office door, and Harry was waving a hand inches away from his face.
"Give him a chance, Harry."  She'd told him, her face as stern as ever.  "He just might surprise you."  Of course she'd been right, he groused to himself, as he pretended not to stare at the blonde over the pages of the Daily Prophet.  It had been exactly one week since the start of term, and Dra-no, Malfoy had been nothing but cordial.  It was certainly a far cry from the cool indifference Harry had been expecting.  He gave his colleagues polite nods and courteous smiles and managed the children with warm efficiency.  If Harry was being honest, Malfoy rather reminded him of Minerva.
It was a day like any other at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, just as Harry Potter was hoping it would be a year like any other. Well maybe not quite like any other year, considering for the past seven, he'd been nearly killed countless times, actually killed once (although he's still wondering just how he got himself out of that sticky predicament), and hunted to exhaustion and all by one rather pissed off psychopath and his cronies. So no, maybe Harry Potter wasn't hoping for a year like any other. This year he was hoping for some peace and quiet. He was hoping to finish out his education and his Eighth Year with his friends, as they healed from the war and began to at least attempt at moving on.
"Yeah!  I'd love that."  Potter's face visibly brightened as his head bobbed up and down in an enthusiastic nod, causing Draco to smile just a little more.  He turned back towards the looming castle, determined to not look back at Potter's overly jubilant expression.  He set a brisk pace as he walked back up to the looming doors of Hogwarts, only pausing once he made it up the massive steps to let his companion catch up to him.
Draco smirked and huffed out a tiny laugh before deciding that maybe, just maybe, Golden Boy was right.  Perhaps it was time to set aside their petty grudge and let bygones be bygones.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
at his door before opening it.  He let Potter step inside before he followed, shutting the door with a soft
Harry had been in love with Draco since they were eleven.  It had started as a small crush when he met the boy for the first time at Madam Malkin's in Diagon Alley and had grown from there.  Draco had been in love with the idea of Harry Potter since he was much younger and had actually loved the boy since he had defeated the Mountain Troll that had been roaming the school in their first year.  They also didn't know that their secret feelings for each other were, in fact, not so secret at all.  For there were two very clever young witches who knew all about their love and had come to the conclusion that the two men were most definitely incapable of getting together themselves and decided to give them a little nudge in the right direction.
"Eloquent, as ever, Potter."  Draco drawled, quirking the corners of his lips up, ever so slightly.  Just enough to let Potter know that he was joking with him.  Potter's eyes snapped up to meet his, crinkling at the corners as he graced Draco with a blinding smile.  "Alright, look, maybe we could talk.  As in properly.  I have a kettle in my office, perhaps you'd fancy a cuppa?"
"Oh Harry, yes!  Fuck!  Harder, please."  Draco's words were high and breathy as he begged Harry to pound into him harder and faster, moaning loudly when he got his wish, every thrust hitting his prostrate perfectly. "Harry, I'm...nghn...fuck I'm close."
Harry's attention snapped to Draco's lips as they moved.  "Hmmm?"  Slowly, he dragged his eyes back up to meet Malfoy's grey ones.
"Now now Draco, no need for hostility." Draco froze as his name, his first name, left Harry's lips. Oh how he wanted to hear that again. He wanted nothing more than to grab this infuriatingly hot Boy Wonder in front of him, shove him against that damnable book case and kiss him until neither could breathe. "But alas, our little Golden Boy is straight. And even if he wasn't, there was no way he'd go for me," he thought, rather dejectedly, to himself.
Draco grimaced and nodded to himself, as he felt the heated flush of embarrassment creep its way up his neck.  "Right, well, I'll just...uhm...you know," he pointed back towards the castle with one thumb before quickly turning on his heel and striding back up to the school.   How could he be so stupid?  He'd let the general civility between him and Potter this past month and a half cloud his judgement.  He should never have said anything.  Or better yet, the moment he knew just who it was down by the lake, he should have turned tail and ran in the opposite direction.  Because all he had done with that pathetic little display down there, was make a complete and utter fool of himself.  Of course Potter didn't want to talk to him.  Of course he was suspicious.  Draco had been an absolute twat to the man when they were growing up, and he knew it.  Why he thought Potter would ever want to speak with him after everything he did, he didn't know.  Merlin, he was such a fucking idiot!
Potter chuckled quietly, crossing his arms and leaning against the stone wall of the corridor.  "Ah, Minnie didn't tell you, did she?"  He shook his head in amusement and looked Draco up and down before smirking ever so slightly.  "I'm the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.  Have been for two years now."
"Nothing's wrong. I just didn't want to finish like that. I want you. I want you inside me. Now."  With that, Harry stood and immediately removed the rest of his clothing, his thick cock standing proudly erect.  And holy Salazar, Potter was fucking huge.  Draco had no idea how that was going to fit in him, but fucking hell did he want to try.
"Do you always walk so fast?"  Potter huffed, shooting him an amused look from where he was walking, his shoulder lightly brushing against Draco's.
As Harry's mouth was devouring Draco's, he quickly began to work on undoing the buttons of Draco's shirt, brushing his fingertips over each newly revealed inch of creamy, pale white skin. Finally, he had Draco's shirt open and began to run his hands over the taller boy's shoulders and chest, stopping short when he ran into the scars that littered Draco's lithe torso. Slowly, he brought the kiss to a halt and leaned far enough back to look down at the scars, tracing a few of the particularly long ones.
"You said you wanted to talk about something.  What was it?"  Draco asked, trying to ignore the way Harry's gaze had slid back down to his lips.  Well, trying and failing that is.  Miserably.
"Well, Potter? Are you going to say anything, or are you just going to stand there and brood all damned day?" Not that Draco minded the brooding, Harry had the sexy brood down to an art, but it wasn't as if he'd ever let the Golden Boy himself know that.
"It has to be a joke. A prank. Who would write something like this to someone like me?" He muttered to himself, rather dejectedly, running a delicate hand through his white-blonde hair. Taking the letter out of his bag and unrolling it again, he sighed and sat down at the worn and scratched wooden desk in the centre of the room. The scrawling, messy handwriting seemed vaguely familiar, but he couldn't put his finger on it. "Of course it's a joke, Draco. Don't be stupid." He told himself irritably. There was no way it wasn't a joke.  He sighed and began to read the letter again, brows scrunching together, and lips pressed into a thin line.  When he reached the end of the page, he scowled even more.
He sat for a few moments in the quiet of the secluded room before a sharp knock on the door jolted him from his thoughts. He barely had time to sit up straight when the door squeaked open.  "I told you nothing was wrong, Pans. I have work to do, I'm sorry but I'd rather be left alone."  He bit out, trying hard not to get too annoyed with his best friend.
The early September air was crisp, with the lingering warmth of summer slowly giving way to the cool breezes of autumn.  Draco Malfoy could already tell that this year would be particularly chilly come winter.  But for now, he was perfectly content to stand outside, on the stone steps leading to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and enjoy the already setting Scottish sun.  As he stood there, on the second step, his trunk sitting one step below him, he took in a deep breath and tilted his head back to stare up at the looming castle.  He hadn't exactly been all that surprised when he had received a letter from Minerva McGonagall on the third day of the first week of July, asking if he would like to return to Hogwarts as the new Potions Professor.  He knew it would come one day, as Horace Slughorn was bound to retire soon, and Draco was the only other Potions Master in Great Britain.  However, he certainly hadn't expected the letter to come so soon, not when he had only become a Potions Master this past May.  Though, he supposed that he should be glad to have found a job so quickly, especially one that would take him considering his past allegiances.
Soon enough, he had the first finger in up to the last knuckle and was thrusting in and out slowly.  He began to pick up the pace when Draco moaned and started to push his hips back on to Harry's finger.  After a few minutes, the raven-haired boy withdrew his finger and added another, slowly thrusting in. Draco winced at the slight burn and Harry waited for him to relax again, rubbing the blonde's lower back and placing kisses between his shoulder blades, before thrusting in all the way. He began to scissor his fingers, stretching Malfoy. Again, he pulled out and added a third finger, letting Draco adjust before thrusting in and out, finding his prostate in the process.  Draco gasped loudly when Harry found the bundle of nerves and moaned when he hit it again. Harry started to scissor his fingers again, making sure to brush them up against Draco's prostate each time.
Kreecher hums in agreement, and there’s nothing else to do, so Harry makes small talk with the elf. He tells him about Draco, what happened to Theo, the weird relationship between Blaise and Theo, how Pansy is going to kill them all with her Summer Gala.
Draco pauses, hand halting right over the shower nozzle. “Yes. I had horrid ones in third year, Severus gave me some Calming Draught. But you’re not getting any until you’ve showered.”
Highly doubtful, coming from angry twins and an angry Ginny. Arthur bids them goodbye before they can do anything foolish, like rip Petunia’s teeth from her mouth. He does slip Harry a gift of a small toy lion before they leave, Ron’s very annoyed by it.
So far, Harry Potter is having a weird Christmas break. Ron and Hermione had drug him to see Hagrid on the second day, which had been a disaster that somehow resulted in them going to the library- a place he was hoping to avoid on break. It’s for a good cause though, and midway through his book a small white ball of fluff had hopped onto his lap and begun purring.
“Listen!” Dear fuck they really are going to end up alerting the entire school with Harry’s own big mouth. “I can talk to it, listen and maybe even talk it down. Worse comes to worse, Draco and I are the best at dueling and the least likely to die, plus I’ve already survived it once. How hard can a second time be?”
Draco curses, pointing his wand at the area in front of him, fully intending on destroying everything if the wards won’t work with him, but then a breeze from the sea pushes him and Misty back. Like the ocean is telling him off.  Like it’s saying that he
Howie hastily grabs his wand arm, all gentle and grandfather-like. “Now, Draco. Let’s think about this. You can’t just
Draco doesn’t respond and for a second Potter looks like his plan has backfired, so, a little more quietly, he adds, “I know about the abuse too.”
Ron, being the great friend that he is, just laughs and swings open the door, using his unfair height advantage against Harry and really! He’s seen a lot of fowl play this morning, but this is definitely at the top of the list! When did Ron even so tall?! He’s like a fucking
Sirius Black had been the one to lead Voldemort straight to their house, straight to the baby on the second floor. Sirius Black had been so close to getting rid of them, even killed his friend Peter Pettigrew, another one of Voldemort’s favorites. And if Black was back now, that could only mean one thing.
“Do you think I could give you a hand with killing him? I promise to behave in Potions if you do. Really, Professor, I think it could be a good bonding experience.”
“To begin our story, we must speak of the day my life and Severus’s collided. It was during the first war, on a battlefield in…”
“What?” He scoffs, after a much too telling pause he prays they don’t pick up on, “Where would you get an idea like that?”
Her hand is firm in his, grounding and kind. It’s ripped away from him before either of them can refuse to let go.
Draco tunes them out from there and does protest something fierce when a manicured hand removes his notes. “Hey! I wasn’t done with that!” He roars, turning around to glare.
The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher changed the room around from last year’s Golden Moron’s set. For the first time in at least a year the room looked like a classroom, dark wooden desks, a few odds and ends for decorations, no over the top dragon hanging from the ceiling, no weird golden bits throughout the walls, just a normal classroom. Draco felt like he would actually be learning for once, he was fairly excited about it.
He’d ended up with an entire new wardrobe, the finest of materials in each shirt and pants, new shoes polished to perfection, he smiles when they notice their matching necklaces hang from the other’s neck. She’s also snuck in some of his favorite treats from chocolate to lemon drops. Trinkets from a seeing glass to an ebony dagger that matched his comb. “Do you like them?”
Blaise doesn’t answer, but he does step closer and trail his fingertips over the lines on Draco’s chest. Those hands don’t stop even when Draco starts to shiver and get goosebumps, and then he’s in Blaise’s arms against a soft silk shirt that badly hides the muscles underneath.
The two Slytherin girls blink. Then they finally notice the others sitting around them, Blaise and Theo trying to out-bore each other, Draco and Fleur completely lost to the situation, and Luna, looking deeply into her raspberry cake like it holds the world’s secrets. Millie coughs.
Finally, someone who had his exact thought. This was almost better than his fantasy of Snape’s lecture.
“Afraid not, Potter-Poppet.” Remus smiles. “Why don’t you go wash up and Sirius and I will get everyone settled.”
It’s priceless, the way everything about Snap freezes and he can almost see the flaring up of nerves right above the other man’s eyeballs. He can pinpoint it by now with how many Potter-head-pains he’s had. Before his beloved godfather can run wild with his question, Draco provides a bit more context just so he can fully share his pain with someone.
Between that and the trust fund Draco’s been adding to since he was sixteen and realized he might have to flee his home, he should be covered for about a year.
“Well if they didn’t conjure the Mark then who did?!” Crouch asks in a shrill voice that kinda makes Draco want to rip out his vocal cords. The only reason he doesn’t is because Harry has started rubbing his thumb across the back of Draco’s hand and it’s caused him to finally stop shaking.
No, no he has not. Partly because he wanted to make sure it actually works, and also because he has tea scheduled with the man at two. It’s the first time they’re both had a free moment to enjoy, and Draco’s very excited to have time with his godfather, but fate has other plans because he walks in to find Ellios and William sitting on Snape’s love seat.
Fawkes and LuLu follow him as he paces in front of Dumbledore’s desk, Potter follows him with his eyes. He hates every second of it.
Not Snape or Dumbledore, they would’ve simply called out his name by now. Not Pansy or Blaise, they would’ve linked arms and laughed at scaring him. Not Crabbe and Goyle, they were too heavy footed for the pattern. It couldn’t be Lupin, the man had started lesson plans when Draco walked out. It wouldn’t be his father, Dumbledore would never let him walk alone in the hallways with him in the school. So who is it?
The Slytherin team look to each other with wide eyes, Draco thinks they look uncomfortably close to frogs at the moment.
“Luckily for us, the ministry hasn’t been able to  clean his office out, or do anything but keep him away from the school. After this I do hope they learned their lesson.”
“You see,” Lupin continues before Hermione can go completely purple in the face, “I was completely convinced this man in front of you was a killer and betrayed our friends, until one night Dumbledore took me aside and told me that some truths are harder to find than others-”
Draco gives him a look, one that Kingsley is familiar and fond of. One that means there might still be hope for one Draco Malfoy.
have gone to Madam Pomfrey for his head trauma, the scene before him couldn’t be happening. As soon as he thinks
Draco didn’t have the heart to tell him about his last school visit with dear old dad. He takes a deep breath, “Speaking of being safe. I’ve found out who has the diary.”
Harry holds up his pinky, Ron takes it, they bump thumbs and grin like they’re eleven and hiding from McGonagall during class again.
Luna finishes her button, there are only twenty more to go and it’s only nine. Sirius will be calling soon. “Do you want to know more about them, Harry?”
“Your eye bags are gone. Did you finally get some sleep? Pans and I have been going mental, I swear! You’re just as bad as Harry!”
Draco looks between the two of them, both hopeful and nervous at the same time. On the one hand, if he did tell them everything there would be hell to pay. Sure, he trusted them with his life and all, but he knows how Slytherins are. More than that, he knows purebloods. They would do anything for their own gain, including cross him. But….he also knows that family means everything to them, and he was considered family. Family broke rules for each other, family always comes first.
weird. Just last night he had asked the same question and Goyle had simply said it and they moved on. He was good at memorizing, which is why he was struggling so hard in Mcgonagall’s class. One can’t memorize pure skill. He marches in anyways, at least if he’s around other Slytherins he has protection.
sound like a good idea and Narcissa will be happy if it makes him harder to kill, so he doesn’t really have any objections.
“Safe.” Draco nods, placing a warm pale hand right over the ache in Harry’s chest. “It’s safe here, and because it’s safe you’re allowed to feel happy. You do know that, don’t you? If the son of a Death Eater is allowed to feel joy then so are you, Scarface.”
No one knows what to say to that until Ginny walks in, still drying her hair. “What happened? Did Harry confess his love for Malfoy or did Ron and Hermione just announce their relationship while I was out of the room?”
“Oh I believe you,” Theo smiles, “Draco’s always had a nasty habit of belittling the good things he does. All he ever wanted to talk about in school was what his
The headmaster lets out a long sigh, “No. But I’m afraid this is equally disturbing….we are being visited by Cornelius Fudge soon.”
He goes on to talk about work, how Sirius and Remus have nearly finished redecorating the Black Ancestral House, and it’s so...normal. What any regular father and son would talk about. Boring, sure, and lengthy as fuck, but it’s
“And let you commit a murder in front of four children? I think not.” Draco could hear the anger in his voice, he was in for it.
Is all he can think to say before he’s rising and meets her golden eyes. He panics for a second, wondering if he stood too quickly, but then Helga bows her head to him.
and when he saw him hurt….Harry shakes his head, telling them about the letters between him and Sirius this past summer and how the man has become a weirdly important part of his life and then Hermione makes a sound and waves her wand, a few letter of her own appearing in her hand.
Molly Wealsey starts to get a little too red in the face for comfort, even Mr. Wealsey takes a step back.
next chapter we get into Harry's heritage, the ball, and pretty soon the first semester at Hoggie Warts!
she’s sending a glare towards anyone who looks in their general direction. She leads them the little way they have left with her head held high, Harry imitating her so poorly it makes Draco’s heart swell.
The idiot rolls his eyes and before he can properly hex him, Draco is being shoved into the classroom on his left. And yes, he does throw a fit about it.
“Apparently,” Blaise laughs, “That old hag Trelawney predicted his death in front of the whole class! I wish I could’ve been there, his face would’ve had us laughing for hours!”
“Where are we going?!” Draco screams, casting a protection spell he’s fully aware no fourteen year old should know around them.
Draco’s blood goes a little cold at the mention of one edgy snake man, but then Lucius is breaking out in a full rant, something about stocks, something about ‘that blasted arrogant fool’, something about Fudge having less common sense than Dumbledore.
Dumbledore looks horrified, but not as freaked out as Draco feels, “No! Wait! I wasn’t supposed to tell you that! You can’t know-“
Harry plops down on the side of her big pillow, pulling Draco down with him. They end up lying side by side, Harry on his stomach so he can look Geia in her no-eyes, and Draco on his back staring at the ceiling.
“Ronald!” Granger warns right as Draco sees something snap in Pansy’s eyes. Her wand is out before any of them can react and poking right into a freckled throat.
“You can take the book with you.” Draco tells her. “Just give it back when you’re done and no one will mind.”
Mrs. Daisy’s friendly face falls into a stern frown. “You do too act that way! You’re far too young to forgo a night of getting smashed! Why, when I’m missing
Who is Black? Is he the one that brought Harry in? Once he finds out what he looks like that guy will dead as-
“Didn’t you promise Sirius not to do stupid shit like that?!” Draco yells, poking his chest unnecessarily hard.
“Of course I won’t!” Draco sighs, looking over the contract again and trying to see the positives here. Sure, he wants nothing to do with business because that’s what his father wanted him to do, but if he were to become a partner….well, it would mean being able to help Howie out if he got into financial trouble, all because it would be his responsibility to. That
“Hm? Oh yes! Draco actually gave me the idea. It’s high time the shop got a facelift! She’s been the same for twenty years now! I have a plan, of course, I’ve just got to wait until the August Rush is over so I can start gathering the funds!”
At first he’d been furious, because while he knew muggles weren’t all that bad, they were still kinda scary, and most muggle things have a wizard alternative, so he thought the whole thing was stupid.
As soon as Draco is released from his father’s study he makes his way to his room. It can’t be someone close to Potter, the idiot only has about two friends anyways, and it can’t be Draco because, well, that would just come off as a threat and make sure he
they may be. Lockheart has been through much, if you read his books you’ll clearly see where a cell or two has been knocked out, perhaps so hard it would be foolish to assume he has anything left.”
And okay, Draco knows he has a type by now. For Merlin’s sake, he figured that out when he was fourteen and watching Victor Krum climb out of a frozen lake in a conveniently tight suit. He’s never had an aversion to women, partly because his most looming goal for the longest time was either not dying or, when he turned sixteen, figuring out how the hell he was going to produce an heir with a girl who didn’t necessarily like him.
“You’re gonna have my head for this later,” Harry whispers, thrusting him onto someone else, “He needs help!”
Draco just stares at him, glare becoming harder and colder by the second. “No, thank you headmaster, I would
Not good. Dumbledore can’t just leave! He can’t protect Potter right now! Or can he? Either way, he can’t sleep anymore, he has to open his eyes, and at least try to get Potter out of here safely...he can handle the torture. Harry can’t.
A shiver of terror rips down Draco’s spine. Personally, he never wants to see Granger angry again. His cheek hurts just thinking about it. Fortunately, he has more important things to think about.
He knows that. He’s had presents ever since his first year at Hogwarts, but he’s not used to opening them like this. Typically, he, Ron, and Hermione will open them by the fire in the common room,not surrounded by smiling adults.
Once Herbology is over, it’s History of Magic. Given that his family library holds more information than Binns himself, Draco’s not particularly worried over it. Lunch is easier knowing Potions is next, and yes, Snape is still irritated about Draco’s sudden interest in his sex life. But, Potions is one of Draco’s favorite subjects. And he makes a point to be
“Boys,” Narcissa chides, looking between Blaise and Draco, “Be nice. Clearly something has happened, and I didn’t put him here for you to yell at him, I put him here to explain. Harry, if you please.”
“Will you please calm down and explain what you’re on about?” Lupin asks, but Snape shakes his head.
Her kind voice leaves no room for arguments. Pansy and Blaise shoot him sympathetic glances and try to protest against their mothers dragging them from the room. The door shuts behind them with a deafening click.
“I’m worried about the whole school, really, but my father knows about Granger….and he despises the Weasleys...really any of their little group could be a target. And we all know how Potter gets when his friends are in danger...”
“Merlin, no. James is your dad, we’re just becoming your legal guardians, and since you said yes and Sirius is now in tears, I’ll start the paperwork.”
He would ask her what the problem is, but he gets it. The idea of him and Ron being related isn’t that bad, Girl Weasley stood up for his father, so did the Twins, so they’re not awful. But he’s
The Basilisk he remembers was terrifying. Like he definitely almost shit his pants several times during their first meeting, but now the creature lies half in murky water, head barely hanging onto dingy marble floors. It looks pitiful and Harry knows, he
Thursdays are work from home days. He and Misty tend to the gardens, do laundry, all various house upkeep things. He’ll typically read a ‘How To’ book, mess around in the Lab, play on the computer for a bit until Misty calls him for their shows, which he still doesn’t like. She found the first one on a lazy afternoon, playing with the remote, idly petting Salem. Something called Mr. Bean, but it really feels like watching the same show over and over. He really doesn’t know what’s worse, that or the American sitcoms Misty keeps managing to find. First it was Full House, then The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, then Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which isn’t realistic
time as an eighteen year old. My girls and I had this ritual, you see. We’d get all dolled up, go out to the taverns, find some handsome young man, and then-”
Two months pass on the island, they’ve fallen into a routine of sorts. In the morning Pansy will wake them all up and demand they go down to the water, it usually takes at least ten minutes before Blasie and Draco cave, but they always do. LuLu stays behind, one afternoon in the water proving to be the one thing she hates more than being outside.
Draco nearly flinches at the question. A month ago he was asking the same thing, tucked away in his cell, surrounded by hoodies figures and manic laughter, begging anyone, even the devil himself for something to drink. His throat had been so dry, he’d never wanted anything like he wanted water in his cell. And here he is, denying the first glass that’s being offered to him.
Theo’s silent for a long time, but it’s okay. Draco just stands there and holds him, hoping it’s enough of an apology that his friend won’t hate him forever.
“Draco!”  She cries, opening her arms wide and suddenly he’s safe and warm and almost happy. They stay close for a few moments before his mother pulls away to cup his face. “Look at my boy, you’ve grown so much! I can’t believe I haven’t seen you in so long, I can’t believe I missed your birthday! We’ll simply have to celebrate it tomorrow..”
Draco nods, because the man is right. They do have a Potter-Protection team, even if some people have no idea it exists. People like all of the Weasleys, even though only Weasley Weasley knew. Granger and Lupin, Snape and Dumbledore, the entire Gryffindor team, if not the whole house. All those people and him, surely that would be able to keep Harry from coming face to face with Sirius Black.
Lucius glares at him and suddenly he can’t speak anymore, like his air pipes are clogging. His father has him in some type of hold by his wand, he can’t even blink.
They both gulp. Good. Maybe now they won’t go poking their heads where they don’t belong. Just for good measure, and partly because he was still trying to piss them off, he adds “I hope it’s Granger.”
Before Harry can say anything, Draco rips off his glasses, tosses them onto the bedside table, and grabs his jaw. “It’s not your fault.”
is the worst type of monster. He treats his allies like idle toys, and I’d sooner die than hand my child over to the fate most of my family suffered. They did not find glory with him, they found insanity and pain. Those who fought with him tell lies about who he was, about what he did. Do you know the fate of a Death Eater? It is to be tortured into complete submission and humiliated for the rest of your life. We were
they became life-threatening. I think if he wasn’t so busy giving me either a headache, heart-attack, or both we would probably get along. We’d have Quidditch to talk about. That’s enough to build a friendship right?”
“Wait, wait, wait, wait.” Harry protests, letting go of Draco’s hand to wave it in front of him. “There’s no way! Rallam can’t be over fifty years old-”
“I agree with Mr. Zabini. You are far too young to have these worries, but given our situation, it’s unavoidable.”
To his absolute horror, the dimwit doesn’t stop there, “You can rid ‘em now Harry!” And before the boy can protest, yes Draco does see the ‘no wait’ trying to slide off Potter’s mouth, Hagrid lifts him and places him onto Buckbeak’s back.
Sirius come in, but he does hear him set something down and walk until he’s peering over Remus’s shoulder.
“Exactly like that.”  Harry says to him, and then tells the door to open. Not even three seconds later and Harry is strolling in like he owns the place. All Draco can do is follow him in.
The night eventually comes to a close. Draco kisses his cousins on their foreheads, promising to see Fleur tomorrow, and then walks Luna back to the castle. He’s half tempted to get Winky to see if Harry is free, which reminds him that he really needs a way for them to communicate freely, which reminds him of his project. And because he has so much to do tomorrow and the rest of the week, Draco decides to go straight to bed.
The following days Draco finds every excuse he can to get into Snape’s office, the two of them pouring over books, learning ways to defeat such beasts, learning the quickest way to heal, how to protect yourself from something you couldn’t look in the eye. He disappears so much it’s no surprise Blaise and Pansy corner him the second he starts towards the common room door.
Narcissa quiets him with a look, which is nothing less than what he deserves. Once again, he’ll explain later he just wants to test his theory
Three deep breaths and a ‘good luck’ later, Draco nods to the elf. They each place a foot forward, alarms sound right as Dobby disappears and Draco prays he somehow gets away with all this.
Narcissa studies him for a moment, and then, as if she had never cared about him in the first place, she says “You will go down to the dungeons and lock yourself in chains within the third room.”
thank you for the comments! ily! and also i know I haven't finished this yet but I already have plans for the the next one lmao. Wish me luck!
Hermione fucking nods, taking a small necklace from her pocket that almost has Draco falling off the bed. “A time-turner?! Is
The man laughs at that, pulling out a chocolate frog from his pocket and holding it out to him, “My name is Professor Lupin, and as much as I admire your bravery, Mr. Malfoy, I’ll need you to stop by my office first thing after dinner, must make sure the attacked students are safe and all.”
He couldn’t find it in himself to resist even if he wanted to. Not when they both release sighs as they drag him to one of the couches and he doesn’t resist. Pansy stays with him while Blaise grabs his books, the boy returns the favor when she fetches her snacks, like he would disappear if they let him out of their sight. Before he can complain, the three of them are settled and words are coming to life out of the book on the coffee table. Comfortable, calming, safe. Between them, Draco could almost forget what he had done, what he was doing, what he would have to do. They were just three friends, enjoying a book by the fire, happy and young and with nothing bad that could reach them in their little bubble.
“It sounds like you already have your answer, why do you ask for my opinion? Should you desire to become Mr. Potter’s friend, it would be improper of me as Headmaster to stop you.”
he has a tattoo peeking out of his rolled up sleeves, not to mention the fucking earring?! They both turn towards him with big smiles, “Oi! You must be Harry, it’s great to meet you!”
Theo laughs, thankfully not making a fuss at having to take a bath. Draco himself slaunters off to the kitchen for a snack. He’s planning on getting something for him and Theo to share, afterall, a quick book showing might be good for them.
“Make yourself scarce,” Vernon glares as Harry hands him his briefcase, “my wife deserves better than a stain in her house.”
Harry Potter looked like he was either going to burst into tears or murder everyone within five feet of him. Draco wondered for a moment what the hell could’ve happened, but it didn’t really take a long time for him to figure it out.
The annoying voice of a first-year, no doubt about that, sneaks him back to the present where Scar Face seems trapped, his friends holding back laughter. What a nuisance...then the reality of what’s being said slaps away fear with his most familiar emotion around Potter: breathtaking agitation.
The two of them turn back towards the window at the exact time a car flies by. Heads whip back and forth, they blink at each other and then Pansy speaks and suddenly his headache is back full force.
Harry ran his hand through his hair. He forgot people would've seen that. Clearly, his plan wasn't necessary at all because everyone already knew.
"When Malfoy finally succeeded, he was forced to let Death Eaters into the castle. Then, he went up to the Astronomy tower, only to find Dumbledore in a very weak state, but still strong enough to cast just one spell. And instead of stopping Malfoy, Dumbledore chose to cast a Petrificus Totalus on the only other person there. Me."
Harry ignored the voice telling him that whatever could harm Draco would have no qualms about doing Narcissa in either.
"What do you mean, Pans?" He demanded. She smirked. "Potter and the female Weasley aren't together. I was talking with Loony Lovegood yesterday, and apparently, she and the female Weasley are dating." Draco stared at Pansy.
Ron groaned and voiced Harry's thoughts for him. He made a mental note to thank him when he regained enough energy to speak.
Pansy and Blaise rushed over to him. "A dragon, Draco!" Pansy gushed. "That's amazing! It's incredibly rare to have magical creatures as your animagus, though I suppose we should have known, what with your name and all." Draco noticed out of the corner of his eye Potter edging away to go talk to his friends. Draco distractedly praised his friends' animagi forms, too, before turning to see Potter excitedly describing to Granger what it felt like to turn into an animal. Granger had a jealous look on her face.
He was rock hard, and the water hadn't helped to calm his raging erection. Harry rubbed the soap between his hands, making sure to get them as lathered up as possible. Then, he set the bar down and finally took himself into his hand. He groaned at the sudden stimulation. After a moment, he began to slide his hand up and down, his other forearm resting on the wall to support himself. His movements got faster and faster, and he felt pressure start to build up inside him. Harry closed his eyes and was accosted by a series of images. Malfoy laughing and smiling, Malfoy underneath him, Malfoy touching his cheek, looking just like he had in Harry's dream before-
Draco was planning on staying silent out of spite, but that was not conducive to finding out what the hell was going on. "What do you want with me?" he demanded.
"Would you like some help?" He asked the boy. Harry nodded in relief. Draco looked at the bed skeptically. "We should probably go down to the library. I don't think both of us will fit on your bed, not with all our homework too."
Just as he was about to snatch it out of the air, the Snitch abruptly shot upwards, but Harry was going too fast to stop. He careened onwards and heard Draco shout his name. He panicked and tried to slow his broom, but he inevitably crashed into the thick layer of trees. Draco swooped under him, trying to catch him, but his momentum carried them both off of the broom and tumbling to the ground. He clutched Draco to him in terror, yelling as they both fell.
Draco spent class staring blankly out the window, the grey sky dulling his mood and making him feel drained. Flitwick's squeaky voice washed over him, but the information did not make its way into his brain. No matter, he could easily ask for Pansy's notes or conduct his own research into the subject. Draco had always found lectures unendurable - why would teachers waste time droning on about a topic when experience was the best teacher? In any case, he spent the morning scanning the treetops of the Forbidden Forest with a leisurely gaze, sometimes spotting a flash of movement or a winged creature flying above the trees. At some point, he realized that the leaves - still a vibrant green, as they somehow were all year round - were the exact shade of Harry's eyes. And that just reminded him of the dazed, yet hungry look in the boy's eyes as he had leaned in to kiss him, caressing Draco's lips with his-
"Yes, yes, I know. I'm a disappointment, no need to rub it in," he slurred at it. It contemplated him for a moment, then hopped closer. Draco smiled a drunken grin that crookedly stretched across his face. He lifted a finger to stroke it, and to his surprise, the bird allowed it. It closed its striking amber eyes, cutting off the dull glow. Draco smoothed the feathers down for a few moments, before beginning to voice his thoughts. It was nice to have something to talk to, even if it was only a songbird.
Another ten minutes later, he spotted a house in the distance. It was the only thing around for kilometers, so he made a sharp turn and landed, still quite far away, so that the inhabitants would not see him. Harry took a deep breath. He would not turn this into Sirius and the Department of Mysteries. He sighed and used a spell to ascertain his coordinates, then conjured his stag Patronus, sending it to McGonagall with his location and a brief request for backup. Finally, Harry started walking towards the house, resigning himself to waiting until more people showed up.
Draco kicked a pebble, glowering at all the people whispering and staring at him. He was in muggle London, for Merlin's sake, there shouldn't be so many people looking at him. Yes, he was beautiful and rich and famous - now infamous - but that was in the Wizarding World. The muggles' attention was entirely unwarranted.
Potter continued. "She was willing to live with and be punished by a monster, just so her son would be safe. She was never a true follower of Voldemort. She was never asked to perform any tasks on his behalf and was never given any mission other than to act as a gracious hostess, which she performed only as much as required." Potter took a deep breath and continued, "and Mrs. Malfoy saved my life."
Harry grabbed Draco's hand and squeezed it, swooping in to plant a kiss on his cheek. "Good morning, love," he said softly, not wanting to break him out his reverie.
Parkinson scowled in annoyance, but Harry only had eyes for Draco. He watched as the boy straightened slightly, his eyes flashing with only the barest hints of the emotions he felt. Embarrassment was the most dominant, but there were underlying flickers of anger and fear. Eventually, though, happiness bled through and shone out with a fierceness that took his breath away, manifesting on the blond's face as a slow, hesitant smile that Harry gladly returned.
"I am not infatuated with Potter!" He said a little too loudly. Some of the Slytherins down the table stared at him, then began whispering furiously to each other. Draco groaned. Everyone else smirked. Almost on instinct, Draco looked over to the Gryffindor table, almost instantly locking eyes with a certain black-haired boy. Potter just blushed and looked away again, which was enough to make Draco regain his smirk.
When all his tears had dried up, Harry finally straightened. He gave Draco a small smile, and Draco carefully extricated himself from the black-haired boy. The food was completely cold, but Draco made Harry eat it anyways after casting a quick warming charm. Draco fussed over Harry, making him lie down as soon as he was finished eating. Harry snuggled under the blankets, and Draco gave him a sad smile. He began to turn away to leave because he didn't want to skip any more class, but Harry caught his arm. "Stay?" He asked, and Draco couldn't possibly refuse. So he stayed, lying down beside Harry, back to back, until they both fell asleep.
They landed with a thud, Harry beneath Draco. Luckily, it seemed like he hadn't broken anything, and Draco's fall was cushioned by him, so he was probably fine too. With a groan of pain, Draco lifted his head to glare at Harry.
"Again?" Harry asked in disbelief. "How do you always come in at the moment I start changing? Every time I get ready in the room instead of the bathroom, you manage to show up. It's uncanny!"
Harry kissed him, surreptitiously licking off the bit of jam and simultaneously shutting him up. He pulled away quickly, a self-satisfied grin on his face.
"So you kidnapped me," Draco blurted out. Alina immediately scowled. "I didn't kidnap you. I saved you! You're terribly ungrateful, you know."
After what seemed like at least an hour of wandering the enormous estate, they finally reached a set of gilded double doors. Walters stopped and gestured for him to continue alone. "His Majesty will be waiting for you inside. If I may offer a bit of advice," Walters leaned in close, "try not to anger him as usual. He's been in a right mood since you left."
Now he couldn't concentrate. His brain kept wandering off to things he didn't want to be thinking about. His eyes slid over to stare at the blonde head a couple of rows in front of him. He idly wondered if Malfoy had ever dated anyone before. Bad brain. He dragged his mind back to the very boring History of Magic lesson he was supposed to be paying attention to. Like he cared about the names of each and every Vampire coven in the 1500s. Only Hermione was paying any attention at all to Binns, scribbling away furiously on a sheet of parchment.
"Harry," he corrected him. "And I figured I should apologize. I didn't mean to avoid you, well I did, but-"
"Calm down, Pans. I'm fine. And I have no idea who they are anyways, just some random 7th years." He assured the infuriated girl. She was nearly shaking with rage.
Harry narrowed his eyes. "I'm not scared." He stated firmly. Draco began to shake his head. "No, I didn't mean to imply you were, I just-"
It wasn't all that dramatic. No one really looked at them - they were all used to people coming in and going out to spare a glance their way. Some students were already facing the doors, and those kids nudged their friends. People looked at them and just as quickly turned away, not terribly interested in their public display.
He lay in bed, listening intently for his dorm mates' breathing. Hearing nothing out of the ordinary, he got up quietly and slipped out of the room, making sure to leave his curtains closed. He cautiously made his way through the common room and out into the dungeons. Once out, he hurried through the drafty corridors, up the stairs, and quickly slipped out of the doors of the castle. Strictly speaking, he was within his rights to wander about, even this late, but it would not be good for him and his secret endeavors if anyone found him. They would be quick to accuse him of hatching a plot to let the remaining Death Eaters into the school. Again.
Harry hesitated. "Kingsley," he began again. "I need to see Narcissa and Draco Malfoy. I wish to be a witness for their defense at their trials." Kingsley looked shocked. "I must admit, that was not the answer I expected from you. But, I also admit I should have known. You are far more grown up than any of us have given you credit for. I apologize. I know you better than to think this would be about some petty rivalry. However, I cannot allow you to enter the courtroom."
Seamus sat next to Zabini, Dean went for the spot next to him, and Ginny sat across from him next to Ron. Only seconds later, Luna wandered over to perch next to her girlfriend.
"Potter!" A voice shouted loudly in his ear. Harry winced. He managed to extricate himself from a very clingy Malfoy, who was prattling on about random things. When he finally managed to get Malfoy to let go, he heard him say,
Harry was no longer uncertain. He fancied boys. There was no denying it, not when he had tangible proof right in front of him. Not to mention just how tight his pants were feeling right at that moment. He buried his face in his hands, groaning. He decided the best course of action would be to shower and take care of his...issue. Hopefully, Malfoy would be fast asleep when he came out, otherwise, he didn't know what he would do.
Draco gently angled his body downwards, slowly approaching the ground. As he neared it, he panicked a little bit and alighted awkwardly, folding his wings slightly too late for any semblance of gracefulness. Regardless, he could rest and take an hour to recover. Still, the problem of navigating his way back to Hogwarts remained, and he had no idea what he could do. Eventually, after he sat and contemplated his options for a while, he discerned that Apparating to Hogsmeade would be the fastest route, and Draco was glad he thought of it.
Draco shot up. "Half an hour!" He shouted. "Why didn't you wake me up earlier?" He asked, frantically throwing on his robes. He hesitated in front of the mirror but quickly calculated that he wouldn't be able to have breakfast if he messed with his hair. And he really needed some good old bacon right then.
"I wanted to ask you, well- I wanted to ask...er," Harry stammered, unsure how to word his question.
Draco smiled reassuringly. "No, of course not. But..." he hesitated, "I don't think we should go any further."
"Fine," she said stiffly. "But don't come running to me when you haven't started the essay by Sunday." Ron just sank further down into the couch.
It was a long letter, perhaps even longer than the one he had initially sent to her. Maybe that was a good thing - if Narcissa liked him, that would be one stressful step in his and Draco's relationship out of the way. Harry still wanted to go to the Manor for a couple of days over the hols like they had planned because he quite wanted to say hello properly and see Draco's childhood home without the imminent threat of death looming over his head. He was looking forward to the possibility of embarrassing stories and baby pictures, which was another reason to stay on Narcissa's good side.
"What is it, Draco? Is something wrong? Is this...is this about last night?" Harry looked worried, biting his lip endearingly. Draco took a breath and opened his mouth again, but Harry interrupted him once more. "Please don't tell me you regret it. I knew this wouldn't end well." He said despairingly, tugging his fingers through his tousled hair and beginning to pace. Draco watched with his mouth slightly agape.
Draco shook his head, an expression of exasperation on his face. "That's not even what I wanted to talk to you about," he protested. "I wanted to give you this." He pulled away from Harry, reaching for his bag and fishing around inside it. He emerged a few seconds later, triumphantly holding an opened envelope. Draco pulled out two pieces of parchment from inside, checking one briefly before handing the other to Harry. "It's from my mother," he clarified, catching Harry's questioning glance. Harry immediately opened the parchment, curiosity burning inside him. Why would Mrs. Malfoy write to him?
He lay down on his back, squirming to get comfortable. Casting one more glance at his curtains, he hesitated, then slowly reached down and pushed his pajamas off.
He wondered if Harry was intent on driving him mad. Now that he knew Draco was attracted to him, would he turn around and take advantage of it to torment him? Only a year ago, Draco would not have been surprised if he did. But things were different now. They were friends. Weren't they? Perhaps this was all a ruse designed by Harry and the Weasel to humiliate him. Actually, that made perfect sense. Draco tried to push his bleak thoughts to the back of his mind, but he could still feel them lurking.
Harry shivered, the frigid air blasting his face as they exited the tavern. He eyed Draco, who had his hands shoved deep into his pockets, and lamented the lack of pockets in his outer robes. He absolutely had to get new ones. For now, though, he settled for slipping his right hand into Draco's left pocket and letting the other one succumb to frostbite. No one needed two hands anyway.
Sirius snorts at them, but his thanks is so sincere it almost makes Draco uncomfortable. “I assume he’s expected to join your little training camp?”
Mister Draco’s friend be saying Mister Draco is only seventeen, that he’s been through too many icky things, that he is having no friends and that he is scared to be going back. Mister Draco lets Misty drink from his cup, Mister Draco sits with Misty and lets Misty talk, even though Misty talks too much and it annoys Salem. Mister Draco is
“I don’t have long and I cannot explain fully, but you all must be careful. Blaise, your mother is working with me to protect the pureblood children. We’ve gone over several ideas. We’re trying to warn others we know want no part of the war, those who want to fight for the side of the light. It is not as black and white as history would have you believe. For now, when you go to school this year, distance yourself from those who speak highly of the Dark Lord. You must be safe, you cannot be accused, and you must be smart about every move you make.”
“There’s time right now. Come down to the party with me, we can eat jellybeans and hang out with Ginny and the twins, Ron’ll be talking to Seamus about the game for at least an hour, that’s more than enough time for a break.”
Misty tugs on his hand. “The ocean is telling Mister Draco to stop, so Mister Draco should be stopping.”
“Like, I mean complete warrior. It was kinda scary, but I have to be honest I have never respected you more than I do right now. And, you know what? If you had killed someone, it would’ve been completely understandable!”
Hagrid’s hut still disgusts him, and Merlin does he hate the walk down, but his father hadn’t told him the final remark, and he had to be sure before throwing himself into finding a course of action. Two knocks later and he regrets coming more than he regrets being born into a shit-show of a family.
“Alright, fine. I’ll calm down with the hexing, but if you think this means I’m going to start being nice….”
a reliable source of information. He thinks it’s total bullshit, but Misty gets a kick out of telling Theo every little development in his life, so he zones out, wondering if he should owl his friends.
So that’s why Potter has been so insistent about coming back, bloody git has someone special. Bloody annoying. “Potter you’ve got yourself a
Dumbledore keeps him in the hospital wing for three whole days before he breaks, apparently social contact really is all that important after his hellish summer. He practically begs to see the headmaster early Thursday morning, and with all the whining he’d been doing, Madam Pomfrey is more than happy to take him there.
Thank Merlin they put the Latin clause in there, it would be useful if their mothers weren’t fluent in ten languages.
He can see the gears in Hermione’s head turning, and pretty soon she’s leading him back down the stairs and to the fireplace where she can ignore Ron and still watch Fred and George’s drunk reenactment of a speech Flinch had given them the first time he caught them sneaking out.
So, after a moment, Kingsley pats his arm and stands. “I’ll be back on Sunday to see the results, if you haven’t moved from that spot I’m forcing you back to the Manor.”
Weasley gasps behind him, and then he says probably the strangest thing a person can say when four friends are mourning the loss of something pure.
Misty’s eyes grow wider, Draco worries they might pop out of her head. “Mister Draco be making Misty food?”
“He accelerated the curse on your father, he’s gathering forces, you and all your friends and peers and not
WARNING: in this chapter there's a downward spiral to an anxiety attack, dissociation, and mentions of self harm and abuse! Please do not read if it will badly impact your mental stability!
“Misty is probably dying to get rid of you for a night or two.” Theo tells him. “She told me that you interrupt her bath schedule.”
“Draco,” They begin, “You have been a good friend to me so far. For that I am indebted. You not only kept my relationship with Severus a secret, but my relationship to my son quiet as well.”
And he does. Draco goes all the way back to when he first got himself into this mess. Something about Quirrell had rubbed him the wrong way, so he went and complained to Dumbledore who had cryptically told him to be careful. And because he, the big bad eleven-year-old, thought himself capable, he had taken matters into his own hands and started following around weird people. Like Quirrell, and Harry Potter, which is how he ended up saving Harry from the beasts in the woods that was very weird because the very same beast he saved Potter from was the one that Quirrell met with a lot and when Draco saw the man
And isn’t that the million dollar question? Draco doesn’t really know himself, but he did promise to answer any question Harry asked, and maybe if he just opened his mouth he could get
“Well,” Pansy explains, “It started last year...Flint told us how you looked scared of your father when he came to see your first match.”
He finds four bodies all piled together, Ginny and Ron in the middle of the bed, as though the group fell asleep talking. Because they’re
Draco keeps a very close eye on Lupin the next few days, and dear Merlin is he starting to look bad.
They work for a few more hours, interrupted by customers, but not many. Weird, considering that they’re in the middle of the notorious August School Rush.
Now he sat on the other end of the long dinner table, eating in deafening wordlessness, chewing the only sound despite there being two people in the room.
Draco doesn’t even blink, instead he grabs the professor by his arm, “Professor! What perfect timing, tell me, what’s your opinion on the spotting of floating heads?”
“Listen to me, both of you. This is very weird. Kneazles are known for their magical abilities. They protect their owners, are extremely loyal, and, this is the weird part you
“Mum!” Draco sighs, arm around Hermione’s shoulder. “You make it sound like a publicity stunt. And it is, of course, but it’s more of a declaration of war.”
Draco takes a seat, “The monster, sir. It’s a basilisk, Potter can hear it because it’s a snake. Yes, I know they’re rather large- Granger suspects the pipes are how it’s been getting around, and you have to admit it makes an unsettling amount of sense. How else would it be controlled by Salazar? And the students have been petrified, but not killed, isn't that rare for any other creature? Think about how none of them looked the beast in the eyes. Through reflections on water, a camera, glasses, Granger's mirror....that's why no one has died yet.”
“But we could still ask her. We don’t have a lot to go off of here! Anything that could work we need to use!”
The two share grins before Draco tosses his friend some pumpkin juice, “What better way to do that than sheer terror?”
The small one, he looks a little like Percy if Harry’s being honest, is laughing with his brother, hair a little longer than Fred’s, he must be Charlie. Bill, the tall one, nearly stops Harry in his tracks. Being tall is just the tip of the iceberg, his hair is back in a long ponytail- fuck who knew red hair could look
“First thing’s first, you are safer here than you are at Hogwarts, got it? If someone so much as looks at you funny in this house they’ll be kicked out immediately. We love you and will give Narcissa a run for her money with our protectiveness. That means you’re free, okay? You can say what you want, do what you want, wear what you want. Okay?”
Where he knows people love him. Where he can have friends and mentors and not be left like some abused house elf on standby for your bloody war! And you can’t say a Godric-forsaken thing about it!”
of things last year,I know you’re close with Dumbledore, and I know that despite you being a giant asshole, you tried to save my life multiple times last year.”
Hermione breaths in like it’s nothing, so Harry tries it and it comes out like a stuttering mess. Still, she tells him to try again and the trails on his back don’t stop for a second. They work together until he can breath without smelling smoke and only then does he notice the oddities of the night.
.” Sirius adds. The lights start dancing again, Harry’s half tempted to take a step back. “I won’t let him do it again.”
A flower shop that’s completely intact, Draco can see a worker in an apron watering a baby wiggentree. Next to it is a bakery, and next to that a small green wand shop. Draco takes in the sights, the happy blue apothecary, the yellow tea shop, the people in the street chatting happily, not giving a damn about him.
….He knew there was something Dumbledore and Snape had been keeping from him. On the plus side, surely he wasn’t close.
They end up meeting during their free nights more often than not, although at some point, after they decide no one is going to kill anyone, Pansy, Blaise, and Weasley stop showing up for every brain storming session.
Apparently, with the help of one Hermione Granger, they’ve been making waves in their respective fields. Pansy provides all the clothing for Astoria’s orphanage, has charity balls to get donations for various war retributions. Blaise is working with both Neville Longbottom, Granger,
It hardly takes any time to reach the greenhouses once he drowns out the blithering idiots beside him. It does, however, take an immense amount of effort not to scoff in Lockheart’s face as he flaunts about in front of Scar Face.
Pansy snorts, “It’s as huge as ever. He’s related to almost everyone. The Blacks, obviously, through his mother. The Lovegoods, I think they’re twice removed cousins?”
The sooner he’s home, the sooner he can check on Lucius’s arm that may or may not have been used to revive the Dark Lord, but hey, having his father not beat him is an expensive price to pay.
Draco shrugs. He could work with that. Some of them were vague enough, if he was lucky he could get out of here without revealing more than he had to.
You have to be at the Astronomy Tower as soon as possible, I’ll find a way to take care of things here.”
Draco raises an eyebrow at her, pleased when she understands that he’s asking a question and not being mean.
some rest after all this. Making his way down the steps and taking a few twists and turns, he starts to get a particularly annoying feeling that he won’t be getting to bed so easily.
“Thank you, Granger.” He tries desperately to ignore the smile on Harry’s face. “Could we get back to the task at hand now? There’s only a month and a half left, you know.”
Scabbers, apparently, is a Weasley’s pet rat, who has decided now would be a great time to try and escape from the red-headed horrors he’s been subjected to for however long rats live. Draco thinks nothing of it, it’s a
Call him obsessive, but the boy is looking like he can barely stand on his own two feet. Draco watches, partly amused, and partly concerned as Harry Potter shakily takes his first few steps off the train. Maybe he’s just plain stupid. There’s no other explanation for why he leans in close behind Potter, noting briefly that he smells of brooms and a winter’s rain, and whispers in his ear.
He laughs while Snape forces him out of Dumbledore’s office, he snickers through the hallways back to the Slytherin common room, and giggles as he settles between his two friends, snatching the note he’d left and promptly falling asleep.
Draco sticks his tongue out at her, which he regrets the second Blaise plops a grass flavored jelly bean on it.
“Ebony wounds that don’t heal and Dementors that don’t make you faint? What exactly have you been up to this summer?”
“Occlumency is the art of closing your mind, think of it like a shield but for your thoughts, actions, and feelings. It’s a wonder no one thought to teach you this before, the Dark Lord is one of the most skilled Legilimens in the world.”
The man doesn’t stop moving until he’s in front of Lucius and pointing his wand and the paralyzed body.
It’s out of his mouth before he can take it back, his father’s favorite insult, it horrifies him the second it leaves his tongue. He feels too much like his father when he says it, so much it actually frightens him, and then Flint is in front of him and someone is firing a spell.
Potter had just found out that Sirius Black had once been his father’s best friend. Draco’s suddenly glad to be going home for break.
The manor seems smaller now, not looming over him like the past few years. He doesn't feel the slightest bit of anxiety looking at the steps, walking into the door feels more like coming home than it ever has.
Draco takes a long hard look at his face; the bags, the sad eyes, the hopeful smile. And then he leans a little closer and tells Harry about his mother. He talks about how when he was little she tried to teach him to bake cakes and the house elves went mental over it. He tells Harry about their favorite parts of the garden, how she’d been there for every broom ride. His father comes up, naturally, but it’s his real father. The one that taught him to swim and warm hot cocoa so they didn’t have to move from watching the snow fall. The same man who spelled bubbles to tickle and kiss him when he scraped his knee. Lucius Malfoy, the man who once danced with his mother while he played the piano and the house elves hung flowers in the ballroom.
there! Surely not, he isn’t that stupid, oh what am I on about? Yes he is, he went after a bloody giant snake last year like he was just taking a stroll on a Monday afternoon-”
Oh but Draco knew Snape was. Maybe not in front of the students, but personally, he wouldn’t mind things getting a little violent. They count to three, wands at the ready, and then Snape cries ‘Expelliarmus!’ and Lockheart is thrown a good yard back, landing flat on his ass. Draco cheers, unsurprised that most of the other Slytherins are doing the same.
Dumbledore eases his way into the room, walking casually like he isn’t wearing the very face that got Draco to cave in and tell him everything last year. Knowing there’s no way he’ll win a battle of wills with Albus Dumbledore, Draco rises to a sitting position.
“I heard he was an amazing Seeker. I meant to see him play, but every time I tried Dementors showed up.”
Beside him, Draco’s dead asleep, curled up on his side. His hair fans out in the most beautiful way, his head is practically on Harry’s arm, and since Draco’s probably not waking up any time soon, he won’t be going anywhere for a long time. So he gets comfortable, takes a second to brush a stray strand of hair behind Draco’s ear, and turns back to his new friend.
“So we’re dealing with a giant deadly snake, your father, the grounds-keeper who would know more about this than either of us in Azkaban, Dumbledore missing, and Potter’s inability to stay out of trouble.”
Well, if he didn’t think Sirius was a homicidal maniac before, he certainly looks the part now, struggling against Lupin’s hold with more murderous intent than a Basilisk.
What their little argument results in is Draco magically forced to stand still while Theo covers his scars and his Dark Mark in magical makeup that managed to wipe the entire slate clean. Or that’s his understanding until Theo leaves the scar on his face alone.
Then he sits up straight, dragging Harry with him and nearly screams when Geia’s head pops up from the water.
“I was worried about my friends...if something snuck in and tried to get them, they would be defenseless in their sleep. At least if I was up I could try to stop it.”
“You weren’t kidding when you said you have a date?” Ron stutters. He looks oddly put out, which is interesting considering he seriously doesn’t have a date. Which isn’t a big deal to Draco, but is a big deal to Pansy.
“Yes,” Narcissa raises an eyebrow, no doubt where Draco got that annoying trait, “But I’m curious as to how a child knows about it?”
say more. Like “be safe or else” at the bare minimum. They're definitely pissed, but Harry has at least eight hours before he has to worry about that.
Pansy rolls her eyes, looking longingly at Millie’s book like she might snatch it away just so she doesn’t have to participate in the same conversation they’ve been having for the past hour. It would work as annoying if she wasn’t muttering ballgown ideas to herself in the hallway.
Potter collects his friends as the red and gold retreat. Once they’re gone, Flint turns to grab him by the shoulders.
Blaise, bless him, pats his back until his air pipes are no longer blocked by steamed broccoli, and even makes an effort to remain close when he opens the letter.
Misty’s eyes widen at the sight of the Mark. She blinks once, then twice, as though she’s preparing herself for something. Then, to his absolute shock, Misty takes a step forward.
“You’ve kept him alive this long, I’m sure you’ll manage. I’m concerned for both of you really, you know both of your parents did everything they could to make your lives better than theirs….”
“Albus,” the potion-master says calmly, “We both know the old spell doesn’t hold the boy now. Riddle has his blood, he can be touched, a little house filled with assholes isn’t going to do anything but hurt the boy.”
Pansy pouts, but they climb out and listen to her rave about the Gala on the way back to the Manor. Belle and Katherine both hug him goodbye,  Pansy and Blaise promise to see everyone tomorrow for their sessions, and then Draco’s left with a tired Theo, who needs a bath and to sleep.
hi everyone, I know it's been a while since the last chapter. my best friend has been making an effort to spend every off day with me since my dog died and while I adore them for trying to make me feel better it's really cut down on my writing time. Anyways, I sound be back on our normal schedule soon and I'm so very excited for the next chapter. have a wonderful day and thank you again for all the support
Granted, she fucking should be because he’s spent the better part of the last month and a half working on this stupid little thing.
Draco’s stumbles away, breathing heavily, LuLu rubs against his leg to comfort him, growling at the figure as it’s forced out of the carriage. A gruff man stands in the aftermath, brown hair disheveled and face in a deep frown.
If anything, Draco secretly likes muggle shopping more. For one thing, it’s a little cheaper than what he would get in wizarding stores, since it’s all standard with no ridiculously expensive charms on it from some old coot who
Draco has walked in on a lot of strange things, but seeing his mother up at three in the morning, waiting in the kitchens like she knew he’d be down here is fucking up there on the list.
“I know…”he admits, “I have trouble keeping up with everything and I was thinking too fast. If the heir of Slytherin had any enemies, anything that isn’t of pure magical descent is in danger….and my father means to hurt Potter. I just can’t tell if it’s directly or…”
happen was effecting Harry. Eye bags no child should have, the constant lost look, not to mention the physical damage from first year alone. “Do you even care about him? You’ve seen the stuff he’s gone through in the past three years, you know this is nothing compared to what’s coming but you can’t even manage a ‘hi, Harry, thought you’d like to know that your parents were loved and not brutally betrayed!’ Hasn’t he been through enough
Dumbledore leaves them, Hermione makes to talk but Draco shakes his head. Five minutes later he nods. “What the hell was that piece of shit code.”
clear. “You’re not a murderer, Harry. You’re smart and you know death would be an easy way out for this coward. A lifetime in Azkaban and a mouth to declare your godfather’s innocence is much more valuable than a dead body.”
Theo looks between the two of them like Draco might make a scene, but he just smiles. “You’ve got him there.”
“Thrice removed, then. I know you’ve always been friendly with Luna,” She settles in next to Blaise, pulling Draco and Millie down with her, “The Rosier Family, though they stopped being big after the whole mess with Grindelwald-”
Draco looks back at him, and the right at Potter, apparently caught in the middle of making a very difficult decision. He can barely hear him over the commotion around them, but by Merlin can he read lips.
have….three adult wizards dead, two of them extremely powerful and known for their fights against Voldemort….you know how the
Hagrid disappears to grab something he doesn’t pay attention to, so it’s no surprise that Blaise glares back at the insulter as soon as he’s gone.
Dumbledore is hugging him, and oddly enough, shaking while he does. Even weirder is that Harry Potter, The Boy Who’s Parents Got Brutally Murdered In Front of Him, is crying like he’d just seen the worst thing in his life.
They’re on the way to the Gang’s Room for their weekly meeting when he spots Fleur coming towards him with red-rimmed eyes.
So, instead of calling Draco over, Remus sat him on the kitchen counter and had an elf bring him supplies.
“Don’t be like that! You’ll ruin your breakfast if you’re in a bad mood.” Harry grins, stepping closer to the door. “Bye, Draco!”
to! How could he be in two places at once? That’s not possible. Even with magic there has to be some time turner involved and Hermione’s isn’t stupid enough to-
“Not long. I found you shortly after Mr. Malfoy left. I do have to ask, how long has he been abusing you?”
Draco actually laughs at that, “Harry will defeat the Dark Lord. It will be dangerous, sure, but he won’t die. I won’t let him die, not until he suffers the consequences for my headaches over the years. And since I have to be there until the very end, I can’t die either. You two have nothing to worry about from that aspect.”
“Come along, Harry.” Remus says, offering an arm, and Harry’s not sure what he’s supposed to do, but he takes it and the world starts to spin.
When he gets back, Misty is still sat in the living room, so Draco goes straight to the kitchen and takes out his wand, trying desperately to remember those spells he made the houseleves teach him when he was sixteen and trying to figure out how hard running from the Dark Lord would be.
The twins left next, even though it didn’t seem like they wanted to. Something about a summer job, from Ginny’s reaction Molly isn’t happy with her sons working, but they left to go do whatever working people do anyways. Fleur and Luna followed them shortly, something about cleaning up the Lovegood Garden that Neville got dragged into.
hi! Sorry for not updating for a bit, I had to take some emntal ehalth time and everythign is both falling apart and trying to fall back together lol. anyways, I'm still alive! sorry for the wait
He picks Malfoy up in his arms, very carefully placing the boy’s head in his lap, and waits as Fawkes comes flying in, crying all over Malfoy’s face and stomach, only to burrow down and rest his head on Malfoy’s chest. Soft grey eyes open moments later, a pale hand comes up to stroke at Fawkes’ head.
What was once a great library lays in tatters, books thrown about, chairs broken and filled with cobwebs. It smells like mold and mildew, but Misty charges in, grabs one of the few books that are still on the mostly empty shelves, and forces it into his hand.
Red rushes to meet red and for a second Draco actually starts to feel bad. And then Weasley starts towards him and for a moment he actually kinda hopes he’ll leave the place with a black eye, then his father wouldn’t be as ruthless tonight. Of course Harry bloody Potter has to hold him back right as Father Weasley appeared. Surely this can’t be good for his migraine.
"I guess we should, huh?"  Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly as Draco donned his jacket.  He smiled though, when the tall blond offered him his arm to lead him out of the, now crowded, pub.  Neither spoke as they wove their way through the mass of people and headed towards the door.  The rush of cool, winter air was a shock as they stepped outside into the chilly evening.  "Well, I guess I'll see you around," Harry blushed as he began to pull away from Draco to apparate home, only to be stopped as Draco tugged his arm.  Harry looked up into those fathomless grey eyes, his blush deepening as Draco's eyelids began to droop shut and his face began to slowly descend to Harry's.
Harry scowled even more and shook his head to rid himself of that particularly disturbing thought.  His eyes flicked back up to Malfoy, sat just across from him at the professor's table, eating his typical breakfast of oatmeal with a light sprinkling of cinnamon and meticulously cut up apple slices.  Really, he had to stop noticing these things.  His scowl deepened some more, it was like sixth year all over again and Hermione would
Harry had to strain his ears to hear just what it was Malfoy had managed to get out, before making his escape down the neighbouring aisle of books. He blinked a few times as he came to the realization that Malfoy had apologized. It wasn't the first time he had heard the Slytherin apologize. He had done so after his trials. He had shown up at the Burrow in late June and had apologized to each Weasley individually. He had done the same to Harry and Hermione, and before anyone could pick their jaws up off the floor, he had vanished. So no, this wasn't the first apology Harry had heard coming from Malfoy's lips. But it was the first for such a trivial matter as a few harsh words. Of course, he had still managed to slip one of Harry's least favourite nick names into the apology, but he figured that was just Malfoy being, well, Malfoy.
Which, of course, was what had led Harry to his current predicament.  He was sat in the living room of the Burrow for the weekly Sunday Supper with the Weasleys, his elbows resting on his knees, as he spoke softly with Ron and Hermione.
Draco looked at the man before him and then glanced down at the tanned hand still clutching his much paler wrist.  He looked back up at Potter and raised one golden brow "May I help you, Potter?"  His voice lacked his usual bite, but the sentiment was still there.  He had already made a fool of himself once today, he wasn't about to do so again.
"I'm sorry to hear that.  Hermione and Ron aren't coming either.  Hermione just owled.  She's sick and I guess Ron is taking care of her?  She didn't really say though, just that she's ill and they're both staying home."
Draco had decided he was done waiting for Harry to tell him what was wrong.  It was almost mid-December by now, and Harry seemed to be growing more and more distant.  They’d still have their daily chats over tea and sometimes they’d even accompany one another into Hogsmeade for their Christmas shopping.  However, despite their near constant company, Draco could feel Harry was distracted or troubled about something.  At first, he’d thought he’d something wrong, or had offended Harry in some way.  But he hoped Potter would be mature enough to tell him if he was angry with him for any reason.  Regardless, he was tired of waiting for Potter to get his shit together and tell him just what in the ever-living fuck was going on in that impossibly thick skull of his.  It was high time he confronted the infuriating man to figure out what had changed between them.  So, it was with no small amount of trepidation that Draco wrapped up his last class of the day and made his way to Potter’s office for their daily tea.
Draco rolled his eyes, determined to not take the bait, tempting as it was.  "Yes, well, he may not have been everyone's favourite", he drawled, deliberately not hearing Potter's snort of derision, "but he was rather iconic to us Slytherins."  With that, Draco hefted his trunk once more, and strolled down the corridor, passing by Potter with little more than a polite nod, mentally berating himself for letting the man get to him yet again.  As he headed towards his chambers, he knew he would have to do better if he wanted to live up to Minerva's expectations.  He wanted to do well for her; he wanted to prove himself, both to her and the rest of the Wizarding World.  He was more than his family name, more than his past.  It had taken a long time for him to get to the point where he could say that and mean it, and he wasn't about to let Potter make him forget it.
So it was on the second Thursday of January, a day before their traditional pub night, and Hermione and Pansy were sitting together in a cosy coffee shop in muggle London, finalizing their plan for the next evening.  "So," stated Hermione, her hands wrapped around her steaming mug as she leaned back into the comfy chair across from Pansy.  "I'll owl Harry at five past six to tell him I'm horribly ill and Ron and I won't be able to make it."
The kiss was soft and gentle.  An exploration between two new lovers.  Harry moaned quietly as Draco swiped his tongue along his slightly chapped lips, begging for entrance.  As Harry's lips parted, Draco stepped closer, bringing their bodies flush against one another.  Harry's hands moved to wind themselves around Draco's neck, as Draco's hands gripped Harry's hips.  It was minutes before they pulled away, their foreheads resting together as they caught their breath.
"Well, yeah, I guess that would have worked.  It just seemed too…small?  I don't know.  I just...I don't know."  Potter tilted his head to the side, a small line forming between his dark brows. Draco couldn't help but think that he looked, rather infuriatingly, like a confused puppy.
have more than a few choice words for him concerning the breaking of old and "destructive" habits.  Come to think of it, Ron would have a few comments himself on the matter.  Harry clenched his jaw and looked back down at his morning paper.  He had to snap out of this.  So what if Malfoy wasn't the same slimy git as when he was a kid, Harry had grown up too, although he was beginning to question if that was actually accurate.
Harry was staring at his two friends in slight indignant shock.  “Hey now!  I am perfectly capable of figuring out my feelings for myself,” Harry declared, studiously ignoring the matching arched eyebrows from the newlyweds.  “Besides, it’s not like it was that obvious…right?”
Harry groaned around Malfoy's cock, the vibrations going straight to the base of Draco's spine. He was moaning loudly enough for the sounds to echo off the walls of the room, making him immensely grateful for the silencing charm Harry had cast.
" he tried to remind himself.  He sighed heavily and dropped his head to join his hands on the table.  "
"  Of course, his heart didn't listen as Harry returned with their drinks wearing a wide smile.  His emerald green eyes alight with happiness while he stared right at Draco, causing the blond to melt.  "
.  filled with curiosity, Draco edged towards the figure, getting barely close enough to recognise the inky black hair and tanned skin.  Because of course it was Potter.  He looked at the man before him, who still hadn't noticed him standing there, and had the brief urge to escape back into the safe confines of his office, or at least escape to another part of the castle grounds.  But something held him back.  It was as if something was pulling him towards Potter, compelling him to reach out, to say something, anything really.
"Er, yea-yeah.  I, uh, I guess it's just us then."  The green-eyed man stuttered out awkwardly, a blush creeping its way up his neck.  Cursing himself soundly, Harry looked down at his hands and swiftly told himself to get it together, damn it.  "Do, uh, do you want anything to hum, drink?"  He asked Draco, once he thought he had control over his voice and his treacherous mind, wincing at the slight stutter that escaped him anyway.
a friendship.  Did that mean he might want more?  Draco’s heart and stomach did a sort of floppy jig at that particular prospect, but he figured he had better be absolutely sure before he got excited.  “What do you mean you can’t keep the pretence of wanting
Harry looked at him for a minute more and then smiled, a wide and genuine smile.  The kind that showed all of his stupidly perfect and idiotically white teeth.  The kind that made Draco remember just how fucking gorgeous Harry really was.  The kind that made his stomach do several weird and wholly unnecessary somersaults and his lips curve up into a smile, purely of their own accord.
The bird looked at Draco and blinked a few times, before hooting rather impatiently and holding out its leg. Draco looked down and noticed a rolled up piece of parchment carefully tied to the owl's left foot. He regarded the owl for a few more seconds and decided what the hell. Reaching forward slowly, he untied the letter and started to unfurl it, only to be stoped by a sharp peck against the back of his hand.
“This,” Harry gesticulated wildly.  “This having tea and being friends!  I can’t keep it up anymore.”  Draco’s heart clenched painfully in his chest, but Harry wasn’t done talking yet.  “I can’t keep the pretence of wanting
Soon, Potter's hands began to move again. Tracing over the scars and running along Draco's muscles. He dragged his mouth away from Malfoy's and began to pepper kisses along his jawline, nipping carefully with his teeth and using his tongue to swiftly soothe over the small hurts he left along the skin. Both boys knew the marks would only deepen until they were starkly visible against Draco's skin, but that seemed to excite them. Draco particularly wanted to show the world that he was absolutely and unequivocally Harry's.
"So..." Draco looked down at the table, using his fingernail to scratch at a small divot in the wood.  "It's just us then?"  Harry stiffened as he began to realize the implication of Draco's words.  It was indeed just them.  But surely this couldn't count as a date, right?  It wasn't as if Draco was into him...right?  No, of course not.  He was just being silly.  It was just dinner and some drinks between mates.  Never mind the fact that he had been in love with this particular mate since he'd met him.
“RONALD,” Hermione shrieked, hitting her husband in the arm and receiving a rather indignant ‘ow’ in return, much to Harry’s amusement.  He let them bicker on while he pondered his situation.  If Draco truly did reciprocate his feelings, what would be next?  He would assume they’d date, but it’d been so long since he’d had a proper relationship, he wasn’t entirely sure he would know how to go about it.  Of course, there was always the possibility Draco only saw Harry as a friend, and then what?  Would they be able to stay friends if Harry told Malfoy how he felt and he was turned down?  He would hope so, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to risk it.  As Molly called out that dinner was a ready and Ron and ‘Mione stopped bickering, Harry came to the decision he would need more time to think about Draco and the possibilities surrounding their relationship.  He’d fucked too many things up by just rushing in with his Gryffindor courage and stupidity (as Draco would call it).  No, he needed time to weigh out all the options and possible consequences.  He was not going to fuck up what he had with Draco because he was too busy following his dick instead of his brain.  Besides, as much as he wanted a relationship with Draco, there was no way he was going to force the man into something if he didn’t want it.  Draco deserved to be happy, and Harry wasn’t sure he could be the one to make him happy.
, he shut the door and made his way to the desk where Malfoy was seated.  "That wasn't exactly an invitation, Potter."  Draco drawled, watching from the corner of his eye as the shorter boy grabbed a chair from another desk and dragged it over.  The blonde let out an irritated huff when Potter sat barely a foot away and settled his piercing green gaze on him.
"Pansy and Blaise aren't coming.  Apparently their kneazel is sick, throwing up all over their rugs according to Pans."  Draco told Harry as he sat down across from the raven-haired man.
Alright, I may have gotten a bit carried away with this one.  It's a bit longer than the previous pieces and is really more of a short story than a one shot.  That being said, I hope you guys enjoy it!
Draco was dumbfounded. He was shocked and stunned and so incredibly confused. "What the hell?" He muttered to himself, as he read and reread the letter, a blush creeping up his neck. Who in Merlin's name would write him of all people a love letter? And an anonymous one at that. His mind instantly went to the one person he wanted it to be. The one person he didn't dare hope it actually was, despite the P used to sign the letter. Bright green eyes and messy black hair flashed through his mind before he shook his head, scowl deepening.
Harry read the note twice before writing out a short reply telling Hermione to get well soon and that both her and Ron would be missed.  With that, he gave the note to her owl and sent him off just in time to look up and see Draco striding towards their customary table with a small scowl marring his gorgeous face.

"Potter.  Fancy seeing you here.  I, uh, I wasn't aware you were at Hogwarts again."  Draco cringed at the way his voice turned up at the end, making his words more of a question, rather than a statement.
Draco leaned down, so his forehead was resting on Potter's, and spoke softly, but firmly. "Harry, listen to me. We all make mistakes. Merlin knows I've made plenty. I forgave you for that a long time ago. Plus, if my memory serves me right, I was attempting to crucio you in that moment, so technically you were defending yourself. I don't blame you." Carefully, he brought his hands up to Harry's face, cupping both cheeks softly. He looked into Potter's eyes and made sure the boy saw how honest he was being in this moment. Potter gave a shy smile before Draco fitted his lips back onto his.
Draco had to clear his throat a few times before his voice would work properly and even then his affirming 'yes' was still shaky and somewhat gravelly.  Harry's smile widened before he stood up and took Draco's hands, pulling him up as well.  Bringing their bodies flush against one another and wrapping one arm around the blonde's waist, he placed one hand on a pale cheek and guided their lips together once more.  This time, the kiss was slow and gentle, yet still passionate and fuelled by desire. Slowly, Harry began to walk Draco back until the backs of his thighs were pressed against the edge of the desk. Draco moaned loudly as Harry began to roll his hips, grinding their growing erections together. As they rutted against each other, Draco moved his hands to grab Harry's ass and pull him closer, causing the raven-haired boy to groan into the kiss.
The raven-haired boy took Draco's question as permission to step into the room, much to the blonde's annoyance.  With a soft
He looked straight into Harry's eyes for a few seconds before lowering his gaze to the ground in defeat. "Sorry, Scarhead." He mumbled as he began to turn away. He had a sudden urge to be as far away from Harry Potter as possible. It wasn't as if he'd ever have a chance with him anyhow.
"Harry....oh fuck....Harry, you have to stop."  Harry pulled his mouth off Draco's cock with an audible pop, looking up at the blonde with concerned eyes.
He was just drifting to sleep when he felt a kiss pressed against his forehead and Harry muttering, "sleep well, love."  He smiled and let himself fall into oblivion, held by the one and only person he had ever truly wanted.
Slowly, Harry lifted his head and let his gaze meet Draco’s.  The blonde could tell he was trying to work out some sort of inner turmoil and decision, so he waited for Potter to speak.  After a couple of minutes, although Draco could have sworn it was an eternity, Harry reached for his own mug and then indicated for Draco to take a seat.  As Draco took his tea and sat, he tried to calm the riling fear and anxiety swarming within him.  He’d come to care for Harry a great deal since the beginning of term, well before that if he was to be honest with himself, and he didn’t want to lose Harry’s friendship.  However with how Harry had been acting recently, Draco was petrified Harry was already lost to him.
“You do?”  Harry asked him warily, eyes slightly narrowed as if he were trying to judge Draco’s sincerity.
Potter scowled for a second, gaze still trained on Malfoy's mouth as Draco's tongue darted out to moisten his bottom lip.  "Oh fuck it," Harry muttered before grabbing the back of Draco's neck and crashing their lips together, earning a muffled squeak from the rather shocked blonde.
Draco found he was having a hard time breathing, but he let himself focus on one word in Harry’s outburst.
"Would you just wait for a second?"  Potter was breathing heavily, his chest rapidly rising up and down.  "Holy shit, you're a fast walker."
Harry broke their eye contact with a self-deprecating huff.  “How can I not want something more, Draco?  You are amazing and witty and gorgeous.  But I know you don’t want anything more from me, which is why I can’t keep doing this.”
"Well you didn't exactly sign it. How the hell was I supposed to know?"  Draco muttered as he lay his head back down on Harry's chest.  Potter began to stroke his hair and his eyelids began to droop. He felt sated and sleepy and thoroughly used in the best way possible.
And so a tradition was born.  No matter how often they all saw each other at the Ministry, or how often they ran into one another in Diagon Alley, on the second Friday of every month, the six all met at their favourite pub at exactly six o'clock in the evening and would stay to talk until closing at exactly two o'clock in the morning.  They would talk about anything and everything and it wasn't until a year after graduation that their little group began to change.  Ron finally convinced Hermione to marry him and Pansy finally convinced Blaise to go out with her.  By the third year, Blaise and Pansy were married and Ron and Hermione had a child.  Leaving Harry and Draco as the only single two in the group.  However, what neither knew, was that they had both been secretly harbouring feelings for the other since they were young.
Harry’s head snapped up and he turned to stare in shock and rising horror at her.  “Minnie knows!?  She’s going to think I’m so unprofessional!  And after she gave me that whole speech about being professional in the workplace.  I know that was about letting old rivalries die, but the principles are the same and I’ve completely cocked it up”  He bemoaned.
Harry groaned softly and let his head fall into his hands.  “Do you guys think everyone else knows?  Do you think he knows?”  He didn’t really need their answers though, the hesitant silence from both of them were confirmation enough.
The second Friday of January had gotten off to a bad start for Harry.  He had woken up late, had spilled tea all down his Auror robes, and had hit yet another dead end in what was turning out to be a particularly flummoxing case.  So, when he had arrived at the usual pub, just off Diagon Alley, at six in the evening he was looking forward to a night of relaxed fun with his mates.  However, at precisely 6:05 Hermione's owl dropped a hastily penned note on the table before him.
"It attacked me! I would hardly call it a 'poor thing', Pans," Draco rolled his eyes and returned his stony gaze to the owl. It merely cocked its head and stared at him with massive eyes. "Ugh, fine. Whatever," he sighed and passed the pesky bird a piece of bacon. It hooted softly, took the offering, and flew off, leaving a smattering of feathers in its wake.  Draco glared after it as a few feathers landed in his oatmeal, thoroughly ruining it. "Damn bird," he muttered as he returned his focus to the paper in his hands, studiously ignoring Blaise's poorly muffled chuckling. The blonde scowled as he unrolled the parchment and began to read the messy writing.
Draco was beginning to feel distinctly uncomfortable as he shifted from foot to foot under the weight of Potter's gaze. "Um, hi?"  His voice sounded shaky, even to him, and he cringed.  He looked down at the rocky shore, shoving a hand through his hair before looking back up at the man in front of him.
Harry was finding himself rather surprised by Malfoy.  It wasn't that he had been expecting the pointy git to still be evil (if he had ever truly been evil to begin with), but he hadn't expected the warm civility the man radiated either.  When Minnie had told him she was hiring none other than Draco Malfoy to be their new Potions Professor, Harry hadn't exactly been thrilled.  He'd known Malfoy was the natural choice to take over Horace's position, but he just hadn't been prepared for that day to come so soon.  His face must have shown his thoughts, because as soon as Minerva was finished breaking the news to him, she went right into, what was probably a well-rehearsed, speech about professionalism in the work place and the merits that come along with letting go of old rivalries.
"Just because he was a capable professor doesn't mean I had to like him personally.  He was far too liberal with his detentions and took points off any house save his own much too quickly."  Potter's eyes held a mischievous glint to them as he stared at Malfoy, willing the tall blonde to get riled up.
"Didn't you hear me shouting for you to wait up?"  Potter looked into Draco's eyes, his viridescent gaze full of worry and a small amount of amusement.  He let out tiny chuckle at Draco's obvious expression of surprise and confusion.  "Look," he started, letting go of Draco's wrist and shoving his hand through his unruly ebony curls.  "I didn't mean to freeze up back there, I was just...well, I was startled is all.  And I didn't know what to say or even how to start.  I mean, it's us.  We've never exactly been the best of friends." Draco let out a delicate snort at this, causing Potter to smirk.  "I guess I was just figuring out what to say, and then you just took off."
“You love me?”  Draco asked breathlessly, as he tried not to smile too much, receiving only a painfully hesitant nod in return.  “I see.  And just when did you come to this shocking conclusion of self-discovery?”
Harry was pondering just what to do as he wandered further and further into the maze of books that was the Hogwarts Library. Earlier that week, the Eighth Years had been assigned a project in Defence Against the Dark Arts and Harry was having a particularly frustrating time with it. The green-eyed boy sighed heavily as he continued to search for books to use for research. He was certain he was nearing the very back of the library by now and he had still found nothing he thought to be useful. He had just turned the corner to start on a new row when he suddenly found himself on the cold stone floor, with a rather suspicious weight on top of him. He grunted and fixed his, now completely askew, glasses before looking down at his chest and more importantly what, or in this case who, had crashed into him. Needless to say, he was rather shocked to see a head of white-blond hair, a sharp nose, and light grey eyes staring right at him.
He had just reached the shoreline when he saw someone a little way down the path, skipping rocks into the, otherwise calm, water.  He watched as the figure, definitely male, flung stone after stone across the lake, each one bouncing a few times along the surface before sinking below it with a rather loud
Draco was unbelievably bored.  He had already finished grading the papers he had assigned to his sixth years and was halfway through grading the healing draughts he'd had his third years brew.  It was mid-October by now, and he had been right about it being a particularly chilly winter.  He sighed and put down his quill, looking at the door of his office.  He drummed his fingers on his desk and sat back in his chair.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and the last thing he wanted was to spend it in his stuffy office, grading potions.  He looked back down at the potion before him, scowling at it.  He really should get these done though he'd been putting them off long enough.  But then again, what would one more day hurt?  He nodded to himself, a smile ghosting along his lips as he stood and strode out of his office.  He didn't know where he was going, but he figured outside was as good a place as any to stretch his legs.  He made short work of the steps leading out of the dungeon and made his way out of the main doors to the castle.  Without thinking, he veered off the main road and made his way down to the lake.
It took him a few seconds to come to the conclusion that he wished the blond hadn't left. It took him a few more to realize just why he wished the blond hadn't left. And it took him a few more seconds to decide to go after him. A total of thirty seconds after Malfoy's escape, Harry had found him still walking through the stacks of books, towards the front of the library. Seeing as they were still relatively far back in the library, Harry had absolutely no qualms about what he was about to do.
Harry watched him as he left, or rather he watched his ass. He let his head fall back to rest on the book case one last time as he grinned up at the ceiling. He'd have to remember to thank his Defence Professor later for that damn project. It did lead him to the library after all.
"Malfoy?"  The voice was deep and smooth and masculine and most definitely not Pansy.  It was a similar baritone to Blaise's voice, but unlike Blaise's slightly raspy one, this voice was smooth like butter and all too familiar to Draco.  "Look, I was thinking that maybe we could talk?"
By now, Draco was beginning to squirm under Harry's gaze. He could feel those penetrating green eyes as they travelled down his torso, past his hips, and back up again. He swallowed hard, expecting the boy to snipe back at him. Instead, Harry let out another low chuckle and focused his inspection on Draco's face, quirking his brow yet again.
Today, however, was about to prove itself quite the opposite of usual for Draco. Right as he had taken his first bite of his apple, a rather old looking barn owl landed right in front of him, interrupting Pansy's musings on the beauty of one Miss Hermione Granger, not that he minded this particular part. Pansy never shut up about the Granger girl. It was all quite annoying, if you asked Draco.
The Second Wizarding War was over.  Voldemort was finally dead, and all that was left was for the survivors to pick up the pieces of their lives and move on.  It was easier said than done as the Wizarding World slowly began to put itself back together.  The Golden Trio went back to Hogwarts along with the rest of their class mates and finished their education.  They mourned their losses, patched up old rivalries, and settled down to study for their N.E.W.Ts.  As their Eighth Year passed, Ron, Hermione, and Harry found peace with the rest of their students, particularly with Slytherin's favourite three.  Blaise, Pansy, and Draco had approached the Golden Trio in mid-November to call a truce.  By January, a budding friendship had emerged between the six, and by march, they were inseparable.  What was most surprising to all of Hogwarts, and the Wizarding World, was the friendship between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.  In fact, the only two who were not utterly dumbfounded by the development were Hermione Granger and Pansy Parkinson.  They had simply shared a knowing look and a smirk when Harry had been the first to break down and call Malfoy by his given name.  They had smirked again when Draco had called Potter by his given name, and for the first time, actually smiled at the shorter boy.  When graduation finally rolled around, Harry and Draco were the best of friends, and insisted that they all get together at least once a month to catch up after they left Hogwarts for good.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I think the poor thing wants a treat, Draco darling," Pansy drawled, raising one perfectly shaped brow at him.
“Well, I couldn’t say if Draco knows, but people have definitely started to notice, Harry,” Hermione said quietly, while placing her hand on his knee.  “However,” she spoke again, a little louder to be heard over his groan of embarrassment, “I wouldn’t be surprised if he reciprocated.  From the letters McGonagall and I have exchanged, it seems as if he’s fairly taken with you as well.”
“What do you mean ‘why’?  I just told you!  It would be too fucking painful to have tea with you every-day knowing you don’t feel the same, knowing you don’t love me back!”  Harry’s eyes widened as he seemed to realise what he’d said.  He seemed to be scrambling for something to say, while Draco merely tried to catch his breath and wrap his mind around what he’d just heard, not to mention his attempts to ignore the happy fluttering coming from his stomach and heart.
"Harry, please," Draco begged. He wiggled his hips a little to let Harry know he was ready. The ravenette grabbed Draco's hips and held him against the desk as the thrust hard and fast into his ass, causing both to scream out in pleasure.
“Ah.  In that case, I feel we must circle back to my previous question…why?  Why on earth would you think I wouldn’t harbour the same feelings as you, you absolute dolt?”  At this, Harry’s gaze snapped straight to Draco’s, seeing the amusement and fondness Draco was sure the grey depths held.
"Of course it's too much, Potter.  I shall sit where I like," Malfoy declared as he handed Harry his mug.  "Now, sit down and drink your tea.  I must tell you about what happened in my sixth year Ravenclaw and Slytherin class today."  Harry obeyed with the barest hint of a smile, thus beginning their newfound tradition of tea whilst they talked about their days.  They'd talk about their classes, students and lesson plans.  And when they were done with that, they would move on to their personal lives.  Harry had to admit he was surprised.  He'd never imagined that he could have such a good friendship with Draco Malfoy of all people.  Of course, he didn't fail to notice the triumphant glances Minerva would send them as they chatted and laughed over meals and in the professor's lounge.  And he had to admit, she right.  He was finding he had much more in common with Draco than he had initially thought.  From their mutual love of quidditch to their shared dry humour, Harry and Draco always had something to talk about.  There was never a dull moment around Draco and Harry found himself seeking the blonde out more and more, eager for his easy and comfortable company.
"One firewhiskey.  Ogden's Finest,"  Harry said as he set the glass down with an audible thunk in front of Draco, still smiling.  Draco looked at the glass, and then back at Harry before returning the shorter man's smile and thanking him.  "So," Harry's deep voice washed over him as he sat down again.  "How have you been?  I mean, I know we just saw each other a couple of days ago,  but we didn't really get the chance to catch up."  Draco looked, meeting Harry's bright green eyes with his own grey ones.
"Hm?  Oh, right, sorry.  I got caught up in my own thoughts I guess."  He shook his head slightly and took out his wand, shooting a quick
"Do you ever watch where you're going, Boy Wonder? Or do you simply expect people to get out go your way, now that you're famous?" He drawled, making sure to inject his voice with an extra dose of Malfoy venom. Harry just laughed as he crossed his arms, his biceps flexing deliciously according to Draco, and leaned back against one of the many book cases surrounding them. Ever since they had returned to Hogwarts, Harry to finish his education and Draco to fulfil one of the requirements for his parole after the war, the two boys had managed to come to an unspoken truce. It was a 'you don't bother me and I won't bother you' type of silent agreement and they had stuck to it almost religiously. As such, this was the first real encounter they'd had in the month and a half they had been back.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Of course you're here for a book, you simpleton. We are in a library after all."
“Well it’s hardly surprising, Ronald,” Hermione quietly interjected.  “It’s not like we didn’t see this coming.”
"Oh...I....uhhh...I just wanted to...um...." Harry's eyes flitted down to the desk, spotting the letter, and then back up to meet Draco's, swallowing thickly before opening his mouth again and quickly shutting it.
That was until Harry knelt down and angled Draco's member towards his mouth, placing a chaste kiss to the tip before parting his lips and sliding them over the hot and heavy penis in his hands.  Draco had definitely been wrong. This was the most wonderful thing he had ever experienced.  Holy Merlin, it was good. He gasped as the tip of his cock hit the back of Harry's throat. He moaned when Harry kept going, taking him deep into the recesses of his mouth and throat. He cursed loudly when Harry began to suck, hollowing out his cheeks and bobbing his head a few times before swallowing around the thick head and shaft. By now, Draco could hardly breathe. He was trying and failing to not buck his hips and thrust deeper into Harry's mouth and somehow his hands had wended their way into Harry's messy hair, gripping at the base of his skull and tugging at the follicles.
He flicked his eyes back to the Prophet and attempted to read an article about werewolves in the ministry.  It was supposed to be a scathing exposé about the supposed corruption in the Magical Creatures Department but seeing as it was written by none other than Rita Skeeter, Harry knew to take the article with a grain of salt (or a block of salt, really).  However, he just couldn't seem to focus on the words.  His mind was still going over every encounter he'd had with Malfoy over the past week.  He hadn't had a direct conversation with the man since the very first day, but they'd seen each other in the halls and at meals.  Each time, Malfoy had given him a subtle nod and a small smile, nothing too warm or friendly by most people's standards, but for Malfoy it was downright sunny.  Harry scowled at the thought of a chipper Malfoy, with the blonde hair and wiry form, it reminded him of Luna.  Well that was just great, now he had an image of a Luna-esque Malfoy, wearing her cat spectacles and bright pink and purple jumper while talking about wrackspurts and crumple-horned snorkacks in that low, drawling voice of his.
"Well, let's hope they don't catch on to our little ruse."  The bushy haired girl said.  They had both been watching Harry and Draco since the beginning and by this point were rather invested in what happened between the two.  The women shared a conspiratorial smile as they finished their coffee and headed back to the Ministry for work.
“Yeah mate, I had to hear all about how great Ferret-Face is…for a whole night.”  Ron’s face had now taken on a look of mock horror, although Harry suspected it wasn’t entirely false.  There was still a lot to work through between him and Malfoy.  “Besides, even if you hadn’t talked  about him all night, you practically have tea dates with the git every day.”
"What's wrong?" Blaise's deep voice jolted Draco out of his wishful thinking. The dark-skinned boy was leaning over the table from where he sat next to Pansy, in an attempt to read the mysterious note upside down.  The blonde blushed and hastily rolled the letter back up.
"Last I checked, you're still a Potter.  Technically, I do use your name."  Draco knew all too well what Harry was trying to say, but he was in a difficult sort of mood.  The prank letter had gotten deeper under his skin than he had initially thought apparently.  He glanced at Ha-Potter and was met with narrowed eyes and a slightly clenched jaw.
While it was true the war had ended just over seven years ago, the Wizarding World was never quick to forget one's mistakes, no matter how hard he tried to make up for them.  He had spent the first two years after the war at St. Mungo's helping them brew potions and heal the sick.  He had planned on going back to the hospital after and becoming a Potions Master but figured he could do just as much good in helping to shape the minds of the future.  Plus, he could always brew healing draughts and tinctures during his free time and send them to Mungo's.
By the time Harry reached Draco's collarbones, Draco was a whimpering, moaning mess. His head was thrown back, giving Harry more access to the sensitive skin of his neck and his hips were bucking against Harry's, desperate in their quest for any sort of friction at all. Draco's erection was straining painfully against his trousers, the head already beginning to leak.  His head snapped up when Harry began undoing the buttons to his trousers, releasing his aching cock and shoving both his trousers and pants down.  He helped Draco step out of the rumpled pile of clothes before lifting the boy onto the desk and stepping between his parted thighs.  He gingerly grasped Draco's cock and began to lightly stroke up and down.  Draco threw his back again, his lungs going tight as he attempted to haul in a breath.  The pleasure was so incredibly amazing. Draco had never experienced something so wonderful in his life.
"No, but I figured I would make it up on the spot.  You know, practice a little improve."  Hermione rolled her eyes.  As much as she hated it, Pansy was quite impeccable at making things up as she went along.
"Me too, Draco.... ohhhh fuck!"  Harry screamed out as he came hard and fast inside Draco, coating his insides white with come.  The feeling of being filled by Harry sent Draco over the edge.  Letting out a breathy, high pitched scream, Draco spurted come over both the desk and his stomach.
Harry’s fifth year students were just coming out of the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom and some offered him a few hellos, which he returned with a distracted smile and a nod in their direction, as he entered Harry’s domain.  Potter, it seemed, had already retreated into his office, so Draco let out a little sigh and steeled himself for the upcoming conversation.
Potter was walking along the corridor leading to the professors' lodgings, obviously coming from his rooms, when he suddenly stopped mid stride to stare at the man standing awkwardly at the mouth of the hallway looking rather shocked himself.  All these years, and Draco still couldn't believe how absolutely gorgeous...no, not gorgeous, stupid...Potter looked.  With his stupidly ruffled, raven coloured hair, his doubly stupid emerald green eyes, and his triply stupid golden skin.  It really was quite infuriating.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the endearment that seemed to slip so effortlessly from Draco’s kiss swollen lips.  “I am a pillock.  And a dolt.  Not to mention a moron, idiot, or any other words that mean oblivious.  I really thought you would want nothing to do with me after I told you.  I didn’t dare let myself hope you’d feel as I do.”  Harry smiled gently at Draco and touched their foreheads together, sighing contently.
He pulled his hands away from Harry and couldn't help but smile at the look of utter loss on Harry's face.  "I do believe it is time for us to be heading home."  He said softly, his voice caressing over Harry as he stood too.
The kiss was strong and passionate, causing Draco to melt immediately. Right from the start, Harry had dominance as he swiped his tongue along the seam between Draco's lips, begging for entrance.  As soon as Malfoy parted his lips, his tongue dipped inside the velvety recesses of the blonde's mouth, running over smooth teeth and stroking along the roof of his mouth, before beginning a slow, languid dance with Draco's own tongue.  Draco was glad he was already sitting, his joints going weak and turning to jelly from the sheer feeling of having Harry's lips on his.  He gave a small moan that sounded more like a whimper, much to his embarrassment and tried to move closer to Harry without breaking the kiss or falling off his chair.  All too soon though, Harry pulled back to look Draco in the eye.  He smiled shyly, both boys panting slightly from the exertion of the kiss.
"If I recall correctly, you never particularly got along with Severus."  Draco quirked one immaculate brow up, carefully ignoring the implication that Potter did indeed know about his relation to the late Potions Master.
"But most of them are from me, from what I did to you." Harry looked stricken at finally seeing what had resulted from what he had considered to be the biggest mistake of his life. He dragged his eyes up to Draco's ever so slowly, as if he was afraid what he'd see in them. "How can you kiss me without thinking of this? How can you even look at me?"
"I believe in efficiency, Potter."  Draco murmured, shortening his stride nonetheless and earning himself a crooked grin in return.  He decided not to dwell on the somewhat floppy, fluttery manoeuvre his stomach did as a result of that slightly mischievous smile.  He told himself it was nothing really, that it was his stomach's peculiar way of reminding him he'd skipped lunch earlier today and that was it.  It had to be nothing, because what else could it be?
"And I'll owl Draco at ten past six to let him know that Blaise and I will have to cancel."  Pansy replied, a devilish smile tugging at her lips.
He was still grinning like a fool as he made his way to the massive doors that opened up to the halls of Hogwarts, which would eventually take him up to the Room of Requirement.
“Harry, I believe it is past time we talked about what’s wrong,” he began, as he pushed open the office door and stepped into the slightly cramped space.  The sight that met him was more than slightly disconcerting.  Two mugs were set out on the desk as usual, with Harry sat behind the large mahogany piece.   However, what concerned Draco was the way in which he was sitting, with his forehead resting upon the surface as he heaved out a rather large and loud sigh.  Draco softly shut the door and leaned against it, staring at the man before him.  “See, now this is precisely what I am talking about.  Clearly there is something wrong and I might be able to help of you would just tell me for Merlin’s fucking sake!”
“You mean to tell me you’ve actually developed feelings for the pointy git?”  Ron whispered incredulously his eyes wide as he leaned closer to his best friend.
As he caught up to Draco, he grabbed his wrist and spun the blond around, noting the surprise in those hypnotic grey eyes. Draco only had time to suck in a breath and prepare for what he was almost sure would be a punch, before his back was rammed up against the nearest book case. Harry's arms came to rest on either side of Draco, against the books as he tipped his face up to stare at the taller boy's lips. Dragging his eyes up to meet Draco's, Harry waited for him to push him away or yell at him. When Draco's only response was to take in a shaky breath and lick his bottom lip, Harry smiled hungrily. He grabbed the back of Malfoy's neck and crashed their lips together in a heated kiss, swallowing Malfoy's immediate moan of arousal as he ran his tongue along the boy's sinfully soft lips. He groaned as Draco's lips parted, allowing his tongue to explore the recesses of Malfoy's hot, velvety mouth. He groaned louder when Draco began to take charge and, grabbing Harry's hips, walked them back so it was now Harry who was pressed against the other book case across the aisle. His groan turned into a low moan and then a breathy whine as Draco began to grind his groin against Harry, who was now uncomfortably hard. He whined again when Draco broke away from the kiss, breathing heavily, grey eyes molten with desire and he stared down at Harry. He rolled his hips against Harry's one last time before leaning down to lick the shell of his ear and nibble at his earlobe. The ravenette's head thumped back against the book case as Draco's breath brushed his ear and neck, making him shiver when the blond whispered, "As much as I would love to continue, I am not fucking the Golden Boy against the books in the Hogwarts Library. It would be incredibly offensive to the books," he winked as his eyes met burning green ones.
Lucius: Draco has a pet. Hermione has a pet. That Ronald has like seven chess sets...Blaise is Pansy's pet...
also, I had someone dm me on tumblr and say that the long breaks between scenes is weird and I wanted to let y'all know that it's just a change between scenes. like the little ..... that people do sometimes or the boarders. does that make sense? let me know how you feel about it and i can think of a solution if it is confusing. also sorry if this isn't up to par, I usually read my chapters outloud to someone but they had a prior engagement today
misses the blueberry muffins that grace Slytherin tables every weekend morning. Or her daily ten cups of coffee...
Their entry way is a little over the top, but that’s just because Narcissa loves pistachio green and Draco’s more of a emerald green person. Even so, their fainting couch by the fireplace used to be one of his favorite napping spots. When he was young he’d curl up next to whichever one of them was reading there and dream of faraway places more magical than himself.
“Did you know that Basilisks in Greek Mythology are completely different than they are in European Mythology? The Greeks say they used to have wings and talons.”
“Who can blame you? You were on your way to save a life, I feel like that might outweigh the whole rotting corpse aroma for you Gryffindors, but I’d give anything for even a vomit smell right now.”
Draco has every intention of finishing the assignment and studying for the quickly approaching finals, a good and normal thing for a student to want. Naturally, it doesn’t happen.
Draco takes the gift, his hands only shake a little bit, but no one has been able to give him something with the messes each year seemed to bring.
They’ve only known each other for a week and she’s already good at guilt tripping him. Partly because Draco really doesn’t care one way or the other, but he does like making Misty smile, so he sighs in defeat, hiding a grin when Misty rushes up the broken stair case and returns with a dingy old coat that’s covered in soot but will at least manage to hide most of Draco’s frame.
“I have a different plan.” Harry smiles. “I won’t even need a broom. I can’t say a lot, but it’s going to be showy and a big ‘fuck you’ to the whole competition. If you take the broom, you’ll probably get done before the others, and I fully plan on taking as long as possible, so don’t worry about it.”
To make matters worse, when the wand in question is held up Harry calls out ‘hey that’s mine! I dropped it…’ because he must have dropped his brain too.
Her face softens at that, taking him completely off guard. She’s never looked so kind, not at him at least.
She’s frozen in the hallways, a hand up and holding a mirror, one single sheet of paper limp in her other hand.
“Great! Now that that’s solved, someone tell me when we’re doing presents, because I’m going to need the entire Christmas day to get ready, and I refuse to do it after. I was thinking the twenty-fourth? Possibly the twenty-third?”
“For Merlin’s sake! I’ve never poisoned anyone!” Theo gives him a look. “Unintentionally, I’ve never poisoned someone unintentionally.”
“Whatever, he’s been sneaky around here too much for my liking. I bet he’s trying to take down the heir of Slytherin single-handedly.”
just teenage drama, a lot of kissing, honestly this is arguably the softest chapter i've ever written
“You moron. I’ll kill Dumbledore for doing this to you,” They hear Lupin whisper and ya know, Draco’s not all
“It’s actually not a bad idea,” Ron shrugs, “I mean no one but Harry can get down there, and if he teaches us how to open it, we can get down there too, so it’s probably one of the safest places, and the snake is dead, right?”
His personal confusion on the matter doesn’t prevent piles from appearing before them, probably due to Winky and Kreecher.
Draco turns away from them with a little laugh, dragging Ron over to Blaise and Narcissa for a chat so he can find what Pansy’s done with his poor boyfriend.
“I’m trying to save Buckbeak, okay?” Looks like Harry has figured out shouting does in fact shut Draco up for a few minutes. “The three of us have been at it since we found out there was even going to be a trial. And you’re right, you don’t have to tell me all your juicy life details, but there is an innocent life at stake here and I’d rather not see it ended just because your father is a dickhead!”
Red eyes lock onto Harry’s, the laughter fades. That stupid snake-like face turns stone cold, like a realizaiton in the making just slapped him in the face.
be real. Like Cedric was trying to prove to Harry that everything happening around them is a dream, he stops in the middle of the stairway.
“Did you know…..” Harry begins, “That I hadn’t had a proper meal until my first night at Hogwarts? At the Dursley’s I was only allowed scraps, if I was allowed anything at all. I thought it was cruel of them then, to make me cook their meals and not let me have anything but bits they didn’t want twice a week, all the while complaining and downgrading my mother and father and ‘their kind’. ‘Course I didn’t know they were talking about wizards until Hagrid showed up and turned Dudley into a pig….”
Harry shook his head, frantically. No way was he telling Malfoy- Draco- that they had almost kissed. His eyes dropped to Draco's lips unconsciously, and he was incredibly grateful that he was not currently looking at him. Draco turned to glare at him. "You are infuriating. You know-" and here Draco smirked, causing Harry to gulp, "I have a whole list of things to ask you about. You know, the blushing, more blushing, avoiding answering me when I ask about the blushing...why did you blush Harry?" Draco asked pointedly.
Ron shuddered and fell in step with Harry. "That slimy Slytherin has been making innuendoes since last night. He does it with all of us, it's a bloody nightmare!"
He noticed that Harry's eyes were getting closer, and he wondered which of them was leaning in. It was probably himself; Harry would never have been the one to initiate. But before their lips could meet, Madam Pince's screech interrupted them. They both jumped and pulled back immediately, looking around, but thankfully she was yelling at a different table for throwing a book.
There was no other option but to stay a dragon and continue flying without knowing his course. He had to come across Wizards eventually, right?
"Bloody fucking cloak," he muttered. Louder, in case Harry had gone ahead, he said, "You're a fucking insufferable tease, Harry. I hope you know that. I'm going to make you pay for it someday." He warned.
"There's no need to knock when I'm sleeping here, Potter," he drawled. "Or did you forget that even the Golden Boy doesn't get a room all to himself?"
He was still semi-hard; the long walk had caused his erection to wilt a bit. But however much he willed it away, the memories of making out with Harry kept on surfacing, and he would get hard all over again. There was nothing else for it. He would have to wank if he wanted to sleep.
He heard the chatter of students as his classmates began arriving. He did not turn to join them but stayed near the pumpkin patch. No one would want him interrupting their conversations anyways.
"Not so tough now, huh Malfoy? Your Death Eater pals aren't here anymore to back you up, isn't that right? You were sleeping in your comfortable room, while we were stuck being tortured in the dungeons! You even took part in it, you piece of nasty filth! How dare you come back here and show your face around those you helped to harm? You deserve every single thing we are about to do to you. And-" the younger student leaned down to whisper dangerously in Malfoy's ear, though his voice carried enough that Harry was still able to hear. "What's more is that you think you deserve it too. You know that whatever we do to you will never be enough." And with that, he signaled the others to begin their assault. They took turns hexing Malfoy, jeering and shouting insults all the while. Malfoy couldn't move, still under the effects of the first Petrificus Totalus.
Draco was tense, his muscles taut, and the lines in his neck standing out starkly. His jaw was clenched so tight it must have hurt. "As ready as I'll ever be," he said sharply.
Harry groaned. "Ron," he said, "kindly shut up now." He felt the tips of his ears turning pink. Draco gave him a smug look. "Fancy me for a while, did you, Potter?" He asked teasingly.
Harry blushed, and Draco realized he had hinted that if it weren't for all the books, they would be able to fit on Harry's bed together. And that had certain...implications. He was about to be embarrassed, too, except that he remembered what Pansy had told him about flirting. So he smirked and winked instead, and Harry blushed harder. Then Draco gathered his things, dumping them into his bag, and sauntered off to the library, not checking if Harry was following him. He knew he would.
"Don't get used to it," Draco warned, but Harry's smile undermined the statement. Just then, Hermione strode in, walking straight over to Draco and giving him a massive hug. Draco shot Harry a panicked look, but Harry, the useless boyfriend that he was, simply mouthed, "You're on your own with this one."
"Sorry. Didn't realize the door opened so easily." Goldstein said, flashing them an embarrassed grin. Draco scowled at him. Potter took the opportunity to escape, grabbing some clothes, and rushing to the bathroom. Goldstein casually walked over to his trunk and started rummaging around in it. Draco scowled harder at his back, before walking over to his own bed. He would come back to this another day. Potter would not escape him again.
"I can't even remember them." He said, out of nowhere. "The only pictures I have of them are in a photo book Hagrid gave me in 1st year. I saw them then, too, in the Mirror of Erised." Draco didn't know what that was, but he didn't interrupt to ask. "Then, in fourth year, I saw them again in the graveyard. They were just these strange ghost-like things, but they encouraged me, helping me get away from Voldemort. I saw a few memories of them in a Pensieve, too." Harry grimaced, and Draco wondered why. But Harry wasn't done. "And finally, just before I died, I was able to see them. Remus and Sirius, too. They made it better, you know. Easier to walk towards death. I couldn't have done it without them, without knowing I was going to be with them again." Silent tears fell from his eyes, but Harry didn't seem to notice. He fell silent once more, and Draco started to rub his back. Just as Draco was about to slip away, Harry said one final thing. "The Dementors. When they come close, I can hear my parents dying. My dad first, he tried to slow down Voldemort so my mum could get us to safety. Then I hear her screams, Voldemort telling her to get out of the way, then a flash of light. She needn't have died. Snape asked him not to kill her. He would have let her go." Harry sounded so vulnerable. So afraid, like a scared child. Draco couldn't possibly leave him like that. So he stayed, wrapping his arms around Harry as he cried. Harry didn't speak again for hours.
Draco shifted anxiously. If Pansy thought Potter had gotten good-looking (not that he wasn't before, but Pansy had always disagreed with that), then Potter had definitely gotten good-looking. He quickly changed the subject before his mind could begin to conjure up images.
A stubborn reporter, then. Harry kind of hated it when they made assumptions about his feelings, but this time they were pretty spot-on.
His mother was as ethereally beautiful as ever, golden hair flowing down her back. Two braids encircled her head, to which a small golden circlet was pinned. She wore an elegant day dress in dark green, which had the effect of making her look incredibly young. He could not look away.
Draco gaped. How had she known? Even Harry wouldn't have found out if not for that blasted map! He opened and closed his mouth, searching for something to say, some plausible way to deny what she had known. McGonagall gave him a kind smile. "Hogwarts quite loves to gossip - and as headmistress, the castle likes telling me things." She winked at him, then resumed grading papers, an apparent dismissal. Draco remained there a moment longer, then abruptly turned and left.
"-and then they told me to go away because I'm a nasty Death Eater. But that's okay because then I saw you! And I ran over, and here I am." Malfoy laughed delightedly.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair anxiously. Almost absentmindedly, he waved his hand, and the piles of letters on the table disappeared, hopefully never to be found again. Evil people, the lot of them. Who gave them the right to pass judgment upon their relationship, much less scold them for it?
"Isn't this wonderful, Draco? People will talk for ages about the amazing party I threw! Did you want something to drink?" Draco nodded and asked for a cocktail. After expertly mixing the drink, Pansy slid the glass over to him. She gave him an appraising look. "Are you okay, darling?" She asked with a concerned tone. Draco shook his head but didn't elaborate, instead opting to toss his drink back. He set the glass down and tapped it, silently asking for more. Pansy wordlessly poured him more of the same concoction, shooting him another worried look.
"I'm sorry, Draco, I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. I didn't regret it either. It's only that...well, whenever I find someone that makes me happy, it never works out." Harry moved closer, his chest brushing against Draco's back. "Sirius was the only chance I had at a father-figure, and I only knew him for two years, most of which we spent apart. Then Cho and Gin, neither of them worked out. I'm always waiting for the moment when Hermione and Ron will have to leave me too. I used to think they would go because I always put them in danger, now I think it will be when they finally get married and move into a place of their own. They'll start a family, and I'll never be fully a part of it. I'm just...I've learned to not hope for anything, to always expect the worst, because then I'll never be disappointed." Harry tugged Draco's hand, pulling him around, so they were facing each other, eyes immediately connecting.
Draco slowly put his notebook into his bag, mind still on McGonagall's words. He understood the theory, but it was just so complicated that he doubted it was feasible. Remembering his failed attempts at becoming an animagus, he wondered if he could con the headmistress into giving him the answer to both questions by disguising it as an effort to understand her lecture.
Harry's present for Draco was medium-sized and rattled around a bit when he shook it gently. At Harry's encouragement, he opened it carefully and pulled out three slender vials with silvery substances inside them.
Draco smirked at him. Harry could only just make out the blond's signature look in the dark room. "That's because I rather prefer putting things in my mouth to having things come out of it."
"Who was it, Draco? Tell me so I can go murder them!" Pansy said in a voice that almost made Draco shiver in fear. It was at times like this that he remembered that Pansy knew just as much about the Dark Arts as he did.
As he left class, he spotted a familiar platinum blond head bobbing along the corridor ahead of him. His heart sped up, and he hurried forward, intending just to do it. He had nearly reached Draco when suddenly, a slight figure cut in front of him and began to talk to the boy.
"Harry! Harry Potter! Why are you here at the Ministry? Have you come to ask for the position of Auror?"
Draco could not believe what he was hearing. "First, how shallow do you think I am? Second, how desperate do you think I am? And third, how much of an idiot do you think you are?"
Alina immediately assured him that she would be glad to speak with him at dinner, and she expressed concern over his headache, saying she would check on him in a few hours. After opening the window, she left, and Draco waited a few more minutes to make sure she wasn't going to come in again.
Ginny gave him a serious look. "Did you and this guy do anything?" She asked. Harry nodded. "We, er, we...we kissed." He finally admitted. Understanding flitted across her face.
"Malfoy, I spent days wondering whether I was going the right thing. And in the end, all I did was tell the truth. No more, no less. And everyone deserves the truth. It was not I that saved you from Azkaban. I just brought to light certain facts that were not publicly known, and that was enough to convince the jury that you ultimately deserved your freedom."
Afterward, he made his way to Care of Magical Creatures, taught by that oaf, Hagrid. The air was still warm with the fading summer light. Draco despised winter. It was far too cold, and the snow only made him look paler. At least autumn was bearable.
Harry looked around at his friends, peacefully comingling with his boyfriend and his friends, even though they had been at each other's throats for years, and thought back to McGonagall's speech at the beginning of the year. They indeed were paragons of house unity, and Harry felt indescribably proud.
Harry washed himself off, cleaning away the evidence of his actions. He turned off the water and groped for his towel, grabbing it and drying himself off. He wrapped the towel around his waist and shoved his glasses back on. Of course, he had forgotten his clothes again, so he walked out to retrieve them.
"What's wrong, Harry?" Even his voice had become rougher. Harry backed away. It was all too fast. He wasn't ready for this. He had only discovered his attraction to men a week ago, it was too soon to start doing things. He hadn't even gone that far with girls, he definitely wasn't ready to go there with guys. So, in a very un-Gryffindorish move, Harry ran away.
"Ouch!" Potter said indignantly, but at least he stopped laughing. Draco turned his nose up. "You're just jealous that I can breathe fire and fly. What can you do, Rudolph?"
Zabini just chuckled, saying something that sounded suspiciously like, "You would like that, wouldn't you?" But thankfully, he also moved away. Still, it wasn't enough, because Malfoy's arm continued to press against his. And the electric shocks were still dancing all along his arm. He ended up sitting like that for nearly half an hour, the tingling getting stronger every second. He was about to jump up and make a run for it when Hermione finally made some excuse about needing to get back to do homework and mercifully allowed Harry to escape. He almost did jump out of his seat, pointedly not looking at Malfoy, and walked quickly out of the pub. They made their way up to the castle.
Harry had only seen it once from the eyes of a reindeer, but Draco's dragon form was a sight to behold. Though he had teased him at the time, Draco's animagus was an elegantly fierce creature, full of majesty and deadly weapons. But, the creature was small, only the size of a baby dragon, even though Draco was technically an adult. If he had transformed, the mirror easily could have slipped off his neck to the ground. The rules of keeping clothing versus accessories in animagus transformation was a complex and under-researched topic, but Draco might have accidentally left the necklace behind.
A rush of rage prompted him to launch himself at Draco, who suddenly looked very worried and slightly terrified. Draco held his hands up in surrender, but that didn't stop Harry from pinning him to the wall. Harry's forearm was pushed against Draco's throat, his other hand pointing his wand at Draco's face. Draco didn't even struggle.
"Wait, Harry. I'm sorry, it's really none of my business, especially if I'm not involved, as you seem so eager to make clear." He looked slightly amused. "I suppose it's fine, then. Avoid me all you like, until you've sorted yourself out. I won't lie and say I'm entirely fine with it, because as your friend, I'm not. But if this is what you need, then I'm willing to wait." Draco finished gently, smiling at Harry in a way that was entirely unfair because of how much it made him want to hug the other boy.
Draco turned around in his seat and immediately saw Potter with his arm around the Weaslette. He tore his gaze away and knocked back his second drink. After a couple more rounds, with Pansy getting more and more concerned after each one, Draco was finally, blessedly drunk. He stumbled away from the bar, heading over to someone he thought looked like Blaise.
Sometime during Pansy's speech, Blaise had sat down and, quickly catching on, proceeded to ignore Pansy and Draco. He, too, looked far nicer than usual, so much so that Draco eventually asked whom he was planning on going to Hogsmeade with and if they happened to be a certain Gryffindor boy whose name began with "L" and ended with "ongbottom."
Hadn't Malfoy said that in the forest that day? And Harry remembered that he looked truly regretful at that moment. So did Malfoy think that his actions deserved punishment? Did he think that the student's actions were justified? Harry resolved to find out. Because whatever mistakes Malfoy had made, they were just that: mistakes. Malfoy regretted his actions, and that was enough for Harry. Besides, if they started attacking the former Death Eaters, then they would be no better then the monsters that terrorized them during the war. He vaguely recalled something McGonagall had said during the welcome speech about how outcasts always held grudges. And that was why Harry had seen fit to defend two out of three Malfoys. In addition to all of that 'doing the right thing' stuff.
I presume you've heard of Draco's disappearance. If not, then I'm sorry you hadn't been notified until now, but Draco vanished by means of a touch-activated Portkey at breakfast. I managed to locate the place he was held (long story short, I followed an owl), but he was already gone.
He looked up at Draco. "Animagus?" He asked to confirm. Draco nodded, looking slightly pissed. "Why? I mean, you could do this after school, why waste your nights on this now-?" Harry asked, confused as to why in Merlin's name this warranted such a significant loss of sleep. Especially considering how tired the boy looked. Dark bags lingered under his eyes, and he looked utterly exhausted.
Harry shifted. "Well I liked the snogging bit but the...other part...was too much too soon, I think." Hermione looked thoughtful. Ron still looked shocked. Harry glanced at him. "I thought you said you wouldn't be surprised if we were shagging?" He asked his friend. Ron shook his head in disbelief. "I know mate, but accepting it when it's not actually happening is a lot easier." He shrugged. Harry turned back to Hermione.
She glided to Draco and embraced him, holding him like he was still a small child. "My darling, you mustn't do that again," she chided him gently. "You cannot imagine how much I despaired of your absence."
Draco started. When had his mother had time to save the Chosen One? And why hadn't she told him? Why hadn't anyone told him? It should have been big news.
"Thank you," he finally said quietly. Harry just smiled at him softly. After a moment, confusion flitted across the other boy's face. "Why do I have my arms around you? I clearly remember going to sleep back to back." He said uncertainty. Harry snickered. "Can't keep your hands off me even asleep, Malfoy? Though I must say, they certainly kept my nightmares away. Thanks for that." Harry ended seriously.
The man did not take much notice of him, however. He turned and led them to the side, where a dark hallway was barely visible. At the very end, two doors waited for them; they went through the one on the right. Surprisingly, it was pleasant; there was a table set for two, and the light was dimmed to a cozy setting. It was clean, unadorned, and private - perfect for them.
Harry chuckled. "You two would be great friends," he informed the blond, beaming. Draco scoffed at the idea but secretly thought Granger wouldn't be so bad. It was the Weasel he had to watch out for.
The Horgwallow was a disgusting creature, somehow scaly and covered in bristles at the same time. It had a long snout, with nostrils that were dripping with some unidentified goo. Draco was not eager to find out what it was. It had a long, curved tail with small nubs on it. Draco shuddered. Then, the creature opened its ridiculously tiny mouth and wailed loudly.
Only moments later, Pansy hurried in and dropped down beside him, out of breath and looking harried.
Draco relaxed slightly, and that was enough. Harry knew nothing would completely take away his concerns. Draco had always been more worried about others' perceptions of him than Harry had ever been. Harry entwined the fingers of his right hand with Draco's left. "Scared, Malfoy?" He asked to relieve the tension further.
The trio made their way to their next class, Herbology. Thankfully, Professor Sprout gave them the simple task of calming down the Fluttermy plants. It was easy, but since the timid little shoots needed a lot of coaxing, it didn't allow for much conversation.
"I think I'd rather tell your mom in person," Harry admitted. "She'll probably want to hear it directly from you, not in a letter," he added.
Draco shifted, bringing his left arm up from around Harry's waist and moving his head to rest in the back of Harry's neck. His hand was now resting on the pillow, in front of Harry's face, and his forearm rested on the bed. It was almost a protective stance - like he was caging Harry in to keep him safe from harm. With a jolt, Harry recognized the edge of the Dark Mark peeking out from under Draco's arm. With hesitant fingers, he reached out and brushed it gently. The moment he touched it, Draco jerked behind him.
The girl was looking at Draco intently. "Mr. Paul," she said suddenly, "I think you should let it go. If it's a baby, its mommy might be looking for it, and she's going to be much, much bigger. If she comes here, that'll be super dangerous!" Both of the adults looked at the girl in surprise.
Potter was sitting quietly, playing with another empty vial. When he saw Draco was finished, he shot him another smile. Draco gave him a small smile back.
"You're one to talk," Draco snapped at him. "Since when do you ever take the safe, easy, non-rule-breaking route?"
Harry sat in his usual place in the Great Hall. He wondered why Draco had decided to stay back in Transfiguration, but that was pushed aside as he started to eat. Hermione and Ron were chatting about a new store in Hogsmeade, but Harry didn't feel like joining in.
Draco thought about it. Did he mind that the whole world would know soon enough that he was dating the Savior of the Wizarding World?
"Maria..." he warned. But Draco had no intention of hurting Maria or her child. He didn't much want to hurt Paul either, to be honest. He just needed to give a bit of a warning to discourage them from taking him to this Jack character. This time, he shot fire slightly to the left of Paul, then bared his teeth in a challenge.
Draco sensed that it might be easier to escape if he stayed on Alina's good side. If she didn't see it as a kidnapping, maybe she would be open to letting him out of this room eventually, and from there, he might be able to get away.
Harry and Ron shared delighted looks. No longer could Snape take points from Gryffindors for the most ridiculous of reasons. It was a dream come true.
"So you had him to yourself for an entire morning and afternoon, and you wasted it sleeping. Honestly, Draco, it's like you're not even trying to seduce him." Pansy scolded.
"Nothing," Draco said, and his fingers twitched imperceptibly. Harry narrowed his eyes. He hadn't even talked to Draco since the previous day, what could have gone wrong in such a small amount of time? Luckily, Parkinson pursued the matter for him: "You know you'll feel better if you tell me. I can assure you that you're simply overthinking the matter, whatever it is."
Harry wasn't exactly pleased with their plans. They would spend Christmas Day at the Manor, and Boxing Day and the rest of the holidays at the Weasley's. But, they would be apart for all the days prior, and that was the part that didn't sit well with Harry. Ever since The Incident, he didn't like to be apart from Draco for long. A couple of hours was okay, but after too long, he became restless and needed to check that Draco was alright. He knew he was clingy, but he couldn't help worrying. It would be par for the course for his life if Draco were to disappear again.
Draco sneered. Trust Potter to rush into a possibly dangerous situation without a plan. It was no small wonder that he was still alive. But then again, Draco didn't exactly have any better ideas.
"I-" Draco was speechless. This perfect, perfect man loved him, and that was almost inconceivable. So, he didn't think. He kissed Harry, letting the action say more than he had the ability to.
"That's not nearly enough to make you blush," he declared. His eyes became calculating. "How about we make a deal? If you tell me what happened in that dream, I'll mimic it now."
Walking carefully together so that their joined hands were less visible, they made their way onto the chilly grounds in comfortable quiet. Eventually, they reached a willow tree, much like what the Whomping Willow would have been like without its notorious enchantment. It was the perfect spot - the branches hung low enough and were thick enough that no one would be able to see them unless they walked right up to them. They sat down next to each other, leaning back on the sturdy, rough trunk of the tree.
After lunch, Harry and his friends made their way up to the Defense classroom. The new teacher was an old witch named Professor Magworst. And her name said it all. She was the worst. Though Umbridge would always hold the special title of "Worst DADA teacher ever," Magworst was a close second. Or third, because Harry had nearly forgotten Lockhart. Anyways, Magworst spent the entire first lesson going over spells and facts they had learned in 6th year with Snape. And she frequently mixed up her information. Harry was incredulous when she said that boggarts suck out your souls, and dementors turn into your happiest thoughts. He was disappointed that they had yet another useless teacher, but he supposed there was really not much anyone could teach him about defeating dark wizards at this point. Still, he hoped that Dumbledore's Army wouldn't make a comeback. He wanted a nice, peaceful year, and teaching the DA was anything but.
Potter still had not looked at him once. He waited for a beat and then began. "Draco Malfoy never wanted to kill Dumbledore. He had no choice. It was either kill Dumbledore or have his family killed. Thus, Malfoy never put any real effort into his attempts to kill Dumbledore. Each one had some chance of going wrong, and each attempt did fail. Only the plan he worked on for the entire year succeeded, but only because he could not avoid working on it. He had to succeed because otherwise his family would have been killed." How did Potter know all that? How had he known that Draco had done everything he possibly could to make sure his own plans had failed without raising suspicion? How could Potter possibly know?
Draco mercifully leaned back, and Harry was treated to the wonderful sight of a flushed Draco. His eyes were locked on Harry's mouth, and he could feel another shiver race up his spine.
"Harry," he whispered, reminding Harry an awful lot of what he had dreamt of only a few nights prior. Harry flushed immediately, eyes dropping to look at Malfoy's lips. He wondered what it would be like to kiss him for real. He wrenched his eyes away, and they locked back onto Malfoy's gaze at once. His pupils were dilated, and Harry realized that his breathing had also become quite fast. Malfoy's hand was still caressing his cheek.
"You want to know something else?" Draco leaned in to whisper to the bird conspiratorially. "I don't like magic anymore. I wish I were a muggle, sometimes." He straighted, suddenly realizing that everything was a million times harder while inebriated. He was even seeing things, now. The bird's eyes were glowing brighter than before, almost like the sun shining through amber rather than candlelight. Maybe it was time to stop with the drinks.
"Draco," Harry breathed, and then he was striding over and engulfing him in the warmest, coziest, most wonderful hug Draco had ever had, squeezing him so tight it was near uncomfortable, but at the same time, perfect. Draco rubbed his back, reveling in the love he felt radiating from his boyfriend.
"Draco, I-" Harry didn't know how to finish that, or why he had started in the first place. Harry, not unwillingly, felt his eyes drawn to Draco's lips and stared at the perfection of them. He recalled, very vividly, how soft they had felt against his own.
He turned on the water, sticking his hand underneath to test the temperature. When it was pleasantly warm, he stripped and stepped under the pounding spray. He sighed as the warm water ran over his body, soothing his muscles. He took his time washing his hair, hoping his problem would go away. When it didn't, he quickly used soap to clean his body so he could take care of it faster.
Harry swooped through the air, circling the pitch out of habit. He laughed, suddenly exhilarated, and flawlessly executed a couple of feints and loops. Suddenly eager to beat Draco, Harry looked around for a flash of gold. There! But, no, that wasn't the Snitch, that was the sun glinting off of Draco's obscenely blonde hair. It wasn't fair how confusingly similar in color it was to the fluttering golden sphere. Harry dragged his eyes away and scanned the pitch once more. Only seconds later, he was distracted yet again by Draco's hair. He pulled his eyes away and tried to concentrate.
"Looks great, Harry!" Hermione exclaimed, tucking in. Ron did the same, but with less words and more enthusiastic noises. Draco smiled and ate like the proper, mannered, slightly pretentious man he was.
Harry turned to the page in his potions book. He looked over the ingredients list. Most of it was generic potions ingredients, but some things - toenails of an ogre, werewolf's hair, and pickled newt's tails - were a bit stranger. Harry got up to go to the ingredients cupboard, but a hand snaked around his wrist and tugged him back down.
Draco was still gaping at him. "Animagi?" He asked weakly. Harry nodded. "Unregistered, of course. Sirius was a big, black dog, kind of like the Grim. I kept seeing him during third year, and it made me think I was going to die soon. My dad was a stag, which is probably why that's my Patronus, and why a reindeer is my animagus. And Wormtail..." Harry couldn't stop his face from grimacing. "He was a rat. Ron's rat actually, for about thirteen years while he was in hiding. That's how he escaped when Sirius went after him."
Hermione gave him a look, but only said, "Harry, if you want to make it to the trial on time, you'd better leave now." Harry quickly glanced at the clock. Merlin, he was going to be late! Lucius' trial was sure to be over soon, but he never had any intention of going to that, so he wasn't disappointed. But if he wanted to get to Narcissa's trial, he would have to leave. He jumped off the bed, then turned to the mirror. "Merlin, Hermione, I look like the Ford Angela ran over me (Ron turned red). I can't go to the trial looking like this! But I need to leave..." Harry dithered, debating the merits of changing into something better, even though it would take a while. Hermione rolled her eyes. "Honestly, Harry, have you forgotten that you're a wizard?" She flicked her wand, muttered an incantation, and soon formal robes had replaced his rumpled muggle clothes. "Thanks, 'Mione," he said sheepishly and turned to leave.
