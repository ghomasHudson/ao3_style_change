“I need options,” Draco sniffed. The leaden terror in his chest lifted, both from the banter and from the sunlight pouring in — they were near the entrance.
“Too much to do,” Harry said. “Want to sit?”
Harry wasn’t sure who, though the Ministry nowadays resembled not so much a sieve as a broken roof. Half the employees were on the take, or at least had uncomfortably close relationships with the criminals in this city. It was understandable, but Harry didn’t like the idea of someone he worked with being untrustworthy.
“You were caught in the middle of the ward of St. Mungo’s!”
They did not sound cowed as they answered. ‘You can try, but we don’t have the answer. That’s why we need you. And you aren’t strong enough to do that.’
“I’ll return it tomorrow,” Potter said. He didn’t sound a bit disconcerted by Blaise’s flirtation, and a little jealous bubble popped in me.
When none was forthcoming, I grinned at him. “It’s not particularly interesting. Just a bunch of cousins marrying each other. But that’s why I kept it to only the ones who married into known Slytherin blood.  More and we would be looking at years of research.”
It was a trope of fiction that clandestine criminal meetings always occurred in dark alleyways or shaded corners. Draco always thought that was rather silly and overdramatic.
“Then should we return to the master?” Wormtail asked timidly. “After all, there really is nothing for us to do there.”
Now I could feel Potter scowl. “Definitely not.” His voice lowered. “I really like this garden. It’s peaceful. I miss seeing the stars. I don’t think I ever looked at them after I passed Astronomy.”
Dolohov smiled at Draco. It was more chilling than any threat. “I suppose you won’t have the opportunity to repeat the information to anyone.” He glanced at Harry. “You or your friend.”
Tap into the traffic cam eyes, Harry told Hedwig. Can you filter the visuals from them with the info from the Auror database? Match facial recognition with the license plates.
It didn’t look like any sort of memory I was familiar with. It looked — old. It was not the typical silver color, being dark in shade and more viscous, with the consistency of syrup. I conjured a bottle and drew the liquid that formed from the book-key in. It was warm to the touch.
“I cannot do so unaided,” Hedwig said. For a computer, she sounded remarkably touchy. “I would need more energy than what my mini-generators provide me with to run the matches that could break through. It’s a very difficult encryption.”
He turned his eyes on Draco. They were remarkably keen despite being red and bloodshot. Draco felt a chill of doubt. Had he underestimated Fletcher? Or overestimated himself? Draco didn’t believe in false modesty: he knew he could be appealing with his good looks. It might still not be enough.
Heat pooled in the bottom of my stomach. “Should we move this into the bedroom?”
He gave me a rueful look, falling out of his sharp focus for a moment. “Besides, I know you can defend yourself.”
He looked at me and smiled. ‘You’re right, my lord,’ he replied to that man. ‘Draco came in just at the right time.’ My father took me in the arms and led me to this chamber where it was all black glass and metal.” Malfoy played with the palmtop. “It was a lab for biomechanical components, I know now. I was strapped to this table and then I felt a prick of the syringe.”
I didn’t promise McLaggen anything, Harry thought back to Hedwig. It was giving him a headache to use the neural connection. Out loud, he said, “I only told him he was welcome to look at it once I file the report.”
“Oh, a photo op to show that he was involved somehow in such a dramatic scene at one of London’s premier buildings,” Harry said. “How were things on your end?”
I amused him and my mother with details of the play for the next few minutes. My father’s face remained mottled, but he mercifully kept quiet. When I finished, my mother smoothly took over the conversation. I was never more grateful for her mastery of social niceties.
Then the flames were gone. Darkness suddenly took over the cave again to eyes used to blinding blue, and the unexpected disappearance of the heat made me shiver. But the way was clear.
This is an emergency, Harry said. This could be the biggest drug bust in London this year.
“He’s the librarian from the Gringotts Reading Room,” I told Potter. “He attacked me this afternoon, trying to find out what I knew about the Grimoire.”
“How may I help you, Mr. Malfoy?” he asked, after they were seated and the aperitifs poured. “I understand you’re looking to procure a very specific piece.”
Luna smiled. “I always knew you would be the one to find it. Call it a woman’s intuition. It’s because you have Salazar Slytherin’s blood, right?”
“Well,” Theo said, “if it’s made to the order of Aristotle, then it might be that the artisan who crafted it had access to much more resources than your average metalworker.”
“It’s going to delay us even more,” Harry said. Despite the brisk tone, he sounded sheepish. “I — ah — took a different turn.”
“How much longer do we have to stay here?” Draco whispered.
“I have a blanket in the car,” Harry said. “You can go grab it.”
“Stay behind Potter, Draco.” My father rose from his seat. His wand was out, pointed at Cross. “And you, Cross, I think it’s time to go.”
He bent down to pick it up.
“Absolutely not.” My father’s face was thunderous. “One time was bad enough. We can’t make this a regular occurrence.”
Harry swerved, causing several other cars to honk angrily at him. “By going in person.”
“Yes, not long ago,” Draco said. “What’s this about?”
“Could it be related to his work as an Unspeakable?” Finnegan asked. “Because in that case, we would need to be careful. We don’t want to tread on another department’s territory.”
The drugs are only an exacerbating symptom. The root cause of the problem, the underlying social conditions, is still present. It is not something that a simple drug bust, no matter how big, can solve.
I moved my legs gingerly. I was wobbly but unharmed. I debated chasing after the librarian, but he had no doubt disappeared by now. In any case, Gringotts security were arriving: goblins with wickedly sharp axes and wizards in the gold livery appeared with their wands out. They surrounded me with unpleasant looks.
“Potter, why are you prying into matters that don’t concern you? I only showed it to you to demonstrate that I’m not completely theorizing, if you can call someone with multiple doctorates in the subject theorizing in this bad.”
I waved my wand to summon the family Bible. I could start by investigating my family ties with Slytherin. Then, hopefully, find the household accounts around that time to track the expenses and the journals to see if there were any references to the Grimoire –
I sat across from him. “Thanks for letting me borrow them. I’ll return them pressed and laundered when —“ I gave a careless wave, “ — all this is finished.” The shirt smelled faintly of the scent I had begun to associate with Potter too, a mix of sweat and his body wash.
“Are you alright?” His voice was gentle, coming like a balm after my memories. “What happened?”
It was nighttime when we reached Godric’s Hollow, having dawdled at the lake for longer than expected, too caught up in each other’s presence to pay much attention to the time. We got … distracted.
“Alright? You’re not going to tell me I’m just going to be in the way, or that you think I’ll spoil things?”
“Harry, are you sure you want to bring others into this?”
I tried to push through the pain, my teeth gritting as I reached for my wand.
There was a nasty gash on Harry’s arm and Finnegan’s face was bruised, with an impressive shiner of a black eye. They came out silhouetted against a swirl of sand and flames, battered – but victorious.
Harry continued on, his footfalls echoing loudly. It was quiet; typically, the building bustled with activity, with couriers and drones running up and down on their errands. At this time in the night, however, few were in. Most were either sleeping peacefully at home or out on patrol. Pity his luck that Harry was in right now. He took off his spectacles and rubbed his eyes.
“In that case, I’ll have a back up team sent up to –”
Other than the training sessions with Potter and the calls from his friends, I occupied my time with exploring the house. As I had said to Potter, this house really was fascinating. The library had oddities and curios gathered from the centuries of Black explorers. The book themselves were more of a letdown. I had ventured there for research, and mostly I found pulp novels from the Victorian era and outdated spell books. The magical encyclopedias were several editions behind, evidently being purchased before the Self-Updating Charm was invented. I amused myself by reading some of the ridiculously romanticized – and highly inaccurate – accounts of the Goblin Wars.
Even that glimpse of his face – it was enough for me to judge artistic depictions of him throughout the age. I could think of several popular historians and novelists that I could put out business right now.
And now that Draco had seen Harry in action, he could understand the appeal of a man in uniform. Not just the aesthetics of it – Draco had always known the attraction of that. It was the controlled power with which Harry moved, how he took down those men, that lit an ember smoldering since the dawn of time.
“Hello Draco,” he said, turning to me. “It’s been a while. I haven’t seen you since the Magical Historical Society’s Awards. I understand you’ve engaged in a new research project.” His eyes glittered menacingly. “And with Mr. Potter, the savior of our world, no less.”
“No, sir. Only they seemed mighty posh and they looked as if they might be important.”
“How did you realize?” I couldn’t help asking. I poured myself another glass and waited for Potter’s story.
I nodded. We sat facing her at the enormous claw-foot desk, the portrait of Dumbledore snoring behind McGonagall, though occasionally I thought I caught a wink from him. Next to it, in a place of similar prominence, was Snape. Unlike the other portraits, he was not – or did not pretend to be – asleep, eyeing us with hawk-like eyes as he listened in on our conversation.
“Can’t be showing up for your big celebration without your approval,” he said. “Are you ready to go?”
“I’m an English aristocrat,” Draco interrupted. “Of course I can ride and shoot. I played polo for a summer if you’re listing my attributes.”
God, the man’s mouth – Harry didn’t know if it was because he had been celibate for overly long or because Malfoy was experienced, but – Harry moaned.
“Yes, yes,” Potter said hastily. “Well -- since we kissed.”
“Night lights,” I said to the air, and a soft glow lit my room. Blaise was already lying on my bed in his undershirt, his robes already a heap on my floor.
Harry sighed inwardly. McLaggen was in a pugnacious mood, it seemed, and didn’t appear like he was planning to let Harry leave peacefully.
“We’re throwing in your freedom,” Harry said. “All of this -- you’ll be in prison for twenty years, if not more.”
“Really?” That seemed rather haphazard, and these were all just offices. “Are you sure? How long do you think we need to search for it? There could be dozens of hiding places.”
It was safe.
“Oh.” Harry relaxed and continued arranging the flowers. “I think you should stay a bit longer. After all, you heard him. Might be years before the curse’ effect kicks in.”
“I suppose it’s my way of dealing with it,” I said, after I took a sip. “Learning about the history was my way to understand what I had just been through, help me process the experience in a detached and empirical way. Or so that was my reasoning.”
“While I’m undeniably happy about your achievement, did you have to do it in so obvious a fashion? I’ve had several complaints already about their nerves being jolted out of them when you ran that hovercar into the Opera House.”
Ron nodded reluctantly.
“It’s both of your fault,” Theo said with exasperation. He glared at both of them. “If you had been upfront with me, I would’ve been better prepared and we wouldn’t have been taken off guard. Are you going to tell me what this is about now?”
“Yes,” I said. “Also, it probably appealed to Slytherin’s sense of irony, putting his Grimoire so close to his enemy’s home.”
Granger nodded. “I’ll look into it. Anything else?”
We followed each other out, biding my parents goodnight as we parted. I led Potter to the gardens through the double French door. It hit with a breeze of fresh air after being inside for so long.
“Does this mean it’s a working dinner?”
“I might need to borrow a change of clothes,” Draco said. “My apologies for the disturbance.”
“When I get out….”
Cleaning himself with a dirty rag he found in the corner of the room, Draco felt bereft. Instead of the relaxed lightness of post-coital release, he was drained. He and Harry were done. Over. That chapter had not been closed as it was slammed shut. Even if they could be civil again, Draco doubted they would ever recover the same level of intimacy.
“They’ll put you through a training course, most likely. I think the reason why they didn’t do it during this raid was because of the need for secrecy. But ordinarily, anyone who has a remote chance of being out on the field needs go to through it.”
It was the newest model of the hoverbikes that law enforcement and gangsters emphasizing speed favored. Nicknamed brooms because of the resemblance, it only had a single engine capable of vertical and short take-off and landing, an uncomfortable seat, and nothing else. They were tricky to fly and difficult to control – Harry had taken to it like a bird to flight. It was one of the few vehicles that SIs were unable to pilot, requiring human instinct and creativity that computers so far have been unable to emulate.
“Malfoy –”
“There’s still a Deputy Head in the line of succession before me, sir,” Harry said, disliking how Fudge’s statement will only fuel more speculation and interoffice rivalry between him and McLaggen, the aforementioned Deputy Head.
I hit the hardwood floor of my flat. Picking myself up with a grimace – my entire body screamed at me – I checked quickly if the stranger had followed me. I held my wand up, ready for an imminent attack.
Hedwig, what happened? Did it not go through?
“Ahh … sorry about that, Commander Potter,” Goyle said, his body swaying. “I know you lot don’t drink. Aurors are so boring.”
I should work more at home. I paid enough, certainly. I should try to enjoy some of its amenities, I thought, as I set my bag on the settee and went into the kitchen to brew more coffee. With a flick of my wand, the lights came on and soft Mozart began playing in the background.
He looked much more likeable that way.
“That’s why I think you should go to Harry for help.”
There was no chance of me knowing a counterspell, and even if I did by chance knew it, I lacked the magical strength to perform it. Even with Harry here helping me would not be enough.
A soft pop sounded as a decrepit house-elf materialized, wearing a filthy dishrag for a loincloth. He bowed low to Potter.
“Oh.” Somehow, that made me more nervous than when time Cross held me captive. “Will you be there?”
Draco lashed out. His roundhouse kick struck the shorter man squarely in the chest, sending the man sprawling to the ground. His elbow aimed at the taller one’s face – Draco had the satisfaction of feeling resistance give way and hearing a crunch.
“They seem to have a fascination with death,” Draco remarked. The chill in his chest seemed to gather despite his levity. “Death Eater … Thief of Death … All these aren’t very subtle, are they? And how are you tied up in this?”
“Do you know what you’re looking for?” Goyle asked. “Or where?”
“Sorry,” Harry said, surreptitiously shifting to hide his wand.
“That’s all?” Finnegan frowned. “Usually there’s more information. Useless information, but still, more than this.”
It smelled horribly fragrant, but they had no cover otherwise from which to observe any comings and goings. So far, they saw nothing, only a few construction workers and someone who looked like he might be the foreman leave.
Scientifically, there was little difference between unconscious and dead weight; Draco struggled to pull the man out of the corridor, finally managing to shove him unceremoniously in the corner.
“I’m glad you’re enjoying your stay,” Granger said as Potter disappeared upstairs. “I was worried that the prolonged isolation was taking its toll on you.”
Someone – a young man under the visored helmet by the looks of it – had relieved Harry of the duty to watch over Bellatrix.
“It’s kind of a creepy place, isn’t it,” Harry whispered to Draco. They stood in front of the columned structure. Draco wondered which ancestor had been mad for Neo-Palladian architecture.
He needed to do something. Sitting here and watching Harry being pummeled wasn’t an option – every strike landed harder than the one before. Harry bore it stoically, but for Draco – it ripped through him. He tried to avert his eyes, but sickening sight riveted him.
“We just came up to tell you we were leaving,” Granger said. She sounded even more amused than the last time she walked in on us. “We didn’t know where Draco was, so we came to find you. If we knew both of you were busy ….”
To his relief, Harry crept stealthily behind them, clapping one on the temples with the same trick Draco had witnessed back at the cave, and knocking the other out with a knife-hand strike. All of that took under less than half a minute.
Hm. I pursed my lips. “Well, I guess then we could use a spell or something to break the protective magic that’s encasing the memory.” I gestured towards the books. “Time to hit the books again.”
“We should talk about payment,” Potter said, snapping me back. His face was curious, almost as if he had also recalled the same memory.
Draco wasn’t referring just to the ride, but he thought Granger knew that.
“Then you’re bad at math,” Harry snapped. He rubbed his temples. “And then you come to HQ of all places. Really?”
Malfoy turned those slate-colored eyes on him. “Yes.” He cocked his head. “Scared of me yet, Potter?” There was a challenging smile on his face.
Harry was extremely solicitous in the days after my rescue from Cross’s house. Despite my insistence that there was no pain, and ill-effect, the Healers at St. Mungo’s insisted on keeping me in their ward for close examination.
“We have time,” Dolohov said finally. “And I’m sure our master will want to question you himself.”
“You’re so dramatic, Draco.” Harry laughed. “It isn’t that bad. Sometimes, you have to look past appearances and your own prejudices to see the good within.”
“We’re just friends,” I said, as we turned the corner leading to the Small Room. This passage had never felt so interminable as it had right now. “We tried dating, but we don’t work well together.”
And they would need to do so – this project with the Shield of Achilles had already taken too long. Riddle was not a young man; despite keeping himself fit through a strenuous physical regimen and a cocktail of experimental anti-aging treatments, Riddle’s body would not stand the test of time.
It began gently, questioningly, the exploration tender and unsure. Potter’s lips were chapped, I noticed. It did not detract from how good it felt.
“I’m ... fine....”
I wanted to ask more, but his body language signaled that this area of conversation was closed. Potter surprised me. So many assumptions that I had regarded with the inviolability of Holy Writ – demolished. With just a few words.
“Well, it doesn’t matter,” Harry said. “We need to return to HQ. No doubt Shacklebolt’s already heard about this now, judging by the way all those cams were there.”
Harry frowned. “What do you mean? Why would I want to keep anything out?”
Draco saw a tanned and freckled hand in front of his face.
He tried perusing it once again, searching for clues in Homer’s description in vain. Draco’s mind was too filled with Harry to concentrate. So this was where the man hand ended up. Draco still wasn’t entirely convinced the entire affair was a practical joke. Harry, a spy? Harry had never been able to conceal his emotions and thoughts. He practically shouted them. One could always tell – or hazard a fairly accurate guess – as to when he was upset.
“Specialis revelio,” I murmured. Nothing.
Potter scowled at me. I grinned at him in victory.
“I’m listening.”
Maybe they would assign someone to guard me until the threat’s passed. Maybe it would even be Potter.
“What the fuck were you thinking?” Draco demanded, struggling to his feet. He kept one eye on Greyback. “He could’ve killed you.”
“I’m not advocating Wizarding superiority anymore, Potter,” I said, more sharply than I intended, an uncomfortable reminder of shouting matches with my father. I dialed down my tone. “Sorry. Didn’t mean to snap. Besides, I live in London. You can’t live in London without interacting with Muggles in some way.”
“We’re particularly looking for outdoors entertainment,” I continued, gracing the lady with a beatific smile. She positively glowed in response. Harry watched next to me in grumpy silence. “I’ve been trying to get him spelunking. Might you know if there are any caves or such around here?”
He was strangely fussy about ties. Not so much that he cared which one he wore, but rather like a child who disliked being put by adults into formalwear. It took longer than I expected before he acquiesced to one.
“Want to do the honors?” I asked Potter. I didn’t look at him.
Draco’s pulse raced. Did he find it? It might sound like an average day for those unfamiliar with Lucius, but Draco understood his father well enough to know that Lucius would never front the money for anyone, not even his biggest clients. And this new investor … Draco checked the date in the stack which the sheaf came from.
I estimate that if you shower in under a minute, you should be able to get two hours worth of sleep in, Hedwig told him. I will formulate and compile the report that you promised McLaggen.
Harry wasn’t sure if Malfoy was making fun of him again. Eleven thousand galleons was an absolute fortune, when a ranking Ministry official earned perhaps three hundred per annum and a flat in the fashionable part of central London was three thousand.
Stunned into silence, Draco could only stare at Harry. He knew Harry was an orphan; indeed, it had been one of the main taunts Draco mocked Harry with during their public-school days. But –
“No, it’s alright,” Harry said. “I can wait outside. Draco here,” he gave Draco a wink, “can go first.”
“Where do you want to go for dinner?” Harry asked abruptly.
Cross shrugged. Somehow, that gesture conveyed more menace than any threat he might have uttered. “I’m sorry we got off on the wrong foot,” he said, with a small smile. “But I think I’ll be able to persuade you.”
Patience, the man counseled himself. There would be time enough to make the younger Malfoy suffer. But they needed him now. He was a tool; he could be tossed aside when his usefulness was ended.
“You must,” the man he was addressing said. “I am charging you to be the next Head of my House after I leave. You will ensure that my House, at least, remains pure.”
“It was the Circle,” I said. “They attacked us.”
“He wasn’t going to,” Draco said. His shoes scuffed the pavement. “I wouldn’t have let him.” Harry was making too big a deal. He should realize that Draco could take care of himself, especially with a small-time crook. That was what Fletcher was: not a cold-blooded killer like Dolohov or Bellatrix, but someone that jumped for scraps like a jackal.
Thankfully it was just the two of us in the hallway, this being a busy day and most still tied to their desks. I cringed to imagine how others react if they happened upon a former Death Eater with his wand raised at the Deputy Head of Magical Law Enforcement.
I debated taking the Tube. Leicester Square Station was right there, and it was only a few stops to Knightsbridge where I lived. But I needed the walk; I loved the crisp fall air, the slightly gloomy grey of the sky, the noise and bustle of the city. I strode past the elegant façade of the Ritz, taking the longer path along Piccadilly until the greenery of the parks came into view.
“I haven’t made up my mind yet,” he said. “And what of yours?”
Mrs. Weasley greeted Harry with a warm hug and Draco with a cold word. It was still much better than the rest of the family, with their pursed lips and narrowed eyes.
Harry chuckled. He poured himself another glass. The deep red liquid swirled against the crystal. “Same here. But how do you plan to go about this?”
“What’s the old fashion way?”
Even after so long, the scars were still raw, the wounds not fully closed.
A keening screech like nails clawing on a blackboard wailed throughout the room.  I stuffed my hands to my ears, trying to shut out it out as we retreated.
“Just stay behind me, Draco.” Harry sighed in exasperated defeat. “And don’t do anything stupid like charge at the enemy.”
She turned back to Potter, satisfied now that my father hadn’t said anything offensive that might have run me off.
There were more of them coming in.
It was only when the car exited out of city limits that Draco dared raise his head.
There was sheafs of paper rolled up and tied with a silk ribbon, with a note besides. Draco took the note.
‘That’s just a demonstration of the power we could offer you,’ he said as the Dark Lord stared in confusion. ‘So much knowledge has been lost to us and we’re only left with these petty tricks now. But if you help us, you can share in the power.’
“Harry,” Hermione said. “What did you get yourself mixed into? If we had known the identity of that buyer, we would have never –”
Harry always marveled at Hedwig’s processing power. Without it, his job would be difficult.
Harry shook himself mentally. That drink earlier must have been much stronger than he had anticipated. “I’ll call on you again if I need anything from you, Malfoy.”
“That’s only a starter Rolex,” Fletcher said. “The resale value on that –”
“Now that we’re alone, we can talk more openly,” Fletcher said, closing the door firmly. It was dark in the room. Draco could not distinguish any details except for the creaky wooden floorboards and a lamp that needed its bulb replaced. Draco groped around for a chair.
“You’re feistier than I thought,” Dolohov said, his madman’s glint flaring. “I like that.”
“Well,” Harry gave Draco a stern look. “I guess some things don’t change. I’ll go set up in the kitchen.”
I settled next to him. “Bring flowers next time you visit.” The water was cool and refreshing against my tongue after the bitterness of the wine. “You’ve only been here once, when I moved in.”
“What’s wrong?” He looked at me, startled. “Is it hurting you?”
Draco shivered at her words. Though he had no love for Fletcher, he could imagine what a ‘visit’ from Bellatrix meant.
Harry scowled. He took a deep breath, reminding himself to be patient.
I shimmied out of them in an inelegant manner, Harry’s hands attempting to unravel from the fabric as I kicked them off.
Harry froze.
“Shit.” Draco fell away as if burned. “Are you alright? I’m sorry, I didn’t think about that. It’s stupid of me, I know, but I was just too relieved to get out of that place –”
Belatedly, I noticed that the sun had touched the horizon. I hadn’t noticed, too caught up by this newfound question. My stomach made a rumble.
We stood there, watching each other. The air pulled taut as neither of us spoke.
Potter pushed in front of me. “I’m performing a citizen’s arrest under the Wizarding Crimes and Offenses Act of 1841. I suggest you come with me quietly or I would have to restrain you.”
“Ah. Sorry. I – you startled me, is all.” I tucked my wand away hastily and looked at her. She had grown into her looks now. No longer the bushy-haired know-it-all, Granger was severely elegant in her Ministry robes, her formerly bushy hair parked sleekly on the right. No wonder Weasel’s mad for her. “I didn’t hear you.”
“What is his job?” Harry asked. “Do we know?”
Nothing happened. I lowered my wand an inch. It would have alerted me to any other humans in the vicinity, though if they managed to break my protection spells, they might have also found a way to evade detection.
Harry grabbed Goyle’s arm. “I have what we came for. I need to get back to HQ and discuss this with Shacklebolt.”
“Not when I’m about to walk into the den of the lion,” Draco said. He checked around nervously. “What are we going to do?”
Draco didn’t know what to make of Harry bursting in like that. It was gratifying to see Harry, and Draco’s heart did a little skip. At the same time, it frustrated him to see his plans thrown in chaos.
I gave him a doubtful stare. “I’ll take your word for it.”
There was no irregularity noted in any of the systems except for one energy spike, Hedwig said. It wasn’t a big energy spike, but it was one deviation from the norm the building usually sees.
We arrived at the Manor in a flurry of movement. I quickly let go of Potter’s arm as we emerged from the grate.
“Your hair is fine,” Harry chuckled. His own shock of dark hair remained untamed as ever.
“Just an idea,” Granger said. She looked at the Weasley. “Well, we best get home. I think these two have lots to talk about.” The Weasley gave us a parting wink as they left the room.
Even more pressing than the man’s appearance was behind him, with guns pointed straight at Draco and Harry.
“If that’s true,” Shacklebolt said slowly, “then we need to prevent the Mors Morde from getting a hold of it. Mr. Malfoy, on behalf of Her Majesty, we would formally request that you assist in the recovery of this item. After our operative recovers the item, you’ll be responsible for verifying its authenticity. We can’t put a civilian out in the field, but we need an expert close by.”
“Draco. Mr. Potter.” He assessed us with cool eyes. “To what do I owe this … pleasure?” He sat in his chair, glaring at Potter as he did the same. I remained standing.
Draco jerked up. “The Shield’s a myth.”
“I might have found clues to where Slytherin’s Grimoire is located,” I said.
They ran.
“Best to not use your wand too openly,” Goyle said. “They’ll know you’re an Aboveworlder at a glance.”
“After our analysis, it appears that we do not have clearance to access the file,” the computer said.
“What?” There was a touch of impatience. “What other conditions have you thought of now?”
And by deepening our relationship, I could sense that I was slipping quicker into the hole. A hole which I was willing digging.
“Mundungus Fletcher? Pleased to meet you.” Draco shook the man’s hand.
“What kind of place is this?” Harry asked Goyle sharply. He couldn’t keep his eyes from sliding down one of the male dancers’ smooth oiled body. Exposed and on public stage? Harry –
I touched my wand to Potter’s chest. A rush of vertigo hit me. I fought the black spots in my vision as the spell’s effect took.
“Harry, look at me,” said Draco, when Harry continued to avoid Draco’s eyes.
“What if you run into Cross?” Potter said. His face was still stony, though I was equally determined to go, Potter’s approval or lack of be damned.
Impact.
“Ah.” I could not think of any appropriate response. I was still trying to digest the idea that Potter visited a sex club. The image of Potter in a leather harness with a whip in his hand … my mouth went dry.
“No, it’s true. My guardians weren’t the … fondest of me. Or of me being a wizard. They tried to pretend I wasn’t there most of the time, actually.”
“Yes, well –”
My throat stuck. He just so casually revealed such an abomination of magic and nature. “That’s – that’s disgusting. And you said ‘them’. Plural.”
As he smirked at me, I could not help noticing how good Blaise looked. Even in the dim lighting, he stood out. He always turned heads wherever he went. Even now, several eyes were on him in the pub. I wondered which one he might take home with tonight.
“You want my help because I’m good,” I said. “Not for some meek wallflower.”
“Yes — well — what do you want?”
Draco looked Riddle in the eye. “I am.”
“Where’d you learn to do that?” he asked as he came up to the body. He prodded it with the toe of his shoe. “He’s out cold.”
Riddle considered her in silence. “Thank you, Bellatrix,” he said at last. “Your report has been most edifying.”
“Don’t play with your food, Draco.” My father scowled. “You’re not a child anymore.”
There was a pull at my navel, not unlike the sensation of falling, and I was in that cave again. The walls shone with slick wetness, and there was a man in gray robes that reminded me of a monk’s habit laying an object on the pillar at the center.
I think I got tired of this story at the end, so it does feel a bit rushed to me. It was still pretty fun to write, though, and my favorite part especially was researching all the historical tidbits that I needed to write this.
Thanks, Harry responded dryly.
There was a faint itch in the back of my neck, as if I were being watched. I scratched at it. I was allowing my imagination to best me; it was the middle of the day. But when I reached my flat, I resolved to reinforce the wards and the protection spells –
“Draco!” Harry yelled.
“I wasn’t going to pry,” I protested. At her look, I sighed. “Alright, I was. But you can’t blame me.”
“You have duties as a Malfoy, and you’re letting your interests get in the way of fulfilling them. Now, your mother knows several eligible girls from good families. You need to come by the Manor sometime and meet them.”
“I thought that’s what soldiers do,” Draco replied, tensing a little at Harry’s tone, “to cope with the uncertainty.” He met Harry’s gaze.
I looked at my own glass. The clear white liquid touched the edge.
“You’re making a mistake,” Harry said in a low voice.
“It’s in one of my tooth,” Harry said. “I activate it by biting down. You don’t think I go into these situations completely unprepared, did you?”
I raised my wand. Light fell on the rough trail that led deeper into the darkness. “I hope mostly squirrels,” I said, though there was no conviction in my voice. The forest was old and abandoned, and I wondered why it was so clearly marked on a Muggle map. Perhaps we should have gone to stay at a Wizarding inn. The habitues there would have had more information on this clearly magical place.
“Ah.” Potter gestured for me to sit. I did, the cushions sinking beneath my weight. There was a burn hole. I fingered it idly. I didn’t look at Potter. It was not in my plan to divulge that bit of information. I had no idea how Potter would react – would he recoil a little? Would he look at me with new wariness? I thought of what happened earlier, how I had felt that shudder of attraction between us. I could have sworn I saw a hit of the same from him.
“Sorry. I got lost.”
Draco bit back his retort. It was only a t-shirt and jeans, the shirt hanging off him like a misshapen sack, and the hem of the jeans reaching past his shoes. Weasley was probably half a foot taller than Draco or Harry, and it showed in his clothes. Glowering, Draco tried his best to roll them so he wouldn’t trip.
She laughed at that. “Was that your attempt at being humble? It was horrible.”
A pause of surprise.
Draco breathed in deep, not bothering to conceal it anymore. Greyback’s eyes betrayed the suggestive enjoyment from Draco’s disgust and horror.
“Well, actually, I’d leave the keys in the ignition and you can drive back go Grimmauld Place,” Harry said. “But I suppose it’s better to keep you with me. Who knows if you’ll try to sneak in here after I go?”
“It’s the middle of the afternoon.”
In fact, Potter was probably a better catch. The hero of the Wizarding world, with his roguish good looks, and decently well-off, not to mention his innate kindness and charm. Ginerva Weasley was a fool to divorce him.
“Yes.”
“I thought you had discarded the idea of using the Malfoy boy,” Bellatrix said.
“What you did back there was the single most idiotic thing I have ever seen you do,” Harry said. “And that includes the entire time I’ve known you, including that time you provoked that falcon Buckbeak to attack back at school.”
I gave her a malevolent look. “Don’t be facetious. Those were expensive. Some were on loan.” Thank Merlin they only suffered cosmetic damage. “I have news to share.”
“And this is Draco Malfoy,” Fudge continued, acting as though he hadn’t heard a word of what Harry had said. “He’s a dear family friend.”
“Did it?”
The uniformed men who had arrived were unfortunately not Shacklebolt’s men, but armed response from the Metropolitan Police, who had arrived when summoned by a confused porter telling them the security system “was buggered.”
“Your hand’s cold,” Malfoy huffed. He bent down and took Harry’s hand, breathed on it. Harry saw spots.
“That’s a good idea,” Dolohov said pleasantly. He emerged from behind one of the dunes, shaking off bits of sand. “It’s a good thing I caught you here, Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Potter. Otherwise, I would have had to make a visit at the airbase and walking in with all those soldiers isn’t that conducive to conversation.”
Harry seemed to catch a bit of Draco’s mood. “Behave,” he chided.
Harry and Finnegan both stared.
“Alright!” I clapped my hand over his mouth. “Point taken. Merlin, you’re so literal sometimes.”
“I would think the Aurors would do anything to keep their golden boy,” I said. Potter’s story touched me. I sympathized with his feeling of restlessness and being trapped. How could I not?
“I don’t like this idea,” I said doubtfully. “All muddy and sweaty. I don’t like sweat.”
Did you memorize that? Harry asked Hedwig. In case Harry had to make a return trip, he didn’t relish relying on Goyle’s cooperation.
Draco gestured to Harry, trying to contain his excitement. Now was the time for careful precision, rather like making incisions during a surgery. One wrong move might break the device or scatter its parts into the four corners of the ocean.
“How’re you feeling?” Harry asked, setting down the flowers.
Draco wanted to beat his head against the wall. So goddamn close. There could be dozens of ‘safe places’. Lucius’s bank vaults, the safe in the study, the family vault in the Manor – Draco and Shacklebolt had already checked all of these. Nothing were out of the ordinary, and Draco did not recall seeing anything from anyone named Rosier.
Fudge was saved from replying by the man with the entrancing gray eyes.
He absorbed in the marble floor which our footfalls echoed slightly off of, the long hallway filled with portraits and busts of my ancestors, the velvet wallpapers and the intricately patterned moldings.
Worry displayed on the young private’s face. “We can send a team in after him, but all our available ones are on other missions right now, and the latest one of them will arrive back will be in half an hour. We have no men to go after him.”
“Harry –” What was Draco going to ask? Why Harry had returned the kiss when he gave no other indication that he even welcomed Draco’s attention? Or that question buried even deeper as a bone of contention: why did Harry leave in the first place?
He let out the yawn he had been holding back for a while.
Harry blushed. “We’re just –” he began.
Dawlish seemed about to say something nasty, but Shacklebolt shot him a warning look.
“Well, Granger recommended that I come to you since the Ministry won’t or can’t help. I guess you can track down whoever is after me while I research. I don’t know the details of how that’ll work, but I guess I was thinking along those lines when I came to you for help.”
He tapped his fingers on the plush velvet, rearranging the sheafs of papers once more. Harry had gone to work after helping him settle back into Grimmauld Place. Neither of them talked about what had happened last night, though they greeted each other with an ease that set Draco’s heart floating when they woke up legs tangled with each other’s.
“Harry. You’re calling me Harry now, remember?”
“I forget how these kinds of simulations look to you humans,” Hedwig said. “Let me see. Nothing. Except for that folio on the coffee table.”
My mirror grunted approvingly as I gave myself a final scrutiny. My hair was groomed, my robes freshly laundered and pressed, smelling faintly of lavender. I looked like a proper Malfoy; nothing to give my father ammunition for criticism.
“You sound like him,” she said. She put down her pint. “But it isn’t all bad, you know. I know we’ve all been through experiences that make us jaded, but life isn’t all that bad.”
Draco never heard from Harry again after that day at the Burrow. All of Draco’s calls had been ignored, and when Draco returned to his flat in London, all of Harry’s belongings had been cleared out. It was only much later, and from Ginny Weasley no less, that Draco learned Harry had departed on a tour in the Middle East.
“I’ve been thinking about this, Potter,” Malfoy murmured. “Since that day we met. Even though we don’t particularly like each other, I can tell you were thinking about me too, weren’t you?”
“I’ll call the staff to prepare, then.”
Blaise was regaling us with tales of his models’ ridiculous behavior and outrageous demands. He was a highly sought-after photographer now, after a successful stint as a model. I tuned in absentmindedly to a story of an up-and -coming model who demanded peacocks in his dressing room because they “were soothing to look at”. I stifled my snort. Peacocks soothing? Pah. Sounded much different from the ones I grew up with at the Manor. They were fiercely territorial; they used to chase me around the grounds when I was young until I called for the house-elves.
“I told you we should have scaled the building.”
The Shield glowed, rivaling the lamp. Not in its entirety; only specific segments of the Shield did. It was the sun, the moon, the Sagittarius, and the farmer. It was some sort of luminescent coating or quality of the metalwork that allowed them to do so. Draco wanted to lean in to see what exactly was at work, but the not unformidable presence of Riddle next to him made Draco reconsider.
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow. Even with that expression of cool disdain on his face, Malfoy was startlingly beautiful.
They moved in a steady rhythm, occasionally checking in with each other by way of hand signals.
“Duck!” he yelled, and with a kick, Harry pushed the driver’s body out and slipped himself in.
Harry followed Finnegan’s pointed finger.
Malfoy shook his head. “Unfortunately not. But Metis detected the signature of the weapon, and it had to be in the vicinity to be effective.” He drummed his fingers. “We can use that to trace the origin of the weapon, and hopefully find your assailant that way.”
Maybe if Harry hadn’t been promoted the way he did, then McLaggen wouldn’t view Harry as such a threat. But none of that had been in Harry’s control any more than it had been in McLaggen’s power to affect. Perhaps if he was a wiser man, McLaggen would recognize this.
“She is my sister, honey,” my mother said rather tartly. “I don’t see anything strange about that.”
“I’m not Slytherin’s heir,” I replied. “The Heir of Slytherin is dead. Died not very pleasantly too, I’m afraid.”
“Or a reunion for Death Eaters?” I couldn’t keep the bitterness out of my voice.
“You’ve an advanced magical degree and Hermione is the cleverest witch in our generation. With your collective brainpower, I’m certain you two will find a solution in no time.”
“I don’t doubt your good intentions,” Harry said. “None of us here do. It’s just – well – I got worried.”
I realized I was still on top of Potter. I hastily scrambled off. “Sorry.” It had been a comfortable position, and I was sorry I had to remove myself.
I was amused at myself. Usually, I would be very particular on the fine gradients of my concentration, afraid of the association of a former Death Eater with the Dark Arts. I suppose this was progress, of a sort, that I was no longer as concerned with others’ perception of me.
It was Cross.
“What?” Draco was angry now. “You thought that I was part of this too? Part of Riddle’s little gang?”
“I’m not sure.” I didn’t want to give an estimate and raise my hopes. “At this rate, it might be a couple of days at the very least.”
“Hopefully that’ll keep you awake until we get back home,” Draco said.
Understood.
The car appears to have the built-in control chip disabled, Hedwig said. She paused. Increasing likelihood of suspect car being the target to ninety-nine percent, she said.
“We have some questions to ask you, Father. About … our past.”
Harry had only reluctantly agreed that they should stay when Draco pushed.
Draco waved the offer away. Just that simple motion made him wince. “Just do the job on your end and get the bastards who did this. I’m going to keep looking into this.”
“No, no, we’re not under attack again,” I said, laughing. “I just had a breakthrough.”
“No.” A thousand scenarios raced through Draco’s head, each more worrisome than the last. “I guess we’ll figure it out somehow.”
I refrained from saying that Slytherin’s Grimoire had a much stronger historical basis than the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Her calm acceptance of my theory did boost my confidence, after all.
“How did you know where we were?” Potter asked.
He shot a glance at Harry from the corner of his eye. Harry’s profile, limned in soft silver and highlighted by the occasional plane, shone in the night. Harry’s eyes were shadowed in part, but his posture was more relaxed than earlier today.
“As long as you don’t ruin it, no. Now hurry up, we’re going to be late.”
“I will not,” Draco said, in a miffed tone. “I never do that.”
I shook my head. “I can do that.”
“Maybe you should move in with me,” Potter joked. “I’m awful at them. Ginny always had to recast them because mine stopped folding the clothes halfway or only got the dishes to rinse without soap.”
“You’ll get better after the training course,” Granger promised. “We make everyone who has the remote possibility of being in the field take it. And something tells me you’ll need it, especially since I’m placing you on the team focusing on dismantling the Circle.”
“You mean, what the description in the Iliad tells you?”
It wasn’t an exploratory kiss this time. This time, it was hot and urgent, with Harry flipping Malfoy onto his back as lips, teeth, tongue all became weapons in this duel for dominance.
“I’ll include you and the school’s assistance in my acknowledgements,” I said, giving McGonagall one of my winning smiles. “If I find anything of note.” If I survived this. “You can be sure of that.”
Harry came onto his side. His arse still smarted from their activity last night, and his back was scored with Malfoy’s nails. He touched his collarbone; there were areas that were sensitve, and Harry knew if he looked into the mirror, he would see vivid red marks.
I thumbed the bulge in his pants, grinned at him as he gave a little gasp. “So eager,” I whispered with wicked amusement. His right thigh rested intimately on top of mine, and I became vividly aware of fabric’s friction, barely noticeable, on my skin. “You should take off your clothes, too.”
The senses seemed heightened in the dark. His ears prickled with rushing sounds and his breath came out in slow huffs that released in bubbles by the mask. They had plenty of time; they had been down here for only half an hour at the most, but Draco knew looking for something so small in all this would rapidly consume the remainder.
“The way you’re proposing to get these items is more costly given the additional … barriers,” Fletcher said. “You do realize that, don’t you?”
“With your permission, we can have them collated and digitized for you to go over,” Shacklebolt said. “I’m guessing they aren’t that easy to analyze on your own.”
Hogwarts ... I haven’t returned there since the War. I wonder how it had weathered all these years. But there were a more important task to do.
My father arched one eyebrow. It was a skill I had never really mastered, despite practicing in the mirror for hours. When I did it, I always looked surprised than derisive.
But of course, it was the moment his mind regained its function, and he backed off Harry.
I thought about telling my friends what happened today – I doubt they would know much about magical manuscripts and enchanted books, but there was always a possibility. But a part of me stopped.
We both lifted our wands, illuminating the cave. Stone walls rose all around, slick and glistening with the damp, and covered with lichen and moss. There was nothing else, to my disappointment. Not the plinth I had seen in my vision, not even a crack that marred the smooth rockface around us.
“There was that sound … and pain.” Harry blinked. “What happened?”
“I’ve always been pale, Mother.”
“Ah.” That made more sense. I was surprised it didn’t make front page news, though likely both sides wanted to avoid a scandal. “I’m sorry you had to experience that. It couldn’t have been easy. That’s why you chose to strike out on your own, isn’t it?”
I woke up earlier than usual the next day, feeling a pleasant sort of laziness. I moved leisurely; there were no impending deadlines, no urgent need for me to be in a rush.
“So, Potter, how are things at the Ministry?” My father dropped his policy of ignoring Potter, now that I had not risen to any of his challenges. “Shacklebolt still carrying on with those soft policies of his?”
She nodded. “We’ll check him out. Now tell me about why you think you might have found Slytherin’s Grimoire.”
“I – how can you tell?” Harry asked. He had been careful to mimic the speech patterns and mannerism that Hedwig had observed and parsed.
“Then let us begin,” Riddle said with a soft smile.
“I have an idea,” Harry said. “But you need to trust me.”
Draco had been more careful this time. He contacted Fletcher by means of encrypted channels even more convoluted than plotting a revolt against the Queen, using payphone booths and unnamed post office boxes as well as the typical oblique references a stranger would never understand.
Draco let out a sigh. “I’m only doing this because you promised me good food.” He stared at his boyfriend. Harry still retained his roguish charm even out of uniform. In a plain pullover and jeans, he looked relaxed and at ease despite his earlier profession of being tired. Yet he still managed to cut a dashing figure; several of the festival attendees — including the old spinster who ran the tea shop where Draco and Harry had their lunch — watched him admiringly.
“I hope it’s not guard duty,” Harry mused. Those were never pleasant. Last month, Harry had somehow gotten stuck nursemaiding a visiting foreign dignitary who treated Harry like his personal assistant, and attempted to sneak off with a handful of the Crown Jewels from the Tower.
Careful to maintain one grip on the Firebolt’s handle, Harry reached for his holster. His fingers touched the cool chrome of his wand. He drew it out – and fired at the car.
Malfoy smiled, displaying sharp teeth. “We can’t let our Aurors just drop dead in the middle of the Underground, can we?”
“No.” Potter’s voice was firm. “I want to help.”
Nervous anticipation rose at the idea; I had no idea what I would face when I returned – for it did feel like a homecoming in a way.
The door opened even as I hastily sat up straight.
Draco didn’t roll his eyes, though it was a close call. “I think you know by now how stubborn I am.”
“Well, I’m glad you did. Though Hermione did tell me it’s a dangerous spell … I’m glad you didn’t suffer any ill effects.” He looked at me seriously. “I hate to see you hurt.”
In fact, the entire castle appeared recently constructed. I noticed that the some of the battlements were still incomplete, and the high tower was missing its usual height.
The outer door closed as soon as Harry walked in. It was a deceptively plain lobby, with scattered couches and no decorations on the walls. There was a smiling lady at the reception desk who greeted Harry pleasantly.
Malfoy chuckled. “My ego is telling me to respond ‘yes’ despite my better judgement. Very well, what do you want to find out?”
“You most likely gave it to Mr. Potter, didn’t you, Draco? He’ll come. If it’s a choice between your life and that, he’ll choose you.”
Harry broke the silence. “We’re not a talkative duo, are we?”
We didn’t talk. We did not need to.  We stood quietly, as the leaves blew at our feet. Faded words of encouragement and names were still visible on the statute. They had endured the passage of time, this testament to the human capacity to resist dark times.
I had seen them before in old newspapers and history books, but coming face to face with them … the man had the same untidy hair as Harry did, and the woman shared with Harry the same eyes. Somehow, the sculptor had the skill to imbue them with a maternal understanding that touched me.
“Mr. Potter, you need to come with Andromeda to visit me for tea sometime,” my mother said. In the intervening years after the war, she had gradually re-established her connections with her long-estranged sister, particularly now that the baleful influence of Aunt Bella was gone. I had yet to run into her, though I believed she also lived in London.
And Potter was not included.
Harry and Bellatrix had both ceased moving. They were both breathing heavily, each backing away, like two injured animals ready to go for a second round but unsure of the chances of success. Harry, Draco noted with relief and mangled pride, still retained his gun.
Gregory Goyle was a small-time crook that peddled wares between the world Above and the Underground. A nuisance, but not harmful, and his knowledge of the Underground would be useful in this case. There were scant information existing in the databases that Harry and Hedwig scoured. Besides, Harry was certain that it was a constantly shifting labyrinth down there. They needed someone who knew the territory.
Harry reminded himself that it was unseemly to vent irritation with software. “I know that,” he said, with every ounce of patience he had. “But I’m asking you to break the encryption, not determine whether we have clearance to access the file.”
“What?” Draco was confused by this non sequitur as he was by the coming headache. “What about them?”
Harry ran his eyes up and down Malfoy’s torso, drinking in the sight. His head was light, and he thought to pinch himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming.
I exhaled. “Fine.” I had not been alone with him since he was injured. The guilt gnawed at me, though both Granger and the Healers assured me that my quick actions saved his life and prevented any permanent injuries.
“Don’t think about it.” The guard tightened his grip as Greyback continued to rain blows on Harry. Draco stilled.
Shacklebolt turned to Draco. “My apologies for tonight, Mr. Malfoy. You have our sincerest regret that you were hurt. If you wish to file for any recompense, please let me know. I am sure Harry would also be happy to assist you.”
But they both knew that wasn’t true.
“They didn’t manage to take all of it. Only half of them.” A wearied exhale. “It’s the best we could do under the circumstance. We don’t have enough manpower to search the entire area or interdict any planes that might have taken Dolohov and the rest. We’ll just have to take what small victories we can.”
They all turned to look at him.
“Potter.”
“Branching out from Auror work,” he said lightly. Like me, he seemed to agree that the fewer knew about our true mission, the safer it was. “Besides, Draco here is paying exorbitantly for the pleasure of my company.”
I needed a Pensieve.
The implication was clear. And disgusted Draco.
Like clockwork, her team sprang into action, each taking up their positions – two besides the entrance, one behind Granger as she kicked in the door with a resounding crash. She made a gesture. They swarmed in, wands at the ready, looking for any signs of trouble.
Like timing from a bad comedy, Harry entered the room at that exact moment. My father glowered at him.
“He’s not going to suffer any permanent damage, is he?”
Draco hid his smile. This good cop, bad cop act was extremely effective. “Then shoot him if he tries to run. We don’t need him that bad.”
“Please. Have you seen me in a frock coat and breeches? I was almost an extra on one of those BBC remakes of some Austen novel they come out with periodically.”
“Well,” Harry said, “I just wanted to say thank you. For running in the way you did, even though it was idiotic. And thank you for being here, for being a part of this.”
Harry bowed and left. He supposed he was free to return home and sleep. By the looks of it, he might be able to get one or two hours still.
Then they walked. For at least ten minutes; with Fletcher guiding the way with furtive glances all around and Draco growing increasingly irritated as empty cabs passed them and his breath created icy puffs in the air.
“No,” the manager said. He led them to the flat and keyed in the code.
They went.
“Stay still.” Malfoy sat at the edge of the bed, with a palmtop in one hand. “I found you in time to prevent any lasting damage done, but you’re still weak and your body needs time to recover.”
“That’s the nature of facts,” Shacklebolt pointed out. “They fit the logic of a situation and explain what happened. You know as well as I that not everything is a conspiracy.”
“It’s not ‘just a book,’” I said with exaggerated patience. “It’s a book with spells used by one of the most powerful wizards in history. A book that contains all the magic he knew. You remember the Chamber of Secrets — the Grimoire probably has the secret of how to breed and control a basilisk. Along with so many of his secrets.”
“Yes,” Draco said, with a snap of finality. “I have to see this through. And I’m already here, dressed and ready to go. You don’t expect me to wait in the car for you, do you?”
I rolled my head back on his shoulder and relaxed against him. “It was.” I wanted to stay like this forever. Us holding each other, curled up against each other, staying still and never let go.
I knew I should stow it away, take it somewhere safe, but my fingers had minds of their own. I opened it.
“It’s been a while, my friend,” he said, thumping Draco on the back, the force of which might have knocked a lesser man to the ground. Draco didn’t flinch. “How are you? Are you treasure hunting now? Last I heard, you were working in an office at some posh auction house. And who’s this with you?”
It was starting to heat up. The chill retreated. Draco leaned forward, towards that fire which came from Harry. Draco’s good arm reached out, holding Harry’s in place. His thumb circled on the bicep, relishing the firmness of the musculature there.
“Yes.” It was sobering to realize. Draco wouldn’t be looking at some shards of pottery unearthed by accident that no one outside of a select circle cared about. The weight of his responsibility was almost physical.
I searched up the writer of that exposé in the Prophet’s directory. He had disappeared. Though I knew he could have simply decided that he wanted privacy or solitude, I had an inkling that was not the reason.
“There’s no point in delaying the decision,” I shrugged. “And besides, I’m just as curious to hear your terms. What is it you plan to offer me should I help you?”
Draco heard no response on the radio, but neither did any of the soldiers fired, either out of confusion or because they believed him. He didn’t have time to be grateful – he needed to reach Harry.
“Off you go, Finnegan,” Harry snapped, but there was no heat.
“Wait a minute,” Theo objected. “You can gamble your friend’s life like this, but not mine. I don’t know anything. I’m just a hired hand.” He shot a glare at Draco. “What the fuck have you gotten yourself involved in?”
“My teachers in school always thought I had an overactive imagination,” Draco said. “Try me.”
“We have a plan in place,” Cross continued. “I won’t share the details of which with you, of course. Not just yet. But rest assured that you and yours will have an honored place in our new world order.”
“Really?” Fletcher stood up, cutting across the already miniscule illumination. He moved next to Draco.
“My scans show no sign of anything,” Hedwig said.
Now I definitely felt it. A small shock ran up my arm. It went through me, the sensations much milder than my initial touch back at the Reading Room, but no less noticeable. My skin formed tiny goosebumps.
I could not respond to that. I was too numb to say anything, my head still spinning, my chest still pounding. If I had listened to my father and been a proper Malfoy, without chasing after lost books and murderous conspiracies ....
What had happened? Draco just saw Riddle holding the Shield, on the cusp of victory.
“I’ll do it.”
In the old days, Draco might’ve been able to silence the commander with a judicious recounting of all the dinner guests that had graced Malfoy Manor. Or, failing that, threaten the man with his father.
They were the elite. All the Auror personnel were tough and resourceful, and all had various degrees of cybernetic prosthetics, with enhanced bio-hydraulics and modifications to the musculature and skeleton, allowing for greater speed and strength of an average man. And all of them had neural chip implants that connected them to either personalized SI assistants like Hedwig or one of the Auror SI analysts.
Harry didn’t answer. He looked out the window, at the silhouette of the Shard outlined in the setting sun.
That thought dispelled my terror. I should be taking notes, writing all this down. And more than that, I needed to focus. I had seen the blue flames guarding the Grimoire. There likely would be more….
“I need your permission for the SI to give me a list. I’m pursuing a lead and I can’t continue unless I have this list.”
“There’s nothing to talk about.” I opened the family Bible to the first page. “11
“Don’t be ridiculous, Draco. You know as well as that you used it in one of the extenuating circumstances allowing the spell.” She paused, looking at Harry, who was now being strapped into a gurney by the field Healers. He saw us looking at him, gave us a weak thumbs up. “And you just saved Harry.”
My throat dried. It was -- stirring. It sent me into a frenzied state with desire; I pulled Harry down to meet my lips.
Rising high above what used to be the river Thames was the Headquarter for the Auror Force. It was an ugly building, a mishmash of different architectural styles, looking as though a child had piled on both blocks and cylinders haphazardly. It dominated the skyline in this section of the city, though Harry knew that was just the tip of it. Much more of the building extended underground, as a security precaution given the nature of the Auror’s work.
“The Official Secrets Act covers this meeting,” Dawlish said. “You cannot divulge any word of this.”
“That depends on the veracity of your information,” Harry said. “And don’t try to run. We’ll be able to find you anywhere.”
“All sorts use Elixir,” Finnegan said.
“We still need to talk,” he added, rather lamely.
The sun had long set, and the only illumination came from a single fluorescent lightbulb, casting an orange shade to the entire backyard. Draco found it soothing, easing the shortness in his breath.
“Don’t worry,” I added. “I mean, you’re coming with me anyways.”
But something in his chest overrode all rational consideration to propel him in doing this. The private’s words rang in his head: “No one available — heading into a trap —”
Blaise laughed, all worry banished from his face. He drew me into his arms. “Still. Thanks.”
“I’m trusting luck,” Harry said. “And I can feel a soft draft coming in this direction.”
Harry Potter…. After five long years, he had decided to finally appear back in Draco’s life again, and in the most dramatic way possible.
I held it slightly away from me. “You’re giving me a letter from an unknown sender? What if there’s a curse on it?”
“Well, here you are. And ahh ….” Ron seemed embarrassed.” You can keep the clothes.”
They moved in, Draco conscious of what Harry said.
“Thanks,” I said, rather taken aback. I nodded stiffly. “I look forward to your visits.”
They didn’t need to wait long. Outside, the harsh scrape of rubber on asphalt rang. Harry motioned for the others to crouch down.
“I was expecting him much earlier.” It was a simple statement with no reproach, but a shudder made its way around the room regardless.
Draco stilled his face, hoping that the bluff would work. It wasn’t out of the question; Harry had let Shacklebolt know that they were in the office, and Shacklebolt had helped with the cameras. However, from the way Harry phrased it, it was as if they had men at the corner waiting for the signal to break in.
“Ron is really impressed,” Harry had told me, after they had left. “He actually thinks you showed yourself to be, and I believe his words were, ‘more of a Gryffindor than his git face lets on.’”
“I hardly think so, Potter. Numerical superiority is meaningless. This is my house, remember? I think I have the advantage here.” Cross prepared to curse us –
“Yes, I gathered that,” Malfoy drawled. “I doubt you could afford my fees on your own.”
I turned my head so swiftly there was an audible snick. We looked at each other. His eyes were shadowed; one of my lightning had hit one of the bulbs. His lips were slightly parted, his breathing heavy and uneven. Mine wasn’t calmer; my entire body was hot. I moved my hand – it touched his, just on the edge, as I leaned in --
In under a second, Harry was back in the dully colored flat with the sunlight streaming through the window. The whole interaction in the console had only taken a few minutes, helped by the processing power of Harry’s brain-chips.
“There’s a mole somewhere, sir,” Harry said, and his voice instinctively pitched low. “Either that or they have spywares in our system that we haven’t found. They knew about our raid and ran. That was why we chased that car through London to Covent Garden.”
“You, of my blood, thinned as it is, should not look away. This is your both your birthright as well as your future.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Shouldn’t your biomechanical system be able to detect poison and drugs?”
“Leave the address of the warehouse,” Harry ordered. “As well as the post office box that you us to communicate. That’ll be the end of your part in this.”
That cheeky bastard, I thought. Getting the last word in like that.
Just a little bit more … my fingers reached the carved handle of my wand.
My father continued speaking:
“They’ll be brought to heel,” Cross said dismissively. “After all, with the power of Slytherin’s Grimoire behind you, I don’t think they’ll dare to challenge you.”
Harry was deep in thought as he walked down the hallway. There were a few questions that he didn’t understand about this Hopkirk’s death. Not to mention the circumstances surrounding his file.
I ran. Through the garden, past the woods and the bushes, through the dark hallways, my feet catching on the plush carpet and the tiled floor.
“I can get these ropes off,” Harry said. “But they’re watching us, and I doubt I can overcome them all by myself.”
My father sought to redirect the flow of the conversation back to his favored topic of choice these days, to convince me to be a proper Malfoy heir.
My fireplace crackled with the green flames of the Floo. It used to be electric, since the building had no chimneys. It took some effort, but Goyle managed to redo the ventilations and installed a proper one so that I’d have a connection to the Floo Network. He was a magical contractor now, specializing in mixed residential buildings. He was a particularly dab hand at expansion charms; my flat was much larger than any one bedroom should be, even at the rate I was paying.
I glared coldly back at them. They could look all they wanted – it was an accident, and I’d be damned if I allowed them to run me out of the Reading Room with such a flimsy excuse. Chamberlain, that old fart, had upended a shelf with his bulk, and only received sympathy and mild jokes at his expense about his fatness.
There was a little sound from Malfoy that could have been a grunt. Harry retracted his hand. “Sorry. Does it hurt?”
“Were you expecting me to refuse? I’m not foolhardy, especially not since….” My voice trailed off and I looked away.
“Rosier needs to be clearer in his prose. If all academics wrote like this, no wonder our education system is so degenerate. Thankfully, Draco never writes like this. Shows a demonstrated clarity of thought and proper logical reasoning, not the twaddle I had just spent an hour reading. Wonder how investors would make of it.”
“So what do we do?” Potter asked. “Go to Hogwarts?”
He had achieved much in this life, he freely acknowledged that. He had slowed the march of degenerates around the world through necessary means. But as always, the work of the virtuous was never complete, and it was time to step from the shadows. Secrecy and subtlety were all very well, but at times, a frontal assault was needed. A display of power.
Target is leaving, Hedwig said. Going off grid into pedestrian zones.
Potter broke in a reluctant smile. “Did you just apologize to my house?”
Draco jumped on the second man, the butt of the pistol going straight for the temples. The man collapsed.
“Interesting.…” The librarian stared at me “I suppose you would know better than me, Dr. Malfoy. About lost manuscripts and old books.”
“Anyways, now that we’re here, why don’t we get a drink. So we don’t stand out. Your treat, of course.”
That was the end of it. There was no more. No further hints or any other mentions.
“Well … yes. But –”
Potter eyed me with concern, his expression like what I imagined of a mother hen watching her chicks. “Yes? Are you alright? I’m sorry that my story upset you so much, but—”
“I’ll help you,” Draco said. “I’ll examine the object for you. If you promise not to harm Harry and me.”
“It was a dark night that night. I remember that it was storming, with lightning streaks across an expanse of black, and the thunder that woke me up. It was back at Malfoy Manor, so it seemed all the more terrifying.”
Harry glanced at Finnegan, who only looked amused.
I doubled back to my room. Perhaps the silver one with blue strips. Or the green silk and wool blend. They brought out his eyes.
Draco grabbed his shoulder. It burned with the awkward throb of having been slammed into solid wood reinforced with steel. Thankfully, the desk hadn’t been too large, or otherwise Draco would be in more agony.
Where was he? Draco was not a patient man, except perhaps with his own foibles, and he didn’t tolerate tardiness in others. With the current threat from Riddle hanging like Damocles’ sword, Draco had to admit he was beginning to worry.
The Antikythera Mechanism.
“Yes, I know,” I interrupted. Really, lecturing a magical historian on the value of old spell books? “It’s THE Grimoire. Slytherin’s Grimoire.”
“Yes?” He stopped at the door.
“Hello, Luna.” Draco sat down across from Luna Lovegood, his erstwhile colleague at the British Museum and former classmate. They had been in the same cohort for their graduate program, and Draco had come to like her despite her tendency to suspend disbelief in the most unlikely of phenomenon. It was through her that he had learned of the existence for the theories concerning the Shield of Achilles.
Harry must not have hidden the surprise on his face very well, because Grey Eyes smiled faintly.
And then the news had leaked.
“Like the junkies,” Harry said with realization. “That’s why you know so much about the drug. Because you need to use it.”
Yet he pushed on gamely, and I had to admire him for that.
“Mr. Potter,” Dolohov sighed. “You really are testing my patience. You are one man. You really can’t think you’ll have a chance at succeeding to get out of here without my blessing. It’s already impressive as it is that you’ve manage to get past Greyback, though he was never that useful to begin with. But now you’re being ridiculous, especially when I’m giving you such a good bargain. Draco’s help for your lives.”
Yet my fingers itched to delve into its secrets. Without any help.
“I don’t understand why they insist on holding an election,” mused Riddle. “There  is no need to provide such a facade. The Russian people understand fear and strength — that is what I always admired about them.”
“I’m sorry I dragged you into this mess,” Harry said huskily, tracing the edge of the bandages.
It was beautiful in a lonely, ghostly way. It evoked feelings of the untamed wild, and indeed, over the rows of tents was the desert, stretching for miles as far as the eye could see.
“We have to go!” Potter threw me onto the broom, then jumped on, his arms hemming me in to prevent me from falling as he took off.
“Smells nice. You cook?”
“You’re right, of course. Where are my manners?” He waved his hand and a silver tea set appeared on the table.  He motioned for me to sit as the pot began to pour into the bone china cups.
Apart from the cams in the lobby and the hover quay, there are only the blast doors which are monitored by an AI, Hedwig told Harry. The AI is run-of-the-mill and not terribly sophisticated, but from my analysis, it seems to be able to do its job properly. Every flat also has an emergency line to the porter’s desk.
“Yes,” Draco said. “We’re happy, but neither side of our respective families approve, and – I don’t know – it’s all very new to me.”
“It’s not even that early. And besides, we have a big day ahead of us. It’s best to not wait ‘til midday to look for the cave.”
“Lube,” he said to my querying look.
Draco, by contrast, couldn’t bring himself to touch a drop of alcohol. Or, if he wanted to, he needed something much stronger than wine. Whiskey perhaps, or vodka. His head hurt.
His assistant waved me up, giving me a curious once-over. I ignored it. He was familiar, and I recalled his face as one I had seen before in Hogwarts. He was probably one of Potter’s Gryffindor lackeys, following him like a puppy.
“Don’t hack into their files,” Harry said quickly. They had already delved much more into the Department of Mysteries than they should have. “I think we should do this the old fashion way.”
“Of course we’re not alright, you bloody fool,” Grey Eyes snapped. “You could have killed us. Why couldn’t you have activated that car’s control chip earlier?”
My bag was still with me. Somehow, I had managed to bring it back in one piece. The top of it I had sealed with magic; I was more than ever grateful to this unexpected foresight meant to guard against my clumsiness.
“A little trick I picked up,” Harry said. “It’s a type of identifying spell that discerns what magic is in these walls. You were right – this does need blood. But only a little.”
Their faces were close enough to touch. Draco could count the individual lashes on Harry’s face, took in the warm green eyes like heated emeralds. Draco’s mouth parted slightly as he leaned in, the motion so practiced and natural, like the ghost of his past had possessed his body and was guiding it inexorably forward for a kiss –
Riddle touched the Decoder. “It was a clever idea of mine to loosen the leash we had on the Malfoy boy. I had every faith that he would have led us to this. And he did.”
Harry rubbed his head. Strangely, nothing was hurting now. “It felt much longer.”
“You Slytherins and your blood.” Harry shook his head. Before I could inquire further into that remark, he asked: “What do you propose to do, then?”
“I look forward to your coffee,” Potter said with a smile as he showed me out.
I considered the contents of my fridge and took out some leftover filet from dinner yesterday. “You like steak?” I waved my wand and it flew into a pan, the stove turning on with a click.
“Harry!” Fudge came over, with a great disingenuous beam on his face. “How are you? What – what is going on? Are you alright?”
Wormtail let out a little squeak. “No, master.”
“Being cooperative is so much more helpful, is it not?” he cooed, crouching down. “See how easy it is to get on my good side –”
“Well, Achilles was a warrior, and his equipment had to be practical. Even mythical shields made of gold won’t be useful in battle. They’ll be too heavy, and gold is too soft.”
I moved without thinking, my wand out, hovering over his chest as I pumped healing spell after healing spell. He twitched, once, twice, before subsiding into stillness.
I breathed in. Fairy lights fluttered, washing the garden with a soft glow. Here, flowers that were out of season still bloomed, kept so by magic and scrupulous attention. Elaborate topiaries of mythical creatures towered over the manicured hedges. Stone benches were unobtrusively placed around the garden.
“Kingsley knows the owner,” Harry said, and he led Draco in, ignoring the scandalized looks and scowls of the ones waiting for to be seated.
Advances in artificial computing had split the technology in two groups. One was termed Autonomous Intelligence, which were capable of independent action but relied on inputs, and Sentient Intelligence that had the ability to perform intuitive leaps like a human. The latter was by far more effective but was stratospheric in price and required constant maintenance.
“I saw a play by this Muggle -born playwright recently,” I jumped in, hoping to fend off my father’s wrath. I didn’t want a wand fight at the dinner table. “It was a rather ridiculous one.”
“Yes.” Harry’s eyes were unflinching. “I’ve been investigating them ever since I learned the truth about my parents’ death. And when the team in charge of countering them found out, they offered me a spot.”
“Well, you can still try it,” the Weasley said mulishly, adding under his breath no doubt aspersions against my House founder.
“Malfoy!”
I tongued the tip, making a face at the taste of precum. Harry made a low noise, pushing; I almost gagged at the unexpectedness of it.
I nearly spat out my wine. Potter, at a sex club? I think I needed more alcohol to get me through tonight.
‘This is just one of the little ‘tricks’ we have left. There are more awaiting you should you find the Grimoire for us. But … you’ll have to prove yourself willing to help us too.’ The man produced another scroll. ‘Here is a list of ones we want dead. We want you to kill them for us. They will become your enemies eventually too, so another happy collaboration between us.’
In fact, the librarian, the most hostile, headed over.
“Really?” Potter looked surprised. “Isn’t this a Muggle building?”
“Let’s take this off,” he said, trying to pull my shirt off. I raised my arms, my body in a concave arc, reluctant to give up contact with Harry even for a second.
I nodded. Not a bad idea. “That looks like an inn up ahead. Why don’t we check in?”
His hands gave a forceful tug that almost had me coming. “I told you, you can call me Harry now.” He pulled at the waistband of my pants. “Gonna take this off now.”
That green was the color of the cover in my vision! And that snake – the ouroboros was drawn in the same style! Was this book related to Slytherin House somehow? Did Salazar Slytherin have a journal? I wanted to laugh at the ludicrous thought. Imagine the headline: ‘Memoirs of Salazar Slytherin uncovered!’ That’d make the front pages of the Prophet.
I took out the bottled memory that used to be the book-key and uncapped it. I touched the finger with the cut to the memory, wincing at the sting.
“I got to know you better. It’s a good tradeoff.” There was a gruff undertone as he said that. Then the moment was over.
“I think I have a very different impression of this place,” Potter said neutrally, “but I’m sorry that your memories of your home has been – well, ruined.”
“I’m not worried,” I said, smiling gamely at him. I wasn’t. Not with him around.
Just in case, I casted extra wards and protection spells, feeling the slight electric across my skin as they slid in place.
The librarian was startled. He narrowed his eyes at me. “Yes. I meant that.”
I smiled back, unsure at what to do. His presence made me lightheaded. I wanted to blame this on the drinks tonight, but it was a flimsy excuse. What happened earlier ... if I had leaned even a centimeter closer, our lips was have touched. My heart raced at the idea … my body grew warm….
“I’m sorry,” Draco said finally. His apology was stiff. “I didn’t mean to put you in a difficult position.”
Dolohov let out a volley a foot away from where they stood.
“I’m surprised you came all the way out here,” Harry said. “I never pictured you in one of the less posh areas of London before.”
“I wasn’t sure what I was thinking. I was so confused: angry and hurt that you didn’t tell me anything and scared that if you didn’t know, that I would somehow – endanger you.”
Nor did I care much for him. Physical appreciation aside, we had nothing in common. I had no idea where to begin the conversation if we were to somehow meet at dinner. He always seemed the type that grunted his responses, as evidenced by that broad shoulder and those strong legs ... his firm handshake that clasped my hand with crushing pressure....
Blaise hissed and I shared the sentiment. Sodding London had to be sunny today, of all days, when I could barely stand the smallest light.
“This the case about the dead Unspeakable?”
“Barely. I hope you learned your lesson, Draco. Don’t pull a stunt like this again. It might seem like an adventure to you, but it’s not a game. You don’t get a second life or a chance to restart. You die. Simple as that.”
“I know exactly the amount to give you, Potter. Given your body weight, how extensive your bio-modifications are, and how sophisticated your link components with your SI is, I could come up with a precise dose that would not permanently affect you.”
Blaise winked at Potter. “It’s part of his charm. Rough and untamed. Though I have to admit it does look good on him.”
Draco didn’t hesitate. He lashed out, his heel striking hard at Wormtail’s chest.
Damn. I was hard. I shook my head. I needed to concentrate. I was on the cusp of what could be the most momentous event in my career and here I was, fantasizing about a man who would probably greet me with a punch to the face.
“Is there any lead?”
Both me and my father glowered at her.
My toes curled. It was the type of kiss I fantasized Potter would give – urgent, tender. The way he pushed me against the bench, lying on top of me … my hand found my cock and began to stroke.
Harry rubbed his head. “That was illuminating. So he put his Grimoire in Godric’s Hollow? Why?”
“Theo, this is Harry Potter.”
“I’m not with you,” Harry said, picking up his glass. He eyed it. “Err … is this safe to drink or will it be spiked?”
“Next time, I’m setting Warning Charms on everything,” I huffed.
“I suppose you’re right.” Harry settled back, slumped, and looked forward.
“What? Of course not. Don’t be ridiculous.” Harry glowered at Malfoy. “Thank you for your help,” Harry added ungraciously.
Despite the turmoil raging within, I clung to the manners ingrained in me since birth. “Hello — Kreacher? I take it we’re in the Black family’s house.”
Millicent blushed. I laughed. What an interesting bunch we were.
“Don’t be in such a hurry,” he laughed. He clambered over me; my hands reached up past his shirt, tweaked his nipples. “Can – can you do that again?”
There was a chilling gust of wind that seemed to rise with my father’s words. Numb, I turned to look at the source.
“Can you zoom in or is there any better angle?” Malfoy asked. “Who is that man and why are you showing us this particular video?”
The windows were all bullet-proof to some extent, he had explained they locked the door and barricaded it with furniture from the sitting room. Harry had told Weasley and Granger what had happened at the restaurant in broad strokes, omitting the backstory about the Shield and Draco’s involvement. From the look on Granger’s face, they probably would need to have a long private conversation between the three of them.
“No, its ….” Potter paused. “It’s your bedroom.”
“Very well then. Let’s talk terms.” Cross prepared to give what looked like a rehearsed speech, but I raised my hand. He frowned at me.
“I didn’t,” he said, looking embarrassed. “I found it while I was cleaning out your room in Grimmauld Place. I thought it would look good on you. You wear suits better than I do.”
He was even more broad-shouldered than he was five years ago, the face darkly tanned and weather-beaten, but still youthful, especially when that smile flashed.
I looked at them fondly. It was practically a tradition by now to meet at least once a week for drinks whenever we were in the same city. We were each other’s connection with our collective past.
“He’s my father,” I said simply. I didn’t think I needed to say any more. We sat quietly together, looking at the stars.
Harry was much more recovered now, and had a cup of steaming tea in his hands. “Start at the beginning.”
Potter came to sit next to me. His naked torso beckoned me. He leered at me. “I think you know exactly what I’m saying.” He took my hand and placed it on his chest. I twitched. Goddamn Potter. “Sex. No strings, no commitments.”
Draco tried to focus. Who was Rosier? He evidently was an academic, a professor, who did not meet with his father’s approval. Draco smiled. Apparently few did.
I tumbled hard back into the present, my elbow colliding painfully with a stack of books next to me. As they cascaded down, Potter pulled me back and I landed painfully on top of him.
Last night … last night was scorching, alternatively intense and tender. They had coupled twice, the first time rushed and eager, with neither Harry nor Malfoy wanting to give way, and the second slow, with both of them taking more time to drink each other in.
Call for backup, Hedwig, he told her.
Draco raised a brow. “Is this how our taxpayer money is spent? For you to be investigating ludicrous claims? Because if that’s so, I think I need to write to my MP.” His father had stood for the seat more than once, Draco remembered. Never with much success: Lucius Malfoy was too much the aloof aristocrat to ever find acceptance from the electoral system.
“Damn.” Harry took all of this in. “I’m no curator, but I can guess these are worth at least a couple million pounds.”
“Indeed.”  Malfoy reached out to touch the hologram. Metis flew off with a chirp. “I consulted on the initial phase of the project, and I’m still on retainer. I still have access to the files from the Department of Mysteries, though I haven’t paid much attention to them in the past few weeks.” The hologram rippled under his fingers. “However, I’m surprised they allowed the Aurors to investigate this. The Unspeakables are notoriously possessive over their fief.”
Somehow, despite Granger having sworn her men to secrecy, knowledge that I had uncovered Slytherin’s Grimoire had leaked. Though Granger and the Ministry denied everything (as did Harry and I), there had been heated gossip both in the press and the academic world. It did not help that Ted Cross, eminent Head of the British Museum, Magical Section, vanished without a clue. My sneaking suspicion that the other reason behind my rise in popularity was due to those rumors. Of course, those stories paled in comparison to salacious tales of me and Harry, and had disappeared accordingly.
“We weren’t arrested,” Draco pointed out. “In fact, it was more the opposite. We were conducting a citizen’s arrest of Riddle and his group.”
The Weasley visibly quaked. “You wouldn’t.”
“It’s a claymore,” I explained to him, “a two-handed Scottish sword. It’s likely to be goblin made, judging by its craftsmanship, though I would need to test its composition to be certain. Or have a goblin identify it.”
“But you already checked the safe and the family vault. Where else is there?”
“We’ll take care of the situation here,” she said. “You take Draco to the Healers.”
“I’m not here to mope and debate with you about my past, Potter.” I tried to keep my calm. Everything in me wanted to run from this conversation. But I was undeniably excited at the prospect of seeing the Circle’s hoard and what kind of ill-gotten goods they had been hiding. Not to mention the desire to hex the cool, calculating expression off Cross’ face the next time I ran into him. “Like Granger said, there’s no one with my level of academic credentials and practical experience. Well, no one that she trusts,” I amended. “I’m sure there are ones out there that she could find given enough time.”
“Sorry.” Potter coughed into his napkin as my parents looked at him. “Swallowed too quickly.” His foot collided with my own. I trapped it with my own before he could do any damage.
I breathed a sigh of relief at having avoided another burden on my conscience.
He waved goodbye to Harry, conscious of how much he wanted to drag his lips across Harry’s back. Draco flushed, remembering his wank last night. It wouldn’t do to want Harry. Not at all.
“I … can come back later?”
That caught her attention.
A rushing sound filled my ears, like the roar of the London traffic. I saw stars and the moon in the night sky, glowing bright like pale jewels. They moved, a speedy flock of lights, and the sun rose, a fiery ball that outshone all the rest that I had to avert my eyes.
It was the librarian. The breath choked in my throat as I stared. In the back of my mind, I knew it should not have come as a surprise. I knew he was linked to this, and his attack in the Reading Room today proved that, but to find that he was the intruder – it left a bitter taste, that he had been sitting so close to me all this time.
“Are you Draco Malfoy?”
In a cabinet off to the side, a silver light pulsed evenly through the crack of the closed door.
It was a hollow with space enough for roughly two or three people. It was well-maintained, if sparse, with the walls sturdy and the dirt floor clear of debris. It was empty as far as Draco could see.
“It’s not that. It’s just –” Harry struggled to put his thoughts into words. “I’m surprised that the Ministry allowed someone to take the schematics of this home,” he said finally.
“Let me help you take this off,” Harry said, pulling on Draco’s shirt, and his voice was rough.
“What’s going on?” Harry’s voice was loud in his ears. It still came muffled through the buzzing as Draco was plunged into frozen fear –
Hover traffic was highly automated, and most of the vehicles were driven by AI that heeded the signals from the grid monitor. Any deviations caused chaos. Two hansoms crashed into each other with an awful screech. A truck braked to avoid hitting a building, and its cargo of silken clothing flooded everywhere, fluttering like angry birds and blocking the windshield of the cars. A cacophony of alarms, horns, and shouts ran into each other as the pileup continued.
“You’re too insignificant for me to care about,” Malfoy drawled.
Blaise wrinkled his nose. “You always cast it too strong,” he said. He sneezed. “And I’m allergic to this particular scent.”
Harry’s angry recriminations burned away at the sight of that marring otherwise perfect skin. “What is that?”
“Oh, and another thing. Have a cyber shrink conduct a checkup. It’s been a while since your last, I believe.”
Draco raised his glass in a toast. “Thank you. To new business ventures.”
He and Draco were alone again, the tires of the Land Rover fading into the background.
“Mr. Malfoy,” he began in an unctuous tone that slid down my skin like slime, “the Gringotts Reading Room has a strict policy of –”
“I was thinking of offering Harry the same, too,” Granger said. “The Head’s been on me for some time now to bring him back to the Ministry. Not necessarily back to the Auror Force, but we hate to lose a talent.”
Both my father and Potter looked displeased at my lecture, and Potter seemed like he was about to argue some more, but my father broke in: “The first task I completed for the Dark Lord was to find all the information I could on the Circle. He would find the Grimoire for them, and in exchange, they would help him with his quest for power.”
“Shut it, Padma,” Harry snapped. “Is it too much to hope for that Shacklebolt hasn’t seen these yet?”
“I do insist. I can’t think of anything odder than someone who saved my name sounding so distant.”
The glow disappeared. In its place formed an outline of an archway that beckoned in the darkness.
My father nodded. “Like the Dark Lord. He already came to their attention while he was a student, and they saw in him potential. Potential to use him to find the book and complete the task they were charged with. After all, similar goals.
“And who is this ‘master’?” Draco asked when he was certain his voice no longer cracked. “Why do they keep calling him that?”
“What?” My mouth fell open. I must look like a fish. I had fantasized about it, but there was a reason why it was a fantasy.
I slammed my mind shut with a force had me bite the inside of my cheeks. I tasted the coppery salt of blood as I summoned up all my mental barriers to repel the librarian’s Legilimency.
Just being here gave Draco a thrill that was entirely unrelated to the temperature. It was here that traders of all civilizations plied their wares, from the Minoans to the Myceneans to the Turks and the Venetians. It was the crossroads of cultures, where ideas as well as goods were exchanged.
“It’s it,” he shouted at the just emerged Harry. “This is it!”
“Why do I have a feeling you’ll mock me for my lack of culinary refinement after we get there?”
Malfoy responded with a cool look of disdain. “Helping you from being robbed blind, it seems.”
Draco supposed he couldn’t fault Sirius for being cautious.
“Revelio,” I whispered, tapping the book-key.
“There’s a file on the man’s console that I want to take a look at back at the office,” Harry said. “It’s encrypted in a way that SI can’t break easily.” That was the most surprising; despite Harry’s ribbing, Sentient Intelligence was in Harry’s experience one of the most efficient and effective cryptographers.
He took out his cellphone and searched through the contacts. The call went through on the third ring.
I explained my reasoning to him. “And besides, what’s wrong with calling us a couple?” I asked. “It’s not like I said we were married.”  I knew why Harry was annoyed. After all my insistence that we were simply having a fling, I had gone defining it with weighted meaning.
He rubbed the area on his arm where I knew the Dark Mark had been burned into the flesh. “And of course, he accepted.”
Evidently Potter felt it too. He looked away, but not before I caught a hint of flushed skin.
“You live in walking distance,” I pointed out. “I’ll come visit some time, or we can get lunch.”
“They are.” Fletcher’s eyes glittered. “Tell me, Mr. Malfoy, how is it that you have such good luck? These artifacts are very rare, you know, and the government is keeping a tight watch on them to ensure they do not fund terrorism.”
“You think your father could have hidden Rosier’s clues there?”
It’s them or us, he told himself. That was all there was to this – the most basic human urge to survive.
Potter shook his head. “I have a flat in Camden. This house is more of a meeting place and a hideout than an actual residence. Though there’s not much need for a hideout anymore….”
I rolled my eyes. Honestly, so ignorant.
Five years later, Malfoy Manor, Wiltshire:
“That seems like the best approach to life,” Draco said gently. “Take whatever wins you can get and move one step at a time.”
Draco clambered uncomfortably after Harry, his elbow banging against the rock as he slid down.
“God-father,” he corrected. “I think he might be your cousin, actually. Teddy Lupin, Andromeda’s grandson.”
“You should relax, take a break,” Goyle said. “Get laid. You’ve been in a hole lately. You work too hard.”
“I seem to have an issue with my optical lenses,” Finnegan said. “And my ears. I don’t seem to be able to understand anything right now. Must be a glitch.”
Grey Eyes scowled at Harry’s attitude.
Harry silenced Draco’s babble with hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I’m kidding. Think of what they’ll say at HQ if they found out I was felled by a hug.”
“He just sent a message that he would be indisposed tonight. Something about a poor stomach.”
Draco waved his hand. “I’m not entirely certain myself. They’re all under various trusts and managed by trustees. Incidentally, I might have difficulty staying at a hotel. The trusts pay a substantial amount, but I’ve spent a lot this quarter on repairs and maintenance for the Manor. And a night at a hotel like the Athenaeum is steep. I can’t afford to stay there indefinitely.”
Being drugged wasn’t a kind sensation, at least not to Harry. He wondered how others could stand it, how they willingly sought this out. He himself would be grateful to never feel so muddleheaded again.
“You can’t be that much of a virgin, are you, Potter?” Malfoy asked with amusement, shifting his weight to settle on Harry’s thighs, close to where Harry was rock hard and straining. His movement caused the fabric to shift, to rub against Harry’s groin and Harry groaned at the delicious friction of it all.
“They were also men who suffered from megalomania, whatever their redeeming qualities were,” Draco said. “Which proved to be their Achilles’ heel, if you’ll forgive the pun.”
“Why would he be involved in this?” Harry asked. He wasn’t opposed to seeing Malfoy again. Those grey eyes ….
“I thought you always said eating dinner before the sun sets is gauche.”
“And you’re a ranked MMA fighter,” Shacklebolt continued as though Draco had not said anything. “You speak four languages and you clearly are familiar with the subject matter. And we saw how you handled Dolohov. He was a former hitman with the KGB, you know. It was impressive what you did.”
“Maybe that will finally get the Ministry to care,” I said, with more bitterness than I had intended.
“Sugar?”
“You weren’t unreceptive to it,” Draco said. It was on the verge of his tongue to tell Harry that Draco missed him. But Draco’s courage only extended so far. So he waited.
My father shot him a dark look as he continued with his tale. “It’s a bargain, they said, not a gift. Power for power, that was the price. To give access to the Dark Lord all their collective resources, the two representatives from the Circle said that the Dark Lord, as the Heir of Slytherin, had a duty to fulfill.
“I have a gun too,” Draco said
“Draco ….” Harry wiped away a tear off Draco’s face with a finger.
“There are several patents linked to the military projects held by an entity called the Narcissa Trust,” the computer said. “We investigated further and found that this trust has several layers of legal veils and shell companies that all originated here in London.”
“No, I’m just pointing out the fallacy in your reasoning,” I said, just as pleasantly. Chill crept down my spine. The anger vanished, replaced by fear. Cross was losing patience; I sensed it, humming under the edge, barely kept in check. “It’s my nature; I can’t help it.”
“I came because they couldn’t reach you,” Draco explained. He forced himself to keep talking, to keep his mind off the patter of bullets. “They spotted these men on satellite, but your radio wasn’t working, so I came.”
“What? Really? He looks shorter than I thought he would.”
Bellatrix took advantage of the shocked stillness. She snatched the Decoder from Draco’s hand, Draco being too frozen by the sudden appearance of the newcomers to react, dumping him backwards with a blow to his abdomen.
I watched the fading sun shine its rays on Harry’s face, the light catching in such a way that a halo illuminated his outline. It was going to be evening soon; already, I could see the moon peek out, the air growing chillier as the day finished.
“And?” Potter’s voice was strained. I knew what he referred to: did they find the bodies?
“I know. This sword has power – you can feel it, can’t you? Sometime in its past life, it came into battle with something powerful and came better off. You can tell because goblin-made objects absorbs the quality of whatever doesn’t destroy it and –”
He leered at me. “You seem to like my decrepit arse very much. And no more dressing like a Dementor. It makes me sad to think of you hiding all of your … assets … under those baggy robes.”
“I can get a drink anywhere,” Harry said, his face flushing as he tried to ignore the other part Blaise mentioned. “We have alcohol up there too.”
Another hit and a grunt. Draco surged forward – the guard raised his gun.
It was a relief to be outdoors. The Weasley’s garden was overgrown and unruly, a horrifying mess compared to the manicured detail of the Manor’s parks. But Draco secretly felt that the Burrow had a rustic charm that the Manor, for all its perfection, lacked.
“The top is for tourists,” Draco said. “There’s a bar up there. Slightly overpriced and rather pretentious, but the view is amazing. After all, most people don’t really come here for the mixologists.”
I couldn’t help laughing. “Sounds much better than my day.” I hesitated, wondering how much to reveal. “I spent most of my day with my books. I don’t think the early Druidic hexes can compare to being chased by peacocks.”
My fingers grabbed the handle of my wand. I couldn’t turn my wand on my own father. I prayed that Potter had the ability to disarm my father before Cross reacted.
His father had died in a crash the day before his sentencing. Both him and Draco’s mother, along with their solicitor, had been in the car when it collided. Draco hadn’t been there; it was the aftermath of another quarrel that left sitting in the same space with his father almost impossible to contemplate.
“Well, I’m certainly not going to bleed over the entire damn place.” I thought hard. I had never once thought of the practical matters of discovering lost artifacts – they had always seemed to theoretical in my mind.
I paid no attention to the dueling jets of light that raged above my head as I ran towards Cross. I had no idea what I planned – tackle him? Run him to the ground? Blood rushed through my head. All I knew was that I never felt such a rush of emotions before. I wanted to feel Cross’s soft flesh against my fist –
“Come in,” I called.
It was a much-needed break. Their relationship had gone from enmity with sexual tension simmering underneath to an uneasy arrangement of casual sex and unspoken feeling to – Draco supposed they were dating now.
Potter actually laughed at that. Growling, I grabbed his arm and pulled him towards the fireplace. “We’re going to be late. I’ll see you later, Blaise.”
“Actually, they do,” Harry said. “I have an emergency radio transmitter on me at all times. It should be reinforcements. They should’ve came sooner, but I’m guessing it was all that rock that prevented them from picking up the signal.”
“Thank you.” Harry rubbed his wrists as Finnegan led the prisoners away. “Always helpful at the last minute.”
“It’s alright,” Draco said. “I can see the station up ahead. This isn’t the Arctic, you know. I can handle this bit of walking.”
That was the last thought before my world turned black.
“No!” Draco yelled.
“We’ll keep that in mind,” Draco said. “Are we close?”
“Pity. They have a great cellar here. I know the owner, you know. Tom’s a great friend of mine. Very fond of each other, we are.”
Finnegan grinned. “Sounds like you’re an old hand at this.”
“I don’t think we asked for your permission, little boy,” Bellatrix said. “I noticed that your boat here is very sinkable. It’s a pity too, since it’s such a nice boat.”
“Go away,” came Harry’s muffled voice.
“You can’t bargain with me, boy,” Greyback said, smiling that feral smile of his. “But if you get on my … good side … then I’ll consider your proposal.”
“It was brave what you did back there,” he told Malfoy gruffly. “And it was impressive the way you took down some of those men. I didn’t know you had it in you.”
“I’m not getting my hopes up,” Harry said dryly. Malfoy was dressed, as usual, in a tailored suit and appeared immensely different from the tousled-haired man that had been next to Harry in bed last night. “How are you up so early?”
“We’ve already left the scene,” Harry called out from the front. “You’ll need to send your men over to take charge. There’s a body there that needs to be taken care of, and we don’t know if there are any other injured.”
Not that Harry had committed any with Malfoy, of course. But it was a fear now, one that laced the air like a poisonous miasma, that any sign of unconformity or deviancy was a threat and had to be dealt with accordingly. Only in Underground were attitudes more relaxed, which only added to the sense of its degeneracy.
