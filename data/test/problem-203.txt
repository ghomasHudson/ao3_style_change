Across the table, Theodore raised a reproachful eyebrow at him. “Enough that you completely wasted the time that we should have spent eating lunch in the Great Hall or, better yet, finishing our Transfiguration Essay,” he finished dryly, waving towards the parchment in front of Harry that he had been sleeping on.
"Well," Potter shifted nervously. Then he paused, as if perusing a thought, before coming to a decision. He walked to the door and made sure it was closed shut. He turned back to Draco. "The Ministry of Magic's trying all they can to disprove that Voldemort's back. The Daily Prophet has propaganda against Headmaster Dumbledore all over it. If we weren't there in Little Hangleton, it would actually be pretty believable."
Realizing that he was not alone anymore, Draco looked up and he blinked hard at the sight of books hovering in mid-air. Quickly, Harry put the books down on the nearest hard surface and fished his wand from his pocket to take off the Disillusionment charm. He carried the books again.
The first thing that Draco said when he Flooed inside Harry’s flat was: “I wasn’t joking about the wine, Potter.”
Harry didn't listen to Slughorn at all during that lesson. He didn't mean to really, but he guessed it was okay, because that meant he can ask Draco about it later.
Beside Fleur Delacour's sister was another student from his year. Ravenclaw Seeker Cho Chang. And beside her…
Whenever he and McGonagall would pass ways, he would smile at her sheepishly in greeting and she would stare at him from above her spectacles as if she wanted to say something, but she would always just shake her head and sigh and walk away with a simple "Good day to you, Harry."
“I think it was a nice kiss.”- said Harry, still holding his now empty cup of tea without looking ate his friends.
“What if she says no. Krum is right there and he obviously still likes her. She can run away with him.” -said Ron, still walking around. - “Or with Shacklebolt, he is also here. Why did he come? He wants to take her away from me. And she would go.”
“Yes, he really likes watching you play, and you really like that he likes it, don’t you? Harry, you should be jealous.” -Said George.
They ignored him and took him into the Forest, Hagrid gave Draco a dead ferret for him to give it to Buckbeat. “Does it have to be a ferret?” asked Draco under his breath. Neville was standing behind Hagrid and Harry was next to Draco.
“Using her for what? I’m quite sure that you both have said that he was afraid of getting married because he didn’t want to hurt her”- asked Draco, surprising harry with his interest.
“Who is it?”- said Hermione, coming closer to the door. - “Oh Harry, you look terrible, what’s going on?”
After almost three hours of the same game of chess, Ron, fearing he would lose, suggested they all should go for a walk. Draco, also fearing he would lose, said it was a brilliant idea. So, by Harry’s suggestion, they all went to the London Zoo.
“Drink it. I don’t want to risk any of the kids realizing your state. It doesn’t taste that bad. And it’s not poisoned, if you were worried about that.” – They both drink the potion, and it made their head burn for a few seconds.
“I didn’t say that it was. But we all know that Hermione is stubborn, even more than Ron. He must be the one to bring up
.” Said Harry putting his arm around Draco, startling the Malfoys since they didn’t see him approach along with Neville. “Isn’t that right,
“I can help Teddy become whatever he wants. If he wants to play Quidditch I recommend you take him to see your girlfriend’s games, maybe he will learn something, as long as you don’t teach him.”
“No. You are looking for these two, over here.” -said Ron, pointing at Harry and Draco. – “They are the ones raising him.”
Harry spent New Year’s Eve with the Malfoys. He felt bad about leaving Teddy and Andromeda alone with them, so he went along. Also, he hadn’t seen Draco during the holidays. It was clear that Draco’s parent
“I won’t. I’m never tired if I’m with you.” As he said this, he opened the door to their office and let Harry go in first.
“Yes, it is bad, Neville. you are a professor and she is a student. A minor.” -said Harry. - “did that student gave you a present for Valentine’s day?”
“Harry don’t sit there; you’ll be too far from us. Sit next to Draco, please.” – Harry obeyed. Once he was sitting, she talked again. – “Im so glad you could come, now I can thank you properly.”
Slytherin won with 180 points. After the match they went to Honeyduckes to buy the chocolate. They saw that Neville and Hannah went inside Madam Puddifoot’s tea shop. Harry bough Draco 8 kilograms of chocolate.
“They are fine. They are responsible adults who can talk things out and working together is not going to get in their nice relationship.” Said Neville.
“No offense, but your father isn’t powerful anymore. No one is scared of him. Even with a wand I’m sure I can take him down.”
“Yes, I learned in school, but mostly granny and Draco taught me.” He answered, looking at Harry to see if he was impressed. “School is boring, right?”
“Stop, you don’t have to do this.” Harry interrupted, he was so freaked out, he hadn’t considered that Malfoy might have to apologize to him.
Potter snorted. "The Heir of Slytherin needs to be dark and mysterious, Malfoy, not Gilderoy Lockhart. Anyway, I tried to ask, but Severus just told me to stay vigilant and out of it. Didn't tell me anything about what the professors were thinking or planning."
Draco looks at him wearily, as if he’s weighing whether he should agree to engage in civil conversation with him. In the end, he sighs and talks. “It’s… hazy. But I still know what’s happening. Sometimes. Don’t think I didn’t see you wiping my face like a child, Potter. Don’t ever do that again.”
“Don’t bother your pretty little head over it,” Draco scoffs, waving a condescending hand. “It’s unbecoming of the Saviour of the Wizarding World to be so concerned over me that you’d threaten an innocent civilian.”
Snape, despite his attempts to condition himself from plunging back into maudlin memories of the past, found himself taking a very sharp intake of breath at the sight of those green eyes staring up at him.
Lavender, however, was starting to look like his Aunt Marge when he accidentally spilled coffee on her dog when Harry was eight years old. Lavender straightened her back and glared, nose upturning. "Back off, Malfoy! We don't need Death Eater scum here!"
Now that Draco was looking at him again, Harry nodded enthusiastically, almost pleading with his expression.
"I was informed of what happened in Little Hangleton," Severus started, slowly. He seemed to be putting a lot of thought and care in his words. "Yes, you were bleeding a lot, because of Nagini."
Walburga Black was his mother's aunt, Severus told him as they passed hallway after hallway and went up a flight of stairs. Her portrait hung on a wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm, and she despised having muggles and half-bloods in her home. Severus had apparently shut her portrait up with a myriad of Silencing spells, but Silencing spells often lose their effect after a few hours, so they would have to be re-applied from time to time.
“But honestly, Harry,” Draco continued, smiling charmingly at him. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to sleep in animagi form?”
Red. Red everywhere. In the bathtub. All over the floor. Smeared on the walls. Smeared on the sides of the tub. And in the middle of the room… Potter lay sprawled on the floor, one arm slung over the side of the tub. Blood dripped down his nose and mouth, staining his clothes, arms, and legs. When he saw Draco, his eyes widened with fear, and he pressed his hands over the lower half of his face as he crawled backwards, wedging himself in between the tub and the toilet.
It was the last thing his father told him, before September 1st rolled in, and the school year was to start again.
And it’s like a blow to the chest. Draco laughs, stunned and breathless, and he ducks his head, tries to stop the well of tears from falling.
Today, they sat beside each other on the Ravenclaw’s table, just because they could. And it was the closest to the door. And it was a perfect match with the fact that their next horcrux (or rather, it’s magical remnants) was Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem.
The wizarding world already considered him bad. After that incident, the dark side considered him bad too and not the approved kind.
The Death Eaters just sounded like a club to him. Like a club full of rich, dark wizards that bought and sold illegal artifacts here and there, but… The Dark Lord wasn't in the plan.
And then Harry asked, so softly and muffled into Remus’ shoulder that he almost didn’t hear: “I’m a vampire, aren’t I?”
He also tried to listen to the lecture, but his thoughts were faraway, filled with Draco Malfoy and Self-Erasing Parchments.
He actually didn’t have work to do. It was the first time for Harry to meet someone who was the same age as him and Snape wanted him to get a feel for it on his own. In other words, he wanted the two to become friends, seeing as they were going to be spending the next two weeks together.
There is a look of shock on Draco’s face, as if he hadn’t expected Harry to get so angry like that, but Harry doesn’t care anymore. If Draco wants to be a git, then fine.
The way Malfoy flinched and cast his robed arm away from him reminded Harry that he forgot to ask for permission, but he also forgot to give an apology when hisses sounded from beneath the dark cloth and formed a clear message.
Viktor Krum was all his posters and slogans said he was – dark, serious, and buff. He stood in one corner in all his muscles and facial hair, not talking to anyone, which Harry saw was just his personality rather than any actual hostility towards the other Champions. Cedric Diggory – to Harry's disappointment – really was a bit of a wuss. He kept fidgeting in his seat whenever Harry neared, and it looked like he was torn between talking to Harry because they were both the Champions for Hogwarts or not because Harry was a Slytherin and a vampire at that.
Even Malfoy becoming Seeker couldn't save them. And Malfoy was already pretty good, if a bit pigheaded at times.
And then, another person says, “Naw, that’s not Malfoy. Malfoy’s a thin lad. Do yer job properly, why don’t ya?”
Molly dabs at her eyes with her apron again. And again. And again. Until Arthur just laughs, pulls her in for a hug, and lets her cry on his shoulder.
He knows that Molly and Narcissa keep in constant correspondence, however, and Molly doesn’t mention anything out of the ordinary, and so Harry doesn’t ask.
And Draco was walking up to him, closing the distance between them in one, two strides and he was cupping Harry's face gently, his fingers smeared with blood, and Harry couldn't believe it.
Or it might interfere with the magic reaction that we’re trying to make, between the Mark and the horcrux.” Malfoy scrunched his nose up in though. “Or what’s left of it.”
And Madame Pomfrey had admonished his father that morning, telling him not to disturb her other patients, but… There was no one else inside the Hospital Wing besides him when he woke up.
All eyes snapped to her, and Ginny blinked, shocked and then betrayed. Her lips pursed, and her eyes went suspiciously bright.
Draco quirked an eyebrow upwards, and Harry half-expected him to say something snarky or something, but when Draco simply scooted closer and grabbed his quill, Harry thought his heart would burst.
Harry had little time to see what it was before the cat sat on it, but he wasn’t the youngest Seeker that Hogwarts has ever had for nothing.
Of course he was going to push Harry in the right direction of the book he really wanted, but it was to his surprise (and touched delight) when Harry picked up a Potions book as well.
“Take a seat, darling. He might still be a while,” Rosmerta said, waving sharp, manicured nails towards the cushioned bench beside her desk. She flashed him an apologetic smile, the colored powder on her plump cheeks rising with it and disappearing beneath the big, red curls of hair framing her face. “Harry’s been in there for an hour, you see.”
Draco clicks his tongue, irritated at himself for losing control, and turns his head away. He sags back in his seat.
He just wanted to know where Potter was. Wanted to give him a good scolding in the morning and possibly guilt-trip him into an even bigger debt, on top of that gillyweed. And he didn't like people keeping things from him, things he wanted to know.
Draco still hadn’t forgotten how Potter had used Parseltongue on it, and how the snake had started to move… for the first time in the past ten years. For the first time since Voldemort was alive. He wanted to ask.
“That’s Crabbe and that’s Goyle,” Draco introduced offhandedly. “I’ve got two more friends coming over, so –“
your blood. He is looking for your blood. I need you to make a very important decision, Draco. I apologize if this is sudden. I did not expect… We did not…" Then, Severus cut himself off, aware that he was wasting time with his rambling. He looked straight in Draco's eyes. "You can either leave this room and I will not take any blood from you. I will respect your choice. Or…" At this, he looked straight in Draco's eyes. "You can give Harry what he needs."
She then looked at Malfoy, a proud smile on her face. “Mister Malfoy. This is a very brave thing you’re doing.”
Narcissa continues. “It is a must that I remain visible to other pureblood families. Of course, the Wizarding World knows of what part the Malfoy family has played in the war, but we cannot let that force us into hiding. There are those who are waiting for the opportunity to gain all that we have yet to lose.” She glances at Draco wistfully. “We may have done bad things, Harry, but my son doesn’t deserve to be stripped of everything he ever was and had.”
"Well, maybe he doesn't want to hurt the girl's feelings, Ron," Hermione said, albeit a bit distractedly as she scribbled furiously onto her parchment. Suddenly, she stopped and narrowed her eyes at Harry. "What I'm wondering about is why you haven't talked to Ginny yet," she said, sniffing haughtily.
Despite all the fuss he makes out of it, Harry cooks for him still anyway because he knows that Draco, privately, appreciates the thought behind doing the "menial stuff" for each other. (The sap.)
Draco wished very, very hard that this Side-Along Apparition wasn't going to end up like his last one. His last one had been with his father, and Draco hadn't known about their destination.
At the center of the desk, something that had once been buried under the mounds of parchment that perpetually littered the Headmistress’ desk, was a small spot of dried, cracked wood. It looked like the wood in that particular spot had died, while everything else that made up the desk flourished on as beautiful, varnished mahogany.
On a usual day, Draco would just ignore it. Pansy had tried to give him the cold shoulder a lot during their first year, but she never could last longer than a day, especially if Draco gave her the cold shoulder back. If she was going to be petty about it, Draco could be pettier.
Harry grins at her sheepishly. They’ve had this conversation before, numerous times in the Burrow, and he thinks Ginny’s still trying just for the sake of it. “I’m sorry, Ginny. I just don’t feel like it. I just want to finish the school year in peace.”
When Draco comes to, Harry’s too tired from the onslaught of emotions he’s been through for the day to explain why they’re sitting on the floor of the compartment, legs folded in awkward angles to fit the tight space, and arms pressed against each other.
Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes. He had thought as much. Potter was surprisingly and stupidly hard on himself. "You're a
Harry sighs and reaches for a napkin. “You’re the one who should wipe the syrup off your face,” he mutters and gently dabs at Draco’s cheek.
Over the table, after George tells him through a mouthful of food at how bad Ron is at gambling, Harry tells Molly that Draco liked her blueberry pie, enough to eat it at dinner and request it for breakfast again the next day.
"Arguing," Severus replied shortly. He walked towards the Slytherin table. "They'll come to an agreement soon enough. Your mother will realize what the smart thing to do is, after she's done with all her… emotions." His lip curled in disgust.
Sirius’ nose scrunched up. “Wish she wasn’t.” Then, his face brightened up. “But I did have a right good time hexing her skirt into snakes once when we were seven.”
"So, Harry," Pansy started conversationally as they danced, her arms around his neck and his around her waist. "What are the chances that Draco won't hex me if I snog him?"
He was even more amused when the cat trotted off to the nearest doormat, which was conveniently the doormat of… Obscurus Books.
"My son, my Lord," Lucius Malfoy replied. In the haze of his dizziness, Harry thought that Lucius sounded nervous. But his regal stance and his confident gaze hid it quite well. "Here to pledge allegiance to you."
Draco's cheeks are pink as he coughs and repeats himself. "His fiancé." He looks away and waves vaguely towards Harry's hand on his chest.
On the day that they were to go to Hogwarts, Draco entered the living room, dressed in trousers, robes, and boots, to see Potter in his pajamas. He was playing Wizard's Chess with Kreacher. Kreacher was muttering things about needing to clean and Master Potter keeping him from his job, but he was actually doing a fine job obliterating Potter's pieces.
“Since Kingsley felt gracious enough to give me a whole week off last time, I finally got to working on my Head-Healing Draught for Victims of Crucio,” Draco said in triumph.
That was how he comforted himself – how he appeased his guilt of not being able to take care of his own godson.
Severus closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, looking like he was at the edge of his patience. "I shall be back shortly," he muttered.
, then I suppose it wouldn’t matter. The Dark Mark entwined itself with our magic the moment Voldemort cast it on us, so the arm used to cast wouldn’t make any difference.”
“He knows the alphabet now. He can read and write although he’s a bit slow. Start teaching him math. And magic. I haven’t taken him outside of the Manor, nor have I told him…” he trailed off with a vague wave towards the boy, who was standing stock still, green eyes wide and confused as to why the big man was crying.
, Potter? I knew you were hopelessly Gryffindor, but this is just pathetic," he spat, so unlike his quiet demeanor just a few minutes ago.
“Harry,” Ginny pleads, a day after all the Halloween festivities. It is late in the afternoon, and the sky is an overcast grey. In an hour, it will be dinnertime. They’re sitting together in one of the stone benches in the clock tower courtyard, where Ginny had cornered him in a last ditch effort. “The Ravenclaws are
Malfoy tore his eyes away to look back at him and give him a wry smile. “I’m not sure. I don’t miss the me that had been with him.”
Weasley, Head Auror and pretty much his overall boss, just sighed and pointed to the empty chair beside him. Draco nodded and promptly sat himself down, ignoring Kingsley’s stare.
Madame Pomfrey raised an eyebrow. "It's not Skele-Gro, dear. You'll find that your elbow and wrist are perfectly aligned with your lower arm, though I suggest not moving it yet," she added, as Harry had raised it experimentally and was now sporting a very pained expression.
he had finished his shudder of horrified disgust, which was more out of obligation than his actual dislike for Malfoy.)
He wasted no time scrabbling from the floor and turning around to hide behind his protector which was –
It had been approximately ten minutes since he and Cedric decided to go their separate ways. Judging by Bagman's other two whistles, all of the Champions were now currently in the Maze. Harry had been turning left and right, but so far hadn't encountered any trouble… and that was what slowly made him more suspicious, more nervous.
“So,” Draco started, when they were already done with their main course and were just starting on their dessert. “How many horcruxes in total were there again?”
There was confusion on Malfoy’s expression, as if wondering why the hell that was the case, but he simply said, “My, that’s awfully sweet of you.”
"But next time," Draco continued for him, raising an eyebrow haughtily. "At least have the manners to ask properly, instead of ignoring me and then giving me a fright every time I open your loo."
And Harry laughs, thinks that the secluded life of peace and gluttony doesn’t sound that bad, and wipes his tears away.
“But you’re going to have to call him Professor Snape once you’re there,” he had said with light humor.
Numbly, Draco recalled his father standing over him, shooting spell after spell, actually fighting fucking
He blinks, tries to stop himself from feeling happy about it. “Other people might call this stalking,” he says instead.
Potter wasn’t the one who was supposed to be apologizing, and Draco wasn’t the one who was supposed to be receiving those apologies, but the words still eased the pain on his chest and made his steps into the bathroom suddenly lighter.
"They are, Potter," Draco said agreeably, before a look of discomfort clouded his face. "I suppose I deserve it though," he muttered bitterly, body stiffening once again.
He laughs, a quiet laughter of disbelief. “Potter, why do you know the way to the Slytherin common room?”
Theodore wasn't really mad. When they returned back to their dorms at the godawful hour of midnight, he lasted twenty minutes of not talking to Harry, before curiosity got the best of him and he asked, "So, what's inside the egg?"
, of course, to get his nerves and wits together, but that had been done in private, after he had left Kingsley’s Office to ponder about the repercussions of accepting such a mission.
"Oh, God," Ron said, sounding like he was going to be sick. "I think the frog's still jumping in my stomach."
“No,” Ron said automatically in pretty much the same way that Harry did just a few days ago when Harry answered the same question.
Draco’s smirk widened. He sat up, bending his neck from side to side to get rid of the cricks there that had formed during his uncomfortable sleep on Harry’s small sofa. “Hmm?”
They even called up Professor McGonagall through the Floo network. “Horcruxes are made from powerful, vengeful magic, further corrupted by hatred and blood. Something as powerful as that can only be reversed by an equally powerful magic, like
Draco pushed the feelings down. His father fought for him. Lucius almost died going against the Dark Lord.
Viktor Krum turned his shark head towards Harry and nodded once in acknowledgement, before continuing to gracefully swim towards those four silhouettes.
Draco got injured in one of his classes. A second year Ravenclaw boy got his hair-raising potion wrong and he was going to taste it, but Draco intervened. The boy insisted it was done perfectly. They started to “argue”. Draco decided to drink it. He knew he was going to get hurt, but he had to prove his point. It was worse than he thought. He wasn’t able to get the antidote or tell any of the kids to get it for him.
Ron went to Hogwarts to talk with Harry. It was a Thursday, so Harry first class starts until 9 am. Harry was a bit annoyed at Ron for interrupting his sleep, but he forgot about it when Ron started talking.
Once the Hallowe’en celebrations were over, Harry went to his room and took his invisibility cloak, hide it in his robes, and went to Hagrid’s home for a drink in honour of his parents. He took the invisibility cloak because of tradition and nostalgia. He knew he didn’t need it. As a professor he was free to roam the castle at whatever hour he deemed convenient.
Until teddy cried. He was confused and upset because he was being ignored. Like any toddler would’ve been. They looked away and Harry started to make funny faces again.
Viktor Krum went to the game and Draco was annoyed. Viktor didn’t sit next to them for the same reason Hagrid wouldn’t sit next to Olympe, but Draco notice that he would be looking at Harry and then nodded towards them. Draco also wasn’t happy about the fact that Ron and Hermione had made both Harry and Viktor godfathers of Rose. Draco argued that Viktor was already godfather of another Weasley and that it would be too much of a responsibility for him. Hermione just told him to shut up.
“Well, it was a long game, I think it was good. Too bad those Gryffindor kids don’t know math.” -Said Malfoy.
They were walking to the bus stop to get back home, Draco was carrying Teddy who was sleeping. Both Harry and Draco were wearing the Lion King T-shirts they had bought. Harry was carrying the rest of their stuff, both merchandise and the chocolate eggs.
“I don’t know how it can still bother you that we always win. Gryffindors are always on top!”- said Ron.
“I truly regret what I did. If I hadn’t done so, my life would be easier now. Maybe we could’ve been friends.”
A week went by and Harry did not appear on any papers or magazines. It was a relief, but he wondered why they would bother talking about Malfoy and him just being nice to each other, but not about them sleeping in the same place. Neville had asked him about it. Apparently, some very brave Slytherins had asked him If he knew what Professor Potter was doing that night. When Harry explained, Neville just laughed. The idea of Harry and Malfoy being friends was too unusual for him. He still didn’t trust Malfoy. He was worried that he was just using Teddy and Harry to improve the Malfoy family image. His grandmother told him that, and it stuck with him. She told him to warn Harry, but he knew that Harry had probably already thought of that.
Draco and Harry were professionals, but it took a conscious effort for them not to show favouritism towards Teddy.
“He is ignoring his feeling, just as this idiot over here.” Said Pansy. “You should ask him on a date. You both like each other. Why are you complicating things?”
Once they were out of Teddy’s bedroom, Harry followed Draco to the sitting room. At least Kreacher didn’t work that day and they were alone. Harry felt disappointed that they ended up in the sitting room. He almost hit himself on the head for feeling that.
Draco was not able to talk with his friends until the easter holidays. Pansy, Blaise and Draco were meeting quite early at the three broomsticks, Gregory arrived last. So, Draco finally talk with them about what had happened during New Year’s Day.
Before 8 am on Monday, Harry knocked on Draco’s door. Draco let him in to his office and Harry sat next to the fireplace.
Ron thought that Hermione belittle his job. She said that giving joy to both children and adults was an honourable path. This made him feel better. But then she said that even so, her job was more important, because part of her job was to make sure that every creature could enjoy his products and that he could not understand her responsibility.  This made him mad.
“McGonagall chose Professor Fawley to replace her, so she can’t be that bad.” Said Harry once Teddy expressed his disappointment with her.
Draco was the first to action, he went to his old room and hid there. Andromeda approached Narcissa and told her to leave, but he kept quiet. Lucius hugged Teddy, followed by Narcissa. Teddy was upset because they interrupted the game he was playing with Victoire and because she went away to her mom when she saw the Malfoys approach.
“It’s so funny that you are in love with Potter. All those years at Hogwarts finally make sense.” Said Goyle.
By Friday Harry received a letter from Malfoy, saying that they should meet in the Three Broomsticks on Saturday by noon. It didn’t say anything else. Harry’s head was racing with ideas and scenarios of how their meeting would end up. Mostly he was thinking about variations of Malfoy asking him to be a groomsman on the wedding or him talking happily about a new girl he liked.
“I can’t work like this.” Draco began to leave the room. When he was at the door ready to open it, Harry stopped it with his hand. When Draco turned to face him, Harry embraced him. Harry had his face buried in Draco’s chest.
“I am also fine. I was thinking about Astoria and my family. It actually took me some days to figure out that I would never marry Astoria.”
Potter snorts, but grips Draco’s hand firmly and pulls him to his feet. Draco sleepily admires the ease with which he does so. He pokes at Potter’s bicep and finds it firm with solid muscle. “Bloody Aurors”, he mutters, then grabs his book and wanders off to the shelf to return it. When he returns, Potter’s face is as red as Auror robes, and that’s when Draco realises what he’s done.
It’s not injudicious that most Squibs choose to live among Muggles, even though they are of magical folk. At home they have a harder time making money, yet it costs them more to live.
It’ s a cold evening, but not windy. Draco briefly considers the thought of going back to his apartment, but quickly discards it. He’s tired of looking at those four cracked walls, and it’s not as if the apartment will be any warmer than out here. He’s been trying to learn wandless heating charms, but he hasn’t quite gotten the hang of them yet.
“P-Potter, what are you doing?” Draco yelps, clinging to the other man’s shoulders tightly. Potter grins.
The library is only just opening when he arrives and the librarian seems surprised to see him, but smiles and greets him warmly anyway. “My, my, you’re here bright and early,” she says. “Come on in, it’s terribly cold out there.”
Draco flushes. Ah, Potter doesn’t like self-deprecation. He ought to have known, really. Potter is too much of a goody-goody to accept people talking down on themselves like that.
Hunger is urging his stomach into revolt by now, so he quickly fixes himself a plain cheese sandwich and sits in his lone chair to eat it. It’s not a lot, but it sates the worst of the pangs in his stomach and he’s not about to use up more food than he needs to.
Draco scrambles out of bed, tripping over his blanket in his haste to scramble out of his apartment and out into Knockturn. He strikes a fast clip up the Alley, anticipation and apprehension swirling in his gut in a stomach-turning mix.
They play a little game of cat and mouse for a while, if the mouse were taunting the cat by darting around him just out of reach, until Potter gets worn out and returns to his bench. Draco skates up to him, cocking his head to the side.
Potter raises his eyebrows, but lets it go with a “Sure,” before following Draco to the door. A pleasant warmth falls over Draco as they leave, and a glance at Potter shows the other man putting away his wand.
“If I have to go out and buy a healing potion it will take up time,” he says reasonably. “Surely it would be better to just –“
“Umm…” Draco replies intelligently, clutching his book hard and holding ut in front of him like a barrier. He shouldn’t accept, he really shouldn’t. He’s already decided it best that he stay far away from Potter, no matter how cutely he’s behaving at the moment. If Potter remembers who he is, it will ruin everything.
Potter, thankfully, takes that moment to return. He’s laden with two enormous mugs of the most ridiculous hot chocolate, topped with whipped cream and crushed candy canes and chocolate chips and syrup, as well as a plate of biscuits. “Sorry I took so long,” he says, setting one of the drinks down in front of Draco.
Gringotts will take some time – either the goblins dislike him, or else they are simply very busy, he has no way to know – so he returns to his room and strips off his clothes. Shivering against the cold air, he quickly starts up a shower and steps into the hot water with a grateful sigh. He cleans himself quickly, and then, after a moment’s consideration, lathers soap through his hair. His younger self would surely have died at the very idea, and Draco inanely mourns the silky perfection his hair used to be. He shakes himself of the sentiment and dries off roughly with his scratchy towel before dressing in yesterday’s clothes. Another nail for the coffin of his past life.
He’s having fun making little sparkle fireworks when he looks up and sees Harry Potter standing there and staring at him. He lets out a surprised squawk, the sparkles fizzling out unceremoniously.
Draco hums and thinks it over, but something about calling him Harry is too intimate. “Hmm, no, I think I like Potter better,” he decides.
“What on Earth for?” He asks, frowning. He knows what he looks like – he’s seen himself just this morning in the mirror. There is nothing attractive left about him.
Draco blushes at the press of his sturdy shoulder and shoves back at Potter, playful, but also putting a bit more distance between them. It backfires, however, because then Potter laughs and throws an arm over his shoulders.
He glides past Potter, spinning to skate backwards in front of him and smirking. “It seems I’ve bested you Potter,” he says. Potter doesn’t seem too put out – he’s sporting a huge grin as he skates along.
He doesn’t call Potter out on it, though, because he quite frankly wants to get out of the cold as soon as possible. He’s disappointed that they’re parting ways so soon, but he feels as though he’s going to freeze his bollocks off if he stands out here for much longer. “I’ll meet you tomorrow, same time?” He offers to Potter, already turning to head back.
Face heating further, Draco rushes to deflect the attention. He huffs. “Oh yes, by all means Potter, do sit down. Thank you for asking, no I’m not doing anything, I’d love the company, et cetera et cetera.”
Potter has stopped laughing somewhat abruptly, and Draco opens his eyes to see him picking up his mug and taking a huge gulp. He then immediately flails, sputtering “Hot! Hot!” and dripping hot chocolate from his mouth and probably from his nose also.
“Brilliant!” He says eagerly, bouncing slightly on his heels like an overexcited kid. He gestures at Draco’s book. “Let’s get that checked out and we can go,” he says.
He pulls back, letting go of Potter’s waist and catching his strong hands instead. At Potter’s raised eyebrows, Draco smirks. “I can’t in good conscience allow the Saviour of the Wizarding World to continually be bested by some ice, can I?” He asks. Potter groans.
Potter laughs. “Of course,” he replies, as though it’s inconceivable that he won’t want to carry a grown man all the way to wherever they are going. Potter carries him as though he weighs nothing, though, and so Draco tips his head forward to rest it against Potter’s collarbone to hide the heat on his face.
Muggle vehicles race along the street, their lights leaving bright streaks when Draco blinks. Bundled up Muggles walk by, mostly alone or in pairs. They usually stay out of the road but deftly avoid the vehicles when they do cross. Many of them have small boxes that emit a small square of light, and they hold these up to their ears or poke at their lower half intently.
Draco flushes. “Oh…right,” he mutters. “Okay, to stop you turn your toes inward and sort of push out…like this.” He skates a bit away from Potter and demonstrates.
Potter tries gliding toward him and stopping, and nearly falls over again. Draco catches him, laughing. “Allow me,” he says, taking Potter’s hands again. “we’ll continue like this until you get the hang of it, alright?”
s, as he goes. He settles into the same armchair with his book, ready continue where he’d left off yesterday – applying the control he’d learnt in the previous section to simple spells.
Draco goes through the familiar motions of wandlessly casting – closing his eyes, focusing, reaching for his magic. But it slips out of his grasp, and the magic fizzles out with his incantation, lost to the cool air of the room. Frowning, he tries a couple more times, but it doesn’t produce even a spark of warmth.
Draco freezes – can he give Potter his own name? Will that break this anonymity he’s been granted? He’s not sure, and he doesn’t want to chance it.
Draco watches as he chats with the girl at the til and hems and haws over what he wants to buy and drops his money all over the counter, and feels unbearably fond. He can’t help the smile that tugs at his lips, not even when Potter turns around, floating another pair of frothy chocolate monstrosities and two huge cinnamon buns along with him, and sees it. “What is it?” he asks.
Today is particularly freezing in fact. Draco showers for the couple of minutes of warmth he can steal, then bundles up in all of his outdoor clothes. He fishes out the one book he has – a sappy romance novel that he’d found under the bed when he’d moved in – and settles himself on the bed, wrapped in his blanket, to read it for the umpteenth time.
Draco shakes his head. “You keep feeding me sweets. I think you’re trying to make me fat,” he fusses jokingly, while eagerly tearing off a piece of cinnamon bun.
The presence answers, but not verbally. Its words seem to reverberate all around him, and within Draco’s own head.
Potter soon comes back, levitating a mug of something steaming, that’s topped generously with whipped cream, and a freshly toasted bagel in front of him. It’s soon followed by a platter of pastries that slides into place between them. Draco blinks at these and then looks questioningly up at him. “What are these then?” he asks. Potter flushes.
“Emory! Hi,” it says. Draco’s eyes dart up from sheer force of habit – he’s never been able to ignore Potter – and he jumps slightly when he finds the other man standing right there, looking directly at him.
He finds his usual book, double-checks the index to make sure that it covers spell potency, and then carries it back to his armchair. He means to study until Potter arrives, but he only gets about three hours in before his interrupted sleep and the warmth of the library get to him.
His life really has gone to shite, and it’s not as though he doesn’t deserve it but that doesn’t make it any easier to deal with. He thinks about his past self, of that carefree, spoilt child that he’d been, and mourns for him. He wishes he could go back to that time and stay there, suspended in cruel ignorance forever. Some days, he wishes he’d died at the Battle of Hogwarts, gotten caught up in the Fiendfyre after all or perhaps been caught by a stray curse on the battlefield, or sentenced to death by the Ministry. Surely it would be preferable to struggling to eke out the miserable existence he has now.
“Right, no, of course,” says Potter, scratching at the back of his head. He shuffles awkwardly from foot to foot, before he asks, “Shall we get going then?”
Confused, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out considerably more coin than he’s just put in. It takes a moment for it to click, but then the events of yesterday come rushing back.
Draco flushes and looks down at his ratty boots. “I – ah – haven’t really learnt self-contained spells yet,” he mutters, embarrassed.
Forsythe glares at him and snaps “Just go! How many times have I told you not to stick your pointy little nose into my store?”
Draco pulls his head back and closes the door, rolling his eyes. It’s not as if a customer will see him now that the store’s closed, so he doesn’t bother heeding Forsythe’s request. It’s in his best interest to ensure that Forsythe can’t pretend that Draco’s ducked out early.
Draco stiffens. What can he say? He doesn’t know what might trigger Potter into remembering him. “There isn’t much to tell,” he says eventually, staring unseeingly at his book.
“Oh my god, are you alright? I’m so sorry!” Says Potter in that voice that has never failed to make Draco shiver. Hearing it now in person is even more spine-tingling. Large, strong hands come up to brush away the snow now covering Draco’s coat and hair, and Draco’s entire body heats with entwined desire and mortification.
Potter gives a self-conscious little smile. “I was almost pissing myself giving all those speeches,” he confesses. “Hermione kept giving me these massive packages of information – nearly seventy inches once, double sided! And I was supposed to include it all in my speeches. Most of the time I went up in front of the Wizengamot and completely blanked.”
“If you change your mind just let me know,” she says, and totters off. Draco looks after her retreating back and wonders when libraries have started selling tea. He’s certainly never received such an offer from a librarian before, though he’s spent a lot of time in libraries.
He lifts the heavy volume from the shelf, carrying it over to a nearby armchair and side-table pair, setting the book down on the side-table before quickly divesting himself of his coat and gloves and draping them over the back of the chair. He settles himself into the armchair, letting out a little groan as even the comfortable plush makes his already sore arse twinge. Stupid Potter, running over innocent passersby in the street.
He decides to wash his hair again today – it’s a warmer day, which means less effort to dry it, and he’s not about to waste that. He is quick and efficient in the shower, as usual, and he dresses first before sitting on the bed and holding his hands up to his head. He concentrates, feeling for his magic and pulling it to his will, and he could swear that the charm comes easier to him today as it leaps to his instruction and surrounds his head with warm air.
He shakes away the self-reproach after a moment. It’s not as though he’s seeking Potter out or forcing his company on him. Isn’t it worse at this point to start blowing Potter off now, to his face? Surely it’s kinder for Emory to just disappear one day.
“Goodbye Potter,” he insists instead. Potter opens his mouth to argue, but at that moment Granger emerges from the stacks and catches sight of them. She makes a beeline toward Potter, and Draco nods a greeting at her and steps out of the way. He catches sight of Potter’s pout in the corner of his eye and grins to himself, feeling lighter than he has in years as he makes his way back to the wandless magic section.
Potter laughs. “It’s a new blend, very high in demand. This is the only shop in Britain that carries it, because it’s so bloody expensive, but Hermione and the owner… don’t exactly get along.” Draco raises an eyebrow, curious as to what Granger has possibly done. “Hermione took very public umbrage to Walker’s use of Sicilian Silk Bat silk,” Potter explains. “It’s lucky any of us are allowed in here at all.”
“Yes, let’s,” says Draco. He rises gracefully from his seat, then turns to smirk at Potter as a thought occurs to him. “By the way Potter, it did not escape my notice that you’ve come here an hour early. I wonder if it isn’t you who’s eager to see me?”
Draco self-consciously tugs his hat lower. What is she getting his picture for? Could she be an undercover Auror who has somehow recognized him? But no…she’s not familiar to him. He doesn’t see how she would be able to recognize him on sight without him at least doing the same. Maybe he’s just dressed funny for a Muggle and she wants to laugh at it later. He doesn’t think so, based on what he sees them wearing, but who knows what the unifying Muggle theme is?
“The Wizengamot thought so,” Potter agrees. He looks pleased with himself as he crosses his arms behind his head and leans back in his chair. The move reveals a tantalizing strip of golden skin at his belly that draws Draco’s attention.
“Oops,” says Potter sheepishly, sitting up and shaking snow out of his hair. There’s still plenty caught in the thick thatch, though, and he just looks ridiculous.
The girl must catch his frown, as she rolls her eyes and shares a conspiratorial look with him. “Christmas music is the worst right?” She asks. Draco shrugs.
"I don’t care about that either, you can do whatever you want with that boy. I know Astoria won’t care either.” Interrupted his father.
Anything more than that could ruin the relationship they have now, anything more would be odd. It is nice, what they have.
On Draco’s side the issue was mostly the implications of their family name being lost, and that it was Harry Potter. The boy who ruined everything for them. He killed their leader. He made them live with shame. Draco’s friends were actually enjoying the attention they were receiving. Pansy and Blaise were smart enough not to give any important information, but enough to get exclusive interviews. Goyle never gave good answers, so they left him alone.
By Friday, he had forgotten most of what he told the students. At lunch, he received a letter from Malfoy. It said:
“Are you pretending to be Harry’s friend so that people will treat you better? - asked Ron, looking at Malfoy’s eyes.
He tore the envelope slowly. He didn’t want to read bad news. He wasn’t ready. He wasn’t brave enough to face it. Maybe something happened to both Teddy and Andromeda and that’s why it was Malfoy writing. He opened it.
They got into the bus, it was a ride of about half an hour, with 14 stops. There were only about 6 other persons on the bus. On their third stop, three men a little older than them got in. Two of them sat in front of Harry and Draco, and one sat on the seat next to them. They didn’t say anything, just stared at them for 3 stops. Draco moved Teddy a little so he could put his hand on his pocket, ready to take his wand out.
They stayed in manly silence until Hermione arrived. She gave Ron tickets to the entire British and Irish Quidditch League Cup as a present. She didn’t mention she got them thanks to Viktor Krum. She was smart like that.
When the feast was over, the professors left, and the prefects took the kids to their dormitories. Draco and McGonagall left together, and Harry followed them.
He didn’t think anyone could be better than Lee Jordan. Last time Harry saw him was at a Death Eater’s trial, as a witness. Ron told him that he is now working with George, doing the fun stuff, creating and testing new products.
He started talking with the kids on Monday. His first class was with the Slytherin and Gryffindor first years, and it was fine. Not one of those kids had lost someone during the war. They were asking all kinds of questions: “why did you hide for two years? Why did you defend some Death Eaters? Why did you reject a job in the ministry? Are you single? Were you afraid? Do you feel guilty? Didn’t you want to be an Auror?”
“My boy let me tell you something.”- She said, before getting the butterbeers. - “I know you are a good person who’s nice to everybody. But why that Malfoy boy? You know he put me under the imperius curse…”
“Is that it? Your ex-girlfriend is younger, and statistically arranged marriages are more successful.”- Said Malfoy, pretending to be serious. Harry sighed. – “I know Teddy and Andromeda are fine. How are you?”
suggestions, that were actually treats, from almost everywhere in the wizarding world. The school accepted unwillingly. They announced that from the school year of 2009, they would accept muggle-borns.
Ginny and Luna were also living at the Leaky Cauldron, renting a room until they could save enough money to buy a house. Both of their families, which included Harry, had tried to give them money to help them out, but they, mostly Ginny, refused.
“Maybe we should go somewhere else…”-said Harry – “Somewhere with less tattling people.”- he said, loudly enough that the people near them stopped talking.
“But maybe driving with all the London traffic wasn’t the best idea, considering we could have used magic instead.” Said Draco, as a car cut them off.
Once in the kitchen, Draco put Teddy’s quiz on the fridge with a London souvenir magnet. On the small table there were plates with proper food, which were mostly ignored in favour of the birthday cake and the treacle tart.
“Dinner is served. In the kitchen, as always.”- said Kreacher, who was still confused about why both Harry and Draco preferer the kitchen over the dining room.
After the first week of classes Teddy could tell that his favourite class was transfigurations. The professor was also sorted into Hufflepuff, so he felt attached to her. For the first week, professor Fawley was his favourite. He didn’t mention it to Harry and Draco.
“Oh, how silly, there is no such thing a real magic.” Said Harry, looking at Teddy, trying to tell him with his eyes to stop talking.
“Weasley, do you want to transform me into a ferret? Or make me throw up slugs. I can wear a silly dress for as long as you want, you can hit me on the face…I don’t care. If gaining the trust of every friend of Potter means that my relationship with Teddy will be easier, then I will do it. I don’t want him to grow up listening how bad I am from people that are close to him.”
“And what if he was?”- asked Harry, putting an arm around Draco. - “Would that be a problem for you?”
Hermione was the first to leave. She wanted to sleep early so she could go to work on Sunday. She didn’t have to do it, but Shacklebolt went to work two Sundays a month and she felt she had to help him.
His first class was at 8 am, so Teddy was a little sleepy. Draco had to reprimand him for yawning, but only because he had already done the same with another kid, and also for not taking notes. During Harry’s class Teddy was morphing his hair and his head, and eventually changed his appearance to look like Harry. He was disturbing the class, distracting the kids. Harry warned him. Two times. By the third time he had to give him detention. He felt awful. There was not much to do during the first day, so it was basically Teddy cleaning Harry’s office the muggle way, but it was already quite clean. Also, Harry wouldn’t allow him to talk, to show him this wasn't a game.
“Your father is a brilliant man. He found a loophole.” Said Narcissa. “He couldn’t get his wand back, though.”
The interview was about how quidditch players could help the protection of nargles with simple actions, like cleaning their brooms more often. The interview featured quotes from Harry like: “Well, my boyfriend and I like to clean our broomsticks, so we unconsciously have helped the cause of nargle survival.” And “I encourage every player to pay attention to the bludgers, I’m sure I’ve seen a couple of nargles hiding in them during my games.” It also had quotes from Draco: “I never noticed any nargles when I played, but it was mostly due to the fact that I was staring at my boyfriend, Harry. He always was faster than me so I had the perfect view.” and “I used to clean my broom quite often, but I haven’t play much since my school years.”
It was a good couple of weeks for him to spend with Teddy. They spent a lot of time playing with some new products made by Ron, which resulted in Kreacher having to fix up many rooms at Grimmauld Place. “They need master Malfoy back.” Was all Kreacher kept muttering.
“We both have mourned their deaths before.”- said Harry, remembering the days Andromeda would go to Grimmauld Place when he didn’t leave the house.
“They all love him. The kids. He’s patient with all of them. A bit sombre at times, but the kids won’t be intimidated so easily.”- said Harry, smiling. - “You know he hasn’t given any detention yet?”
Ron and George were the ones who had the most fun with Draco the ferret. Specially Ron. Hermione took him into her office at the ministry for a couple of days and Harry had him for one day to show it to his younger students.
“I can do magic. I know how to pull a coin from someone’s ear, I’m good at it. Grandpa Vernon almost fainted from how good I was.” she said proudly.
Teddy brought them back to reality. He wanted to go home because he was already tired. Narcissa suggested they could stay for the night. “But I want my bed at Harry’s home.” Was Teddy response and it was enough of a reason for Narcissa.
For the first two weeks of August, Andromeda and Narcissa decided to go to America. Andromeda just wanted to get Narcissa away from Lucius and Narcissa wanted Andromeda to meet single American wizards. Draco was supposed to visit his father during that time. He didn’t. What he did was get his father a subscription to the Quibbler to keep him entertained.
“Why is it a good thing that I’m not going to marry Astoria?” – Asked Malfoy, smiling. He was getting amused.
“Draco, we are adults. I know it doesn’t seem like it, but we are. If something goes wrong between us, we will work it out. You and I could overcome anything, please.”
For the second to last quidditch game at Hogwarts, Viktor Krum was the referee. It was his birthday. On Sunday he was having an exhibition game against Scotland, so, against his team coach’s advice, he decided to visit his friends before his game. Only Harry and Draco were at the game, but after the Quidditch match, they went to Ron and Hermione’s home to eat cake.
“No, we told him he could only look, not buy.” Said Draco, looking at Teddy who was roaming around the store.
Hermione was six months pregnant by then, and she was trying to spend more time with her family and friends. She would write letter to the people she couldn’t meet personally. This meant more work for her. She didn’t look tired, so Ron decided not to say anything. In the end she was busier than usual.
“We will keep it a secret. But don’t bother me anymore.” Said Draco. His parents didn’t answer, Lucius went away followed by Narcissa. “What was that?” Draco was holding back tears.
“What I get out of this…” said Harry after Draco told him what happened. “is that your father would be fine with me being your mistress. Well, I don’t know the equivalent for men…”
“I don’t know yet, Malfoy, I haven’t seen the whole house.”- Said Harry, sort of lying, because he did like what he had seen.
Harry couldn’t think much after this. At least not clearly. So many thoughts came to his head at once that he decided to ignore every thought. It was not the time to think, so he just kept staring at the ground. Draco on the other hand payed attention to each thought he had after this. He was trying to clear his head, but the alcohol wasn’t helping. The most comforting thought in Draco’s mind was that whatever Harry was feeling, at least it wasn’t anger. Draco began to hope, but that was the thought he did ignore.
“Well, they are not happy. They said they rather be in Azkaban than be in debt with you.”-said Hyperion. - “But I have told them you are all right, at least as a professor.”- he said, omitting the part where his parents got angry at him for defending “the man who got his father fired.”
March went by quickly. Hermione wrote a short letter back to Harry. She explained the importance of theory for a good practice of witchcraft and wizardry. But still, she assured him she will bring up the issue with the Ministry. Harry visited Teddy every weekend and got the spend time with the Weasleys.
Hermione came back to the dining room with a small suitcase. “I’m probably in labour, let’s go to the hospital.” She said, giving her suitcase to Ron.
“You are older than me...I can’t believe I’m 21, that’s how old my parents were when they died. I would have liked it if Andromeda let Teddy stay with us today.”
“The Ministry said Lucius was going to spend his life in house arrest, why would they change their minds so soon. I need to talk with Hermione.” Harry started talking.
The couple took Teddy to Weasley & Weasley. Ron was at the register next to an employee who was counting money, he smiled and waved at his friends when he saw them. There were only two customers and they were already leaving. They had the store for themselves. Convenient privacy, Draco thought.
“Are you having an affair with Viktor Krum?” asked Ron once they were both in their bed ready to sleep.
Molly tried not to be all over Harry. She knew he should spend more time with Ron, but she couldn’t help hugging him every time she could. Eventually they all were sitting together again. The only Weasley that wasn’t there was Charlie. He had to work now, so he could come for Christmas and new year’s, Molly told him.
“Yeah, you are right, I was never a good enough wizard to be a real threat. I’m glad I was so useless.”
Eventually Teddy was done with his homework and he began to play with Harry and Draco. Mostly Harry. Draco was so deep in thought that he was practically ignoring them. Harry noticed this and decided it was time to talk with Teddy. Draco stopped worrying about his father to start worrying about what Teddy would say.
“You could sell this in the muggle word. Instant hungover cure.” -said Harry once the burning feeling ended and he started feeling more awaked and filled with energy.
Draco gave up and decided to follow Harry into their room. Kreacher was outside the room in the hallway just so he could wish them a good night sleep, he also promised to look after Teddy. "He is such a nice kid." he had said. “I think he was ulterior motives” said Draco. “No, he just likes Teddy.” Answered Harry, getting the door open to let Draco in.
“Are you saying, that if Draco were a good cook, he would be perfect?”- asked Ron, trying to make fun of Harry.
Now, Draco and Blaise. They both wanted something, so they figure out they might as well give it a try. For about a year they’ve been meeting once every two weeks. It really started because Draco’s father wanted to marry him of to Astoria Greengrass. She wasn’t as bad as other women from the “sacred twenty-eight” but that wasn’t the point. He would never like her. It also coincided with the fact that Blaise was having trouble trusting women, so he thought with men it could be different. But first, he needed to figure out if he liked it. And he did. Draco just wanted to know more about himself.
The professors had to visit Hermione at the Ministry. She had her own office, and it was full of books and papers and magical objects Harry has never seen before, but they were, sadly, familiar to Draco. They were sitting in front of her desk, waiting for Hermione to stop reading a scroll, which she then signed and made it vanish with her wand.
Draco walked two blocks away from Grimmauld Place into an alley, he sat on the dirty floor and began to cry. He hated himself, but he knew he didn’t deserve any happiness. Still, he wanted it. He wanted Harry. But Harry wouldn’t want him in the long run. He missed his only chance with Harry Potter. What was he thinking? He ruined it all. The one time he needed time to think and he just said the first though in his mind. What will he do now? He couldn’t go to his family, and his friends wouldn’t have time for him on the 1 of January. He deserved to go through this alone. That was his line of thought.
“Finally.” Said Neville, standing up to pat Harry on the back. “I guess I’m going to leave now, let you two lovebirds talk, alone.”
. He decided he was going to be fashionable late. He didn’t want to be rude to Narcissa, but he didn’t want to seem eager.
He spends several hours there, reading theory and running through the practice exercises in the book. They’re not spells, not really, just exercises to learn to handle his magic better, and they’ve nothing to do with heat besides, so he’s not particularly worried about starting fires. They are, after all, designed for beginners, and therefore start small. A pleasant result of this, he finds, is that he’s not exhausted or hungry after practicing. Well… okay, he is hungry because he’s always hungry, but he’s not more so than usual.
“I had wondered,” he says instead, laughing, and Draco is struck again by how handsome Potter is. He swallows nervously and, to distract himself, takes a pastry and pops it into his mouth. It’s good – incredible really – flaky, buttery, and filled with sweet cream. Draco can’t help his moan, closing his eyes in pleasure. Merlin, and he’d just wanted a bagel!
“I thought we agreed that we were not going to kill me,” he objects, smacking Potter’s shoulder. Potter looks sheepish.
Draco looks down at where Potter’s hand curls around his, hesitant. He remembers the days when he could throw money like this around, like it was nothing. He knows that, for Potter, this is little more than a drop in the bucket. But still, to him it’s not nothing. It’s significant. It’s bloody lifechanging. He’d be a fool to turn it down.
He doesn’t even notice drifting off, but he finds himself waking sometime later, comfortable and warm enough that he almost falls back asleep. Then he sees Potter, sitting in his summoned armchair and watching him, and that startles him enough that he stops drowsing. “Creepy, Potter,” he mumbles, blinking and rubbing his eyes to clear the bleariness. “Do you make it a habit to watch people sleep?”
There’s a moment of waiting, then the door is yanked open and Draco is face to face with his boss – Edgar Forsythe Charles, a short, squat, beady-eyed man with a pencil thin moustache and oil-slicked black hair. “Malfoy,” he barks. “What have I told you about disturbing me?”
Draco flushes. No way is Potter seeing his hovel. “We can meet here,” he replies. Potter wilts a little but smiles anyway.
With the money put away for the night, he turns to his final task of wiping down the counter, humming a tune that had been playing on the wireless earlier as he works. He picks up a crumpled-up bag that Forsythe had left on the corner, expecting it to be garbage, but to his surprise he finds that there is some weight to it. Confused, he peers inside and finds that Forsythe has discarded a pair of bagels.
“Good morning,” he replies, waving his hello. That’s the extent of their daily conversation, so he goes on to browse the shelves.
“I know,” says Draco without thinking, then clamps his mouth shut, eyes widening. Luckily, Potter doesn’t seem suspicious.
Draco stills, mentally slapping himself. Of course, he’s being a bloody idiot! It hasn’t even occurred to him but… nobody recognizes him any longer. He doesn’t have to sit alone in this freezing apartment. He can go anywhere! There is the little issue of him not having any money to contend with, but not every place he can go will need him to buy something.
Draco collapses back against his bed with a tired sigh, dropping his head into his hand. Thankfully the botched charm had still managed to warm the room back to a slight chill before it escaped his control. He’s used up his final extinguisher, however, which will be a problem once the charm inevitably wears away. He daren’t recast without it. Getting another, however, means visiting bloody Ugbert.
Potter begins to look sheepish. “We can’t use warming charms on the ice,” he says, scratching the back of his head nervously, “I figured if we’re going to go skating, you’ll need a warmer kit.”
“Save us a table,” says Potter as he joins the large queue waiting at the counter. Draco winds his way through the little shop, finding an empty two-top near a window at the back. He quickly snags a seat and turns to watch the brightly-lit Muggle street curiously.
Draco inwardly rolls his eyes at him self and pops a bite of bagel into his mouth. “Well, good to know those glasses are good for something then,” he says at length, far too late. Potter doesn’t call him out on it, though his green eyes are amused as he sips his hot chocolate.
Before him, a figure blinks into existence. It at once looks human and not, bright and glowing with a shifting iridescence that makes it impossible to place. Draco startles and stumbles backward.
He thinks back to the incident with a frown, his mind drawing, with loving detail, the solid form that had bowled him over. Merlin, but he’d looked good. Draco’s heard his voice often over the years – Potter is, to this day, a darling of the media and is often featured on the wireless – but he hasn’t seen him since the end of the war. Clearly, time has treated Potter as well as it’s treated Draco badly. He’d already been arresting in school, a wild magnetism to him that had always drawn Draco’s attention – and now he’s grown into it, wearing that pull with an innate ease. Auror work has filled out his frame, his muscles just discernable under his robes and certainly felt when he was barrelling into Draco, and he’s lost the general air of confusion he’d had as a boy. During their brief interaction he’d seemed capable, powerful...
Giving up on the mirror, he goes over to his little stove and fiddles with it, trying to coax it to life. It takes a minute but, against all odds, turns on. Draco inwardly cheers. He’s going to be expending energy today, if he’s to go skating, and he hadn’t eaten yesterday. It most certainly won’t do to faint in front of Potter just because his stove won’t cooperate.
This might be the last update at this pace - my vacation ends tomorrow and I'll be writing much slower after that :(
He cuts himself off with a shake of his head. “I’ve become carried away. Forgive me Potter. I simply meant to say that even if there are no laws making Squibs lives harder, that doesn’t mean that they’re treated well by society. It’s the same for vampires.”
So his day goes, until just after the library clock strikes 2 o’clock. That’s when Potter and Granger show up. Draco doesn’t see them, but he hears their voices, easily recognizable from being so often on the wireless – Granger is chattering about wizarding law and magical creates, and Potter is humouring her with one-word answers. Draco’s head shoots up, pure panic searing through his veins.
“Likewise,” Draco answers stiffly, collecting his potion and money pouch to his coat pocket. He tugs his hood over his head and hurries back out into the street, relieved to be away from the old pervert.
He toasts himself a couple of slices of bread, eating them dry, and boils some water that he pretends is tea. Then he heads to the library, where he and Potter are to meet.
“I’ll take it,” he says hurriedly, pulling his coin pouch from his boot. He counts out twelve Galleons, inwardly wincing at the amount as he places them onto the counter.
“Have a good day,” he wishes her. She returns the sentiment and Draco heads out back into the rundown Muggle street with the noisy, flimsy Muggle sack hanging from his arm.
“Hello,” he replies. He maybe sounds a bit too eager to talk to her, because the girl gives him a strange look as she takes his items and begins ringing them up. Draco doesn’t say any more, just watches curiously as she enters his purchases into her glowing till. From somewhere up in the ceiling, a wireless plays a Muggle tune that he doesn’t recognize.
Draco pushes inside, the bells above the door tinkling to announce his arrival, and steps into a dark room that is empty of another human presence.
He thinks about pulling away from Potter – he’s really thrown this ‘staying away’ thing out the window – but it’s still freezing out and Potter is decidedly warm. “Sorry for all that Potter. Very embarrassing of me,” he says, making no move to dislodge Potter’s arm from his shoulders.
Potter is silent again, and when Draco looks up, it’s to green eyes smiling down at him. He looks away, flustered, and something glinting in the street ahead of them catches his eye.
Draco curses quietly, but stops and turns to her. “Here,” he says brusquely, shoving the bag of bagels at her. He doesn’t wait for her thanks – he doesn’t want it, not really. She calls it after his back anyway, and the sincere gratitude in it gives him pause. Somehow, he doesn’t feel too bad, even as he goes home and toasts the last of his frozen bread.
“Potter,” Draco sighs, shaking his head, “if you’re to be banished from stores on Granger’s account, surely you ought at least to know why?” Potter shrugs, unrepentant.
He chooses the little round table nearest to the front window and sits, looking out at the twinkling street. Once upon a time, he would have looked down on a place like this. Now, he barely feels that he belongs, with his holey gloves and tattered, baggy clothes. He privately thanks Potter’s apparently overly active sense of remorse that’s led to him being here.
Satisfied, he tosses the card into his little bin and tucks the money back into the pouch, pocketing the lot before heading out of the rundown apartment complex. He stops on the street just outside, taking a deep breath before deliberately lowering his hood. He waits there a moment, tensed, but nobody pays him any mind.
They walk down the same streets as they had yesterday, and Potter directs him to a charming little park that looks like something out of a picture book, all strung up with lights that twinkle against the snow and alive with people. The ice rink is a main feature, at least in winter, occupying a place of honour right at the centre. It’s surrounded by benches and a couple of tiny warming huts, and there’s a stand selling beverages and warm treats off to one side.
It brings all sorts of longing thoughts to Draco’s mind, and he banishes them furiously. There’s nothing there, not for him– although, perhaps he should go to a bar one of these days while nobody recognizes him, pull a cute somebody he’ll never see again, and get a good dicking down. Merlin knows it’s been long enough. Although – Draco grimaces – it might not be as easy as it once was to turn someone’s head. Draco had been attractive in school, he has no illusion otherwise, but little sleep and less food is not a good look on him.
Then another burst of wind gusts through his shitty coat, threatening to freeze his skin. Draco hifts from foot to foot and does his best to hold himself still. Without Potter against him to warm him, it is impossibly cold. The very idea of skating like this is unthinkable.
Potter smiles. “It’s my pleasure,” he says. His eyes are very green, and very, very intense, warm as they meet Draco’s own. Draco flushes again and looks down, breaking his gaze. His fingers fumble, unusually graceless as he does up the buttons and slips of his threadbare gloves, making sure to tug down his sleeves to prevent the Mark from showing. The new gloves are not charmed, but they are fur-lined and unbelievably soft.
“Sorry to bother you,” says the otter contritely in Granger’s voice, “but Ron’s got a work emergency and Rosie fell of a table and hurt her leg. I have to take her to St. Mungo’s, but Walker’s is getting that new wool I wanted to get for Molly today and I’m afraid they’re going to sell out. I’m terribly sorry to ask, but can you please pick some up for me? Just a skein of each colour please.”
Potter’s eyes widen, and he brings his hands up in front of him placatingly. “It’s not pity, I swear!” He says. “It’s kind of self-serving, actually. I wanted to spend more time out on the ice that’s all. Like I said, think of it as an early Christmas present.”
“I always knew the Falcons had potential!” He proclaims loudly. “They just needed the right push. Good job that new bird joined and whipped them into shape.” Draco rolls his eyes. The ‘new bird’ – Ginny Weasley – has been with the team for over three years now. The customer opines that the Magpies are going to take back the title, and Draco tunes out the conversation as light bickering ensues.
Potter laughs at him and waves his hand. “Oh go on then, continue your mastery of the wandless arts,” he says. Draco lowers the book slightly to glower at him, but it only makes Potter laugh more. Which, in turn, only makes his blush worse really, because Potter is unfairly attractive – especially so when he laughs.
He remains silent a moment too long, or else Potter senses his hesitance, and he backs off a little. “Okay, don’t worry about the childhood stories then,” he says. “How about… your favourite winter activity?”
It still doesn’t feel right, though, and the easy smile on Potter’s handsome face when he returns to the other man makes his stomach twist with shame. He frowns and resolves to kindly rebuff any future invites from Potter.
Draco agrees wholeheartedly, and he follows Potter out of the store. “What is the story with this wool then?” He asks as they walk. “Surely Granger could get them to hold it for her? Being a great important war hero and all”
Draco flushes, embarrassed. He doesn’t want Potter to know how pathetic he is, having not even a wand to his name. But Potter is looking at him expectantly.
Hoping fervently that the sun brings with it some warmth, Draco leaves the bathroom and approaches his little kitchen corner. He looks at the stove critically – he is going skating later, which will use up energy, but he also ate yesterday. He waffles for a moment, drumming his fingers on his little folding table, but decides against it. He’s probably going to have to beg off early due to the cold anyhow. Food can wait for tomorrow.
He’s meant to meet Potter today for ice skating, and he shivers at he very prospect. Hopefully, the weather warms up by then – his clothes aren’t all too warm as it is, and skating about at any speed is sure to make it worse. It would be terribly embarrassing if he has to beg off skating early because he’s cold.
Forsythe gives an oily smirk. “Get to it then,” he says, “and don’t think of shirking out. If you’re not back by noon you’re fired.” Then he sweeps off back into the front room, leaving Draco standing there, trembling with anger.
So, he swallows his anger and turns with a sigh to return to the chilly street. With the requirement to return by noon, there is no time to go to St. Mungo’s, and neither is there a guarantee that he’ll be seen there. That depends on who’s in front when he goes in, and which Healer he ends up with.
Potter looks frustrated though. He opens his mouth and turns to look at Draco, and then frowns. He glances between Draco and the otter a couple of times, and then finally says “Alright Hermione, I’ll get the wool.”
It is a harder task than one might anticipate. Wand movements are meant to replicate the runic base of spells, so casting without them means one must use the magic itself to shape the spell, and then control and guide the magic to form the effect as well. Draco considers himself fortunate for his upbringing – his parents had taught him much about wandlore, and he doesn’t think he will have managed to muddle through figuring out wandless heating charms on his own without that knowledge. The book has more techniques and suggestions for doing this, though, and Draco is excited to practice.
They go to the coffee shop from the other day, and Potter pulls open the door for Draco once more. He thanks him, smiling to himself as he walks in. Potter follows him in and sends Draco to get a seat again – even though the café is still empty – while he goes up to the front counter.
He makes his way to a familiar isle, picking out a loaf of bread from the many available. Then he turns and surveys the store, pondering what he should spend the extra bit of money he’d left Ugbert’s with yesterday on. It’s not a lot more money, but it’s enough for him to pick up a small square of cheese that he can use for sandwiches and, on a whim, a packet of those flavoured noodles that can be boiled.
It’s with great trepidation that he pauses at the entrance to Diagon. He knows, logically – or illogically, as the case may be – that he won’t be hurt there. That nobody will recognize him if he steps out of Knockturn’s shadow into the bright street of Diagon. It’s one thing to know this, however, and another to believe it, and Draco can’t stop the fear that curls icy fingers up his spine.
“I do,” says Potter seriously. “You should have seen Robards’ face when I went up to him and asked, I’d like to take my vacation now you ugly bastard.”
It’s hard to focus enough to cast wandlessly when it’s this cold, which is just counterproductive really, but it’s not as though Draco hasn’t faced days this cold before. He inhales a shivering breath, ignoring his trembling as much as possible and endeavouring to block out the chill, as he reaches down into his magic.
But Draco has had a lot of practice working with his magic, and many of these concepts come easily to him now. He feels he’s progressing though the book faster than he would ordinarily, had he not spent so much time reaching into himself and trying to guide his own magic.
Draco raises an eyebrow of his own and looks pointedly around the empty café. “That may be a hardship, what with this crowd, but I’ll try my very best,” he cheeks. Potter outright laughs at that.
But no. Draco shakes his head. That is child’s talk. There is no such thing as wish magic. Probably, he’d just overexerted himself casting that last healing charm, and he’s actually sleeping right now and having a particularly realistic dream. Frowning, Draco reaches down and pinches his inner elbow. “Ouch”, he hisses – no, that hurts, he probably isn’t dreaming. Perhaps he’d just stepped into the Alley at a time where everyone passing by just happened not to know of him or his role in the war? Ugbert must have had some other reason not to try to grope Draco, or extort him for extra coin – maybe there had been an inspector in the back room or- or-
Belatedly, he realises Potter’s saying something to him. “Sorry?” He asks. His face is going to be permanently red at this point.
“If your flaws continue buying me hot chocolate and pastries, I might just be persuaded,” he returns easily. He sips at said hot chocolate to make his point and smirks at Potter.
As he’d eaten more yesterday than he has in recent memory (thank you Potter), he decides to skip breakfast today. With no more reason to dawdle, Draco cheerfully lets himself out of his apartment. He’s in high spirits as he makes his way up Knockturn and into Diagon, and he twirls happily in the light snow that’s started up. He’s sure to be attracting some strange looks, acting like an overgrown child as he is, but he can’t bring himself to care. The festive décor festooning Diagon Alley lifts his spirits further, and he takes his time walking along the street, gazing around him and joyfully taking in the holiday spirit on display. By the time he reaches the library, it’s nearing noon.
