“And I’m sure they thought it up all on their own,” he continues bitterly. “So Hagrid will go to jail for a crime he didn’t commit – again, according to you – while Hermione lays petrified, and your father what? Pats himself on the back?”
Harry doesn’t bother to hide his grin. Nerve is something he has an abundance of, often against his own best judgements and several people’s suggestions. “Thanks. Can you do me a favor?”
“Er,” he looks at the merpeople, “I’ll be right back, okay?”
“Let’s go!” Ron says, grabbing each of their hands and pulling them away.
He’d seen how Draco was dressed during dinner, entirely
Draco is laying across his bed, his transfiguration book open in front of him, but he can’t focus. Abigail is curled around the top of his poster bed, and Nagini is a familiar weight draped across his legs, so he’s not in any danger of being disturbed. The only one brave enough to irritate Nagini is Voldemort, and thankfully the Dark Lord hasn’t yet bothered to pay a visit to Draco’s room, which can only be counted as a good thing.
Hermione crosses her arms, scraping her teeth of her bottom lip. “Okay. Okay. Neither perfect, nor wonderful, just the least horrible option. Fine. But I’m going to look for a better way to do this. There has to be another way for house elves to survive, and I’m going to find it.”
Ah, there’s that blush again. “Shut up. Please.”
He’s going to take Dumbledore and dunk him into the Great Lake for the giant squid to eat. “Well, you just interrupted a conversation that was of a rather personal nature between me and my boyfriend, so you can get over it.”
“He joined those psychopaths who ended up killing so many of our friends, you mean,” Sirius says.
On one hand, Draco spent the night with his boyfriend and he didn’t get back until nearly dawn, so he’s exhausted. On the other hand, he spent the night with his boyfriend, so who gives a shit, really.
wear, that he kind of wants to wear, but circumstances had prevented him before now.
He flushes. “My cousin Caligula is on the board, remember? She’s, uh, mentioned it a time or two. She’s a diviner, and she’s pretty good. She’s not interested in teaching, otherwise she might be able to wrestle the position from Trelawney. But she does kind of consider it an insult that one of the most highly respected educational institutions in the magical world has such an abysmal divination department. We’re apparently the punchline of a joke in Haiti, but she won’t tell me what the joke is.”
, faster than it makes any sort of sense for him to be. He loves magic.
The warm feeling in his chest lasts until Tonks says, “Who’s going to tell Remus and Sirius that Harry astral projected? Because it’s not going to be me.”
Nagini is curled in front of his parents’ room, all twenty feet of her coiled and ready to attack. Oddly, she’s facing the hallway, which doesn’t make much sense. If she’s there to keep his parents in, she should be facing the door. Or maybe she just assumes her presence is enough of a deterrent that it really doesn’t matter where she is in relation to their door, which is correct. Her lost few seconds from facing the wrong direction don’t mean much when no one would be stupid enough to harm Voldemort’s pet snake.
Draco came prepared. He’d brought six copies of the paper, so none of them would have to share. Harry thinks maybe he should have brought more, since Ron’s is getting crumpled in his fist. He says, “I didn’t know we were sleeping together, Hermione. I wish you would have told me.”
Blaise tips down his sunglasses to stare at him. “Well, we own the
is she going to do? Give make up tips and help girls fix up their hair? She doesn’t seem the type. She doesn’t want to be friendly, and she’s not cruel, so she’s just – this. A little bit of a brat, but she’s not harming anyone.” Unlike Peeves. He’s mostly harmless, but some of his pranks make Draco nervous. He’s pretty much always one wrong move away from someone getting seriously injured, while the worst that would happen with Myrtle is someone slipping and falling. He supposes they could drown that way if they were especially unlucky, but Draco doesn’t think Myrtle would actually let that happen.
“Oh,” he shifts his weight from one foot to the other. Is this how Ron feels whenever he offers to buy him something? “Are you sure? I don’t mind paying.”
Leaving the others here, unconscious in the middle of the lake seems … wrong. Besides, everyone keeps telling him that people die during this tournament. What if the merpeople’s song was literal, and they really will keep whoever isn’t rescued?
“I’d love to,” he sighs, then holds out his hand. “Yes, girl?”
He looks over at Harry, who has a familiar confused look on his face, which means as usual his soulmate knows nothing.
,” he says, and he gets it, finally.
Snape rolls his eyes, clearly able to tell that Harry doesn’t know what he’s talking about. “When Fleur Delacour killed Barty Crouch Jr., how did she do it?”
Well, that doesn’t make any sense. If only he could hear a little better, get a little closer, maybe he could figure this out.
and working together to win. But he just loves flying too, and when it comes to that – gliding is just better.
Harry and Pansy honestly don’t care, and it would just prefer not to have to write five feet on it either way.
“Could have fooled me,” George answers. “Can we go now? How did you even get up here?”
“No,” Clarence says mournfully, “It’s too late. I like zir too much.” He collapses dramatically on his side, conveniently falling so his head is resting against Quinn’s thigh. “You come off all charming and quiet, with your pretty eyes and deep love of making things explode, and then you pull this out of your back pocket, but at this point I’m already too invested to run away screaming.”
“Now,” he says firmly, and he hears a faint splash as Dumbledore plunges his hand into the basin.
each other, of course, but they’re not really friends either. Hermione doesn’t do furious jealousy, Harry doesn’t think. Or maybe she does and Harry’s just not great at recognizing it, which is depressingly possible.
Neville snorts as he sips at his glass, walking away from them. Dean and Seamus are long gone, already in search of more alcohol. Harry looks for the girls, and finds them clustered around a group of Beauxbatons boys.
Shit.
Seamus vaults himself out of bed to snatch the paper out of Harry’s hands. “
Winky pushes two letters into his hands. “Master Draco is having very important information for you. Also he requests that you be asking Miss Abigail what is going on with Nagini.”
He hops back in his carriage, and by the time he makes it to the manor gates Payne is circling overhead and his mother is levitating another body onto a neatly ordered stack of about a dozen more. They have to be under petrificus totalus to be that stiff, unless they’re old and his mother felt the need to use rigor mortis for a terrifying art project.
“But I,” she pauses, bites her lip and turns around, looking down at her papers and circles and equations that mean nothing to Harry. She turns and kicks the nearest desk, the clatter of it falling to the ground enough to get everyone’s attention. Except Draco’s, who is still bent over his parchment and writing out numbers like his life depends on it. “I just – I don’t understand this! Why am I being so stupid!”
“You’re a Gryffindor! You tried to stop us in first year even though you didn’t want to, and you faced your boggart and defeated it last year, and you asked Ginny to the ball, which is the bravest thing I’ve seen anyone do, she’s so scary–”
Sirius’s house.
It makes him impossible to ignore or deny. Harry easily rattles off defensive spells and keeps his eyes on all of them while he walks through the room. His nerves and discomfort don’t stand a chance against the sheer wealth of his experience, and Draco can’t show it, of course, but he’s proud of his soulmate.
“I study sometimes,” he protests, which Draco ignores. It’s true, but only in the sense that Ron studies sometimes. In other words, the several times a week they get together to do explicitly that and pretty much no other time. “I really was serious about the date. Tonight? No dead bodies this time, I promise.”
There’s a pit of dread in the bottom of his stomach, and he just
Sharon doesn’t have the same hesitation. “Or everyone who’s entered this cave before us and failed is in that water.”
“Eun-hae!” Cedric yelps, his voice going up several octaves in mortification.
Molly is busy kissing all her kids all over their faces, and she does the same when she gets to Harry. “You really are too skinny, dear,” she says, “You let me know if you want me to send you anything over the summer, okay? Anything at all.”
There’s a beat of exasperated silence which he’s unfortunately very familiar with. “Oh, Harry,” Ginny sighs. He can feel Draco doing a poor job of suppressing his laughter from where his back is pressed up against his chest. “Of course they know each other. They’re married.”
Harry digs his chin into the middle of Ron’s back just to make him squirm. He really isn’t short, he’s taller than a lot of the boys in their year, it’s just that Ron is so absurdly tall that Harry always feels short next to him. “Maybe that should be a last resort and not our first option?”
“I don’t think that’s exactly what I said,” he says dryly, putting down his quill to give Draco his full attention.
“Clever,” Ron says approvingly, climbing onto the bright red Firebird. Harry grabs the Cleansweep. He doesn’t need speed, just accuracy. “Distract, attack, and try not to let anyone get kissed. Once the aurors get here, fall back.”
Sirius laughs, ruffling Harry’s hair. “Sure. Remus hates it, he doesn’t even like getting on it as a passenger.”
Ron screams. It’s fantastic.
There really isn’t. “You sure? You must be tired too. What you did didn’t look easy.” He could have helped, if he knew anything about healing, if he’d known the spells Draco had used. He’s a necromancer and manipulating dead flesh is something he’s good at. But Damsa had been right. The more necromantic magic he learns, the more his own magic is changed because of it, the more it changes all that it interacts with. Which isn’t normally a problem, but normally he’s not performing magic on dead things that he has to worry about tainting or changing in some way. His magic reaches out and reacts, it always has. Catalina and Sharon’s magic had done the same, although Nanaia’s and Slughorn’s hadn’t, and he wonders if it’s just something he’ll learn to control in time.
"You gave me a bit of a fright there, at first. If I hadn't understood what was happening and known what to do, I'd have probably panicked and called Mungos." He explained. I suddenly couldn't feel more grateful that Draco somehow mysteriously saw me on the floor and known, then helped me afterwards even as I was obviously still out of it after fainting. I leaned into him slightly, ignoring the ever-lingering question of how, making a small noise of annoyance because I was so tired, and I'd have been damned if I didn't have Draco here right now.
"And if it's any concern," Harry suddenly said, "I won't love him more than he loves you. Or- rather, he won't love me more than he loves you."
After that, I felt Draco stop hugging me so he could grab my wrists and hold them against his chest, pressing them down.
I settled in my spot, remembering what has unfolded in these last two days.
"No. I came to check up on you." I said that as if it were obvious. "Talk to me. I'm here to listen to your point of view." I said.
really laugh like that?"
I sat down at the desk with a huff, resting my elbow on it and putting my hand to my forehead, feeling my tiredness catching up to me. I felt dazed and fuzzy, as though I'd had too much foul tasting alcohol. My ears were ringing slightly from the events of the last two hours. Slowly, I opened the cream colored folder in front of me. My eyes were promptly met with several sheets of parchment, and a photo attached to the first one. I scowled at it, as though the photo could see me, and moved it out of the way, not wanting to look at the bitch that started this whole problem.
"H-hi. Happy Christmas-" I immediately moved out of the way of the front door, gesturing them indoors. "P-please, come in."
Thank you to everyone who has read, commented, bookmarked, recommended, and given Kudos to this book. Your support means loads, and encourages me to continue writing. I’m glad to have been able to entertain you all with my ideas for this fanfiction, and I hope you continue to enjoy this story with the release of its continuation, title: Returned.
"Hey, it's okay, Draco it's okay, just take deep breaths with me, alright?"
"Muggle studies would be a waste of time for me, so I'm taking divination and Arithmancy." He took in a deep breath, before letting it drag out. "I almost woke up too late. Can you imagine how I would've gotten to Hogwarts without the train? My mum would've probably had a fit." He chuckled.
The words on the board had gotten smaller and smaller as I tried to fit them in. I ran out of space to keep writing, so I added three dots at the end to indicate I wasn't done, before handing the board to Scorpius. He took it and read silently, before looking up at me with the most serious face I'd ever seen on him, and handed me back the board. I began erasing with my sleeve.
"Says who?"
"Anyway, are any of you trying for Quidditch as well?"
"So he's my cousin... once removed." I paused as if to make sure I'd done that correctly. And I wondered why my family hated my cousin to such an extent that she and her husband were cast away by us, how I never got to know Nymphadora and how she died before I could realize everything my family had done wrong to her.
About thirty minutes after dinner, I noticed a whooping and cheering coming from a group of people sat at the couch, curious, I looked over to see what was going on, and saw Scorpius, doing those same awkward dance moves from earlier, while holding each of Maria's hands while she did the opposite moves as him, though much more fluidly, and less exaggerated. They were moving like a conveyor belt, when Scorpius stepped forward with his left foot, Maria would step backwards with her right foot, before they returned to the middle, and then did the opposite with their other feet. Scorpius would then step backwards with his right, while Maria stepped forward with her left.
"Eat. Yes just eat, because you all decided sitting for breakfast is more important than going to find Harry. And Weaslette has the audacity to give me a death stare. What the bloody hell did I do to her? She should be apologizing if anything." I swung the back door open.
"I won't tell her. You go and figure out your feelings okay?"
And he did exactly that with another word, leaving me with Scorpius. He looked from where Harry once stood, to me, then back down to his food. I did the same, trying to pass the time, trying not to say or do anything that might upset him. Push a spare bit of meat around, eat a potato, or a string bean, ignore the cat's meows from the other room. Soon enough I remembered something, and deemed it too important to keep myself silent.
"Are they still cheesy if they're true?" I questioned with a smile.
Soon after, we erupted into a loud fit of laughter. It feels good to not be angry. We looked at each other for a moment, before continuing our walk. I couldn't wipe the smile off my face for some reason.
"Calm down, Golden Boy. You're one of two." He replied.
. I thought, thanking God she had slept in today of all days.
"Yeah. I think I'm going to return to the bedroom. Thank you for the food." I said, getting up and leaving the kitchen.
"Hufflepuff."
me back to his office." I replied, feeling my chest weigh me down in guilt. My bitter expression was replaced by a frown, and I glanced up at Draco, before looking back down at my knees. "Sorry... I-" I sighed. "I-I just don't feel right having to trust strangers with this stuff. I know you mean well, and no matter how many ways you word it to take the blame off of me, I know that I'm scaring you, and I know my stubbornness is just making you feel more in the dark, I-I know." I blinked a few times, sucking in a breath.
I jumped slightly at the sound of the door opening gently.
Let me know what y'all think, and drop thoughts on what this chapter may lead to for Scorpius, and, as always...
"We should check Hogsmeade." I suggested. Right now, the three of us were outside our home, discussing where to begin looking for Harry.
"I wish we were making Wolfsbane," she whispered, clearly loud enough so I could hear, while looking over the contents of the page.
"Scorpius, my love, my world, my everything, I will play
"It's just notes," she explained calmly. "For me to remember-"
"No but, for real? He was a huge piece of shit. That
"I'm Draco Malfoy. Scorpius's father." I said, also shaking his hand.
When I entered I took a deep breath, staring at the floor as though
"You know we didn't
"Anything else, Hermione? Ron? Harry?"
Though the walk was relatively short, some odd looks I would get made the walk feel much longer.
I spent the rest of the day deep under the covers in bed, and Draco stayed with me most of the time, just letting me lean into his chest and rest on top of him as he passed his hand up and down my shoulder in a comforting manner. I think I let myself fall asleep once or twice, maybe thrice, and I think Draco did too.
His breathing was ragged, and he kept shutting his eyes with every new bit of pain that would shoot through him. I didn't stop the cooling charms, paying extra mind to the section that was the source of the pain, where that giant scar was.
The unnatural stretch and pull of apparition found me, Draco, and Scorpius in the drawing room of Grimmauld Place. Scorpius, as though following a sort of instruction he'd been given, made a beeline for the upstairs and his room without a word or a glance to anybody. The hand's grip around my wrist immediately softened and with it came a harsh pang to my chest.
"It hurts so much... it hurts. I need it all to stop." He said in a broken voice as he continued to let himself cry. His body shaking every time.
I leaned in, engaging us into a slow kiss. His lips against mine were sparks of electricity- tickles that flushed my very being.
"Okay, but you have to deal with it soon. Tomorrow?"
It didn't take long at all for me to observe how his eyes were moving around under his lids, how he was making all sorts of micro-expressions, furrowing his brows, and creasing his forehead; he was having a conversation with himself in his mind.
"The day before my birthday." I mumbled, processing the information.
Hermione's face was scrunched up. The sound had hurt her ears as well.
"Mhm... sure. Well, I want to open that bottle. Not to help you, oh heavens no. Just because I want to." I dropped my expression, giving him my best
Let me know what you all think of this chapter, for real! Especially this chapter. And as always...
"I never killed anyone!" shouted Draco, quite defensively. "How dare you accuse me of such a thing?! I could neve-"
"I don't feel good." He whimpered. A closer look at him allowed me to notice he looked rather pale, well, more pale than usual, and a bit green. His hair was a mess, and a quick touch to the forehead told me he had a fever.
"Teddy gets sad when he talks about you being sad. And that makes me sad because my friend is sad. Be happy and do happy things to make you more happy. That way Teddy can be more happy. Figure out how to make yourself happy before Teddy gets too sad."
"Scorpius?" replied the curly haired girl, before promptly getting placed under a running stream of water from overhead. I reached over and took Draco's hand. The ride jerked us around, and I closed my eyes, bracing for a splash that never came. Rose gasped, pointing up, and we all braced for the nearing waterfall to surely drench us all.
"Then don't. You only need to respond to her." He said, letting my owl out to fly around outside.
"My nephew said there's six movies. This is the newest one that I've seen. But I don't watch them, my nephew does. He calls them the Harry Potter movies." I looked at Harry, who almost seemed like he wasn't even with us anymore, the uneasiness in my stomach only grew.
"Yes, I am. But I can stomach Flitwick's tiny foot up my arse if it means I don't have to play that horrible song."
"Things are fine, really. Things are... good! Good, uhm, things are good." He let out an unconvincing smile.
I closed my eyes, standing before them defeated.
More hot tears pooled and fell, wetting my pant knees, wetting my arms, dirtying my glasses. The light feeling in my head got worse, and I wondered if I might faint in here.
Scorpius leaned into me as we sat looking at the credits and paying no attention to them. My mind drifted to what Harry had voiced earlier, and I felt a glum feeling come over me.
"Please. It will help me know how to help you." He said. He then stopped our hug, making deliberate space between us. I felt a rush of
I turned at the sound of Teddy storming down the stairs and Harry following quietly behind. I realized that Teddy's hair had changed to a bright blond. The other day though it was brown... that means he has the metamorphagus ability...like Nymphadora did.
"Hi Luna." Harry let go of my hand to give her a hug. Neville stood up behind her.
I dropped my head back down slowly, remembering what had happened when I tried to ask last time. Well, it wasn't really asking, but either way...
"Oh I'm sure but still you shoul-"
"And you're in charge, you need to lead me in the dance-"
Draco did indeed beat me. Twice. I won the third time though. The whole affair was really just fun. It was laughter and happiness and friendly competition and I wondered how I could go from isolated, being monitored and worrying that anything I say or do would spell my demise and make me go insane, to at home with my family, people I care about.
It was well past the middle of the night and Harry and I had just been laying in each other's arms unmoving, silent. It was as if we were trying to comfort each other to sleep while knowing ourselves that we wouldn't succumb to it's peaceful darkness. But still, neither of us spoke, because what if the other was finally sleeping?
"I can have both you and Draco take the exam to discover your main love language, but we can wait for him to come back before we do that. If I were to guess, Harry, based on your past traumas and repeated occurrences throughout your childhood and adolescence, and on behaviors I've seen you display here in the office with me, I would say your main love language is physical touch."
"Stop that. You're going to make it worse."
"I-I'm alright. Hey. Would you like to go and eat breakfast with Teddy and Scorpius and D-Malfoy?"
"Oh." I mumbled. "Well, yeah. Ron is one of the Weasleys... his whole family, him and his six siblings and-" I paused, sadly remembering when it used to be seven. "And his parents too. They're like my family..."
—Harry POV—
Enjoy!
—Draco POV—
"Scor, something has happened. You're going to be staying with some friends of ours with Rose." I watched as Scorpius's innocent face looked up at Draco, looking into his dads eyes. Draco just stared with an urgency that burned. Hesitating for a second, he slowly got up, holding Draco's hand.
I put my hands to my head and hit it against the wall behind me, instantly regretting it.
"Off to bed now, it's still the middle of the night. We've stayed up long enough." I told him.
"Feel where you are for me." I felt the ghost of my right hand go from my chest- heaving and weighing me down- to the pathway leading to the front door.
"That tells me that the bumbling idiots at the ministry will never wipe off that stain of impurity that plagues them. That plagues
"And you're sure that you don't know who it was? Just that it was a woman? What women frequented the Manor?" Hermione pressed for just about the millionth time.
"You know, Harry, people really love and care about you..." I started, reaching out to lift his head so we could look at each other. "Teddy, Ron, Hermione," I swallowed thickly. "All of the Weasley's, really. Me, Scorpius even... we'd be crushed if you weren't here anymore."
"Well, I mean, you trust them?"
—Ron POV—
"Looks like your squid is getting the water it needed," he chuckled, holding out a hand. I took it, feeling as both of our hands, now wet with rain, clasped together, and he hauled me up.
"Harry. Ron, Rose and I better get going." Said G-Hermione. She got up "Ron. Please go get Rose. And ask Ginny for some floo powder, please."
Silence engulfed the room for several minutes, and all I could think to do was stare down at my own tea which remained half drank and now sat cold. It was then that I realized something was missing from this whole encounter.
"What if I can't help him?"
"What are your favorite things to do in the Wizarding World?" she asked.
"Yeah. Y-yes. I'm okay. I just kind of, I-" he was thinking of a way to say it, I knew because his face was scrunched in concentration as he looked into his own mind for the right words. "You're intimidating, sometimes... I-I don't know..." he said, that last part rather quickly.
"I can't believe it. You can't use your own car!" I said, laughing at my discovery. "The Draco Malfoy cannot properly use his own car." I teased.
"How have you been?" He asked, I shrugged.
"I am not
"It's alright." I said, pausing. Scorpius and I have never really had a meaningful conversation before. And I don't quite know how to handle this. He slowly emerged from his spot.
"Thanks." I said with an exhale. "Ron and Hermione are coming over by the way," I swallowed, taking another breath, feeling my vision sway uncomfortably as my stomach clenched in pain again. "Apparently Hermione has something important to... say." I made the executive decision at that moment to stop speaking, focusing chiefly on the nausea that was apparently not in the mood to make itself a false alarm as I felt my stomach acids uncomfortably gurgle and my mouth salivate too much. Enough to tell me I wasn't going to get past this without eventually emptying my stomach of the nonexistent food it harbored.
"It's alright. Though, the stuff you say... it's-"
I told myself.
"Oh, Scorpius! Hey there!"
"So I'm never going to see you again?" asked Teddy. His hair was streak white, and we were hugging. The three of us spoke about my competence as a guardian... which started a few minor arguments. But it was decided that Teddy should stay with Andromeda from now on.
"What can you expect, though?" began Wendy. "The Rowles were death eaters. I'm surprised that most of them aren't in Azkaban.
Scanning the area, I noticed a group of women sitting in a circle of plastic chairs, talking about something, while one of them was tending to her crying infant, removing the child from the stroller and shaking a bottle to feed it.
I stared at her, truly at a loss for words.
Harry and I were sitting back upstairs in my room.
!" And, in an instant, the stains were gone. I looked at Harry one more time after going out of my room. I thought of him as a stranger before, but now... he doesn't feel so strange. Well, he is strange, but not as much as he used to be. He was waiting for me to go out. "Let's go get some water."
I found my feet landing firmly in front of Kingsley's office. My gut curled and I swallowed stiffly.
"Good morning. How are you?" He asked sleepily. My mind was ready to answer honestly: That I feel a bit lost, and I think I'm disconnecting from reality. But instead of answering, my mouth decided not to move. The only indication that he had of me listening, was that exhaled more loudly than usual, drawling it out as if that was my answer- that the words just hadn't gotten to be pronounced. I closed my eyes, mentally leaning into Draco's touch. Physically though, I didn't move.
"It's just a lot. It's overwhelming," I began softly. "A-and, these books and what Hermione said about Voldemort-
"I'm sorry, Padfoot. I... Please forgive me. I didn't mean to, please-"
Scorpius' words made my shoulders tense involuntarily. His question made a centipede scurry up my spine and my ears perked up as though somebody had hit a metal sheet with a hammer right behind my ears.
"You hit your head pretty hard back there, mate, do you need us to get you something?" Ron.
"You can't really be scared that they're going to do something to you." He said dramatically, rolling his eyes. The corner of my lips quirked up at his expressiveness. I don't really see it around anyone else- he gets too shy around them.
"Ah, Teddy, it happens," said Bonnie, waving Teddy off, and then turning to me. "Hello, Scorpius! Are you excited for this year?" she asked eagerly.
"Potter! Open the door please, Potter!"
I walked into the room careful not to make noise. I kneeled by his bed and saw how peacefully he was sleeping.
"I remember this spot..." Harry walked forward, towards the outer rim of the clearing. "It's as quiet as it was last time."
"Get that out of my face, will you?" I muttered, taking the phone and holding it further away so I could properly see.
"Not even a 'good morning', honestly. What am I going to do with him?" He puts down the letter and frustratedly pinches his brows together. Luca snorts, which makes me snort, and we quickly try to hide it by putting our hands to our mouths. Wendy frowns at us, clears his throat, and continues talking.
"Ah, well... Practice makes perfect, I guess," she said, laughing. I gave a light chuckle, bringing my hand behind my head.
Hi Scorpius!" He said, I saw streaks of his hair involuntarily turn from sandy blond, to turquoise. And while I was glad it meant he was happy, It worried me slightly. As long as he isn't changing anything too dramatically, hopefully, Maria won't notice.
"At her grand mum's," answered Ron. "You'll see her tonight, though," he said with a smile. Draco sat next to Scorpius, and I sat next to him, with Ron on my other side, and Hermione at the head of the table. Dudley sat across from me, and Millicent across from Draco.
"Oh. Well okay... do you mind if I have one?"
I let the silence surround us briefly before concocting an answer.
"Talk to me. What do you feel?"
"Harry, open the door please, they keys are in my back pocket."
"Hello everyone. This is my son Scorpius." I looked towards him as he shyly clung to my hand and waved at everyone.
"I'm going to get him-"
He sniffled, and it was only then I realized we were both crying. Then, with a cracked voice, he spoke again. "When you've already lost so many people, losing another simply because they faded away, it makes you feel like it was your fault that they faded...
I swallowed. Harry turned our position into a hug, burying his face in my shoulder, and allowed himself to continue swaying to the beat of the music. I followed him wordlessly, allowing myself to close my eyes and lean into it.
"It's okay... I'm here. Don't worry. We'll get through this with time."
"Harry, I haven't said anything... Please, your shaking is getting worse... Just follow my voice, breathe, slowly." I began to murmur, recognizing the signs of panic in him. He began to move towards the floor, curling himself into a ball, I eased him back up, into a hug. "Shh, relax...listen to my voice... don't worry about anything else." I whispered into his ear. "There's nothing to worry about. Just focus on this, focus on me. Feel the floor beneath your feet, the fabric of your shirt." He twitched, breathing heavily. I began to pass my hand through his hair. "Don't worry. We'll figure it all out with time, we can't ask ourselves everything at once, we don't want to get overwhelmed."
"You have no say in this particular matter." Draco shot back. I sunk into my chair, feeling a blush crawl up my cheeks in realizing this is probably going to be
"In the bedroom upstairs." With a glance towards me from Draco, I promptly ran up the stairs, rounding the corner into her and Ron's room, where, placed right by the door, was a navy bag with small illustrations of birds on it. I swiftly picked it up, before meeting Draco, Hermione, Scorpius, and Rose outside.
"You won't be alone," I reasoned, soothing him as best I could, hugging him and letting him hug me. "You have Teddy, and Rose. Those are your friends. And you'll have all of those Weasley kids you met a few Christmases ago... that's a lot of Weasleys. You absolutely will not be alone."
"Hey, what's wrong? Aren't you excited to go to school and learn more about magic?"
Before I had a chance to react, the hat yelled "Slytherin!" as more than one set of cheers were heard from the Slytherin table. But I couldn't help but notice the stares that were being sent my way. Keeping the hat's words in memory, I hastily went to sit down, shrinking into myself as much as I could.
I took in a chaste breath-
"A Wizarding magazine." Answered Millicent.
We stopped what we were doing to see Teddy, Scorpius,
Draco added with "Hermione is absolutely correct, Scorpius."
"For Merlin's sake Potter... Have you at least stayed up to date with taking them?"
"Draco you don't understand. I need to help her-"
"Needy." But he continued to card his hands through my hair anyway, allowing the soothing sensation to swallow me whole. I closed my eyes contentedly, cuddling further into him.
"Sounds terrifying. People dying? Murder? You'll never catch me competing in something like that," I chuckled.
I opened the door, wand in  hand, ready to assess what had made him call out for me with utter distress laced through his voice. With a flick of my wand, I lit the room, eyes landing on Scorpius, his eyes were watered- face screwed in hurt- and he was looking up at me with a painful sort of lost and confused expression, and was sat up in his bed with the covers removed. I noticed a stain on his pants and on his bed. He had gone in the sheets again.
But Draco was faster, the drawer opened and he took me by the arms firmly, turning me around, his hold becoming gentle as he began to inspect me.
"Getting the mark was horrifying. I remember asking Mother over and over again if it would hurt. 'Quick and painless' she'd say, every time.
"Draco, breathe, listen to yourself!" He stopped, breathing quick and shallow. His gaze was cast downward and his eyes looked lost.
"How come you're so good at this?" He wondered, setting his chin on my shoulder.
"I... I'll get it." He said. This was a horrible moment to be grateful for having worn a red shirt, because I have a feeling I'd already have a small stain or two.
"It's okay." He said, still focused on his toys.
"No, Harry! You don't! And you shouldn't! What happened was not your doing, and you cannot blame yourself for the outcome!"
I resided in the spot next to Harry, wrapping my arms around him from behind and bringing him closer to me. I felt his arm twitch, and I decided to break the silence between us.
"It's beef Wellington- I didn't serve you much because I know it can look overwhelming, but there's always more in the kitchen. There's also some roasted potato wedges and some asparagus." He said it like it wasn't something that took tremendous amounts of time and effort- carelessly, as if this wasn't what we were having for our first date in two years, something that he went through the trouble of making the Muggle way- which is surely difficult- because it would hold more meaning that way.
"Are you alright Teddy?" After a bit of us staring at each other, I stood up to leave. He doesn't get it.
"... Why are you telling me this anyway?"
"You!" She said, pointing an accusing finger at Draco, and letting go of my arm.
"Uh... what's-"
"Harry, you're sure?" I didn't know what to think. I felt my heart skip a beat waiting for his response. My throat was closing in anxiety.
I struggled for air, short of breath, mindlessly yet harshly gripping my now crossed arms.
"Try for some sleep tonight, yeah?"
"Page 10 is enough to get you intrigued. Are you enjoying it so far?" He continued, a smirk on his face.
"I think... he's just trying to test his abilities... trying to see what he can and can't do alone. He still needs you, there's no doubt. But he is a growing young boy... I think, you're just... in shock. I mean, who wouldn't be? Just a few short years ago you were feeding him and changing his nappy... now he does those things on his own. It's just... life. Maybe, try not getting into a quarrel with him the next time he tries to do something on his own?"
He slowly nodded.
"They're going to hate me... I won't even know how to talk to them, I don't want to be alone, dada... I want to be with you, I want-" his breath hitched, and he took it as his own cue to stay silent.
"Oh Goodness no. It's almost dinner for me. Time zones..." she replied.
it wouldn't become a habit.
Okay, first things first.
I can hear him, and I can feel his caresses and his kisses and his hugging and his breath against me ear as he holds me close and whispers into it.
Harry and I both looked up and out the window at Scorpius' comment, and I saw small flecks of white powder falling from the sky, onto the not-yet snow covered ground. I put my book down, getting up from the table where I had a cup of tea beside me.
"I need you to communicate with me, please. Tell me: what's the matter?" He removed his chin from my hand, turning away again, and this time, did remove himself from my hold, almost shyly, as if he were ashamed of his actions, of himself. He looked at me, then back to the floor, and I stood seemingly patient, hiding my apprehensiveness and my desire to see what was going on inside his head. Hesitantly, he raised his hand to touch his forehead- his scar. I gave him a quizzical look.
"You told me... You told me I could make something amazing. That I'd be great at school. Is- Is this why?"
I pulled out my wand letting out a small chuckle as I recalled how dramatic my son is being. I used to be the same.
I think that's the only time we spoke after the fight that day. The next day though, we'd made up. It was stupid, really.
"Harry..." I shut my eyes tight, going towards the voice and hugging what felt like Draco, it was only then I realized I was hyperventilating.
"Mate, you just don't get it, do you," he shook his head. "She's been moping around since that happened. She threw herself full force into her work, and she has something to tell you too... she was just scared to send you an Owl because she's guilty, mate.
"Which session was I ever absent for?" He asked with a smile and a slight laugh. I returned it.
"No. The Order of the Phoenix is still a secret society, Harry," Hermione answered, allowing me to avoid stating the rest of the question.
"You were just standing there!" He replied, still laughing.
"Mr. Frazier is being paid as if it were a day of instruction."
We all went home as the sun set, and Scorpius practically collapsed on the sofa bed with Teddy, exhausted. Hermione said that she had written the essay, and was ready for it to be sent off to the Ministry. We told her about the Dragon challenge, as well as the many butterbeers, and the group of teenagers we ran upon.
"Please, let's go inside. It's freezing tonight. Come on, it's okay. Everything is alright. Follow my breathing..." I recognized the pleading yet calm voice, but everything was too hazy for me to understand. I know those hands. I've felt them before. But my mind was still reeling, and suddenly, the cold air that was making my core shiver was exactly what made me realize that I'm not trapped in the hot, stuffy cupboard.
"It's just a nickname," Draco chuckled nervously, smiling at the teens. The ride dipped, though nobody was wet by it.
"He left to find Harry on his own?" She asked to no one in particular, I saw Ginny go upstairs, and then, Neville spoke again.
I could tell he heard me, and he responded so slightly that if I hadn't been paying all the attention in the world, I would have missed it.
"Harry." He turned his head to look at me, things were silent and tense. He didn't dare move. I made my way to him in two large steps and encased him in a tight hug, burying my face into his shoulder. He returned it gratefully. I began breathing again, something I hadn't realized I stopped doing.
I stood up, guiding him to do so with me. The pillow lay forgotten on the floor as we got close. I cupped his face with my hands, wiping his eyes with my thumbs. Green met grey, and my heart broke at the conflict I saw in him. I leaned in, giving him a slow, tender, loving kiss. Then, I looked at him again, before bringing him into a hug. He hugged me as well, letting out a broken sob. I found myself rubbing circles on his back, closing my eyes tight, pressing him into me.
with everything. I couldn't stand it anymore. It seems that sometimes if you need something to get done, you just have to get it done yourself.
"We were hugging." I stated, a shade of pink coming across my cheeks. Draco and I are never really intimate in front of Scorpius. I don't think he really has any idea I'm with his dad.
His voice was but a whisper, as though he were scared. He sounded scared, the way his lips barely moved and his arm kept twitching and he kept trying to look at it and trying to lock into my gaze at the same time.
"Granger, can I get to the basement without having to see her face." He said with a sneer.
"Luca, come on, let's get ready for dinner." Luca startled me from behind, taking me from Aminata and guiding me out of the classroom. It was only now, while looking around, that I'd realized the majority of students had already left, including Professor Belmonte. On our way to the restroom, we were walking the halls alone.
"Harry, is this for me?"
"Why did you think I'd..." he asked, unable to finish his question. I understood what he meant though.
...So he's not going with me. My mind wandered to the question that Gabriel had asked me a month ago.
Scorpius turned to me, and I gave a gentle nod.  "I'm eleven. I turned eleven last January. Draco and Harry got Rose, Teddy, and even Luca to show up. Rose is my friend, and Teddy is like my cousin. Luca is Teddy's best friend." Mother nodded thoughtfully, sipping her tea.
When I finished Tending to his wounds I spoke again: "Teddy is down stairs."
"You're pushing it away. You can't do that. It's dangerous."
I sighed. "They had a small disagreement. They will talk and everything will be just fine before you can say pumpkin pasties... why don't the two of you go on and play together in Teddy's room?"
"Thanks." I saw the ghost of a smile trying to form on his face, and I gave him a genuine one, before patting him on the shoulder.
"Yeah, like the fact that he assumes the books are one-hundred percent fact, and can't keep his head out of his arse long enough to realize I'm uncomfortable." The couch dipped as Draco took a seat next to me.
"What?"
we were happy with each other... even when I was a complete arse to her efforts towards my health. I regret that. I still love her. You know? And I wish her the best. I just...it's not the same
"Nothing, Scorpius, not now. Go to your room." He said sternly. I walked upstairs and he followed, keeping my thoughts to myself until we could speak. Scorpius went to his own room, and Draco and I went to ours. I opened my mouth to speak and he held his hand up, taking his wand out, and casting a silencing charm. I then heard the rapid pitter-patter of Scorpius' footsteps, and I could only imagine him clutching his ears and going away to get rid of the ringing.
"That's too high."
"Harry, give me your arm."
"It changed me..." he added shortly. "Are you going to eat with us? Or..."
"It's neat," he replied.
Things were silent for a long while, and we just stayed in that position on the floor while he calmed down slowly. I was thinking about what he'd said, and his comments were what determined me to write my own letter to Hermione, explaining today's events, and asking her if she knows anything. Every once in a while, Harry would twitch, and try to press himself further into me, muttering words I wish I heard properly. I would just keep him in my arms, letting him take the time he needed, occasionally passing my hand through his hair, silently saying simple, calming words. Eventually, I heard a sniffle come from him.
"Of course," He answered, rolling his eyes playfully. "Actually, I was considering eating with the Ravenclaws."
"Well now you're making me sound like I believe it, sweetheart," she replied, looking sweetly at Dudley before turning to Draco once again, sharply. "Though, I wouldn't put it past
"I don't think it would hurt," Ron began, giving me a shrug. I turned over to Harry, who seemed indifferent.
"Oh, that Muggle sport. Well, I have some time to kill before quidditch," she started before Wendy cut her off.
Harry was sitting to my left, and Scorpius to my right. Around us were at least 12 other people, sitting at several long tables, that we placed next to one another. Maria was sat in front of me. Everyone was talking and seemed in their own conversation, a small hint of nostalgia hit as I was reminded of a more neat, smaller, homemade version of the great hall. I turned to Scorpius.
"So, how was your third day?"
I opened my eyes, my chest feeling heavy at the memory. The words kept circling through my mind. Selfish, freakish, foolish, horrible, dangerous. It angered me. It angered me because I know those words all carry even some truth to them. I sat up, I could feel each beat my heart made. It was uncomfortable and made me want to rip my skin off.
Bonnie waved from her position in the air, and Wendy did the same a few moments later. Before I knew it, Bonnie was hovering right in front of us.
"During the summer of 6th and 7th year, and also after... everything, I came here a lot to clear my head. Usually it was at night though."
"It was nothing." I stepped closer to him and made him look into my eyes.
Ron cut off my rant.
"Yeah, Hermione. Yes. Okay- yes. You too. Bye Hermione." Harry hung up the phone, passing a hand up his hair.
"Can I go play with Teddy?"
This is why I start most nights with Harry, and end most nights with Scorpius. This is also why I've been spending every spare minute lately to brew, bottle, and store dreamless sleep potions and calming draughts. They work for Scorpius, but I don't want him to become dependent on them, which is why he doesn't take it every night. He also doesn't truly need it every night, just the nights when I'm not with him- the nights when I can just tell, with one look at Harry, that he needs me, even if he won't utter a single word about it.
"Eh, well, if you say so..." He gave a nervous chuckle, then sighed and looked away.
His wife's words kept bouncing about my head.
So now Harry is in therapy again! I wonder why... But! Things are going to go a bit different, and absolutely not to Harry's liking.
"I-I'm fine. I just... I don't think this will turn out well, and Teddy has already bared witness to enough arguments. I-" I cleared my throat which seemed to be getting more and more dry.
I only shook my head, suppressing a giggle.
At one point, Draco asked if I was okay with him leaving me at the entrance to a shop. I immediately realized he'd probably wanted to get me something, I tried to tell him no.
I turned around, so I could hug him. But my heart nearly pounded out of my chest in the realization that I was alone. I looked around, suddenly panicked.
Ron lowers the pillow.
He shrugs. “Either it will die, or it won’t. Not our problem. Grab the diary, and let’s get out of here before it decides to wake up and eat us out of spite.”
Sirius isn’t grinning anymore.
Harry struggles for a moment, debating whether he should get into this or just thank Quinn for zir time and leave, but he gives in and says, “I don’t want to like him.”
, not on the train. They aren’t supposed to be here.
i hope you liked it!
Okay, well, that’s fair, if a little concerning. But he supposes it’s a little unfair to expect creatures to prioritize human lives above, or even equal, to their own. “
Draco had heard about the bike, but this is his first time seeing it. It’s
Draco can’t see Umbridge being on good enough terms with any foreign nation to borrow one of their Parselmouths.
“Oh,” he says and takes another sip. He also doesn’t have to worry much about hangovers. Not just because he rarely drinks enough for it to be an issue, but also because his soulmate is a pretty good healer, so if he ever was hungover he would just go to Draco and ask him to fix it.
Everyone around them has gone quiet, not so subtly waiting for his answer. “Yeah, sure,” he sighs. “Right now? Is Viktor coming here?”
“You really are a disaster,” she says, sighing, “I’m shocked you ever manage to keep any secrets at all.”
“Well, it’s my house,” he snarks. “I’ll go where I please. What are
Winky whirls on her heels and glares at him while she gestures at Draco, but Harry only shrugs back. She throws her hands up before disappearing with another crack. “Draco, maybe this isn’t a good idea.”
Harry’s gone cold. “Are – is – did I
She blinks. “What?”
“Correct,” Perenelle nods at the tables. “Four to a game. Follow the instructions on the board. We’ll be keeping an eye on you. Don’t play a game with the same people twice in a row.” She does a quick count of everyone. “We’ll be joining you so we have the correct number of players, but don’t think that means that we’re not paying attention.”
“If you could refrain from speaking to my client in that tone, I so would appreciate it,” Zaira says, with enough steel that Fudge shrinks back from her. She casts a long glance at the bald man that Harry blushes just to witness. “Auror Shackbolt, what an unexpected pleasure."
“Does anyone know what’s going on with Hagrid?” Lavender asks. She’s addressing the whole table, but is looking at Harry. He knows that Hagrid’s on a mission for the Order, but not where he is or what he’s doing or when he’s supposed to be back. But he can’t tell them that, obviously.
“Huh,” Harry says. One of Draco’s knights brandishes a sword at him. “There are probably some things I should tell you.”
He returns Dumbledore’s smile for one bright moment before grabbing Draco’s hand and dragging him from Dumbledore’s office. They’ve barely stepped out of the stairwell when Draco yanks him down the hallway and presses him against cold stone of the wall, hands fisted in the front of Harry’s shirt.
All in all, it’s a really good night.
Neville shakes his head. “That’s only if the minister is killed. The Wizengamot will appoint an interim minister, probably their oldest member, and then we’ll hold a special election. I’m putting my money on either Kingsley or Bones.”
“DRACO!” Harry shouts, and he sounds upset. He doesn’t like it when Harry’s upset.
He doesn’t have much time to second guess himself before Sirius has him in a crushing grip, one hand across his back and the other cradling the back of his head. It’s weird, he’s been hugged before, by his friends and even some adults, but when Sirius hugs him it feels – parental, almost, although he really wouldn’t know from personal experience. But he thinks he’s right.
Reanimating several thousand animal skeletons is not small magic. Any type of necromancy isn’t small magic. It takes a tidal wave of green, smoky magic to fill the skeletons and push them forward, to send them scurrying after Umbridge and whoever’s with her.
Draco shows up to Filius’s office to grade the latest batch of essays, confident that he’ll be able to avoid harassment now that he’s submitted his paper for his review.
Nicolas leans back in his chair and winks at him, “Anything for you, Albus, you know that.” Perenelle rolls her eyes.
“I don’t think I like them getting along,” Ron says slowly, stooping to throw an arm around Draco’s shoulders.
Cassius startles, then scowls at him. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Must you flirt with my mother every time?” Blaise asks, put upon.
“I’m going to get changed now!” he announces loudly, and doesn’t miss the way they both bite back a grin.
He shrugs. “Usually wizards are asking them to make things just to stroke their own ego. You’re trying to make something to help. It’s worth a shot.” He flushes, but gives a grudging nod. It’s not like it’ll hurt to ask. Or it might, but just his pride when they laugh in his face. “About the spell building.”
It’s not that. He wishes it was that, because the truth is more embarrassing, but he’s not going to let them feel bad just because he’s embarrassed. “I forgot it was my birthday.”
!” which is grammatically completely wrong, but at least gets his point across.
Thousands of animal skeletons with glowing green eyes rush down the hall, so many of them on top of and around each other that it’s just a river of bones barreling down the main hallway. Umbridge, a couple ministry officials, and several seventh years that Draco has never particularly liked are caught in the mass of bones, being carried along by all of them and unable to force themselves free. The river of animated skeletons blasts by them, including the screaming and crying people caught in their grasp, but it’s not until their shrieks are faint echoes that Draco feels safe leaning out into the main hallway. Cedric fists his hand in the back of his robe but doesn’t pull him back.
They should probably get this meeting back on track, but everyone seems too amused to protest the detour into the Weasley’s family drama.
“That’s a generous description,” he says. Harry mostly just tells him he’s hot and gropes his ass. Which Draco’s not complaining about, obviously, but he’d hardly call it flirting. “You’re missing the point. You’re not a chess game and your friendship isn’t wizard chess pieces that can pull itself together again after he’s made the wrong play. He’s not going to play unless he’s sure he can win so you can’t just base his supposed disinterest on him not making a move. Not everyone can be Viktor Krum.”
He extends his arms, shifting his hands enough so they’re laying flat, and she sways away from him but still doesn’t move to attack. “Mother, may I?”
He pauses, opening his mouth for a moment before closing it, “Oh, well, that’s true. Are we going to kill her? If we’re not going to kill her, we might as well heal her.”
“No,” he says. Clearly his fear of Hermione doesn’t outweigh his love of drama. Well, there’s a reason Slytherin isn’t known for being the smart house.
There’s a moment where no one says anything, then Narcissa takes out her wand. “So, do I just cast the spell then? Nothing fancy?”
“Winky,” he says, and his house elf appears in front of him in a crack. “Get all the blood replenishing potion you can, from my stores and the family one, and Snape’s if you can get into it.”
,” he hisses.
“Isn’t something big happening every year?” he asks tiredly. “No, I don’t know. There
“Flora,” Draco groans, flat on his back and with the sun in his eyes. Everything hurts so much that he doesn’t even want to go to the effort of lifting his arm enough to cover his face. “I’m begging you to be nicer to me.”
“Who’s Payne?” Filius asks.
“Have you faced Voldemort?” he asks.
Harry freezes.
“Me,” Quinn says, “They’ve been together for as long as I’ve been paying attention to them, so at least since last year.”
There’s shouting and a curse comes hurtling straight at her. At first Harry thinks she ducks out the way, but that’s not right, she’s not bent in any way. She’s just shorter, suddenly, so it goes sailing over her head. She turns, regaining her height in the same breath as she reaches for a dagger and her arm bulges with muscles she didn’t have a moment ago, giving her the strength to send the dagger sailing across the room and into another Death Eater’s chest.
i hoped you liked it!
“Yes, Master Draco,” she says, before disappearing.
“Shit, hold on,” he says, lunging for his bed and grabbing the book, because he remembers the incantation but not the wand movements. He flips through the pages but they’re all blank.
Probably. He turns his head enough to kiss the side of Harry’s hand. “Not what I meant, love.”
“I can’t exactly fit everyone on my motorbike, Umbridge is watching all the floo networks, and brooms won’t get us there quickly enough,” he ticks off. “We could summon Payne, and maybe another wyvern?”
For a split second, Dumbledore almost looks irritated, before he’s back to looking like nothing more than vaguely pleasant. The reminder that his headmaster is human makes Harry crack a grin, even given the circumstances.
“Me too,” he admits. “But you understand, don’t you? You won’t tell?”
Harry doesn’t even realize Lavender is speaking to them until she leans across the table to hold out a vial of red smoky liquid to Ron. The angle she’s leaning gives him a perfect view down her shirt and he guiltily jerks his eyes up to her face.
“I’d love to. Who?” she demands. “I’m the best seamstress at this school, everyone else just uses magic for it, which means they’re not nearly skilled enough to work on something as important and tricky as a wedding dress.”
There’s tension in them still, from the too stiff line of her mouth to the unnatural stillness of his father. They’re not alone, he can’t throw himself into their arms like Ginny did with her parents, but he wants to. More than that, he wants them to stop being worried about him, but he can’t think of how to reassure them while they’re standing in a room with Dumbledore and the Weasleys.
Draco frowns and his shoulders slump, but he doesn’t argue. “Okay. Winky, let me know if you need anything. Bye Theophania! No eating the house elves!”
Catalina and Sharon row the boat across the pond while Harry levitates everyone else above them. They occasionally hit something with a dull thump that makes Harry wince, but Sharon and Catalina just gently maneuver around it. He’s not particularly squeamish about dead bodies, and he’s not sure if that’s an effect of being necromancer, or if most necromancers just don’t get very far if they’re worried about corpses, but something about that dull thump is just disquieting.
Harry loves Hogwarts, of course, and loves talking to all his friends who he doesn’t see nearly every day, and all of that, but what he sees at the Gryffindor table makes him want to turn right back around. They’ve just walked in, surely no on will notice if they just leave right away.
“It’s magic,” he says. Percy coughs, and if Harry’s not mistaken, it’s to hide a laugh. He didn’t know Percy could laugh. Tonks is clearly good for him.
He certainly has them, though. Maybe she just wants them to break into a mausoleum and have him awaken some long dead scholar she has questions for.
Now all three of them are staring at him. “What are you talking about?” Catalina asks finally.
knew that until Sirius told him, but complete strangers know.
“I could ask Susan,” Draco suggests, and Harry raises both his eyebrows. Is he talking about the red headed girl in Hufflepuff?
“Same,” Harry and Ron say together, and the four of them grin at each other and begin the game, with the delightful noise of Draco and Hermione arguing about colors in the background.
“We need to see this map!” Fudge demands.
The sun has just started to set by the time they settle their bill – by which he means, Draco settles their bill by paying three times the cost and Ron glares in a way that Harry knows means Draco will be getting an earful for it later. Based on several parties’ worth of experience drinking with Lavender and how articulate she’d been when dissecting Snape’s potential motives with Draco, Harry’s pretty sure she’s exaggerating her level of drunkenness so she has an excuse to stumble and cling to Ron’s arm as they make their way back to Hogwarts. Harry can’t even make fun of them because Draco’s arm is around his shoulders and both of them aren’t pretending to be anything but sober.
“I have,” Dumbledore answers.
Draco’s actually broken the skin on his lip when he turns and says, “Do you think the heir of Slytherin is in Gryffindor?”
“Pansy was the one who thought to do solve the equation backwards,” Hermione adds proudly.
Draco clears his throat, “It’ll be a lot easier to clear your name if we give the aurors Pettigrew. Certainly a lot easier than if we give them his corpse.”
“No,” Hermione says quietly.
“And how often are you with Filius?” she asks.
She bites her lip, then reaches into her bag and pulls out a roll of parchment. It takes him all of two seconds to recognize it as the charms essay on the effect states of matter had on banishment that Flitwick had assigned all the third years. “
Getting down is going to suck.
“Do we need to find another meeting place for the RA?” Cedric asks. “Since Umbridge suspects we’re using the chamber.”
.” He’s picking up on this whole grammar thing a lot quicker than Harry is, but Harry can still understand him.
Draco was a little busy this summer, but there’s no way he wouldn’t have heard about one of the Warringtons having some sort of public breakdown. Right? His mother would have heard, at the very least.
He barely remembers to cast disillusionment and notice-me-not charms just before the carriage leaves the alleyway. That would have been really awkward to try and explain to the muggles.
Harry pauses in looking over the remains and rubs a hand over his face. “Oh, fuck.”
. The most harrowing experience Cho has dealt with is playing as a seeker on the Ravenclaw quidditch team.
“Sure,” she says warily. She shoots Draco a glance, but he only shrugs. He has no idea what this is about.
Harry looks over to Draco, who smiles at him, and he can’t imagine giving him up for anything or anyone, even if their marks disappeared tomorrow it wouldn’t matter to Harry. Draco is Draco, and that doesn’t have anything to do with the marks on their hips. “Yeah.”
He rolls his eyes, and his arms are unfairly distracting in that tank top. “It’s mostly a goblin art nowadays, I only know about it at all because we employ some in Japan and Korea.” His eyes get pinched at the corners. “Really, I should go ask Luna. Her mother was an alchemist. But also whenever we talk about Pandora, there are tears, and we don’t have time for that right now.”
I closed my already covered eyes, feeling my body seemingly shift and turn through a vast emptiness, everything was warped, and suddenly whatever noise Draco's dressing made, was too loud to be considered comfortable. I flinched when my stomach made a low, beastly growl, sending another sharp ache to shoot across my mid-section.
"But if it's going to make things bad for you, I'll raise hell."
I walked away- upstairs, into the guest room- closing the door behind me. I shut my eyes tight, taking in a deep breath. The exhale, however, came out as a soundless sob. I shook.
—Hermione POV—
"Grimmauld Place is hidden," I replied simply.
"That sounds interesting," I replied sarcastically.
"And how did he start it, Draco? We are favored over others in this world and you know it." He voice was low and piercing, she was warning me.
"Go talk to him! Coño! [God Damn it] Stop being stubborn!" I sighed in frustration.
"It would be better for him, if you told him before he could find out some other way."
AAAA I can't believe this book is actually over!!!
"Dada I'm done in the shower!" Scorpius came bounding down the stairs, and Draco immediately let go of me, putting on a mask of composure. I wanted to tell him so badly to send Scorpius to play in his own room for a while. Draco needs a break.
"Oh, goodness no!" I interjected. "He's not... no- he's not sick or dying or anything." A silence fell over us again, and now with the topic of Draco, I couldn't help but ask a specific question:
I felt him unclasp my hands, I kept them up, and he hugged me tightly so I wouldn't move. I began rubbing harshly up against his shirt.
"That's it, just deep, slow breaths. It's all going to be okay." I forced myself to follow Draco's patterns of breathing, in, and out.
"Stop!
"Drop it." I stated firmly. As soon as he let the knife go, I removed my grip from his wrists. "Go wash your hands in the bathroom." I directed, pointing a finger towards the stairs. A long, tired sigh escaped me as he scurried up. "Don't touch the rail with your strawberry hands."
To the other side of us, there were two men standing by a box releasing flavorful aromas, who were arguing, quite loudly. And one with a large, black haired goatee was waving a pair of kitchen tongs around in a threatening manner, as he yelled at the other man who had one of those brown paper sticks hanging out of his bottom lip.
"It's nothing." He interrupted, I looked at him with a face that said 'seriously?'.
"Thank you." I got up and left. I figured Harry had gone home, but when I apparated I to our living room, Teddy's tutor asked about Harry.
A not so shocking discovery: the state of Florida is hot. It's boiling. I'd say that nobody in their right minds would spend the whole day walking around outside, under the sun, in this
"Are you absolutely sure?"
He didn't let go of me, and well, I wasn't complaining, but I was also slightly worried."Talk to me, Harry."
"Please, I left the Auror offices years ago."
He was scared.
"Malfoy you are really getting on my last nerve." he said through gritted teeth.
"Okay, you win, Ted." We both laughed, and I couldn't help but feel triumphant. "Alright, so... Step out over here a bit so you don't hit Wendy."
"It's because of your brain medicine isn't it? I heard you guys talking. It's because your medicine doesn't work." He said, voice quivering. I sighed.
"It's at least five hundred times more difficult to explain that I was helping the wrong people," he finished. An invisible weight settled itself on my chest.
"Like a baby, especially after last night," I said with a smirk. "Best Christmas Eve ever," I added, giving a sly chuckle, which Draco reciprocated.
"What they think doesn't matter. Between you and me, they're all just a bunch of scared idiots."
After a second, I rushed outside after him, grabbing my wand from the coffee table and my coat from the coat rack.
"Why don't you do that, and take a breather while you're at it. I'll fix the tea. He said. I offered what I hoped was a grateful smile, as I made my way upstairs to Rose's bedroom, my mind racing.
The fatigue weighed heavy on us. Expressionless, eyes droopy, breaths small; a black tar was growing in my mind, relentlessly pulling me into unconsciousness.
"You can't do that to him!" I explained, feeling exasperated.
I didn't eat it all, but I definitely ate more than I would've a few months ago, and that was more than enough for Draco to notice, and smile about it, which made me smile in turn, releasing a helpless sort of shrug.
I felt him pat me on the back. "We'll make him a bed, and I'll give you a dreamless sleep potion like I have been. Okay? And if anything, you know where I am. Okay?" He pulled me away and looked at me. I nodded, wiping my nose with my arm. I felt his hand go up to wipe my tears.
"If we only focus on the bad things..." he continued, his voice growing darker, and quieter, "we lose our ability to see the good. We become numb, we become but a single particle of dust floating through life, with no hope, no laughter... we fade away. I know that from experience...
"...Gryffindor team. Pssh." Luca said, facing in the direction opposite to mine, presumably hiding a sly smile. I widened my eyes, glancing over at Victorie, who was staring straight at Luca.
I held my arms, trying to resist the oncoming urge to soothe the feeling of tiny invisible ants biting me.
"You do understand why I can't leave you alone right?" He nodded. Silence filled the air.
"Rose why don't you go play with them?"
"He has averse side affects to them." I can't breathe, I'm drowning, needles pricking at my skin- Fuck,
Stepping through the fireplace left me feeling odd. My mother had already walked a few steps in, and I guided Scorpius in before me, dusting him off. Mother turned around. Her expression had changed, from professional and perfect, to just... normal. She held her arms out, a smile reaching her eyes.
"I don't know if you're there, but..." I swallowed, taking in a breath. "Please be there..." The words burst out of my mouth, despite any and all protests, because really; how could I be so selfish?
"Follow my breaths, Harry. We breathe together, Harry. Feel my heartbeat. Follow me." I put all of my effort into paying full attention to Draco, his soft voice, his deep, slow breaths, his calm and consistent heartbeat. My head hurt, and a single look at Draco as he put all of his energy into helping me, made me crumble.
"Not if it wasn't under your control."
"There's a bed, and a bathroom down there. You don't have to walk through the main house at all if you really don't want to." She said.
"We're going to make sure it's amazing." Draco moved to bring me into a hug. I put my mug down beside me, wrapping my arms around his waist. He did the same, bringing me into a kiss that I gladly accepted, before pulling away, to speak to him.
"You will tell me. No matter what." I said, determined to get more than a simple 'okay'. My head hurt from squeezing my eyes shut for so long.
"He has, white blond hair, just like his dad. He is seven years old, and he is the strongest little boy I've ever met." I placed him down on the kitchen counter, looking at him. "I know it's a difficult puzzle, but you're smart. Who do you think it is?"
"Hey! Cut it out. But any house will do, as long as I don't get Slytherin."
"Because." I bit. It was then that I realized I was beginning to shake. I clenched my hand into a fist to calm down, I noticed Harry move slightly. I glared up at him.
It seems like Gabriel was about to go on a tangent.
"Hey, Ted. I'm good! Molly seems to have got herself into a compartment with Lucy, Dominique, Fred, and some friend of hers, so do you mind if I sit with you guys?" She peered around the small space, smiling and waving shyly to my friends. Gabriel was looking at her with wide eyes, awestruck.
"So then
"Oh come off it, I'm more than capable of watching over him."
Just then I saw his posture falter, hand moving towards the same area. He quickly regained himself, the fleeting display of pain barely visible to someone who wasn't paying full attention. Overwhelming concern went over me.
"Hermione, it's best we all have our wands on us, really." Ron reasoned.
I glanced at him again, noting that his gaze had once again resided to his lap as he played with his nail, biting it, inspecting it, then biting it again, seemingly no longer for maintenance, but out of a sort of nervousness or anxiety.
"Good," Luca replied to my surprise, "lots of playing, and sputtering saliva, and squeaking, and trumpets being too loud, and..."
Scorpius didn't say anything. I continued. "I tried to get a teacher fired, even though he seemed kind and hadn't done anything wrong. I even tried to stop people, including Harry, from doing the right thing." I stared at Scorpius, looking for an answer. I had to look away when meeting his eyes.
"Harry? Scorpius?" I almost dropped the cups.
not understand?!" I shot back.
I thought to myself, shaking my head slightly.
"No, Ted, I know you're mad, but it's not worth it, okay?" He's right. I breathed deeply for a second and-
"He eats every day- varying amounts, but I make sure he eats a bit of at least one meal every day... no panic attacks or self harm that I know of, though it is difficult to tell... He's good at avoiding people when he chooses..." I explained, becoming worried.
—Draco POV—
I brought my hand to my head in a sort of attempt to soothe my aching as I tried to remember how I ended up here. Draco's thumb moved back and forth soothingly across my other hand.
"Are you going to die like Aunt Ginny and Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron were saying?"
I didn't respond, and he didn't try to continue speaking after that.
"Where's George?" I asked, suddenly realizing I didn't see him in the giant bundle of red-headed family members.
"It's stupid," I countered. "Just brush it up a little bit and he'll be fine."
"There. What month and day is it?"
"See? That's better now, isn't it." I cooed, fixing his night-time jumper and trousers. I picked him up gently, cradling him again.
All at once, I thought about what might happen if I spoke up. Far too many times was I given the opportunity to speak up, for me to have only stood in silent resignation. I studied Harry silently, observing just how tired and worn down he was. How he only sat there, fiddling with a loose string on his now fraying sleeve. The image of him crying as he bled on Sirius' bed, too distraught to speak, I knew what I needed to do.
you get those thoughts." My voice broke at the end of the sentence, and I gripped his hand like my life depended on it. I grew increasingly frustrated at his lack of an answer, but showed so much emotion that the frustration drowned away.
Scorpius said nothing. I whipped my head towards him, wishing that he would say something... anything.
I reached into the cabinet for a mug, while waiting for my tea to brew. I had woken up from another dream, and decided I would have myself something to drink so I could relax.
Ron's looked better, that's for sure, but he's also looked worse, namely while we were on the run, in 7th year.
"Good. Well, see you at Herbology after lunch." He told me as we approached the entryway. I waved goodbye as we went out separate ways. He plopped down at the Slytherin table, beginning to serve himself the usual small amounts of food he eats. I sat in my usual seat alone, and I was preparing to have a lunch like any other, until Professor McGonagall- she told us to just call her Professor- stood at the podium at the front of the hall, silencing us to make an announcement.
"Mate, I'm so sorry... how long ago?"
AWWW We got some family bonding  (and some embarrassing moments too). We also got some gay moments!
"Well, a cat sounds fun! It's soft and it'll protect me," he reasoned. Wrong.
"Yeah, I'm just really tired. Couldn't sleep last night."
"I've just had a really complicated day. Things happened that I never thought would actually happen."
I sat at a table next to Teddy and Rose. McGonagall, the headmistress, looked as strong as people say her to be. I'd heard conversations on the train about her.
"He's going to hate me," he breathed.
"It's okay if you want me to wait a while longer before picking up Scorpius." I nodded numbly, unable to stop the tears that I'd been holding back. Still holding my wrist, I leaned into him as he gave me a hug, feeling the all too familiar rush of warmth that always accompanied my crying. I did so silently, but they were violent enough to make my body convulse against him.
—Draco POV—
He went under the alias of Nicholas Evans.
"Hey, don't worry. I get it."
"H-help! Someone?" I pushed at the walls surrounding me, gasping like a fish out of water. My abdomen was beginning to hurt and I felt light headed. "Please!" I hit the nearest surface. Nothing happened.
I heard Scorpius and Teddy's footsteps as they stormed down the basement stairs, and immediately composed myself, sitting up straight, passing my fingers through my hair, and wiping my eyes.
"Uhm, last month, I..." I looked at Draco, who slid his hand over to mine, silent reassurance. "I told Draco that I was," I swallowed, the hairs in the back of my neck rising in alarm.
"Um, yeah! Sorry. Yes. I would, in fact, like to go with you to the Yule Ball, Vic," I said, rubbing the spot on which I hit myself, looking onto the floor.
He turned into a corner, and I followed suit. However, he was gone. I stopped abruptly. Anger, worry, and guilt bursting inside of me.
Everything had left me in a single breath, leaving me panting and staring at Hermione, and now Ron, who must've walked in and sat down next to her while I was explaining everything.
—Harry POV—
"What about Voldemort?" I asked. Several of them looked at me, slightly surprised.
The feeling I had whenever I thought about her is still there, and still gnaws at my mind when I see her, but it doesn't bother me as much as it did. But it still frustrates me to think of Luca.
Taking larger strides than ever before, I found my way to the nearest boys room. Entering, rustling and shuffling could be heard, along with a whisper of a jumbled string of 'shit... shit, shit, shit, shit.'
After all, to me, it is so,
"Did you like my applesauce?" Scorpius asked him. Harry looked at him with a grateful smile.
Suddenly I understood why Draco always mentioned Scorpius 'growing up too fast'.
"So was it because... you thought the Professor too high-and-mighty to attend to you, or believe you? Because involving your friends would be too much trouble?"
"Malfoy..." Said Weaslette softly from the door. I turned to her in acknowledgement before telling the boys I was going to go 'play with the adults now'. I got up and fixed myself before allowing her to lead me downstairs. Harry wasn't there...Potter.
"Harry, Harry!" I screamed, yelled even. I heard a fumble, and a thunk from upstairs, causing my to spiral into my own panicked frenzy as I no longer let my attempts at freedom be known as weak. One of the Aurors gave a nod to another, who had managed to take my wand without me knowing, and started upstairs. I lurched towards him painfully as the Auror holding me down struggled to reach his wand while keeping me in his grip.
"I missed you... why didn't you come with us? Everyone was crying." He wailed. I noticed his hair turn black. My heart dropped.
"Hey," I interjected, loud enough so the remaining students could hear and go away, "let's get out of here, yeah? I'm looking forward to watching Wendy attempt to eat grass."
Ron nodded happily, not missing Ginny's enthusiasm, and she turned to Hermione:
I put the last piece of the puzzle left. The different pieces came together into a painting of green, blue and yellow, and I backed away from the table and reclined into my chair. This place is nearby, according to Dada's books. It's called Scotland.
"Hey, Dad, before you go to bed..." I started, placing my hands behind my back, slightly swaying side to side.
"Really? Are you a constellation?" Scorpius asked, looking at me.
"It was Umbridge. See? Not important." I said, a small wave of frustration coming and going.
Hermione said that's only the tip of the iceberg, and that the books are alarmingly much more detailed.
"I-It's all very one-sided, though. They talk about Draco no further than how he-"
"I'm sorry." I whispered. He only pressed tighter. I heard a sigh come from him.
"Harry, listen to me, you're being irrational. Let's just focus on relaxing. It's okay, everything is okay..."
"Hey." I commented, hiding my surprise. "Thank you for making the bed." I finished, setting the plate down. "I made breakfast, it's not much, just so you don't go without anything." He didn't react to my words, focused solely on the neatness of the corners of the comforter.
"Open your eyes for me, Draco. Let's work on calming down together."
"I need you to go. I need to do something-"
Eventually morning came. I saw the sun rise over the horizon, and even though the day was just beginning, I felt my eyelids become heavier and heavier. From my sprawled position on the bed, I felt myself sinking more and more into it.
"Bloody brilliant! And Teddy's class is among my favorites. He and his friends are a real treat; especially this one girl with curly hair- she loves herbology."
I sighed. It's good to hear him say it, though. It's nice to know that, even when Dada is with Harry, he still loves me. Dada let go of Harry's hand and held both of mine in his.
I kicked a column in frustration as Harry walked out the door.
"I don't know, but it's ridiculous. It's
"Okay, okay... I guess I, wasn't thinking." I said, taking a breath and bringing my hand to pinch the bridge of my nose. "You can't entirely blame him, I mean, he's already, what, ten?"
"I've been busy," he replied shortly.
I shook my head. He wouldn't have been that cruel even back then. Right? I ignored my thoughts and decided to open the bottle I'd randomly stolen, and took a swig of it.
The room went tense and silent again. With only the occasional sound of forks on plates and cups on tables.
"You're mad if you think it's a good idea to go."
"Don't... Just let me in. You're building all of these walls and I'll be damned if it doesn't remind me of what you were like in sixth year."
—Draco POV—
Soon, I was confronted with a bedroom significantly messier than when I ever found it: empty drawers out of their places, upside down across the floor and bed. Clothes, folded and unfolded, papers, and shoes were scattered about, I was standing in a defaced memory of Sirius' youth. My shaking fist closed tighter around the photo containing me, my father, and a break where my mother should have been. My knees wobbled, and I collapsed, sucking in a painful breath, and shutting my eyes tight, trying unsuccessfully to keep away the onslaught of tears penetrating my eyes. My body convulsed, and I slumped into the side of his musty bed.
I thought I'd be the first one to go, but one went before me. A tingle in my chest had settled in suddenly. Then a pounding. I don't know what I would expect-who would cheer for me?
much. You don't know how much. And I'm there for you- for everything." He wiped my eyes. "Don't ever forget that."
"I love you too, Scor. I'm so sorry for everything you had to see today," Draco stopped their hug, kneeling down to Scorpius' height and looking up at him. "You shouldn't have had to sit through all that you did."
"Are you really there?"
"Malfoy?" Said Ron in disbelief. I nodded and took a sip of water. He and Hermione now sat across from me in our dining room. After I'd sent the owl they insisted on coming to visit. They apparated here this morning.
"How do you expect me to sit at a table and make myself believe that I deserve to give myself sustenance, when I can't even hold up my end of the bargain in life?!
"Is Harry okay? Are you okay, dad?"
Draco began to tremble, and soon enough, my shoulder was dampened by tears.
wish she was Hufflepuff," Bonnie yelled.
"Yes we're more or less the same age aren't we."
"Harry-"
—Draco POV—
My heart rate quickened again, pulsing through my body, pounding relentlessly at my skull. I trembled.
"Well, aren't you two more talkative than usual? Usually you and Luca are huddled together and talking with your mouths full," scoffed Wendy with a smirk. "You're talking
The next morning, I woke to Draco shaking me.
The door creaks when opening, which I hadn't found too irritating until now. Closing the door gently, I moved over to Harry.
"When we discovered what Mister Malfoy did to Maria-"
"Enough! Stop fucking fighting! Harry is missing. He is what we have to deal with right now. You all are either going to help me find him, or I'm going alone." He said, grabbing his coat and shoving past the two girls, going outside. The door slammed.
"O-Oh, okay!"
I was brought out of my concentrated daze by the soft feeling of Harry wrapping his arms around my waist and resting his chin on my left shoulder.
"Does it have to do with that letter you received today in the muggle mail? What was it about?"
." I said, smiling at the concept of us, pretending my words made any sense. "But, I don't think I ever... I mean... I've only ever thought of boys this way maybe... one other time in my life." I finished, my brain scrambling. I've never had such a hard time speaking before, even in the scariest moments of my life. Now though, I don't even know
"Evening, Harry. And the others?"
"Mum, you're taking Harry all to yourself! Let the poor bloke through!" exclaimed Ron, accompanied by Hermione and Rose.
"Oh as if power never helped anyone. Please, Draco; you're nauseating me." Her tone was that of someone who was bored beyond belief as she fixed her second cup of tea.
—Harry POV—
"Draco, it's the middle of the night. He could be anywhere. Let's stop. We'll keep looking for him tomorrow." Pleaded Hermione.
"And how... how did she know... almost everything? ...Do you know how much it sucks that my best friends learned of my abuse through quote-on-quote 'fantasy children's books' and- How did the happenings within that house even reach the light of day? How did that blasted, supposed Muggle, know about, well everything? Even- She even knew about my... visions, my nightmares, about Sirius, about the tournament. It's like she was there the whole time hiding-"
I didn't want to stop because my mind was running wild trying to understand everything. But as he hugged me tight, I realized he's correct. So I cuddled into him, my mind buzzing and teeming with thoughts. And eventually, we fell asleep.
I never felt any bad feelings for Harry. But the only time we really talked, or really, when he talked to me, he was talking about stuff I knew nothing about, and he was talking pretty fast. That was the closest I've ever been to him. He feels even more distant when we're eating, and he doesn't even eat a lot, even when we cook Maria's food.
I had decided to bring us from the uncomfortable floor to the bed right next to us, and I could feel Harry leaning into me heavily. When we were finally lying comfortably, I couldn't help but give him a slow, meaningful kiss- one that made me tingle inside. One led to another of the same manner. Harry was reacting slowly, and I let us take our time. It was after the third kiss, when I noticed he stopped kissing back, and I pulled away only to realize he'd fallen asleep. I took his glasses off of him and put them on my nightstand. Then, turning to face Harry again, I ran my hand through his hair, hugging him gently. He needs the rest. I stayed with him for a while, just thinking over everything. Really,
"I'm feeling like you're lying to avoid talking about it." I told him, looking into his eyes. He sat down as well.
"Aren't we observant." I chided bitterly, stepping through the fireplace and finding my way to the nearest couch, hugging my knees to my chest, resting my head to the side.
"Oh. So you were napping? I woke you up?" He gave me a curious face.
"Alright, Scor; calm down," I replied with a smile. He backed off, plopping down in front of me with his legs crossed. "It sounds brilliant."
"I do hate to interrupt your inner monologue, Harry, but Ginny and I best be going now." Luna smiled at us, and I scratched the back of my neck, glancing away.
"We can't, but we can say hi to mum." I told him, wondering if this was the right approach, even if it's too late to retract my words.
"I'm sorry! I thought you meant
(See the end of the chapter for
What if his mindless pointing around caused an explosion instead of a sandbox-"
"Of course. Did you eat and everything?" He said while standing to go towards me.
"It was me." I interrupted. He sighed deeply.
"Because nobody tells me anything!" he shouted. "Aunt Ginny dragged me all the way to Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron's house crying about you and nobody is telling me anything! Why have you never talked to us?! Why is everyone talking about you dying?!" He said, tears streaming. I saw Andromeda standing in the corner, watching us expressionless.
"I'll just stay by you, if you don't mind. I don't want-" At her side, her hands balled into fists, before she suddenly grabbed mine, pulling them close to her chest. "I don't want to be a bother."
I wiped my mouth and swallowed. "It's okay, you don't have to-"
"Really? Where?" Scorpius said. His face showed obvious tiredness, but his voice signaled for curiosity.
"If I may, doctor," both of us turned to Draco, who had taken the liberty to speak, and I felt a flare of anger rise and fall within me, because I just
"You guys go ahead, I'm gonna wait for Teddy to finish." I heard Luca tell... someone. I really couldn't care less who he was talking to. I was too focused on making sure my face didn't fall into my eggs.
"Maybe he just... didn't want to bother you about the applause-"
"Alright. I'll be ready when you do."
then I moved onto my upper body. My torso, my neck, and my back.
"Sorry, I shouldn't have-"
I wanted to say, but I instead sat down, grabbing Draco's hand under the table and squeezing tightly, willing myself to not dissociate now of all times. Draco eyed me suspiciously, looking a bit puzzled.
"Does it have anything to do with why you won't let go of the cloak?" Draco asked. Luca's expression faltered briefly.
found an old, dusty Gobstones set.
I want everything to stop. I don't want to feel anymore.
My heart was pounding slowly. The parchment was wet with tears but they weren't my own. I was shaking and struggling to find my balance.
"-Looks an awful lot like Malfoy"
"Ah, yes. Harry Potter. I did read about that in the paper a few years ago." Her gaze settled on me, and I found myself feeling tense and uncomfortable, under a sort of invisible pressure.
Fun fact, this chapter takes place on July 29, 2011, which is 3 days before the Dueling Dragons, AKA Dragon challenge, shut down due to an accident on the ride resulting in somebody's eye needing to be removed (July 31, 2011). Only a few short months later, in October of the same year, the ride disabled their dueling feature, and 2017, the ride was shut down, to be replaced with Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure.
"You mean U.P.S? The postal company? No, that's not what I was talking about."
"I'm a metamorphagus, like Teddy." He responded, eating another chicken tender. I raised my eyebrows at his response, but didn't push it any further. Other than that slightly awkward moment, lunch had been a warm and joyous occasion, filled with laughter and stories about the two lad's mischief at Hogwarts so far, as well as how they met. eventually, Luca asked if he could be directed to the restroom. Teddy did that for him gladly, and with company out of the room, I noticed Harry's plate, half-eaten. I looked up at him, not needing words. He shrugged with a smile.
Let me know what you all think of the chapter, and most importantly...
"I won't." I heard her say. After one last look into my eyes, I went downstairs, and left with Draco and Scorpius.
The nightmares were bad, but not particularly bad enough to make me shoot out of bed in panic. Every time I woke, the feeling of warmth, safety, and comfort lulled me back into a peaceful sleep.
I stood there appalled and unable to come up with a retaliation. Malfoy appeared with Teddy and Scorpius.
"Happy Birthday Scorpius! Ay, you've gotten so big! I can't believe it!" Exclaimed Maria as she walked through the door. I gave her a great big hug, and she gave me a kiss on the cheek, which I rubbed off, looking at her wide eyed and smiling.
"Hey," said a low voice behind me, causing me to inch my shoulders a bit higher, "I'd heard Hagrid had a girlfriend that was as tall as him... Hard to believe, but I guess anything's possible in the wizarding world."
"Aurors Berrycloth, Weasley, and Williamson have full permission by the Ministry of Magic, and the Magical Congress of the United States, on behalf of Minister Kingsley Shaklebolt, and President Samuel Quahog, to place Mister Draco Lucius Malfoy under arrest- for endangerment of the Statue of Secrecy, and suspicion of irresponsible use of the Obliviate charm on a Muggle."
"Why do I hurt myself and make myself remember all of the bad things?" He said, sniffling at the end. I wasn't sure how to answer.
"You couldn't open the bag, could you?" I accused, my smile going from fond to mischievous. Draco gave a look of deep offense.
"Shh, I know. It's okay." Within the next few seconds I found that I could hear my breathing again. A silent, cool pulse worked through my skin, into my veins, and up my arm. Slowly, I was able to feel something other than the burning pain, something much more calm, like a breath of fresh air. I opened my eyes, looking down. Harry was caressing my arm, the powder blue light of a cooling charm coming from his fingertips, sinking into my dull scars.
"Were you..." He wiped his reddened nose. His brows were furrowed and his eyes red and barely open. "Did you hurt Mum too?"
"Oh, come on. I smile."
We opened presents by 9:00 in the morning because Scorpius simply couldn't wait any longer knowing there were at least 10 presents with his name on them.
"Oh nothing." I decided to keep the fact that his face undoubtedly reminded me of an 11 year old Draco Malfoy to myself.
Everyone's heads turned to the front of the hall as McGonagall shushed the crowd.
"Argh- Luca! What the bloody hell has gotten into you?!" I turned around and spat. My cheeks quickly heated up upon realizing I had several dozen voice cracks in that one sentence.
"My father had never done wrong by me until he made me get the mark."
"You like billywigs? Their flittering is annoying, how come you like them?"
"What do you mean? you've been asking me that
"I'm not wrong," he countered. I let out a small laugh.
I made myself comfortable on my side, so I could continue laying down as we spoke. He mirrored me, and we stayed silent for a few seconds, before he shifted, placing a hand on my cheek and giving me a quick kiss. We pulled apart far too soon, so I held his hand in its place and brought us into another one- slower, deeper, more about making the moment last.
The silence was thick as we stared at each other. I was calculating whether I was meant to say something before him, and I could see that behind his tired, sunken appearance, he was trying to find words to say.
"Oh like you hadn't left him when you were supposed to step in as a father!" I froze, looking at him intensely. He stared back. Neither of us dared speak. At least, not at first. I went past him, being sure to harshly shove his shoulder on the way out of the room.
In one fell swoop, I collapsed into a hug with her, holding her tightly. I was overwhelmed with emotions. My mother, who I haven't seen in... years... and here she is, hugging me and telling me how much she missed me.
"W-well, Ron and Hermione can-"
"Yeah I guess it is obvious... can you point me to your restroom?"
"I like your shoes," commented Scorpius.
"No, Scor." I knelt down and gave him a kiss on the forehead, noting how I had to slightly crane my head upward to do so. "I need to make breakfast, maybe Harry can play with you again after we're done." I got up with a grunt, pat Scorpius on the back, and walked to the kitchen.
I got back into the car with multiple new light bulbs. I wasn't about to go to the hardware store every time I needed a new one. I noticed my phone began ringing. It was Potter's wife.
Teddy finally gets to see Harry, and is realizing the home drama he's recently missed out on.
"Ok Scorpius, so you have to a domino that matches with the number nine or the number two." I told my son while bouncing him up and down on my lap. I then leaned close to his ear and whispered while pointing at a specific domino we had. "You should use the one that has a nine on one side and a zero on the other side, that way Harry has to put a zero or a two."
"Yeah. I think I'm going to try that the next time I feel out of control." I said. My smile grew, as did his.
"But I always do that. Why can't I do that?" He said, pointing at the knife and tomato in my hands.
"What? What is it?" She asked earnestly, placing a hand on my forearm.
I rolled my eyes in response. "You still get to hug me, but now I also get to look at you." My hand came up softly to his cheek, and he tilted his head to give it a kiss before cuddling into me again.
After a moment's silence, he shook his head, sniffling in. I took a second, before speaking again. "Don't worry. I'll be here when you do. There's no rush. Everything is perfectly fine. I'm not leaving." I reassured.
"Joanne Rowling can't be a Muggle if she knows about him- there's no way- she must be a Witch- someone who knows divination." He told me.
"It's okay, Draco. We'll keep him safe. They can't make you serve if they do come back. I won't let them make you, Draco. I'll keep you safe, I'll keep Scorpius safe."
Nobody mentions how easy it is to sneak around Hogwarts at night. It's just one of those things you figure out for yourself. Another thing nobody mentions is how cold it can get at night. At the moment, all I could think was that I really just needed a spot to warm up in.
"Why haven't you been talking to me about your thoughts?" He asked.
"They're sure to print an article about this." I told him, sitting down, feeling frustrated.
"Can we ride Spider-Man again later?" His words were jumbled and he was, well, giddy from all of the sugar.
—Harry POV—
"They said they had some business to take care of. They'll probably be coming in the middle of the task, so they won't get to see everything." He cleared his throat and looked at Victorie, then looked back at me with pursed lips.
He stayed silent, studying me for a second. It took all of my strength to not curl into a ball right in front of him, like my body seemingly was forcing me to do. I felt naked and vulnerable as I stood upright. I felt the need to physically shield myself. He looked at me, before leaving the room without another word, holding his hand up as if to tell me to 'wait right here.'
"It calms me down, and since it's everywhere it overwhelms my senses and then I usually can't really feel anything for a bit."
"Yeah, mate. Go and rest. You look like you could use it." He patted me on the shoulder. For some reason, I couldn't quite speak anymore. My mind was swirling with all of this information and the implications behind it...
"Ok." I set him down so we could go to the kitchen. He gripped my fingers as we walked. "Dada?" He prompted.
Hermione answered the phone after only a few rings. I was standing outside of the bathroom, waiting for Harry to finish changing into a hospital gown.
"Now, Wendy, let's not teach the
"...I can't do it... I'm failing... It's going to ruin his life." He sucked in a breath. "England isn't safe for him, and it's my fault."
I love you guys so much and I'm also hyped over the WandaVision finale so y'all get another chapter today. Enjoy! : )
"Harry, you know you can trust me, right? I know things haven't been the best with us, but I care about you. What's up?"
"Teddy is the same." She said. She glanced towards her husband opposite her, causing me to look as well. He was zoned out.
"I promise we won't be long. We'll be able to have dinner tonight and sleep together too. Don't worry." He told Scorpius, seemingly reading him like a book.
"At 4:15, his heart monitor spiked, paging me. He was found thrashing and crying. Upon asking, he said he was perfectly fine."
"Oh, erm... Sure, Vic! We'll teach you the basics, or Professor Belmonte will, that is," I commented, looking back at Luca. He smiled, but it was more like a grimace than anything else. I quickly looked back to Victorie.
"Anyway, Hermione, what were you saying?"
"He's waiting outside for me to explain- how do I explain that?!" I stared at Harry, as if this were his fault. I was angry, no, embarrassed.
"Well, last week, he..." I turned over to Harry, who seemed as though he was removing himself from the conversation, like he didn't want to acknowledge it. I sighed. "He... hurt himself. Pretty bad." Dr. Gilroy nodded her head slowly, turning to Harry.
"Scor, do you want some more mashed potatoes or chicken nuggets?" Uncle Harry asked Scorpius. I was half expecting Scorpius to not answer, but surprisingly, he did.
"It doesn't matter. I went to Madame Pomfrey. She said it's normal- er, it's no big deal, is what I mean to say. It just happens." My eyes widened in terror.
I felt my breaths quickening again... but I decided I would be better off adjusting to this darkness, as much as I'd come to detest it in these few short seconds. I don't know if I'll be in this room, in total darkness, for the rest of my life. I probably will, come to think of it. They'll tell me I need to stay here forever, alone, within these white and grey walls.
Yesterday really wasn't a good night for sleep. I was basically up the whole night. And to think, just last night I had that dinner where Maria decided to come and tell me I'm doing everything wrong. I scoffed at that. I rarely do anything wrong.
"It's not important really. Andromeda said I had to talk about it and I wouldn't tell her, so she let me go to you." I explained simply.
"Mr. Lupin? Hello? Earth to Lupin?"
"Alright, alright." she quieted them. "But remember, we're coming back tomorrow. Then the day after we're going to see if there's anything happening in the neighboring park."
"Well you need to get an education. Besides, you won't be away from me, not really. I'm always in your heart and in your mind, and you can write to me and I'll write to you every week."
the memory of my sons perception of a motherly figure! It's why I had to leave my peaceful American Muggle life not scared to leave the house, to come back to this goddamned place!"
We were driving home, and Draco was being unusually quiet, looking straight at the road with no expression. I looked ahead of us and saw a red car speeding towards us in the distance. I pointed it out, "Draco, That car is going a bit fast, and they're against traffic..." The car was starting to get closer. "Draco?" The car got closer and Draco didn't react, I felt adrenaline kick in. "Draco!" The cars horn blared. In an instant I held out my right hand, my body trying to get away from the oncoming impact, and screamed 'Arresto Momentum'. The car in front of us stopped, and Draco violently swerved out of the way before we could crash. He stopped our car, putting it in park. I was frozen in shock, still in my awkward half curled-up position where one leg was up on the seat and my right arm was pressed against the passenger door. My left hand slowly came down from it's position.
"Don't you imagine he feels the same when you do that to him?"
"Don't do what I did. You already know how I turned out because of it." The feeling in my arms became more persistent.
The calming draughts work, but they also seem to make Harry mad and rigid. I'd never seen anything like it, and it's not a known side effect of the potion. When he's mad, we argue, then we're both on the wrong side of the day. This is why he doesn't take the calming draughts. It makes him unreasonably upset and explosive.
"I rather think you did mean to cause a scene. You said several times you didn't mind sending the world into panic."
"Hey guys!" I sat down at the table. My breakfast appeared in front of me, which I immediately began eating. I looked up and saw Gabriel and Bonnie opposite to me, eyeing me with amusement, giggling.
I truly felt awful. Ron's not one to express very complicated feelings even when he has them, purely because he doesn't want to know what other people will think of them, or maybe he just doesn't want to get caught up in sensitive situations. His rant caught me off guard, making me forget my reasoning for missing this year, when I had fully intended to show up for him. "Ron I'm sorry-"
After that, I went to my room and I saw Harry sitting by a transfigured bed. I looked at dada, who simply said "I told Harry to transfigure a bed for Teddy while you were in the loo." I kind of felt like Teddy was giving me this weird look, like he was sad at me. Dada seemed to notice though, because he said "It seems you're getting sleepy, eh?" Teddy said yes, with a nod, then Dada said:
"You'll see them all the time still. And I'm absolutely sure you'll find good people at school. Also, if the bullying gets too bad you can always go to your Headmaster." I told him. He just hugged me tightly.
"Hi Scorpius!" Said Teddy. Scorpius waved back shyly.
"I know you think a lot of these deaths are your fault, Harry... I know that's part of the reason why you tried to off yourself." He said, turning to face me. "I understand that. Sometimes I wonder if I could have stopped Fred from dying." He said, sounding slightly nervous.
"Uncle Harry had Owled us saying that things were a bit busy, and that you all would be moving here." I didn't mention the newspapers because I don't think he knows... of course I've been keeping up to date. I hate to say it, but the rumors about Scorpius, Draco, and Uncle Harry were taking priority in Rita Skeeter's mind, making my name stay out of her papers for a while, and for that I was glad. Just because I wasn't in the paper so much anymore, didn't mean the kids wouldn't still make fun of me, hence my eye, but seeing Scorpius bounding with energy and the same childlike innocence that I had before moving here, told me he didn't know what they were saying: That Draco isn't really his dad.
"So the girl and the guy have different moves, so... I'll be the guy."
"Ay! Dónde está la olla arrocera?!" exclaimed the woman to no one in particular. I could only stare.
"What does a Boggart turn into for you?" He asked. I brought my hand down, thinking- remembering.
"Look. It runs in families, and everyone knows his father was one," she looked around again. "His dad once attacked the famous Harry Potter and his friends-" She looked around yet again. "And even the old potions master." I tensed, frozen in shock. "And Harry Potter was only thirteen years old." I stared at her wide eyed. "Just be careful... I'd stay away if I were you. He can't be trusted. I don't even know how he got into Hufflepuff." I nodded mutely, turning to leave when her firm hand landed on my shoulder, and she whipped me around to face her, now only centimeters away from me. "When you finish with this book, don't take it to the library, give it back to me. It's from the restri-"
Hagrid shakes his head, rubbing at his eyes and forcing a smile. “No. I’m not mad a’ you, it’s okay.”
“He’s lucky he’s dead,” Sirius growls, “otherwise I would have killed him.”
“I’ll take him the infirmary,” Ron says with a disgusted look towards Lockhart. “You lot should head to Dumbledore’s office.”
Harry is constantly surprised at how many people know how good Ron is at chess, and still think that he’s just a pretty face. He just doesn’t normally care to do anything about it.
He doesn’t speak Parseltongue, obviously, but he’s pretty sure that’s her offended hissing.
Oh, merlin, now Draco’s about to start crying, because it’s clear he’s included in that. Maybe all of Slytherin house is included in that, even, and really, how can anyone who knows Hagrid manage to hate him?
Ze shakes the tray at them impatiently. There’s already over a dozen wands rolling around it. “Hand over your wand. I’ll keep it on my desk uncovered for the full class so you’ll be able to see it at all times.”
Cedric catches the snitch once, and Harry and Viktor each manage to catch it twice.
“Am I campaigning right now?” she asks.
He slides off Firenze’s back and he can land on his feet just fine, but Harry’s smiling a little bit when he falls into his arms instead, squeezing him almost too tightly for a moment before putting him down.
“There are more people around Draco than just his parents,” he says. “It’s fine. He knows what he’s doing.” Now, that part is a big fat lie, but it’s one he’s doing his best to tell himself too, so it only seems fair.
,” she hisses, and the water is steaming off of her. Do none of these people remember that this girl is a quarter veela? “You took my sister! You took her from me!”
“Scram,” he says, switching back to English. “Everything’s fine. I’m fine. Don’t be late to class.”
Harry looks to his soulmate, who isn’t saying anything, but his hair is unkept because he keeps running his hand through it. “Draco?”
“If you have polyjuice, why doesn’t the order just come here and pretend to be you?” Filius asks. “Also, are we no longer pretending that you and the Gryffindors aren’t at each other’s throats?”
Hagrid gives him a disapproving look, but he’s not very good at them so he drops it a moment later and steps aside. “Ye better come in. Yer in luck – I jus’ made rock cakes!”
“We’re adults,” Sirius says, and okay, he definitely sees it now. Remus and his mum look mostly normal, both of them standing with a half dozen darts floating next to them, but both his dad and Sirius are sprawled out in the chairs, collars open. His dad’s even put in his hair in a ponytail, which is crazy. Draco will rock a messy bun if it’s one of those days, but his dad pretty much never has his hair so much pulled back in public.
“No, I didn’t mean,” he shakes his head, “We can go do something actually date like, sorry, I just wasn’t thinking.”
“It’ll be good for you,” she urges. “It’ll help your control, which will make you better at more than just healing. It’ll help your charms and alchemy too. Filius thinks it’s a good idea as well, you can ask him.”
to do anything about it!”
“TILLY!” He roars, and she presses her hand to her ears and cowers. He’ll feel bad about that later, but he needs information now. “Library or study?”
Snape doesn’t bother to hide his eyeroll.
She can’t say yes, can’t nod her head or write it out or anything, but her whole body slumps, giving in, a clear sign of surrender.
The Veelas pour onto the field, and they are very beautiful, of course. But as most of the stadium loses their mind, shouting and waving at them, Harry only blinks in confusion. Ron and most of Weasleys are nearly falling out of the box they’re leaning so far out, and Harry grabs the back of Ron and Hermione’s robes as they yell at the beautiful dancing women, just in case. Bill has a hand fisted in the back of his father’s jacket as well as Charlie’s, and Fred and George are holding back Ginny and Percy.
“Well, we forged your name on the permit, so that might be a little hard,” Remus says. “Besides, like you’re one to talk.” Arthur just sighs.
“Maybe,” Ginny says, “but what I still don’t get is why you can touch the book when the rest of us can’t.”
Blaise shakes his head, but Draco can see how relieved he is. “Pansy was shrieking something awful about how magical wounds were deadly. Daphne apparently had to smother her with her pillow to get her to shut up.”
to me, and I’m still
Catalina and Sharon share glance. The fact that he’s tall enough that they can’t quite do it over his head and they have to lean forward to look around him kind of ruins any sort of subtly it was supposed to have, but Catalina says, “Tell us about the centaur.”
Harry figures this means Ron and Hermione aren’t showing up either. He hopes they’re all getting together without them, at least. He cups Draco’s face in his hands, pressing another, firmer kiss to his lips. “I want to see them too. But I’m glad I get to be alone with you.”
“It was still you,” she insists, “You were in the chamber, you did this to this girl, and you reanimated all those skeletons!”
He doesn’t get a chance to yell at him before he feels the heat of several spells passing over them, and, okay, maybe Ron had the right idea.
“Have you told Harry yet?” Pansy asks, looking over at him with her big brown eyes.
“This is incredible,” he breathes.
He sounds completely serious. Harry knows that a good portion of the underage drinking that goes on is due to Madame Rosmerta and her loose rules in regards to selling alcohol. The more money she’s offered, the less questions she asks. Clearly that’s her policy across the board. Well. She’s got to make a living, as Pansy would say.
Stealing Gryffindor’s sword out from underneath Dumbledore’s nose is impossible. It can’t be done.
to find out what happened with Draco. By the way people are looking at him, it’s obvious that something did. He notices him ducking out of the stands with the others, and they can’t meet tonight, but he wants to, he wants to know what the hell is going on.
The other woman slaps her hand down in front of her, and everyone jumps at the sound. “Well, Cornelius, pronounce him guilty and give him his sentence. This is what you wanted, isn’t it?”
” Ron mutters, Harry’s comforter pulled around his shoulders, and the only bit of him they can see is his bright red hair. “
She looks up at him, and tries to smile, but doesn’t do a very good job of it. “It’s silly.”
That hadn’t been what he was expecting. “Oh! Uh, cool. Are either of you?”
The topic came up when I asked him just how many Muggle things he had done in his time in America, because he clearly had the time to get used to and good at Muggle cooking. He spoke about his time studying for a drivers license, and how it took him so long because he really didn't know enough things about how the world worked. Then, he brought up movies, and brought up 6-year-old Scorpius' obsession with Spider-Man.
"Who would have bloody known..." he said.
"I- I still... am." replied Harry. I swallowed hard, and retained a straight face, keeping my thoughts and expressions to myself.
I put myself in the nearest bedroom. Everything is swaying, my clothes are itchy, everything is itchy. My nausea had risen from my stomach to my chest, keeping me with an overwhelming lack of oxygen, or so I felt. My thighs began to ache. I brought myself to the floor. My vision was now spotty, all I could hear was static, and the nausea was not leaving me. I forced an enormous breath into myself. It helped, but not enough. I felt faint. I'm struggling to keep myself conscious. I heard a thump, followed by an acute rush of air, and something on my arms, something warm, but I couldn't tell what it was.
"Good. We need to stick together, so we can get through this." I reached out, taking his hand. I felt as he squeezed it three times. It's something he's been doing for a while now. I guessed it was to show that he's here, with me. I squeezed back as I always do, to show I'm here with him as well.
"Is it alright if we have this conversation... tomorrow? I would like to continue sleeping." I said with an exhausted and weary tone.
"Oh please it was one button to press. You have to let me do some things for you, besides I really don't mind." He said while pulling out a fork from the drawer.
"Count the beats for me." I told him. And when he began counting aloud, I could see he was losing focus from his irritation. Stopping, before realizing it, and starting again, only to stop right after, more focused on counting each time I tapped on his back, until eventually, he stopped.
"She said I'm going to attack you and put you in the hospital wing." I paused,  choking on the air as I took it down in rapid gulps.
"What if we get a look at her? JK Rowling, I mean. Sure she may be under some sort of disguise, but maybe if we meet her in person we can confirm... you know?" I swallowed tensely. Hermione turned her head to Ron with surprise.
"Please, please just let me, please..." I had to suck in a breath.
"He comes by every day, you know. He asks us how you're doing..." I mentioned, easing my way into the topic. This was the first time Harry wasn't protesting to a meaningful conversation since he asked to stay here. He sighed, moving from his spot on the bed to a spot on the edge, next to me.
"March second! Does that sound important to you?" He continued, prodding at the situation. That was when it dawned on me.
"You miss him, don't you."
"No, Harry. You avoid things."
"Harry." I opened my eyes, slightly surprised by the sheer closeness between me and Draco. He's laying right in front of me and our faces are only centimeters apart. I hate this distant feeling. I hate that he's right here and I can't feel it.
"What?!" the rest of us exclaimed. Wendy scoffed.
Thank Merlin for Wendy.
With my hands at either side of my head, I closed my eyes, forcing a large breath in. The hairs on the back of my neck stood, and an itch crept slowly beneath my skin irritatingly.
"I- I wanted to say thank you..." I explained. He looked around, running a hand through his hair and sighing again.
I found myself getting closer to the floor.
"Oh, okay- wait-" I swallowed roughly. "Hermione, surely you couldn't..."
"I guess I had to talk to him. He didn't have any friends, so I went up to him one day. I had to find him and follow him around for the first few days, but eventually, he was the one following me. He only agrees to come to lunch with you guys when I ask a few times... I know it's stroking his overinflated ego,
I turned to Ginny and she only nodded then looked down. "Scorpius say goodbye!"
"Not here." I whispered, suddenly paranoid.  I grabbed onto his forearm and he, quickly realizing what I was about to do, held onto Scorpius, and with a twist and a whir, we were in 12, Grimmauld Place.
Suddenly I wondered if Draco did that all the time for Scorpius.
My hand brushed the top of the radio, making three streaks where dust was picked up. I rubbed the tips of my fingers together to get rid of the grey stuff that now coated them. My hand shook slightly, and I blinked several times, deciding to open the drawer right below it. Lots of folded bits of parchment were in that drawer, along with an assortment of quills, ink, pens, and pencils. The parchment on the top was one that I had never seen before, with his name in elegant cursive writing:
"You don't have a pink shirt."
"It was the right thing to do" I continued. "Going to platform nine and three-quarters was good... you put his needs first- and I knew you would." We remained unmoved. I continued to speak.
"Would the two of you like a beer?" She said kindly. Harry responded before me.
"I know it isn't... it's good to recognize and understand your feelings, and it's perfectly fine to be upset. You have good reason, and I'm here for you and I'll help you work through it." I reasoned. "Now, another thing I wanted to ask you about, was that day when you thought I had gone." His expression darkened deeply.
Sophia and Tonks duck in behind them, each of them summoning their own shields instead of ducking under his. “Hello!” Sophia shouts. “Is anyone here?”
Harry shakes his head. “Don’t worry about me. I’m going to stop this.”
Several looks pass across both their faces. “No flying for a month,” Sirius declares.
Blaise sighs. Pansy and Millicent are delighted. “She’ll do it.”
“Of course,” Flitwick answers, “no rush, just whenever you get to it.”
to get married, he’s just never really thought about it. Except he does kind of want to get married, eventually, some day. To Draco, specifically, not just in general.
“What would you know about good ideas?” she asks, and okay, rude. Accurate, but rude. “Don’t go anywhere.”
“Well, you know you love telling me how wrong I am, so won’t you look it over for me?”
Sirius, Remus, all the Weasleys, and Fleur are glaring at Dumbledore, daring him to cause a fuss about it. He raises an eyebrow. “Very well. On to other matters.”
She pulls him into a hug tight enough that it steals all his breath, then kisses him on both cheeks. “I love you. Be safe.”
“My jealousy pants?” Draco asks, momentarily distracted from being mad.
Suspicious deaths of ministry officials that make the third page news? Cool. Unfortunate, but cool. What was a Devil’s Snare doing in the department of mysteries, is what Draco really wants to know.
“And I need a certified potions master to bear witness to each step of my process, otherwise the board could contest my results,” Quinn finishes. Snape look irritated that he’s been exposed as doing something helpful.
Keenan coughs, clutching his stomach, and says, “Fuck your whole family, Weasley, Cassius’s social standing takes a hit every time he puts his dick in you. You must be a good fuck to be worth all that.”
There’s a bright blue light, and Draco is standing there once more. He’s too pale, and his eyes are wide. He smooths back his hair, and his hands are shaking. Harry hopes he’s the only one who notices. “Much obliged, Professor,” he says, voice coming out even.
Actually, even with that, it’s still a little weird.
Ron blinks, his mouth dropping open before he narrows his eyes. “Lavender Brown, are you
,” she says finally, darting her tongue out to taste the air next to his head. “
Ron grimaces. “Does this mean I have to take Newts potions? Thought I’d get out of that one.”
“All the more reason to use my money!” he says. “Look, if you don’t think I get a huge kick out of using my asshole family’s fortune on my werewolf soulmate, you definitely haven’t been paying attention since we were, I don’t know, twelve.” He pauses and points an accusing finger at Remus, who only looks amused. “Also, it’s
“I suppose the dementors just and up and left for no reason?” he asks. “And all the prisoners, they what? Disappeared into thin air?”
“Are you going to tell them that?” Hermione asks.
“I was so
He should have taken Millie. She doesn’t have any interest in playing, but she has a fanatical devotion to quidditch. She might have at least enjoyed it.
Her mouth cracks into a grin, “Only you would do a good thing and be worried someone would blackmail you for it. I just wanted you to know that I know, so that when no one finds out, you know I can be trusted.”
Hermione is staring at her book but she hasn’t turned a page since Lavender came over. Harry kind of wants to die a little bit. Why is he always caught in the middle of these things? This is like Viktor in fourth year but somehow worse in every way, and just like before he’s trapped at this bloody table.
There’s a faint hissing sound and Harry translates, “Winky said that she didn’t trust her not to cause trouble without you or her there to look out for her, so Winky brought her over this morning.”
Yeah, no. Harry’s lifts his wand, but then the door to the room bangs open.
Draco shoves Harry off of him into Ron, who doesn’t so much as twitch as he flops across him. Hermione just sighs. “Will all of you knock it off? You goofing off won’t exactly but Snape in a better mood.”
She curtsies and disappears. He wants to ask if she delivered his letter to Harry, but that’s going to have to wait until Voldemort’s English understanding snake isn’t around to eavesdrop. He cautiously pushes Nagini off his chest, and she doesn’t complain, just slides onto his carpet. Well, there’s no getting back to sleep after that.
“I needed someplace we wouldn’t be overheard.”
“A cutting jinx,” he says.
“My math was
,” he shoots back, then realizes this is a really good way to get himself grounded over the holiday break, and adds, “
“Slowly,” he warns, and one of them must be listening to him, or maybe McGonagall really is that out of it, but either way it takes her nearly a fully minute to drink whole potion, and when she’s done her head thumps back against the bed, exhausted. Now that she’s semi-conscious, he makes sure to cast a pain numbing spell before cutting into her again. He has to drain the new, clean blood out with the bad, which is the one downside of this.
“No,” Blaise says, yanking Neville out the door, “if you’d wanted an explanation, you shouldn’t have done something so stupid. If you live, I’ll tell you everything.”
It’s not that fun.
Ron rolls over so his head’s hanging off the bed and he’s looking at her upsidedown. “Okay, but I must remind you that I don’t actually know how to do alchemy. And that I don’t do math.”
The soft blue light of the shield erupts from his wand just in time to stop them both from being crushed by a large piece of the stone ceiling. It cracks and breaks over his shield. Draco grits his teeth and is forced to his knees from the force of it, still holding the shield above them as more bits of ceiling come crashing down on them.
“You should work on that, it’s so uncouth,” he says, and he’s lucky Millie likes him enough not to strangle him.
“Because we’re having a
It’s not signed. Harry raises an eyebrow, and Ron explains, “I sent a letter to Percy the first day asking what was going on with Umbridge. I’m not sure what we’re waiting for, though. Another letter maybe?”
