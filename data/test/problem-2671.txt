Of course, when Draco arrives on the beach, the flames of the bonfire roar and dance in a way that makes his skin crawl with memories he’s trying to suppress, and while witches and wizards mill about in the sand, chattering in this language and that, none of them are the one he’s looking for.
Draco doesn’t understand Potter’s position exactly, but by all accounts, while they knew about the war here, it was something distant, foreign, something that happened somewhere else. That was the draw of it for Draco, no one to know his face or his name and judge him before he had a chance to change their minds.
“Are you mad that I left? I didn’t want to leave, I didn’t, really. I had to go I had an-”
Draco can feel Harry watching him as he reads through the last few paragraphs that Harry wrote about Draco’s core. It’s mostly academic, with a hint of flattery, which is probably unnecessary for the assignment, but Draco can’t bring himself to complain. They’d agreed to each cover the write-up of the other’s core, allowing a less biased assessment, but these words in Harry’s cramped scrawl are more biased than anticipated
Saturday.”
“I met my best friends in my very first year at Hogwarts, you know. They were Gryffindors too, like me and you.” Scorpius flinches at this, but Harry carries on, pretending not to notice.
The moments that follow are tense and quiet, broken only by the crackle of Pomfrey’s magic and the thankfully fading whimpers from Scorpius, each of which seem to set his father further and further on edge.
Potter’s head is buried in a book, and strange as it is, Draco takes a moment to stare. He really doesn’t look any more rested than he had a week ago - and he certainly didn’t spend the weekend out with their fellow students...it’s a small town, Draco would have seen him.
Their exchange is cut short as a stern looking woman strides to the front of the room, garnering the attention of the class with her presence alone. She reminds Draco of McGonagall, even with her brown skin and closely cropped black curls.
Next chap is the beginning of the end! I’m so sad!
Their second day at the beach doesn’t involve any notes at all. Draco’s brought his school bag, but he’s pleased to see that Potter hasn’t. Instead he’s empty-handed, in navy swim trunks, shirtless, with that same ridiculous hat on. His skin is radiant in the sunlight, and Draco is careful not to let that slip out loud.
Draco spends the week ruminating on it, wondering if he should try the projection spell on himself beforehand, to at least know what he’ll be exposing to Potter before the inevitable moment of no return.
Harry just shrugs, “I used it to fix my original wand and snapped it in half. It’s too much power, it shouldn’t exist.” He draws a few random shapes in the sand and then looks back up at Draco, “Tell me about your plans.”
So they continue.
leaves at 5:30, and Draco stopped asking why. Now he’s curious again as Harry, in a flurry of jeans and socks and finished essays, sees himself out of Draco’s room without even a word of goodbye, despite the way Draco calls out his name.
A spark of amusement dances across Potter’s face but Draco has no time to be annoyed before-
Confused, Draco looks to Harry, who gives him a tentative soft smile, and opens the gate to walk up the path.
He can feel Potter’s eyes on him for a long time before he follows suit and they lapse into a busy silence once again.
It’s only after Draco stares at him for a long moment that Potter
Harry reflexively ducks away from her hand as she reaches out to him. “I’ve been a little busy Myrtle, sorry about that.” He does feel bad for the ghost, knowing her story and what Voldemort did to her because of her muggle parents. He tries to keep her company now and then, with the added benefit of relieving unsuspecting students of her antics, and ensuring she doesn’t turn up uninvited in the shower in his quarters...again.
Draco has to chuckle at how mundane it is, but he nods, even though Potter isn’t looking. “The only subject I ever really loved in school. I thought I’d have trouble figuring out what to do after...everything, since ‘the family business’ wasn’t much of an option anymore, but I didn’t.” Harry is looking at him now, his face interested, and Draco goes on, “It was McGonagall, surprisingly enough, that approached me a month after my trial. She helped me get the NEWT and suggested some programs, this one included.”
“I uh- I know I left before we could finish the notes we needed but we can make up the ti-”
“Yes, yes, we get it, you’ve made a miraculous recovery.” Malfoy’s sarcasm is laced with fondness. “Alas, your healer wants you to stay a few more days.”
“Your core is dark, but only barely. It’s on the cusp of a transition, like it’s lightening by the day.” Potter looks pleased to announce this, and Draco can’t say he’s not pleased to hear it. It’s better than he could have hoped for. Perhaps living in the depths of the darkness didn’t leech as much nefarious magic into him as he’d thought.
Draco absolutely doesn’t speed up at the idea that Potter may be there with answers to why he’s turned up here, of all places.
He doesn’t leave, though Draco can sense the underlying urgency in his voice. “Then I’ll see you Saturday?”
Dean smiles, “That’s lovely, Harry. I’m surprised Molly Weasley lets you get away with missing Christmas, though.”
There’s only a flash of darkness in green eyes at that before Potter shrugs, “I was a bit occupied, wasn’t I?” he’s lost in his own thoughts for a moment before looking thoughtfully at Draco, “After everything was over...I wished more than anything I could go back to eleven and try it again, but as a normal kid. I missed out on a lot of things.”
“Malfoy?” Comes Potter’s incredulous voice.
Draco sets his bag neatly on the floor and turns to greet his new classmate, stopping short as wide green eyes mimic the surprise in his own.
Having never sucked cock before, Draco finds himself shocked by how desperately he wants to strip that last bit of fabric away and see what Harry tastes like there, but rough hands in his hair are pulling him back up, and claiming his mouth in a desperate kiss, even as Harry slips one hand down to cup Draco through his trousers, a gentle squeeze and then a pump, and another, and a second hand joins to wrestle open the buttons of his trousers, four of the them in a line that slowly reveal the way Draco’s cock is straining against his black briefs.
Dean and Seamus got married several years back, and Harry attended the wedding along with a handful of their other classmates. It was the kind of thing that made sense to all of them, even if they never would have predicted it back in school. Harry supposes that the two of them finding a way to be honest about how they felt for one another is one of the more wonderful things to come out of the war.
he quotes, “doesn’t that mean it’s both?”
(See the end of the chapter for
than anywhere Draco has ever been. “I think you’ve proven well enough that family doesn’t have to share blood to be, well, family.” He bounces Teddy on his hip and wins a giggle for his efforts, “And I might be his favourite now, but you’re not missing out on much,” he adds with a grin, moving to settle on the floor with Teddy and his toys.
Draco raises an eyebrow, nodding for him to continue, and not even trying to ignore the flutter of joy as Teddy wraps his hand around one of Draco’s fingers.
There’s no malice in his voice. Instead, a hint of...amusement? ...Teasing, lingers there. Harry grabs at the opportunity this presents in the only way he knows how. “Yes, well, imagine my shock to see your miniature sitting in my classroom with a red and gold tie on.”
“I’d be okay with more writing if it always ended like this.”
Draco quite likes it.
“You will do nothing, Healer Malfoy. This boy is your son, not your patient.”
Then his trousers are gone and it's them both in their underwear, pressed together against the side of Draco’s bed, and Draco finds that he wants Harry right here, like this, so he dips a hand beneath the waistband of his boxers and pulls out his cock, tugging the offending garment down to his thighs at the same time. And then he’s holding Harry Potter’s dick in his hand, and as strange as that thought is, his own jumps a little in his briefs at the knowledge.
Okay, so maybe there was a time, between divorcing Ginny and taking up the Defense post at Hogwarts, that he’d done quite a bit of...casual dating. It was good for him, really. After all of the distractions he’d dealt with as a teenager, then marriage straight away...there hadn’t been time for him to explore.
She begins to read the pairings for what is apparently a partnered project, and Draco finds his throat quite dry at the idea of examining his own soul. Sure, he’s trying to change things, but he doesn’t think it’s all sunshine and daisies in there. He certainly doesn’t need a stranger rooting around in a place as personal as his core.
He hopes Potter can
With a curt nod, Minerva sweeps out of the room, leaving Harry in the quiet with Malfoy, who is clinging tightly to Scorpuis’s hand, but looking warily up at his old rival. They regard each other with a tired tension, one that feels worn and outdated. Years have passed - decades, even - is there really any benefit to clinging to a drama that has long played out?
It’s habit that makes him glance at the map spread across his table before he leaves. The castle is nearly cleared out with everyone down at the pitch for the match. A few students linger in the library and the Great Hall, but not many. The rest of the rooms and corridors are emp-
Only his worst fucking enemy. Or former enemy. He isn’t strictly sure where they stand, but some part of him knows what will happen before Marsh even gets the words out.
“Harry Potter, you’re a dirty rotten cheater!” Draco cries, reaching out to shove his shoulder.
Don’t worry, it only took 13 chapters for them to kiss 🤷🏻♀️
how she…”
“I guess not? Or maybe...I thought the dark would be more. I didn’t expect so much…”
Fall term moves along, just like any other year. The weather cools, and the students settle into a routine. Very little out of the ordinary occurs at Hogwarts these days - ordinary being a relative term.
, Potter?”
“Your bond is as strong as if the whole Black family was still alive,” Harry breathes softly.
And with that he’s grabbed his bag and run out the door, leaving a very confused Draco behind to obsess over what’s just happened.
A beat of silence, then Draco looks up and...when did he get so close? Harry can see the ombre of his eyelashes again, the blue-ish flecks in pewter eyes. If he were to lean forward they would be...
“Is it different from what you expected?” The question is reasonable, though Draco hadn’t expected it. He opens and closes his mouth once or twice before sighing and shaking his head.
“It’s not what I was looking for, really, but there’s a kind of family magic that grows in the oldest of bloodlines…” he trails off as his eyes dance across a page of the book then shiftback up at Draco and Teddy. “The more witches and wizards in a family, the more powerful the familial bond. You’ve got blood from one of the largest magical families on record, Teddy does too.”
“What? Cinder- What? No. Like The Sidhe Knights of Beltane, or Fae of Darkness.”
With a soft sigh, Harry makes his way over to the boy, whose gaze has fallen back to his shoes, shiny and black and perfectly polished. Harry presses his back to the wall and slides down to sit on the bathroom floor next to his student.
The gold is there, vast spatterings of it throughout, from the base to the top, and the same silver-white of Draco’s forms the background, but what is surprising is the riot of colour in the very base of Potter’s core.
Draco’s other classes are more specific to his course of study, his mastery in Potions.
“I’ve sent him a patronus already, he’ll likely be here any moment.” Harry is surprised to hear Pomfrey chime in, but his confusion is set aside as the sound of the floo activating in Pomfrey’s office alerts them to an incoming visitor.
“Mister Malfoy, you’ll be paired with Mister Potter.”
Marsh crosses to her desk to pick up a parchment, continuing to speak as she walks, “As we learn and practice magic, our cores become conditioned. Imagine each spell we cast as a single drop into a bucket of clean water, a dark spell is a drop of blood, a light spell a drop of milk, each shifts the core, in essence,

Thanks for the great reception so far, y’all warm my heart <3
“Aren’t I..?”
His heart seizes.
“So, what have you learned?” he asks lightly, nodding his head to Potter’s notes as he retakes his seat.
Harry snorts, “I don’t know how big the plan is, but it’s first a mastery in magical theory, then I’ve got an apprenticeship lined up with a wandmaker in Oslo….then my own shop, I guess.”
“I’m all he’s got. He lives here with me, and his caretaker watches him while I’m in classes. She usually leaves at 6.” There’s careful meaning in the last part, and Draco suddenly feels like a monster.
“Our wands are made from products of the earth, wood and animals, they’re only conduits, but their makeup helps us to channel the earth alongside our own core!”

.” A cool blue stream of magic pours from Draco’s wand into both of Potter’s ears, and the saviour scrunches his nose in momentary discomfort. “Get over it, Potter, you’ll thank me in a moment.”
Draco scoffs. “The noble and most ancient house of Black…”
know, professor,” that she throws back at him.
Harry’s eyebrows skyrocket at that, but he shrugs, glancing back. “I’ve not done anything.”
Perhaps they are no longer rivals, or enemies, maybe now they are just a teacher and a parent. Men who have changed enough from when they knew one another that their history is irrelevant. Right now, this young boy in a hospital bed, he is what is relevant.
When class draws to a close, Draco carefully suggests that this more sensitive part of their project be completed in private. At least he can shield himself from prying eyes, unlike in the library or at the beach, even if there’s no stopping Potter from a free peek at his truest self.
Harry watches for a moment, then leaves.
Draco has pulled himself up off the towel now, risen to his knees and rested back on his heels. He nods in agreement, “I wanted that too. Do it over but with different…influences. Make better choices.” He doesn’t know where his candour is coming from, but it’s surprisingly easy to share. He watches Potter’s eyes drift down to his bare chest, surely looking for scars that have long since healed. Neither of them mentions it.
“Commonly used spells are just earth magic shaped and formed for a specific purpose, honed and repeated across centuries for the benefit...or sometimes the detriment of our kind.”
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth ticks up, even as he tries to scowl. In that moment Harry feels something shift. An uneasy peace forms.
be a Gryffindor, I’m a Ma-” with great effort, Scorpius silences himself, like the words want to come out but he’s clinging to them as tightly as he can.
It’s Draco’s intention to corner Potter for an interrogation as soon as class is over, but the slippery bastard is out the door with only a glance and an infuriatingly casual wave in Draco’s direction.
When Malfoy nods gratefully at her, the headmistress turns to Harry and speaks quietly, “If you would, please see to Poppy - this kind of magic takes a toll - then join me in my office. I’ll contact the Ministry about the stone.”
“The beach.”
A thrill runs through him and Draco nods, dropping one hand to the flat of Harry’s lower back while the other winds through his hair, “No more writing.” He kisses Harry solidly on the mouth, revelling in the rough slide of ever-chapped lips against his and glances at the clock, which shows only three pm. “And we have a lot of time to kill,” he adds suggestively, nipping at Harry’s ear and getting a low whine in response.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco ponders this for a moment, pushing his embarrassment at being caught in his discomfort aside to consider. He might as well get it over with. The pure gold of Potter’s core will be too hard to follow.
After a beat to compose himself, Draco shakes his head, “It isn’t. It’s neutral.”
It’s an obvious play at changing the subject, but Draco concedes, shrugging but making a mental note to come back to this topic eventually. “The potions mastery is most of the plan. I guess afterward I’ll...open an apothecary, do some research in my free time...make reparations.” He trails off quietly, he hadn’t meant to say that last part, but he finds that maybe a part of him did. He wants Harry to know that he doesn’t feel finished with making up for his past.
“It’s alright. I...me too.” Draco admits, looking out to sea rather than at Potter’s face. “I came here to be away from all of that. To be normal, for a fresh start. After my parents....” he trails off, still gazing at the sparkling water. He doesn't need to explain, Potter surely knows how his father was killed in Azkaban, how a fellow disciple of the Dark Lord had taken out his anger about Lucius’s short sentence with his own bare hands, how Draco’s mother had faded away from a broken heart.
, only a shade in one direction or another. They are not opposites so much as they are just,
“That’s ridiculous. The fae have nothing to do with love.” He states, eyes narrowed. He could say something about muggles and their ridiculous blindness to the truths of the world, but he refrains. Which is something, for him. “Magic fairy tales are more like...cautionary tales. Embellished true stories from Merlin’s time when the fae were less reclusive and more...prone to havoc. They’re to teach little witches and wizards not to mess about with fairies. That they aren’t to be trusted. Their magic is strange and overpowering.”
“He’s right about that. Your house doesn’t define you. It gives you a place to be yourself, and that’s the most important thing. You

bathroom don’t want to talk to me,” she glares at Scorpius, who is still staring at them both like a deer in wandlight.
“Harry what’s going on?” He breathes after a moment of taking in the genuine comfort of holding this child in his arms, hardly able to tear his eyes away from the cheerfully babbling baby to look at Harry.
or uh, Snow White?”
He doesn’t, though. Whether he’s too afraid to examine himself so closely, or just to do it alone, he’s not sure, but either way, his core remains unseen by the time he opens the door to allow Potter into his sanctum a short five days later.
*****
“It’s him, and my mother,” Potter answers the question Draco didn’t dare to actually ask, and Draco remains quiet, wondering if he’ll continue.
Scorpius wipes his face with his robe sleeve and meets Harry’s gaze again, “He says it doesn’t matter what house you’re in, it only matters what you do once you get there.” The words come out in a way that is tellingly rote; Scorpius has obviously heard them time and again. Harry can’t help the surprise that bubbles up in his chest - maybe Malfoy was trying to do better with his kid than his parents had.
He’s opening his mouth to ask what exactly is going on when he realizes that Harry’s gone off somewhere in the house. It’s only a short moment before he wanders back in, a little boy, maybe two at the oldest, on his hip, with a toothy smile and a riot of lime green hair. And Draco feels inexplicably

“Wandmaking? Really?” Draco weighs that information against what he’s learned about Harry this year, and begins to nod thoughtfully, the interest in earth magic, the enthusiasm about wands being a conduit, it makes sense. “I can see that, actually. Especially with the whole elder wand thing...you’ll be a hit, won’t be able to keep a wand on your shelves.”
They’ve found a spot just within the privacy spells of the wizarding beach, and there are surprisingly few people about for mid-afternoon. The sun beats down, hot, from a cloudless sky and the ocean pulses steadily against the shore, calm, sparkling, and blue. Draco thinks he might abandon his towel for the water at some point before the day is out. It’s quite superior to being cooped up inside all day.
have my NEWTs.”
“I’ve healed,” he says meaningfully, and Harry’s eyes find his and that green is bright as ever.
He’s at the wall, an ink-stained finger tracing a line of red, “She died to save me, it’s ancient magic, but it was there...all along, fighting him. He was there too, powerful, but helpless against her love.”
She nods breathlessly, “Thanks, professor. Any advice?”
No. No strangers peering into his soul.
Draco offers him a thoughtful look and glances between him and Teddy, then meaningfully at the home around them, because it’s definitely more of a

Everything old is new again. Or something like that.
Harry grins back. “Good luck today. You’ll do great. Your team is behind you, you’ve built a good one, you’ve practised like crazy.”
Potter looks up at him and shrugs, “Just tired. Been a long week.”
And Draco is left alone with a sense of unease, trying not to wonder if he’s made a mistake, or if Harry thinks so.
expect exactly what he’s seeing. Is Draco so transparent? There’s something of a smile on Potter’s face, but then it falls to curiosity and he leans in, getting a better look at the top of Draco’s core, “What’s this blue?”

strategy against him and arrives just a moment before Marsh does, his half of the project in his grasp. He listens to Marsh congratulate them, and give them a quick runthrough of her grading process before presenting a box in which they are to place their finished projects. He turns to Potter only long enough to take the other half of their papers, then orders them as he walks up to Marsh’s desk. He thanks her politely, and proceeds out the door, without even glancing back to the desk he’s shared with Potter all term. Maybe he’ll switch it up and make a new acquaintance when they resume next week.
Anyway, Draco is certain there’s something else going on. What evening obligations could someone like Potter have in a place like this? Some people must recognize him, surely, but if the students in their class are any example, the hype over the saviour here is lukewarm at best, at least in comparison to wizarding Britain.
“We don’t have to write anymore,” he confirms, departing the dining table to cross the room and stand before Harry, whose knees easily drift apart to make room for him. “Until the next project, that is.”
There’s a nod of understanding there, “Hard not to start caring for them.”
Myrtle greets Harry as he walks through the door, his eyes already quickly scanning the room to find Scorpius on the floor, his knees pulled up to his chest. He appears shocked to see Harry, but otherwise unharmed.
Draco is quiet for a moment, weighing his response. His curiosity and a mild scornfulness get the better of him. “Are you
looking at him with those wide eyes, Harry, his university classmate, Harry, who he grudgingly enjoys spending time with, Harry, who isn’t at all the person Draco made him out to be.
Charis laughs, “Tell me something I don’t know.”
One such student is Charis Hadley, a seventh year Gryffindor, and captain of the Quidditch team. She’s also muggleborn, and, as Harry learned back in her first year, not truly welcome in her parents’ home.
Even before the kiss Harry spent nearly all of his mealtimes with Draco, and that doesn’t change, except it does.  Lunch in the great hall filled with polite conversation about work and the weather, becomes lunch in Harry’s office, or dinner in Draco’s rooms, and discussions about their days, their students, their likes and their dislikes, their hopes and fears, and everything in between.
It’s all
Draco bids him farewell and sets the notes aside, thinking a swim will clear his mind.
Meanwhile, Harry’s managed to get Draco’s shirt unbuttoned and is pushing it off his shoulders, stopping to stare at Draco’s chest, flawless and lightly tanned from the sun. Draco takes his moment of inaction to tug Harry’s shirt up over his head, but stops when he sees the sadness creeping in on Harry’s face. “Don’t, please…”
He doesn’t see Potter for the rest of the day.
it stirring up his core, and fights the instinct to ward it off. Potter directs his wand from Draco’s chest to the nearby wall, and pinpricks of light begin to appear, until the shape of his core takes form. The closest thing Draco can think to associate it with is a harp, the way it waves across the top and tapers down to a point, the base, where a wizard’s most prominent affiliation lives. He’s surprised to see that his is silvery-white, neutral.
Narcissa’s smile was subtle, but there. “Yes, you will.”
Harry laughed, already sitting up. “It’ll be a minute. I think. You can stay here.”
Draco braved the woods again a few days later. With a lot of Tainara based research, he was confident enough to try.
“Of course she’s yours. You’re bonded and all.”
“I love the Brazilian myths,” Harry said apropos of nothing, pushing away one last branch before the sight of the river reached Draco’s eyes.
. He felt
Draco was becoming progressively aware of Tainara’s disappearing skills, and he doubted she didn’t really know how to perform the transportation spell everyone around there did but him. “She was just here.”
With Harry's back to Saci, the creature could not see his face, the darkness in his eyes. Draco wanted to hold on to him, not to let anyone get close to Harry, not to let anyone see what was happening to him. Draco needed to protect Harry from whatever it was. He just didn't know how.
But it was too late. Potter had opened his shirt, and he deflated almost immediately when he saw the Sectumsempra’s faint scars—the ones Potter had put there years ago. They weren’t open, despite the blood soaking his skin. It didn’t hurt at all, and the only explanation Draco could think of was that the blood had come from the nightmare.
“It was the fox who spoke what the boy wanted to know. ‘The other animals are afraid of talking, but not me. It was the King Vulture, who found the secret to eternal youth and thinks there’s no point in remaining young if he’s ugly. He stole all the stars to embellish his feathers. He told the others to keep quiet, if they wanted to know the secret,’ the fox said. The Carajá was furious, and went searching for the King Vulture, finding him with a startling clutch.” Harry’s hand rested on Draco’s waist, fingers softly stroking his skin. “‘The stars were made to garnish the night, and not to feed your vanity,’ the Carajá said, not interested in knowing the secret of youth. He ripped the King Vulture’s feathers and threw them in the sky. Each of the feathers turned into stars and the sky was filled with brightness again. The King Vulture, seeing that the Carajá was distracted, flew away, now not bright or flaunting anymore, and screamed into the sky. ‘You took away my feathers, but I still know the secret to eternal youth.’
Tainara had, though, refused to reveal how she had made the potion without the last ingredient, Saci’s mushroom; and Rudá—who had pretty much only been slightly chided about the whole thing, but didn't seem to care—was no help regarding the potion his daughter was making. Draco’s relief lay in the fact that Tainara never figured out the last ingredient, though, as his research had proved the mushroom was the component that stripped the victims of their past.
But what else could he do but keep running?
“I’m not. Yes, I was.” He took Draco’s hands and held them for a second, before releasing him and getting to his feet. “Don’t worry, no one got hurt. Let’s go home.”
“You know Guarana is one.”
“As a vessel to that power,” Tainara supplied, arms open and chest on display. She didn’t have to worry about being attacked when Harry was there in all his magnificent power and shadows to protect her. “I knew it’d be Harry. I’ve always known.”
He would have to talk to Harry at some point, but that was the one thing he could and
“Draco…” Francisca warned again, the hand on his arm pressing tighter.
“Wait,” Potter blurted, staring at him appraisingly, eyes lingering on his long hair held back by an elastic band. There wasn’t anything hungry about the look, but it still made Draco’s cheeks burn and his knees falter. “Don’t you have anything else to wear?”
It wouldn’t do him any good to let his guard down now. But the thing was, Draco would take anything those creatures were willing to give him. He still didn’t trust any of them, but it could only help with his research.
hear was the cacophony of the colourful and shiny birds chirping in the sky, the chatter of voices not so far away, and the rustle of the leaves.
“It’s beautiful.” Draco’s eyes perused the celebration, glistening with awe, darting between the fire, the light spheres, and the moon glow. His grin was as wide as it could get. He sipped his drink and almost choked on it. It tasted like dirt, and burned his throat, but there was no alcohol in it, only a strong ripe flavour, slightly acidic and earthy, keeping his senses awake. He downed the rest of it in one go.
good and Harry could vouch for him.
, or the Amazon Pink Dolphin. As Draco had assumed, he was one of the magical creatures that inhabited those lands. Rudá, differently from the others, though, was a shape-shifter; a dolphin during the day that turned into a man at night. Francisca said he was always trying to seduce innocent girls, and this was the main reason he wasn’t allowed at the school without proper company, but Draco could have guessed that one after their brief encounter.
And it was.
Saci was grim now, bouncing right in front of Draco. His aura was something dark and surreal. Shadows danced over his limbs. Saci secured Draco with firm hands, trying to keep him standing. “Put that thing away.”
” a short boy with deep brown skin and a shaved head bellowed, approaching them. “
. It was, in fact,
for half of his life! He was a—Oh no…”
A hand grabbed his forearm, pulling him back and back from Harry and his pain. Draco couldn’t tear his eyes from his lover, though, even when his feet took him away from there.
Trust Harry Potter to believe such a thing, after everything he had done.
, touch and love. So much love, it almost smothered him.
Not that he’d comprehend them, anyway, so it was understandable that they didn’t really care about him.
He lets his eyes trail back up to Harry’s, wanting to see the proof of just how this affects him on his face, and he finds that Harry’s already looking at him. They meet each other’s eyes and Harry grins and leans in to kiss him, hot and open mouthed, as he speeds up his hand.
“Yeah?”
“Nah. Never do.” Since Teddy’s first year, Harry has made a habit of signing on to stay in the castle over Christmas. The students that stay need some supervision, and there's little that Harry has ever loved more than Christmas at Hogwarts - particularly compared to returning to Grimmauld. “I’ve taken to hosting the Christmas feast for all the students that stay. Lot of them don’t have great homes to go to, better they can celebrate here, where they feel wanted.” Harry knows a little too intimately how that feels, the least he can do is help offer his students something that meant so much to him when he was in their place.
“Oi, it’s not like I don’t feel bad about it!”
Harry acknowledges that he brings the onslaught of marking upon himself.
He strolls along the street as the sun sets, a riot of colour in a now clear sky. There’s a bonfire on the wizarding beach closest to campus, a welcome from the University for the newest students.
“Of course he went to my lover’s father, demanded a payout to keep quiet. When he got that money, he turned his sights on me. For years, I worked myself to the bone for him, and he took almost everything I earned in town. In fact, I’m still paying him.”
Harry glanced at him. “I wanted you.”
“Yes,” Harry said with as much dignity as possible.
Draco hitched a bony shoulder. “It doesn’t matter.”
Harry thought.
Potter made wordless noise as he came, his hips jerking against Draco’s face. Draco wished he could watch him come but he was too busy swallowing everything Potte gave him.
“Get out!” Harry’s voice was even higher, even more urgent. He felt a sob brewing in his chest; he felt himself seconds away from falling apart. He refused to let the duke see it. “GET OUT!”
“Your Grace,” he said, out of breath. He dropped his head forward. “Lovely day we’re having.”
“What?” Draco put a hand to his chest, trying to contain himself. “I thought the explosion was an accident.”
Then Draco heard of the National Society of Women’s Suffrage’s decision to hold a protest in Parliament Square, and his stomach lurched. Protests could be dangerous and violent, especially when police were involved.
Harry laughed again. “Did you really tell the whole Tory party to go fuck themselves today?”
“Um,” Harry said.
“No healers!”
So Harry and the other suffragists stalked the halls of Parliament, dropping in on unexpected members. They were equipped with scripts and statistics. They had enough leaflets to fill an entire carriage.
“I want you to leave, Potter,” he said, voice trembling. “I want you to leave and never come back.”
when you are away, understand?”
“How would you dress it?”
“No,” he said gruffly.
“Goyle,” Draco said stiffly. “Draw up a list of people needed to put together a New Year’s Eve party. Expenses are of no consequence. Make sure there are fireworks.”
They reappeared in Grimmauld Place’s cold parlour. The squeeze of Apparition woke Malfoy up. He groaned in Harry’s arms.
Next to him, Parkinson smirked like a cat a second away from a deadly pounce. Harry tried to keep his gaze down, not make eye contact with anyone, but as if summoned, the duke looked right at Harry. Harry didn’t smile. He couldn’t.
“Pardon?”
“Malfoy.” Trembling, Potter clutched him closer, their chests pressed together.
Why had he done something so stupid? They could have been found out … he could have ruined both of their lives in one fell swoop. It was terrifying.
“None of us want to
They were both still breathing heavily.
Then he kissed Potter. Potter’s taste was magnificent, his lips pillowy, soft. Potter made a choked, needy noise, and his lips fell open.
“Too good?”
“I couldn’t pass over until I knew you were safe.”
“Good night,” he whispered.
“Because you are a duke and I am …”
“Ask them if they would be willing to assist in our search. Of course, I will pay them well.”
Draco groaned and covered his face for a moment. Right. The election. He had a stack of post about it waiting for him. He didn’t want to think about the damn election! And then there was the damn New Years’ Eve party and the prospect of a wife being thrust upon him …
The bits and pieces of information he had gathered didn’t really make sense in the whole. Guaraci, the sun, didn’t like him, he assumed, as his flame decided Draco wasn’t worthy of being there. But he also depended on the creatures from the forest to accept him or not, and Caipora had said he would be tainted by something dark. What
“You could say that.” If by ‘not very common’ he meant only the most powerful wizards—and Harry sodding Potter, obviously—learned how to do it. Were they all prodigies here? Draco felt suddenly dizzy.
was here?” Draco spat, leaning forward. He wondered if he shoved his hands in the fire if his fingers could grab Longbottom’s neck.
It was not all that bad. This way, he didn’t really have to think about leaving Harry—Draco still refused to think about Harry’s proposition to stay—and the patients in London were stable and recovering slowly, albeit still amnesiac. But on the other hand, Draco felt like he was stuck in the middle of something important, and his life could not go forward until he dealt with that question. Even if it meant being away from Harry.
Francisca choked on a breath and fell to her knees, still barely holding the shield by herself.
absolutely fine with that.
“Who is ‘they’? Is it the ‘school can sense you’ thing?”
It seemed like a valid point, if he considered the bonding part of the ritual. Still, she wore a uniform like the others, and she was
The students noticed Potter and did a double take.
Potter didn’t finish, and that time Draco wanted him to do so. What was it about using animals to channel magic?
“I wouldn’t usually agree to something like this—” Francisca, still on a roll, barely noticed when her partner left them for his own classes. Hers wouldn’t begin until later, and so she was free to arrange a meeting for Draco with this Caipora. She also seemed very content with finding someone to listen to her incessant chatter—not that Draco was all that focused. Francisca raised an eyebrow at him, containing a smirk. “Seeing as they are not as friendly as we’d like. But since you don’t have many options…”
“Going to the forest. But don’t go alone; it’s very dangerous. Harry knows her, they always like Harry.”
“Fuck if I know what you’re talking about.”
, he preened.
“You’re dying to tell him what I’m doing, huh?” He caught himself saying while closing the door to yet another guest room, eyes on the boa by his feet. Potter had a lot of friends if he needed so many beds, but Draco couldn’t remember a single one of them mentioning visiting Potter. That either meant Potter had been isolated here all these years, or they had decided not to tell Draco—whether Potter had asked them not to was another question altogether.
Well, that was just great. Still.
The safety of the ritual was not the entirety of Draco’s concerns, though. It was hard to think that a fire like that—alive, breathing—could be dangerous. It was pure light. The problem was… Draco was not pure.
Draco just had to survive living with Harry Potter for a while. Until he found out how to seduce the school, while still moving forward with his research and trying not to melt under the Brazilian weather. Feasible.
“Yeah, I know.”
Curupira didn’t pay him any mind and turned to Francisca. “Tell usss you brought City Boy for forest to eat—” The syllables dragged, ending in a not quite melody of sinister background.
Draco would not excuse himself for that. Even if it meant acknowledging that he had to pick his jaw from the floor
running from anything, it’d be from being on the receiving end of looks filled with contempt that followed him at every corner since the break up—not as many as he’d have hoped for, though. His popularity wasn’t very high right now (as if it had ever been). But he definitely didn’t need healing. And he didn’t need anyone by his side. Draco was perfectly fine on his own. He’d always been.
With a sudden clarity, Draco knew what was so different about Potter.
Saci narrowed his eyes, tipping his head to the side. “Ye don’t look sorry. Why are ye smiling?”
The conversation offered him a respite from his own thoughts as it veered into charted territory. Draco’s head perked up when Potter’s unmistakable accent echoed in the field.
, was the first thing that crossed Draco’s mind.
“You cannot be serious,” he gasped, eyes wide and unbelieving. “You’ve seen how I was after that. It certainly felt like a drug. And it wasn’t you vomiting your guts out, so I say I was drugged and someone gave it to me on purpose!”
Hello, Harry!
iss here, and
The Headteacher had been very clear about her tolerance to Draco in that place. And he could not expect another chance, not after this. Harry had tried to help him, and Francisca, José, Tainara. And then there were the creatures in the forest. Apart from Rudá, who had done nothing but get Draco in trouble, all of them were warming up to him. He was even starting to consider Saci as a friend—or something close. And Saci had repeated time after time, “Don’t open the seed.”
“Wait.
The couple looked at each other, but remained silent, and so Draco went on, trying to shake off the feeling of inadequacy that had taken over him. “You know, Machado was the true hero of the night.” He grinned, ruffling the bird’s feathers, his claws perched on Draco’s shoulder. Machado made a low humming sound, raking his head against Draco’s chin.
Saci pressed his fingers on Draco’s shoulder. “Now!”
A grin spread on Draco’s face, and even through pain, he said, “I’m perfectly fine.”
“Saci,” Draco offered promptly and rolled his eyes. “It looks ridiculous, doesn’t it? I have Fast Growing Potion at home, but I think I can brew some here if—”
“I know, we just…” Potter started and seemed at a loss for words for the first time since Draco had got here. Evidently, he felt as uncomfortable near the professor as Draco felt displaced in the school.
wants me gone. I’ll bet you Saci can’t even look me in the eye right now.” And he wasn’t annoyed about the latter. He was definitely not. He didn’t care about Saci.
His legs though, were about to give away beneath him. So when Harry—bright and warm in the sunlight—caught him in his arms, Draco gladly let his own weight lean on Harry.
Caipora stuck the tobacco between her lips, and Draco barely registered when the tip began to burn. “I’m not surre yet if I believe that, but I don’t agree with Currupira,” she started, voice muffled by the pipe stuck between her lips. “I don’t think you’rrre totally Darrrk Boy, but darrrk will taint you.”
Potter all but spluttered, trying to conceal laughter Draco had already caught. “That’s rude, Jade,” he admonished, though he didn’t sound all that bothered by whatever the girl had said.
“Harry,” he whispered.
“Are you okay?” he asked, turning on the couch to face Draco. “Everyone’s okay, you know. And it happens sometimes.
It made no noise. Just silently cracked in the middle section, two neat halves falling on the ground.
“Right, obviously.”
“Yes, I get it,” Draco said instead. “I need new clothes.” He did
.” Francisca kissed Zé and waved at Harry before turning to Draco again. “It was nice meeting you, Draco. Don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything.”
His low, modulated tone sometimes reminded Draco of Lovegood. José was a much bigger man, of course, but his features were always soft and detached. Harry had said Luna and Ginevra had visited him once, and it didn’t surprise Draco to learn Luna and José were seen together a lot, and that the Weasley girl and Francisca had got along pretty well.
“Can I—Can I fight it?”
“You think I’m evil. That’s why, isn’t it?” He was already shaking his head. “I’m not! What else do I need to do to prove it to you?”
“I know,” she hissed through gritted teeth, beastly eyes boring into his. Caipora crossed her arms, promptly analysing her nails—though they looked more like filthy, tattered claws. Her accent was a strange thing, dragged, but rough and forceful. She didn’t look like someone to take lightly. “And I don’t know yet if I want to hearr’u orr not.”
in an indigenous language, I’m not sure which. There are a lot. Maybe Tupi.” He shrugged sheepishly.
So far, he had heard about the Caipora, protector of the woods; Guaraci, the sun; and Tupã, God, and wasn’t really sure about the true existence of any of them. It was impossible to deny his curiosity about the Brazilian culture, about their beliefs. It’d been a long time since Draco had been so engrossed in anything that wasn’t potions or marriage decorations. He was sure he’d spend all of his free time in Homunin at the library, deep in readings about indigenous culture, once the school finally accepted him.

It granted him another lively laugh from Harry, and Draco absolutely did
won them over—have you seen the woman?—and she didn’t stay long, so it wore off real fast.”
Draco yelled, too far gone by anger to be afraid of their retaliation, “Merlin’s balls! Harry Potter was bloody touched by the ultimate darkness and you didn’t even consider him before?!”
But this—here, now—was a different kind of hurt. Because Harry had deliberately chosen his words to slice, even if he didn’t mean them. He had used them to purposefully hurt Draco, and he did.
He gasped, “I need to leave.”
“I do wish.” Draco gave Saci his best smile, against all reason telling him he was stepping on dangerously thin ice in trying to control that boy. “And to my knowledge, you have to obey me. Please, tell me more about the coconut.”
Draco sighed, touching his forehead to Harry’s. “I still wish I had got the chance to decide that for myself.” Even if he knew he probably wouldn’t have come, indeed. Draco’s arms went around Harry’s waist, their bodies fitting against each other. “I’m not mad, you know.” He wasn’t, not truly, not for what mattered. He couldn’t even allow sadness to settle inside him over the fact that Harry didn’t trust him enough at the time. Draco didn’t trust himself. Or Harry, Narcissa, Pansy. Anyone. They were both so broken from the war and its scars, it would never have worked. Harry didn’t let Draco in his life, but neither had Draco.
He said, “I’m going to fix it.”
“Like what?”
Oh yes, Malfoys first learn to control their tempers when they are born, and only then to learn to speak and walk. So, when Draco spent his first year of life crying his lungs out at every hour of the day, his parents knew that this one would be difficult. They were right. Draco grew up to be a spoiled child, an entitled teenager and, finally, a very difficult adult.
When he spotted it, it was nothing more than a blur. Surrounded by green and brown, the yellow bright thing stood out, catching his eyes almost instantly. “Wait, stop!”
, he heard again. Draco hadn’t known what it meant when he’d heard it before, and he didn’t know now, leaning against a tree inside the forest, alone, panting and spewing his guts out. Somehow, it made sense.
“And then—”
The fact that he had once actively wished for this was now preposterous.
He raised an eyebrow, lips curling unhappily. “Okay, I’ll pretend you spoke English just now.” Or that they hadn’t forgotten that Draco was there at all, which didn’t irk him in the least. Nope. It was not like he was some attention craver.
The air was cool, dampness sticking to his skin, his hair whipping wildly around his face. The wind carried the scent of trees, dew, greenery, Potter,
good.
“How could you leave me like that?”
“No, it’s not! What have you done?” There was no need to scream. Not in the unearthly silence of Homunin. Still, Draco did so. His lungs hurt, his head throbbed. His eyes were wet, torn between staring at her and making sure, every second, that Harry was still there.
There was no surprise when the, “You’ve zone enough,” came out of her thin lips, more like a growl than resembling words, as she pushed him away.
Harry remained silent for a few moments, staring at him with burning eyes. The music ended, and they were blanketed by a quietness that was not replaced by any other song.
“What? Are you afraid of her?”
who was insistent on testing every limit Draco had.
Francisca straightened, rubbing the back of her hand on her face to dry the tears from her laughter. “Yes, we—”
Draco had never shown his scars to Potter, not even when they were together. He always kept the shirt on, or used charms to hide them. It didn’t matter anymore. The only thing Draco felt when he stared at the marred tissue of his torso was grief for what he had lost that year. Himself.
tasted bitter on his tongue. It felt so wrong to call him that, but he didn’t correct himself. Even if calling him Potter felt off now, it was what the wizard deserved, and the only recognition he would receive.
nightmares?!”
Draco rolled his eyes, but his tone was bordering on hysterical. “You don’t say. This school is bloody attacking me now!”
The problem wasn’t the house.
And then, the surrounding forest changed in a second.
Curupira left so quickly, Draco’s mind almost didn’t process his absence. The fire of the challenge burned in his body, prompting Draco to action when he wasn’t really sure he should take any. He was already on his heels, startled into following the boy’s footsteps, as Francisca’s screams faded in the distance.
One more nickname to add to the list, he thought.
“I wouldn’t—” he started again, but was soon interrupted by a group of students crossing their way.
They didn’t actually go back home after the Dark Greenhouse fiasco.
But he didn’t meet any of them. Instead, Draco faced Saci once more after only a few minutes of walking into the woods near Harry’s house.
It was also important to be as far away from Martin, and mother, and Pansy, and every other person who still despised him. Draco didn’t mention that detail.
“But Professor Harry already was a bit like us when he got here,” the girl from before added, ignoring Potter completely. The others nodded agreeably.
, Draco pleaded in his mind. It didn’t matter that it was just a boy, and it was just one. Draco was
, he pleaded in silence.
The Headteacher didn’t seem as relieved about it as Potter, but she said nothing else before nodding and leaving them to it.
Harry—fuck it, Potter—ignored him. Instead, he offered his arm to Draco. Some of his tattoos stretched in waves of dark ink to knuckles covered in scratches and half-arsed bandages.
At Potter’s words, the animal turned its head to him, swaying quietly. Despite the deep underlying orange of the reptile’s scales, it shimmered in greens, blues, reds, and yellows under the light that came from the open door. The colours dispersed like a rainbow at the strike of light, displaying a jewel-like glow. Black stripes drew round shapes on the body, enclosing smaller circles on the sides. Dazzling as it was, Draco couldn’t appreciate its beauty when it tried to smother him like that. When Potter stopped hissing, the snake slid off Draco’s torso, out of his bed, and slithered its way between Potter’s legs before disappearing outside.
Draco hummed in acknowledgment. It made sense, from what he had known about Potter. Draco had learned Potter didn’t quite thrive on attention, as he had so heartily believed throughout school.
The woman, however, was the sole clue Draco had of how to fix things. The tucumã was a seed, and there was no one else there who would know more about it than her, as she was not only an Herbology teacher and Potions master, but a legendary creature of the forest.
when it was aired, and Nazare—the villain—such an amazing character that she became a wide known meme you've probably seen around:
Caipora’s fingers crushed his arm, her claws thrusting into his skin, as if she was hearing his doubtful thoughts. Draco bit back a whimper, looking down at the mauled skin. There was no visible wound or blood, but he couldn’t tear his eyes from the deadly grip.
It was just
Potter had, with a flick of his hand—hand, not a wand in sight, Draco noticed belatedly—tilted the garage door up across the ceiling, revealing their means of transportation.
A few days during which Draco would have to deal with copious views of that crooked grin, bright green eyes, unreasonable tanned muscles and to hear that fucking nauseating,
Saci’s hand was back on him, grabbing his wrist. “Nightmares.”
Tainara grinned, as if she could read the realisation dawning in Draco’s face.
Without a clue how to get Lua to at least talk to him, Draco approached her in a fit of bravery and stupidity, much to his dismay—it had to be Potter’s Gryffindor-ish influences on him.
Even if Draco was a fool for it.
Draco had only got out of the forest safely—though ‘safely’ was used loosely—because of his bird friend. Machado guided him through the woods, avoiding whatever invisible path could lead him to Caipora or Curupira. Or
Half of the brooms had been abandoned on the grass; the other half simply floated around, following their owners as the kids assembled around Potter and Draco.
happening between them. And it took only a few minutes of prying for Draco to spill the whole truth to her. How the school had rejected him. How he had made no progress in his research because he was trying to win over every magical creature that lived in that place. How they kept toying with him and playing with his life. How he had messed everything up by opening something he didn’t fully understand and how it was so hot he couldn’t think properly half of the time. And, finally, how he ended up locking himself up at the house to stay inside the cooling charms, but in reality he was just too tired to deal with anything. Draco had no clue of how to begin to fix things. He wanted his home and his bed so badly it hurt. But it hurt even more to realise his home was that cabin in the woods, and his bed was Harry’s bed, with Harry lying by his side.
The animal, a large parrot with red feathers, was already getting up as if nothing had happened. It flew towards them and didn’t seem to notice Draco flinching—that was the same rainbow-winged parrot he had seen with Caipora, he could swear on it—before landing on his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
And that brought the third thing one should know about Draco Malfoy. Despite his usual inability to control his temper, he was an excellent liar. He wouldn’t have survived the war if he wasn’t.
That was not Caipora, Draco realised soon enough, recalling Tainara’s recounts of a small, red-furred girl. The creature in front of them was a boy, his skin a tawny brown, stained with mud and dirt, the almost naked body covered with few leaves. His eyes were a bright amber, and he had nothing but fire for hair, his slithering flames illuminating that small parcel of the woods. The boy bowed so deep his nose almost touched the ground, his flamed hair lingering on a few leaves by his feet. He said, slowly, “It isss I, Curupira.”
Draco’s eyes were fixed on the blurred forest they rapidly crossed, as he considered releasing his white-knuckled grip of the car to gather his jaw from the floor. It was probably best to keep securing himself, though, with the way Potter drove like there was no tomorrow.
, she’d said. Draco forcibly and
“But you said they were already recovering.”
So he left. Out of necessity. Necessity for being alone, and for doing his job, really.
Now what?!
“Then
Draco laughed, shaking his head, which ended up dislodging his stalker. The bird squawked loudly and bit Draco again. With force this time.
That's just how it is.
Harry raised his head, grin as bright as the sun blinding Draco’s view, and he said, “For a very long time it is, then.”
originally came from Portugal (Coca) and was brought to Brazil during colonial times and became popular and well known throughout the years here. There are several legends about her, and many of them differ in one point or another (in some she only sleeps once every seven years, in others she has the face of a crocodile, and some say she can morph into different animals). One thing that all of the tales about Cuca have in common is that she’s said to be an old woman who robs disobedient children.
They didn’t share more than pleasantries during those days, and neither Harry nor Draco tried any kind of conversation anymore.
“It’s Tupi-Guarani, the language, and it comes from a legend from the Carajá tribe,” she said, and it didn’t seem like she minded whether Draco was listening. He tried to stay awake, though, because he found everything about Brazilian folklore too fascinating not to pay attention. “Tainá-Can was a star that shone bright in the sky. An indigenous girl, Imaeró, fell in love and asked him to come to land to marry her. Tainá-Can came one night to marry her, but he, who was so bright in the sky, looked like an old man up close on earth. She refused to marry the elder, but her sister, Denakê, took pity on Tainá-Can and offered to marry him instead. Tainá-Can promised to feed and care for her, for she had a good heart, and he went to the woods to start preparing to plant seeds, asking that she didn’t follow him.
She raised an eyebrow, composing herself in her usual pristine stance. “You might have read about me in one of your researches with the girl. Some call me Iara, others call me
Draco
Potter went oddly quiet, his hands suddenly frozen on Draco’s face. “I…”
“I’m so sorry, Draco. I can usually keep them under control, it’s just…” Potter hesitated, his eyes worried, searching. “It won’t happen again.” With a snap of his fingers, the lights were on.
“Fuck! Draco, what—” Harry tried to keep him at arm's length, but Draco kept pulling closer, leaning against the strong, warm chest. Machado had traded Draco’s shoulder for a branch on a tree nearby, and Draco tried not to think too much about how he
Spells were still thrown in an attempt to contain the flames, but it didn’t take more than an hour to get everything under control. The trees were still charred, and the persistent odour of burned wildlife blended with the damp air. But there would be no more harm today.
The first thing one must learn about Draco Malfoy was that he lacked patience, which was contradictory to his upbringing.
Draco agreed with that. They couldn’t. No one could.
He was getting used to this routine. He would drive to the school with Harry in the morning and then he would just roam around Homunin listlessly. Draco would usually meet Saci or Tainara right away, read some books, and then look for Harry again when he knew the classes were over—he had memorised Harry’s entire schedule by now.
“The school. Win it over.”
Draco snorted. He could imagine, yes. “Do you really know everything that’s happening on the grounds?”
He felt safe around the macaw and he knew Machado understood him enough to take him out of there unharmed. And, somehow, he understood Machado just as well, enough to know he was glad that Draco was fine.
“Yeh, yeh.
“Ye look terrible,
—often?”
Additionally, Brazil was only halfway to the other side of the world. There really was no reason for the exaggeration.
, Draco admonished.
But Draco couldn’t really be mad at Potter’s excitement. After all, Draco was, truly, great company, and Potter should feel honoured that Draco even considered talking to him again after everything.
special to me,” Harry said, and the grin he gave Draco left behind all the doubts and hurt. “I shouldn’t have left you, I should have carried you away with me.”
Draco could do exactly that. Last a day in the forest. He’d still see about the rest later, although the trip was already proving itself quite challenging so far.
After he and Harry had… worked out the unresolved tension between them, to put it blandly, Draco barely left the house for days, fully intent on enjoying Harry’s company for as long as he could persuade Harry to stay at home.
Draco glanced back at Rudá. But the man had completely vanished. So had the animals playing with him before, despite the abandoned cards flying menacingly in the vortex. He and his bird-friend had been completely abandoned—if the tornado wasn’t Rudá’s doing, that was.
Draco scowled at him, raising an eyebrow while climbing into the car with the utmost care so as not to wrinkle his robes. This entire trip didn’t seem as appealing to him anymore.
. It’s not
A strong tornado made every leaf fly. The crown of the trees swayed dangerously to the sides as Draco’s hair whipped around his face. The whirlwind closed around him, the razor-sharp wind stinging his skin. Using his forearm to cover his face, Draco took a step back. No matter how much he tried to back away, the tornado just seemed to get closer. The parrot on his shoulder squawked and tried to fly away, but a gush of wind threw him right back into Draco’s arms.
Tainara helped him keep guard when she wasn’t learning from Harry—Harry, who was behaving like nothing had happened, but wouldn’t talk to Draco. They both took turns in watching the place, until finally Lua came out the door and Draco was the one standing there, waiting for her.
Draco drew in a deep breath and closed his eyes.
He didn’t want to give Harry up.
“It’s a
Having Saci’s allegiance again was brilliant, but it didn’t really help in the bigger picture. Saci had no idea how to help Draco—or the inclination to do so—and was deemed useless. Saci kept Draco company, however, whenever Tainara and the professors who didn’t hate him were too busy, or when he was trying to run away from Harry. None of them was much help, really, but it was better than staying alone.
Harry said, “You were engaged.”
They hadn’t needed words in the past, and they wouldn’t need them now. Words were unimportant, as they barely translated what was happening between them. They did not do justice for it, for what could never be understood by the spoken language.
“Zon’t talk to me, Zark Boy.” She raised a hand. Her voice was low, controlled. It sounded like it was inside his own head, fracturing his skull into dark, smaller pieces. It couldn’t be.
“And his partner and Local Creature Care professor, Francisca.”
coming home with me again or I’ll let Nazaré eat you this time.” He knew, even before the bird tipped his head sideways, staring at him with those round golden eyes, that the stalker would come home—he deliberately did not think about how easy it was to call Harry’s house his home now—with him again, whether or not Draco wanted it. And honestly, he didn’t have it in him to feed the parrot to Nazaré. Not truly.
“I hearr you’rre looking for this. It is not magical,” she clarified with a sly grin. Hope didn’t even have time to lodge inside Draco as he caught sight of the fruit in his fingers. “Not until you prrrove yourr value.”
“Yeah. Finish your research and stay here. With me.”
He stalked Potter closely, watching the man gather an assortment of titles he wouldn’t understand, and trusting—or trying to—that Potter was looking for the right things.
He was in hell.
But the bird didn’t seem as interested in Draco as usual. He nibbled Draco’s tied hair for a bit before flying away, leaving them to their lazy conversation again.
The literal translation is "lie", however, in this context, it can be read as "No way!"
“Not this time, no, Curupira,” she laughed, and Draco could swear it sounded hysterical. Her shoulders were tense, eyes fixed upon the disturbing creature in front of them. “Draco needs to talk to Caipora. We want to know why he’s not in the network.”
By episode ten, they dropped the translation spells because the acting was just so good Draco couldn’t miss a thing, even if it meant Potter had to explain what was happening at every scene. Potter didn’t seem to mind it that much, chuckling amusedly at each of Draco’s stupid questions—

“You can underrrstand me, boy, because I speak everrry language you speak.”
“Ye don’t want anyone knowing,” Saci said one of those days, near the edge of the forest, not too close to the school that he’d be worried about getting caught. Draco, resting against a tree trunk, rolled his eyes and the seed of tucumã between his fingers. Saci went on, “Ye know it’s wrong.”
The sight almost threw him off track. It had been her all along. The girl he had considered a friend.
Maybe he should just go back to Martin, get married and be over with useless
Draco took his appearance in one gulp. “I was fucking here all the time, Potter, where were

Apparently not.
“What?” both women asked at the same time.
The literal translation for this would be: like the devil fleeing from the cross
“I don’t know, Harry. Perhaps… Perhaps I was tired of waiting? I had to do something. Even if”—Draco exhaled sharply, pressing a palm to his temple,—“alright, look. All I know—or what I’m assuming, because, really, this is insane—is a psycho gave me a fucking coconut and now the night’s gone. It’s still gone, right?” He raised his head to see Harry nodding. “I swear to Merlin, if they’re not trying to kill me, they’re not doing a good job convincing me otherwise.”
It made sense when reflecting about it. According to Saci’s legend, the night had already been freed, so it was not like it could do any actual damage concerning the tale now—that is, if Draco believed the thing was really something from a myth and not just a strange plant.

He and Tainara had been reading comfortably for a couple of hours when Francisca and José crossed their way, a sly grin plastered on their lips.
, go check her work.
The strange man lifted his head, and Draco finally saw his eyes. They were bright, a colour that resembled rose gold shining in the dark. His features were gorgeous, albeit cold and menacing, plump flushed lips slanted in a wide smile that got Draco shivering. “What a wondrous sight!”
Draco hurried to grab his wand, hands shaking so much he wondered if he could even wield it, but a hand on his forearm pinned him to the place.
Homunin held many wonders, surely, but Draco was still sore from the day before, and another warm bath wouldn’t do any harm to his aching muscles.
Saci pulled away, bouncing on his one leg, and shook his head. “No time,
Draco sighed, resting his head against wood. “Not entirely. They can’t remember who they were before they were administered the potion and the obeying urges don’t vanish completely.” The other effects of the Moriaetem Potion had been treated using advanced counter-potions to Amortentia and Calming Draught, but the most important ones, the ones Draco couldn’t figure out, still affected those people on some level.
Draco shrugged. “Did you know your little pupil can do whatever she wants around the school?” He raised the corner of his lips, but Potter didn’t seem surprised by it. Tainara probably had him wrapped around her finger as well. “She even got those books to open.”
Draco rolled his eyes at the couple. “As delightful as it seems, I don’t intend on mating with an animal.”
Instead of smashing something at that moment, though, he took a deep breath. Draco tried imagining his happy place now, as his mind wandered off to his Breaking Room—it had been the smallest room in his old flat, completely devoid of furniture, the sole purpose of it being to mollify Draco's destructive behaviour. Compact as their flat was, this was something Draco wouldn’t give up. He had made it clear to Martin when they had moved in together. Martin had been so eager to please a short-tempered Draco that it had not been a problem.
Potter guided him through a spacious kitchen, a living room that would make his and Martin’s small flat envious, and at least four bedrooms, all while ignoring two closed doors. The place was beautiful, garnished in warm colours and simplistic fixtures. Some obvious attempts at decoration had been made, however unlikely it was that Potter had accomplished that rustic and comfortable composition on his own.
Draco shivered, fingers closing tighter around Harry’s forearm, but neither of them dared to say a word.
Fingers closed around his forearm, bringing it up. Harry’s lips were on his faded mark, making the scar from his tainted past disappear behind his kiss and the hope of something Draco hadn’t allowed himself to feel for years to surface.
Draco’s face furrowed in rage. He yanked his arm free and stepped forward, the menacing energy still preventing him from reaching too close.
“He took too long, and Denakê, worried, followed him. But she did not find elder, but young and strong Carajá warrior. She took him home. Imaeró got jealous and said she had seen Tainá-Can first. Tainá-Can said: ‘You could not see beyond what your eyes saw. You didn’t love me, you loved my light. Your sister loved me, even when I looked old, and Denakê will be my wife.’
Draco wanted to ask what exactly Harry was trying to say when he closed his arms around Draco’s waist, but he remained silent, lips resting against Harry’s.
Draco gulped. He had forgotten it… That he had lied about Martin to Potter. Why had he lied, though? It didn’t seem to make sense now, staring into Harry’s verdant eyes. “I’m not engaged, Harry,” the truth tumbled out of his lips. “I lied. I… The wedding was cancelled before I came to Brazil.”
It was not as smooth—if a sting can be called that—as it had been when stinging him with the book. Once Draco approached the mahogany doors to the greenhouse, an oppressing bundle of energy threw him to the opposite wall. If it was not for Potter serving as a human protection, standing right in the line of Draco’s trajectory, he could have been seriously injured. Suffice to say, his ego had seen better days, too.
“Oi, Harry! You leaving?” she asked.
“Nazaré. You can call her Naza. She’s a rainbow boa.”
“This giant parrot tried to kill me, Potter!”
that had been squandered into the walls of the castle, surrounded by the rainforest.
Rudá would pull something like that. What he was planning. But he left the conjectures for later. He had first to bring the night back, then track Rudá in his human form.
He could find another way to finish his research. Draco was resourceful, he’d work it out. And just as he had got used to Brazil in the last few months, he would get used to London again. Maybe he could even give Martin a second chance.
Draco had seen what Harry could give him, and he wanted to take it all. Damn his heart and what would happen to him at the end of that trip. He needed that.
Headteacher Albuquerque smiled softly at him, as if she understood what Draco was seeing,
“I won’t even deign to give you an answer for that,” he said, composing himself. “I’m sure you missed my voice in the entirety of these seven years, but you won’t have what you want. You don’t deserve it.”
Not only because that was what Malfoys did; they planned ahead and prepared for
“There’s a legend about it, ya know.”
“Where’s Caipora?” Francisca asked, pulling Draco closer.
He only found something—
“Soon, I promise.”
He stumbled, kneeling in front of Harry, hands cupping the face stained with black tears.
The nightmares were gone. Jurupari was sealed. People hugged each other, crying and holding their wounds.
“I’m not Harry,” Tainara said nonchalantly, grabbing Draco’s arm and dragging him all the way back to the library. “
The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas (1881) is a classic book by Brazilian author Machado de Assis and it has such a unique narrative and avant-garde style that it's considered, to this day, a masterpiece.
Draco would not descend to the level of one of the Potterettes. His magic didn’t feel
Draco was
There was no way Draco could get to the school by running. He growled. “Fuck! I don’t have time for this.”
“What is that?” Draco’s voice was barely a whisper, fear of scaring the creature or disturbing its peace preventing him from raising it.
She kept pressing, as though no reaction had been exhibited by them. “Sorry, my English is not so good. Harry is helping me with it. I’m Tainara. You can call me Tai.”
Tainara hummed in agreement. Her body shifted somehow above him, for the noise the leaves made at the movement. “You know,” she started. The tip of a hair strand touched Draco’s face and he opened his eyes to see the girl lying on her stomach, head leaning on her crossed arms on the branch and eyes on him. “I think if you can distract Cuca, I can get in the Dark Greenhouse and get you what you need.”
Draco looked back, at Francisca’s worried lips, at Berenice’s tight and focused expression. It was all falling apart. Again.
Distracted by the unknown words, Draco barely missed the way the fire crackled on the hearth. It was too hot for a fire, especially for them to spontaneously start burning like that. But it was Potter’s house, so he figured normal rules didn’t apply. However, as the flames grew they took on a green hue and Draco suddenly remembered Potter had mentioned the house was connected to the International Floo Network. Draco had made a mental note to call mother and Pansy, but with all that had happened, he didn’t really feel like reliving his failure with them.
And since a relationship was off the table now, there should be no trouble in trusting him. In opening up a bit to him.
If Harry seemed hurt, Draco assessed, it must be only his impression. He couldn’t really waste any time worrying about Harry or his feelings. Draco had better things to do. And it was past the time he’d bend backwards just to get Harry’s attention.
Draco, who always had
it was going to happen. You knew that this evil—whatever it is—was trying to come for me. You just didn’t realise it was not me.” His laughter died in his throat, a wan smile spreading on his lips. “You were willing to let me face it, anyway.”
Draco frowned, trying to suppress his own stubborn grin. “It’s fascinating the amount of bonding you people seem to do around here. Are you sure this is healthy, Potter? You seem a little off. I wouldn’t want the Saviour of Us All to feel discombobulated.”
He turned around to find the Headteacher’s smile facing him. Headteacher Berenice was usually amiable enough to him, but something about the woman always made Draco shiver apprehensively. Something in the way she almost sang the words her lips enunciated.
Lua didn’t answer. She growled, interrupting him. Her face creased into an ugly grimace.
. These are the largest water lilies in the world.” Harry’s hands were under Draco’s shirt in a second, distracting him from the sight. He said, “I’ll tell you a story…” Draco nodded. “The Moon God, Jaci, was strong and bright, and loved to flirt with all the beautiful indigenous girls.” Harry’s calloused fingers slowly stroked the skin of Draco’s back. He pulled the hem of the piece, tugging it up, lips locking on Draco’s throat.
“Probably not.” He creased his features in a scowl. “I missed you.
Harry raised his head and grinned at Draco. His eyes didn’t hold the usual warmth. He asked, “How are you feeling?”
What. The. Fuck.
It seemed it was a general effect, as he watched most of the students slowly parading back to their classes, murmuring low instead of the usual buzz of the day.
“But you haven’t said yes, either.” Shoving his face between both hands, Harry exhaled a sigh. He shook his head so hard that his curls brushed at the tip of his fingers. His words were muffled when he spoke, but Draco heard them clear as the day outside, “Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s for the best that you don’t.”
“It’s not easy zaying no.” Lua stretched her hand and waited.
used to defeat Voldemort if someone were to hear about that. Draco would take that to his grave, naturally. “
a drug, no matter what Potter said—but… Draco had noticed soon after that he could sense Machado wherever the animal was, and he knew for a fact the bird felt him as well.

Now, though, she knew with just a glance what
well aimed, that left him exposed from the inside out, cracking his head into a million pieces. The pain from a sliced chest, while his blood stained the floor of the bathroom. He even knew the pain of a broken heart from back when Harry had left him for the first time.
Caipora repeated, “It was not him.”
there—and still completely dependent on Potter to get anything done—it wouldn’t do any harm to get to know what Potter got off on doing these days. Not to mention that the only Potter-free time Draco had resulted in an ill-fated ramble around the forest, and he wasn’t really eager to repeat the experience.
if he didn’t have to
Their lips crashed like waves on the rocks, encouraged by the storm coming up the horizon. It was slow, intense, tongues remembering the path they still seemed to know in their hearts.
This soap opera was
Draco’d seen tons of vehicles, alright? Hell, he’d been living in Muggle London for the last five years—even if he didn’t leave his flat often. Martin, as a Muggle-born and more than comfortable around things that were ‘not posh enough’ for Draco, was the one who went shopping for them. Draco couldn’t even argue with that assessment. However, most of the cars he’d seen, including Martin’s, had a hardtop. Not a single one of them looked like they were about to fall to pieces. Naturally, he told Potter so.
“This is not Curupira. The fire doesn’t just go out. Never!” Harry was on his feet in a second, dark eyes fixed somewhere above Draco’s shoulder.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment on what he was really thinking. Introducing himself was a better course of action. “Nice to meet you.”
delay for now. Draco would fix everything and prove to Harry that he was…
His body didn’t ache so much, but frustration and helplessness were enough to have him walking far from his useless notes for the moment. After getting some butter and jam on a piece of toast—Draco wasn’t very adventurous in the kitchen, especially without Potter to cook for him—he settled in at a quiet pace for the rest of the day, braving the parts of the house Potter hadn’t shown him. Nazaré serenely stalked after him as Draco opened door after door, only to find more and more guest rooms.
“Don’t worry, Mr Malfoy. Every student on this property has undertaken the ritual. It’s perfectly safe.” Her voice was deep, hypnotic, and soothing, but it did almost nothing to calm his nerves.
“You’re…” Potter started, trying to reign over the buttons with his trembling digits. “You’re bleeding. Merlin. Draco, you’re—”
Potter waved a dismissive hand, laughing as if the whole matter was a joke. “She can handle it, don’t worry,” he announced, opened the passenger door and added in a failed attempt at nonchalance, “Who
“You don’t have to. I haven’t changed my mind, you know. I’m not going to,” Draco said, mouth coming to rest on Harry’s forehead. “I love you, and I’m staying here.”
It felt
José was obviously careful while driving, and kept a soft pace. But he wasn’t Potter and didn’t have Potter’s damn safe magic and aura. When had Potter turned from someone who made Draco uncomfortable to someone who made him feel safe?
Machado, out of some sense of protection, landed on his shoulder as Lua approached him. Her steps made no sound, and Draco could swear she was floating, if not because he was staring at her feet and they were touching the ground.
Draco stayed quiet, nevertheless, and tried to make out the shapes in the distorted forest.
Brazilian summer starts in December and the beginning of our school year between January and March after our biggest vacation time.
After Harry had left, Draco convinced himself he’d never wanted Harry’s attention. But what a lie it had been. Draco had always been scraping for Harry’s attention in the past, for Harry’s eyes on his, his words, even if they hurt. When Harry had hit him with that curse in the prefect’s bathroom in sixth year, Draco couldn’t have helped the hopefulness sparking inside him. He had got something of Harry, even if it’d only been his anger and the scars it had left Draco with. And then, after the war, when Harry had given him his broken pieces, his kisses and his touch, Draco finally understood how magnificent it was to have something of him that wasn’t hatred.
might be.
“Well, it was supposed to go inside your chest,” Potter unhelpfully pointed out.
Black eyes stared at Draco, and he gulped. “What…?”
A girl with skin like autumn leaves, fine eyes, and long, dark, straight hair, eyed Draco with curiosity. “
“A coconut?” she asked, and her curiosity was now focused on Draco. “Who gave you this? And what the fuck happened to your hair?”
Draco can’t help the amused snort, which earns him a sharp glare from Marsh.
“The most primal and primary magical interactions are those that take place within a magic user’s
“Ah yes, the elusive evening plans. Wouldn’t want you to keep your fans waiting, or whatever it is.”
much attention in school, but with the exception of bloody Slughorn’s year, he was quite sure that the Savior hadn’t scored higher than Troll on a single Potions assignment.
Magic and Muggle society coexisting peacefully. Draco’s father would roll over in his grave.

Upon further inspection,
The little laugh he’s rewarded with sends Harry’s spirits higher than any broomstick could.
Harry feels rather see-through. It must show on his face, because Ron laughs.
Scorpius nods at that, and Harry can see that his eyes have dried.
The students have left for winter hols now, and the hospital wing, like much of the castle, is quiet and empty.
Professor Marsh, as she introduces herself, wastes no time in beginning their course as she launches into their first lecture on complex magical interactions in rapid Spanish.
Harry looks at him for a moment, “I finish class at 1 on Thursday.”
he’s interested in that. He’s not saying he
Draco snorts again, “I don’t speak a word of Spanish,” he states, feeling the amusement stretch his features, “well, that’s not strictly true, I know a few phrases.”
Harry nods thoughtfully, “Though that doesn’t really explain why you feel it so strongly,” he glances back at the book page, “There’s only the two of you left.”
He isn’t talking to Draco so much as himself, and Draco feels like an intruder as Potter’s eyes follow the duelling ribbons of colour in his core. He thinks to take a few notes for their project, but quickly finds that he doesn’t know what to say. Potter’s core is neutral, shockingly enough, but the chaos of alternating colours, vines growing together, trying to strangle one another all the while, it’s jarring.
“When I learned that Scor was sorted to Gryffindor I told him to embrace it.” The words shock Harry for more than just the sudden break they cause in the silence. Malfoy’s gaze shifts back to his son, fingers tenderly pushing hair away from his face, fierce but gentle love in each gesture. Harry could convince himself that he imagined him speaking, until he does again. “Had I connected that you were his head of house, I might have been more reserved in doing so.”
Dean is a hit with the students. Since calling Harry in to help adjust the elevated podium in his classroom, the new Charms teacher has hit his stride and proven in a few short weeks to be an effective teacher. Much like his predecessor, Dean is a gifted dueller, and his proficiency in Charms comes as no surprise to Harry, who taught Dean to cast a patronus when they were only 15.
“The what?!” Potter looks 20% eager and 80% annoyed. Draco laughs and it’s only 20% mocking...okay, 30%.
“So much light?” The question isn’t really a question. It’s a refrain, one that makes Draco think that somehow Potter
Monday brings the most interesting lesson they’ve had in Marsh’s class. She shows them - with herself as the example - how to create a projection of a magical core, and spends the rest of the class teaching them to dissect the different colours, their placement and what they mean. They’re surprised - or Draco is, at least - to see the vast section of deep blue pooled at the base of her core, indicating her extensive practice in alchemy, borderline dark magic. The rest of it is essentially light and neutral, silvery-white dotted with gold, red, green.
Of course, if he can mimic Potter, Potter can mimic him, and he only just makes it out of the building before he’s being pulled gently off the sidewalk and he spins around to find Potter’s face looking wounded.
And then it’s over and Harry is smiling sheepishly at him, “I’ve really got to go, I have another class.”
I can’t have our boys be unhappy for too long. Stay tuned for another chapter and an epilogue full of fluff.
A soft chime rings out from the clock on the wall and Potter jumps, eyes widening frantically as he realizes that it’s just turned six in the evening. “I have to go,” he gasps, stepping away and breaking the strange spell they’d both fallen under. “Fuck, I’m late. I’m sorry, we’ll finish…” he gestures to the notes and essays spread across Draco’s table, “later.”
Harry’s cock is dark and thick and achingly hard and every little slide of flesh draws a tiny sigh from Harry’s lips. With a quick wandless charm, Draco conjures up a spot of lube and drags it over the length of Harry’s cock. The answering moan is nearly enough to send Draco over the edge, and his own hips buck against Harry’s thigh, seemingly prompting him to follow suit, because a moment later he has Draco’s cock in hand and is setting a torturously slow pace that Draco can’t help but follow.
Advanced Magical Interactions comes around again on Monday, and it begins much like the first time. The seat beside Potter is empty, and Draco takes it.
. Light magic freckled across his core, from top to bottom, though more towards the top, a nod to his fresh start, he’d like to think. The top of the core is like short term memory, recent occurrences that have potential to either flicker out or grow roots and mingle with the base of one’s core.
Harry gasps softly, his eyes going a little distant, ”I think I might have an idea,” He strides over to a bookshelf on the wall and pulls out an old-looking tome, “I found this after we saw our cores...I wanted to know more about that magic, not just love but, you know, family.”
Harry has a way of making him feel like the world isn’t quite as finished with him as Draco would like to think.
have a job.”
Mid-December finds Harry in his office more often than not. It’s one of the rare times that the assignments he’s set for his assorted classes pile up and overwhelm him - every year it happens, and every year he keeps his schedule the same.
essays for this project, I don’t know if we’re done here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A beat passes, then two, a leaky sink drips in the quiet, and Harry turns his body to face Scorpius, legs crossed on the cold stone floor. “What makes you say that?”
It feels like a nice little ‘fuck you’ to Draco’s murky history to stroll down the street, past a muggle girl with her eyes trained on her...cell phone? And think nothing of it as she turns the corner and he strides through the doors of the university, ducking away from the coming storm and into his brand new life.
Harry clears his throat and nods sympathetically, “Why don’t you let me talk with Scorpius for a bit, and I’ll come visit you tomorrow afternoon? You can tell me all about what you think of the new students.”
He discovered in bits and pieces that year that her family is very religious, that they see her magic as a curse on their family, and her acceptance of it as a willful rejection of their belief system. They’d believed her childhood magic flares to be the work of demons and had even submitted her to an exorcism before Minerva had shown up to explain that she was a witch.
anymore,” he adds hastily, and Draco laughs.
“One time, in this very bathroom, we brewed a Polyjuice potion - well, Hermione brewed it, Ron and I rather just got in her way, probably - anyway, we did it to turn into a couple of our Slytherin classmates and sneak into their common room. Stuff tasted terrible, and felt even worse. Don’t recommend it, Polyjuice. Especially not at twelve.”
Draco’s sneer is half-hearted at best, battling a foreign sense of concern that rises in his chest, but he shrugs, “Or just a boggart come to haunt you.”
He’s back in his emerald green swim shorts and is happily admiring the way his own skin has tanned from afternoons out on this very beach while Potter spreads his towel out over the sand, nearly touching Draco’s.
“Light, dark, earth, and love.” Potter looks up for confirmation, and Draco is oddly satisfied by how simple it is to take the lead with him. Had he expected a power struggle? He isn’t sure. He nods, and watches raven hair fall back over green eyes as Potter’s attention returns again to his reading. He stares for a moment, then another, then he opens his book on fundamentals of alchemy and slips into his own world.
Today, Harry walks in to see Malfoy teaching Scorpius to animate a paper crane, the carefully folded parchment fluttering abortively under the gust of the charm, until a successful cast finally sends it flitting about the room.
“What if they don’t?” The dread in his tone breaks Harry’s heart all over again.
Because he doesn’t care why Potter is here.
“It makes sense to look to the future.” The words are sure and comforting, and Draco doesn’t know which one of them they’re for, but he appreciates Potter for saying them either way. He picks up Potter’s notes and sets back to reading, conjuring up a quill to make an additional note here and there.
“Not bad enough to demand a retest.”
“She was fighting for your soul all along.” Draco murmurs, wondering if even his own mother had loved him that much.
Draco groans into Harry’s mouth, opening up to his tongue and their kiss turns fast and frantic, and all he can think is more, more, as he drags his mouth down Harry’s neck and finally gets his lips on that chest, dropping to his knees and kissing a path down to toned abs, the muscles fluttering against his lips as Draco’s hands follow suit and fiddle with the buckle of his belt, the button on his jeans… He thinks he hears a soft whimper as he finally pulls the jeans away, tugging them down tan thighs and leaving Harry in only his white cotton boxers.
Sanctum, of course, is a loose term. Draco’s university housing is small and plain, but he can’t complain too much. He has a small kitchen area, a dining table that can fit two almost comfortably, and a bed with his trunk at the end and a wardrobe to one side. It reminds him the slightest bit of his wedge of the Slytherin boys’ dormitory, but not enough to be painful.
Draco finds himself wondering if Potter was always so quiet.
“Can I help you, Malfoy?”
“Potter,” he looks pained, but by annoyance rather than worry, “thank you.”
A beat of silence. Two.
The slide of his cock against Harry’s is what does it for Draco, and a moment later, he’s spilling his climax in bursts over Harry’s stomach and both of their cocks. Harry follows soon after, the slide of Draco’s release helping him along.
“I have an idea for that,” Harry says laughingly, hands already pulling the carefully tucked shirt from Draco’s trousers, even as he kisses down his neck and finds a tender place to suck on just over Draco’s collarbone.
Draco cradles the little boy in his arms, that warm draw only growing as tiny fingers close in a fist around the fabric at his shoulder. He hardly notices the kindly older woman that waves cheerfully to Harry and sees herself out.
There’s recognition in those green eyes, Potter knows who he’s talking to as he speaks, “I knew what she’d done for me, I knew she was never really gone, but to
This is supposed to be his chance to leave everything behind for something new.
Draco sits up and turns towards Harry, who follows suit, “I get to finally know, then? What is the big plan for Harry Potter after uni? Wait, what are you even studying, first of all?
And if they keep finding reasons to touch one other, with hands and salty lips and tongues...well, neither of them are opposed.
Hearing those sentiments, Harry can imagine them coming from Lucius and Narcissa’s mouths, the pair of them lecturing this boy on how to live his life, even as just a child.
Concern clouds his features as the patronus fades, and he’s on his feet in an instant, “Duty calls, then,” he murmurs to Dean before heading from the room, willing himself to tamp down the panic brewing in his chest until he knows the situation.
Scorpius Malfoy lay on the bed, his back arched in pain, and his eyes squeezed closed. The air leaves his lungs like a punch to the gut, and Harry turns to Minerva, “What happened?”
Certainly Potter doesn’t travel back to London each night, does he? That amount of international travel can’t be healthy...even if Potter
“I bet you’re eager to get back to them over the break.”
“A fresh start.” He says quietly, not intending for Potter to hear, but his companion nods, and he wills his cheeks not to flush pink. “Your turn then, let’s see what a saviour’s core looks like.”
Draco raises an eyebrow, “Strings?”
Remember when I said I'd post twice a week? That was a lie. Apparently I post every other day....
“Not interested in the Quidditch match?” He asks quietly, not particularly expecting an answer. Scorpius shakes his head, and Harry takes that as a sign to continue trying to talk to him. “It’s not for everyone, gets a little too loud and crazy in the stands, I think. Can be a stressful sport to watch.”
“Your...oh.” Draco looks between them, and the dark circles under Harry’s eyes make sense now. “You’re doing this on your own?”
to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
before the lecture begins.
Draco grudgingly makes plans to meet with Potter on the weekend. The bloody prat insisted that evenings didn’t suit his schedule.
Draco steps into his assigned classroom and feels simultaneously like the adult that he is and the 11-year-old boy that once walked through the doors of the Hogwarts Express for the first time. He’s not sure what to make of it.
The trend has become much more common among muggleborn and half-blood parents in recent years: sending their children to school where they can learn to understand their muggle heritage before attending Hogwarts. It’s unsurprising that Dean and Seamus elected to do so, since both of them were raised with muggle influences as children. Harry wonders sometimes if he should have sent Teddy, but his separation anxiety in those early years after the war was too intense, particularly when he was still hunting Death Eaters every day at work.
Eyyyy, Happy Christmas in August, my friends! ^.^
Draco shrugs, “At school, you painted a different picture.”
Potter nods too, then goes back to his reading, as though their entire exchange hadn’t happened.
But all of that has changed.
And then he’s gone.
Potter’s nose scrunches as he looks back to the notes, “
“Hullo, Harry!” Myrtle’s cloying voice blares loudly, far too close to Harry’s ear, and he offers her a tight smile. “I haven’t seen you around lately, sworn off making mischief in the lavatories?” She sounds simultaneously petulant and predatory, in the way only a bathroom-dwelling eternal fourteen-year-old can. “I miss your visits.”
By the time Monday arrives again, Draco has had the time to decide that he’ll pretend nothing happened at all. It’s not a full class anyway, they’re just turning their projects in and then they’re free to go, a lucky morning off as a reward for the effort they’ve put into their work for the first half of the term.
“Yeah. There, at least.”
“Not sooner than six hours, I’m aware.” Malfoy’s friendly tone with the matron is nearly as shocking as the fact that she allows him to interrupt her without scolding. “Please rest, Poppy. Thank you for looking out for him.”
Dean nods, that soft smile on his face again, “I’ve missed them more than I could have imagined, fires and all,” a fond chuckle fills the quiet room. “You going back to London for the hols, then?”
All magical beings are born with a neutral core. There are extreme exceptions to this, of course; for example, someone conceived under the influence of a love potion is likely to be born with a darker core. In contrast, a magic user that is Nephilim has traces of angelic magic that may predispose them to the light. We see these very little as a society, so you are to base your studies in the theory of neutral origin.”
Then again, Draco wouldn’t have said Potter was the type to see further education at all before being accosted by the presence of him in what should have been a safe space.
Potter is even more confused now, and Draco decides to be kind and merciful, so he shrugs, adding, “I did, however, learn the
One day I’ll actually write a fic where Harry is a wand maker because I’m obsessed with that concept *dreamy sigh*
“Of course,” Harry agrees distantly, preoccupied with the way that Scorpius’s whole body is contracted in pain, seemingly unaffected by the warm orange light of the spell Pomfrey is murmuring over him. “We’ll need to contact his father.”
Scorpius has looked up now, and is staring at Harry, grey eyes wide and alarmed, “You really did that?”
“But magic never goes away. When we die it goes back to the earth, which means…”
They sit in a peaceful moment of quiet, and then Potter is moving, getting to his feet and tossing that bloody hat down on his towel, “Come on then, I didn’t get to go swimming the last time.” He reaches a hand out to Draco, who takes it and allows himself to be pulled to his feet and into the cool clear water.
“I fucking love magic,” comes his awed whisper.
He’s hardly noticed the time passing when Potter jumps up at 5:30 on the dot and announces that he has to go, he has an obligation.
Eyes narrowed, Draco turns his attention to the book that Potter is studying so closely, realizing quickly that it’s a tutorial in Spanish. The snort is out of him before he can stop it, and that’s when Potter seems to notice that he’s there at all.
Draco finds that he very much likes this idea, and follows Potter’s lead, pushing the hem of his shirt up to his armpits, hands wandering over planes of solid abs and pectorals and salivating with his desire to put his mouth on them.
Anyone else love healer!draco? I'm a sucker for it.
The next thing he knows, he’s jolted awake by Harry, who’s swearing under his breath, and frantically gathering his clothes. It’s the middle of the night, judging by the darkness outside, and it takes Draco’s brain a few moments to catch up - Harry was supposed to leave at 5:30, he
endearing way. Draco sighs.
“Are you alright?” He’s asking before he can plan on it.
That is what brings them to the beach this Saturday, Draco sprawled on his stomach on a towel, trying to make sense of Potter’s very tiny scrawl in between pondering the possibility of
When he arrives at the hospital wing, it’s nearly empty, with just one girl sleeping soundly in a bed by the door, and a flurry of activity at the far end, a white privacy partition blocking his view.
taking courses on advanced magical theory.
Marsh nods and almost smiles, looking as pleased as Draco has seen her in their short acquaintance, “A very good question, and a good stepping off point for your projects. In pairs, you will research the different kinds of magic that affect a magical core, and prepare an essay on the potency of each. Then, you will examine your own cores, and determine what magic exactly lives within you.”
as if realizing who he’s speaking to and shakes his head, “Sorry, it’s been a while since I’ve been around anyone who...
The following Saturday brings the finishing touches on their project. They’ve written the required short essays on each subtype of magic, the longer essays on light and dark, and the exploration of each of their magical cores, and what they were able to determine about them from the projections they accessed.
Harry nods, “Ask for Flannery, she’s a curse-breaker with DMLE.”
His glasses are gone, and a certain tension is missing from his shoulders, but it’s him alright. Dark curls spill over his face, covering the fractals of scarring that span from his hairline to the outer corner of one eye...an eye that is weighed down by bags and dark circles. He looks
his eyes rolling, “Attending class, obviously.”
What the fuck.
He’s laying on his back, hands folded together behind his head and eyes presumably studying the fluffy clouds above them, “So, a potions mastery, then?”
Potter doesn’t seem to mind it either, after getting over his apparent surprise at Draco’s suggestion. He’d arrived with a towel of his own, in swim trunks and a “t-shirt” for what Draco guesses to be some muggle band, and had easily taken Draco’s stack of notes when the blonde suggested that they read up on each other’s findings.
He doesn’t know if it hurts more that Harry has somewhere else more important to be, or that he doesn’t seem interested in
He keeps pace with Harry, twisting his hand this way and that, just how he does when he’s alone - and it’s appreciated if the way Harry’s hand stutters and a moan rumbles in his chest is anything to go by. All too soon, Draco is close, their kisses turn into panting against one another’s mouths, and Harry shifts them, his free hand leaving crescent moon marks from his fingernails in the skin of Draco’s bicep as it trails down to pull Draco’s hips closer, to align their cocks and lace their fingers and stroke both of them together.
“I destroyed the elder wand.” The words are simple and thoughtful and Draco can’t help gaping at them.
“Muggle fairytales are usually stories about princes and princesses and true love and happy endings and all that,” Potter explains carefully, and Draco registers that he is truly trying to avoid an argument. How annoying.
It makes him all the more nervous to see his own, to have Potter draw this projection from him, and analyse the particles of his soul.
“That’s why I enrolled in university.” Potter breaks the silence, his eyes back on Draco’s, “The chance to just...learn. I went from a shitty muggle childhood to a magical war and somewhere in the middle I was supposed to figure out how to live in a whole different world. I wanted to learn about magic in peace, without all of the...distractions.”
But Potions or no, Potter is
that they find a change of scenery.
A young woman in the front row raises her hand and speaks in Korean that quickly shifts to English in Draco’s ears, “What about other types of magic? Do they change our cores?”
Scorpius gazes into the middle distance with watery eyes, like he’s seeing something that isn’t there. “I’m...supposed to be in Slytherin, but the Slytherins don’t want me because I’m really a Gryffindor, but I- I

There are students sprinkled here and there at the tables, and what looks like a small coffee bar in the far corner. Rows and rows of books line the walls, and most of them actually appear to have been bound this century. But the biggest difference, of course, is the chatter. Students speak amongst themselves, debating their subject of study or laughing at the antics of their friends.
Without the baggage of his reputation looming over him, it’s easy.
He partially retracts that thought, however, as he turns to see Potter hastily jotting down notes, just barely making out the words “dark” and “conditioned” and “turning-point.” The reality that so much of him can be seen by someone else, by this specific someone else comes crashing back and he feels cold. He carefully watches Potter’s face for some sort of emotion, but sees only an academic focus there. He’s not sure if Potter’s hiding his emotions on purpose, but the man’s not been known to be subtle in the past…
“That’s fantastic, congratulations. Maybe I’ll be able to catch a match this summer.”
Class proceeds with the rest of last week’s lecture on types of magic, each of which they’ll explore further as the term moves along. Draco furiously scribbles notes, and he notices that today, Potter is too. He likes to think he can take credit for seriously saving Potter’s education.
“Not this time. Just can’t seem to shut her gob. Told a bunch of muggles all about her daddies being wizards. That’s what we get for sending her to muggle primary school.”
“Scorpius...he’s struggled to adjust. He talks to me, but I can’t be here...He told me you’ve helped him.”
“You’ll tell the Headmistress that I am quite alright, thank you. I’m off to rest now, and the young Mr. Malfoy is in the best care possible.”
He trails off and he can feel Harry looking at him with curiosity. A jab in the stomach from Harry prompts him along, “We did write
Potter looks around curiously for a moment, then drops his bag by the leg of the dining table and pulls out one of the two chairs, settling himself down. The bags and circles under his eyes look even worse than usual, and Draco wonders if he’s slept this week at all. Maybe he’s been as nervous about this section of the assignment as Draco has. There’s something reassuring about the idea that Draco isn’t alone in the nearly crippling anxiety that such self-scrutiny brings him.
An exaggerated look of mourning crosses Harry’s face and he pulls Draco in by the shirt, erasing the space between them and trailing light kisses across Draco’s jaw to his mouth, “No more writing,” he murmurs against Draco’s lips.
“What, like Cinderella
In an effort to shake off his annoyance, Draco joins the fray anyway. He finds that his classmates are tolerable. He even meets a few that live in the same university housing that he does. This is good. Making friends, being amicable.
They stand there for a long moment, foreheads pressed together and hands interlocked and covered with their mess, simply sharing air.
Potter laughs and it’s musical and happy, “nevermind.”
“Have we?” Harry asks excitedly, “not that I’m relieved that it’s over but that we don’t have to
Potter looks abashed at that, looking away from Draco and back up at the sky. “I don’t like to use my influence to get things for myself...but she convinced whoever needed convincing to let me sit the exams…and...I don’t know anything for sure, but they seemed a bit easier than they should have been.”
There’s red, a coil of it branching up and out like a tree, intermingled with green, as though they’ve spent Potter’s entire life in a dance for control. Darkness and love, Draco realizes, his eyes widening as he wonders what kind of magic has so steeped Potter’s soul in both darkness and love.
“You’ve been leaving to get home to...all this,” He says morosely, ready to start apologizing as best he knows how for being so pushy, but the warmth in Harry’s eyes as he looks at the two of them makes him feel already forgiven. The tension in his chest settles the slightest bit but still, “Harry, How did I
These words, of course, only cut Potter deeper, and the wounded look grows, “I’m not making excuses, Draco!” And when did Potter start calling him by his first name? “I’m not trying to avoid being with you, the other night was…” he sighs heavily, “It was amazing, and I wanted to wake up with you, I just hadn’t planned...I had to go.”
It’s Draco who decides they’ve gleaned as much from the library as they can and demands- no, not demands,
Draco wants sunshine he can stretch out and nap in, like a cat, warm and dry and...well at least he’ll be too busy in class today to really notice the weather. It’ll clear up. Perhaps by the weekend he can visit the beach, explore the town further.
Harry is right on track to be late for brooms up as he winds his Gryffindor scarf around his neck. He supposes it would be good to at least look impartial, but as Gryffindor’s head of house, he usually tries to get away with wearing a piece of his old school gear - it’ll always be his team, after all.
Empty...save for one soul, tucked into a corner in the second-floor girls’ bathroom. Curious, Harry takes a closer look, surprised to see the name Scorpius Malfoy. A pang of worry and nausea runs through him, but he refuses to think about his previous experience with Malfoys in bathrooms as he jogs towards the second floor.
I have no restraint, so here’s a second chapter today!
“You’ll be very good at that,” comes Potter’s honest reply, and it’s like a breath of fresh air. Acceptance that yes, he has things to make up for, and yes, he’s perfectly capable of doing it.
Harry expects Malfoy to fight back, to argue, anything. Anything other than narrow his eyes and take a step back, tucking his wand away. His left hand still balled into a tight fist is the only sign of resistance to the matron’s words.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s decided that it’s part of his new leaf not to let this pass without comment. He’s going to talk to Potter about what happened. Or he’s going to try to, because as soon as Marsh dismisses class, Potter is out the door and headed down the hall. It’s only just gone 11 in the morning, so Draco knows it isn’t time for his mysterious evening plans yet, and he hastens after Potter, grabbing him by the elbow and pulling him into an alcove off the hallway where a very cubic loveseat sits next to what looks like a bright yellow ficus.
Memories of summers at the Dursleys’ drew Harry to keep careful watch over her back then, and he went out of his way to mentor her through her transition to the wizarding world, offering her a door that was always open, and what solidarity he could with her situation at home.
“Malfoy…” Harry turns to look at him fully, brows furrowed, “our history aside, I am looking out for him.” He gazes at the boy, now sleeping peacefully, “I’m just sorry I haven’t done a better job of it so far.”
“And the way in which we manipulate the magic we draw from the earth determines its affiliation, to light or to dark?” Potter is scanning the notes again, but Draco nods.
The inside of the cottage is an assault of cozy domesticity, the lingering smell of breakfast from the kitchen, the clatter of self-washing dishes over the music in the kitchen, and it takes a few moments for Draco to notice the signs, toy blocks spread about the living room rug, tiny little rain boots stuck by the door, a high-chair set at one end of the kitchen table.
Pomfrey chooses that moment to return with a couple vials of potion.  She sets them on the bedside table before looking at Malfoy, “If I know you at all, Draco, there’s no sense telling you to leave, so you can see that he gets his potions. One when he wakes, and the other when the pain starts again, but not-”
Monday brings yet another Advanced Magical Interactions class and for the first time, Draco arrives before Potter. In fact, Potter only walks in a moment before Marsh does, giving Draco only a moment to watch him cast his
Harry smiles, shaking his head at Ron’s sentiments as he takes a sip of tea. He consciously reminds himself of Minerva’s words yesterday, not to judge the Malfoy boy before he meets him.
“What do you want?” he snaps, ready to turn and keep walking, but Potter’s hand is still on his arm.
Those eyes flicker down to Draco’s pale hand and back up to his face, and they’re both leaning into each other, and just when Draco thinks that maybe they’ll-
“It’s dark.”
Potter makes the space feel smaller than it is, but he’s always been larger than life. Even Draco can admit that.
Potter makes a noise of interest and jots down another note. Draco turns back to look at him as the projection fades entirely, leaving them back in the relative darkness of Draco’s rooms.
Draco is distracted from any confusion over the Boy-Who-Is-Somehow-Still-Alive by the notes he begins furiously scribbling onto parchment.
Draco laughs, his head falling back and then dropping to Harry’s shoulder, “hmm, I think we could probably arrange that. Although….”
have the sway to have a personal portkey to London and back.
Despite being cut off, Draco can’t help smiling in the face of Potter’s excitement, “Yes, exactly.”
Minerva, for her part, hasn’t mentioned the Deputy Headmaster position again, to Harry’s great relief. She has, however, been giving him a certain look when they pass in the hallway. A look that says, ‘
The look Potter gives him is almost amused, and then he’s gone, turned on his heel and out the library door.
“I never expected to see you so excited to learn.” The words are out before Draco can catch them, or vet them for the pure idiocy they are.
If only he could stop thinking of that damned Potter.
Harry deflates, and Draco’s sure he’s going to walk away, but he doesn’t, he puts his arm out for Draco to take, and an instant later, they’re apparating.
The unyielding squeeze of apparition gives way to a quiet beachside cottage, laundry on the line outside, and soft music from a wireless streaming out of what must be the kitchen window.
Draco’s toes would curl were they not firmly planted on the floor, keeping him tenuously upright as Harry Potter jerks him off.
“Lottie’s taken after her Pa a little more than I’d hoped,” he finally says, setting the letter aside, his eyes filled with joy and a very slight melancholy. It must be hard to be away from her. Harry recalls again how tough it was to leave Teddy for the first couple years he taught. It only got easier when Teddy came to Hogwarts too, and Dean has a few years yet before his daughter can join him here.
Harry tilts his head, and he must see something in Draco’s face because the corner of his mouth turns up in the tiniest smile and he tentatively steps forward, “You’re not upset about the notes?” he asks, almost teasingly, and Draco shakes his head and swallows thickly because now Potter is
(See the end of the chapter for
You think I've stormed after you like a madman over the
“Yes, well, everything old is new again.”
Finally, Marsh brings up their project again, explaining that it will be a study on magical cores.
Of course, it’s Harry fucking Potter.
Draco’s on his feet without thinking, and then he’s beside the wall, looking down slightly to meet Potter’s eyes (and now so isn’t the time to feel satisfaction in being taller than Potter, but it’s there anyway).
Harry smiles, bright and white and a little too much, “That shifty old bat!” He says, laughing and clearly fonder than the words would lead one to believe. “She did the same to me,” he admits, “Told me she always thought I could be successful in school, given a proper opportunity.” He shakes his head, “I wonder how many of our year she tracked down and pulled strings for.”
A moment later, Draco Malfoy sweeps in, a nebulous wave of terror and lime green healer’s robes. He bypasses both Harry and Minerva, stepping right up to the bedside, fists clenched as he actively fights the urge to reach out and touch his son.
He finds Potter already waiting in the university library, which is as opposite to the Hogwarts library as anything Draco could imagine. It’s spacious, modern, full of square tables surrounded by chairs on casters with seat cushions of bright blue, green, and orange, and despite the wall of glass illuminating the space, there’s not a fleck of dust in the air to be seen.
The world is his oyster. Or...the little town of Puerto Paz is his oyster. The population here is an interesting mix of magic and muggle - the university itself even offers classes for muggle students - with rows of shops and strips of beach wrapped in protective enchantments to keep the muggles away, and a handful of muggle bars and restaurants that happily cater to the magically inclined as well.
He strolls over to the table where Potter is slouched over a text, his feet flat on the floor, his nervous energy only showing itself in the way he rolls the wheels of his shockingly orange chair back a few centimetres then forward again, all without breaking his concentration on his reading.
Professor Marsh makes her grand entrance at exactly the right moment, announcing that she’ll be assigning their first major project today. She’s speaking in rapid Spanish, but what Draco hears is English with an accent distinct to the translation magic in his ears. Potter is hearing the same, if the way his jaw has dropped open minutely is any indication.
Of course, he doesn’t need to worry about that, does he?
Draco just what is so important.
“He’s going to be okay.” Pomfrey’s voice is soft, a combination of the atmosphere in the room and her own fatigue from fighting the curse. “I’ve seen this particular curse before, he’ll sleep for a time, and when he wakes he will be sore and weak. I’d like to keep him here until he recovers fully.”
“What does your father say?” The question is out before Harry can decide if he really wants to ask it. He doesn’t know why the answer makes him so nervous.
“How is earth magic dark and light at the same time?” Draco nearly jumps at the sound of Potter’s voice and has to drag his eyes from the man’s throat to his eyes, which don’t hold the slightest hint of accusation, they’re just earnest and interested, like they always seem to be these days.
Harry stares at him like a doe in wandlight and Draco realizes that yes, it’s
Harry smiles against his shoulder and pushes him down into the bed, slotting their hips together and rocking slowly against him, “I don’t intend to.”
Draco loses count, though he’s sure they don’t quite make it to ten - even with magic helping them along - before they fall asleep, pressed together in the dorm bed that is clearly meant for just one person.
It’s then that a silvery cat bounds into the room, leaping up to perch on the arm of Harry’s chair before speaking in Minerva’s voice, “Professor Potter, please report to the hospital wing immediately.”
Potter seems to think about that for a moment and then grins, “No, not bad enough for that. They were still nastily exhausting, after all. And I’m not using them to get a job, just to get into school, so I can go do more school, and
“You look like shite.” He says, by way of announcing himself. Potter’s answering glare makes a childish pride flare in his chest. “You didn’t take the weekend to sleep in, I see.” He adds, settling into the surprisingly comfortable blue chair across from Potter and blatantly staring at the dark circles that linger under Potter’s eyes.
They work up to a routine, spending Saturdays in the library mining the texts there for data and information, occasionally trading comments on the content of their notes, all shuffling paper and nearly companionable silence until Potter suddenly has to leave at 5:30 each day for what Draco assumes is the same mysterious obligation. They build up a repository that is more than enough to begin executing their essays on each type of magic and the way it affects a human core.
I saw him and I just...I knew he was my family. I’ve never felt anything like that before.”
“A Malfoy?” Harry prompts gently.
The room has seating for about twenty, the chairs are nearly full, and he only gives himself a few moments to size up his classmates - a handful of people he’ll get to know quite well, he assumes - before he swans down the rows of desks to claim one of very few open seats. It’s near the middle of the room, and next to a rather scruffy looking dark-haired man.
Harry hurries to where Minerva stands a careful distance away, giving Pomfrey the space to tend to the student in the bed there. He hears the pained whimpers before he reaches the bed, aborted noises of agony, and then he sees the student.
We’re almost to the end! <3
He’s saved, of course, by Potter reaching out across the minimal space between them and tilting Draco’s head down by his jaw, then kissing him, a quick press of lips against lips. It’s over in a second, but Draco’s hand has reached out of its own accord and dug it’s fingers into the soft fabric of Harry’s shirt to pull him closer. The second time it’s not so quick, it’s a slow slide of fragile skin, and Harry’s lips are chapped and Draco’s catch against them and he doesn’t care, he doesn’t care at all because he’s on
They’d nearly kissed. Draco was certain of that. And maybe....maybe after spending weeks together, maybe after seeing into his soul and realizing that Potter isn’t the person Draco thought he was....
The stormy sky is not a good omen on this, his first day of university classes. Didn’t he elect to attend school on the balmy coast of Spain because the weather was supposed to improve his mood? No dreary English summer for him, not this year.
Thanks so much for sticking through my sporadic posting whims and reading this as we go, y'alls comments have been so sweet and encouraging. Here's a last little dose of fluff for you, until next time <3

. And why
“Oi, Harry,” Francisca started again, looking pointedly at the man. “I think Berê was looking for you, after the—wait.” She lifted her head as if scenting something in the air. The pause only lasted a couple of seconds before. “
“What do you mean?” Draco asked.
What a preposterous notion, that Draco would be marginally satisfied by spending more time than necessary with Potter. No. If he was following Potter it was simply to appease the man’s conscience, as his saviour complex didn’t seem to ebb away with time, now worsened by the slightest scratch on Draco’s porcelain skin. If his well-being was enough to have Potter wobbling, it was too bad for him and not Draco’s business.
Potter laughed from where he was leaning against the baluster and crossed his arms, his tattoos stretching with the pulled muscles. “It’s carnival. Kids are supposed to go partying. Don’t argue with this. You just have to accept it. Also, you could come ‘gallivanting around the forest’ with me, you know. Should I take it personally that you don’t want my company?”
Saci jumped outside at the same time Harry’s whirlwind filled the room, making everything around Draco fly and crash against the walls. And then, Draco was plunged into the most complete darkness-filled quietness again.
Draco frowned, and the skin pulled over his body as if he was puckering. “No. Everyone seems… normal? I feel good. Actually. But bad. But
Curupira laughed again, this time with his own hissing voice. It was a hoarse and disturbing sound.
me! You all are to blame for what that girl is suffering! For what she’s doing to you!” And if it was not for Harry, Draco might as well leave them be. Let them deal with their own problems. “You’re going to help me, now!”
“Harry. Harry’s got it worse than I did. Salazar! He had a Dark wizard
. It was just as his father always wanted. Of course, the desire of making his father proud certainly hadn’t lasted long before images of girls were replaced with boys… and as he grew, of men. Of magazines hidden under his bed, desires and fantasies revolving around a certain green-eyed boy with tousled hair.
Draco felt too heavy to even consider moving. “Here? In Brazil?”
life would try to throw him off his balance by shoving the Boy Who Won’t Die in his face after years of silence and three hours—he checked his watch yet again—and thirteen minutes.
It was most fortunate to watch Longbottom’s face outlined in the flames, interference keeping his features from appearing clearly. Draco caught himself kneeling and glaring at his friend—not that he would ever admit it.
mesmo” and “
“Yes, exactly! It’s a bit more complex than Apparition, but I can teach you. Apart from boats, flying brooms, cars—my car, actually—and Tree Com, this is one of the few ways to travel and communicate inside the grounds of Homunin.”
He was thankful half an hour later to notice that Lua hadn’t dived too deep into the forest.
“Draco, we need to go back to the school!” Harry’s fingers, scorching hot, grabbed Draco’s wrists. “They might need help!”
Draco gulped. Words failed him. He tried again, voice shaking with uncertainty. “W-what?”
Potter’s eyes, previously fixed on the screen of his telly, turned to Draco. “She’s not mine.”
I know it might sound weird, but we do get about a week off from school to enjoy the carnival.
that wrong, per se, since Draco wasn’t asking Saci to do anything bad—or to do anything at all, besides meeting him every day and not telling anyone. It wasn’t good, either, of course. Draco was beginning to enjoy Saci’s company enough not to care about it.
“Of course she was,” the Headteacher agreed. She didn’t sound distrustful, even if her smile had turned vicious. “We have a saying in Brazil, Mr Malfoy, that would apply to someone like Tainara; ‘c
Curupira wanted him to get lost. And well, Draco was.
“You make alliances with the bloody Queen, meanwhile you are lying on the floor with—with a broke,
Now Draco was in the dog pound, and he was lonely. None of the other dogs wanted to be his friend. They knew he wasn’t right; they knew he wasn’t like them. A bulldog named Gobbler wouldn’t stop shooting him evil glares.
Potter frowned. “But why?”
Draco ground his teeth. He wanted to find this Dudley, sit him down for a nice, long chat. “And your lover?”
Theo pressed his wand to Draco’s temple, the cold wood biting into his skin. He brushed his lips against Draco’s, sighing. “I’ve made up my mind. I want to keep you for myself.”
Curiosity burned in Goyle’s eyes, but he was too well-trained to ask any questions. “Yes, Your Grace.”
“In bed together?”
FOR IT AND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING.”
On the road the trees parted to reveal a grand estate. Harry peered out the window in awe. A large residence rose up from the ground, its stone facade sun-licked. It sat on a slight incline, its countless windows spying on the duke’s countless miles of land. Clouds were fast approaching.
The last time the Queen had summoned him on such short notice, she had requested (demanded) he step in to cool tensions in a particularly bloody trade dispute between Liverpool weavers and the Crown’s oversea interests. Draco had ultimately fared well, all things considered, but the dispute had taken up months of his energy.
“Fine,” Draco said lazily, and reclined in his seat. “Fortunately we are nearly there.”
“Don’t worry; Lady Parkinson has already told me about it, or she sort of did.”
“What?” Potter wheezed.
“I took you home with me.”
“Would you like it? My library … you have your pick. What about poetry?”
“No!”
“It is only because of you, Your Grace.”
“Tell me.”
A faint smile touched Malfoy’s lips. “Something like that.”
“Does it? I can’t imagine how you’ll earn it.”
Harry watched himself use the duke’s mouth, thrusting and thrusting, the duke’s eyes fluttering, his cheeks streaked with a hot flush. The duke seemed unable to contain the moans that rumbled in his chest. His hand came up to cradle Harry’s bollocks, roll them; Harry felt himself stiffen even more.
Using an army of towels, Draco got Harry all dry. He sank to his knees to run a towel down his legs, over his feet. Harry’s cock was now fully hard, so Draco took a moment to run his tongue along the shaft, over the head.
“Oh?” Malfoy said, looking pleased.
When they made it back to the castle, full darkness had fallen. The castle blazed like an ornate birthday cake. Surprisingly, Harry found it a welcoming sight.
“Definitely not.” Another grin.
“So will you be returning to Oxford?” Ginny asked eagerly.
“Spit it out,” Draco drawled.
“Tell me.”
“Your body is desperate for relaxation,” Malfoy murmured, his fingers massaging a tight spot right underneath Harry’s shoulder blade.
“But I insist you stay at Malfoy Castle through the end of the year. It would be my pleasure.”
Granger threw open the first wardrobe. Inside hung fancy dress for gentlemen. “Each Christmas the duke holds a Christmas Eve dinner for his twenty closest friends. It’s the only time when he entertains more than a handful of people at Malfoy Castle. Well, it’s usually the only time, but this year is different since there will be his enormous New Year’s Eve party.”
The duke slammed his hat back on and rushed out. Harry forced himself to close the door calmly, then he locked it.
“No, Your Grace.”
Draco grasped her hand. Everything went dark, the tears still rolling down his cheeks.
“I know. I’m sorry.” Behind his glasses, Harry’s eyes shined with tears.
Harry tried to gulp down his anger. He would not get into an argument with these people. He would not embarrass the duke.
,” Harry said.
Then Draco took off.
“It’s a beauty, isn’t it?”
When Ron and Hermione had left, they put little Scorpius to bed, and wandered back down to the parlour for a cuddle in front of the fireplace.
, Draco wanted to say. He bit his lip. He was sure Potter would kick him out if he really said it.
Potter now outright frowned. “I think a better question is why you don’t care.”
Draco grinned snottily. “Granger definitely fancied you, I remember.”
“No.”
“I rarely like to think about it, let alone talk about it.”
. Not anymore. The only thing that matters in this world to me is you. I discovered that. It took a stupid fall from a horse, but I finally discovered it.”
“Yes, Your Grace, but be careful. We don’t want to get ourselves in a situation where we have to pay a ransom for him.”
Harry was crushed, devastated. He felt as if he would never love again.
around him?
“Stop,” Draco moaned.
“Will you accompany me to the conservatory?” the duke said.
“Are you enjoying this?” Potter cooed. He reached down blindly, trying to grab Draco. Draco released his cock and kneeled, giving Potter access to his stiffy.
“WHAT?” Draco roared.
“What nonsense,” Potter murmured, but he looked delighted.
, Harry,” Granger said. “Your business is entirely your own. My only concern is what you can do for our cause.”
“The conservatory. I would like to show it to you.”
, he slipped out from the bedroom and wandered to the hallway toilet. When he caught sight of Draco in the bathtub, he screamed bloody murder.
Ron still looked a tad shell-shocked. “Yeah, it’s definitely a surprise. We all thought you hated one another.”
Harry stared at his fire-licked profile. A ball of possessive anger rotated inside him. Another man had most likely been
Potter nodded and gave him a peck on the lips. “I’ll wait for you in bed.”
Suddenly Draco felt very hungry for Potter’s touch. He pulled out his wand and muttered a spell. Every piece of clothing disappeared from his body.
“We can’t speak openly with one another.”
“Sure you could have.”
Potter stuttered and tried to refuse, but the two women said they were leaving anyway. Draco and Potter sat down, and a waiter hurried over to take their drink orders.
The guest room was nicely decorated in soft colours and light woods. A fire crackled on the hearth. Harry stood by the fire and let the warmth seep into his bones. Millbank had made him very cold.
“I’ll pay for it,” Granger said, her shrewd gaze already calculating.
Draco turned, another
“I couldn’t use
“Good evening,” Harry said, heart thumping.
The guests in the music room began to move to the dining room, which had been transformed. Even more crystal hung from the chandelier, along with garland and berries. Snow dusted the window sills, the enormous ornate carpet. Harry touched some of the wet substance and confirmed it was real snow.
“What
“I don’t think so,” Granger said.
. The men … it doesn’t surprise me in the least that they act barbaric in their homes. Have you seen how they act out in the streets, where anyone can see them?”
“Open it up,” Ginny said eagerly.
“He says he’s glad you moved out of the flat you shared with him. You deserved a new beginning.”
“Mr Potter,” said a devious voice to his left. He turned and found Lady Parkinson.
“That’s why I can’t let healers examine me. They want to kill my baby.”
Harry was down in the kitchen, searching through the cupboards for something to make for dinner. It had been a few days since he’d been to Tesco, so there wasn’t much to find.
“Perhaps we should track him down? See if he has anything to confess?”
Only decades of Ducal training kept Draco’s expression perfectly bland. Inside he was screaming. The upcoming election was already a disaster, and the liberals had taken a surprising lead. Politics was a messy business, a time-consuming business. Draco excelled at it; but he had better things to do with his time, more important things to do. His tenants were still struggling. His lands were finally making a small profit, but if he wasn’t careful, people would starve on his watch.
“Got it.”
It was dinner time when Malfoy woke up. Harry was frying up two steaks in the kitchen when he heard a crash. He took the steaks off the hob and dashed upstairs.
“Right,” Harry said, but his racing mind altered her words:
“Are you ready for that bath?”
“‘Soft and tasty’?” said Lady Greengrass. “In all my life, I’ve never heard of a chicken described that way.”
“Is that Malfoy Castle?” Harry said faintly.
“Yes,” the duke hissed, and took him into his mouth. His mouth was sinfully wet and tight, and he moaned lowly as sank down, his beautiful, refined lips stretched around Harry’s shaft.
“Is it true you work with those mannish bluestockings?”
“Okay?”
Gulping, Potter leaned down and grabbed his shoulders. He was stiff with hesitation, his gorgeous eyes round with dismay.
“I can’t go back to bed!” he said. “I have work to do for Lady Granger, Professor Weasley. I’ll lose my scholarship—I can’t go back—”
The duke frowned at him. “Is everything all right?”
They were perched in Potter’s parlour, a chessboard between them. Draco paused, his eyes trained on the rowdy pawns.
Harry just sat there, worrying his bottom lip. Draco threw his arms up. “I can’t stand you!” Draco yelled. “You are the most infuriating man to live with!”
“I think I’ll call you Peppermint.”
? He put a basilisk in a secret chamber underneath Hogwarts that woke up and started attacking Muggleborn children.”
“No, it’s not. Marry me, Harry. Marry me and make me the happiest man on earth.”
“Someone could walk in, see us.”
, Harry thought darkly. At least then he would have ended up with some titillating memories to keep him company while imprisoned.
Draco blinked in surprise. He felt a flare of hope and quickly snuffed it out. Hope was dangerous.
“Take off your clothes. I want to see you.” Harry’s eyes were dark with lust.
“It sounds complicated.”
Harry let his hand slip under the duke’s jacket, feeling how his warm skin heated his silky shirt. If he let his hand drift lower, he would encounter the duke’s erection, so heavy, so needy.
Draco dropped his hands, his expression now under control. He cocked an eyebrow. “Did you enjoy yourself?”
The wind had picked up. It felt like icy fingers through his thin coat. At least Harry’s cap slightly protected his ears.
“Fuck, I’m knackered.” Malfoy slumped into a chair next to him.
“Then I’m
“Hello,” Draco said calmly.
“No.”
“I brought wine,” Draco said, and stupidly held up the bottle.
wished. He wasn’t going back to that castle.
The officer blushed a blotchy red. “As you wish, Your Grace.”
“Let’s start with that, then I will have to think about my next steps.”
“Oh.”
Lady Granger brandished her arm in the air like a sword. “Begin!” she ordered, encouraging them forward. It felt like she had yelled
“You’re still pregnant,” Harry said.
“I don’t want you to leave!” Potter cried.
“No, I don’t want to say,” Harry said, crossing his arms and holding himself. “I’d rather not talk about it.”
“Remember, the doctor is also on the way.”
Theo turned away; he lifted his face to the sun. “It’s always difficult when we lose people,” he said softly. “As you know, I lost my whole family.”
Draco cleared his throat. “The man looked perfectly acceptable, ma’am. Reasonable, even.”
him. Draco was a powerful man, yes; but Potter was the one with all the power when it came to Draco.
“You didn’t hurt the cause.” Lady Granger gave him a swift, assessing look. “Nobody has ever had the bollocks to go near Duke Malfoy. Perhaps bringing a man on board
“Oh, please.” Draco twisted. He grabbed Potter, wanting him closer, wanting him on top of him,
Miss Weasley fell into a coughing fit. Some of the other women stared at Granger like she had two heads. Yes, Lady Hermione Granger had just said
Malfoy’s eyes fluttered open. “Oh, um. Do you mind helping me with a wash?”
Harry gathered him in his arms, holding him tight. He leaned up to find Harry’s lips. As their kiss once again grew desperate, he hoped it conveyed to Harry what he could not put into words.
Pansy took a deep breath. “I’ll fix us some tea. Everything’s better with tea.”
It took him only a few minutes to realise someone was following him. The back of his neck itched, a set of footsteps trailed behind him. He went down another street, made a few quick turns; the footsteps kept pace.
Goyle opened the door and shoved Dursley out. He landed in cold, dirty mud. The carriage took off again.
“Yes, Your Grace!” Watkins hurried off to saddle up the horses.
“Men pay me to stick their pricks up my arse. I am good at it. Too good, as it turns out.”
Harry’s heart was pounding hard. He saw their opinions of the duke changing; he saw their expressions turning a little hostile, a little judgmental. He refused to let the duke injure himself socially like this.
happened from happening.
Pince would have had a stroke if her students behaved like this.
“What do you say we head out to the Quidditch pitch?” he glances around the bathroom and lowers his voice “before Myrtle comes back.”
“What the hell are you doing here?”
and he doesn’t know exactly what to do with that.
Much as he’s loath to allow Potter to continue to feature in his thoughts, Draco’s unable to stop wondering about it for the majority of the afternoon and into the evening.
Okay, that’s a little dramatic. But Draco is intent on things being different from here on out. This is a fresh start for him, the war is behind him and Hogwarts is too, there’s no one left to tell him what to do, to believe, to strive for. He refuses to allow that to be a bad thing.
of his core is neutral, save for a splotch of green near the bottom, a cluster of dark magic that he knows in an instant is tied to the whole ordeal with Dumbledore. He shutters. There are other pinpricks of green here and there, mostly halfway between top and bottom, spells he used a scant number of times that have coloured his core sheerly for the effect they had on his life, though none as close to the base, the root of his magic as those from 6th year. There’s also, to his great surprise,
Harry laughs too, shaking his head and marveling at her confidence. The way she carries herself is worlds away from the 11 year old girl he once knew, and his heart warms to think he’s had a hand in it. He claps her on the shoulder. “Give ‘em hell, I’ll be there to cheer you on.”
“Like what?”
“What can I do, Poppy?” His voice is surprisingly calm. He’s pulling out his wand and pushing back his sleeves as though to join her incantations when she looks up at him for a fraction of a second, her face stern enough to give pause to Voldemort himself.
Bollocks of course, the uni doesn’t offer courses past six. Well, other than midnight astronomy and divination seminars, but Potter doesn’t seem the type to seek further education in those topics.
He walks forward without thinking and reaches his arms out, and maybe he should be surprised when Harry immediately hands the child over, but he isn’t, because he knows in his soul that this little boy is his family. It feels like something bigger than him, big enough to fill the whole room.
Boneless, Potter collapsed against the bed. Draco bobbed a little, not ready to release him. Potter moaned deep in his throat.
For several days after his return to Oxford, all Harry could do was sit in his gloomy letted room, and stare at the emerald coat the duke had given him.
“Yeah,” Potter breathed, “but I will need help down.”
“Didn’t he mention trouble with his cousin?”
The duke came to a halt with a spray of dirt. He jumped down from his panting horse.
Pansy lowered her voice. “Marriage won’t be so awful, you’ll see. People will leave you alone once you have a wife. You’ll have more privacy to do what you really want to do.”
“Sure, you say that now, but what if I anger you? What if I
“Thank you for asking,” Draco said. “I - it still hurts.”
life. The duke … he was safe. Mostly. Maybe. (What if something was leaked to the press?) Sure, people would talk. Perhaps they would even call the duke sinful … unnatural. But the Duke of Malfoy still had the ultimate hand to play—marriage. He could mess around with Harry, make him fall in love with him. He could
“So you grew up working the land?” When Potter nodded, Draco gave him a smile. “I like that. I like that a lot.”
“It disgusts you, doesn’t it?” Malfoy muttered, not opening his eyes.
“Try under the bed,” Draco said, feeling hollowed out.
“I can’t—I can’t.” Malfoy’s voice was a cry.
When Draco slid into his body, they both moaned. “This is paradise,” Harry said, clutching his shoulders.
Muttering a spell, Malfoy’s hands suddenly were slick with lotion. The lotion also smelled like sage and lavender.
, Harry thought, and shuddered.
Once again Harry blinked at her. Then her implication dawned on him. He ducked his head to hide his sudden deep flush. Surely no one understood what she was implying? He had only exchanged a handful of words with the duke … there was no way the duke
“Yes, but I also want to help the working man!” To demonstrate this point, Malfoy rummaged in Goyle’s pocket, then shoved a stack of pounds at the bartender. “See? I’m helping out the working man.”
“They wouldn’t deserve it. They would just be trying to do their job.”
Harry bit his lip, and it nearly distracted Draco. “I suppose you are right.” Harry took a deep, exhausted breath. “My cousin came to me … said he knew what was going on between us. He said he would blackmail you … I tried to bargain with him. It’s why I left Oxford and came to London to find work. I thought if I gave him all I made he would leave you alone. My plan was foolish, I know, but I was just so desperate.”
“You …” Weasley faltered. He seemed unsure how to respond. Then he leaned in to kiss Harry.
He looked quite bewildered when he stepped into the lounge. “There was no one there,” he told Draco.
“All those ugly scarves you wear … you made them, didn’t you?”
Potter took his time to savour the little cake, his eyes dropping closed as he took his first bite, his pink tongue sweeping along his lip to capture any crumbs.
“Don’t you dare faint on me.” Draco jumped to his feet to catch Potter before he slumped to the ground.
They sat down in two wooden chairs with a shimmering barrier between them. Potter wore his scarlet Auror robes. His eyes were dark like river moss. He looked angry and Draco wondered if Potter would curse him.
“Do you know what they do to make chickens this soft and tasty?”
“Want me to help with your hair?”
“I am from Kent,” Potter said quickly. “My people are farmers. My cousin—well, we are far below any personage.”
Later, when Draco was back in his cell, the walls crying sea water, he pressed a palm to his thin chest and felt a soft, warm glow on the inside. Draco closed his eyes and smiled just a little. He fell asleep.
Draco felt his forehead. “My God, you’re burning up.”
But life went on.
“Oh, yes, thank you,” Harry said.
“Yes,” he said, gazing out the window at the white expanse beyond. It thankfully had stopped snowing. “This is the nicest bed I’ve ever slept in. The problem is I just have so much work to do.”
“Jesus,” Harry said, breathing hard.
Officially, they were not supposed to be there. Their permit for a demonstration had not been approved, but Lady Granger had insisted that they still go through with their plan.
Harry’s heart thumped hard. “No, Your Grace.”
Draco barked and licked his cheek again. When Potter didn’t move away, he took a chance and dragged his tongue over Potter’s lips.
Snorting, Malfoy dug his fingers into Harry’s left cheek, searching for tightness. Harry’s eyes widened for a moment, then fell lidded.
The problem was Dudley knew what Harry liked to do with other men. They stared at one another, and Harry knew they were both thinking the same thing.
“You want me,” Draco said against his mouth. “Lord, you want me.”
“I know.”
“What is your educated guess?”
Malfoy took one of his bollocks into his mouth, sucking just a little, and he looked up at Harry as he did it. The sight of the Duke of Malfoy on his knees, his mouth stuffed with his bollocks, his eyes so dark and needy, made Harry come.
“You are determined to head back to Oxford the moment the new year arrives. That means we only have a handful of days together. I’d rather not let them go to waste.”
“How could you when you don’t love him!”
“Let me worry about my reputation,” Draco said, thrilled Potter had called him
“The National Society of Women’s Suffrage? Yes.”
Harry was considering takeaway when Malfoy came down the stairs. Harry dropped the biscuit he’d been munching on when he spotted Malfoy.
With his mouth pressed to the wet tile, Harry came hard, his toes curling, his mouth falling open. The water washed away his spunk.
“You can’t … touch me when other people are around.”
Draco cried out, his hands clutching his stomach. “I think - I think I’m in labour.”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry growled, and manoeuvred him onto the bed. Together they removed Draco’s shoes, his robes, his vest. Then his underpants. Harry moaned softly when he finally saw Draco’s prick. It was a gorgeous prick - long and pink. It was pretty.
Malfoy pinned him with his gaze. His expression was earnest, eager; it was almost hungry. “Please, Mr Potter,” he said softly. “Please stay with me for the holidays.”
“Yes,” Harry said simply, and withdrew his fingers. He slicked up his cock, then got into position between Draco’s long legs. “Ready?”
Draco gulped thickly. He realised his hands were shaking. “How is Harry going to … No, it’s ridiculous. I refuse to even entertain the idea.”
Waving goodbye to his teammates, he flew toward the locker rooms. He was in desperate need of a shower and a massage. He wondered if Malfoy was around.
“You’d be surprised.”
Harry wore the emerald coat gifted to him by the duke. He felt stupid admitting it, but the coat made him feel more confident, and he needed all the confidence he could get with what they were about to do.
“Oh, he’s
“Don’t look at me like that,” Malfoy snapped. “I don’t need your damned pity.”
“Do you suppose you will attend?” Parkinson said this with her eyes lowered almost shyly.
Holding him close, Draco carried Harry to safety.
“And you would never marry Parkinson?”
“Fine,” Draco said, and went to his dog bed and picked up his favourite milk bone.
Goyle snorted.
“No, I did it to protect you, to protect myself.”
For the first time in his life, Harry felt like he had an anchor.
“I can’t—it’s impossible,” Harry hissed.
Grand double doors swung open. The usher dipped low and addressed Draco and Secretary Dullborne: “Her Majesty will see you now.”
Harry slumped to the floor and buried his face in his knees. His pain came out in a sob, a terrible twisting of the voice. He heaved with tears.
Harry couldn’t help but stare at him. His face was clean-shaven and smooth like porcelain. His nose was both strong and delicate, with a faint point at the end. His chin had the same quality, perhaps more delicate than his nose. His eyes were the most captivating grey, the colours of a storm brewing in a dark blue sky. There was something forbidden, something
Draco wanted to put his hands on him. He wanted to drop to his knees for him. There, Draco admitted it. He wanted Potter to fuck him. He’d wanted it for so long, so fucking long, and it
Sighing, Malfoy sat upright in his chair, causing Harry to drop his hand. “I want to pay you back. I will. The moment I’m strong enough again, I’m going back to work.”
Malfoy gulped, his Adam’s apple bobbing along his long neck. “I couldn’t … I feel responsible for your health.”
Harry suddenly felt very, very dizzy. He fell back against the pillows, closing his eyes. He was chilled to the bone but he felt sweat dampen his hairline.
“Where does it hurt?” he murmured.
Draco wanted to snarl at him, wrap his hands around his neck and
Whining, Harry quickened his thrusts. He was Harry now. Forever. Draco felt a tear roll down his cheek, sneak along his ear.
“He’s leading the opposition campaign.”
him. It made Harry both pleased and ashamed.
Under the table, Harry’s hands curled into fists. So many men could be so demeaning about women. They spoke about them as if they were possessions. But that was the whole point, wasn’t it? In the eyes of British law, women
“I want you to stop your sinful ways. It’s
All Harry could do was sit back and grin like a fool. Malfoy’s eyes narrowed.
Harry was distracted by the approach of Lady Granger. He knew something was the matter when he sensed Lady Parkinson go still next to him.
“Well, and for Lady Granger.” Potter tapped his pen to a notebook. “I’ve been taking thorough notes.”
“Come on, now. We both know the duke would be disappointed if you didn’t show up.”
“You came to me,” Draco repeated stupidly.
“Please,” Draco whispered, throat dry, eyes burning.
Draco stood. “Get up.”
“No, you mustn’t worry. Trust me, Harry.”
The duke looked at him then. “How do you plan to spend Christmas?”
.” Then he moved his wand in two counter clockwise circles, then sliced down into an inverted V.
me, Malfoy.”
Harry had to think about it. It made him uncomfortable. It made him miss people. “I dunno … I guess it reminds me of what could’ve been.”
She quickly filled the lingering silence between them. “This concert—it’s a German duo. A soprano and a mezzo-soprano. Do you know German?”
Harry stood suddenly. “No!”
“Well,” said Miss Brown, thinking out loud, “there’s an election coming up. All the PMs will want to look accessible to the public. We will just need to ask for audiences with them.”
“Oh, Harry.”
“I’d think you of all people would understand the difference between evil and misunderstandings.”
The duke closed the space between them. He took off his top hat and rested it on the railing. His hair glimmered like the snow.
Then Harry’s heart leapt: He spotted Ginny in the crowd and hurried over to her. “Oh, I’ve missed you!” he said once they had exchanged greetings.
“Harry was the one person in this world who knew me.”
“Your view is brilliant,” Theo said.
“Oh, God,” Harry whispered. His stomach growled loudly.
He had been preoccupied, but Harry hadn’t pushed him for details. Afterall, a duke’s business must have been quite complicated. The interesting thing was on multiple occasions Harry had found him flipping through the book of suffragist readings Harry had given him for Christmas. Harry didn’t know what to make of it.
“Just tell him how you feel,” Ophelia Cyprus Black said.
Mr Weasley was a Classics professor at Oxford, and Harry had been lucky enough to nab a research position with him. The small stipend meant Harry could afford to eat after sending his two pounds to Dudley every month.
Harry’s heart grew so warm it nearly made him forget all about the dirty gaol cell he had just spent time in. The duke was a good and kind man.
“I could give you everything I have. I could work only for you. I’ll go to London, get multiple jobs. I don’t need to be an Oxford student. I will send you all that I earn. Every penny.”
“Do you know who that was?” Miss Weasley sounded astonished.
He cracked open the book and began to read. He had a lovely voice, his accent the accent of the elite. God had chosen him to be the Duke of Malfoy.
Draco kissed his cheek sweetly. Emotion whirled inside him. He wanted to pull Potter into his arms, protect him. Potter deserved all the affection and pleasure.
Harry’s head swam. How in the world would he manage to earn
The man flushed. “Yes, right. I’m—you startled me, Your Grace.”
“I do have deadlines.” Harry sighed. He was tired of trying to make sense of it. “Yes, all right. Please write to Professor Weasley. It would be helpful to have someone else back up my story.”
“In my defence, I had no idea who he was when I did it.”
“Thank you.” Potter’s head was still down.
Another shrug. “I could die during childbirth. My body wasn’t made for it. I told them I didn’t care … my life is worthless now, isn’t it? But my baby’s … my baby has something to live for.”
“Why not?”
“I can’t—I refuse. I will not ruin you. You deserve respect and acclaim. You deserve a wife and children. All I can do for you is to make your life harder.”
Harry gazed into the fog, trying to spot the duke.
he wanted to yell, but he had momentarily lost the ability to speak.
Draco and Goyle walked into the room. Potter was propped up in bed, looking better. The last time Draco had seen him his eyes had been glazed over from his fever. He appeared more aware of himself.
Harry worked down to his shoulders. “You’re so stiff.”
Weasley nodded. “Yes. I’m sure you have felt it.”
“Um.” Harry gulped. “I need a moment.”
, Draco thought.
“No,” Harry said, voice breaking. “You must leave me alone.”
“What does that mean?”
“Okay.” Sweat spilled down Harry’s face. He got to his feet unsteadily. He took a deep breath and focused on his magic. He couldn’t fuck this up.
“It’s been a while,” Harry said, nervous but desperate.
Lady Greengrass placed a delicate hand on his shoulder. “Your Grace? Is everything all right?”
“What about Lady Parkinson?” Ginny said.
“I want you to know that I’m not here out of gratitude. I’m here because I want you; I’ve wanted you since the moment I laid eyes on you.”
Malfoy’s eyes flashed. “Yes.”
“I would like your permission to do so.”
Malfoy clutched the counter and closed his eyes. “Mm, lavender,” he said.
“Prepare two horses for us,” Draco ordered cheerfully. He caught the flash of fear on Potter’s face. How he wished they could share a horse again, but it just couldn’t be done. “Potter here isn’t so great leading a steed—give him a dependable one, Watkins.”
“Yuck,” Potter said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “Dog breath.”
Next to him, Miss Weasley snorted. “I don’t believe anything my brother does is that urgent. He’s a professor, after all.”
But he had to make haste to the nearest village. Their carriage had passed many on the way to Malfoy’s castle.
A little while later, they were seated in the visitor gallery in the House of Lords. Harry spotted Draco on the floor, looking immaculate. Harry removed his handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his forehead. His heartbeat was thunderous.
bad at this,” she said.
, Harry thought secretly. The duke looked untouchable, perfect; he looked as if he were a statue come to life. He was one of the most powerful men in the country, surrounded by other very powerful men, and Harry
“Playing?”
It wasn’t easy to remake an old room into a nursery. They had to call in dark magic experts to make sure nothing dangerous lurked in the curtains, under the carpet. They discovered the wallpaper in the room had magical spells that could harm a small child. (“Nothing too dangerous,” the experts had said. “But the spells might make the baby go blind.”) They then of course had to strip off all the wallpaper and figure out any and all counter spells. This all took time, and meanwhile Harry and Draco couldn’t come to an agreement about the nursery’s décor.
Harry fucked him harder and harder, the bed hitting the wall, disturbing some dust on the ceiling. Merlin, Draco hated this house.
, Draco thought. For weeks Potter had been staring at him whenever he came in for lunch.
“Those lovely people back there—it was as if they were your peasants, your …
“Here, make yourself useful,” Malfoy said, and handed Harry a strange looking metal tool.
Draco moaned again. “Perhaps I want to be ruined.”
Potter gulped again. His gaze was dark, unreadable. He pulled down his underpants, revealing his cock. Draco felt his eyes go wide.
Not for the first time, Draco wished he had a photograph of Harry. He shared a look with Goyle, and Goyle shrugged.
Incensed, Draco growled. Potter put his hand on his shoulder, petting him again. He closed his eyes and started to drift off.
Malfoy took his time sliding off Harry’s gown. Harry wore no underpants, and his cock now hung heavy between his legs.
There was something strange about Trelawney’s eyes. They were vacant, milked over. Her mouth hung open. “I need to speak to you,” she said distantly.
