“Well, I’m not too much of a goody goody for a shag, if you’re up for it?” Harry said lowly, trailing his mouth down Draco’s neck to press kisses against his sensitive skin. “The demon might kill us later, so it could be our last chance.”
Draco couldn’t possibly imagine dating someone through bonding over an ex, but Blaise had never had any decorum, and Potter wasn’t exactly normal when it came to the social scene. It wasn’t his fault though, really; having friends like Granger and Weasley wouldn’t have been any help to Potter when it came to knowing what was strange and what wasn’t.
Harry smiled, a dazzlingly bright smile which warmed Draco’s heart. “What do you want to do now? We could get drunk so we survive the rest of this terrible party? Or we could escape back to mine if you want? It’s not a one-night-stand if we have a date planned for afterwards.”
Potter shook his head. “Nah, Hermione’s. She thinks what I’m doing is ridiculous, but she still insisted on packing for me so that I could do my stupid job to the best of my ability.”
“You’ve been dragged on Pansy and Ginevra’s holiday, too, I gather?” Draco said as way of greeting.
Draco shook his head. “I’m good. Thank you,” he added, almost as an afterthought.
“That depends on whether you came up with the spell yourself, or if Granger did,” Draco said with a wry grin.
When the song ended, Harry couldn’t take it anymore and made his excuses to Francesco before returning to his table. Watching Draco just hurt too much.
Draco hesitated for a moment. “No, keep it; it looks good on you. Now shut up or you’re out of here.”
Nausea bubbled in Harry’s stomach, and he couldn’t face eating his breakfast. It didn’t even smell delicious like it usually did, and Harry just pushed his fruit around his plate with his fork to make it look like he was at least trying to eat.
Draco’s cock was more beautiful than Harry could have ever imagined. It was easily at least 10 inches long, and tantalisingly thick. The head of it was a hot pink shade, the slit already shining with pearly fluid. Harry’s tongue darted out to lick at the wetness, savouring the salty taste.
“Go right ahead,” Draco answered, leaning back against the sofa, propping his head up on the arm so he could see what Harry was doing. He hooked his hands at the back of his neck, trying not to look smug as Harry frantically tugged Draco’s trousers and briefs out of the way.
Harry looked up to see Pansy reclining against the wall, wearing a skin-tight dress that barely covered her thighs. Her high heeled shoes made her legs seem like they went on for miles. She looked good, and Harry hated that Draco was going to see her like that. It made no sense, as Harry was pretty sure that Draco was entirely gay, but jealousy knew no logic.
Harry jumped violently at the sound of his name, accidentally creating a large spot of yellow on his canvas.
“Maybe later,” Draco said, waving a hand dismissively. “I’m getting to a good part of my book.”
“I didn’t need your permission to leave early,” Draco snapped. “By the way, your shop smells like shit.”
"There must be something blocking the connection on the other side," he said, lips twisting into a frown. "Ava William! Can you hear us at all?"
Draco lay on his side, stroking Harry's hair as he watched him sleep.
“I doubt that very much,” Draco scoffed, but he dragged himself out of bed regardless.
Harry groaned, trusting Draco would go through his threat if Harry spoke. He pressed his forehead against the cool wood of the closet, unsure of why obeying Draco felt so damn
It wasn’t a question. Harry beamed.
“We’ve been trying to find you a job, you massive prick,” Pansy said. “You know I love you, darling, but you’ve done nothing but mope in self-pity this last month, and look at the state of you! You need a job, and it’s either this or try and find your way in the Muggle world. I’m not going to let you sit wasting away for another month.”
“That’s a good lad,” Draco said, gracefully taking a seat in Harry’s previous spot, and looking rather smug about it. “I think I might like you, Harry, and I don’t tell people things like that lightly. Now get away from my tree, before I change my mind.”
Draco pulled his fingers from Harry’s hole and positioned himself between Harry’s legs. He poured so much lube on his cock that it dripped down onto Harry’s thighs and the bed, but it meant that Draco was able to slide in easily. It still burned, but the slickness and Draco’s slow pace truly helped.
“Canoodling, hmm?” Harry grinned. “How very dare they.”
“I can’t even begin to imagine how he got that to work, it must have taken a lot of preparation and forethought.” Hermione’s tone was almost admiring, before she realized how she sounded and blushed. “In any case, it was not Draco’s doing, he just happened to be the trigger.” She frowned. “It seems that he did set off a misuse of magic alert somehow, but he won’t share what spell he tried to use.”
Harry shook his head slowly. “It doesn’t have to be in the presence of a threat, although I did learn it quickly that way myself when I got attacked by that boggart and Dementors in third year. When I taught it to my schoolmates in Dumbledore’s Army, most of them were in a safe place and didn’t have trouble with learning it, at least with wands.”
Ginny shrugged, but Draco could tell she was a little bit impressed. “Let me guess, is it a long-haired Persian? Or perhaps a peacock?” She gave her drink a quick stir before sipping. “Never mind, I don’t need to know what freaky spell games you get up to when you’re alone together.”
Hermione did not react in any way that he’d dreaded. Instead of showing shock or concern, or – Helga forbid – disgust, she clapped her hands together and uttered a soft shriek. “Harry! I knew it would happen, I knew it!”
He had to think about it for a bit before coming up with a reply. “Well, I suppose they would have to find someone else to leave their fortune to. Someone more deserving.”
“Yeah, Hermione?”
? It doesn’t make any sense.” She brought both hands up to bury them in her hair. “And what about Feruza, or Malfoy? Or anyone else who’s still there, at the mercy of that lunatic?” She began to walk, making long strides down the sidewalk while Harry jogged to catch up. “We have to go back, I don’t want to leave them alone any longer than we already have.”
, he thought to himself, shaking his head.
Harry resumed walking, his face thoughtful. “No, I suppose you’re right, I just wasn’t prepared for you to be so, well,
Draco stared at him. “You’re not just talking about the museum, are you?”
The roar of the crowd had changed to screams of shock and growing anger, and by time Harry reached her, Ginny was clearly angry as well. “Just what the fuck do you think you’re doing?” she had time to yell at the stranger, whose hand had fallen to one side, before plunging into a robed pocket and drawing out an object that was chilling in its incongruency.
He nodded. “All right, Hermione. Don’t be long.”
Harry agreed eventually, on the condition that absolutely no invasive questions be asked about Harry’s past, and that no alcohol be served. “That’s just fine, I think Nigel’s been fixing to jump on the wagon anyway. This’ll give him a proper excuse.”
They left Draco’s house and sought a quiet place in the park down the street where they might take off without being noticed. This proved to be more difficult than they thought, but they finally came upon a stand of trees that were tall enough to mask the first moments of flight.
Ginny waved them both off and Disapparated quietly when none of the passersby were looking. Harry and Draco decided to call a taxi rather than attempt to take the Tube, which was probably filling up with Friday night merrymakers by then.
Harry was about to launch into the story of Mrs. Weasley’s endless knitting when Draco entered the room, hoisting a large platter of finger foods that included a plate each of shrimp and oysters. “I went with a seafood theme tonight, hope that’s all right for you both.”
“I always love to make a statement. As long as I can wear Gaultier and say fuck you very much to anyone who objects.”
Harry was surprised to receive an invitation from the Malfoys. After much deliberation, he decided that he would go. Not just because it was a chance to see Draco, although he suspected that he would, but because he was curious as to their motives in inviting him. He suspected that it was just another way his parents had of solidifying their return to power, but after hearing about what Draco had been up to for the past year and a half, he wondered.
“In here, Potter.” Malfoy was outlined against the sunshine pouring into the kitchen, and Harry felt himself heating up a little around the collar as he backed out of the doorway and fumbled off his shoes before joining Malfoy in the kitchen.
, Harry thought. “No, Hermione, I’m not seeing anyone dangerous. What does that even mean?” He shook his head quickly. “Never mind, don’t answer that. The thing I’m trying to say is – that – well, that I’m seeing a him. A man.”
“No, it’s not like that, Harry. The thing is, we couldn’t see how you could move on from someone like Ginny without wanting to try something completely different. Someone more under the radar. Not that there’s anything wrong with being over the radar about it! I’m sorry Harry, this is coming out all wrong.” She stopped herself and took a deep breath. “What I’m trying to say is, whether you want to express yourself as gay, or bisexual, or any other identity, we’re on your side.”
Once that was over with, Draco insisted that they talk to Ginny about where to find the best publicity consultant for help with interviewing. She knew just the Witch for the job, although Harry could have done without the excessive fawning that the consultant did over him when they first met, while looking at Draco like something she had found crawling under a log. “Tell me, gentlemen,” she started when they had settled into Draco’s den. “What do you most want to reveal to the public about your relationship?”
She stopped walking and didn’t shake off his arm this time. Her eyes were frantic as she looked at him through the lamplit gloom of the street. “It’s not what you did, it’s just – you don’t know what it’s been like, ever since I started going with Fer.” She took a deep shuddering breath. “The diehard fans, they – some of them are all right with it, but some of them really aren’t.”
“Will you be all right, Harry?”
Friday night, with Harry tucked into bed and a Draught of Peace down him, Draco bit the bullet and spelled Hermione through his fireplace in the den. She answered in a distracted sort of way, looking over her shoulder at a scene that was unfolding out of sight. “Sorry Draco, let me get to a place that’s more quiet.” She walked through a dark hallway and Lumosed the light on with a sigh. “That’s better.”
Draco swallowed, then hated himself for the vulnerability of the gesture. “What do you propose, that we fly over London? That’s a bit risky, isn’t it?”
Dudley grinned. “I know, right? He’s such a goody-goody, and you can’t even resent him for it, otherwise
The view of the Italian countryside outside of the window was a vast sight different to England. Grey cities and flat greenery were gone, replaced with rolling hills and terracotta towns. The sun was shining brightly, bathing the wing of the plane in orange light.
Once they were far enough out, Harry stopped the charm on the oars, bringing them to a stop. He opened up a small bag, and brought out a large box which could only have fit inside the bag through the use of magic.
“Hardly,” Draco said, harsher than he intended to sound. “In fact, I was just thinking that they’re quite the odd match; both of them could do far better.”
“Potter!”
Harry nodded and reached for his wallet. He opened it, and allowed the long line of photos of Teddy to uncurl. “He’s my godson. He’s four now, named Edward but never call him that; he’s Teddy. He’s a Metamorphmagus but as he’s young he can’t control it yet, so usually his hair and eye colour will change at least ten times while you visit him.”
The silver in Harry’s eyes flashed brighter than ever.e He surged forwards and captured Draco’s lips in a bruising kiss. Draco could almost taste the repressed hunger in Harry’s mouth, like the sweetest thing. He wrapped his arms around Harry to pull him closer, determined to chase away the last part of Harry’s conscience fighting against the potion.
dating a Slytherin, along  with his sister.”
Draco raised the camera. He was ready, but not expecting to capture any of the footage that Potter was so eager to find. The loch was peaceful, though, and at least he could have a pleasant afternoon out on the water.
Draco went tense beside Harry, and scuffed his hiking boots into the dust. “I don’t see why she’d want me in her house, given everything that happened with…”
“You’re joking, right? You really want me to move?”
Harry felt his eyes widen. “Is there alcohol in that?!”
, in a way, like Draco was really
“If you think this is raunchy, Draco, then you’re more of a traditionalist than I thought. Pansy, may I borrow you for a moment? I know a girl you
Draco grinned darkly. “Better make it a big flask.”
Harry hated them. He knew the irony, being a tourist himself, but the crowds and the queues at every tourist attraction they’d visited so far had been nothing like Harry had ever known before.
The Dark Mark on his arm was no longer black, faded to a pale pink following the death of the Dark Lord, but the Mark still felt like a blazing brand on his arm. He was found innocent in the courtroom, largely due to his age, and partially because he lied about Harry Potter’s identity to save him from the Dark Lord. With the mark of the Death Eater still on him, he was forever ostracised.
Which was how he found himself sitting with Pansy and Astoria doing a jigsaw puzzle, feeling as bored as Pansy looked. Astoria loved her Muggle hobbies, and Pansy was incredibly smitten and went along even though she hated them.
"Sounds acceptable," Draco said with a smirk. He slid a slip of paper over the counter towards Harry. "My phone number. I look forward to hearing from you."
“I’ll call for Luna,” the man continued. “Take a seat.”
"You could finger me forever. But I want your cock too, please, Draco..."
“That sounds entirely implausible, and here’s why,” Draco began, before diving into his rant.
He smiled, but his smile quickly faded when he realised he’d only get to spend a few more days left to experience things like this.
And just like the students at Durmstrang, the kids at Hogwarts really seemed to be enjoying their classes. Harry had never been much of a studious academic himself, so his lessons tended to be practical based, with theory filtered through so nobody—including him—would have to sit through tedious lectures.
"Well we're going to get you out of here first," Malfoy said, clapping a strong hand on Harry's shoulder. "And then we're going to get you the help you need."
Harry was thrown into an immediate mixture of turned on, and annoyed.
The man was large, though the way his arms bulged under his t-shirt suggested it was almost all muscle. He had a neatly cut head of blond hair, and his watery blue eyes narrowed at the sight of Draco.
“What?” Draco said, noticing Harry smiling at him like a lovestruck fool.
Draco hated that he knew what UFOs were now, thanks to Harry.
They would find Ava no matter what it took, even if they irritated one another to death in the process.
The man was tall and slender, but clearly well-muscled, had an absolutely flawless dark complexion, and was wearing clothes that even Harry could tell were expensive and stylish.
“Well one thing’s for sure, you’re certainly not ordinary,” Draco muttered, wondering why he was attracted to Potter despite all the crazy. In fact, Potter’s dedication to his eccentric beliefs only turned Draco on in ways he couldn’t begin to explain to himself. Sure, it was an irritated, tired arousal, but it was arousal nonetheless.
Harry generally preferred manual preparation over magical, because the spell tended to work
He knew for certain now that Dudley knew exactly what he was doing with these hotel bookings.
Harry didn’t move from the floor for a long time.
Ava shook her head again. "Don't worry about me, Professor, I'm fine." She smiled a smile which didn't reach her eyes. "Am I free to go? I want to study before my next class."
“Will you come downstairs, Draco?” Astoria asked. “Living up here in the dark moping is doing no good for you.”
Thunder rumbled in the distance, and Harry smiled; he’d always loved a good storm. His pages fluttered in the wind, and Harry smoothed them down absently.
Harry had never been so pleased to see the orange glow of lights coming from a shop window.
“Do you think I could invent my own spell?” Harry retorted with a grin of his own. “Hermione’s brilliant, but she refuses to work in the Department of Mysteries because she thinks it’s corrupt. She’s probably not wrong. I think Kingsley Shacklebolt is the best Minister we’ve had, but there are too many bad seeds in all parts of the Ministry even now. That’s part of the reason I quit Auror training.”
. And trust me, if Dudley can open himself up to these new experiences, then anyone can.”
Harry raised an invisible glass. “Cheers.”
“I’m fine,” Draco said a little too quickly. He cleared his throat and took a steady breath, hoping to summon the courage he usually left deep down inside himself. “I wanted to talk to you about something, actually.”
He placed a hand on Draco’s chest, sliding it down slowly until it reached the waistband of his trousers. Draco moved his hand over Harry’s, guiding it underneath his clothing. He groaned when Harry wrapped his fingers around his cock, breaking their kiss.
"Hello, Harry, I was wondering when you'd come to say hello."
“Really? I mean, I know I’m not brilliant. It’s more therapy than anything, and-”
It wasn't quite the same as Auror work, but apparently the Ministry looked down on 'needless acts of heroics' and 'mouthing off the government'. Still, Harry really thrived on helping students achieve their best, and supporting them to push through to levels they didn't think they could reach.
"I swear I'm going to make it so good for you, Harry. Take your clothes off."
Harry rolled his eyes, but Draco could tell that it was affectionate. “Fine, but only if there’s definitely no demon here. But I’m very, very certain that there is. Are you ready to go in and find out?”
Harry ignored him in favour of walking towards the lot with a sniggering Ginny and Pansy.
“You can’t tell me you actually think these Muggle creatures exist?” Draco asked. Potter had his flaws—many, many flaws to be precise—but Draco had never considered him a fool. Perhaps spending too much time with Luna and Dumbledore over the years had rubbed off on him.
Harry rolled his eyes so hard that Draco wouldn’t have been surprised if he’d hurt himself.
Like Luna and Dudley, they were both utterly delighted and insisted on fussing over Harry like he was a pretty new doll for them to play with.
The road to the village was a pretty one with smooth, unlined concrete bordered by large oak trees and patches of flowers. The air smelled sweet with the flora, and the breeze made the leaves in the trees bristle gently. It was peaceful, and warm, and Harry felt so much more free than when he cycled to work down the hectic streets of Little Whinging.
Harry sighed and nodded. His uncle had threatened Harry numerous times about behaving, and though he thought it might be fun to ruin his uncle’s chances, Harry didn’t much fancy dealing with the wrath that would be aimed his way as a result.
“Er, Dudley has been known to struggle with tasks quite often,” Harry said quietly. “I don’t much fancy talking to that woman again, and we managed to share that bed in Puerto Rico and survive. Shall we just do the same here?”
“Of course. She goes by Dawney, short for Dawnflight, although it’s probably not the most appropriate of names. I never fly her in the morning these days. Didn’t you ever name your brooms?”
Harry’s answer brought everyone up short. “I don’t expect you to understand, any more than you understand my desire to step away from being a Wizard. All I ask is that you respect my choices, and that you respect Draco as one of them. Besides, you’ll see that he’s changed, if you just give him a chance.” He smiled into his glass. “He’s a downright fluffy kitten compared to the Malfoy we all knew from Hogwarts.”
She flinched a little at the news, but took it surprisingly in stride, considering Hermione’s reaction. “For fuck’s sake, Harry, I don’t have time for your identity crisis right now. What about your ear, did he have something to do with that?” She pushed her way into the flat, removing an expensive-looking shearling coat as she did so.
They were spared answering by the band striking up a boisterous tune that invited dancing. “Come on, Harry, let’s go mingle a little.” Draco was only too glad to lead him away from Ginny, who was looking Draco up and down like she wanted to eat him alive, or at least nibble on a few choice bits. If Draco hadn’t been so fully settled into his gay identity, and if she wasn’t a Weasley, he might have been interested.
Harry watched, delighted, as the Patronus circled back around in front of them and hovered at chest height. “Look,” he breathed, “you were right about your dream.”
Draco squinted into the distance, considering. “More like a museum curator. Or a magical archivist.”
Her question, while predictable, still made him hesitate. “Do you believe in magic?”
“Look, Draco…” His voice trailed away at the enormity of their situation. He leaned forward, took Draco’s hands in his, and started again. “I really appreciate how deeply you’ve come to care for me. I feel the same, but.” He swallowed. “If we’re going to do this, if we’re going to show the world that not just unity, but a caring connection is possible between former enemies, I need to know that we’re doing it for everyone, and not just for us. I learned the hard way with Ginny that making selfish decisions as a public figure only ends up backfiring on the people you love.”
The kiss ended with Harry’s knees considerably less reliable than before. “Well, if you would rather go out, I can think of a few pubs that have some fun things to do. Muggle games, and not video. Just old-fashioned board games, and cribbage, and the like.”
Harry, on the other hand, seemed determined to tune them out. “Draco, I’m not sure this is a good idea. I tried Z once, and I don’t think it ended well.” He thought for a moment. “Honestly, I don’t even remember how it ended, which is even worse.” His hand tightened around Draco’s, and Draco kissed it the way he liked it, with just a little bite to the knuckle. “Don’t worry, Harry, we’re not going to force you to do anything you don’t want to. But I’m curious to find out how Z affects me - don’t you want to find out too?” He gestured toward the women with his free hand. “Not to mention what it does for these two?”
Major kudos to the lovely Kbrick for being my beta on this chapter. As my first stab at writing an explicit scene, it needed some extra love, hence the long wait between postings. Check out Kbrick's works if you haven’t already, they're chock-full of Drarry deliciousness!
Draco acquiesced and put the wand aside in a drawer next to his bed. He was more interested in finding out what Harry had in store for him than he was willing to let on, but for now he would let it go.
Harry and Draco go on a date. Contains explicit sexual activity, mixed with magic. Some light is shed on Draco’s past. Harry gets to cook again.
“Of course I’m okay with it. I kissed you first, after all.” And he leaned in toward Harry as if to say, “I’ll do it again if you want.”
big part. He’s really, you know, charming. And kind, and funny in a goofy sort of way, even when he doesn’t mean to be. And he doesn’t usually demand too much of me, if he does get a bit jealous sometimes.”
Draco chuckled and nudged Nigel conspiratorially, then turned to Harry with a serious face. “No really, Harry, it’s far too form-fitting and the cut is all wrong, although the color does match your complexion nicely.”
In a mad impulse, Harry held out his free hand to fill the space between them. “Hello.” Their hands met and grasped after the briefest of hesitations. “I’m Harry, what’s your name?”
Draco waved at him, half turned away already to trot down the stairs. Harry was left with a strange aching sensation as he watched Draco leave, then gathered himself and Apparated home.
The words hovered in the air like a charm that had backfired, and the three of them looked at each other with wide eyes, silent. Only seconds later, two sets of those eyes were welling up. Draco had just enough time to register that Harry’s features had crumpled alarmingly before he threw his arms around Draco and began to ugly-cry into his neck. Hermione looked like she would have liked to do something similar, but held back out of respect for Harry’s feelings and merely sniffled while she overflowed in empathy.
“Why do you think he has power over you?”
Emboldened by this plan, he sat down and pulled out a journal that he had abandoned several months ago. A cursory glance at the last few pages he’d written reminded him of a time when his emotional landscape had been mostly occupied by guilt about Ginny and Ron and the rest of the Weasleys. The feelings seemed distant now, but he was still surprised by how quickly they came back to life when he read over what he had written.
As Mysteria went to work on the spot, Draco explained to Harry, “Look, this is going to be the first time that the Wizarding world gets to see us together. How we appear is going to be just as important, if not more, than what we say. The interview doesn’t get published until what, six o’clock tonight? We’ll be inside the Ministry by then.”
Draco paused before repeating. He wasn’t familiar with this behavior from Harry, and wondered if a hangover or the painkilling potion had something to do with it. He checked the table next to the couch and only counted three empty phials, which was probably right within range of where Harry needed to be.
Harry looked a bit embarrassed. “Erm, I actually already have a name. Didn’t I tell you?”
With that little exchange, Harry felt something fling itself open in the region of his chest. He was most definitely attracted to men, and not just to Draco. And just as clearly, he knew he wanted to be with Draco in this reality, Godric help him.
Harry’s mind was too far gone on its substance-induced journey to produce more than a light buzz of panic in his body. He wanted to fixate on the sight of Draco, who looked delectable and most definitely available in that moment. Ignoring Feruza’s presence, he stepped into Draco’s arms and landed a sloppy kiss on his ear, sighing as he did so.
The last step was talking to Hermione. Draco balked at the idea at first, but Harry insisted on getting her opinion and any advice she might have about how to approach the interview. She was also their source for invitations, as Harry had been advised against asking for the invitations directly. It would look too attention-seeking to anyone who might be inclined to criticize, said the publicity consultant. Even the Daily Prophet, which had agreed to the requested interview straight away, might not view it in a positive light.
“Can’t we at least wait until after breakfast?” he asked plaintively as they poured past him into the hallway.
Ginny and Feruza sank into a chubby loveseat together, while Harry remained standing and tried to hash out a plan with Luna and Trevor. “Luna, why don’t you go to the ball and track down Kingsley. I’m sure he can tell you who would be the best Auror for the job of finding Ginny and Feruza a safe house to stay in for the night.” Harry avoided mentioning Hermione or Ron, as he did not want to worry them any more than they might already be, but Luna was one step ahead of him and suggested speaking to them anyway, as Kingsley would likely be busy in his role as Minister for Magic. “Not that he wouldn’t want to help you, Harry, but I think he’s going to have his hands full as it is, with all the questions about the attack.”
“Yeah, I know there’s a lot I still don’t know about. One of my co-workers in Auror training tried to explain it to me once, but I tuned him out after the word ‘bunghole’ came up a few too many times.”
Draco shook his hand slowly, looking into Harry’s eyes as if he were memorizing their color, then said, “Draco. Draco Malfoy.” He surprised Harry by leaning in and following up with something extremely familiar. “Don’t want to make friends with the wrong sort, do we? I can help you there.”
Resuming the session, the Chief Warlock began his direct questioning of Draco. “Mr. Malfoy, to what degree were your actions influenced by your recent association with Mr. Potter?”
“May I help you?”
Draco fell forward with the force of his efforts to free himself, and immediately put his arms around Harry, who really shouldn’t have been standing at all. Harry's words came out in a rush  -  “Draco, I’m so sorry it had to happen like this, it was so stupid of me, I really shouldn’t have run off like I did, but we’re going to have to tell Hermione, and possibly Ginny, and I don’t want to have to hide this anymore”  - and he punctuated his run-on sentence with a kiss, which happened to coincide with the moment that Hermione re-entered from the kitchen.
“It’s not the potion, if that’s what you’re thinking.” Harry’s smile was so wide, it was borderline demented. “I’m just naturally this way when I feel like I’m finally on the same page with someone I love.” He ruffled Draco’s hair to emphasize the point, and Draco leaned into it. To hell with perfect hair today, he was just happy to be back on good terms with Harry.
Turning back to Hermione, he blanched at the look he saw in her eyes. He wasn’t even remotely prepared for this situation, to be honest, even though he had wanted to share his secret for weeks. “Hermione – “ he began, “I can explain.”
I wanted to explore multiple themes in this chapter, particularly the idea that although the Great War against Voldemort is over, there are still messed-up people and messed-up things that happen in the world. Even beloved public figures are not immune, in fact they are more vulnerable, in some ways. Using a cursed gun as the catalyst felt like one way to show how Muggle and Wizarding worlds can overlap, with regards to the dark side of fame and power.
Nigel titched, stepped back a little and admired his handiwork. “Any handsome friend of Draco’s deserves a little extra attention. Oh yes, I think we did very well. The green cardigan complements your eyes perfectly.” His gaze swept lower, until he reached Harry’s feet. “Where on earth did you get those socks?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed, and Harry could practically see the gears turning in his mind. Before Draco could go any further down that road of speculation, he filled him in on the Splinching accident and jumped in with some questions of his own.
Lips pursed with amusement or annoyance – Draco couldn’t be sure which – Harry went to the kitchen for his wand and cast a quick Scourgify. “What, you mean the computer?”
Draco obliged. It felt kind of nice, being waited on hand and foot by the Boy Who Lived. Or at least, the Boy Who Had Lived and Now Hid. For the first time, he wondered whether Harry was single.
Harry considered the name without laughing. “Drake. Macavoy.” He looked like he was tasting a wine for the first time. “Son of a Snitch, that’s actually not bad.” He removed his hands from tickling distance and tucked them behind his head, arching back across the pillows. “I have no idea which author you’re referring to though. You’ve probably noticed I’m not a big reader.”
“Nigel Myles-Harkley – you haven’t heard of him? Of course you haven’t, you grew up with middle-class Muggles. His family is one of the newer Wizarding families who made their fortune in magic-assisted Muggle inventions. He went to Beauxbatons and summered in the south of France, which is why you probably never heard about him at Hogwarts.”
Draco turned toward Harry and smiled. “You are a dunce, but you are
with me.”
She flung an incredulous look at him. “You think? Well I’m thinking that they’re crazy, which means they won’t have any problem shooting anyone who gets in their way. I’m Apparating back and putting up a Shield Charm as soon as I get there.”
Harry had his doubts about Muggle scientists being willing to collaborate with Wizards, but he didn’t tell her that. Instead, he agreed to support her when she brought it up, and she thanked him. On her way out the door, Harry had an impulse that he couldn’t control. “Next time you talk to him, tell him I said hello.”
“So is Nigel your – “ Harry began, but Draco cut him off with a hand over his mouth, as he leaned in to press the entire warm length of his body against Harry’s.
Draco was dressed in a set of blood-red robes with embroidered gold flame detailing at the cuffs and hem. Somehow the color contrast made him look both paler and more tan than usual, although perhaps that was more an effect of the subtle bronzer that highlighted his angular features, with traces of glitter. His long hair was artfully arranged like a very sleek version of a lion’s mane, and he had a tiny ruby dangling from one ear.
“Who says I’m going anywhere?” Harry blinked at him, forgetting that he had just been making plans to leave so that he wouldn’t do anything he might regret telling Draco. If they ever spoke to each other again. Merlin’s beard, he missed him. Instead of doing the logical thing and finding a private place to spell Draco or another of his friends, he stood up and grabbed Brandon by the shoulder when he felt the floor sway under him a little. “Never mind, forget I said that. I should go home.”
“If you insist.” Malfoy took another sip of tea. “Harry. Why have you been hiding yourself away?”
Draco nodded. Just when he thought he couldn’t stand any more of this adorable alternate reality version of Harry, he said something silly to top it all off. “You know what this means, right? You’re my biggest F.A.N. – my Former Arch-Nemesis.” Draco didn’t need to see Harry’s face to know that he was grinning at his own joke.
“Hold still, I’m going to put something on your back.” The something turned out to be a cool liquid sensation of dripping – no, painting – across his shoulderblades. What was Draco doing? “I’m writing some runes in oil, runes of protection from disease and pain. And maybe some aphrodisiacs as well.” Draco’s voice had a husky edge to it, and Harry shivered in anticipation.
– In case of what, Harry couldn’t be sure in his scattered frame of mind, but he didn’t want to feel any more alone than he already did.
“Stop squinting, Potter, it’ll make you old before your time.” Draco seemed determined to continue calling him by his surname. He sat down with a sigh.
Draco’s eyes widened in shock. “I’m sorry, did you just insult both me and my family?”
“Of course not! It must feel like such a big deal to share it at first, I can only imagine, and I’m honored that you told me. You don’t need to worry about any judgment from me. Or from any of your Wizarding friends, for that matter.” She looked a little embarrassed. “I probably shouldn’t say anything, but we’ve been speculating for a while that the next person you dated would be male.”
The song was Lou Reed’s “Satellite of Love,” and the tune, while gentle and meandering, lifted him up so that he felt less self-conscious. Harry laughed when Lou sang the line
Harry raised his eyebrows. “If you say so.”
“Great, this is – delightful, actually.”
Thank you Kbrick for the continued support and fine-tuning!
“Interesting.” Harry’s hand continued to stroke Draco’s hair, but his mind had gone elsewhere. Draco grew suddenly restless and sat up, kicking off the covers. He and Harry were still very much naked, but his appetite for fleshly delights had been derailed by the dream. Besides, his stomach was rumbling.
The better part of the week had passed before Draco felt ready to reach out to Harry again. Between shopping and meeting Nigel and talking to his therapist, he felt like he’d had more than his usual quotient of human contact. Plus there had been a sudden uptick in customers at Bedknobs and Broomsticks. It was frightful to see how quickly the Quidditch and Potter-related books were selling, in anticipation of the new film coming out in November, and he wondered if Harry had any idea how much money he could be making off them. But he probably hadn’t, out of Gryffindor nobility or some such rot. Or wanting to stay hidden from the public eye.
But he would not give him the satisfaction.
Harry did not have a response for that, and so they walked in companionable silence the rest of the way to the Tube station before parting.
“Well,
“No Harry, you can stay.” His eyes were still closed, but Harry’s heart flipped a little at the invitation. “As long as you promise not to say anything to anyone about it.” He sniffed and yawned. “I have a reputation to uphold.”
Harry sighed. “It’s easy, I swear. Let me just give you a boost.”
“Yes. I realize that it might look that way.” The tone of his voice was flat as the look in his eyes, but deceptively so, Harry suspected. “Be a bit ironic, wouldn’t it, ending up in Azkaban just like my father.”
only just began to describe the feeling, and he jumped a little when Malfoy answered the door almost immediately.
The thought floated unbidden across his mind, and he frowned at the memories that followed.
“I’m sorry, a what?”
“You fucking prat.” Harry choked out between sobs. “How dare you say it – before me?”
Draco did not know what to make of this, but the Z coursing through his veins didn’t let him stay mired in confusion or sensibility for long. Instead, he beckoned Feruza and said, “What the hell, why don’t you send her over here. It’s not like we’re going to remember everything later anyway, I'll wager.”
Harry couldn’t think of an ear joke to make, so he contented himself with swatting Draco dramatically away. “Back off, Malfoy, and let me drink my poison in peace.” He swallowed the potion with a shudder, as it tasted like death.
Which was how he ended up on a posh street in Notting Hill, lurking across from the townhouse where Malfoy supposedly lived. It looked perfectly ordinary, almost ridiculous in its niceness. Could this really be the dwelling place of his longtime arch-nemesis at school?
Hermione looked flustered. “I can take it, thank you. We can serve it with dinner.” She vanished into the kitchen and did not reappear until Ron’s footsteps sounded on the stairs, at which point she reemerged with an apron on.
After several rounds with both Harry and Nigel, he finally felt the effects start to wear off, and sleepiness overtook him. Harry was barely able to cover his own yawns, and Draco eventually stood up, with the intention of ushering him out the door, while Nigel gathered his own things upstairs. The night, and its magic, was almost over, and the prospect of the day ahead was beginning to weigh on Draco.
His gaze had dropped and Draco wanted nothing more than to sweep him up in another hug, but his pride held him in check. Ron’s reacting expression at the sight of them holding hands was almost more than Draco could handle, and he was tempted equally to burst into laughter and punch him. Instead, he looked at him with narrowed eyes and a hint of a smirk around the lips, just to get a further rise out of him. And it was working. Ron appeared to be growing more nauseated by the minute, and Hermione chose that moment to open up a cupboard filled with alcohol. “Drinks, anyone?” she chirruped nervously.
Draco crinkled his nose. “Most museum food is mediocre and hideously overpriced, you know.”
It only amounted to a single tear, but it was still progress for Draco. The last memory he had of crying was during their final year together at Hogwarts, at Dumbledore’s funeral. It would never have occurred to him that the next tear he shed would be in Harry Potter’s arms.
Nor Hermione’s, nor Ron’s, for that matter. The Weasleys were still in shock from first losing Fred, then weathering Ginny’s quick ascent to stardom and George’s phenomenal success with the joke shop, and didn’t really have the bandwidth to quibble with Harry’s decisions, poor as they might be. Hermione had stepped up to fill the gaps in emotional support that both Ron and Harry needed, but given the heavy load of her roles at work and as the founder of S.P.E.W., it had taken its toll. Harry had eventually insisted that they only check in once a week, after Hermione had finished tending to her own needs. By now it felt like second nature, a reliable punctuation to the end of the week.
He raised his glass, shooting a glare at Luna and Dudley who now looked amused. “To our next journey, finding the non-existent Chupacabra.”
Harry swallowed heavily. Draco’s fingers were still wrapped around Harry’s hand, their weight warm and comforting, and neither of them seemed in a hurry to pull apart.
“Yeah, just slept on my leg funny,” Draco said through gritted teeth.
“I’m not talking about
Truth be told, Harry had made great efforts to avoid going to McGonagall's office so that he didn't have to see Dumbledore. Harry had cared deeply for Dumbledore, and knew those feelings were returned, but knowing all the things Dumbledore had hidden from Harry still hurt, even after all these years. Especially because ultimately it didn't matter—Dumbledore's planning had won them the war, and Harry had long forgiven him despite the hurt.
“So this creature which looks like some kind of dog or coyote is attacking livestock, and somehow that’s supernatural and not just a case of rabies or natural animal violence?”
They fell silent, standing impossibly still so that the floodboards wouldn’t creak beneath their feet. Sure enough, angry voices were talking downstairs, the volume of their speech suggesting they had no idea two Aurors were currently upstairs.
“Turn around for me, there’s a good boy,” Draco commanded, and Harry eagerly complied. There was something about that tone of voice that would have had Harry doing anything Draco asked of him.
Harry shrugged. “Nothing wrong with having household skills. Were your parents prepared after I lost them Dobby, or did they have a small army of house-elves ready to take his place?”
“I’m not sulking, I’m just--do you hear something?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Don’t be so melodramatic, darling.”
“And I suppose even a poltergeist would put you off fucking?”
“So Muggles have their own versions of elves?” Astoria asked. “Humanoid ones who don’t do housework?”
Draco nodded. “Most likely, though there’d be semi-naked men dancing in the rain, too.”
meet; she’s exactly your type, and very single. Keep Harry occupied, won’t you, Draco? I fear all these snakes might devour him if they discover a little lion in their midst.”
Loch Ness was stunningly beautiful, Draco had to admit. Deep blue water stretched out wide in front of them, surrounded by lush green hills and mountains. It reminded him of being back at Hogwarts, relaxing by the Black Lake with his friends during happier days.
Thankfully the owner of the voice—Malfoy—hadn't noticed, because he was too busy glaring at a sullen looking Ava William.
“I suppose rabid coyotes may also be attracted to Gertrude, but fingers crossed we’ll catch a Chupacabra instead,” Harry said, allowing Gertrude to trot off a fair distance away from them. Harry’s fist remained outstretched, attached to the invisible lead. “You don’t always have to be such a skeptic, you know.”
you do.” Ginny smirked, a clear sign she’d been spending too much time with Slytherins.
Dudley clapped Draco on the shoulder as he left, leaving his departed seat beside Harry invitingly open.
“I wasn’t worried, and who the fuck is Abe?” Draco raised his other brow. “And if you’re both so concerned about goat safety, why have you had Gertrude stuffed in that briefcase all this time?”
“I understand,” Draco said. “They’re great as parents, but Merlin-awful excuses for human beings. My mother and father are both overseas to avoid being jailed, so I’m sure that tells you everything you need to know about them.”
“Work gets in the way.” Draco shrugged. “To be honest, work gets in the way of absolutely everything.”
"No, sorry, Headmistress," Harry mumbled under his breath, feeling like an eleven-year-old rather than the twenty-eight-year-old he actually was. Once McGonagall had leaned back in her own seat, Harry turned back to Malfoy and lowered his voice. "That was your fault!"
Still, when he tasted the crisp, light wine--which held hints of peach, after Draco pressed him on the flavour profile--he had to admit that it tasted amazing alongside the creamy pasta dish. They complemented each other perfectly.
The villa had yellow walls, and an orange tiled roof. The windows looked wide and had wooden shutters, and looked out--from the front of the villa--onto a pebbled courtyard and large water fountain. The sound of flowing water and chirping crickets made Harry feel a world away from home.
The static noise continued, the sound of Muggle radio far more obnoxious than the Wizarding Wireless.
"Not after curfew," Draco growled back. "Given Professor Potter's surprise, I can't imagine you're here with his permission, either."
“That was...wow. I think you might have just fucked me into oblivion and back,” Harry said blissfully.
"A little pain, but then a
“You should meet my grandmother. She has so much upper body strength, and all of it was gained through the kitchen. I don’t use a machine to roll my pasta--I do it the way my grandmother taught me, which is with a rolling pin; that’s more use of your arms.”
“My father has a cellar full of the most expensive wines you can imagine, and they’re what he likes to bring out to impress people. By offering your uncle brandy, he’s essentially just playing with him like a cat plays with a mouse.”
“I wouldn't ever do anything like that,” Harry said sincerely.
Draco pretended to consider the question. “Well, as a much-hated member of society, I’m sure you know I have a massive social circle and calendar.” He rolled his eyes. “Yes, I am sadly free tonight which means I can join you. What exactly are you celebrating, though? You didn’t find the Loch Ness Monster.”
“I really do,” Harry said with a smile, coming up to the counter. “What are you making?”
Harry jumped, spinning round guiltily to face Malfoy. He'd never told Malfoy about the Mirror of Erised, or that he was going to be looking at it himself.
“What others deem late, you deem on time, so who’s to say?” Draco said, masking his voice to hide his glee at finally getting Harry inside his metaphorical net. “Would you care for a glass of wine?”
“Yes, it appears we have quite a lot in common,” Draco said, as Potter took the seat beside him. The cramped seating area meant that Potter’s thigh brushed against Draco’s, and it almost seemed like Potter was pressing harder purposefully.
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut as Draco swiped his thumb over Harry’s slit.
“Among other things,” Draco responded, his smirk growing.
He whined when Draco’s tongue left him, his forehead dropping to the cool wood of the desk when he felt a slick finger pressing against him. The rimming had left Harry nice and relaxed, and Draco easily pushed the first finger into him, quickly followed by another. Draco’s fingers were long and slender, and somehow Draco knew just the right way to crook them so that they stroked Harry’s prostate, drawing a long moan from him.
. His cock was positively throbbing with need. He reached a hand towards it, but Draco slapped it away.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat again. “You want to travel with me again?”
The bones, it turned out, were a lot more impressive than Harry expected them to be, although he’d never admit that to Draco.
“I can have the money tomorrow,” Draco said quickly, but they both knew it was a lie.
Draco looked back down, only to see Harry still staring at him. “Don’t miss out, Potter.”
Lucius snapped his fingers, and a butler Harry hadn’t previously noticed came forwards. The butler was dressed impeccably, in a black suit with a bow tie and white gloves, but under his trousers Harry could just see a hint of mismatched socks, one bright green and the other a vibrant orange.
Draco never shared his food as a rule. If people wanted what he had, then they needed to get their own. Yet, here he was, offering Potter his haggis— even when it was rare to find on menus unless you were out in Scotland.
The walls were cream and the furnishings grey, which would have been respectable choices on their own. Potter had ruined it though, by having numerous paintings and drawings of mythical creatures on his walls, along with newspaper clippings which had red pen marks underlining and circling words, as well as providing commentary.
“So, if you want to fuck I won’t mind if you skip out on my party early,” Blaise continued, the his delight at the situation obvious in his tone.
They had gone for a hike up Mount Vesuvius, and Pansy--who was a self-declared exercise-phobe--had underestimated just how much work went into a walk up a volcano.  Harry and Draco had bypassed Pansy by a small distance almost immediately, while Ginny, who was easily the fittest of all of them, had given up on her girlfriend and stormed ahead of them all.
Draco wasn’t going to lower himself to sitting on a bean bag, so he remained standing, watching the fake mechanical birds fluttering about the tree branches until Luna appeared. She was clad in a pair of dungarees which were splattered in paint, and the t-shirt she wore underneath was a shocking shade of sunshine yellow.
Even with all the fingering, Harry still felt the pleasant burn as Draco pushed into him, and he eyes fell shut as pleasure coursed through him at the sensation of feeling utterly full.
“I can’t sleep; I’m too warm,” Harry lied. “I’ve been watching the stars.”
“You don’t have a love bite,” she finally managed to say. “I just wanted to see how you’d react. So you and Draco have become a thing, at last, have you?”
Their hands were so close that they were almost touching, with nothing but water between them. Harry’s fingers twitched, longing to take Draco’s hand in his own.
Harry’s gaze darted to Draco again, and then back to the man. Francesco was indeed very attractive, and maybe dancing with him would catch Draco’s attention. Harry thought it would be even better if he could make Draco jealous by dancing with another man.
“That was-” Draco began.
Harry flushed again. “Right. I’ll do that.”
“Harry?” Pansy interrupted, raising an elegant brow. Draco cursed himself for slipping up in front of them.
It was hard to tell when he wore clothes, but Harry had an incredibly fit body. He wasn’t bulky with muscles, or ripped, as he’d heard Pansy refer to people before, but his stomach and chest were flat and toned, with a narrow dip near his hip bones that Draco couldn’t stop thinking about running his tongue over.
Draco was pleased to notice a slight blush to Potter’s cheeks.
He fell silent as Malfoy pressed a finger against his lips. “Kiss me then,” he said simply. “If it feels right, then you can thank me for helping you by going on a date with me. If it feels wrong, then I’ll let you go with no hard feelings and we can pretend I never asked you out in the first place.”
“Never?” Draco couldn’t believe his ears. “You can’t be serious.”
“What would you like to be called then? Harry, are you even aware of the giant franchise that Muggles have been building upon your name? Some woman claimed the credit for coming up with your story, and frankly, I don’t know how you can stand for it.”
Where he did have conversation to offer, was on flying. Nigel wanted to hear all about his glory days of playing for Gryffindor, and Harry passed a very pleasant half hour reminiscing about it. He tried to be sensitive toward Draco and skimmed over the parts where he had beaten Slytherin, and he thought Draco might have noticed. He certainly had grown less guarded toward Harry, laughing much more easily at Harry’s tales and looking him over every now and then with an unaccustomed smile hovering around his lips. Harry could feel a growing desire to hear that laugh, and his mind couldn’t help wandering back to another, more vulnerable scene that he had witnessed earlier. The curiosity had come back with a vengeance.
Draco was taken aback by Harry’s criticism, but had a quick retort. “Well you can be a right bell-end too. What about the time when you cast that slashing curse on me? Or when you stole my wand?”
“All right then, you can sit behind me again, no worries.”
“Yeah, actually,” Ginny said. “Feruza is really interested in the Tarot, and I was wondering if you have any books on the subject. Or on cartomancy in general.”
His therapist nodded and took notes. He was rather impressed with her poker face, and wondered for the first time what her private thoughts about him might be.
It was over at last, and they descended back to the park at some unknown hour, with daylight still far from the horizon. Draco sighed, not wanting to come down from the high of close contact with Harry, but it couldn’t be helped. He wondered if Harry felt the same.
There was whispering on the other side of the door, and then Draco opened the door all the way. “All right, we’ve landed on about ten pieces for you to choose from. Try to get at least one item from each group, trousers, shirts, jumpers, accessories, et cetera. Shoes will have to be a separate outing.”
He didn’t dare try to rearrange the neat rows of trousers and shirts, hung according to color and material, choosing instead to shift them from side to side as he searched in the gloom. Grabbing his wand, he Lumosed while poking through militantly aligned ranks of shoes, and Levitated while prodding through stacks of jeans and drawers of socks, to no avail.
And now for a little shameless plugging, since I am apparently still possessed by the impulse to write fanfic. My next story is set during the Marauders era with a little teen Wolfstar thrown in, so we probably won’t be seeing too much of Draco or Harry, but I plan to start posting chapters soon. See you there, if that’s your cuppa!
Harry was beginning to notice that their banter hurt less than it might have in days past. Once upon a time, he would not have been as willing to overlook a slight to his House, but it seemed unimportant now. Was it just part of growing up, or was it a sign of their increasing compatibility?
The chill was frightful, and Harry changed his mind after less than five minutes on the roof. The thought of staying in his flat with only his console for company was even more frightful, however, so he came up with a new plan as he scarfed down some leftover beef stew. There was an arcade he liked to visit near Camden Lock that had some great retro games, including one of his new guilty pleasures,
She was wrong, it stung a lot. Harry bit back groans of pain as she poured, wiped, and cleansed as gently as she could, with gloved hands. “You’re doing great, I’m just going to put the ointment on next, then wrap some gauze and have you keep pressure on it for a little while. It’s not bleeding too badly, we probably won’t need to call a Mediwizard unless you really want to.”
He would try to drown it later, before it drowned him. Family connections, and magic, and money, all these were useful in such times, and he couldn’t help but be grateful for the support that generations of Malfoys had given to him through their hoarding of riches and power. But in his low moments – and there would be many - he had to admit to himself that time would forever be split in his mind: before, and after, the year of Harry Potter.
Draco was finally free, now that Pansy was gone. Harry hadn’t had the courage to approach once he recognized her, as he’d always been a bit intimidated by her in school, and old reactionary habits were hard to let go of when he felt as jumpy as he did. Draco had seen him for sure, although it was impossible to read his face over the distance between them. Drink still in one hand - fortunately booze-free - he walked back into the entrance hall, his stomach a mass of crawling things, and waited for him to descend the staircase.
Draco kissed the top of his head. “Well, whatever the photo, I’m sure you were adorable.”
“It’s called the World Wide Web, Draco. I don’t have the greatest setup, maybe we can go back to your place instead.”
Draco had nothing to say to that, although he was clearly put out. Harry brewed a pot of tea during the conversational gap, thinking that they could both use a cup of something warm to drink. And who knew, tea might melt Draco’s chilly disposition for the moment.
To his therapist’s credit, she took it in stride at their next session and allowed him to abuse several of her couch cushions before suggesting that he try talking about it instead.
He found a compromise by reaching for one of Draco’s hands and holding it beneath the table. “No worries, you definitely have nothing to be sorry about. Although you were responsible for some of my sleeplessness.” His smile was sheepish, and Draco seemed to know what he was referring to because he squeezed Harry’s hand and smiled back, with just a hint of lust.
Hermione rushed back into the room waving a piece of paper that turned out to be a crudely drawn map of London that she had made herself. “I think it’s in Camden Town, off this small park,” she explained breathlessly. “I can escort you there if you need help finding it.”
, but Draco settled back in his chair and closed his eyes for a moment, resting his fingers on his temples.
“Come on in, and take off your shoes,” he drawled. Apparently the debauchery of the night before was forgotten, and Malfoy was dressed as crisply as a man could be in designer loungewear, hair arranged just so. He flicked on a light overhead with nothing but a spoken “Lumos,” and Harry couldn’t help asking about it. “Malfoy, aren’t you prohibited from doing most magic now? Like the tea, last night – how was that possible?”
Ron willingly launched into a new round of anecdotes, punctuated by Harry’s commentary and occasional sniggers when Ron got a little too excited with his gesturing. Watching them together, Draco felt envious of their camaraderie.
The gesture did little to disrupt the tension in the room, but at least it broke the staring contest that had been building up between Draco and Ron. Ron helped Hermione with bringing out glasses and bottles of various amber liquids, and Draco was relieved to see that several passable varieties of Scotch were represented. He accepted the offer of a Glenfidditch, while Harry declined in favor of sparkling water, and soon all of them were sipping in a concerted effort to mellow out their nerves.
Draco shrugged and leaned against one side of the doorway. “They all distanced themselves from me when the Dark Lord fell. Some of them even earlier, when they saw how far I had gone into the Dark Arts.” He smiled bitterly. “They are Slytherins after all, and what do we do when confronted with disgrace? We slither away, as quickly and quietly as possible.”
Harry shrugged. “I dunno. It passes the time, I guess. And it’s a nice break from magic.”
“Not particularly. Why, what’s yours, a giant water buffalo?”
Harry squared himself off in preparation. “Hold on tight, I’m going to Apparate us first.”
“What’s your Patronus?”
Turning back to Harry, who was still deeply engaged in talking with Luna, Draco felt compelled to nudge him. “Sorry to interrupt, but look who’s here.”
“Well, not so for mine. As far as I can tell, my dad had the same messy hair. Maybe my mum’s was nicer, kind of like Ginny’s.”
“Well, as it happens, Draco is an excellent conversationalist, when the conversation is about something he is interested in.” Harry had switched to butterbeer and seemed to be getting hopped up on sugar. He paused at the implication, then boldly pointed out the obvious. “I guess it hasn’t been very interesting for him so far.”
“It might help if you plugged it in. Isn’t it a little late for tea though?”
Lost in thought, Harry didn’t notice that Malfoy and his friend had started walking until they were practically out of sight. He cursed to himself, fumbled with his wand, and cast a quick Tracing spell that landed on Malfoy’s back without him noticing. It sort of worked. Harry Apparated himself into the nearest Tube station, to get some idea of where Malfoy was headed, then from there onto a busy street in Soho that was seething with young merrymakers. Harry sidled along the sidewalk, scanning the crowd for familiar blond hair, but only found himself getting more lost by the minute. The Trace was short-lived and had dissipated already.
Draco was better.
“I think I’ve already joined you because I’m helping you search for the damn thing,” Draco said, picking up his glass and raising it. “And surprisingly, the time I’m spending with you isn’t anywhere near as horrific as I thought it would be.”
"I taught Charms at Beauxbatons for the last eight years," Draco said, puffing his chest out proudly. "I'm not surprised McGonagall didn't inform us of one another; I imagine she was afraid it might make us turn down her employment offer."
Draco stilled for a moment, before returning to stroking Harry’s erection with a little more force than before.
Draco stepped behind him, wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, and rested his chin on Harry’s shoulder.
More importantly, he never wanted it to end.
"You're welcome, Harry, and remember," Dumbledore looked at him sternly. "things in the Mirror of Erised are not always as they appear."
“So this creature is older than Hogwarts? Is there an Elixir of Life in Loch Ness too?”
“Take your wand out, too. I don’t know what spells work against demons, so I’d recommend you stick with protective spells if you need them.”
Harry shook his head, lips curled into a slight smile, and turned to look over the safety barriers. They had reached the top, and while the vast crater was impressive in itself, Harry found himself much more drawn to the vibrant view below them.
Directly opposite the door was a desk that was covered in numerous figurines of magical creatures and a tiny scrap of paper that a man was scrawling something on. He made no sign of knowing there was someone waiting, only looking up after Draco cleared his throat to announce his presence.
“No, it’s no bother at all. Thank you, Dobby.” Harry gave him a kind smile. “Do you mind if I ask you something?”
. There’s little sense in staying miserable when I don’t have to be. I’m rich enough that I don’t have to worry about working for the rest of my life, and I’d rather do things that make me happy then bury my feelings in work. Are these your most recent paintings? They look cheerful.”
“Your uncle is a prick,” Draco said simply. “If his materials weren’t so cheap, my father would have kicked him out by now. Don’t tell him that, of course.”
Draco raised his brows, as though the answer was clearly the latter.
“I did enough last night, thanks,” Harry retorted. “My aunt wants me to go to the village, but I have no idea how to get there. Could you tell me which way to go?”
“Just ignore Pansy, Potter,” Draco said lowly, his hot breath tickling Harry’s ear. “If she’s not thinking about fashion or sex then she’s not functioning. Now, where
“Don’t be rude to the spirits, and don’t invite anything to manifest itself,” Harry said warningly. “Ouija Boards can be dangerous if they’re not used properly. I’ll end the session early if anything else concerning appears, but otherwise we can talk until we’re done and then we’ll say goodbye and close the session.”
Harry reached his fingers under the frames of his glasses, but he couldn't feel anything different about them. "This place is strange. Where do we even start looking? Ava? Av—?"
consider Draco handsome; his sharp points might be considered too severe for some. But Harry couldn’t get enough of him, especially his regal fingers. Harry wanted them in his mouth, sucking the salty tang of Draco’s skin.
Harry turned in Draco’s arm. “You’re not so bad yourself,” he smiled, before pressing his lips to Draco’s in a sweet kiss.
When the door to the office opened again Potter came in alone, and he looked surprised to see Draco waiting.
Before they reached their next city destination, the four of them agreed it would be nice to have a quieter, more relaxed day, and Levane seemed to be the perfect place for that.
“You shouldn’t be, because you had to beat your claustrophobia to qualify as an Auror,” Draco said carefully. He was just an inch taller than Harry, but in such a small space that difference seemed so much more amplified. “I think you’re turned on.”
“Hello, boys,” came Luna’s airy voice, and the two of them fell back into silence immediately. “You look like you’re having fun together.”
Harry never would have thought he’d find speedos attractive until he saw Draco in them. Harry’s own swimming trunks were nowhere nearly as revealing, but it meant he didn’t have to wear another pair of shorts on top of them when they left the villa, which would be a wonderful advantage in the Italian heat.
On the left side of the room, the rainforest theme abruptly stopped, and several large bean bags were situated in front of a wall covered in clippings from old editions of
. The spine was cracked, and some of the pages loose or torn, but that book had been a lifeline when he’d been a lonely little boy. He’d read the sequels as soon as he was old enough to stay out on his own and go to the library, but The Fellowship had a special place in his heart.
“So, are we going to use this goat as bait for our rabid coyotes or what?” Draco asked, trying very hard not to roll his eyes as Harry attached a leash and collar to Gertrude before charming it invisible.
They had been dating for a month now, and when Harry had invited Draco back to his one night to ‘look at the Black family tapestry’, Draco had said he wasn't quite ready for that yet. Harry had teased him about the hard work that went into looking at tapestries, but had otherwise readily accepted Draco’s need to go slowly and had since not pestered or even asked about sex, waiting for Draco to make the first move once he was good and ready.
Ginny eventually made an appearance, looking paler than usual but more or less under control. Her testimony was short but compelling, if the irrepressible murmurs in the crowd were any indication. She even made a reference to their previous interaction at Harrods, thereby practically guaranteeing that she would never be able to enter Harrods again without the risk of being mobbed by fans. Harry felt proud but a little sad for her, as she exited the room surrounded by a team of new bodyguards, Auror Hawken included.
“You’re just saying that because you’ve got a hero complex. Why should I care about some distant group of Muggles and their problems? It doesn’t really affect me.”
Harry’s gaze was thoughtful. “Do we really, though?” Seeing Draco’s eyebrow lift, he clarified, “Not to point out the obvious, but we are kind of polar opposites. Which, as they say, tend to attract.” He nibbled on his lower lip and smiled a little at Draco’s reaction. “I think what makes being with you so interesting is that while we may have had little in common at first, the ways in which we connect are meaningful.”
The wave of bliss subsided, and Harry was left uncertain in its wake.
The Chief Warlock fixed him with a stare over glasses worthy of Dumbledore. “The intentions cannot be proven, but the actions can. The fact that you appear to have successfully cast the Killing Curse without a wand is cause for concern.”
A few bites later, Draco was impressed. Harry had not been lying when he said that he was a good cook, and Draco wondered if there were some other unknown talents hidden up Harry’s sleeve. He intended to find out.
at Harry, for being so quick to believe that Draco was capable of using the Killing Curse. The anger flared back to life and he remembered what he’d decided to do, even if it cost him a piece of his heart.
Potter looked down at his hands, then directly into Draco’s eyes. Draco found an unexpected sadness there, and turned away to order another drink. “Can I get you anything, Potter?”
She waved at him dismissively. “It was a fucking bloodbath; we were all scattering for the hills and needed to get our heads back on straight. Took a longer time for some of us.” She drained the rest of her glass. “Lovely to catch up with you. We’ll have to have a proper sit-down in the near future and talk shit about Blaise, perhaps in front of him. But right now, Mummy needs a refill.” She smiled that wicked grin at him again, and whisked away on her sky-high stilettos into the steadily growing stream of people coursing through the Manor.
Harry’s face softened and he rolled sideways as he began to feather kisses along Draco’s hairline. “I can’t believe how hot it felt to be on the receiving end,” he whispered. “No wonder you like doing it all the time.”
Draco smiled archly and poured a shot for himself. “I take it so my sperm don’t taste dreadful.”
“Harry, how are you –“ Draco started, then stopped in amazement as Harry began magically removing Draco’s remaining layers of clothing. An unbuttoning of the shirt revealed that Draco was slender with just a hint of definition around the abdomen and upper chest. Draco shivered and tensed as Harry concentrated on removing each sleeve, licking his lips in anticipation. Harry could see a faint webbing of scar tissue where he had once injured Draco, and resolved to pay extra attention to that part of his anatomy in the near future. But for now, he wanted to draw out the slow agony of undressing just a little bit longer.
It was petty of him, he knew it, but the way Harry kept looking askance at Nigel’s gift dangling from Draco’s ear, Draco couldn’t
His mother didn’t know all the details of their last conversation, at the conclusion of his second trial, but she did seem to have an understanding of how deep Draco’s loyalty to family ran, and so she tried once more to reassure him that inviting Harry back into his life would cause few problems as far as she and Lucius were concerned. “If you’re worried about Mr. Potter’s previous lack of direction in life, I hear that he is now quite motivated and serving on several committees within the Ministry, as well as the Board of Education for the Academy. Not that you need to rely on his good name to support your own, but now that he has more power and popularity than ever, not to mention a tad more humility - “ there was a twinkle in her eye as she said this, and Draco smiled despite himself - “ it might not be a bad idea to reassociate your name with his. Particularly if it makes you happy.”
Once he could see straight again, Harry looked at the mess they’d made and waved one trembling hand to clean it up. “Scourgify,” he rasped, heart still beating rapidly from their exertions. They had never done it so roughly or spontaneously before, and he was half-scared that Draco wouldn’t like it. But oh, the raw
Speaking of agony… He felt an urge to put a hand down his own trousers as he removed Draco’s, and with Draco’s eyes widening as he watched, he went with it, wrapping his fingers around himself just as he had touched Draco moments before. No need to keep himself waiting, although he had no intention of coming just yet.
She smiled at him, a full one this time, and Draco was shocked that he had ever thought her ugly. “You can count on it.”
Draco considered the question before responding. He could feel Hodges digging at him beneath the surface, searching for an angle that might betray that he was really no different than before the War to End All Wars.
“So, Harry,” she piped up, when the awkwardness had subsided from the air a little. “How did you and Draco run into each other, anyway?”
Harry shook his head. “Nah, I’m all right.” The lie came easily, and he actually believed himself once he said it. “No harm in having one yourself though, it’s been a hell of a week.”
When it came to Wizarding topics, however, they were more circumspect with each other. Harry had backed off on his offer to teach Draco how to cast a Patronus, and Draco felt it wouldn’t be wise to push him on it. They went flying together a few more times – including one very memorable occasion when Draco’s hands wandered into Harry’s trousers mid-flight - but besides the occasional domestic charm, nothing further was said about magic.
Harry whistled, putting his hands in his pockets. “Guess he doesn’t mess around.” He was about to ask Draco for some advice on shoes when Ginny emerged from the dressing room looking decidedly vampish.
Just those words caused Harry to go hard again, and he allowed his imagination to run rampant. Draco was the one trembling before long, as Harry rained kisses and cast charm after charm that changed his touch alternately to cold, warm, and liquid. He seemed to get a particularly favorable reaction out of applying icy sensation to Draco’s nipples while pleasuring him with his mouth, and would have kept going to the end in that direction, except for Draco grabbing the back of his head and pulling him away. “Harry, I want to feel you inside me.”
“Right.” Harry’s nostrils flared a little, the way they did sometimes when he was royally cheesed off about something. “Just like buying that dress for Ginny didn’t really mean anything.”
Harry felt that it would be rude to say no, and so he followed the stranger. The first place they visited was a bar with a dancefloor that seemed to be devoted mostly to hits of the 80s, with occasional bouts of glitter descending from the ceiling. Harry didn’t see Malfoy anywhere, but that didn’t prevent him from acquiring several phone numbers, tucked into pockets both front and back, as he wandered through the heaving ocean of people and brushed glitter out of his hair. He felt flattered but relieved to leave, once the stranger had finished making the rounds.
Draco looked at him like he was crazy. “What, now? I’m barely even dressed.”
Clearly desperate for a conversation starter, Potter looked around him and commented on the appearance of the kitchen. “You have a really nice place, Malfoy. How long have you been living here?”
Draco shrugged and handed the blazer to him. It was lightweight yet warm to the touch and smelled vaguely of a spicy cologne, Harry couldn’t help noticing as he scurried through the bedroom to hang it up. The setting sunlight had abandoned the bedroom by now, forcing Harry to switch on the light as he entered and exited the closet.
have anything to do with it?”
“Silly, I thought you’d never ask.” They waved over a waiter before answering Harry’s question. “It’s Mysteria.”
“Well why on earth did you agree to come then?”
Ron’s arms were folded across his chest. “Actually, I’d like to hear it from you. And him.”
“Why is that a surprise? Clearly you’ve figured out that I’m gay, do I need to walk on eggshells around you?”
Thanks as always to Kbrick for being the best beta!
“Since when have you been so interested in Muggle clothing?” Harry called over the door to his changing stall while trying on a shirt. He jumped a little when Draco opened the door and poked his head in to answer.
Harry had scarcely time to let Draco in the door to his place at the top of the stairs before their lips met, drawn fiercely together as if by magnetic force. They fumbled to remove the heavier layers of clothing, letting them fall abandoned to the floor in a trail behind them as they made their way into the bedroom. Reaching the bed, they finally separated, breathing heavily. “Should we – “ Harry gasped out before Draco was upon him again, nudging Harry over onto the bed until landing on top with an arm over either shoulder.
“True. But it hardly requires much of me, besides standing around and looking mildly bored with the whole thing. Which would be correct.”
Draco could think of a few, but he was more interested in Harry at the moment. “Ah, not really. Most of them you probably can guess. Wizarding lineage, privileged upbringing, filial duty, et cetera, et cetera.” He gestured with one hand at the corner of the room before remembering that he was still holding a drink, and a little liquid sloshed over onto the carpet. “Whoops, sorry. I meant to ask, what is that over there?”
Harry looked genuinely taken by surprise. “It doesn’t. I mean, the idea behind it does bother me, but when I’m just touching you, it’s not a big deal.” He hesitated, and Draco sensed another question coming his way that he couldn’t duck. “When you got it, did it hurt?”
It was a gun, and it was pointed at Ginny.
Draco had resumed tracing Harry’s face with his eyes, and brushing his fingers along the line of Harry’s jaw. “Damn you, Potter. Why do you have to go and do something so stupid, and how can you still look so adorable after losing an ear?”
If he continued along the trail of self-honesty, Harry could trace his decision to return to working in the Auror department to that moment, as a reaction to the letdown of returning to his dreary Muggle-bound life without Draco to keep it alive and sparkling. It wasn’t the perfect fit, of course, but it was better than wallowing in uncertainty about which path to take forward, and at least he had lots of friends there.
Draco smirked, not wanting to force Potter into the role of therapist. “You’re not so bad, Potter. Your hair’s a mess and you might very well be insane, but I actually might like you a little bit. Don’t tell anyone, though.”
Draco stared at her. “The same Lovegood who my insane aunt imprisoned in the Manor cellar? That Lovegood wants to offer me a job working for her batty magazine?”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, tightening his hold around Harry as though he never wanted to let him go.
Harry frowned. In all of their sexual contact so far, Draco had never let Harry touch him. He was happy enough to get Harry off, but shut Harry out when he asked to return the favour.
“No, you haven’t,” Astoria agreed. “You’ve had your time to be an arsehole, though, so now it’s time to get back on your feet.”
“Yeah, well, you’re one of them,” Harry said, grinning.
“Yes? Who’s Blaise trying to set you up with then? Marcus Flint, perhaps?”
They cycled down to the lake together, and it was early enough that the country roads were almost empty. Birds sang in the trees, and though the sun wasn’t yet at its peak, it still beat down on them with an intense heat. The air was heavy with warmth, and Harry had to admit that swimming seemed like the perfect activity on such a humid day.
Harry grasped Draco’s shoulders and threw his head back as Draco bottomed out. Harry felt so full, and so
"Be nice to Nick,  he's my friend," Harry scolded. "And I didn't tell you about this because this mirror's dangerous; it can drive men insane. People always get hurt when they work with me, and I wanted to save you getting into trouble."
"This isn't teasing," Draco said casually, crooking his fingers in just the best way to unprove his statement. "I told you I want this to be the best sex you've ever had. Do you feel ready to take me now, or do you want me to finger you longer?"
It was September the First, and it felt almost like being a first-year again with the mix of nervousness and excitement in his stomach. Only instead of the loud chatter of students coming from the Great Hall there was only silence. The students wouldn't be arriving for another half an hour.
“Eighteen, both of us,” Harry answered, to save Dudley having to do any maths. “I look forward to meeting Draco.”
“Yes, I think I’ll go and have a bath,” he said. “Unless you want me to wait until you go, Daphne?”
“I’ll call reception,” Harry said, picking up the Muggle telly-phone to explain the situation to the receptionist.
“Talking of paramours,” Pansy said, “when are you going to invite Potter inside? Blaise and I can make ourselves scarce.”
than friends?"
Now here he was, transfixed on someone who was slightly arrogant and snobby, and finding him charming regardless.
"Oh, yes, I see now," Malfoy said haughtily, tugging at his collar. His cheeks had gone pink, no doubt embarrassed from looking into the mirror wrong. "I see myself surrounding by piles and piles of gold. Why didn't you tell me about this before you came down here? We're supposed to be partners on this, but instead I had to ask that pompous almost-headless ghost where you were."
“It’s not that I don’t want to,” Harry said, wringing his hands together as his brain tried  to think of the words to convey the feelings he’d been struggling with for far too long. “I just...I don’t know what I am. I fancy women, and I think I fancy men too, but I don’t know. It’s confusing, and I’ve never gone out with a man and I don’t want to hurt anyone by finding out I’ve actually been wrong, and-”
He gritted his teeth as he saw Blaise place a hand of Potter’s waist as he leaned in to whisper in his ear.
“Nice to know you’ve all been gossiping about me,” Draco muttered darkly.
“I think I’ll just get a cheese and tomato panini,” Potter said. “Are you going for haggis then?”
“Alright there, Draco?” Pansy asked sharply. “You’re not having a brain aneurysm, are you?”
“This is my wife, Petunia, and son, Dudley. And uh, this is my nephew, Harry. We adopted him after his parents died; we’re his only family so it wouldn’t have been right to leave him in foster care.”
