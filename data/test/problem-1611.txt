“I told you to do it a week ago when Professor had assigned it to us,” Draco sang, “This is what you get for not listening to your wonderful boyfriend’s advice,” Draco watched as Harry gave him a blank stare before going back to writing frantically. Draco started to pout.
Harry looked at him, frowning. “I kind of wanted to go to the cliff. You know, spend some time there.”
“Happy New Year, Draco,” Harry replied. Draco kissed him on the lips quickly before anyone could see, wrapping his arms around Harry as he stood behind him as the two stared up at the sky. “It’s beautiful. Isn’t it, Harry?”
“We don’t know if it’d work for me, and I don’t want to try. I don’t want to for sure that I can never hear again. That I can’t hear your voice.”
“Thinking?” Pansy repeated. “I didn’t know you were capable of doing so.” She said with a smirk. Draco simply rolled his eyes and went to sit beside her.
Hermione and Ron sat on either side of Harry, faces close to each of his ears. Harry, frowning, nodded slowly as the two started screaming at the top of their lungs. After a few moments of silence, he rolled his eyes.
Tears were starting to spill down Draco’s cheeks as the words echoed into his brain. “Harry, please, no.”
“I really think that’s his decision,” Harry said. Any tears he had before were long gone, replaced with feelings of anger and frustration.
“Ah, that’s really where you are wrong. My son is too young to understand that this is merely just a…
“Being worth the risk and trust are two different things,” Harry mumbled, but he knew it was wrong of him. His paranoia and fear was getting the better of him.
“Is this the job the Dark Lord gave me, or you are giving me?” Draco asked. He was so done with this. He didn’t ask to be a Death Eater. He didn’t ask to be a part of this. He didn’t ask for any of this. And in result, he lost the one person he loved the most.
“Alright, you two,” McGonagall said as she entered the room, sitting down at her desk. “I am absolutely appalled by your behavior,” she said while signing.
“Well, it was also because of what you said about You-Know-Who,” Hermione pointed, then pursed her lips when Harry rolled his eyes. “Sorry.”
“Draco and I aren’t together anymore,” Harry said slowly. It hurt him to say it, but he had to say it out loud sooner or later.
Draco rolled his eyes, but carefully took Harry’s hands and took him to his dorm, gently pushing him into bed, tucking him away, giving him some water to drink before he could fall asleep. Draco stared at Harry for a few seconds, who had his eyes shut, before he gently placed a kiss on his forehead, turning away to leave.
“I don’t want to,” he whined, groaning. “Besides, I stormed off. I’m not exactly sure who’s supposed to approach the other after an argument like that…”
“Do you have any idea how it feels? To see her disgusting, dry lips on yours. Her arms around your neck. And worst of all, to see you, your beautiful, soft lips, kissing her back, pulling her closer, even. I know I have no right to tell you who you can kiss and who you can’t, but fuck, it just…” Draco trailed off into silence, wiping his tears away, only to have more fall down. “...it
Dodger seemed like he wasn’t paying attention. More so, he was ignoring Draco. Both Dodger and Draco’s eyes moved to the window, that was wide open. Narcissa must have left it open for the owl to go out of.
“It’s a Muggle device, Ron,” Hermione rolled her eyes. “It usually helps people hear, but… since this was the result of some sort of dark magic, I’m not sure if it will work,” she explained, watching Harry stare down at them.
“Oh, God, I didn’t mean it like that. I just mean… it doesn’t really matter what I feel, does it?  I’ve just been a little on edge all year. Waiting for Voldermort’s next step, whatever,” he folded his arms. “Sometimes it makes me regret the deal we made.”
Molly laughed lightly. “I’m glad you like it, dear. Please do come back before you go back to Hogwarts-”
“You’re signing,” he smiled. “Lousily, but it’s good. You should do it more often when you speak to me. Helps me understand you a bit better.”
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, cursing under his breath. Guilt and resentment flooded his chest. Feeling Harry’s eyes on him, he tried to seem calm, but Harry had noticed. They both stared at each other in silence for a moment too long. Harry bit his lip, unsure of what to think or say.
“What makes you say that?” Pansy asked. Harry’s back was to Draco, so he didn’t notice that Draco slowly opened his eyes and shut them again, pretending to be asleep.
Harry looked at Hermione, who quickly signed everything Snape had said. “Um… no, Sir, I’m not distracted.”
“Trust me, you wouldn’t be the first person to get lost in Malfoy Manor,” Draco said with an eye roll as Harry left to the kitchen.
He thought about it for a moment. “I… suppose if we eat quickly, we can go for an hour or so,” he nodded. “I, too, wanted to go there today. I’m just a bit short on time. I’m sorry.”
The door opened and Hermione entered. She looked around the room. Pansy kicked the wall behind her to show her she was in the room. Hermione quickly nodded before shutting the door behind her.
“On a date with Lavender, to break up with her,” Hermione said with an eye roll, to which Harry raised an eyebrow at. Hermione opened her book again. “Yes, I know. Absolutely rude and harsh. I told him that but he said I was being unreasonable and walked off. Anyways, what’s up?”
“You’re my mother,” he shook his head. “...and the only family member I can tolerate,” he whispered under his breath, walking over to her and hugging her. He knew he shouldn’t have; Malfoys don’t hug. They don’t show affection. Hell, they’re lucky if they even understand what love is. But she hugged him back, almost as if she had been waiting for him to.
“Really?” he asked. Harry watched as the blond loosened his tie and adjusted his trousers, lying down on the floor beside him. “Hmm… that’s quite relaxing, actually.”
“Draco, wait a bit. Don’t you sit right next to each other in Defense Against the Dark Arts? Slip him a note then.”
Harry cut Draco off by pressing their lips together, leaning forward only slightly, (after all, their lips were already quite close) tilting his head. Unlike the kiss before, this one was far more gentle; more sweet, and definitely calmer. Draco was surprised by the sudden change in emotion, but didn’t say anything; happy to kiss Harry back without questioning it.
“You have a girlfriend, don’t you?” Pansy asked, running a hand through her hair, seeming rather amused. “Where else have you been going the past few Fridays? Gone before I can even notice.”
“Voldemort’s probably up to something.” Harry mused as he pulled up Draco’s arm to his lips, kissing it gently.
Pansy nodded and wished Draco a goodnight, before leaving. But she couldn’t help but regret that she didn’t press Draco for answers and to know more about the task he was given.
There were loud footsteps down the hallway, and Harry found himself turning and staring at the door, almost waiting for whoever it was to open the door. Harry was curious as to who it was.
“Harry, will you stop obsessing over Malfoy?” Hermione suddenly said, practically glaring at Harry. “This is the third time this week you’ve shown up late to breakfast! You’ve got to stop.”
Harry woke up to the sunlight hitting his face - he had clearly remembered closing the curtains the night before, but Ron must’ve opened them. Harry looked around the blurry room, reaching for his glasses on the bedside table, getting a hold of his glasses and slowly putting them on.
“Really, just because I said you could visit from time to time doesn’t mean you can pop in any time you wish,” she was saying, running a hand through her short black hair. She pushed the covers off of her and sidled up beside him once she heard him crying. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
“Ginny, I… I’m sorry, I…” Harry started to apologize but noticed that Ginny was staring at someone behind him. Harry turned to see a white-haired boy turning and walking away swiftly. “Fuck…”
“Then stay,” he cried softly. “Stay. We’ll figure it out. We always do. You could hide from them. You could stay.”
There was a moment of tenseness as the two stared at each other. Harry bit his lip, conflicted as to what to do or say, and then settled on doing something quite stupid.
” Draco Malfoy shouted at Dumbledore, and his wand flew out of his hands. Harry wanted to pull off his Cloak and talk to Draco, but he realized that he was bound. He turned and realized that Dumbledore was the one who had immobilized him.
Harry kept his eyes on him, confused. It seemed that the blond was conflicted, and he was too afraid to ask. He didn’t want to pry, but he didn’t like seeing him like this. It seemed to be a raw, unfiltered version of Draco Malfoy, one that he had never seen before. When he looked up again, his silver eyes held no emotion.
“You- what?” He stared up at Harry, eyes widening. His face was burning, and it actually felt as if he was coming down with a fever. Harry avoided his eyes, putting the piece of paper back into his pocket.
“Fuck those rules, Draco,” Harry shut his eyes, trying to contain his emotions, but failing like usual. “I’m sick of treading carefully. The truth is, we’re on opposite sides of a war. That will always be the truth. No amount of rules is going to change that.”
“No. It’s bigger than that. You don’t fucking trust that when it comes to the Dark Lord, I’d be able to keep my mouth shut about you. Do you think I’m reporting everything to my father or something?”
“She feels really bad, you know,” Ron said. “Mione. She feels awful about what happened. Said all she wants is to see you and Draco happy.”
There were a few low whistles and Draco’s eyes widened for a moment, before gulping, glaring at Harry. “You’re not fooling anyone with this,” he hissed in a low voice, almost as if he was trying to control himself.
“You ready to pay, Draco?” Pansy asked as she ran a hand through her hair, looking over at him. “Come on, can’t you choose one thing for him? Don’t you know what he would like? You’ve been dating for like, three weeks now?”
“I don’t care about my birthday,” Harry replied, standing up and collapsing into Draco’s arms, kissing him passionately. “I missed you so much,” he whispered against the blond’s soft lips, who seemed surprised.
“Draco!” he said back in a completely different tone in an attempt to mock him. “But you’re serious? We had an essay? I’m fucked.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, we’re wasting time! Fine, I’ll do it! Fucking pain in the ass!” Draco muttered, pulling the Invisibility Cloak over him.
Harry hesitantly took a few steps closer then sat back down on the bed, shaking his head. “Maybe we both imagined it,” he rolled his eyes, rubbing his scar.
“The poor boy… what a horrible thing to go through. His whole life has been messed up. I can’t help but imagine what it would be like if it happened to you, and that’s what makes me so-”
Then one Friday, sometime in March, Harry and Draco were cuddled up in Draco’s dorm while everyone was busy eating dinner. The two were silent - but for very different reasons. Harry was busily reading and Draco - well, he was just staring at his Dark Mark.
He rubbed his temples. “I’m worried for his safety. More importantly… I’m worried that this… might be something we can’t overcome,” it was the first time he had said that out loud. “You know. War. It’s… a big thing.”
“I understand, and I feel the same way, but… don’t speak so loud,” he answered quickly, speaking in a low tone. “You don’t know who could be listening. These Death Eaters would do anything to get on the good side of the Dark Lord.”
Breathing deeply, Harry fiddled with the necklace in his hands. He had to think this through properly this time. Of course, there was a big chance that Draco didn’t want anything to do with him again. What Pansy had said lingered in his mind - she was right. Draco chose to be part of this. He chose to be with him in spite of the complications. It was a big risk he was taking too.
Harry sighed. “I... I didn’t say no,” he mumbled. “But... I can’t say yes either. I need some time to think about this.”
Hermione and Ron were still trying to wrap their heads around the fact that he was actually seeing Draco, however, did not bring it up to him. They couldn’t deny the fact that Draco had certainly made him significantly happier the past few months. Other than that, Harry seemed to sulk every time his name was mentioned.
“Yeah, sure,” he nodded. “She’s still worried about you, you know. Maybe if you tell her you have a girlfriend, it’ll ease her up a bit.”
Looking around, he quickly opened the door and entered, surprised to see the room he and Harry had asked for, which had turned into their own. There were scattered coffee cups on the table, some robes on the couch, a few books on the table, and Harry sat at the table, one knee propped up as he wrote furiously on a piece of paper.
Draco smiled slightly, sighing as he ran a hand through his pale hair, the brown streak in his hair glinting. “Of course I heard. I know him better than himself.”
“Letter from someone?” she asked, taking it from the owl and handing it to Draco, who was wide awake now. His parents had never sent letters except for news about Narcissa. A dark feeling in his chest overcame him as he opened the letter.
“I’d imagine that Voldemort is our worst enemy, but I get what you mean,” she replied, smiling slightly, then her expression hardened again. “But he’s Malfoy! He’s cruel, annoying, and… a dick!”
She opened her mouth to speak, then nudged him when she saw Harry, Ron and Hermione entering. Draco turned - the Gryffindor table was just behind him. “There they are. Wouldn’t be surprised if they got held up by something. If those three are missing, something’s always bound to go wrong.”
“You think mine isn’t? Do you have any idea what would happen to me if my father found out, let alone the Dark Lord?” he raised his voice. “I go to bed every night thinking about how sooner or later I’m going to become one of them, and it’s painful, because I don’t want to hurt you. But turns out…”
“Oh, no, Professor Snape. It’ll take a while for him to get fully back to how he was before. He didn’t eat or sleep for over a week or two,” Hermione explained. Pansy wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulder, taking him to their table.
“Harry, why don’t you go?” Hermione asked. It had just been Hermione’s turn, and she had to kiss Ron. It was a quick and awkward kiss between them, but no one could deny that Hermione was practically glowing. Harry sighed.
He made his way to Potions, unsure of what to do anymore. On top of these feelings he had to get rid of, he was worried about Voldemort. Maybe in that sense, Draco was right. As a Malfoy, he would be expected to be a Death Eater.
Honestly, I got a block after the last chapter! And I've been super busy with schoolwork these past few months. I still can't promise a consistent schedule whatsoever due to school. But I'll try my best!
“We do,” Hermione said while signing with her hands, looking over to Ron.  “It’s just so hard to process… You really couldn’t hear our screaming?”
“Yeah, you did, but the way you behaved was quite ridiculous. I can’t just forgive you like that. I hope you understand it’s sort of hard for me,” he said calmly, then stood up. “Thank you for your apology.”
She rolled her eyes. “There’s a curse, isn’t there?” she asked. “I noticed the magical energy as soon as you entered. Something bad. Almost Voldemort level.”
Sneakily, they managed to make their way to the cliff, where Harry felt instantly more at ease. The sun was - very slowly - starting to set by now. The view was incredible like always.
“Did none of what I told you in the summer get into your head?” Lucius stormed, raising his voice. “Sacrifices need to be made for the Dark Lord to succeed. You’re letting your emotions overcome you. What is it about Hogwarts? Every few months you need to be told the same things again. Do you need to be reminded-”
There it was. Harry slowly turned around, smiling bitterly at Lucius. “Pardon?” he asked in a sweet voice, trying to be the bigger person and let Lucius take back what he said.
On the night of Christmas day, he picked up his quill, dipping it in ink and starting to write a letter.
“Yeah, but something tells me that it is,” Harry said, frowning as he looked among the Slytherins that were conversing in the distance, most of them making their way back up to the castle.
He blinked in surprise, meeting Harry’s eyes. “What, you think I did this? I didn’t even know what you were up to!”
, but someone better than me, and I just hate how he let that bitch kiss him, I know I’m in no place to say anything but still.”
“And as much as those five minutes of studying were quite great, I think we should take a break,” Harry said, grabbing the book out of Draco’s hands and shutting it, putting it away on the table. “Why don’t we do something more interesting?”
“Draco, please open the door, I just… I just want to talk,” Harry was saying. “Please, Draco? I’m sorry for what happened, and…”
“But why tomorrow?” Harry asked pleadingly. Draco gave him a look that said ‘don’t make me feel bad about this’, and Harry immediately stopped whining. He turned over and leaned forwards, kissing Draco on the lips gently. Then Harry slowly moved his lips, starting to kiss Draco’s cheek, then his jawline, then his neck, nipping at it, leaving a huge love bite on his neck, before kissing where he had just bit, gently. Draco shuddered, a chill running down his spine.
By this time Draco had rolled up his shirt sleeve, so the two stood up hastily. Draco realized that he better pass a snarky comment to make it seem normal, as Hermione and Ron was glancing over at him with surprise on their faces.
“Yeah, well, Pansy was in charge of cakes. When Luna said she wanted a big cake, I’m pretty sure she didn’t mean this big.”
“I thought of maybe buying you your own. But I thought it’d make you feel comfortable if you were wearing something that was mine,” Draco mumbled, turning slightly pink. “I have like ten pairs left anyway… and that’s only here. Back home I think I have around thirty.”
“I’m so fucking sorry,” Harry was mumbling into Draco’s neck, “I really am. I don’t know what I was thinking. I shouldn’t have said that stupid shit. I didn’t mean it, okay? I didn’t.”
He groaned rather loudly when she pulled the duvet off of him. “Come on! It’s eight a.m! We need to get you ready in time, alright? Faster, faster!”
,” he said rather loudly, mispronouncing the spell, in return, failing the spell he was trying to do on the rat in front of him. Flitwick had given out animals to practice the pell on.
After the last song finished, they both fell back onto the bed, breathing heavily. “Honestly, this is not what I planned to be doing at two in the morning, Harry,” Draco huffed, tugging at the collar of his sweater.
Draco now stared at his own reflection for a few more seconds before slowly turning away. He had to see Harry, he had to.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco asked, seeming taken aback. Standing up, he took Harry’s hands and guided them to the couch. As they sat down, he stared down. “I’m sorry for not checking up on-”
Harry had expected Draco to open the door by then, or at least say something. But all there was, was silence.
“I figured that would happen. The things I do for you,” he shook his head. He got out the food and Harry dived right in, having not eaten breakfast out of excitement for their date. “Harry, I say this not because I think it’s unattractive, but hazardous for your health. Don’t stuff your face with food. You’ll feel sick.”
“I don’t know how long this will last for,” Harry cut him off, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders, hands trembling slightly. “Just… let me have this.”
Harry decided it was best for him to gather some proof before telling Hermione and Ron about it further because they obviously they didn’t believe him during the feast when he went on about how Malfoy is annoying. Harry drifted off into a deep sleep.
Judging by the look on his face, Ron and Hermione both decided it was better to leave him be for the moment.
“He was keeping you safe,” he said, taking Harry’s hand gently. “And… he knew about my attempts. I figured. I didn’t really try my best to cover my tracks. But… he didn’t stop me whatsoever. A part of me thinks…”
“What?” Harry asked. His smile had faded and his eyes had stopped sparkling. He could feel his heart beating loudly. Only one thought was circling Harry in that moment:
“I was just asking how you and Malfoy are going to be dating this year,” she asked, running a hand through her hair. “Are you going to be using the Room of Requirement?”
“Hey, I was brave! And I did all of that when I was eleven!” he shook his head, then sighed. After a moment, he turned to Draco. “Dumbledore taught me about Horcruxes. Have you got any idea what they really are?”
Draco immediately took this as the perfect chance to check out Harry’s arse. It was just as cute as he thought, definitely. He watched as Harry put on the silk pants, feeling a little disappointed that he couldn’t stare at Harry’s arse anymore.
“That’s not all, watch,” he put out his wrist with his own watch and tapped it. “Look. We can communicate like this. The watch vibrates for each other as soon as we tap it. It can happen from any distance, it’s created magically. Obviously.”
“Harry, you got out of the shower just now, right?” Draco asked as the two walked down the hallways. Lucky for them, no one was in the halls, everyone was busy eating breakfast, so they could walk freely together.
“What, you thought we’d let you go on your own?” Hermione said with an eye roll. “Yeah, no way that’s happening.”
“I’m fine, really. Madam Pomfrey just wants me to stay here overnight because my nose is still quite sore and bleeds every now and then.”
At the party, Ron and Hermione were greeting everyone by the door, faces lighting up when they saw Draco, Astoria and Pansy.
It could still be him. It should still be him, Harry wanted to say. He wanted to say, ‘it’d be me who was lucky’. He wanted to be able to forgive him, he wanted the curse to be lifted, because for the first time in two years, the empty feeling in his chest was gone. The sleepless nights with painful memories had faded.
Draco reached forward to smack him, then softly placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Let’s get cracking, shall we?”
“I…” The way they looked at each other? He hadn’t really ever paid attention to that. “I don’t know. I guess only time will tell.”
“Hate? Excuse me, that was really hot,” Draco whispered, before jumping on Harry, wrapping his legs around his waist. “You’re really hot when you’re protective, you know that?”
“I think we’d end up on the first page of the Daily Prophet if we don’t. Besides, it’s safer for both him and me to not tell anyone. I think you’re the only one who knows about us, so…”
Harry took the letter from the owl, petting him before returning to his meal, unfolding the paper with his free hand. Hermione and Ron’s interest in the letters had now been lost as they were always bickering with each other. Besides, they could tell Harry didn’t like it when they asked him about it.
All of a sudden, Draco stood up and exited the Great Hall. Harry stood up, startling Ron and Hermione.
“Okay, good. I can’t… I can’t handle another person hiding things from me and lying to me. I need to know you’re on my side. Telling me what he’s asking you to do… will make me sure that you’re truly on my side. Not that I think you’re not on my side.”
“Draco, your idea of being mean is jumping down a tree and telling people how you bet on them with your father.”
“Ah, well,” he scratched the back of his neck, “England was getting quite boring. I had to switch things up.”
“Um… I asked Pansy who asked one of her friends… it’s kind of a long chain, but I got them,” he explained. “Could you try them on?”
“Wow,” Draco said, inching his face closer to Harry’s, “it feels so good to hear that… right here,” he took Harry’s hand and put it over his heart.
“You know that you talk way too much, right?” Harry asked, pressing his forehead against Draco’s, not breaking eye contact. “Especially when you should be silent. You know, let our eyes do the talking. I actually didn’t think I’d have to
After an exhaustive yet somewhat informative conversation with Kreacher, they all went to sleep, deciding to stay at Grimmauld Place until they figured out their next move. He was out like a log the first night, because he was tired.
He knew it was a mistake to stay for the wedding. And his birthday - well, that was just sad. He was excited to be seventeen, to finally have the Trace off of him, but all he could think of was his sixteenth birthday, spent with Draco, alone in his room at the Grimmauld Place.
So here Harry was, on a mid-September night, listening to Draco’s voice reading out a story. His head was pressed up against Draco’s chest, so he could feel his voice too; soft and deep and soothing. It was a beautiful way to fall asleep.
Harry slowly turned and saw Draco standing there, who was slowly lowering his wand. Harry bit his lip and took Draco’s wand out of his back pocket, to show Draco.
The nights grew colder as the days became longer. Each minute that passed was a minute closer to the wedding. Draco would lie awake at night, staring at the God-awful engagement photo that was framed and perfectly placed on his bedside table.
“What happened to eye-fucking?” Pansy asked as soon as they left, turning to look at him, concerned. “Did you guys talk during the holidays?”
“You’re… such a dumbass…” Draco said during wheezes, shaking his head. “You’re not supposed to let go of my hand!”
Harry jerked awake, his body sweating, as tears fell down his face, breathing heavily. Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair and wrapped his arms around him in an attempt to comfort him and calm him down.
well, if you like, i could make one last, BIG chapter, as a finale to this story, because i know a lot of you were (maybe still are!) invested!
“No, of course not!” Draco answered, and Harry let out a sigh of relief. Harry crawled over to Draco and wrapped his arms around his neck.
been our safe place recently,” Draco pointed out, which was true. Draco and Harry had decided to use the Room of Requirement as a place to hang out without being spotted or disturbed. Draco slowly shut the door behind him and
“Well, for one, you look like you’re going to vomit, and two, I can read you like an open book,” Hermione said, shutting her book and going to sit beside Harry. “What’s up?”
Surprisingly for Harry, Ron and Hermione seemed to know that they shouldn’t pry. They let him have his privacy, and let him keep to himself.
By the next day, everyone had assumed that Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter had a duel, and Harry had won. This caused even more whispering every time Harry entered a room.
“He asked me to stay and I left him. Because he’ll be safer if I leave,” he wiped his face. “Tell me I did the right thing.”
“I don’t need you to apologize, love,” Harry whispered softly. He sunk to the floor, and so did Draco. Draco slowly and hesitantly crawled onto Harry’s lap, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“No. I wanted you to hear it. And I realized I hadn’t learnt the sign for it either, so I didn’t want you to just see it on my lips,” Draco explained.
Draco glanced over to his watch. It was around six - Hogwarts Express had probably reached by now. How would Draco even get there? The only option would be to Apparate in Hogsmeade and from there, he would walk to Hogwarts.
“Hmm. So do you know why he’s been avoiding me?” he asked, his eyes lighting up slightly. She winced, unsure of how much she should let on, and how much she should leave for them to talk about by themselves. She cleared her throat awkwardly, already knowing that it was a risk she was doing this.
Harry found himself snorting as he read the letter. He looked up to see Draco was already looking at him, seeming satisfied with himself. He was confused, but Draco knew exactly why he was satisfied. He had managed to make Harry smile for the first time.
Harry let out a sigh of relief, feeling a huge weight on his shoulders leaving all of a sudden. He opened the box to see a necklace, with the letter D in silver “D?”
“Well, he’s looked away now,” she sighed, almost in a disappointed tone. “I thought you wanted to figure out your feelings?”
It wasn’t as if Draco had been having the best time either. As he arrived at Malfoy Manor, he knew things were going to be awful. He was unsure if he was able to tell because of the way his father had looked at him as soon as he entered.
Draco stared at Pansy for a few seconds. Then he slowly laughed a bit when Pansy hit his stomach from under the table. Then he slowly looked up at Harry who was still staring at him.
“I’d rather not,” he groaned, but knew this was coming sooner or later. He looked around the common room, glad to see it was practically empty, then gestured for them to sit down. “We uh… we’ve been dating for two months now. Or were."
“I just… never expected to like her, I guess.” Harry said with a small shrug. “But enough of that. Will you help me out?”
excuse of a wizard. And don’t even get me started on his lie about the Dark Lord being back. All of this is just to make everyone pity him, to get them on his side.”
“N-no, I’ll do it,” said Draco in a shaky voice, slowly standing up and grabbing Harry by the shoulder, pulling him up. He then took Ron and pulled the two down the passageway and down to the cellar.
“Harry, what’s wrong?” Hermione asked when she noticed him putting a hand to his left cheek, frowning deeply. Hermione raised an eyebrow when he didn’t respond, exchanging glances with Ron.
Draco answered by pushing him down on the bed and meeting Harry’s lips again, undoing the top button of his shirt. The fact that they were at a party didn’t seem to matter much to them anymore, and it didn’t seem as if anyone was actually missing them.
The class started and Harry watched Draco enter, ignoring his presence. It had been a few days, but Draco did not attempt to start any conversations with Harry during detention, nor did they acknowledge each other in the hallways.
“I really think it’s better if you talk to him today,” she said, shaking her head. What threw Harry off was she seemed genuine, unlike what he had noticed before. “Go wherever you usually meet. He’ll be waiting.”
Pansy was expecting him to scoff or be annoyed, but much to her surprise, he looked up, his eyes watery, nodding. Startled, she nodded, quickly getting up, gesturing for him to come with her. She linked her arm through his and they went up to the Astronomy Tower. Pansy knew this was a place, if anything, would help calm him down.
“Shh,” Harry quietened Draco with another kiss. As he pulled away from him, they both stared at each other, breathing heavily.
“Hermione, don-” he started, but she and Ron already stood up, practically running to the bathroom. Harry gave the others at the table an uncomfortable smile before getting up and going after them. “We’re sort of invading privacy here--”
“I was going to explain. I was going to explain everything.” Draco turned to face Harry. “But you… you…”
Narcissa nodded in understanding, “I can understand. Draco always loved playing Quidditch… Though he would always come every winter and complain about how he lost to Potter once again… and how annoying Potter was, and how he just wished that you could have been friends-”
Harry just wanted to feel Draco against him again - the smoothness of his skin, his tingly, sensual touch, his deep voice. He wished he hadn’t fallen asleep, because then he could’ve asked Draco to stay. And Draco Malfoy on Harry Potter’s side, as astonishing as it would be to the public, was all he really wanted.
They slowly reached the plain grass area where they had their first date the previous Saturday. Already feeling cold, Harry quickly got his wand out and started a fire. He slowly sat on the ground a bit further away from the fire and patted the empty spot beside him.
“Where is he?” Draco said, clutching something in his hands tightly. “You said he exited the building!”
“I will in a moment. I just need to tell you something first,” Draco said, grabbing a nearby chair and sitting by the door, keeping his eyes on Harry, who was more than five feet away.
Harry spent most of his Saturday hanging out with Hermione and Ron. Though, he did feel a bit left out because Ron and Hermione were just talking amongst themselves for most of the time. Well, mostly bickering. And Harry knew better than to interrupt it.
Draco had Apparated from the Grimmauld Place to the first person he could think of. He looked around the dark room, eventually spotting Pansy who was in bed. She jumped awake at the sound of Draco Apparating, narrowing her eyes.
“If I could, I think I’d have punched you both by now,” he sighed, sitting down across from the two. “I thought the first five times we tested it would be enough for you to process, though.”
“Then let’s test it. This has got to be at least six,” he replied, motioning towards the distance between them as they started walking. He stepped a little closer to Draco. “That’s about five. I don’t feel nauseous, nor do I see any blood, so I guess that’s good.”
It didn’t work. So he tried, five times more. But it didn’t work. Harry sighed in defeat, turning around, starting to walk away.
“You don’t know the half of it,” Harry muttered. He turned back to his bed, grabbing his wand and turning to leave.
“When are you not worried about me anymore,” he rolled his eyes, then gulped. “Sorry. That was a bit out of line. I was in the room of requirement studying and fell asleep there. I came back a bit late.”
“I’m sure it’s fine, Potter,” he shook his head. The two stared at each other, unsure, then peeked into the cauldron to look at the potion, which exploded in their faces. Liquid went everywhere and everyone in the room looked up, surprised by the noise.
“Maybe this wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t keep your relationship with that girl so secret,” Ron said.
“We both know I have too much pride for that.” pointed out Draco, to which Harry nodded at, agreeing.
Pansy facepalmed. “Shit,” she muttered under her breath. “Yes, it was. Look, don’t think that Draco’s a bad guy. Really. He doesn’t want to be doing that Death Eater stuff at all, h-”
“So… you accept that he’s actually deaf?” she raised an eyebrow, not bothering to ask why he needed to learn sign language to make fun of Harry. Draco gulped, staring at her for a few moments, unsure of what to say, before shaking his head aggressively.
“Draco, it’s been years. It’d take time for that to be reversed. Besides, she was probably extra cranky because we woke her up.”
Draco Malfoy stood at the door of The Burrow, trying his best not to cry as he pulled on his sweater. “I-I get my own Weasley sweater?” He asked, holding back the tears. “H-Harry, see! I don’t have to wear yours anymore…”
Harry spent the next few days wondering why Draco would even want to fight Blaise for something like that. It wasn’t like they were that good friends, right? While he felt like he could talk to him about things, he didn’t realize that they were at that stage.
He had sent a few letters to Harry over the course of the next two weeks, but did not hear back from him. The impending truth was waiting for Draco, quietly, almost a small whisper that would haunt him on his sleepless nights. A quiet, calm yet eerie voice, telling him that Harry didn’t love him anymore.
“Shall we go back to our dorms?” Draco asked, yawning slightly. “It’s still pretty early, but we should probably use your Invisibility Cloak. I’m not in the mood to get swarmed by people with questions about our relationship.”
On a Saturday evening, Harry walked into the Common Room, surprised to hear music and everyone in the room, in separate groups, talking. Hermione quickly approached Harry, noticing how confused he looked.
It finally occurred to Draco that Harry was wiping away the lipstick marks. Their gaze remained on each other as Harry continued doing this.
“Oh, this is hilarious!” Dean said through laughter. “Two enemies, together in a room for seven minutes. Yes please!”
“I think, if you want to be saved from Death Eater duty, you better go,” she smiled at him warmly. “Okay?”
“No. I have a system. I dream, I wallow for five minutes, then I move on. It’s easier that way,” he sighed, swiftly losing the energy to argue with Draco.
“It’s good to see you,” she said quietly. She pulled away, but held him at arm's length. “Did your father… undo the curse?” she asked in a low voice.
have thought he’d be able to keep Harry second? Harry was first, always. Even when he hadn’t realized it.
“Harry’s looking,” she mumbled under her breath. It wasn’t as if anyone could hear her - Blaise was being the loudest at the table, acting as if he had won the fight between Draco, and as if it somehow determined his worth.
“Oh no,” Harry said under his breath, slowly picking up his stuff and going to sit beside Draco. He didn’t dare look at Draco, what if he was mad at him? He didn’t want to see Draco glaring at him.
cross,” he held both of Draco’s hands tightly as they remained standing there. “I’m so angry. But I can’t bring myself to waste our limited time like that. So fuck you, but also, I love you.”
He collapsed into Ron’s arms, letting the tears roll down his face. “I couldn’t… I can’t… make a decision, so… I just… thought it meant I don’t want him.”
Ron rolled his eyes in response. They entered the Great Hall and Harry walked straight ahead. Hermione had just started talking to Harry and Ron about a certain assignment they had for Potions.
“Are you kidding? What do you want me to call you?” Draco asked sarcastically. “Yes, Harry is my person-who-I’ve-been-dating-for-the-past-three-months.”
Leaning his head against the window, Harry looked out at the view from his dorm in the Gryffindor Tower, his face expressionless. He thought back to when him and Draco used to be enemies. Maybe things were simpler then, for both of them.
“You okay, love?” Draco asked softly as he sat down beside Harry, who was frowning as he took a sip of his coffee.
“Well, I’m sure they’re not hate letters,” he stood up, then looked back at Harry. “Come with us. Please? We’re just going to the Three Broomsticks.”
Harry nodded, eyes wandering to the record player in the room. “This used to be Sirius’ room,” he spoke finally, standing up and picking out a disc record and carefully placing it on the player.
“No! No, I want you to know. In case… in case anything happens. You need to know that I’m on your side. You know that, right?”
“Perhaps for the best,” he replied. He looked up at the Slytherin table, searching a little then eventually finding Draco, who was messing around with Pansy. After a moment, he looked up, and as their eyes met, Harry felt the need to quickly look away.
He massaged his temples. “I’m still not quite sure. What would happen if your parents found Harry here? And what if they question why I’m here so often?”
Was he totally stupid for ruining things between them? He just didn’t want things to get complicated. Although, things between Harry and Draco couldn’t ever be simple. With their love, there would always be a little hatred, and with their hatred, there would always be a little love to spare.
“No,” she cut him off, moving closer towards him. “I’d be stupid to not realize how genuinely happy you have been with him. He helped you in a way that I wish I could have. But… it’d have been dangerous. With You-Know-Who inside your mind right now, it’d be bad to be with him anyway, right?”
Harry had given Draco another charm to add to his bracelet on his birthday, and dark green nail polish. Hermione had told him to give him the nail polish as a joke. Draco insulted it and protested that he wasn’t going to wear a ‘girl’s product’, however, thanked him and kissed him. It was cute, that amidst the chaos, sneaking around, and lying to each other for the sake of their conscience, lives, and relationship, they still had their moments together that made it all so worth it.
Draco held onto his hand tighter, pushing any sensibility he had aside. He pushed away the thought of his father, and whatever task he would be asked to do soon. All that mattered to him in his moment was what Harry had said to him, because he was right. They would be stupid not to try, right?
“It’s more believable than you think. Don’t make me regret helping you,” Pansy huffed. “So, what are you going to do?”
Draco licked his lips, reaching out and stroking Harry’s hair gently. “I know. But the rules kept us safe.”
“No?” Harry said, confused. Was he supposed to know where Draco was? “Why, do you know where he is?”
“I think he does. The night he was in the Hospital Wing, Harry and I fought, so I went back to apologize, and I heard him talking to someone. Now, I didn’t hear her voice, but I’m pretty sure she hid under the bed.” Hermione stated, turning to face Ron. “Who do you think could it be?”
Everyone in the Eighth Year knew about Draco and Harry - well, to a certain extent. The only people who knew that they were dating were Ron, Hermione, Luna, and Pansy. The rest all just thought that Malfoy and Potter finally put their differences aside and decided to be friends.
“I didn’t want to start another fight,” Harry muttered, setting down his quill on the table, pausing writing his essay. “So, why weren’t you on the train?”
“That’s better,” he nodded, a small smirk on his face, as if he knew just how much power he had over his son. “Your mother is in her room. The doctor was just in for a check-up. Go see how she is.”
“Draco, it’s one in the morning. Don’t you think we’ve studied enough for today?” Harry asked, looking up at Draco, who looked aggravated that Harry was speaking again.
“You know, Draco, I really don’t think you should be going to Hogwarts for your eighth year,” said Lucius, taking a small step towards his son. Draco slowly took a step back, shaking his head.
If any of you are actually still here, thank you. And if any of you were actually waiting for a new chapter, I'm even sorrier, I just had zero inspiration for a while.
It was a kiss with many, many emotions; the main one being lust, this time. They hadn’t met up to study, hang out or anything for the past week. The two were practically thirsty for each other.
Harry had never heard a tone so malicious come out of Draco’s mouth, nor had he seen this cold expression in a while. It had to be a facade - his silver eyes were a dead giveaway. Moreover, Harry hoped Draco wouldn’t have the heart to kill Dumbledore. He couldn’t.
When he got back into his room, he saw Dodger had picked up the stack of letters that Draco had written that was meant for Harry.
He stayed in the hospital wing for a few days, insisting that he was getting a bad stomach ache. Madame Pomfrey was too tired of his whining to do anything about it, telling her he needed to stay in the hospital wing.
Despite all they had been through, they were still just awkward gays in love with each other. Green eyes stared into silver ones.
Merry (late, I know) Christmas! And Happy New Year's Eve - it's literally 2 in the morning as I post this, I hope you guys are grateful for how late I stay up to finish chapters :(
though?” he groaned. “None of these would be good for him!” He looked around the store, gasping when something caught his eye. Pansy followed him, raising an eyebrow at the necklace he had picked up. “I know it’s simple, but… it’d symbolize something we talked about.”
“Draco,” Harry breathed when he stared into Draco’s eyes. He didn’t know what was up today, but staring into those endless silver eyes, with his silk hair that he didn’t gel up specially for Harry, and his beautiful smile, Harry couldn’t think straight. “You look stunning.”
“Harry doesn’t know how to dance for his life,” Draco said with a laugh. “He kept on tripping over my foot, and at one point he fell over. If it weren’t for me, he would have bruises all over his face. Then, after dancing we ate some more snacks and just talked. Pansy, it felt so good. I felt so free. I forgot I was a Death Eater. I forgot about what...
“Can’t do much hearing, but go ahead,” Harry said, pushing his hand off and folding his arms. “You have thirty seconds.”
Ginny Weasley was running up to Harry, her long red hair flying behind her, as she slowly came to a halt right in front of him.
“I need to go too. Like… right now. Dumbledore’s waiting for me,” he turned to leave, then turned right back around, taking Draco’s hands, looking up at him. “Happy anniversary. I love you.”
“Leave it? All you’ve done the past five years is go on about Potter, and you’re telling me three weeks of detention with him has convinced you to leave him alone?”
“Just… just give him five minutes,” Harry said. “Could you guys go get some food? Draco and I haven’t eaten in a long time.”
“Well… today’s Ron’s birthday, as you know. It was supposed to be really great, but he ate some chocolates that were for me - and they ended up having a love potion in them. So I had to take him to Slughorn-”
Draco took off before the bell could even ring, signaling the end of class. He was highly aware of Harry eyeing him during the whole of the lesson. Harry was trying to see if he was behaving strangely. He knew something was up with Draco.
“Oh, as if you’re not a huge Gryffindork. ‘Oh, I’m going to jump on a broom that I don’t know how to ride to help out my friend!’”
Harry avoided Hermione’s sympathetic gaze. It was uncomfortable and disheartening. He glanced over to the Slytherin table behind him. He made eye contact with Pansy, who seemed to be moping, and Draco, beside her, was staring down at his full plate of food, unable to even pick up the fork.
“Your father and I have decided that you won’t be returning to Hogwarts for the seventh year,” said Narcissa Malfoy, shutting the door behind her, staying by the door.
“A bit hypocritical of you, don’t you think?” Blaise laughed bitterly. “Come on, don’t be such a wuss. Crabbe and Goyle will help too.”
Blaise seemed complacent, pushing Draco’s hand off of him. “He must have his dick deep inside you to do-”
“It’s a promise ring,” Draco said, panicked when he noticed Harry’s smile fading. “I… Oh fuck, should I have not gotten you that? I just thought… I can’t propose, but I just thought if I promised-”
“No luck?” Narcissa Malfoy asked as Draco lied down on his bed. Draco didn’t respond. She slowly sat down at the foot of his bed. “Send them a letter.”
“Uh… what did we have to do again?” Harry asked embarrassedly. Hermione rolled her eyes and got out a plain piece of paper, starting to explain the assignment to Harry. But something caught Harry’s eye when he looked at his textbook.
Harry put his hand out for Draco to shake, who pushed it away and kissed him instead, and the ache in Harry’s chest had faded slightly. Knowing that Draco was his again; that Draco would be on his side. And to see him smile against Harry’s lips when he pulled away ever so slightly.
Harry looked at him, groaning. “I know,” he admitted. “I don’t suppose you did it as soon as it was set?”
The wedding was icy, dreadful, despite everyone smiling as he walked down the aisle. He stood beside Pansy, who smiled at him sadly. The anxiousness he had been feeling all day was too much to handle. His stomach was queasy and he felt like he was going to be sick at any moment.
Draco bit his lip. “My father didn’t think it was the best idea for me to go to come back to Hogwarts, so before I could leave, he locked me in my room with no way to leave.” Draco said after a few moments of silence.
“Yeah, it’s not every day I willingly go near someone who could potentially kill me,” he shrugged, looking over at Draco. “Listen, I... I’m trying to think of this from perspective, but… it’s just hard for me. I went two years thinking that I had done something wrong, all because my biggest fear was…”
“What work?” Harry asked nosily, looking up at Draco. Harry was practically lying on top of Draco. The two were on Draco’s bed and so tangled up in each other that they didn’t even bother to move. “Like a job?”
“Yeah, they measured my perfect size and made it accordingly,” Draco said a little ashamedly. “But other than that, it’s soft and beautiful, right?” Draco made sure.
“Another letter, huh?” Ron said as he sidled up beside Harry, grabbing the letter from his hands. His eyes lit up as he read the first few lines of the poem, almost as if he was excited. “I get lost in-”
“Molly! Hi!” Harry greeted, hoping she didn’t see - and if she did see, she’d pretend nothing happened. He walked forwards and hugged her.
“Why do you always wake up so early?” Harry shot back, and Draco just rolled his eyes again, sitting down at the bed. “You don’t have to wait for me. I might take too long.”
“Okay, are we done bickering for the day?” Draco asked as he took Harry’s hand, starting to walk into the forest.
The door swung open, and there stood Harry, taking a few steps back from the two that were standing right in front of the door. “Just… come inside,” he said. “Ron, go downstairs.”
“I just… don’t think you should stop trying new spells,” Draco frowned as he watched him sit down across from him. “Seriously, Blaise is an idiot. Even while deaf you can probably do every spell better than him.”
Groaning in pain, he leaned his head against the bookshelf. Draco walked up to him, kneeling and stroking his forehead. “You’re in worse shape than I thought, darling.”
The two broke into a small smile as Harry went to stand right in front of him. “Do you need it? I reckon using your mother’s wand isn’t the same.”
Draco looked at him, and for a moment, Harry was afraid he was going to get mad, but instead he leaned down and kissed him quickly. “You’re so sentimental,” he said, but he was smiling. “Can I read it?”
Draco wrapped an arm around Harry, who leaned his head on his shoulder, calming himself. They sat there for a few moments in silence. Harry took a mental note of everything around him right now. Draco’s soft breathing, the slight breeze, the pink sky, the feeling of being in his arms.
“Were you ever planning on telling me, or what?” Harry spoke after a few moments. His tone was icy; having zero sympathy nor emotion.
Harry sat at the desk, unable to focus on his homework. He jumped when Draco tapped him on the shoulder. “You didn’t see me come in?” he asked, sitting down across from him. Harry shook his head, watching as he took out his textbook. “Alright, let’s get started.”
“W-wait, don’t give me yours,” Harry whispered. Everyone else in the room was too busy fighting to notice that the two were on the floor, talking.
A few days had passed. Harry was seated at his desk in his room. He knew they couldn’t stay at Grimmauld Place for much longer. It would be only a matter of time before a Death Eater that wants to kill them would pay them a visit. It wasn’t a safe place to stay.
Draco nodded, sitting down on the bed. “Only he can take back the curse. My hands were tied. The only option was to break up with Harry. I know if I told him about it, he’d throw me in his arms anyway. I couldn’t hurt him that way.”
“He wanted to know what my nightmares have been about. I was too embarrassed to tell him. Not only that, I don’t want it to be used against me some way. What if You Know Who finds out my deepest fear and makes it come true? I know he might find out either way because he’s been into my mind, but…” Harry trailed off into silence, frowning. “I just…”
“Why didn’t you tell me? Fuck, why are you with me? L-look at what I did to you,” Harry was saying, turning to face Draco. He took Draco’s hand and made him trace over one of the scars, “I can’t believe… I should have known it would have been this brutal… I’m so, so sorry, I…”
He put a hand to his neck. “Uh… yeah, I was with him. And no, I don’t need concealer. And don’t refer to me as ‘honey’.”
“I-I overreacted. I was just hurt. I thought you were on his side. I didn’t know,” Harry whispered. “I shouldn’t have pushed you away so harshly. I shouldn’t have acted the way I did.
It all clicked. That’s what Draco was doing in the Room of Requirement. That’s what Voldemort had set him to do.
“Don’t worry about what everyone thinks,” Hermione told him. “You’ll always have us. Oh, by the way, the package from my parents finally arrived.” She handed Harry a small package. Ron watched in disappointment.
“I shouldn’t have come,” Harry said, feeling guilty. He should have respected what Draco wanted, and he should have left him alone. He stood up, and turned to leave.
Draco put a hand to his head. “I’m sorry. I’m being stupid. I shouldn’t have said all that. Just forget it."
Draco watched him leave and got up himself, leaving without a backwards glance at the Hall. Pansy simply rolled her eyes.
“Oh, yes, you did. I had the hardest time trying to figure it out - but I knew once I noticed you were writing letters, all I had to do was read to who it was - so I did. Didn’t come much of a shock to me, I always presumed you had a thing for him. Every summer, it was always ‘Potter this, Potter that, Potter did this, oh did you know Potter did this’, I thought I’d never hear the end of it. But when you came back after sixth year, I did get quite suspicious.” Narcissa explained, “So, I dug a little deeper and… I just knew after a while.”
It was as if what Harry had been dreading was finally approaching. Draco had been set an awful task, and this was going to drive a wedge between them. It was certain. Despite their stupid rules and deals and how much they wanted to reassure each other that they were okay, this wasn’t something up for debate.
He was absolutely worried sick, and he completely blamed himself. After all, it was his fault. His fault for lying, betraying, and breaking Harry.
“It’s not the same,” Harry said, slowly opening his eyes and looking up at Draco, “We have to be enemies in classes and everywhere else…” Draco sighed but didn’t say anything - because he knew Harry was right.
, he thought to himself. She folded her arms, and Harry correlated her expression to one of an angry mother. “I was worried.”
“The fact that you said it doesn’t make me look unattractive makes me think that it precisely does.”
Draco looked over to Astoria, who simply just laughed, taking a sip from her champagne, amused by his panicked expression. “Will she ever stop teasing you about him?”
Draco snickered, pushing his hair out of his eyes as his stony eyes finally met Harry’s. “You could say that again,” he murmured, then waved almost menacingly. “Can’t hear me, can you, Potter?” He raised his voice.
“Thanks again for letting me stay with you for the summer,” he smiled softly, squeezing their hands then letting go, turning to look outside the window. They were already on their way back to Hogwarts. Over the summer, Harry, Ron and Hermione all started to learn WSL, which was Wizarding Sign Language. With a bit of research Hermione learned that it was almost the same as British sign language, only with extra signs for Wizard terms.
“Uh, no, you placed your hand on my thigh and started tickling me and I had to bite my tongue to stop myself from squirming.”
“No,” Harry said truthfully. “I think… I think I just need to be alone.” He quickly got up, moving away from Draco’s touch, grabbing his wand and exiting the Room of Requirement.
He stared at her, frowning. “Have I become a huge burden on you?” he asked, looking over to Ron, who was sitting across from them.
“I’m always hurting,” Harry said without thinking. When Draco gave him a confused look, he clenched his jaw. “When I’m not thinking about Dumbledore, I’m thinking about Sirius. And when I’m not thinking about him, I’m thinking of Cedric or my parents. And when I finally get a break from the guilt, I’m thinking about
“I have no idea what you just said,” Hermione told him. Harry laughed slightly before quickly wiping his tears away.
“It’s the middle of winter, Harry. Everyone’s inside in their Common Rooms. We’re actually crazy to be out here when it’s this cold.”
“Could you tell Draco to go to the tent? You know, when he’s out of here. I won’t be there, I just… I left a few things there for him.”
“Hey, Astoria, we should get going,” Narcissa said as she entered the kitchen. “Oh, Pansy! You’re here already, perfect. Let’s go.”
,” he cried out in anger, slapping him in the face, tugging at his shirt. “What did I ever do to you? What did I ever…” he felt tears stinging in his eyes, chest aching. “What did I ever do to…”
?” she emphasized, snatching the newspaper out of his hands, then chuckled. “There’s your boyfriend, front and center.”
“Why do you need it?” Hermione questioned, taking a step forward. She was just by Ron’s bed, giving Harry space that he seemed like he needed.
Begrudgingly, Lucius picked up the quill and signed his name on the contract that now legally bound him to undo the curse - and if he didn’t, Draco would take it to court and have him taken to prison.
Harry smiled at Draco. “So we’re on the same side, then?” asked Harry, his green eyes sparkling as he looked into Draco’s eyes, slowly putting the wand away and taking Draco’s hands, holding onto them tightly.
“Harry, I thought it was obvious. I mean, you can literally feel his presence when he enters the building. And your hair - isn’t that a dead giveaway?” she folded her arms.
“Ron, you’re such an idiot,” Hermione rolled her eyes, signing along as she spoke. Draco was glad for two things - one being that he knew basic sign language, and the other that the three used sign language to communicate while speaking. “The important question is,
Pansy, Narcissa and Astoria were going shopping for any last minute details for the wedding. Draco smiled at his mother as she left the room. Pansy stood up to leave, as did Astoria.
Harry nodded again, unsure of what to say. “It went… better than I expected. I thought it would be awkward, but… what can I say? It’s never awkward with him. We always find something to talk about, which is what I love… loved about him.”
That night, Harry got out his map. He had searched the hallways before dinner but couldn’t find Draco. He hadn’t shown up to dinner.
Harry and Ron burst into laughter. Harry had missed this; he had been so wrapped up in obsessing with Draco being a Death Eater, and Ron had been so busy with Lavender and arguing with Hermione that they had not spent proper time together.
I've been reading your comments and it really makes me feel so happy. Even though I haven't touched this story in a while, I still get an occasional comment that makes me feel terrible for not finishing this story, so... here I am. Some things may seem rushed or strange but I'm trying my best. The spark that was there is slowly returning. Thanks for waiting for so long.
“Your idiot, always,” he whispered. “Listen to me. For now - you’re his follower first, my boyfriend second. Remember that.”
Draco ran a hand through his blond hair. “Move, will you? I’m trying to get inside.” He told Harry, before pushing him into the closet and fully shutting the door.
Harry thought what Pansy was saying was utterly ridiculous, stupid and uncalled for, but he simply nodded, too tired to argue, so he just slowly shook off Pansy’s hand. Harry only liked Draco’s touch. Everyone else squeezed his hand too tight, or too less. Harry pushed away that thought, walking away from Pansy and entering his dorm.
“That’s what we called Sirius when we were in public - didn’t want to attract attention by saying the name of a “criminal”. Which he wasn’t.”
“Say that again,” Draco said when he pulled away, panting. He had locked Harry in place with either leg by his hips.
Pansy laughed. “Yes. Now, here.” She handed Draco a simple sweater and black pants. “Keep it casual. After all, he probably doesn’t care what you look like.”
I don't like the title of this fan-fiction. I'm considering changing it, but I suck at making titles.
“Mate, what the bloody hell are you doing?!” screamed Ron, who received a strong, harsh kick from Hermione who was right beside him.
As soon as he had entered, he was a little grateful to see that Draco’s back was turned to him. He had thought maybe he would feel more at ease and more… warm if he saw Draco, but he still felt cold, if not colder. It was unnerving, to say the least, but Harry found himself actually being able to laugh and get along with everyone.
“Strategic? In a stupid Muggle game? Whatever,” Draco huffed, standing up and walking towards the window. The sun was starting to set. He turned around to look at Harry again. “Did we really spend the whole afternoon playing board games?”
“No. And don’t speak a word about it to Harry. He doesn’t know that I’ve actually gotten a task I need to finish.” Draco told her. Then he noticed the worry on Pansy’s face. “I’m fine, really. It’s not that big of a task.” But it was.
“Oh, look, he’s signing. Draco, don’t you think we should mess with him again? I feel like that prat deserves it,” he said smugly, taking a sip from his drink.
“N-no. Fuck, no. No, I didn’t… no…” Harry sank to his knees, right beside where Draco was shaking in a pool of his own blood. “No! I didn’t… Fuck!”
Harry laughed against his chest, wrapping his arms around Draco’s body. “We could move in together.”
“Well, that doesn’t concern you in the slightest,” Lucius shrugged, then noticed the look in Draco’s eyes. “...alright. On your wedding day, I will undo the curse. Are you happy with that? You can explain to Potter after a wedding ring on your finger. And, for Merlin’s sake, ditch that brown streak hairstyle. It doesn’t suit you.”
Draco spent most of his time wandering around, rather than actually trying to find Harry. Like hell, he was going to do what his father said. Even if he did manage to find Harry, he would probably send him even further away from the Death Eaters.
“...nothing,” he shook his head, picking up the cup and taking a sip. “You know, um… I really liked the poem you sent me on Saturday.”
“Fair point,” he nodded, ripping out the page from his notebook, pocketing it. “I can’t study anymore. I’ll see you next friday. Thanks.”
Harry kicked his foot suddenly, trying to casually make it seem as if he had just stepped closer to the cauldron in front of them.
“Cedric…” Harry croaked, then sat up quickly, as if he remembered something suddenly, scrambling to get up. “I need to get to get to him before-”
“Then what is it? The only other thing I can think of is…” he stood up slowly. The blond turned around to look at him, his silver eyes shining with an emotion that Harry couldn’t decipher. They stared at each other until Harry looked up to see the mistletoe hanging above them.
“I’m sure he’ll forgive you,” Draco said after many moments of silence. “Till then, let’s get you to bed, shall we?”
“I’m not letting you leave,” said Hermione firmly, starting to glare back at Harry. “You are in no state to-”
“You did! You led me on! I can’t believe you!” Tears were falling down her face and she was glaring at Harry. “Why did you kiss me back then? That day?”
“I haven’t got any options…” Draco was mumbling. “I’ve got to do it. He’s going to kill me… He’s going to kill my family.”
Signing the poem off with his initials, he shut the journal, setting the quill down. He kept his eyes on the fire. He was growing tired of the situation, yet thoughts of it consumed most of his time. Standing up, he shook his head. Harry was probably not even thinking of him. He was stupid to even let it bother him this much. Of course he would be untrustworthy. He was a Malfoy, and that’s all people would see him for.
She gave him a blank stare. “I love you, Malfoy, I do, but I can’t handle you around all the time. I’ve been doing it for six years and I’m growing a bit tired of it,” she sighed dramatically, then laughed when Draco kicked her with his foot.
After adding a few ingredients, Harry noticed the cauldron was filling up and sighed irritatedly. “Can you pull up your sleeves?” he reached forward and grabbed Draco’s hands, yanking up the sleeves of his robes and shirt, stopping when he noticed the bracelet on his wrist.
Harry said nothing, looking back down at his lap, unsure of what to say. “Fuck, Draco,” he whispered. “What are we doing?”
“N-no, it’s just… today’s…” Harry chewed on his bottom lip - he felt stupid for feeling this way. But he had a right to, didn’t he? They were his parents, after all. He had a right to feel sad over their death. “Today’s… today’s my parent’s-”
He stayed silent, unsure of what to say. Why did it matter? When did the thought of Harry with someone else start hurting him? When did the thought of his soft lips on his become a daydream? When did the thoughts of Harry Potter fill his mind?
“What was?” she asked, frowning, edging closer to him. “Did something happen, Draco? I heard your mother was sick-”
Draco rolled his eyes, but found himself smiling, reaching for the quill as he wrote back. Harry’s letters were the highlight of his day. There wasn’t much going on in Malfoy Manor, but the whole atmosphere had changed as soon as he had got back. The place had always been cold, lonely and isolated, but it was somehow worse this time.
The lesson went by somewhat smoothly. Harry found it easy to teach everyone, especially since they were actually quite eager to learn. He also found it to be a good thing to be doing this rather than moping about all day. It felt like he was achieving something. At the end of the lesson, as he waited for everyone to leave, he noticed Cho hanging back.
“...Alright, good,” Lucius nodded. He stood up. “I will leave you to it, then. Come down early for your Christmas presents tomorrow.”
“We’ll have to stay for the wedding, or Mum’s going to be more mad than she already is,” Ron sighed in response. He turned to Hermione, who put a hand on his thigh. They were seated on the floor of Ron’s room.
“I’m not going to leech off of my boyfriend’s money,” he shook his head. “Thanks for your concerns, guys, but it’s okay.”
Draco gulped, avoiding his eyes. “I just… it feels quite horrible to be on the side that wants your boyfriend killed. And I can’t do much to stop it. I feel useless. Please, Harry, whatever happens, I didn’t have much of a choice, okay?”
He scoffed in disbelief. “It was stupid coming to you. Crush? As if,” he stood up. “I’m going to bed. Goodnight.”
“Harry, dear, it’s so great to see you!” Molly said as she gushed, hugging him tightly before slowly pulling away, smiling softly as she turned to see Draco awkwardly standing there.
ruined absolutely everything!” Harry screamed, turning, getting out his wand and pointing it at Draco. Draco now sensed that Harry was about to do something. He lowered his wand.
“I know what today is,” he groaned, sitting up, but avoiding her gaze, pulling at the loose sleeves of his sweater as he hid the letter under his covers. Ron entered slowly after. With both their eyes on him, he stood up, trying to keep on a brave face. “I…”
“Come on, I need more than that. What happened?” Pansy asked, patting the bed, indicating for him to sit down. Draco rolled his eyes but sat down anyways.
Harry said nothing. This is what pained Draco even more. He put a hand to his left arm, where is Dark Mark was.
The room expanded and Harry got his wand ready. It had been two months since he had been practicing duelling without his hearing aids, and he felt more comfortable already, but that was because he knew Draco was deliberately trying to take it easy on him. Well, that was the price for being taught by your boyfriend.
Pushing him gently back on the couch, Draco kissed him on the lips finally, his hands wandering down, slipping into Harry’s trousers, who let out a soft, low moan. “I have to go after this.”
Despite the usual hostility Draco was used to, he found that they had perhaps made a little progress. He wasn’t sure what exactly it was they were working towards, but he realized he was curious to find out.
“I don’t open for another two hours,” Harry stated, looking at his watch that read 7 A.M. “What brings you guys here?”
he knew. He was more worried about what was happening. “I just knew,” was all he said. “What’s wrong? Is he okay? Have you heard from him?”
The two stared at each other for a few moments. Draco looked down at his hands, chewing on the inside of his cheek.
“That’s great,” Harry said to Ginny. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances. “Oh, er… I mean… if you’re unhappy then sure.” Harry nudged Hermione, implying that he didn’t know how to give her advice. Hermione rolled her eyes and started whispering to Ginny, trying to give her advice.
“Sorry,” Harry said. “Okay, at least we know to be careful now. I really don’t want to break up with you.” Harry snuggled up against Draco, closing his eyes and feeling his warmth.
What he felt for Harry was unlike anything before, which was probably why it frightened him even more. He didn’t want the first person he actually liked to be in danger all because of him and his family. He knew his upcoming responsibilities and didn’t want to hurt Harry. But… what if Pansy was right? What if he would be missing out on something great? What if he didn’t
“I could be bisexual,” Draco said, but both of them knew it wasn’t true. “I don’t want to be with you anymore. If you truly loved me, you would respect that. Now, please respect my wishes.”
Another meeting as the summer came to end and autumn began. This time, Draco was forced to join the meeting.
Harry stretched his back and took off his hearing aids then got into bed with Draco, who slung an arm over him. And, honestly, while he knew this year wasn’t going to go well at all, it was still nice to forget about that when he was in Draco’s arms, feeling his soft breath on his shoulder as he fell asleep. He could pretend that they weren’t on opposites of a war, and better - he could pretend, in the proximity of this room, that he wasn’t Harry Potter, with the weight of the Wizarding World on his shoulders, but just Harry Potter, a stupid boy in love with another boy.
Who was he fucking kidding? He loved Harry. He wanted to hold Harry, or he wanted Harry to hold him. He wanted to kiss Harry until his lips ached, love him until there was no love left - but there’s always love left. Always for Harry.
“Come closer, Draco, dear,” Bellatrix said softly, taking his hand and pulling him closer to Harry. Draco kneeled too, finally letting himself look at him. “Is it him? Is it Harry Potter?”
The green-eyed boy left the closet with hair looking like he just got out of bed, followed by the silver-eyed boy whose tie was loosened and uniform was all crumpled up.
“Shut up, you’re worse than me, you know. ‘No we did not! I did not kiss anyone!’” Harry imitated Draco, laughing. Draco glared at him.
“Harry, bud? You know how the streak in your hair was turning brown?” Ron asked, grimacing slightly, but also somewhat amused. “Yeah, um…” he gestured to his hair, shrugging.
“How lovely of you to have me, Sir,” Harry replied, trying his best to sound genuine. Draco mentally cringed.
“It’s doing well, yeah,” he nodded, taking a sip from his drink, his eyes moving to Astoria. “I don’t think we’ve actually formally met, Astoria. I’m Harry.” He leaned forward to shake her hand.
“I’m fine,” he shook his head. His mouth was dry and his chest was aching for something; anything to fill the emptiness. Was it Cedric? Or was it Harry’s inability to save him? Either way, he couldn’t deny it. Cedric was gone because of him. “We don’t need to talk about it.”
Harry nodded, sitting on the bed stiffly, watching his best friend leave the room, only to hear some muffled noises outside. “Malfoy, don’t go inside. Seriously! Can’t you see that you’re hurting him?”
Harry finished off his dinner and stood up while catching Draco’s eye. He got up and slowly left for the Owlery.
p.s. thank you all for the love and support. It really boosts my confidence and gives me inspiration to write.
And now, as he felt Harry snuggling up close to him, opening up his book again and occasionally just leaning forwards and pecking him on the cheek…
He gulped, then looked down, chuckling slightly. “Just because I said it that day doesn’t mean you have to say it too.”
He opened the letter, rolling his eyes at the corny poem as Snape started the lesson. Harry was having a hard time paying attention. It was hard to keep up with him while taking notes at the same time. Despite the notes being on the board, Snape did like to add detail while speaking and Harry was no where near perfect at lip reading yet, not that Snape was trying his best to make sure he understood.
Hermione and Pansy walked outside to the lake, both of them were silent. There was nothing other than the sounds of their boots against the hard ground. It was a gloomy day with a deathly serious atmosphere.
“Oh, that’s awesome, Hermione. Show me what it is when you get back.” Harry replied with a smile. He was in a good mood today. Obviously, because he got to hang out with Draco.
“Ah well, I hoped that not showing up would please him dearly,” Draco muttered to himself. Lucius didn’t hear what he said properly and decided to ignore it.
Harry groaned, looking over at the piece of paper Draco was writing in. “Another poem?” He stood up quickly and walked so he could read it over his shoulder, knowing rather well he could’ve just picked it up.
“You’re really committed to learning this for some relative you don’t even know that well,” Harry commented, taking the book from his hands checking out which page he was on. “Oh, come on, this is easy.”
It seemed like opening the window didn’t help; the room was still boiling hot. It was hotter outside than it was inside.
“I dunno… I feel his pain sometimes… and it hurts so much,” he whispered. “And it’s not the same with Astoria, because… she and I both know we don’t love each other, it’s just…” he buried his face in his hands, groaning loudly. “I miss him.”
“Oh, yes. Just use your wand, like you did with Draco.” A voice inside his head said revoltingly. Harry lowered his wand, his hand trembling, his face going blank. He turned and threw his wand on his bed.
“This is the easiest sentence. And the most important,” he rolled his eyes. Draco watched as he signed while speaking, amazed. He had only. “‘My name is Draco’. You need to finger spell your name. Look at me again.”
Draco tilted his head, eyes filled with concern. “It’s not yours either, okay? Like you said before, this is all bigger than us,” he brought Harry into his arms, who had tears streaming down his face again.
“I just… it’s different around my house. At Malfoy Manor, everything’s lonely. Most of the time it’s just three people in their own parts of the manor. I’ve had my own wing ever since I was old enough to find my way around. Ever since then, I was distanced. Well, it wasn’t as if we were exactly all close.
“Trust me, it wouldn’t be us,” Hermione said. She and Pansy high-fived. Draco found himself chuckling.
“What is all this about?” Draco said as he entered Malfoy Manor in a hurry, frowning when he noticed his father standing in the living room, facing the fireplace. “You said it was an emergency, but everything’s fine? I had to Apparate from Hogwarts-”
“Potter,” Draco repeated agitatedly, catching up with him. He tugged at his robe. Startled, Harry turned around, then cursed under his breath. “Look at this,” he signed.
“Don’t be so stupid, Harry. I can’t be displaying it,” he quickly reached for his sweater again, but Harry grabbed his arms. “Stop it. I only took my sweater off for a moment.”
“Well… you know… he’s not always like that,” Draco mumbled, not noticing Harry’s clenched fists. Draco stared down intently at his textbook, not wanting to face Harry.
“You literally show up in the Daily Prophet every week. You’re not a topic of conversation because of me,” he said quickly, rolling his eyes.
“At least tell me,” Harry was saying, hot tears running down his face, his vision slightly blurry, “is it because of the Boggart?”
“You’re only fifteen, Harry, you can’t expect yourself to be fully equipped to fight a bunch of dangerous adults part of a cult,” he answered, then gasped. “Shit fucking fuck, it’s a cult, and I have to join it soon!”
“Is that really how I’m supposed to spend the rest of my fucking life?” Harry snapped, stopping. “Asking my friends how to pronounce spells?”
His hands trembled, almost aching to reach out to the brown-haired man in front of him. His heart heavy, he gulped, looking straight ahead. “Whoever you end up with is lucky.”
“For fuck’s sake,” he whispered under his breath as Snape practically dragged him to where Draco was standing, who looked up, raising an eyebrow as he looked at both of them.
“Yeah, we wouldn’t have to if you didn’t declare me your sworn enemy in first year,” Harry rolled his eyes, but he was blushing. “Come on, then,” he said, leaning forward, his lips mashing against Draco’s, as if the kiss from a moment ago wasn’t enough. He felt Draco smile into the kiss, both pulling away to catch their breaths.
“You do realize that, if I had said anything to you, both of us would have been killed? No, even worse, you wouldn’t have even listened even if I told you.”
“I could,” he whispered. Harry blinked in surprise. He wasn’t expecting that response. “I could help you with what you’re doing. Then I wouldn’t feel so guilty for each way I’m hurting you. And we could be together everyday.”
As he entered, he mumbled a quick ‘hey’, making his way to the table and dropping his bag on the ground. Taking a seat, he flinched when Draco slammed his hands on the table, forcing Harry to look at him.
As they left, Ginny deciding to tag along, Harry chewed on the inside of his lip nervously, fiddling with the piece of paper in his pocket. “You okay?” Ginny said as she tugged on his sweater gently. Hermione and Ron were bickering again, and Harry wasn’t too bothered trying to lip read their conversation.
He smiled. “I know. That’s what I like about you. You know… I really am grateful for you sometimes.”
Draco shrugged, and the other started walking, leading him up the stairs. They made their way to the Room of Requirement. He could feel tears threatening his eyes again, but tried to hold them back as Harry sat him down on the couch, rubbing his hand up and down Draco’s back.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but the chattering was dying down so all he could slip out was a venomous “Potter.” and had to glare at him. Harry glared right back, and then the two put their hands under the table, Harry putting his hand right on top of Draco’s which was resting on his thigh.
“Well… it’s not like we actually were in a serious relationship - I mean, to others, yes, but… well, you know. Besides, I’m not going to stand in the way of you and the person you really love.”
“Run along, now.” Draco pushed Harry in the direction of the Gryffindor Tower, not giving him time to ask him anything. Harry, confused, walked to his dorm as Draco told him to do so.
“...it was stupid to let myself start liking him, wasn’t it? I was stupid,” he mumbled, resting his head against the window as he watched the mountains. “Of all the people, I had to go for the person that I’m supposed to hate the most. It was dumb.”
“I thought you wanted to go back to the cliff tomorrow and do some broom riding,” Draco replied, frowning. He wasn’t sure of what to think of the sudden subject change.
Harry stood in front of the mirror, fixing his sweater and tie, and running a hand through his hair to fix it. He then noticed that in one small part of his hair, the roots were greyish-white.
He thought about it for a moment. “No. I didn’t. He never said anything to me,” he answered, looking away from her.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said finally, unsure if there was really anything else worth saying. “Draco, I don’t know what I’d do with myself if Voldemort uses you to get to me. Whether you do it voluntarily or not; that’s not the point.”
Draco felt his chest tighten as he shut the door behind him. His father had seen him. There was no way Draco would be able to leave without Lucius stopping him now.
They lasted in silence for about ten minutes, until Harry looked up to see him gazing frustratedly down at the book, shaking his head. “Do you need help?” he asked.
“Fuck you, Draco,” Harry was saying, “Fuck you. Get out of the fucking room, please just open the door, so we can talk. Please just let me see you. Please just let me apologize. You don’t have to forgive me. This is getting tiring. Everyone’s so worried, you know that? Not just me. If not for me, please just come outside for everyone else.”
“Are you talking about Cho?” Harry raised an eyebrow, moving forward and sitting down beside him on the couch. “...so you
“I don’t know… I guess seeing him was more overwhelming that I thought it would be,” he muttered, turning to his reflection, staring at the streak in his hair that was starting to turn darker.
***EDIT: I CHANGED HARRY’S ANSWER PLEASE REREAD THE “SHOP” SCENE IF YOU READ IT BEFORE! I decided things were moving too fast so they’re gonna take some time***
“Just wait.” Harry took out concealer and started dabbing over it with a makeup sponge. After about five minutes, Draco’s Dark Mark had vanished.
“I’ve watched you talk about Harry for the past six years. And although everyone thought you just hated him, I knew better. I’ve known you for a long time. The only time there’s a glint in your eyes is when you’re thinking, talking or around Harry.”
Harry gave an expression as if to say ‘fine, whatever’, and Ron got up to leave the room. Hermione gazed at Harry, concern written all over her face. He avoided her eyes, glancing down at the watch on his wrist that vibrated. Draco was trying to communicate again. Unable to shake off the uneasy feeling of missing him, he decided he should probably let Draco know he was safe.
“I’m not going into bed with you! Didn’t I just tell you? I have a boyfriend!” Harry protested loudly, which instantly made Draco actually feel relieved that there was loud Muggle music playing and people couldn’t hear him.
On the sixth day, Harry came storming down the hallway, banging on the door, kicking and trying to open it by twisting and turning the knob.
“Oh shut up, I’m not cute. If anything, you’re the cute one.” Draco teased back. “Messy hair, round glasses? Cute.”
Harry was about to say no - he didn’t need to associate himself with Draco on top of everything that was going on. But he had a moment of weakness staring into his eyes. Draco, for once, seemed vulnerable - helpless, even. Harry knew exactly how that felt. He turned, making his way to the door, but at the last second, he turned, shaking his head in disbelief, almost as if he didn’t believe what he was about to say.
With a soft kiss, Harry pulled away, shaking off the sentimentalities and sitting down on the couch, adjusting his glasses. “Enough. I don’t want to be sad.”
He pushed the thought away. Draco was too young to become a Death Eater anytime soon, and just because of the Malfoys’ beliefs, it didn’t mean he would follow them. But… it wasn’t as if he wouldn’t.
Draco took a sip of the lemonade, his eyes widening at how good it tasted. He looked up at her after a moment, trying to process what she said. “Uh… what are you trying to tell me? That I should live with you?”
“Who would you go to, then? Viktor Krum?” he scoffed. Hermione glared at him, and Harry now looked back down at his work, shaking his head.
“You didn’t see the message, did you?” Ron rolled his eyes. “Malfoy wants to see you in the Astronomy Tower at midnight.”
“Give me Harry Potter, and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.
On Wednesday evening, Harry found himself making his way to the wing, rather uneasy. He hadn’t gotten a poem from Draco the past two days, which made him think that maybe Draco was really sick.
“Mr. Potter, you don’t take me for a fool, do you?” Snape asked icily. “Please come to the front of the class to sit beside Malfoy.”
“Take it, Harry,” Draco whispered. Harry hesitantly took it and stood up, quickly walking over to Dobby.
“This is not a gift exchange sort of thing. I don’t want anything, nor do I expect you to give me something in return. I gave this to you because you’re my boyfriend and you deserve to be treated with love at random times by me.” Draco cut him off. All Harry could do was giggle slightly. “What? Did I say something funny?”
“Oh, as if you’d be any better,” Harry replied. “You’d have died right at the beginning of the Forbidden Forest if it weren’t for me.”
He stopped talking as soon as he saw Draco standing in the doorway. Turning back around, he continued to stock the shelves.
“Hey Draco,” Harry greeted, not looking up from the book he was reading. He was huddled up in blankets on the couch.
Then he dragged Draco into a closet and they had a heated make-out session. Harry pulled at Draco’s collar and even bit at his neck.
“Yes,” Draco whispered hotly, which made Harry practically pounce back on Draco, carefully unbuttoning his silk shirt, then he slowly slipped off Draco’s pants, slowly trailing his hand on his inner thighs, teasing him slightly, before touching-
And Harry was back for a sixth year at Hogwarts. Only this time, he was almost sent back to London because of Draco Malfoy.
“I’m sorry, but it looks really bad! I like your hair like this,” Harry reached forward and ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, who glared at him, but didn’t push him away, trying not to smile.
“It’s Ron’s birthday,” he said. “I was planning on celebrating with our dorm mates, then sneaking away, but… this girl put a love potion in these chocolates meant for me, and Ron ate them. It was a huge mess. We ended up in Slughorn’s office, and he gave Ron an antidote. Then-”
“Barty Crouch Jr.,” Harry corrected. “How would you rate my dancing skills on a scale from one to ten?”
After breakfast, Harry, Ron and Hermione all went up to his room. Ron frowned. “The hearing aids could work,” he said.
“Just stop, Hermione, please!” Harry shouted, stepping forwards, pointing his wand right at her, the wand only centimeters away from her chin.
“Yes, Harry, I’m a part-time construction worker. I go and construct buildings for the Muggles.” Draco answered sarcastically, receiving a smack from Harry. “I just have some school work that I’m behind on.”
Growing impatient and worry spiraling his thoughts, he stood up and walked towards the shelves, tracing his index finger down the spines of a few of the books.
“You will not believe the night I’ve had, Draco, so please,” he flopped down on the couch, shutting his eyes. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I know you had a good lesson planned for us today.”
“Well… I was just watching how Draco was trying not to cry, and how he was shaking as he pointed his wand at Dumbledore…”
“It’s just refreshing to see you like this. Not fueled by hatred for Potter, for whatever it is. You know you haven’t ranted about him - or anyone from that friend group - for two weeks now? It’s a record, really.”
“So she should maybe ask you for advice?” Harry asked reasonably. “I can’t give advice for my life! Especially dating advice!”
“Shut up, Ron,” he rolled his eyes, trying to hide his smile. He looked ahead to see Draco seated. The two made eye contact, and for a brief moment, Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He gulped, then looked away quickly, smiling again as he walked past the blond, who was also trying not to smile.
“Well… alright then.” Hermione replied, admitting she was wrong. Ron absentmindedly wrapped an arm around her shoulders. Harry immediately smirked but hid it with his book, pretending to be reading intently.
“Harry, don’t take me for a fool,” Hermione assured him. “When you wake up tomorrow morning, you’re letting me know what happened.”
“How are you?” Harry asked, his words slightly slurred. It seemed as if Harry lost his stubbornness and was finally talking to Draco - well, it was more that Harry was too drunk to recognize Draco, and thought that the white-haired male beside him was someone else.
“Good morning,” The two muttered, smiling sheepishly, sitting down on the couch beside Hermione. Luna and Pansy were seated on the floor and Ron was sitting on a beanbag.
“She’s got game,” Pansy shrugged, putting a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. He rolled his eyes at her. “You have to give her that. But I wouldn’t be too disappointed. He clearly doesn’t like her."
And he was. The door opened and he entered. His face was pale, and he looked exhausted, but he was smiling, and for the first time in a while, it didn’t look forced.
He threw his hands in the air, shaking his head. “Back to my dorm. I don’t want to be around you right now.”
“You’re so fucking dramatic,” Harry rolled his eyes, but he was grinning. He stood up, watching Draco adjust his watch, trying to resist the urge to kiss him. He couldn’t believe all it took was one night for all the feelings to come back like an adrenaline rush. “I’ll owl you.”
“Er…. yeah, maybe,” Draco stuttered, moving away from Harry who attempted to touch his hair. “Listen, I know you’re probably super tempted to touch me, but we have to stay apart.”
He was wearing a maroon sweater and jeans. His eyes were greener than usual. Draco put a hand to the waistband of his trousers to check if his shirt was tucked in properly, gulping.
? My bad, let me just leave you to thinking those thoughts to just yourself, then,” Harry suddenly snapped. There had been a good moment of silence before Harry had spoken up.
Draco scoffed at that but went to change anyways. He came out of the bathroom to see Pansy holding a basket.
“Hey, Draco, you’ve been to New York, haven’t you?” Pansy said, bringing back to the moment. He blinked, frowning as he looked over to Ron, Hermione, and Harry who were all staring at him.
They had no time to say anything else. The rest of the Death Eaters arrived. Harry wished he hadn’t been wearing his hearing aids for this. Draco kept his wand up and was mostly silent, but had a sneer on his face. Harry had to admit, he was good at pretending. It almost fooled him. But between the rough exchanges between everyone, as Snape raised his wand, Draco dropped his hand almost immediately, as if he was relieved. But he couldn’t hide his frown as Snape killed Dumbledore right before him.
Days were idle. They seemed to pass by without significant events. Draco would rarely go out unless necessary for his job, which he found himself putting less and less effort into by the day. Even Pansy’s comment didn’t sting too much. He could practically feel his emotions fading day by day.
“What’s going on?” Hermione asked as she poked her head round the door, confused. She stared at the scene before her, then shook her head, going back inside the living room. Harry and Ron followed suit, sitting down beside each other.
“Draco,” Harry had managed to choke out, “what if it i...isn’t?” Draco looked up at Hermione and Ron, a panicked expression on his face. He felt his shirt dampening as Harry buried his face into Draco’s chest.
“I’m not-” Noticing his expression, Harry’s eyes darkened. He folded his arms. “What do you want me to say? That I’m having nightmares of someone who died because of me? Because it was my fault? Or do you want to know about the visions I’ve been getting? Talking about isn’t going to help me.”
The three heard a muffled yell below them. Draco glanced over his shoulder, trying to listen to more of the fight. He found himself hoping that Harry wasn’t in the middle of it.
After some conversation with Luna and the others, they realized it was probably time to make rounds - which was probably the con of showing up late to a party. They were fine to talk to everyone, but all three of them were somewhat dreading going to Draco, Pansy, and Astoria.
hii i'm back!! sorry for the short chapter but i just wanted one out there asap. hope you enjoyed xx
He made it back to his hotel room, checking the time - it was two in the morning. He changed into his night clothes, staring at the silk pajamas in his suitcase. Walking into the bathroom, he gazed at the silver streak in his hair which was turning darker and darker, back to his original hair color. Harry didn’t know if he was relieved or surprised. Perhaps both.
“I can’t breathe,” Draco told Harry dramatically. Harry rolled his eyes and slowly sat up, letting go of Draco, who gave Harry a very offended look.
“Special does not mean five layers,” Draco said, but grinned when Pansy cut him a piece of cake and handed it to him. He took a bite, letting the sweet yet somewhat bitter taste of the dark chocolate dissolve in his tongue. “This is pretty good.”
“Please stand up. Someone switch seats with Mr. Potter.” Snape looked around the classroom. Harry, confused, slowly stood up.
“I heard your argument with Hermione,” Draco said, clearing his throat -  he had gotten lost in Harry’s eyes. “I don’t think you should blame her for what happened. She and Pansy are ridiculous, but… I’m sure they just meant well.”
“Whatever works for you,” Harry said with a laugh, leaning over and kissing Draco on the lips deeply, then slowly taking the shirt and putting it on, then taking off his pants to put on the silk ones, bending over to pick it up when it slipped from his hands.
Handing the hearing aid back to Harry, she eyed Draco suspiciously. “...well, I suppose dating Malfoy has its perks.”
?” He scoffed, waving away the treat Crabbe offered him. “Seriously. It’s definitely all just an act to make people gain sympathy for him. I don’t believe it one bit.”
“Both?” Harry answered, his eyes boring into Draco’s, his face all serious suddenly. “Today marks one month,” he whispered. “I didn’t want to say anything, but… it’s not fair. We made an agreement.”
“Luna, Nargles aren’t real,” Hermione said with a slight chuckle, seeming as if she had been aching to say that. “I don’t know where you came up with them, but they’re.
Stroking his thumb over the phone, he quickly turned it off and placed it underneath his clothes again, shutting the closet door, quickly picking up a piece of paper. Harry hadn’t shown up to the Weasley Christmas dinner last year (he didn’t go either, but got a letter from Molly saying it was a shame the two couldn’t make it).
“It’s okay,” he shook his head. “I understand the pressure you must be feeling right now. But, darling, you know the rule is there for a reason.”
Because though meant it, he knew he wasn’t being loyal. He had no choice but to lie to the one person he trusted the most.
Two weeks passed. Every day felt like a constant argument with himself, trying to come up with reasonable explanations for why Draco had broken up with him, only to end up blaming himself.
Exiting Harry’s store which was in Diagon Alley, they went through what felt like every single store, finding gifts for everyone. At one point, they even left Diagon Alley and went to some Muggle mall that Hermione knew of. Ever since graduating from Hogwarts, Harry had kept somewhat of a balance between his wizard and Muggle life. He had opened a store that sold books and potions. He was too uninterested in getting a job at the Ministry of Magic, where Ron and Hermione both worked. Harry had also dyed the streak of white hair back to brown.
“You can use this room for whatever you need. It can change depending on who’s asking for it. I said I needed a place to talk to you privately, so this room came. Not sure what the books are for,” Harry explained, sitting down on the chair.
“Hm?” He looked back at Pansy who placed a hand on his arm. “You never told us what happened on that date.”
“Just…” Harry repeated, unable to finish his sentence. He turned around and walked, the pain in his chest hurting so, so much.
But of course, it was completely different. She didn’t have the same passion; she didn’t have the same emotion; she didn’t have the same lips. Nothing about her was suitable for him. And that’s why he pulled away from Ginny.
Harry did not remember falling asleep. He only remembered being back in Grimmauld Place, being woken by the ghost of a kiss that he could feel on his cheek. The pain of being apart from Draco was still there, but it was less. That was a start.
Harry took out his hearing aids quickly. “Goodnight, Draco,” he mumbled, kissing Draco’s cheek gently, pulling his hand away. He picked up his stuff and quickly left, leaving Draco alone in the room with the sudden tension, the deafening silence, and his own thoughts.
“Alright, alright, I’m sorry,” Pansy said, running after him down the hallway, her heels echoing. “Didn’t mean to hurt your feelings or something.”
“Then he was right to break up with you. Of course, the way he handled the situation was horrible and childish, but I’m sure his intentions were good. He just didn’t want you to be hurt.”
“I agree. Take your time, Harry. And I understand that you might not be able to come to a decision even on his wedding day.”
Harry tried not to smile, staring down at the three cards he had left, lips twitching in amusement. “And I…” he sighed, setting down a plus four card, “am not sorry either.
“Do you?” Draco whispered, pulling Harry onto his lap, a frown on his face. “Even if I may not be the best person?
There was a sort of party going on today since it was a Professor’s birthday, so that’s where everyone was going to be for the rest of the night.
“I understand, but… why do you want to be with me again? I… I’m not the same person I was from two years ago.”
Draco drew in a sharp breath. “Merlin, not everything is about you, Harry!” Draco grumbled. Any love they had in their eyes when they stared at each other, was gone. Now it was just daggers, glaring and frowns at each other.
Harry facepalmed, watching as the two entered the living room. Everyone stood in silence before he cleared his throat awkwardly. “Bye,” he said, making his way to the door.
“Prat,” Draco said with an eye roll. “Hey, it’s getting late and everyone’s heading to their dorms, and the Dementors and Filch will probably see us. Want to just sneak out and go for a walk on Saturday? It’ll be our first date, and I’ll bring some snacks..." Draco paused before getting embarrassed. "Unless you don’t want-”
“No, no,” he shook his head. “You’re not going to turn this around on me.” he shut his eyes for a moment, then opened them to look at her. “How long have you known?”
Harry felt Draco shaking - he had still been holding Draco - and he turned to face him, slightly worried, but was relieved to see that Draco was laughing. “You all are so lame.”
A few months passed. Draco had less and less time and seemed more stressed every time Harry saw him, but there was nothing he could do. All he did was kiss Draco, hold him close. Sometimes he would whisper that everything was going to be okay. He noticed Draco needed to hear that a lot.
Lucius mumbled a spell and cast it on Draco before the silver-eyed boy could think; before he could move out of the way. It was a purple; large spell and seemed to loom over Draco before practically going inside of his body.
broke up with me when things got too complicated. How can I forgive that? The way he left me in the dust, making me think that I was the problem?”
Draco noticed how his mother didn’t assume that it was a girl, and how she remained careful with the pronouns. Narcissa reached out and took his hand, squeezing it gently before standing up.
His face turned pink. “For the last time, you need to stop looking at our letters! That’s private stuff!”
“Yes.” Draco and Harry said at the same time, cutting Ron off, before turning back to each other. “I don’t know… I do think it’s a good idea to go home for Christmas, but I don’t think I can stay at Malfoy Manor for the whole-”
Draco rolled his eyes, feeling himself grow impatient. “You can’t do that anymore. You’re already so behind on your studies. Am I supposed to help you with homework or help you understand the concepts?"
After a while of studying and Harry asleep on him, Draco slowly packed his things and carried Harry down to his dorm before slipping into his own.
He stared out the window, up into the sky. The atmosphere was cold, empty. He turned back to the empty paper and starting writing. Pouring his heart and soul, furiously writing away. He didn’t even notice when Narcissa slowly opened the door and called out his name.
Draco was only half-listening, too busy paying attention to Harry’s hands as they stroked the page, gulping. This was weird. A bit too weird. It was mostly the weird feeling in his chest that was putting him off.
“Draco,” She sighed, almost in a disappointed tone, but she didn’t say anything further. She knew it was better to just nod along with his rants about Harry. He was impossible to reason with once he had his mind made up about him.
Draco stared down at the book in disbelief, shutting it before he could read any further. This had to be a practical joke or something of the sort. Everything was so specific, so… detailed. Draco quickly ran over to the mirror in his room, staring at the streak in his hair.
Cho stared at him now, wide-eyed. “That’s exactly it,” she whispered. “You’re… a good teacher, you know.”
“Well, we walked past the whole Forbidden Forest and there was this empty area with just grass all around. We sat down there and ate the Muggle snacks you gave me. You put in a Muggle device on purpose, didn’t you?”
“Harry,” Draco said breathlessly, panting heavily. Draco's silver eyes were glistening with tears, the brown streak in his hair shining, pushing his trunk to the side and practically running to Harry, wrapping his arms around him.
“Potter,” Draco whispered right in Harry’s ear, making him shudder. The two looked around to see if anyone was in the hallway. Seeing no one, Draco dragged Harry into a nearby broom closet. Draco turned the light on and smiled at Harry.
Draco, who was sitting in bed, WSL book in his hands, was taken aback when he saw him standing by his bed, frowning. “Potter,” he said. “What are you doing here? Got yourself injured again or something?”
“Draco!” Narcissa Malfoy smiled as she noticed the two enter, pulling Draco into a tight hug. Anyone could tell how desperately she seemed to hug her son. Harry found it sweet. Narcissa turned to Harry, her smile widening. “Oh, Harry, I’ve been waiting so long to see you.”
“Just butterbeer, thanks,” he signed back, looking back at Draco, who had now turned back to his friends. They sat down a few booths down from the three Slytherins. Harry sat down, then looked up, noticing that he and Draco could see each other perfectly. They made eye contact again, both awkwardly raising their eyebrows, as if they were unsure of what to say.
“I’d tell them that a Malfoy wouldn’t ever say such an absurd statement, and they should get their ears checked,” he held his wand up. “Is Harry safe?”
Harry sat in the hospital wing, watching as Lavender came all over Ron (who was sleeping and had no idea what was going on). Then Hermione came and took a hold of Ron’s hand. Harry found it cute and all, but he really just missed Draco.
Their eyes met, and Draco forgot what he was supposed to do. He instantly just found himself staring at Harry’s cute face as he pouted slightly (he was upset that Draco was enjoying himself without Harry) and continued staring at Draco.
“I’m not happy,” Draco said before he could stop himself. “I imagined the rest of my life with you. Now I have to spend it with some… some woman. We don’t love each other. Not in the slightest.”
“You’re impossible to talk to,” Harry said with a bitter laugh. “This isn’t about me kissing Ginny. This is about you betraying me.”
“No, I don’t,” Draco shook his head, curling his lip in disgust, “because I’m considerate of your situation. But why should I care about this so much if you clearly can’t trust me?”
“Breakfast is about to be over in five minutes, just wait a bit, Draco,” Pansy said with an eye roll. “But oh, what can you do. Love is hard to handle, I understand.”
“Can’t be as slow as me trying to learn sign language,” he shrugged, and the two shared a small smile. “Just have a list of things you need help with ready.”
Draco and Harry had just Apparated right outside The Burrow, and Draco was tightly clutching Harry’s hand, frowning deeply. Much to no one’s surprise, Draco decided to leave the iPhone back at Grimmauld Place until, as he quote on quote said, ‘decided it was worthy of his trust’. Harry thought it was cute how he was scared of such a little device like that, but he was probably the only one on Earth who could find Draco’s constant shrieking as soon as something on the phone happened cute.
Harry looked around the Great Hall, making eye contact with Pansy who bit her lip and stared back at him with a grave look on her face.
Harry sat down on the floor, too worried his knees would give away. “War… war-” he gulped, trying to blink away tears. He knew this already. Why did it hurt so much to hear from Draco? “But…"
The nervousness was starting to affect Draco, so he cupped Harry’s face gently. “I’m really sorry. But I think you need to be prepared for this, okay?” he said in a quiet voice, gently pressing his lips against Harry’s cheek, who nodded, then moved to the table to take off his hearing aids.
“You say that with such a gloom on your face. Is it another Death Eater meeting?” Draco asked quietly. Narcissa slowly nodded, her blue eyes sparkling, with an emotion that Draco couldn’t read. Then, she turned and left, leaving her son to his thoughts.
“Yeah, he kept talking about you the first few days. Don’t even get me started on the stupid rumors floating around because of him.”
“Shut up and open it,” Draco ordered, still managing to seem sweet as he said it. Harry slowly opened the box and inside were silk pajamas. Harry slowly took one set out and looked at it.
This summer was different than most. Harry had spent all his summer at The Burrow with Ron, and even Hermione joined after a few weeks. It was rough to not see Draco, but they always sent letters back and forth.
“What is this, an interrogation?” Harry replied with an eye roll. “I sat down because I got hurt by the fall.” He lied.
“Harry, how was the detention? What did Snape make you do?” Hermione asked as Ginny quickly took a step back from Harry.
In the Gryffindor Common Room, Hermione studied Harry’s blank expression as he sat in front of the fireplace. “Mione, I’m deaf, not blind. Why are you staring at me?”
“Oh, that… that was stupid. And weirdly emotional. I wrote it at like two a.m. so don’t even think about it-”
“Yes, probably. Draco said he wants to continue helping me with my skills, so… I think that’s good.”
“You love me, really,” Pansy said as she stuck her tongue out at Draco, who simply scoffed. “Oh please, if it weren’t for me, you and Harry probably wouldn’t have even gotten together!”
So when he entered the DADA lesson, he slowly walked up to the front of the class, throwing his textbooks on the table and sat right beside Draco, using his hands as a pillow and placing his head on it, closing his eyes drowsily.
“Now what?” Draco asked in a whisper. A startled Harry looked up from the direction of the noise but went back to taking off his hoodie. He lied down on the bed, staring up at the ceiling.
The Slytherin half-heartedly swayed with the music, looking down at the boy in front of him, who was grinning like an idiot. “God, Potter,” he shook his head, trying to keep a somewhat composed face, “you’re getting all of the beats wrong!”
“What happened to, ‘the last seven years of my life have been way too eventful. I’m going to live a quiet life from now on’?” Ron questioned, chuckling.
“Draco,” Harry said when he saw Draco entering the Eight-Year Common Room. An even darker feeling than before had hit Harry’s chest, making him wonder what was wrong.
“You have customers waiting,” Hermione said, taking the potion from Ron’s hand. The two marveled at the little bottle. Harry’s eyes moved to the rings on their fingers. The wedding day of his best friends was the best day of his life, but also the most painful. Seeing the rings, he thought of his promise ring, which was hidden in a small box somewhere in his closet, far out of sight.
“You can’t possibly-” she was saying, then groaned when Harry just turned away from her, digging into his breakfast. She was reminded the entirety of last year, when he would just look away any time he felt she was being too irritating. They ate in silence until he looked back up at her.
“Nothing, just… you should eat. You didn’t eat dinner last night either,” Ron said, using one hand to eat and the other to sign. Harry nodded, picking up the toast on his plate, taking his time.
“So June 30th?” Draco ran a hand through his hair, raising an eyebrow, shutting his book altogether. “I suppose that makes sense.”
“You’re my boyfriend, Harry, of course it’s my place,” he stated with a soft cry, trying to hide his face.
“You! And Malfoy! Malfoy! And you! Harry Potter, and Draco Malfoy! My best friend, and Draco Malfoy! My enemy, and my best friend!”
“You don’t get it. I spent so long feeling so horrible that I’ll never actually be able to hear your voice. I don’t need to know if it works or not,” he chewed on his lip, hands trembling as Draco gently handed it to him. “Draco, we don’t know if it’ll work. It was dark magic, whatever happened.”
Draco was wide awake, staring at the ceiling. His skin seemed dry, his lips were chapped. His chest was covered with the blanket, so Harry couldn’t see how he had been treated or anything. Harry stayed at the foot of the bed, simply staring at Draco.
Harry had tears streaming down his face as he slowly got his wand out, pointing at the Draco in front of him. “
face him, you always have your friends to help you. You know, Granger and the Weasleys, and Dumbledore too… For me, it isn’t like that.”
“Potter,” Draco said as he passed him just outside the Great Hall. “Ready for another year of being behind everyone else?”
“What the fuck?” he said a little too loudly, taking a few steps back. “And when you were planning on telling me this?”
