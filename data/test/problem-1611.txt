"He sounds like a prick, but can we not discuss vigilante justice against Muggles in front of an Auror-in-Training?" said Ron.
Harry waited for perhaps five seconds before his resolve broke.
"I'm fairly certain you're the worst Slytherin I know," she said. "But please, continue."
"The fireworks are a little premature," he murmured. Harry gave a breathy laugh in return.
"That was when I thought I'd never have to see him again!" protested Harry. McGonagall gave him a look.
Draco slid elegantly out of the back of the van and in front of Fish, who pulled him into a manly, back-slapping sort of hug. Harry ducked awkwardly behind Draco, taking up the ladle.
"Yes, I can't help but wonder the same myself," she said, twisting the toggle of her overcoat. "Do I care about justice and decency innately, or is it because my parents are compassionate people and nurtured that in me? Even if I do care innately, would I be brave enough to stand up to Voldemort? Would I even
"Wait," he said. "Look. Harry told me you tried to cast the Cruciatus on him once."
A long moment passed before Harry heard Malfoy's voice again, very quiet.
"Intriguing," said Malfoy, sitting up. "I wonder if there's a way to play CDs on the record player?"
"W-when — " stuttered Pansy, "We have had such different upbringings."
Then he called a house meeting.
"I don't think he knew," said Harry. "I don't think he believed it was going to be the death of him. He knew it was a risk, and he took it. Like a Slytherin. Like someone staring into an enemy's face, and taking a risk to pretend not to recognise them."

to say no. That little sliver of hope he'd given me, I didn't want it to die."
Harry sat up.
"I missed lunch," he said. "And I can't go to dinner. Could I possibly have–"
"Har har, no." Hermione rested one hip against the table, leaning the sandwich-filled hand on the table beside Ron. Ron took the opportunity to snatch it back from Hermione's loosened grip, grinning.
"This is wild," said Ginny, yanking the ladle out of Seamus's unwilling grip. "Draco Malfoy, drug addict. How did that even

Ron appeared in the dorm shortly after they arrived.
"Yes, well," she said. "The Statute —"
help someone now. Even if that someone is Malfoy."
"Funny way of showing it," said Harry, and couldn't stop the dark laugh that passed his lips.
"It IS you! Oh my God, it's Harry Potter! I knew it! Can I have your autograph? I'm such a big fan."
"Head up any resistance movements?" added Ginny, swiftly picking up on Seamus's track.
Harry, lost in thoughts of Malfoy apologies, wrenched his attention back into the room.
Andromeda placed Teddy carefully onto Harry's lap; Teddy blinked at him, sleepy-eyed and ruddy-cheeked, before resting his head on Harry's shoulder and sticking his thumb in his mouth.
"Did you find a potions-based solution for re-encoding, in the end?" enquired Draco.
"Great," said Harry, who'd felt less and less urge to lose himself in her kisses now that he knew he wasn't likely to die.
He wished he could ask his dad. Ginny seemed to follow his thought process, because she looked uneasy, like she was trying to think of what to say.
"What about his friends?" said Harry. "Why isn't he with them?"
he'd said to Blaise.
"Nearly," said Harry, kissing up Draco's jaw. "I tossed a coin."
"Exclusivity," said Luna slowly. "It's a strange concept, isn't it?"
them you made it," said Kreacher, crossing his bony arms. Harry covered his laugh with his hand.
"Okay," said Neville, sharp, "What do you want?"
"Right," said Harry, settling back onto the pouffe. Malfoy perched on the side of the bed. There was an awkward silence as he tried the curry, and Harry tried very hard
Dean pulled a sort of self-deprecating grimace.

"Sir –" said Malfoy, with barely contained venom.
"Oh, fantastic," said Malfoy, face twisting. "What, are you
finesse about it nowadays. Anyway, the point is. I would say all these rude things, and I get I was a gross little shit, but everyone else would laugh, and you wouldn't. I thought you just hated me. And then Ron clued me in that you weren't laughing because you were too busy worrying about whether to ask what a blowjob was."
Neville raised an eyebrow at him, but gestured up the stairs; Malfoy nodded, and followed him out of the kitchen like a man condemned.
"Don't call me that," he snarled. "Stop saying sorry. We're not friends. I don't owe you anything. And I don't
"Huh," said Malfoy, in the entrance hall. Harry took in his hallway as Malfoy would see it; the forest green wallpaper, the carefully restored Victorian furniture lit by softly glowing sconces, the gleaming mahogany of the staircase and the smell of warm wood polish. He realised he was unbelievably proud of what he'd achieved; a home, built out of the ashes of pain and darkness.
"Sounds like a good idea to me," he said. Hermione looked pleased, too; she wasn't the biggest fan of drinking games anyway, partly because of her natural reserve and partly because the first time she played Ring of Fire she spent the rest of the evening asking why the ceiling was spinning and then throwing up.
"There are a million ways to do good," said Draco, waving a hand. "I haven't figured out my way, yet, but I will. Something to do with the War Orphans' Fund, perhaps. I'd throw fundraisers, but I feel like my name is not the one they would like associated with their organisation…"
He was making himself a cup of tea in the kitchen when he heard the front door shut, and as he snuck up the kitchen stairs he told himself he
thing I thought you might want to talk about."
"Yeah," agreed Ginny, pulling a face, "I'm no fan of Malfoy, but what kind of person looks at a washed-up little snot like that and goes 'ooh, I know, let's give him some horrible Muggle poison drug'?"
"Yes please Harry, that'd be great," said Dean, politely ignoring his tone.
"Have you heard the Holyhead Harpies
The party was in full swing when he arrived at the. Someone was playing Christmas hits out of a tinny speaker, and the crowd were lingering in the cold this time, dancing and chatting rather than slipping away into the night. Marjorie and Barbara were handing out shoeboxes wrapped in cheap wrapping paper, and John was standing by the back of the van gesturing enthusiastically to the person inside.
Harry's eyes widened. An

people deserve," said Harry, "You can let yourself have that. Nothing more or less."
"But you said not to tell anyone, back when I was wearing that bloody deodorant. When you snogged me first."
Everyone looked at Luna, touched by this unexpected insight into her eccentric style. Harry took in her glittering silver pyjamas, her radish earrings, and then looked down at the catalogue. There were really only a few people he knew who dressed anything like what Harry thought of as
"Mr Malfoy, twenty points! If you have a problem with keeping your arguments out of my hearing, kindly remove yourself from my sight."
"I'll owl Gringotts now. And if you want to order anything for yourself, go for it. For your trouble."
"Well, this is nice," said Hermione from the doorway, seeing everyone clustered round the tea. She settled into the crook of Ron's arm. "Ooh, pink wafers, my favourite."
"If you
"First thing I thought of," he said. "Wanted to make it less weird in here. Went well, I reckon."
Malfoy rolled his head against the wall to look at Harry. Harry shook his head, hard. Malfoy's lip curled, disgusted, but Harry didn't think it was at him.
Harry pressed his lips together, hoping Fish was only being rhetorical and he wouldn't have to answer, but luckily Fish seemed happy to carry on.
"Perhaps pass training before you try to leverage," chided Malfoy. "I can handle her."
Harry leant against him for a long moment, catching his breath. It felt like Harry's weight might be the only thing holding him up.
"I haven't been hungry in a really long time," said Malfoy, still scowling at the food as though it had personally attacked him. "Possibly not since fifth year, if I'm honest. Don't look so worried, Potter, I am aware it continues to be necessary to eat regardless."
"You could take a bowl to his room?" offered Luna.
"Right," said Malfoy, looking past Harry to Dean. "Would somebody be so kind as to explain to me how the game works?"
Harry didn't hate her. She was entertaining, actually. She reminded him of a posh Ginny, sharp and a bit mean and a bit fun.
"That sucks," he said. "I think because people don't act so weird in the wizarding world and the Dursleys just tried to pretend I didn't exist, I've kind of been a bit… insulated from thinking about it."
On the first floor landing, someone had wound green bunting around the bannisters, and the corridor was filled with scattered balloons bouncing gently to themselves. The sound of the record player filtered out from the drawing room, and there were shrieks echoing up from the dining room already. Harry held on tightly to Luna as they entered the drawing room.
"It's alright," said Harry quickly, dying inside. "Don't mind him. It's this, er, light-hearted antagonism we've got going."
Malfoy's lips parted, eyes going wide and soft under Harry. Harry stared back, every muscle tensed in a paralysis of want. He couldn't, he
," muttered Malfoy. "I'll do the Mind Healing, but not the meetings."
"Sounds like your thing," said Harry, and he didn't mean it as an insult but Malfoy bristled.
Draco slumped back. Harry stretched out next to him, kicking off his shoes. Draco glanced at Harry's socked feet before copying the gesture, sending his boots and socks to arrange themselves neatly by the wardrobe.
"Yeah, I did, didn't I?" said Harry pointedly, surprised Hermione hadn't connected it at once.
"Friends and
"That won't be necessary.” Harry could hear the tone of suppressed amusement in Hermione’s voice. "And Malfoy?"
"So was Sirius Black," Malfoy observed, directing his glare at the tapestry.
"Ah," said Hermione. "Well, that's probably significant."
invite him," said Ginny, who was sitting on the table facing Luna's chair, one calf pressed against Luna's thigh. "He's going to be in the house anyway. It'd be rude."
Harry slipped past an unfamiliar lady in a bright pink parka to get to his side, grinning.
. It was a possibility, but he covered it very well.
"It doesn't right
Then a stranger in a hurry managed to kick Malfoy in the leg, and Malfoy cursed and fell over sideways, and Harry found himself bursting into unexpected, breathy laughter.
"I only have eyes for you," crooned Seamus, yanking Dean down into a kiss which unbalanced them both, knocking the pair of them into a prone position amongst the piles of plastic packaging.
something? Had he got so deep into lying that he never knew when the truth would have been so much better?
"Um," said Malfoy, "Come in?"
"Everything," he concluded, with a grin. Draco huffed a breath.
"He did say he didn't feel well last night," said Dean. "I hate that he does nights, I'm sure it's bad for you."
"Oh, I left my, um, cloak in the hallway. I'm just going to get it."
The next morning, however, Harry came downstairs to find that Malfoy and Dean had not forgotten their plans. Malfoy was leaning against the drawing room door in black jeans and a band shirt that Harry recognised as one of Dean's.
Ron grinned. Harry watched it fade, slowly, as Ron clearly remembered why he'd called.
Harry was still a bit mystified as to why Neville, particularly, was so much more hostile to Malfoy. Malfoy had been utterly horrible to him in school, of course, and Neville had every right not to trust him — if anything he'd expected
"I always imagined you taking a lucrative book deal and living a life of celebrity decadence," Draco drawled.
"I'm going to go talk to Ron and Hermione." He patted her on the arm, vaguely. "Go back to sleep."
"What if this doesn't work?" said Harry nervously as they jogged briskly in the direction of the bathroom.
Then Ron was pressing a stiff drink into his hands, something pink and fruity and smoking mysteriously. Ron tugged him into a beanbag corner, Hermione settling down gracefully beside him, both of them making a subtle barrier between him and the rest of the room. Harry loved them for it, and cursed himself.
A moment of silence, then Malfoy said:
"I don't know," said Harry. "Like, I get that it's
"How rugged," said Pansy, with another evil little smirk at him. "Perhaps I see why you like him now, Ginevra."

to hate Harry bloody Potter!"
Harry snorted. Malfoy gave him an annoyed look, and Harry hid behind his book.
Both Harry and Hermione glared.
"Hope I've found something to please the housemates," said Harry. "They get mad when I buy things that are too depressing."
"Well, if you weren't so bloody eager to act the hero –"
"No thanks," said Malfoy, matching his hostility with his own cold version of politeness. His back was stiff, no longer lounging.
"It's
It was ironic, really, that the thing he needed the most from therapy was help to get him to therapy.

Harry gestured to Draco's arm with his free hand. Ellie gave them both a curious look, especially Malfoy's arm.
that. He felt like he could watch it forever.
"I heard the rumours of that back then, you know. I didn't believe it. It might not astonish you to hear this, Potter, but I was a rather precious and sheltered child, and the idea of a parental figure putting someone in a cupboard to sleep sounded like it was something out of a particularly macabre book. My eleven-year-old self was convinced it was simply a transparent ploy for attention. My Mind Healer would call that projection, I expect."
"I couldn't, Harry," mumbled Neville, from his position slumped over the piano.
It was a cold, sobering sort of thought. Harry touched the necklace, smooth glass under his fingers, and vowed to himself that he, too, would try to be better.
?" said Pansy, considerably louder. "Have they
"You're right, of course." He nodded, fake-serious. "Whatever will I do then? We can't all be so lucky as to bump into a former enemy who happens to be renovating a dilapidated old wizarding house with room to spare."
"You were a kid," said Harry. "We were kids."
"True," he agreed, and Draco went from teasing to pleased. "In which case, I guess my resolution is to do better. Not for myself, I mean, but for other people."
"Closest I've come to potions in a while," said Malfoy, smirking at Luna as he passed her the final glass.
There was a long, heavy silence.
Dean took the rest of the orders, filling in the order form in his neat, looping handwriting.
"Can't you hear that?"
Inside the shop was close and busy, full of strange patrons drinking tea from mismatched cups in similarly eclectic seats, and the walls and tables were covered with multicoloured, exotic-looking fabrics. From the ceiling hung an array of glittering knick-knacks: bejewelled bird ornaments and dangling fairy lights, flower garlands and Moroccan lamps. A silver CD player on the counter was playing the sound of running water for some reason, and the whole place smelled of patchouli.
"Goodness," he said, once he'd regained composure. "What a very generous and utterly bizarre offer. Merlin, Potter, can't you just uncomfortably chuck me some change like a normal person?"
"My standard contract," said Adhikari, wordlessly Summoning a file on her desk in a casual way that Harry found rather impressive. He was convinced Hermione would have swooned by now. "It is spelled to notify the St Mungo's Board of Mind Healers if it detects a breach of contract. It's only a spell, so it can be wrong — it works primarily on intent, so occasionally cases arise where a Mind Healer believes a disclosure or action is justified and the client disagrees, or even sometimes when a Mind Healer is conflicted about a disclosure that is later ruled necessary — but it's certainly powerful enough to detect malice or ill intention."
Harry was utterly furious about it.
Then Dean caught Harry's eye for the first time, and Ginny followed the look. She winced.
There was a small scramble as everyone fought over the pile of packages.
They pulled their robes on and attempted to look a little less shagged. Malfoy probably had nail marks on his hips.
"I promised to be a good boy," said Malfoy dryly, shaking his hand. Ernie laughed at this, loudly, and Harry turned back to Ron.
Harry's stomach turned.
The dining room was considerably more lively. Someone had managed to tune the old wireless to Radio One and the music was pounding, the lights much darker than upstairs. Harry only caught a flash of the glitter-covered banners before he was pulled into the crowd of people by means of bright greetings and drunken hugs, returning grins and compliments until he found himself at one end of the dining room table. The ancient, expensive-looking mahogany had been shrunk to about the size of a ping-pong table, and was covered in clear plastic cups.
"Where do you get your skin colour from?" Harry blurted. Dean looked up from his sketchbook with an expression of surprise. Harry's stomach dropped, his entire body crawling with the desire to curl in on itself and spontaneously combust.
"I just lift things. You know, doing renovations."
"Come on," he said gruffly, touching Malfoy on the arm and tugging him gently down the stairs. Malfoy looked at Harry's hand on him, eyes wide, and Harry dropped it.
"Don't be ridiculous, Draco," she said. "The Greengrasses never trucked with all the pure-blood supremacy nonsense, so you've no need to snub them on principle."
"Er, wanna play chess, mate?" said Ron, wiping his mouth.
Harry sighed and pulled out his wallet. He'd have to make more than one owl order for Muggle money this month.
Ginny drew up a rota for the shopping. Harry found that Tesco wasn't so impossibly far, after all.
He had to let Draco go.
"They're lovely," said Harry, glancing at Malfoy. "I'm Harry."
Draco snorted, the breath making Harry's hair ruffle. "Of course you did."
"Oh, really," drawled Malfoy, smiling the depraved smile of a filthy corruptor as he leant casually against the bookcases. "Is that why you're flushed?"
"But this is all very off-topic. The topic being my hair. Does anyone want to help me cut it off?"

There was something about Draco's imperious voice that

Then the door opened, letting light flood in from the corridor. Malfoy was silhouetted in the doorway.
. No, Ron, don't say that. It'll be fine," said Hermione weakly, and Harry stomped off and out the door, annoyed. What
The next day, they actually went. Draco Malfoy, who had every reason to avoid the eyes of the wizarding world, put on his tracksuit bottoms and Ginny's spare Quidditch shirt, and went out to the public pitch.
" said Malfoy, to the table.
Harry reflected that it could have gone much, much worse.
"Oh," said Harry, "Yeah. Sometimes I forget." He cast a Drying Charm over the t-shirt, wordlessly, and pulled it on.
All three left him to it. Harry sighed, and started running his bath.
"Well," said Hermione. "I was
"Malfoy," said Hermione. "I don't even know what to say to that. If you'd told me a year ago that Draco Malfoy would be lecturing me on Muggle rights —"
"You can go if you like, look at something next door. Or come closer, that's fine too."
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
"It's healed well," he said.
"He doesn't have to go," said Harry, slumping down onto a beanbag.
the only one with a functioning roof.
Harry laughed, a little hysterically, powering along to the main road and looking anywhere but Malfoy, unable to articulate the whirl of embarrassment and euphoria inside him in a way that wouldn't sound mad. How could he explain that a flirtatious exchange with a stranger had thrown a spotlight on how sheltered he'd been? How isolated he'd made himself? He'd spent so long seeing himself through a shattered lens, broken and unloveable and uninteresting besides being famous Harry Potter, but after just a few hours relaxing in the Muggle world instead of darting in and out of Tesco, he'd seen himself through new eyes. He'd met people who didn't know him, but
Then Malfoy tugged his hand away from Luna, breathless and smiling, and spotted the punch fountain.
"And what did you say?" said Ron.
"Because it hurts," he muttered. One strand of hair was falling in his eyes; Harry wanted to push it back. "Here in front of
Fish spread himself out along his side of the red leather booth, throwing his arms wide. He gave Harry an appraising look.
Harry joined the table in waving Seamus off as he stepped into the kitchen Floo. Afterwards, he busied himself with the dishes, smiling to himself as Ron and Dean got into increasingly ridiculous pre-match trash talk, and when they got up he followed them upstairs with two bowls of food.
There were several familiar, brightly coloured printouts in the tray. Harry turned around to stare at Hermione.
"This
Malfoy deflated again, wearing the same surprised look from earlier.
"Blaise," he said. "I cannot fucking tell you how good it is to see you."
"Perhaps you need someone to handle your PR," Malfoy reflected. "Set some boundaries with the public."
"Are we really about to sit down and have a merry tea with Malfoy?" said Dean, but he sounded more wry than angry. Ginny gave his shoulder a squeeze.
"I like that," said Harry, flopping on his back.
Harry found he couldn't reply. Shev didn't seem to mind, eyeing his arm with a critical gaze.
"Yes, well," said Draco, also scowling. "Colour me surprised. We all know exactly what those old codgers are like."

Dean blinked, and Seamus, Ginny
Draco shook his head.
Harry's stomach lurched.
"I burned the sauce a bit," he agreed. "Tried to cover it with paprika. I don't think it's
Harry stopped silently on the last step, peering round Malfoy to see a sliver of Dean, propped up on a beanbag and sketching one of the objects on the side table.
"I don't think I've ever really heard Muggle music," he said, his voice full of wonder now. "My parents played classical, and I'm pretty sure the WWN only knows how to play Celestina Warbeck. But that was…"
"If I find out that you are being anything but an absolute delight to Harry, I will personally hex you with the curse of a thousand papercuts."
"Thank you," he said, feeling suddenly attached to her, this perfect stranger who'd marked him for life.
"Funny you should wander in here at exactly the right time," said the tattooist, giving him a little smirk, like she'd read his misgivings. "And wanting a lily, as well. Flowers are kind of my thing. I'm Shev, by the way."
Everyone fell about laughing. Harry, too annoyed by his failing spellwork to laugh along, tried to contort himself into a position to see it properly and promptly tripped forward onto a beanbag.

"So the secret is
Ron sat up in bed, squinting at the hallway light; he looked at Harry, and his eyes focused. He flung back the cover, subjecting Harry to the puffskein-patterned boxers George had bought him last Christmas, but Harry was too tired to tease him tonight.
Harry's heart felt like a broken, melted thing. He wrapped an arm around him, careful, and leant back into the sofa.
"Should we be letting him wander about like that, unsupervised?" he said. "He could be, you know, buying drugs."
"Oh," said Harry. And then, before he could quite stop himself, "People do that?"
"You ready?" Harry asked. Draco nodded.
It started with Dean jokingly trying to get tiny plaits into Seamus's short, shaggy locks one lazy Thursday afternoon, and ended up with Seamus and Ginny sat together on the floor, both looking dreamy as their amateur stylists quietly carded hands through their hair. Harry, half-reading an uninteresting novel, had been watching the scene unfold from the opposite sofa for the better part of an hour.
Jack was scarlet, and Ritchie was looking at him as though braced to be hurt.
A long pause. Then Seamus began to make a noise like a kettle boiling.
"Try and get some sleep," said Hermione, plucking his glasses gently from his head and setting them on the table beside the alarm clock. "I'm sure everything will work out in the morning."
"Are house-elves like that, too?"
"It's going to be very strange, being in a different year," said Hermione. "I mean, I've not really spoken to Ginny's friends before, and now I'm sharing a dorm room with them. It's like first year all over again. You don't know any of the seventh year boys very well, do you?"
"Oi!" said Harry, but they did not hear him. Harry rolled his eyes and waited for the corridor to clear.
Harry looked at Ron, leaning comfortably against the sofa.
Harry paused, and he could see it on Neville's face when suspicion dawned. Ginny, too, dropped her face into her hands.
It was just him and Luna the next day. In between writing for the

Malfoy might have thought himself lacking in the self-control department, but Harry reflected that it was quite impressive, how he could get out of a room so quickly without appearing to flee.
"Not things I've said about
Harry watched as an extra cup materialised discreetly; Luna poured herself a cup and sat cross-legged beside the coffee table to drink it, smiling at them both. Harry was just about to ask her how her day's adventuring went when they were interrupted by the tell-tale sound of Ginny running up the stairs.
"Hermione," he muttered the next morning, leaning in under the pretext of helping her wash up the breakfast plates. "I need some pamphlets about drugs."
"Good idea," he said, voice tight. "I hadn't thought of that."
Harry would have accused him of channelling Snape, if it weren't for the fact that Harry could tell Slughorn earnestly believed that this would be good for the class. Snape was usually just being spiteful.
"That's ever so kind," said Malfoy quietly, his accent intense. "But I couldn't possibly. I'll just be going now." A hesitation. "Although, I suppose I do have a question."

"Some girls bloom early," said Ginny. "Best not to risk it."
"I have a girlfriend!" protested Harry.
Dean laughed,
Harry moved up the staircase a little. He could see Malfoy's back, now; he hadn't moved from the doorway.
magic in it. Harry could feel it. Every small act of maintenance made the rooms lighter, the wallpaper brighter. The drawing room begrudgingly accepted its new role as a room of squishy sofas and bean bags and stopped trying to swap them out for bony old couches. Spiderwebs no longer had permission to form in the corners. The showers never seemed to run cold anymore, even if they all ran at once. Even Walburga Black's portrait was subdued, pulling back into the wall, the velvet curtains remaining firmly shut.
Malfoy huffed rather than parrying the comment, and then they both trudged their way up the stairs.
"Nobody ever said ambition was glamorous," said Draco.
"I got him a present," said Harry, and Teddy perked up again as Harry fished in his pocket for the shrunken package. "You might not thank me for it."
It's not like I had a lot of opportunities to learn about weird sex stuff, what with all the mortal danger and everything."
"We can make signs!" crowed Ginny, clapping her hands together.

"Never mind, I'll have one for ya," said Fish, not looking offended, and loped away into the night.
Harry signed her book, and then the other girls' books, and when people wanted to shake his hand, to thank him, he just smiled and repeated what Neville always said in these situations —
Harry grinned, and pulled Draco's face close.
Malfoy was beginning to hyperventilate again, eyes wide and glassy.
Harry patted Ginny on the back in congratulations for her victory, and dragged himself up to have a shower.
"Why?"

They rose from the kitchen table, Luna pulling him into a tight hug before turning to the kitchen fire. Ginny slipped behind her to hug him too, while Luna fumbled with the Floo powder.
"But that's… not enough. I want serious, and I kind of have my hopes set on someone else, but the timing isn't right for her yet. And I don't want to get involved in something with Ginny and then get my heart broken two ways, and I

Malfoy snorted into his cup.

her. You have a lot in common, you know."
"It's not a problem that you're here, of course — " said Draco, at the same time.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. Harry shrugged.
Harry snorted.
Harry suppressed another laugh. Ron went scarlet to the tips of his ears, and Hermione dropped her fork. Draco, torn between looking embarrassed and amused, shrugged one shoulder.
. Hermione's at the library, Ron is at the Ministry all hours doing Auror training, and Neville's doing some sort of botanical study at Kew Gardens. Seamus is actually upstairs asleep, he works nights. Don't worry about disturbing him, though, he puts up one hell of a Silencing Charm. Which is fortunate for all of us," he added, with a smile to himself.
Harry grinned and thumped him on the shoulder.
Draco looked hollow and exhausted, and his sneer was harder than usual. That, more than anything else, solidified Harry's resolve. He'd figure out what the slimy ferret was doing, if it was the last thing he did.
"Well, in Harry's defence, he was right, Malfoy
"I'd best stay home then," said Harry, tone droll but his heart soaring at the casual inclusion. Malfoy's brow creased, like he didn't know quite how to work with self-deprecation.

"But honestly some people play the wrong note even on the very simplest scale, you've got excellent dexterity, you'll probably be a disgusting natural and I'll have to persuade Kreacher to trap your fingers in the oven door so you don't get better than me."

"I know I'm not," Dean agreed, calm. "And let's be clear, he made a bunch of people's lives a misery when he was hanging out with that gang. Kids who might have done the same thing he did because of his bullying. Kids who deserved my time more than he did. And it's not my job to fix racist pricks, I shouldn't

Draco's eyes went soft.
"Seamus?" he called. "You okay?"
He really hoped that no-one could smell him through the door.
"Come on, Potter," said Malfoy, looking back with a smirk on his face. "If this helps, you can do me a favour and tell people I'm on their side."
"Not a single decent potion maker in the whole house, barring Hermione who is a sadist and thinks we won't learn to moderate our drinking if we don't suffer the consequences. Perhaps I should put out an ad for a competent potioneer."
Malfoy just stared for a moment.
God, this was
Without thinking about it too much, he took up the quill and signed his name on the blank space. For a moment, the black ink glistened on the surface of the parchment, but then it sank into the fibres, and it felt for a moment as though the whole house shivered around him.
Harry settled back into the beanbag, staring at the ceiling. He was both vaguely annoyed that Malfoy had picked today to hit the depression phase of his recovery, and vaguely comforted that he wasn't alone. They all got it, everyone in Grimmauld, but the rest of them all seemed to deal with it better than Harry. Or that's how it felt to him today.
Harry gave him a gentle shoulder barge.
"He's been through a lot," Dean was saying, and Harry paused.
"’Rains!" he repeated, and Harry followed him upstairs to the chunky children's train set, laughing at Teddy's little face lighting up when Harry sat on the floor and began to drive a train around the track.
Harry huffed a breath of laughter.
sleep with them? At the same time?"
"Like what?" said Ron. "He's not really our problem, you know."
Harry watched Draco's lips form the words and wished he could kiss them. Draco blinked at him for a second, then turned away again.
to be apologised to. Addictive, I suppose."
"All alone, Malfoy? I guess even the Slytherins hate you now."
"Gotta love that posh bollocks." Fish gave Harry a conspiratorial wink. "Who talks like that, anyway? I see you're on the other side of the soup spoon these days, so I reckon you owe me a thank you."
Ginny scowled.
"Didn't say that," said Fish. "Where'd that fifty go, anyway?"
"Around eight thirty," said Harry.
"Yes I do, Potter, it's all in the name.
"She is," he agreed. Harry felt strangely guilty.
"Don't be too disheartened, Potter," he said. "I am very good."
"How the fuck do
"Want to eat in?" said Harry.
A few shops down, Malfoy found a transparent shirt.
"I know that
He'd want someone passionate, like Ginny, someone full of life to shake the dullness from his bones. He'd want someone better at the things he was bad at, someone who knew how to speak to people, but they'd have to understand him too. They would have to know what it felt like to feel damaged and different, like Luna did. He'd want someone he could be there for, and who would care for him in return, like Ron and Hermione always did. He'd want someone tactile, like Seamus was with Dean sometimes. He didn't need a hero, but he did want someone who could be brave in the ways Harry sometimes wasn't. Someone to challenge him.
"What do I care who you fancy? Doesn't change the fact you're working for evil, and I'm going to figure out what you're doing."
"Sorry I'm late," he said. "Got a call from mum. Guess what arrived?"
"Well, if we haven't fed him to the roses yet," said Neville, but he looked content.
"The next time he hits me, he keeps hitting me. I'm frozen. I just let him. I
Harry looked around at him, hope flaring, before he realised he was being stupid. Malfoy hadn't said he didn't
Malfoy sneered and took a step closer.
to know. Harry didn't know how to hide it, felt like it must be transmitting out of his every pore. He ached when Malfoy laughed. Every stupid word he spoke in that ridiculous accent seemed to root Harry to the spot.
Time seemed to stand still for Harry. Dean stood frozen for a moment, but then his hands came up to dig into Seamus's hair, head angling to deepen the kiss, and Harry couldn't understand why the whole thing hit him like a punch to the chest, like something he'd never seen before — not that he
He'd ask Hermione to ease up with the Pamphlets. But maybe not today.
. He tried not to laugh.
"I'm not who he's hiding from, but I probably know who that is," said Harry. "How about if I'm not a stranger?"
it, he thought — had feelings that he sated with his own hand — but it didn't feel overwhelming, as Ron had tentatively, drunkenly described his first time with Hermione. He felt an envy for their glow, the spark between them.
But then the owl arrived. It was a Scops owl, skinny and silly looking, and it came the same way Blaise's had, by tapping on the drawing room window. Harry was sitting near the glass, because Draco was in the opposite corner by the piano, and Harry wasn't sure if he could help himself if he got too close while Draco was playing. He let the owl in, one hand on his wand; the bird swept elegantly across the room and landed on Draco's shoulder, making him jump.
"Don't worry, Harry, we'll sort it out. Here we are!"
"Hey," said Draco, breathless, when they were in danger of starting something in the middle of the garden. "I never finished the tale."
, fighting with him, even though all Harry wanted was peace between them.
He went to Quality Quidditch Supplies, and bought half the shop for Ginny. The girl behind the till looked a little faint as he rang up the order, and he politely pretended not to notice.
"Yeah. Sorry… that's probably a rude question."
"Granted," said Dean. "But he is hot, gotta give him that."
Draco slung the door open and slumped backwards onto his bed. Harry sat on the cushioned bench, as he had the first day Draco had arrived, and stared at the white-blonde hair spilling out over the emerald coverlet.
Harry raised his eyebrows.
"Actually," said Malfoy, tapping his book against his chin, "Someone's been offering to buy me one pretty much constantly."
things, always assuming they weren't for him.
Harry laughed into his damp shoulder. They were sticky with cooling sweat and come; Harry rolled to Draco's side and waved a lazy hand over them both. Draco squirmed.
what Hermione meant!" he protested, and it came out a little squeaky.
"I don't — I don't want to want you. For it to be
"Oh?" said Ginny, looking over from her spot beside Luna on a beanbag. "Was it ferret?"
After being plied on all sides with offers of desserts, Harry thought he had quite outstayed his welcome. He shuddered to think what Hermione would say if she saw him. He accepted a final basket of chicken sandwiches, and with a wary glance at the map – which he'd never be able to check and carry the basket at the same time – he donned his cloak and set off back to Gryffindor tower.
been Malfoy on the Quidditch pitch, angry and intensely focused, his stupid slicked hair flashing gold in the sun like the Snitch itself.
"Let me get this straight," he said. "You… begged for this money, so that you could give it to someone who has a really quite embarrassingly large pile of gold already?"
Harry looked at the pair of them. Malfoy's overlong hair fell into his face as he bent down to pick up a sheet of parchment, looking alert and alive in a way he hadn't when Harry had first found him.
"Doesn't sound like you need it," said Harry with a grin, handing him a cup.
Draco's eyes flicked down to Harry's.
As Harry towelled himself dry in his bedroom, staring at his new wardrobe, he was treated to the sound of Dean and Seamus squabbling over Dean's clothing choices in the corridor, darting in and out of each other's rooms and bickering their way into the bathroom. He wondered where Malfoy was. What Malfoy would wear. He wondered, for the first time, where Malfoy's old things had gone — had he never owned Muggle clothes? Did they get lost? Stolen?
"A bit," he said, and winked at her.
"Potter…" said Malfoy. "This isn't a sex thing, is it?"
"Right.” Neville nodded. A moment passed, and Malfoy made to leave, but Neville held a hand up.
Seamus came back up the stairs after a few minutes looking rueful, with a full tea service and four types of biscuits. Harry smirked.
"I'm saying, I think I might not like girls," said Harry. "I'm sorry. I haven't really spent much time thinking about sex, what with Voldemort and everything, but now I have had a chance to reflect, and I think... yeah."
But before she could say any of them, Draco flung himself down the stairs and into a hug, forcing Harry to take a step back to avoid Pansy as she staggered back.
his front door was quite short, but familiar dread still reared its head as the door swung back, only abating at the sight of Neville's brown hair bent over the nearest window box. He took a moment to notice the door was open; Harry coughed.
"You fixed the House Magic."
, she bosses us about at all hours, and to top it all off she's
"You don't have to try very hard to be that, Weasley," said Seamus. Harry watched Ginny's blush with a strange, detached sort of envy.
Harry tried not to think too much about any charming sober arty types, and whether Luna thought they'd be a good match in any other ways. Draco, mercifully, didn't seem to notice Harry's inner turmoil.
The unease took on a very different flavour the day of the party. Seamus's final guest list had included most of the DA, the younger Weasley siblings, a select few of his work friends, several cousins, and Blaise Zabini, presumably to give Malfoy someone to hide behind. It was going to be the largest number of people from the wizarding world that Harry had seen in a very long time. He knew Ron and Hermione had taken it upon themselves to discreetly vet anyone they were not already familiar with, and there was absolutely no chance of gatecrashing with the amount of warding the house had, but even so, he was anxious enough to completely overwhelm the effects of the necklace.
Draco laughed. It was humourless.
Ron suddenly looked rather less excited.
"Hang on, Malfoy," interrupted Dean, "You're welcome to join us."
"Yeah, I know," said Harry, annoyed. "I'm not an idiot."
Malfoy was silent. Harry folded his arms.
"Not a problem, mate," said Seamus.
"Fair," agreed Seamus, and Harry's whole body flushed hot with embarrassment. "It's a bit outrageous really. Not sure he's got any idea, bless him. I'm sure he has
, right?"
Dean, to Harry's outrage, actually chuckled at this.
Malfoy frowned. "No," he said, slowly.
"You were right," said Malfoy, his grin sharp as they listened to You Oughta Know. "I did like that one."
Harry followed her up the stairs and then made his own way to the third floor bathroom, trying very hard not to think about Malfoy's
"It's an easy walk," called Dean from the top step. "Don't catch the tube or anything, from here it takes you all the way to Leicester Square only to go back out and leave you half a mile from where you started. I think there's a map in the drawers by the door."
relationship. Besides, it takes me forever to get to know someone, and —"
"Walked past a shop on the way to Tesco and they had big piles of these at the door. Have at it, Harry."
"Yep," said the man. "You can call me Fish. I'm not homeless really, just fancy the free soup."
"Ooh yes, I'd love to help with the decor," Luna agreed. Seamus looked at them, grin a little tight as he clearly imagined the kind of glittery chaos the pair of them would create.
tell the whole school you got off on it," said Malfoy. Harry just smiled.
He looked around at the guests. It wasn't as bad as he thought it would be. Parvati Patil was dancing in a circle in the centre of the room, a little unsteadily, grinning at her sister and Lavender on the sofa. Padma looked embarrassed, and Lavender's anxious expression wrinkled the scars on her face. Her expression softened into relief when she saw Harry, and she waved at him a little, subdued and self-conscious in a way she'd never been at school. Neville was by the record player with Hannah, leaning in close to talk. Ron, Ginny and Hermione were clustered around the drinks cabinet nearby, casting shifty glances over their shoulders. Ernie MacMillan was perched on the other sofa, talking to someone Harry suspected was Seamus's cousin, and Seamus himself was standing by the long buffet table by the window, wearing a paper crown on his sandy blond head and talking to George. The buffet table was groaning with snacks, many of which were a lot more green than they had been when Harry and Ron had made them. Harry watched Seamus point at his birthday cake and mime something which looked suspiciously like an explosion. George laughed.
He found himself pulled to the picture of the Marauders, still firmly stuck to the wall. Harry smiled at his dad's familiar face, watched young Sirius grin at him and wink, over and over. He was reminded of the other photo, the torn image of himself and his parents, Harry zooming round them on a toy broomstick; he hadn't looked at it in a long time.
"I suppose I should be grateful that Great Auntie Walburga isn't here to blast me off too," said Malfoy after a moment, slim fingers tracing the line that led to the Malfoy family.
Harry smiled awkwardly at the man, who gave him another reassuring grin before turning around to the three ladies and Hermione. He flourished his arm, looking down at his watch.
that made him hate himself, for thinking of something like that when Malfoy was pouring his heart out to him.
"What, does it turn your enemies into love slaves?"
"It's no bother," said Harry, shoving his hands into his pockets before he did something awkward with them.
"I heard you had a review hearing recently," said Harry. "Did they…?"
Ron grinned.
Except it wasn't the back of the shelf. Behind the first row of books there was a second row, and these had much more appetizing titles. There was a naked women on the spine of one particularly thick book, and she winked suggestively at Harry, tossing her long hair.
"At this point, I'd just be happy to see him out of the house," said Hermione.
Harry looked at the shirt, and then Malfoy, and realised something.
"Much better," said Harry, shooting Ron a look.
's a useful spell," said Harry. Malfoy stared at him.
His eyes wandered away from
Harry winced.
"All this because I don't
"I thought about having one," said Draco. "But I had a toke on Sebastian's joint the other week and thought I was about to die. I don't think I'm quite ready."
"More than that," said Pansy. "Theo writes to me sometimes, you know. He says you're
"I think we'd better go, then," she said. "Sorry Harry, looks like you've got a quiet evening."
"Yes, Granger?"
"We don't have to wait 'til he fucks up to kick him out," said Seamus, with a quick glance at Harry, as though daring him to disagree.
Malfoy stood in the doorway, frozen, clutching a sheet of parchment, his eyes taking in the room; Ginny and Hermione's skimpy party dresses, Luna half-in and half-out of her long skirt, Dean and Seamus a tangle of limbs, and Harry, laughing and shirtless in his new, tighter jeans.
"We're having a New Year's Eve party," blurted Harry. "You should come."
"Taboo?" asked Draco, sliding past Ginny onto a beanbag and inspecting the box. "Sounds kinky."
"I don't think he's at the sick stage," said Harry. "But yes. He's my responsibility."
"Would I?" said Harry, grinning over his cup. Malfoy looked back at him for a moment, face strangely unreadable. Then he looked away.
at least," said Hermione.
"It's beautiful."
Amit was a thin man with glasses even bigger than Harry's. He was dressed in a pale grey kurta with a chocolate stain on the front, and both his smile and his body language were twitchy. Harry found him difficult to age; his hair showed signs of grey, but something about his expression and posture seemed more suited to a teenager.
they don't have the same pure-blood traditional nonsense in the family."
"Fine, I'll buy them," said Harry, laughing at Malfoy's scowl. He pulled the LP out of Malfoy's hands and turned to the shopkeeper, who was watching the exchange with amusement.
"Yeah," agreed Dean. "Especially since he's just
"I'm definitely not going," he said. "But Gin — I appreciate you asking. And I'm glad you're going."
"I think I want one," said Harry, trying to sound normal and not breathy.
"They'd probably come out cursed."
"You'd become an advisor to the French Minister in a decade, I simply know it," she added, voice a little thin.
Harry forced himself to Floo call the Burrow to tell them where he was, and then he lay across a dusty chaise longue in the ugly drawing room until he had the energy to begin.
"Oh, er – someone told me," said Ginny airily. "What's the password?"
Harry let Draco drag him forward, watched him saunter ahead with his finger still hooked in Harry's robe. He
"Give it here," said Ginny. Harry leant forward to pick it up, but Ginny leapt up with surprising speed and got to it first.
Harry was sure Draco wouldn't joke about it now, if he really meant it. Draco wasn't going to run away to Paris, now or any other time; Harry knew it with sudden, giddy clarity.
"You're a true friend," he said. "And
"You're insane," he said. "Forget it ever happened."
, but I doubt I can ever just forget you were a Death Eater."
"Ohhhh, look at
Ginny made a beeline for the group of people collected at the back of the room. Harry trailed behind, focusing on the table rather than the people themselves — there were cups and glasses, a jug of orange squash and a tea urn, and the four strangers were all clustered around an open Tupperware box of brownies.
"Harry decidedly does not," said Harry, in mock disgust. "But yes, of
"I think Ritchie's avoiding everyone," explained Ron. "He came in late last night and he made a proper dive for you before we got him, bit of a shock apparently as everyone assumed he was into girls. I think he's really worried about Jack."
"You could fetch your own," said Harry, setting the bowl down on the side and sitting on the pouffe. "Or eat with us."
"Oh, no," he said, not knowing why he was disappointed. Of course you needed appointments to get things permanently inked on your body, that was normal, and Harry wasn't going to actually
"Don't be silly," she said. "Of course not. But Lord Greengrass
"What?" Harry blinked at him. "Why?"
, thought Harry, but couldn't bring himself to say it. He heaved a sigh.
Zabini gave him a slow smile.
"Hopelessly and irrevocably," he said quietly, and it hit Harry square in the chest.
"He gave me his number," said Harry, showing Malfoy his hand. Malfoy scowled.
Harry sat down, very quietly, and went back to his book. This was more important than Malfoy. Hermione said that he needed to do some self-reflection, and that research would help, and God knows he needed it. So that was what he was doing.
"God, what are we even looking for?" said Malfoy quietly. Harry shrugged and peered into the darkness for a shopkeeper. There was a man with a goatee and an eyebrow piercing leaning against a cash register at the very back of the shop, reading a magazine with a gurning guitarist on the front. Harry slipped through the shop, towards him.
"No?"
Malfoy was looking curiously at everything, taking in the small details: the stack of junk mail piled incongruously on the otherwise-tidy side table, the coat stand covered in brightly coloured jackets, the picture-hook evidence of removed paintings Harry hadn't yet replaced on the walls, the shadowy curtains hiding Mrs Black.
Draco's hips jerked involuntarily. His hands came up to Harry's hair.
They locked the door on the way out.

to die."
home."
Ginny was next, perhaps two weeks later. She was grinning, but she looked hollow, pale skin bluish under her eyes, almost translucent in the June sunshine.
Harry was not gentle as he took Draco into his mouth, imagining how it felt to him, feeling obscene and pleased when Malfoy groaned low in his throat. Harry began to move, using his hand where his mouth could not reach, and it was ridiculously arousing to be doing this to him, to have him moan when Harry used his tongue, making him scrabble at the wall for purchase when Harry swallowed around him.
"Is it just me," said Seamus cheerfully, turning off the pizza alarm with a flick of his wand, "Or is everyone getting more Slytherin as they get older?"
"Alright Harry?" Seamus called from across the room, winking. "What do you think of the theme? Apparently Gin was worried I'd forget me heritage."
Still, the drink was delicious, and Ron was clearly in a cheery mood, gesturing with enthusiasm as he filled Harry in on the news of Ernie MacMillan's shock decision to become a Muggle financier, and how unbelievably boring it sounded.
He could have stayed, but he said his goodbyes shortly after, and spent Christmas night crying hot, uncontrollable tears into his pillow.
it with you and clothes?" said Malfoy, voice high-pitched. "I'm sure you worked out
Harry closed his eyes. The memory of Malfoy's body against his was there to meet him.
"Thanks," said Draco against his lips, reaching behind Harry to push the plunger. Harry blinked, dazed with lust, and Draco smirked at him.
I'd gloat. And that makes it so much
They tamed the grass, but they left the edges wild, an explosion of climbing roses that filled the garden with warm scent and the sound of pollinators buzzing amongst the leaves. Then they drank spiked lemonade on picnic blankets that evening and admired them until, after one too many, Neville tripped into the rose bush at the bottom of the garden and landed on a flagstone tile half-buried in the undergrowth. The next morning, he and Harry came out to investigate and realised that what was beyond the roses and brambles was not a wall at all, but an ornamental dividing topiary, the entrance long-obscured by overgrowth. Harry and Neville pruned it back: beyond it, they found a whole new garden, the root-cracked path winding between weed-covered rockeries and raised beds with their banks burst. Fruit bushes bloomed in curving rows; a sweet-smelling chaos of potions’ herbs flourished in one corner. A strawberry patch ran riot across one whole wall, far beyond its intended boundary. Butterflies and bees floated amongst the wonderland, every spare inch blooming with wildflowers. There was even a vegetable garden, hidden by long grass, broken bamboo the only evidence of any deliberate tending.
"I didn't give it much thought once I realised you weren't being murdered," said Luna. Ginny made a choked sound. "Besides, I don't mind. I think it's nice when someone's having fun."
It wasn't her fault. It wasn't his fault, either. It just… was.
The food was good, and Harry felt warm and well in a way he hadn't for a while. There was a charge in the air that night, something heavy like static, something that put the party on edge. The wine was finished before they moved up to the drawing room, and vodka and oranges became drinking games; Harry brought the record player down, and they danced to Muggle albums by bands Harry knew Uncle Vernon would have indiscriminately and contemptuously called
Ginny grinned at him.
"I am," she said primly. "Now let's get back before Ron's jealous streak demands to know what you're doing with me."
"I just got a tattoo," he said, surging towards her with his arm out.
"Don't you ever come near my family again."
"Well, obviously it was cured by the breakfast," she said, grinning and opening the book on her lap. "Right, how does it work?"
"I don't think so," said Harry.
"Was that your impression of Black Sabbath?" said Seamus, cracking up.
They lapsed into silence again, but Harry thought it wasn't quite so tense.
"No," said Hermione.
"When will you people get it into your heads that I'm
Neville seemed too happy about the first part of the sentence for Harry to have much faith he'd taken the lesson of the second half.
"To put it bluntly," said Hermione, "I wouldn't dream of risking this with anyone whose brain I have a vested interest in."
Harry took a deep breath through his nose.
"We're not together," said Ginny. "And it's Ginny."
"God knows what for, a toff like that, he said it was something to do with getting caught up with bad people, like joining a gang or something. It must have been a juvie record, he barely looks old enough to leave school. Reckon he was lying to sound like an 'ard man, to be honest. What kind of posh kid joins a gang?"
The meaning filtered in like a bucket of cold water.
grieving, but she has completely lost all sense of boundaries. She's obsessed with trying to convince us to go back to Hogwarts, she feeds us
A man with a vast mohawk bumped into them, and Harry was jolted out of his trance. He caught Malfoy's arm.
"That lying bastard!" said Ron. "It
"Well, we can hardly disagree
"Ha, good one!" said Ron, "But you saw him at the Yule Ball, he doesn't have the rhythm for drums."
"Well, at least someone still has some," said Pansy, then immediately looked regretful.
"We broke up because Ginny wasn't ready to get serious, that's all," said Harry. "And I don't know if she'll be ready in the next decade… if ever. She's got things she wants, and I don't think I feature anymore."
Malfoy blinked, swallowed, and looked away.
"Right," said Harry, staring blankly.
"Yes, yes I am. Be thankful for that, sex slave," said Malfoy. He smirked.
"Yeah," said Harry, running a hand through his hair. "Sounds good."
"I don't think so," said Neville. "I mean, she really wanted to — er, that is to say, I don't know if I should say — well, anyway, I think she's looking for different things than I am. Which is not to say I'm not tempted, I mean,
Malfoy shook his head, blond hair flicking so fast it hit him in the face.
"Ellie lost her father," Shev added, drawing her first sweeping line up his arm. "Ten years ago. My husband."
"And yes, you're right," said Ron eventually, because he was much kinder than Harry. "She probably is deflecting. She likes to solve problems, but the War has given her problems she can't solve with logic, so she focuses on other people. But she's a smart woman, Harry, she'll figure that out eventually. We'd
"I know things," she said, straightening her spine. Harry raised an eyebrow at her, but she didn't blink under the scrutiny, and Harry decided not to ask.
"Oh," repeated Harry. "No, I don't think I'm in the mood for some ritual humiliation tonight, thanks mate."
want to watch an alcoholic drink himself stupid with the money Harry'd just given him. He thought of Sirius, lying on the sofa at Grimmauld, blackout drunk. He wondered what had pushed Fish to that point — whether he drank to keep something bad out, like Sirius had. He seemed so chipper, but Harry knew how easy it was to pretend everything was fine. His chest ached.
"Who is it?" said Malfoy.
Ginny tossed her hair back, frustration wrinkling her brow.
"Think so. He was up and about early, but he looked like crap."
"Does it bother you?" said Harry. "Talking about magic, when you're not supposed to do any?"
Harry also liked the way Malfoy dared to make these kinds of jokes now, trusting that they knew his intent.
Which was when Dean realised.
"Couldn't sleep," he said casually, looking away. "Same time tomorrow?"
"Fuck, I am such a twat," he said, pulling himself up to sit cross-legged, mirroring Harry and looking him in the eye. "Being bitter about
Harry shrugged.
"Exactly," said Draco. He'd gone posh again, as though good diction could offset his discomfiting honesty. Harry found it hopelessly endearing. "That's the worst you can come up with about yourself, and I — I like all of it. I like that you're weird, and I like that your manners are charmingly atrocious, and I like that you're strong enough to survive what you've been through. I like that you're always trying to do the right thing, even when it's a fight. Even when you're in chaos. I
"Are you afraid of me?" asked Harry, as quietly as he could. Draco's lips curved into a slow, dark smirk.
"A little-known fact about me," he agreed, and took a large gulp of coffee. He stared into the cup, trying to figure out what a normal person would say next.
pretending they weren't both listening out for the sounds of the others.
"I was livin' with my girlfriend at the time," said Fish, oblivious to Harry's distraction. "Above the pub, on account of her being the landlady. Because he seemed like such a soppy pushover, she said he could stay a couple of nights while he figured out what to do. He ended up helping out at the bar for a few weeks, and she chucked him food and a bit of cash. Then he met
And, of course, they'd have to be someone who didn't idolise him for the mere fact that he was Harry Potter.
"No," said Draco. "I don't like you. I don't want to enter into any sort of relationship with you."
Draco smiling around him.
Harry laughed.
"Alright." Malfoy set down his spoon, pulling a face at the remaining rice. "That's enough of that. Show me to my cell."
"Honestly," she said, "I swear all the nice men have the self-esteem of Bubotubers and the shit men think they are gods. You're both lovely, kind, beautiful people and I love you both very much, okay?"
"Would Masters be liking dessert?" said Kreacher from beside Harry's elbow, making him jump.
"And this is a number for the — the telephone? I don't have one."
, the thing Dudley called him more than any other name.
But he avoided Harry, giving him shifty looks whenever they were in the same room together, and Harry tried not to tear his hair out in frustration. They'd started so well — when Malfoy was all raw and hurt, when he'd been desperate — but the more Malfoy came to himself, the wider the berth he gave Harry.
Draco turned on the spot, body rigid.
at the sight of it… of Malfoy's hip arched up, the slash of pale white skin, the slim fingers working in —
Harry remembered asking Ron that very question one night, his whole body burning with shame. Worse, he remembered the unsettling cartoon-based books Hermione had handed him silently a few days later —
Hermione had a mercenary streak, but it had been a while since he'd heard anything like that from her.
for that." Draco's breath was harsh, his eyes wild. The hand in Harry's shirt clenched. "I'd be in Azkaban if it weren't for you, or dead in a ditch. Have you got any idea what kind of
"Try to match which fingers hit which keys." Draco's voice was soft and surprisingly patient. "Here, I'll count. One," he raised his thumb and then placed it on the C key in front of Harry. "Two, three, one, two, three, four, five." He played up the scale as he moved his hands.
Malfoy didn't acknowledge him, at first.
"Do you know about Regulus?" said Harry suddenly, surprising himself. Malfoy looked between Harry and the tapestry, appealingly confused.
"I see," said Slughorn, eyes softening as they came to rest upon him, and Harry wanted to vomit. "Well, my boy, perhaps you can bond in a more
"Oi oi, it's Malfoy!" called Dean, and everyone turned to look at them.
"Come on," said Harry, pushing open the drawing room door.
"Can I order through you and pay you back, Dean?" said Harry. Dean gave Hermione a shifty look, but shrugged.
Harry took a deep breath. He was shaking now. He wanted to find
"No, of course not," he said. "I'm just saying that this, the agoraphobia stuff… isn't helping. And I'd like her to respect that."

Malfoy avoided his eye; Harry repressed his glee, and turned back to the art.
It just made his dignity even more impressive to Harry. His tenacious desire to survive, when Harry still couldn't fully forget the feeling that he'd been happy to die.
"I don't really — keep up with wizarding news anymore," he said. Draco sneered.
"Good day?" said Malfoy, voice high and taut.
"Okay," said Harry, letting a low note of warning creep into his tone. "Tell me how you're a piece of work. Now, I mean, not before the war."
"Shit," she said. "You actually found him."
Harry looked at Dean, who looked back passively and then down at his bedcovers. He smiled faintly, with more emotion than Harry was used to seeing from him.
"Mmmph!" protested Harry, shoving at the dead weight of boy sprawled all over him, eventually managing to roll Ritchie onto the floor.

not normal," said Harry, grinning. Malfoy stared for a long moment.
"I can't see Professor McGonagall," said Harry. "I'd never live it down if she –"
"Yeah," said Harry. "On a somewhat related note..." He pulled a face. "I sort of need to talk to you."
. And people hate you for it, some people hate that we all have to be your best friends or get branded as a Death Eater! So it doesn't matter what you say,
John looked at him and winked.
Harry blinked.
"Yeah," he said, uncomfortable.
"Joking, Potter," he added. "Rock bottom humour, you know?"
Harry didn't
"This isn't much of an education if you don't reciprocate," said Malfoy breathily, and Harry couldn't imagine doing something like that – but then Malfoy was catching his wrist, pulling it closer, pressing it against the front of his jeans. Harry rubbed, and Malfoy
They finished dessert, and Harry pushed his chair back to stretch out his legs. He wished he could kick his chair out, like he did downstairs, but it felt rude in this atmosphere of formal opulence.
"Yeah," said Malfoy. "He'd obviously decided my
to talk. He wanted to sit up, pull Draco close, and kiss him. He wanted to say he was sorry for how he'd been before, but he knew Draco wouldn't care to hear it.
"Look, I'm sorry he's like that, but it's not my fault," muttered Harry, as everyone bickered over setting up.
"That was

to be a gentle person. Because he hung on to his essential nature, even if that made him a target. He had such a strong sense of himself, even through the years of mockery from spiteful little snots like Malfoy.
Harry stared at him for a long moment. Draco's eyes flashed with challenge.
"Oh, Harry Potter, sir!" squeaked the nearest elf with enthusiasm. "Can we help you?"
They both stayed panting and sticky for a moment, then Malfoy drew his hand away and stumbled back until he was leaning heavily against the opposite bookcase.
sure it was going to be fine. Better than fine, really. Besides, it's
"Oh, hello Malfoy," called Luna, pulling up her skirt. Everyone turned to look at him. "Did you want something?"
"That doesn't make any sense. Surely I could play them in any old order."
"Thanks," said Malfoy, a noticeable quaver in his voice, and Harry had to duck down the stairs to avoid meeting Malfoy's eye as he fled.
Harry wiped his eyes again.
"Badly," he said, but he played it anyway, and Harry sank his head onto Ron's shoulder and prayed for sweet release from the beautiful torture of watching Draco Malfoy caress a piano into resonant life.
The man in the picture also had tattoos. Harry looked down at his wrist and smiled.
Ron nodded. "Couple of things spring to mind. Trust your gut, Harry."
"Oh, come on, Potter, come and talk if you want to," he said, nodding up to his bedroom. Harry's heart raced, the promise of Draco's bedroom loaded with something else now that Harry felt the weight of all the longing in his chest.
heroin, but not so sure that he felt he could call Malfoy out.
attractive. You made sixth year particularly painful, and not just because of the stalking —"
Dean looked at him, shoulders raised, expression a little hostile.
"Why?" said Harry. "Why those fingers?"
"Alright, Malfoy," she said, and punched him on the arm. "Don't be all boring, I'm sure she's simply delightful. You should invite her over, seems like we're doing that now."

Harry wished that thought didn't sting quite so much.
"It's deodorant," said Dean. "It just smells nice. Well, I think it smells awful but some people like it."
, I've gone completely native it seems. Have you ever been to Paris, Potter?"
"Pretty knackering," said Harry, still smiling. "And how was your soup kitchen service today?"
It was a double lesson with Slytherin, which meant Malfoy was there, but he had managed to make it out of the door first and had already taken off at record speed when he heard Ron and Hermione's voices.
"God," he said, glaring at the steaming bowls of pasta as if they were toxic. "You and food."
Malfoy made it clear enough that Harry was
"Well, that's fair enough," said Ginny, smirking. Harry copied Ron's rude gesture.
"The Dark Mark was instant," he said, voice so quiet Harry had to lean forward to hear. "Absolute agony, naturally, but it took a second. One second to make a decision like that."
"Here, wait for me," said Dean, scrabbling up. They both disappeared down to the common room.
"Shall we Apparate?" he said, voice gentle, and Malfoy stared at Harry's grip on his arm and nodded. Harry closed his eyes and concentrated on the body beside him, on that strange sensation of drawing up a slow, deliberate power that engulfed them, compressed them and transported them across the town in the space of a second.
the article," said Harry, rolling his eyes for comic effect and pulling Malfoy up to standing. "Follow me in the papers, do you?"
"Without telling you? I don't want to watch my girlfriend go insane over my best friend. Or my sister, to be honest." he pulled a face. Hermione smiled.
Harry stared.
"Do you have lube?"
"I'm not suicidal, Malfoy," he said. "It was only the one time."
"Sorry, guys," said Dean, taking the vial off Hermione. "I'm going to look after him. We can do another day. Or you can just go without me?"
Malfoy pulled the shirt on, apparently oblivious to Harry's inner turmoil.
Draco pulled his head up again, urgent. "Fuck, I will come if you do that
"I don't care how good you think I'd look in it, I am not putting on any of that weird rave gear." Harry folded his arms, looking stern over his glasses.
"Thanks," he said, "But to be honest, I kind of assumed you already knew. Not because of your terrifying omniscience or anything, more because I told Ginny and I thought she'd tell people. Which I realise now she wouldn't do. Because that would be a bad thing to do. Shit, I'm glad I didn't say anything about — er."
is now, which is a posh git with a nice face who's clearly working to become a better person. He has many qualities worthy of admiration."
Harry winced.
"Oh," he said, and took a deep breath. Then, because Ginny was openly searching his face for what that meant, he added, "Yes, I think you're right."
Slughorn gave them a speech about how disappointed he was, but he was a little warmer in Malfoy's direction and Harry considered it a triumph.
"Obviously." Malfoy's right hand twitched reflexively towards his forearm. "I hide it."
"Me too," said Harry, and she looked at him, startled.
He looked tired, hollow. Three or four weeks of peacetime had taken the sickly pallor from his face, the one he'd had since sixth year, but it still looked as though he hadn't slept in a long time. Despite that, Malfoy had changed since Harry had last looked at him properly; his face was more angular than pointed nowadays, bold lines and dark shadows in the light of his lamp, and he had long, elegant hands that flicked over the pages too quickly for him to be really reading. The gold lamp threw flickering splashes of gold into his silver hair and shadowed eyes, making him look warmer, softer, more approachable. He was really quite...
Harry's last thought before the memory was wiped was that Draco spoke of family, of family loyalty - but loyalty to the Dark Lord?
"Well then we'll have to get you to the prefects' bathroom. And quickly. Ron, keep that spell handy."
"I can't do this."
"They are all in the Manor. So I don't, not any more."
," said Dean, "That is is officially the worst thing you've ever laughed at, shut
Harry set the pan down and stretched up to the top shelf to get the milk jug; when he turned back to the stove, the eggs, flour and milk were on the counter beside him. The first few times this had happened, Harry had actually jumped, but he was used to it now, and he knew better than to ask Kreacher not to do it.
"Well, thank you all for a delightful evening, please excuse us," said Draco, doing a little bow to the room. He seemed to realise he was being ridiculous, winced, and pulled Pansy out into the corridor.
A small crowd of customers mingled on the verge in the twilight, some standing about and staring at the van, others chatting amongst themselves in the patchy grass. Harry scanned them, looking for the distinctive white-blond head.
"I dated Cho in '94, actually," offered Harry, eventually. "The World Cup year."
"Frankly, Harry, of course I do. As would anyone else who's lived with you for this amount of time, given how you've reacted to other suggestions that you might want a little help." Harry scowled at the kitchen table rather than meet Ginny's eye, even though he knew it would do nothing to refute her point. "Grace is my Mind Healer and she's actually really good for me, and so is this group, so far. I wish you'd consider it. I'd be there to, you know, help get you through the door."
"You forget he knows about Lavender, too," said Dean.
"No, I suppose not. And you don't know where the deodorant came from?"
Narcissa was pleading with Draco to stop, and there were Aurors in the corner of Harry's vision, but he could barely hear her over the thud of his own pulse. Why did Malfoy do this to him? He felt
Then at half past seven, Hermione dragged him out to volunteer. Harry's stomach lurched as he stepped past the wards, but the cool September air rushed into him and it was alright, it was
"NO!" said Harry. "I mean, yes! I mean – of course I can bloody get it up, I can get it up just
"When I need a laugh.” Malfoy’s eyes were still red, but sparkling now, and Harry was still holding his hand. Harry dropped it, reluctantly, and turned to leave the bathroom before his mouth said something stupid.
"Ah," said Draco, wincing. "Well, about that."
"Yes, she was kind enough to introduce me to a friend. She thought we'd be a good match, housemate-wise. He's sober and an arty type, which is apparently how Luna sees me, although I'm not convinced that painting walls entirely counts."
"Give me your hand," murmured Draco. Harry lifted it, and Draco poured a little lubricant into Harry's hand. Then he pushed it between them.
And then she was gone, swirling away in her designer robes and leaving Malfoy forlorn, staring after her.
" she said. "Oh Merlin, someone please kill me. Why didn't you knock on the wall or something?"
Harry's eyes fluttered closed. He wasn't going to last long. Draco raised his knees, and Harry manoeuvred himself into position with shaking hands.
"You'll never believe who I saw at the soup run," she said, through her mouthful.
He got a few funny looks, but Seamus clapped a glittery hand on his back and said, "I like your shirt, mate," and everyone else seemed to take their cues from that, letting Malfoy into the crowd. Angelina Johnson went up against him, grinning the fierce grin she wore on the Quidditch pitch, and Malfoy's eyes flashed in the glowing green light from the chandelier as he concentrated, biting his lip as he threw the ball.
"Seems like he has good taste then," he said, letting himself stare at Draco properly for the first time. Draco's eyes widened and he fumbled over the CD in his hand, but then he slipped the CD into place and speakers began to play the opening bars of something winding and strange in a minor key.
"Put The Beatles on
"Oh, sorry, Harry, you should have said something!"
Derek, a gangly dark-haired boy harry just
"Who doesn't?" said Dean bitterly, then he sighed and set down his pencil. "Yeah, sorry. Hermione's great, honestly, nothing against her, not trashing your best friend or anything. Especially since she's a literal genius who did save the world."
"Well I only have half a dress, does that count? Honestly, Malfoy, stylish Muggles definitely do wear this to parties. Look around and tell me you aren't the best-dressed man in the room."
Harry felt a flare of offense. He took a deep breath, tried to let the feeling pass. Hiding his expression behind his cup, he observed the set of Malfoy's shoulders and the twist of his mouth, and realised that for all it had
"Hermione, you do know what you've done there, right?"
"I never see your Dark Mark," he blurted, and Malfoy's smirk vanished.
"Shev said it might be one of her finest." Draco looked smug. "Although I must say, it hurt like an
"What time is your dad expecting us?" asked Ginny to Luna as she bit into the crust of her final sandwich.
"Malfoy," interrupted Hermione. "I can't pretend that I like you or trust you, but if your apology is in earnest, then I accept it, and thank you for saying it. I'd suggest I'm not the only person in the house to whom you owe an apology, however."
"Harry –" said Dean, putting up a hand to stop her.
. Luna made him some beautiful change of address notecards with gold filigree and tiny buzzing bees in the corners, hexed to disintegrate if intercepted.
"No," he said. Pansy's rouged lips curved in a smirk.
"Very little is permanent," said Adhikari, and Harry glanced down at his tattoo with another smile. "But I must tell you, recovery may not look exactly like you expect. You may not become exactly who you were. But I feel confident that you can become someone you are happy and proud to be."
"You were extremely annoying," Blaise interjected, and this was the first thing she'd said that made Harry warm to her.
"Malfoy," said Harry, nudging him with his elbow. "Don't be an idiot."
Harry was unable to quite believe he was here. Doing this. Draco's face softened under the intensity of Harry's scrutiny, eyes fluttering closed, and Harry moved his hand, gentle and sure.
She spent the rest of the evening talking to George, eyelashes fluttering and a hand on his arm, so Harry thought it was probably alright.
Harry grinned.
"It's nice to see you both," she said, and led them inside.
"I can't wait another second!"
"Why would you
"He could hardly
Harry looked at Malfoy again, this time in panic. Malfoy stared back at him, similarly alarmed.
Harry grinned. "Little known fact about me."
It was Harry's turn to ignore Draco, but it hurt him like a physical ache. He found himself listening for Draco's steps on the stairs, playing scales on the piano when he wasn't there, reading books he thought Draco would like, doing things because Draco would approve. He booked an appointment with a Mind Healer, a good few weeks away, so he could chicken out if he wanted. He kept up his walking, but he didn't go to Camden, perversely reluctant to go without Draco but not wanting to invite him either. And he watched Draco, the way he opened up with every passing day, the way the rich brat act became softer and more genuine.
"How have you been?" said Andromeda, with a shrewd look.
"I've joined a group," said Ginny, collapsing into the chair beside him one February morning, her enthusiasm not at all dulled by the fact that she was still in her Quidditch gear and dripping with rain. "I think you should come."
"Urgh," Malfoy sighed. "Fine, but if you think I'm going to be persuaded downstairs for whatever torments await me at that table —"
"Alright, cash it is then," said Harry, repressing his amusement. "Or…"
that is? How

"Oh!" Harry caught on. "Right. Twenty quid?"
"I could

get an apology? It seemed unlikely. It seemed weirdly important to Malfoy, to keep hating him.
"Oh, silly me, how could I forget," said Malfoy flatly, eyes going dull, and Harry cursed himself.
"If I thought every day was going to be like this I'd top myself," said Malfoy, glaring at his knees. Harry winced; Malfoy noticed.
Ginny looked down at the lawn. Spotted them. Smirked at Harry.
"You don't
"You're not a coward," he said. Malfoy just gave him a dirty look, as though Harry were insulting his intelligence to say such a thing.
Malfoy did as she asked, eyebrow raised, until he'd locked eyes with Harry.
It helped that Grimmauld took every loving gesture of repair he'd made in the last two years and reflected it back at him, arranging everything perfectly so that Harry's needs were catered to in every corner. It looked after the others — everyone was delighted with their lighter, bigger, brighter rooms — but it had a strong Harry bias. When Harry accidentally dropped a piece of litter, he could look away for a second and it was in the bin when he looked back. Seamus made the mistake of testing this magic himself, and found the smell of bins followed him around for a week, no matter where he stood.
Ron and Hermione's rooms were opposite the drawing room, in the master suite — they had a double bedroom, dressing room, and bathroom to themselves. Harry knocked on the dressing room door with his elbow; there was silence for a moment, and then Hermione stuck her head out, haloed by a billowing cloud of potions fumes.
"No I'm feckin' awful," said Seamus, and retched again. "Bloody Annamarie gave me her lurgy."
"Alright," said Neville.
She ducked behind the two-seater sofa behind Seamus, casually shimmying out of the Quidditch top as she went; Harry sharply looked away, meeting Dean's eye as he did the same.
he preferred to be quiet… thinking of it felt uncomfortably close to that hot, heavy panic that rose in his chest.
"You're also an idiot." Harry nudged him in the ribs. "We all did what we thought was right or necessary at the time, with the tools we had. But how many people can honestly say they've realised their mistakes and changed themselves, rather than do the easier thing? How many other people are out there who refuse to change even when reality stares them in the face?"
"Have you?" said Harry, surprised.
"Yes, there was
"So soon?" said Harry. "Surely they need notice, or references, or something."
There was a faint thud as a dozen women tried to follow.
He turned to go. Malfoy caught his shoulder before he could, turned Harry to face him.

"Got some nice hats, scarves and coats here," said John in a loud, clear voice, to a crowd that developed surprisingly quickly. "You know the rules — one item of each, take only what you need and leave the rest for others. Form an orderly queue and Harry here will be able to help you out."
"Spider?" said Harry, wrinkling his nose. Fish pulled a face, his red nose wrinkling in distaste.
A moment of silence.
"In light of this," said Ginny, now staring at the table, a faint blush crawling up her neck. "My next request might be a little awkward and I fully respect your right to say no."
He caught Draco by the wrist, pulling him towards the stairs. Draco's expression was strange, unreadable, but Harry didn't know why — for Harry, happiness bubbled in him like champagne, every step up to his room light as air.
"I don't —" he said, and it came out hoarse. He cleared his throat. "I don't want to be treated differently."
He started working out with Ginny more, pouring his frustration into physical exercise. Sick of being trapped in his fears, he began walking in Muggle London, wandering through new parks, pacing down streets of fancy houses, stopping at funny coffee shops and window-shopping in high streets he hadn't known were there. He went to the touristy places from Hermione's Pamphlet. He went to see Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London, Oxford Street and Big Ben. He imagined what Malfoy would say to each one, and felt a bitter sadness sink into his bones.
"Maybe I learn better at night."
"Alright," said Harry. "If it's the principle of the thing." He reached out and drew a fifty pence out of the pile. "I'll buy myself a Mars Bar on you."
"It certainly can't get worse. But it's remarkable how little that helps you cope with the
Harry glanced down at his bare chest, and realised he'd left his t-shirt over the arm of the chair.
"I say, Malfoy!" said Ernie Macmillan, strolling over to him with a hand outstretched. "I thought you were in prison, old chap!"
"Oh, Harry!" she said. "It's easy. I'll get you a sign-up form. You can come with me on the next shift!"
"Yeah, alright," he said. "Meet you over there by that lamp post when you're done with the God-botherers."
"Parkinson," said Harry, copying Draco's habit of turning formal when he couldn't summon anything genuine. "It was — nice to see you. I hope the rest of your trip is pleasant."
Harry snorted, and headed back up the kitchen stairs. Absent-mindedly rubbing wax into the bannister of the second-floor staircase, he wondered if he should be upset. His ex, having loud sex with a strange man. And it was true that he
"Harry, come and say hello," said Ginny, in her 'gentle persuasion' voice — the one that would have annoyed Harry, if he were capable of feeling anything except intense discomfort.
"We all have eyes, let's not pretend," said Malfoy swiftly.
"How unexpectedly interesting of you," said Pansy, surveying Ginny over a sip of her wine.
hurt people."
"Not in the slightest," said Malfoy, not even giving him a stare.
"Mmm," said Harry eventually, when no clever or coherent comment came to him. Malfoy laughed breathlessly in his ear.
"We'll have a nice dinner party," said Hermione, whose voice sounded a little tight. "I'm sure it will be… lovely."
The guy smirked, eyes barely flicking to Malfoy before they were back on Harry.
Harry looked around at his friends, overflowing with pity and kindness for a man they all had good reason to hate, and swelled with affection for all of them.
Harry just wished he could feel less bitter about it.
"I fucked up," said Harry, after a long moment. "You tried to tell me, and I didn't like what I heard so I went ahead and ignored you, and I did it in the stupidest way I could possibly think of and now he's leaving."
Harry, the Harry he would have been without the Dursleys. A Harry without death dogging his every childhood step.
"Yes," he said. "It seems I'm now Harry Potter's pet. Better than the Dark Lord's, I suppose."
Harry dived back onto the bed and slid between Draco's legs, finally able to press every bare inch of himself against him. He felt the pleasure of it crawl across the surface of his skin in a breathtaking shiver, his groan falling against Draco's mouth.
way, Harry."
" — And I know there is absolutely nothing I can say that can change what I've done, and I don't expect you to accept my apology," Malfoy was saying, as Harry neared the door.
"Oh," said Neville. "Oh, good. I'm glad."
She flashed him a vicious grin, and Malfoy exhaled sharply in relief.
definitely becoming more Slytherin, or at least trying to be.
"Come and sit with us." Her voice was gentle but firm. Malfoy glanced back at the door, then at the seat beside Luna, opened his mouth as though he were about to decline, and then promptly sat down.
Then he sank his head into his hands.
"I don't think anyone has ever described me as
"Oh no," said the shopkeeper, grinning at Harry. He was kind of attractive up close, a bit older than Harry but still in his twenties, with deep hazel eyes and cheekbones to rival Malfoy's. "I think your housemates will hate your new collection. Barring the Basement Jaxx album, that's pretty banging."
At the desk, all the letters and notes and scraps of paper he'd discarded in his quest for his mother's letter had been neatly arranged in drawers, roughly in date order. Harry felt his eyes prickle. Kreacher had been no fan of Sirius, but he must have taken the time to do this. He must have known that one day, Harry would want to be here.
The next hour flew by in a blur of fascinating and completely awkward conversation. Most people picked something out of the box in silence and then shuffled away. A few tried to take armfuls, but Harry used his DA voice to ask, gently, if they really needed all that. Several people talked to themselves in the queue, and one particularly memorable man shouted bizarre obscenities at anyone who got close to him. One woman flirted with him outrageously, until someone else mercifully dragged her away.
"Ahh,
The two ladies tittered, and the one sitting closest to the van hopped up into the back of it. Hermione took up a position by the vast tureen, and they all began to distribute plastic cups of soup, bread rolls, and cups of tea down the line with practiced ease.
Harry needed to be in company, supervised, before he did something stupid. He jumped up, reaching past Draco for the drawing room door handle, but Draco was kind of in the way, and Harry's lunge was ill-judged, so the two of them ended up almost chest-to-chest. He let out a sharp breath.
Luna smiled at him again, but mercifully her eyes drifted back to her embroidery before he had a chance to get uneasy.
"I don't know," said Harry. Malfoy wasn't in the downstairs hallway. They strode up the stairs, both of them serious despite Ron's glittering green torso, and at the top Harry spotted Malfoy curled in the far corner of the corridor. He was slumped against the wall, his head between his knees, chest heaving.
"Huh. For a minute there you sounded just like Hermione."
Rattled, and annoyed that he had only himself to blame, he retreated to the kitchen. With his feet up at the kitchen table, he let the stones of the fireplace go blurry in his vision as he tried to make sense of what he'd just heard.
His eyes went wide.
"It is hard sometimes," she said. "Like everyone's reading from an instruction manual on how to be, and I have a completely different manual which seems to make sense to me but everyone assures me is completely wrong. Sometimes people are even angry about it."
"Oh, that time Hermione was a peeping tom," explained Harry. Ron gave him an evil grin.
"How do you want to do this, then?" said Harry, as gently as he knew how. "Do you want me to just keep out of your way?"
," said Malfoy. "I am very clear on this. And I
"What makes you think I've any intention of seeing the Manor again, let alone renovating it?"
"Makes sense," said Malfoy, which wasn't what he was expecting. Ron would have told him that people loved him, Hermione would have given him a gentle lecture on facing his fears, and none of it would have helped.

"Harry," he growled. He looked angrier than he'd ever seen him. "You better not be talking about who I think you're talking about. He locked me in a dungeon! In his ancestral fucking

I didn't — you're completely misreading — are you
"Oh," said Harry, suddenly reminded uncomfortably of Dean, watching Harry kiss Ginny and breaking a glass. "Oh, right. No, don't worry. For a start, she was definitely the instigator."
"Potter," said Malfoy at his shoulder, nervous. "Are you okay?"
"Great," he said, obviously pleased at the size of the sale. "Here, I'll ring you up."
gay… it was hardly the wildest thought, given some of the things he'd heard the past few days, but nevertheless it had never really occurred to Harry that it might actually be
looking to see if it were Malfoy.
Instead, he smirked at Draco, his hair escaping from behind his ear as he tilted his head. He let his voice drop low.
. Like it hurt him to be so. He wondered what Malfoy senior had to say about it… not much he could say from Azkaban, Harry supposed.
He was grudgingly impressed. Owls were the favoured bird for post not just because they could find so many addresses on the vaguest instruction, but also because they were immune to a huge amount of magic, especially navigation and tracking magic. It would have been no easy feat to follow it here, and dependent upon having a sharp eye and a very good broom.
"Well?" asked Ginny.
He adjusted the cloak. He'd really hate it if someone found him in the library after hours, even though he wasn't technically a student any more.
"Hi," said Harry, and then he was enveloped in the warmth of Hermione's hug, too-tight. He turned to bury his face in her soft hair, her familiar smell.
"Why?" asked Luna, tilting her head.
"Alright, stop it, guys, we all did what we had to," he said, staring down at his dinner with a slight smile. Malfoy winced at this, but he looked perhaps a little less petrified.
"Why a lily?" she asked, grasping him by the wrist and examining the skin of his arm.
"I don't think I associate Snape with subtlety at all," snapped Harry.
Andromeda took the box, tapped it with her wand to expand it, and then looked at the label in dismay.
Harry took a step, caught Draco by the elbow and tugged him towards the bed. Then he flopped down onto the mattress on one elbow in a manner that Harry hoped conveyed 'comfortable conversation' and not 'flailing idiot', or worse, 'very bad come-on'.
"Yeah," he agreed. "It's
Harry continued to study Draco for a long moment until Draco huffed, grabbed the clipboard, and pushed it into Harry's hands. Harry, swallowing down his guilt, filled out the form and handed it back to Ellie.
"Alright, Harry?" she said. "I think we probably need to talk."
At least it suited his mood.
"See you next week?"
"Read out the list, Dean," said Harry tiredly, passing it to him and letting the catalogue slide to the floor. Ginny leapt up to grab it back.
"One more thing. It's not forever."
a trap."
Harry dragged himself to the record player and put on OK Computer. They listened to it in silence, and when it ended, Malfoy sat up.
eyes on him, but who was counting?
"Bloody hell, Seamus," he said, "I thought it was going to be something important."
Malfoy heaved a sigh.
He looked away. Harry wanted to touch him, felt the warmth of Malfoy's fingers around his wrist like a brand.
"Seems terribly unfair that
"Here." He thrust the paper bag at Draco, who pulled out the little dragon figurine with delicate fingers.
"Rubber ducky," said Hermione, and the door opened.
Harry blinked at her, trying to decide if this exchange was a good or a bad thing, and what on earth she was talking about.
"Nah," said Ron, still giving Hermione a weird look, and Hermione shook her head. Harry strolled out of the kitchen, but well-honed instincts for eavesdropping kept him close to the kitchen door. Sure enough, as soon as he was out of sight he heard Ron hiss,
Then he rolled them both over, so Draco was underneath him.
Harry's hands hurt and his head ached and he was conscious of every inch of his own body, of the heat where it met Draco's, of the hot, unmistakeable hardness pressing into his hip. He shifted, and Malfoy broke the kiss to exhale sharply, and Harry looked blurrily at the silver lashes inches from his own before it occurred to him that he was
"Fine by me," said Hermione, smiling gently at Malfoy, who visibly sank into his chair.
He took in the room beyond, blinking in surprise. He'd expected the place to look exactly as he'd seen it before — turned over, dusty, a mess — but it seemed that Kreacher held no fear of entering here. The dust was banished. The bed was neatly made. Gone were the magazines, papers and old correspondence that Harry had casually tossed about in his search for his mother's letter; the old clothes and shoes were back in the drawers, the trinkets and knick-knacks arranged neatly on the bookshelf.
Ron took it better than he expected, an odd glint in his eye.
Harry wondered if Malfoy had been expecting more censure from him, more hostility, but Harry didn't really see the point of it now. Piling on the guilt neither healed the wounds of the war, nor gave Malfoy the chance to be a better person.
"Yeah," said Harry, turning back to his book, staring at it in the hope it would somehow grab his attention off Malfoy. He was still staring, unseeing, when he heard the front door slam.
"I'm aware of that," he said.
Ginny looked annoyed, but she heaved a sigh and made a visible effort to mask it.
"My mother's name," he said. "She died when I was young."
"How come there's no C flat?" he said.
"How long does that take?" said Ginny.
, Harry?"
Behind McGonagall, the brand new portrait of Dumbledore winked.
Worst of all, he couldn't think of any way to wiggle his way out of attending. He wondered if a Notice-Me-Not Charm would work when people would be specifically looking for him in the crowd.
"I don't think she'd like you to call it a phase," said Harry mildly, slinging his arm along the back of the bench. Hermione grimaced.
Still, that evening he decided he would have to do something. He had to use the Marauder's Map to find her; she was in an alcove on the fourth floor, not far from the common room, sat on the windowsill opposite Dean.
"So do you, and you're still here," said Harry. Draco looked startled, but then his lip curled in amusement, eyes laser-focused on Harry's.
look like to you?"
"Are you going to be nicer to me now?"
"I know you live to serve, Potter," he said, with a punchable smirk that Harry chose to ignore. Instead, he focused on filling the cafetière, comforted by the rich and familiar smell of the grounds, the pleasing sight of the water filling the jug.
"He's just sheltered," said Dean.
" he said again. "Please, Draco, can't we just — "
Then he sighed.
Harry grinned.
Headmistress McGonagall looked disapprovingly over her glasses. Harry squirmed in her new office, feeling like a first year. How could he feel like this, when only a few months before he'd killed the darkest wizard in a century?
"He told me why, Malfoy, and what happened next, it wasn't the point of the story," said Neville, cutting off the awkward flow. "That's not why I'm asking. Did you do it to anyone else?"
"Hey," he said. "Buy you a drink? I can introduce you to Jenny. Well, if she lets me in, which she probably will if I flash this cash."
"Yeah, that's right. I'm a
don't want to be the instigator of some sort of dreadful housemate drama. So, no."
"Alright, alright," said Harry, throwing a cushion at him. Seamus caught it, and tucked it behind his head. "I'm not an
He rose from their circle, cross-legged on the hearth, and didn't quite look either of them in the eye as he left.
Malfoy liked men.
, thought Harry.
Dean gave him a vague, distracted smile.
hate you. Not any more. Even when you're the biggest git who ever lived."
"I'm sure he'd give you his number too," added Harry innocently, and Malfoy shot him a suspicious look, like he knew Harry was winding him up.
"Er," he said. "Right. I mean, not right actually, Hermione. You're aware of Ginny?"
"Harry..." she said. "Are you trying to... come out to me?"
Malfoy flinched at his tone, and Harry's anger dissipated into icy shame. He looked at Draco for a long time, tension snapping a pulse along his jaw. He didn't want to see Draco's face like that, but he couldn't go to the group. He
it a bit rough. Prefer it, one could say. I'll tell you if it's too much." His eyes darkened, flicking down to Harry's cock. "I want to
Then he looked at Harry.
"Potter," said Pansy, eyes flicking to him, voice cool. She took a small step back from Draco.
"Some of these must have been bought by Regulus, Harry, not Sirius," said Hermione, who was surprisingly enchanted by the record collection. "This one is from 1977, wouldn't Sirius have left by then?"
Harry shrugged.
One rainy, dark Friday, Harry made his way downstairs to the kitchen to start dinner only to find Malfoy there already, chopping onions. His eyes were very red, his mouth downturned. Kreacher was on a chair behind him, wringing his hands.
Harry's chest ached.
Draco's magic was as graceful as the rest of him. Harry took another moment to appreciate the full elegance of Draco's naked body in front of him, before he remembered that he was supposed to be learning the spells.
In the drawing room, Draco settled on the sofa and Pansy curled up beside him immediately, head on his shoulder and legs up on the seat. Harry remembered that they'd always been clingy, but he didn't remember a time when it had truly annoyed him. In school, it had been Hermione who'd hated her.
Harry shifted uncomfortably, painfully aware of Draco's warmth next to him on the bench.
Unfortunately, the difficulties of the day meant that he had completely forgotten to eat. His stomach was growling painfully by three o'clock, and as Ron and Hermione had still not returned, Harry was considering desperate measures.
to hate you! I haven't for ages, and I promise you that the fancying thing is pretty horrifyingly new and weird and I
"You could do it yourself," said Harry.
"Lucius Malfoy on drums," said Harry, and Ron doubled over in half-horrified laughter.
"It's not," said Hermione firmly. "It's of no consequence to anyone you know, and nobody else's business. Do you want to talk about it? What made you say you don't work the same way as everyone else?"
"Right," said Malfoy, miserably. "Well, that's as much as I can ask. More, really. I'll keep out of your way."
"You probably
"I might have gone a little teetotal," he heard Draco mutter. "Just a touch. Doesn't agree with me. I'm sure you understand."
"Happy New Year," he said, again. Draco pulled him into another long kiss.
Seamus frowned. "What's Malfoy Manor got to — oh. Oh, no, fuck
"What use are you then?" said the man, winking at him, and began to rummage in the box. A small queue began to form behind him.
Sure enough, he received a mountain of cottage pie with vegetables and extra gravy to boot, and Harry tucked in with enthusiasm. Kreacher wrung his hands and muttered to himself about Hogwarts standards and the noble house of Black and how he hoped Harry liked it.
"Naturally, but one must be brave sometimes," said Draco, tossing his hair, and Harry snorted at the face he pulled.
"Interesting," she said, sounding amused. "I wonder if he'll turn the charm on me."
be – and it seemed unavoidable that he should cover Malfoy's smirking lips. Malfoy was quick and a little vicious, biting Harry's lip and digging his nails into Harry's hips, and Harry realised he was still shoving Malfoy,
Without waiting for an answer, Fish sauntered off.
"Yeah," said Harry, sticking his hands awkwardly into his jeans pockets. He wondered if this was where Hermione got her Pamphlets.
"Well, this'll be fun," he said, squeezing Hermione's hand, and headed off to the kitchen.
"Glad to see you've noticed," said Harry dryly, body keenly missing the contact.  "Ow, my head."
people who are convinced they aren't."
right now was a joke.
Maybe that wasn't true, though. Maybe that was just another irrational thought.
"I don't think anyone pops to the soup run because they fancy a spot of free soup, Ron," said Hermione. "Besides, he didn't look in great shape. Pretty bad, to be honest."
"Yes, but –"
anyway?"
"Do you think I could have a moment to talk to Draco alone?" she said.
It surprised Harry how the fear rose in him. The book had warned him about relapse. It told him to keep his expectations in check. But Harry's fluttering heart hadn't got the message.
He found Malfoy in the drawing room. He'd flung himself across one sofa, too long and too sharp and too pale against the worn chintz. He was wearing a pair of grey jogging bottoms, and a brown jumper that was too big — an outfit he would have expected to have come out of his own wardrobe rather than Malfoy's.
"This really is so much worse than I thought it would be," said Malfoy quietly, staring at his fork. Harry sighed.
Harry gave up on his attempts at modesty. He got up to finish his charade, booed good-naturedly as Neville's team won, and carried on the celebration until he no longer cared about the night's losses, trouser-related or otherwise.
"I can about abusive ones," Dean countered. "Look —"
"Might help with the vomiting," she said, holding it out. "But it won't cure a virus."
"I wondered where you went," said Draco, and Harry's heart flipped.
Malfoy looked surprised, tinged with something that Harry thought seemed a little bit like longing. Then he sighed.
"Thanks, Dray, you're a good mate. Glad to see you've landed on your feet." The look Fish gave Harry was sly. "'Ere, you dishing out that soup or what?"
"For us all," agreed Ron, looking at Malfoy, who'd gone spiky and pale.
"Are you done?" said Harry, a little more shortly than he intended. "Er, wouldn't want to be late."
"Was he?" Harry interrupted. "Thought that was Snape just smarming up."
Harry watched the others pack up the van with adrenaline thrumming in his veins. The cold night air stung sharp and heavy in his chest. John clapped him on the shoulder, and Harry jumped; John gave him an apologetic look, and folded his hands carefully behind his back.
you either. Now, if you'd be so good as to leave me alone, I have packing to do."
"Harry," interrupted Hermione. "That wasn't quite what I meant, and aren't you forgetting something important?"
Harry hoped his smile was not too obviously a grimace. "Yeah."
"I don't think it's that kind of place, Harry," said Luna, smiling, and Harry's blood ran cold at the possibility of Malfoy moving into some dank drug den. But it was done, and there was nothing Harry could do about it now.
"Oh Malfoy, my dark hero," she said, dropping her broom and flinging herself melodramatically into his arms. He caught her, surprisingly deftly, and he looked surprised and a little pleased as she laughed at him. Then a funny look came over his face, and Ginny frowned.
"Yeah, but you'd hate Pansy if she wore a sack," said Ron, grinning.
something to you? You're playing an elaborate prank, you must be —"
There simply wasn't enough to do. Harry had carved himself a cavern of safety and order, and now he was trapped in it.
"Positively tranquil," he said, dry, and looked surprised and maybe even slightly pleased when the whole table snickered at this — barring Neville, who was still watching Malfoy with a faint air of suspicion.
"Fine," said Malfoy, glaring now. "I won't be tactful with you. I hate you."
"Bank accounts give you legitimacy in the Muggle world! You can't just
Draco's expression turned serious.
than Quidditch, perhaps?"
"I need you right here, right now," she said. "Oh,
He reached for the biology textbook. Harry went for it as well, but Malfoy got there first and held it out of Harry's reach.
"This is a number for a guy I know," he said. "Cash-in-hand labouring. It's not consistent, but it's something."
"Can we go for a walk?" she said. "I think it would help."
," snarled Malfoy. "And I don't need your help!"
"What would you know about it?" said Malfoy, eyes narrowed in perfect hatred. "It's not like you invited any to your little hero club."
Draco you're after? What for? And I'll have chicken tikka masala, peshwari naan, onion bhajis and a beer, thanks." He gestured at the Indian restaurant beside them. "And rice."
"He can watch," said Shev, grinning. "Hold your hand, if you need it."
"Let me get this straight," said Malfoy, with a twitch of his lips. "You're having trouble... in the bedroom... with Girl Weasley... so Granger sent you here for 'self-reflection'?"
"Sorry, am I interrupting?"
problem," agreed Malfoy.
"There," he said, face pinched and voice rough from the drink. There was green glistening on his lower lip. "Damage is done now."
"I actually hate you," said Malfoy fervently, but he looked a little less miserable.
"So you've never desperately wanted to fuck someone you loathe?" said Draco, pushing him back into the bush a little with his hips, smirk playful.
"I was trying to get him to leave off!" said Harry.
"It's a genre," said Dean. "Maybe I'll play you some if we can ever figure out a Muggle soundsystem. God knows how the record player works, some impressive spellwork going on in there. We tried bringing an actual CD player in, but the House Magic fried it immediately."
Harry was frustrated. Why hadn't Malfoy said any of this? Harry was sure they could have fixed the paperwork situation between them, and Dean would know all about Muggle jobs for Draco since he looked in the paper so often…
"It was Malfoy who gave me the bump on my head," he said.
"I don't know if I want to." Draco's voice was very quiet. "Everyone's rather drunk."
Harry considered backing out of volunteering a hundred ways, but he couldn't think of a way that wouldn't make Hermione disappointed in him. But the evening stroll with Hermione was nice, at the very least, and the soup run itself wasn't at all what he expected. He supposed he'd been imagining something more polished than three middle-aged ladies and a round-bellied older man loitering at the back of a van.
"Then it's settled," said Neville, who also looked a little relieved, although Harry knew
"Kreacher will be serving hot drinks in the drawing room." He accompanied this with a deep bow. Harry shifted in his uncomfortable chair, and wanted to hug him a bit. He wasn't sure what he'd do without him.
"Er," said Ron. "Yeah, just an, um, tasteful publicity shot. She's got all that blonde hair you see, and she's pulling a bit of a lady Godiva with it on her Firebolt…"
Seamus's birthday was going to be a bit of a problem.
"Don't need to," said Harry. "Little old ladies ask her in the shops all the time. Her grandparents came over from the Caribbean in the fifties, her mum from Guyana and her dad from Jamaica. That's how they met — they both went on the same cruise to, um, connect to their heritage?" Harry frowned at the blades of grass beneath him. "I guess that's what I'm asking about. Heritage."
"Oh yes, I forgot that I was in the presence of almighty hero Potter," he drawled, but it wasn't particularly convincing. "Fine, since you're such a relentless interrogator, I will tell you. I went to the council to try to get someone to explain how this godforsaken
"What?"
Then Draco wrenched himself away, panting, and Harry stared at him wildly.
"Goyle went to prison with his father. Parkinson would have had enough to run off to the continent with the rest of them."
"Well if you are, then so am I," said Harry, "Because I know what you mean."
"Ritchie!" protested Harry, fending him off. "This isn't like you at all!"
going to ignore me."
Hermione threaded her arm through Harry's. Harry felt rather as if he were being frogmarched to his doom.
"Subtle enough to spy," said Draco. "Subtle enough to best the Dark Lord."
It was dim, fully shadowed by the neighbouring buildings and blocked at the midway point by a rusting fridge-freezer jammed in between the two shops. There were empty takeaway boxes and leaflets on the floor, and an unfolded cardboard box propped up in front of the fridge. Harry mistook the box for junk at first, until he realised it had been deliberately placed to make a makeshift shelter.
Eventually, they unearthed the edges of the overgrown lawn, flagstones and statues scattered across the space like islands in a sea of long, brown grass. Harry mowed it back with the shed's rusty scythe, and Kreacher vowed to maintain the lawn with an unsettling fanaticism.
leeway?
"Really?" said Dean. "It's kind of a busy place. You know, public."
Or at least, he hadn't been thinking in those terms. But now he mentioned it, it didn't sound that bad an idea to Harry.
"Depends, dunnit," he said.
"Very different," said Harry, eyes narrowed. Pansy swallowed, eyes flicking downward, but she wasn't cowed for long.
"Probably the knock on the head. I hope you're brain damaged."
"Shit. I'm an idiot. I'll do it another day, obviously, if I do it at all. This can't be easy — "
of it. Malfoy had poured his heart out last week, but now he was here being smooth and confident and genuinely charming, as though he'd already bounced back from his lowest point. And he'd taken it upon himself to charm everyone
Then he sat up.
"I'm aware I'm describing a squat," said Draco, scowling as though Harry had said something insulting. "But honestly, it's rather nice. Very artistic. I sleep on a
The man grinned back. "New, eh? How are you finding it, feeding the needy?" He clasped his free hand to his chest and raised his eyes to the sky.
It was a good day, cold but bright, and Harry felt the comforting pulse of the jacket's ancient Warming Charms as he stomped up the road. Malfoy hurried to catch up with him, attempting to walk and unfold the map at the same time.
Harry stared at the planes of Draco's face, familiar and dear. The idea of never knowing the man he was now hit deep in the stomach.
"Yeah." Ron grimaced. "She's not let up on me in weeks. I know she's grieving, we're
"Barely," said Malfoy. "I suppose I can
"Nothing specific," he murmured. "Sort my life out, I guess."
Adhikari's smile was gentle.
"Oh, you know," said Harry airily, repressing a grin. "Mostly the Gryffindor class of '98."
. He'd bring me pills and tea and then he'd sit with me on the sofa and cuddle and watch TV shows I can't even remember now. I couldn't think straight, I felt nauseous all the time, everything felt dull and far away. I thought there was something horribly wrong with me, that I'd finally pushed my body too far, that I was broken. It took me
He leapt up and darted back to the drawing room for a second, returning with his lumpy carrier bag.
"I —" said Blaise, as though she wanted to say something comforting, or perhaps apologise. "I'm glad to see you've landed on your feet."
"Cornelius Fudge," guessed Harry, from his position under the kitchen sink. Hermione jumped.
"Can't blame you, with flavour like that," said Harry, smirking. "Um, can I ask you a question?"
"How was I supposed to knock on a
"That's very kind.” Malfoy spoke quietly to his plate. He looked strangely guilty, and Harry suddenly missed the Malfoy of minutes before, tentatively smiling as Hermione bickered with him about elemental magic.
"What about you?" he asked.
"At first, I fought back," said Malfoy, with a dark laugh. "I never flirted with anyone, and I told him so. When he was mean about my cooking, I'd tell him he could make it himself. I started asking
"Oh joy," Pansy interrupted, examining her nails over her fork, "Quidditch talk."
"Free soup, innit," said Fish, and winked. Then a lady behind him barged up to wheedle an extra serving of potatoes, and with a roll of his eyes, Fish swaggered off into the night. Draco stared after him for a moment.
"Daphne and Astoria are like chalk and cheese." Pansy waved a dismissive hand. "Honestly, you'd
Harry found him sitting in the corridor, his head thrown back against the wall.
speaking, a Mind Healing Potion. It's used in rare cases of neurological trauma, particularly the Cruciatus. It's a kind of… brain refresh. You might not know this, but opiate abuse can seriously damage your brain. This can go
"Tea?" he asked, ruffling a hand through his hair and staring desperately at the teapot as if it might whistle the words he knew he was about to need.
"If you don't want to see me —" began Harry.
Harry wanted a drink, but now that Malfoy was here, he knew he'd have to brave the dining room to get it. Still, he felt better now, and he wasn't honestly sure if downstairs might be more on his level — virtually everyone else was down there. In contrast, Blaise and Padma sounded like they were debating magical physics by the fireplace and looking thrilled about it. Ernie had managed to corner Hermione to talk politics. Lavender was sitting on the rug trying to persuade a giggling Parvati to eat something, and Neville and Hannah were in the corner, kissing. Malfoy lingered at Blaise's side, eyes vacant and the corner of his mouth downturned.
He went down to the drawing room. Malfoy was there, standing in shadow beside the family tapestry, fingers running over the blast-hole where the tapestry once read
"I — yes," admitted Malfoy. "I was — I can't justify it, I wish I could, I really did want to hurt him more than anything else in the world in that moment, I know I can't make excuses for that but maybe I could explain — "
Ron and Hermione were engaged in some enthusiastic snogging on the sofa.  Harry sat for a good ten minutes before they noticed.
"Whatever," said Malfoy, slumping.
"I think I might be bisexual," she said, after a while.
Then the rest of them left the breakfast table to work or study and Harry was left alone, with nothing to do but fight Kreacher over who got to do the washing up. Thursday daytimes were always bad, but today was particularly dire, as heavy rain meant that the garden needed no tending, and there wasn't much left to do about the house.
He rocked gently into Draco as the shocks faded, and as he came to himself he felt the hot wetness of Draco's second orgasm splash against his chest. The sound Draco made could have made him come again, if he hadn't already.
"Where'd you go just then?" she said, pulling herself out of her swoon.
"Yes," said Harry, and then spent the rest of the evening trying to think of ways to get out of it.
Harry thought about arguing, but he understood it too well. He knew what made Draco believe he wasn't worthy of good things, he knew how that felt. It was a stubborn rot, tangled deep in the core of both of them, and he wouldn't be extracting it tonight.
"Additionally," said Adhikari, straightening up, "I hope I am not presuming too much to assume that confidentiality is very important to you, so let me reassure you that the security spellwork on my client files is of the highest quality and regularly evaluated, and I am bound by law and more importantly ethics never to disclose the content of our sessions to anyone unless compelled by Ministry warrant, or in cases where I believe you or another person is at imminent risk of harm. That said, given that this is such a special circumstance, and in case there are things you might tell me that might pose a risk to public safety if disclosed, I am happy to make an Unbreakable Vow to the same effect."
Harry stared at him.
They materialised on the dark pavement of Grimmauld Place. Malfoy swayed; Harry kept his arm looped through his.
"So, if you want Dean, I'd go get him, because I think he's besotted with you and you deserve that," said Harry.
Harry had only a few memories of Aunt Petunia that weren't tainted by the looming spectre of Vernon Dursley. As a young child, he'd held this strange and painful urge to be near to her, coupled with the fervent desire not to be noticed and subsequently told to go away. But by the time school came around, Harry rarely saw Aunt Petunia without Uncle Vernon there, and Aunt Petunia in the company of Uncle Vernon was an Aunt Petunia he was happy to hate.
Malfoy didn't respond, so Harry picked up his bowl and pulled himself up from the pouffe.
All the younger boys smirked. Harry grabbed his pillow back.
," said Dean, shrugging. "He said there was nothing he could say to make it right, but that he was sorry, and if there was anything he could do to contribute to my comfort or recovery, he would do his best."
need you, and I don't
Malfoy sniffed, and that was Harry's answer.
Harry couldn't help the bark of laughter.
"Lalalalala!" said Harry. "Why did you do that to me, Ron? Now I can't think of anything else!"
"You is very welcome, Master Harry," said Kreacher, and it sounded like he meant it, though Harry never really knew for sure if he was ever doing the right thing when it came to Kreacher.When he'd first begun the renovations, Harry had suggested, gently, that perhaps Kreacher might want to be a free elf one day, and Kreacher had been inconsolable for days, the whole house turning dark and dusty around him.
"I can't believe you invited him," said Dean, "How are we going to handle the alcohol now?"
but..."
"An obvious mistake," said Malfoy, but he didn't move.
"God, Potter, how have you
Then Malfoy was shoving too, shoving until Harry's back met the sharp spine of a book, pinning him down as he thrust his tongue into Harry's mouth. Then Malfoy tilted Harry's head and bit down on his neck, licking the mark as he tugged Harry's shirt out of his jeans. Harry groaned, unable to think with Malfoy's hips grinding against his, and scrabbled at Malfoy's chest. He struggled with himself, struggled not to succumb to this, but then there were fingers at his zip and a mouth against his earlobe and a sudden, shocking hand sliding down into his boxers.
Malfoy looked like he was going to be sick.
that low-cut on anyone else."
"No, I'm single," said Harry in a low tone, wondering how you showed that you didn't care that you were being hit on by a man. It was excruciatingly embarrassing, Harry was useless at flirting, but he'd managed to convey
Draco lifted one shoulder, head tipping towards Harry. His hair brushed Harry's shoulder, ticklish.
"Well," said Hermione, voice soft. "As I said, I can't make you go, but if you're hoping for an ally in this household, you'd better make me believe you are taking this opportunity seriously."
"I wish I'd known them," said Draco quietly. His finger was resting over the hole where Andromeda used to be. "The ones behind the burn marks, I mean. Sometimes, I wonder… if I'd known them, maybe things would have turned out differently."
"I don't think you know me that well then."
Oh yes, there were rules, they were written all over Malfoy's face, though Harry thought it might be hurting Draco to follow them. As though, if he had a choice, he might be inclined to choose Harry for a bit.
"Sorry," said Malfoy, making Dean jump.
Harry blinked at the door. It's not that he didn't
"You know me," said Harry, gesturing at the kitchen. "Lord of the Manor."
"I love it," he said, eyes prickling.
Fish's remorse looked brief. He took a large swig of beer.
"Er," said Harry, filled with a sudden and passionate curiosity, but suspecting tattoos to be the last thing Malfoy wanted to look at right now. But Malfoy had stopped, transfixed, staring at a design. It was a skull, but from the eye sockets burst bright flowers, lilies and roses and curling leaves in a trailing halo all around it.
"It's the little one here," said Dean, showing Ginny the page.
"And how
"Potter. What a surprise. You know, all this following me around could be taken the wrong way, you know."
"Oh!" said Harry. "That'll be Kreacher. You'll get them back pretty sharp I'd think."
for both Daphne and Astoria to be married and produce many strong magical grandchildren. And given how thoroughly Daphne has constructed her entire personality around being impossible to romance, he looks increasingly to Astoria."
Renovating Grimmauld had never really been a
Harry felt a flare of alarm, quickly tamped down.
Harry settled into Draco's chest, hope soaring. It was a tentative plan, fragile, but it made him deliriously happy to imagine. Cutting the ribbon on the grand opening with Draco — the two of them, dust-covered and wands out, turning another Dark-tainted shell into a place of light and happiness. It could work. It seemed
weird about it.
"I'm fine," said Harry, "I think I need a cake. Tea and cake. Where do you reckon?"
. But expecting me to be nice to Potter
Harry froze. It had never even occurred to him that Malfoy would spit on his hospitality like that.
