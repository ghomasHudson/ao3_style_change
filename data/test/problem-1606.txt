While he was going to replicate and send the perfect replica of Sirius Black out of his appartment, the door opened on two identical boys.
“Draco?” The blonde jumped and turned his face paler, than usual, towards Harry.
“Almost all of the parents look happy and totally in love, right now, my parents are probably making Lyra or the twins. But there is a problem that remains in my mind” Jordan nodded and urged the blond to continue. "We all know how they all defeated Voldemort. The problem is that we are probably changing the past and they’re not looking for these evil objects, I forgot their names”
Harry erected a shield with both hands to counter the wave of spells that was coming toward him. He was on the Quidditch pitch and all the 15 and 16 year old had given themselves the task of training him. The triplets had just entered the room this morning, had opened the curtains wide and had said that he couldn’t hope to defeat Voldemort by using a simple expelliarmus.
“Hey Ad, come on wake up” Zach said softly.
“You had a good night?” She asked him.
“Why?” Ron asked again. Nathaniel and Jordan stared at each other, anxious, and Hermione sighed.
“What’s happening?” Harry asked.
“I'm watching the stairs until Dad and Daddy go upstairs” Ascella began.
“Thank you!” Harry exclaimed. Ron raised his head again.
“Us, that's all” Erin answered, whispering as well.
“Are you telling me that I'm going to have to get a piece of Voldemort's soul in a necklace that Umbridge wears on her?"
Draco smiled as Pansy sat next to him, the both of them watching Theo and Blaise joke around on the other couch. Draco knew the whole purpose of this evening was to make him laugh, make him forget the pain.
“He's Hermione and Theo’s son” His brother pursued. They were all astonished and looked at the two interested parties, who had plunged into the book again and did not listen to what was going on.
“Slow down, sweetie, maybe we'll wait for the others.” The three of them were now planted in the hallway, Harry and Malfoy holding hands with Lesath. Harry was going to suggest that they go into the living room to wait for the others when he saw Hermione coming out of one of the rooms, further down the hall.
“If you kill me... you'll go to Azkaban” Ezekiel chuckled a little hysterically, making him look slightly like a madman.
“Pansy!” Draco cut him off. She then apologized for her behavior and Draco was going to answer her but they saw Harry coming back with a quick step. He passed between Pansy and Theo to reach Draco and grabbed his wrist and left without a word, pulling Malfoy behind him.
“You're so unbelievable” Draco breathed before pulling Harry to him by pulling on his T-shirt. He laid his lips on Harry's in a soft kiss. Finally, they both jumped into the opening. Harry easily guided Draco to where the children were. He froze in front of the show in front of them. Lyra and Eleanor were tied up and gagged. Harry's eyes widened in horror and his paternal instinct took over. Before Draco could see it, he apparated directly into the living room of the apartment. He heard a squeak and footsteps rushed to the floor. A wicked smile spread on his lips as he began to advance like a predator towards the stairs. Ginny ran down and blocked his way.
“You’re drunk”
“Are you all right Dray?” Draco turned to look at him and nodded. They then saw Pansy running towards them, followed at a distance by Theodore.
“Ah uncle Draco! Uncle Harry! You are there!” Harry stood up abruptly, not recognizing that voice. He turned to the door and saw four brown boys there. Draco dropped to the mattress, moaning.
“Yes, yes, sorry Luce” Zephir apologized. Lucius widened his eyes at such familiarity. He sighed and grabbed Harry's arm before Apparating away. Harry nearly lost his balance when they all landed in a dark alley.
“Well, are you still mad and going to yell at me for nothing?” Harry asked, still standing near the door. Draco sat up cross-legged in the middle of the bed, looking at his hands that were playing with the sheets under him.
He couldn’t help but blush, realizing he was now naked in front of Harry. The brown took possession of Draco's lips and he reversed their positions. He kissed the blonde's neck then, sucked the thin skin at his collarbone. He went down even lower after that. He nibbled his nipples one by one and Draco uttered the most exciting moan Harry had ever heard. He then licked the abs finely drawn then he ran his tongue into his navel, then went down again.
“Okay, you can stay with me too” His son gave him a huge smile, then he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and he lifted him off the floor. Molly frowned as she saw that.
“What!?” He shrieked in a strangely sharp voice.
“Don’t worry, it'll be fine” Harry gave him a skeptical look. Knowing Molly, she was going to watch them very carefully and they were going to faint because they couldn’t touch each other.
“Wait, did you say you were gay?” Harry suddenly wondered. He didn’t have time to answer as Draco opened the door grimacing.
“He’s Jordan, but you already know him for the most part, the two little redheads are Irina and Isallys and they are Jordan's sisters” She then showed Nathaniel's fourth friend and the little girl next to him.
“And?” Draco asked in a sleepy voice.
“We're going to eat” Were the only words Malfoy uttered as he walked through the living room with his gracious step, Harry always following him closely. The brunette was making funny faces to the child in Malfoy's arms and the kid was laughing at his antics. All watched as they passed by and were very surprised to see Malfoy smile sincerely and tenderly. His words had silenced Ron, who was watching them now as they walked past him, as if he didn’t exist. They had now passed the door, and everyone in the room stared at the door, which was still open, from where the little blonde's crystalline laugh still came.
“Harry? I... I'd like to... apologize for my behavior... well, I mean, I acted like a jerk, especially since I already knew you were in love with Malfoy. And it was really silly not to talk to you all about all this, especially since these kids are really great” Harry smiled during his friend's short monologue and then stood up and hugged his friend. Ron hugged him back and then got up and went to the bathroom. Once his friend had disappeared, Harry got up and walked as quietly as he could to the room opposite his.
“Hi, Uncle Harry”
“Are you OK ?” He asked Harry. The brunette nodded as Severus hurried toward them. They all three exchanged a look. Severus silently asking if Harry was okay.
“What happened there?” Harry cleared his throat, ready to go into detailed explanations.
“Dumbledore asked me to come back for a children's story and took the opportunity to rehire me for the job”
“You can’t be Draco's or Potter's child and be siblings.”
“Merlin knows why” Theo muttered in his corner. The children glared at him all at once and he raised both hands in surrender.
“But it's because...”
“Do you mean...” began the blond.
“You look like Sirius that's crazy” The boy smiled slightly as he replaced his leather jacket properly on his shoulders, Harry was not mistaken. The door opened a second time.
The next day, all the girls in the house couldn’t be found, and when Harry asked Molly where they were, she simply told him they had some errands to do.
Without his asking, Zach, Lyra and Dimitri also got up and came to supervise him, like bodyguards. They opened the doors to him and made the corridor clear for their passage. Draco found his eldest daughter really impressive by the power she gave off that made all the other students run away. Dimitri and Zachady each opened an infirmary door, letting Lyra and Draco pass, and then let them close. They placed themselves in front of them like guards. Draco sent Lyra to get the nurse while he laid Harry on one of the beds. He looked at the pale brown face and insulted Voldemort for it.
“It's only five!” Harry tried to joke.
“I'm really sorry, but you're right in the middle of the Quidditch pitch and all the morons in the stands are staring at you with shocked looks” Harry glanced at the famous morons and admitted that their expressions were really funny to see. Harry could not continue his observation any longer, Hermione had just thrown herself into his arms.
Zachady looked at Ron then turned his head to Nathaniel.
“Oh holy shit!” He exclaimed suddenly. Everyone stared at him, waiting for an explanation.
When their lips met, Harry moaned in Malfoy’s mouth, deciding following him tonight was the best thing he ever did.
“No I can’t. Because as you said so well, I fainted” Malfoy then grimaced, realizing he was wrong.
“We followed the instructions you left us” One of them began.
“Well, they’re a bit too much, we’re not that powerful” Alya answered. Nathaniel suddenly stilled beside Harry, he was frowning. Harry was about to ask what was wrong when Nath apparated away.
“I have no reason to stay here, I'm going back to our dorm and we'll see each other in the Great Hall tomorrow.” Harry nodded and hugged her before letting her go.
“See you in two days, right?” Blaise asked as they got up to go. He nodded to them before falling on his bed when they were gone.
“What are you doing?” Harry giggled as Draco slammed the first door and pushed Harry against it. He nibbled at his neck and Harry held back as best he could his moan.
“He looks at you like all the time and there’s so much love in his eyes, it’s really disgusting” Blaise added. Draco started to open his mouth in surprise but he doesn’t tell anything.
Harry didn’t pay any attention to her, his bright eyes boring into Draco’s. Draco knew he was fucked. Those puppy eyes always had him doing anything for Harry and the smaller man knew that.
Harry was leaning against the counter, quietly drinking his coffee while Draco was leaning against the wall, also drinking coffee while staring at the window. Their eyes met, and it was at that moment that Harry knew something was going to go wrong. They then rushed towards each other and pressed their lips against each other. Harry had previously put his cup a little further on the worktop so he could put one of his hands on the neck of the blonde while the other was on his ass. The brunet moaned as Draco bit his lower lip. The blonde then grabbed Harry under the thighs and made him sit on the worktop. Harry wrapped his legs around his waist.
Draco rolled his eyes when she blushed a bit. Blaise couldn’t help himself, he had to flirt with every women he came across even though he deeply in love with Theodore.
“Oh sorry, Mione” The blond boy exclaimed, hugging Hermione tightly. They all stared at each other except the brunette boy who seemed to be used to this kind of scene. Hermione pulled back sharply, and stared at the two boys in surprise.
The party went completely crazy when Ginny and Pansy literally threw themselves on each other. Ginny sat astride Pansy who was lying on the floor and kissed her on the mouth. Harry took advantage of the hustle and bustle that caused to grab Draco's wrist and drag him upstairs.
“Daddy, you're going to drain your energy by collecting the necklace, so if one of us does not come to help you, you might spend a long time in a magical coma” Alya explained, more serious than ever. The teachers consulted each other visually.
“No” The redhead replied, her voice distorted by her cheek crushed by the stone wall.
The rumor of a friendly match between parents and children had spread like wildfire in Hogwarts as soon as Dean and Seamus were made aware of it. So almost all the castle was installed in the stands, even the teachers, while the players were on the pitch. Dimitri was waving at Severus with a smile that couldn’t be more insolent on his face. The five children, accompanied by Emett, stood beside Sirius and Remus in the teachers' box. Harry and Erin were flying above everyone else. Draco was standing with Theo between the chasers and Ron, the keeper. The blond, realizing that he had been isolated in recent days, decided to reconnect with one of his best friends.
“What!?” They all shouted in one voice. Dumbledore laughed softly at their astonishment.
“Do you want me to take down the bottom too, Potter?” Harry's eyes widened and he blushed heavily. Why was he fixing him like that? He was not doing well, really. He hurried back to his bed and quickly closed the curtains. He pulled back as far as possible, sticking his back against the wall. He pulled his legs against his chest and rested his chin on his knees. He thought back to the events of the night before and groaned in disappointment as he realized it was clearly not a dream.
“No shit it sounded better in your head!” Zachady exclaimed, outraged.
“You told us a few things about war in the future, you know. And from what I know, we’ll have to start acting. We can’t just let Voldemort attack Daddy without counter-attacking” Draco nodded and looked at Harry for a moment, looking pensive.
“You're the most proficient teacher we've had” Draco interjected. Remus turned his head towards him and frowned.
“Hermione?” The girl turned to them and smiled when she noticed the situation they were in.
She was Pansy and Ginny’s daughter. One of the older was Lorelyn, Lilith and Lena’s sister but she had brown hair. Then, there was Maël and Kyllian who were 11 and 13 and were Dean and Seamus’ sons. They looked like Dean. Eliott was 13 and Remus and Tonks’ son. The last one was Léane, she was 13 and looked just like Hermione. They all got up and Harry helped Léane up. She thanked him with a smile and then stood next to him, looking at her feet. She looked shy, Harry found this cute.
“You should eat instead of trying ate yourself so early in the morning and especially under Lesath's nose” With these words, he almost snatched Lesath from Harry's arms and went to sit down, followed by his two fathers. Hermione was livid.
“I'm not gonna have to do it with you too?” They all nodded, and Jordan grabbed the hands of his two sisters and led them to Ron and Blaise. Lyra, meanwhile, stood next to Harry and Malfoy and only one of her glare was enough to make his three brothers join her. All that remained was Seth, Erika, and Alarik.
“They are Souls Sisters” Erin explained in the same way as her brother.
“Why are you whispering?” Alarik asked. They shrugged.
“Can I go see Dad?” Erika asked Dimitri.
“So why are you yelling at us so early in the morning?” Jordan asked calmly.
“Calm down, we just want to talk to you” She calmed them with a reassuring smile. They didn’t recoil, but didn’t seem very reassured for all that. Harry reached out to them.
“You almost died?!” Molly exclaimed.
Ezekiel glanced at his two sisters who’d just entered the room, he nodded discreetly, and they went about their business. He allowed himself a satisfied little smile when he saw that everything was going as planned. He watched his girlfriend and suddenly took by an envy of romance, went to invite her to dance.
“You pushed him away” Harry breathed, smiling with all his teeth at the blonde. The children asked nothing of their parents since it seemed quite obvious that the problem was indeed Voldemort.
“Er ... yes, actually” Hermione nodded silently, the cogs in her mind seeming to activate.
“Real...” She couldn’t continue her sentence because Theodore had approached her and laid his lips on hers. She closed her eyes under the soft touch and when Theo moved away from her, she smiled and kissed him in turn. He wrapped his arms around her waist and hugged her.
“Is there someone?” A female voice asked. Harry straightened up to open when he remembered he was only wearing a boxer. He put on some jeans and placed the sheet correctly on the blonde who had fallen asleep. He then opened and found himself facing a little brunette girl. He then looked down at her and when he saw her gray eyes, he knew who she was.
“Who’s sexy?” Blaise asked as he opened the door of his room.
“We just remembered that the good one was stolen by dad's brother” Alarik said.
“Calm down. He's fine, you've heard it yourself. He's alive” It was not really conclusive, so seeing that the tears were intensifying and Harry was starting to spasm, Draco did the only thing that came to his mind. He pressed his mouth against Harry's, who widened his eyes before kissing him back. They parted and Harry wiped his tears, calmed.
Draco raised his head feeling panic, fear and intense pain coming from Harry. Unfortunately he couldn’t see anything at all, Harry was too far away for him to see. He started slowly up towards Harry's location, followed by Blaise and Theo who asked him what was going on.
“What’s the problem, Malfoy?” The blonde seemed to think for a few moments before opening his mouth.
“The terrors! What are you doing here?” The two boys threw themselves into the taller's arms.
“That can’t be how it happened” Draco finally exclaimed.
“Fine, eat at your dear table and I eat at my own one with my kids.” Draco's face got even harder.
“Because I'm in love with you too” Her eyes widened.
“I hope” Ezekiel added, more to himself. His brothers and sisters glared at him.
But he thought the most shocking must have been to see Draco with one hand in Harry's hair and the other on his ass. The blond suddenly blushed as he realized it and he pulled his hand away. Then finally the twins relaxed and burst out laughing.
“And we all know that Dad finds daddy extremely sexy when he's angry” Erin finished.
Malfoy, the git, chuckled again and Harry hurried in the water as he felt his cock harden. He grabbed the edge of the pool and let himself float a bit. When he turned toward Malfoy, he had moved and was now too close for Harry’s liking.
“we should try to make it explode” Ezekiel suggested. Eleanor hit him with the book she was reading.
“Well, if it's just a stupid table, why don’t you and your noble butt come at MY table?” Malfoy looked shocked for a moment before replying.
“It was the voice of Dimitri or did I dreamed?” Alarik's voice asked a little further down the hall.
“It's Ezekiel, and yes he has the same eyes as Harry”
“It's Dumbledore who placed the spells to hide what's on the other side”
“Because from what I understand, we’re alive because our children have made us sleep together half-naked, which means that your contact keeps me alive. So if I stay with you, at the slightest sign of weakness, I'll just have to touch you so that none of us will faint again” Harry looked surprised and nodded.
“So Dimi” The above-named glared at him.
“What’s the matter, guys?” Harry asked went they arrived. They were all chilling on sofas and some of them were at the tables.
“We’ll teach you” Alya said, shrugging her shoulders and looking right behind Harry’s shoulder. Her brothers both nodded.
“And maybe he won’t reject him” Joris added.
“I think we have a lot to say to each other” Lucius said.
“I just thought it was good to be a normal teenager. For a few minutes I forgot that Voldemort wanted to kill me. And it did me a lot of good” Draco made no answer but Harry knew he understood perfectly, being in a similar position since he refused to receive the mark. As he thought about it, Harry understood why Draco looked different this year. He no longer had to hide behind a mask to satisfy his father. Then Harry realized a second thing. Draco had refused the mark before knowing the children, which meant that he had chosen the side of the good, his own side. Maybe it was imagining that he had chosen the side of the good because it was his camp but he decided not to worry. The breeze rose and passed over their two bodies still wet. They shuddered.
“What do you mean?” Harry shrugged.
“You could not block us, we are the triplets of the most powerful pair of Soulmates that ever existed” Alya explained casually. Draco and Harry could clearly see Dumbledore's eyes sparkling as Lyra smiled as she rolled her eyes, those three boasted all the time.
“What are you waiting for?” Draco panted. “Fuck me. Now!”
“That's not stupid, I'll ask Hermione for more explanations” Pansy just nodded.
“And ... How ... uh ... how exactly are you born?” Harry asked, blushing. Erin laughed slightly in front of his embarrassment. Lyra cleared her throat, preparing for a long speech.
“We’re making you beautiful” Pansy replied simply. He looked at himself in the mirror when they had finished. He had pretty black jeans on and a green shirt that made his eyes stand out. His hair was pretty much his hair, Emett came to help with that part, and Harry found himself particularly sexy dressed like that.
He smiled sadly at Harry because he had to push him away. Even if drunk Harry was adorable with his big, shiny eyes and soft smile.
“Are you OK?” Draco asked. Harry nodded slowly and tried to get up. Draco had to support him so that he didn’t collapse. The two boys opened their eyes wide as they saw the others go to clear debris from Emett, Skott, Isaak, Jackson and Jasper.
“What?” Draco moved away to look Harry in the eyes.
"At least eleven O’clock” Theo replied.
“This plan can wait a few hours, Draco. Especially since we're not going to put that plan together and nobody's in the apartment yet” Harry retorted. The blond offer him a pout before taking his mouth. He quickly straightened up and lifted Harry up to lead them into the room.
“Obviously” Draco made a smile that didn’t please Harry at all. He knew he was right when he saw Dumbledore dancing in a really transparent nightdress. Harry took a disgusted look.
“Oh, Emett was happy when he saw him?”
“What is happening? You're hurt?” She asked quickly.
“Wait, Potter” Draco retorted.
"It was a joke and you know it very well." Harry put himself in the same position as the blond and he could read in his eyes all the sincerity he felt. He calmed down instantly and Draco could feel it and sat down with a small smirk. Blaise cleared his throat.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked.
“Children, you're all up there!” She cried, pointing to the stairs with her hand. “And we're looking for Harry and maybe other people” Pansy, Ginny, Ron, Blaise, Theo and Hermione rushed to search. Draco got up with a grimace. He followed his instinct and walked in a random direction, then he jumped when he saw a hand on the ground. He knelt down close to the body and removed the woody debris from Harry's back, since it was him. Draco cursed himself when he saw that his hands were shaking. He slowly turned his companion's body and sighed slightly, seeing only a few scratches. He put his hands on Harry's face and immediately, the pain he felt disappeared and Harry's eyes opened with difficulty. He coughed and moaned softly.
“My daddy” The child replied, looking at Hermione like she was stupid.
“Hold on! They are also two super sexy blondes!” George continued.
He watched the scene, trying to understand why he had been so drowsy so soon. He saw Lyra and Nathaniel glaring at each other as Jordan was lying on the bed, taking advantage of the silence to try and get back to sleep. Joris then stepped towards them, grabbed the blonde by the waist and lifted her off the ground. He passed her over his shoulder like a bag of potato and came out of the room as quickly as he had arrived, determined to go back to sleep.
“Look at Emett, he has Harry's hair and his eyes too” Ron looked more closely at Emett and admitted that indeed he looked exactly like Harry. His eyes were exactly the same, it was almost scary.
“Do you think she understood something and went to see Dumbledore again?” Ron asked Harry.
“I was wondering something, sir”
“You’re Nathaniel's sister, aren’t you?” He saw the green eyes of the girl twinkle.
“What has happened to you ?” He asked eagerly, beginning to look for any wound on his boyfriend's body.
However, Harry fainted again and Draco barely had time to catch him. He lifted him off the floor bridal-style and ran up the stairs. He entered his children's room through the open door.
He started a long slow pace back and forth and the Slytherin was almost screaming. Harry's erection started to hurt him but he didn’t care. He suddenly accelerated. Harry looked up at the blonde and what he saw almost made him come in an instant. Draco's eyes were mostly closed and fogged with pleasure, his mouth was open, his cheeks rosy with desire and pleasure. As Harry continued, the Slytherin tried to make him go away, meaning that he would soon come.
“Let's go eat” He said, getting up. The eight children followed him to the living room. Hermione ran to them, followed by Theo, who seemed to take a certain pleasure in being with the pretty brunette.
“Oh come on! Don’t be so embarrassed” Joris finally said. His sister looked at him exasperatedly.
“How do you not know?” Harry asked her.
“Thank you” He murmured. Draco smiled at him.
“I put your father pregnant while we were in the middle of the war?” He exclaimed.
“You catch my daughter and me Harry” He said hastily to his two friends before rushing at full speed to the brown. The impact was anything but delicate. Draco gasped as he hit Harry, but he held on tight and wrapped his arms around him to hold him on the broom. He descended to a suitable height and pushed the Gryffindor away from him. The brown man wrapped his arms around Draco and hugged him tightly. Draco could hear screams of misunderstanding in the crowd, wondering why Harry had not come down on his broom right now screaming at him that no one had asked him to save him.
“Are you mad Weasley, screaming like that!” It only served to annoy the redhead even more.
“But by the way, why are you all here?” Ezekiel asked.
“I didn’t want to imagine that!” He was angry with himself. They all burst out laughing and it was this moment that the adults chose to go home.
“I was just wondering how long we had to stay so that they have enough to tell Molly when she come home without her suspecting we were gone all night”
“It's not because my brother is rejecting you that you have to scream at us, mate” Ezekiel joked. Dimitri's jaw tightened and Ezekiel immediately knew he was going too far. “Before you scream that he’s not rejecting you, know that it’s the truth. He doesn’t reject you, he even told us that he thought he was in love with you, Dimi” the latter widened his eyes.
“You say that all the fucking time!” She exclaimed. Blaise giggled as Draco looked furious.
“Are you sure you didn’t want to say that you watched him passionately every minute that passes?” Ezekiel teased from his bed. Lyra then checked if Lesath and Emett were sleeping and she pulled out all the others to keep it like that. Dimitri groaned as the twins literally laughed at him.
“I promise you” He kissed him one last time, longer. He turned away then and he left the room with a quick step.
“I'm sorry Rik” He gave her a smile and took her in his arms and walked away. Harry and Draco were still in a state of deep shock.
“I'm going to go get Jordan” Ezekiel slipped out of the room and ran down the stairs. He smiled tenderly as he saw that his brother had slipped under the table and was playing with Jordan's brown locks. He seemed to be slowly emerging from his heavy sleep.
“Well, my observations about you” They all gave her bored looks, waiting for more explanations from her.
“We heard there was a war council here, and we want to participate” Hermione said.
“Why did it only happen now?” Draco asked.
“What the fuck was that?” Jordan asked, panting.
“Yes! It was really funny” Joris laughed.
“I have the honor to announce that you are pregnant, Draco”
“Wait, let me summarize” Draco started, lying on one of the living room couch, Harry astride him. “We need to get a necklace from around Umbridge’s neck which is actually a horcrux to destroy you-know-who”
“Wait, did you hear me? I said it out loud?"
“Oh, shut up will you” Draco growled, letting himself fall back to Harry, thrusting his head into the mattress. Harry swiveled to the side and the blond laid on his back. The Gryffindor could then place his head on Draco's shoulder and they fell asleep for the night, or at least what was left of it.
“Oh hello dad, don’t you have mistletoe somewhere?”
“I bet it's because we're soulmates” Harry said, a particularly silly smile on his face.
“Dimitri” He introduced himself.
“Well, now that you're reassured, I'm going to ask you to get out” The nurse told Lucius and Narcissa. They reluctantly left the room. It was this moment that Draco chose to open his eyes. Harry gave him a relieved smile as he finally saw it.
“In fact, Alya’s here too” Lena indicated, nodding towards the door behind them. Draco and his two sons turned in a perfect synchronization towards the door and saw a blond girl with gray eyes. Her hair was cut short and Draco felt a surge of pride and happiness in telling himself that this beautiful girl was his.
He understood her surprise, he always loved going to Hogwarts as a child, making his trunk weeks before he had to go. This time was different but he really couldn’t tell her why. He just couldn’t tell about this ridiculous little crush he had on Potter.
“We are in your new common room”
Malfoy chuckled -really chuckled- before turning his back to Harry and going deeper in the water.
“My name's Jackson” Draco ticked at the boy's name.
“Oh ! You mean in the evening-” The brunet had Erin cut him off.
“So, you say that Dad takes it badly?”
“Not at all! Everyone knows it's Erin” Alarik shouted. The people concerned looked at each other with dismayed glances. Zachady got up and punched the table.
“Hmm... Yeah, not really, sorry” He apologized under the cold glare his sister gave him. Zephir burst out laughing.
End flashback
“I know what you're going to say, you're going to say that our daughter and Hermione and Theo's were kidnapped and we can’t think about that right now, but they're fine Harry. And to be honest, my hormones have been boiling for almost a month and I really want you” Harry blushed unconsciously and he could do nothing but moan as Draco nibbled the lobe of his ear.
“And where are we going to find basilisk venom?” Draco asked with a sneer.
Harry let out a small “How” before he could stop himself.
“I told you! He knows it, he realizes it” Harry raised an inquiring eyebrow.
“Uncle Sev!” Draco smiled and grabbed Harry's hand. He pulled hard and Draco was found against him, their hands between their torsos. The brown man's gaze suddenly became serious.
They didn’t respond to the redhead, just hoping he would leave.
“Of course yes”
“All right, so you didn’t explain everything, but we know a good part of it” Harry nodded while the blond behind him was playing with his hair.
“I don’t know, I don’t even know if I'm in love with him. It’s just in case I really am” Ezekiel pinched his nose between two of his fingers and blew.
“A lemon candy?” The old wizard suggested. Harry refused politely.
“Have you been here doing nothing for the last two hours?” She asked, crossing her arms over her chest just like she did every time she was about to lecture him.
“Where are we sleeping?” Emett asked, startling them. Nobody had heard him coming, he was getting it from their father.
“Great idea” Alarik replied, running in with Joris. Erin turned to them and welcomed the kiss that Alarik placed on her lips. They then returned to the apartments, going to stand before the door of the room.
Eleanor and Hermione had the idea to gather several tables in the living room to be able to receive Sirius and Remus. Harry watched them all arrange the room from the top of the stairs. Then he felt Draco's arms slipped around him. He turned to face him and kissed him softly.
“Oh, thank Merlin” Draco sighed when Harry opened the door.
“What the fuck are you doing?” Zachady started as he closed the door so as not to wake the two sleeping girls inside.
“What we know is their first names and that some of them look like you, Harry. But we don’t know the rest”
“Yo, Luce!” Everything’s fine?” Dimitri asked as he passed Lucius. Harry thought all the people's eyes in the hall were wide. Harry removed the dishes that were in front of Lucius, Narcissa, Sirius, Remus and Severus to sit on the table.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy! You are finally awake!” Exclaimed the nurse.
“I understand better” He laughed. Harry stood up and opened the door before Draco could hurt the poor Dimitri. The latter didn’t seem impressed. Harry grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him inside the room.
“What's the habit of having children two by two? Look, we did three at once and then we all got them one by one” Draco said. All the children winced at hearing that.
“Hold on, hold on” Nath whispered as he stared at the wound under their hands. Once it was mostly closed, he lifted their hands and Jordan stopped screaming.
“You were fighting, I panicked” Joris said back, his voice shaking a bit. A few tears fell from her eyes and Harry took a step toward her to comfort her but Joris was on his knees in front of her instantly. He then wrapped his arms around her.
“Yes” Draco answered.
“We need to get out of here” Harry said as the three of them looked at the door. Jordan looked about to faint and really not able to run. “You apparate in the chamber of secrets and you stay there” He told Nath before running away to where Alya and Ezekiel were still fighting with the tall guy.
“What's wrong?” The blonde finally asked after filling the tub with water. Harry sighed and dropped his head forward, resting his forehead against Draco's shoulder. A few tears escaped him and his voice trembled slightly when he finally explained himself.
No matter, the facts were there: he loved Draco. And above all, he was going to have to hide that. He jumped out of bed when he heard Draco trying to force the door once more. The door opened on its own as Harry approached and he found himself facing the blonde.
Harry’s only response was to put his arms around Draco’s neck and to press himself against him. He was definitely drunk.
“No, I have already my own room” Draco answered as he sat up and looked across the room looking for his clothes. Harry looked at his arse when he got up but he doesn’t see it.
“Well, I sure do hope he is” He answered before entering under the four twins laughter. Draco was lying on one of the bed, staring at the ceiling. One of his hand was on his belly, where one of their kids was. He turned his head toward Harry when he heard the door. He looked guilty, like he knew he’d made a mistake and didn’t knew how to be forgiven.
“So what happened tonight?” She finally asked. Draco sat on the bed too and began to talk.
“We'll see” And with these words he climbed the stairs two by two. He stopped at the top of the stairs and looked in what room could be that red-haired girl. He sneered, thinking that she must not have been smart enough to hide outside of her room. He walked to the door where Weasley-Parkinson was written. The door opened on its own when he arrived. He entered and he saw Lena curled up in one of the corners of the room. He rolled his eyes. Not even able to hide, he thought. He leaned against the door he had closed and stared at the girl in front of him.
“For the keeper?” Lyra asked.
“We...wandered in a blanket” Draco sighed exasperatedly.
“Do we have to go there?” Emett asked, not quite at their level. They all looked at each other.
“Potter?” Malfoy whispered. Harry kept silent, though wondering how the hell Malfoy could know it was him. “Come on, show yourself, I know it’s you”
The latter sat up and looked at Harry. His eyes were closed, his cheeks were red, and he was panting. Draco smiled tenderly and came to kiss Harry. The latter hugged Draco in his arms a few moments before reversing their positions again. He then came to nibble the earlobe of the blonde who began to moan. He lowered his hand down Draco's body, once again taking possession of the blonde's attractive lips. He then took the virility of the blond in hand and began to jerk it gently. The blonde began to moan loudly under this caress. Harry accelerated the pace as he slowly directed his second hand toward the blond's intimacy.
“Following these strange events, which, by chance, brings together the Gryffindor and Slytherin houses, I decided it would be easier to get to know each other if we all lived together” They all stared at him with wide eyes and he smiled amusedly before coming out of the room, leaving them in utter misunderstanding.
“I don’t love you, Malfoy” Potter whispered before he pulled his clothes off. Draco nodded, his Adam’s apple bobbing, and cursed himself for being so weak. He should have stopped this unhealthy relationship months ago. It wasn’t even a relationship. It was just some fucking sex meeting. He noticed the other man watching at him, waiting for an answer at the silent question.
“You bet your ass we are, that way I can show you how much more beautiful you are without all that” He said in a deep voice as he ran his hands over Harry's chest. Harry shivered and walked away a few steps.
“So are you stepping out of that cloak or do I need to tell you how I knew you were here again?” Malfoy drawled after a few seconds of uncomfortable silence. Harry sighed before letting the cloak fall to the ground. “Here you are”
“What?” Harry asked him. Draco straightened hardly, until he found himself in front of Harry. The brown man found his half-asleep face truly adorable. The blond glared at him.
“Well, then, me, Zach, Dimi and the five terrors control the amount of alcohol ingested by each parent” Ezekiel continued.
“Firstly, because seeing you kissing my brother, well, what am I saying, seeing you devour his face, when I open my eyes is not what I call a good awakening! And I was scared because you're not supposed to be there” The door opened at that moment, letting in Dimitri.
“Are you ready for the hard time Molly is going to give us?” Remus asked, helping the three shaking boys to get up. They all laughed, not afraid of having to face the redhead, except perhaps Ron as it was his mother. The four adults had them apparated directly inside the house, in the kitchen as it was time for dinner.
“Stay” Harry asked, holding him by the wrist. Draco frowned. Why would Harry want him to stay?
“Oh my god” He said in an attempt to keep thinking straight.
“Let's summarize, you saved me from a deadly fall, you hugged me, you saved me again from a more than deadly wound, you cried and panicked when you saw all that blood and you have been hugging me for a long time so I don’t  think our relationship is a real secret right now, why?” Draco smirked, clinging to the brunette.
“It's your children too, I'll let you know, and if you think carrying our kids is damaging your body that’s because you don’t like them and me either” Harry almost shouted. Draco looked at him with a slightly jaded look. He got up and rested his hands on the table. He stared into Harry's eyes.
“Who knows about them?” Dimitri asked, whispering.
“Elé, Lyra and I are taking care of the room” Erin said.
He saw a lightning breaking the sky and for a moment he thought it might not be the best idea he had to pursue the snitch. He said to himself that it had not been a good idea when a lightning flash hit his broom. The broom literally broke into pieces and Harry had the uncomfortable sensation of feeling a thick piece of the broom sinking into his belly. He screamed in pain and fear as he felt himself fall back at a bewildering speed.
“We don’t need anyone to understand since you've already guessed everything, aren’t you?” Hermione looked up at him and nodded slowly.
He could barely think, pleasure was flooding all his senses. Leaving only the feeling of the hard cock deep in his ass. To be honest, that was the only thing he wanted to feel. He screamed when the boy behind him reached around and grabbed his cock. He wouldn’t last very long if Potter kept going.
“Shhhh, don’t talk” Jordan laughed at him as he raised a hand in Nathaniel hair.
“I discovered that a few days ago, when you went to sleep before me”
End Flashback
“I-I have it” Harry pronounced hardly, opening his hand, revealing Salazar Slytherin's locket. Draco almost tore it from his hands and sent it away.
“Soul Mates” Harry explained. They widened their eyes and from what Harry saw, they continued talking with Draco.
In that same room, Harry had locked himself on the parents’ side of the room while Draco was stuck on the kids' side and was trying to get in anyway. The brunet was in panic, how could it have happened? Huh? How could he fall in love with Draco? Harry could not deny that Draco was physically attractive, not in fact he was frightfully attractive in the devilish angel genre. But the worst was that without his mask of ice and contempt, this little cunt was horribly cute and kind. Yeah, he was just adorable and shy.
“It wasn’t Hermione” Dimitri rectified, stuffing a handful of cereals into his mouth, his feet on the table.
“Are you girls ready with your part of the plan?” Ezekiel asked.
“Oh really?” Draco took it as a challenge and tried to catch Harry. The latter dodged him and Draco found himself once again under water. He grabbed Harry's ankles and made him fall.
“Oh yes…” He moaned. He felt Harry on his back as the boy heavily laid his chest onto him. The boy’s hot breath on his neck was enough to do him in. He pushed his hips back in time with Harry’s thrusts, leaving Harry moaning in his ear.
“I'm Zephir and yes, my eyes color is natural” Harry's eyes widened for two reasons. Because he had already heard that name and so he knew that boy was his son. And then, how on earth could this boy have known what he might have thought.
“It's really beautiful, thank you” He murmured as he passed the chain around his neck. Harry smiled widely and returned to take possession of Draco's lips in a passionate kiss. The blonde moved away from Harry.
“My name is Nathaniel” The blond began “And he's Jordan” He finished, pointing to his friend. Hermione nodded and seemed to think of something that no one else could think of. When she returned to her, the four boys were waiting patiently for her to come out of her thoughts. She gave them a small smile, especially to the brunette one that reminded her of someone, but she didn’t remember who.
“Remus?”
“I'm going to count to three, and if at that moment you didn’t speak, I’ll hit you against that wall until you die, understand?” Of course, Ezekiel didn’t wait for an answer.
“In our room maybe?” Harry offered.
“I missed you”  He grinned as he ruffled their hair. The three blondes pushed his hand back as best they could. Harry saw that Lucius was going to intervene again so he cut him off.
“Why didn’t you came back from the interview with Dumbledore? And why did Granger have that blond kid in his arms? And why…”
“How do we undo these spells and see what's on the other side?”
“Well, what are we doing now?” Ezekiel asked boredly, sitting on one of the tables. He received no answer. Eleanor sat down next to him and put her hand on his thigh. A chuckle made him turn his head. He saw Jordan and Nathaniel on one of the sofas, kissing each other. Jordan was obviously pushing the blonde to lie down.
“Just wish it ardently, keeping your hands on him” the newcomer advised him. Nathaniel put Harry's head on his lap and he finally stopped choking on his own blood.
“Shut the hell up Potter, I'm not worried.” His look and tone were really threatening and when Harry wanted to take a breath to answer him, he almost choked. Malfoy pulled his arm out of Harry's throat.
“You’re looking for Zeph, aren’t you?” She then asked Harry. He nodded and she went to find him.
"Why?” Malfoy chuckled before continuing.
“Well, good enough I must say”
“What do mean, you don’t know?” Draco roared.
“Did I do something wrong?” Harry laughed through his tears and straightened up on his lap to kiss Draco. Draco wrapped his arms around his waist and dropped against the incredibly soft mattress under the weight of the brunette falling against him. Harry sat astride him and began to kiss his neck and collarbone. Draco let out a groan as the gryffindor gently bit the thin skin of his collarbone.
Harry tried to laugh at the blonde’s demands but it was caught off by a moan when Draco opened his legs wide for the Gryffindor, his legs brushing Harry’s sides. He felt the muscles of Harry’s abdomen roll against his inner thighs and ran his hands up his back lovingly, maybe too lovingly.
“DINNER!” Molly yelled from the ground floor. The twins disappeared immediately and the door opposite opened. Blaise shot an amused smile at the half-naked men on the bed.
“Wait, he's going to attack the castle!?” Harry exclaimed. The eight children gave him a meaningful look. He moaned and let his head fall against Draco's shoulder.
“Gorgeous?” Draco offered.
Then suddenly a soft golden light escaped the palms of his hands in waves. Slowly, he could see the wound close up while Jordan had finally arrived and was doing his best to comfort his boyfriend who was not as confident as a few moments ago. Ezekiel seemed bored even though the glimmer of worry in his eyes escaped no one.
“Look, we're going to have to live with each other for a while, so I thought we could make peace, somehow.” He finally let go of the blonde's wrist and held out his hand. They looked into each other's eyes, both remembering a similar scene five years earlier. Malfoy's lips stretched into an ironic smirk, then he sneered.
Then all the adults in the house made their appearances in the kitchen. Arthur and Tonks stared up at the sight as those in the audience gave them bored looks and Narcissa offered them a tender smile. The two boys blushed rather violently and literally fled from the room, taking refuge in the three Slytherin’s room.
“So, I heard you were in love with me” He tried to joke. The brunette blushed even more. “And I think it's really great, actually” She looked up at him as she heard those words and she frowned, not seeing what he wanted to say.
“Why are you still wasting time looking at us that way instead of looking for him?” Blaise suggested. She looked meanly at them for a few more seconds and then slammed the door shut. The four boys burst out laughing as they imagined the woman looking for Harry while he was in this room.
Severus entered first, followed by Sirius. Severus stopped in front of Dimitri, on the other side of the table. He snatched the pack of cereals from his hands and left like a fury. Sirius threw a new packet of those same cereals at his son with a wink before following the pissed potions master. Molly came next and looked oddly at Draco and Hermione, still red, and Ron, who was still pale. She shrugged and walked down the table until she was near Jordan, who was sleeping, lying under the table.
“I can’t believe it” He said. She didn’t really know how it happened. The night they had learned that they had children together, Theo and her had just discussed a lot. They had discovered they had things in common, including literature, but also that they liked to watch the stars when they couldn’t sleep and that they liked to talk for hours together each in their bed until one of them falls asleep. They had researched together for Harry and it had brought them closer. She couldn’t tell if she was in love with Theo but she was close to it. Ron had apparently screamed but she had not paid attention, too lost in thought.
“Jackson and Jasper are here too” Alarik informed.
“What are...” Draco started but he couldn’t finish his sentence, uttering a really loud groan when Harry licked his cock all the way. The brown repeated his gesture several times, tearing groans from the blonde. He placed his hands on the Slytherin’s hips who began to stir. Then, without warning, he engulfed Draco’s erection at once, tearing a cry to Draco. He wrapped his tongue around the sex in his mouth while Draco gripped his hair with one hand and the sheet with the other.
“They're emptying their magic pool” Erin replied.
“What? Why are you doing this face?” Harry asked, not very reassured.
“I have one too” Harry went to sit cross-legged on the bed and Draco sat down in front of him.
Zephir was sitting at a table with Zach, Emerik and Ethan, doing his homework but Dimitri was sitting in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassing Zephir. The five boys were laughing at another table and the little one were playing on the floor with Ascella in a corner of the room. Alya, Blaise, Ron, Hermione and Theo were all chatting at a table and they looked up when Harry spoke.
“What are you talking about?” Harry laughed, but he stopped when he saw the blonde's serious look, and he put his hands under Draco's sweater and hugged him.
“He can read minds” Nathaniel explained. Harry was simply stunned, but he still grabbed the hand his son held out to him.
“Until we tell Grandma that daddy and I love each other, you'll have to stay with him when she's with us, okay?” The boy's eyes watered immediately.
“How do you know all this?” Harry asked, squinting, suspiciously. Mal-Draco laughed slightly at Harry's mistrust.
“Okay” So they went to sit down, Harry took his place again and the blonde settled between him and Ginny. Harry resumed his breakfast in silence, having uttered far too much word for the moment to his liking. Malfoy, meanwhile, took a simple crescent that he pecked slowly watching Emett carefully, sitting in front of him. His three friends had finally joined, Pansy had sat next to him and Blaise and Theo were in front of him. Nobody spoke, too immersed in their incoherent thoughts. Finally, the ringing sounded, announcing the first classes of the day. Dumbledore announced that the children would attend their normal classes, thus finding themselves in the same class as their parents if they were in the same house and the same year. This only happened for Draco and Lyra. Dumbledore charged some elves with watching the little ones. So they all got up and went to their classrooms. Harry and the rest of the Gryffindors had history of magic for the next four hours. He settled next to Hermione. Harry started to have a headache only thirty minutes after the start of the class. Vertigo added to this an hour later.
“Himself” They both threw themselves in his arms, delighted to see him again.
“I'm hungry” Harry complained suddenly.
“The last time we did that Harry almost died so no thanks” Draco retorted.
“Madame Pompfresh told us that your loss of consciousness was due to Voldemort” He continued. Harry nodded again.
“I want to go to Dad too” Seth said in turn.
“Listen, I'm sorry...” He began before being cut off by the image Harry sent him. In this mental picture, they were both exactly where they were now, except that they were much closer and passionately kissing each other. After seeing that, Draco looked at Harry questioningly. So Harry followed his instinct. He approached the blonde, placed his hand in the blonde's neck and pressed his lips on his as the storm raged outside and the wind and rain were falling on them.
“Dad wants us to help him make our other daddy fall in love with him” Jasper explained, sitting on the same shelf as his brother.
“Daddy wants to eat with everyone but dad doesn’t want to wait, so they scream at each other” He told them, his eyes glistening with tears.
“Our next kill may not be relevant anymore” Draco said.
Draco reached out unconsciously to wipe them away.
“Because we’re not getting rejected” Ezekiel laughed.
“No, whoever you want” Harry and Draco then hurriedly woke Ron, Blaise and Theo.
“How? And why are your eyes so blue?” Zephir laughed, laughing deep and serious.
“Seventeen years” Erin replied. Harry suddenly widened his eyes.
“We cannot tell you” The blonde, Nathaniel, said. Hermione gave him a slight smile, as if to say ‘It doesn’t matter’. A soothing silence settled between them and Ron leaned against the couch. The silence lingered for a moment, then Hermione broke it.
“Why do you want us to go together Malfoy?”
“I didn’t talk to you, Weasley, I don’t talk to the traitor” Malfoy answered. Ron looked upset and Malfoy sat between Harry and Ginny, pushing the redhead unceremoniously. They all gave him surprised looks, not understanding why Draco Malfoy was sitting at their table. They remained silent before Malfoy decided to explain himself.
“Hi, I’m-”
“Without being indiscreet, where are you from?” The two boys stared at each other behind Ron's back, seeming to have a new conversation at a glance.
Malfoy threw his robes on the floor, not far from Harry. He was only in his boxers and Harry felt stupid. Who in their right mind followed someone in a fucking bathroom?
“Do you mean how do I do that?” Harry asked, revealing a black-colored ball of magic with red highlights in the palm of his hand. Draco looked fascinated as well as everyone else.
“Thank you” He said, raising his chin. Harry shook his head, amused.
Zachady had a moment of panic when he saw that his uncle Harry had disappeared from the room but was reassured when he saw him reappear a good half hour later, a smile stretching his lips. As expected, the children watched over their parents and while Pansy and Ginny laughed at the slightest opportunity because of their drunken state, the other six were still quite sober.
The next day was only preparation. Hermione, Ginny and Pansy literally kidnapped Harry about an hour before the official start of their party.
“I did that because of Ezekiel” She whispered.
She stood up and took a quick step towards the exit of the common room, glad that Dumbledore finally wanted to say more. The five others get up and left in silence. When they arrived in front of the Headmaster’s office, Harry saw Malfoy, who was having a conversation with Zabini. The blonde suddenly burst into a straightforward laugh that caught Harry's attention as he stared at the face of his not-so-enemy. He did not hear Ron bitching against the two Slytherins. Malfoy looked up while laughing and his eyes fell into Harry's. Harry was very surprised that the blond doesn’t replace his ice mask immediately, but continued to smile with all his teeth. His smile slowly diminished but did not disappear completely and strangely, both of them were unable to break the eye contact. At least until the gargoyle turned on itself and they all turned their eyes in its direction. It was Hermione who decided to move first and everyone else followed his movement. Dumbledore opened the door to them with a wand motion and welcomed them into his office where the rest of the children that no one knew were waiting. The director had to make appear additional seats so that its sixteen guests could settle down. They all sat down and stared at Dumbledore, waiting for his explanations. The Headmaster went to sit behind his desk and the position didn’t suit him, so he got up and rounded his desk to lean against it.
“Aren’t you going to put off your boxers?” Malfoy asked with a smirk.
“Come back alive, okay?” Lyra recommended. Harry laughed slightly.
He felt mortified. His mother really didn’t need to know about his ridiculous attraction to Potter.
“He is not, don’t worry” Harry looked up at him with tears in his eyes.
“No, don’t worry” Alarik replied. The Potionist's eyes nearly came out of his skull and he tried to chase the four boys away. They agreed to go out once the older found what he was looking for.
“Wait, are you saying that you betrayed the Lord?” Draco asked. Lucius nodded.
“You could ask him when we see him, what do you say?” Erin suggested with a smirk. The little boy had a big smile then went back to play, always taking the other boy with him.
“We all play there” Erin replied.
“Let me explain and you'll see it's just a misunderstanding” The brunette looked offended.
“Why Zephir doesn’t want to be in love with you?” Dimitri sighed then.
Potter bites his ear lobe, huffin hot breaths against the blonde’s neck and Draco groaned in pleasure. Harry slowly slid his hands against the beautiful body under him and caressed the amazing pale skin.
“Nott?” Hermione asked him. He nodded.
When Harry woke up again, everything was clearer in his head. He had fainted for a reason he didn’t know, he had woken up in bed with Draco Malfoy for a reason he didn’t know. No, in fact nothing was clear, everything was confused, he didn’t understand a single thing. He didn’t really understand how such a situation had happened. He didn’t understand how he could have been lying on his back in bed with Malfoy lying on him. And especially he didn’t understand why his arms were wrapped around the blonde as if he was afraid he would leave and even worse, why did he like that? And why didn’t he want to leave?
“How was it possible to apparate without leaving the castle?” He asked when he felt better.
“Just us?” Harry asked. Sirius shrugged.
“Where do you wanna go?” The blonde asked suspiciously.
“Can you go get me Zephir please?” He asked, beating his lashes excessively. Dimitri rolled his eyes and went to upstairs. When he disappeared at the top of the stairs, a shout sounded in the direction of the library. Absolutely everyone in the room raised their heads. Harry rose from his chair and slowly approached the library.
“The wall ejected him” Blaise answered, staring at the wall, frowning. Draco helped Harry to stand up when Hermione jumped up the last steps of the stairs, a big smile on her face.
“Were not you supposed to put protection spells on those doors, Severus?”
“Don’t tell me it's going to be that way here too” She whispered.
“Let's summarize the plan my friends!” Ezekiel exclaimed Ezekiel.
"I feel all your tiredness, Harry, you should sleep" The brown man didn’t protest, he moved closer to Draco and put his head on his shoulder, closing his eyes.
Harry arrived on the second floor just in time to see Joris smash Lena on the head with his book. She fell on the floor, unconscious. He then turned to Lyra, who was on the floor. One of her lip was cut and bloody, her hair was in a mess and she was out of breath. She looked at Joris with wide eyes, a bit watery.
“Oh yeah let's see grandpa and grandma!” Nathaniel exclaimed. Soon the whole Malfoy-Potter family wanted to go there, so Harry granted permission only if he and Draco accompanied them. They went to the teachers' table, accompanied by Dimitri, Alarik, Erika and Seth.
“Me, Erin, Emett and Jordan are in Gryffindor. Lyra, Ezekiel, Zach, Joris and Alarik are Slytherin” Nathaniel replied. Harry nodded with a smile, proud that a majority of his children were Gryffindor.
Dumbledore and the other teachers had left the infirmary almost immediately, probably going to talk in the headmaster's office. Harry was then able to leave the infirmary as long as he rested. Dumbledore had made Ezekiel promise to tell no one what he knew about the horcruxes at the moment, but of course it wasn’t a real promise.
“But you will not let him do it?”
“You... you... you are...” He stammered.
“Everything’s okay?” Harry asked, gasping for air. Draco sighed with relief.
“Oh come on! Tell us how you’re going to make Zephir fall into your arms” Dimitri blushed slightly.
“No, it's Jackson who loves Emett” One of the twins rectified.
“You were afraid that I raped you or what?” Harry almost choked on those words, but he recovered quickly, not forgetting that he was talking to Malfoy.
“So I learned that some things will develop. For example, your powers”
“It's our magic that protects us because when we're together, our powers are more powerful so our magic changes our appearances so that nobody knows we're triplets” Alya explained. Draco and the others were amazed by this ability. Draco then pulled Harry up in his arms and he went upstairs to their room. He put Harry in one of the beds and sat down next to him, biting his nails. At the end of what seemed like an eternity, Harry finally opened his eyes.
“Your godson looks really in love with mine” Sirius said to Severus. The latter and Lucius sighed.
“Again, you bitch, seriously?” A voice yelled. Harry recognized it as Lyra’s. “You think you can kidnap me a second time? You just had me the first time because I was sleeping when you attacked, you stupid fool” Joris was on his feet in two seconds, he grabbed a book in one of the stash and he rushed to the second floor. Harry and Draco ran just behind him.
“Is that Dimi?” Jordan asked, hidden by the tall build of his brother.
“Wait, I want to give you your gift before” Draco nodded and walked out of the room under the astonished eyes of Harry. He came back almost instantly holding a rectangular box in one of his hands.
“Harry? Everything is fine?” Harry looked up at Hermione and she could see he was strangely pale. He put his head in his arms and she let him rest for the next two hours. Harry winced when the bell ringed, making his head hurt. He stood up slowly, his legs shaking, and headed for the exit, accompanied by Ron and Hermione. The more minutes passed, the weaker he felt. He felt he was going to fall but two pairs of arms held him back. He looked at both faces and felt a wave of relief when he recognized Nathaniel and Ezekiel.
“Harry, mate, if you win, I swear I'll give you my gratitude and my eternal friendship” Ron added with a laugh.
“Harry? Are you going to end up with Malfoy?” The two adults in the room suddenly asked.
“Of course I want to, stupid” Harry offered him a big, beautiful smile. Draco pulled his sweater and pants off under Harry's greedy eyes. It was a blushing Draco that slipped under the covers. Harry chuckled as he swung sideways, facing the blond. He closed his eyes and put a hand on the pale hip, his thumb caressing the stomach still flat. He fell asleep even before realizing it.
“What!?” Asked the triplets with one voice, aggressively.
So, here's the second chapter. I apologize if there's any mistakes left since English isn't my mother language and I don't have a Beta.
“So, you're telling me that you want to be helped to make Uncle Ron fall in love with you so that if one day you fall in love with him, he falls right into your arms”
“Mr. Malfoy” The headmaster greeted with a smile. Draco replied with a brief movement of his head. The blonde felt that Harry was awake thanks to their bond, so he turned his head towards the brunette until he opened his eyes. The latter did not delay in doing so and he smiled when he saw Draco. He turned his gaze to the six adults and frowned.
“But where are you going to sleep Hermione?” Harry asked.
“Now that we know that” Hermione began.
“Aren’t you going to shut up?” Harry retorted. He wasn’t going to take a bath naked with Malfoy of all people.
“We can sit here and discuss anything you want, if you want?” Lyra offered him. He nodded and as the three boys who were not part of the family were leaving, he told them to stay. They closed the door behind them and settled down on the floor.
“Lesath no! Come back here.” He got up too and followed the kid with a quick step.
“They are not adorable” He rectified.
“You don’t want to go back to Hogwarts?” She wondered, sounding a bit surprised.
“Are you worried, Malfoy?” Harry was laughing completely now. Malfoy quickly turned to face him, their faces being a few millimeters apart. His cheeks were red with anger and embarrassment, and he glared at Harry. Harry stopped laughing immediately but kept an arrogant smile on his face. The blonde pushed him, not too violently, inside their room and he closed the door behind them. He then slammed Harry against the door, placing his arm against his throat.
“It's more up to you to tell me” Draco pulled his hand up against the skin of Harry's neck and sighed in relief, feeling the pain subsidy.
“Well, you’ve all understood!” Dimitri exclaimed, hitting Harry's shoulder lightly, The latter was frozen, completely terrified. A hand brought him back to reality
“What's going on here, by merlin?” Draco exclaimed when he saw Alya holding Lena against the wall. She twisted her arms behind her back.
“You see?” Harry sat up, Draco still on him.
“Is everything fine?” He asked.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked in what he hoped was his coldest tone.
“Is not this Voldemort's HQ?” He asked. Lucius replied that the Lord had never had the opportunity to settle there since Lucius had somehow refused to become a Death Eater again. He had also expressed concern that Voldemort might look for them here, or that he might see them fly. Lucius had hurried away all his sources of anxiety, assuring him that Voldemort would never have the idea of looking for them here. Harry had forgotten all that and was quick to grab his new broom and jump up to the sky. A panicked Draco had followed him quickly, the blond was visibly traumatized by the incident that had occurred at Hogwarts.
“What are you doing?” He asked in a whisper.
“What did you do to my sister?” The blond man asked in a particularly threatening voice. The girl was speechless but Harry could see her tremble in fear from where he was. He grabbed her by the collar of her dress and slammed her against the wall without any delicacy. Ezekiel rushed in, as angry as Joris if not more. His still-black hair and pale skin mixed with the muffled anger that emanated from every pore of his skin made him look particularly scary.
Draco kissed the brunette, then licked his nipples, biting them slightly. He went down again, until reaching his cock stretched to the extreme. He took it directly in his mouth without preamble and Harry screamed his pleasure. His fingers twitched in the blond hair as Draco started quick back and forth moves. The Slytherin removed his fingers and mouth as Harry was on the verge of implosion. The brunet grunted but only smiled when he felt the blonde's awesome sex show up at his entrance.
“They have always told us that their first kiss took place there” the blonde replied, shrugging. Hermione did not understand where he was going, but let it go.
Harry tied his legs around Draco's waist when he lifted him up and walked to the shower. He pressed Harry against the cold tiles while kissing him. Hot water came out of the showerhead and Draco began to kiss Harry's neck, enjoying his moans.
“Sorry, I'm going to bed, good night, both of you” Then with these words he went to his bed, undressed, slipped between the sheets and closed the curtains. Blaise and his son looked at each other, stunned by the redhead's behavior. Zachady gave Blaise an encouraging smile before leaving the room. Blaise was planted in the middle of the room, completely lost. Then he finally went to sleep.
“No! I'll tell you” The girl screamed.
“You’re beautiful… and your hair are the softest” he said in the sleepy voice drunk men always have. Nathaniel smiled at him.
“Do you think we should try to talk to Zephir?” Harry suddenly asked when the latter sat on the ground and stared at the wall in front of him like it held all the answers to his questions. “About Dimitri, I mean” He added when Draco didn’t answer.
“Dad!” Erika threw herself into Sirius' legs and Seth into Remus's. The two adults were greatly surprised but did bend down to take the children in their arms. They walked into the room, watching the children.
“Merlin, tell me they're not ours” The blue-eyed brown laughed.
Draco caught him before he could fall into Pansy’s roses bushes. He put an arm around Harry’s waist to stabilize him before looking down at him.
“Come on, let's talk to them right now! It's a great idea” He exclaimed, starting to get up. Jordan held him by the arm.
“What? What did you say?” The blond sighed and said his sentence again, much more audibly this time.
“Your buddy went crazy when Irina asked him why he didn’t kiss me this morning.” They all laughed as they imagined the scene. Harry and Hermione then advised him not to approach Ron while he calmed down.
“Who's like me?” Sirius asked, throwing his head out the door. Harry jostled them all and rushed towards Sirius. He hugged him so hard that the older man thought he was going to end up suffocated. He did not care anymore when he heard Harry sniff. He hugged the boy harder and stroked his hair until he calmed down. Harry pulled away from him, went to get Dimitri and came back to Sirius with a big smile.
“You sure Dad’s not mad at me?” Emett asked, raising his head to meet Harry’s eyes. He saw that the kid was really upset and worried.
“I know it perfectly! I'm sleeping right next to you in case you forgot it”
“That’s impossible, he just want to fuck me because I’m perfect. Yeah, that’s obviously like that. There’s no love in our meetings, I’m sure of that. And he tells me that he doesn’t love me each time and he’s a Gryffindor so he not tells lies and…” he spoke all by himself while pacing the room back and forth under his friend’s eyes. Pansy stood up and stopped him as he seems to go insane.
The latter then removed Harry's T-shirt and threw it to the ground. He then took possession of the lips so attractive. He slid his tongue into Harry's mouth and Harry moaned in his mouth, which caused an immense shudder in Draco’s back who moaned in his turn. A sound of broken dishes made them jump.
“What's going on, sir?” Severus finally asked.
He seemed to look for his words for a moment.
“Wait, what's the connection between being one of Dray and Harry's triplets and the fact that you opened that door without any problem?” Theo asked, pulling his head back from behind the shower curtain.
Harry sat next to Ron and Draco next to Blaise.
“Hermione, your highs were not bad either” Harry said. Theo choked on his laughter and Hermione became the same red color than Draco.
“Tell me what you did to her or I swear I’ll kill you” He still threatened her in that same particularly frightening voice. The girl's eyes widened but she didn’t speak. At the end of a duel of particularly dark looks, she finally pronounced a sentence.
The discussion stopped immediately and everyone stared at him. He widened his eyes and blushed instantly despite the sweet sensation that was still spreading in his brain and slowly invading his whole body. He got up and hurried off to his room. He threw himself face down on the bed in vain hope to make disappear the erection that it had provoked. He felt that the same feeling was growing and he began to moan. Time passed and he moaned louder.
When others came to join them, he left them between them. He isolated himself while staying in the water and seeing Draco lying in the grass, he had an idea. The blond boy had also undressed, it was perfect for Harry's plan. Harry sent an image of himself drowning in to Draco before disappearing under the surface of the water. The blond opened his eyes and straightened up. He looked for Harry with his eyes but seeing him nowhere, he ran towards the lake. As soon as Harry felt the shock of Draco's foot in the water, he jumped to the surface, literally gushing in front of the blonde. The blonde jumped and would fall backwards if Harry had not held him back.
“Guys, it's at the same time really fantastic and wonderful and at the same time fucking scary”
“So I said we don’t know what it is, not exactly anyway”
“what about undoing the spells and then opening the wall with magic?” Ascella asked. Harry thought it was a rather good
“Thank you very much” Harry replied with a smile and they went back upstairs.
“Don’t touch anything!” Mrs. Pomfrey cried from the stands. Draco did not listen.
“They are in the chamber of secrets” Once her sentence finished, Alya hit her head against the wall and she dropped her on the floor, unconscious. The triplets then turned like one man and left the apartment, Zephir, Erin, Joris, Alarik and Jordan on their heels. Harry and Draco exchanged glances before following them. Draco opened his mouth wide when his five children asked the Chamber of Secrets to open up in Parseltongue and he understood perfectly. He froze on the spot, even after everyone except Harry jumped.
“And you?” Harry asked.
He wanted to wait for Ron to talk with him. He was thinking about what he would say to the redhead when he felt someone sit on him. He smiled against the mattress and turned around. Draco stood above him and a lecherous smile stretched his lips. It didn’t take long for Harry to understand his intentions. He then pulled on the neck of the blonde with a sharp blow. Their faces were so close to each other that they could feel each other's breath on their faces. Harry ran his hand behind his neck and he finally laid his lips on those of the blonde. His lips parted and their tongues mingled. Harry ran his hand through Draco's hair as his other hand began to undo the buttons on his shirt.
“I exposed my observations to Dumbledore, but he didn’t want to tell me more” They were frowning now, not seeing what she was meaning
“Just don’t kill her” She asked in a small voice.
“Dimi?” Lyra asked, narrowing her eyes, trying to distinguish him better in the dark.
“ You all?” Ron was amazed.
“Tell me more, please” Draco whispered, still staring at them.
“Hey Mione, how are you?” She looked extremely relieved and threw herself into Harry's arms, crushing Draco's arm, still on Harry's chest. The blonde said nothing and simply clenched his teeth. Harry squeezed his arms around Hermione and she pulled back, standing up by the bed.
“We knew it would happen Ezé”
Ezekiel got up and approached his fathers.
“I love you” He whispered, opening his eyes. Harry smiled too.
“You know who's up, don’t you?” He asked his two blond sons. The two laughed and then nodded in one movement. A scream sounded upstairs and Draco laughed as he recognized Harry's voice.
“Sounds pretty good, hum?” She nodded, smiling. Draco and Harry finally calmed down and Harry finally straightened up. When he met the gray eyes, he blushed, embarrassed by his behavior. Harry bowed his head as he felt his dress pulled. He saw Irina, the blue-eyed girl, so he lifted her off the ground and put her on his lap. She began to eat what was on her plate and quickly Lesath was dissatisfied. Draco then put him on his own lap. Harry was glad to have gone to eat early and to have several tables when he saw the ten people still in the apartment arrived together. They all settled in a happy hubbub. Ginny and Pansy joined them and they were complete. Harry noticed that Ron looked different, less reassured and more open to his children. He smiled at his friend, happy to have found him again. Harry noticed that Dumbledore had risen and approached them. He had a sudden bad feeling. The director stopped at their level and gave them classes for the day to get to know each other better and to digest the new events that took place. Harry knew he was talking about this story of Soul mates. He looked at Hermione.
“A lot” He chuckled, shrugging his shoulders. The blond rolled his eyes.
He found the three Slytherins talking, each lying on their bed and staring at the ceiling. Draco was portraying a portrait of Harry.
“Yeah, I need it for my present”
“Eleanor is Ezekiel's girlfriend and Lyra is her sister, but it's also Joris's girlfriend who is Eleanor's brother”
“Hermione, do you know how this emotional story works?”
“It's because of Grandpa Lu” Draco and Harry froze and as one man leaned back and saw Lucius and Narcissa at the teachers' table. Lucius wore a sadistic smile and gave them a small wave as Narcissa grinned at his son.
“Aunty, you're the smartest person we all know here” Jordan was now in front of Hermione and grabbed her shoulders with both hands. They looked into each other's eyes and Hermione felt herself blush under the piercing blue gaze of the brunette facing her.
“It's Voldemort” He explained to her darkly, a murderous spark lit in his eyes. She nodded and cast a spell on Harry, which told him that he had just fainted from tiredness.
“Do they really need to come?” She asked Remus.
Remus paused in his chat with Sirius, and almost came running.
Emett nodded, still sniffing, but a small smile took place on his lips.
They had met Umbridge as soon as they arrived in the elevator. Lucius had started an insignificant discussion with her, which had led them right into her office. Thanks to his new powers, Harry had opened each drawer as silently as possible and could quickly understand that the necklace could only be found around the woman's neck. Zephir and Harry used their magic to lift the cloaks into one. The triplets could then join their hands and a perfect replica of the medallion was formed before them, still under the capes. Harry stared admiringly at the details of the locket forming little by little before his eyes. Once the medallion was fully formed, Zephir floated it to the woman in pink. Harry then went into action by detaching the Horcrux from her neck. They all sighed with relief when the two medallions were exchanged.
“He must be with Lyra and Jordan” Ezekiel frowned.
“It's because they're your children ... Coming from the future” Dumbledore said. His declaration was followed by a great silence. All the students of the present day were wide-eyed. Hermione was the first to reconnect with reality.
“Can you guys apparate them in the apartment?” Zach asked the triplets. They all winced.
This long day ahead started badly for Harry. To be caught watching his enemy wasn’t what he’d call a good start to the day. He blew a good blow and got out of bed. He walked, a step too fast to look natural, to the bathroom. He closed the door a little brutally and leaned against it. He sighed, closing his eyes, his head leaning against the dark wood behind him. This situation couldn’t last, if he had to live with Malfoy then he wouldn’t do it in this heavy and hateful atmosphere. On this new good resolution, he opened his eyes and went in the shower. When he came out of the bathroom, his eyes fell immediately on Malfoy's back. The latter was standing in front of a cupboard filled with more classy clothes than the others. He was not wearing his towel but a black boxer. Harry couldn’t stop his gaze from coming off the blonde's back and down his body. Harry blushed furiously as his eyes fell on Malfoy's ass. He quickly looked away and went to his closet too.
Harry smiled, letting out a tear and he hugged the one woman he considered like a mother against him.
“Because I feel the urgent need to kiss you” He whispered.
The silence stretched in the room and suddenly there was a loud rumbling coming from the ceiling. Everybody looked up and gathered at the center of the room.
“Why don’t you look the same?” Hermione asked.
“It's not because some kids say that you, Harry and I are going to end up married with Malfoy and his mates that it’s gonna happen Hermione!” Hermione took a few steps back, slightly frightened.
“I'm hungry dad” Lesath reminded them of his presence by addressing Malfoy. The latter just smiled at him before leaving for the living room, Harry on his heels. All the others then followed them into the living room where Jordan and his two sisters watched, a little frightened, their father fuming.
“I don’t know what you're talking about” Draco said innocently and the sensation intensified. Harry gave a really indecent moan that made Draco shudder. He approached and turned Harry on his back and settled on his hips.
"I don’t trust and I don’t want to have anything to do with those dirty snakes” he replied disgustedly. It was Harry's turn to sigh.
“We'll see the details later” Erin said.
“Who are you talking about?” That is, four of their children had green eyes. Draco understood who Sirius was talking about.
“You know that's not what I meant to say” Harry smiled at him, knowing full well that he was not in the same category as Blaise. Harry then mentally asked Draco if he could send Hermione to him.
“Let’s find out” Harry said as he extended his arms to him. Emett wrapped his little arms around his neck and Harry got up. Emett was rather small for his age, looking more like an eight years old than an eleven years old. Harry held him against him as he went down the stairs.
“Please, don’t do anything while we're here” Blaise asked. Draco and Harry laughed and then undressed and went to bed. Harry spent a good part of the night staring at the ceiling, thinking that Draco was sleeping. He dreaded the days to come. Draco stared at Harry, refusing to sleep alone. They finally fell asleep, a smile on their lips, happy to be together.
“We can only play by two, but if you want you can play with daddy later” Draco offered. Harry kicked the blonde's ribs. Draco snickered and they passed the little boy who nodded and they finally entered the bathroom. As soon as the door closed, Draco kissed Harry while dropping the blanket to the floor.
“Or you can go straight to the part in which you kiss him” Ron blushed to the roots of his hair and stammered that he could not do that.
“So? What’s happening to us?” Draco asked them. It was Blaise who answered him.
“How far is your present from here?”
It happened two weeks ago. He would probably always remember it, how they fought that day. The scene had been violent. Things had been broken. Draco’s heart as well as some very old and expensive statues.
“What did you understand, Draco?” Harry finally asked after a moment.
“Are you mad at me too?” He asked with a small voice Harry had never heard from him.
“All I remember is that I was sleeping and when I woke up, we were lying in the Chamber of secrets” The young blonde began.
“Increased powers, remember?” Nathaniel simply replied to his boyfriend. He nodded, trying to catch his breath.
“So...You two huh?” Harry and Draco glared at them.
“Little family reunion” Jackson, who was sitting on a shelf in a corner of the room, said.
Harry awoke with a start when he heard a scream. He straightened up quickly. Draco looked down at him smiling.
“We have to go to the Chamber. Now”
“But how?”
“Do you think this secret story still holds?” He asked, glancing at the stands, where everyone seemed to be staring at them, waiting impatiently for what would happen next.
“Family outing!?” The only girl in the group got mad.
“Good”, the brunette’s response rumbling in his throat, moving to kiss Draco. His hands sliding underneath his shirt and up his spine. The blond fluttered his eyes shut in pleasure, but he still felt pain in his heart. ‘I shouldn’t be doing this’, he thought. Truth be told, he loved Harry so much but to his knowledge the other man only views him as a sex-partner.
“Dimi!” Shouted the little blond, running towards the taller one. Given Harry's appearance, Harry would not have thought he was receiving his son with a smile. He had a rather rebellious look to tell the truth. He had black jeans tucked in quickly in black rangers, a red and black plaid shirt open on a black tank top. And Harry was sure he would put on a leather jacket if he had to go out. Looking at him carefully, Harry saw a tattoo that seemed to travel on his host's body. Harry could never see the tattoo completely so he did not know what he meant.
A movement on his chest brought him back to the present and he heard Draco mumble something in a sleepy voice.
“Dad!” Harry dropped Draco's hand and knelt down to greet the little boy who hugged his little arms around his neck. Harry stood up and Draco slipped an arm around his waist. He also kissed the child's forehead.
“What's obvious, Mione?” Harry asked.
“I thought everyone was waiting in the living room?” Draco questioned.
“I think they both love each other” Alarik added. They all agreed to this observation.
“Pansy!” Blaise exclaimed as he turned to face her, lingering on the ‘y’ at the end.
“You really are gorgeous” Harry blushed under the compliment and stammered a ‘thank you’. Draco laughed slightly and then dragged Harry into the living room, where music was already ringing. He began to smile seeing his friends who were already having fun. He approached Hermione and Ron chatting in a corner.
“I don’t want to interrupt you guys, but I think it's time we live and quickly” Eleanor intervened suddenly, staring at Harry's T-shirt that had just landed at their feet. They all looked at each other and with a silent agreement they went out as quickly and silently as they could. They found themselves alone in the hallway.
“We have a second invisibility cloak” Ezekiel added.
“Of course he knows” Everyone turned their heads toward Zach, who was standing against the doorframe. The tall young man spread his arms and everyone rushed into them.
“Molly, we already talked about it” She sighed and nodded dryly. They then all formed a chain to Apparate and Molly didn’t notice that Harry and Draco were holding hands to Apparate. They arrived directly inside the house.
"I agree with myself on this point" Draco stated. Harry blushed adorably and Molly cleared his throat, wishing to sit down at the table. They sat down and the meal began in silence until one of the children broke it.
