It wasn’t long after the gifts were opened that everyone started leaving, until it was just the Weasley’s, Harry, and Hermione. Against Ron’s protest that it was his birthday, Harry brought a few plates into the Weasley’s kitchen. He felt almost happy for the first time in recent memory, and even made a joke to Ron.
“Neither will I.” Another crack, and Percy was gone. Mr. Weasley gave up and stared at Harry anxiously.
“I barely passed, Granger; did you pass with an O, then? Is that why you’re attempting to help?” He snapped at the bushy-hair girl. He felt ashamed immediately for the harsh tone, but could not find it in himself to apologize. She sighed and started packing up her bag. Draco shoved all of his items into his own bag and stormed out of the classroom without waiting on Hermione.
Finally the morning post came, and there were three owls dropping off mail. That was extremely strange, and explained the delay in the post. One dropped off the Daily Prophet to his mother, but the other two had letters for Draco. He untied the letters from each of the owls, fed them each a bit of bacon, and they all flew off. One was from Hogwarts and one was from the Minister of Magic. He cut open the letter from Hogwarts first, his heart beating in his throat.
“Excellent; lead the way.”
“I would like to see you do better. This is a nightmare.”
“Yes, she was. Thinking about it, it seems to me that you two talked a little bit in school, but it’s really fuzzy; sometimes I get a headache when I try to remember too much, but I try to remember as much as possible.”
Patricia sneered at him, and seemed like she was about to talk back again. Harry wondered if he was this hot-headed as a student. Harry thought back to a few of his interactions with Severus as a student; yes, he was as hot-headed as Patricia.
Ron sees something that shakes him to his core.
He wanted to stay in bed without moving the days following the punishment, but the Dark Lord called a meeting. His aunt did not hesitate to inform the Dark Lord about Draco’s transgression. The Dark Lord punished him worse than his aunt, and his father did not look at Draco the entire time. Once he regained consciousness he vowed to never act like such a bloody Gryffindor again. However, he couldn’t knowingly let someone starve to death, so he broke his promise three more times when they had forgotten about the prisoners for more than a couple of days. He was more careful after his punishment, though, and had thankfully hadn’t been caught those times.
James chuckled again, and Severus hummed. Harry realized that he was subtly probing to see how much James remembered of his past.
Dear Mr. Malfoy,
“We are two of the eight people in Care of Magical Creatures, how?”
Draco looked back at Harry and said, “Surprisingly slow day, so I am able to take off when I planned to. Next week will be my last week here for nearly a year, so they’re having some other healers stay later and taking the more difficult cases that require extra supervision.”
While he was talking, Draco moved over to sit next to Harry and placed his arm around Harry’s shoulders. Draco didn’t say anything in response, knowing it wouldn’t help or be enough. Harry put his head on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco started playing with Harry’s hair. They sat like that for a while.
Severus nodded. “Yes, well, I would stop trying to remember too much then. Lily and I grew up near each other, and were friends before Hogwarts.” James hummed. “We were calling to ask you if you would like to do an official interview here at Hogwarts for the position. We have a few other candidates, but we would like to sit down with you for a little bit longer.”
Draco and his mother sat in the dining room of Malfoy Manor, once a grand room but now had been tainted forever by the Dark Lord. Draco could not go into any part of the manor without awful memories seizing him; the Dark Lord had stained every inch of his childhood home. Draco often wondered if his mother felt the same way, but she would never tell him. His mother had not said a word to him for three days at this point, but he would not apologize for the harsh things he said to his father. His father was the reason the family had lost so much, and he deserved to be in Azkaban.
Harry and Draco both looked at each other, and Harry saw excitement in the blonde boy’s eyes. However, Harry might have been projecting his own feelings onto his friend; for the first time in months Harry was excited, and he wanted to start right away. He then realized that he enjoyed tutoring and helping others learn, but it was different from the feeling he had gotten after a DA session. Harry and Draco both looked back at Snape and nodded; Harry must have been imagining it because he thought he saw a ghost of a smile on the Headmaster’s lips.
Harry couldn’t help but appreciate that Severus rarely wasted time. James took a seat in the middle of the room, and the rest of the group surrounded him.
“Oh, thanks mate, but I have to go talk to a few students about the tutoring program. I head it, you see, so I need to get on it before I let it fall to the side. I’m afraid of things falling through the cracks with everything I’m doing this year,” Harry chuckled as he finished his, unnecessary, explanation.
Harry just nodded, but thought Neville was probably the only Gryffindor who would be able to live with Malfoy. He knew Pavarti, but Harry did not think he had ever interacted with the other girl in Gryffindor robes. Hermione followed his gaze, “That’s Lily Moon. She only talked to Sally Smith, as they were both Pure Bloods; Sally was Zacharias Smith’s younger sister. Sally died during the battle, taking a curse to save Lily’s life. They both fought to protect Hogwarts.”
Draco had moved closer to Potter as he was talking, and sat down about a meter away from Potter. Potter watched Draco with an unreadable expression before looking away; he was quiet for so long that Draco started squirming. Finally Potter looked back at Draco, this time with no emotion on his face.
Severus tilted his head, then smiled softly. “Hillary is pregnant again, we just found out yesterday.” Harry beamed at the man.
“Nobody wanted to say anything, because we knew that you didn’t mean to and it would make you feel horrible. You’re just so busy with everything, that details are slipping through the cracks. It’s fine, nobody is overly hurt. We are just worried about you.”
Draco cursed and agreed to tell Pansy when he saw her. Zabini brought down the privacy shield as Granger and Weasley walked into the Great Hall without Potter, which was the normal; Draco didn’t think that Potter had been in the Great Hall since the Welcome Feast. He wondered when Potter was eating, however his thoughts raced from his mind when a powerful stinging jinx hit him in the cheek. His eyes watered, but he refused to show pain.
He reached the eighth year common room and saw that Harry was by the fire intently writing. Harry looked up and smiled at Draco. Draco shoved all the nastly feelings down and smiled back at his boyfriend.
But that wouldn’t be wise
Hartley, Potter, even though he does not necessarily deserve the title, however those words will not leave this room, understand?” Draco and Harry both nodded, and Snape seemed satisfied. “I am considering what my feelings might have been should the Headmaster had started a study group for my classes, and I would not have pleased. I would have assumed the Headmaster thought me incapable of teaching adequately, but I realize that I did not have the time as a Professor to have a session like this for each year on top of my classes. So, I am strongly suggesting you figure out how to set up a session like this for the core classes that every first through fifth year is required to take. Once the other Professors find out about the sessions, I will deal with the fall-out, but I believe they will eventually be pleased. The setup is completely up to you two.”
“She didn’t show up to the Prefects’ carriage?”
“I will also need you to start inspecting the first year prospective students. First to see if any have alarming addresses, like yours, and secondly to distinguish the Muggleborn and Halfblood students who will need a professor to visit them. After that, please randomly assign the professors to go and explain the magical world to the student, add me to the list in the spot of Minvera, and contact the professors to sort out a schedule. All the students should be contacted before July 25th, so they have time to decide if they really want to attend Hogwarts. I would like a rough schedule by next Friday.”
Harry didn’t give himself time to think about it, or for the group to answer, before plunging into the Great Hall. He wanted to stop and turn around, he felt himself start to shake. He knew this was an extremely bad idea. He noticed that the hall was very quiet, and people were staring. His legs were turning into jelly.
“Yes, Ida?”
“Why would anyone place such dangerous and volatile charms on a living individual?”
The crowd wasn’t praising Harry anymore, and Ron and Hermione looked at Harry with an unreadable expression. “Why did you protect her, mate?” Ron asked with an accusing tone, and Harry merely shrugged in response. Hermione looked away without saying anything. Mrs. Weasley, Mr. Weasly, and Ginny had seen it happen, as well; they didn’t say anything either, but Ginny sneered at Harry. Harry felt a hand clasp his shoulder suddenly, and looked back to see Neville.
Ron walked back up to Harry’s room, and took a deep breath before walking in. Hermione was sitting next to Harry, who had thankfully re-gained some colour; she looked so tired and afraid. Ron cast the cleaning charm at the bed, and the blood disappeared. He was thankful the puddle of blood wasn’t there anymore, but he didn’t think he would ever forget it. Hermione looked up at him, and then looked back at Harry.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“His wand is being checked by the Ministry, he wouldn’t have used the Imperius Curse,” said a Ravenclaw girl.
Draco looked at the Gryffindor and felt terribly guilty over forgetting Pansy’s birthday; he hoped that Blaise had told everyone else about her birthday before yesterday so that she received gifts. He would have to look at a catalog later to buy her an appropriate gift. Then he thought about his group of friends being worried about him, which was unusual. Before this year, Goyle and Crabbe just followed him while he talked to Pansy when it was convenient; they never cared for him as more than the Prince of Slytherin, on top of the social hierarchy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“What’s your grandchildren’s names?”
“That’s bullshite, Potter. Everyone who died in the Second Wizarding World was because of the Dark Lord, and the ones who died at Hogwarts had the opportunity to leave. They didn’t because they thought the light was worth fighting for, and they would be pissed to know you’re shortchanging their sacrifice.”
“Ms. Batson. A word, if you wouldn’t mind?”
Harry was startled the first year's turn to be sorted stretched past the sixth minute; it had to be the longest sorting he had ever seen. Harry looked up at Severus wondering if he should step in, but the hat suddenly shouted it’s decision.
Draco had refused to call Dumbledore by any other name, and called James and Lily the Waller’s to make a habit of it. Dumbledore looked out of his portrait sadly, and nodded. Draco walked over and projected the image of James’s charms. He pointed to a random one on the right that was overlapping a couple other strands, and Harry wondered why that exact strand.
“I was afraid that it would be too much responsibility, but I seemed to have judged you aptly. Now that this commitment has ended, I would like to present you with another one. It will last much longer than one Quidditch season, though. I will not pressure you into a decision though.”
“I don’t want to talk about them.”
“I’ll try my best.” He hesitated before saying his next sentence, “You’re the second Lily to save my life.”
Unlike any year before
That’s up to me to decide
Draco and Harry both stood up to leave when Snape did, but Snape softly said “Mr. Potter stay behind, please,” when they had taken a few steps. Harry stopped and turned towards Snape slightly wary. Snape was regarding him with the curious expression again, and Harry realized that Snape hadn’t been a git during the whole conversation. Then he thought about the times he had traveled into Snape’s office to go to his therapy sessions, and realized Snape hadn’t been awful to him for a couple of weeks now.
He nodded, “Children can be cruel, but helping them learn can be incredibly rewarding.”
The first room in the female’s wing will be occupied by MacDougal, Abbott, and Gryffindor Patil.
Ida nodded, and Harry took off to the other side of the train. If he was being honest, he had not agreed with Severus about appointing Patricia Batson as a Prefect. She was brilliant and determined, but a bit flaky. Harry was not at all surprised that she had not showed up.
On a side note, I am writing a sequel set six years in the future with Professor Harry and Healer Draco at Hogwarts, happy with their lives. Then a twist.
Lily nodded and took out her wand, “What should we do to start removing these charms?”
Harry nodded, half of him hoped that his parents did not accept the position while half hoped they did. Even if they did not know Harry was their son, he would still have an opportunity to get to know his parents. He and Draco had talked about it quite a bit over the last few weeks. Draco was of the belief that he should not think of them as his parents as he thought it would only hurt him more as he learnt more about them and would eventually realize that he would never be truly a part of their family.
“Yes, well, maybe tell someone. The school is paying for you to talk to someone once a week; I’m sure she would be a great person to talk to.” Snape said this dryly and Harry snorted without thinking about it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry was stunned, but quickly began clapping. He did not miss Sirius’s sneer directed at Minerva, nor Alice’s slap to the back of Sirius’s head. He wondered what problems his siblings had with each other. James beamed at his youngest child’s sorting, though, so Harry guessed that was what mattered.
I hope this letter finds you well. It is not a requirement for you to go back to Hogwarts, however I will extend the same deal to you that I did your former classmates. If you go back, prove to everyone that you deserve to be outside of Azkaban by studying hard and staying out of trouble, and get at least 4 N.E.W.T.S, then I will cut down your probation to 3 years. Your year in Hogwarts will count towards your probation. However, you injure anyone on purpose or get into too much trouble, graver consequences than the point system and detentions will be doled out.
And we should all stick together
Harry could hear her voice breaking, and knew she was going to start crying. Despair at making his friend cry warred with the desire to just wilt away. Hermione doesn’t deserve this, you git, pull yourself together. With that thought, Harry felt the cloudiness lift away from his brain a bit and sighed. He pushed himself up slightly, and had to breathe through the nausea and lightheadedness. It had been too long since he ate, and his body was angry at him for it.
Warning: Suicide Attempt and Language
The Eighth years see their new common rooms.
“I’m not particularly gifted with academics, but I could help with History of Magic.”
“It’s Valentine's Day, Draco. I’m surprised you and Harry aren’t still in bed too, now that I think of it.” Draco felt the bottom of his stomach drop; he could not believe that he had forgotten Valentine’s Day. He glanced at Harry who was looking at him in amusement, he then glanced at the rest of the group.
He locked the door and started sobbing. He drew out his wand and cast the curse to cut his wrist, knowing Kreacher wouldn’t know he was back before it was too late. Unfortunately, his sobbing made his hand shake and he wasn’t sure if he cut the vein. He cast the curse again, and again. Looking at the three bleeding cuts through the tears, Harry was finally satisfied that he had accomplished it. He passed out a few seconds later, with a slight smile on his face because he had finally set the universe right.
The train ride to Hogwarts bring some unsettling truths to light.
After the interaction with Luna, Harry was shaken. He was sure his misery wasn’t too obvious, and he didn’t want to make this birthday celebration awkward after the Weasley’s had put so much effort into it. He couldn’t make his cloudiness disappear, but he was trying to hide it. However, hiding it was exhausting, and after only two hours, Harry was ready to sleep and hide again. He went upstairs and hid in Ron’s room until the dinner started, hoping Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t think he was being too rude.
“What did you learn?”
“How can we break your charms?” Severus asked.
“Potter you know that my timetable has no room for socializing until eight tonight.”
Harry felt a flair of anger, but it was gone as quickly as it came. He just blinked at Hermione, and shrugged. She visibly let out some of the tension from her shoulders at his lack of reaction.
Harry put a fake smile on his face, and apologized while saying he was fine. He didn’t offer an explanation to Ron, and hoped Ron wouldn’t ask. He hated lying to his friends, but he would lie about this to avoid worrying about him. Ron continued staring at him thoughtfully, and nodded after a bit. He then asked if Harry wanted to start opening his gifts. Harry was glad for the change of subject, and agreed.
“Well we definitely need to work on communicating better for our relationship.” Draco looked surprised.
“Ok, well why were you not protected in school?”
James perked up, “Really? That’s smashing! Lily is right in the other room, so I’ll bring her through?”
“No he didn’t, but I don’t want to talk about him anymore.”
Harry blushed. Of course Draco had noticed, Harry didn’t know why he had expected anything different. It was a bit humiliating how open of a book Harry was.
“Mr. Waller?”
“Draco, darling, I haven’t been keeping secrets from you, but -”
Harry nodded, and the two were silent once more. After what seemed to be an intense conversation, Lily and James came back over. James still looked shocked, but seemed to accept the information.
“I’m sure you will always be able to find food, Weasel.” Ron sneered at Draco. The two teens still didn’t like each other, but they were civil now compared to what they were before. The friends stood up and walked to the Great Hall together. The end of the year feast would be later, but the Great Hall was already decorated with the Ravenclaw banners. Harry saw a first year running towards him, and smiled at Ida. She hugged him and he hugged her back.
Or Raven or Slytherin
Her voice was pleasant and she spoke in a manner that put Harry on edge for an unknown reason, “I’m Harry Potter, and I’m eighteen. I lost my parents when I was one, and the man that murdered them, Voldemort, tried to kill me as well. The scar it gave me made me famous, and Voldemort targeted me almost every year at school after I turned eleven.” Mira looked shocked and wrote down something in her notebook.
Well at least which House will be yours
“They didn’t die because of you, they made their own choices. From what I understand about the war, they died for their beliefs or a madman murdered them. You can’t help the circumstances you were thrown into. What do you think could help you from having a flashback in the Great Hall?”
Just because Harry is friends with Draco doesn't mean that everybody is on board.
Harry wondered where the hate he had always felt for Malfoy was, but not even a ghost of irritation was presenting itself. He stepped to the side slightly and Malfoy looked surprised at the lack of an argument or nasty response, but the surprise was quickly replaced with suspicion. Malfoy sneered at Harry and started towards the train again. Harry watched as the Malfoy’s walked and saw two hexes come at Malfoy. He deflected one with a lazy flick of the wrist, and Mrs. Malfoy blocked the other. However, neither noticed the purple light coming for Mrs. Malfoy’s side.
He didn’t have to wait long because Mira Johnson walked out and told him to go into her office. He sat down on a comfy chair and squirmed while the older lady watched him; she was in her late fifties if Harry had to guess, but looked very professional. Finally she spoke with her American accent, “Hello, Harry. I’m Mira Johnson, but you can call me Mira; I’m from the United States, and I have three grandchildren. I’ve been practicing psychology for over thirty years and received my PhD almost five years ago. What do you want to tell me about yourself?”
After that day, someone started dropping in to “visit” Harry every three or four days. Most of the visitors seemed to be slightly annoyed when stopping by, but all stayed for about an hour and didn’t leave until they saw him eat something. Harry was also annoyed by the visits as they interrupted his plans to stay in bed every day until his birthday dinner; also, he knew they were only doing it because Mrs. Weasley had requested it, it was too suspiciously timed not to be her doing. He didn’t want to go to the dinner, and definitely didn’t have the energy for; however he didn’t want to hurt his mother figure’s feelings when she had spent so much time preparing.
Defense Against the Dark Arts
“No. They can replay the memories of this room and see that I followed you in here; I have no intention of going to Azkaban with my father, Potter, so I will stay here until you leave and then follow you until we go back to the common room.”
Lily Moon was staring at him with a concerned look on her face, and a hand unconsciously resting on her stomach. The stomach that was housing his child because Lily agreed to be a surrogate for him and Draco. She deserved the truth, and so did everyone else at this table. They had been there for him so often throughout the years, and, after all, they were his family.
“Keeping someone safe from harm is more important than school; it’s obvious that you’re not inclined to keep yourself safe, so I’ll keep intervening. That doesn’t mean we’re friends.”
I doubled posted because I really hated the last chapter, honestly.
“I almost did, but then Lily stopped me. We’re friends now, so something good came out of that day.” Harry regretted admitting to Draco what had happened, because the look of pure misery on his face was something Harry never wanted to see.
“I want to look at them first before deciding. If there is no way to safely break the charms, then they stay put.”
“Draco, my darling son, please don’t start trouble this year. So much is riding on your N.E.W.T.S., and everyone is waiting for you to misstep. Do not give them a reason to place you back in Azkaban with your father, please.”
“Let’s go somewhere where we won’t have Madam Pince glaring at us for talking, yeah?” Ida blinked and then glanced around seemingly to look for Pince with an anxious look on her face. “I know an abandoned classroom on the fifth floor that is big enough for whatever you are learning about in Defense. How about we meet off the staircase in an hour, will that work?”
After everyone stopped reaching towards the food, Mrs. Weasley asked her sons and Ginny to help clear the table. Once the table was cleared, a huge cake with the words “Happy Birthday Harry” written in green came out. When almost everyone started singing, Harry wanted to duck under the table and hide. He stammered out a thanks to everyone and took the first bite of the piece of cake offered to him. It was only after he smiled at something Charlie said, his first smile since before the Battle of Hogwarts, that he noticed Ron, Hermione, and Mrs. Weasley relax a bit.
“Surely beats being an orphan crying for his dead parents every night, doesn’t it though?”
"Sometimes war needs conflicts-of-interest." He says looking down into his cup of tea. The lines in his face were pulled tight as it looked like he was in deep thought about something. "It allows people to fight more passionately."
"Just missions for the Order. I haven't been home very much so please excuse the mess. I only just got home last night actually."
He looked down at himself where the black ink on his stomach was an even darker black than before and spread from hip to hip. Draco reached out to touch it resulting in a sharp wince from Harry.
Malfoy ruins the image by standing up straight up where the sun can't reach him. The git was aggravatingly pretty when his trap was shut.
But the tiny voice in his head had given him a little bit of hope. Perhaps this is the miracle she had mentioned? If they could find you they would have already. Going back would be such a waste, wouldn't it? To finally get your dreams fulfilled to foolishly throw it back at the universes face. Maybe you could be safe. Safe with Potter.
PROLOGUE
Draco shot him a murderous glare as his throat began to close in panic. Did they
"I think others would disagree," Harry managed through another fit of coughs. Draco grimaces and casts a wordless less. Immediately Harry's lungs begin to feel better.
Sorry folks. I can't tell if I made them both a little too OOC in this... but it would make sense for Harry to tell Draco what bravery is and Draco himself finally have his Breakdown™ after all this time. Also, shorter chapter but it's been only three days since the last update so.

Harry gave one rough push out of pettiness and stepped back to see if any part of the blonde was visible. It looked like an empty self. He prayed to Merlin it stayed that way.

Harry scoffs. "Me?
Draco's eyes narrow when he meets a familiar set of hazel ones. Fury boiled up inside him.
The crunch of dead grass coming near him is what catches his attention. It was Potter and he had to consciously keep himself from clenching his hands. Did this man listen to anything he was told?
Words: 2256
Rip this chapter fucking sucks. I had no idea what to do. I have writers block :,)
Advanced Rune Translation? Check.
"Did it work?"
His voice was threatening and deadly steady. Potter's eyes dug into Draco's and told him he was serious. He could be really threatening if he wanted but it was hard to at the moment when he looked so fragile.
, Draco. Don't you think you should ask me on a date first?" Harry manages to tease despite the pounding headache in his head. He could hardly pay attention with his heart beat flooding his ears. He was just suddenly so
"The issue?
"I didn't go through all this trouble to get you out of that house for you to wallop in your pain. What hurts?"
Draco felt himself panic a little. He knew these were symptoms of a panic attack from his own experience, but what the bloody hell was he supposed to help another's?
"M' okay."
Draco subconsciously rubs his left forearm and winces at the pain. It was covered up by his usual dress-shirt and robes. There hadn't been a single time this year he hadn't been seen wearing anything other than a long-sleeves. He was hyper-vigilant about it being seen at all times. It was his biggest insecurity drawn where anyone could see it. As of now, the mark was irritated. A normal occurrence in the past weeks. It happened every time he ignored a call. It rose above the skin and the edges around it were bright red. Touching it sent a pulse of agony into his bones.
Draco processed the slimy git's words. It didn't seem possible that Voldemort would choose someone like him.
He sighed with his head in his hands and limped over to the bay window. The day's events were flying through his head like wild snitches. Draco-fucking-Malfoy, of all people, had somehow come to his rescue. Despite how he hated how it sounded, it was true. Uncle Vernon would have beat him to a pulp if Malfoy hadn't made him snap to his senses in time.
"Take off your shirt." Draco demands as soon as Harry managed to crawl back into his bed.
He knew this was going to happen as soon as he got the Ministry's letter yesterday. He'd already come up with a cover story with Draco's insistence that morning. That didn't stop the frigid feeling in his stomach. Remus finding out about the death eaters was one thing (though he probably already guessed that part a little bit already), but the Dursely's was another. And if Dumbledore knew that was the initial reason he ran away Harry doesn't think he'd be able to handle the disappointment in his mentor's eyes.
"Come, Harry. In my office please." Dumbledore turned to the statue blocking the entrance. "Crunchie."
"You need to talk to someone. You can't just sit here and deteriorate from existence."
Harry grumbled something unintelligible under his breath.
to fight?"
He was used to being in this position of helplessness, but that didn't mean he was any less numb to the frustration that piled up within him. He shot a glare behind him to see who had shot the tripping hex. The trio had stopped near the opposite end of the hall, Weasley with his wand out and Hermione looking at him with a mix of shock and dismay. He knew it wasn't for his own sake. Behind them was Harry, his focus centered on Draco laying on the floor. He didn't move to help him. Draco didn't expect him to. It was obvious the brunet was torn.
His mother and he had still made short visits to her in secret when his father wasn’t home. Although she still believed in blood purity, his mother also believed that it wasn’t worth losing a valuable friendship over. That is until the war resurfaced. They couldn't risk being spotted with her now. He was on the very edge being here as it was now.
"Come back safely or I swear to Merlin I'll tie the both of you up and let the shopkeeper's hounds next door have you!"
Draco glanced back at the guitar. He hadn't touched it since he'd come back to school. There was an uncertain, looming darkness around it that warded him away. It was too tangled up in his inner turmoil now. It was a perfect representation of the two wars inside his head. One that his father's opinion shouldn't matter after everything he's done and was the spark of rebellion that led him to learn in the first place. The darker part of him doubted his defiance, that his father really was looking out for the best of him and it was his fault he couldn't be the son that he wanted. Was it crazy to believe in both things equally at once?
"No, I'll do it."
Draco doesn't know how long he sits there in the cold being miserable and angry. It turns dark enough for him to look up and see tiny specks of light above him. It's cold enough for him to wrap his arms around himself and wish he had looked a bit harder before mistaking grabbing Potter's jacket instead.
"We will, Bramble. Love you."
Draco was writing down a line of text from his herbology text when his hand suddenly jerked heavily. A thick line of ink tore through his notes where his hand had spasmed. He yanked it back in surprise.
Suddenly blinding pain exploded from his face as he was expelled back towards the ground. His head hit the ground with a powerful bang, sending an extra wave of pain from the opposite direction. Pain sears through his head better than a branding iron. Without meaning to his body curls into something fetal, something primeval, while the pain resonates.
Draco pushed past someone roughly on his way out the door. Only when he looked back halfway down the hall did he realize it was Ginny Weasley. Harry was with her, smiling as if she said a joke. The cherry on top of the cake was when the girl laid a hand on his arm. If Draco's face could have hardened any more, it was definitely in that moment.
"She's You-Know-Who's right-hand servant, but she's also a Black and she's very proud of that. She's been trying to claim Sirius' fortune for her own through various solicitors
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm right here you know-"
"Then you should've let me speak before going on a rant about me luring you into a trap."
btw, thank you all for the lovely comments! I get more here than I do on Wattpad now which is saying something!
The room was dark except for the soft moonlight coming from his open window. Distant owl screeches played far in the distance. It seemed everything was calm beside the crying boy on the floor.
"Right," Draco said, the happiness coming off him in waves. "Let's go get you a cure."
about losing people."
Shit.
“Oh, its nothing dear...just curious dear.”
to see him even if it was childish. What he told Draco was right, Dumbledore was the only way he was going to have the slightest chance of filling the prophecy, but he had planted a seed of doubt in his head that maybe that wasn't so true after all. Besides, the headmaster had a habit of finding out things Harry didn't want him to know. He looked up to him and didn't want to be seen as a disappointment in those eyes yet he couldn't stop it if he didn't stop poking his nose where it shouldn't be. He also would want to send him back to the Dursleys next year where he'll no doubt be killed. He had every right to be terrified of being back in his office. He stomped his floor on the ground in frustration.
, he thinks selfishly.
Draco doesn't respond. He hoped it would send a message that he wasn't in the mood. Even if he wanted to speak, he couldn't. The clump in his throat was far too large.
"No?"
"Hey freak, where's my breakfast?" Dudley taunts with a glare when she's out of earshot.
"Don't say his name you dunce-"
The way she immediately brightened his mood was one of the many reasons Draco liked Bramble. When he was little she used to babysit and tutor him when both his father and mother were out (which was more days than he liked to admit). She was a nanny of some sort. She would bake him cookies when he was sad or play with him in the quidditch pitch when he was having a bad day. And when he got hurt, she would take time to help heal him herself and not boss around a house-elf to do so. How a mother should.
"You're early," a voice sweeps in from behind him. His coughing had covered up the sound of approaching footsteps.
"What for?"
"Ron told us already. He said it was at the death eater attack in Knockturn alley?"
Draco shrunk back a little. He swore he could disappear out of existence out of pure guilt whenever the slur came out of either of their mouths.
"So what? Who said you
Remus pulls Harry into another hug. "It's alright, Harry. I miss him too."
Harry started walking ahead of him towards the gloomy household, not even bothering to look behind to see if Draco was following him.  The blonde watched him worryingly. He didn't want Harry to push himself into something he wasn't ready for, even if had only been a day since he had left.
"The blood wards on the 25th of August broke," Dumbledore explains, taking Harry by surprise. He knew he ran away but
Harry fell silent. He hadn't thought of that. The thought of never doing magic again was almost as terrifying as being with the Dursley's until he could move out. He would have to watch from afar as Ron and Hermione studied for their N.E.W.T.'s and graduate without him. Voldermort would find him one day and he'll be left defenseless to die at the same hand who killed his parents. Or he could live in hiding the rest of his life. No one would ever know where he was. He'll be safe and so would everyone he loved. Either way he'll be in exile the rest of his life. Could he ever handle that?
Now for the easy part, Draco muses. The room was perfectly clean cleaned as if yesterday had never happened. The door was backed on its hinges and the screw sized indents in the wall were already patched it. Draco scrunched up his nose. These people were more intent or orderliness than his own parents. That, or they were just very intent on forgetting Harry ever existed.
I told you I was busy. I'm not a child. You know I didn't mean what I said to Weasley and I know what you said didn't either. Simple."
He looked downwards at the dirt trailing off his body and into the drain. There was so much of it you could have mistaken the water as brown. The sight made Harry’s gut turn in frustration. It was his first actual shower in weeks that didn’t involve the piercing pressure of a gardening hose. And it was all the Dursley’s fault.
Then Sirius.
Remus was right behind him trying to help but Harry lazily swatted him away. It was embarrassing enough that Draco, Ron, and Hermione all knew about this. Dragging Remus in as well on top of everything else he has to worry about was a big no-no line.
Draco had never been much of an affectionate person. At age five he'd demanded his mother stop kissing his cheek because he was 'too grown-up'. Perhaps it was his father's blood because he sure as hell didn't express his emotions either (he debated whether he had any to begin with). Draco liked to think of himself a bit more formal or reserved than that. He was much more accustomed to exchanging pleasantries and saying what he meant without physically acting. He didn't like impulse. He was a Slytherin for a reason.
Yatin shrugged tauntingly and went back to his work. "I suppose your mummies hadn't thought you important enough to tell you yet. I'm sure he'll have room for you somewhere if you beg. I heard the official boot-polisher job is up for grabs."
“How do you think I met you, silly?” She laughs and reaches over to ruffle his messy hair. Draco smiles warmly back at her.
Draco's face dropped slightly. "Potter..."
"I know what chores are, you imbecile. But why does that affect me?"
Remus watched the exchange in the background with a reminiscent smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You know, you'd think after five years of glaring everytime I hear your name, this would be different." He places this head on the desk and tilts it so Draco has a clear view of his face. His glasses were on the edge of slipping off the smooth slope of his nose and a strand of loose hair was blocking his eyes. "This entire situation I mean. Maybe I'm just imagining things but I know less than a week ago I don't think I would have had the same reaction I did to the other night. You scared me. That's not the reaction I thought I would have, so maybe you're right. But you're also wrong."
Draco's entire body was suddenly pulled up into the air by imaginary strings. They dangled him upside in the air like he was a broken toy puppet. He felt his entire face went red entirely for different reasons than the blood rushing to his head.
"So? As far as we know you could be expelled right now. There is no rush."
Draco scowls. "I don't know what you mean. I'm perfectly normal."
"...forgot. I'm 'ired."
"If I had my wand this would be much easier. I could just do a delusion charm and we would be right in." Malfoy went on, "We might have to reply on a potion or pre-charmed item. Polyjuice would be ideal but I doubt we'll be able to find a store selling it. I might be able to brew some? No no, the recipe takes over a month..."
Snape clicked his tongue disapprovingly. "Language."
"Not everyone has rich mommies and daddies to give them everything they want,
Ron nodded, yet gave him a guilty frown nonetheless. "Hermione was just here by the way. She had to go to arithmancy. She'll be back soon." Harry nods.
"Did you see Malfoy?" Neville asks when the conversation finally settles down. "He just went flying out of the library right before you came in. I didn't see what caused it but he looked mad..."
"Right," Remus said with a light laugh at his lips, "do you want me to make some? You'll have to show me how apparently. I'm not much of a cook. I can make tea and that's it."
there was an attack inside of the school. Do you really think the Dark Lord wouldn't have gotten to you just because it was a
"I'm getting there. Now, blood magic is vastly different from normal wand casting and highly advanced. The night at Godric's Hollow your mother did not cast any wards herself and instead, her magic made it's last imprint on you which fulfilled an ancient ritual."
Draco doesn't have to turn around to know Harry's face was one of confusion. Draco could hardly blame him. He was too- did he really believe that? He should. He wanted to.
The silvery material was right at the top. Harry grabbed it and threw it at him. Draco was taller than he was so it left part of his shoes visible for Harry to hoist up the same way they had broken into the Dursley's what felt like ages ago.
“Yeah,” the tips of Ron’s ears were red, “but hearing Harry say that he didn’t think we would want him at the Burrow was what kicked my arse in gear to apologize. Sorry, though, it was rude to listen.”
Everyone thank you for the comments and kudos. I greatly appreciate it!
“Well, yeah, but it’s my fault for asking for so much.” Draco’s eyes finally found his and Harry nearly flinched from the way they burned.
“He’s lucky that he’s dead, or I would kill him.”
Tiffany let the tears fall and wrapped her arms around Harry; he fought down the instant reaction to stiffen at the sudden contact, and hugged the blonde Slytherin girl back. She let go quickly and waved bye to Draco, who looked like he had been punched in the gut. Harry blinked at him and cocked his head to the side. He shook his head and glanced between the classroom’s doorway and Harry, obviously wanting to leave but not wanting to leave Harry alone. Harry heard movement behind him, and spun around with his wand out.
Draco stepped off the train with Pansy and Zabini, and heard Harid’s usual cry for the first years to go with him. He envied the first years that rode the boats, because as he had to see the huge, omens of death horses. He followed the crowd to the carriages, but when most of the students realized who he was, they glared at him while letting him past. They obviously didn’t want to be vulnerable to a Death Eater; Draco sneered at them and kept his eyes forward while walking. He couldn’t watch his back for hexes, so he quickly cloaked himself with a protective charm. Not very long after he placed the charm, a hex bounced off of it. He made it to the carriages with three more spells bouncing off his shield, and sighed while sitting down. Zabini and Pansy climbed into the carriage, and Draco expected that they would be the only ones to join him in the carriage.
“The fact that Harry and Draco have been dating since at least the start of term.” Harry and Draco both turned to glare at Blaise for outing them. Then they looked at Weasley for his reaction to the news. He looked confused.
Harry nodded at Hermione and decided to head up to bed. Casting a final glance at the blond girl sitting by the fire.
“Good luck with that, Malfoy. ‘Mione will always come out on top.” Draco narrowed his eyes at Weasley. He was glad Harry was happier after making up with the red-haired boy, but Draco could live without him. Harry squeezed his hand again. Suddenly the morning post owls started dropping letters everywhere, including in front of Draco. He recognized the script of his mother and opened the letter with trepidation.
Snape nodded and walked towards the door. Once they both walked out of the room, Snape looked back at Harry and said, “By the way, Mr. Potter. Congratulations on the win against Ravenclaw on the 24th, you have put together a wonderful team.” Harry was flabbergasted at the direct compliment from Snape and nodded in response.
“Thank you, sir.”
She looked hopeful, but Harry didn’t think she would be too surprised if he said no. He wanted to say no, but what else would he do for the year. Hermione obviously wanted him to join her, and he could thank his professors and friends for their help. It would be easier to finish himself without Kreacher around, as Kreacher would try his best to keep Harry alive.
Draco sat down for breakfast, but Zabini and Pansy weren’t there yet; since school started again a little over a week ago, Draco usually came down for breakfast before most people were awake, so he could leave before the hall became crowded. He had discovered that most people thought he was a great target to launch their food at; although his family had been knocked off their pedestal, Draco was not going to go to class with filthy robes. Longbottom started coming to breakfast with Draco, as he liked to go to the greenhouses before class, which inevitably left a streak of dirt on his face in some way. This morning Longbottom was sitting next to Draco while eating breakfast, neither of them spoke to each other though.
“Yeah I could take most of the sessions, but it would make sense to have help. How will we find someone who is proficient and wants to help with each subject. We will need to set up five sessions each for Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Herbology, and Potions. We will also need to factor Quidditch practices. It will take a bit of work.”
“To go over my accounts, and try to find out how much Dumbledore gave to James.”
“When aren’t you hungry, Weasley?”
As Harry stared at the scarlet train that took them to Hogwarts, Harry knew he should be happy but the numbness only let anxiety through it’s thick drape over his mind. So many people tried touching Harry’s robe, shouted their thanks, and invaded his space, that Harry didn’t know what to do and the anxiety was increasing rapidly. Suddenly the crowd became silent, and Harry could breathe a little bit easier. Harry looked up to see why, and saw Draco Malfoy on the platform with his mother behind him. He was walking towards Harry, but that was probably because Harry was in his direct path to the train.
Harry looked back at Ida who looked more terrified than she did when she walked over to him. “Don’t worry Ida, Draco wasn’t trying to be mean to you. He’s just a bit grumpy because
"Cockroach Clusters, Sherbert Lemons...Licorice Snaps!"
"I need to get the bathroom." He mumbled feverishly, holding his hands over his mouth.
Harry pulls his arm away. "No, I don't think I will. You don't get to start fights and not finish them. "He pushed the boy's shoulders back for emphasis. "You don't get to decide that.”
"I'm sorry."
Draco's eyes closed. "I suppose not."
"Get it through your thick skull. The Dark Lord does not
"Safe? Harry, it's obvious what he's doing. He's
Draco stiffens. He clearly didn't want to think about it. "Obviously not. We both knew what would happen eventually, yes? Then I have no reason to be upset. And I am not."
She pulled away after a long moment and gave him glare then could quite frankly freeze someone down to their underwear if they hadn't been subjected to it since they were eleven. "Merlin and Morgana- Crowley- fucking hell. Where have you
Gregory, the smarter of the two, elbows his partner in the ribs. He shoots the wand in Draco's hand a glare before looking up and into Draco's teasing eyes.
Harry's expression formed one of a tight grimace and his hands spread like pale starfish around the cup, and they are cold too, resisting the warmth that struggles to seep into them. A low hum of a headache starts to echo throughout his head from his panic attack. Perhaps it was the tired ache in his bones that affected his next words.
Harry slapped him.
"Yeah," Vincent responds dumbly, not sensing the sarcasm. "Who else?"
Snape lets out a growl of frustration. "Do you have any idea of a mess you have caused? Selfish boy. Did you think of the consequences? You've done nothing but delay the inevitable. He will get what he wants and you will suffer for it along with will the hundreds of others because of
Draco guessed that was sort of selfish but you snooze you lose, right? Besides, most of his prized possessions were up here as he couldn't trust the other Slytherin's availability to them. There were dark green comforters and pillows scattered over the floor and the posh divans from where he's dragged them up from the dorm over the years and a couple of candy wrappers when he's forgotten to take them back down. There was an entire bookshelf dedicated to muggle literature he was steadily making his way through and hoped to finish before he left Hogwarts, or in his case, killed for treason against the Dark Lord. Or his father.
"Yeah?" Draco taunts breathlessly. He wasn't going to give in just yet; pride was one of the most valuable assets a Slytherin could own. "And I heard you couldn't wipe your own arse until you were eleven Crabbe if we're going off rumors. Something tells me you wouldn't enjoy that one going around again."
They were almost at the door to the library when Someone came flying out of the library. Harry didn't get to catch their face before Ginny was speaking again. She placed a hand on his upper arm, a couple inches from his shoulder. "I'm serious. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here. I don't care if it's even my brother being a git again. I'll be sure to sock him in the mouth if you'd like." She said it with a smirk which wasn't usually considering they both knew Ron.
Somehow his father had somehow dragged one of his favorite things down into the pits with him and he didn't even know it existed. Draco could taste the irony bubbling at his lips in a laugh.
Yatin's eyes narrowed then he looked around the library for onlookers. "Fine then. Sit."
"My fa-" he chokes, "My father isn't bad. You have no idea what you're talking about. Shut up."
"-and I didn't do this either obviously." He places his hands onto his hips and looks back up to him. "And anyway, I don't need your muggle neighbor to take me home thank you very much. I'm capable of that myself. Just take me to platform 9 ¾ and we can forget this ever happened."
Harry quickly wrapped a towel around his waist and opened the door. Malfoy was waiting there with the clothes in one hand with a small book in the other and reading intensely. He took them gratefully and changed behind the door. Though, he noticed quickly that the clothes had rapidly changed in size. They were nearly perfect in size when Harry when looked at himself in the mirror. The holes were missing from the cuffs and knees of the jeans too.
He could have a loving family, but instead, got stuck with ones that treated him like dirt under their shoe. How on
"I'm gay, Remus."
"Oh. I- uh- told Ron and Hermione that I was able to get in contact with a potions dealer with a bribe. You can send them off at the Halloween feast tomorrow..."
"Why wouldn't I be?"
"I can get caught doing almost anything, Potter. It's the matter of being smart enough to avoid so."
The thought was unmovable. He deserved to die. He was too much of a coward to really ever do anything though. After everything he's done there was no denying it. He was cruel and unforgiving. He'd made countless people feel the way he was now. He was under the command of a monster who killed thousands for his own psychopathic needs. And he hadn't even tried to fight back when it happened. Bramble's blood was even on his hands now. The bars were low for him so why couldn't he bring himself to do better?
Draco knew he was a bad person and
, Harry. I just want to be me."
Harry hated floo travel. Growing up with muggles he simply never got comfortable with it. It was messy, left him disoriented, and left an uneasy stomach. Nevertheless, it was the only option to get into Remus's home. He hadn't been yet keyed to the apparition wards and the older man wasn't the best on a broom.
Adrenaline floods his system. It pumps and beats like it's trying to escape. He didn't know why, there was no immediate danger but his heart told him otherwise. Perhaps it was because it edged so close to something that Harry himself had been trying to keep pushed down for years. His own sexuality was something he no longer wanted to think about, and now Sirius in the mix... It brought up so many things he didn't want to think about. He was terrified of someone finding out,
"Oh..."
"And why not?"
Ron shifted awkwardly. "Well, I may be a heavy sleeper but I'm not that dumb... I hear you sneak out some nights. I, uh, just didn't comment about it because it seemed kind of... personal. There are somethings you don't even tell your best mate about."
"Uh- yeah Ron! Hold on!"
"My gut instinct never have been the best but it's telling me right now that you aren't a bad person. Rationally, that's stupid because of everything that's happened between us and yet- Ron probably kill me for saying this- I don't think you meant it. It tells me that maybe now both of us think this stupid rilvery may be doing more harm than good and uh-" Harry stuffs his thumbs into trouser pockets and awkwardly looks up at the sky. "What I'm trying to say is that I don't know you but after all of this, maybe I wish I did. Okay? Don't laugh at me."
"I'm sorry," he says, barely a whisper. Remus probably wouldn't have caught it if his hearing wasn't heightened.
Draco was so focused on getting the large trunk and broom out of the cupboard he hadn't even noticed the large figure looming above him.
He heard them before he spotted them.
"I told Dumbledore we shouldn't have let you go back there. It was too soon- I should have known. I'm so sorry."
Remus gives him a stern look. "And you didn't bother to tell anyone beforehand? You could have

"Anyways, you didn't miss anything last summer. It wasn't the same without Sirius taunting mum and riling up the twins in some prank. Fred and George did come to visit and snuck Remus some blubbering chocolate they're been working on to cheer him up though. He started talking about Dumbledore's underpants right in front of the entire Order. Mum wasn't very pleased but it definitely put everyone in a good mood..."
to spark a conversation.
Remus was standing not far from the entrance in a secluded area. He was leading against the wall looking down at his dirty black shoes twirling his wand in his fingers with worry evident on his face. He had a couple more scars than last time and his posture seemed to be hunched. The crowd parted around the three just as he lifted his head. As he was Harry his dull eyes lit up in surprise then in relief.
The list went on. It was quite sad. How many people wanted to meet or be this 'savior' when in reality they knew nothing of what lay beneath his lightning bolt scar? He was nothing but a lost shell of this image they had produced and worshipped.
"Goodnight 'Ced."
"You owe me at least three sugar quills for that."
Draco puts on the best spoiled-kid not getting what he wanted face he had. He had enough experience to know exactly what that was. "You're the ones upset at not following the Dark Lord and now you're upset about me taking an interest in the dark arts as well? That's contradictory you know."
"I didn't know, Draco. Maybe ask the mark on my stomach. It's didn't exactly to fall in your arms like a fucking damseal in distress.
Weasley sneered at him, "You're the one of talk. You wouldn't hesitate the curse someone even if they were on their deathbed!"
Draco looked down at the curse swirling on his forearm and grimaced in disgust. His father was a horrible person. His opinions shouldn't matter. But then again, why did Draco's own? He was a horrible person as well and making the exception for himself would only prove his point further.
Draco continued down the hallway with his head held high, completely ignoring the trio. If he was going to make a change in his life, he had to start somewhere. Even if it was small, even if it was the appalling baby steps, he would get through it.
"Okay..."
Harry nods as quietly he munches on a biscuit. Sirius was gay. Remus was gay. Remus
Harry shook the excess ash from his hair. Ron cast a cast scourgify on both of them and he muttered a quick thanks.
made him become.
Draco came back five minutes later with his arms full of various medical supplies. As he started organizing on the bedside table he noticed Harry was lost in thought. His eyes were glazed over in a saddened state.
He sighed, regretting allowing Malfoy to share a room with him. The blonde git would probably murder him in his sleep and wouldn't even have a wand to defend himself with. If anything, that was probably exactly why he was here in the first place.
see it though, even if his reaction was a dead giveaway to their answer. The mark was the worst part of him scribbled out on his arm for everyone to see.
"Your foods done," he stated to the fat pig sitting on the couch while making his way back upstairs. Dudley's nose scrunched up in disgust.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You've got to be kidding me."
Nonetheless, the two of them decided Dean was probably right despite it being a weekend. Harry was becoming increasingly more tired during the day with his visits with Draco. It was nearly twelve and he had a game the next day.
Harry lets out a sigh of relief. "I promise."
"Perhaps. He knows more about this than I do."
They sat in silence as Harry watched Malfoy sit on the edge of his bed and glared at the wall.
Harry goes silent. Only the Order, Ron, and Hermione, and him knew the prophecy dictating the course of his life. He felt as if he could trust Malfoy. He had helped him fight against death eaters at the inn despite his father being in the ranks. Though, wanting to get along with someone and telling them life-saving information in a time of war was something different all together. His ground with him was a little unsteady to trust such a heavy secret. It just wasn't smart.
"Potter Luck?"
about it by now."
"It's alright, Ron. They were going to figure it out anyway."
has had people pestering them for the past hour and half straight." Harry glared at the blonde who now was laying himself across the entire seat like he owned it. "
Draco huffs. "All I did was take a fly-"
"Harry and 'Alfoy."
Remus urges, making him wince. He was once again unwillingly reminded that telling would have been what Sirius would have wanted. Harry takes in a long breath before sighing deeply and closing his eyes. There truly was no way out of this.
The moonlight did no justice to his already pale skin and puffy red eyes. Most of the tears hadn't even dried yet and moved farther down his face as he moved. He was too emotionally drained to wipe them away right then. Instead, he looked down at his white dress-shirt sleeves and pushed the right side all the way up to his elbows. His hand's hands shook wildly in the process.
Malfoys don't cry, his father's words rang in his ears from when he was five years old and just fell off his quidditch broom. He didn't understand the tone and threat in his voice at the time but more so when he grew older. Malfoys don't show emotion.
was the fair? For anyone? Yes, there were always the Weasleys, but even then he felt like he was intruding on their family when they invited him over for long periods. Especially Christmas.
Draco took a step closer to the boy, though, he hesitated when Potter glared at him. He gulped. He wanted to apologize for everything he had said over the years yet he was scared for some reason. Maybe it was the fear of getting rejected. Or maybe he was just scared of what his father would do if he found out he wasn't perfect little doll anymore.
He stands up angrily and stomps his way over to Harry. One large hand grabs his arm and the other pins him against the wall.
, you would help me. It's your rubbish anyways that needs rescuing."
"Let- let us go!"
lmao, oop? Sorry I haven't posted in like two weeks. Tbh I didn't even realize it was that long and besides, I have school now. And my geometry grade is drooping, yikes.
“How could you?” she whispered menacingly. “You don’t deserve him. We all saw this blow up coming, we warned you, and told you to lessen the load. But you didn’t listen! Then you went and spoiled the best relationship you will ever have, Draco Malfoy. All over a bad grade, that was probably grade unfairly in the first place! Don’t talk to any of us until you’ve nearly made this right!”
The bell rang dismissing the class and everyone raced towards the door, but Hartley’s voice rang out. “Mr. Potter, I have a note from the Headmaster here. Take it so I’m not tempted to read it.” Harry bit back a sigh and walked to the desk; grabbing the note, he said a quick word of thanks, and walked out of the classroom. Ron and Hermione did not hear Hartley telling Harry to grab the note, and hadn’t noticed that Harry wasn’t walking with them anymore. Harry was ok with that as he didn’t want to make an excuse for why Snape wanted to see him; his friends only spoke to him while they were walking to breakfast, and seemed to forget him throughout the day. Harry’s plan to distance himself was working, but he still felt a pang of sadness when his friends forgot about him.
“I’ll miss you, Harry. Thanks for the help this year.” She smiled up at him, and Harry grinned back at her.
Once the feast was completed, Snape once again stood up.
Draco watched Harry throughout his entire speech, and could not help sharing the raven-hair boys enthusiasm. He went to every session so far because he enjoyed watching Harry while helping the first years; Harry looked less sad, talked without prompting, and was invested. The boy that tutored the first years was a very different boy from the one at the beginning of the year. Harry had even started talking to the other Slytherins and Longbottom; Pansy and Zabini often encouraged the conversation, and neither had mentioned their plan in weeks.
Nor will his heir be the last
She snorted at the comment about being jealous, but then smiled softly at Harry. “Right after we leave the train, if that’s alright.”
“Ok, are they here already?”
Harry grabbed the new stack and silently figured out how to avoid mixing up the applications. Severus nodded at him, and Harry knew he had been dismissed. If this was how much work he would be receiving on the first day, Harry was already starting to regret accepting the Deputy Headmaster position.
Harry was furious, and sick by the betrayal. He wanted to yell, break things, and cry. He knew that wouldn’t help right now, and he still had unanswered questions.
Both Draco and Yatin glared at the dark-skinned wizard.
"Are you sure? Mum had the idea that we should let you be and take your own time. I thought it was rubbish of course. I think you've had more than enough happen for someone to acknowledge what you've been through."
He doesn't know how long he sits there with his eyes squeezed closed, trying to shut the image of his uncle out of his mind. The senses slowly come back to him. When he's finally aware of what's happening his face is stuffed into the crook of Remus's neck where the smell of old parchment and smoke fill his nose. There's a gentle hand on his back rubbing soothing circles in a way that reminded him the way he used to jealousy watch parents calm their children down crying on the streets. The thought pricks his sore eyes.
"It's
"Listen here Malfoy. One more racist comment from you and you're on the streets, okay?"
"Not until I get breakfast!"
"You're the one to talk."
"We'll just tell Dumbledore-"
Harry was frustrated. He always was with Malfoy around, but this time was different. It wasn't just because his insult had reached a little too far this time, it was because just for a tiny sliver of a moment he thought he saw some good in his classmate. Apparently, he was mistaken.
Looking at the house you would never expect to find anything inside other than a perfect family. The house was tall and narrow, perhaps only twelve feet wide at the front, but it stretched some thirty feet back like a giant shoebox. It was two stories high and had a one-story extension at the rear for the kitchen. The wooden framed sash windows had no light emitting from them as far as he could see.   A small rose garden had been planted in front carefully planned and loved, though he doubted any of the inhabitants had done any real work on it.
"That you don't? I think you can answer that yourself. Why would he accept a traitor," his eyes cut into Draco and then back to Pansy, "who doesn't know when they should pick a side and stick to it."
staring
Draco's hand flew to his wand and his eyes snapped to his godfather's."You wouldn't. You can't risk your position."
He knew Harry couldn't help him if they wanted to keep the whole thing a secret, but the couldn't deny the deep ache that went through his chest when Harry didn't move to stop them. It was stupid, he knew. It almost wished he could go back into the emotional stupor he once locked himself in.
"Like what you see?" Harry mumbled out. Draco nearly choked on thin air. He probably looked like a pop-eyed goldfish with how wide his eyes went.  He quickly regained himself though, coughing as if nothing happened.
Harry didn't know why Malfoy was so suddenly concerned about his health. It wasn't like it was affecting him. He figured the only reason Malfoy dragged him out of that house in the first place was to save his own arse. Did he actually care about what happened to him? Dumbledore knew yet had to help him. (Part of the reason he felt he deserved it. If the greatest wizard of all time did nothing, there had to be some reason for his suffering.) Even Ron to some extent. So why did Draco?
"Are you okay?"
Harry finds himself smiling too against all odds. This 'getting along' thing was weird and new but he definitely wasn't complaining. Sure, he had to fight back insults sometimes but that was out of habit, not spite. The more they would sit together in silence he found himself
Draco nodded. "That I do, ma'am."
"Yeah, it's sort of a given part of the name." Harry rolls his eyes and unconsciously tries to move his hair to hide his scar. It did happen to catch his attention there did seem to be more eyes on him than usual. Even some of his own classmates were giving him funny looks. They weren't bad exactly and he took that as a good sign. His first thought was something else had come out in the Prophet he was yet to be informed about.
Finally, Harry's head pops out with a small grin. He was holding a rope and a small step stool in either hand.  He briefly handed them to Draco as he relocked the shed to erase any evidence they were there.
His feet gave out from underneath him. Had it not been for Blasie's quick reflexes to catch him he would have easily fallen on his arse. Draco's face turned a very subtle shade of pink.
Harry had talked under his breath so no one would question their conversation. Draco shifted uncomfortably on their bench, crossing his arms over his chest. Harry noted he still had his sleeves pulled down despite the heat. Again, Ron and Hermione's suspicion snuck its way into his brain.
Basie rolled his eyes and cast a quick scourgify on all of them. The book was beyond repair. "If you wanted to get into her knickers that bad Draco all you would have to do is ask nicely. No need to take the extra steps."
"A side effect. The feeling differs on the caster. Another reason you couldn't learn the spell yourself. It requires more than one magical core."
He coughed into his elbow. His heart was rattling in his chest, messing up the pattern of his breathing. This had happened enough times since his last fit at Remus's house to know it he could easily make it through it. It wasn't fatal or anything. It just bothered him he couldn't even walk upstairs anymore. He needed a cure and
He roll his eyes.
She walks out of the room and a sound of relief escapes him. She didn't check the chore list.

"No, really-"
think-"
AhhhhHHHH sorry this chapter looks longer I just didn't want to write :) Also, I have no clue how consistent chapters are going to be for a while as I start online school on the 24th and I'm dreadful at it. Wish me good luck :/
Potter came busting through the door minutes later with a pant. He turned around quickly and locked the door behind him. He hadn't even had time to take his hand off the nob when someone tried to yank it open from the other side. It was obvious that he was being chased.
Written at the top, Hartley had marked it as “Dreadful” and then wrote,
Harry knocked on the door and heard a silky voice say, “Come in.” Snape sat behind the Headmaster’s desk and regarded Harry with cool, assessing eyes. Harry shut the door behind him and walked to the desk, warily. “Sit, Potter.” Harry sat down and wondered if Snape would start or end with saying that Harry was attention-seeking, or would he sneer at Harry and say he wasn’t worthy of having Lily’s eyes. After an intense stare-off, Snape finally spoke.
Either Ron or Hermione was almost constantly with Harry, but they tried to make it seem like they weren’t babysitting him; Harry knew he should be angry about it, but all he felt was the numbness that settled over him after his birthday celebration. Hermione had forced Harry to see a Mind Healer, but the bitch had told The Daily Prophet about the visit. Luckily Harry had barely talked, since every detail of their session was splashed on the front page of the paper the next day. That had been the last time Hermione suggested a Mind Healer, but he knew she was researching other ways to help Harry’s mental health. Harry forced himself to get out of bed every couple of days, so his friends didn’t hover as much. He didn’t know if the numbness that barely let any emotion go through his mind was obvious, but thought it probably was since Hermione and Ron always looked worried for him.
“He grew up here, apparently. He fled to the States during the First Wizarding War with his wife, Lily.” Severus looked up sharply.
That I’m going to meet
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco and Harry talk, and Ron apologizes to Harry.
Merlin, he was as bad as Severus was when he was in school.
“Hey, Hermione, will you join us? I have something I want to ask you about.” Granger looked shocked, but very relieved. She nodded with a huge smile on her face, and Draco knew that she was about to become a regular member of their friend group. Draco took the seat next to Pansy and said a quiet word of thanks to Longbottom.
Merlin, did Hermione sound that snooty when she asked the same question their first year? Suddenly it clicked for Harry, Patricia had a mixture of Ron and Hermione’s attitudes, but dialed up to eleven. Damn, if their future children acted like Patricia he might not accept the role of Godfather.
“I know that,” Potter sounded frustrated, “but you’re a bloody good flyer. I know that three out of five of the people interested in a chaser position are awful flyers. Please be a chaser for the team, I know you're decent at it.” Draco sighed as he remembered that he went and played with Potter, Blaise, Pansy, Thomas, and Longbottom on Saturday.
The next room will be occupied by Thomas, Malone, and Goldstein.
He slipped into the bed by Draco, who rolled over and brushed his bangs away from his face. Harry grabbed his husband’s hand and thought of telling him about the phone call. Draco had seen Harry at his lowest, and always wanted to help him before another plummet. Harry kissed his husband’s hand, and let it fall. There was no reason to bother Draco with this, as it was unlikely to cause further issues.
Harry blushed at Hermione’s look. Right, she had faced her memory modified parents after she had erased their memories for their protection.
Harry still couldn’t move his head to look at her, or any part of his body. The feeling of uselessness was too strong, and made it impossible to do more than blink. He heard Hermione sigh, and then felt her sit down on the bed beside him.
James heartily shook Severus’s hand.
“One by one, you all will come up and grip the doorknob. The door will remember your magical signature and only allow this group and myself entrance into the rooms. Hurry up now.” Snape sneered, in a bad mood for whatever reason.
“I know it seems insane, but nobody else really wanted the position that would help. Also, when he gave out the punishment, it seemed like it made sense. Snape does hate children, so it would be a punishment. The Minister made sure that Snape wouldn’t be able to bully the students anymore, and he can’t show favoritism.”
“So yeah to condense it, Draco and I have been tutoring a group of first years in Defense Against the Dark Arts for a few weeks, and Snape wants us to extend it to every year. He also wants us to start a group for the core classes that every first through fifth year is required to take. None of you have to help, but I wanted to ask if you guys wanted to.”
“Tomorrow. I will be spending time with my mother tonight.” Harry nodded and laid his head down on Draco’s shoulder. He knew the blonde boy would be moving in that night as well, but he had to tell Narcissa this afternoon. Harry had offered to go with Draco, but was relieved when Draco declined. The group chatted easily, and easily greeted their friends when they walked into the room. Ron was the last person to walk down, and then grinned at them.
“Perfect. Blaise?”
“You are quite literally your own house, and as such will be permitted to qualify for the House Cup, although there will be a significant disadvantage. Since this is a temporary measure, I will be the head of your house. Now, onto the matter of Quidditch, if there are not enough people who would like to play then we won’t have a team, but if there is a team, we will be entered into the Quidditch Cup. The Quidditch captain will be, as much as it pains me, Harry Potter; speak to him if you want to potentially join/try-out depending on the interest of your chosen position. Your Prefects are Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger. Any questions?”
Draco had just placed his bag down in the library when Potter walked in and made his way towards Draco’s seat. He had been sitting with Draco everyday for the last week and a half, since the day after Draco had found Potter with his wrist bleeding. Potter now only went to the abandoned classroom every few nights instead of every night, but Draco knew the moment he didn’t follow, Potter would make an attempt at his own life again.
Draco gave her a glare. "That wasn't me."
He looked up without moving his head to glance up at Draco. He'd be lying if he said he didn't expect Draco to start breaking down. Last night he looked so incredibly fragile, almost as if you could bown a leaf at him and he'll shatter. It was eye-opening, really. This was a whole new side of Draco that Harry didn't think anyone had ever seen before. He felt honored but also great a responsibility not to break it.
Bramble had taught him that. Now she was dead because of him.
"Harry?"
. Was is what happened in the hallway the other day?"
"Are you out of your
your fault. You had no idea so don't start blaming yourself." Poppy ridiculed Remus. "Besides, I haven't seen anything like it before... how long has this been going on Mr. Weasley?"
"Oh come on you can't back out now! Voldermort-"
"You have to with people like you trying to steal them at every chance they get." Draco picks up the bag off the floor and shoves in between the sheet cushions behind him. Harry groans something and justice and slimy gits causing the blonde to snort.
Why?"
Harry holds his arm to the light, his skin ghostly in the glow of the moon. On each arm, there are great purple welts that will only deepen over the coming week. Bruises and cuts were scattered across his abdomen like a disease. The worst of it was on his back. There were years worth of scaring hidden underneath the freshly made gashes and swelling.
Harry became skeptical. But Draco's grin was contagious and he soon found the tips of his lips turning upward as well. "Oh?"
"The thestrals I mean."
Draco narrowed his eyes and looked away. He hated him. So much. "That's not even the point of this conversation."
Published: 7/21/19
"I just. . ."
"What did the Weasel and m- Granger say?"
Harry shifts awkwardly. Draco was without a doubt upset, Harry just didn't know what to say to make it better or if he should even continue on at all. Harry knew first hand what kind of thought process was going through. He logically knew that the Durselys hated him, but that didn't mean it didn't hurt when he was humiliated time after time.
Despite the increasingly gloomy atmosphere, Draco grinned. "A grindlewick always returns back to the shepherd you pitch it to."
Near the very base of the tree there was a clear patch of grass where he sat down, not caring the slightest if his trousers were to get dirty. He digs his fingers into it and pulled up random clumps to keep the storm behind his eyes at bay.
"Out of some slim chance, he reciprocated."
"Mishap? Malfoy are dense? Your father-"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry may be dumb, but he wasn't stupid. It was fairly easy to put together the pieces.
Remus laid a hand on her shoulder. "Poppy. Maybe you should let him explain first?"
"No, you're bloody well not. You always say and you aren't. I'm sick of it. Even last year you refused to get help. Excuse me if I don't trust you to get help for yourself anymore."
"Yes. One of those things."
he care so much? He was putting himself at risk just by being here. He could have just left as soon as he got Potter to safely yet he hadn't. If he was being honest with himself, he could have even alerted the Deatheaters to Potter's location if he wanted too. His father would even be proud of him for once.
Chasers: Draco Malfoy, Dean Thomas, and Abby Runcorn
For the results will be tragic
“He couldn’t remember why he left. Apparently his childhood and time at Hogwarts was fuzzy, but it started clearing up seven years ago.” Harry looked grim, and saw that Severus’s eyes widened.
He was surprised to hear footsteps coming in shortly after Draco’s, and looked up to see Lily walk in. She waved at them, and was also already dressed for the day. She never woke up this late, as Ollivander required her to be at his shop before sunrise. She was enjoying her apprenticeship already, and Harry was happy for her. She took a seat at the table with the food Kreacher and Dobby had made. Shortly after her, Pansy walked down, and Harry was stunned. Pansy never woke up this early, and Harry started wracking his brain for the reason she was already up. Neville and Blaise walked in right behind Pansy, which made Draco raise his eyebrow at the pair; Neville predictably blushed and Blaise grinned.
Ida nodded and hurried out of the Library. Draco watched Harry with an unreadable expression, which Harry raised his eyebrow at. “What?”
Since I last sat
“You know, the last people to comfort me like this were probably my parents. The Dursleys despised me and it would be too awkward for my friends to do this.”
After saying her piece, Pansy spun around and stormed down the corridor. Blaise and Nevill spared a glance at him, then followed her. Draco knew he deserved every bit of his friend’s ire. He walked down away from Hartley’s classroom, then buried his face in his hands, and breathed deeply to push the feelings away. After he collected himself, he rushed to look for Harry hoping it wasn’t too late.
“Draco, I’m so sorry for the late notice, but Andrew, the sixth year that was going to take the Charms session, had something urgent come up. Will you be able to take the session? It starts in twenty minutes.”
It was locked, but Hermione unlocked it with a quick
“He protected her because it was the right thing to do, Ron. She didn’t see the curse in time, and who knows what would have happened had it connected.” Ron’s ears reddened at Neville’s statement and mumbled something. Neville then asked Harry and Ron, “Want to find a compartment, guys? Luna will be joining us too, I think.” Harry and Ron nodded, waved at the Weasley’s, and followed Neville onto the train. Hermione would probably join them, but she had to go to the Prefect cabin first.
“Listen mate, I’m not going to pretend to like that you’re dating Malfoy, that you spend so much time with the Slytherins, or that I trust them. But we haven’t talked in months, except for Quidditch practices. You’re my best mate, and if this is making you happy, which I honestly didn’t believe to be a possibility a few months ago, then I’ll deal with it. I’m sorry for being a prat these last few months, and I wish it wasn’t always me ruining our friendship by reacting poorly.”
Ron couldn’t believe that Harry had just apparated being so emotional. He cursed and looked at his family. They were all shocked and pale, and Ron was sure he looked like that too. He summoned a blood replenishing potion, sure that his best mate had splinched himself. Then he apparated to number 12 Grimmauld Place, with Hermione following close behind him.
Charms
“How do you know, Mione? Harry has been acting really strange for the last few months!” Weasley’s face had almost turned the same colour as his hair. Granger stared incredulously at Weasley, and the rest of the room broke out into loud conversation. The door opened, and everyone stopped talking. Harry had walked through the doorway with a small smile that dropped off his face when he surveyed the scene.
It is our pleasure to inform you that you have been approved to come to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for an optional “8th” year, as last year’s studies were interrupted. We strive to give everyone the opportunity to receive their N.E.W.T.S. after actually being taught for a school year with no interruptions or dark intentions. We understand if you are hesitant to come back, but rest assured that every precaution has been put in place to make the school safe. We have also rebuilt the castle, with some adjustments, since part of the castle was damaged in the battle. Please owl us back whether you would like to attend by no later than July 31st, so we can appropriately prepare for the additional year of students. Enclosed is a list of your supplies.
“My throat,” was all he could manage to get out. She raised her eyebrows at him and ushered him to a bed, where she ran a medical diagnosis on him. She took a sharp breath and looked at him, which made him look out a window. She then performed a quick wand movement and the soreness of throat and body disappeared; she walked away and came back with a blood-replenishing potion.
“Ok, that’s fine. You said almost every year, how many years weren’t you targeted?”
“No, I’m afraid I don’t.” She gazed at him with narrowed eyes, seemingly debating with herself if she should continue, even though she was the one to start the conversation. She finally gave a short nod, and sat across from him.
Harry nodded at Ron, and revealed the last bit of information, “James is going to be taking over for McGonagall this year. His other kids are going to attend Hogwarts for the year, as well.”
“Why? If they choose not to learn their past, then the money is rightfully yours,” Draco pointed out, probably thinking he was helping.
“They forgot to feed the prisoners sometimes, so I snuck them food. The first time I wasn’t careful, and was punished by my aunt then the Dark Lord a few days later. She had heard me being punished, and decided the next times I brought food were braver than they were.”
Taking one last look at himself, he apparated to St. Mungo’s to collect Draco; when he and Severus had accepted the dinner invitation, Harry asked if he could bring Draco along as well. He walked up to the office Draco shared with two other healers, and was surprised to see his husband choosing a tie.
Harry had to be imagining it, but he could have sworn Snape’s lips twisted up into amusement without the usual cruelty, “Indeed. I did not help inter-house unity as a Professor, but I am trying to redeem myself. I appreciate your pledge to help inter-house unity, Mr. Potter. There is one last matter I wish to discuss with you, which is your reluctance to join the school in the Great Hall. It might be beneficial for the school, and your classmates, to see you sitting next to Mr. Malfoy, however I believe your absence stems from a deeper issue. I know that Mr. Malfoy regularly asks Dobby to bring you food three times a day, but I also know you do not always eat.”
“Ok, well it seems like you're unwilling to talk more about that either. What do you want to talk about for the remainder of the session?”
“Fuck. How?” Blaise asked, with murder in his eyes.
“Snape doesn’t know me or like me; I don’t know his actual motive, but it can’t be a good one.”
“Honestly, you three, do you think I agree with his decision to keep those people out of Azkaban? No, but there’s nothing we can do about it now. He’s gone through enough, so we shouldn’t hold his decision against him. We’re the closest thing he has to family, and you need to let it go.” Mrs. Weasley’s voice was harsh, but Harry felt numb that even Mrs. Weasley hated him because he testified for the kids their age and Mrs. Malfoy.
Harry looked at Blaise in shock because he was absolutely sure that he was really good at hiding his infatuation with Draco. He had been hiding it from himself for awhile. Harry thought about saying something over Blaise’s obvious infatuation with Neville, but he didn’t think the Slytherin would be embarrassed.
“But it’s not my first bad grade, Potter. Ever since you started dominating even more of my limited free time, my grades have been slipping.”
“Oh, brilliant! Yes this is a good time. Just give me a second to move to a quieter area.” Harry squinted at the phone. How did the man have a English accent instead of an American one? And why did he sound vaguely familiar? “Sorry about that. You said your name was Harry Potter?”
They get to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.
Then the summer was used to build and restore
She hummed noncommittally and said, “Yeah, well he could have easily said no. I heard Hartley was a bigger dick than Snape when he was a professor, so Malfoy should not have been so upset to “lose his cool” bad enough to cause you to almost relapse.”
Harry started walking again with Draco comforting him and keeping the terrible thoughts away from the forefront of his mind. The whispered encouragements continued all the way to the eighth year table and Draco never removed his hand. Harry sat down with Draco on one side and Hermione on the other side with Neville, Blaise, and Pansy sitting across from them. Nobody said anything for the first few moments after sitting down before Harry blurted out, “Do you really think I’m gorgeous, Draco?”
“We will unfortunately need to remove the charms more quickly than expected, Mrs. Waller. The deterioration has progressed more rapidly than what should be possible.”
“Perfect Potter finally found something that he couldn’t breeze through,” Draco’s face was warm and Harry rolled his eyes at the teasing.
“No, sir.”
“That’s why I fear accepting the Hogwarts Healer position with Severus as the headmaster. He does not accept less than the best, and will never settle.” Draco crossed into the room and rubbed Harry’s tense shoulders. “Don’t forget that Teddy is coming over for a sleepover tomorrow, and Aunt Andromeda will probably drop him off in the morning.” Harry groaned; he had forgotten. “I’ll be at Mundo’s for the majority of the day, but I can bring dinner.”
“So them starting to remember vague details, prompting them to try and force their memories to return, is extremely dangerous?”
The next night Draco walked into the common room exhausted after his Astronomy lesson, but he had work to make up from the two hours he missed by having Quidditch try-outs, so he couldn’t go to sleep for another few hours. He also had to re-work his timetable to fit in a three hour practice every week and games. Draco wanted to rap his head against a wall a few times, but he had no time for that. He also didn’t have time for Potter walking into the common room, this time without his cloak, and walking straight towards Draco.
“Excellent. Sorry, but I didn’t catch the Headmaster’s name?” Severus cleared his throat.
Draco winced. They ate in silence until Lily came home, and they quickly tried to cover the somber mood. She was smarter than that, though, but she didn’t ask what was going on. Harry knew no matter what happened concerning his parents, he would always have this family made up of his spouse and friends. He would never be alone with just the Dursleys again.
He worried about who else would be going as he walked to where the owls were staying. He expected Granger would be going, but he knew Potter and Weasley had been offered a position in the Auror Training Program. Since it was both of their ambitions to be Aurors, he expected he wouldn’t see either of them and that would be a relief.
Draco stared at the essay he had just been handed back in despair; he could not believe it, he looked again to verify his initial glance had been correct. He felt pure misery bubble up inside him. He watched his hopes and dreams fall apart as the last little bit of hope left him. He could not stand to look at the essay, but he could not look away.
Potter laughed softly at that, but it trailed off as sudden as it started. “That was my first time laughing since before…” Harry, no Potter, didn’t need to finish his sentence for Draco to understand; what Draco didn’t understand was the feeling in his stomach when Harry, shit Potter, admitted that Draco made him laugh for the first time in months. Draco cursed himself, he had a childish crush on the Saviour before he met Harry Potter, and then ruthlessly squashed the crush when the prat refused his handshake. He could not start crushing on the Golden Boy again.
“What can I do to help, Harry? I’m concerned about you; you’re my best friend, and you’re not taking care of yourself. Kreacher told me that you haven’t eaten anything in three days, haven’t left your room in that time, and haven’t said anything since last week.”
“Then the bugger flew up Hutchinson’s nose!”
“What’s the talk around the Ministry?”
“He helped look for you, but when we received word of where you were, he left. We don’t know where he went.” Harry nodded quietly, but on the inside he was screaming.
“I believe it is going very well, but we could use a few more tutors.”
It broke his heart to say no, but the small break now would be much better than the complete break that would happen if it was too dangerous for James and Lily to ever remember him.
“Yes, I do know,” Harry sighed deeply. “Well you know how Severus had me go through some of the CV’s for the temporary professor position? One of them was a man from the United States named James Waller. When I interviewed him, I had the wild suspicion that he was my father. I convinced myself I was wrong, but then Severus and I called him. I wasn’t wrong. Dumbledore found a way to protect a person from the killing curse. He used the charm on my parents and then hid them in the United States all these years.”
Harry ran down the corridor feeling tears cascade down his face, a lump in his throat that made it difficult for him to catch his breath, and his heart continuously shattering from the argument he had with Draco. His thoughts were racing around his mind wildly, making it difficult for him to focus on one. He ran without direction, without seeing his surroundings, without care for his fellow students that were surely around him. He ran and ran.
His family was one of the last to go before the Wizengamot, and he was sure that they would all spend the rest of their lives in one of those cells. Then the Saviour himself walked into the courtroom and testified for both Draco and his mother. Potter had apparently spoken at each of the trials of students in Hogwarts to ensure they would only get probation and community service, but never deigned to vouch for someone with the mark or old enough to make their own decisions. He testified for both of them and that was what got them five years probation and community service, although they got more than the rest of the people who stayed out of Azkaban. His father was sentenced to life in Azkaban, and Draco thought it was too easy of a punishment.
“I understand. I wish I could promise that I won’t kill myself, but I’m not supposed to be alive. Nothing anyone can say or do will change that, and until I die, the universe will be unbalanced.”
“Don’t kill yourself.” Potter looked up in surprise at this.
I don't intend to Ginny, George, or Percy bash, but I feel like they would be angry over Harry testifying for the Malfoy's. They won't be at Hogwarts for a couple more chapters, sorry.
“Congratulations! Not to trample your news, but Lily Moon, she’s mine and Draco’s surrogate for the first go-around, is pregnant too. We just found out yesterday too.” Harry laughed lightly, he was ecstatic over the news. Severus’s smile widened fractionally, but Harry knew if the man showed emotion like a regular person he would be beaming.
“Yes.”
“Ah, my wife Lily; do you remember her? Anyways, she works for the Magical Congress of the United States of America, and her friend, who had just come back from London, had seen the posting in Diagon Alley somewhere. I teach here in Ilvermorny, but had already planned to take a year off; Lily is working for the Ministry of Magic in an exchange program this year. It was too great of a coincidence, honestly.”
“Brilliant, Luna. Do you have a list of who wants to help?”
More than anything.
“He’s mean, but he also deserves to understand our lessons.” She shrugged while saying this, like it was obvious.
“Potter, if any of the contents of this discussion I divulge to you becomes common knowledge amongst the students, I will expel you for causing harm to a student. That being said, I will attempt to help you, so that you are no longer a risk to yourself. I too had difficulties surrounding the war and my part in it, and I feared going to a Mind Healer that would accept the Dark Mark would warrant a similar occurrence to the one you endured during the summer. So I researched Muggle Psychologists and found an American woman who practices in London, and after a few appointments accidentally said something unmistakably magical; which is how I learnt this American woman was a squib. She does not wish to involve herself with the magical world, so your secrets are safe with her. She has been an immense help to me since I do not need to hide magical elements but she will not betray my trust, and has agreed to see you. I have set an appointment to start in ten minutes. Do you have the banking card that automatically exchanges Wizard money to Muggle money?”
“Does it count as a family dinner if your family doesn’t know they are your family?”
“Yes Draco, you should have said something, but you’re beating yourself up too much.”
Lily gave a short humourless laugh at the end of her sentence, she looked unbearably sad. He felt a pang of guilt as he thought of the girl in his year and house that died without him even knowing her.
Harry was looking at Draco’s Potion’s homework with fondness and slight annoyance. “Must you always be doing homework, Draco? You already have high marks, the highest other than Hermione.”
Harry could not believe what he was hearing, so he blurted the only thing he could think of, “Draco and I aren’t dating.”
Warning: Description of finding Harry's suicide attempt.
“You too, Ginny.” She nodded and walked back to the Gryffindor table. Harry reached the eighth year’s table and looked at Ron, who was frowning while staring at Ginny. He looked over to Harry when Hermione elbowed him, and Harry smiled at his oldest friend. Harry hoped that Ginny’s acknowledgement meant that he would be able to salvage his relationship with the Weasley’s; he desperately wanted to talk to Mrs. Weasley and explain this past year, he felt she deserved that at least.
Draco rushed back to the common room after Snape’s discussion with his thoughts swirling around his head. Harry was taking up more time than he could afford to give, but Draco did not regret a second spent with Harry. His grades were still second best in most subjects, and he had actually out-performed Granger in Potions during their last class. It had taken quite a bit of restraint to not rub it in Granger’s face, but he had remained civil even when Weasley had loudly whispered to Granger about Draco probably cheating. Granger had thrown many concerned glances at Harry during the last month and a half because the Saviour had stopped sitting with his best friends in favour of sitting with Draco. Draco didn’t think Weasley had noticed his best mate’s absence for a few weeks, but when he did realize that Harry had apparently abandoned them for the Slytherins, his hostility had grown.
“I don’t know how many times, but I found him once. I asked Kreacher to tell me if he tried again, but he hasn’t since that time. It was almost a month ago.” Ron noticed she didn’t apologize for not telling him, and he pushed down his annoyance. He probably wouldn’t have told her either, had the positions been reversed.
“Hullo, Draco. Thanks for bringing us food, even after your aunt hurt you. We heard your screams for hours after the first time.” Draco felt his cheeks blush at the blunt honesty of this girl, and his throat closed up. He nodded and looked out the window to avoid the girl’s penetrating stare. He didn’t deserve her thanks, he was just acting like a human should;
Harry was quiet for a spell. “I don’t think it’s silly,” he whispered. He cleared his throat as he watched Lily close her eyes. “Why do you use Muggle slang?”
He bowed his head and sighed. “You’re right, Neville. I am not taking care of myself, but I need to focus on my schoolwork to be accepted into any healing apprenticeship with my background.”
She had narrowed her eyes at the pair of them, and made her way to the stove. It was while she was cooking him lunch that she had announced the birthday celebration. She had plated his lunch when she finished telling him about the birthday plans. Harry ate a couple of bites and told her thanks, but it was unnecessary; then he asked her about Ron when she started worrying over his health.
“Absolutely love.” Merlin, why could he not be honest and say how much time Harry was taking?
“What is this for?”
Draco waved off Harry’s comment; true he could barely afford adding another thing, but he wasn’t going to not help Harry when the boy was excited about something. “I find that helping others study, helps my own studying.”
“Well you still need to be alive to accept the apprenticeship. Talk to Harry, quit one of the activities you’re doing for him; he won’t be upset.”
“Draco, it’s not that bad. It’s your first bad grade of the year, you’ll recover.” Draco let out a mirthless laugh.
“I do not know, but I think the situation is more dire than previously expected.”
“Last I checked, Draco has never mentioned my blood status, treats me very fairly on the team, and has helped me with some of my Charms homework. Who cares what he was forced to do during a war none of us had a choice in living through?”
“That’s not healthy. You need to eat at least once a day, especially if you’re going to be playing Quidditch. I’ve read articles detailing the importance of eating, I’ll share them with you.” Draco reached into his bag and pulled out the Muggle health magazine he subscribes to. “There is actually a fascinating article about it in this issue.”
“Think about it.” Harry leaned over and kissed his boyfriend again.
You may think some are to blame
“Of course I’m sure. Can we please start working on being ok?”
Ron watched as Harry’s face paled, and tried to pull his best mate out of earshot. There was no use, even with Hermione helping. After Ginny declared she wasn’t keen on forgiving Harry, Harry started shaking. He didn’t think Harry knew his magic burned Ron’s hand that was gripping Harry’s arm, but Ron had no choice to let go. Harry bolted outside, and Ron, Hermione, Charlie, Mum, and Dad all yelled for him. Ron watched Bill ask what was happening. Harry fell into the grass, and Ron put his hand on Harry’s back. Harry stood up quickly and disappeared with a loud crack.
“I would expect you to ponder such a monumental decision, Potter.” Harry felt his cheeks burn at the tone in Snape’s voice. Harry nodded, and Snape dismissed him with a wave of his hand.
“Sue you’re a Muggle-Born! How can you be defending the Death Eater?” This came from Dean Thomas who had started standing next to Hopkins.
He was wrong. Luna Lovegood climbed into the carriage, and Draco froze. He felt his mouth dry and his blood run cold; he hadn’t hurt the odd girl while she was imprisoned in his manor, but he felt responsible for her suffering. He remembered when she had been there for two days without being fed, and Draco had decided to sneak into the kitchens and steal some food. She thanked him with her dreamy voice when he slid the food in, and told them to hurry. He went back upstairs, where an elf was standing next to his Aunt Bellatrix; the elf was in tears and terrified. Draco knew he would suffer, but didn’t know how bad. He had endured the cruciatus curse before, but never so many in a row spread out over such a long time. He still wonders how he didn’t lose his mind from it.
James pointed at each child in turn, and the group introduced themselves to everyone. The entire time Harry’s mind was racing. The group finally headed into the restaurant, but Severus and Harry hung back. They turned to each other, and both had a grimace on their face.
Harry rolled his eyes; at least Severus was being sort of fair with his anger these days.
James and Lily greeted the room, and Harry smiled shakily at them. Harry’s attention was directed away from them when he heard a squeak and crash; looking over he saw that Filius had fallen out of his chair. Severus had told the Charms professor nearly every detail, but the shock of seeing two “dead” people was apparently too great for the wizard. Hermione helped him up, and Severus arched his eyebrow at the display.
Into fighting with the other houses
“Most live here, but the only professors required to live here are the Head of Houses. No, there are no previous requirements to be a professor; it was one of the things I hope to change.” Harry nodded.
Now Harry was trying to help the Weasley’s set up for the small gathering for his birthday, but Mrs. Weasley kept sending him to sit down while glancing at him. He wasn’t sure how he looked, but considering the most exercise he had done in over a month was walking from his room to the kitchen, he was probably a bit peaky. Hermione looked like she wanted to talk to him, but she hadn’t approached him yet. Ron, who Harry had not seen since Remus and Tonks funeral, kept shooting worried glances at him; Harry looked away when he caught Ron staring. Ginny, George, and Percy seemed to be ignoring him, but Harry didn’t know why so he thought he must be imagining it. Charlie and Bill were friendly enough to him, and laughed when Fleur tried fussing over Harry, which he was sure made his face flush.
"Potter?" He yelps. Harry's breathing was labored and his face was blood red. He leaned against the wall in support of his wobbly legs. Slowly, he slid all the way down until he was sitting with his head between his knees and arms cradling his head.
"Believe it or not Potter, I'm not a complete ignorant prat. I know when there are boundaries and when or when I haven't crossed them. You just happened to be passed that point."
"Oi! What the fuck?"
a tradition for Blacks to learn, his mother had given him the choice. It was the first time he'd ever been given control over his life. The most important thing out of everything in the room though was the dingy, oak muggle guitar. One of his most prized possessions. He'd traded a muggle street artist his entire pouch of galleons for it when he was fourteen and on vacation. He picked it up knowing his parents would be furious if they found out in a rebellious funk like the way a normal teenager would smoke or drink.
Draco held his breath. There were at least one or two bruised ribs he could see. Some of the cuts looked like they were affected as well. His ankle could be broken yet he couldn't be sure yet.
Harry didn't know how to answer that question. The answer was obviously
Ginny sat her book down on the table next to Harry. "Harry was a nervous wreck about the game tomorrow and decided he needed to stay behind in the pouring rain to play an extra couple seeker drills."
It was a broad question. Enough for Harry to become picky with his words in fear Draco would recoil back into himself again. "You didn't come last night."
"Really?" Harry sighed. How did Dumbledore ever expect someone to meet him if he didn't know the password beforehand? He didn't even
He walked back to the window in an injured grunt. His shin and ankle were still badly bruised from the night before along with some of his arms and chest. There were also many more before that but he decided to put those thoughts away for the time being. You didn't see a falling star that often. It was quite the once in a lifetime event.
hi this absolutely trash
since she can't very much go in herself being an Azkaban escapee. Dumbledore thinks if we can track one of them down we might be able to locate her. With her gone, it would be a devastating blow."
"You're the one who suggested the idea of keeping everything a secret! And someone just saw me without a shirt on with
"Y..You.." He says between bursts of laughs wheezing. It wasn't doing anything for his sore ribs but he just couldn't help himself. "Merlin's beard, you look like pouting six-year-old.."
Draco's brows furrowed. "What do you mean? The Festival of Wonder is what both called it."
It was only seconds later after the brunet took it did he notice the burning comet soaring over both of their heads.
He takes Draco's hand though who helped lead him towards his room.
"It's not my fault. One would
Remus looks up surprised to hear Harry speak badly of his headmaster. "I
He knew he didn't deserve Harry's forgiveness. He had done so much to warrant his hatred, so what did he do to warrant his apology?
Draco scoffed and turned away. "Right. I would keep listening to Potty there; you can join the team if you'd like. A change of attire will be necessary." He waved his hand at his hand-me-down robes. "We even have showers. You know, those things that clean people?"
Holy shit guys, thank you so much for 1k followers. Thats crazy.
Harry had never said the words out loud before. Nor had he ever talked to anyone about Cedric other than Ron and Hermione either. It felt strange and he didn't know whether he enjoyed the weighted that crumbled off his shoulders with it.
Harry gave a small nod. Remus stood up where he was crouching slightly and gave him a genuine smile. He messes up Harry's hair again.
He knew where he was before he even opened his eyes. The hospital wing was practically his home at this point.
Harry's throat closes up. The eye contact quickly becomes unbearable and Harry stares at his hands tapping on his thigh instead.
. I couldn't... I had to..."
Draco's head whips around fast. There's a mix of pain and anger in his fiery, narrowed eyes. "Yeah I noticed asshole. You don't have to remind me."
Remus takes in a deep breath. "Yes. He knew."
"Fine."
She waltzed out of the room and into the kitchen and made her a plate of food from the platter. She barely sparred Harry a glance as she took the rest to herself and went back into her room.
Life is meaningless to him. You out all people should know that! You knew that when you took the part and you knew that when you decided to cowardly run away."
Harry leaned against the wall and breathed heavily. The steps to the top of the tower was a lot even for a person who didn't have a cursed heart on probation.
Draco struck out a hand.
Draco covers a snort of laughter with his hand. "Merlin, your reaction is priceless every time."
"No I didn't."
to fight? You shouldn't have to be thrown into this war just because some psychopath killed your parents."
On another day the words would come back to haunt him. For now, all Draco would do was let the anger and teenage angst come off him in waves. Had it been his father he would have shut up and nodded, afraid of seeing a wand at the tip of his nose. But this was Severus and while his father expected him to succeed, he'd always thought Draco was too weak. "I didn't choose for this to happen!"
He bites his lip. “I’d rather not repeat it. Or any of it really.”
Very slowly he started pulling the fabric of his thin body. It was a very tedious job as he didn't want to reawaken any old wounds. Draco had to stifle the small gasp that came from him.
"Sir, why are you telling me this exactly?"
Harry stifled a laugh. "No I didn't."
Harry hummed loopily as if the tiredness had made him go mad. "You worry too much Draco. I'm
It takes a second but it clicks. Oh.
Harry shut the water off when he heard a knock on the door. "Your clothes are cleaned, Potter. If you can consider them such."
"Fine then. Since you're too heroic to save your self, how would you think this would make others feel? What would Granger and Weasley do if they found out?"
Draco pulled up the door from the ground and headed down the twisted stairs that were in a perfect spiral like a child's slinky toy pulled from each end. They went straight to the bottom of the tower, nearly ten flights of stairs standing alone without any other rooms. He mumbled something unintelligible under his breath before hiking the bad up his shoulder and continuing down.
The Dursleys.
“Do tell me if I’m hearing this right. Did you happen to wake up in Harry Potter’s room...this morning?” Bramble chokes.

"Harry, my boy. Glad to see you unharmed."
The topic quickly escaped from there. Pansy broke off in tangents about the random school drama before Blasie was able to steer it away to Quidditch. A fight soon broke out between who would win the first quidditch game of the year between Ravenclaw and Gryffindor. Draco had no doubts who would win himself, not that he could say it without looking like a traitor (more than he already was). Harry had been placed back on the team last week when the potion was finally finished. If anyone had any questions about where the ingredients had come from, Harry certainly hadn't mentioned it yet. As far as Draco knew their secret was still in the dark.
telling me what to do."
The next wave of nausea that hit him was so intense that they hardly made it to the toilet bowl before Harry emptied his stomach. Porcelain clashed with olive green which only made more vomit stream from his mouth. Vomiting was already a nasty thought but actually seeing it only made it worse. It burst from his throat, practically choking him.
Draco didn't look up from rubbing a hand across the thestrals snout. "Why?"
“You would know if you let me finish,” Bramble scolded.
"I've been meaning too, just-"
Confronting the phaseless? Check.
"Harry?"
A panic attack. That's what Draco had called them. '
"I'm right here, Potter. Just breathe."
His vision is dazed. A shaky hand reached upwards where red crimson was leaking from both his nostrils. He had no doubt the back of his head was receiving the same treatment.
"She's alive," breathed Draco. "She was alive. I should have expected as much but..."
He grabbed the soap and furiously started scrubbing his body until his skin felt rubbed raw. He knew he was free of them, for now at least, but that didn’t stop him from wanting to remove every trace they ever existed from his skin. Sadly, a bar of soap wasn’t going to be able to do everything. Too many bruises and scars littered his small-ish frame for it to ever return back to normal.
"Stop asking that way. It's weird." Harry grumbles, his face burning with a faint pink over the bridge of his nose. Nevertheless, Harry pulls off his robes and unbuttons his shirt so he can see the inky mark on his stomach.
"Er- No thank you." Harry wanted him to advance and get straight to the point. The older he got the more annoying it became.
"Everyone is going to think we're bloody poofters.
He clenched his tear soaked eyes shut in pain. "Get me out of here," a small whisper leaves his trembling lips. Unbeknownst to him, a small streak of silver passes by his window and back to the abyss just as quick.
"Somehow I doubt it."
"And why exactly not? You left school grounds without permission. If I had any right of mind I would have contacted your father immediately."
Then he wished he hadn't.
Harry rapped his fingers against his thigh. He raked his head for an excuse. He briefly wondered whether Draco had had the same problem yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Remembering the other album, Harry perked up. He didn't care what condition he was in, pictures always cheered him up.
Draco tried to redirect his attention to keep Harry from feeling uncomfortable. Harry caught on anyways and looked the opposite way. Draco realized he had been waiting for a reaction.

"Information."
It was Harry's turn to be embarrassed as his eyes flew open to see what he was talking about. He glared at the other when he felt nothing there. Draco only gave a mischievous smirk back.
The house wasn't anything dramatic which was to be expected. Anything else would have been out of character. It stood on a slight rise just on the edge of a small village and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland. It wasn't by remarkable by any means - it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please. The living room was a jungle of bookcases overflowing with old fraying books, both muggle and magical alike. Papers and letters seemingly addressed to no one were piled up to the letterbox and cascaded all the way to the foot of the rough wooden stairs, old teacups laid on a coffee table looking on its last leg, and light streaming through the gaps in the cheap burgundy curtains. A part of Harry ticked to pick up a vacuum and start cleaning.
"Are we not talking about the same old, manipulative bastard? You said it yourself, Dumbledore knew exactly what was going on inside that house and despite your desperate pleas he left you there."
"You're what now?" He seems surprised by Harry's sudden action and even more so by the statement. Merlin, he was absolutely clueless when it came to anything outside the wizarding world.
Harry's face drops in surprise. "
Harry shrugs. Couldn't they see he didn't want to talk about this with them?
haha so my EOCS are (almost) over. I have one left for tomorrow but it doesn't count really.... but I have the driver's test coming up and oh boy am I going to fail. Sorry if this seems kinda rushed? I really don't know how to fix it,,,
The previous tension between the two was now gone. Though Harry would be lying if he said he still didn't feel anything between them. Until now, Harry always thought it was just because of the rivalry they had, but as he thought about it more, it was always there. Since the first day they met in the robe shop, Harry knew.
story?”
A knock at the door startles the both of them.
"You alright?"
"Bold words, Zabini. Especially seeing as you're the one who needs to keep it in their pants." Draco says, flipping the page of his textbook. He was absent-mindedly sucking on a sugar quill.
"You idiot! This is a brand new skirt!"
" Draco corrects with a glare.
"Potter, can you please remove your shirt?"
He sighed, “Partly.”
Despite the house being empty, Draco couldn't help himself to try to make his steps as quiet as possible. Nonetheless, he opened the door and tipped toed through the dark hallway. The cool banister at his fingertips as he went down down the stairs sent shivers down his back. It reminded him of the time he had tried sneaking out when the abuse first started. He had been caught and not let out of the darkened dungeons for days.  Maybe it was his paranoia, but he felt the same eyes on him as he did that night.  Fear built up in his throat.
He looked down on the book on his lap. The cover read
He could at least come up with new insults after two years. They were getting old.
Harry had to reason to himself that if they didn’t exist, he would have been long dead by now by Voldemort's supporters. Or even by the noseless bastard himself. But there were times in house whether he wondered if that was even a fair trade deal. If he was dead, surely that would be better then beat nearly every day? He would have his parents and godfather again. Hell, maybe even a loving boyfriend.
"Go on."
Draco sighed and looked out the window where the Gryfindor team was soaring above the pitch. Harry was probably one of them. He had heard Theo go on a rant about 'the bloody scarface' getting promoted to Gryffindor team captain. Draco's team had unanimously agreed to kick him from the position of seeker this year. He could find himself caring less honestly. He had too much stuff to worry about anyway.
