"I'll be heading to the Headmistress's office, then to my chambers," she added. "Considering the library's closed, you two may stay here to work together if you'd like. Certainly, you, Potter, could use Malfoy's help...I've locked the storage cupboard."
"We've been so incredibly busy, Hagrid," said Hermione earnestly.
"Didn't work though, did it?" said Malfoy. A tick pulsed in his hard jaw.
"Who would I tell, Potter?" said Malfoy, scornful. "Besides, what makes you think I care about you and the She-Weasel?"

Harry shut the book and placed it back on the shelf. It didn't tell him anything he didn't already know or, more importantly, mention the hellebore—but Malfoy had

Hermione noticed his frown.
Ron’s head snapped up. “Ginny’s with
Despite Malfoy's attitude that nothing unusual had happened, Harry couldn't help but think that something was quite different indeed. He couldn't put his finger on it—but he felt, maybe, a sort of shift between them.
The door
, Potter," came Roman's voice.
It burned in his hands.
“I’ve always read. Not that you’d know that.”
Filch threw open a wall cabinet and peered inside. Then, with a baleful glare, he scanned the empty classroom.
In the center of the room lay a vast tub the size of a small swimming pool. Decorating its perimeter were faucets of all shapes, gold and silver and shimmering.
So, if anyone were to blame when the cauldron exploded, it most definitely was
On Thursday night, the gentle pitter-patter of rain fell like scurrying mouse feet upon Gryffindor Tower. The gold clock above the mantelpiece read half-past midnight.
"Uh—can't say I did," said Harry.
shouted Harry.
And here he was now, watching Ginny turn circles from the bleachers and brooding over a certain Slytherin.
, that was impossible—
“Wouldn’t be a surprise,” said Harry darkly. His eyes searched the Slytherin table, but a certain blond head was nowhere in sight.
"Hello," said Harry uncertainly. Crookshanks curled around his feet, mewling.
At the bell, Splog waddled to the front of the room, assignments in hand, and settled comfortably in his magically enlarged armchair.
But in Malfoy’s concentration, the web had shimmered into nothing.
She's a
"But—"
Harry thrust the parchment at him. "Things aren't...so bad," he said, rather pathetically, watching Malfoy's realization form.
of fast-approaching footsteps.
“Shit,” muttered Harry. Fumbling through his bag, he pulled out his invisibility cloak (ignoring how his fingers shook) and pulled it over himself.
In all his years at Hogwarts, Harry had never heard the Baron speak. That confirmed his theory: somewhere, maybe back in that classroom with Malfoy, he'd fallen into a drug-induced sleep and was now envisioning having this very conversation.
All over, he burned; he wondered how Malfoy could stand to touch him.
The bathroom door creaked open. Hastily, Harry turned on the faucet and splashed his face. He shuddered; it was like ice on his burning skin.
“...bloody waste of time,” Malfoy was muttering quietly. “Filthy Muggle rubbish.”
“You about to recite poetry to me, Malfoy?” said Harry with a humorless laugh.
"Hi bubble," said Harry. He poked it and grinned as it started warbling what sounded like the first few bars of "A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love."
The Baron's chains clinked menacingly. Its gaze chilled something deep within Harry. Somehow, though it took tremendous effort on his part, Harry found his voice.
He smiled menacingly, and Harry thought he caught a glimmer of a fang.
“Don’t know what you mean,” muttered Harry.
"I don't know, I’ve never gotten close enough to check. Flighty bugger. Seems to like
"You wear chains, and you're dead. Surely, you're regretful. But she hasn't forgiven you." He recalled the loathing that twisted the Grey Lady's face as if it were just yesterday. "I'm not completely in control of what I'm saying at the moment," added Harry hastily.
Dimly, he was aware of Malfoy cannoning behind him. The

"I prefer 'lothario,'" replied Malfoy.
Ron grinned conspiratorially at Harry, wiggling his eyebrows in a way that Harry never cared to see again. “I just assumed it was a steamy note some bird passed Harry. Now,
The corridor was spinning again. Harry focused, hard, on remaining upright as it zoomed around him gleefully. He was the axis of a spinning globe;
The flames caught up with them. They illuminated the vast lake—and Harry saw, just below him, the golden snitch.
Warm breath ghosted his jaw, touched his throat. A lightning-swift image of Malfoy’s lips on his neck flashed through his mind.
"You're a rubbish liar, too."
Harry woke just after midnight.
"In the hospital wing, after Pomfrey healed me. After your whole speech about superiority complexes or whatever."
Ginny sighed. “Really, Harry?”
At once, sea-foam green bubbles poured from it. They jitter-bugged across the water's surface. Harry held his breath, then sunk into the bath. As soon as the top of his head breached the surface again, he felt the room shift, then right itself.
“What the
A startling
They crouched to cover their feet—just as Filch burst into the room.
Harry glanced down, noticing at once that he had slid out of Ginny. He was barely half-hard.
Even Malfoy’s palpable horror couldn’t make Harry feel any better.
“Of course, Potter.” She paused. “Well, take these, then.”
"Guess you're on your own then," he said.
Harry, realizing he'd forgotten the almond extract, made his way to the storeroom. Malfoy followed. He stood beside Harry, scanning the shelves.
Slowly, Harry sighed.
Ron and Ginny sniggered into their beans. Hermione looked on pityingly as McGonagall chased Peeves out of the Great Hall; Professors Sprout and Flitwick scrambled to catch the escaping detonators.
, thought Harry at once. The violet bolt of light rebounded on Malfoy, who leapt nimbly to the side.
Her one huge eye blinked, then Harry blinked, and Ginny looked human again.
“I was fourteen. And there was a man...”
to know,
Harry’s ears flushed, too, to match his face; his neck glowed.
. Professor Roman knocked on his desk. At once, the class fell silent.
Annoyed, the kneazle swatted Crookshanks squarely in the face.
“My biographies didn’t satisfy you?” said Harry absently.
Indeed, snow was falling gently, kissing the back of Harry’s blazing neck. Cold and wet against his skin, it trickled underneath his collar.
“Joined, of course, by Malfoy, who’ll be making up the considerable amount of coursework he’s missed as of late.”
“Well, when you see people as they are, nothing they do surprises you,” said Malfoy simply, “ or disappoints you.”
It was just a break from the incessant noise, gossip, and conspiracy theories of the Gryffindor common room, Harry told himself. Malfoy was only a distraction.
, he had said, smiling gently.
Harry closed his eyes and breathed slowly. Then he opened them. Malfoy waited.
Malfoy seemed to think it over. "Well," he said lightly, "if I were to entertain that thought, I suppose I'd want something too. After all, it'll be so very hard to restrain myself, considering the wealth of material Weasley gives me."
"And?" prompted Hermione.
,” snapped Malfoy. “I’m just stating a fact.”
“Like you could do a half-decent Vanishing spell,” muttered Malfoy.
He turned the faucet and splashed his face, hissing; the cold was like a slap against his raw skin. Then he re-examined his reflection.
This time, Malfoy was faster.
Malfoy paused. “What?”
They went to retrieve their ingredients from the storeroom.
From the armchair above them, there came a gasp.
“No?” said Malfoy. He laughed lowly. “Pity, Potter.”
Then Parvati appeared. Hastily, Harry swallowed, wincing.
Though it had been protected by his robes, Harry’s wrist burned treacherously.
“It’s not like you could ever remember them,” sniped Malfoy.
He hurried after Ginny through the Hogsmeade gates. When he caught up to her, she linked her arm through his and smiled.
Wincing, he said, “I think it’s fractured.”
“Only because they didn’t look too closely,” said Malfoy. “It’s a Disillusionment Charm, not an invisibility cloak.”
“It’s mostly Muggles who think that way,” said Malfoy. “The rest us don’t care.”
Unsteadily, Malfoy shoved himself to his feet.
"What's with the tone of surprise?"
"I thought you weren't a
“But you didn’t—”
A surge of daring rose in Harry. “That a challenge?”
“Hands,” she instructed.
His lips, frozen shut, could not utter a spell. He was so cold he thought he might never move again…
Harry was getting tired of seeing it.
Harry chose not to respond.
Logically, Harry knew that a ghost could do him no harm—even if that ghost had been a vengeful, deranged murderer. But under the Bloody Baron's gaze, Harry began to regret his life choices that had brought him to this moment. If he hadn't said anything, the Baron would have floated right past him; if he hadn't gotten high, he'd never have come across it in the first place. The fault lay, Harry decided, with Draco Malfoy.
The hour and a half that followed was much of the same. Boughbranch would arrive now and then, dispense advice, and retreat to her study. But there was one event that stood out above the rest.
"Who would have seen this coming?” he said. “A future where being a Malfoy closes more doors than it opens."
Ron turned to Hermione. "Speaking, are you?"
Harry cast him a condescending look. "Well, I
Shocked, Harry jerked up. Malfoy grinned toothily. The image reminded Harry of a great white shark.
Atop the rafters sat a dark mass of fur, flicking its lion's tail back and forth like a pendulum.
McGonagall slid two brochures across the desk. They read:
"Well, it's only eleven…" said Ginny. She examined him critically. "But you'll definitely need to sober up."
“I don’t—”
, Malfoy. Why is it that you

think you’re someone to be trusted?”
Malfoy examined him as if he were a peculiar creature he had found on a stroll through the woods. Then he reached out and plucked the snitch from Harry’s hand. His fingers grazed Harry’s palm, warm and dry against the night’s chill.
Malfoy’s smile faded.
"Family…" he said slowly, "isn't conditional. At least, it shouldn't be. If they love you—"
Malfoy spelled his desk clean.
Dean plopped down next to Harry and said, “You all see
“Hear
“Not all Muggles are like that. Or even most of them.”
"She's my best friend, watch what you say," snapped Malfoy. "Anyway, use your fucking head. Do you really think I'd be asking you if I had any other option?"
“Surprised you didn’t, Potter,” said Malfoy archly.
Malfoy arched a brow. “You really couldn’t…with someone you hated?”
about to off myself. I rather like breathing, you know."
Harry made his way to the corner of the library where the books for lowerclassmen were kept. Under the denomination CMC-SCA, he found what he was looking for:
Gently, Harry crouched next to him.
“Who says?” said Malfoy, suddenly harsh.
Together, the three left the castle; Herbology was next. Outside the greenhouses, they found Hagrid lugging a large box labeled 'Carnivorous
Or he’d make everything better, press that mouth somewhere useful—Harry’s throat, Harry’s shoulder. Malfoy never went farther than that. Harry wouldn’t admit he wanted him to.
Malfoy flung aside the tapestry and walked out. Harry counted to twenty, checked that the corridor was empty, then left for Gryffindor Tower.
He said softly, as if he'd forgotten Harry was there, "The things Yaxley would say to mother…"
He pointed into the fog.
“So that’s the story,” said Malfoy briskly. He tucked his quill into his book and snapped it shut.
,” panted Harry, hardly processing what she’d said.
"Fuck off, Myrtle," grunted Harry. "I'm naked."
Despite Pince’s menacing glares, a table of younger students chattered obnoxiously. They fell into sly whispers as Harry drew near.
Malfoy pulled the book into his lap. His brow creased. “Habit, I guess,” he said.
Then he realized what he’d done.
"You've been doing well, haven't you?" said Hermione bracingly.
, what do you know,” it cackled, licking its lips. “He’s got a
Harry felt a jolt to the chest, as if someone had just hit him with a Stunning spell. Slowly, he raised his head to the Slytherin table.
Guilt riddled Harry. Malfoy’s tone was light, but his eyes never left the ceiling.
,” said Neville defensively. “I’m not saying that Malfoy doesn’t deserve it.”
“Of course he’s dead, Potter,” he said, watching Harry carefully. “And my mother didn’t kill him either, in case you’re wondering. She’s never killed anyone.”
Invisible, he hurried down the staircase. The corridors were empty. Malfoy knew what he was talking about: eleven at night was late enough that students were safely tucked away in their common rooms, but early enough that Filch had yet to patrol the corridors, too busy singing to Mrs. Norris or designing torture devices he’d never use.
"Oh."
“You said it yourself that day, Potter. You hoped I’d know what it felt like to lose someone.”
Harry wished he had those problems, instead of the one he was currently facing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oooh, what do we have here?” he said with ghostly glee.
the way he looks at Draco Malfoy?”
Harry had no use for either. He wrapped Malfoy's wand in some newspaper and returned the other to his trunk.
It was starting to get irritating. He wondered if Malfoy had been expelled for lurking in the dungeons.
A phantom blush heated Harry's face. Instead of responding, he said all at once, "Not very smart of you to put it on that tosser stationary. Really, Malfoy,
So why was he being turned inside out and pried open, laid bare, between cold stone and Malfoy’s hard chest?

had won, not—
on his ear.
Harry found it: a small glass bottle which read, in Malfoy’s smooth handwriting: Skel-Repair.
“At least Luna has style,” said Hermione begrudgingly.
With a nimble leap, the kneazle landed on the flagstones in front of Harry. Crookshanks's mewling grew louder.
‘It’s just a lot to take in’ is what he tries to write, but every letter rains down on him before he can finish a single word. After the third time, he makes a frustrated noise and kicks at the railing.
Hermione shook her bushy head, "Boys," she muttered and grinned at the Slytherin girl. "You can't believe them sometimes," Pansy nodded in agreement.
coming out of his mouth, did wicked things to his lower regions. "Erm, I think we should go back,” he said, noticing the stares they were getting from the other guests.
Hermione let out an embarrassed shriek and hit Draco against his shoulder.
"Yes, okay. We will take this slowly. But, you really need to work that out with them. I don't want to wait another two years to finally have you all to my own," Draco admonished his boyfriend.
Draco had his eyes tightly squeezed shut, a dark blush riding high on his cheekbones, and groaned in dismay, "I think I’ve gone blind.”
Draco spluttered at that, "I never wanted-"
The six people around the table were very still. All movement seemed to have ceased.
"So, what happened to you to look like death warmed over?"
Nodding was all Draco did as new tears tracked down his cheeks. Pansy's mind supplied her with malicious scenarios, where Potter's body was never found, at the sight of the fresh tears on her friend's face. Potter would pay for this; she would make sure of that.
Harry sighed again, leaning into Malfoy‘s ear. "Did you apologize to her?" he asked and pointed with his chin towards the owner of the Three Broomsticks. Malfoy nodded with big silvery eyes, "Yes, I wrote her a letter."
Harry sighed in exasperation at his old and new friend’s antics and snatched one of the menus from the middle of the table. "What does everyone want? The first round goes to me," he said, scanning the food section.
Harry sat watching nervously as Draco's beautiful eagle owl swooped down from the enchanted ceiling, which showed the beautiful weather outside, and let the scroll drop into Draco's lap.
,' he chanted in his head as he buried his wet eyes into his blanket.
With shaking hands he opened the scroll, his eyes flying over the scribble.
"Really Darling? The way you've been following him with your eyes lately and literally undressing him with them,
Which brought him back to his actual mission. He still had the nail varnish on his fingers and needed to find Granger to get it removed. He folded the parchment neatly and stuffed it in the pocket of his expensive trousers.
Harry ran like he never had before. He needed to get to Draco, not caring that Ron tried to hold him back or the angry screams of Hermione back in the corridor.
Draco finished with a flourish and snorted while he tapped his wand against the parchment to dry the ink. "I don’t have many options,” he answered while rolling the paper tightly together and stashed it in his black messenger bag.
The two had been a couple for almost two long years now and still, nobody even knew about them. At the time they had started dating, the war was still going on. So they had decided to keep it a secret. Harry had been afraid of losing his friends and the only family figures he had left. He also wanted to keep Draco safe from his father. Who knew what would’ve happened if Lucius Malfoy found out that his only son was bent, and also dating the enemy.
"Yes, I know," Harry murmured as he crawled over Draco's sprawled out body and straddled his hips. His hands cupped Draco's face and he swept one of his thumps over the plum pink bottom lip. "Merlin, I missed you so much, you have no idea," he whispered as he locked his green eyes with Draco's silvery gaze. Slowly he leaned the last few inches and softly touched their lips together.
Morning came too early for the boys in the Gryffindor dormitory. But for Harry, who had gotten little sleep, was wide awake and ready to surprise his boyfriend.
"Just tell us who you like, mate. You're making half a Ministry secret out of it," Ron said, curiosity riding high on his face.
"No, it's because it doesn't feel right to snipe at you and use your first name," Draco commented and sneered at him.
"Why is he with Malfoy? Don't they hate each other?"
Draco crept down the hall as quietly as possible. There was no way he wanted to be seen if he was going to meet Harry in secret tonight. They had made arrangements to meet in the Room of Requirement and Draco had an important matter about their relationship to discuss with Harry.
"Duh, I just noticed that you look horrible and it isn‘t something you normally show." Blaise ducked his head a little and cast his brown eyes to the floor. He seemed to be searching for words. When he finally found them he looked determinedly at Draco. "You see … I miss my old friend. We said some horrible things to each other and you cast me away in sixth year and I was fucking angry with you, but …" He scuffed his feet on the ground. "No more. I want to be friends again, Draco. I know why you did it. I understand now that you wanted to protect me. It took me a long time to overcome what seemed like mistrust. But now I get it. I really do, ... and I want to try being friends again, … if you want too."
"So he's ... what's that called again?" Ron asked, relatively fascinated by the subject. Since Harry had let out that he might have feelings or something for Malfoy, Ron had been thinking more and more about the subject.
However, things looked very different when it came to his chosen partner. Both Weasley parents had reservations about Draco but saw that they couldn't influence love in this way. So they agreed to give his boyfriend a chance when Harry assured them that Draco had changed. All they wanted for him was to be happy and if it was with the young Malfoy, they would do their best to welcome him.
Harry knew deep down that she knew or at least suspected that he had a crush on Draco and that she was utterly disappointed in him for saying shite like that. Harry was also frustrated. With himself. Why hadn't he stood up to Ron, when this shitty talk began? Why hadn't he drawn on his Gryffindor bravery and got it all out in one go? Now the damage was done and Harry hoped insistently that Draco would never hear about this. He didn't want to hurt him, he never did, but what's done was done and he couldn't take it back now.
"Ronald!" Hermione admonished him.
Even though it broke his heart to see together, Harry couldn't help it. His eyes were constantly looking for Draco. So it came about that Harry found himself in a rather awkward position.
Sometimes he thought he had done enough to prove that he was a good guy, but then his mistakes came back to haunt him and he grew determined to make amends.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the dragon dung and dumped it unceremoniously into the voluminous pot. "Your job, Potter. Knead away."
"Next weekend, it will be two years on the dot," Draco said almost bashfully. Blaise choked on his spit. "What? Two years?" he exclaimed. "And you didn't see the need to tell us before now?"
Draco rose on Monday morning, feeling ravished and exhausted. He had holed himself up in his dorm the whole weekend, afraid to run into Potter again. He hadn’t eaten and didn’t sleep a wink because every time he closed his eyes, unwanted images of a bound Potter swarmed his mind.
"Draco, pray tell us how long has this relationship been going on for," she said inquisitively.
Malfoy approaching Hermione on his own, she holding his hands and talking kindly to him, even though he was an arrogant asshole to her. And then came Harry and Ron just couldn’t take his eyes away. His best friend was absolutely smitten with the slimy git. Even blushed while caressing his fingers.
But what worried him more were the other two groups. They were like two factions fighting against each other. One group consisted mostly of Slytherins with a few Ravenclaws and Huffelpuffs mixed in between them. They roamed the castle, blaming everyone and everything for their own mistakes. They annoyed Filch, not that Ron felt a lot sorry for the man, but the statements that he was a worthless Squip were worrying. They also hexed younger students and generally bullied people they didn't like.
Ron and Hermione had tried to talk to him, to bring him out of his brooding but to no avail. They even tried talking to Draco, which left Harry with a deep-running love for both of them. But they came back unsuccessful, just as he had.
Harry got up. "I will look where he went," he said. The next moment the doors opened again and a breathless Draco Malfoy strode in with the biggest bouquet in his hands Harry had ever seen. Malfoy stopped in front of Madam Rosmerta, bowed, and presented the flowers to her. "I sincerely apologize again for what I did to you. I‘m really sorry and hope you will accept my sincerity," he said in his best manners.
Ron was shaking him, his big hands tightly clutched around Harry’s shoulders. "What the hell did he mean it’s over? What’s over, why did he say you did those things?" Ron half yelled, completely shocked.
He was startled with a shock when Harry dropped to one of his knees and looked up at him with a beautiful smile. Harry pulled out a small box and opened it. Over the first squeals from some female students close by, he heard Harry raise his voice as he continued speaking.
Blaise beamed at him, "Who is the lucky lady you are currently courting? Someone, we know?"
When the door finally showed up, Harry grinned lovingly at Draco and pulled him by his hand inside a dimly lit room with light wooden walls. A fire blazed in the fireplace to their right, filling the room with warmth and making both boys relax. In the middle of the room was a big four-poster bed, clad in shiny silver duvet covers which had the Slytherin emblem embedded on it. Against the wall opposite the fireplace stood a small cabinet filled with small bottles and boxes. Harry smirked as he saw that this particular wish had been fulfilled by the room. He walked over the plush dark green carpet toward the bed and pulled Draco after him, who looked around in astonishment.
A few days later a problem made itself known. Hermione couldn’t look at Ron without blushing violently, much to Ron’s misery, and everyone else’s amusement, who knew about the story featuring him and Blaise. Even Draco laughed when Pansy explained what was going down at the Gryffindor table the first time it happened.
"That was close," she groused and glared at them, then puffed her chubby cheeks and huffed angrily, "Five points from Gryffindor and Slytherin, for carelessness."
"Look Draco… can I call you by your first name?” She asked uncertainty but continued when he nodded in bewilderment, "I want to let the past go. I haven’t forgotten what you did to me or my best friends. I guess I will never really forget it, but I don’t want to live my life hating someone who despite it all saved Harry in a most critical moment and tried to protect his own family. And I see that you try to change and make amends for what you did.” She raised an eyebrow when Draco shook his head and looked down at the worn-out wood of the table.
Ron whimpered and Zabini explosively began to laugh. "Don’t worry Weasley, your ass is safe,” he reassured, making the ginger-haired Gryffindor choke, but ignored him otherwise. "So that’s what’s going on. Someone is writing stories about you two and now Weasley and me. Hell, I want to meet them. If they’re only half as hot as that story…,” he left the rest of the sentence to everyone’s imagination but the smirk on his lips told the whole story.
Draco sharply sucked air into his lungs. "Two years Potter and now I‘m Malfoy again?"
Harry averted his eyes from the taller boy and suddenly became very interested in the Solem Inflamare. "Will you help me plant it?" he asked, trying to distract from the original topic.
"Hm, that is what I was planning to do," Harry chuckled and slithered down Draco's body. He knelt between Draco's spread legs and motioned the Slytherin to lift his bum. His hands started to knead the soft flesh, spreading it further with every caress. His thump swept in between and stroked over the fluttering, puckered flesh of Draco's anus.
Draco let out a startled yelp but soon moved his lips to kiss back just as frantically as he registered the wild mop of hair and the intoxicating scent of one Harry Potter, his former arch-enemy and beloved ex-boyfriend.
"Ha! That I can then speak stilted like you? I don't think so," Harry said solemnly. He wasn't sure why they bickered again, but it was kind of fun without the usual malice behind the words.
Ron looked dumbfounded. "W-what do you mean?” he stuttered. Certainly, Harry didn’t mean holding hands with the blond Slytherin git.
"Oh come on, Draco. The hickeys on your neck are evidence enough that you're seeing someone," Pansy chided.
So he wanted to talk to Harry today and hoped that his boyfriend would agree to go public with their relationship. Even if that meant that people would say he had bewitched Harry, he didn't care. He wanted everyone to know of their love. He felt deep down that he could build a future with Harry, but for that to happen they needed to take the first step into the unknown together.
It had been on the tip of Hermione’s tongue that she knew what Pansy was talking about but decided to only shake her head at her new friend's antics. She never would fully understand how a Slytherin’s mind worked but it was a fascinating thing to see.
He didn't understand or knew why Harry would play such a foul game with him. Especially since he gave Harry all of him. His heart, his body, and even his virginity. He thought that they had something special, something more. But it was just poison and lies.
"Could you just not?" Harry asked, exasperated with them all. "What is it with you today? Is embarrass-Malfoy-day or something? You obviously know that he isn’t comfortable with that kind of teasing and do it anyway. Tell me why?"
"Woah, okay, mate," Ron said, holding up his hands defensively. "If he is the one you want, well..." he glanced at Hermione, seeking her help. “We won't hold you back, Harry," she smiled at her boyfriend and released Harry from her sticking charm, just as he made his way to get up.
"Hello, Granger,” he said and coaxed a small smile to his lips. He had his hand on the back of one of the chairs in question if he was allowed to sit.
“Are you really only having some bread and an apple? Draco, love, try the lasagne. It’s become better since fifth year.”
He’d been lucky. Draco hadn’t. It seems that now, more than ever, their positions had reversed since the first year of Hogwarts.
“Our years of Hogwarts have never been about the spells, or the potions, or any of the actual schoolwork. They’ve been about learning to become our best selves. They’ve been about the friendships we’ve made, the conflicts we’ve faced, the changes happening inside our own minds. Our learning was more unconventional than anyone else’s, but we should be proud of that! We should hold our heads high, and say ‘I was a fighter! I lived through a war, and came out the other side a better person than I was before!’ If we are to truly honour every life lost, and every memory made here, we should try to become a person we can be proud of.”
Her light hair flicks over her shoulder as she gazes past him. “I can’t remember. Perhaps a Sroating told me in my dreams…Anyway, Ginny, you said you wanted to join the Gryffindor Quidditch team again?”
“You’re dead.”
“It’s weird that you’re going to be the first.” Harry shakes his head in amazement. “I bet they’re going to remember your name for far longer than mine. The Boy Who Lived Twice? Nah, they’re gonna be celebrating Luna Lovegood, first ever Mind Healer.”
I love you!
“No, Harry, I can see that look. I’m not getting desperate! The new recruits have reexamined it and the other ones were wrong! It’s not impossible to get back!”
“Oh!” Luna jumps up again in realisation. “I forgot to talk to Red Hawk this morning. I need to go.” She drops the plant into Ginny’s lap, and dashes off, hair flowing behind her. Ginny stares at the plant, which waves at her feebly.
“Great!” Remus pulls a face. “Well, Kreacher is being a pain about some objects. ‘It’s Regulus’s favourite watch’ or ‘that was built before you were born, you can’t throw it out’. That sort of thing.”
The common room is empty for once, most people out to help Harry and Theo or to arrange Narcissa’s move. With all of the pressure from them and their families, the ministry is bound to relent at some point. Luna would like to help, but she’s in the younger year, and Hermione insists they focus on their lessons.
“I think so.” Theo nods, face as flat as ever. Harry has learnt, over the past few days, that this usually means he is scared, or angry. “I mean- I know so. This is it.”
“Both.”
Brocklehurst, Mandy
Shoving his wand in his pocket, he shrugs. “Not much point. It’s the first day, we should go enjoy ourselves."
“Do you like it?” Harry grins, spreading his arms and gesturing at the scene. “I was going to get a sofa or something, but I didn’t have enough time.”
Unfortunately, my uploads won't be regular for the foreseeable future.
“Thanks everyone for coming.” Harry starts off, tapping the top of the lectern to set off the amplifying spell. His voice carries across the hall, making those who hadn’t been paying attention turn to look at them. “It’s been a strange last few days, knowing that we’ll never come back here, but I hope you’ve all enjoyed yourselves tonight.” A cheer at that. “I’ll say a few words at the end, but there’s someone else who’d like to speak first. Please be kind, as I know he’d be to you.”
“It’s done.” Blaise sidles over to her, slipping his arm around her waist.
He shrugs again, uncaring. She could think what she liked of him. Eventually she will see the monster he really is, when they arrive at school with all the whispering and the glaring. Maybe that’s what he is scared of. Not the questions, but the answers. He’s not ready for them to know how horrific his true nature is.
Better. He folds the parchment, slips it into an envelope, and leaves it on the desk. Hermione or Potter can take it up to the owlery next time they visit. As he thinks that, the door opens and Potter walks in, bright grin on his face and treacle tart in hand.
“If not, I shall tell you now. So-called ‘vigilante groups’ have been attacking people who are former Death Eaters, associated with Death Eaters, or anyone who has belonged to Slytherin house.”
He takes a step there, pulling out his wand to dispel the spitting barrier. He deserves it. The despair reaches into his chest, twisting the guilt into furious flames that tell him to walk further, walk into that room and end it all.
“Anyway, I’m getting morbid.” She snorts. “Vold- Voldemort was just a guy who happened to be both twisted and powerful. It probably doesn’t mean anything. Uhm, while we’re on the subject…”
“Are you sure you’ve got everything?” Harry steps back, eyes scanning the room.
He gulps, setting off down the long pathway. The unsettling feeling follows him, surrounds him, and Harry wonders how in Merlin’s name Narcissa is surviving in this place. He wonders how Draco survived, in the months between the trial and school starting. Then he realises Draco didn’t survive, not really. He’d been a ghost, his past self barely peeking its head out.
Harry sits back, pushing his glasses up his nose. “Don’t worry, I wasn’t going to leave until you called. How are things back in Grimmauld Place?”
Albiet when drunk, but the best plans are made when drunk! Tbh I have no idea, I've never been drunk before. Aaanyway I'm straying off topic. Any ideas for future chapters, please say!
There are a few gasps, muttered voices mixing with small squeals of surprise. He hasn’t spoken since his death, and before that, had only managed shorter sentences than these. By the looks of delight and shock from the other students, they hadn’t realised he and Harry had been practising.
He can only stare, shock rendering him immovable.
- E.D.
A collective sigh of relief ripples over the group as they surge forward again, nervously disappearing into the air. Pans giggles as she sticks her foot out, watching it vanish, then following it. Now there’s only Draco left behind, staring at the empty space.
I did not expect to finish this chapter so quickly, but here it is!
He sits up, a rush of nausea threatening to push him back down, but he fights through it. No matter how much the soft, warm, comfortable bed calls to him, he has to write back to his mother today. Placing the wand gently on his bed stand, he drags himself over to his desk, pulling parchment and a quill over to him.
“Ron, break the connection. Slice it like butter, remember?” A boy says near him, the other one who had been shouting before. He doesn’t like him. He doesn’t like what he says even more. He should shut up.
“They keep saying that they need to hold a trial for Sirius, since he was never officially cleared of his crimes, and the fact that we know that slimeball Pettigrew did it apparently doesn’t change that. He can’t have a trial now, he’s only just become alive again.” Remus rubs the bridge of his nose tiredly. “I think they just want a reason to make use of their court system. All that investment after the war, all of the money spent reforming the system, and they’ve barely used it since the Death Eater trials. Dragging up a dead case through the system will stop people complaining that they should have spent the money elsewhere.”
"Even if it hurts me a bit to let you go, I'll give you a piece of honest advice," she said next to his ear, "go and get your man back and be damn well happy with him. You deserve to be happy." She slapped him encouragingly on the back, before pulling away from him. Harry looked at her with wide green eyes, "Thanks, Ginny," he said and a hesitant smile began to play around the corners of his mouth.
"Merlin, woman! Would you stop bringing me out of the concept? It's dangerous," he shouted and drew Professor Sprout's attention to them. "Be careful!" she exclaimed and pointed her wand at one of the baubles which had come loose of one of the corolla leaves. "Glacius," she shouted, and the small ball of fire froze in mid-air before it splintered into a thousand ice crystals on the ground.
Neville nodded, going red but didn't break free from the Slytherins grasp. Behind them, they heard the girls giggle. The subject was without a doubt their two best friends making beautiful eyes at each other.
He took one dazed look at his friends and sighed softly. "You are going to talk to him, aren’t you?" he asked, throwing his arm over his red swollen eyes.
"Yeah, I know," Harry murmured. "Let's go back to Ron before he explodes and comes over here."
“Don’t you dare tell him or Harry. Gods!” she groaned miserably while Draco chuckled.
"How long have you been ... gay?" Ron asked darkly, crossing his arms in front of his body as if in defense.
He looked down to the grumbled parchment and with a sudden burst of anger smashed it into the toilet and flushed it down, angrily ripping at the metal chain. His palm hurt and his breath came in short gasps as he slowly got his demeanor together again.
Upon entering the library Draco instantly spotted Granger. He drew in a huge gulp of breath to get his nerves together and walked over to the bushy-haired girl.
Pansy chuckled, "That color compliments you greatly."
"Uhm, I …" Draco whispered, not knowing where to begin. He had wanted to tell his friends for a while now. He had even talked Harry into coming out officially. But now being in this situation on his own, He was immensely overwhelmed. He felt his cheeks growing hot and he couldn't look Pansy or Blaise in the eye. Then he thought maybe it was the best to first clear up the misunderstanding that Blaise had naturally made.
Madam Rosmerta was flabbergasted but accepted the apology by taking the flowers out of Malfoy‘s hands. Harry beamed at him as the blond made his way back to the table. "You think that was enough?" he asked Harry while sitting down again. "Yes, she looks very pleased," he responded as he glanced at Madame Rosmerta who had a slight pink flush to her cheekbones and smelled the flowers with a small smile on her lips. Malfoy nodded thoughtfully, "Maybe I should apologize personally to all people I hurt over the past years."
"Careful there," Malfoy mumbled, his minty breath fanning over Harry’s lips, making his head swim. His eyes swiped down to the blond‘s lips for a second before they locked gazes again.
Draco laughed and answered with descending his lips to Harry's. Slowly he moved Harry backward toward the bed that was laid out in the middle of the room, not breaking their lips apart.
The one time he caught Draco unaware and without company, the Slytherin had slid-on his cold mask of indifference and told him in an icy tone, that he no longer wanted anything to do with him.
"Who is it? Who are you in love with?" she asked, trying to catch his eye.
When Draco entered the Slytherin common room the next morning he found Pansy and Blaise already sitting in the elegant, dark green upholstered armchairs, which are located in front of the fireplace. It burned all year round to chase away the cold that lingered down in the dungeons.
Draco smirked at him. "Why, thank you, Potter. I hadn't known you noticed," he teased, his smirk deepening when Harry blushed. "Shut up, Malfoy!" He groused and crouched down to get his dragonhide gloves out of his rucksack.
"Fuck this! Yes, Ronald, we were," Harry growled furiously back.
Hermione’s face was buried into the crook of her arm which rested on the table, hair obscuring the violent blush that had befallen her whole shaking body.
"Granger-,” Draco began but was again interrupted.
When he finally reached the Room of Requirement, he saw that Harry had arrived there before him. Inwardly, he braced himself for the upcoming conversation, took another deep breath, and opened the door.
Draco tried to block them out and focus on the brilliant green of Harry's eyes which brimmed with affection.
"Draco, why is potter coming over here?" Pansy whispered into his ear, leaning close.
Harry was heading with Hermione and Ron to the library for one of Hermione's study sessions. He contemplated how he should begin to tell them that he was indeed gay. When he finally got his nerves to calm down a bit, they were standing near a mostly abandoned alcove on the third floor and he decided
Draco laughed mirthlessly. "Granger, who in their right mind would let me near their children?”
, he thought. But the damage was done. Not only because Harry had marked him as his own, but also because of Draco's own thoughtless reaction.
Hermione paused at that and looked at him critically. "Harry, can I talk to you for a moment alone?" she asked, waving him away from Ron.
Banishing everything that had happened in the past half an hour from his mind, Harry finally got out of his bed, snatched a towel and fresh clothes from his trunk, and walked out of the room. He needed a shower, a cold one and he wasn’t keen to ponder why he needed it cold. Ice cold.
"Oh my god, I want to get a proposal too."
Harry stood there stunned, wide eyes, shocked that Draco had told them that, even more so Draco just broke up with him. Harry knew he’d royally fucked up.
"What about teaching?” Hermione inquisitioned.
Hermione's eyes glinted knowingly, "So, like Malfoy then?" She probed. A grin widened on her face.
Harry was his and Draco was jealous of everyone looking at Harry and talked to him like they knew him, while Draco could not even be around Harry as much as he had wanted to be.  He could only hold his boyfriend’s hand in private.
Thank god,'
"You two were together?" Ron asked, utter disbelief in his voice.
He took off his invisibility cloak and did as he was told. He looked at her with tired eyes, holding a biscuit in his hand. "What did you want to tell me, Headmistress McGonagall," he asked in a broken voice. Most of the time when he was called into the Headmaster's office, bad news had been waiting for him. He couldn't take any more of it.
"Huh?" made Ron surprised, allowing Blaise to snatch the paper from Pansy’s red-clawed fingers. He began reading but didn’t get far before his mouth fell open and he gaped at his friends in utter shock. The parchment glided to the middle of the table when it fell from the shivering hands of the dark-skinned Slytherin.
Harry was going crazy. It was now almost a month since Draco had heard that sodding conversation and Harry still hadn't found a way to apologize in earnest. All attempts had been nipped in the bud, either from Draco himself or from one of his friends. Pansy was particularly rigorous in cursing him. When she was around Harry couldn't even look at Draco without risking a hex.
"Because it would be good for your reputation and ⅔ of the Golden Trio are actually fun. Blaise will come with us. I already told Hermione.” Pansy counted on her fingers, while she tried to look intelligently at the ceiling.
Tomorrow would be the big day and Harry felt pretty nervous but more so excited. He tossed and turned in his bed, going over everything in his head and praying to Merlin, Morgana, and Circe that Draco would react positively to his performance.
The reconciliation they had the week before had brought one thing clear to the front of Harry's mind and wouldn't even leave him alone for even ten minutes.
Harry was on the verge of freaking out and intervening when he saw that Zabini was pushing Draco against the cold wall and his face was getting dangerously close to Draco's.
Draco lowered the letter to his lap. A single tear rolled down his cheek as a small laugh brushed out his lips. He could still remember why his mother had written him this letter.
Draco’s frantic heartbeat had calmed down while he read. The story was so cheesy but on the other hand so lovingly soft that a small smile had crept upon his lips. This was nothing like the other story and he was utterly glad about that. Whoever had written it must have been a girl for it was the perfect date for a delicate damsel. For Draco, it was too much, too perfect and he wouldn't be caught dead in Madam Puddifoot's.
. Ron wasn't good at sneaking up and being invisible, that was always more like Harry's job. But he didn’t get good vibes from this group, so he had sat it on his list of potential dangers.
"Longbottom? Does he want to take over Herbology later on?” Draco asked, taking the tip of his tongue between his lips in concentration as he wrote out the last sentence of his essay.
Harry scuffed his shoe on the ground and bit his lip. Then he suddenly snapped his head up and spat out, "I'm gay."
Cold sweat formed on his forehead. He had lost it. The sodding parchment was gone. He groaned inwardly and pulled his hair. "Gryffindor‘s left nipple. Fuck!" he cursed under his breath as he backtracked his steps through the castle, eyes pinned to the floor.
Draco walked into the Great Hall and let his eyes roam over the students currently present which weren’t many at this early hour. He let out his breath in relief when no one instantly shot a hex at him and moved fast to his chair at the outside of the eight years table, which was situated parallel to the teachers one.
"Erm… I might have a thing for… Malfoy.” Harry exhaled heavily, saying the name Ron didn’t want to hear from his friend in a hundred years in this combination.
"Well ... always?" Harry cringed. He knew that being gay wasn't a decision you made. It just was like that. And even if he had shown interest in girls before, it was just curiosity. Everyone did that, didn't they? Through trial and error, he had found out he just liked blokes better, one bloke in particular though.
"Then let him," Pansy said abrasively, "He doesn't deserve your sympathy Draco, not after what he did to you."
"Fine. Fine! I will ask her. Kindly! But if she hexes me you both will pay," he exclaimed and strode dramatically to the door.
Pulling back his mouth, he watched how Draco's hole twitched at the loss. "You really like that, don’t you?" Harry asked with hooded eyes, already searching for the second vial.
So, for today he told Blaise he needed time alone. He had slipped outside to take a walk around the grounds. In the near distance, he could make out Hagrid's hut, from which whitish clouds of smoke curled up from the chimney. Draco sighed. He felt melancholic today and thought maybe it was a good time to apologize to the gamekeeper about his past behaviour.
Draco fixed his gaze on Potter, ignoring the puffing Weasel that was hissing scathingly. "I hope you had your fun Potter, you lying piece of shit. Never come near me again, ever! It's over. Have fun fucking up someone else life."
Draco's body only shuddered. He was beyond words for the feelings Harry gave him were just too much for his brain to comprehend. He just pushed his hips back as a request for Harry to finally fuck him.
Over the next few weeks, things slowly calmed down. The students were swamped with lessons and homework. Harry still wasn’t talking to Ron and Hermione had somehow befriended Pansy Parkinson after they got thrown together for a Charmes project. The girls currently sat outside on the courtyard and talked about the final touches of their newly invented Charm. Harry looked down at his hands. He had played guinea pig for the girls and his nails now showed an electric deep blue with little stars that sparkled in and out of existence.
"I ... uhm ... the thing is ... I...," Draco stuttered and broke off. Damn this was horrible, but he needed to get it out or he would explode with the tension of not knowing how they would react. He mentally berated himself to grow a pair and opened his mouth to look his imminent doom in the eye.
, bullied her in every way possible and his aunt had tortured her.
Hermione eyed him suspiciously. "You’re not convincing. Did something happen with Malfoy?" she asked while opening the tome, pretending to read.
Before Harry could even open his mouth, McGonagall spoke again, "Does your behaviour have anything to do with Mr. Malfoy? I noticed you were getting along and now you're not."
“Hermione,” Pansy quipped happily.
Now he was sitting here and all the noises around him seemed to have fallen away as Draco Malfoy, his Draco, walked into the room on the arm of Blaise Zabini, another 8th-year Slytherin. The dark-skinned boy leaned in slightly and whispered something in Draco's ear. Draco began to laugh, the laugh that Harry loved to hear so much and usually was otherwise only reserved for him.
Harry cringed inwardly, his heart stuttered for a moment. Did Ron already find him out? No, that couldn't be. Harry's heart sank to his stomach. He had known that Ron would be difficult when it got to Draco and Harry was glad that he hadn't told them, yet. For now, Harry shook his head. He would have to have this argument with Ron another day. He thought, sighing to himself.
Pansy just laughed at Draco’s dramatic antics. "Oh, please, you drama queen. Grow some balls, will you? She is fine. She won’t hex you if you ask kindly like you said you would do."
"Aren't you hot?" he asked panting when he heaved the heavy sack of earth on the table.
Draco gaped at his boyfriend in shock. He couldn't fathom what Harry was up to. 'Is this what I think it is?' he thought to himself, not believing that it was finally happening after all this time. Eyes raking over Harry's face to catch a glimpse of what was coming, he felt super uneasy with all the whispering he heard around them.
Harry snapped back to reality, face red hot, and gazed up at Draco who looked at him worriedly. "Where have you just been?" he asked softly. "I called you several times. You may want to put on gloves before you approach the plant. Look, your hand already got blisters. "With that, Draco loosened Harry's hand, which was wrapped much too tightly around the stem of the plant, and carefully stroked the small blisters that had formed on Harry's skin with a fingertip that was not yet gloved. Draco mumbled a cooling charm and Harry shuddered at the soft feeling of Draco's skin against his own. "Sorry, I know it's cold but it will help against the blisters."
Draco was trembling with excitement and when the cool air hit his cock, it twitched at Harry, demanding attention.
"It's not a girl," he murmured, rubbing his hand over his face. Fuck! That was more difficult than he had thought.
"Uhm, I have no idea, maybe because it is still weird to address each other by first name, even if it was my suggestion." Harry shrugged.
Draco had to kind of agree with that. Harry had tried to contact him, but always quickly withdrew when he encountered resistance. He sighed again. He didn't even have tears left to cry over his failed relationship. The all-encompassing grief that he felt to have lost the love of his life went much deeper and found no expression in tears.
when their food and drinks arrived, steaming hot and delicious. It could’ve been a nice Saturday afternoon if no one had opened the door and let the sodding owl in.
Hermione rounded the table and sat beside him after apologizing to Mrs. Pince, the librarian, who sent a warning glare their way. They cuddled together and Hermione updated Ron what had happened while he was sulking.
"Yes, Neville was a black pit of information on that,” Hermione grinned and closed her book.
A pink touch crept up on Draco’s cheeks. "Yes, fine. I wanted him to be my friend but we aren’t and will never be. Not after everything." his voice had grown almost to a whisper on the last words and he jerkily bound his shoelaces, averting to look anywhere else.
"Uhm, yeah. Something along those lines," Draco nodded, cheeks pinking again in embarrassment.
"RONALD!" Hermione screeched and swatted him over his head.
"What are you doing? Unhand me, Potter," Draco hissed with his usual scowl, ignoring the fact that he himself had willingly taken Harry's hand. He felt his cheeks heating up in embarrassment. Half the room was staring at them now and Draco didn't know what to do or what Harry was planning.
However, Harry was still afraid to bring them out into the open. Draco could understand that but it was still frustrating, having to play hide and seek with his own boyfriend. He felt more and more like a dirty little secret the longer they snuck around. He wanted to finally tell everyone about them since he had grown to love Harry more and more with each passing day. His friends who didn’t know he was already in a relationship, kept trying to set him up with different girls saying he should get out more. Draco was also fed up with girls constantly asking Harry out on a regular basis. He had become even more popular since he defeated the Dark Lord.
Draco and Harry had neither eyes nor ears for their fellow classmates. The two were completely lost in one another and looked deep into the other's eyes before they gave each other a passionate kiss in front of all the assembled residents of Hogwarts.
spell later and his trunk had tipped his things on his bed, creating more chaos. He began sorting through it, trash and treasures on two different piles. Clothes on a third and school supplies made the fourth. It took him a while but when he was almost done, he noticed that he began to feel a bit better. Cleaning had a calming effect on him as his mother had often advised him.
"Why, Potter? My pronunciation is not stilted, but aristocratic. It would do you good to learn with all the speeches you have to give."
Harry and Hermione had been right. Again. Most of Hogwarts had returned to a kind of normalcy, doing their thing and trying to cope with their losses and grief. Some with more success, others with less. And that was fine.
When the groups met, duels would break out with minor to moderate injuries and hexes. Ron was once being caught up in the middle while trying to break them apart. And he had the ominous suspicion that both of the groups were responsible for bullying Malfoy. It had subsided by now, but when it happened it was all the more violent. Ron had met Filch once when he had to scrub unsightly red paint off the walls. The words had clearly been addressed to the blonde Slytherin, even if most of it had already been blurred.
And amidst the screams of disbelief and ecstatic squeaks of the others present, Harry got back to his feet with a beaming smile and twinkling green eyes and put the ring on Draco's finger. He was so happy. He felt overjoyed that he was back together with Harry who was now his fiancé.
When personally asked, what had attracted the two to each other; devastatingly bright smiles graced their faces. With their hands joined together, they turned to each other giggling, their bright Eyes gleamed mischievously, as their rings glinted in the sunlight, and they both spoke at the same time:
"Well, yes. But that doesn’t mean I will have somewhere to work afterward,” he said, furring his brows. "No one wants someone with a Dark Mark working for them,” he muttered.
Hermione‘s eyebrows shot up into her fringe and she already had a prickly comeback on her down-drawn lips as she noticed the almost hidden upward turn of Draco’s lip corner. "I practice speeches like that every day or how do you think I get those two thickheads to do their homework?" she said with an amused smirk on her lips.
"Yeah, I did," Draco sighed and wiped his hair back again. "You know I have wanted to be his friend since the first year. When he rejected me it hurt my pride and I was angry and jealous of his fame. Somehow my feelings changed, but he was ignoring me except for when I insulted him or his friends. So I did that to get his attention. I never wanted to tell him of my feelings though, as I also needed to consider my family stature, and my father would have hated me. Mother not so much, but my father would not have been amused. His only heir being gay and in love with one Harry Potter, the Chosen One, who went against his precious Dark Lord. It wouldn't have gone down well," Draco explained to them, while he inwardly went through his emotions, which throughout the years had led him to start dating Harry bloody Potter.
"Hey Draco," Pansy greeted and a curious gleam entered her eyes. "So, where have you been sneaking off to lately? Blaise told me you weren't in your room at all last night. Did you find someone to your liking?" Pansy smirked knowingly.
Draco got out of his befuddlement when he heard Granger’s loud laughter. "Oh my!” she wheezed, wiping a stray tear from her eye.
Weasley was miserable, to a fault. Either he turned red like a tomato, which stung wonderfully with his orange hair, or he sat there scowling and mumbling curses to himself.
Blaise also changed, a smile playing on his lips. "I noticed that Potter was very angry for your sake when that blasted parchment came the first week. You were already in the infirmary when he threw a fit in the Great Hall. Are you on good terms with him now?"
Harry groaned again as he rolled out of his bed, eyes open by mere slits, and tumbled over on unsteady feet to let the blasted bird and cool morning air into the room. He heard Ron stir in the background but the ginger merely rolled over and began to snore. Squinting his eyes against the light, Harry fumbled with the bindings of the scroll which was attached to the leg of the beautiful nightcrawler. When he finally got it, the owl hooted and went off against the last stars that still twinkled at the firmament. It was too bloody early to be awake, Harry decided and fell back to his bed, burying his head in his pillow.
“Yes, that was something. They seem perfectly fine being in each other's company but then they start to bicker like an old married couple again. I thought that they finally reached the first name basis when we were in Hogsmeade but they started that Potter/Malfoy shit all over again. Though the name-calling and the insults have considerably lessened. What the hell is wrong with them?” Pansy exclaimed, wildly waving her hands about.
Pansy giggled in amusement, "Don't be ashamed, Ronnykins, Blaise is sexy, even you have to admit that and he likes both, even if redheads aren't one of them."
"This is mesmerizing," he mumbled, turning his hands back and forth.
Harry's challenging green eyes remained fixed on Zabini. "I will never hurt him again. I love him and will do everything in my power to make him happy."
, but the nail polish was still there.
He would pull this off tomorrow, even if the whole of the wizarding world was against them, he didn't care. He would show everyone that Draco was his; the rest of the world could go to hell for all he cared; he had done his part in the war and deserved to be happy now.
"Pans, I- I-" Draco shuddered as he tried to suck a breath into his lungs. "I broke up with him," he breathed out, his tears soaking further into his pillow.
Blaise grinned at that. "Yeah, Draco. Balls!" Both of his friends snorted at that and Draco threw his hands in the air while rolling his eyes.
"I wanted to apologize. I know my behavior was wrong and I vow to improve. Do you forgive me?" He sent her a charming smile and waited on her reaction, feeling like sitting on glowing coals.
He still wasn’t used to his new dorm room in the newly founded eighth-year tower which he shared with his best mate. The outlay was different, with beds, tables, and chairs coming in a double set and the huge windows on one wall. It wasn’t the first time he had forgotten to draw his bed curtains shut, but today of all days it irritated him to such lengths that he couldn’t fall back asleep.
Harry rolled his eyes. "No, Ginny I can’t. I just want my peace and quiet," he answered her sloppily, which the fiery redhead didn't like at all.
Ron groaned in dismay and Pansy let her shoulders hang in defeat. Three rows back, Harry chuckled at the odd pair and shook his head.
Hermione sat across from him, Ron sat to her right side, and Pansy on her left. Blaise had snatched a seat at the head of the table after he unceremoniously pushed Malfoy onto the chair next to Harry.
Had Harry felt this way all along? How could he endure this pain? Draco couldn't. His feet automatically carried him down to the dungeons and to the Slytherin's common room. He had to talk to Blaise today. There was no turning back for him; he could no longer do this to Harry.
Draco thought, noticing the use of his first name in bewilderment, and sat down. His back was ramrod straight and he fiddled with his fingers in front of him.
Still gaping at Harry he breathed breathlessly, "Yes."
He swept through the room, threw himself into his new, fitting clothes, which he had ordered specially on Ron’s advice and, for once, needed forever in the bathroom to tame his hair with the newly learned spells from Hermione. And with a good portion of Sleekeazy's. When he eventually finished, Neville was groaning from the door that he would finally have to go to the bathroom if Harry didn't want to wipe up a puddle.
If the Great Hall had already been in an uproar because of Valentine's Day, it now looked like a vicious cauldron. Absolutely everyone had an opinion on what had just happened and was loud and clear about it.
Fuming, he made it around the table, when he heard Ron mutter under his breath, "... holding hands with that slimy git now …”
Pansy lowered the scroll and looked at Hermione with wide, incredulous eyes. Her mouth was slightly open and her cheeks were adorned with a bright shade of red. Hermione didn't look much better. The girls stared at each other for a while before bursting into embarrassed laughter.
Draco snorted in anger and frustration. How had he ever thought that the Chosen One could like him, even love him? He was the biggest idiot on the planet. And it was all Harry's fault that he felt like this. Like, like ... he couldn't even begin to describe what he felt besides numbness and anger.
"What?!” Ron exclaimed, his eyes going as wide as dinner plates. "B-but you’re straight! You dated my sister. You’re certainly just confused because you don’t get any...” Ron’s voice got louder and more panicked with every word he said.
Draco’s hands were shaking madly as he squeezed his horrified eyes shut and grumbled the paper into a small ball. Who the bloody hell came up with such outlandish and abhorrent thoughts and even saw the need to write them down? Further, who saw the need to send it to him? This was the sickest joke anyone had ever played on him and he wished to burn the sender alive with the parchment stuffed into their mouths.
Harry nearly exploded at that but Hermione was faster. She took the tome she brought earlier and smacked it straight into Ron’s face. "You’re the slimy git. I'm so disappointed in you. Don’t even imagine coming to Harry or me without an apology," she hissed at her boyfriend, trembling from head to toe with anger.
Hermione threw her hands in the air and scowled at Ron. "We will talk about this later, Ronald!" she warned him in an angry voice and rounded on Harry again. "So, who do you like then?" she asked, finally diverting the attention from the Malfoy topic.
It is nice to be able to witness the happiness of the Boy-Who-Lived and his chosen one. As a friend to both, I'm happy and supportive of them, so are their closest friends. Everyone who is close to both of them wishes them both all the best for the future.
"Ah, Pans let the love birds be. They must have talked about how to best get their alone time without us," Blaise smirked.
"I don't care if he has changed, Hermione," said Ron harshly, getting out of his paralysis. "He is a fucking Death Eater, he bears the Dark Mark on his arm and his bloody Death Eater father, who tried to murder my sister, is in Azkaban where he belongs. That Malfoy isn't locked in there with him is an outrage in itself, and I mourn the poor soul that happens to get stuck dating him." His blue eyes flashed angrily at his girlfriend as he said this.
Blaise took everything in a stride. He laughed about it when asked by Pansy and curiously eyed every owl in the hope to find the one who had delivered the parchment to find its owner. But so far without a positive outcome.
Draco's heart sped up as Harry came to a stop before him, he seemed nervous but courageous. Harry held out his hand to Draco invitingly. Flabbergasted upon the bold approach Draco let himself be pulled up and quirked a questioning eyebrow at the Golden Boys' mischievous grin.
Harry could only watch as the love of his life walked away from him. He couldn’t feel his legs, his heart was in shreds and the trembling of his body didn’t seem to stop anytime soon.
"Tch, you love me? Don’t make me laugh, Potter! If you would love me, you wouldn’t have said those things or traduced me in front of your friends, now I get why you didn't want to come out to them. You’re full of shit!" Draco said sharply like a knife.
"No! Merlin, no. I wanted to talk to you about our relationship and that I think it's time to give up the secrecy. I want to be with you in public, hold hands with you and kiss you whenever I want, without looking for a hiding place or making an appointment with an owl just so we can meet up." He drew in a breath of air and nervously bit his lip. "I mean it's almost two years now and the war is over. Would that be alright for you?"
Now looking at the haughty boy in front of her, she again wondered why Slytherin’s always worked in a roundabout way. She knew that the blond had changed but it seemed hard for him to let go of the mask he was used to wearing when interacting with strangers.
Thinking about his mother, Draco noticed an old letter that had accidentally flown beneath his bed. He picked it up and sat down while unfolding the thin parchment.
Draco perked himself up on an elbow. “No. Honestly no. I know there’s a lot of biphobics out there who spew bullshit about the person not being able to choose and always going to want the opposite sex but I don’t believe in that. You love who you want to love and if you choose to love me then I trust that you’re not going to ditch me for a chick. Plus, I’ll keep you so satisfied in bed you’re not going to want or need anyone else.” Draco wiggle his eyebrows making Harry laughed. Draco loved that sound and enjoyed being the reason behind it. He settled back down and snuggled back up.
Draco bit his lip. “Yeah. I regret calling Hermione a mudblood. I also regret the way I introduced myself to you in first year. Spouting ideas on social hierarchy and demeaning Weasley. No wonder you didn’t accept my offer of friendship.”
Draco sighed, exasperated. “Stop being so mature! But fine yeah I’m am all down for that. Relationship, marriage, kids!”
“Don’t I get to decide that?” Harry’s eyes darted to Draco’s lips and back to his grey eyes.
“Sixth year???” Draco’s was sincerely shocked. “Tell me how can the golden boy of the wizarding world  be interested in a death eater?”
“Yeah, I don’t care.”
“Well I get that you’re stuck here and would like to go back to your time but I would also like to not die if that’s possible.”
“Hey Ron, is Hermione around?”
-_-_-_-_-
“What do you care! Look, like I said I’m sorry I kissed you. I’m a coward Harry. Always have been. You know that’s a fact, you’ve witnessed me run away during the wars. I’m sorry, I had one foolish moment of bravery.  I won’t do it again. Forget it ever happened.” Draco went to close the door but Harry blocked him.
“Are you done?” Hermione asked. Ron, who seemed to now notice the scalding look she had on her face nodded to say yes. Hermione returned her attention to Draco and Harry. “How long did you say it’s been since we were obliviated?” she asked, getting down to the important matter at hand.
“You going to try to poison me Malfoy?” Harry joked.
As she stood in place confused, he offered to take her wand and suggested she take a seat. She did so trying to organize her jumbled thoughts.
“I’m sorry Draco.” She did look sad herself. “Maybe we should erase your memory as well.”
“Can we skip research today and just learn about each other’s deep dark secrets?” Draco asked.
Draco remembered how much it hurt to gain new memories once he was back so he could sympathise. “I’m not interested in having either of you tortured,” he told Harry and Hermione.
“Draco?”, the soft voice pulled him from his thoughts. He looked up from the headstone to see a puffy eyed Ginny looking at him. “Draco, we’re going back to the Burrow for tea. We have the portkeys waiting.”
“Potter, one of the do’s and don’ts was to not let anyone know you’re from the future. This clearly went out the window when it comes to you but perhaps we should keep it between us. I rather return to my time with my sanity intact.”
This knowledge relieved Draco. “What are we suppose to do with it then? Isn’t there some low-level detective you could throw on this? Waste that person’s time instead of ours.”
Harry gave him a look.
“Was it worth it?” Draco asked.
Everyone stayed quiet for a bit until Ron snorted.
Harry closed his eyes and shut them tight. This was too much. Draco made a move to go comfort him, but Hermione put her hand up stopping him.
“Draco?” Harry had woken up and entered the bathroom in search of Draco.
Harry looked at the man standing before him. “Draco -”
“Oh lay off it. He was gorgeous and obsessed with Quidditch. Of course I was going to like him! Your turn. Let’s see…what could I ask…I can ask anything?”
“Harry pay attention to my breathing. Breath with me. In. Out. Slowly.”
Draco rolled around under the blankets feeling comfortable and content. He told himself he would not dwell on the future today and would simply enjoy his time with Harry.
“Well mainly because they always get found and arrested by the authority. It is even more illegal to go into the future than it is to go back. Plus, they didn’t have Hermione.”
Harry wrapped his arms around him and held tight.
He found Harry in the hallway.
Eventually Draco checked the time. Almost 2am. He didn’t want to go to bed, scared of what his dreams would bring. He wanted to be with Harry. Needed to feel close to him. He got up and walked over to floo and drunkenly called out GRIMMAULD PLACE.
“Come here,” Harry proposed, tugging on Draco who got up and sat in his lap, nuzzling his head in the crook of his neck for comfort.
Harry’s breathing went back to normal gradually. Draco didn’t press him, taking his time reminding him to take deep breaths in and out. Once his breathing was semi-steady, Harry twisted around to nuzzle his head in the crook of Draco’s neck.
“Then why are you back?”
“Yeah. Friends. Just leave it will you.”
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, you guessed it. Alright your turn, who was your first?”
“Draco, come on. There’s just way too much banter between the two of you. It’s obvious it’s to cover up your feelings. It’s also obvious that there’s something happening between yourself and Harry from my time.”
Turning them to look at their spine, he took in the titles. Some were specifically about time travelling, some were about magical items such as time turners. One was specifically called Theories of poppycock magic. This last title, Draco read out loud.
This is why he had avoided telling Harry how he felt for so long. This pain of rejection. Knowing you put yourself out there and were denied affection. Oh Merlin! He had kissed Harry Potter who had not kissed him back. How was he ever going to face him again? Oh and of course Harry would tell all his friends. How they would laugh at poor, pathetic Draco. He needed to quit his job. Maybe move to France or Italy. Or even Canada.
"I thought you liked being famous," Draco asked surprisedly and dabbed his face with a handkerchief.
He watched with furious eyes as the Slytherin’s' left the hall. He tried to will Draco to look at him but the blond had his head bowed low and stared stubbornly in front of him.
"Who wasn’t what?" Ron asked as he sat down beside Hermione and placed a kiss on her cheek. "I asked Harry if Malfoy was hexed this morning since he looked distressed earlier."
"Can we do something to help in this situation?" he asked haggardly. "I don't know. Maybe we can try and talk to Malfoy. Explain to him-" she broke off while shaking her bushy head.
"Oh wow!" Pansy exclaimed. "So, you liked him for what? Seven years now?" she asked, amazed.
"Can I help you?” Granger asked, shoving the book she had been reading to the side.
The Slytherin's breath came erratically as the slight sting ebbed away. He growled at the Gryffindor but Harry only smirked at him and leaned back to get one of the vials he brought earlier.
"Malfoy?" Harry squeaked, remembering the sodding parchment of this morning and the weird behavior of the Slytherin. "Why would you ask about him?"
After Draco had himself calmed down, he had snuck out of the castle. Thickly clad, he sat by the shore of the Black Lake and watched the small waves, the Giant Squid made in the far distance, crash against the pebbled shore.
"Malfoy are you alright?"
"Sorry, about that," Harry said remorsefully. "Did you talk about Herbology?"
Ron hung back between some bookshelves in the library and watched the drama unfold before his bright-blue eyes.
Harry nodded again. He just couldn't open his mouth because McGonagall's carefully chosen words had brought tears to his eyes and he had to look away from her.
, as if he needed a bit to let it sink in, that his best friend was gay.
Draco screamed hoarsely as lightning flashed behind his tightly squeezed shut eyes. Harry's thrusts hit spot on every single time. Spit was trickling into the cushion beneath Draco's open mouth. When Harry pulled back, Draco's channel clenched of its own accord, trying to hold him inside, and then he could just breathe and moan with every forward motion of his boyfriend. It felt amazing, almost otherworldly and Draco wanted it to go on and yet never stop.
Harry could almost see what Ron was thinking. "No, mate. I don't and never did check you out," he sighed, reassuring his friend that he wasn't on the list of potential partners for him.
Harry groaned as a beam of sunlight shone directly into his face through the window and woke him from his fitful slumber. It was his third weekend back at Hogwarts for his eight-year and he had hoped that he could have a lie-in but the damn sunrise seemed to have other plans for him, as much as the imposing owl that sat perched on the windowsill and knocked her beak urgently against the glass.
Pansy had seen Potter fleeing the hall and shot a gleeful gaze in Draco's direction. The blond Slytherin looked like he was about to storm off after the Gryffindor. Blaise had to hold him back at his arm so he wouldn't actually do it. "Blaise let me go," Draco hissed and tried to fetch his arm back. "No, you will stay and let him feel how it hurts to be mocked. We're Slytherin's Draco. We will not let it go, not when we were played badly." Pansy nodded in agreement and Draco let himself plop down on his seat again with a sigh.
"This is certainly different from all the other times we used this room," he breathed amazed, feeling the silky texture of the bedcovers.
Draco groaned in surprise and excitement and Harry seized the opportunity and plunged his tongue greedily into Draco's mouth, twisting and licking the walls of Draco’s mouth and tongue.
"Oh, just so. I saw him running out of the hall as if a Nundu was on his heels and vanishing into the boy's loo. He looked distressed." She paused and shot him a measuring look. "He didn’t get hexed again, didn’t he?"
"You like when I watch you," Harry stated hoarsely as his hands followed the path he had kissed down, up again, and came to a rest at Draco's nipples. "Yes," Draco hissed through clenched teeth as he felt a blush creeping over his whole body. Salazar, this was not their first time, but Harry showed Draco the same loving tenderness as then. His heart soared with love and he would admit to anything, if only it would make Harry go on faster.
"That's because it is a secret, Ron," Harry said, feeling shy and afraid. His feelings were all over the place, standing before their inquisition was so utterly nerve-wracking, his face flushed in embarrassment.
"Listen to me Malfoy!" Harry screamed. "All I said to Ron was a lie and what I said to you was the truth, I love you!"
Pansy bit her lip. She wanted to murder Potter for hurting Draco in such a way, but she didn’t say the vicious words that lay on her tongue and caressed Draco's arm up and down, looking steadily into his bright silver eyes. "I'm so sorry for you, Draco, but I don't know. Do you still love him?"
Harry rolled his eyes at him. "I hate giving speeches. That is one of the most terrible things right after people staring at me all the time."
Minerva smiled slightly as she thought back to how she had caught the two boys tightly embraced in a remote alcove when she was searching the school for injured people after the fight.
The still-fragile friendship that was building between the six of them persisted with lots of teasing, banter, and laughter and Draco wondered how it was after everything that had happened between them that it came so light and without malice.
"I'm sorry to hear that, Harry. But as you know, this is no reason to neglect your education and health. I hope the dispute between the two of you will settle soon and I expect you to turn your attention back to your lessons until it's resolved," she said not unkindly and pointed to the cookies. "Take another biscuit."
"Erm, I already did," Harry said ruefully.
"You can fucking bet on it. I will hex him into next week. That sodding half-blood asshole," Pansy hissed, her eyes glinting dangerously.
I warmly greet all readers and come to you today with the hottest news, fresh out of Hogwarts. It happened in the Great Hall of our lovely school; on no better day than Valentine's Day, we witnessed how Harry Potter, the hero of the wizarding world and defeater of Voldemort, finally proposed marriage to his long time lover Draco Lucius Malfoy.
They pulled back for much-needed air when Zabini let out a low chuckle. Harry eyed the dark-skinned Slytherin suspiciously until Draco suddenly thwacked Harry painfully over the head. "What the fuck, Potter?" he growled, grey eyes blazing in the moonlight that shone around them.
"You better not hurt him again, Potter," Pansy bellowed over everyone else's gossip.
"As if. I hate being famous, now even more than before," Harry answered and bit his lower lip. He really needed to stop looking at Draco or he would certainly do something stupid, like pulling one of the loosely hanging sweaty, slightly wavy, strands of blond hair behind Draco's ear. His fingers itched to just do it, to get a feel of the soft-looking silvery strands. But he pried his attention back to the pot to fill in the earth.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. "He‘s just too squeamish," Pansy chided.
"Maybe someone should go after him and apologize," Hermione threw in her two cents sternly. And Ron finally closed his mouth.
Ron whimpered and tried to shake his head while nodding at the same time, which looked kind of funny. Harry began to laugh, "I know this is too much for you at the moment, but thanks for listening mate.” He clapped Ron on the shoulder and got up from his bed. "Maybe you should now go on and apologize to Hermione. Ah! And please don’t say anything about me or Malfoy yet, I need to work this out myself and will tell her then,” Harry grinned and left the room.
Draco was on his way to the library. If in search of the frizzy-haired girl it was the first address to take a look. Surely she was buried in tons of books again. But before he could reach his destination, an owl dropped something before his feet and flew away with a hoot.
"Oh no, you don’t!” Harry growled, "You won’t utter one word to Pansy or anyone about this.”
"Potter?" Blaise said pensively and added slightly bored, "That really doesn't surprise me."
They were currently jostled up in the library writing frantically on their parchments. Hermione sighed exasperated and swished a stray strand of her fussy hair out of her face. "Done,” she breathed relieved, and smirked at the pile of paper to her left.
When they got up Hermione buried her face in the crook of Pansy’s neck, still refusing to look at anyone, while the Slytherin girl cackled wildly and put the scroll into her robes.
"Is that the reason you said those awful things about him? Because Ron has a fucking attitude with him?" she asked aghast and appalled at his stupidity.
Harry shook his head, "No, he wasn’t.” He contemplated telling her about the parchment clutched in Malfoy’s hand, but decided against it. It reminded him of his version, not suitable for minors, and he didn't want to start with that.
Harry was livid, his green eyes boring holes into Zabini's head and only Hermione's fast casting of a sticking charm held him in his place. He wanted to shout and rage but Ron had stuffed a tart in his already open mouth to shut him up, so that Hermione could reprimand him, to not make a scene in the Great Hall.
Hermione eyed him warily, "What's on your mind, Harry?" She gnawed at her lip, seemingly contemplating if she should cancel the sticking charm. Instead, she cast a
"Yes. Pansy has, for whatever reason, disfigured my immaculate self with nail varnish and I want it gone," he said stiltedly in a haughty tone and winced inwardly. That didn't come out the way he wanted. He needed to remember that she wasn’t the enemy anymore, had never been in fact and that he needed her help. So, he breathed in again and whispered, "Please."
Since the waves had settled, neither of them had touched on the issue of coming out again. But Harry knew it would come back on the table sooner or later.
"No, I'm not stalking Malfoy, and you know that he was up to something bad back then," Harry groaned. He wanted to pull his hair out. This was frustrating. He thought that he had diverted the attention away from Draco, but now Hermione had sprung on that train yet again. "And no, I'm not meeting up with him," Harry huffed, getting annoyed. "It isn't that simple," he muttered.
Harry couldn't take it any longer. Abruptly he jumped up, mumbled an apology to his friends, and fled to the nearest toilet. If he was going to break down, he didn't want to do it in front of all of his classmates.
"Well," she continued, "I mean to remember that the two of you had a good relationship... shall we say, a very close relationship to each other. Am I correct in assuming that this is no longer the case?"
"Huh?" made Draco, staring at her in disbelief. "How could you ..."
"I have to agree. When Harry dated Ginny it never felt so natural as the flirting they just did. But most shocking for me is still that they didn't seem to notice that they were doing it," Hermione replied perplexed. "Like when we found them on the way to Hogsmeade, they didn't seem uncomfortable in this obviously compromising position until we showed up. It rather seemed like they enjoyed it immensely."
Pansy had told Hermione that she planned to get revenge on Draco for having this sexy mental image of Harry and him seared into her mind and that she would find a way to make him pay. Hermione had mentioned that Draco certainly wasn’t the one who wrote that but the Slytherin girl had only waved her hand. "If you would have been in the first row to Draco’s rants about Potter for the past six years, you would also want to get revenge somehow.”
Harry scanned over it and his jaw dropped almost to the ground. What the hell was that? A shiver ran down his back as he began to read from the top again.
The nightmare had left him shaken to his bones but the fresh cold air ease his mind and he could think clearer. He knew that after all the bad things that had happened that particular night brought something good... no fantastic with it.
"I have liked him since first year and we were together for the last two. Anything else you want to know?" Harry hissed sarcastically, tears springing suddenly to his eyes.
"Okay, I will talk to them, just give me some time," Harry said and then suddenly grinned. "Are you up for some more snogging and maybe something more?" he asked, cheekily with a raised eyebrow.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to calm down. "You mean to say that I need ⅓ of the Golden Trio to remove this?" he exasperatedly asked. "Yepp," Pansy answered, letting the ‘P’ pop at the end.
Hermione wondered if Malfoy knew about how Harry had grown up, but in the end, it didn't matter. What Malfoy was doing here was absolutely degrading.
To Harry it felt like an eternity, standing there like this and yet not long enough when Malfoy cleared his throat and stepped back from him. He instantly missed those long, lean fingers in his hair and involuntarily did a step forward as if his body was begging to be touched again.
Draco enjoyed the warmth of his lover's hug a little longer before gently pulling back from Harry's arms. "Harry, we need to talk," he said in a serious tone. He had to do this now before he backed down. Harry winced, "You don't want to break up with me, do you?" he asked fearfully, his green eyes wavering slightly with the start of tears.
Draco snorted, "You haven't really developed linguistically since our first year at school. Shall I tutor you?" he asked teasingly.
"Fuck Draco, all this shite just slipped out because I felt so stressed out," Harry said, pulling at his hair.
"Yeah, I don't think that will go down well. He didn't talk to Harry, he wouldn't want to talk to us," Ron said, giving up on that idea.
So Harry had taken her advice to heart, even if he was absolutely miserable in writing letters, especially when it came to his feelings, and had written to Draco.
Harry squirmed in his seat. Hearing Draco, constantly groan and the word
"No, Ron,” Harry said, getting angry. "I don’t think that’s just a phase and I’m not confused. Sure, I dated Ginny but that doesn’t mean that I’m straight.” Harry deflated. "It’s just … what I feel for him is … so real and exciting and I … can’t describe it well, but it never felt like that with Ginny. Sorry.” Harry didn’t know why he apologized now, but he was just so …
Draco's sobs only got louder and after a while, an almost incomprehensible string of words fell from his mouth. "Potter ... lied to me ... I'm not his type ... broke up ... him."
Hermione smiled shortly at him and then drew her eyebrows together. "Are you planning to tell Malfoy?" she asked softly.
Draco stilled in rolling his socks up and snapped his head around. "He did?"
Draco breathed heavily. He could feel an enormous pressure building behind his rib cage. It was as if his heart was crying out, threatening to overflow him with sorrow. He still loved Harry, no matter what the Gryffindor had said about him, these feelings don't just go away overnight. And what he was doing to Harry now, it just felt so wrong to him, but Blaise was right, he was a Slytherin and he was cunning and hurting and so fucking in love that he just couldn't forgive Harry. He didn't want to hurt him excessively, but he couldn't just accept what had happened either.
"Shhh, Darling, calm a bit down. I don't understand," Pansy said and lay down beside Draco, pulling him closer to her body all the while rubbing his back.
"In a way," Hermione smiled sheepishly, glancing at Draco whose face was a single question mark. "Ehem," Hermione cleared her throat, "is your hand alright, Harry?"
Draco cursed and called Blaise all kinds of unflattering things but to no avail. His soon to be ex-friend sat on his chest, laughing like a mad man and held his wrists in a death grip while Pansy painted whistling Draco’s nails. Draco didn’t know the song and it didn’t matter anyway. What mattered was that he didn’t want his nails painted. "You vile imbecile beings. Go away!” he shouted, which made Blaise laugh even more. " Don’t be like that, Draco. Pansy needs to test her new Charms work. What better way to rekindle an old friendship?”
Going red-faced, Ron shot her a glare. "Who told you that nickname?”
He thought to himself that he could do this friendship thing the Gryffindors had offered.
was pretty clear," she cackled and smirked at him.
Harry glanced at his slowly waking friend, feeling the red hot burn of embarrassment creeping over his cheeks. He hoped with all his heart that this was a one time joke to never be repeated. He couldn’t even imagine how Ron would react if he were the one to read something like that.
Harry had even started stalking the blonde again, much as he did during their sixth year. His invisibility cloak was now stored permanently in the inner pocket of his school robes so that he had it always on hand. It made his heart heavy by what he saw. Draco seemed to get on very well with Zabini. The two laughed a lot together and the dark-skinned Slytherin usually put his arm around Draco as he whispered something in his ear. Draco seemed to be finished with Harry and was facing a new future in which Harry had no place anymore.
Hermine looked at Ron, rolling her eyes at her clueless boyfriend. "Really Ron, what don’t you get?" she asked incredulously. "Bloody hell, Harry! Malfoy? Really?" he bellowed, blanching.
"Woah, calm down mate. It isn’t as if he‘ll keel over any moment," Ron groaned exasperatedly.
"Not directly, no. It's just... they were agonizing each other for years and now it could be a romance novel my mother loves to read." Ron sighed and shoved his hands into his robe pockets.
Harry swallowed hard when he saw Ginny's hopeful smile. "Erm, Ginny ..." he pulled away from her touch and looked at her apologetically. "I'm sorry, Gin, I don't like you that way and I'm already in love with someone." Harry couldn't look into her eyes and fixed his gaze on Hagrid's back entrance.
The blonde Slytherin had an increasingly beguiling effect on Harry's emotional life and he wasn't exactly sure what to think of it.
Ron whistled through teeth in appreciation when he saw his mate standing in front of him. Harry looked good. Even Ron had to admit that. "Malfoy will be thrilled," he said as the other boys had left the room.
Harry groaned, feeling awkward. Draco and his loose mouth would one day be his death, he was sure of that. How the Slytherin could talk about sex so casually was beyond him. He himself always felt somehow cornered and uncomfortable when the subject came up. Especially just thinking about Draco Malfoy and sex in one sentence made Harry feel unexpectedly warm in his lower regions. And since reading those sodding stories, it was more often than not that a certain blond Slytherin was the main actor in his thoughts.
Harry groaned and trickled the content of the vial over Draco's ass and his swollen cock. He tugged fast two times at his own cock before he spread Draco's buttocks once again and pushed the tip inside. They both moaned as they finally connected in the most intimate way possible. Sweat pooled in the small of Draco's back where he was bent at just the right angle for Harry's cock to hit his sweet-spot when the Gryffindor snapped his hips forward and sunk completely in.
Harry gulped audibly as Draco's minty breath washed over his heated face. Unconsciously he leaned closer to get more of Draco's intoxicating smell of Orange blossoms, mint, and honey.
"Erm, I need to … do something. Things… I mean… see you later,” Potter stammered and was gone in a heartbeat.
"Ha! Slipped out my ass!" Draco scoffed. He narrowed his eyes and came close to Harry’s face. "We are nothing, Potter. Get your sorry ass back to your sodding friends and leave me fuck alone. We are through," he spat with hard eyes. Then he turned around, held his head high, and left.
At his back, Draco shook his head to clear up his besotted mind. He still felt Potter’s unruly soft locks clinging to his fingers like a lover that just wouldn’t let him go. Potter’s scent had been truly intoxicating. A mix of honey-scented broom polish, chocolate, and cinnamon. Potter smelled like a fucking Christmas cookie and it did things to Draco’s stomach that had absolutely nothing to do with any known illness.
"That's just a joke, isn't it?"
Ron wanted to wretch. There he left his best friends alone for a few weeks and they managed to get deeply involved with Malfoy of all people. He no longer understood the world. How could they both be so friendly to him? After all, he had said and done in the past, one would think there was no coming back from that. But here, right in front of him, it unfolded to his utter bewilderment.
Draco’s heart sprung into his throat. How could Potter so casually touch him as if they were the best of friends? He clenched his jaw and looked up. "Don’t-,” the sentence died on his lips as a hand was thrust before his eyes.
The other faction was the exact opposite. This group consisted mostly of Gryffindors, also Ravenclaws and Huffelpuffs had joined them, but they helped everyone who needed help with a few exceptions. Those being Zabini, Parkinson, Goyle, and Malfoy.
Hermione and her backhanded methods. He eyed her warily.
Ron paced around the room he shared with Harry. He hadn’t talked much with his friend but now he wanted to apologize. In the past few weeks, he had observed his fellow students and noticed a few shocking things he couldn’t deny anymore.
Draco took Harry's hand and pulled him out of the Great Hall. Running down the corridor with his boyfriend in tow, he stopped at the next alcove and pushed Harry into it so he could kiss his future husband more privately. As the kisses got hotter and heavier, Harry stopped Draco and growled lasciviously, "Let’s go to the Room of Requirement." Draco smirked and nodded, having just had the same idea.
"He's just my type."
So now he got it and he wanted to apologize. The last few weeks without his friends had been horrible. He missed the jokes with Harry and even more the kisses and cuddles from Hermione. And even if he loved his sister, he didn’t want to hang around her and watch her play Quidditch, when he, himself, couldn’t since 8th years weren’t allowed to be on a house team. His thick-headedness only got so far.
When Blaise walked into the room, Pansy waved to him to come over. Draco had fallen into a light slumber, completely exhausted after his emotional turmoil. She quietly explained to Blaise what had occurred and it was evident on his dark face that Potter should watch his back. They both nodded to each other, no further words needed as Draco jerked awake.
"Hermione," Harry whined and looked at her pleadingly. "I can't do this right now. I just ... I fucked up, okay? But it would be my imminent death if you tell Ron now. Please, keep quiet about it. I will tell him eventually," Harry sighed out.
The breakup with Harry had brought old, hurtful memories back to life and he cried bitterly into his pillow trying not to wake Blaise, who was sleeping in the bed next to his.
"What was that supposed to have been? The two have the hots for each other, that's obvious," Pansy exclaimed superior, throwing her hands in the air. "Not even you can be that thick in the head, Weasley."
Draco's silver eyes were big and wide. His mouth opened and closed as he stared at the beautiful ring Harry had chosen for him. He just couldn't grasp the reality of it; Harry had just proposed marriage to him in front of the whole school.
Hermione smirked at him, mirth bleeding into her eyes. She held out her hand. "Show me," she demanded, gesturing at Draco’s hands.
She seemed to be talking to someone, but Draco couldn't tell who was standing there since the person was behind the curve of the house.
Harry looked slightly annoyed at Pansy at the stupid comment but then decided not to start an argument. He was tired of arguing, except when he bickered with Draco, which was a lot of fun. This was partly because the usual cutting edge was missing and partly because it was Draco. They didn't really seem to know any other communication than teasing each other.
A gentle, strong hand had gripped the back of his head and kept him from splitting his skull. The Slytherin's other hand was on his hip and held him upright, while Malfoy's slim body was just too close and exuded an incredible heat.
he thought in bewilderment and thrust his hands to her. "Please, get me out of my misery,” he pleaded and hoped that the blush on his cheekbones wasn’t too obvious.
Harry sighed, "I know, Ginny. We were together for almost two years. But I fucked up and now it's over and I just can't ... I can't do this, Gin. When I see him with Zabini, I just ... I want to hurt that slimy git so badly sometimes for laying his hands on Draco, I have the feeling I will go bonkers soon." Harry pressed the balls of his hands against his eyes, pushing up his glasses in the process.
"What? No! Merlin! Why did I have to ask?" exclaimed Ron, pulling his head between his shoulders.
"Yeah his hair is awful and he has always bullied us," Ron said scoffing. "His voice is annoying as hell and it grates on my nerves, plus his arrogant sneering is gross and he thinks he’s all hot stuff, but he’s totally not. He certainly isn't my type at all," Harry spat, lying through his teeth, gritting them. He couldn't believe he just said that and he instantly wanted to take it all back. He loved Draco's voice and his looks, simply Draco as a whole was completely his type. He opened his mouth, come hell or high water, he would make this right, but he was cut off when Hermione got between them with a shrill voice.
It just couldn't be. Was he that easy to replace? What actually allowed Zabini to touch his Draco and joke with him? It just wasn't fair.
Harry was frantically searching his pockets. His hands dove into the ones at the front of his worn-out jeans. Nothing. He patted over the back pockets. Nothing. He even glimpsed into the breast pocket of his grey button-down which he wore beneath his auburn Weasley jumper. Again, nothing.
He had been pacing the room for the last half hour and just began to wonder where Harry was when suddenly the door flew open and his best friend fiercely strode in. Harry threw himself on his bed and pulled his pillow over his head. Ron heard mumbling and cursing but couldn’t make out what was said.
"For how long?" Ron asked and his hands tightened even more on Harry’s shoulders, hurting him in the process.
Shortly before he rounded the corner, he whirled back and shouted in a furious rage, "I know now how you really feel about me, Potter. Why did you even owl last night? What about how you screamed my name while I fucked you, while you begged me for more. Are you blaming that on my controlling habits, too? Does it make you sleep better at night? Does it feel good to tell me you love me and then go and laugh behind my back, at how stupid I am for believing you? Taking my first time from me? Fuck you, Potter! It's over for good."
"I have no idea, Pansy," Draco whispered back with a groan to his voice. His boyfriend looked so good; he wanted to gobble him up where he stood.
"Oh God, Harry..." Draco moaned loudly. He couldn't begin to describe what Harry's tongue did to him. He felt so vulnerable like this, but at the same time it was utterly amazing and hot and his balls drew up, initiating his pending orgasm in a rush. But no matter how hard his prick twitched, it could only leak pre-cum. Draco trashed and moaned to no avail. The thing Harry had put around his genitals before prevented him to find completion.
Draco arched one of his elegant eyebrows and opened it, silver eyes flying over the content with growing excitement. Harry was brimming with anticipation until Zabini snatched the parchment, read over it, and reduced it to ashes with an
With that mindset, he waited until Hermione was done vanishing Malfoy’s nail varnish and the git was gone. It would take some time for him to think in different terms about the guy, but for now, this was fine.
Hermione snorted, "Has your life become so boring that you see the need to kill your tastebuds?” She chuckled at his antics and cleaned his bowl out with a swish of her wand. "Here, now you can do it right”
when Harry opened his mouth and it was a good measure for the rant that he bellowed out. "I can't believe him! How is it that he can simply show the cold shoulder to me after everything? And then that Zabini git, with his hands all over him.”
Everyone placed their order, the Slytherins a little more reluctantly than Hermione and Ron when Madam Rosmerta came to the table with her mouth pinched.
But his mind certainly began to wander, wondering how those nimble fingers would feel on his skin. Dipping low into the valleys of his body, mapping out every corner, flicking over the sensitive patches which could be ticklish or arousing.
"And if not you will go with us and the Golden Trio to Hogsmeade next weekend," Pansy smirked as Draco froze in the door. "Pray tell, dear Pansy, why I should do something so insane."
Moving his hands through the masses as if he was dry-swimming, he pushed everything behind his seat and rescued his goblet from tumbling over.
He must have uttered a horrified sound at the first words because suddenly fate took its terrible course.
Draco’s eyes drew up in a curious glance as his boyfriend headed his way. Harry looked hot, his clothes were obviously new, and his hair was actually done for once. God, he wanted to run his hand through it and mess it up.
Draco gaped at them. Was he really that obvious? Then again, these were Slytherin’s he was talking to; he should have known that they would find him out.
Silently, Draco got up and swept the fresh tears away from his cold skin. The memory was still one of his most treasured ones, but now it had a bitter after taste. He couldn't believe that Harry had acted at that moment in the bathroom or in the infirmary. But he had said so many hurtful things, that it overshadowed the beginning of the change in their relationship.
He made a mental note to find out who wrote these stories. He wasn’t some fictional character they could abuse like they wanted to. He was real and if those stories would make the round it would be utterly embarrassing and destructively for him.
Harry nodded and shrugged at the same time, what else could he have done? The fall-out with Draco weighed heavily on him. He doubted the Headmistress would show sympathy for a heartbroken student if he was risking his health and schooling over it.
Harry collapsed onto Draco's back. His body felt boneless as he pressed a needy kiss against the corner of his Slytherin's mouth. "I love you," he whispered breathlessly and carded his hand through the sweaty strands of Draco's blond hair before they both drifted off to a peaceful sleep wrapped up in each other's arms.
"Wow!" Ginny breathed out and rubbed her hand against her forehead. "I never would have guessed. And Malfoy?" She looked at him curiously and when he nodded, it suddenly felt like scales had fallen from her eyes. "Oh, my Merlin!" she exclaimed. "That's why he was so upset when Hagrid took you to the schoolyard during the war. That's why he looked for you so desperately after the battle. I thought he ... I don't know what I was thinking, but certainly not that." Ginny smiled at Harry, "He must love you too, Harry. I've never seen him as desperate, concerned, and upset as that day."
His heart was beating frantically as he checked one last time that the small box was still in his pocket. Then he nodded to Ron and Hermione, who both crossed their fingers for him, and headed for the Slytherin table.
"Thanks, Hermione.” Harry grinned at his friend and this time poured milk over his flakes. "You seemed absentminded. Did something happen before I was here?” Hermione asked and put a teabag in her cup with hot water.
Hermione shot Ron an incredulous look. "Really, Ron?" she said annoyed and diverted her attention to Harry again.
Hermione got her wits together faster and eyed him curiously. "Oh, alright then. I don't have an issue with you being gay."
Laughing at that and smiling all over his face, Harry cleared the bathroom and opened his trunk. Thoughtfully, he took out the small, velvety black box and stowed it in the pocket of his emerald-green vest before throwing on his school robe.
A certain kind of cold began to seep into his broken heart. The one that Harry had once thawed and made his own, going back to his original state, just even more abused than it had been. Draco's old mask of cold indifference slipped on like an old well-loved glove. His heart hardened and froze. He swore to himself that he would make Potter pay. That he would rip Potter's heart out and trample all over it, burn it to ashes, and laugh when the remains shattered in the wind of his wrath.
He closed his gaping mouth with a click and the crease between his eyebrows intensified as he saw her smile falter.
When after a while no answer came, he carefully ventured forward and sat on the edge of Harry's bed. "Alright, mate?" he asked when Harry squirmed on the bed and groaned again.
"Draco, Draco, Draco … mine," he moaned as his rhythm began to falter. He was so fucking close, he just couldn't hold back anymore.
It had been clear to him what would be coming his way when the Wizengamot announced his parole after Potter had spoken his testimony in favor of Draco and his mother. He had to finish his education, wasn’t allowed to leave the country for three years and had to volunteer for a Ministry-approved cause after he finished school. His parents had to pay war reparations, with his father going to Askaban and his mother being under house arrest, Draco thought that they had been lucky with the outcome of their trials. Having lost all respect for his father, Draco was glad the man couldn’t breathe down his neck at every turn. His mother was kind of fired up to remodel Malfoy Manor and ride it off all Dark Magic that had infused into it when the Dark Lord was their unwelcome guest.
“Merlin, give me strength,” the ginger muttered and set his piercing glare on his girlfriend who was currently working with Nott on the assignment Professor Sprout had given them.
Draco dared for a moment to gaze after the Gryffindor and his eyes naturally found their way to Potter's perfect bum.
"All for you, my Highness. Do you like it?" Harry asked and smiled when Draco nodded. Draco sat down and let himself fall back. "It's brilliant," the blond breathed and moved his arms up and down beside his body as if he wanted to make a snow angel.
Harry pulled back a little more, held Draco by the upper arms, and sighed heavily. "Yes, I know what you mean. I've already thought about it, but I still feel torn. I don't like this secrecy either and would love to be with you in public. Just Hermione and Ron ... I have absolutely no idea how they would react to that. The Weasley's ... we don't even want to start, they are still getting over Fred's death.
Ron still sat frozen on Harry’s bed. His mind was reeling. He couldn’t wrap his mind around what his best friend had just dropped on him. After a while, he got up and walked as if in a trance to the door. He needed to find Hermione. Now!
"Harry..." Draco breathed beneath him, "Just go on. You're driving me crazy."
In the little box in front of him, embedded in dark green velvet, lay a very fine, noble ring. Two snakes, one made of silver and the other made of rose gold, were intertwined and bit each other's tail. The ring was detailed down to the smallest scale and the eyes of the two snakes were completed with small silver and green gemstones, reminding him of their own eyes.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked and started to roll around to look at what Harry was doing, but a hand to his back stopped him and pushed him back down. "Just wait, I have something special planned for you."
"Do you want to tell us about him?" she asked gingerly, rubbing her hand over his upper arm.
A heart-wrenching sob escaped his lungs as he felt Hermione’s hand on his shoulder. She directed him gently back to the Gryffindor tower, cooing gently words into his ear to keep him going without breaking down. He later couldn’t tell how he made it back. He only felt hollow and empty.
Harry chuckled, as he pulled Draco's entrance wider apart, and began fucking his boyfriend with his tongue. He could only guess what he was doing to Draco with it, but the Slytherin's reactions spoke for themselves. He had never had Draco as willing and so close to begging as he was now, it did terribly wonderful things to his own hard cock.
Hermione raised her eyebrows at him, worry creeping into her eyes, as she saw his agitated behaviour. "What is it, Harry? You know you can tell us everything," she nodded reassuringly.
Draco was a mess. Since his breakup with Harry, he had let himself go down the drain. His things were strewn everywhere and Blaise was getting on his nerves by complaining about it. He felt heartbroken for Salazar's sake, couldn't he be left alone. Sighing, he bent down to take his dirty clothes to the hamper, and then he decided to organize his things anew.
Draco groaned again. "Blaise! Can you only think with your cock?” he hissed, shooting daggers at his friend.
Harry audibly swallowed the bite of his ginger biscuit. His mouth felt as dry as if he had been skidding through the desert on his stomach with his mouth open. He quickly grabbed one of the steaming teacups in order not to have to answer immediately. Taking small sips of the hot brew, he wondered if and how he should explain his behaviour to the Headmistress. He didn't really want to talk about the breakup with Draco, but he saw no way around not having to bring it up.
Ron had never liked Draco, given that the blond prat had been mostly beneath the waistline with his taunting. Yes, Draco was still a prat, but he was Harry's and he could only hope that Ron would get over it, given time.
This reporter had been wondering for a long time when it would finally come to this, as the two had been in a secret relationship for over two years with a minor hiccup this year. Luckily, they soon found their way back to each other. If you're at Hogwarts you might stumble over the lovebirds; Laughing, flirting, and teasing each other, both with bright smiles, as they run around the castle grounds playfully while holding hands.
Both boys looked at her bewildered. They never had thought that Hermione of all people would be concerned about Malfoy and above all curse in that manner. She huffed annoyed at them and glanced at Harry with sad eyes. He had the feeling he was falling apart. He had let himself be led into verbally abusing his boyfriend by Ron and the look Hermione gave him could fill one of those thick tomes she always had with her.
"Hello, Mal-Draco,” she said and looked curiously up at him, nodding to the seat.
When they didn't pass, his ears perked up when he heard Harry's voice. He was excited but also anxious. Would Harry now begin to reveal their secret to his friends? But soon everything in Draco's mind got muddled and a wave of ultimate hot anger burned through his guts.
Harry sighed, "Look I don’t know right now where this is going but I needed to get it off my chest and give you a slight warning at the same time that something might change in the future. Okay?”
At that time his feelings for Harry had gotten more and more out of hand. Even though he knew that it was incredibly dangerous, he couldn't distance himself from his own feelings. Not after Harry had confessed his love to him on that fateful day.
Draco's breath came easier with time. "I heard him talking to Granger and Weasley. The Weasel said mean things about me and Harry he-," Draco's voice broke as he remembered the vile things that had left Harry's mouth. "He said I'm not his type. That I'm too controlling and that whoever dated me must have a death wish, that I'm ugly-," his voice became so small at the confession, that Pansy had to strain her ears to make out the words.
"You certainly have a weird taste, Potter."
Draco moaned and wantonly pushed back against Harry's hands. He couldn't wait to feel Harry sink into him. But his Gryffindor boyfriend had other plans as he pulled away. Draco growled in protest. He heard the faint crackling of silk as Harry opened one of the boxes that he had previously placed on the foot of the bed.
"Ah, leave the Ferrett be. It’s none of our concern. The git had it coming," Ron mumbled between bites of his sausage. Harry glared at him, "You of all people should know how I think about that. I didn’t testify for him only to look the other way when he’s abused."
Harry wouldn't admit it, but he suddenly felt kind of nervous despite his previously shown bold behaviour. He wanted to make this reconciliation as perfect as possible, but it was like always. As soon as he got Draco to himself, willing and docile, his nerves ran away with him. The manner of the blonde Slytherin to simply let go and to express his wishes openly was so different from his otherwise so dominant nature.
"Maybe it’s something urgent," Hermione admonished.
"Yeah. Told everyone that you were excused and they should shove their prejudice up their arses. They don’t know what you’ve gone through. He certainly was passionate about it." Blaise smirked and waggled his eyebrows. "Maybe you‘ve now a chance to befriend him like you always wanted."
he thought and put the spoon in his mouth, cringing at the horrible taste.
He slowly walked down the path that was littered with wet leaves, carefully so that he did not slip or fall. His gaze drifted to the forbidden forest and a shudder ran down his spine as he remembered his time of being there with Harry in their first year. But that was in the past, like so many other things, and his mind strayed from the memory when he came closer to the hut.
"Salazar’s blue balls! Pansy, have you lost your mind? I can’t just walk up to her and kindly ask her to remove it. You know my history with her. She will hex me into next week."
Draco had similar fears about his father, and his closest friends were on the same side as him. He had no one he could confide in, that wouldn't think he had gone barking mad. It also didn't help that the Dark Lord and a bunch of the worst Death Eaters were living in his family's home at the time. Given that Draco and Harry had hated each other so passionately for the last five years, no one would suspect a thing. But in reality, they secretly had a massive crush on each other.
At some point at three o'clock in the morning, he finally fell asleep, a happy smile on his face when his last thought was on the surprised expression on his boyfriend's face, which he would hopefully make a pleasant surprise tomorrow.
Harry just stared at him, mouth slightly open. Draco was so near that Harry could count every single one of his pale lashes. His expressive eyes half-hidden by them looked silvery as he lifted Harry's hand to his mouth and lightly blew over the blisters.
Hermione must have seen his face fall. Her head spun around, her bushy hair flew all over the place and her eyes widened in shock. Next to Harry, Ron choked on his pumpkin juice and turned red. But Harry only noticed a bit of it all, as his eyes began to pierce and filled with tears against his will.
Ron had done a lot of thinking since the fall out with his friend and his girlfriend. He now knew what Hermione and Harry had been talking about when they said that Malfoy shouldn’t fall victim to bullying and that it got completely against what Harry believed and wanted to achieve.
"Oh, you need to go to Hermione to vanish it. I still haven’t got the remover spell down," Pansy said without looking up from her work on Blaise's hand.
Harry heard Blaise sigh resigned.
"Well, there was the war and we wanted to keep it a secret. It was a decision both of us made and it was fine then. But now we want to make it official that we are together. Harry wants to take it slow. His friends don’t even know that he is gay. So, I would appreciate it if you two don’t tell anyone just yet. I want this to work out, so please," Draco said with a pleading tone, hoping that his friends would understand how much he needed Harry.
"No, Draco. Just do what you've been doing so far. I think that's enough for me," Hermione replied and shook her head in amusement at his antics while getting up from her chair.
"Would someone care to explain to me what that was?" Ron asked Parkinson as they exited the greenhouse with Neville and Zabini.
"Hm, I don’t know. I think I heard him talking about traveling after school before he decides what to do as a profession.” She packed her books and papers away, and while waiting on Draco to finish she scrutinized him with a curious expression. "What do you want to do after school?” she asked.
"What happened?" Pansy asked in a whisper, giving him time to further calm down.
Back in the Great Hall, Ron glared daggers at Malfoy and Hermione had to hold herself back from not going over and breaking the blonde Slytherin's nose again. It couldn't be true. Yesterday he was still with Harry and today he was already attached to someone else's arm. Was Malfoy just taking the piss out of Harry, by trying to rub it in his face that he could be so easily replaced?
Hermione rolled her eyes and then smiled evilly at him. Draco watched her warily. "What?” he asked and tried to snatch his hands away from her grip. The next words out of her mouth send a warm shiver down his back.
Harry chuckled low in his throat. "That's another thing that makes you perfect for me since I like to watch you, and only you," he said and twisted Draco's nipples which were already as hard as pebbles.
Harry was too stunned and startled that he followed her to her office without a word. Once there, he looked around with cloudy eyes. Many of the little trinkets Dumbledore had collected were still there, even if they had been given a new place under the portrait of the former headmaster. Two hard-looking chairs stood in front of the dark desk behind which Minerva McGonagall now sat on a wing chair that was covered with red velvet. The ubiquitous tea set that stood on the left side of the table immediately started brewing fresh tea and a bowl of ginger biscuits hopped happily in Harry's direction. "Have a seat and take a biscuit, Mr. Potter. And if you would be so kind as to take off your cloak, I would love to see you, when I am speaking to you," she said in her brisk tone but the slight twitch of the corner of her mouth told Harry that she wasn't that mad at him.
Harry huffed a laugh and leaned back, a smirk beginning to play on his lips. "This is somehow fun if I’m not the one starring in it,” he said amused.
"It’s amazing charms work, Hermione,” said Potter and placed himself next to Draco.
Draco eyed the owl warily for a moment and then flushed bright red. "What is it?" Blaise asked curiously. "I seem to be the only one who doesn’t know what’s going on."
Harry squeaked unmanly and threw the parchment against the wall where it rolled lazily into a now rumbled roll again.
"Gin, really I..." Harry broke off and bit his lip thoughtfully, then revealed to her, what she would never have guessed. "I'm in love with Draco Malfoy."
Draco watched the stuttering dark-skinned boy with contemplating eyes. He wasn’t used to Blaise being anything other than straight forward and thus knew that his former friend was serious about his offer. He didn’t need to think much about this. Raising his chin, he stood up straight and walked over, placing a hand on the other boy’s shoulder. "I’m sorry, Blaise. I would like to be your friend again."
His eyes sought out the owl which flew hooting towards the owl tower. She looked vaguely familiar. He shrugged and unfurled the parchment and instantly regretted it. He had completely forgotten about the sodding parchment he had received three weeks into the term, but now held another one with a different story on it.
"What can you sometimes not believe?" Harry asked beside Pansy, making her squeal and almost slip on the autumn leaves which had fallen on the path. "Careful," Draco admonished as he caught her from behind and righted her to a safe stand. "Salazar, Potter! Don't frighten me like that," Pansy exclaimed, brushing down her robes to even out the wrinkles Draco's hands had left.
“At least the people that are dating you for the fame aren’t mentally messed up. Try dating people who want to be with you because you’re an ex-death eater.”
She arrived in her robes as it was a bit chilly out that day. “I’ve found a good place for us to do this is. It’s an isolated meadow deep in a farmer’s field. If you’re ready, I can apparate us there.”
“Ok,” Harry said sounding resolute. “So, we focus on how to get you back.”
“I think this has to be my choice and I’m ok going through it, but I don’t know what we would use to bring up emotional turmoil.”
They knew the item in question was held in the secure vault of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, specifically the controlled section. As an auror, Harry had access to the vault but to remove and illegal item he needed special permission. The permission had to be presented to the first keeper of the vault who granted access to the second keeper. The second keeper opened the vault door and walked you to the item requested where only her wands signature could release the item from the spell keeping it locked up safe and sound. All they had to do was forge a permission slip, confundus the second keeper to get her wand, remove the Time-Turner, get the hell out of there and back to Grimmauld Place.
“Yes.”
“I’m in the past,” Draco spoke to himself. “Six years in the past. This isn’t possible.” He looked up at Harry. “
He sat up and collected himself, trying to put together his memories of the night before.
“I do.” Draco finished his glass and a fourth was poured. It loosened his tongue. “I’m not good enough for you, Harry.”
Draco didn’t really know what time it was when he woke up the next day. Nor did he really care.
“A few things can cause time alterations. I should avoid talking to anyone I know. I should not tell anyone what happens in the future. Altering the life of creatures is fairly safe for some boring reason.”
While Harry was on his mission at the Ministry, Hermione and Draco were sitting alone together at Grimmauld place.
“Back so soon? Couldn’t figure out your case and passed it on to a better auror?” Why did he keep being so mean?
“Wait,” Harry backed off.
“Time-Turner,” she read and quizzically looked up. “Harry Potter!” She went beat red.
“Hermione is going to do her research at the library and come back later,” Harry said as he returned from the market. “Most of what she needs is in the restricted section so it’s easier for her to stay there.” Harry took out his cauldron from the cabinet and placed it on the kitchen table. “Oh, I got us this.” He took out a piece of parchment from his robes and handed it to Draco.
“Go to work? Are you daft? I just told you that you died and that I’m from the future and you’re going to just go off to work!”
“Stereotypical.”
“Have you read any of these yet?” Draco asked as he helped himself to some butter chicken.
Harry eventually came back by floo. He went straight to Draco and kissed him before pulling the Time-Turner from his robes.
Draco nodded yes in response. The kettle started whistling and two cups of tea were poured.
“Our situation,” Harry corrected.
“What do you mean everyone?”
“What’s the worse date you’ve ever been on?” Draco took his turn to ask.
“Are you only interested in guys?”
He made his way to what must be Harry’s office. Nauseatingly decorated in red and gold.
“Damn right you’re not!” Ron felt the need to add.
Harry shot up in shock. “What?!”
“Do you want me there? Or just Hermione?” Draco asked.
Draco starred at the man in front of him. “You’re just going to be ok with dying?”
Draco, still sitting on Harry’s lap, went in for a kiss. It was gentle and soft and everything he didn’t want to lose. The emotion invading Draco was so strong it escaped through a tear. Harry softly brushed it off with his thumb and looked at the man’s striking grey eyes. “Talk to me,” he asked Draco.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “We?” He laughed.
“What about us? Are we still friends?” She asked.
Draco nodded. Hermione approached him, wand out and pointed at the Time-Turner. She inhaled deeply, “I do hope this works. Semper Prorsum Temps Annorum.” Aquamarine sparks came out of her wand and circled the Time-Turner before disappearing. “Well, that was it.” She lowered her wand.
He also remembered using the floo to go to Grimmauld place and seeing none other than…
He moved in to a one bedroom flat and continued on with his life. He slowly became more open to people’s invitations to join them for lunch or an after-work pint. He found that people could actually be kind. He started opening up, making amends. One day Luna asked him if he wanted to join them at the pub on Friday. Them involving the golden trio. Draco hesitantly accepted, a little worried of how the three would act towards him but he was pleasantly surprised when they had smiled and welcomed him to their table when he did show up.
He put the book down and abandoned his now cold cup of tea in search of something to right on, thinking it be a good idea to make notes of what he had found.
The smell coming from the kitchen definitely didn’t feel like a hallucination.
“Sorry! I just realized how happy mum will be to know you two have finally hooked up. Now you won’t be able to say no to Sunday dinners.” Ron laughed. Hermione, who felt the seriousness of the situation gave Ron a pointed look but the red-haired man kept going. “Malfoy come on! Imagine your face if we could tell 11 year old you that you’d grow up to be surrounded by Weasleys!” Draco chuckled at that. “Are you guys going to get a ferret as a pet?” Ron asked. This seemed to have crossed a line as Hermione kicked him in the shin to shut him up. “Ronald that’s enough!”
“Apparently any major changes to the time line can affect me specifically. Once I go back to my time, any changes will cause newly formed memories to my existing ones and there’s a high possibility that I’ll go mad.”
“Lovely.”
“Why is that? You know you’ll always have me and Ron?”
“Agreed. Can I ask you something about the future? I mean…no harm in it since we’re obliviating me, right?”
“I thought we would start with like what’s your favourite colour first.”
“Yes.”
“I’m just worried. I’m sure Harry is as well.”
“You’re back!” Draco greeted Harry and motioned for him to come in. “How did it go?”
“Well I’m sure you weren’t any better.”
“Are you asking me out on a date, Potter?”
“Oh boys, you really will need a lot of luck.” Something dawned on Hermione. “Wait! That’s it. Liquid luck! I mean…it’s still probably not going to work.”
Harry took a couple of sips in a row. “Maybe we should obliviate me,” he proposed. “I don’t really like knowing that I’m going to die.”
“Why do you think he’s going to leave you?”
“Hermione, you figured out how to make a Time-Turner go forward. I believe you can do this,” Draco encouraged.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco went a nice shade of red.
“Well, it’s just that everyone knows you two are in love with each other so I was wondering if it finally happens.”
Draco stayed quiet as he kept cooking. “I thought we were going to have a day without talking about this,” he eventually said.
“Of course, we’re adults now. No hard feelings?” Harry extended his arm to shake Cho’s hand.
Harry’s eyes shifted to Draco’s naked arm.
“The hell was that Weasley,” Draco ask.
“I’m trying to help Malfoy, why do you have to be such a prat all the time!”
Harry leaned back to look into Draco’s eyes. He saw kindness and concern. He saw tenderness and love. He pressed his forehead to Draco’s. Hermione felt like she was intruding on an important moment, so she quietly got up to leave.
“Unlike you, I actually close my cases instead of passing the buck.”
“I would like to be there but I can’t be the one to…torture you.”
Draco’s tummy grumbled.
“Is that how you think you’ll feel about him?”
“You’re from the future?”
“Harry, of course I’ll help. I’ll always help, especially if it’s a matter of life and death. And yes, I agree it’s best we erase our memories. Thank you for requesting my permission.”
TRIGGER WARNING - Intentional emotional harm, panic attack
“Did you go all the way?” Draco was definitely interested.
Harry and Hermione exchanged a knowing look. Draco sat up. “Wait? What? You know where the stone is?”
Considering the possibility that he was already dead and nothing worse could happen to him, he followed the notes orders and consumed the vial’s content.
Draco reaches out a shaking hand, doubts suddenly invading his mind. What if it didn’t accept him? What if this was some sort of prank? What if it had broken sometime during the war? What if it did work, and then he realised he didn’t deserve it? What if the wand remembered all those lives Draco’s responsible for taking, and sets itself on fire?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anyway, let's finally cut that suspense, and give you the fanfic. Enjoy!
Harry slips in between him and Hermione, eyes scanning over the list, praying it isn’t as bad as they seem to think it is.
Maybe it’s Malfoy’s lot. He had basically attacked him for no reason, and Slytherins aren’t the sort to turn the other cheek. A pit has grown in his stomach since that had happened. Every time he learns something more about Malfoy, from Luna or Hermione, he feels the guilt of what he did weighing him down. But Remus had said to stay away, so stay away he did, even when Malfoy fell asleep in Nott’s lap, and when Nott carried him up to bed. Harry wants to be the one doing that.
“Why is Draco in Limbo?”
Pansy turns to them, rubbing at her eyes, smearing red over her shocked white face.
“Mister Harry Potter, sir, you should never go in that room, sir!” He squeaks, letting go of Harry’s wrist and shaking his head furiously, making his ears flap against his head. “Bad place, sir, no good for your head, sir. No one but the master allowed in there. Mister Harry Potter, sir, should never go in there.”
“It can’t be!” Harry hisses, annoyance rising at Blaise’s apparent disregard for the fact that his magic just isn’t working anymore. “It can’t have just shrivelled up, that’s not how magic works!”
“So…” Harry sits down heavily, hope crumpling. “What you’re saying is… There’s no way to undo it?”
Thank you!
“Please, Draco, please forgive me! I love you!”
“The owl dropped this outside. I think it’s from your mum.” He lights a couple of candles, bringing a dim light to the room that Malfoy won’t complain about. The blonde squints at him from under the blankets, mouth downturned.
“Mister Harry Potter, sir!” A small hand grips his wrist, and suddenly he’s in a bedroom, the raging emotions gone as quickly as they had arrived. He blinks, staring down at the watery-eyed house elf.
He’s almost convinced. Almost. But new hope is a lie when the sea of students recoil from them as though they’re dementors. Briefly, his grey eyes scan the stream, picking out familiar faces. Longbottom. Loony Lovegood. The she-weasel. Abbott, Macmillan, Finch-Fletchley, and Bones from Hufflepuff. Boot, Corner, and Brockle-something from Ravenclaw. And of course, the weasel, Mudblood, and Golden Boy. (Not mudblood you don’t call them that it’s muggleborn you fool muggleborn NOT MUDBLOOD!)
I love you.
In a last ditch effort, he turns around and wraps his arms around Black’s torso, clinging to him for all he’s worth.
Harry nods, searching his mind for something to say, but he comes up blank. Instead, he turns on his heel and scurries out, shadows and whispers chasing him to the gate.
And then he slips away.
“Sizing up the competition, are we?” Blaise raises an eyebrow at Draco’s scowl.
“Parkinson, Draco isn’t under Imperius…” Hermione says gently, biting her lip in worry. She can feel her forehead creasing again, like it always does these days. She’s going to get early wrinkles.
“Uhm…” Luna glances around. “Sorry.”
Remus’ face turns uncertain, eyes flicking between the three of them. “How?”
“Master Draco?” There’s a small voice behind him, like a house elf’s, except why would there be a house elf in the hospital ward?
WARNING: THIS CHAPTER CONTAINS GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS.
The first chapter, for me. I began with so much enthusiasm and inspiration that I can feel when I read it, even if I didn't separate the paragraphs back then and had no real plan. The start and end of a work is always my favourite, and the amount of thought and creativity I put into that first chapter is strange to read now that it's coming to an end. Plus... I just love angst too much, and that chapter's purpose was almost solely to convey how terrible Draco's life was.
“Gobsy would liked to have had young master Draco well again. Gobsy thinks it is too quiet here.” The house elf lowers his voice. “Gobsy thinks mistress is ill, too. Gobsy knows mistress can’t go away, but Gobsy thinks he would like to take her anyway. Too much death. But mistress will stay for young master Draco, and so Gobsy will too.”
1. Should Sirius and Remus have survived? Everyone else will still be dead, but I'm thinking about making these two live as Harry's sort-of-parents. Sirius will have disappeared somewhere when he was supposed to die, I'll figure it out if you want him to live.
“No, no, it’s alright.” Harry hastily reassures her, sitting down after her. “You can call me Harry. It’s weird to be called Mr Potter all the time.” He laughs nervously, and Narcissa joins in with a tinkling laugh, polite and restricted yet clear and bright, like the chandelier in the front hall.
- E.D.
“Do you think I should have done something differently?” Black glances at him, then stalls as he sees Draco’s expression. “Are you alright?”
No response.
Draco shakes his head, folding his arms and fixing a glare at Potter’s head. ‘No, you have it. It is your favourite, after all.’ It’s a shame he can’t convey his sarcasm through the black lettering.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay!” Black, much closer than Draco had realised, pulls him into a hug. “You can stop. I understand. We’ll stick to yes and no, okay?”
“We wanted to give you both a ‘welcome back’ present.” Hermione announces, stood in the gap between their beds. “Hopefully they’ll give you something to do until you’re well enough to go out again.”
The door closes behind her, and they wait for a few seconds until there is the familiar crack of apparition.
Ok, we're getting close (for the thousandth time) to the ending here. This chapter is a bit of a mash of things, but I didn't have a set plan in mind for this one, I just had to fill up an entire chapter without getting onto the big event of the next chapter.
“Don’t you feel it, sometimes?” She shivers. “Some magic leaves a trace. Mine, not so much. Blaise’s, yours, Draco’s, Dumbledore’s, the Dark Lord’s - anyone’s that holds a little more power than the rest of us. I’m betting yours could infect people too, if you let it.”
From the group of Ravenclaws, someone has been muttering furiously, their words about it being 'disgraceful' and 'stupid to put us all together' clearly heard by the rest of them. McGonagall coughs politely.
“Well that Parkinson girl isn’t doing a very good job! I say one thing, and she attacks me like a pissed-off cat!” Ron retorts, still sulking.
“Narcissa, please.” The woman interrupts him, sinking back into her own stiff sofa. It reminds him of Pansy’s favourite chaise lounge. He makes a mental note to ask her if she and Narcissa have discussed furniture, then remembers that Pansy hates him.
“Look, look!” Harry grabs the book and shoves it into Theo’s face, tapping one finger on the name.
Draco’s collection was a little different to the others. Instead of essays and grades, he’d set up a small gallery of paintings, each one talking and moving around and interacting with others. Mr Lovegood brought along his camera and took photos for an article he was writing on Draco’s work, which had gathered attraction only a few weeks after he started. Because these weren’t just any people in his paintings. These were those who’d died in the Battle of Hogwarts. He had developed the idea after finding his list of people that he’d abandoned a while ago, the ones he’d wanted to help in return for forgiveness. Now, he just wants to help people heal, like he and his mother had after he’d painted Lucius.
Snape and Hermione. Do I even need to explain it? She's young enough to be his daughter. It's just creepy.
November trickles into December, and soon the professors start giving pointed looks to Malfoy’s empty seats. Eighth years are given leeway, yes, but a full week of missed lessons by a Death Eater - no, Ex-Death Eater - can’t be ignored. However, it isn’t until the end of a charms class on a wednesday that one of them speaks up.
“Ah, yes.” Remus nods. “Been a while since I heard that name. I’m pretty sure I had to explain them to Sirius at least six times.” His face turns wistful, and Harry feels that pit in his stomach again when he thinks of Sirius. The pain has dulled, but it is there.
“Harry, that was a rather large spell.” Hermione sighs from where she and Pansy are arranging Draco’s present. “Your magic probably just needs time to recharge, get back to normal. Pushing it won’t help.”
His obnoxiously pale blonde head tilts, comparing his two hands.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“None of your business, Potter.” Blaise spits, already back to that pretentious pureblood sneer. “If you want to find out, go ask him yourself.” With a dramatic flick of his cloak, he glides away.
Imperius. Yes, it's a dark spell that you're not legally supposed to cast, but controlling people? That has to be the best spell there. Maybe it's just my moral ambiguosity, but it sounds like imperius could pretty much let you do whatever you want, all of the time.
There’s a horrible silence, muffled coughing and shuffling feet as he tries to push the words out, breathing from his belly like Luna has taught him to do. Nothing. Frustration wells inside him, making his heart pound faster and breaths come quicker despite his efforts. The seconds seem to stretch out into hours, pitying and disgusted looks mixing and getting confused.
“He does. He killed the Dark Lord with expelliarmus, for Merlin’s sake.” Blaise snorts.
“Just a few more minutes, please.” Her expression tightens, hand dropping from Draco’s head.
Theo and Blaise exchange shocked looks as Remus nods. “Yes, they’re still trying to work it out. I’m sorry, Harry, I might have been a little too eager when I-”
Question time!
Speaking of next chapter... mocks are a thing, and they are not friendly to me. From wednesday to the 20th, I will not be able to update at all. I'm really sorry for this, but I will be back after that. I might even post a christmas special (in addition to the next chapter, don't worry) to make up for it!
Harry fixes his gaze on his lap, dread rising its ugly head again. “Yes. Mrs Malfoy- I mean, Narcissa… I didn’t come here because of your husband. I- I’m very sorry about him, of course, but I didn’t know until I arrived. I…” He trails off, swallowing.
She grins happily. “Thanks Harry. I just hope it works, and isn’t abandoned by the Ministry like some other projects.”
“Please don’t, Harry. I think I might actually cry if you do whatever that was supposed to be again!” Ron mumbles, face firmly buried in his hands.
“I’m sorry about what happened. Pomfrey says you weren’t hurt too bad, but they shouldn’t have done that. Especially with what happened with No- Oh. Sorry.”
“That’s none of your business!”
No. He swallows the potion, grimacing at the sour taste. He’s not going to become like one of those hopeless messes, wishing for death every second of the day. He’s a fighter, always has been, and what he should be focused on doing is fixing this disease of his. If he doesn’t find a cure, at least he’ll know he tried, and by then he might have found something else to work on.
“Sorry.” Lupin sighs, sinking into an armchair. “I would have made it myself, but they just kept insisting…”
His hand grabs at empty air.
‘No. I can do it.’ Draco takes a shuddering breath, facing the metal steps. ‘I can do it.’
“Master Draco could writes it!”
“I don’t blame you, you know. You’re a coward, but I don’t blame you.”
I have a beautiful cat called Marbles, who is a very loud fluffball. Her favourite hobby is sprawling over my laptop or paper that I'm trying to read or write on. I think I'll go give her love and affection now, otherwise her meowing will drive me insane.
A warm hand closes around his shaking ones, grounding him. “Draco?” He realises they’re all staring at him now, two pairs of brown eyes and one black filled with concern. Trembling, he focuses on Pansy’s, calming down.
Another day passes, and when he’s spacing out over another game of chess with Ron, Hermione eventually decides to intervene.
A tree, only a few metres away from that point, waves at him, encouraging him to join it.
“Harry!” Remus squeezes his eyes shut in frustration. “You’re not listening. These Unspeakables have trained differently, they know things the old ones didn’t. It’s not a Veil between the living and the dead. It’s a Veil into Limbo. Anyone who is choosing whether to pass on or remain alive goes there. Along with anyone who’s fell through the Veil. Do you see, Harry? Do you see?"
“I’d have liked to stand here today with my head held high, declaring that I’ve done the best I could have.”
“Draco, I brought you breakfast!” He calls, pushing the door open and fumbling for his wand.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“Better?” Nott asks, a streak of dirt across his cheek moving with his jaw. His eyes are concerned, even when he’s as stony-faced as ever, and somehow Harry doesn’t feel angry or cold towards him. Awkward and self-conscious, yes, but not hating.
“Luna’s psychoanalysing Neville’s obsession with plants and Theo is egging her on again.” Pansy whines, pointing over at the sweating Neville holding a venus flytrap close to his chest. As they watch, Luna calmly backs him into a corner, Theo nodding sagely beside her.
After this, Harry is brought to tea with Narcissa, and Draco is brought to lunch with the Weasley’s. The tea is sufficiently awkward, as one might expect with a combination of Sirius and Narcissa living in the same house. The renovations have been accelerating far quicker with Narcissa there, so at least the setting is pleasant. Kreacher apparently doesn’t welcome the influx of new house elves, so has retreated to the furthest corner of the house. This makes Sirius incredibly happy, but less so when the Malfoy house elves badger him about setting his feet on the coffee table, or leaving dirty laundry on the floor. Not only this, but every time Sirius makes a raucous joke, Narcissa sighs exasperatedly, and every time Narcissa dances around a sensitive topic with delicate words, Sirius gets irritated and snaps at her. Draco has a feeling that the only reason they didn’t descend into a shouting match was because Remus kept both of them on a tight leash.
“Leave it to you to pick a book on a hunch.”
“So you’re completely happy with who you are and you’re past?” Hermione seemed impressed.
Draco kept trying to breathe. He remembered Hermione’s warning about the Time-Turner attracting unwanted attention once used. He took it off of his neck and dropped it to the ground. Without a last glance to it he disapparated.
“Illegal? Oh come on, I thought our days of breaking the rules were behind us!”
Harry sat alone in his kitchen. Hermione had taken Draco to the isolated field she had chosen for him to time travel in. They had decided that it was best for them to loose their memories somewhere familiar instead of them finding themselves in a field and confused…less questions that way.
“See, ‘Mione, that’s where you come in.” Harry flashed her his best smile. “Since you’re the smartest witch in the world, we’ve figured you’d be able to alter it to go forward.”
“That’s ALL you have to do! Harry do you know how much luck you’ll need to pull this off? Many wizards have tried to get by even the first keeper of the vault and that girl is good! Permission slips are filled with spells and magical signatures.  Won’t happen.” Hermione was not hopeful but the men were not deterred.
Draco woke up the next morning with a naked Harry tangled around him. He looked at the sleeping figure, not wanting to wake him. His now alcohol-free thoughts realized that he would have to leave with the knowledge of what the man he loved tasted like. He now knew how his skin felt beneath his fingers, how the curves of his body fit with his. How they had wasted years not admitting their mutual feelings out of stupid fear. Draco bit his lip and closed his eyes trying to will himself not to cry. He deeply wished things were different. Deeply wished time travelling didn’t have so many rules. Maybe he could stay here. Hide away from everyone and never go back but still have Harry…at least for six years.
“Molly and Arthur will pass eventually, and everyone will go on their own way.”
“We’ve already talked about this.” Harry gave her a look. “We need to just drop it, it can’t be done.”
“Right…well I need a drink.” Harry walked away and Draco followed.
“What are we having for dinner? Your pantry is running out of food,” Draco pointed out.
Harry reached out and placed his hands on Draco’s waste. He pulled him close so that the blonde was now sitting in his lap. Draco put his hands on Harry’s chest and felt his heart pounding. Fuck it. He brought a hand up behind Harry’s head and closed the distance between them. Lips meeting each other and instantly opening to deepen their connection. It was everything Draco had always wanted and not enough at the same time.
Now, when it comes to itemless time travel, countless wizards have tried only to stand there looking foolish as nothing happens.
He instantly felt better. Thank Salazar for hang over potions.
Hermione nodded. “Well promise me Draco, when you get back, you’ll come to me and make sure we become good friends, ok?”
“The first keeper, the one that looks at the permission slip, it’s Cho Chang.” Draco announced as if that solved everything. Seeing the deadpan look on Hermione’s face he continued. “With all the history she has with Harry, we’re banking on her being so flustered that she won’t really look at the slip and just let him in.”
They pulled away for air and Draco suggested they move things to the bedroom.
“I know we said all topics were on the table but if you’re not comfortable talking about that yet –“
“Yes.”
What was causing the headache seemed to be the fact that he now had a conflicting memory regarding that day. Ron had cried out boggart but instead of casting Riddikulus, he heard Harry cast Stupefy. This time, Draco had rushed into the room to see the spider wobbling in place, frozen. They had continued their search of the house and even though there had been a few more nasty beasts and they had endured some cuts and bruises, everything had been secured by the end of the day and everyone went home alive.
It was a cold, rainy day. No hope of sun coming from the clouds. It was fitting somehow, like the world knew what it had transpired. Like mother nature openly cried for the loss felt by so many witches and wizards.
Harry was sitting in his study sipping tea and reading the Daily Prophet. Their arrest of the fantastic beast trafficker had made the news and he was interested in seeing what facts they had gotten right and which they were sure to have completely made up.
He was torn between running down the stairs and creeping down slowly, not sure which action would ensure his hallucination didn’t disappear.
“I suggest we use Veritaserum during the…interview…that way you’re forced to face the truth regarding how deep this fear goes.” Hermione always coming up with a plan.
“That’s different. Someone’s life is usually at stake and I’d be a pretty bad auror if I didn’t act to save them.” He took a sip. “You’re brave in many ways that I can’t be. Especially when it comes to your relationships with people. You’re not afraid to express yourself and trust that you can handle being hurt.”
When his feet hit the ground, he took a minute to will his head to stop spinning. He saw there was a light on. He had expected the flat to be empty now that its sole resident had passed. Maybe someone else had the same idea of coming over.
“Not a problem! No. Not a problem at all. We’re both professionals.” She laughed awkwardly. “You have a permission parchment?”
“I bloody well can do as I please, thank you very much.”
“New problem,” she pointed out, “it takes a full lunar cycle to brew Veritaserum and I’m not advanced enough to do such a complex potion. We all know I’m shite in that field.”
Hermione gasped. “Harry! Draco! No!”
“Who’s Cindy-Lou?” Harry asked, taking a bite out of his sandwich.
“What? Ok Malfoy this isn’t funny anymore.”
“That’s a good idea. We need to make sure this works and with the potion and the elixir, we’re sure to push the limits of my emotions.”
“Harry I need you to concentrate on that time, ok?”
“Wait,” Harry gently placed his hand on Draco’s wrist. “You don’t have to hide from me.”
“You did it!” Hermione exclaimed. “Now for the hard part.”
“Oh! Oh boy. This arse had tipped off the Daily Prophet to our date so we got to the restaurant and none other than Rita Skeeter was there with her Quick-Quotes Quill. Any conversation I tried to have was twisted and written down. And of course my date loved it and wouldn’t shut up.”
“Yeah I get it, you’re a man of honour. I’ll unlock my floo so you can go to his place if you’re up for doing it now?”
Apart from that, this chapter is a bit of fluffy crack...the depressing plot will resume shortly
You see the thing is, Draco had always rather been fond of Harry Potter. Muggle psychologist would surely inform him that his ill-natured relationship towards Harry at Hogwarts was a clear way of fighting his feelings for a boy who wasn’t returning them. All the horrible things he did to him was only to make sure he was hated back and never had to actually confront how he actually felt. That, paired with the fact that his father made sure Draco was on the opposite side during the war, just put them at odds end.
“Like I was saying, I’m not complaining,” Harry continued. Draco whined and laid back down. “It’s just that we’re adults now Draco…getting old and all. I want to make it clear that I’m not just interested in you for a good snog…or shag. I want a relationship with you. Something serious. I still am very confused as to why you rushed into my flat and attacked my lips with yours all of a sudden but I want to do this right.”
“Ok, wait. Getting the Time-Turner isn’t our only problem. Have you forgotten that it doesn’t actually for forward in time?” Hermione looked from one man to the other, giving them a disapproving look.
Draco nodded. This was probably for the best. This way he could make sure there really was nothing found and he wouldn’t have to worry about it.
Draco shrugged. “It’s fine. At least no one brought me on a date that involved Rita Skeeter”
“Not true.” A third glass was poured. “I avoided telling you how I felt about you by fear of rejection. Seemingly, I avoid it for the rest of my life.”
Harry looked at Draco who appeared distraught. “We don’t.” He said to Hermione’s horror. “Everyone book we’ve read says that altering my death would drive Draco insane and I can’t be the cause of that.”
The next couple of days went by way too quickly for Harry’s liking. This was evidently going to suck but he had made up his mind. He didn’t know what conversations or experiences he and Draco had already been through and he could tell the other man got sad whenever something would come up that they had either clearly already covered or gone experienced. He also felt like Draco was holding back, almost like he was scared to relive certain things again and he didn’t want to push him. Harry needed to do this so once the potion was acquired, they set up a time for Hermione to come over.
Draco blinked as the realization of what Harry had said settled in. A gentle smile settled on his face as he approached Harry again, going in for a second kiss.
There, in front of him, looking very much alive stood none other than Harry Potter.
“Yes. Not as good as I would like though. Which is my fault. I’m always keeping people at arms length.”
