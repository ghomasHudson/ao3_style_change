“Did he say something to you?” Harry’s thoughts spiralled. Did Malfoy insult the Weasley family again? Commenting on their lost family member? Had he harmed Hermione in a cutting remark? Or did he resort to using magic to harm them?
It doesn’t register for a while, but he starts to wonder what Harry promised, and exactly when this promise was made.
He tried to say with his eyes. Malfoy’s response was to roll his eyes and move his hand in a gesture as if to say
Draco wasn’t paying attention to his surroundings; he was too busy explaining why rose water was overpriced for such a common ingredient that he didn’t notice the upturned stone (
“Huh?” Harry looks up from rubbing his jumper sleeve between his forefinger and thumb. “Oh, nothing new. Just trying to figure out what more I can teach you, my little protege.”
He finds a clearing not too far from where Voldemort waits for him. He can hear the crazed cackling from Bellatrix. But he’s far enough that they can’t find him easily.
He hadn’t realised how long he was staring at the red roses and startled when he felt a tap on his shoulder.
“I like you too, you prat! And if we talked this out properly we could have fixed ourselves a whole load of pining!” Harry almost growled. He thought of the weeks they spent apart and how they could have spent it instead.
Ron’s squawk brings Harry’s attention back to him, but not fast enough to catch him as his eyes roll and he faints. Hermione despite being in shock herself seems to recover fast enough to prevent his head from banging against the concrete ground. That’s one accident she’d like to prevent, thankyouverymuch.
Harry stared at his phone in despair. His one true hope, Hermione, was sick and unable to make it for their revision session. He typed out a frantic message asking her how long she would be out for, only to have a message from Ron telling him to let Hermione rest. He sent
He groaned and took his glasses off so he could rub his eyes. That was it, he was going to fail this. There went over thirty per cent of his grade. He leaned back against the comfortable sofa, contemplating why he decided to take French. It wasn’t exactly necessary for his university course. He just enjoyed learning the language. Keyword: learning. Being tested for it was a hurdle he really didn’t want to have to go through.
Harry had turned two pages backwards to give Draco some context, all the while wishing that Draco was both a slow and fast reader. He didn’t know what to expect and he was scared. At the gasp, he knew that Draco had finally read what Harry wanted him to. He closed his eyes and only opened them when Draco started to laugh.
. He bit the inside of his cheek, wondering how he could turn the tables around. It was unbecoming of a Malfoy to be reduced to stuttering. He had expected to be mocked once word got around of how he had behaved the previous week. However, it seemed that no one was aware of his failure. This unsettled him as he knew that if the roles were reversed the news would have spread by the end of the day.
Once they reached the infirmary, Harry guided Draco to a bed and went to the office. He was familiar with the anti-bruising cream due to his continued injuries. He may not have been ace at Potions, but he could still read. He grabbed the one he needed, and the dittany – just in case – before returning to Draco’s side.
He listens in sadness upon hearing how Sirius was Harry’s ticket out. Only for him to die and for Harry to wallow in despair upon losing his hope. He internally cheers Harry on when it’s revealed that Harry trashed Dumbledore’s office in the wake of his rage. And rightly so! He hates how the person most special in Harry’s life is someone related to Draco, and how the one most hated by Harry is also related to Draco.
He stopped outside a Firkins bakery and stepped inside. The smell of freshly baked pork pies drawing him closer to the display. It was after the lunch rush, but a new batch had been freshly made. He leaned down and looked at what was available.
The wizarding world was not a sympathetic place for either of them. Draco suffered sneers and Harry bore through objections to his actions.
Harry, surprised that he actually did, smiled back, “yeah I do. So let’s do this okay? I’m here if you need me.” And that wasn’t even a lie, he had said it without thinking.
“Is there anyone special who will get those?” Malfoy asked his mouth right by Harry’s neck. So close that he could feel Malfoy’s breath.
He turned to the page and settled into his bed, kicking off his shoes along the way. He started to read aloud, “Auras are a beautiful thing to see. They’re wondrous and few are blessed to witness them. Those gifted with the sight, however, will be filled with the burden of all the colours until they figure out ways to make it disappear. Some have attempted so via acting as Panders, others have chosen the complete opposite and chose to hide the gift and become hermits. —”
Harry nodded, internally screaming. It was a stupid time to realise how much he liked Draco’s accent when speaking French. Something he continuously noticed throughout their shared French classes since year seven.
Harry grins and begins another story. A story he has been wanting to tell them since the relationship started. Only Draco beat him to it, “I was very angry at the start…”
Malfoy, no– Draco’s breath shook and he nodded, heading to Flitwick’s table. He cast a dubious glance at Flitwick but was only encouraged to move forward. He lifted his left hand and touched the arrow with his forefinger, wanting to have the least amount of contact possible.
They seemed to act as if Harry hadn’t revealed to Draco that he had no soulmate. Draco had taken to aiding Harry in his little matchmaking scheme and seemed to enjoy it whenever couples would start their relationships. He was most satisfied when he saw Blaise and Pansy finally give in and let themselves be happy. Despite all the cheer in the air, Harry was still worried about what he told Draco. He was torn between finding someone who could bring out Draco’s aura and leaving it alone. Harry knew Draco’s smiles were genuine and increasing in frequency, but he still wanted the best for Draco.
Neville pulled Harry’s hand away from the fraying edge of his sweater, “Harry, it’s okay to– y’ know.”
Harry jumps, not expecting them to be so close to him all of a sudden. “Yeah, I’m just looking for Malfoy. I’ve got to give him back his wand and all…”
When it landed on Ron to choose, he was probably drunker than Harry thought, because he too dared Draco to kiss Harry ‘
“Yes, Pansy?” He pointedly ignored her sneer at his use of her first name. If they wanted to put things in the past, that was the first thing to go, in his book.
“His soul remained on earth and reincarnated continuously… and there was no change. The two continued to meet and separate. That is until a new prophecy was made.”
“I understand I won’t find anyone to love me truly like your aura vision likes to suggest. But this is low Potter. Even for you.”
“Sirius kinda was the reason why I decided to give you a chance you know?” Harry ends his rant. “He was the lost sheep in his family, someone against everything his family fought for. He truly is the bravest man I can think of. I wanted to give you the choice he should have had.”
“What exactly do you mean?” He tilted his head, careful not to curl his hair behind his ears, purposefully suffering his fringe poking into his eyes. His glasses were pointless, they were barely the right prescription, and they didn’t protect his eyes from his hair’s attacks.
Harry blushed. He forgot about that minute detail, “BRB!” He ran back out into the hallway and ran to the downstairs bathroom. He quickly washed his face and brushed his teeth. The time alone gave him a chance to think things through. Was he really going to go through with this? He stared at his reflection and pointed to himself, “you’ve got this!” The reflection winked back at him, ‘you’ve got this’ it mimicked and threw in some finger guns. How Draco’s mirror knew about the concept of finger guns escaped Harry as he left the bathroom.
Harry starts, not realising that they had followed him. He stands and turns to them, his hands finally leaving Malfoy’s face, only to reach for his hand.
Harry could feel himself choking. He thought he was so much more secretive than this. Okay, so maybe he
Malfoy laughed, “sorry, it’s just that I find it bizarre that you call it that. Locals refer to it as town. How long are you here for?”
For the next few days, he kept his eyes down and cleared his mind. He didn’t know how he would be able to pull this off. Never mind when.
He cleared his throat, and Potter hardly reacted. Draco took this as a chance and leaned against the wall opposite Potter. He stood with his feet crossed at the ankles, and his arms crossed over. An entirely defensive stance and he acknowledged it. It was obvious after all. He refused to stare across him, he didn’t want to see the judgement in Potter’s eyes. That and he was scared he’d reveal too much and lose his nerve. He fiddled with his hands and started speaking when he was ready.
They took a moment to admire the ring on Harry’s finger. Draco tugged it up to his lips where he placed the gentlest of kisses. Harry looked down at him fondly. He cupped Draco’s cheeks and leaned down, “your fiancé would like a proper kiss,” he whispered against Draco’s lips.
Pansy rolled her eyes, “finally found your balls from where they disappeared after defeating ol’ no-nose? The drama queen is moping outside. If not the courtyard, then somewhere by the trees. He doesn’t like to be inside when he feels like this.”
Mikey was back from break and wiping down the counter. He took the paper Mark held out for him and set to make the drinks.
“I’m just about to clock out, but I want to warn you about table seven. It seems quite tense there so tread carefully. I’m not sure if it's a business meeting or something.”
Kreacher apparates into the kitchen at once and bows to Narcissa, “yes, Mistress Cissy.” He mutters on his way to the cupboards. He wordlessly refills the mugs on the counter that the four have been drinking out of as he passes.
Harry gaped like a fish, his grip tightening on Draco. It was so tight Draco flinched, but Harry didn’t care. He needed Draco to understand, “I don’t understand. That’s not what it says at all!”
Harry cursed and reached to pull Malfoy’s arm away from the gold bar that was the arrow’s shaft. He tugged and tugged, but Malfoy’s grip was steady. Harry could hear a collective intake from his classmates.
! Draco’s mind and mouth seemed to stop working in harmony. His body more so as he turned around away from Potter. Heart pounding, he rushed to his room. He quickly closed his door and stared at it.
The flashing lights of the club started to give him a headache. He groaned and closed his eyes tight hoping it would help, however, all it did was seem to make the pulsing music louder. He pushed away from the table he was leaning against and gestured to his friends that he was going to leave. They asked if he wanted them to go with him, but he replied that they should stay and enjoy themselves.
Cally jumped, suddenly remembering her task, “well typically silver anniversaries require irises,” she placed the book down and pointed at the purple flowers for Harry to see, “and as its the silver anniversary, I could add some accents of silver-tipped baby’s breath, among a few other filler flowers.”
Draco gasped slightly at some of the elation leaving him. The pink haze he was under darkened into a red one. He pulled his hand back and kicked the table with his foot. He took his head into his hands and pulled at his hair. This worried Harry who rushed to pull his hands away, preventing him from hurting himself.
“So glad to see familiar faces!” Seamus poked Neville’s side so he could be free to stand and greet the trio properly. “Go on, take a seat!”
They kiss and kiss until their mouths are swollen. A few minutes after they ease up. Draco had pushed Harry up to sit on the table so that he could step in between Harry’s thighs. This allows for them to be eye-level which eases Draco’s neck which he had bent to reach Harry. Draco had grabbed Harry’s left knee to tighten it around himself, wordlessly encouraging Harry to wrap it around him.
Harry stiffens at his words, he almost doesn’t want to ask, but he knows he has to. “Who do you have to kill Draco?” his hand absent-mindedly stroking Draco’s hair.
Harry, or whatever his name was, lifted his head from the table in the pub. He grimaced when he felt the coaster stick to his face. The world was blurry for a bit, but then his glasses slid down from his forehead and the world was right again. Sort of.
One such time, Harry was caught unaware. They were alone again, and somehow Malfoy found out how comfy he was in Harry’s lap. Harry bit his lip to try and keep himself in check, but Malfoy would have none of that. He shuffled around a bit and smirked at the moan Harry let out. “There it is,” he’d say, leaning forward to kiss Harry’s cheek. Harry knew it wouldn’t be long before Malfoy would attempt to kiss him elsewhere and he wasn’t sure if he was dreading it or anticipating it. He just wanted this to be over so things could be… Not exactly normal, but understandable.
The eyes become limpid and turn to Harry, “yes. Exactly like the constellation. It’s from my mother’s side of the family. They have the tradition to name us after the stars.”
Mark greeted them, “good evening, I’m taking over my fellow server. My name is Mark. Are you ready to order your drinks or would you like more time?”
They were quiet as Harry applied the cream, smiling as the redness faded. He was pleased to see that there was no need for the dittany. He turned Draco’s hand over and frowned at the indents made from his nails clenching so tightly. He didn’t think the anti-bruising cream would help, so he simply smoothed his thumb against Draco’s palm.
“It was Ancient Greece, they were lucky to have been together the way they were,” Apollo comments. “Despite that, Achilles died a hero but never accepted the glory that Elysian Fields has to offer. He chose to wait for Patroclus, whose death was never honoured.”
His mother has become more aloof as the years progressed, choosing to ignore the screams and terror that surrounds their home. Screams often brought by his father’s hand. She used to be full of life and elegant, but now she is quiet and demure. Talks less, and stares into the clouds— as if hoping for better days, but not knowing how to find them.
He risked a look at Potter, and his breathing eased when he noticed Potter was looking outside. No doubt looking at the flickering lanterns.
Harry grinned and placed a light kiss on his cheek and then stepped away. “Great, let’s get to it then!”
“Two things really. If I’m the last one you have to apologise to, and if you’re going to keep insulting me.”
Their voices fade as they walk deeper in the house, lost further as the door to the green room closes.
“Better than I did earlier in the year. You wouldn’t have known, but before I started this secretive matchmaking the whole school was practically glowing different colours. It wasn’t until I saw how Ron and Hermione’s started to dim slightly that I realised what was going on. The longer one is exposed to their match, the less of a glow. I was starting to hate how much headaches I’d get from the flare of people’s auras. The plus side, however, was that when two people’s auras merged it turned so beautiful.”
Happy with his purchase, he nearly skipped the rest of the way to his accommodation. Of course, he didn’t. He wasn’t
Hermione takes a sip from the warm tea and stars at Harry who stares back. She places it back down. “You’re happy?”
“Right, right.” He took a deep breath and flicked at the bottle with his wand, not feeling bothered to move and spin it by hand. It had landed on Blaise. He had chosen truth, so Harry asked him something that he suddenly remembered, “okay Zabini, how do you take revenge for pranks and such in Slytherin?”
“Tradition in my family states that after four years of courtship, the next step is to be made,” Malfoy blurts.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Amortentia is easy, he probably just wants to refill his stock that he sells to the masses and is using us as his unpaid labour.”
His eyes lit with glee when she chose truth, “oh lovely Hermione, what do I ask thee?” He leaned to his side and whispered conspiringly with Dean who let out a laugh at what Seamus was saying. “Okay, okay. Phew. Now, I ask, where exactly did you and Ron go the other night?”
“No, I promised I’d come back to you. And I did.” He wipes Malfoy’s tears away with his thumbs. He doesn’t stop when they’ve been wiped away. It seems that now he’s touching Malfoy he can’t seem to pull away. “I kept my promise Draco. Hush now…”
Draco looked to Neville and Seamus and smiled softly, “I guess I see the appeal in seeing love form.”
“Merci, mon ami. It seems that je suis très soûle…” Harry slurred. He shook his head and blinked into the air. Since when did he speak… Spanish? French?
After the war, Harry found himself finding peace in the Muggle world. He disliked the bright colours wizardkind often wore. After getting used to the dark dull days, bright colours hurt his eyes. Many wizards enjoyed patterns and some of them made even Draco baulk at the sheer eyesore.
It was only when he accidentally dropped one face down, that he realised there was writing at the back. Harry grabbed the picture and pulled it closer to his face.
In light of recent events, friendships started forming more easily. Pansy and Hermione took to bonding over their idiot friends, while Ron and Theodore found themselves playing pranks on unassuming prey.
Their eyes darted to each other’s lips before Harry chickened out and retreated to his seat. The constant push and pull between the two of them was
Draco can’t help himself, he leans in to kiss Harry. A kiss Harry happily returns. There’s no stopping him now that they’re free to express their feelings for each other.
He went over to bring their deserts over. He had just placed the final gateau on the table when Ron sighed.
It wasn’t hard to follow Potter, he was only a few metres ahead of Draco. Draco kept his steps quiet as he shadowed Potter, wondering where the boy was heading. He stopped at a turn, just in case Potter had caught on and was leading him on a wild goose chase. After a substantial amount of time, Draco turned and paused at was he saw. Potter had taken a seat on one of the window ledges and had pulled one leg up and left the other one to sway.
Draco was staring at the melting ice cubes in his glass, wondering when exactly they became part of his drink. Surely it watered down the drink, and wasted…
By some agreement, the students who returned for a repeat of their seventh year had moved in solidarity. They stopped their teasing and acted as if everything was back to normal. As if the past month hadn’t happened. Harry wasn’t sure whether to be proud of them being united, or annoyed at how well they were for it.
Harry pulled him back into his arms, “shhh.” He rubbed Draco’s back, his arms. Trying his best to reassure the miserable boy in his arms. “I forgive you.”
Potter’s other eyebrow joined, “wow. He’s gonna shit his pants. Please let me see this in person, and I’ll let you insult me – within reason.”
.” Harry watches in glee as Draco’s grip on his wand tightens, as his eyes lose their silver-tone and become pitch black.
. Touch was something Harry realised he wasn’t accustomed to, despite the many years of friendship with hug-happy Ron. Harry learned how much he wanted to be touched because of Draco’s tactile nature. He recalled watching Draco act dramatically and lean against Blaise and Pansy during the past. How he was not afraid to wrap an arm around Theodore’s shoulder and lead him around. Even Greg and Vince received hugs from Draco now and again.
Harry nuzzles his face into Draco’s neck, breaking their stare and breathes in the scent that reminds him of hills and caves and streams. “Fools the lot of them,” he says, straightening himself to look into Draco’s pale eyes.
Harry steps into the forest with a light heart. He trusts Hermione and Ron to continue to finish off the other Horcruxes once the one in him is gone. He is ready for death, he just hadn’t calculated one Draco Malfoy into his plans. Everything became jumbled in his mind when he felt the arms around his waist.
“Well done in today’s brewing session. I am pleased with plenty of your successful results. Now, it is nearing your free study time, so if you may, pour your potions into the vials and clean out your cauldrons. I am expecting an essay of two feet about the antidote you have been making. Those who have not finished, please also decant it into a vial and label it as yours. I will be seeing you all shortly soon.”
around Hermione merged with Ron’s. The two separate colours combined to form a faint pink hue. It blended in with Ron’s hair, while it brought emphasis to Hermione’s.
“How did you guys know you found the right one?” Harry asked. He leaned his hands behind him, and he leaned back, relaxed. He thought back to his late lunch with Malfoy– no, Draco. He watched the sky slowly turn darker and more orange as the sun was getting ready to set.
This time it’s Harry who laughs with no light in his eyes, “I understand more than you think.” He takes a seat on their regular table during the sessions. “I am no stranger to being left in the dark regarding Dumbledore.” His fingers trace the grain of the wood, uncomfortable with what he’s about to reveal, but if he wants Draco’s trust, he’s going to have to make his darkest hours known. “I didn’t always have friends y’know?” He looks up, glad to see that Draco is taking what he’s saying seriously, “I had family… But they weren’t family. At least, not where it counts.” Harry coughs to clear his throat which suddenly clogs with emotions he hadn't let himself feel in a long time.
Harry started to shake his head, “no that would be ridiculous. Besides I like—” his eyes widened and he lifted his hand to cover his mouth.
They eventually found a hidden cafe that was a mix of French and Italian culture. Harry had laughed at Malfoy’s comment on the manager’s indecision. This seemed to please him, as he spent most of the time trying to find a way to make Harry happy. The warmth Harry felt in his stomach started to spread and turned into fondness.
Upon sitting down, Harry pushed his Walkman to Draco, “you’ve gotta listen to this! I found another station last night and they have more of the band you like.”
“No, I’m stupidly expensive.” Draco deadpanned, but this smile he was trying to stop released itself. “Yeah, I’ll bite. Where do you want to talk?”
The speaking test for his end of year assessment was later in the day and he had always practised with Hermione. It felt almost sacrilegious to not have her next to him. Revising together was practically a ritual at this point. Ever since year seven where they suffered under the tutelage of Monsieur Snape together — the bane of Harry’s existence who followed them into sixth from classes. Why their school only had one French teacher was beyond Harry.
Pansy’s face blanked, she wasn’t expecting him to admit it up front. Then again, there was nothing he could say in defence. He guessed she was expecting more of a fight. “Okay, look. Draco’s in an obviously fragile state. When he gets back to normal, who knows how he’s going to act.”
Draco’s eyes traced the flower as it lowered, and moved back up. “What exactly did you want to do?” He whispered, fearing that if he talked any louder it would ruin the atmosphere.
Harry caught Hermione’s eye and nodded at her concerned stare. He let himself smile at her to let her know he knew what she knew and that there were no hard feelings. He spotted his target by the fire, laughing with his friends. He stopped mid-stride and took in the sight. The fire made his hair light up, glow in a way that should’ve had Harry seen an aura around him. He started to picture what Draco’s aura would look like, perhaps a deep blue, or purple fit for royalty. Maybe green to show his loyalty to his house. Perhaps even golden to mimic the way his hair looked against the firelight.
Ron looks down noticing Harry’s not holding his wand for the first time, “oh yeah, the git finally realised he was wrong.”
Only, Harry can’t think about the benefits. He berates himself for the thought. He hates how eager his to hear Draco’s secrets during their sessions when it’s obvious that Draco’s been in anguish over whatever it is he’s been doing.
Harry talked to Flitwick and Madame Pomfrey. They both agreed with him when he suggested they hold off the from next session. Draco was still adjusting to feeling emotions of sadness and fear, that he was less likely to handle another negative one. Draco knew this of course and appreciated Harry’s thoughtfulness.
This eases the plans which are put into place. Narcissa agrees to be a spy in exchange for her son’s safety, something that doesn’t sit well with Harry. Regardless, Dumbledore insists that they maintain their covers. According to him, it was the only thing that would keep them truly safe.
Harry sighed, and started playing with Draco’s hair. He remembered seeing Pansy do it to him in the common room whenever he looked particularly glum. “Okay. That’s probably expected. Some people just can’t accept certain things, but they aren’t all people. I know for sure that Hermione’s forgiven you. Even Ron’s come around. If the three of us can forgive you, I’m sure others will follow.”
He headed back to the kitchen, jogging as the enticing smell was simply calling to him. He slipped a few times since he was only wearing socks. He could detect some hints of cinnamon, which meant one thing. French toast. Specifically
Harry’s mind is reeling everywhere, but he can’t let Draco know. Draco who eased out of it like it was nothing.
Malfoy nods again. He seems very troubled. Ron feels weird. Does… does Malfoy want to end things? All those years wasted? Why is he telling Ron? Is he too cowardly to say it to Harry's face?
“Merlin, he’s asking deep questions,” the man groaned. He grabbed a tall glass and handed it over to Harry, “here, have a sip of this.”
Draco scoffed and jerked his wrist free from Harry’s grip. The anger behind Draco’s eyes made Harry nervous. It’d been so long since they fought, he wasn’t sure what to do anymore.
His sigh drew the other man’s attention to him. He raised his eyebrow at Harry and took a longer sip.
He started to pull away, but Draco wouldn’t have it. He grabbed Harry’s elbows and tugged him back, “don’t go too far away.”
?” He didn’t care how sarcastic he sounded. Everything about this sounded weird. He’s had enough of weird, ta.
Potter nodded, his eyes focusing on Draco’s shoulder as adopted a calculative look, “perhaps I could help?”
That made him laugh, “how is it possible that you can get any more ridiculous than you are normally? I thought there was a limit. It seems you’ve surpassed it.” The man didn’t sound very drunk, he spoke so eloquently.
Harry looked down at the tulips and traced his finger against the petal. It was velvety soft and such a simple thing. But it was a start.
Deciding to ignore her cryptic words, he started to pack away his work. He had noticed halfway during their conversation that the class was starting to empty. And he had a book to get to, which would probably give him all his answers.
He nodded and proceeded to tell them to turn to their textbooks. And so the rest of the class faded from Harry’s mind. He played with his quill and drew arrows all over his parchment with hearts floating around them. He attempted to draw a cherub, but it only resembled a marshmallow with wings and a strange nappy. He quickly crossed it out when he heard Ron laugh next to him.
“It’s Tuesday today, Nev normally takes today as his mental health days. He’ll be resting in our common room. C’mon.” Potter moved around Draco and started for the eighth year common room.
It was another day of Malfoy’s slow recovery and since the first session, he refused to go without Harry by his side. The way he was getting so attached to Harry was a constant worry for him. How would Malfoy act once he fully recovered? He could only imagine the hate-filled argument they would inevitably have.
From what Sirius had told Harry, his father had pined after Lily despite how ruthless his teasing was. How did Lily find it in herself to forgive someone who had been mean to her? Was Malfoy like his father in that sense? Could Harry find it in himself to forgive him? It wasn’t like they were on opposite sides during a war.
Eros’ arrow was a solid gold arrow that captivated everyone, once Flitwick displayed it by the front of the class. He explained how a simple touch could absorb all the negative emotions a person would feel, leaving behind only good thoughts. He did warn them, however, that too much of a good thing, wasn’t necessarily a good thing. Eros’ arrow was so strong that a person could get high off the feeling, and act blindly. No longer feeling fear, they could fight something terrible to death, as his best example.
Harry tugged on the peeling skin of his lower lip with his teeth. He kept biting and pulling until the copper taste entered his mouth. He licked the blood off and turned around, surprised by how close Malfoy got to the table.
Harry blinked, confused, “Draco. We’ve already established I’m not the smart one in this relationship. Please elaborate.”
Harry turned back to Cally and handed the notepad back to her. She smiled down at the number. Harry’s stomach lurched. He knew what that smile meant, having seen it on countless witches faces in the passing years. He felt bad for all of them, nothing would come from it. He was as straight as his hair – which he wasn't, that is.
When they entered the common room Seamus was first to notice them and their swollen lips. He let out a hoot and conjured a hat asking everyone to put the required money in. Hermione was awarded the biggest share for saying they’d stay in Harry’s for at least two hours. Ron groaned and asked if he could give her a massage instead of his money. She agreed smugly and started to count her coins.
“I knew if I followed the loud noises I’d find you.” A posh accent that only belonged to a blond Slytherin drew the attention of the five Gryffindors. He simply blinked at them, before taking a seat on one of the couches.
“Tsk tsk, alcohol is making your tongue loose. Do you kiss Potter with that mouth? Oh– you already have!” Blaise winked across at Harry who had turned
This weekend found him wandering around the city of Birmingham. He bypassed the Woolworths and the Argos store. Meandering through the crowds of busy shoppers. He ironically didn’t mind being in crowds, as long as he blended in; anonymous. He stood at the ramp leading into the shopping centre and followed one direction of the two-way traffic.
“I’m sorry. Were you talking to me?” Potter asked. There was no emotion behind his voice as if Draco was not worth wasting the energy on.
Harry merely accepted the tirade flowing free from Draco. Harry knew that keeping anger in would only fester, and was prepared for whatever Draco could say to him. After all, eight years of hateful remarks from the person sort of built Harry’s immunity.
were unspoken, yet obvious with how often the dare had been made. Draco still didn’t know who had spoken, but like hell he’d pass on this dare. This… This blessing! Yes, that’s what it was.
Heads turned to Harry, only to return back to what they were doing. They were already used to his loud voice when he hadn’t realised how loud he was playing his music. They were also quite used to Harry and Malfoy’s interactions since their tentative friendship began. No one knew exactly how it started. The only people who had some insight were Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville and Malfoy.
Harry rolls his eyes and ignores Ron in favour of watching the pink grow on Draco’s cheeks. He is a very pale-faced man and doesn’t blush very easily. Or he likes to think. Harry takes pleasure in being one of the few who have seen Draco blush bright red and being the cause of it.
Harry looked at her apprehensively, they agreed to be civil, friendly even, due to the Draco’s initial clingy-ness. However, Harry was still intimidated by her. She would no doubt become a very powerful woman in the future, different in Hermione’s form of intimidation, but she still possessed power.
) Harry looked over Draco’s shoulder and watched as he picked out small socks with snitches flying around it.
They walked down the steps, walking past the performer when Harry remembered what he wanted to do. He jogged back to them and placed two £10 notes into the case by their feet.
There is no hesitation when Draco grasps Harry’s outstretched hand. With effort, the two manage to sit Draco behind Harry. Draco, fearing this will be the last time he has the change to sit so close to Harry, leans forward and tucks his face between Harry’s shoulder blades. His hands naturally wrap around Harry’s waist.
“Why? Are you interested in one of them?” Draco’s gruff voice brought Harry’s attention back to him. The confused look Harry got on his face made Draco scoff. “Well, Potter?”
“Harry… Harry…” Draco gasped once more, tears dampening Harry’s neck and staining his shirt as they fell. He leaned back slightly and looked into Harry’s eyes. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.”
“Now, what I’m curious to know about is how did you two start… being y’know. Like that?” Ron waves at the couple.
Draco groaned and sunk into a crouch. He banged his fist against the ground multiple times, relishing in feeling something other than the heated fury within him. He was angry at himself for losing his senses and cuddling Potter,
He moved his phone away from his ear and waited for her to stop her shouting. She was a very excitable woman, and there was nothing like a date to get her going. Another fact he knew too well.
Harry was torn between walking away or turning around and comforting Malfoy. He was no stranger to hating where he was and wanting a change in his surroundings. No stranger to wanting something different, a way to make things better. He could understand, but he also knew that hiding away from the darkness wasn’t smart. The darkness would only build up, growing until before he knew it, the light was no more.
He held back his tears of frustration and repeatedly hit his phone against his forehead. He was counting on Hermione to give him tips as her speaking test was yesterday.
“I should have expected it. The temptation to erase all the harsh emotions must have been too much for you all. This is my fault, I apologise, truly. There is nothing we can do. Depending on how long Mr Malfoy was holding the arrow, we can estimate how long it will fade.”
She explains the two-way mirror has been a long-standing tradition among the Black family. She used to use it to communicate with her sisters whenever they didn’t want Regulus or Sirius listening in on their girl talk. Particularly Regulus who liked to tattle on them. Sirius must’ve figured out what charms to cast when he shared his shard to James, then Harry. Harry appreciates the story nonetheless and eagerly implores her to share some more things about Sirius.
As with every time Malfoy was mentioned Harry found himself straightening as if preparing for battle. One could never afford to be off their guard when one found themself in the presence of Malfoy. Who knows how many dirty tricks he has.
“Oh look at poor Potter! You’ve traumatised the boy!” Blaise piped up, enjoying the cringe attack Harry was facing. Harry merely gave him the two-fingered salute and pointedly plugged his ears with his hands, adding in a wandless isolated muffliato.
Harry wakes up and lays still. His body hasn’t moved since he fell. He hears footsteps walk toward him and sees the familiar face of Narcissa Malfoy. She notices his eyelids move and bends down.
, maybe he shouldn’t ever drink again. He shook his head, not too fast, it hurt too much if he did. “No no, you don’t seem like ‘the man’...”
The pillow next to Harry was now sliding off Ron’s face. Ron grabbed the pillow and prepared to throw it at Harry, smiling when he saw Harry start to relax. Harry’s previous anxious expression was now full of bright amusement. Ron smirked and picked up another pillow. Pillow fight it was.
, his mind sneered. How much more common could his last name be? It suggested a lineage of labourers. They were only popular through new money and luck.
Harry’s smile falls and his head twists. That voice is famil– Oh, it’s Ron. Well, it’s a good thing he made it while hearing Draco swear at him. He can only imagine Ron's face upon hearing what Draco sounded like earlier.
The man who fiddled with his collar nodded in gratitude, “yes. I want something free from alcohol, perhaps. I’ll have the daiquiri mocktail, please.” He turned to the man whose dark hair was slowly growing frizzier by the second, “darling, how about you?”
“Don’t be ridiculous Draco. You heard Flitwick, you might as well become a Hufflepuff if you take away your brooding.”
“It’s so peculiar to see how you two interact. If I didn’t know it was really you two, I’d think it was Polyjuice or something!” Hermione says, turning to Ron wanting him to agree with her. Which he does, nodding slowly. He is still kind of uncomfortable with their relationship, but Harry is clearly happy. Adding to the fact that he’s finally going to find out why they became so close, he thinks he can come around to the idea.
Moments later, the four are sitting on the Slytherin table, staring at each other. Harry and Draco on one side, Hermione and Ron on the other. Well, more like Hermione and Ron are watching as Harry and Draco have their reunion. Harry and Draco can’t seem to stop whispering into each other’s ears. Hermione and Ron can make out phrases like, ‘
“You said you couldn’t even say it! You’re disgusted by the thought of being tied to me! I don’t get why you wanted me to know. I would’ve been blind to everything, carried on with life just fine! But no! You couldn’t let me live in ignorance, could you? —” Harry had started to laugh in relief, “—what are you laughing at you berk? I should’ve known it was too good to be true that you and I could be friends. Well, at least now I know!” Harry made a move to grab Draco’s hand again, but he flinched away, “you don’t get to touch me!”
and he had no idea what to do. After careful reading of the book Hermione annotated for him, he knew that the glowing would continue until the person found their match. It was proven true as the glowing between Ron and Hermione had faded to a subtle pulsing regardless of whether they were apart or together.
This confuses Harry, he’s only seventeen. Surely seventeen years aren’t that long to an immortal being such as the angel before him.
’s watery eyes staring down at him. It leaves a bittersweet tang and brings a tear to his eye as he considers the
Draco groans into his table, irritated by his lack of attention. He murmurs a quiet thank you to Pansy and flicks to the next page to see what he can do to fix the mess. Sadly, he has no time to as Slughorn calls attention to the front.
It was the second night of the holidays and Harry was laughing with Ron and Neville by the fire. Ron and Hermione had agreed that it would be a good idea to stay for the holidays. Embrace what little childhood they had left, before braving the adult world. The three Gryffindors were warming themselves by the heat after the rather competitive snowball battle that occurred after lunch. It didn’t matter if you were in the same house, it was a free-for-all. Everyone who stayed in Hogwarts from first year to eighth had participated.
And so Harry continues, regaling Hermione with tales of Draco and him almost getting caught. Of how they would find every excuse to touch each other during their staged fights. Of how close they got to just kissing each other in the corridors between classes. Of their time in the library, partially studying, partially kissing. Of their late-night walks by the lake. Of the times Draco snuck his broom out pulled Harry on so they could go on late night flights. Of how the two became friends from enemies. Of how they evolved into lovers.
“It’s okay Harry. I understand. Fate has been too kind to me, letting me live. I should’ve expected that that’s all I’d get.”
Apparently, another person agreed with this and started to spread the idea that staying for the holidays would be a good idea. And if a party was to occur, then all the better, they thought with a grin.
Harry bit his lip as he walked in, trying to blink back the tears. He thought of little Teddy, the bubbliest, loveliest little boy who had Harry’s heart in the palm of his hands. Perhaps there would be something in here that he could give to the boy, in memory of his father.
The hair on the back of his neck rose, and Harry resisted the urge to shiver. That teasing tone, along with the posh accent and low baritone was so familiar. Not just that, but only one person could say his last name and make it seem like an insult alone.
Draco throws a confused look at the two but brushes it aside. It’s something he can ask about much later.
Like a meerkat, Draco sat up and stared around, finally noting that they weren’t alone. He groaned in embarrassment, his cheeks and ears turning a delightfully bright Gryffindor red.
Harry turned and took his phone from Kreacher. He flipped it open and saw a few texts from Hermione. He clicked through and opened them.
Now, he was looking at one of the two he had left to apologise to. He looked as the other boy nodded his head to invisible music. If Draco hadn’t thought he was crazy before, the boy’s actions only confirmed it. No, he shouldn’t think like that. For the majority of the Wizarding population in England, that boy was a hero. And no longer would his sanity be questioned.
“It’s my parents' anniversary tomorrow. I have quite a specific request, but if you’re up for it, you can do it.”
Harry clicked the username (@draconis) and promptly choked on the biscuit in his mouth. He clocked the little rainbow flag in the bio and scrolled through.
It’s the green eyes that brings the memories back. Of laughter and music echoing in a large room. Of how soft grass feels beneath their exposed thighs and how salty the sea tastes.
“How have you guys been? I haven’t seen you since your birthday, Harry!” Dean had finally removed his earphones to be part of the conversation. Neville slumped on the window, still asleep.
Draco stared at the man resting peacefully by his side. Everywhere they touched was warm to him. He leaned his head against Harry’s shoulder and sighed happily. Harry looked up from the letter he was reading and stared at Draco. They stared at each other lovingly for a minute.
His target walked into the common room at that moment. All thoughts flew out of his head at the sight of
“Harry, my dear boy!” Slughorn turns to Harry who is slowly packing his bag, no doubt eavesdropping in on the conversation.
I've re-read it plenty of times. But I might have missed some errors and/or typos so please forgive me for that.
. They were merely people who shared the same blood. Family is supposed to be warm and welcoming. Something the Dursleys weren’t.
“Hey, indeed. Robards just sent a memo, there’s a new mission. Transatlantic. How do you two feel about Canada?” He spoke as fast as he could so he could get away quicker. He was all too familiar with the Honeymoon phase so he wanted to leave posthaste.
Draco shook his head, but he seemed too fast. Like he was expecting it. “None more than usual. I’ll just get the–”
, he thought. He licked Harry’s neck and savoured the gasp Harry let out. He had somehow gripped Harry’s hip with his other hand. Throwing caution to the wind, he bit down and
Harry stared at the glass for a few seconds, “I was told not to talk to strangers, or accept things from them.”
Gulping, Draco continued and stared at what lay before him. This was the tenth session they had together, but each time left Draco wanting more. He felt Harry’s breathing on the back of his neck before he heard him speak.
That was another unforeseen development. When Draco had approached him, Harry was so surprised by the lack of glowing around Draco that his silence was taken as an acceptance to his apology. When Ron found out, he laughed so hard that Harry hadn’t talked to him for two days.
“A boy, a half-blood, filled with magic quite different from the gods. He is said to defeat a dark threat that ravages Albion.”
Opening the door brought a sense of nostalgia, as it always did. There was a pile of dark chocolate bars on the nightstand, no doubt expired. Dust particles flew in the air where sunlight shone through the curtains. The faint smell of dog remained in the carpet.
After the revelation from their previous meeting, Harry told Dumbledore. He was apparently already aware of what Draco was doing. He had intercepted the wine and necklace in time before some third party could become seriously injured. The castle wards alerted him of the cursed objects entering and it was not hard to guess who they came from.
Draco looked down at their hands, “you didn’t act as if you liked me when I was basically draping myself all over you. What was I supposed to think? I thought you were annoyed with me; wanted nothing to do with me. I thought you wanted to get rid of me. To finally be free–”
Draco stops talking, turning to Harry. He isn’t sure if Ron and Hermione are aware of the dark times in Harry’s life. It isn’t for him to reveal. Harry merely nods, letting him carry on.
He had no idea why he was even entertaining Malfoy. He should have walked away, and ignored him. But the sight of Malfoy dressed in Muggle attire seemed to fry his brain and render him incompetent.
Mark noted down her order and went around the table, maintaining eye contact with each person when it was their turn.
Harry sighed happily and decided to give it another shot – this time hugging him from behind instead, “Merlin you’re the best.”
“This century please.” Pansy drawled, giggling toward the end. She was definitely feeling the effects of the firewhisky.
Draco’s eyebrows furrowed, “you kiss idiots? Should I fear for Granger and Weasley’s relationship? Or is that a thing you three do?”
“That was you? You bastard! I had– I had... to order a whole new set of robes! Those spells were permanent you fucktard!” Draco snarled, some words a slurred.
“Potter and Draco, don’t you look darling, don’t you look cosy?” Pansy said, sitting down while politely tucking her skirt under her thighs. She had taken to the situation like a dog with a bone.
“I can see the direction your thoughts are heading toward. Cease that at once. Harry’s the best thing that’s happened to me. If anything, he should be the one looking elsewhere. Nothing he can do wrong will ever push me away. Know that.”
“I apologise for how touchy I’ve been the past few weeks. I know how much I can get, I tend to ignore things like personal space.” Draco was purposefully sat on the opposite side of the sofa. Their legs were stretched out in the space between them, hence why it was so easy for Harry to push the soles of their feet together.
“Morning Neville.” Ron greeted, his hands were digging through his bag. No doubt for the snack he had prepared for them. He took out five and passed them around, before taking out the bigger packet for himself. The Gryffindors already used to this simple rolled their eyes and dug into their brunch.
“I was going to, but if you’re going to take all my food I think I’ll find somewhere else to go.” He was only bluffing. And Harry knew it too, as he pointedly took another petit four while staring into Draco’s eyes. He raised an eyebrow as he finished it in two bites and winked when he finished. “Prat,” Draco muttered fondly. Harry only smiled in response.
He pulls out his Hawthorn wand. The one Harry grabbed from him months back. Draco covers his mouth and tears run free down his cheeks. He lost his mother’s wand in the Room of Requirement. But the fact that Harry is wandless means one thing.
Harry looked up from tying his shoelaces. He probably misheard Ron, so he continued onto his left shoe.
“Oh for fuck's sake!” Ron straightens up and leaves the room. “I’m going to talk to your mother. Maybe she has interesting stories about you Malfoy. I’ll save up on ammunition against you and then we can see if you want to share or not.”
Madame Pomfrey finally took over. She had been silent during Flitwick’s explanation, not having studied much about Eros’ arrow. “I’m sorry, but I’m afraid he’ll be stuck like this for a while. Mr Malfoy, you will be excused from Charms class until this business is over. I don’t want to risk exposing you to further siphoning, not until you are completely stable in your emotional state.”
The two laughed. Harry’s hand which was resting on Draco’s shoulder slid down to grasp his hand. He gripped tightly onto Draco’s fingers and continued to lead the way.
Malfoy tugged Harry to him, wrapping an arm around his shoulder and started to rub his cheek against Harry’s, “that’s fine with me.”
“My my, what an ostentatious thing to attempt. Do you believe you can do it?” His thumb found its way into Draco’s shirt, this time tracing up to his waist. Up and down. Up and down. It was maddening.
Of course, that was before he started Hogwarts. He had been told of the wonders of the school. How much pride his house had,
Who he promised to return to. Without really knowing why. He attributes it to adrenaline, a spur of the moment reaction.
Draco continued to watch Potter, and when he noticed Potter leaving his table, Draco made his move. He quickly emptied his goblet – which may or may not have contained some liquid courage – and followed. He wouldn’t have plenty of chances like this. And while he felt brave enough, he had to seize the opportunity.
They stayed in Harry’s room for a good two hours before leaving. They couldn’t keep their hands off of each other; be it a hand on the waist, or the soft touch of lips to the nape. Harry was happy, this time not from watching others’ romance blossom, but because of his own.
“Surely there’s something ethically wrong with that?” Harry asked, refusing to look to his left where he knew Malfoy was watching him. He hadn’t said a word since Flitwick entered, becoming shy all of a sudden.
Harry’s wide eyes were drawn to Malfoy’s lips before he could help himself,  “oh, no, no. Nothing like that. I just blanked out.” He quickly looked back at the roses, hoping his cheeks didn’t mimic their colour. If they did he could use the excuse that they were just reflecting.
Harry rolled his eyes and tried to play it off, “okay, fine. Let’s say I don’t know what you’re talking about. Care to elaborate?”
Draco kissed Harry’s lips to stop him from wasting time, “shut up.” He could feel Harry’s smile again, enjoying it turn into a frown as he pulled away. “and don’t think I didn’t know what you were doing. You closet-Slytherin.”
“I’m sure you want retribution for the… the way I acted. I apologise that I haven’t said sorry about that. I’m still trying to erase it from my mind and figured apologising for it, meant it happened. And I rather… none of it… did.”
The dark-haired man blinked at Mark. He wore glasses which hid how he was truly feeling – internally screaming, regretting everything, wanting to escape to the loo – and glanced at the menu, “I’ll have whiskey on the rocks. And keep it coming, if you please.” He gestured to the blond-haired man beside him, grasping his shoulder fondly, “he’s designated… err, driver tonight.”
“My beloved, the way your mouth curls into that grin I love, how your eyes sparkle when you have a sudden eureka moment... Gods even the way you hated me before even knowing me properly.” Harry shakes his head, “now that the veil is lifted from our eyes, it makes me wonder how we missed how obsessed we were with each other. I called you my
“Yes… I too would like to hear how that started. You two were always too shy to open up about it to me.”
He looks around the Great Hall, his lips pursed. Hermione copies him and gasps upon finding him. Alerted by Hermione, Harry follows the direction she is looking towards and finds himself struggling to keep his smile in. There Malfoy is, sitting on the Slytherin table. Ron isn’t surprised Harry hadn’t recognised him earlier, the soot from the Fiendfyre had darkened his previously noticeable bright hair. He has his knees drawn up, head in his hands. His shoulders shaking, obvious to anyone watching that he is crying. Ron is about to ask Harry what he’s going to do next, but before he can Harry breaks into a run to Malfoy. Without any hesitation, Harry is kneeling before Malfoy, talking gently. He comforts Malfoy, patting his shoulder. When Malfoy looks up at Harry, Ron is shocked to see Malfoy start hitting Harry’s chest with his closed fist. Harry doesn’t fight back at all, instead, he keeps trying to pull Malfoy towards him.
Malfoy’s eyes glittered, not disguising their mirth, “red roses, Potter? Surely you know what they mean?”
- having a reddish or golden glow. cont. from prompt #1 (Also, how much more Gryffindor of a word can rutilant be?)
Harry reached out to try and placate him but was gently shoved away. “I tried looking for an aura Draco. Especially after our friendship, I want nothing more than to see you happy the way you deserve. I’m so sorry.”
Harry gaped at her rant, he was sure that he had read the whole thing — back to front — multiple times when he first discovered what was wrong with him. Of course, he may have been reading fast, skipping sentences to get to the bottom of what to do… Okay, maybe she was right.
He reflected on earlier that day. They had their usual confrontation between classes in the corridor. For once, they were alone.
Harry flinched. He didn’t like the wording, but essentially that was indeed the case. “Yep. It seems that after making the world a safe place to live, I have also been tasked the job to see that everyone gets their happy ending with their loved one.”
Draco seemed to recover himself since he straightened and stood up. “Okay, that’s it. I’m getting you home.” He went over to Harry’s side of the table and picked him up by the elbow.
“My mother’s named after a flower, as well. The one thing that separated her from the Black family. I presume that’s why she’s so different from them,” Malfoy confessed.
Harry shook his head, perfectly content to ignore the man behind him, “no I’m perfectly happy with you to take creative freedom in this. What did the book tell you was best?”
Draco, raising his free hand to play with Harry’s hair, twirling the curls between his fingers, laughs. “Mmm, yes. Imagine my surprise when it was actually the notes of a previous student  who had edited the Potion’s textbook.”
“I am no angel,” he says. Tilting his head from side to side, as if cracking the bones. “Completely different belief system, I’m afraid.”
Draco feared that what he said would get back to father. Father wasn’t the most forgiving of men. Much less so to his own child. A child that should be perfect no matter what.
Ron’s face sours. Every time he’s reminded of that fact, he laments on what could have been instead. Harry as part of the Weasleys, Harry free from Malfoy’s clutches.
“Mr Potter, how forward of you,” Draco teases, already unholstering his wand. Knowing what Harry is suggesting towards, he pushes it against Harry’s neck, his free hand pulling at Harry's collar. “You look so good like this Harry. So pliant, so
Cally reappeared from behind the counter, wondering what all the noise was, and was about to approach them when she saw she wasn’t needed. It was as if a lightbulb lit in her head, as she watched the two men laughing together.
As the years passed, Harry learned something about himself. Laughter really was the best medicine, as well as a way to get out of strange situations. Which he was sure was what he was currently in. Malfoy stared at him, bewildered for a minute before he, too, joined in.
The third time Draco reunited with the green eyes he has come to love — without really knowing why — is in the Room of Requirement.
Draco glanced at the picture frame opposite him and pointed out how similar Harry was to his parents, “it’s like you inherited a perfect mixture of them. You’re perfect,” Draco said.
The gate groaned as he pushed against it. Some flecks of rust rubbed off against his skin and stained the palm of his hand. He tutted and rubbed it off against his jeans. He walked up the familiar pathway and stopped before his parents grave. He tapped against the marble and squatted, ignoring the sharp pain from his knee.
They remain in their position for who knows how long. But it appears to be long enough since Draco starts to hear voices near the end of the corridor. He pulls away and leans his forehead against Harry’s.
Draco noticed Harry’s shadow and looked up, raising an eyebrow in question. He came in early to practice for his own speaking test, and from the way Harry was staring at him, he could only guess what this was going to be about.
“As I said in class, that arrow is a siphon. It didn’t remove Mr Malfoy’s negative emotions and destroy it. His emotions remain in the arrow. There’s no telling how extreme those emotions are. I recommend him touching the arrow every two days for a few seconds to reabsorb them. To make him suddenly face it… I’m quite sure it could mentally kill him. He’ll be too overwhelmed.” Flitwick turned to Madame Pomfrey, to ensure his advice was sound. She silently nodded in agreement.
Hermione’s eyes sparkled as she smiled. “No doubt I will be, and hopefully you will too. Just in advance, I want you to know… I’ve known about it the whole time and I’m not mad about it. You, out of everybody deserve happiness and if that’s what makes you happy, far be it from me to turn you the other way. Ron and I were talking and we’re okay with it.”
’s the clumsy one, who mumbles through his words. Draco feels his lips graze against his neck and he feels his face redden.
He nodded to himself and, knowing it would be stupid of him to even stand up and walk, he crawled over to where he kind of remembered Harry sat. He was happy to know he wasn’t wrong because there he was. Harry. In front of him. And… Did he look scared? Somewhat. But with the way he was leaning in to Draco implied some sense of eagerness.
“Present!” Harry sat up, forgetting he wasn’t in class. Everyone laughed at his obvious embarrassment and looked to who called on him. It was Terry Boot and he was waiting for Harry’s answer. “Uhh, fuck it. Dare.”
Apollo nods, “you always were a bright boy when necessary. Yes, Patroclus is somewhere down there. However–” here he hesitates slightly “–you may know him as Draco.”
Harry smiled and made his way over to the empty space next to Draco. Things were already looking up.
More confident, Draco grasped the arrow’s body and lifted it, laughing when he couldn’t as it was heavier than he thought. He looked back at Harry and smiled, elated that he wasn’t feeling the need to shout at Harry.
Without any hesitation, Harry had opened an invitation to Narcissa and Draco to stay in the Noble House of Black. He’s aware of how Draco felt about Malfoy Manor and isn’t surprised at Narcissa’s easy acceptance to the invite. As if sensing true Blacks are finally in the ancestral home, Grimmauld Place loses some of its darkness. Either that or Kreacher is too ashamed at the state of the home and cleans everything he touches.
In the spirit of Christmas and goodwill, Draco Malfoy thought it would be a good idea to start making amends before the winter break. He’s already successfully apologised to the majority of the returning eighth years. There’s only four left who he has to apologise to, and he’s left them for the end for a reason. Courage. Or rather, the lack of it. The final four he has to apologise to are the people who were tormented by him the most. He was frightened of not being forgiven. Rather, he’s expecting to be spat at, probably hexed beyond any form of recognition.
There were some serious times when the two were left alone and Malfoy’s head would rest on Harry’s shoulder. “I’m sorry,” he said once to the empty common room. Harry flinched and looked down at Malfoy, “I forgive you” he replied.
Harry raised an eyebrow and turned to the little table they kept by the coatrack. Draco flushed slightly and returned to the battle of shoes and laces. He kept one hand raised, waiting for Harry to take the food. When he did, Draco mumbled
It seemed that wherever Harry was, Draco was soon to follow – if they weren’t already together, that is. As much as it bothered Harry, he found himself getting used to it. So used to it that he was scared to see how this attempt of restoring Draco’s emotions would go. He almost didn’t want to go back to ignoring each other. He wasn’t sure if this would be the one that would bring the old Draco back.
With dread, he realised what was going to happen. He could no longer take any more of this. He was going to become a recreant.
As a Malfoy, it was bred into Draco since childhood to dissimulate. He was a blank façade; impenetrable from outsiders. He would say one thing but think another. No one would be the wiser.
Harry carries on talking about the different properties of wood, oblivious to the fact that Draco has faded away into his thoughts.
Naturally, Malfoy would lose his marbles and speak poems into Harry’s ear. Words so pure and loving that it would leave Harry blushing. Once, Malfoy attempted to be seductive, but Harry put an end to that immediately.
Harry glared at her and turned to Draco, whose eyes were sparkling with delight now that Harry’s attention was on him. Irises still encased in that pink tint, letting Harry know it wasn’t real. Harry searched his eyes, trying to find if the real Malfoy was still there.
Well, he was here now. It was late in the evening, yet the summer sun refused to go down. He hoped the breeze wouldn’t be strong enough to lift his overgrown fringe. He’d hate for his Golden Boy reputation to ruin this visit.
He waited for the common room to clear up a bit. During which the sun had set, and, together with the warm fire, a rutilant haze trailed throughout the room. There were only two other people aside from Potter sitting around. They seemed to be preoccupied, and this was probably the only time Draco could corner Potter alone.
“Not if I can do something about it. C’mon Malfoy… Draco–” Draco looks up to the sound of his name on Harry’s lips, “tell me.” Harry’s eyes are pleading.
provides. He traces the inside of Harry’s mouth and groans at what he finds. His hands lower and fall into Harry’s back pockets. Inwardly, he is pleased they both removed their robes when they entered the classroom. He grasps Harry’s bum and squeezes, eliciting another groan.
He spotted the bright ginger-haired Weasley towering over the brunette attached by his side. They were, for once, alone and sitting on a bench having a quiet discussion among themselves. Draco surveyed the area around him and saw that they were the only occupants in the courtyard. He checked the time on his watch and realised this time was the best chance he’d get. With a deep inhale, he shoved his hands into his robe pockets and walked into enemy territory.
After that failed attempt, Draco was worried about his last victim – er, person-to-beg-forgiveness-from. He was heading to the Herbology section of the castle when Potter joined him. Draco almost tripped on a loose pebble but maintained his balance thanks to the many years of decorum training.
“No no, the sun is le soleil, I said soûle… sooow leeeh. Not suh ley…” Harry looked into the glass. Honestly, when
Harry felt his heart breaking at Draco’s words, “no. You don’t get to decide if I forgive you or not. That’s my choice, and I am forgiving you. Whether you like it or not. You’re human, you made mistakes. You atone for them and better yourself. You’re aware of what you did and you will do what you can to correct the error of your ways. I know you were blending into the background during the past few months, but if you want to be forgiven, you must apologise. You’ve already apologised to me, so there’s step one.”
“Are you staying for the game?” He asked, taking one of the petit fours Draco had brought from the food table. “Mmm, raspberry.”
He suddenly remembers how Draco reacted to him in the Room of Requirement, even further, in his family Manor.
“Brilliant party mate! I still have flashbacks from it. I doubt I’ve ever drunk that much since the end of May!” Seamus’ smile was contagious and Harry found himself mirroring it.
He thought about their mutual friend and supposed it would be time to use the friendship to his advantage. He looked around the common room for Draco and was pleased to see him at the table they regularly occupied.
Wanting to prevent conflict, he timidly asks, “like the constellation?” Harry remembers reading about planets in year 5. Things like the Milkyway and galaxies far away. Places where his aunt and uncle don’t exist. Places he’d like to run off to. He’s grateful he’s found Hogwarts, it’s far, and he hopes it’s far enough.
In the days waiting for the next session, Harry and Draco talked more. Now that Draco was less clingy and praising Harry with fewer sonnets, conversations seemed easier to initiate. Draco apologised profusely for making a spectacle of himself. He would turn pink every time Harry would bring up one of the poems Draco had made for him.
Harry wiggled on his stool in the classroom, enjoying the fact that one leg was shorter than the others. The noise of his chair was overpowered by the excited discussion of his classmates as they waited for Flitwick to arrive and begin class. Today was about the art of siphoning. Flitwick had prepared the class for a week, telling them to think about what object they were interested in using. He had engaged the class with the tale of Eros’ arrow, telling them he’d bring it with him as a demonstration.
Harry stood up and took the box and frame with him. He placed the box on the dresser and formulated a plan. He’d come back to tidy the room at a later date, his priorities suddenly changing. Maybe he would do something simple, for the time being. A simple visit to his parents, and some lovely flowers…
Harry relaxed, knowing that Draco wasn’t going to start throwing hexes. Only, he became alarmed as tears started to pool in Draco’s eyes. His smile started to disappear and he struggled to breathe. His grip was so tight on the arrow that when he fell to the ground, it moved slightly toward the edge of the table.
Without much thought, Harry reached out and grasped Draco’s hand and led the two of them to where Flitwick was waiting. He smiled to himself when he heard Draco gasp and tightened his hold. Maybe they could remain as friends when this thing ended. He felt Draco walk faster so he could lean his head on Harry’s shoulder as they walked.
the book I gave you Harry? Honestly, you’re worrying about nothing! Go read the book after class, and talk to Draco. Bring the book, in case he doesn’t believe you. I wish you would pay attention to the little details more often, it would save all of us a lot of trouble.”
Harry looked back into Draco’s eyes. The pink tint had faded over time, but it was still present. He found himself missing the cloud-grey eyes. He gestured for Draco to come closer. Before long Draco was settled on top of Harry’s lap. Both closed their eyes at the comfort the other brought. Harry’s hand naturally settled on top of Draco’s hair and he played with the soft strands.
Draco’s breath decided to become a thing of the past. Was his hearing playing up? Or was this a hallucination? A side effect of Eros’ Arrow which was displaying his inner desires?
Harry bit his lip and nodded. He let Draco sit down first before he fished out the book. Holding it made what he was about to say seem real all of a sudden. Frankly, he was terrified.
which would only result in him catapulting himself onto Harry. Harry had no choice but to hug him as a way of steadying them, instead of collapsing under his weight. Those who witnessed this took great pleasure in Harry’s discomfort and Malfoy’s laughter.
“What a silly name. It sounds so weird, don’t you think Harry?” His new friend turns to him, anticipating for him to agree.
“If you want to find out, wait for later. Otherwise, I’m going to ignore you.” Draco replied, beckoning more of his Slytherin brethren to come over. It was getting awfully crowded with Gryffindors.
He ignored everyone’s stare and used his wand to bring a bottle over to him so he could refill his empty glass. After that, he swallowed it down like a shot and ignored the laughter. He laid down on his back, not caring anymore that he was showing how much these dares were affecting him.
He holds his mother’s wand tightly in his grasp, leaving it dangling at his side. He does not want to come across as threatening.
Draco is almost tempted to vanish his mess of a potion, before realising that getting some sort of grade is better than getting a zero overall. He is so immersed in his tidying that he gets surprised when he hears a cough to his side.
“People generally don’t. But it explained a lot of things. There was a time where I thought I wasn’t attracted to anyone at all, in that way. Which of course, changed when I met someone.”
“How come you don’t have a sobriquet for me?” Harry suddenly asked, his voice quiet, so as to not disturb the peace settling around them.
He noticed the man beside him. He was slowly sipping a clear liquid. His bright crystal-like eyes watched the whole room with precision Harry didn’t think he could ever accomplish in his current state. The man was dressed very casually. He wore a tight cream turtleneck under a dark denim jacket. The jacket had multiple pins on the collar. One was a badge saying ‘Potter stinks’. The words brought a sour memory to his mind, but he couldn’t figure out why. He picked the coaster off his cheek and sat up with a sigh.
Draco tumbles over an old journal and loses Harry. He gulps and surveys the room, trying to find an escape. Like lava, the ground is slowly being eaten by the
Harry looked down, finding a flower nearby that Draco had missed. He plucked it and twirled it around, the light pink petals turning into a circle from the speed. He stopped and rubbed the petals between his fingers, feeling the velvety texture.
Harry thought, observing how Ginny and Luna sat close to each other. Their auras merged into a gorgeous blue and Harry couldn’t stop the smile on his face. Maybe, just maybe he could do it…
“Harry, did you find yourself reach a dead-end trying to match another couple? I know I offered to help, but I don’t think I have any fresh ideas…” His voice trailed off when he seemed to notice how nervous Harry was. “Okay, let’s have a seat and why don’t you tell me what’s up when you’ve calmed down?”
Harry lets out an uncomfortable laugh and makes a move to rub the back of his neck. Draco beat him to it, threading his fingers through the hair on Harry’s nape. Harry tilts his head forward, relishing in the sensations Draco gives him.
“Yes, while that may be the case, Boy Wonder over here is never very good at keeping his words to himself. Thoughts shouldn’t be shared all the time. I understand that is the way in the red and gold life, but it’s truly tedious.”
Harry considered it for a minute. He had nothing else planned for the next two hours. Aside from visiting his parents, later on, he was free for most of the day. He nodded and opened the door, allowing for Malfoy to exit first. And if it allowed for him to have a little look, why not?
His current match in the works was none other than Neville and Seamus. When he first saw the auras blend Harry had been shocked. He was expecting Dean and Seamus to have a connection, but just the other day Dean had revealed his choice to remain single for the remainder of the year. And Harry respected that. He also respected couples whose auras didn’t merge at all. He wouldn’t get in the middle of a fight like that, it would be wrong. But should the couple break up, he’d happily assist then.
Harry shifts slightly when he feels a wand poking his back. He remembers Malfoy’s wand in his back pocket and takes it out before handing it to Malfoy who gasps when he touches it.
He recalls a past of two boys growing up side by side. In fields of green; staring into eyes of green; waiting for figs to ripen from their green. One boy is slightly taller, the other leaner. They have a close bond formed with laughter, sweet as honey. Simple joys of juggling figs and caressing touches come to the front of his mind.
He brushed his thumb against his lips, deep in thought. The sensation brought back the memory of another’s lips grazing against his. He shook his head as if to remove it from his brain. He couldn’t go there. That was a fruitless venture.
Harry wakes up to a field. He is on top of a hill. Soft music plays in the background, a familiar tune that he cannot place. There are birds chirping sweetly as if it were spring.
“If you can’t be the brave one, I guess it falls on me, just this once,” he said, playfully squeezing Harry's cheeks together. He leaned down and pressed his lips against Harry’s pouting lips.
Malfoy takes a seat at the newly cleaned area and looks around the mess hall. Plenty of the ministry employees are on their lunch break with them. He appears to not appreciate this as he casts the all-time favourite Muffliato.
Sensing a change in mood was needed, Malfoy revealed that it was his parents’ twenty-sixth-anniversary tomorrow. As if Harry hadn’t been eavesdropping. Harry appreciated the change in topic, regardless. It used to be a busy affair so Malfoy would be in charge of some decorations. He would arrange to get the floral decorations the day before and use a specialised stasis spell to keep them fresh. But since Lucius’ death two years ago, Narcissa just wanted to keep things simple and quiet. Harry could understand that.
Frankly, Harry isn’t surprised at the revelation. He’s the Boy-Who-Lived, the saviour of the Wizarding world. What’s more, another title?
Hermione’s eyebrows raised, and she stood up so fast Ron fell off the couch. “I might’ve seen something like this… There was a book somewhere… Maybe upstairs? The library? I…” her eyes glazed over, the endless possibilities of what she could read about it was making her mouth water. A new mystery for her to solve, and she couldn’t wait to get to the bottom of it. “Maybe I could OWL McGonagall and she could let me access the library for a bit or—” her voice faded as she walked into the library of Grimmauld Place.
. He remembers how the eyes shuttered and hid, hurt from Ron’s words, before hardening into the steely grey it is now.
It does not take much effort for the two to lean into each other. The sparks Draco used to feel return. There is a warmth creeping into his heart, as if glue, mending the breaks of past and present. His hand moves, without his accord, to grip Harry’s nape. Bringing him tighter, closer. He ignores the glasses pressing into his cheek. The only different sensation, but he can deal with it. He just wants to be as close to Harry as he can.
A glow lit up from the wand of one Harry Potter. His expression was hidden behind the shadows of his fringe. Draco knew what he would find though. A troubled gaze disguising a triumphant gleam. Draco was used to it by now. Harry was often conflicted about what they did at the start, but once they got going, he was
“Are you finally back with the rest of us?” He asked, gently placing the glass on top of another coaster. His one seemed cleaner than the one Harry pried off his cheek. His tone suggested that he was very done with Harry, but surely he must have been a nice person if he had stayed by Harry’s side.
“Yes, I’m sorry if you’re busy with other things, but I really need help with our speaking test. Hermione was supposed to come in and help me with it, but she isn’t feeling too good. Do you think you could test me on some things? I mean– only if you’re free, that is.” Harry wriggled his toes in his shoes, hiding how anxious he was. He was
“Is something troubling you Harry?” Flitwick asked, pulling himself up to sit onto his table. He was the perfect image of a concerned teacher, wanting to guide the wayward youth.
Hermione had come back after three weeks and declared what was going on with Harry. It wasn’t a very well-practised skill, but she surmised that once the Horcrux had left Harry, some innate gifts that were previously unknown made themselves present.
Harry sat up and paused. He picked the book up again and looked at the lines, tracing his finger against the words, “they emit… light… invisible… emit no aura… Oh. Oh!”
– with a kiss. It was a quick, chaste kiss, yet it was enough to give him a deep blush. Draco caught sight of Harry’s ears and was glad to know he wasn’t the only one unaffected.
, he suddenly thought. Why did he think something as simple as, “Hey, we’re soulmates after all” would make everything okay? He couldn’t do this, he was a coward and for the first time, he wanted to back away from the challenge. For one thing, his one fear was the rejection Draco would give him. He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to handle it. Maybe they’re better off as friends, maybe Draco and Harry would find love along the way and Draco wouldn’t be the wiser. Maybe—
Three years had passed and Harry finally managed to clear the third floor of Grimmauld Place. It had been renovated to house two extra people, one Teddy Lupin and one Andromeda Tonks. Harry offered his home to them, once he deemed it safe enough. In Teddy’s room was Remus’ box. Harry and Teddy would spend nights reading the letters out loud, sharing their parent’s stories. Harry had given him the flying key which Teddy proudly hung from his ceiling.
, he thought, remembering the matching pair in the basket of mismatched socks. “What’s in it for me?”
The four turn and see Narcissa. She is dressed in her normal morning attire, a relaxed silk gown with a ribbon of the same material tying it closed around her small waist. Her hair is straight and unstyled, and her face has an easy smile. A smile that grows into a grin upon seeing twin blushes on Harry and Draco’s cheeks.
Reincarnation is a concept that Harry never considered before, but it is interesting to hear. He has more questions, but he knows Apollo has more to say. The questions could wait for later.
He took his phone out once more and saw that Ginny had messaged him privately on Instagram. The message was simply someone’s account, with her caption of
The two decant the potion into seven vials and move onto to brewing the antidote. Only, Harry thinks it’s too late for them to take it.
Harry tried not to choke on his spit, but Draco’s smile was something of a wonder. It was rare to witness lately, but whenever he did Harry couldn’t stop himself from staring. The smile had softened Draco’s features, made him seem more boy-like. As if last year’s horrors weren’t behind his haunted eyes. Though this was a gentle smile, it still made a difference in Draco.
With that comes acceptance. He is welcomed into the fray and he follows them. He will follow Harry wherever he goes. Always.
Harry’s mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. He was out of his element, confused and slightly warm. His hand twitched, unsure whether he should grip Malfoy’s hand back or twist away. The whimper from earlier echoed in his memory, Malfoy didn’t want him to let go.
Harry rolled his eyes. It was a good thing he had nothing planned tomorrow then, he supposed. He pocketed his phone and walked back into his kitchen and grabbed a glass. He was thirsty and required watering. Hold on, that made him sound like a plant. He really did need more sustenance, a light snack, perhaps. He filtered through his cabinets and found some bourbon cookies.
! He hated how weak he must have seemed, a lovestruck idiot that people would mock him for years to come. Merlin, he’d never hear the end of it!
Harry’s ears started to warm, and he knew they were turning red. He, fortunately, wasn’t a blusher in the cheeks. He thanked Hermione for telling him to keep his hair long, as it kept his reddening ears hidden. He knew exactly what Pansy was implying, he wasn’t as oblivious as everyone liked to think of him as. But he did enjoy acting like he was. So act he did.
