He titled his head to look at her. Her face had shrivelled up in displeasure. He shifted his head back towards his desk and ignored her.
“Morning Draco” said Blaise, he snapped his book closed. “you’ll never guess what I found this morning”.
“Yes” responded Draco without giving her time to respond he continued “while in said forest we couldn’t find a way out. We were unable to escape, and I must have fallen asleep as I woke in my bed. We have been repeating this day”
“I think not” Malfoy said as he lunged at Harry.
“I guess?” mumbled Potter. They sat watching the students move through the field, Draco guessed it must be past 5th period now. They had spent a few hours in the library. Useless hours thought Draco. But the fight hadn’t been, in fact after their brawl Draco felt quite spritely. He really should beat Potter up more often if it lifted his moods this much. He watched Potter fly around the hoops. He was leaning slightly to left favouring his side. Draco had contemplated healing him, but Potter deserved the pain. Attacking him like some kind of feral animals. What did you expect from a Half-blood? Most of Draco’s wounds were healed as roughly as they could be, one learnt a lot living in a manor filled with Death Eaters. Draco winced as his nose tinged, he still needed to learn how to fix broken things. The body could really be boiled down to furniture. He could heal the fabric and remove stains, but the woodwork was still a mystery. With his experience it would hurt more tomorrow. Draco paused. Or maybe not. The wardrobe had returned to it’s original state why not his body?
“Dinner? What’s the time?” asked Potter.
He stood in front of the room of requirements. I must succeed, I must, for my father and my mother. He breathed deeply before he entered the room. He weaved through the rubbish and forgotten items until he found the wardrobe. He spent the rest of the day working on the damned thing. Draco knew that it was important to not to raise suspicion, it was the only thing his godfather ever mentioned. But he’d waisted all of his previous evening wandering with Potty Potter. He’d might as well make up for the work he’d missed. By the end of the day he had managed to decipher most locks around the wardrobes magic.
“Zabini!” Harry called as he stepped through the Slytherin door “Malfoy asked me to see him” he walked by and waited for the same response.
She appeared in a dressing gown and eyed their transformed face.
It went like this for a while, the back and forth between the two boys. Both of them proving they knew better than the other without revealing what they actually knew.
He followed Potter as he flipped through over and around the quidditch stands. Potter weaved between the beams, and Draco felt reminiscent of one of his first flights as seeker for the Slytherin team. Potter looped up and over to land behind Draco, he then rolled to the right and vanished. Draco huffed in annoyance and barrelled into the same direction. He crashed through the stand’a fabric and caught Potter heading to the school. Draco felt his blood thrum as he rushed to chase Potter. As the building loomed over head Draco was sure Potter was going to go through the front entrance. At the last minute he pulled his broom up and shot up the front of the building. A dangerous move that Draco followed precisely. As he flew up the front of the building, the windows rattled his mist. At the top of his ascent he felt himself drop in a free fall to find Potter, who was speeding through the courtyard. Draco bent his broom down closing the distance between the two. Again, Potter pulled up sharply and Draco followed him. Neck and neck, he chased Potter. His heart pounded in his chest and the wind deafened his ears.
“What were you thinking?” asked Pansy, she smoothed her skirt and gave Blaise another look. A move she’d probably learnt from her mother.
Draco flashed into awareness. He pushed back the covers and hopped out of bed. Potter hadn’t woken him again. He didn’t bother with clothes, he simply pulled on his warmest rope and marched through the dorms.
Malfoy stiffened. Gently, he placed his goblet down and withdrew his hands under the table. Harry assumed Malfoy had his wand aimed at him. Harry pushed his plate away and slapped his head onto the table. It made a loud thunk as his skull vibrated with the wood.
“Fucking, shut up! You filthy half-blood!” Shouted Draco he aimed a hex at Potter, but Potter shielded again. Potter was laughing hard now, leaning on his side until he fell further and started coughing. Between coughs he said “You’re lost” and then laughed harder.
“The forbidden forest” asked Ron?
“Ron, did Seamus blow up his cauldron yesterday or the day before?” Ron’s eyes glazed over in memory
“This is a battle you’ll lose Malfoy” Potter called
“That’s wonderful, I knew you two would be friends. You just needed to get over all this silliness” both Harry and Malfoy stiffened.
Somehow the whole looping thing had gotten him to forget. Outside was a man who would hurt and murder all the people he loved. He would ruin the world Harry knew. Harry’s eyes fell to his lap. How had he forgot? He turned to the Gryffindor table where his friends sat and watched him warily. What if they were only free if Malfoy killed him? His eyes flicked to Malfoy. The sharp realisation of death clung to Harry. He couldn’t let Malfoy kill him; the Wizarding World would be left undefended. Voldemort would thrive, he was the only one who could stop Voldemort. No one else, not even Dumbledore. Harry’s eyes began to prickle.
“Draco” someone was coming up behind him. He turned to find Pansy, her stance stiff and defensive
Harry head jerked from his pillow. He sat up in his bed, as his heart rattled in his chest. As the symptoms of his nightmare began to subside, he tried to deepen his breath. He couldn’t see past the darkness but as he waited for his heartbeat to settle, he recognised Ron’s heavy snoring and the shuffle of Seamus’ limbs. With a few harsh breaths he calmed himself. He knew he was in his room and he knew he was safe. Well, he huffed a laugh, as safe as Hogwarts has ever been. After he untangled his sweaty legs from his sheets he tried to get out of bed. He moaned in frustration as he pushed his way through the heavy darkness, finally finding his bed curtains.
“Don’t say anything” growled Harry.
“There’s no rules against walking down the halls” Potter chocked out. Draco sneered down at Potter. Draco took great pleasure in being taller than Potter, standing this close to him it was clear how short the twerp was.
Draco didn’t want to believe he’d left him, that he’d managed to escape and not brought Draco with him. He leaped from the Hall and headed to the Forest, ignoring calls of his name.
“I suppose that’s the nice thing about second chances” she sighed dreamily. She finished her breakfast and bid them farewell.
“I came to see Malfoy” Harry grumbled.
Potter regarded him. Both of their wands were still pointing at each other.
“And just a reminder, Apparition lesion will begin next month…” the rest of her sentence was lost in the shuffle of bags.
At lunch he heard the years whispering about it, Potter had disappeared. Over on the Gryffindor’s table, Potter’s followers bowed their heads together. Their faces churned with anxiety. He looked to the Professors table. Although, the headmasters face was unreadable, McGonagall looked worried.
“MALFOY” he shouted, loud enough for Goyle to shuffle in his bed.
And there it was again, the pressure. It is him! A shiver ran down his spine and he felt a pit well in his stomach. Fear - Draco was scared, he recognised the feeling instantly. This was worse than the dread in his house, it was like a river of ink filling his nose and mouth sucking him down. Draco grabbed onto the table to make sure he was still standing.
Everything in Draco froze. He shot to his feet and ran from the meadows.
“What’s your problem Potter? He’ll forget tomorrow anyway” sneered Malfoy
“And-?”
“you’re plenty slow already” laughed Potter. Draco threw him another hex which Potter deflected easily. He stood their looking at Draco. Draco turned back to the woods “are you coming?” he said. Potter didn’t respond, he faced Potter once more.
“Cuz he’s a wuss” replied Harry without looking away
“- right Draco” someone said.
“Yeah remember Seamus blew up the cauldron in potions, it was amazing” Ron’s eyes sparkled with wonder
“Have fun then” responded Zabini.
Harry’s eyes jerked around the room, the medieval Slytherins hanging on the walls seemed to mock his situation. Harry released his wand into his pocket and raised both his hands.
“Yesssss?” she asked
“Wait, you said all day what do you mean?”
“Malfoy gave me the password?” Potter tried again. Blaise looked to Draco who shook his head
“Good morning Pansy” he nodded his head gently. He waited for her response before crossing the threshold.
“Well she’s not here” Draco heard himself say. He sounded like a petulant child calling for his mum to protect himself. He pushed past Severus and left his office without a further word. He’d have to listen to this all again tomorrow.
Zabini pulled his foot away and Harry released the breath he was holding.
“Malfoy” called Harry, he couldn’t feel him under his hand. He walked blindly through the forest.
“Let’s discuss this at breakfast” Malfoy said as he pushed Harry through the door.
I know you’re under a lot of pressure, but this won’t solve anything. I told you not to draw attention to yourself. I promised your mother I would look after you. I swore an unbreakable vow.
“We’ve been cursed”
“Well where is it?”
“Brilliant” he grumbled.
Draco finished the last book on his list while he waited for Potter to finish his he thought back to his original query. How could he hex Potter before he shields? The other times he had managed to do it he had taken Potter by surprise. Either Potter was sleeping or when Draco had been inches away. He needed a spell that wasn’t noticeable when casting. Maybe something embarrassing? Maybe something to do with transfiguring?
“Here we are” said Zabini he bowed smoothly but his face mocked Harry. Zabini pushed the door open and with the other hand shoved Harry into the room.
“She knew exactly what buttons to push to get me here. How Slytherin, the old hag” Draco stopped on the edge of the forest. He took a deep breath and plunged into the forest. Professor Sprout had informed him that the type of sap they needed was found not by the trees on the outskirt of the forest. But that he would need to head into the forest and find a clearing with a yew tree.
Malfoy paused, “it’s behind a painting” Malfoy seemed to glow with pride.
Potter removed his hand from his face, he found blood on his palm. He touched his nose trying to staunch the flow.
Harry startled out of his bed. Drenched in sweat he hurried to remove himself from his sheets. He grabbed his wand and cast a quick tempus. 3 in the morning. How many times this week had that been? He flopped back onto his bed and huffed. Harry wasn’t sure what to do, he still felt anxious from his nightmare, but he was tired of every morning having to exercise himself into exhaustion. He could follow Malfoy again, maybe the git would be up early too? He sighed and rolled over to watch Ron sleep. Ron slept like some kind of beast; his limbs clumsily thrown across his bed. Or maybe a dog, some big lanky-
He eyed Blaise before he turned his attention to Potter. His face was heavily bruised, and he was hunched to one side. He’d been bound but it seemed extra effort had been put into a gag. There was something wonderful in the pain Potter was trying to hide. A thrill sizzled through Draco at Potters discomfort. For some reason he was missing one shoe and his sock. Draco spotted his shoe next to Blaise on the armrest. It was balanced like some kind of trophy
“You said we should visit the catalyst location which we believed was the forest, we entered it but to no success” said Malfoy while Harry finished his drawing.
“Yes, do tell, Potter” Malfoy said finally coming out of his thoughts.
“What if one of us needs to kill the other” said Malfoy as he sipped from his goblet.
“Malfoy, you git wake up” Harry said louder this time. Zabini was holding his sides laughing now. Harry didn’t know what he found so funny, but he could feel himself flush. Unable to take the teasing anymore. Harry hurried to Malfoy.
Lost in thought Draco found himself by the front entrance. He sat on a bench and let the sun warm his face. Why was he looping? Had someone cursed him. If he had there was no way of finding a solution. He contemplated finding his Godfather, but this seemed like it would only prove Severus unfounded belief that Draco needed help. He sighed. The only way out was if he could figure out what had set of the looping in the first place. He went back through his memories. His eyes flashed open. Potter, he’d followed him yesterday with the Weasel. It has to be him. Draco shot up ready to face Potter and his followers. But then that had been yesterday, he’d already been looping for some days. Draco sat back down and contemplated alternatives. But each solution seemed to be Potter. Things were mostly Potters fault. Settling on this fact Draco decided to get the answers from Potter.
“Good” Draco stood up and brushed his robes off. He turned back to the woods, he placed his wand in his hand and said, “Point me”. His wand turned in his palm but did not stop. It did not show any signs of stopping.
“Malfoy you prat” he could hear Potter shouting, but he didn’t stop. Draco ran as hard as he could turning every now and then to catch a glimpse of Potter’s beaked face.
“I don’t know why he chose potions” mumbled Hermione, she turned back to listen to Flitwick.
Draco waited for Blaise to mention Potter, but he didn’t. Draco assumed he hadn’t come this morning.
“Obviously” scoffed Harry. Malfoy face screwed up in annoyance and kicked Harry.
“You son of a whore” he shouted throwing another hex. Potter stumbled from the ground his face a mask of rage. But Draco’s anger was all consuming he fired hex after hex. The pain in Potter’s side seemed to slow him down. Until Draco had him pinned, Draco thanked whatever luck was on his side to be catching Potter unaware. Potter eyes flashed, but he couldn’t lift a finger not with Malfoy holding him still. He raised his wand and Potter’s body followed.
“Harry, its okay take a deep breath” said Hermione, she reached to pull Malfoy from Harry’s arm. As if sensing this he jerked from her and dropped Harry’s arm in the process. Harry pulled his hand through his hair and straightened.
“To squash a worm” responded Draco brushed off Blaise’ hand.
“That was-” began Malfoy
In the face of Potter all of Draco’s rational left him.
“Does he tell you everything?” Harry responded. He smirked at idea of Malfoy confiding in anyone. Malfoy is a git who has no friends Harry knew this fact and doubted any of them had any knowledge on Malfoys predicament. Neither did Harry’s friends, but that was beside the point. Zabini paused, shrugged and turned around. He walked to the end of the common room. He stopped and turned back to Harry; a sly smile played across his face.
“He’s just trying to get a rise from me” replied Harry
Harry shot from his bed; he was not listening to Ron’s dream again. Yesterday had been gross enough. Grabbing his kit and not caring about whether it was his on Ron’s he shuffled to the pitch.
“Yes, yes all day you’re a terrible friend, I’ve never seen Weasel so stressed” a smile crept up Draco’s face, his morning had been good. Suddenly Potter started hobbling.
He pretended to take notes as she watched him
“Don’t stop”
“Oh really?” he asked “that’s an interesting lie” Zabini lazily lifted his wand and proceeded to hex Harry.
“How long have we been in the forest?” asked Potter
Harry froze, he didn’t actually know the password, if Zabini asked he was screwed.
Draco felt his insides flip.
Out in the cold Scottish air, Harry flew hard and fast. Sweat dripped down his back and he couldn’t tell if it was the remanence of his dream or just new. What was Voldemort’s plan? How did Malfoy enter into it? In the forest why did he- Harry stopped his line of thinking, he turned sharply. In the distance he could see the Forest looming. What had he been thinking… Malfoy in… the forest? He flew closer to the Forest until he was just on the edge. He planted his feet on the ground and stared into the darkness. The trees hung heavily over his head. He remembered flashes of himself flying through the forest. And unconsciously felt his ribs. When had that happened? Was it a dream? He inhaled deeply; he still remembered the earthy smell from his dream. Deep and cold. He looked behind him, the sun was rising over Hogwarts and it reflected of the windows and across the lake, warm and inviting. He turned back to the Forest and stepped inside.
“We didn’t find anything yesterday, why would today be different?”
“Malfoy!” he shouted, fear threading through his veins. Unable to see where his feet placed below, he fell.
“This is the day you are repeating?” she asked.
“So” began Potter
“You can’t just keep hexing me until I give you an answer” grumbled Potter.
Draco turned from the group and continued his walk. He pushed the feelings down as far as he could. It did no good to be jealous of Potter.
“Zabini?” Harry asked, he was surprised to find anyone up at this hour.
“You shouldn’t goad Theodore like that” she said. Draco could feel Pansy ready herself for a rant.
“What?” Potter replied sluggishly.
Harry tried to explain but to know end.
“I didn’t want to waste any time”
His feet gently touched the floor and his legs flipped back up in response to the cold. He placed his feet on the ground, and hissed when the cold seeped in. His memory was murky, but he could place a forest of some sort and red eyes that gleefully watched him. It sounded like a Voldemort dream, not an odd occurrence but the frequency of these were beginning to annoy Harry. After a few half-hearted pats on his bedside table, he managed to find his glasses and slipped out of bed. Wand tucked into his sleeve, he shivered over to the bathroom.
When Lunch rolled around Harry was fuming, he hadn’t been here all day and his friends hadn’t noticed. Wait, He thought, Malfoy mentioned them.
“You’re not going to die” responded Draco
“McGonagall?” asked Malfoy
“I believe you” she said taking her glasses off and spelling them clean.
Harry watched Malfoy raise his hand and slowly Malfoy’s wand slid across the floor into its owners’ hand. Malfoy pointed his wand tip to his face and sliding it over his skin it started to heal. Harry’s mouth gaped. Healing magic was pretty advanced, especially for Malfoy. And the thing with his wand. That was wandless magic. Harry narrowed his eyes. Malfoy was pretty average a most things, Potions less so. Harry begrudgingly could admit that. He turned to his wand and tried to summon it, nothing happened. He imagined it was like summoning his broom. Up! He thought, it didn’t move. Malfoy bent and retrieved Harry’s wand. Harry frowned. He looked up to find Malfoy holding his hand out, his face a blank expression. Harry snatched his wand and cradled it to his chest. He hobbled to his feet and eyed Malfoy suspiciously.
“What are you talking about” he asked incredulously. It didn’t occur to Malfoy that if he was repeating the same day, Potter would know nothing about it.
McGonagall it seemed didn’t know much about time travel, but she did know how containment spells worked. It was a long process, but she explained to them how they needed to find whatever it was that was keeping them to try to break free. She didn’t believe brute force would help them and that I may do more damage. Additionally, it would do no help to find the caster of the spell. Once a containment was created it couldn’t be altered. Instead in order to escape they needed to learn and fulfil the magical requirements.
“Where too?” he asked
“It’s bloody early” moaned Malfoy
“You’ve been repeating the same day?” questioned Potter
He pulled Potter by his shoulder, ignoring his protest and lead the prat to the dining hall.
“Pomfrey healed you?” asked Ron slowly.
“You know I’m right Draco, nothing good will come from upsetting him” she reached over to brush her hand against his. He looked down at in in frustration.
“Potter” he shouted throwing a hex. It caught Potter on his side. He folded over in pain.
“They can trace your wand” whispered Potter.
“Should have brought a snitch” called Draco.
“We’re looping” Potter started. What a way with words Potter had.
“An identification spell, it had no affect” said Malfoy. He watched Potter from the corner of his eye and smirked.
“You asked in Parseltongue” said Draco. Potter looked at him in surprise.
“Ron” he began. Ron was pretending to focus on the lesson, he shook his head to try to deter Harry.
“Cheater!” Potter called to him. He changed his direction again and sped towards the forest. Not wanting to race Potter in the forest, Draco copied his move and pulled his broom up as hard as he could. Not trusting his skill in the forest, Draco climbed into the sky as hard as he could. Higher and higher he flew the clouds swallowing him full. He could see Potter gaining on him again.
He walked to the board to recreate the diagrams she had drawn two days prior. Harry hoped he had gotten some of the drawings correct.
“Zabini!” he called “Malfoy asked me to see him” he walked slowly eyeing the figure he knew was sat by the window.
“Don’t play coy Potter” spat Draco “I will torture the answer out of you”
Malfoys head smacked back onto his pillow before he huffed out of bed and into the bathroom.
“Potter” Malfoy called, he sounded farther away now.
“Won’t you just come back in uninvited?” asked Zabini his eyes followed Harry with an unnatural sharpness.
The room was similarly bathed in green light. Inside where three huge four-poster beds. Harry shook at the revelation that these beds where bigger than Gryffindor beds. In the light Harry could barely make out the owners. He could see a large figure in the left bed who was snoring loudly. In the middle he could see blonde hair and a pointy nose pointing to the ceiling, Malfoy probably. The last bed was empty, he felt Zabini brush behind him and headed to the empty bed. Zabini opened the trunk, he placed his items inside and then proceeded to sit on the bed. He crossed his legs and rested his head in his hand. He gestured to the middle bed with his other hand.
“I’m not bringing you with me” sighed Draco “you’ll slow me down”
“Potter at the rate you’re going we’ll miss dinner” Draco said, after Potter tripped, again.
“No you’re not listening” said Harry “I left in the early morning I didn’t get back until late…” Harry trailed of, he didn’t remember getting back. Ron and Hermione looked at each other
Harry tried to break free from his bonds, but he couldn’t wrangle his arms out. Wearily he regarded Zabini. He couldn’t believe he’d forgotten the fact that everyone forgot the looped days. How could he be so stupid, but then again, he was exhausted. He groaned once for his foolishness and second time for the foot that pressed into his stomach.
He laughed loudly and freely; in a way he hadn’t done since he was young. He finally made it outside. With one last look over his shoulder he tumbled down the hill in a most un-Malfoy way. His Mother would grieve for his clothes.
Harry tried to think about his friend’s relationship in a positive light. He was happy for them both. Wasn’t he? They needed something in these messy times, something to help them through. Maybe they needed something more than him? Especially with Voldy being back. Something to distract them from the sadness rolling in… What if this was it? Maybe Voldy wins, maybe this was his final year. Harry didn’t think he could win this year, not again. He’d been lucky all the past years, in fact he was amazed he’d even beaten Quirrell in his first year. Harry didn’t think he would have made it, not without his mates.
“Why on earth… when was this?” asked Ron “Wait, are you still going on about your dream?
It took him a while to pick up his courage to slip out of the lessons, and then afterwards he wondered the halls looking for Potter. He searched all the classes he could think off, the pitch and he’d even walked past the cupboard Room waiting to see if Potter locked himself in there.
“Malfoy you-“ Harry thumped his hands on the table. He suddenly noticed the stares and shifted back in his seat. Lowering his voice, he said “I don’t think you understand the position you’re in”
Harry saw red. In a flash Harry had lunged across the table and grabbed Malfoy. Malfoy grunted in shock his eyes widened to the size of Bezour stones. Harry raised his fist prepared to smash it into Malfoys face.
“Stupid Potter” he could hear Malfoy grumble.
“Bullshit, why are you following me?” he clenched Potter’s wrist, taking pleasure from Potters pained expression he tightened his hand.
“If you knew something why you didn’t say anything?” Harry asked annoyed.
As he rushed down the corridor, he heard footsteps following him. He was originally heading to cupboard but if he had a tail. He slowed to a more leisurely pace and the footsteps followed suit. Draco clenched his hands into fist, he couldn’t fail. He hurried around into the next corridor and turned to face his follower. There was only one prat stupid enough to act like this.
“Well I only remembered yesterday, and it’s not helpful” huffed Malfoy
“Potter? How did you get in here?” Zabini asked nonchalantly, his mouth quirked at the corner. Although Zabini’s face was relaxed the air around him felt tight. He dropped the pendant in his robe and shifted the book under his arm. He rose gracefully from his chair.
“Then I’m sure you don’t need to remind me” he answered
“We have to hurry” rushed Potter.
A crash resounded all over the hall as plates and goblets cracked.
“Nothing” finished Draco. Their eyes met and they looked away simultaneously.
“That’s unfortunate” said Ron.
Not needing to be asked twice Harry skittered out of the room. He leant against the door to gather his breath. Success.
“What?” said Potter. He stopped to look at Draco. “All day?”
“Well it can’t be a time turner” Harry’s face darkened. “They’re all gone, and the only time incident I know is the case of Phileas Haol.” Harry leant forward.
At the designated spot Draco stopped, he knew which spot he needed to be in by the hole in the tree to his right. He didn’t understand why it was here but here was where the mist appeared.
“Yeah” sniffed Malfoy, he pointed his nose up.
“How did you get passed Blaise?” asked Malfoy as they walked out of the dungeons
Draco frustration built, he looked up at the sky in defeat. Potters coughing subsided and Malfoy looked up to see Potter holding his broom and leaning on it.
She really was a thing, Draco thought. He felt fondness for her welling. Whatever Potter’s response she would use it against him. But even Potter wasn’t stupid enough to know that the odds where in his favour. Surely, he wouldn’t agree.
Harry paused, that explained how quiet it was. He pulled his textbook closer and began to read. Halfway through the first sentence Harry was noticed by Ron he was watching Hermione. Ron had been doing that a lot recently. Hermione looked up and Ron looked away. Ah, thought Harry it’s happening again. Harry felt like every time they played this game he ended up watching from the side-lines. He really wished Parvati hadn’t sat next to him the other day. She came over and frankly informed him how wonderful it was to see Hermione and Ron’s relationship change, how she couldn’t wait until they were official. Whatever that meant. So, he’d looked across to find them playing the staring game. And now he couldn’t not notice. He was happy for Hermione, really, he was, Ron has finally started to notice her in a different light. But Merlin was it almost as bad as when Lavender took an interest in Ron. Well, maybe not as bad. Nothing could compare for the pain that was Ickle Ronniekins. Harry suppressed a shudder. He thought about how odd it was watching your two best mates do something together that you couldn’t join in. He wasn’t jealous, he had Ginny. And Ginny was great.
“Quite” she said. There was a beat of silence where Draco did not know how to begin. But this was Potter’s head of house so he nudged the prat in the hope he might say something helpful.
“You expect us to believe that?” said Blaise readying another curse.
“But we don’t forget” Said Potter
“Oh please Mr Malfoy could you get sap from the yew tree” wined Draco “its very easy to find and since its you it should be fine.” Draco was doing a poor impersonation of Professor Sprout. “Why of course professor, anything you say professor” Draco stopped and curtsied. “Merlin, why did I agree to this? What a great plan lets go to the forbidden forest.” As he got closer to the forest Draco slowed down, fear crept into his features.
“Wot’cha mean?” asked Ron
“Sorry, just it did happen” he mumbled.
“I’m sure you know the position you’re already in” she said. Draco looked at her thoughtfully, how could he not.
“If you see Potter, tell him I’ll flail him alive” Draco said in a dull tone.
“Tell me anyway” asked Harry.
“You have a whole castle to wander, leave me alone” Potter’s eyes flashed with annoyance he kicked Potter in the groin for good measure. He rather enjoyed freezing and beating Potter. As Potter’s eyes rolled, he leant into Potter ear and whispered, “I won’t be so lenient next time”.
“Ah, Potter” Harry heard his name and his eyes locked with Malfoys sneering face. Malfoy was walking with Zabini and Parkinson flanking him. “How’s your nose?” said Malfoy his own pointed nose was turned up and he eyed Harry. Harry still couldn’t believe the pillock had broken his nose on the tain, what a great start to the year.
The answer hit Draco just as Potter finally finished his book. Potter’s eyes Draco sadly, they have now exhausted all of their options in the library
Potter smirked over his shoulder. Up and up they went, winding round the towers until they shot past the tallest one. In the window, Draco spied faces pressed against the glass. Potter twirled through the air, falling again to the ground. Unamused by Potter’s shameful showing off, Draco sped past him.
“Malfoy I’m serious” Potter tried again
“No!” shouted Malfoy, he seemed surprised by his own outburst and his shoulders slumped.
“Yes, that’s what I said” Potter replied. He was wearing his quidditch kit and holding his broom. Malfoy deduced he had probably been playing quidditch. The Idiot. He had no idea why Potter was practising in the forest, but he did not care.
“4” Said Draco
“Why don’t we go ask him together?” Zabini gestured Harry to follow
“Yeah you ran off” Draco responded. Potter looked back to Draco, startled
“I hear most old families have personal library” he looked up to watch Malfoy’s reaction “Especially you Slytherins, a lot of dark books” Harry wasn’t really sure why he knew this, but he did enjoy the watching the blood drain from Malfoys face. Harry didn’t really think Malfoy could get any paler but this was a day for miracles.
As expected on his way to his Common room, he was pulled into Severus’ office.
“Do you know where my Common room is?” asked Harry. He leant back in his seat eyeing Malfoy.
She sighed and then looked to the board. She was silent as she contemplated what they had said. Harry hoped they had been more successful then yesterday.
She turned to give him her full attention “Missing?”
The snoring from Gregg’s bed work Draco, he groaned in annoyance. The persistent noise irritated Draco to know end so he threw an errant book at Gregg’s bed. The snoring was cut off briefly before it started again. Noting Zabini’s empty bed, Draco headed to the washroom to begin his mourning routine.
“Don’t you dare” began Harry. Malfoy’s eyes were wide, but he didn’t look scared.
Draco dressed himself and headed to the common room. Students were sat all across the room, but Blaise was still in his morning spot.
“Did you not pay attention” responded Hermione, without moving her eyes from Flitwick.
He gently patted his chair. Draco moved towards Blaise chair. He picked up Potter’s shoe and tossed it in the boy’s general direction. There was a thunk and Potter grumbled.
“Did we do this yesterday?” he asked Neville
“Malfoy, you git, are we not going to talk about -” Potter tried
“What was that for?” Potter groaned into the grass
“I can’t-“ Malfoy cleared his throat and tried again “I can’t go visit the Manor during term time”.
“Was this your plan?” he said his face inches from Potters. “Have me repeat the same day so I couldn’t fulfil my task”. Potters body stilled.
Harry shrugged “he’s probably up to something, right?” he looked up at the Ron. Ron’s noise was smunched up as he followed Malfoy’s movement. He looked back at Harry and raised his shoulders.
“You didn’t need to hex me” complained Harry. Silence echoed around the room and Harry closed his eyes. He could hear Malfoy shuffle in his bed, but he ignored the movement.
“There are witnesses in the common room who can attest to you being in our room this morning. Just tell us how you got in and we won’t mention you were in there.” She said, her hand gesturing in a placating fashion.
“That’s right you run away coward!” called Malfoy. Harry could hear the shuffle of what was probably, Hermione holding Ron back. As Harry sat down to wait for food to appear, his friends arrived.
“But how did he get in?” she pondered.
A hand stopped him as he crossed into the forest.
“McGonagall” Malfoy sighed.
“The second” she said drawing a bubble with two people in it” is you have been locked into a different time bubble” Her chalk caught on the board “And if you manage to escape then you may reappear where you left off, or far into the future where you should have been. This is a curse”
Harry woke abruptly, by the end of his episode he was sprawled across his floor. Ron watched him blearily through his curtains, his bed hair stood on end. With a little reassurance from Harry, Ron rolled over and promptly started snoring again. After extracting himself from his sweaty sheets, Harry headed to the bathroom. He double checked his face in the mirror but found it perfectly healed, no sign of the fight with Malfoy remained. Harry squeezed his face, it almost seemed like it hadn’t happened in the first place. He eyes his reflection warily.
“yeah … a dream” said Ron
“I don’t know why we are trying” said Malfoy, while they waited. “it’s definitely not going to work now with this” he vaguely gestured to his face”
“yeah quick” agreed Harry as they rushed down the corridor before Draco arrived.
“Malfoy!” Potter shouted. Draco snapped his eyes open. Fool, clumsily he turned his body in the air. He spotted his broom falling below him, he tried to summon it towards him. Slowly it inched towards his fingers brushing the handle. Missing he tried again.
“I didn’t kidnap him; he came very willingly” Blaise leant forward to poke Potter with his wand.
“it’s either Malfoy or Snape with you three” said Neville “and if I don’t know what happening then it’s not Snape” He shuddered.
Potter’s eyes snapped to him. Potter was like an open book, all his emotions played across his face. Dread and resign spread clear in his features.
Not knowing where he might find Potter, Draco headed to the Forest. He remembered something about Potter in the forest. He came to a sudden stop outside of it. Draco wasn’t scared of the forest. Malfoys don’t fear. But he remembered the few accounts he’d had with the forest. In fact, the last time he’d been in here he’d gotten lost and… I kept looping back to the meadows.
“Oh, I’m sure you will” replied Ron.
“Are you deaf as well as dumb?” asked Draco. Potters face snapped to Draco’s and he glared and Draco. Malfoy’s don’t fear. Draco straightened his back and prepared himself for another fight.
Malfoy greeted Blaise as they walked through the Common Room. If the boy was surprised, he didn’t say anything.
“Professor McGonagall” Began Draco “We have been repeating the same day for quite some time now. Potter believed you might be able to help us.”
“Draco?” Blaise asked worriedly
“Back for another beating Potter” Draco said holding his wand to Potter’s face. As Potter rounded the corner he jerked to a halt. His eyes crossed to focus on Draco’s wand.
Between breaths Harry said:
“How did you get in?” Zabini asked a third time, he sauntered closer.
“So is the kitchen” responded Harry, nonplussed.
“Do you think it was the mist?” asked Potter, as he sat on the ground. Close enough to just talk.
“I just asked the door to open” said Potter
Faster he moved towards the pitch weaving through the ground’s natural hills. As he passed the pitch, he felt something catch his robes. His body jerked back in surprise and together they tumbled to the ground.
“Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy” she began “how unexpected.’ Her face was impassive, but her eyes glinted with suspicion.
He purposefully ignored the forest. If Potter had gone there, then maybe he wouldn’t see him until the next loop. His suspicion was confirmed in the late afternoon
“What now?” asked Harry after a moment.
“everything resets” Said Draco
Harry had a piece of bacon halfway to his mouth when he stopped. He remembered the prophecy: ... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives… He felt his whole-body sink, like it had doubled in weight.
“Professor Snape would know. His knowledge of the dark arts is extensive and he’s the and his skill has finally been acknowledged as the DA professor now”
“Professor, I know it doesn’t sound real but please believe us” Potter asked, “We’ve read all the books in the library on this and nothing helped.”
“Now were even” stammered Harry, riddled with guilt. Malfoy was a git, but this felt too far. Malfoy pulled his hand from his face. He looked down at his hand and then back at Harry, his mouth hung open. And then, his eyes sparked.
“I’m coming” dimly over the wind he heared Potter shout. As his hand pulled his broom towards him, he grounded himself in the smooth wood under his hand. Tucking his broom between his legs he shot off towards the ground.
They ended up in the Library any way, both of them sat ignoring each other as they carted through books. They’d both settled on the fact that maybe Madam Pince was a neutral person to ask. Unhappily she had recommended most of the books they had read yesterday but there was a few they hadn’t read. Malfoy’s face was permanently covered with a smile. It irked Harry to no end, he hated what Malfoy had done. But even more, he hated himself for not saying something sooner. After a few hours of reading and hiding behind their books when students came around Malfoy lowered his book.
Malfoy opened his mouth to begin but Potter beat him to it
“Cheater” called Draco.
“It’s happened a few days in a row now” piped up Potter. Draco shot him a look.
“I’ve had two Wednesday’s already” wined Draco.
“Did you figure anything else out?” Malfoy asked noticing Harry’s change in demeanour.
“I win” he said defiantly.
“I must attend his Dark Lord’s task” interrupted Draco. He abruptly stood from the table bowed his head and hurried off. He knew it would seem like he was running away from the conversation. That he was basically denying what Pansy had said. He could imagine the smirk in Notts face. He kicked the wall as he rushed around the corner. It was the same. His whole day felt exactly the same as yesterday, what was happening?
Explain your absence
“Harry?” Harry turned to find the questioning face of his best friend.
“Brilliant” he grumbled.
“Yes” she said “Why is this affecting the two of you? There are many people who would want Mr Potter stuck outside of time.” Harry hung his head
Harry’s throat slid shut and his eyes snapped open. He couldn’t breathe, his hands brushed against his throat, there wasn’t anything there. He thumped his fists on his mattress. Breathe! He screamed. Everywhere he looked red eyes watched him. It’s not real! His mouth opened in a silent scream and his body shook. Over the sounds of his thrashing he could hear Ron move. Harry stilled; he wouldn’t let Ron see the extent his nightmares where having on him. He rolled onto his front and clenched his pillow. A meadow flashed through his mind, he imagined the sun shining through the leaves, the smell of the forest. He spread his fingers as if he could feel the soil. Breathe. He inhaled sharply, the air rattling through his chest. Breathe. Again, he sucked in the air, his eyes prickling from the pain. His body slumped into his mattress. He forced his chest to relax as he continued to breathe deeply.
“You’re probably right” he yawned, “but did we have to do it so early” Harry yawned as well. After he’d showered, he found Ron mumbling about unpleasant things in his sleep. Not wanting to listen to a moment more, he’d shaken Ron awake. After convincing Ron with food, they’d sat playing Wizards chess in the Great Hall. He’d spotted Malfoy gloomily sat at the Slytherin table while the other Slytherin’s spoke animatedly. A sad Draco implied his plan was going wrong, but recently Draco was perpetually moody. Whenever they encountered each other Malfoy’s anger seemed to spark into life. Their back and forth was becoming more violent this year and Harry wondered if they’d begin physically fighting. Harry, sighed. Malfoy was a coward so unlikely, but a boy could hope.
He caught the Forest in his periphery and remembered a few days before. He slowed to a crawl and floated over the pitch. He contemplated the forest; he’d gotten so easily lost in it with no way out. Could he hide in there? He shook himself, hiding was never the answer. He needed to face Voldemort. But how did he face someone so powerful? He thought for a while, but he didn’t know what Voldemort was planning. But there was someone who might.
“Morning Potter” Zabini smiled down at Potter “what do you think you’re up to?”
“We were just taking a morning walk ‘Mione” said Ron
“He did?” asked Ron.
He knew Blaise wouldn’t miss up the chance to follow Draco. Draco took great pleasure in his appearance; it was a well-known fact. Blaise would never miss the opportunity for entertainment. Draco imagined Blaise thought it was the end of the world, or at least Draco’s. And maybe it was, Draco certainly felt his emotions matched that idea.
Harry wilted in displeasure
He contemplated calling out but he doubted the door would open if they knew it was him. Harry cuffed his feet as he waited. He raised his hand to knock again but halted. His eyes shifted from side to side checking to make sure no-one was watching. He sighed heavily and brought out his wand. He conjured a snake, and gently held her in his palm. The snake wriggled through his fingers.
It’s was a repeat of their last conversation and as much as Draco enjoyed the idea of physically beating Potter into submission, he was currently preoccupied with how to pull this off.
“Harry what is going on?” asked Ron looking down into Harry’s face. “Why are you with that prat?”
“How many days?” she asked
“Not according to your actions” she mumbled. To Draco’s surprise she didn’t push any further.
“Potter are you coming?” asked Malfoy, well not so much of a question more of a loud demand, enough to gather everyone’s attention. Harry made to follow him; Ron grabbed his arm to stop him.
“Wrong answer” responded Blaise. He tried to hex Potter again, but Potter reflected it easily.
“Yeah man”
Draco considered what he’d done. None of it mattered now though. Or at least not until they left this timeline. He’d wake up tomorrow and the whole thing would begin again. He didn’t feel the constant dread of messing up clinging to his shoulders. He used to worry constantly about his position. But now he felt a little less stiff, like he could breath properly. Even when they repeated the days, in the back of his mind he worried about the consequences of his actions. But with every loop he felt his body relax further. He’d become so caught up with escaping he’d almost forgotten the screams from his home. The darkness that haunted his dreams. Draco paused in his notes. Why was he trying to escape? Out there was his family, the pressure, him. In here, though, he could do what he wanted. But that didn’t change that the day was always the same.
“What about yours?” asked Harry
“Taking a stroll” he spoke calmly, but Draco could feel his heartbeat. They both new he was lying.
“Explain your absence” Draco remained silent. Draco leant against a desk and shrugged. Now the script would deviate.
Flitwick noticed their conversation. “You three, listen up!” he chirped. The conversation was put on hold for the rest of the lesson. Anytime Harry tried to speak, Hermione shushed him.
“We didn’t have charms yesterday” mumbled Neville
“You prat” responded Harry darkly
Yesterday he definitely had charms, because ‘Mione wouldn’t let him talk as Flitwick had gotten upset. And he had wanted to talk because he’d thought he’d missed the lesson. So, the day before yesterday he’d gotten lost in the forest. But no-one remembered him being missing so maybe it didn’t happen. Malfoy was with him in the forest, but Harry never contemplated asking Malfoy for the simple reason of Malfoy being a dick. But if the forest had been a dream then Harry had to admit he’d had a dream about Malfoy. Harry supressed a shudder.
"You can move your wand away now, Potter," Draco smirked, not at all threatened by Harry or his wand.
Draco slapped his arse. "Come on; I need to show you something; you can sleep when we get back."
"Mr Malfoy, is he in there?"
Draco looked up at her with his pale and gaunt face and nodded.
"Oh," Malfoy closed his eyes and turned around. "Better?"
"No, you weren't, you were protecting yourself," Draco bit back moving towards Harry.
"A carnival?" Harry asked.
"I saw him on Thursday, he followed me into a little cafe up north," Harry said, remembering the lunch date he had with Draco and being kissed under the table.
"It's good to see you too, Mrs Weasley," Harry said pulling carefully away.
"Ah, hello Mr Malfoy," Mrs Weasley said stepping aside to let him in.
“Play with yourself.” green eyes widened. Draco smiled to reassure his lover, sensing his uncertainty and sudden shyness. “It’s all right. Go on; let me see you pleasure yourself.”
He groaned,
Harry Potter exclusive: Last night Auror, Harry Potter, 19 and Ex-Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, 20, celebrated Draco's 20th birthday. It was said to be an all-out party with Harry's two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger-Weasley, Draco's lifelong best friend Blaise Zabini, his mother, Narcissa Malfoy, The Weasley family and few Hogwarts friends. A source that was at the party has confirmed the announcement of Draco and Harry are officially moving in together; there is no news as of yet if Harry is moving to the Malfoy Manor or If Draco is moving to the late Black home, I will keep you updated on all things Harry Potter.
In the kitchen, Harry was sat nonchalantly reading the newspaper and eating his toast, this annoyed Draco. He always hated that Harry didn't worry about things, he would be all "Voldemort is taking over the wizarding world let's go watch Quidditch, then I will effortlessly destroy him when the worst time comes." He shook what he had thought out of his head and sent a silent apology to the completely unaware Harry. After all, he was clueless about what was going on; he just thought they were going for a fancy meal.
The birthday meal turned into a double celebration, which Harry didn't mind as it took the attention off him for a bit. Ron had managed to calm down, thanks to Hermione. He had apologised to Mrs Weasley and Ginny for being a jealous prat, which Harry figured Hermione must have told him to say.
Draco was not amused and kicked him hard under the table. "They were a different kind of friendship, not like Blaise he is more like a brother."
Harry unlocked his front door and stepped inside holding it open for him. "It's okay; you didn't know."
Morty hissed unwrapping himself sulkily.
He and Ron both raised an eyebrow at her. "What did they do?"
"There is a cafe I go to for my lunch, and he is there all time, sometimes he is with his girlfriend."
*****
"Are you trying to tell an Auror what to do, Malfoy?" He asked flirtatiously, raising his eyebrow. He felt his cheeks heat as he was never a good flirt and felt embarrassed doing so.
"Please tell me you're not still reading that book," Harry said, rolling his eyes as they walked up the cobbles in stride together." And it's afternoon, not morning. "
"So is his girlfriend, Ginny." Harry said, frowning "Making me go, that is."
*******
The photos from Harry's birthday were a lot different from Draco's the decor was more tasteful and sophisticated whereas Draco's birthday had looked like it was put together last minute. Harry didn't have to have his memories to realise Draco was a perfectionist. But the fact that he hadn't corrected Harry's decorating in the study meant that he wasn't patronising.
"What is this?" Harry asked, taking the quill from Lucius Malfoy's long, pale fingers and looking back to the scroll of parchment he had placed on the dining table in front of his breakfast.
Harry went red then began speaking in a harsh whisper. "That's because Robards is in love with me."
"Fine," He raised his arms in surrender and sat down in the chair himself. "Just tell me what I lied to you about so I can go back to bed; it's two o'clock in the morning."
Everyone looked up at him and glared.
"I am sure some of the Ministry are curious to find out how a 21-year-old has managed to buy a whole Quidditch team."
"Ok, it wasn't quite like that, we both knew that given my history I was doomed to be in a low position in the Ministry and I had been doing some P.I. work on the side so as a birthday gift to me you fired me and got me my business cards." Draco's smirk disappeared as though he was reliving it. "It's all there in the albums, it made the daily prophet because you were such a drama queen about it and made a whole scene about firing me, it was a whole storyline for a month."
In the evening, Draco sat in the library with Theo, who was starting his homework already, Draco just wanted to get away from everyone. He had a group of the fifth year Gryffindor's swearing at him and other students hissing at him. It's not like he can't handle himself, but he had to be careful and not end up getting kicked out of school.
"Mr Weasley has decided to put me on a shorter leash and wants me in the office more and wants me to tell him exactly where I am at all times of the working day, which is incredibly annoying and inconvenient," Draco said and let go of his hand when he was the waitress bringing a tray full of food. "Thank you."
Harry didn't know what to say; he was feeling guilty, worried and sorry for Draco and Astoria.
Harry inhaled and exhaled slowly, he knew very well Draco and his father might as well have tied all the evidence in a pretty pink bow and handed it to Kingsley Shacklebolt himself. He knew he should be furious and shout at Draco, but he was tired of it, he just had to accept the fact Robards deserved to go to Azkaban for the shady things he has been doing. He was headed there with or without the polyjuice potion.
Blaise turned his head around too and waved at Draco. "I didn't think you were coming," He said raising an eyebrow.
Draco groaned again, so incredibly hard that he could burst. He itched to end the game and just take the brunette, but he forced himself to hold back, wanting to see how much further Harry was willing to go.
"What are you on about?" Draco asked defensively.
"Of course," Harry said standing straight. "I'm sure Draco won't mind us using his office."
"Neville Longbottom?" She said excitedly.
This chapter includes male slash, do not read if you are offended or uncomfortable with it for whatever reason.
"I think it's this one," Smith called, stopping in front of a door guarded by two suits of armour, their spears were crossed in the middle. Zacharias walked closer, and the spears separated, allowing him access. "Well, that was anti-climatic." He said then pushed the door open, disappearing inside.
They lined next to each other, their backs to the sun, they smirked at each other and put on their game faces. Gripping their handles tight they leaned forward, ready for taking off.
"This is because of me, why?" Draco was suddenly taken aback.
"Why were they pissed off at Blaise and Ginny?"
“Say please, first.” Draco grinned at the string of curses Harry hurled at him. Deliberately, he stroked Harry’s sweet spot once, prompting a loud cry of pleasure, and removed his fingers completely.
"Tell me what's happened," he said softly pouring two glasses of firewhiskey on the little bar by the fireplace.
"Just tell me," She sighed again rolling her eyes.
"May I speak to your employer?" Draco resigns.
His mother had kindly let him use her ballroom for the evening and was delighted about the surprise that no-one would have seen coming. His father was still in Azkaban and had no idea what he was about to do tonight and doubt he would approve.
"Time out," Cotton shouted. "Everyone stop." All the Players stopped, and the bludgers paused in flight. "Potter, you are team captain, just because you are on opposite teams at the moment you are ultimately still on the same team, understood?"
At 6 pm Harry went to Hermione and Ron's house. He left Morty at home this time he still didn't know why Morty was in such a bad mood and how he was feeding himself.
"Good," Draco replied and sat chewing his lip. "If they are keeping an eye on you, they will most likely be intercepting your mail."
"14th February 2001," Draco replied sipping his coffee not taking his eyes off Harry.
Draco scoffed. "It would be pretty hard not to recognise a snake that had been beheaded, and I would have a bit more respect for your boss if I were you, If you were my secretary I would fire you for speaking such..." The office door opened.
It was a short letter, and at that moment he knew he had been caught, he was sure to be fired and or sent to Azkaban. Would Potter know? Would he hate him after they had only just started to become friendlier? He worried over in his head.
"Just drink this," Granger said softly handing him a potion bottle. She turned to Malfoy, "Thanks for getting me."
"How about a picture with my date?" Draco asked the photographers confidently.
"I was called into Kingsley's office before I left, they have arrested Gawain Robards."
"Mother where the fuck is the cake?" He demanded.
Mrs Weasley let go but kept repeating how proud she was, and went through the list of all the Weasleys who had made Head Girl and Boy. "And then, of course, there’s Percy, and--" She looked at Ron, must have realised the mistake she was about to make, and stammered. "Ginny, so happy, we need to celebrate."
Draco turned his head and saw Harry and Ron behind him; he slid his bum off the desk. "Well?"
"Please do me one favour, and keep my parents off the topic of it, I beg you, I will owe you big time."
"I heard what you said," Harry replied annoyed. "And I do too know how to have fun; why is this even a conversation?"
"I guess it's the same reason you do that," Draco said, nodding his head towards Harry.
He continued on towards the shelves that looked like they were filled with potion bottles. "Fuck, Potter!" Draco jumped frightened when he saw Harry behind him when he glanced in the tall mirror in front of him. He turned around, and Harry wasn't there, he turned back to the mirror, and Harry was there again. "Fucking, protection charms," He muttered and walked on. "Accio Murtlap."
The three of them looked at each other confused, had it something to do with the rumour on the train he wondered. He told Hermione and Ron he would see them soon as they followed the others out of the Great Hall.
"So you haven't ever given money to them to stop information being leaked?"
"What does what mean?" Harry asked confused.
"Work?" Draco replied exasperated.
"Do you want to go with me to this carnival?" Malfoy asked again quickly. "Tomorrow?"
The Head Auror office was still when Harry had unlocked it; there was a sense of abandonment in the air, it felt familiar to him. There was a large desk in front of a tiled glass window that overlooked the Auror offices; he assumed it was a one-way window.  The desk had a little gold plaque with Harry Potter Head Auror engraved. There was a messy pile of papers on the desk which Draco would probably disapprove of.
"You should've asked me," Harry said.
Harry sighed, "That's a true story."
"I really don't want a party. I told you yesterday," Harry moaned.
He leaned in and grinned. "This is good," he said, and he bent to Harry's throat. His tongue licked his lips, and he pressed them, moist, against Harry’s skin. He breathed him in, tasted the tang of sweat and smelled the heady spice that was all Harry. He pressed his lips firmly against the pulse that beat rapidly under the soft skin of Harry’s neck.
Blaise scratched his head uncomfortably. "Because I said there would be a scandal coming out that would ruin mine and other people's lives, which wasn't a lie."
When the class all groaned, Slughorn clapped his hands together again.
"It's getting late; shall we go?"
"I am going to a party now, so please stay in bed and don't make a mess, or you will be stuck with lettuce for the rest of the year, understand?"
"Can we talk about this another time?" Harry asked not in the mood to discuss what happened without revealing the whole of his birthday party antics.
Thank you to everyone that has read reviewed and left kudos I really appreciate it.
Harry sat up with an eyebrow raised. "What do you mean?"
"You did not," Hermione gasped.
******
They stood in front of the glass cabinet, and he could see Harry raise his eyebrows in surprise. "These are dangerous?"
He clenched his teeth and put on a fake smile. "And when do you expect I will be able to open?"
Draco nodded understandingly, "I know, and I am sorry." Draco looked away; he seemed ashamed.
Harry hadn't realised that Jason was lying on a first aid bench with a bloody leg being aided by a nurse. He winced slightly as he stared at him.
Harry frowned. "No, I was just curious; you don't have to tell me if you don't want to."
"Well it looks great, thanks, Hermione," Harry gleamed.
"What's going on?" Harry asked again.
"I told you, Mr Malfoy would show his true colours, just like his father," Robards said, interrupting the stream of thoughts in Harry's head.
"Harry," Hermione whispered, nudging him in the ribs. "You need to get up."
Draco turned the stove down and sat down in the chair opposite. "Odd how?"
Draco stood up quickly avoiding his mother's gaze and walked over to the fireplace staring into the flames. "What do you know?"
"Malfoy, In," Potter said sternly pointing inside his office.
"Because I loved you," Harry replied.
"Huh?" He replied, completely missing what she was talking about.
"When then, when will you have the conversation that you are embarrassed that your only son is gay and married to the man who defeated your hero The Dark Lord?"  Draco was shouting now, and Lucius was on his feet, both wands were out and pointed at each other.
Harry rolled his eyes as he listened to Draco tell everyone his expectations. He should leave now; he was never going to be allowed on the team, not with Malfoy in charge.
His brain kept reliving the moments of being kicked out as he walked through to Mr Weasley's office holding a covered fake dark artefact. He had used one of his father's potions on a door knocker to make you forget the past three hours; it was the best he could do at such short notice.
"Yes, unfortunately," Draco replied bitterly cutting up his jacket and pouring the cheese from his chips on top. "It's like we are being punished for having feelings."
"I will try at least," Harry replied.
"No breakfast today?" He said, feeling his stomach grumble.
"I did something bad," Harry replied slumping into the chair in front of the desk.
"Yeah, but I didn't see anything about us in the prophet this morning, and they didn't seem to want to talk to me."
"It's not funny; they are literally the worlds most boring people ever."
"Nope," Malfoy replied, shaking his head. "But I don't often pay attention to door handles."
"You know, how could you possibly know?"
"I am not a loner," Harry mumbled pathetically.
"I think that's everyone," Slughorn said, closing the door and clapping his two chubby hands together. "We have touched on the subject of Polyjuice Potion before, and I have come up with an exciting project for you to do, to start the year off on a fun note."
Harry got off the stage and walked over to his red-haired best friend Ron Weasley and got down on one knee. "Will you Ronald Billius Weasley be my best man?"
Draco shot up angrily. "Are you saying my money is not from hardworking?"
"I don't know, Potter, but what I do know is you need to get out of bed and help me find the artefact," Malfoy replied, his eyes looked like they were hiding something.
"I know, he tells me all the time too," Harry agreed stifling a yawn threading his fingers between Draco's
"This is all too much," Harry said to a livid Draco.
"You're defending him?" Harry interrupted, sounding outraged.
A loud HA escaped him, and he clapped a hand to his mouth, not wanting to wake Teddy, Ron or Hermione.
~~~~~...~~~
Harry looked at him reluctantly; he wasn't prepared to go diving into someone else's memory. He let out a sigh then bent over the pensieve emerging his face inside.
He let out a sigh of relief as he soon spotted Draco Malfoy's name in the courtyard with Pansy Parkinson, his on again, off again girlfriend, who had probably made her way through most of the Slytherin guys in their year and most likely a few of the Ravenclaw guys too.
Draco managed to wiggle himself free from her sharp fingernailed clutch. "I am fine, mother, I have just been with Blaise and at work."
He chuckled at his own reply; he wanted to try and assure Malfoy he wasn't just going to take back his freedom because of a conversation about chocolate frog cards. He gave the note to the Eagle Owl and sent him out the window. He climbed onto his bed and sighed as he looked up at the ceiling, arms behind his head. He tried to remember the day, before attempting to clear his mind, but just as he was drifting into a deep sleep, he was awoken by a weight landing on his chest.
The snake nodded vigorously, and Harry placed the mice on the table, letting go slowly just in case he made a grab for it, he did not.
"You can't just sell truth potion," Hermione gasped. "It could do a lot of damage in the wrong hands."
"So easy to please," Blaise laughed after taking a large drink from his bottle. "Go on then tell us what McGonagall wanted you for, did she find out that you got in a fist fight with Potter on the train."
"Trust me the only dangerous thing about this mirror is your reflection," Harry laughed.
She smiled and nodded in agreement, "Let's just hope your father takes your wedding announcement well or Harry will be leaving here in a coffin."
"Then what changed? What happened between you and Malfoy?"
Draco chewed his lip. "No, but they will have to deal with it either way."
"I don't know, Potter, I don't have a clock behind my eyelids," Draco mumbled again and then sighed."All I know is we have work in a few hours, and I would like a chance to sleep off this alcohol before then."
The three of them looked where the teachers sat and, Hermione was right, Bill Weasley was sat next to Professor Slughorn. Bill, the oldest Weasley wasn't wearing his usual work robes, he was dressed in smart black robes with his long red hair tied neatly back, which showed the scar that he had received off Fenrir Greyback two years ago.
"Why are you talking in riddles Draco, just spit it out," Lucius said irritatedly.
"If by it, you mean Morty, he is probably asleep on my bed, and what do you mean you have come to collect me?" Harry said frowning.
Draco Malfoy slammed a copy of The Daily Prophet on the desk in front of his father, who was busy chopping up ingredients.
"Why is there a broken bowl of guacamole on the floor?" Ron asked with a handful of Doritos in his hand.
Harry lifted up slightly and pulled off Draco's trousers and then got rid of his own. Both their cocks were hard for each other as he lowered back into the straddle.
He sat up, taking the envelope from his father's hand. The handwriting was Mr Weasley's it was neat and curled. He opened it roughly and took out the letter unfolding it to read.
"I believe what I said was that petty fighting behind me, and I don't believe this is a fight," Draco smirked. "Now can we go, I don't want to spend all day at work."
Harry blushed as he realised he had been fixed on him the whole time and had a semi hard-on. He turned away to face the pile of clothes. "Erm," he coughed running his fingers through his messy hair trying to sound nonchalant. "Yeah I am fine, did you say something?"
"15 he doesn't, and he tries to stupefy my father," Draco replied holding out his hand.
~~~~~~~
"You kissed me back," She sobbed. "I thought you actually liked me, and then I saw how miserable you looked before you got to the photographers, then I realised it was all your mother."
"I am not going to judge you, Harry," Draco said much softer than Harry had expected. "I just want to understand."
"It was all down to Draco, he recruited Hermione and me to decorate though," Ron smiled proudly then folding over when Hermione hit him in the stomach.
A few moments later they had parted, and Harry was unlocking his door. "Thank you for inviting me tonight," Harry said, pushing the door open.
"I suggested that, but Harry said no," Draco replied squeezing Harry's hand.
"I'd rather not," Draco shook his head vigorously.
"Come sit," Narcissa guided him by the arm to the table.
The guests cheered him on as he got nearer to the Arbour where Draco was smirking, and the priest was stood, holding the bible open. Harry was smiling at him with loving eyes, and they both knew it was perfect.
Harry smirked at how difficult it was for Lucius to be asking for a truce, which must mean Draco put him up to it or Narcissa, he was going to make him sweat for it. "So, you're saying you want is to get on like a big happy family and forget what you did to me in the past?"
Harry exhaled. "You don't understand; I don't care if it gets leaked, this is about Draco."
Harry and Ron listened in awe as they followed behind Hermione as she told them her detailed plan. They made sure Mrs Weasley wasn't about as they went back through to the Leaky Cauldron. It wasn't as busy as they thought it was going to be, but everyone else seemed to be rushing in and out of every shop. Hermione, who was the oldest, took the lead and approached Tom the Barman.
Tonight's starter was wild mushroom soup with warm bread rolls which Draco enjoyed very much. The tension around the table stuck out like a sore thumb, and he knew he should probably speak before his Mother had another mental breakdown.
"Letter, Young Master Malfoy," a female house-elf squeaked nervously, behind him.
"Did you not know? You are our team captain." Louis smiled widely.
He was fine.
An Auror opened the gate from the spectator's benches, and Harry walked through to stand in front of Kingsley with his back to the Malfoys. Harry caught a glimpse of  Draco squeezing his mother's hand in the restraints.
"Robards," Draco repeated, louder.
Draco slowed down and licked the cock out of his mouth teasing the tip again, tasting the pre-cum. "Do you want me inside you, Potter?" He breathed.
"Excellent," Mr Weasley beamed.
The morning of the 25th April 2015 was a cold one when Harry Potter had turned over in his bed; he felt a chill as he opened his eyes lazily and saw a blurred pair of grey eyes looking annoyed at him. It startled him awake, he sat up and saw the eyes had their arms folded tightly with a piece of parchment gripped in their hand.
Teddy frowned slightly. "Uncle Harry would probably just want more pile of paperwork."
Harry choked on his drink, his face went beetroot red, then quickly composed himself with a small tight smile. "Maybe, you could be onto something, Gin." He said.
"No," He heard Ginny say from the doorway behind him. "We were trying to be nice friends, ok, we went around it the wrong way, but you two just needed a boost, and you wouldn't seek each other out, so we did it for you."
He took out two mice and put one on the bed for Morty who sprang for it and ate it in one satisfying go; he took out the second one looking warningly at him, he held it over the bedside table next to his clock. "Later, okay?"
He brushed her off him irritatedly and stood up. "I will go make some fire calls." He said solemnly and left the dining room.
"Do you want to swap?" He whispered to Ron.
Harry felt the blood rise to his cheeks. Malfoy glanced at them stony-faced and padded upstairs. "Shut up, Roody."
Harry turned to look at the old witch who was beaming at him like so many witches did when they were in his company, even though she has known him since his first trip into Diagon Alley. "Erm, yeah, I guess it won't hurt to try it on," He said unsurely.
He held his cheek as she stormed off; he looked around, and it didn't seem as anyone had seen. He let out a small moan and rubbed his cheek as the impact of the slap stung.
"You spoil him," Harry frowned. "He was on a strict one mice diet before you came along."
"I think we should put this away now," Hermione said with a frown on her face.
"I hope you realise that cafe has been a staple in Diagon Alley for many years and has never closed."
"Yeah, I'm fine," Harry called back. "Just getting dressed."
"Draco," Harry nodded and smiled back.
Harry stared at the parchment Draco was holding up; he found it hard to get his vision to focus, how much had drunk tonight? Draco's blonde hair was more untamed than usual he noted as he stood in the dimly lit kitchen. The smirk on his face was more prominent than before. "Reply in person?" Harry said repeating what Draco had said.
Draco smiled.
Thursday, 21st July 2005
Draco Malfoy had resigned?  Harry could feel Robards watching him for a reaction, but he wouldn't give him one. He had already ruined the little happiness Harry had left.
"Yeah, that always gets me far, doesn't it?" He said sarcastically. "Besides, he could still send off the photograph if we reported him."
Guess who got dumped? Pretty sure I did.
Lucius looked up from his plate. "You need to understand; I was trying to protect you."
"Have you seen a tall blonde haired man in here recently? Or Man with brown hair and glasses with an unusual scar on his forehead?" He heard Edwin say.
Harry blew out each candle as everyone cheered and sang happy birthday. When the candles had gone out everyone gasped as the numbers on top started sparkling and shooting out red and gold fireworks, there was oohs and aahs then confusion as the red and gold turned into a green snake and slithered in the air leaving the words "Will you marry me, Potter?"
"J.K.R?" Harry muttered trying to work out if there was a connection. JK..R, JKR, Joker?"
"But sir, 24/7 all year round," She reminded him exasperated.
"Okay, well I don't want to be a P.I anymore," Draco said quickly.
He didn't want to show Harry how terrified he was feeling at the idea of them all sitting at the dining table trying to act like they were all getting on, or worse not act like they are getting on and curses get shot around the room. He knew his mother wouldn't allow that, but she was the one who was taking the news the worst.
Lucius snorted. "I thought you said not everything can be solved with money."
"I will be expecting a cut, for this one," Harry laughed half-heartedly.
Harry felt a hand slip into his as Draco had come up next to him. "I have a fun idea why don't you two go into the study and draw Uncle Harry pictures of all the things you like and then we will put them on the fridge," Draco suggested, and there was two squeals of excitement and off they went.
"Then what happened?" Ginny said urging him to continue as she paced back and forth in front of him.
“Sorry,”  Harry said, moving to intercept.  “Draco you need to give him one pound, it’s the small gold one.”
"Well?"
"I, uh, just wanted to apologise for what happened on the train, I overreacted," Draco said, looking down at the ground.
Bill flicked his wand, and the chalkboard and then desk moved out the way to make room for what was to be an exciting duel. They stood opposite ends of the classroom, facing each other after they had taken a bow. Malfoy stepped forward first waving his wand as red sparks from Stupefy were cast towards Bill, who had easily blocked it and sent a silent, Full Body-Bind back which took no effort on Malfoy's end to prevent.
He could just about sum up where in the castle he had been lead to as he often paced and counted his steps when he couldn't sleep, but why she brought him to the prefects' bathroom, he didn't know.
“Who will be our Head of House now?”
The all laughed apart from Lucius who was too busy watching his granddaughter sleep.
George perused his fingers, "We didn't want all that, fame it's exhausting."
Harry grimaced, "Don't remind me, I feel bad enough as it is."
There was no sign of Ginny or Blaise, which only seemed to make Harry speed up his walking; the combination of firewhisky and anger was not going to end well.
"So everything is okay now?" Hermione smiled.
The time had come for the big cake reveal, and Draco's palms were sweating as he flexed them open and close. Hermione had gathered everyone around the stage when Draco had given the signal.
Harry watched him slither around near Fred and George's feet in his sitting room, they had been bugging him and asked him pointless questions about when he participated in the Triwizard tournament. It wasn't the best year of his life, especially when he had seen Cedric Diggory die and Voldemort return.
Draco sighed exhaustedly. "Will you just talk to me?"
*******
"Your sister told me I had to get a new outfit for the engagement party tomorrow," Harry said bitterly.
He could see Draco was processing what he had said and trying to find a flaw in it but eventually just smiled.
Draco passed Morty a piece of bacon and smiled satisfied with himself.
"I like to think so," He replied with a cheesy grin, and stepped closer to the door and was allowed access inside.
Harry grabbed up his invisibility cloak and wand and left through the portrait hole, hardly making out a goodbye to Ron and Hermione.
There was something odd about the front door; Harry thought as he was standing outside The Manor that he and Draco were investigating, there was undoubtedly a snake on the door handle last time he had come. He stared at the bare looking handle. Was there a snake? He thought or was he just imagining it, No, he couldn't've, he remembered thinking about Morty when he saw it.
"Yes, you got me thinking yesterday when you said that the Muggle girls wouldn't have touched anything deep inside the house, so I thought what if they didn't get inside the house, and then I tested the door, and it revealed itself to me," Malfoy said mostly telling the truth.
"Shut up, and go help my mother stop worrying about whatever she is worried about." He kissed Harry on the lips just as Lucius entered the room.
"About?" Harry asked impatiently.
A friend.
After the Trolley witch left Draco slid opened the compartment door again, ignoring his friends telling him to sit back down. He walked up the carriage looking for Potter.
"Nice way to let your presence known, Potter," Zabini said with a tight smile.
Fully composed now, Draco took out his wand and drew open the curtains revealing the largest cake he had ever seen it was five-tiered decorated in the Gryffindor colours which Draco selflessly chose. There were 20 large candles spiralling down from the big 20 on the top. Draco lit each candle with his wand until it was fully lit.
"I want you to do whatever makes you happy,"
"Yes, I was in Slytherin, my sister Daphne was in Draco's year," The witch Astoria said, sitting up straight as Draco dropped into the seat beside her.
When lunchtime came, he fed Morty again to stop him having a hissy fit and left the office to go to Madam Malkin's to get his new dress robes. He did have to agree with Hermione and Ginny about that; he hadn't bought a new suit since last summer when he had his 24th birthday. Hermione and Ron threw him a surprise birthday party, which wasn't a real surprise because it was leaked in the daily prophet, Hermione still never found out who leaked it and still holds a grudge.
"JOHNSON SCORES ANOTHER 10 POINTS; THE SCORE IS NOW 90/20 TO APPLEBY ARROWS," The announcer's voice said filling the stadium.
"I quit my job so I could get a career in Quidditch," Harry said quietly.
Draco shrugged then smiled widely. "I am Slytherin Quidditch Captain."
"Sorry, what?" Harry said pathetically.
Professor Weasley entered the classroom in his dark robes, wand in hand and pointing to the board. 'Nonverbal Magic' appeared, which made Harry groan internally; he still hadn't quite grasped it, he managed to do Levicorpous and weak shield charm, but he wasn't as advanced as Hermione was, she had been trying to teach him and Ron, but he could never get the focus right.
Lucius stopped what he was doing and looked at Draco; he looked at him with an amused smirk on his face that irritated Draco. "How dare you, I am doing what I have to do to protect my family from potential scandals, especially when they involve Mr Potter," He said spitting out the last part.
I fucking hated you, but you won't leave my head.
"You don't need to tell me any of this," Harry said feeling the heat at the back of his neck.
The hallway stood dimly lit, which meant they had not long gone to bed; he was confident his father would have had been passed out drunk from his specially brewed firewhisky. He had offered it to Draco many times, but he always refused as he knew how ridiculously strong it was, not that he didn't mind strong whiskey, but he would rather not spend the next few days with a burning throat.
"Yes, of course, I will marry you," Harry nodded and helped Draco to stand up. Friends and family were cheering so loudly you would have thought they were at a Quidditch game. "I fucking love you."
"Draco," One of the twins called him across the table. "Can we ask you some questions after dinner?"
"Are you sure you want
Harry's lips curled up at the mention of it being his home. It was true, of course, and the thought of returning to Hogwarts,  free of any threat of Voldemort, was more appealing than he would have thought possible. Maybe he would finally get to have his first quiet year.
Things were starting to feel back to normal for Harry; he was back in the flow of a regular day in the office. After lunch he had received a memo to see Gawain Robards in his office, it was the first time he had seen him since he had accidentally oblivitated him.
Draco's lips were back on Harry's trying to shut him up as he was being extremely loud now. Harry pulled his head back. "They are going to say bad stuff about us," he moaned.
"I know," Draco smirked and kissed him on the lips. "Right, well, I better go, or I will be here all day again."
"Is there a problem, Potter?" Malfoy asked sounding scarily like Snape.
They sat at the kitchen table eating Harry's famous bacon sandwiches. Morty rested his head on the surface eagerly waiting for bacon; Harry had finally realised Draco was the one that was supplying Morty his food.
The image of Draco kissing him popped into his head again as he showered and washed his hair, he felt the way Draco had gripped his hair and held his body close to his. He felt himself get hard and tried to make the image disappear, which was more difficult.
Lucius turned his back on Draco and swore.
"How about a live potter update?" Harry closed the paper and stared seriously at Draco. "Harry Potter looking for a new boyfriend see page 4 for an application form."
"Morning," Draco greeted him as he sat down in the chair opposite him.
"Draco, is that you?" Came a faint voice from behind him. He turned around to see the blonde hair of his mother.
"For three weeks, I assumed the daily prophet would be all over my birthday meltdown." He shrugged again. "But when I got back there was no mention of me or my birthday."
"Did you get told off for skipping out on work?" Draco offered to try to get him to talk.
"Last door on the right," Zabini said. "You might want to give it a minute, Goyle is in there, and he ate a lot at the feast."
"Yes, well they can wonder all they like, it was a legal and above board transaction."
"No-one ended up in St Mungo's" Draco shrugged. "There is still tomorrow though."
"Don't speak to anyone," Kingsley ordered him, and Harry nodded again.
"Well, there is nothing more that can be done to get his memories back that is down to his head, but if we can make new memories for him, he might feel more himself."
Draco coughed, "And me being the father."
"Fantastic," Harry shouted back, grinning ear to ear. "How much further?"
Malfoy growled and waved his hand over the cauldron emptying it. "You better not screw this up for me Potter if I end up in St Mungo's cause you can't read properly."
Draco looked around to see if there was anyone he recognised, but it was so hard with everyone wearing masks, it would seem impossible to find Harry amongst them, and he didn't even know if he had arrived yet or worse if he will arrive. No-- he told himself-- he will come.
Draco walked with a quick stride to the two men and kicked one of their arms away, his face was an angry grimace as he faced the cell door and opened the hatch.
"We had an inkling you would be trying to skip out on the party," Hermione said still looking at the ground.
Though they now shared a table, they had remained segregated to their houses. The Slytherins sat at the top of the table closest to the door whereas Gryffindor sat the opposite end closest to the stage, between them, was Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.
"Surprise," Everyone cheered as they entered fully.
Oliver Wood frowned, "Well played, it will be weird playing against you both."
Harry was glad he didn't have work today, he hadn't had a hangover like this in ages, and he wasn't prepared to have to sit at a desk all day and look at boring Casefiles.
"Get up, I need to show you something," Draco said, stroking the smooth of his arm lightly.
"I will have my usual," Draco said loudly to get her attention from Harry.
Lucius stopped crushing the roots and turned his head to face Draco then motioned to the armchair.
It was now day time; he was in Madam Malkins. Harry was being tailored in the grey suit Draco had tried to get Harry to wear before he got kicked out of his house. It seemed so long ago now even though it was just a few weeks ago. Harry looked so good in the suit, he watched him as he checked himself out in the mirror and he was smiling happily. He turned around facing Draco, and he could see those twinkling green flecks in his eyes the ones he had just seen in that strange mirror, and the ones he would see whenever Harry wasn't stuck in his own head.
"What do you want?" Harry asked, not bothering with the niceties.
Draco stood up and gave Harry a tight hug, "I love you so much," He whispered.
This caught Draco off guard; he blinked quickly not quite believing what he heard, Potter was complimenting him, and wanting him to teach him as well. Surely there was a catch, would he threaten to send him to Azkaban if he didn't? And what about Granger, the cleverest witch in the school, top of the class in everything. "What about Granger?" He asked, speaking his thoughts. "Can't she help you?"
After successfully making up with Teddy he made his way around to Dean and Seamus, who he used to spend nearly every weekend with up until the incident at his last birthday.
"It's a nice night why don't the four of you go for a walk in the gardens?" His mother suggested.
"And what exactly are we eating?"
When Harry had got to the table everyone on it had already sat down, Ernie was smiling at him, and pointing to the only empty seat between him and Malfoy. "Fuck," He whispered under his breath. A tray of firewhisky floated past him, which he gratefully took another two glasses drinking them before he sat down.
"It's honestly not a problem, he is my family too, so I should naturally do my part." Draco flushed slightly embarrassed and slightly ashamed for not doing his part sooner.
"You're right I could have," Lucius smirked. He stepped inside carrying a neatly wrapped brown package.
"I am sorry," Draco said quietly. "I shouldn't have told her who I was."
"What was that about?" Ron asked after shutting the door and locking it.
"How so?"
"He is fast asleep, he won't wake up for anything now," she said still in a whisper. "We both know very well why you are not happy."
Lucius sat up quickly, "Child?"
"If I get the promotion it means I will be stuck inside all the time."
"Only a few people know what actually happened the night of the battle, when I walked, alone, into the forbidden forest and came out in Hagrid's arms, presumed  dead." Harry paused and looked gratefully at Mrs Malfoy. "I should have died; I was hit, for the second time in my life, with the killing curse at the hands of Voldemort, and I still live to tell the tale. And the fact of the matter is, I might not have made it out alive if it wasn't for Narcissa Malfoy."
"I know," Harry said still not surprised.
"Is this a joke?" She whispered heatedly.
"There's a war coming and I don't think one of us will make it out alive when it comes to it."
Albus let out a surrendering sigh and was brought to a halt.
"I guess there are no feelings there, I mean I love her but more as a friend, I don't know why I am telling you this, I have never said it to anyone."
Draco smiled, pleased that his rumour skills had pulled through, he didn't think it would get to the prophet that quickly. "Oh really, and who is she?" Draco teased.
"Slytherin House has been scrutinised by the school board. They want that House gone, but if I can prove that it can co-exist with the other three Houses, the school board won't have to take action," McGonagall said, taking a sip of Firewhiskey.
"Yes dear, he cleaned me out, he always buys a lot of food, I don't see where he puts it all," She went on, but Draco was seeing red.
Draco coughed to let them know they were still there. They smiled guiltily at them and turned away from each other.
"Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King," Everyone cheered as Blaise took his last shot.
"I am hoping to be open in one week on the 26th July, after I have made some alterations and the two witches who have been working non-stop for the past three weeks gets a rest. I will also be hiring new staff if you could advertise that in the paper for me." Draco said, taking advantage of the free press while he could.
"That I am filling in..." Ron started, but Draco waved him off.
"I have found the artefact," Draco said placing it carefully on the desk in between them both. He stared at his expression hoping it had fooled him. "It was the door knocker."
Harry tilted his head to the side looking at him with raised eyebrows and a slightly amused smile. "Potter updates?"
Tuesday 5th July 2005
"Did you call in your debt for the favour you did for him?" Harry asked.
Moments later Ginny gasped across the table, everyone turned their heads to look at her.
"Nothing that can't be continued later," Draco smiled at her bowing his head and walking passed them squeezing Harry's hand on the way.
“Fuck, Harry.”
Harry turned the tied up Draco around with the chair, so they were now facing each other. He had found himself enjoying being in charge and having Draco right where he wanted him. He pulled his own shirt up over his head and threw it towards the kitchen door.
"Before," Harry said quietly.
"On a Sunday? And you needed Muggle money to tie up "loose" ends." His father was giving him a hard stare. "And it is my business when it's my son's name and picture on the front page of the newspapers, with Harry Potter."
"You stole the door handle and replaced it," Harry replied with venom in his voice.
He scanned the room looking for someone to talk to that wasn't his date when he spotted Neville and Hannah talking to Seamus Finnigan, he excused himself to Ernie and hurried over to them. "Congratulations," He said a little too enthusiastically giving them each a hug.
~~~~...~~~~~~
"And is it true you are doing a whole refurbishment?" She asked with a harsher tone.
Malfoy frowned and dropped the suit on the bed and left the room.
Malfoy scraped his chair back and walked over to him, Harry thought he was going to make fun of him or kick him down as he tried to get back up, but instead, he put one hand out and helped him stand, shaking his head with a smirk on his face.
"And who do we have here?" An old wizard who wasn't wearing a  mask asked.
Draco took the paper from under his arm and let the front page drop open showing him their pictures. Harry snatched the paper from him and read it, eyes wide and mouth open.
"Fuck," Draco exhaled.
"Okay Draco, must we have this conversation at the dinner table." Harry sighed it wasn't the first time he heard Draco boasting at the fact Lily had white blonde hair.
"I am not drunk," Harry replied slurring his words.
"Well, what would you like us to talk about?" Draco asked irritably locking his fingers together and resting his chin on them.
“I don’t know what to do next,” Harry admitted.
"Today is a good day," Draco said, buttering a slice of toast enthusiastically.
“I think it suits you. I like how it looks on you.”
"I'm sorry," they both said at the exact same time which amused them both.
Draco felt a twitch in his trousers as Harry had brushed lightly passed him and his hand had knocked against his crotch, he squeezed his eyes shut stifling a groan.
"Yes, for the Appleby Arrows," Harry smiled.
Teddy lifted his arms in rejoice and ran to Draco giving him a massive hug. "We can go shopping in Diagon Alley or fly brooms; I have one here, don't I Uncle Harry?" Ted asked excitedly his hair changing from red to pink to blue to red again.
"Sorry, Gin, I was swamped at work," Harry replied, to which Draco could see he was partly lying.
They ignored him as Nott put the hair into the flask, he held the bridge of his nose as he drank it quickly and groaned in disgust.
"Your turn," Draco said after they finally parted lips.
"No worries, just grabbing some bits," Harry told her, all the sneaking about made him feel like he should justify why he was entering his office.
He shrugged still not correctly understanding what he was talking about.
"Yes, of course, I will marry you," Harry nodded and helped Draco to stand up. Friends and family were cheering so loudly you would have thought they were at a Quidditch game. "I fucking love you."
There was united agreement through yes's and nods. Cotton looked at everyone and then began to tap a few people already, they got up quietly and annoyedly and left.
"I could travel the world?" Harry shrugged again. "I could move to America and call Muggles No-Maj."
"Nonsense, you take it on the house," She replied smiling pleasantly, but to Draco's surprise, he rejected and told her he would come back with the money.
He stopped for a moment biting his lip, he couldn't leave this way he strode to Harry and gave him one last kiss before he left the room of requirement, and the door vanished behind him.
Harry demonstrated the action with his own hands, which caused Draco to frown and look at his own hands.
"Because of that article," Harry replied.
"Why don't you just pour the second bottle into the first glass?"
He whimpered as the snake started sliding up his lap, it lolled its head side to side closer to him, then began to unravel as Draco heard Harry speak in Parseltongue to it. He watched Harry as he spoke there was an inhuman like look in his eyes. The snake slid away from his feet and was now heading open-mouthed towards Harry as he dangled raw bacon in front of him; the snake caught it in one go.
"For my end of the bargain to work I need complete honesty from both of you, or I will print the version I want to tell," Pansy said in a stern tone which made Harry take back everything he had just thought about her.
"Money is something I have always understood, so no, I think I can work it out for myself,"  Malfoy replied, sounding his arrogant self again.
"That's Hagrid's chair," A small voice from under a small tent made out of sheets Draco, hadn't noticed before. A little boy with blue hair crawled out, startling Draco. "Did you hear me?" The boy asked standing up and folding his arms.
"First of all, how dare you? Secondly, we can go on a ride of your choosing."
"You want me to flirt," He turned his head to Zach, who too was drinking from the bowl. "With that?"
No one was surprised when Hermione raises her hand.
"You're telling me you can't see this?" He waved his wand at the mist.
"I have just been very busy at work, I promise, I will try to make more of an effort to come to Sunday dinners," Harry said earnestly.
"Sometimes Harry; you can be so clueless," Hermione said shaking her head in frustration, to which Harry and Ron both looked at her confused.
~~~~~~~~
Blaise dramatically covered his face. "Stop, you're making me blush."
"I heard you went to see Robards on Friday," Draco said calmly.
His father dropped the newspaper in front of him. His face fell when he saw the large picture on the front cover, him and Harry leaving Gringotts Bank yesterday afternoon. The big, black, bold letters were saying Friend or Foe along the top.
Harry held his broom and bag of uniform as he started walking out of the stadium with his new teammates, but stopped when Malfoy called him back. He said goodbye to Angelina and Jimmy and turned back around irritably.
Draco's eyes snapped open; it was still dark outside; it must have been just before dawn.
"Harry? What is it, it's not your scar is it?" Ron asked worriedly.
Harry sat down nervously in front of Robards confused by the friendliness and un-characteristicness of the of his tone.
"With all due respect," Harry replied through gritted teeth, trying to remember what Dumbledore and Hermione had told him to say, "If he is allowed to return to Hogwarts under the protection of the school, he is considered a student under Ministry Law, meaning that he shouldn't be tried as an adult. As he has never voluntarily left the school, he hasn't been able to finish his education, and he has every right to return."
Harry turned around and looked at all the Weasleys around the table, it couldn't be a Weasley, could it? It would explain how they know so much about Harry he supposed.
Harry had made it into his office without being seen by the reporters in the Atrium, thanks to his invisibility cloak. Annabel, Harry's secretary actually smiled at him, which was a surreal sight to see.
"What do we do now?" Lucius spoke softly with concern which startled Harry.
"You would think it's pretty gay,"
"Ok, fine I look good," Harry sneered. "I don't think it will need much tailoring, do you?"
"Well, that's just ridiculous," Ginny replied. "Harry should be able to be friends with whoever he wants to be."
*****
"Harry and I hated each other's guts in school; yes, I was jealous of him, now can we move on?"
Fred and George strolled over to them. " Birthday boy," they said together, grinning widely.
Harry could only moan and trembled, canting his hips upwards so Draco could go deeper.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked,
Harry stared at the picture of him, and Draco sat in the Ministry courtroom; it was a caught off guard picture of the two of them smiling and whispering. Draco had written "Perfect picture", but the whole of the article had been circled and words of disgust at the poll.
"Please, just go to sleep," Draco groaned snuggling up to Harry. "We can talk in the morning."
"Have you seen Gin?" He asked Hermione, who was talking to the Patil twins.
Harry has never wanted to hex someone so bad as he had done that moment; he was foaming at the mouth. He had unforgivable curses swimming around the forefront of his mind ready to use one, but he bit his tongue, very hard. "What do you want?"
“Well,” he said, “I don’t have lube, but I think I have some lotion.” He looked around the sides of his bed and lunged for a bottle of lotion. He held it up for Draco to inspect. “Think this will work?”
"Gay?" Draco finished.
"Talk to me about what?" Draco asked sipping his Firewhisky trying to act nonchalant.
This made Theo laugh harder and louder than before. "You wouldn't kill me; you are a coward, everyone who knew you in school knew it, your family name is a joke."
"GRYFFINDOR."
Draco had taken him to all the popular Wizarding places they even went to visit MACUSA where he had been offered a job on their Magical Law Enforcement department, but Harry politely turned them down as he had been promoted to Head Auror the day after Gawain Robards had been sentenced to Azkaban.
"Thank you," Harry said, smiling awkwardly at him.
"What can we do for you, Professor?" Hermione asked, after Harry had poured her a glass of Ogden's Firewhisky.
"You can't let Draco into your head, Harry, he will keep using you, you need to fight it, he will kill you as he killed me," The voice of Albus Dumbledore was now in front of him in ghost form.
"If it was a joke, I don't think it would be an amusing one," Harry supplied with a small shrug.
"He is in the kitchen I gave him some bacon, he seemed to like it yesterday," Malfoy shrugged. "But don't change the subject, you are not ill, so get up," He paused. "And get dressed, we have one more day to find this Artefact, and that's it case closed."
He slumped into his desk chair and leaned back as far as he could manage, closing his eyes for just a moment...
They had been walking for what felt like a good half hour when Draco finally slowed down and had come to a complete stop in part of the clearing. His back was to Harry; he was just standing perfectly still again, hands behind his back in the perfectly tailored black suit.
"Probably because he is obsessed with me," Harry argued.
Harry had never really cared what The Daily Prophet had to say about him. After all that had been said about him during Voldemorts return when people were saying he was crazy and mental, he grew a thicker skin and learned how not to let him affect him.
"You decorated?" Harry asked with a tone of disbelief.
"I know, I did on your behalf," She smiled flattening her blonde hair. "Don't look so angry Draco she is a lovely girl and would make beautiful grandchildren."
"No more until you have gotten dressed."
The match was currently tied 40/40, and there was no sign of the snitch yet, Cotton was yelling at them all as he circled refereeing the game. Harry's team had been given four penalties in the first five minutes as team two kept fouling.
Harry found himself staring intently at Draco as he had sleeves rolled up, showing the faded dark mark that he almost forgot he had. It was weird to think this is the man that made his time at Hogwarts miserable, all the bad things he had done and said, becoming a death eater and almost murdering Dumbledore. Yet he was here, having been married for 14 years, and together 15, eating a meal in such a civilised manner.
"What?"
"Thank you," Harry replied pulling his attention away from the daily prophet.
"Mr Weasley, there is no need to apologise," Harry said, trying to spare Mr Weasley from being uncomfortable.
"My father is already there now; he is going to tell him everything; I just hope it doesn't come back around and bite him in the ass."
"Work is fine," he replied in a bored tone.
"What the fuck?" Draco cocked an eyebrow as Harry's wand was inches from his chest.
Draco muffled a moan with the wall, and Harry felt Draco’s hips thrust against the wood. Felt the beginning of a war inside Draco as the other man tried to grind his erection against the wall and simultaneously shift his ass closer to Harry. He let his hands fall to Draco’s shoulder blades and spread his fingers as wide as he could to take in the feel of bone and muscle beneath the shirt. He leaned in and pressed his face there, tested the feel of his cheek against the hollow between Draco’s shoulder blades.
"Excuse me?" Draco said, raising his eyebrows at the witch.
Harry inhaled deeply then exhaled slowly. "We ran into each other in the leaky cauldron about two years ago; I had a bad day at work, so I had a couple of drinks by myself. Draco had been in a booth by himself it looked like he needed company too, obviously he wasn't so willing to talk to me at first, but I would have rather talked to him than sit by myself all night..."
"Yes, now tell me why you need the tracker and don't change the subject. I am pretty sure the ministry has no idea you have a tracker," Harry had his arms folded. He had no idea where this confidence had come from, he never really paid attention to how trackers worked when he was in Auror training, he just knew you had to be authorised to use one, but Draco had at least two from what he could gather.
Harry also kept his promise to Mrs Weasley and has not missed a Sunday dinner since they had returned from America.
"Hello, Ginny, thanks for inviting me. I hope it's okay I brought Ernie with me?" Seamus said, smiling at everyone at the table and avoiding Harry's eye.
Saturday, 23rd July 2005
"Well you were captain in school," Draco replied. "It's not that life-changing."
"I have made some adjustments since then; I promise you will love it; Carpe Diem."
A letter came flying back through the glass window, Malfoy must have caught on not to send them to Anabel. He opened it with excitement; he felt pretty rebellious sneaking letters to each other under the nose of the ministry.
"Happy Birthday," Draco said moving behind Harry and kissing the top of his head.
Lucius Malfoy was definitely up to no good; Harry thought as he knocked on Robards door before entering.
Yours sincerely
"... Goblins, are using them to start the war, my dad says," Luna said dreamily.
Ginny replaced the chocolates with a galleon and the two girls left the shop concealing the box underneath the cloak.
Head Auror
"It's great," Harry replied. "Especially now it's darker, the lights make it seem more magical, and you forget that you're in the Muggle world."
Harry shrugged, and they walked into the grounds together both just as nervous as they saw about fifty people sat on benches on the grass. He recognised a lot of them from school, but there were some he had only seen in Quidditch magazines that have been playing for years. Harry sat next to Angelina Johnson who was another fellow Gryffindor; she looked the same as he remembered her to look, dark with black hair and brown eyes, She smiled warmly at him.
"Where have you been?" Draco growled quietly at them.
"To be honest with you Harry, for me it's always been you. But as for how we became to be it was January 31st, I was with my mother celebrating my new job; we went to Lucinda's, A fancy restaurant in London."
Draco's mouth opened slightly, and Harry slid in his tongue tasting the Firewhisky he had been drinking. He felt Draco's hands running through his hair as their hips grinded close together. Harry kicked the chair out of the way as he was backed against the wall.
~~~~~~
Draco walked through the Atrium holding The Daily Prophet under his arm; he was in a much better mood now he had escaped his father's angry stares and intense interrogation.
"Draco, Harry pictures?" The photographer asked splitting their little moment apart.
"What's wrong with you?'" Harry asked yawning.
"Well, I am curious but not for a malicious purpose."
"For example, Blaise and Ginny are throwing a house party at their home tomorrow night, and we have been invited, I want to go, and you are going to come also," Draco smirked at the outrage and protest that now appeared on Harry's face.
After the group had left, they were each handed their new uniform which was the pale blue colour with their initial and last name on the back and the Appleby Arrows crest on the left-hand side. Harry smiled to himself as he held the uniform firmly to him.
"Um, he was crying and shaking. Does he do that a lot?" Harry asked, even though he had a feeling he already knew the answer.
"We will find it, don't worry. You just need to relax and leave work at work and have fun; you know Carpe Diem."
Harry looked as though he was processing what he had said, and then moved his wand reluctantly away. Draco rubbed under his chin where the wand had left an indent.
"Anything I need to know?" Harry asked her before he went into his office.
"I guess, yeah," Harry admitted.
Harry's mind flickered to his lunch with Draco earlier, and how bizarre the whole conversation had been, he didn't fully understand why his father would think he was a spy or why Draco would get so touchy by it. He also felt weird about the fact there was a slight moment where Draco may have been flirting with him, it wasn't a bad weird either it was a weird he would usually feel when he thought about being in close proximity with Draco.
"I kissed back because I thought my situation wasn't going to change, but it's fine now," Draco said and realised it was the wrong thing to say when he got slapped around the face.
"Excellent," Bill said, with an impressed smile as Malfoy had just sent a curse that Bill almost couldn't dodge. Malfoy sent three different curses now making it even harder for Bill; he wasn't angry, though his eyes were excited and sent three of his own back. It went on like that for another five minutes, Bill's ponytail had come undone and was now resting on his shoulders, Malfoy's Blonde hair was ruffled and sweaty. "I think that will do for now. This is the level of non-verbal spell casting they expect you to be at when you take your practical exams."
"Don't be so dramatic, Morty, or you will be abandoned," Harry said half-heartedly standing up and walking to the small box next to the tree and taking out one of the little dead mice and chucking it towards Morty's eager open mouth.
*****
Draco raised an eyebrow at his father ignoring the dramatic expressions his mother was doing out the corner of his eyes. "You did all this for me?" It came out quieter than he expected, but his father nodded and frowned.
Blaise snorted. "It was on Valentine's day, two years ago, I know you haven't forgotten that."
When he got back to his room, Weasley had calmed down and was sat up with sweat patches all over his Chudley Cannons pjs.
They had little booths and around the sides and moveable tables and chairs down the middle. Some of the diners they went into were very over the top though, they would have hot pink, and silver leather chairs and silver glittered floors with muggle singers framed around the walls.
Draco folded his arms and had a hand rested across his mouth to stifle a smirk, he squinted, and his eyes searched both Harry's.
Harry felt his boxers tighten the lower Draco's hand moved down his bare chest. He stifled a groan as Draco sucked his neck and cupped his cock in his hand from the outside of the boxers.
"After you," Harry said to him stepping aside with his arm out.
"What does Zonko's think about that?" Mr Weasley asked, drinking his pumpkin juice.
He pulled out his wand cast a cleanup spell which, thanks to Draco, he had to use on his kitchen floor after he had smashed his glass, but Harry didn't blame him.
"Giving your circumstances," Robards continued. "I think you should take time to consider what's more important, your job where you are next for Head Auror or," He opened his desk drawer and pulled out a photograph of Harry and Draco on his front porch kissing. "Public humiliation."
"If by good you mean poorly written, politically incorrect and trashy, then yes, you should have fun circling the shit out of it," Harry smirked which made Draco very pleased, he was so happy Harry understood his quirks.
"Um..."
Tuesday 26th July 2005
"You dare talk to me like that in my own house?" Lucius barked his wand hand was shaking, Draco couldn't tell if it was age or that he was being challenged by his own son.
Rose stared at Harry with more enthusiasm then she had ever stared at Draco this made him grit his teeth angrily, he should have expected this, Harry Potter, 'the boy who lived' irresistible to women...and Draco, he thought.
"I hope not," Draco muttered. "I just want us to clear the air and make peace with our past."
"You have had since July to write something."
You're a man now, boy
Daphne looked at him irritatedly, "He said he was going to find the best bed to sleep on."
Loosening his tie from around his neck, Draco grabbed the ends of his shirt and pulled it up over his head and discarded it on the floor and moved on top of Harry. He ripped open Harry's shirt revealing his smooth bare chest; it had been too long, Draco thought.
"Have you still got your undetectable extension charm on your bag, Hermione?" Harry asked as they walked passed the Owl Emporium window.
Harry felt the heat in his cheeks and wondered if he had done something wrong. "Oh okay, what's up?"
"Protect me?" Draco replied. "Protect me from what?"
"Sure," Draco took the jar from Harry's hand, opening it and scooped up some of the contents. Draco’s hands slid up Harry’s back and down to his backside, his fingers pinching the cheeks before sliding between them to move along his cleft and over his opening. The tip of one of Draco’s fingers circled before pressing in a bit, and Harry smiled as Draco slid his finger easily into Harry’s slick hole, causing Harry to sigh almost wantonly.
"Hmm?"
Harry sighed, he picked up the box of mice off of the fireplace before he left the room and made his way back upstairs to his bedroom where Morty had used his whole length to sprawl over the bed. His triangular shaped head popped up when he sensed food.
Harry and Draco looked at each other for a moment, and Harry let out a deep sigh of hesitation. "Something happened to me earlier," Harry began. "And I have my memories back."
Draco pulled slowly away as if wanting to keep going but couldn't, he had let go of Harry now and was backing towards the fireplace. "Please don't go, stay," Harry said quietly.
Harry's face widened with alarm as he picked up his firewhiskey and drank it in one swift gulp.
After Hannah's speech, the tables had vanished, and the chairs moved to the side which meant for Draco, it was time to stand by the drinks table and watch everyone else make idiots of themselves on the dance floor.
“Mm-hmm.” Harry kissed Draco again before letting go of his cock. He pressed up onto the balls of his feet, lifting his arse off of Draco’s lap just a bit. “Scoot down,” he stated.
"Oh, you only like me?" Harry pouted.
Draco took his hand and locked his fingers between Harry's. "This is living, Harry."
"You heard me," Harry replied. "It's about time you treated me like your boss and not anything less, now leave and do it properly."
"Nice to meet you too," Harry smiled nervously. He watched Cotton as he tapped out a few more people and then walked over to their peg and tapped out two of the seekers leaving Harry, Clara and Jason.
"What's going on, Father?"
The look of shock and surprise on Harry's face was enough to please Draco for the rest of his life, as a swarm of people came closer to greet Harry. Draco knew it was safe to step aside and prepare for the scariest surprise.
That was it; Harry had walked stupidly into Draco's trap, he was going to be surrounded by Death Eaters and killed by Voldemort, any time now.
"No, should I have?" He asked looking at the bowl in disgust.
"You weren't close enough to be pushed," Draco replied flatly.
Harry smiled politely. "I didn't come with a date, just my two best friends."
"Ball?" Harry asked interestedly. "At the Malfoys?"
Draco sat in a glittery emerald green car, and Harry got in a glittery scarlet red vehicle, Slytherin and Gryffindor head to head, he thought. Music started blaring around through the speakers and light began to flash. He felt the power, activate through the car and he held the pedal down with his foot, and he started to move forward at a quick speed.
A loud voice shook him from his trance; he turned to the fireplace where a ruffled Draco and angry Ron stood.
The three of them carried on into the ballroom; Harry is feeling a lot more anxious now, the only thing he liked about having a mask on was the fact he could blend in with everyone else once he was out of the eye of the cameras.
Harry, Ron and Hermione and the Gryffindor table clapped the loudest and Ginny stood up and cheered for her eldest brother, who she had always admired hearing about his time at Hogwarts.
Blaise sat down in the armchair opposite Draco. "I need a favour," Blaise said, not sounding like he was up for Draco's pleasantries. "A massive one."
"You shouldn't have followed me, Potter," Draco said in a low voice just loud enough for Harry to hear.
"Okay," Draco exhaled deeply. "When I turned 21, I got a whole lot of inheritance from various deceased family members. It turns out all the bad stuff my parents were involved in got them crossed off the will, but they didn't cross me off as I was just a baby during the first war. The conditions to which was that they never found out about this money until my 21st birthday, when I got an Owl to go to Gringotts and sign the acceptance."
Harry stared at him and raised his brows. "Your collection, what collection?"
"Yes, typical Lucius, all talk, no action," She sighed, and if Draco didn't know any better, he would have thought there was a double meaning to that statement; He cringed at the slip of the idea of it.
"How's the joke shop, George?" Ron asked trying to deflect the attention from him.
"Um, yeah," Harry replied, standing up fully. "Thanks."
Harry's kiss was soundless and thorough, his tongue warm and oddly calming. Draco felt his own dick go hard as Harry's swelled against his groin.
"I was pretty drunk that night, I was lucky I managed to get home," Harry smiled.
"You shouldn't have come round my house uninvited, and then come to my bedroom while I was naked." He said whispering the last part and glancing at the door.
Draco took a step back in surprise. "Pansy, what are you doing here?"
Draco grabbed Harry's wrist and pulled him in and pressed his lips to his not wanting to never have a kiss from Harry again. He felt Harry relax into him and was kissing back. Draco must have been crying cause his cheeks were wet.
"So that's it? We are over?" She asked tears streaming silently down her red cheeks.
Draco checked the time on his watch and saw it was coming up to 12:30, panic struck him again, "pull yourself together, Malfoy," he warned himself.
“It’s how my cousin left it, and what do you mean ‘when we share a dorm’?”
"How is he?" She asked Harry in an unnaturally soft voice.
An owl tapped the window making Harry get off the floor and let it in. It was The Daily Prophet, Harry paid the owl, and it flew away gracefully. To Harry's delight, there was no wanted picture with Draco's face on it, but there was a picture of Theodore Nott.
"I'm sure they are just hungry," He replied.
“Draco,” he groaned as he clenched the muscles wrapped around Draco’s cock, causing Draco’s grey eyes to fly open as he panted.
"He told me not to tell you," She sighed again. "He should have spoken to you."
Draco's side of the bed was empty when Harry had eventually opened his eyes and rolled over; he did, however, see a blurry note try to come into focus on the pillow. Rubbing his eyes with one hand, he grabbed the note and stuck it close up to his face to read; his glasses were too far away, he thought.
He slowly began to slide to the edge of the bed trying to be as quiet and still as possible, and just as he was almost at the end of Harry's fingertips, he felt himself being grabbed and pulled back in the bed and heard a little groan. Draco looked at Harry, whose eyes were still closed, so he tried again, but the grip around his waist was too tight.
Draco shrugged lightly. "Yeah, I guess."
"Sush," McGonagall whispered with a childish giggle behind her tone. "It's a surprise."
"Robards," Draco mumbled.
The next stop before he picked up the crates from The Leaky Cauldron was the cafe he had just bought. He was surprised to see reporters waiting outside the closed building.
Pansy had changed a lot since school Harry noted, she didn't seem like she was the hateful girl she was back then and she seemed to be a respected businesswoman now, which Harry never thought he would be saying in the same description of Pansy.
For some reason, Draco found it "therapeutic" to take his frustrations out on the newspaper instead of anyone else. He hadn't had work for a while now, and it was just making his frustration worse. He used to love his job at first, but Harry could tell it wasn't his passion anymore, and that's why he was so excited to give him his anniversary present.
"What happened to I work alone?" Harry said sarcastically.
He got it. The duck was raised out of the water on the stick, and he handed it to the bored Muggle who took it off and turned it over revealing a red bottom.
He was finally starting to feel as though the piece of soul that he had lost on his last birthday had slowly started to come back, but now it was back to square one.
Draco raised an eyebrow; he wasn't sure if he was intrigued by it or annoyed that Muggles had weird ideas of fun. "What does it do?" He asked, thinking it sounded like a car show.
"No," Harry said at the exact same time giving him a look.
Her smile faded and went into a frown. "Oh, maybe you should leave."
His mother was standing in the middle of the ballroom directing them, and by directing, she was screaming at them. Draco rolled his eyes as he strutted over to her and kissed her on the cheek.
"Guy's this isn't helping," Hermione interrupted. "Where have you been today anyway?" She asked looking him up and down.
"Oh, you're not sitting with us," Hermione said to Harry in an annoyed tone reading off a table chart. "You are on one of the VIP tables."
"Thank's Seamus, I will let him know." Harry stood up and moved along the table giving Mr and Mrs Weasley each a hug.
"Lumos," Draco's wand lit up as he entered the room of requirement. He smirked as a hand reached out from under an invisibility cloak pulling him inside.
Mr Weasley was sat on a small pink footstool twisting some sort of muggle metal stick into a muggle electrical device. Draco subtly rolled his eyes.
Draco scoffed. "I wouldn't say a complete one."
"Bumper cars next," Harry announced getting his attention again.
"Fuck off," Draco yelled, grabbing one of the pillows under Harry's head and throwing it at the overly awake and annoying Blaise.
"Seven I believe he or she has been contracted for," Draco said. "I must say the part about living in the cupboard under the stairs is a nice touch."
"Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes," Ron said quickly.
"I thought you said you didn't want to leave because your friends and family are here?" Draco frowned feeling very confused with this situation. He lowered his voice. "And what about me? I thought we were having fun."
They rocked together in the chair, their tongues and groins in near-constant contact until Harry reached back to the table for his wand and banished all their remaining clothing.
By the tenth pound, Harry had sat down on the grass, tearing up the daisies. “Are you giving up yet?” He asked the now pissed off Malfoy.
His mother opened her mouth and then closed it again before responding. "Fine," She said crossing her arms and narrowing her eyes at his father.
Draco wiped at his eyes and inhaled sharply. He didn't expect that he would have to tell Harry about his artefacts, but he knew now he had no choice. "I wanted it for my collection."
Soon they both panted with the effort; both reached one hand out for support. Draco pushed back toward Harry, aching but wanting Harry further inside of him. His head hung down. Low enough, sometimes, that he would try to open his eyes to watch Harry’s hand around his cock. It was something, watching his dick disappear in and out of Harry’s hand, knowing that Harry’s cock was disappearing in and out of his ass.
"Is that all?" Ginny asked.
“Easy peasy,” Malfoy strutted over to the booth pulling out his pouch of money he handed the short, greasy, haired, rat-faced man some coins, Harry couldn’t see what he gave him but could tell by the man’s frown that it was wrong.
"We are close, as soon as we get him we can find out who he was with that cursed Harry," Ron said in a more business-like tone, he turned his head to the mountains of paper on the table near Draco. "You're not getting involved in this."
Harry floo himself back to Grimmauld Place with a sense of loss and also relief, and he felt ashamed to admit it. When he got out the fireplace, he wobbled slightly from the amounts of firewhiskey he had consumed while he had been sat down awkwardly. He stumbled over to the kitchen chair feeling the drunkness kick in more.
"Stay still," He told his snake as he got into the lift at the Atrium. Morty was covered up in the invisibility cloak; it wasn't that he wasn't allowed to bring a giant snake to work, he thought it would be better to keep him concealed as he passed a bunch of witches and wizards in a busy Atrium.
Harry let go of the buckle and Draco lunged for Robards. Blaise quickly intercepted and with his huge muscles grabbed hold of Draco and moved him out of the way. "No, this is not who you are," Blaise scowled and then turned around to Robards. "I think you should leave."
The black round door handle was still, it had a black snake coiled around it with the head erect and sharp fangs and tongue on show. He tapped it with the end of his wand, and the snake came to life startling him. His hand and wand shook as the snake uncoiled itself and started wrapping itself around his wand snapping his fangs towards him.
Harry exited the fireplace at Andromeda’s home to see Andromeda and Narcissa in the kitchen, playing peekaboo with Teddy while he sat in his high chair. It was odd to see Andromeda and Narcissa together, as Andromeda looked so much like her batshit crazy sister Bellatrix and Harry had only ever seen Narcissa and Bellatrix together before, and not in the happiest of circumstances.
"Pansy," Draco stood up. "What the hell?"
When Harry had caught up to Malfoy and Pansy, they were standing on the bridge between the courtyard and the path to Hagrid's hut.
"Yes, Draco?" Lucius said in an annoyed tone.
"Yes, don't sound too surprised," Malfoy said with a frown.
A few silent moments later, Harry got off the bed and picked up the Black silk suit jacket and put it on in front of the wardrobe mirror. He looked at himself, and actually liked what he saw, Madam Malkins had done a great job of tailoring it, it looked better than the purple suit he wore to Neville's Engagement party.
"Today's court proceedings are for the sentencing of Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy nee Black, and their son, Draco Lucius Malfoy." Kingsley's voice echoed over the newly erupted hissing. Harry found it hard to watch as Draco shook in his seat, his pale face sullen and his eyes bloodshot. "You have been found guilty of being in league with Lord Voldemort."
"He is a lot nicer than school," Parvati noted absentmindedly.
"Me either," Narcissa agreed and then looked at her son. "Are you working tomorrow?"
The dressing room curtains opened to Madam Malkin walking in, and the tape measure got to work quickly whizzing lengthways and widthways up and down his body, then the pins started darting about; he tried to stand as still as he could, telling his reflexes this was normal and not a danger to him.
"I have put your name forward to take over my job here."
"Yes," Draco replied after swallowing a mouthful of soup.
This got the reporters excited, and flashes from the camera resumed once more. "So do you confirm you are in a relationship with someone? We have your last relationship as with Ginny Weasley, the chaser on the Holyhead Harpies."
When Harry's alarm went off at seven thirty on Friday morning, he rolled over and groaned hitting the snooze button with lazy force. He hadn't got up this early in three weeks and was trying to convince himself it will all be worth it when he gets out on the pitch and is flying again. He had received his timetable of Malfoy yesterday, and they were training every day this week.
July 2005
"What?" He replied, dazed and confused.
"Hello, Mr Malfoy come on in," Mr Weasley greeted him with the kind smile he always gave him.
In this AU Fred didn't die (just cause I cry everytime I think about him not being there.)
When Harry had arrived at practice on Tuesday morning, he looked up at the stands there was no sign of white blonde hair, it was the first practice he hadn't seen him sat there. A feeling of worry set in his stomach. Harry had woken up on Sunday morning with a terrible hangover and regret, he had the blurred memory of what had happened on Saturday night and immediately wanted a dementor to swarm down and kiss him.
"Harry James Potter, will you marry me?" Draco was trying his hardest to hold his cool and keep his leg from shaking with nerves.
"You did?" She gasped. "Then why do you look like hell, and Malfoy look like he won the lottery?"
Finally, Draco pulled off and watched his lover soften. Draco's own bones felt slack; he found himself resting his forehead on the floor, as if in atonement.
Ron winked. "Sure, okay, don't tell me then."
"Don't mind me, Mum. I only helped Harry defeat You-Know-Who," Ron said, scraping back his chair and angrily getting up. Hermione frowned at the empty chair and ran upstairs after him.
"Well done, the rest of you are free to leave, thank you for coming." Cotton said the remaining group who were all disappointed.
"Out," Draco replied vaguely.
"It...No...It can't be," Harry's eyes welled with confusion. "What's going on Hermione?"
"So you are not helping?" She asked, putting a hand on her hip and giving him a stern look.
"He could have actually wanted to study," Hermione sighed, shaking her head. "Not everything Malfoy does is because he is plotting something."
~~~~~
Draco had gone back to his old job with Mr Weasley at The Ministry part-time he still owned the diner, and it was thriving better than ever, but he had enough trust in the staff he had hired to be able to manage without him a few days a week while he continues to find dark artefacts.
"Oh good, The Minister should be ready to see you now," the woman beamed at Harry as she motioned to the closed door to his right.
Draco cracked a smile and took a bottle from Blaise. "Did I ever tell you, you're my best friend?"
Harry nodded. "After tonight you won't ever see me again."
Draco stumbled forward and pulled out his wand. Was he about to attack him? He thought as his hand automatically gripped tighter on the wand. Draco flicked his wand and the kitchen filled with light. That was much better; he felt as he could see Draco clearly. He put out his wand and took a better look at the man in front of him.
"Mother where the fuck is the cake?" He demanded.
They arrived at the apparition point, they were outside a set of large black cast iron gates, beyond that was a huge mansion, not as big as his own but nearly. Draco could tell straight away it had something dark inside it, he had firsthand experience with the effects of a dark object used nearby.
Draco inhaled and slowly exhaled. "So what house do you want to be in?" He asked changing the subject.
Draco was still for a few minutes, almost statue-like, Harry observed how pale and gaunt he looked. He had dark circles under his eyes; he looked like he hadn't slept in months.
"It's okay," Draco struggled, rasping. "Just let me go, I can't breathe."
"Ginny, I am so thankful for setting up Ernie and me, it feels like we have been together for years," He heard Potter say and detected the undertone of sarcasm.
"Lucky for me," Draco drawled sarcastically.
"What have you got planned today, Draco?" Narcissa asked, not looking up from her book.
"Either Hufflepuff, like my mother or Gryffindor, like my father," Teddy replied proudly.
“Too bad I can’t wear it often.”
"Congratulations, now you have to carry it around the whole time." Harry gloated.
"Did you manage to go to Diagon Alley today?"
"And he said Yes," Harry cheered.
"This is so unnecessary," He heard Harry mutter to Ginny.
"Or that has slipped out," George said.
"You don't understand," He cried. "I let her down, I was making out with you when she needed me most."
"No, why should I be?"
He moved next to Harry and went to grab for his hand, but as there was no touching, he settled for hovering his hand next to his.
"I know, I am going to try to be around more."
"Because, Potter, for some stupid reason I have fallen in love with you."
He jumped a tiny bit in his seat as the wheel began to move and lift them slowly up.
"I agree," Ginny said also shaking her head.
"I don't need you to stick up for me, Potter," He sneered, but it wasn't his usual hate-filled tone.
Harry tried to focus, but his eyes were blurring, he rubbed them hard, when he moved his hands he was no longer in his study, he was in surrounded by green trees and dirt.
"Good Morning!" Blaise's voice sang, opening the curtains in the bedroom.
Wednesday 6th July 2005
"You're hungry today," Harry noted, raising his eyebrows.
"Before or after?"
"I am here to claim my exclusive," Pansy said, dropping the paper down in disgust.
"Does it matter?" Harry asked exhausted now.
"No, I was waiting for you."
Hermione's face cracked into a smile. "Good now that is out the way, what I was going to suggest is we need to put a disillusionment charm on the boxes, and we can always put the Firewhiskey into different containers."
Harry frowned and then slowly lifted himself off the ground. "I could get fired for this, or worse sent to Azkaban."
"Who kept sending you owls last night?" She asked, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee.
"I said morning Captain," Louis repeated.
Back in the kitchen, the guys' were whispering and quickly stopped when they saw Harry reach the bottom step. "I think I'm going to head off now; I guess I will see you on the Hogwarts Express tomorrow." He stepped into the Fireplace.
"Ok Potter," Malfoy blushed too.
"Don't even bother," Harry advised him as he sulked into the kitchen holding onto a broken broom and looking dishevelled.
He sat down next to Harry, and the Muggle man in charged pulled a bar down locking them in.
This wasn’t like him. He couldn’t stop himself from wanting to fuck his way into that inebriation. To force his way so deep inside that he swam in a haze with him.
The guest list was getting bigger by the second as another owl arrived to him giving their acceptance. Too much pressure, Draco's inner voice told him, he hated the part of him that was weak, but he didn't miss the part that wasn't.
He looked out of the side of the box they had nearly reached the top. "It's quite high isn't it?" He said, feeling more at ease.
He adjusted his position—anything to keep his legs from folding—and leaned against Draco, just let the throb of his cock pulse against Draco’s ass. An urgent need to move built up inside of him. It felt as though he would explode if he didn’t move, didn’t slip into something velvety warm. He started to move to his own pulsing, started to grind himself against Draco’s ass—shift away, grind, shift away, grind.
"What's he talking about Ron?" Hermione asked confused looking at all three men. "What did you do?"
Harry slumped back down in the chair, emotionally exhausted, joined by Draco.
"You're not actually upset I won are you?" Harry asked raising an eyebrow at his new manner.
"No, most of the time I buy them from people in Knockturn Alley, if they need a quick release of them, working so close to the Auror office had its advantages."
He was in Draco's new diner and was genuinely surprised as he wasn't facing the long list of people he saw on the parchment the day before, he was with The Weasley's, Blaise, Dean, Seamus, Luna, Neville, Hermione, Hannah and Teddy.
"What is it?" Harry and Ron asked together.
"Fan-fuckintastic," Harry replied sarcastically lifting up the glass and taking a large swig.
Wednesday, 13th July 2005
"They are against the school rules," Hermione said scornfully. "And besides the charm won't conceal the contents if filch goes snooping."
"No, I am not gay," Nott spit on the ground. "I will make him choose the real Harry, and when he picks me, he will be forced to kill you."
Harry backed up toward the bedroom, both of them tumbling to the bed. The moonlight was streaming in the window, silvering the sheets and Draco's skin. They stroked and massaged each other through their clothes, then removed the clothing with skilled practice. Both kissed tenderly and lovingly, their hands roaming well-travelled territory, but neither man ever got enough of the journey.
"No, I don't."
"Thanks," Malfoy mumbled and proceeded to be dragged away by Zabini.
"Let's just hope the Curse Breaker can break the three-term curse," Seamus whispered to them.
After taking the most amount of pictures he had ever had taken he followed the carpet onto the Ballroom where servers were stood holding a tray of champagne flutes in the doorway, he took two and carried on inside to a half full Ballroom that had large round tables dressed all the way down to the stage.
"Enough!" Harry shouted jumping between them both before they both ended up dead. "Ron, I think you should go home and cool off, I can handle it from here."
Harry sighed and fell back onto Hermione's bed, staring up at the ceiling. "I was hoping you could give me a reason to tell him I can't go."
Harry had laid in bed happy for the first time in ages. Yesterday he had received the best blow-job he had ever received from Draco Malfoy and was told that he was falling for him. He hadn't known what to reply, so he had just smiled at him; which was probably not the correct response to give someone that tells you they are falling for them. Harry was falling for Draco too, and maybe he fell a while ago, but didn't want to get hurt.
"Alright, I bet I can still beat you, even on this crappy broom," Harry challenged making Draco smirk.
"How did you do it?" He found himself asking as he continued to stare at the dark mark.
"Before that, you completely blanked me, and you just upped and left me in the forest." He said stepping away a bit more.
"Okay, so you and Ginny get to live without the consequences?"
"Right, yeah. Well, I best be off, or Mrs Weasley's food will be going cold." Harry nodded and walked to the fireplace.
"Are you and Mr Potter friends now?" The man asked, holding a quill in one hand and a piece of parchment in the other ready to write.
Harry was shocked to see multiple pictures of Draco in front of the Manor door of their case. He was flicking his wand and guiding the door handle with the snake in a bag. It was the snake he had been certain there was before.
"Too late," Ginny said standing up. "Why did you propose to me, Harry?"
"She did what?" Harry gasped. "When was this?"
"Nice to meet you, Mr Malfoy, I have been quite anxious to meet you since I found out you had brought the cafe," Richard said taking a step back.
Harry moaned and let his head fall back as the wet head of Draco’s cock pressed against his balls and slid over the sensitive space behind them.
"Good evening, Blaise," Draco said, returning the hug.
"You will see him at the wedding," Luna said in her usual dreamy soft voice.
Harry shook his head, amused. "Do you have an issue with saying afternoon?"
"Yeah, alright."
******
"What's it intended for?" Harry asked, trying to ignore Hermione's outrage.
He stood up straight and wiped his mouth, a smirk now in place. "Seamus, Seamus, Seamus," He sputtered. "What have I told you about looking so hot?"
He stood in the men's bathroom staring at himself in the mirror exhaling hard.
Draco knew full well his father knew he hadn't and wouldn't tell Harry about the artefacts in the cabinet. "No, of course not."
“Answer me, Potter. Is this what you want?”
"As long as I win something I will be happy," He told him with a small smile. He handed the woman behind the counter a Muggle paper from his pouch, that seemed worthless, but was apparently valued more than the coins.
"Fred, George," The voice of Mrs Weasley called inside the shop. "Is Ron with you?"
"After Draco had left the room Kingsley had decided what was going to happen to us," Harry said frowning.
Draco felt Blaise's eyes on him as he finished reading, It was a confusing piece, he had to admit, it sounded like it was supposed to be a tell-all piece on his and Harry's secret romance, but then suddenly changed to squashing the rumours completely. He put the paper down and looked at Blaise.
"Because, Harry isn't supposed to be hanging around with Malfoy, he is supposed to be keeping his name out of the papers and his lips to himself," Ron said a bit harsher than he probably intended.
"Maybe you could take her to the Ball next week at The Malfoys," George suggested.
"Come on, you know I love those the most," He replied enjoying the look on Harry's face.
"Apologise? Harry, he obliviated your memory and didn't own up to it then gave me the third degree about Nott, when this whole time he knew the truth, and you just want an apology?"
Pleased with himself he did a few more chairs, so they were matching, dark brown wood with a red padded seat. The booths would be trickier and required a more experienced hand. As for the walls and floor, he was going to have to get decorators in. He hoped Pansy Parkinson's Fiance still had his business. He hadn't spoken to her in a few years; they hadn't fallen out, they just drifted apart, he was just grateful she had kept his gay secret out of her magazine; Witch Insider, which is now a bigger seller than Witch weekly.
"He is not my friend," Harry said greyly, grasping his hand onto the hip flask he had in his robes. Out the corner of his eye, he saw Robard smile as broad as the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland. He needed to get out of this lift.
"Not really, it's my money I think I am capable of choosing what I do with it," Draco replied stabbing his fork into the roast potatoes.
"And is that everything?" Kingsley asked sternly.
Morty bowed his head and sulked off out of the kitchen, leaving Harry to himself.
"Just tell me," Draco said impatiently.
"What's this about?" Ron asked grumpily.
An Auror walked to the Malfoys, and Narcissa began sobbing harder. "My son. I need to stay with my boy," she wailed.
"May I ask what's going on?" Harry asked, feeling a bit left out of the loop.
Harry felt a cold, rough surface on his back; his head hurt like hell. He groaned as he tried to lift his head up off the hard surface, he had been laid on. Harry opened his heavy eyelids to see where he was, his vision was blurred, but he could make out he was in his kitchen. His memory of how he got there was foggy he had absolutely no idea why he was on his dining table, and why he was only in his boxers.
"At least you still have all the memories," Harry frowned.
"Ladies and Gentleman, thank you for joining us for the 260th Summer Ball..." A wizard said, standing on the stage the whole room died out as they all began paying attention to the man on the stage.
He kept his head down looking at his lap while everyone was talking, it wasn't helping his anxiety at all, he would never usually have his parents and the Weasleys in the same room as each other unless it was an emergency such as this.
"And how are you going to explain to Muggles how you managed to stuff a 3ft unicorn in your bag?" Harry said poking a hole in his cunning plan.
Before Harry could ask more the fireplace turned green as Hermione and Ron appeared through with what seemed to be two children.
"Isn't father helping you?" Draco asked and then realised how stupid the question was when he finished.
"We can go to mine if you would like?" Harry suggested softly.
"You ok Gin?" Harry asked her softly.
"Yes, sir," Draco nodded disappointedly.
“Yes, Professor,” They said together.
"No, but I am sure you are going to tell me?" Harry said from across the room lifting up piles of clothes and throwing them to the mountain he had been making. They were back in the Manor after an unsuccessful search yesterday, and Malfoy was refusing to stay past half two they carried on the search today. There was still no sign of it, and Malfoy had been sure of three things being it so far, first was a mirror, the second was an old book, and the third was a quill that Harry had dropped out of his pocket.
"Most dark artefacts are old looking and can be useful common objects, like a mirror," Draco said, pointing to the marble dresser which had a hand-held antique silver mirror. He couldn't help but smile when he neared it. It was definitely the artefact, and he needed it.
The morning had come quickly, the next day as Harry laid lazily in bed, he had such a good night last night, he couldn't believe being married to Draco Malfoy, would feel so incredible. Harry had always secretly felt a flutter in his belly whenever he had seen Draco in school, but obviously, he couldn't act on it, he was cruel to Harry, but now he is charming, caring and a little OCD.
Draco stood up not really sure what had just happened or what to do with himself. "Right then, good to know," He wiped the corner of his eye and took a deep breath in. "I guess, we go back to our lives then."
"I would like to request that Draco Malfoy returns to Hogwarts for his final year on strict probation, under the supervision of Headmistress McGonagall. She has promised to keep a personal eye on his grades, and she proposes he spend the remainder of the summer helping to rebuild the school in time for September," Harry continued, giving a pleading stare to the Wizengamot. "Draco Malfoy isn't evil; he is just a boy who didn't have the right influences, and was failed by everyone around him."
Harry grunted in response.
It was lunch time by the time he had responded and sent off the letters, when a knock at the door sent a flutter to his stomach, expectingly, but then disappointed when it had only been another pile of letters that would have to wait until after lunch.
"I don't think eating is a concern right now when my husband doesn't remember who the hell I am," Draco snapped a little more aggressive than he actually meant.
At the same moment, the fireplace filled with green flames amitting two visitors; One being the greying Mrs Weasley and with her was the once blue, now red-haired Teddy, who was teary eyes and puffed in the face as if he had been having a tantrum.
"Happy fucking birthday to me," He said loudly, raising a non-existent glass and pretending to knock it back. "Oh and let's raise a glass to the new happy couple, Ginny Weasley and Blaise Zabini." He repeated the raising and drinking motion and backed out the same way Seamus had.
"No, I was going to make sure we didn't have the same date in mind."
Draco struggled between her grasp, trying to break free. It irritated him when she did this, not because it was uncomfortable or mortally embarrassing, but because he knew he would end up relaxing into her and pouring out his heart and secrets.
"Oh, Lucius, you didn't" Narcissa gasped too.
"Well, next time don't bother," Harry snapped.
"She is ALWAYS in, and why were you looking for Ron?"
Harry's twentieth birthday had arrived, and Draco was a nervous wreck, even more so than usual, he had spent the last month organising a surprise birthday party for him, and it had to go perfectly, there wasn't to be a napkin out of place, he reminded himself. He had just got confirmation that the cake was being delivered to The Malfoy Manner at 4 pm, he just hoped none of the house elves got greedy.
"Draco, darling, how are you?" She asked him, hugging him and kissing each cheek.
"Fine, I should probably get down to see what the ministry wants anyway." Harry accepts the slightly awkward embrace from Draco as he leaves the room.
"I did nothing to you, I was just doing my job," Harry gritted his teeth.
"Well it looks great, thanks Hermione," Harry gleamed.
Harry gave a short laugh, "So what's up?"
He watched Harry carefully searching his face for some sign of agreement.
He let out a small noise of surprise as the duvet began to move and a snakes triangle shaped head poked out of it near his impatiently tapping leg. "Fuck, Morty, don't scare me like that," He whispered, putting a hand on his chest to steady his breathing. The snake stuck out its tongue and covered its head back under the duvet.
"No, I have come here to study," Harry said, pulling Draco back into focus as he waved the advanced potions book he always seemed to carry around. "I could ask you the same thing."
Harry gripped on to the bench and dug in his nails as he tried to tune out everything. He had been practising how to occlude with the help of Hermione and Professor Dumbledores portrait and had gotten quite good at it now he didn't have to worry about Voldemort or Snape trying to read his mind. The need to still learn how to occlude successfully took time for Harry to grasp, he thought there was no point now he was no longer a Horcrux but was told it would be helpful when becoming an Auror.
Draco scoffed. "I am taking a chance on you being on this team, don't screw it up."
"Oh, no Parvati, that wasn't," He was silenced with her lips on his. He didn't kiss back but slowly dodged his head away. "I'm gay," He said loudly to her, and she moved off him. "It was because of Draco, not you."
A triumphant roar of clapping began as Draco and Harry embraced and kissed.
When they all had arrived back to Grimmauld Place, Hermione was pacing back and forth in the kitchen. "Doesn't anyone call first anymore?" Draco exclaimed as he walked in and saw her.
"I'm fine, thank you," Draco said holding his hand in front of the third spoonful of mash Mrs Weasley held over his plate.
"Go back to sleep Weasel this doesn't concern you."
"... It's bad enough you have to work with Potter, I don't know why you put up with it, I would have told Weasley to stick his job where the sun doesn't shine..." His father carried on in the background, but Draco wasn't paying attention to him, he just nodded and shook his head in response but thought about Harry and the lunch they had the previous day.
"And what if they ask you something you don't want to answer?" Harry asked, worried he might let something slip he might not have wanted to share.
"That's not true, this is all new to Harry, maybe we need to try a different approach," Hermione suggested.
Draco began to slow down as they came to a clearing with a perfect view of the sun rising. He checked his watch; it was 3:56 am. Harry hovered next to him as they both looked into the horizon at the most beautiful scene they had ever seen.
“Draco…” came the breathy pant. “Take me…please.”
"Yes, He kissed me in his office, and I pushed him off me."
By this time, Harry was completely at his mercy. “More, Draco. Please,…” Harry’s voice hitched as Draco began to pick up his pace. “Fuck me. Ride me. Use me. I’m yours.” His words broke off in a cry as Draco changed his angle and rubbed right across his prostate. “Yes! Fuck me! Hard…!”
Blaise leaned forward. "Oh shit, are you okay?"
Harry was dressed in blue jeans and a white T-shirt by the time Draco had left his closet. He looked him up and down interestedly, he looked sexy even in that awful outfit, he thought.
“Professor, I don’t think Draco is well” No I’m not. “may I take him to see Madam Pomphrey?” Pansy asked.
The task he’d been set by the Dark Lord, it didn’t really matter. And people hearing their conversations, does it matter? Blaise and Pansy had caught up.
“No” said Draco after he caught his breath “we’re not stuck” he laughed gently, smiling as the sun warmed his face.
“With all due respect–“ began Draco
“I doubt that” asked Notts
He found Hermione and Ron leaning over him. How had they gotten there? Thought Harry.
“It’s making us loop”
“Prick”
She began to draw a diagram.
“I don’t expect such irresponsible behaviour from you” began Severus. Or not? Thought Draco confused that Severus was saying the same things, he’d skipped a few sentences and instead jumped straight into his spiel.
She eyes them both warily
Harry rolled his eyes; he could imagine the face Ron was making. They rounded the corner, Harry could feel himself salivating, he just wanted to get to the Dining Hall. He could manage their affection if he had food in his stomach.
Draco’s face was currently cut from stone. He was sat at the Slytherin table as the conversation washed over him. It was the same, his eyes flicked to Pansy’s she seemed visibly upset with Notts line of questioning. Draco could follow exactly where this conversation was leading. His hands felt cold and his heartbeat thudded in his ears. He looked to the Hall’s ceiling as if he would find the answer to his tumultuous mind stuck in the beams. He felt terribly confused, why were they saying the same thing? Conversation as Slytherins was always a form of combat, constantly weaving around and ensnaring opponents’ emotions without blatantly calling them out. It was an ever changing dance, never the same. But this discussion was so similar, it was an insult to listen to the exact same sentences. He watched Nott as he held the centre of attention, surely it wasn’t a plan on his part. Nott wouldn’t make Draco take the same insult. Everyday Notts was coming up with new ways to call out Draco’s faults. When he thought he couldn’t take it anymore Pansy spoke.
“I know you’re under a-“ Draco waved his hand and made to leave. There was no point in listening, he already knew where this conversation would head. Word for word in fact. Severus reached his arm out and barricaded Draco’s leave.
They sat silently; Draco contemplated their situation. Both of the looping, Potter more then him. Maybe he just can’t count. Draco huffed a laugh; he could feel Potter’s eyes on him.
“I do-“ he began
“About what” responded Draco. A gentle wind was blowing around the ground the sun illuminated Hogwarts from behind. Draco’s home away from home was magnificent in the afternoon.
“Potter you Git!” he called. He couldn’t help grumble about having to carry the wanker all this time only for the shit smear to rush ahead.
He felt people brush passed him, so deep in thought he hadn’t realised the time. He picked his way slowly through the corridors until he arrived at History. He took his usual place with Pansy.
Malfoy paused; his eyes slid to the window behind Harry’s head. Harry watched the green light play across Malfoy’s pointed features.
With the clear dismissal Harry hurried to leave Malfoy’s bedroom. After a few wrong turns Harry found the Common room. It was still mercifully empty. So, Harry plopped himself down on a chair near the window and watched the creature move through the water. He felt at peace in the silent room. Even though the room was much colder than Gryffindor’s, the water had a calming effect. His eyes closed.
Harry could hear Malfoy rummaging in an acescent room, he assumed it was the bathroom. He hadn’t noticed Malfoy leave his bed. Harry strained his ears to hear more. Malfoy hadn’t shut the door properly and Harry could see the shadow of Malfoy moving. Harry heard the spurt of a shower and he looked away quickly. Zabini caught his eyes and flashed him a cheeky smile.
“Fine, let’s go now” Draco said, he watched Potter’s face change. Unable to place the emotion he saw Draco lead the way to McGonagall’s office.
“Potter” he shouted one more time. Draco was ingulfed by Mist unable to see anything he fell.
“You call this a race?” he called over the wind.
“Obviously” Harry repeated
Maybe it was the weight that had lifted from Draco’s shoulder or maybe just the weather. Draco couldn’t say but he felt inclined to agree to what Potter wanted.
“He can’t be here” Pansy gasped when she finally noticed Potter. She gracefully sat in a chair and sent Blaise a reprimanding look.
He leant against the sink and rubbed at the mirror to check his reflection; dark smudges framed his eyes. Casting a quick Tempus, Harry discovered it was 3 in the morning.
Every time he entered a clearing Potter was sat waiting for him, with a growing smile. Finally, Draco decided not to enter a clearing, he walked for what felt like hours avoiding any sign of light until he was sure some creature would jump him. He stepped over a tree root unable to see his feet. When suddenly he was back in the clearing. Potter looked up and started to cackly.
Harry locked the air in his chest, he wasn’t really sure how to answer. He exhaled loudly and shrugged.
“Well, he got stuck in a time hole and is only seen every 37 years” finished Malfoy.
Mr Malfoy a word
“Fine” Malfoy interrupted. It came out mumbled with the blood.
“No Professor” responded Draco “it will disappear in a while or so”
“Fair” Ron responded.
All around him students were standing away from the tables, watching him fearfully. Harry spotted Dumbledore making his way down the tables. Harry was confused, why were they all watching him?
“I was badly injured, I was healed”
“How did you guess?” asked Potter he was now walking side by side with Draco.
Before Draco made up his mind Pansy decided to get involved.
Harry rubbed his face, he looked up at Malfoy. Malfoy leant back and crossed his arms over his chest. His hair had now been sleeked back and fitted robes swished around him in a flourish. Something he’d probably learnt from Snape. Malfoy huffed in displeasure and dropped himself into the chair opposite Harry.
“Are we talking about Malfoy?” he asked.
“You deserved it” responded Draco without a second though “it wasn’t a dream” he spat.
There was no escape, he would be stuck with Malfoy forever. Looping endlessly, until Malfoy killed him. He assumed one of the Death Eaters had caused this, probably Lucius. Well maybe not, Malfoy had many chances to kill him. He’s got many more Harry thought sullenly.
5th October 008
“Uh..” he faced Ron again. He could see the rest of his friends settling at his table. They watched him curiously. Hermione’s face was particularly worried.
Draco pushed himself from the wall he found himself leaning against. His mother would chastise him for his posture.
“M’sorry” mumbled Harry. He folded his hands in front him and clenched his fingers.
“Are you listening?” asked Potter. He had stopped as well.
“This won’t solve anything” said Severus. Draco felt his frustration welling.
“Not particularly.”
“There are two options. The first is this: your minds are stuck in this time. Once you get back to normal time everything will continue as normal. This implies you are in a spell of some kind”
“The forbidden forest?” Asked McGonagall
“The forest would be my bet, there is something in there affecting you. Let us review it after lunch together”
“Of course, I do” sniffed Malfoy.
“Why don’t you enlighten me” responded Malfoy blankly.
Potter’s face seemed to well with relief. With Potters eyes on him, Draco racked his brain with what was happening. Was Potter scared Draco would kill him? Is this what it was, an instinctual defence? But he hadn’t defended himself, at least not intentionally.
“Harry” began Hermione “you were with us all of yesterday”
“Potter!” Malfoy shouted.
“How do we do that?” Harry asked
“Mr Potter, come with me” said Dumbledore.
Potter shot Draco a dirty look.
She sighed heavily and disappeared into her room. Harry turned back to Malfoy in confusion, but once again Malfoy shrugged. She returned with some books.
“What’s that Potter, why the long face? Your ugly looks weighing you down?” Malfoy was practically preening
“So everyone else is forgetting?” She said. She tapped her wand in thought.
She nodded her head knowingly.
“Harry” someone cried.
“What are you doing?” she asked Draco, he pulled himself to his feet and dusted himself off. He smoothed his hair back into place and gazed at her emotionlessly.
“Potter” said Malfoy
Not a minute into Professor Binns lecture and already Pansy was hounding him
At the table he sat and waited for Potter. The Slytherin conversation washed over him. He waited and he waited. When the Potter followers arrived, he expected Potter too. But he didn’t arrive.
“Whatever your thinking, don’t” He could feel the other eyes on him, but he ignored him they weren’t important.
She harrumphed and a fond smile broke out on Ron’s face. As Flitwick began the lesson Harry got a strong sense of de ja vu.
Neville paused to contemplate this “not that I remember, how long were you gone for?” Harry couldn’t think what had happened yesterday that was different from the day before, but he remembered Seamus’s cauldron. He felt his heartbeat pick up and a cold sweat slid down his back. Let’s think about this, uh, calmly?
