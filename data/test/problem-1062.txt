“Now you two snog,” she orders, and both of them, identically, look like they’ve been snapped from a trance. They burst apart, scrambling to opposite corners of the bed, all the stilted conversation and tension of the elevator lost.
“And I’m sure you only do what you’re allowed, right? Such a law-abiding citizen, here in your illicit potions lab.”
"I saw the way you were looking at her, Malfoy." That neutral tone again. Potter waits a beat, studying Draco's face. His eyes burn, hot and hungry, and Draco can't look away.
Harry scowls at him. He doesn’t actually need more potion this time. In fact, he wasn’t even sure how he’d wound up here; at the end of the day, he’d just wanted to go back to Seaside Lane. But Malfoy doesn’t wait for him to justify himself.
Of course Harry falls asleep almost right after, the lout. He casts a couple of wandless cleaning charms — solicitous and sweet; Draco feels them spread over his body like a comforting blanket — and then he snuggles into Draco like he’s a pillow. Of course he'd be a cuddler, too. After Ginny goes off to the loo, Harry rests his cheek on Draco’s chest, as though he's been doing it for years and he has every right to be there. As though it makes perfect sense.
Certainly he’s had more than one, or two, or twelve or fifty wanks in the shower while thinking about long, lanky, sharp-featured, blond… Quidditch players. With long and delicate hands. Not really Quidditch hands, actually, or Quidditch bodies. Not Quidditch anything, really. It took him a year to realise that whole thing was about Malfoy, and when he did, he tried to forbid himself from it for another year after that, which only made him want to do it more.
“In some alternate universe, maybe a different job might work,” Harry concedes. “But I think being an Auror is right for me now.” He tries to sound confident, tries to make the words make sense. It truly feels like the only path that’s reasonably open to him. And he’ll get to work with Neville and Parvati, at least.
“Oh, I don’t know… you could go back to the joke shop again. Or open a bakery, or a coffee shop. Or a bookstore.”
Ginny’s looking at someone behind her, just off to her left, whom Draco can’t see. Somehow he’s approaching her before he even quite realises what he's doing.
They make up for lost time. They fuck in every room of Grimmauld Place: on the kitchen floor, on the dining table, in the shower, up against the front door. They lie down in front of Walburga’s portrait once, on purpose just to scandalise her, although they both have to go into the bedroom to finish.
And yet, still standing there with a tumbler of whiskey in his hand, is Potter. He’d been so oddly silent. Potter looks exhausted and terrible, and also delicious. A rumpled linen suit in dark blue, a pale crooked tie, scuffed loafers that are appalling even for him. It’s all wrong but perfectly right, in the way only he can be.
“I even slept well, after— well, after.“ Harry earns himself a raised eyebrow from Malfoy before he turns away.
"What?" she asks, guarded. But he feels her soften again when he asks, "Wherever did you get that incredible couture you had on tonight? I really did want to know."
"Wasn't Severus supposed to teach you? To be an Occlumens, I mean." There's genuine curiosity in Malfoy's voice.
And then Ginny finishes her first few semesters of uni, where — according to Ron — she does literally nothing but eat, sleep, and play Quidditch. She comes to visit Harry once, stepping out of his Floo unexpectedly one rainy December night. He hadn't even realised his wards were open to her.
a voice in his head roars out of nowhere. He's suddenly, violently jealous.
This time, he puts down his wand and climbs back into their bed, his heart still hammering away in his chest.
Malfoy motions to a worn leather couch. “Sit,” he orders, and Harry sits like a dog. A strange thrill rolls through him as he considers his unthinking obedience. It’s electric, a buzz that sparks somewhere behind his eyes.
"This place is disgusting,” Ginny says, but she’s walking toward him, a small smile threatening to escape.
He hands over the thick white mug, and Harry takes a sip. It’s perfect. They don’t speak until Malfoy’s stirred and sipped his own coffee.
"Talon Ted!"
, that’s the last thing he wants — and Harry’s whole world tilts. He feels unmoored, like he might drift off the bed without Draco’s weight anchoring him there.
. But once they're in the tiny elevator, no one seems sure what to do or where to look. Harry stares down at the keycard in his hand and repeats "room 1124" in his head. Only when the elevator doors slide shut but it fails to move does he remember to press the button for the eleventh floor.
37 Seaside Lane is farther down the road than Harry had predicted. Its address is misleading; except for the small, cloudy fish tank in the lobby, this dingy building feels a million miles from the sea. Harry casts a discreet discovery charm, and the only magical signature he detects is just above his head, so he climbs the stairs to the second floor: a solicitor's office, an insurance agency, and Premier Pharmaceuticals.
Foreplay, he thinks. All right. Foreplay. Mentally, he reaches for every soft, romantic gesture he can find, and then remembers how this used to go; Ginny used to love when Harry would cast wandlessly and wordlessly. When he could just make things happen.
So it’s Ginny’s turn to throw aside the thin sheet, get up, and storm out of the room. Harry’s relieved to see her go. This bed has become torture for both of them.
In the war's aftermath — the months and years that Ginny never wanted to discuss, ever again — the soft parts hurt too much to bear. So she hardened her heart, narrowed her eyes and steeled her spine.
Without being able to see what’s going on, he assumes Ginny’s got the strap-on fully inside Draco. Harry had never let Ginny use it on him — not properly, anyway. They’d played with it, but it was always too much. It felt like a demand, or a signal that he wasn’t enough. He’d always resented it, somehow, as yet one more exhausting thing to negotiate, to have to get through. He couldn’t believe she wanted more from him, back then, when he’d had nothing at all left to give to anyone. He was always disappointing her.
“Oh shut it, you old hag," Ginny snaps. Honestly.
flying is dangerous for
It happens nearly every time he's pulled out of sleep, to be fair, particularly on the rare occasions he’s managed to sleep well, so it's not specific to this unfamiliar bed or the people in it. But this morning, when he first opens his eyes, there’s a bony elbow an inch away from his face and Harry finds himself on his feet, shouting incoherently with his wand raised to attack, before he’s even had a single full conscious thought.
“Yes, fine, I like it. Would you fucking
“Sex?!” The word squeaks out of Harry, idiotically, and he can feel his cheeks go red.
They squash up against Harry in the back of the elevator and block his view of the others, and he immediately feels claustrophobic and hot. Harry knows he's jumpy and guarded, these days. And, yes, mean, too, like a dog who's been kicked too many times — or, more correctly, a person who’s been used in others’ plans too many times. He’d been told he's good and brave so often, but guilt and anger and aimlessness are different kinds of enemies. Harry has no power against them, no tools to fight.
He tells himself that he needs to be more okay than ever. There’s another
“Yes!” Ginny’s starting to laugh now, a sweet sound that starts low in her throat. Impulsively, he leans over to kiss the spot softly. She smiles when he sits back. “How about becoming a professor? I could coach the house Quidditch teams. We could go live at Hogwarts, all together.”
“Harry,” she echoes, anger creeping further into her tone. “We’re supposed to be partners, you absolute
“Fuck,” he whispers. And then he hears himself say “fuck” a second time, louder, after he realises he’s just said it out loud.
“Hmm.” Ginny makes a noncommittal noise; she hasn’t actually tasted anything she’s eaten. "They do have napkins, you know."
This one is different. Not a quick hit of lust and energy, but something deliberate and considered. It’s a real kiss, their first. Solid and warm, tender, even. Potter’s mouth is hot and insistent and Draco melts instantly, just like he knew he would. He’s never had any defences against Potter, never been able to match him for a moment, and he can’t even try now, can’t mount any sort of challenge. Instead, he brings his hands up to cup Potter’s face and tangle in his hair, to let himself get lost.
Felicis.
As Harry lowers his hands, Malfoy claps slowly. He’s smiling again.
Ginny interrupts, shaking her head. "Stop. This isn’t about Al. It's about us. You told our teenage son something you’ve never told your own wife?”
They talk to three other Healers, including a sports medicine expert, and they all say the same things: cushioning charms aren’t 100 percent effective, there are other dangers too, sudden altitude changes cause undue pressure, on and on. No Quidditch; no flying.
He went to sit next to her, still fully clothed, and when she moved aside to make space for him, the sheet slipped from her shoulder. There was a large bruise there, yellow and purple, healing but still angry. It was so vivid that it stood out even in the dim light.
“How about a nice bow in your hair, to soften the effect?”
"Oh," he says, forcing himself to lower it. His heart is still beating so hard that he can't quite convince himself there's no danger here — and, fuck, he thinks as his brain catches up to him, he just slept with Ginny and Malfoy at the same time. Maybe there
something, Harry!” she says, her voice rising, and finally he blurts out, “I don’t know, let’s go see a Healer, yeah? Maybe they’ll know about some of these… issues,” he finishes lamely.
— like James. Harry clutches his head. He will not think of Dumbledore. He will not think of the station, will not think of the perfect respite he felt there, how it felt to be calm and clean and whole in the midst of all that darkness and death.
“No. A friend told me about you.” Harry can hear the defensiveness in his voice. Why is he here, arguing with Malfoy? This was a stupid whim, a lark. He doesn’t even want the potion this badly, he thinks. Things with Ginny aren’t so bad. He could leave without it, right now — but he doesn’t.
to hex more than one of their classmates. But James and Ember both, even though she’s still a tiny thing, have a certain toughness to them. A thicker skin.
“Well, if you claim you’re not queer, I honestly don’t have much use for you.” Malfoy stands up and begins to clear the tray.
And Harry makes the choice, then, to keep going — just at the moment when, in the past, he's always chosen to stop and turn back, to hide.
This small show of efficient concern, almost clinical, the way a Healer would inquire — it stirs something in Harry. He wants Malfoy to ask him more questions, he realises. Wants to keep talking.
Felix
“Potter, you—“ Draco begins unsteadily.
“Come on, you wanker.” Harry laughs; it feels odd to joke casually with Malfoy the way he would with most anyone else. “As though you wouldn’t just use Lumos. You’ve known that spell for twenty years.”
“Neither have yours, apparently.” Harry steps inside and closes the door, but doesn't sit down. He tries to find his footing in this conversation; he’d forgotten how odd and off-kilter Malfoy always made him, and suddenly he feels the old wish for Ron and Hermione to be by his side. They were still close, in a way, still got the kids together on birthdays and holidays, but nothing like they’d once been. It was inevitable, he supposed. Of course everyone was busy all the bloody time, but at times like now, he missed their presence in his daily life.
"Do I have to guess which one? What a delightful game. Hm." Malfoy leans back and considers him, and Harry feels a prickle at the back of his neck. A warning, an uneasiness.
, Harry thinks, as Draco makes short work of the buttons on his trousers, jerks open his zipper, and mouths him over the thin grey cotton of his pants. Harry arches up and has to steady himself against the bar. He can’t stifle a gasp, loud and dramatic in the tiny elevator, and that seems to prompt Draco to give some sort of involuntary low growl and finish the work of taking Harry’s cock out. In the lift, the same one where he helped Mrs Cartwright in 6B pick up all the shopping she’d dropped from a torn bag earlier that day. Draco’s knees — Draco,
— and suddenly, unexpectedly, Harry's coming with an inelegant grunt. He's fucking into his fist and the mattress, riding out his orgasm and giving himself a sharp twist at the end. He sprawls out, panting, relieved but vaguely disgusted with himself, like this is wrong or cheating, somehow. An image of Ginny appears behind his eyes. He pushes it out again, gives one last thought to the cut of Malfoy’s collarbones and the way his sharp Adam’s apple dips when he swallows.
, think about Voldemort, Voldemort’s soul. He will not think about how that figure looked like a baby, looked like —
"What, Potter?" Draco looks around, trying to feign a disinterest he does not feel. Fireflies and fairies flit high in the air, and a spring breeze ruffles the canopy of trees that brush the top of the high ceiling. It's beyond bizarre to be having this conversation, any conversation, really, with Potter, just standing in the middle of a party as though they speak every day. As though they haven't been enemies or strangers or both for their entire lives.
He lasts less than a week before he’s back for more. He’d gotten it up for Ginny, twice in one night. He’d been able to think of the right things to say, to remember what they had, and his desire felt real. The potion had tasted oddly good, sweet and acidic like fruit juice. He didn’t think about Malfoy and his hand in this. Well, hardly at all.
, Harry thinks as he looks down at the baby in his arms. The tiny fists, the rosebud mouth, the huge eyes that went from blue to brown just a few days ago.
He can’t even speak, he just shakes his head and blindly, wandlessly, waves his hand at the buttons. He doesn’t even think of a spell, just casts his will toward the panel, thinking only, go go go.
Wordlessly, Malfoy turns back into the featureless office and sits behind a bare desk — cheap, made of pressed wood. There's another door behind him, standing slightly ajar, that must lead to the lab itself.
“I’m not ready,” she says, already breathing hard, as Harry begins to Levitate half their flat — later, he’ll discover that he’d packed seven t-shirts but no pants for himself, and not a stitch of clothing for Ginny — into an empty bag. “The baby’s not ready.” But by the time they get to Mungo’s, it’s clear he’s on his way. The monitoring charms show he’s fine, a strong heartbeat and good activity. There’s a special charm too, a jet of warm, golden-pink light from the lead Healer, that somehow reassures the baby, tells him not to be afraid. Harry’s not sure of the details, but it helps them all relax.
“You think I know what I’m doing just because I’ve fucked men before?” Malfoy is up in Harry’s space — close, too close — but also not close enough. “I’ve never fucked
“A bow? No. I don’t want to soften the effect,” Ginny says, more annoyed now, adding extra black eyeliner just to spite the mirror.
“Not for me,” Harry insists, and Ginny rolls her eyes but smiles.
With an oddly graceful movement, Ginny sweeps up the rest of the vials and dashes them to the floor to join the one that’s already laying there broken. Thick purple liquid oozes onto the tile, mixing with the glinting shards of glass. Ginny pulls her wand from her pocket. She sends a thin jet of pure fire towards the mess and it lights up in purple and black flames. Harry can feel the heat from it, unearthly and strange, and its sweet smell reminds him of the taste of the potion.
“Sorry for Ginny being so” — his eyes scan the room as he searches for the right word — “aggressive. She’s like that a lot now.” He sounds so bloody tired.
Ginny strides into the middle of the room and looks around — it’s quite nice, actually, modern and clean, all tall windows and dark grey walls. There are square fixtures and a small desk in the corner, but most of the room is taken up by a huge bed, covered in a fluffy white duvet. It looks delicious, anticipatory, like a pile of whipped cream waiting to be licked. What is Malfoy on about? She hates him a bit, suddenly, again. She catches a glimpse of that naff earring and remembers why she’s hated him for practically her whole life.
“Yes,” Harry manages to say, but it’s too little, too late. The bed shifts as Draco moves
“No, it’s not… it wasn’t like that,” he says lamely, still pressed against the sink.
Draco shudders — he
need to use it for? That’s why I want it. Among other reasons.”
"What can eat more kebabs than a dragon?"
A few more hours later, they’ve finally made it to Harry’s bed. (Draco’s cast half a dozen freshening charms on his bed, themselves, and everything within his wand’s radius.) Harry’s on his back and Draco is curled into him like a comma, head on his chest.
Charlie is around but remote, cool and distant like an older sibling who doesn’t have time for you. The other handlers give him a very wide berth — perhaps because they’re intimidated, or simply because they don’t like him. He's certainly made their lives more difficult.
“I should go,” he says, and Malfoy answers, too quickly, “Yes, you should.” He motions Harry out and they walk back through the lab and the office. Malfoy holds the door open and Harry steps through, too close. He pauses and he can smell Draco, now, coffee and soap. The buzz starts up again.
He's always felt uncomfortable wanking when his sleeping kids are around — let alone his mother-in-law downstairs — but the urge is undeniable tonight. He’s been on edge all day. He puts up an extra-strong silencing charm, throws a locking charm at the door, strips off his clothes, and falls into bed already half-hard.
She cut her hair short. She spent a lot of time alone, away from the hurt and pain and guilt of her family. She imagined herself growing armour, all over her body, shining and silver and impenetrable. She learned to stalk into a room, to cast her eyes around it like searchlights.
Something clicks inside of Harry, then — something warm and welcome, triggered by the feel of so much skin against his own, and he feels his body relax. He lets Draco walk him backwards to the bed, and they both sink down to it. Draco's hands roam everywhere and Harry pulls him on top; he wants Draco’s weight on him, wants to really
Did he go too far? Ginny throws her head back with earnest laughter now, but Draco studies Potter’s face, nervous. But he breaks too, laughs quietly and looks down at the carpet, rubs the back of his neck like he’s embarrassed, like he’s not the bloody hottest thing alive. His cheeks have gone pink, and he looks up with an abashed smile, and if it’s possible for him to get even more attractive, he’s gone and done it.
Harry hates Romania.
“Take it or leave it, Potter. The first one's on me.” Malfoy turns away, as though he already knows what Harry will do.
Harry sighs and sets down the scrubber. Still not looking at her, he says, “It was something I took a couple times, to…"
Still just staring, immobile, Harry can’t figure out why he’s still thinking about Malfoy’s clothes, about
“Wait a minute, Potter,” he hisses, grabbing Harry’s shoulder and pulling him inside.
Oh no, he thinks. No, no, no.
"Do you have any idea how fucking hard it is, how…" She breaks off, searching for the words. "How claustrophobic and relentless it is, to be the sole source of food for another human being? Do you think I'd keep doing it if I didn't think it was really fucking important?" She glares at him, but they're trapped; they can’t just walk away from each other for a good long while, which is their usual technique for diffusing or avoiding fights. They need each other too much, need to hand off the baby or struggle for a quick nap before James needs to eat again.
No, he thinks.
Harry can't stop himself from smiling. He should be furious, and he’s still so fucking embarrassed he can’t see straight, but he can’t argue the point. His Occlumency skills
Harry hasn’t claimed that, actually, and realises that Malfoy is messing with him, fishing for information. Fine, then, he thinks. Two can play.
Ginny shrugs one freckly shoulder, but she's pleased, he can tell. "Merlin. You ought to be in fashion."
She looks at him askance; they know each other far too well for that kind of light deception. “Like a Muggle potion?”
She stays far on the other end of the table from Harry, tucked behind a huge fern and keeping a wary eye on him, and eats six tiny profiteroles in a row. Of course, he spots her anyway, and he seems to brighten a bit. In a moment, he's just there, in front of her.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry says gruffly, swallowing hard.
The elevator glides to a stop again and the drunken Muggles tumble out, smelling of whiskey and cigarettes. Alone again in the close confines of the elevator, Harry catches Malfoy looking apprehensive and Ginny looking downright furious, and he only dimly knows how he’s got here or how he’ll manage these two utterly unmanageable people, who’ve both occupied his thoughts for the better part of a decade.
He gets up from the bed and looks around the room, gathering his magic in his palms. With just a little effort, he sends it out. He swings the heavy curtains closed against the hazy city lights, conjures some tall candles and touches them with flames, turns down the bedcovers.
Pegging is Ginny's favourite, favourite thing.
“Turn,” he says, so quiet, in a voice Harry’s never heard from him before. He isn’t sure he likes it. Malfoy wasn’t meant to be quiet like that.
But Harry had found comfort in moving his things the Muggle way. In the end, he’d had far more in those boxes than he’d anticipated. He hadn’t realised he had that many things to care about.
James is born a few months later. Ginny’s contractions start hard and fast, too early, in the middle of the night. Harry never sleeps much or deeply, and he’d awoken with a start when he felt her shift in the bed in an unfamiliar way. Ginny looks at him with panicked eyes.
“Not that it’s your business, but there’s no point in trying to be normal,” he says, voice flat. “There’s no coming back from what I’ve done.”
Ginny always floats away from herself during sex, somehow, whether she's with a man or a woman, magical or not, kind or not. One or two or even three at a time. Even now, she likes to be in charge, and to not be so nice about it. It turns her on to feel as though she's watching the whole scene from a distance. It probably isn’t… healthy, or whatever. But it’s okay.
“Of course I fucking knew,” Ginny spits. “Of course I’ve known forever. But you didn’t tell me, and that’s the point.”
"I've been wanting to tell you for a while now," Potter starts again, "that I'm sorry about not doing more for your mum. I should have been more forceful with the judge, or clearer about what she did for me, or something. I was messed up then, really messed up, but I should have prepared better. I wish I’d done a lot of things differently. I’ve felt bad about it all these years."
“The fuck, Potter?!" Draco sputters, and Harry doesn't know if he's talking about the elevator or him coming in his pants like a teenager. They’re still speeding upward and off balance, hanging onto each other, but Draco grabs Harry's hand and pulls it down to the bulge in his crotch.
“Does that sound all right?" she asks, and Draco can't manage a sound. He just nods like a fool, still tangled in Harry's gaze.
“The great Harry Potter, running away,” she says, quietly, bitterly.
He ends the sentence and Harry has no choice but to pocket the vial and leave, muttering an embarrassed thank you and closing the door behind him, finding himself back out in the featureless hallway once more.
Ginny's gaze flies up to meet his again, and she feels her own mouth drop open in surprise.
“Hello, Ginevra." She just looks at him, a strange and unreadable expression on her face, so Draco ploughs on.
“Oh, spare me the theatrics, we both know you’re coming,” he mutters, and he grabs Harry’s arm and Apparates them out directly into the night, into a street full of people, into the freezing night air of an old, exhausted year about to turn new.
like that,” she says, her voice too quiet. “While we're on the subject of sex, did you tell Al you’re bi?”
"Wow, there's a compliment," she says, proud of the chilliness she's managing to project. Harry looks a bit wounded — good, she tells herself, though the choker presses at her throat uncomfortably now.
“Gin,” he croaks, but he doesn’t know what else to say.
“Sure, Potter, but generally I do prefer a snog first,” Malfoy says in that infuriating tone, and Harry wants to clap back at him, but he’s paralysed, suddenly. Frozen in ice.
Distantly, he felt Ginny’s hand on his leg, through his dress robes and his jeans underneath, but he couldn’t bear it, couldn’t be touched, couldn’t be in that room with her. So he ran, leaving Ginny naked and alone in her bed, knowing it was the wrong choice even as he was making it. Yet another thing he’d fucked up and could never fix.
“Not literally on your head, Potter. I meant — hiding. You don’t have to hide.” Malfoy’s still smiling that smile, and it’s simply too much, Harry has to smile back. It’s like his face doesn’t consult with his brain first and just responds, automatically, right along with some sort of buzz down his spine that warms his whole body and settles, unsettlingly, in his groin. He shifts, hoping Malfoy doesn’t notice.
Draco wants to turn and look at it, but he’s mesmerised by the feel of what must be a large dildo pressing into the small of his back — and by Harry, still lying so close to him that Draco can hear him breathe, green eyes hooded but searching his face. They’re not touching, but Harry’s so close that Draco can feel the heat of his body, can study his face and his eyes, strangely unguarded. He can look and look and look, just the way he’s always wanted to.
After the court had adjourned, Potter had passed by in the corridor outside the courtroom and his glance briefly landed on Draco’s panicked and tear-stained face. His mother had been shackled and led away by Dementors a few minutes earlier; Draco had been hyperventilating and pleading with their stone-faced solicitor, who loathed him and couldn’t have cared less about their fate. Potter paused, muttered, “I tried, Malfoy,” and kept walking. They'd only spoken a handful of times since.
“Yes," Ginny says forcefully, as though she’s made up her mind to be angry. "Yes, Lesbians R Us was having a sale. They’ve been bought out by Stodgy Arseholes Who Don’t Belong Here R Us, which must be getting a lot of business from you these days. Or perhaps it’s Stodgy Arsehole Death Eaters Who Deserve To Be In Azkaban With Their Abusive Daddies. I hear their clientele is quite active as well.”
“Yes. Yes, I would like that. Merlin, you’re mean,” he says, and she laughs again.
They do this for years, all through Ginny’s time at uni and Harry’s time doing… whatever it is he's doing. They use sex to push down every emotion, to rechannel everything into each other. Harry would fuck her anywhere, just to forget.
him. Enjoy his company, want the feel of his body next to hers. Whenever Draco pulled in the past, he’s made sure he was gone before the flush of lust can leave anyone’s system.
"Why are dragons good at telling stories?" He has a bit of cream on his lip, and he doesn't wait for her to answer. "Because they know a lot about tails. Why did the dragon stop fighting knights?"
“Oh, is that right? I'm sure you have absolutely no idea,” Draco says drily. “Anyway. My fee is this: I want an exemption from the anti-Legilimency statute for convicted criminals.” His voice twists on the last word, maybe just a bit, although Harry might be imagining it.
Draco makes sure his face is impassive as he absorbs the sting of her words. He’s heard far worse than this. He’s been shoved in the street, kicked, elbowed, screamed at, had his broom hexed while he’s flying it. He knows the sensation of someone else’s cold spit sliding down into his collar as they scream obscenities into his face. He takes it all because he deserves it, and more. He wants it to hurt.
Harry grimaces; the Mind Healer has used the same word. “Like what?” he asks.
Ginny snorts. "Maybe you should remind
He can’t quite find the words, but she isn't letting him out of it. The silence stretches between them. “To increase my libido," he finally finishes.
— before Harry has to look away. He sputters something unintelligible about contraceptive potions.
He gives a small, humourless laugh. "Yeah, that sounds about right. Obviously I don't want to be here," He ducks his head and rubs at the back of the neck, so familiar that it makes Ginny's heart twinge again, bloody hell. "Magnolis, at the Ministry — he says I'm up for promotion next month, so I've got to engage with the community more, or some bullshit. I came early so I could show my face, prove I was here, and then skive off as quickly as possible before I had to actually deal with anyone."
“This is hardly a cavernous lair,” Harry says, looking around. Everything is beige. The flowers in the painting refuse to budge. It reminds him of a Muggle medical office.
“Well, maybe you could consider something a bit more appealing,” the mirror says, and, not for the first time, Ginny regrets hauling it here from her childhood bedroom at the Burrow. “Perhaps, oh, I don’t know, a nice rosy cheek? A pale pink lippie?”
The first few weeks are difficult. Immediately after they bring James home, that old burden of proof — the feeling of being constantly scrutinised (by the Weasleys? Hermione? himself?) to make sure he’s okay — roars back and grows heavier. It settles on him like a physical weight.
to be talking or thinking about his family — ever, if he had his way — but he just doesn’t know how to interact with Potter. He never has.
, after all, a completely helpless one who needs him blindly and constantly. And Harry has absolutely no idea what to do — how to hold a new baby, or feed it, or change a nappy, or make it stop crying. While Ginny was still in hospital, people had told him that everyone feels that panicky new-parent feeling, but Harry can't help but believe it's worse because he's never seen someone be a parent to an infant.
“No,” Draco blurts, and Draco never blurts. But his words are a runaway train, now. “I mean, no don’t forget it, and yes I want to get out of here. With you. Yes.”
“Likewise,” Harry says, and he does feel a fool now. What is he even doing here? He stands up abruptly, his knees cracking loudly in the silent room.
of us will be fine, he thinks, and the light glows a bit brighter. They would be three.)
“No more
Ginny tips her head back and laughs in earnest, exposing her long throat, and Harry kisses it again. “Well, we weren’t exactly skiving off, but I see your point,” she says.
"Well, for him. Relatively speaking. You know how he is."
“This,” Ginny says, very calm, “is a sex potion? Do you need a sex potion to get off with me?”
to be an Auror, Harold?” It's been ages since she's called him that. There’s a sudden gentleness in her voice, and she puts a hand on his knee. It feels nice; it’s been a while since she’s touched him softly. Or not-softly, for that matter. A while since she's touched him at all. Across the room, James tries to pick up a sharp quill on the table and Ginny Accios it. He starts to cry in protest, so she gets to her feet with a groan and goes to pick him up.
“I like fierce,” Ginny tells it. “I

"Well, um," Potter begins, and trails off. He shoves a hand in the pocket of his suit. He's so attractive that Draco wants to punch him, or snog him, or both.
"There's something I've been meaning to ask you," he says, as he strokes her arm gently. He can't believe he's allowed to touch her, like this — but maybe he's not, after all, he thinks, when she stiffens at the question.
wrong. And yet, he can’t let it go.
“Maybe I just want to see you do it.” Malfoy says the words perfectly evenly, perfectly calmly, and suddenly Harry wants to ruffle him somehow. To interrupt that calm. To disconcert him.
a cruel voice whispers, and Harry locks it down. He would be fine. They would both be fine. No, all
Draco's been attracted to women for years, but he's never actually been with one in any meaningful way, except for one terrible night with Pansy in fifth year that ended with both of them in tears. They drank half a bottle of firewhiskey and never spoke of it again. He’d fared better with men after Hogwarts, in a period of just a few months with a few anonymous Muggles he’d pulled in gay bars in London. But waking up in strange beds in the middle of the night, questions about the “barmy tattoo” on his arm, one bloke enquiring about his childhood — it was all terrible, in different ways, and it became blindingly clear to Draco that the sex wasn’t worth it. These days, he takes care of himself alone, mechanically and clinically, whenever he needs to. It’s fine. Or it was, anyway. He doesn’t know what’s happening now.
"I’m surprised to see you, Harold. This isn't what I'd consider… you know. Your scene." Ginny winces inside. She hadn’t meant to use his old nickname, and this isn't what she wants to be saying to him.
Malfoy something nebulous and undefined.
you use Legilimency during sex, Potter? It’s so much better for yourself, not to mention your partner. Perhaps you wouldn't even need the potion.”
“Use words, Malfoy,” she orders him, and his cock jerks harder.
He rubs at his neck. "Er, sorry. I wasn't sure if you wanted me there," he says, suddenly conscious of the dirty room around him. He sits up straighter on the sofa and wonders if he could get away with a quick straightening charm, but she's already glancing around, taking in the whole sloppy scene.
"Oh," Draco says. A rogue firefly buzzes past his ear, and he flinches and bats it away. "Don't— don't feel bad. She’s fine. She was released from Azkaban last year and joined my father wherever he's hiding out. I've no clue where they are, because they know I'd turn him in if I did. We don't speak anymore."
He'd felt nothing but relief when Ron and Hermione, with their searching eyes and their own battle scars, left Britain a year ago. It’s easier to fake it when they’re just heads in a Floo, checking in, and they were smart not to return for this party. Good for them for giving themselves something new to fill the emptiness in their own heads. He knows he should do the same, but every time he tries to travel, even spend a single night away from Grimmauld, the nightmares get so bad that his shouting would wake up everyone in some quaint inn in the Lake District. He'd have to modify their memories before they went off and told the whole world that Harry Potter really had gone mad.
She leans over to kiss him again, the angle awkward and strange, and Harry is right there and it's suddenly a confusing tangle of bodies, the strap-on jostling uncomfortably, pressing hard against both her and Draco. There's an uncomfortable moment of repositioning when Ginny's not sure what's going on, but then she realises Harry's ducked down and Draco's arching his back wildly against her, almost losing the strap-on entirely.
“I thought you knew,” Harry says. The sinking feeling threatens to swallow him whole.
"Well, you know me. Once a coward, always a coward,” Malfoy remarks, avoiding Harry’s eyes. He moves to sit behind his desk again, heavily; he seems tired, worn out.
it, Ginny would always say, as though the words themselves were a fight.
Not like Harry.
When he finally returns with the fresh mugs, Malfoy has three vials of the potion on the small table next to him but doesn’t look like he’s moved an inch. He’s sitting quite still, with one of the little globes of light just in front of him. Harry watches from the doorway as Malfoy captures it gently in his hand, brings it up to his face to examine with an inscrutable expression, and releases it into the air again.
He glances over at the kitchen clock with one hand in London time and one on Sydney time. Hermione’d bought it for him before she and Ron left for Australia. They did Floo calls every week and they always sounded warm and happy, hopping about with dingoes, or whatever it was one did in Australia. Forgetting about the war, probably. Forgetting about him. Being happy, or happier, at least. He hopes they’re happier.
Now, instead of Fiendfyre and curselight, his nightmares are mostly about his children. They peaked when James went off to Hogwarts last autumn — Harry can’t believe how young he is, how small — but most of his worries, day and night, are about Al.
Then comes Al. The pregnancy is deliberate this time, so that the two kids would be close in age. They figured they could get all the nappies, and Ginny's time away from the team, out of the way at once. And, very quickly, there it is, another pink cross on the test. They still hadn't learned the diagnostic spells.
is he
,” Ginny says, and Harry nods along because it’s true, and because he hates this mediwitch just a bit, suddenly. “
Drawing his wand, Harry stumbles out of bed and bangs open the door.
"Sorry," he says again. Fuck, but she looks fit. The new hair suits her, and Harry sneaks a long look at her lanky body, at once familiar and enticing. Her broad, bony shoulders, her long neck, her breasts, her freckles. She's beautiful; he'd forgotten.
me already?”
And then there’s a sparkle of possibility, a glimmer on the words even though they’re not magic. Or maybe they are, Harry can’t be sure.
"Once again," Harry says, clearing his throat. "I'm right here." He's lying down with his back to them again, but his body is rigid and too still, a sure tell he's still on edge.
He clears his throat to try to make himself stop talking, but it doesn't work. "Yes, well. Her decision to live with my father as a fugitive rather than encouraging him to face up to his crimes doesn't sit well with me."
“I don’t have to,” Malfoy shoots back, lightning-quick as always. “Your motivations are clear as day, just from one look at your face. But I wouldn’t be allowed to use Legilimency, anyway, now would I?”
The elevator jerks upward again so hard that both of them nearly lose their balance, speeding upward far too fast, and Draco's whole body presses into Harry. He fists his hands in Harry’s hair and frots against him, almost like he can’t help it, can’t stop himself. It’s perfect, just the perfect friction in the perfect place, and then Harry’s coming in the bloody lift. It rushes over him like a wave, exploding in his body and his mind, and he gives a full-body shudder and grabs Draco and makes the most embarrassing moan right into his shoulder. His body goes slack and he, very seriously, considers Apparating directly to Antarctica or Siberia, or no wait, if he’s going to exile himself, maybe somewhere warm like or Fiji—
“Draco Malfoy.” Her voice shakes and then hardens. “Draco Malfoy gave you a
Desolation was in his blood. He knew it, now. He’d been a desolate
Draco pushes away slightly so he can see her. "You charmed
Draco makes one perfect sound, a note of surprise he can't seem to suppress, and suddenly Harry's dying to hear him make more. Already he can’t think straight, already can’t resist pressing himself down on Malfoy’s leg and grinding against him, just for a moment. Malfoy tightens his arms and jolts like he’s been shocked. His tongue is in Harry’s mouth, lightning fast like he thinks he’s sneaking something, and Harry moans himself, then— and he suddenly remembers Ginny.
And then they both reach for Draco's cock at once, stroking it hard together. Draco's head tips back onto Harry's shoulder — he's shaking, he's falling apart, and this is what Harry has wanted, has
“That was quick, Potter. You could have sent it by owl,” Malfoy says. He's playing it cool as ever, but Harry can tell by the way his eyes are fixed on the parchment that he wants it, badly. He's greedy for it, and that makes Harry not want to give it to him.
He’s still a bit sore from moving out of Grimmauld. He’d insisted on packing and hauling cardboard boxes himself — under a glamour, of course, because the bloody press would have had a bloody field day with "Harry Potter Abandons Grimmauld, Moves Into Muggle High-Rise, Probably Losing His Marbles, Is His Wizarding Life Over, More on Page 5!!!"
Harry thrills to this, something flares hot inside of him. Draco looks at him appraisingly.
“What a time for you to start listening. Seriously, at any point, I want you to tell me to stop if you don’t like it. Feedback, Malfoy. I want feedback. Okay?” she asks, relentless even in this. His cock jerks. “I want to hear you say whether it’s okay or not.”
He thrashes about in bed for who knows how long, until he hears a thumping that’s loud enough to break through his silencing charms. When he pulls down the charm with an angry wave of his hand, he realises his wards are chiming as well, urgently, and bloody hell, this is enough to wake up the dead, let alone his neighbours.
I’m not queer,” he says, leaning into the
He was a mean child, spiteful and rude, and Merlin knows he was mean as a teenager. As an adult, he’s mean because he knows he’s indefensible. There’s nowhere to hide; the world has seen the worst of him, and it won’t soon forget. Draco doesn’t get a second chance. He doesn’t believe he deserves one anyway.
“Never mind, Ginevra. But you should speak to a Mind Healer sometime, it’d do you good.”
Harry pushes off the bed and scours himself with a harsh cleaning charm, more than what he needs, and then sends the sheets flying off to the laundry. Molly probably saw them whoosh by, he realises too late, and the creeping feeling of disgust grows stronger. He wishes he had some tea, or better yet some whiskey, but now he doesn’t want to risk her seeing him Accio the bottle.
“Malfoy, you poncy arsehole. You heard me.”
“Hey,” he says, and his voice makes that stab of pain go deeper into her chest, somewhere she wanted to stay hidden from herself. She doesn't look at him and puts a canape on her plate instead. Egg and olive. Ginny hates olives.
Ginny is back at Hogwarts for her final year, and they start arguing immediately when she's home for the winter hols. After yet another fight in her bedroom, they agree to “see other people” and “give each other space” — phrases that feel like they’re borrowed too conveniently from someone else. Harry wonders who. And space… how can there be more space than Romania?
“I’m right.
, Ginny — just standing there, looking cool and distant and maybe slightly horrified, even though they'd just done what she asked. Harry's mind reels desperately, trying to think of something to make this less… whatever it is. To make her laugh. To remind her why she consented to this in the first place.
Ginny falls pregnant just before her twenty-second birthday. She’s tired, misses her period, and figures it out right away.
Ginny had shifted away. “Don’t. I want it there. I need it there,” she whispered, the first words she’d spoken in hours, and they hurt Harry’s heart, which was already full to overflowing. A sob escaped before he’d managed to put his hand over his mouth. He felt tears on his face, and he couldn't draw a breath. Panic rose in his throat.
"What do you call a dragon who's good at juggling?" He persists, always. Harry is nothing if not persistent.
"So, what's a dragon's favorite food?" he asks, and she's caught so off-guard that she looks at him properly for the first time. Fuck. She should know better. Why does Harry still, always, have to be so bloody hot? The thick, ink-black, shaggy hair. The dishevelled slouch that can't disguise the strong broad shoulders, jammed into an ill-fitting, all-wrong suit he can't be bothered to charm the wrinkles from. The sweet, earnest, tired eyes that beg for someone to take care of him, god
The dragon preserve is windy and freezing all the time. Perhaps sensing his unease and mistrust of his own body, the dragons refuse to be around him, unsettled and shifty, whipping their tails in his direction. They dislike him so much that the older handlers have to move him to menial chores. It's repetitive, exhausting, dirty work. It’s  made harder because the magical dampeners they need for the dragons mean most spells don’t work, so he does it all the Muggle way. Harry is reminded, often, of life with the Dursleys.
Still holding Malfoy’s gaze, Harry holds up his left palm and casually casts another, larger globe. He sends it toward the shaded lamp above Draco’s dining table, which lights up with a cosy, warm glow. And, for a final flourish, Harry points both hands down and moves his fingers as though he’s playing a piano, so that dozens of tiny round lights the size of Knuts flutter out and join the larger globes floating near the ceiling. A few of them bob toward Malfoy instead, nudging against him.
When Harry finally turns to see Ginny in the doorway, she's holding all seven vials of the Lover's Voice. His stomach drops. He wants to run, fall through the floor, sick up — but he’s trapped. He turns back to the dishes and starts scrubbing at a pot with rice stuck to the bottom. He’d cooked it too long.
, dutifully, because they’d gotten grimly drunk on a date night that Molly had forced them on. Ginny had fallen asleep before she took the contraceptive potion, but she was still nursing Al, after all, and she'd thought it wouldn't happen.
, I’m right. What a lot of good that does me.” She throws up her hands in frustration, and one of the vials slips and shatters extravagantly on the floor. “Merlin. Is that going to… hurt anything?”
, the report reads, drily.
"I have to get out of here," Harry blurts without thinking.
She impatiently knocks aside the strap-on, clumsy with desire, and gets tangled in the magical restraints.
Of course not, Harry realises. Former Death Eaters are still under severe restrictions. Tracers on their magic alert the authorities whenever they step an inch out of line. The restrictions are quite harsh — too harsh, some say, although Harry had always supported them. Malfoy would have to submit to the restrictions as well; there had been no exemptions for underage wizards, and no relaxing of the rules even though the war had been over for twenty years.
He's been doing so well, doing such a good job at never, ever, ever allowing Voldemort into his mind. He will not, he will
But the flat’s old, dingy and drafty — he can feel the chill seep in through the dodgy windows that don’t close tightly — and the hallways are dismal, with musty carpets and the smells of too many neighbours’ suppers all mixed together. The view and the lift are the only good things about it, really.
“No,” Harry says into the pillow, and pulls her tighter. He can feel her smile.
And Ginny — she felt better too, Harry thought. She must have. She smiled. She
Malfoy smirks, the arsehole, as though he’s enjoying himself. “Why
Harry manages to put James back down in his bassinet next to their bed without rousing him enough to yell for food, without waking Ginny. He creeps back out of the bedroom, mentally high-fiving himself, when, out of nowhere, a flash of the white blanket covering the pram near the door catches his eye. For one terrible, screeching moment, he’s transported to King’s Cross Station on the night of the battle. He's in that blinding white place, with its otherworldly sterility and preternatural calm. He has to brace his hand on the wall and squeeze his eyes tight.
“Your wards are as tight as a bloody fortress. Are you paranoid these days? What do you suppose would happen in this Muggle monstrosity you’ve moved into? Your neighbours must all think you’re just some rumpled student at uni with rich parents or something, living off a trust fund. They probably think you’re as rich as old Allie Gringott—“
“Is this how it’s going to be, then?” he asks mildly, as though it were an innocent question. He stares at her for a beat, impassive and unreadable, but then at last, after a long moment, eyes still locked on hers, he obeys. He walks forward and perches on the bed, fully clothed, staring at her expectantly.
“Oh, because you’re the picture of mental health,” she mumbles, and he snorts and lets her have the last word as sleep steals over them both.
After taking a Muggle test — she and Harry don’t know the diagnostic spells for pregnancy, and they certainly can't ask anyone — she comes out of the bathroom, eyes wide, and Harry knows without her saying a word. He gets up and reaches for her hands, but she won’t come close enough to touch him. So he just stands there. They’re just the same height, Harry thinks, inanely.
She takes great care with the fabrics, charming them plush and supple, making them feel expensive and rich against her body. Her mum hadn't known tailoring spells, or else just hadn't bothered with them, so growing up with ratty second-hand clothes made Ginny mad for fashion charms. And she wants to pull tonight, yes, but more than that. She wants everyone to
Harry plays a lot of video games during this strange period of isolation, and he wanks. He makes up for lost time, years of being too consumed by uncertainty and fear to ever learn his own body. He begins to figure out what he likes, where it feels good to touch himself, exactly how and what and why. Wizarding pornography is very, very good; moving images have many uses. It is an excellent way to make time go by faster, Harry finds. He wanks a lot.
And Draco gives him a nod. In the space of five minutes, he’s gone from not speaking to Potter in years to agreeing to a… a threesome — Draco’s mind can hardly form the word — with him and his ex.
On the night of their final fight, when it was well and truly over at last, when Ginny's heart was shredded in a way she swore she'd
Draco must recognise the signs. Without properly taking off Harry’s pants, he stumbles to his feet, lipstick smeared, hair a mess, wrecked and delicious.
Things go quickly, then, speeding up and a bit out of control. Harry kisses Malfoy some more, kisses him like he’s drowning and Malfoy is oxygen, rubs up against him, feels the length of him press up against his leg. Harry tangles his hands in that silky blond hair, pulling him in even harder, and Draco responds eagerly, still on his side, as Ginny preps him from behind. Her hand strays to Harry’s own hair a few times, stroking and tugging it lightly, and it feels so good that Harry’s eyes roll back in his head.
“Er, yeah.” Harry takes a breath. She’ll never believe him.
The next night, he got her off with his hand and his mouth, and he remembered more: the way her hands tightened into fists when she got close to coming, and how she’d always open her eyes right after, with a small, private smile that only sex ever brought out. It was bloody hot. He’d forgotten things he didn’t even realise he’d known, the shame pressing down on him. He’d forgotten.
“I’ll take 'er' as a compliment, then, Potter, since I know you're queer yourself. The whole world knows, after that exposé in the
Harry fists himself for a minute and then flips over, ruts against the mattress to get some more friction, unsatisfied with having nothing to shove into. He turns on his side and tries fucking into a pillow, but that’s worse, too soft, all wrong. He wishes he had some porn to get the images of Malfoy out of his head, but he doesn’t want to stop to find some; he’s frustrated and angry, he’s not sure at what.
“I’ve been thinking, since you showed up the other day, and now I know what I want as payment.”
She wouldn’t, or didn’t, cry at the funeral, and afterward he’d thought that maybe they could let themselves be softer with each other. Harry had sat between Ginny and Ron, and Ron had sobbed, so hard and so silently that Harry didn’t know at first what was shaking the bench. Harry had no idea what to do, although Hermione had put her arms around Ron so tenderly, had seemed to wrap up his gangly arms and pull in his sadness so effortlessly, that Harry’s heart still hurt from it.
story has always been a sore subject for a host of reasons — but to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy smiles. It's that sardonic twist, halfway to a smirk, that Harry hasn’t seen in years. It turns out he's missed it. His teenage self would be horrified at how happy that smile makes him, how it lifts his heart and sends an electric twinge through his body. Teenage Harry would be more horrified still at how much it makes him want to kiss Malfoy right here in the elevator, to crowd him up against the back wall, pin his wrists above his head, and snog him senseless.
, wants them both. Rather desperately, if he's honest.
“So soon? Gods, Potter, you’re gagging for it.”
“That’s funny.” She laughs harshly. “That’s hilarious, Harry. It certainly bloody
Hours later but still before midnight, Harry’s back in the lift. But this time, Malfoy’s crowding him against the rail, pressing the whole of his body against him. They haven’t kissed yet, their mouths just an inch apart, all hot breath and rosy cheeks, Draco’s cold hands rucking up under Harry’s shirt. Harry gives a yelp and Draco smiles, a small sweet smile just for him, and Harry grabs him tighter. He’s thrown off balance, then, fully pressed against Harry, and Harry can’t help himself moving his hips, reaching, rubbing against Draco’s leg where it’s pressed between his.
"I noticed you've got a new squid in the tank downstairs," he says, switching the roll of parchment to his other hand.
Harry is, by any measure, a good father. He knows this, can point to a decade's worth of things that demonstrate it. He has proven it, and himself, many times.
Ginny Floos to the Gala alone, early, having ignored the owls and texts from her brothers about Apparating over to the Muggle hotel together. She's grouchy and starving, so she stumbles out of the Floo unprepared for the extravagance of the room. It’s really quite grand, a soaring high ceiling, glowing midnight blue and shot through with moonlight and stars, and a central waterfall charmed to splash just so. Lush plants grow in every direction, with walkways winding through them like open forest paths and tables set into their own clearings. Flowers are everywhere. Dragonflies flit around, lighting occasionally on the greenery.
“What do you say we restart this thing? I assume your bed is a touch more comfortable than the lift floor.” His voice is rough and scratchy, which turns Harry on so instantly and completely that he doesn’t even realise
The look of horror on Ginny’s face would be funny if it wasn’t so genuine. Harry isn't sure whether it’s about flying, or being called “mum,” or both.
Motionless, trying not to shift her head even an inch, Ginny counts the years since the war. Seven. It feels like far more. The weak May sunlight finds its way under her quilt, and she squints at the curtains she'd charmed to block it out. She fumbles around for her wand, locates it under the pile of last night’s discarded clothes next to the bed, and casts a quick Tempus. Two in the afternoon. Maybe the charm doesn't work on afternoon light. Fuck.
“Er, flying, dear. Quidditch. Not forever!” she hastens to add. “Just for the duration of the pregnancy, that’s all. You don’t want baby to be jostled if you fall. Not to mention the bludgers—“
Harry nods miserably. “He’s a chemist.”
She cranes to see and catches one quick glimpse of Harry's mouth sliding around Draco's cock, Draco's hand lost in his black hair, and then Malfoy's coming with a shout, unexpected and loud. His head's thrown back, mouth wide open, with ragged, guttural breaths that seem caught at the base of his throat. Ginny kisses the hollow there, mouths at his neck and earlobes, marvels briefly at their delicacy, the overwhelming intimacy of it all. After a moment, she slides her hand down to his cock. She finds Harry's hand already there, and both of them work Draco gently together for a moment as he rides out the aftershocks, and this feels very, very new and strange. Their eyes meet, both a little stunned, and suddenly Ginny is so turned on that she can barely breathe.
"Two dragons," she says. "I know that one. And these are awful and you're an arsehole."
The baby is a girl, and the only one with a shock of red hair. They’d planned to name her Lily, but as soon as she's born, they switch immediately to the name Ginny had originally wanted: Ember. She's a spark, not a flower. Harry feels he owes Ginny this, at least.
!" The mirror pulls her own cord, causing the velvet curtain to fall down around her, still muttering as it swings closed.
Harry closes his eyes against this. He hadn’t anticipated that question, somehow, and Ginny is going to hate the answer. She has always loathed Malfoy, and used to accuse Harry of having an unhealthy obsession with him back in school.
Harry has no real idea what Romania looks like. But when he pictures it, he sees flat fields, mountains in the distance, a sort of endless, purple twilight where no one talks to him and he can be alone as much as he wants. That's all he wants, now.
There are several long minutes of this, of incremental buildup getting faster and more heated. Harry thinks, wildly, that he must be drunk, that he’s imagining all of this somehow, as Malfoy’s small noises get louder and longer and start to become gasps and sobs. Ginny stops to ask Draco if he feels good, several times, and he says yes with increasingly less control each time, eventually getting to “yes, oh, fuck, please” with his head thrown back and his long white throat exposed. He clamps his top leg over Harry's, sometimes, pressing and clenching; that alone nearly makes Harry come. He pulls Draco tighter and tighter to him, their cocks rubbing together, and feels whatever Ginny's doing behind Malfoy echo through his body as well.
Malfoy’s gaze follows it and then he looks up sharply. "It's an octopus. A miniature one. She’s an arsehole, she’s eating all the fish," he says, and Harry can't think of another way to stall — or even a reason why he should — so he hands over the scroll.
"Sorry. I wasn't about to spill it on you or anything," Harry says. He's not sure why he's offended. He's not sure why he's feeling any of the millions of things he seems to be feeling right now.
"I wasn't sure, either," Ginny says, walking toward him. "But it turns out I did." He sees her eye a piece of half-eaten toast with marmalade on a paper towel on the coffee table, an empty fish and chips box, the menu from the pizza shop nearby. Three cups of cold tea plus one open bottle of ale from last night. There are wires and game controllers everywhere; there's a sock on the floor that he'd used to clean himself up with, earlier.
“No, it was fine. Brilliant, really. Perfect.”
“Very original, Ginevra.” Draco decides not to clap back — he’s not sure it’s in him, right now, in this swirling froth of emotion. “How lovely of you to bring my parents into this.”
, of all things, but he wonders if his brain is simply incapable of thinking about Malfoy’s body beneath them. His actual, physical body, that’s directly in front of Harry.
," Harry argues. Desperation is colouring his tone, just a bit, and he hopes Malfoy doesn't notice.
"Hot wings."
, he tells himself.
"Come on, you git, just ask me for something. Something
“Potter,” Malfoy says, from what feels like a thousand yards away. “I don’t know where you’ve gone just now, and I know you’re an exceptionally busy and important person, but if you manage to find a free moment, I believe we have some matters to attend to.”
“Is this good?” Ginny’s asking, her familiar voice somewhere far away.
Harry’s nodding. “You’re right.”
Harry thinks he might sick up. He closes his eyes.
.” He spits the final words, his sneer just the same as it’s always been.
"So this is a social call? How nice of you to drop by."
There’s a good lift in Harry’s new building. A proper old-fashioned one that rattles and clinks and chimes, and has a needle that ticks off how high you rise. It’s the best thing about the whole place; the flat itself is fairly awful, despite the steep rent.
Still, he has no answer.
. Her razor-sharp edges and simmering temper got softer. Harry wanted to do this for her, wanted to make her smile. Ginny was fire and ebullience, quick wit. She was flash and confident and sure. She wasn’t meant to be desolate.
Then, slowly, deliberately, she leans over and kisses Harry. He tastes the same as he always has, and her body responds the way it always has, too. It hums with recognition, with
“Mm, hi,” she whispers, and cards her fingers through his hair. “Are you awake?”
She hates breastfeeding, even though she tells Harry she’s not supposed to hate it. He'd had no idea infants needed to be fed every few hours. And he had no idea how quickly and also how slowly those hours could go by, nor how much he'd wish he could feed James himself. He secretly wants her to stop, and asks her why she doesn't.
Harry goes home that night to find Molly in his sitting room, knitting and listening to the Wireless. Ginny’s gone to the pub with friends, Molly tells him, accepted a last-minute invitation, and he ignores her frown of disapproval when he declines her suggestion to meet Ginny and skives off to the bedroom instead. Molly’s always worn her feelings on her sleeve, and Harry can’t help but see that she disapproves of the distance she knows is growing between them.
. How long have you known?”
Ginny had wanted it too, surprise and pleasure in her voice when Harry had initiated things. He’d deliberately come to bed when he knew she was still awake — something he rarely did — and had stripped off his jeans and sidled next to her under the quilts. He’d been playing with her hair, rubbing his thumb along the shaved part, and she’d looked him dead in the eye with one eyebrow cocked. He smiled, embarrassed — he was already hard, she could see his pants — and then she sat straight up and threw her leg over him, calmly took off his glasses and set them on the nightstand, and leaned down for a proper kiss. Eventually, they’d fucked just like that: him on his back and her on top with her back arched and her head thrown back, almost like there was wind in her hair, almost like she was flying.
"Two."
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Why are you always making me repeat myself? Every conversation with you happens twice. I would like. An exception. To the Legilimency statute. For
"Brilliant," Harry gasps, without even thinking. His hand is still clamped around Draco’s cock and they’re all thrusting so hard, it’s shaking the bed, slamming the headboard inelegantly against the wall. Harry aims a palm up and casts a silencing charm, and the whole room falls into a hush, and Ginny and Draco’s intensity ups another notch simultaneously.
“Come on, then,” Harry says, low and quiet. There’s no shake to his voice. He’s certain, even though he’s not sure what exactly he’s goading Malfoy into. Harry doesn’t know when he’d switched from vague fantasies to outright wanting — to wanting
do, then?” she asks, angry, and he has no answer. She props herself up on her elbows, her hair falling like curtains around her face. Her shape is indistinct in the dim light but her eyes, like always, are on fire. They gleam in accusation.
“Well, you never fucking thought to ask about them before, did you?” she snaps. He had once, actually, in the very beginning, but he thinks it unwise to bring that up. Ginny’d said she was taking care of it, and once again, he’d been relieved not to shoulder that responsibility. But now she’s looking at him with a different kind of fire in her eyes.
During the birth, the cruel voice shows up only once.
.” This time, he definitely sneers the last word.
“Enough with the sarcasm, Malfoy. I just— what do you need to use Legilimency for?”
Malfoy makes a sarcastic sound of agreement, low in his throat. "Ditto," he says softly, regret colouring his voice. Harry feels the back of his throat tighten; this is too much, suddenly, these old feelings along with the unfamiliar ones, too many emotions rushing at him and cutting through his usual just-getting-by fog too sharply.
He clears his throat awkwardly. “I was just wondering where you’d found the lovely corset you’re wearing tonight. Was it Lesbians R Us?”
"Ah, I see. Trauma shorthand," Draco says lightly as he helps arrange the blankets over Harry's shoulder. She notices as Draco smoothes it down carefully, lingers just a little on Harry's skin.
“How do you—“
“Different people see it differently,” Malfoy says blandly, and Harry wonders what sorts of charms he’s layered over the place.
Ginny cups the back of his head gently and looks into his eyes. “You’re telling me you truly
, it tells him, but he shoves it aside the way he always does and then there’s a baby, a tiny thing with a shock of wet black hair and dusky skin like his own, like his own father’s.
“Why do you want that?”
"Breathe," Ginny says, and she feels all three of them draw in a breath at once, separate and together.
it," Malfoy whispers, the moment they both come back to themselves. Harry has to lean over and put his hands on his knees. They’re both breathing hard, as though they've run a good distance.
“Sit on the bed,” she orders, taken aback by the harshness of her own voice. He and Harry, both still hovering near the door, stare back at her. They're nervous. Good.
Instead, he decides to call it a night, cleans his teeth, comes back to bed and pulls up the comforter over himself. He won’t allow himself to cast a Tempus charm; he knows it’s ridiculously early.
He does more; it's like sending a beam of light to the thought, then the tense and release. Silently, without moving, he Accios two fancy wrapped chocolates from the table and places them on the pillows — then glances over at Draco and quickly adds a third, right in the middle.
When Harry wakes up, he panics.
Although his mind may be overwhelmed to the point of distraction, Harry’s cock is paying close attention. Draco’s teasing it, using his hand and his tongue, stroking and licking, enveloping it in his mouth for a tantalising moment and then pulling back to tease again. Harry’s hips buck again, harder this time, and Draco has to reach up for the bar to brace himself.
The tables are spread with a feast of tiny food: miniature pastries and finger sandwiches, bite-sized canapes, tartlets with bacon and onion jam, tiers of candied kumquats charmed to hover like Snitches around a dark chocolate fountain. She sets down her tiny clutch — with several extension charms; nothing can fit in those tiny bags — and takes a delicate china plate from a tall stack.
her. As she is now, in control of herself. Not a child, not just a younger sister, not a sad, small girl to be pitied and worried over and rescued. No longer a pawn in Harry’s game — although, to be fair, Harry was a greater pawn than she was, and it hadn’t ever been his game. At least he won't be there tonight, though. He avoids events like this as though it's his job.
“What do
Now it’s Harry’s turn to roll his eyes, but he finds he’s eager to go into Malfoy’s kitchen. It’s brighter than the sitting room, the walls a cheerful yellow and the hob new and gleaming. There’s some sort of fancy coffee contraption on the counter, with a half-full carafe under a stasis charm. Harry pours it into the mugs slowly, replacing it more carefully than he needs to. He runs his hand over its handle, the surface of the counter, the nubbly fabric seats of the tall bar stools tucked beneath the counter. Without quite knowing why, Harry touches half a dozen more surfaces in Malfoy’s kitchen, thinking about what it must feel like to live here, to thoughtlessly run his hands over all of it daily, the way Malfoy must do. He feels calmer here, somehow, than he does in his own kitchen.
, you self-centered git." Suddenly Malfoy is very interested in his coffee, staring down at it fixedly. He's not making eye contact, Harry realises. Is he embarrassed?
Harry, unthinking, throws his head back and it hits the wall, and the jolt of pain somehow goes straight to his cock, and fuck, this was about to be over far too soon.
“Come off it, Malfoy.” Harry feels even hotter, and he has to stop himself from swiping at his brow and tugging his tie looser. It’s far too warm in the office. “Just tell me what the potion bloody costs.”
Malfoy startles when Harry moves toward him. And when Harry hands him his mug and their hands brush, he startles even more, jerking backwards. All the lights flare briefly, still glowing around the room.
“You love to see it,” he says back, grinning back at her.
He asks, barely coherently, whether she wants to end the pregnancy. He can’t read her face at all, but she shakes her head once, hard. He drops it, relieved again. She hates him a bit, just then, and resents him too, and he knows it.
At first, all they do is panic. Summer had given Ginny a break from the Centaurs’ brutal travel schedule, but she’d still been flying every day, sometimes with her teammates in light off-season training — “light” for them was still four hours a day — and she’d been knocked off her broom half a dozen times in the past few weeks. There, in the bedroom, she begins listing all her pregnancy transgressions: she’d smoked Gillyweed with Ron twice; she’d drunk goblin wine and followed it with a hangover potion the next morning; she’d taken Dreamless one night when she couldn’t sleep; she’d eaten a whole list of foods she wasn’t supposed to. Harry has never even heard of half the precautions on the unbelievable list Ginny seems to already have in her head. Asking himself his eternal question —
“Four,” Harry answers, and Malfoy smiles and shakes his head, making his hair swing back and forth slightly.
“Yes, I agree that would be best,” Malfoy answers immediately, entirely too smooth.
Draco has seen Potter around, of course, from a distance. It’s impossible not to see him. Sometimes he seems to be everywhere — in the corridors at work, in the Ministry cafeteria, in the papers, in the bloody air. But this gala is the last place he would have guessed Potter would be, and Draco does a lot of guessing to try to stay out of his path.
They haven’t interacted in any meaningful way in the years since Draco’s trial, easily the worst day of his life, and there was stiff competition for that title. Potter had spoken on behalf of both himself and his mother, but the Wizengamot granted clemency only to Draco.
? Out of ordinary things you had laying around your flat?"
Harry thought he'd have to force himself to reach for the jar, but he realises he actually wants it quite a lot. When he picks it up, it's warm to the touch and heavier than it looks. He stands quickly and moves toward the door; suddenly, he very much wants to leave.
But she doesn't allow herself to linger with Harry either. Breaking away, she steps back.
“I don’t always trade in Galleons. Not usually, in fact. The goblins get suspicious whenever one of the pureblood accounts exceeds a certain number.” Another restriction Harry had forgotten. Malfoy purses his lips and stares steadily at Harry across the desk. “My potions business is considered trade-in-kind. Completely legal. Encouraged, even, from a Ministry standpoint.”
shite, always have been. He flips two fingers at Malfoy, who smiles likes he’s relieved.
“That’s basically the definition of blackmail,” Harry says, but Malfoy continues as though he hadn’t spoken.
She laughs softly again and pushes him back, closing her eyes and leaning against him. "Don't be ridiculous, it's just a stupid hobby. I like the way clothes keep me covered up. Safe. Separate."
“Er…” Harry trails off again. The earring is, in fact, very gay, in the way of an ‘80s pop star or an ironic glam hipster.
When Harry Vanishes his own awful suit jacket, Draco sees an opening. He forces himself to speak before his fear and uncertainty take over completely.
fierce.”
He stands back to admire his work — Harry looks down to see himself suddenly sporting a tight black t-shirt, even tighter black trousers, a leather jacket full of buckles that don’t even seem to close; is this what Malfoy would have him wear?! — and finishes with a sharp cleaning charm right to Harry’s face, his teeth and cheeks getting a harsh invisible scrub and his hair rearranging itself into some poncy fauxhawk sticking straight off his head. Harry reaches up and touches it gingerly. Is that what hair gel feels like?
But he’s disappointed. Once they’re through the potions lab, it’s an ordinary flat, not at all what he’d envisioned for the posh boy he’d known in school. Just a plain sitting room and a kitchen, mapped out with extension charms, and presumably a bedroom on the other side. Hundreds of books line the walls, but there’s not a single photo.
“But you'd be so pretty if you'd just—"
“What would you suggest
While he’s droning on, Draco manages to give Harry a cool, appraising glance and he’s suddenly aware of his rumpled hair and sweaty pyjamas. When was the last time he’d washed this ancient t-shirt properly? He’d Vanished salsa off it after breakfast today, but that hardly counted. And here’s Malfoy dressed to the nines, a peacoat that nips in tight at the waist and tight jeans and— is that makeup he’s got on?
Draco’s neutral expression matches the decor. He snaps his fingers — the first magic Harry's seen here — and a small, flat-bottomed jar flies from the doorway into Malfoy's outstretched palm. He places it on the bare desk and slides it toward Harry. Inside the jar, the potion is a thick dark purple, almost black, and it churns and roils of its own accord. It looks menacing, or else Harry’s just projecting.
“What’s up with the door? Since when do I need an Alohomora to get into my own bedroom?” She stops abruptly when she sees the lights off and Harry laid out on the bed.
"Sorry I don't live up to your fashion standards," Harry says, smiling too while he Vanishes most of his clothes and then his socks, which he'd forgotten in the first go, and then does a little spin as he stands before them in black boxer-briefs.
They’d both tried to lose their virginity right in this spot, on the same sheets and in the same murky darkness the night after Fred’s funeral. Was that three days ago? Four? Harry’s lost count. He can’t stop thinking about that night, though, and it begins to replay itself in his mind as he lies back, blinking at the ceiling, trying and failing to draw a deep breath.
time, then, wherever you're off to! Let’s see what sorts of witches and wizards you attract going around all tarted up like
He makes himself wait a full day before he brings it to Malfoy’s office, early in the morning on a Saturday when Ginny’s taken Ember to an overnight Quidditch tournament. He’s rewarded with Malfoy opening the door in a t-shirt. Harry’s never seen him in one before; its worn, heather-grey fabric stretches over Malfoy’s surprisingly broad shoulders and then falls softly over the rest of his torso. He’s got joggers on, too, old ones slung low on his hips, and Harry can’t help his eyes travelling down to—
Ginny shakes her head to rid herself of him, again, still, always, and yanks open the cord to her old-fashioned mirror on her bedroom wall. She cycles through several earrings and settles on tiny, sharp platinum spikes all the way up the side, a nod to punk, and then adds a tiny nose stud to match. She considers adding a septum piercing and decides against it, then smiles wickedly at herself.
Harry decides — too fast, in retrospect — that he has to get a job, and he applies to the Auror training program. His Mind Healer cautions him about this line of work, citing his complicated relationship to authority figures and the stress of investigative work. Ginny comes out firmly against it, even after the Ministry owls to say they're delighted and offers to fast-track him, cut short his training period, and allow him onto the regular force almost immediately.
Draco surveys the elaborate room from a strategically chosen corner. He'd dressed carefully tonight. His black tuxedo — silk, even though it’s sweltering out; this suit is the only good one he's got — and a pale pink pocket square with a matching bow tie, plus cufflinks he'd bought from a pawn shop and carefully, superstitiously, checked to make sure they didn't have a trace of Dark magic on them. The last pair he'd inherited from his father had been charmed with something he'd rather not remember. After he’d discovered it, during his ill-fated attempt to return to school to redo his disastrous Seventh Year, he’d run down to the lake in the middle of the night, sobbing, and chucked the cufflinks in. He'd only lasted six days at Hogwarts.
“The boss is on a roll,” he mutters drily, and Harry doesn’t have time to ask what the hell that means before the door closes with a final click and he’s alone in the hall, again.
“And do you
of here."
“Merlin, Potter, were you asleep already?” Malfoy’s brushing past him into the flat before Harry even has a chance to move aside. He’s brought with him the smell of the cold outside air, far more crisp and lovely than Harry remembered it being earlier.
And James brings so much happiness, too, and not in the moments Harry had expected it — not in the milestones of first steps, or first words, or touching a Snitch for the first time. Not really. It's more that there’s so much mundane happiness, like how brilliant it is when a baby grabs your finger and holds it, just a reflex but also a claim.
He closes his eyes against the words. “Gin. I can’t— I can’t stay here. I have to get out of here,” he says, although he doesn’t move. ‘Here’ means this bed, this room, yes, but also the Burrow, Devon, the whole of bloody England. He’d like to get out of his own skin, if possible, to tear away his body somehow and flee. This urge to run is new to him — he thought he was a stand-and-fight kind of person, but who knows, now — and it’s so strong, it’s overwhelming. Maybe the brave and stubborn part of him was Voldemort in his head. Maybe he’s used up all his courage and he’s a coward now.
Reaching over Draco, who's shoving messy hair out of his eyes and breathing hard, Harry slides two expert fingers inside her just the way he knows she likes it. He leans over to kiss the base of her throat, and she can’t stop herself moaning. There’s a different kind of magic to this, her first, someone she had loved since childhood, back inside her again — but she's so very different now, having had more partners, more experience, more of life of her own. Ginny doesn’t want him back, she knows that, but her body understands and responds to his presence like he’s patterned out in her very bones.
“I’m not sure I meant it as a compliment, dear,” the mirror worries, in a querulous, fussy voice that's both annoying and comforting at once.
"If we feed him formula, I could give him a bottle too, yeah? What's the big deal?" Harry knows how wrong this is, particularly that last bit, before the words are even out of his mouth. Ginny looks at him, fury in her eyes again.
“Yes,” he says. “I think he might be—”
And then, on accident and far too soon, comes another pregnancy. Ginny cries when she finds out — they’d had sex
Ginny pads barefoot to the loo and then the kitchen, where she gulps down two glasses of water. She puts on some music — Muggle punk, loud and angry; no more Weird Sisters for her — and spends the next few hours attending to her appearance. She’d learned to enjoy this part. The preparation, the tending to her armour.
But Ginny curls into him, stretches against him, like… like nothing he has words for, he realises. Like nothing he’s known. She wants him to stay, he thinks.
like to hear you beg, as it turns out.”
his voice sounds that way, doesn’t even connect it to his dick roughing up the back of Draco’s throat, until he’s replaying this moment in his head days later.
Ginny learned how not to speak. How to stay silent, when it counted.
“Well, it’s not as though you had your pick of any job you wanted, now, is it?” Yet more restrictions — after the war, former Death Eaters were forbidden from dozens of professions and career paths, anything that would allow them to amass too much power or gold. Harry has supported these restrictions too, as a rule, but as usual, he’s thrown by the twists and turns of their conversation. Maybe the restrictions hadn’t been reasonable and even-handed, after all. Maybe they were unfair. And fuck, why is he defending Malfoy to himself, now?
Of course.
“It's all right," Draco says. "It’s not... I've heard worse."
gave you. Fuck. I am a fucking
Harry looks at him skeptically; he’s not sure, actually, whether he can create an exemption for Malfoy.
“Honestly — why don’t you have a normal job, Malfoy?” Harry asks, after clearing his throat half a dozen times. “There’s plenty of potions work you’d be allowed to do. Are you still doing some kind of fucked-up penance for the War?”
, as though the feel of his mouth against hers is programmed into her DNA.
Acquiring the waiver to the Legilimency restriction was dead easy — Harry had simply requested it at the Magical Enforcement Unit and some clerk had given it to him without asking why, or even really looking him in the eye. Harry signed it himself and registered a copy with the Ministry. That was it.
Harry’s silent for a moment, and Malfoy seems to gather himself. “I don’t need to guess why you’re here, I suppose?”
Ginny had left her parents and moved out of the Burrow as soon as she could, right after finishing that terrible seventh year in a ruined castle full of other traumatised students who all avoided her anyway. She'd been accepted to Muggle uni (after Confunding some admissions officer who'd wanted information about her "transcript," as though Hogwarts had prepared whatever that was). She found her own cheap student flat near campus, bartending and working at a coffee shop to make rent. Her own space meant escape; she got to wake up in the morning without the weight of anyone else's expectations or grief or
Eventually, he forces himself back inside, back to Ginny's room, but her bed is empty. He spends the whole night staring at the ceiling and doesn’t see her until just before he steps into the Floo the next morning. Molly is in tears next to him. Arthur looks like he's in physical pain. Even Charlie, his own bag packed and slung over his shoulder, seems a bit wobbly, but Harry doesn’t cry. He won't cry again for months, maybe years. Ginny stands with the rest of the family and stares straight ahead, past Harry as though she’s already looking into the future. The fire in her eyes is the last thing he sees before he steps into the green flames.
“No. I don’t know. Probably not,” Harry says. He reaches for his wand to cast a cleaning charm, but she levels him with a glance.
Malfoy snorts. It’s slightly obscene, not something he’d have done when Harry knew him. “Didn’t your ‘friend’ tell you?”
"See you soon," Malfoy says as the door is swinging shut, and already Harry knows he’s right. He doesn't look back.
He hustles them all into the elevator before the hotel worker can assemble a complete picture of what's going on here and notify the
“You arsehole,” she mutters. She smiles just a bit bigger, but it's all he needs. Her skin is glowing in the candlelight.
— he falls silent, and his silence seems to enrage Ginny even more.
After she was gone, he sat down in front of his huge window and leaned his head against the glass. He ate the entire tart with a fork, straight from the pan, and then watched the sky grow dark and the city lights come on. He could see the bridges, out over the river. Being this high up makes him feel like maybe he’d want to fly again. Maybe. Someday.
“No, I don’t think so,” Ginny murmurs, standing back to examine herself. Fuck, she looks fit.
“I try,” she says calmly, adjusting a buckle on her leg somewhere. Draco’s not sure; once again, he can’t manage to tear his eyes from Harry.
Draco's between them, now, their warmth on either side of him, and his mind is racing the way it always threatens to with both of their bodies this near him, and he's got no idea what—
Harry’s traitor mind offers that unhelpful thought, before the rest of his brain can catch up and tamp it back down to wherever it came from. The heat’s up too high in the flat, blasting and dry, and Harry swallows hard.
“Perhaps I want you to serve as my footstool for the day,” he says, considering, and a strange shiver rushes through Harry that he doesn’t have time to examine just now.
survive.
He’s never understood why Ginny got off on this, but he's more than willing to keep going. He barely needs to move a muscle, just a slight tensing around his eyes and the tilting of his palms, and he can make his magic obey him.
“But there are so many other jobs,” Ginny says. “Less dangerous, less… I don’t know,
He looks at Harry from behind the desk impassively and snaps his fingers. Another vial of the dark purple potion sails neatly onto the desk in front of him. Harry wants it; he can almost feel the goodwill bubbling inside it. The lightness. The promise of sex.
Was it Harry’s imagination or did Malfoy’s voice twist just a bit on the word “straight”?
, all blazing eyes and hard angles? Harry wonders if it's connected to that suit she’s wearing, with the weird little cage underneath. All hard and pointy, with a zipper right there that he just wants to yank down, immediately, even when she's being so frightening and bossy. What the fuck is that thing, even, it looks like it was made by exceptionally cruel elves, and how—
She broke it off with Harry around then, too. He couldn't bring himself to tell her he was bi, even though she'd already told him the same about herself, and even though it was blindingly apparent to both of them. Merlin, he couldn't even bring himself to meet her eyes, back then. And he’d been too much of a coward — yes, Harry Potter, the bravest of them all, an utter coward — to admit he'd always wanted the idea of her more than the reality.
He looks Harry up and down coolly and continues. “You’re a wreck, Potter. As per usual. Come back and I’ll get you a coffee too. But if you betray me to these godforsaken Muggles, so help me Merlin, I will hex you halfway to Cornwall.”
Harry tries to make himself wait until the end of the day but only makes it to half-three before he gathers his things, walks to the communal Apparition point, and selects a spot closest to Malfoy's lab. As he hurries up the nondescript grey street, lined with office buildings that all somehow seem empty, he feels his face growing hot despite the spring wind and the warm drizzle. Which is ridiculous. He’s nothing to be embarrassed about, nothing at all. He hasn’t seen Draco Malfoy in years — not since they’d run into each other once, around Christmastime, shopping on Diagon. They'd been perfectly civil. And after the Fiendfyre, Draco owes him a life-debt after all, doesn’t he?
She does want to end this pregnancy. The arguments they have over it are terrifyingly long, and he wonders if perhaps this will be the thing that ends their marriage. She accuses Harry of letting his fucked-up childhood dictate their lives. He’s not sure she’s wrong. In fact, he’s quite sure
“What?” Harry’s own voice sounds loud and stupid in his head. A strange disappointment settles over him. This wasn’t what he’d hoped Malfoy would ask for, he realises.
"Fuck," Draco repeats, breathless from laughter. "You'd better get me off too before that thing comes back to get its revenge.” He kisses Harry properly, hard, and Harry kisses back, and that’s where the new year finds them.
“Great. Lucky me,” Harry says sarcastically. “What do I owe you, then?”
Ginny, determinedly facing the elevator doors, clears her throat with a growl — that
Harry’s breathlessly happy that day. Getting married is brilliant; Ginny is brilliant. He can’t tell if he’s thrilled or terrified or both, but it feels normal, somehow. Arthur assures him that a young father is supposed to be terrified, and Harry clings to those words.
"No, I mean, I need to get back—"
Growing up as his and Ginny’s kids hasn't been easy. They're constantly scrutinised by the media and their peers. Harry's hexed more than one photographer, and he's
“Gods, you’re the worst liar. It’s almost fun to watch you squirm. What’s this stuff really?”
"Scale of one through ten," she explains to Draco, still sandwiched in the middle, as she pulls the bedclothes back over Harry. Her heart gives a familiar little lurch; caring for him always feels like this, tentative and tender, necessary as oxygen. "One is a beach holiday; ten is Voldemort coming back to finish the job. Harry's two is a 397 for most people."
She pulls away, and as he stumbles to his feet, he catches a glimpse of Harry’s face. There's an expression Draco's never seen before — a look of pure lust, his eyes burning dark.
this. Running on pure instinct, Harry flips himself over so that he's face down on the bed, his face smashed into the pillow. He raises his hips and then grinds back down into the bed, feeling Draco—
"I know, I know," she says, cracking one eye open and holding out her hand to him. "And it's too far away, and you're starkers, so come back to bed."
you fucking bastard!” Harry says, as soon as he has enough breath back. “You had no right, I can't believe you—"
“Why are you so paranoid?" Harry asks.
"Ugh," he hears Malfoy say, as if from far away. "The Dark Lord, really? Can't we talk about something more pleasant?" and the images begin churning inside his head again, like an eddying whirlpool. A different one rears up from the swirl — the mental picture Harry had conjured when he was wanking the other night: Malfoy spread out beneath him, naked and wanton, flushed, writhing beneath him, and Harry working his own cock while he sucked Malfoy off. He could also see himself, somehow, his eyes squeezed shut and two fingers in his mouth, pretending they were Malfoy, pretending they were Malfoy's cock.
aching, wanting so badly to be touched.
Draco’s always been mean.
Harry’s back again a few days later. He tells himself he wants more potion — he and Ginny had slept together again, but something felt off this time, less like fun and more like work — but the issue of payment is what’s really nagging at him. He doesn’t like how opaque it is, doesn’t like
“Oh piss off, Potter, of course I’ve heard of it. I
"Where did you even learn these?"
This, Harry thinks, is truly magic.
They look good there. Obedient. Ginny gathers her courage, gathers her anger. She slips off one shoe and then the other, leaving them in a little pile in the corner of the room; the thick carpeting is cool and lush on her bare feet, and she sinks into it as she walks over to give Malfoy a decisive, almost perfunctory, kiss on the lips. She tastes something sharp and strange there, gin and juniper berries and desperation, and she doesn't linger long enough to see whether he kisses back.
looking straight at Potter.
“I’m meant to go back to school and pretend nothing’s happened?" she continues. "Is there even a school to go back to? Are the professors… ?”
? And then you
“What, too soon?" Ginny asks coolly. She's practically tapping her watch, and Merlin’s beard, when did she begin to look like
She could manage it with everyone but her mum. Molly — well, she didn't want to talk about Molly, either.
His pause is long enough for Malfoy to decide he’s bringing Harry along, apparently, and he’s suddenly caught in a rush of magic. With his standard look of distaste back on his face, Malfoy hits Harry with an
“Well done, you show-off. Why don’t you refill our coffees, too? The Muggle way, this time.”
"I’m whatever I want, Potter, and it’s no business of yours,” Malfoy snaps, seemingly before he can help himself. Almost in apology, he grudgingly adds, “I prefer potioneer, but yes, I suppose 'chemist' is accurate as well.”
Ginny’s already glowering before the mediwitch adds, “Oh, and no more flying, Mum!”
For weeks, Harry tries desperately to make it okay for Ginny. They'd both said before that they wanted kids, at least in the abstract. At least two, so the first one would have a sibling. "Two's plenty as long as neither of them turns out like Percy," she grimaced, and he'd laughed.
“You too,” she says to Harry abruptly, and he jumps as though he’s been shocked. He’d been standing there frozen, his eyebrows raised. But then he walks forward, slowly, and sits down next to Malfoy.
“Er, thanks, Malfoy,” he says, suddenly desperate not to leave. He lingers, too close, for just a moment, and Malfoy puts an oddly gentle hand on his back, ushering him out.
Pegging Malfoy, it turns out, makes her favourite thing even better.
of him —
Two hours later, Ginny’s had an exam and the brisk, too-sunny mediwitch is snapping off a glove.
"Harold," she says, brushing soot from her jumper. She's cut her hair very short and sleek, cropped close to her head. It looks good, Harry thinks. "You didn't come to the match." It had been her first one starting as the team's Seeker, and the whole family had gone.
"I’m sure that’s hard for her," Potter says neutrally, carefully. These seem like waters he's navigated before, and somehow that makes Draco want to tell him more.
"Ah, personal business. You’re here for a potion, then?"
“I live here as well. In the back.”
be okay.
that you saved the entire wizarding world from certain destruction a few years ago. Doesn't that count as 'engaging with the community'?" He laughs more genuinely this time, and that hurts her too, somehow, and it's worse. He uses her pause to change the subject.
“It wasn’t on my
She huffs out a little laugh and relaxes back into him. "I just Transfigured some stuff, and charmed it all. No big deal," she says.
A few weeks in, the press figures out where Harry is, and he's sure they're going to tell him to bugger off. Instead, they double down and relocate the whole preserve because of him, which almost makes him feel worse. They have to set up different and more complicated concealment charms in the new location. It’s harder to get in and out. Veterinarians and suppliers and handlers coming back from holiday can’t find the preserve, and they have to set up a new, complex portkey system. He can't look the other handlers in the eye for weeks.
Meanwhile, Malfoy is still talking. “—another reason you ought to come out with me tonight. There’s a whole world out there, Potter. There are better ways of forgetting than pulling a blanket over your head.”
Malfoy raises his eyebrows and Harry feels a small glimmer of satisfaction. “I see. How about you just change my lightbulbs, then?”
“No, I won’t be accepting money from you. I set my own payments, and your payment, Auror Potter, is one favour. From the
Malfoy sighs as though Harry's the most tiresome person he's ever been forced to have a conversation with. "You’ve never heard of being touch-starved?"
And Harry knows they’re avoiding things, knows it by the way they never talk about the sex — or about anything else, really — but they both want it, especially whenever it’s hot and desperate and wrong, but fuck it,
Now Draco’s got no choice but to soldier on and try to ignore the wicked heat rising in him — abject embarrassment, panic, arousal. He forces himself to focus on Ginny. Her unbelievable suit would be totally lost on Potter, of course, not to mention the brutally beautiful corset. The boning is outlined in silver, either made of metal or charmed to make it look so, glinting against the fabric and hinting at harsh metal biting into soft flesh, and what the ever-loving fuck is wrong with him, fantasizing about Ginevra Weasley like this? He'd always been curious about her, of course, and he'd spent truly embarrassing amounts of time fantasising about her and Potter's sex life for the better part of a decade.
Why the Ministry wastes its money commemorating the war this way, Ginny will never understand. She'd spent most of the battle of Hogwarts fumbling through dark hallways, firing curses she barely knew, certain she was about to die, choking on smoke and terror. Now, she watches a fairy and a hummingbird race through a miniature garden. Never forget, they say. As if she could.
"I knew it. I
“Hello in there, Malfoy? Is that all right?" Ginny asks again.
"Yes, well. It's, ah, nice of you to be decent about it, Potter." Draco is caught completely on his back foot. This is not the conversation he wants to be having; he wants an edge, somehow, and wants desperately
But Harry is good in a crisis. He’s good when it counts. His instincts kick in, and he remembers the rhythm of this now — of presenting bravery in the face of fear — and he tries all the techniques they’d learned beforehand. His hands on her back, her hips. Cooling spells for her forehead. A spell to make the bed firmer, another to transfigure a cup into a yoga ball. She’s resolute and focused. Towards the very end, there’s a special opening charm, one he’s never heard before, that the Healers can’t use until the woman is ready.
“You can't give up a spot on a team like the Centaurs to teach first-years how to fly. And you and I didn’t even finish school, Gin,” he says, smiling again. “I doubt they’d be banging down our door, asking us to teach kids how to be shite students who won’t ever follow the rules.”
“Cheers,” Ginny says, distracted, starting in on her makeup.
, “then we need to arrange something else.”
Potter rolls his eyes. “Of course you're going to be a prick about it. What a surprise.” He takes another swig from his drink and grimaces as though he doesn’t like it, and sets the glass down on a table decisively. Potter licks his lips; Draco feels like his cock has been hard for a month. “I asked if you wanted to get out of here. With me. I thought maybe— but, obviously… you know, just forget it—“
And then, in the exact same tone as the jokes: “Do you want to get out of here?”
Malfoy abruptly folds his hands on top of the desk, as if he can sense that Harry's thoughts have drifted. There's something lean and predatory about him.
“There was some wanker with a camera prowling around the building earlier, and I figured it was because of you. Doesn’t the media follow you everywhere?” Malfoy sticks his head back out the door and looks back and forth warily before he shuts it.
Ginny does cleaning charms, lube charms, slides her fingers inside Draco, Harry's not sure what exactly. Draco's movements turn into something more like writhing. Harry can't touch him enough, can't get enough, as Draco makes small noises under Harry's hands and Ginny's magic.
“Sorry,” she whispers, lying down beside him, fully clothed. He drapes a heavy arm around her, pretending to be more deeply asleep than he really is. He pulls her close; she smells of fags and summer air, her hair tangled. She’s gone drunk flying. It smells lovely and he shifts his hips, wondering. Ginny notices and shifts against him too, slots his leg between hers.
Well, if she was honest with herself, it had been coming for a while before that; nineteen was just when she started practicing on purpose. There was a learning curve, it turned out. Now she'd been at it for five years, and she was getting rather good.
Harry stays silent — the oldest interrogation trick in the book — and it keeps Malfoy talking, although he gives nothing away. “It suits me, frankly. I’d much rather trade in favours anyway, most of the time.”
As though he is watching from one end of a distant tunnel, Draco sees Harry start whispering to Ginny with his hand on her elbow. The room is still relatively empty, and Draco has an unobstructed view of them. He can see the exact moment where Harry asks about Draco, can see Ginny pull back slightly to look over at him, and he feels caught in a too-bright glare. Her gaze sweeps Draco up and down, harsh, considering. And her nod yes is quick and angry, like she might want to punish him. Good.
danger here.
Suddenly Harry feels too hot, his face and hands clammy. “Don’t use Legilimency on me, Malfoy.”
“Such as?”
allow again — she'd gone out alone to the dodgiest lesbian wizarding club she knew. She got high as a kite and slept with a woman for the first time; it had been a true fucking delight, to bury her face between a witch's legs and get lost there. She'd moved on to two more before the week was out. Ever since then, for half a decade, now, she never stays with one person for long.
He nods, pushing his body slightly back against the strap-on, in a way he hopes means yes. He’s hard already, his cock jutting out obscenely, inches from some warm part of Potter he can feel but can’t see under the blanket.
That was four days ago. It’s helping her to argue so he lets her, participates even, but they both know his heart isn’t in it. Everything feels empty and numb, particularly his head. The part that Voldemort used to occupy, maybe. He doesn’t know. It’s strange and it feels terrible, but all the people he would have told about this new development are dead — Professor Lupin, Dumbledore, Sirius — and what is Harry supposed to do now? Going to Romania, with Charlie, seems like the safest bet — away from the press and all the sad eyes in the Burrow.
, but then Draco has sunk to his knees behind him.
In that spirit, he unpacks the groceries and makes himself an omelet for dinner, cracking three eggs, scrambling them up, turning the liquid round and round in the pan. He adds cheese and salt and pepper, flips it onto a plate with a little flourish, and eats the whole thing standing over the sink.
Whenever Harry thinks about the baby, a little part of him begins to glow inside, a tiny, secret Rememberall there in his chest. A father. His own father was terribly young, yes? (
Harry stays, still standing in the door. The walls are bare except for one painting that looks to be Muggle. A field of wildflowers, completely motionless.
But fuck, does Draco understand the appeal of both of them, now more than ever. The whole room is positively humming, alive with Potter’s magic; it smells of the forest and the sky, somehow, of ozone, of possibility, the tension before a storm. It's Potter’s desire. And maybe, somehow, Draco's going to get to be a part of it.
His own sadness — depression, if he’s honest — is boring and repetitive, more than anything else. It’s a low hum, not a siren. He’s tired of being lonely, tired of being tired, tired of thinking about the war. Leaving Grimmauld was supposed to help; he’s not sure yet if it has.
"You are a child, and impossible."
“I wouldn't. Name your price. In Galleons, please.”
“Hullo, Malfoy,” Charlie says flatly, voice gravelly and dead sexy, and why are all these mangy Weasleys turning out to be so bloody gorgeous? It’s wildly unfair, Draco thinks, an echo of his old inner voice rising to the surface. Until his new one reminds him that his own gene pool is made up of cold-blooded sociopaths who tried to bring down the entire world for their own personal gain.
Everything else looks mostly the same as he climbs the stairs. When he gets to suite 37, there’s a new sign for Premier Pharmaceuticals, with small business cards in a fancy holder attached. There’s also a new doormat, and the door itself looks more substantial, somehow. More prosperous.
For one terrifying moment, he thinks he feels his scar burn and he falls to his knees, hard, banging his hip and sending a lamp crashing to the floor on the way down. James wakes up, wailing, and Ginny tears out of the bedroom, sees Harry on the floor, and screams. Even in the raging, breathless storm of his panic, he thinks,
He's clawed his way into a lower-level Ministry job in the potions unit, although it pays next to nothing and has no real responsibilities. It’s barely more than sweeping up rough-chopped dungbeetles off the floor, but it took him years to earn it and he’ll hold onto it at any cost. If that cost is going to deadly dull Ministry functions like this one, so be it.
He moves into Grimmauld Place for good. It's dusty and sad and full of memories, but at least it has four walls and furniture and he isn’t constantly surrounded by hostile dragons. Harry spends all his time in the living room, watching television and sleeping on the couch, avoiding Sirius' old bedroom and the entire second floor of the house. He avoids the kitchen, too, with its memories of Order meetings and loud communal meals. Hermione and Ron and Neville bring takeaways that they all eat on the couch. Empty cartons and pizza boxes pile up for days before Harry can be bothered to Vanish them.
it,” he says, almost tripping over his own words, and Harry feels a dim thrum of satisfaction somewhere deep in his belly. “But — you?”
for, and they're both wanking him together. Inside Draco’s mind, Harry feels Draco's pleasure and his own, at the same time. His own touch on Draco's cock and under his hand, both at once. He sees a riot of images, swirling liquid chaos that reminds him again of the sea, of being pulled out in a tide of pleasure and sensation.
is going to have to understand that, and
in our sex life, because of—“ she strides back to the table, back to the bottles — “because of a sex potion that
"This is what we do." Ginny leans on the "we" slightly and sees it register on Draco's face. She puts her arm over them both and leaves her top hand on Harry's chest, covering his heart. Draco follows, wrapping Harry effortlessly in his long arms, blankets snug around all three of them. Harry's heart is beating hard, still, beneath her palm. Draco kisses Harry's shoulder as he puts a warm hand on top of hers, and then Harry brings his own hand to cover them both.
Draco suddenly feels tired himself, even though it's still early. It's through a strained haze that he hears Potter ask, “Want to get out of here, Malfoy?”
Draco’s breath catches in his throat and he seems to try to bite back a sound, but Harry’s too close, they’re too tangled, he can feel the rising and falling of Draco’s chest against his own. It’s too much, all of it, and he’s trying to hold back but his traitor hips tilt up again of their own accord until he’s properly frotting against Draco, far too many layers of denim against denim, with Draco’s leg firmly slotted between his own.
"I was wondering, who are you wearing tonight?” he asks, because he really wants to know. Up close, she's even more breathtaking, freckles and all. She's gamine but intense, with large dark eyes and a long bare neck. He’s pleased that his outward tone shows no trace — he hopes — of the pounding in his ears or the stirring of his cock in his trousers.
“Your flat?” Harry asks. “I thought this—“
"So you're a chemist now?" Harry asks.
“Er, what?” She’s annoyed, still distracted by whomever’s behind her, and then that whomever steps to the side and Draco sees. Potter. Of course. And now Draco is trapped. He feels himself stop breathing as he spirals into a dead panic. What in Merlin’s name is Potter doing here? He never comes to these things. Draco hadn't prepared himself even for the possibility. Fuck.
“I can take it. I agree, in fact,” he says tightly, and then, as though summoned by magic — and perhaps he was, somehow, some sort of family charm that registers when the others get riled up — Charlie Weasley appears next to Ginny. He’s bloody hot now too, dressed in skintight dragonhide trousers that presumably he couldn’t be bothered to change, and a self-assured unstudied masculinity. He’s short, even shorter than Potter and a full head beneath his sister in those towering heels, but he radiates power and muscle.
"What? Oh. Hilarious." She rolls her eyes and drags them away from his face; it's easier to be mean to him if she's not looking.
Ginny turned mean on her nineteenth birthday.
Harry didn’t feel better, exactly, but at least the tears stopped choking him. He sobbed, down on all fours, grounded and safe from Ginny’s fire, and that was when he knew he had to leave.
“What’s that?” She burrows further into his side, her face just inches away from Harry's. Draco’s got an arm around each of them, trapped, snug. "I'm half-asleep, Malfoy, I can't track your poncy vocabulary."
"Oh. You're… are you saying you're…?" Harry doesn't even know how to end the sentence.
“Malfoy, what—?“
"Well? Would you be comfortable?"
The posh elevator rises only one floor and then glides to a stop again. Three more people get in: a man and two women, Muggles from the look of it, and absolutely wasted.
, just like Harry had, and still does sometimes. It’s hard for him to relate to other kids. At eleven, he’s still never had a best friend, or really any friend at all. “You’re only as happy as your unhappiest child,” Molly has always warned, and she’s right.
On his twenty-fourth birthday, Harry is awake as the clock flips over to midnight, changing James' nappy. He hums ‘Happy Birthday’ to himself so the baby can hear it for the first time, but keeps his voice soft and uses the dimmest possible Lumos so the baby doesn’t fully wake up. James is still heavy with sleep, and he burrows under Harry’s chin when he picks him back up. Harry's still humming softly.
. Lucky for you, I just brewed a new batch this morning.”
“First he has to save the whole bloody world or whatnot” — Draco waves a hand in the air dismissively — “and then he has the nerve to look like
“Maybe we could talk to another mediwitch,” Harry suggests, and then Ginny looks at him like Avada is on her very lips. For a moment, Harry wishes it was.
Harry snorts. “Can you honestly see me doing any of those things?”
“Come in, Potter, and shut the door behind you. We mustn’t lurk in doorways,” Malfoy says. He motions to a chair in front of the desk. "I see your manners haven’t improved."
“Stop it," Harry smiles. He throws cushioning charms at its corners and then one at the baby himself, for good measure. “It’s just the only thing that makes sense to me, you know?”
Harry looks down. He is. Starkers, that is, in a hotel room with Ginny and Draco Malfoy, and his traitor heart still refuses to calm down because it wants this — wants
He’s back at Seaside Lane, entering that dingy lobby again five days later. At least someone’s cleaned the fish tank in the meantime, and there’s a fleet of tiny, silvery fish darting about in crystal-clear water.
They get married at Bill and Fleur’s cottage, the salty air whipping at Ginny’s dress. Harry says “I do” and means it. When he pulls her close to kiss her, he tastes the sea on her lips, and then he feels a little kick right at his abdomen, even through all those layers of clothes. Someone tips off the press, but when they refuse to bugger off, George launches vicious sulfur-sticking charms at them until they flee, which is highly satisfying.
“You heard the witch,” Malfoy said, and his tone definitely has a waver in it now, and Harry can’t figure out why he’s suddenly obsessed with tones and flushes and clothes and Malfoy’s hands and oh bloody hell this really is not how he rolls, so he launches over the bedclothes and grabs Draco’s head with both hands and kisses him, hard. Malfoy instantly brings his arms up around Harry's neck and pulls him down on top of him, and they fall back onto to the bed together. The whole of Draco's long, lean body is stretched out beneath him.
“That’s what you want, Malfoy?” Harry asks, astonished. He rolls off to the side and Draco gathers him up; Harry rests his head on Draco's shoulder. “You had a whole wank bank full of images of me over the course of decades, but you were afraid to show me a pretty bedroom?”
He looks over and Ginny's eyes are softer, her nostrils flaring, a smile teasing her lips.
“Fucking show-off, isn’t he," Malfoy says again to Ginny, trying to keep the tremor from his voice, as he avoids looking at Potter's body for fear of losing the ability to speak entirely. She cracks another one of those beautiful wry smiles, so Draco keeps going, fake under his breath, as though Harry isn’t meant to hear.
Harry has every intention of sleeping through London’s stupid New Year’s Eve celebration. Fireworks over the Thames, sloshed revelers snogging in the streets — it could all go straight to hell. Harry hates fireworks, for obvious reasons. And even before the war, when he got to stay at Hogwarts for the holidays, he used to spend New Year's Eve hiding. Too much forced happiness for his tastes.
Ginny already slept with someone else — a sixth-year Ravenclaw, rumour has it, but the two of them never discuss it — and Harry is relieved not to have to shoulder the burden of being her first. Also, she has a bit more of an idea of what she's doing than he does, which is convenient.
"Why are dragons good at music? They know their scales."
Still feigning sleep, Harry doesn't respond any more to her touch. Tomorrow, he tells himself, fully awake as she moves away, disappointed, and goes off to the loo. Tomorrow, he’ll take the potion — still safe in its bottle at the bottom of his work satchel — and then he’ll make it up to her.
"I’m not talking about
When they’d come back to the Burrow, she’d wordlessly motioned for him to follow her up to her room, at first leading him by the hand and then dropping it when they’d reached the stairs. Her back climbed in front of him, straight as a rail, unyielding. Rigid.
"Come on, Gin, let’s get some food," Charlie growls, still looking at Draco. He tries to take her arm and lead her off. She wrenches it out of his grasp but follows him anyway, throwing a glance over her shoulder at Draco that surely should have put him six feet under. It barely registers. No one can match his own self-loathing, which he believes makes him untouchable. Quite literally. For years.
"Why do you want to be separate?"
Harry shows up early on a Tuesday morning before heading to the Ministry. It’s raining again, a driving summer rain that’s freezing nevertheless. It makes him hurry down the drab, grey street, past one or two other soaked commuters heading in the other direction. He never has an umbrella when he needs one, of course, and there are too many Muggles around to conjure one or cast a protective spell. When he gets to Malfoy’s building, he runs up the stairs dripping wet, knocks, and rushes in as soon as Malfoy opens the door. He throws drying charms at his hair and his clothes and an extra one at his glasses — but not before he sees Malfoy give an odd look at his soaked hair and the rivers of water running down his face.
“It costs what I say it costs. One favour, of my choosing. Think of it as an advanced bartering system. Like feudalism.”
Draco's mind is racing, but he manages to follow Potter's deliberate gaze across the room, and it lands on Ginny like a searchlight. She's already looking back toward them while Charlie and some other bloke talk at her as she completely ignores them. She's not trying to hide it.
“Feudalism?” Malfoy always does this to him, always has done — makes him dumb and slow, always ten steps behind.
?” Harry blurts out, before he can stop himself.
She'd always wanted to sleep with Harry again, now that she knows more — more about her own body, about what feels good and why. It’s a relief to sink back into it. To admit she still wants him. To do something about it.
something he could ding Malfoy on, after all. “Tell me what?” he asks warily.
“Well, I never!” the mirror harrumphs at her, which is blatantly false, because they have this conversation at least twice a week. “Have a
Ginny sighs and instantly Harry is sixteen again, confused and sad and horny in a way that feels shameful. He was afraid of everything back then. Fear was part of his every waking moment, with the Yule Ball and Voldemort looming in equal measure. He remembers how loud his thoughts were. How hard he worked to push down the ones about men in general and Malfoy in particular, to twist them toward rivalry and anger instead of the beginnings of desire.
Ginny is unhappy, too. They’ve been tense, arguing often, and last night had been particularly loud. Al had even woken up, so they’d had to quit abruptly in the middle of the fight to walk him back to bed. Harry wasn’t even sure what they’d begun quarreling over, but it had ended with Ginny citing the near-total drop-off of their sex life, which had been lackluster for a decade but had grown even worse recently.
"No." Harry crosses his arms and shifts his weight. Fuck, but he's uneasy here.
But Al turns out to be a different, more difficult baby. He's colicky, and he screams and screams. As hard as things were with James as an infant, they're ten times harder with Al.
The next morning, a few hours before Ginny and Ember are due home, Harry collects every vial of Lover’s Voice he can find and shoves them under the sink in the loo. He just wants to forget about them, about Malfoy, about the feeling of him rifling through Harry’s head, about this whole bloody stupid thing. He casts a sloppy concealment charm — one that doesn’t offer the slightest bit of resistance when, a few weeks later, Ginny calls, “Accio purple potion,” obviously expecting something else. Harry never did find out what.
He looks down again at the parchment in his hand.
On his stomach again, he palms his cock more roughly and begins to work himself harder. Trapping his fist beneath him, he stills his hand and pushes into it, everything tight and awkward. He used to always wank this way and it reminds him of his early jerking-off experiences, alone at Grimmauld Place, flipped over on the couch, lonely and anxious. His hips moving faster, Harry thinks of Malfoy again, of what it must have been like for him after the war, whether he started finally touching himself then too. Would he have been learning to get himself off just like Harry did?
Ginny is pinned down. She can’t move, can't leave, can’t float away from herself. Ginny draws closer into Draco's back; she's trapped, and yet somehow she wants more. Wants this again and again. It’s wonderful, it's awful, and there’s nothing for it.
Of course he notices. As Malfoy’s eyes slide down Harry’s body, his long lashes, blackened with some sort of makeup, tilt down and practically brush his cheeks. Harry’s distracted, shifting again and wondering whether he’s ever noticed another human’s eyelashes before and whether all of them are that bloody attractive. But he notices when Malfoy finally drags his gaze back up and his eyes look different, somehow, darker, more wicked, and he’s biting his bottom lip.
“Good morning to you too,” Malfoy says, rolling his eyes. “Leave it to you to arrive at some indecent hour and fill my flat with your stupidly aggressive magic before I’ve even had a coffee.”
She tastes like nothing he can describe with words, unless she’s been drinking. Then, she tastes like firewhiskey and fresh air and sweat and spring, like the first buds of the leaves on the trees.
When the spotty, Hogwarts-aged kid working the front desk tells them that hotel rooms will be complementary for "the great Harry Potter" — and when the poor git actually bows, so low he practically scrapes the ground — Harry dearly wishes for death. Ginny and Draco roll their eyes at the exact same moment. They catch each other's glances and cackle, identically, and suddenly Harry wonders what on earth he's just arranged.
Eight days after the battle, Harry — in Ginny’s words — makes plans to “fuck off” to Romania.
was what their lives looked like — made him feel impossibly sad. Days later, it still does.
Once, he doesn't leave the house for nearly a fortnight. He's trying to wait out the paparazzi camped outside his door, and it works — they get bored, bugger off, and start stalking other fools instead.
Harry’s about to doze off when he hears Draco singing under his breath.
“Is that right?" Malfoy drawls, his eyes narrowing. "Isn't it nice to have
"He was supposed to teach me a lot of things."
"I really do not want to talk to you anymore," she says, pretending to study the buffet again, but she doesn't move.
Finally managing to tear himself away, Draco manages to say, "More than. But you just told me to shut up a minute ago." One corner of Potter's mouth quirks up, and Ginny huffs out a little laugh.
“Aren’t we enough to satisfy your saviour complex?” she asks, motioning to herself and James, who’s now trying to pull himself up onto a coffee table.
"Maybe, but that's not what I mean," he says, infuriatingly steady as usual, but with a smile teasing his mouth as well, those full lips, the crinkles around those jewel-green eyes awakening now, a mischievous smirk overtaking the weariness of his face. "I mean you, Gin" — his tone changes on her nickname, to an unmistakable one she can’t help but recognise from years ago — "do
Still, Ginny resists the urge to run, or at least slink away to another corner of the room, instead closing her eyes and attempting a deep breath. The boning digs into her ribs, reminding her of her armor; she could loosen it with just a flick of her wand, but she won’t. She needs it to make her sharp, to keep her that way.
He swoops off without looking back at Harry, and it occurs to Harry as he follows — dutifully, like a pet — that he quite wants to see where Malfoy lives.
? And you
"What is it, then?" Harry asks.
“Feudalism,” Malfoy repeats, and the absurdity seems to amuse him. His mouth curls in a smile. “Like serfs and their lords, who own the land the serfs must work. Powerless people always find a way to reclaim some power, or else they’re scrabbling for it in the darkness, building their own empires in some remote, cavernous lair.”
“Composure’s overrated. I want to make you come apart, Malfoy.” He sees Draco force back a groan, biting down on his lip. “Oh, do you like that?”
“It’s very… er, you know...”
“It’s still early days yet, but things look splendid! Right on track!” she announces cheerfully, on her way out of the room. “We’ll give you a supply of good prenatal vitamins, and make sure to eat a moderate and healthful diet. Not too much, mind, and not too little. Baby will always take what it needs from a woman’s body. Just take care of yourself!”
Hearing Malfoy apologise puts Harry on his back foot. "But your Occlumency skills are shite, Potter." Malfoy is joking now, tentatively, as though he’s testing Harry’s reaction. "No wonder the Aurors are a bloody disaster."
“Nothing I do is illicit,” Malfoy snaps back. “I have licenses for every potion I trade in. Would you like to inspect them, Auror Potter? Are you here on Ministry business after all?”
He’s been at this stultifying event for half an hour and hasn’t said a word to anyone. Most people avoid him at social functions, which is just fine with him; as soon as his supervisor arrives, he'll just make sure she spots him, and then he can leave. He’s considering which takeaway place to choose from on the way home when he spots Ginevra Weasley over near the food tables, her close-cropped red hair shining like a beacon. She’s striking — more than, really, she’s bloody beautiful, all sharp angles and beguiling androgyny and... couture? Where could she possibly have gotten a bespoke suit like that?
Potter nods. "I can see why," he says in that neutral tone, a considering look on his face. He toys with the glass in his hand.
“I’m not fucking off anywhere,” he tries to tell her late at night, in another whispered fight in her tiny, stifling bedroom. He’s lying and they both know it; fucking off somewhere, anywhere, is exactly what he’s doing. Romania is just the only option that’s been presented to him. He can’t breathe during these fights, can’t think. The air gets murky and thick.
Draco sighs. Another globe of light bumps against his hand and he toys with it gently, moving it from side to side. “I don’t know what I’m saying. I never do, with you. You’ve always made a fool of me.”
Fine, Harry thinks again, and sets down his coffee. He deliberately does not reach for his wand. He presses his palms together and pulls in just a bit of magic there, gathers it and shapes it, and then casually holds his right palm out toward Malfoy. Five round globes of light release from his fingers and float lazily toward the ceiling like giant fireflies. He used to do this for the kids all the time, when they were small.
When Draco drops to his knees, Harry jams his hand on the button, all the buttons, any button. The lift jerks to a stop, but no alarms ring.
“You want to?” she asks softly. Her body is nice against him but her hand feels too rough in his hair. His nerves are still jangly; he’d come just an hour or two earlier. And the sensations he’d conjured for himself — like what it would feel like to put his own mouth on another man’s prick, fucking hell — those might come back while he’s with Ginny, and that would
like it's like that. And to think I thought you were— I thought you had some sort of
“Gay?” Draco asks. “Is that the word you seem to have misplaced?”
"It is," he agrees. She's very close to him now, nudging his knee with her own. He widens his legs, and she steps between them. Unexpectedly, she kneels, holding eye contact the whole time, and puts her hands solidly on the tops of his thighs. His cock hardens immediately and she notices, smiles wider, quirks an eyebrow. Oddly, Harry doesn't even feel embarrassed. Could this be the reason she'd come? Or had all this wanking somehow addled his brain?
Harry says nothing. You don’t owe Draco Malfoy an explanation about anything, he tells himself. Malfoy’s eyes are still boring into him, pinning him down.
“Truth is, I can’t figure out what to do with you,” he says, sitting forward and cupping the mug with those long, delicate hands. His fingers reach nearly the full way around. “I often need Ministry favours, but nothing that rises to your level. And I don’t want to waste you.”
Instead, she keeps her distance and observes Harry. He's ignoring everyone in the room, steadily shoving pastries into his mouth like they're handfuls of popcorn. She's mean now, she reminds herself, and well beyond hungry.
He can almost hear the affectless voice of Arvin Mukherjee, the assistant potions analyst who submitted this report, reading it aloud. Arvin sounds judgmental, in his head. Harry scans the rest of the document.
“Fine, I’ll see what I can do," he says, and gets out of there was fast as he can.
"No. Stop. No."
He breaks away from Malfoy and tries to catch his breath. Merlin, she's still so fucking
After raising a dubious eyebrow at the keycard, Malfoy opens the door with an Alohamora under his breath and surveys the room. “Quaint,” he sniffs as the door swings shut.
"Please stop, fuck, you are literally killing me," she says, but now a smile is twitching at the corner of her lips, and gods, it’s Harry; it's always been.
