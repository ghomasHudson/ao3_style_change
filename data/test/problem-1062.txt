He looked down at his own robes. Slightly too short in the sleeve, and his borrowed overcoat that was for Lucius’ slimmer build. It had been stubbornly resistant to alteration charms but he should have bought a brand new one. Pansy would have murdered him if she saw this outfit.
Draco carefully considers this as if it’s a matter of importance instead of the long ago settled ruins of something less than a relationship that had ended over ten years ago. He laughs a little.
“I’m thinking of inviting Charlie,” Sirius said. Harry looked to where Charlie was helping his mum set out desserts.
“No. You’d report directly to me. It’ll be a small team.” Kingsley was asking. He wasn’t ordering. And that was what worried Harry most.
Draco was not a jealous person, but he did not like the way Harry smiled at whatever Blaise said. It was no doubt off-colour.
“You may use the muggle post which connects to the public Owl network or a telephone. Your correspondence will be monitored. In an emergency, you’ll have a way to contact the Department. Your supervisor will be with you shortly.”
Harry was good at this part at least. He could concentrate without having to look Draco directly in the eye. Draco's left hand fisted in his hair and he tugged hard before he came. Harry loved that little sharp pain. It seemed to focus the hazy arousal as he swallowed.
There was a time that Harry would have leapt for any chance to return, no matter the circumstances. But he knew now to be careful.  Harry needed Auror work grounded in purpose and context or he’d find himself lost again. He needed to be able to step away sometimes and breathe.
Instead they are in the broad daylight of a hospital with a witness and the astringent scent of antiseptic potions stinging his nose. Draco's already tapping his foot impatiently as if he'd rather not waste time.
“Harry, you’re here because we have a mission for you. Draco Malfoy stole an item from the Ministry and we need someone to track him down,” Hermione explained. Harry felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.
The Special Task Force descended on a shipping container on the Greenwich Peninsula near midnight. There were mostly muggle flats here, and a cable car for tourists that was closed. So far, all their operations had been surveillance and the occasional questioning of a stray low-level operative who inevitably knew nothing but wasted their time. Most of the information that came in was useless or after the fact. Minister for Magic Dale Steel was getting impatient.
The breakup didn’t surprise Harry, but it shocked him she wasn’t more angry with him. Harry felt distinctly that it should hurt more than it did, but it was like he was underwater, watching himself going through the motions. Saturday breakfast with the Weasleys, Sunday lunch with Ron and Hermione. Four days on Auror shifts, mostly surveillance. Three days off.
“I don’t know you anymore, but I think I’d like to,” Harry says, feeling himself smile. They clink glasses.
That is not the most important matter at hand, but it's easier than thinking about how he is in some horrible upside-down world. Draco is propositioning him, but only because of a cursed box. In Harry's fantasies this always happened because one late night, Draco had realized Harry had been missing in his life and their friendship could be more.
The fourth time makes Harry feel like the universe might be repaying him for the overabundance of luck from eleven to eighteen. He has run out of his life’s supply perhaps, and now the universe will dangle what he wants in front of him mockingly.
“So much so that you’re having me teach you basic arithmancy,” Draco said. It wasn’t a question. “Wasn’t there someone else who did this before?”
Zacharias was also wearing a highlighter yellow long sleeve shirt that said “COOL” in red letters, dress shoes and khaki shorts which would draw attention from any Muggle. Had Zacharias failed Stealth? He should have, the bastard.
“Yes,” Draco agreed. But they both didn’t seem to be satisfied with this explanation after all the strangeness and magical anomalies they had seen.
"Healer Malfoy. I was hoping to see you again! Your paper on Dragonpox is fascinating. But don't you think anything like Muggle vaccines would be a hard sell to the public?"
"Off, " he murmured. His magic must have gone a little bit haywire, because everything but Draco's boxers disappeared.
But here in this universe, Hermione was gazing at Draco, Draco was staring back. His cloak was a deep rich sapphire blue, and Hermione had matched him subtly, in her earrings and necklace, and the laces from her ballet pumps that wound up her calf and disappeared under her black dress. Her hair was loose, in shiny tumbling curls.
“We should strip your magic now.” The first one was taller. He held a tarnished silver filigree pocket watch that felt familiar. Even though he couldn’t access the memory of that feeling with his shields in place, he knew it was bad. The first one bent and held the pocket watch to him and Draco felt a violent pulling worse than any Cruciatus curse.
“Passed what?” Harry said, irritably. He had let Draco side-along him to a farther apparition point since the weather was still nice enough to walk.
“I’ve seen enough curses in my life, thanks,” Draco remarked. The recruiters from the industry associations came by every year with offers of free brooms, event tickets and shop credits which made him uncomfortable.
Here was the plain truth: Harry had been an Auror and he had always had trouble with boundaries. He’d woken up with case scrolls imprinted on his face. He lied during his annual assessments about how much sleep he got. Everyone did. There had been no one left at home to say ‘why don’t you come to bed, love’ because he stopped being able to have that around him. It all felt like a lie. There were always more kidnappings and raids and new addictive potions.
“Of course.” Harry brought out his wand and the blood vanished from the floor and their clothes. Surely Harry saw enough blood in his own line of work, why did he look so worried?
“I can’t know for certain, but that kind of item...” Draco tapped a photo of a grandfather clock imbued with Dark magic that had been in the resource centre.
"Fuck. Is that what you think happened?" Draco says. His expression is pinched. "I was protecting our jobs. The only thing that stood between us both getting fired was Healer-patient confidentiality. We should have reported it the first time we..." He turns a little pink.
They didn't make it to dinner or to Astoria's party that night. But Harry didn't stay the night either like he had before. He didn't wait for Draco to wake up and tell him about which repairs he was doing in his shop and what he was hoping to find at auction from Gringotts. He didn't stay to tell him in halting words how it felt when they finally put the Mediwizard badge on his robes. He didn’t know how to share this, because he didn’t know how to parse it.
“I think in Egypt it was a phoenix. Some swans and peacocks. Very bird-heavy now that I think about it. I think it was a badger in the Regency world. I couldn’t produce one in many worlds, but I never stayed long in any world like that.”
"There has to be a better system than coming to these things and begging people for research funding," Harry said in a low voice as they entered the main ballroom.
“I told Natalie my godfather couldn’t visit because you were at your boyfriend’s place feeling sick according to Gran. And Nat told the whole class and she won’t speak to me.”
He went to the bar, and there was Hermione. Her hair was loose here, and she wore a lacy bra and shorts that made Harry blush. She had taken a similar approach to glitter smeared liberally all over her face, cleavage and shoulders.
“I’ll take care of your cottage,” Hermione said. “Everyone will think you’re in the Arctic backwoods hiking for the summer.”
“I’m just glad you’re taking some time away,” Neville said. Harry laughed to himself later. It wasn’t going to be much of a vacation.
“Listen to me, Teddy. Your classmates are being silly. We’ll talk to the school and it will stop, and you will make new friends,” Harry said.
“Yes,” Harry says. Harry smiles even though it feels like his heart is about to skip out of his chest.
"Yes, I've met your parents," Harry said dryly, and they both caught each other's eye and cracked a smile.
Draco moves slowly. He scoots down the bench until he’s pressed up, warm and steady, against Harry. He brings his pint and sets it carefully next to Harry’s. Then he is leaning further still. Harry doesn’t move. He lets Draco run his hand up Harry’s arm, then catches Draco's fingertips and pulls him in. There’s a beat where Harry is determined not to be the one who chases, again. Draco has no such qualms and kisses him once.
Harry tried to hold his breath for long enough, but he felt a tightness in his chest and a burning in his throat. He opened his mouth. The water rushed in. He awoke drenched in sweat and gasping for air.
Draco felt like a naïve child. Part of him had believed that it would be as simple as going away for a little bit and everything would be fine when he returned. He was bitterly aware of the irony of being upset that someone had been unfair to him because of who he was.
Then Draco sinks to his knees and Harry is speechless. His head thumps back violently against the wall. His jeans and pants are pushed down roughly and Draco's mouth is on his cock, all at once, with no preamble. He can't watch. It's too much. Because it is clear that Draco has, in fact, done this before. Harry has been trying not to think about it. He thinks Draco might be laughing at him but no one he's dated has ever been so abrupt about it.
They walked him to the foyer with more questions to see if he was okay. Then his mum stepped into the Floo with him and said “10 Bridal Court” and the fireplace whisked them away.
“No, he works at the Department of Mysteries, messing around with the fabric of time,” Pansy chimed in. Theo shrugged. So it was possible to find Ministry work with their history.
As far as Draco was concerned, Theo probably had the most functioning moral compass of the three of them since he’d been publicly disowned for not being a reactionary whiner like the rest of his ridiculous family. His mother still only allowed him around the house when his stepfather was away while publicly denouncing him, as far as Pansy said.
Draco pulled him in tight again desperately but still gentle. Harry found his hands sliding up Draco’s torso underneath his cloak. He could offer some limited comfort. This all felt familiar and close, like the dancing had been.
Harry names the hotel, a tiny budget chain whose pitch seems to be “you’re only here to sleep” and “your employer is cheap.” Draco nods. They don’t speak, although once or twice Draco glances over at him and smiles ruefully when their eyes meet. Soon enough they pull into Harry’s hotel drop off.
“Harry.” The whisper came from Draco’s makeshift hospital bed in the study. Draco was sitting up with a book and a small ball of light that he was reading by.
“Yes. I’ve watched you put away half a treacle tart as an adult, so no one’s perfect.” Draco said. “What will you have?”
He pointed at the black box in the middle of the parchment with his wand and  the following appeared:
“But it was important,” Harry says, because he understands. Harry puts down the spoon and makes Draco sit at the table. Harry has them eat his Silician aubergine stew. Fills up their water glasses. It’s only when they finish eating in silence that Harry folds Draco carefully into his arms and kisses the top of his head.
“There’s no reason it would be limited to wizards either,” Kingsley said softly. “We all have a magical core.”
Harry knows when he’s being flirted with. He might be inept at normal small talk but flirting he can do. And he entertains her for a bit, letting Valerie tease him a little about his accent and give him advice on what to do for the rest of the weekend.
“Fine then. Sometimes, for special cases, we need outside consultants and researchers. We pay, but not a lot. It would be helpful,” Harry said.
Harry dug up an old Prophet from a nearby pile of abandoned construction material. He couldn’t read anything but the words ‘General Bellatrix Lestrange’ and the same date he had left his home. He couldn’t imagine. It had been ten years. Ten more years of Voldemort’s rule here. That sent a chill through his body.
He did not like being hunched in cold alleys waiting for nothing to happen for no reason anyone would tell him. He felt conflicted about midnight raids and relying on a split second instinct that often left him to wonder if he hadn’t fulfilled Dumbledore’s dearest wish and become a weapon and not a person.
Maybe he should do as his parents bid him and restore the glory of the Manor. The money is there, after all. The time is there too, should he wish to contract out most of the stonemasonry, tiling and window repair. It would only take an Owl from his Ministry desk to a builder and then to Gringotts.
A month of investigation and they still couldn’t figure out how they were using Dark objects to make bombs. There had been a few more incidents, mostly copycats who had gone for smaller targets like the Muggle section of Flourish & Blotts. People were starting to get very worried. Minister Steel seemed near sacking them all to have something to show to the public.
Harry noted Marcus Flint had a lot of accounts the Revenue Service had traced illicit money with a double line linked to Gregory Goyle. They were evidently funding most of these ventures, circled in blue and green.
Then Draco reached out and tucked a curl of hair behind Harry’s ear, brushing his cheek softly. Harry was so taken aback he let it happen. The haziness he felt in this body—which he realized might be party drugs—responded to this. With a bit of embarrassment, he realized he could feel the edge of a deep affection. Not friendship. Even Luna didn’t touch Harry like that. No one did.
Someone came by to give him a bowl of gruel. They uncovered his head for the fifteen minutes he was allocated to eat and drink water. The slop was generally flavourless. The water tasted vaguely metallic and someone always watched him. They changed the person regularly to prevent him from trying to ingratiate himself. Hilarious.
She snorted at the memory, but fondly. He hadn’t known about this tradition because no one had done it to him. But he liked it better this way round.  Harry continued to watch him for a few seconds longer.
They fell into an intimacy that felt so natural Harry didn’t want to question it. Draco brushed a smear of toothpaste off Harry’s face, napped on his shoulder and put his cold feet in Harry’s lap while he read dusty tomes from the library.
“You’ll be in Muggle London. We have secured you employment and a residence. You are required to check in once a week with an officer and twice a week with a counsellor. You are not permitted to use magic, carry a wand or visit any Wizarding establishment or community.”
Then, when he had waited long enough, he took a deep bracing breath and turned the longer wing clockwise once.
“Well, now there’s the two of you and I’m single. Bad scheme, don’t you think?” Harry was aware he was drawing closer and closer to interference.
“I think I can make it so you’ll be okay. They want to keep this quiet. You’re safe,” Harry whispered.
“That’s why they sent Pansy,” Hermione joked. “Rumour is she told the Wizarding Prime Minister she would marry him if he’d tell her what he bloody wanted.”
As soon as he landed in this universe, it felt different. He was at the Burrow. He automatically looked for George. Everyone worried about George nowadays at gatherings. He tended to drink too much every once in a while. It was a coin toss whether he’d be melancholy or mean. Since Angelina came into the picture, George had been better. But Harry still wasn’t out of the habit of looking for him.
He doesn’t know the neighbourhoods or what they signify. Someone names a bar in the middle of a story and a chorus of voices jump in to complain about fucking tourists. Harry is a bit self-conscious because he is a tourist. Although he’s never chundered in an aisle of Jean Coutu, their equivalent of Boots, as someone does in another story. The griping about their Ministry goes over his head. He’s aware of McGill because it’s their Faculty of Magic that’s hosting the conference. The Wizarding World doesn’t seem cut so sharply from the muggle one here. They use the same money, frequent the same shops, go to the same universities.
“The next Emperor Mage of Russia. It explained how horrific their Italian was. Even mine wasn’t as bad. He was fleeing assassins from his younger brother, trying to get himself ahead in the line of succession. Nasty business.”
They buy a case of beer with some more confusion over the brightly coloured bills, then apparate to a park and walk up a residential street that could have been anywhere in the world.
“I want to talk about this feeling of being useful. Don’t you think there are other things that you can value about yourself?” Healer Blishwick said. Harry tried not to groan audibly. Well, at least they were doing this somewhere that made sense.
“This is why,” Draco whispered, leaning back. His eyes were darting all over Harry’s face. “If you must know. This is why.”
“We don’t need to make conversation. You can go back and tell all your friends you saw Draco Malfoy, and he looked pathetic,” Draco spat out.
“I don’t sell it in my shop,” Draco said. "Even you could brew your own if you wanted it. Not that you would need to." The last part came out all wrong like Draco had meant it to be a cutting observation about his fame instead of Draco admitting he thought Harry was fit. Harry was pleased.
Harry disappeared from anywhere they might meet for the better part of a month. He excused himself from Cho and Padma’s hundred days party for their baby, left pub nights after ten minutes, put off shopping on Diagon.
Harry was searching the cottage where Draco was supposed to be held. Nothing. He ran back outside and saw a flash in the distance. Before he could be sure it was Draco on the horizon, a jet of red light shot out and the person went down. Harry ran, firing some of the nastier curses he knew by instinct.
"I'm not a scavenger," she says, rather bluntly. "I would not feed there. This smells like a witch."
“I don’t think I should,” Draco said. Harry stood in the same spot as Draco picked up his wand from the kitchen. “I’m sorry.”
“Shut up,” she said. There was something familiar about her, but she wore a Death Eater style mask and it was hard to make out anything but brown eyes and dull dishwater hair that sat limply on her black cloak.
Kingsley paused until it was uncomfortable. Zacharias turned a deeply unattractive shade of puce and looked away.
Draco was desperate to get some air, and there was Harry Potter again. Harry was wearing the finely tailored smoke grey robes of the Ministry Aurors. Was Harry to witness every fucking failure in Draco’s life from start to finish?
When Draco saw Greg a second time after their initial meeting the day after he was released, he realized he had not been sufficiently scared of him the first time. Greg was wearing a black trench coat over black robes and filled his doorway, blocking out the meagre sunlight. There was something about the set of his shoulders and the blankness of his expression he’d seen before.
“They’re staring because I’m terribly good-looking. They want to know why I’d even be seen with the likes of you,” Draco whispered.
“Seeing the best of him isn’t the same thing as seeing someone. He’s made different choices here. Maybe he’s worried about what you will think of him?”
Draco lets his hand drag along the wallpaper, leaving streaks in the yellowing grime. His fingers dance over the bannister as he goes down the stairs, watching motes of dust plume upward. He holds onto the front door so long, he felt like he might not shut it.
“What about the Ministry?” Draco leaned into the touches even as he continued to deploy an under-used and ill-sharpened defensiveness.
Another trainee stepped forward who Draco actually knew. He had lent notes to Benjamin Kwanu once, which means they were practically friends as far as his interactions with other students had gone.
“Anyone could travel to parallel universes, right? But most people have a limit. More than a few hours and you begin to forget yourself. If you stay too long, you become who you are pretending to be.”
“I’ve promised Molly and Andromeda that I’d take care of you like my own,” Narcissa said softly. “So many of your people called to check on me with the situation with Draco. They knew that...” she trailed off.
They eat chips and cheese with gravy from a corner shop for lunch. The gravy is so scalding hot it seems like it could melt the provided plastic forks. Michael says this is more authentic, and anyway it’s tasty enough that Harry doesn’t care. Harry and Michael scarf it down on the steps of a bank with some ice-cold, if overpriced, bottled water.
“You can tell him yourself next week. We love you, Harry. Potter Residence.” his mum disappeared into emerald flames. It took a few moments to clear the tightness in his chest.
“She’s his Senior Policy Advisor on Justice and Security. We’re guessing that’s where the leak came from,” Athena explained. Well, he knew she’d hated Hermione Granger, but wasn’t joining a terrorist group a bit much?
“Nothing like that. There’s a very decentralized structure. Small cells carrying out particular operations. But I’m worried about the intelligence we’ve been receiving. Someone is moving a lot of Galleons to fund this. We thought the recent arrests with Dark objects were one-off incidents, but if they are connected, it’s about to get much worse,” Kingsley said.
He knew he should calm down and focus. He should be able to solve this problem. He should have put a tracking charm or three on every item of clothing Draco owned and followed him around St Mungo’s and glared at all of his patients and fought all of them and protected him and...
Draco’s magic as if it’s a phantom blanket wrapped around him. Comforting. Maddening. They both stroke each other but Draco’s hand over Harry’s pants is too brief a sensation to find any relief.
“No,” Draco said too fast. Harry let him have that too, winding his long fingers in Harry’s hair absentmindedly.
“Be careful with him,” Healer Cummins said. But while Harry tried to gently wrap his arms around him, Draco was the one who crushed him to his chest. Harry tried to come up with any words to sum up how he felt.
Well, then. That made sense to an extent. If Hermione was with Draco, Ron would have to be with someone else. But he would have imagined someone like Katie Bell or Lavender Brown. Maybe someone more nurturing and indulgent. No matter what world they were in, that wasn’t describing Pansy Parkinson.
“Is there any other way to get rid of this?” Draco asks, an insistent note creeping into his tone. “We have to report back."
Harry actually felt pretty decent, thanks to Draco’s work. There was not so much as a residual soreness. He had been injured like this on operation before and felt it for months. He hadn’t even really considered up until this moment that he could have possibly got them both in a lot of trouble if he had led his attackers to Draco’s home or didn’t wake once he passed out. He’d really put a lot of faith in Draco.
“Have I passed?” Draco said after they left. Harry didn’t always go back to the castle now since his weekends were his own unless he had night duty or practice. Sometimes he escorted Draco to his flat and then walked to Grimmauld.
They had done that again, in Harry’s flat the next morning after a measured conversation about the weather. Then again, in the coat closet at Ron’s birthday party with a hastily constructed privacy charm, because it felt like Draco knew how Harry felt. They had kissed too, in this very shop in the backroom on Draco’s workbench, when they got the news about Andromeda's full recovery.
He led Draco further into the cramped used bookshop. It was, politely, a real fucking mess. He couldn’t tell by looking how the books were organized, and he had to navigate carefully to avoid tripping over stacks on the floor at random intervals and heights.
Draco didn't ask. He just doesn't let go of Harry once they get to Harry’s doorstep. He leans in closer.
“If you want the Firebirds, I’ll let you have both and tell them I woke up here without them,” Harry said. It was a gamble. Draco could disappear back into the universes. He was betting on something that he wasn't sure of.
Alright, so Harry wasn’t that oblivious. Draco was always good-looking. Harry could admit that much.
"Embarrassing at my age to have learned something new about myself," Sirius said, shaking his head. He was slightly pink around the tips of his ears. Ah.
“We won’t...if you’re not sneaking Harry Potter out of your bedroom like a mistress in a brothel,” his mother said. Draco groaned. Harry had definitely left by now.
The next morning he made it to the kitchen where owls had borne all the flower arrangements. Lilies, snapdragons, snapping hydrangeas, wildflowers. Gilding everywhere. With condolences, sorry for your loss, our sympathies. One basket stuck out. It looked forlorn in a black clay planter, more of a plant. Out of habit from intake rotation at St Mungo’s, he scanned it with his wand. An ordinary peace lily.
“Current studies for what happens if you get murdered in another body are inconclusive,” Hermione said. Her face was carefully blank.
Harry had fallen back into examining Draco closely like it was an old cloak. He tried to parse his motives more generously than he would have back then, but otherwise, he was quite literally following him around and trying to see what he was up to.
Hermione arrived in short order. She looked at Harry then Draco and back again. Harry was making a point of not looking at Draco. Draco was looking at him and barely at Hermione.
The first Sunday lunch that weekend with Hermione and Ron, he told them in halting words about what had happened. True to Kingsley’s word, most people thought he was on assignment.
"You flirt with the bartender for a top-up and half the department for first pick of case files. Forgive me for not thinking it signified anything."
"Stop thinking." He does. They fall asleep again shortly after. Draco shakes Harry awake sometime later.
"I want you to come," Harry says. His brain can barely form the words in between thrusts. It takes a few minutes but with a loud cry Draco does, pulsing over both of their stomachs. Harry feels the tight squeeze of Draco around him. He can feel the pooling warmth of orgasm approaching. What tips him over the edge, embarrassingly enough, is Draco reaching up to kiss him on the mouth, shaky and tender. When Harry finishes, he rolls onto his back.
Usually they spoke during sex, but this last time had been silent except for the occasional loud gasp or bitten off moan. There was no negotiation, just the language of long looks and nods. In the hallway to the stairs, Harry had undone the buttons on Draco’s trousers, pulled them down. Sometimes he wondered if everything he liked was what Draco taught him to like. But Harry didn’t want anything to be routine, so he’d turned Draco to face the wall, made Draco hold himself open and ate him out slowly until he could tell Draco was almost there by the fine trembling of his legs. He pulled back. Draco almost sobbed. Harry had never wanted anyone more.
Harry waits until Draco leans forward and brushes his lips tentatively. The bond fizzes to life in Harry’s veins. This is something different than the others. They should stay away from each other so it could dissipate. There is no pain when Harry lets go out of shock. They should go straight to St Mungo's.
There was a time Harry would have heard the disdain more than the joke. Draco offered him a small, almost imperceptible wink. Harry grinned.
The witch who spoke at his information session was impatient and talked at a rapid clip while stamping pieces of paper and getting his signature, wand and fingerprints. His hand shook slightly, handing over his replacement wand from Switzerland.
Draco was immediately incandescent and turned around and stopped to look at Harry. His jaw clenched and his posture straightened even further like he meant to make the most of the few inches he had on Harry.
As if he was allergic to sincerity, Draco immediately pushed his plate towards Harry and he looked at Harry expectantly. They both had about a quarter of their plate left which was surprising because Harry hadn’t even noticed Draco eating at all.
He sat on a bench and listened to the idle chatter as it floated out. Fleur and Draco were speaking in rapid-fire French. He heard his name a few times, but nothing he could understand. He couldn’t explain it, but Draco sounded more certain of himself in French. If Fleur’s laughter was any sign, he was a lot funnier too.
Lucius had been deemed too dangerous for visitors. They both sent inquiries through Narcissa. Something foundational had fractured in their relationship and Draco had refused to apologize for it. Maybe that was a mistake. He would never know now.
They swept away and Harry watched them with an aching chest. It was easier now to understand what feelings belonged to him and which to his body. But it didn’t help to know. He let the confusion wash over him as well as the pain and longing. Then he got up and walked into an empty side room and sent himself back to Grimmauld.
“I think I’m going to be sick,” Penny said, stumbling away from the living room. She ran the tap but they all heard her dry-heaving anyway.
“I’ve got a terrible headache,” Harry said. “Do you mind taking me home? I’m worried I’ll be sick in the Floo.”
“What do you want from me, Greg?” Draco said. He was scared, yes, but he was also running out of the little patience he had. They might have once been friends, but he didn't want to listen to this speech. It was no doubt connected to what Harry was doing, but he was not an Auror and he didn’t know how to question anyone. If Greg had any hint he had been involved in their operation, he would probably be dead.
Harry wanted to kiss that expression off his face but sat back. Draco was already in his home, no need to crowd him further.
Draco used a different quick motion, and incantation for each of the runes, and they disappeared. Sometimes it was a tiny controlled motion, and sometimes it seemed like Draco had to throw all of his weight onto the balls of his feet. A few times he bit his thumb of one hand and continued to cast with the other as if it was nothing. Harry found it fascinating, watching him work.
“Again with the glitter. I’m going to regret this, aren’t I?” Harry responded evenly. Being special reared its head once again.
“Maybe,” Harry said. Ron shook his head once as he realized he was giving him relationship advice about Draco.
“Sherlock Holmes is on the case,” Draco drawled. For some reason, Harry always responded very well to that tone. Some sort of leftover psychosexual thing from their school days.
“I should check on him,” Harry said. He was going to cross the lawn when Draco looked up and shook his head subtly. Harry stopped.
“I would burn the whole world down if it were Hermione,” Ron said resolutely. Harry could feel them look at each other and then turn their attention to him once again.
“Padma’s half in love with her,” Harry whispers back. “I thought after Cho…” Draco shrugs as if to say,
“Would you like a glass of water?” Draco said. Harry’s eyes flashed. Draco couldn’t tell whether Harry liked or hated it when he acted like it was his home. But he reacted and that’s all that mattered.
Or maybe a universe of generals and spies and muggle wars with France was up his alley. No matter, Harry didn’t want to be there.
Draco gripped his shoulder lightly and steered them towards a balcony on the edge of the ballroom. People shrank away from Draco as they walked while offering Harry passing greetings.
“Not in the living room again,” Draco said. He’d missed healing a carpet burn last time and one of the other Trainees spotted it in the changeroom and snickered. Harry stood up holding Draco and turned to the stairs.
Patience hooted with laughter. Harry was afraid that they were actually annoying Kingsley, but he glanced over and Kingsley was smiling to himself.
. If they think anything, I’m dead and you’re dead. I feel as though I should fucking strangle you, does that answer your question?”
Ron waved first and Harry waved back. They were close to the house, a beautiful Georgian-style home in blush pink. Hermione was wearing a yellow sundress and holding Rosie, who was dressed in a ruffled dark navy onesie. Ron bent and touched his nose to hers, and baby Rosie gurgled happily.
"You and I both know that making people beg for money is a favourite pastime of purebloods," Draco whispered back.
The half circle of decorative statues haven’t moved, but they’ve been draped with white sheets. As if that will cover up the fact they are all damaged and not worth repairing. Some Death Eaters had used them for target practice, when they were behaving. Draco tries not to think of the times they hadn’t been. He drapes a slipped sheet back over the statue of Merlin. His cheek is cracked. That was Nagini’s doing.
With a surprisingly accurate impression of his father, Draco said, “But London is so expensive.” Harry laughed.
“So how are you, Unspeakable Potter? What are you brooding over today? Is it the fate of the universe or climate change?”
Before Harry had thought of Draco all the time and now, he simply didn’t. It was strange, wasn’t it? That his world had narrowed so much and he had forgotten so much. He had forgotten how it felt to throw himself completely into everything. He had forgotten how it felt to be that entangled in a mystery with consequences for everyone.
Harry thought of how far he had to walk to find Draco’s shop, how the other shops surrounding him had shuttered windows, waterlogged notices and yellowing newspapers mouldering on their doorsteps. He thought of the abundance of opportunities for forgiveness and amends available in almost every other world Draco had picked. He thought of his Draco eating alone in the basement of the Ministry and that he had worked in the department no one else in the Ministry liked.
Harry feels nothing special, and then Draco opens his mouth in his next kiss and it’s sensory overload. Harry is the one who is eighteen again, eager for it, re-learning a taste he had known so well. Draco kisses like he’s rushing somewhere and taking Harry along. But there is something different. It can never be the same as it was. They have both lost a lack of consideration about them, Harry thinks. They draw back.
“There’s someone else for you,” Narcissa said. Harry was still standing awkwardly in the doorway when Draco spotted him. His smile became much more shy.
“Tell my cousin Edward never to have his Wolfsbane made by that hack of a Potions Professor at Hogwarts ever again. What you brought me for testing was at least half-strength what it should have been.”
Harry brought out his wand and poked at the necklace, too. He had never had a man’s wandwork make him pay attention; his was efficient, thorough and powerful. For a second, he could feel the distinct golden warmth of Harry’s magic press against his own and Draco fought the urge to lean into it. Draco shook his head instead.
“I hear you’ve been hanging around Harry Potter. You’ve changed, Draco.” The faux concern in Greg’s voice was menacing. Draco decided the best play was not to speak unless asked a direct question as they sat. Draco did not offer him tea or coffee or petit-fours. He was not welcome.
It was Draco lying in the muck, halfway up the hill. He flipped Draco over, checking his wrists for a pulse. There were vicious looking rope welts around his wrists and Harry hated the sight of what they had done. As he watched carefully, he finally saw Draco’s chest rise and fall. He cast a stasis charm with a little too much force but it settled well.
Harry's answering kiss is as much because he wants to as that he doesn't want to go skipping down memory lane. Harry's the first to really touch. Harry presses his palms against both of Draco’s wrists, across the Dark Mark. Even now it seems like the starkness of the lines should redden and raise the skin. He had never been allowed before. Harry traces the faded Sectumsempra slashes down Draco’s torso with a finger, because if they can’t do this then they shouldn’t be fucking at all. He relishes the answering flash in Draco's eyes and then the stillness as he submits to Harry’s touch.
Draco still feels a little melancholy and high-strung so he appreciates the space from Harry. He appreciates the time to consider the cheery beige of the walls, and the plush ocean blue welcome mat as he kicks his shoes off, leaving them in the middle of the floor instead of on the black shoe rack.
From what Harry has seen of Montreal—which admittedly isn’t much, from the Portkey Hall arrivals at the train station, to peering out the window of a taxi where the driver spoke on his phone the whole time, to a hotel lobby—it is charming.
“Your father will be the death of me,” she said fondly. “Upstairs in his books again because he thinks he’s found a new alchemical compound. I’ll be lucky to see him for a fortnight. At least my work stops at 5.”
He arrived at an unfurnished upmarket Borough Market loft that unlocked as he approached. The walls were still shimmering with wards and the one bedroom appeared to be set up for each of them to have separate work stations.
Draco swore he would never wear another black cloak in his life if he escaped. He was sick of the sight of them.
Back at his flat, Gabriel took back the bracelet. It had been on for so long Draco didn’t feel its presence until it wasn’t there. Draco felt a warm rush of magic settle over him and rubbed his wrist.
He sat on the bed and took out the Firebird, which was still bright white. Harry pulled the wing back to centre.
“Isn’t there someone else?” Harry asked. He already knew the answer by the slope of her brow and the unhappy tilt of Hermione’s mouth.
It was his Draco that knocked when the door swung open. He looked different. He looked different from any other version of him. He was still a little underfed, a little haunted. It was as if Draco expected him to tell him to go home. Wand out, like there might be someone lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce.
They spent the better part of a day together before he thought to mention the odd visit from Greg. Pansy, who had been her usual fun self, turned very serious. Theo froze in front of the gates to Malfoy Manor.
“Well, you’ll be off then. You’ll visit, won’t you?” Eustace asked as he had gathered the mugs, spare work shirts and personal items he had left in the Forwellstead's on his last day. Draco stood in front of the door.
His expression was placid. No light of zealotry had been lit recently. This was simply who Greg had chosen to become, Draco realized.
Harry had taken to these walks because Wizarding London sometimes felt too small. Being recognized always made him feel vaguely guilty, especially now. He knew he was not living up to whatever people expected of him. Last week, a witch had cornered him on his morning walk by Grimmauld to talk about the policies of the Second Reconstruction, and he hadn’t found a way to explain that he had not been following much of anything lately.
“Well? Do you like my new nose?” Pansy asked. She turned her face to the side so he could see the likely expensive work of a permanent cosmetic glamour.
“The freezing charm never works as long as they say. I’m off. We should go flying with the kids next weekend.”
“There’s a stray rune,” Harry said breathlessly. The rune was wedged near where the middle of the floor had been and still glowing green.
“I know the difference between our reality and those other ones. I know you are not them,” Harry said.
Next time Hermione complained about his lateness he could tell her he had peered into several universes and it was inherent to his character.
Draco had never mastered throwing off an Imperius, so he sat still even though he was shaking inside.
The worst, because no matter where he was in their flat, Draco was exactly aware of where Harry was, and he couldn’t relax as long as he was trying not to slip up and do something stupid. Every once in a while, Harry got caught by one of the Slytherins, and Draco could tell they were teasing him. Draco didn’t think anyone would outright tell Harry about his crush, but trying to help was almost certainly worse.
She marches them to the third house with grim determination less than a day later. It’s rather average-looking two bed, two bath in Clapham. Modestly sized, warm maple floors, lots of daylight, galley kitchen. Harry can see himself in it, and when he looks over at Draco, he seems to like it.
"Could you be more smug? I find it really attractive and not at all off-putting," Draco says. More sarcasm. But Draco kisses him again, deep and slow with his tongue making broad sweeps in Harry's mouth. Harry cleans them both with a wave of his wand and sleepiness hits. Draco doesn't look like he's going anywhere but it would probably serve Harry right if he leaves. Harry drifts off.
“I’m sorry Harry but it won’t be safe. If you go to Grimmauld, I’ve secured it to contain the magical activity.”
Harry made a full report to Kingsley to follow up with the brief messages he had sent by Patronus. He expected to be reprimanded sharply. In the very least, he had held on to evidence for too long and had stunned five men without cleaning up after himself or alerting the department. But Kingsley only listened without asking any questions.
“I think you have a thing for blonds,” Draco declared as the front door slammed shut on...Ethan? Ewan? Aaron?
Hermione and Ron told him about their new shielding so they could have a telly and a laptop without lining the walls with lead. Fred and George offered to give him a tour of their new shop in Paris, which it seemed Draco had helped with.
“If Bill thought you should handle this by yourself, he wouldn’t have sent me with you,” Harry pointed out.
“And this is what, exhuming the bodies?” Harry jokes. Some of the tension leeches from Draco’s shoulders.
Harry and Draco found themselves face-to-face with Molly Weasley who looked as surprised to see them as they were her. She looked at Rosie as if she was concerned.
Since he was the only person besides Hermione who knew what he was going through, a hastily cast Muffliato in a private enclave of the Rose & Dagger was all he needed to confess the part he'd left out of his discussion with her.
But he couldn’t. When he arrived at the Three Broomsticks on Friday evening, Draco was already there, not touching his drink. It felt like greeting an ex-husband even though arguably nothing tied them together but a mad dash through a dozen universes, a schoolboy rivalry, a few kisses, and a handful of confidences. They sat in the front room, even though there were more private rooms.
“They let you teach impressionable minds at the Muggleborn Centre with that filthy mouth? I’m shocked.” This time Harry did laugh loudly.
“Already? Haven’t they been bickering with the Canadians for the last decade over the potions ingredient restrictions?” Draco asked.
He knew Lucius Malfoy had not been healthy. He’d asked for and received all of his medical records in Azkaban.  He had developed serious tremors as a side-effect of dark curses. Unlike Draco’s, they hadn't faded. His father walked with a cane and had a small seizure shortly after his first year in prison.
Harry forgot sometimes it would have been so much more time for Draco. Days maybe, weeks. He seemed to have spent more time lingering, revisiting, recircling worlds. Harry didn’t often ask these days, but Draco knew more about their other lives and had felt them deeply.
Harry did not understand why Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt summoned him to the Ministry from his summer cottage a few days after term, but he was certain he wouldn’t like it. It wasn’t for social reasons, as the Aurors who flanked his door proved.
“And they killed my first husband, and my brother and several of my cousins, too. Do you think you’re alone? This is not a rectory. It is a hospital. We treat
Draco sketched out the calculations directly on the hardwood with the black marker he had tucked behind his ear. Too much magic wouldn’t be a problem for this. He left the room, and the door melted into the wall. He had cut off the room from the house’s magic and made it unplottable. It would probably collapse on itself like a black hole. Good riddance.
Draco looked up. So he was. He was in a maze of hallways indistinguishable from the ones he had left and yet nowhere closer to the atrium.
Tomorrow finds them a few blocks down at an old English-style muggle pub that has seen better days. It feels weird, like a facsimile of home but exaggerated to cartoonish effect. The place is empty except for the sole staff member. The barman takes their orders, gives them both a pint. Harry has a Molson Canadian, because it sounds safe and he drank it yesterday. Draco asks a flurry of questions about what's on tap before ordering a Double Black IPA, whatever that is.
“Depends on what I’m running from. I ran once already, to here,” Draco said. He let the silence stretch until all Harry heard was the irregular tap-tap of Draco flicking his ash.
Harry laughed. He hadn’t expected Draco to be this amusing in any iteration. This had nothing to do with the investigation, but Harry thought he liked these Dracos absent from their context. They were all missing something, but they were intriguing. They were vivid in a way his Draco didn’t seem to be. What were the choices those Dracos had made that made the difference?
“Lavender Brown? Really?” Harry hadn’t heard about her in a while. She spat at Draco that day in Diagon Alley. But he assumed like everyone else she had moved on with her life and hated Death Eaters which was understandable. Why would she work with them?
“You’ll get some cues. There’s a sort of sense-memory held in the body. If not, pretend,” Hermione said quickly.
Now he was standing in Draco's shop with an expensive present in his pocket. One that was meant to say, 'I'm sorry' and 'I was listening' and 'I've missed you'.
“Look at you,” Greg said disgustedly. Draco was confused about what had prompted that reaction when he realized he had rolled his sleeves up and the thick black band tattooed on his forearm was visible. He had covered it when he couldn’t have it removed. He could feel the outline when he brushed his hand over it, but otherwise it was a smooth solid black when viewed.
In every other universe, something let him know something had changed before. Sometimes it was a matter of a setting or even his career choice. But no, the War had happened here. Harry could tell Draco still had the faint remnants of a Dark Mark on his forearm because he compulsively pulled his sleeves down over his left forearm, though the weather was warm out.
Penelope was dressed in a pink maxi dress and ankle boots. She had piled all her long blonde curls in a bun on her head.  Athena wore dark jeans and a long sleeve white t-shirt. Kingsley was dressed in a black Adidas tracksuit.
“Sorry we had to meet again like this,” Harry said. And he was sorry he hadn’t sent her an owl even though he had been worse than useless. She might have appreciated speaking to the Auror who put her son in danger.
The last step of the process was an entrance interview at the Magical Training and Recruitment office in the Ministry. It had gone okay until the end, though Draco was too nervous to really know whether any of the five panelists had liked any of his answers; they seemed trapped in various degrees of boredom.
That hurt because Draco had thought that too, especially during that month in Azkaban. But the universe said he was here and his dear friend was gone and the world had changed so much. They could live their lives in a way that didn’t mean clinging to the past so desperately. Vince might have changed too. They had been barely eighteen. Why couldn’t Greg see that? How could Greg be a complete stranger to him in ten years?
Draco refused. It wasn’t until hours later when Harry awoke to him flailing that he said, “I won’t take a full dose.”
“What’s wrong with you? Just last evening you were ready to claw my eyes out to be the one to do it.”
“I won’t come to London,” Draco says. Harry's heart sinks though he knew it was coming from the very start. So this is goodbye again then.
Their gazes latch onto each other for a moment. Draco only breaks it to finish off his drink. There's the one drink that was promised. Harry wonders if he’ll leave.
"Can we talk?" They are both off shift now. Harry shrugs. He allows Draco to wait for him to pack his bag, to walk with him down the hallway. At least half the lifts are under repair so Draco backs into Harry inch by inch as their lift car fills. Draco places a hand on Harry's bicep but to Harry's surprise it's not to make distance between them. Harry waits until they are in Muggle London and have been walking side by side for some time to demand answers.
They are both more than familiar with all the top healers. Harry manages to feel slightly embarrassed about it, while Draco has a ranked hierarchy for which ones are great and which are “little better than summoning a mirror and poking oneself with a wand." Draco relaxes when Healer Ahmed enters the room, so Harry does as well. Healer Ahmed is apologetic but firm.
“You should have said something earlier. Jamie, top cabinet on the left?” his mother said. She put an arm lightly around him. “Has this been happening a lot? It’s not a migraine, is it?”
He knew he would go back before he finished the thought. Harry hadn’t felt anything like this rush of adrenaline and reliance on his instincts for a while. It almost reminded him of the good parts of being an Auror.
“In Mysteries, most of us have a personal stake in our research. Otherwise, it’s hard to sustain that level of study for as long as it takes when you spend most of your time failing. The magic is powerful and you get a small taste. And I’ve never—I’ve never been good with temptation.” Draco trailed off.
He expects her to argue with him or needle Draco or even ask when they can be available to view another house. Instead, her mouth goes a bit wobbly. Not her usual crocodile tears for dramatic effect in the Pansy-And-Draco show way. She just slumps in her black dress and tears run silently to her chin.
in life or death situations. You can think whatever you like. Do not speak to anyone in that manner.
“Sorry. We should stop—I think we should...” Draco panted into his open mouth. His words were barely audible, caught on an inhale of breath.
Harry had always been angry those days. Always angry and always exhausted. There were times he had been held together with nothing but caffeine and the need to do the right thing. Nothing he could do felt like it helped but he didn’t know how to do anything else.
“If they’ve done this, they could strip magic from people. They could make themselves impervious to magic like Draco saw,” Kingsley said.
Then his vision was filled with Harry’s grinning face. Harry was pouring sweat too but he looked good doing it, all tousled and glowing like a wet dream. Draco felt like a wet noodle.
“We should send Maddy a birthday present soon. I should owl Fleur about that toymaker cousin of hers,” Draco said, one morning when the house offered them a wheel of brie. Harry froze while Draco busied himself cutting a triangle of the cheese onto some crusty bread.
Having his birthday party at their place was a terrible idea. Draco should have made his excuses and begged to go to a nice restaurant. For one thing, Healers as a group tended to drink too much on nights off. For another, this party also brought the Slytherins around. They declared this his whiskey birthday.
“Lovely,” Draco says, looking at the oak shelves. The light is dim in here, and the air is stuffy. Harry coughs.
Harry didn’t think he would ever get over the fact that he could not pretend to be himself with his own face on. Harry expected Draco to sit on the other side of the table but he dropped in the booth next to Harry. The place setting was also there. Harry stared.
"No. You came back regularly, which displaced small, manageable amounts of magical energy. That was the dreams. He displaced a great deal of magical energy and shunted it into our timeline in one go and nearly killed himself doing it. We hadn't known because it was mostly theoretical and no one had ever gone for longer than an hour before this."
One would think he wouldn’t favour the son of a traitor so openly. They ought to ask Malfoy about Nott’s disappearance.” An answering whisper.
Harry stumbled down the rest of the stairs into the foyer. Their home reminded him a lot of Grimmauld Place, but cozier and less formal. He heard some muffled bickering as his mum marched up the stairs and then two sets of footsteps came down.
In the end, these were the things that ruined every adult relationship he had. They said they understood, but inevitably, it hurt their feelings. Being an Auror had made it worse. And then he chose to be alone. He stopped trying.
“And if I made fun of him, would that make him wrong?” Healer Cummins said. “If you don’t like your colleague, you think you should disregard their medical opinions without seeing the chart yourself, mmm?” Healer Cummins said. She looked at them all in turn.
Narcissa Malfoy greeted him with kisses on his cheeks at the front steps of the Manor. They had always been an affectionate family, but that was privately. Gabriel was standing in the pathway. He was a little uncomfortable with how she seemed to have changed. She was tan for their colouring. Her hair had gone white, there were lines in her face that were new and ones she wasn’t bothering to glamour.
Harry got up and scrambled around, spreading the splotches of blood around. Unsanitary. He got a glimpse of the stains all over Harry’s knees and forearm.
“But if you were gay or bisexual or trans or anything at all, Gran and I would still love you the same,” Harry said softly. That was a conversation they would have to keep having, so he left it there. Teddy gave him a hug, the kind that came rarer now he was getting a bit older.
“I can’t believe you proposed,” Draco said for the third time. He could tell Harry thought this was rude to Pansy by the sharp kick he got under the table.
"I am not. Bisexual," Draco answers neatly. This information is like a bludger to the back of the head.
“Who’s Gabe?” Harry asked and then sneezed. Draco scowled again. It really did nothing for his looks, Harry observed.
“All the friends he brought were older and strangely protective. Blaise kept saying there was something awfully familiar about them, but honestly, if a count’s son wants to bring a harem to a Sardinian villa, how is that our problem? But turns out while he’s technically a count’s son...”
“Magical maladies specialist, remember? I wouldn’t be a very good flatmate if I didn’t at least check,” Draco said. “You should lie down.”
They had fought fiercely in person the last time they saw each other. After escaping the Battle of Hogwarts and the family had sat up crying, Draco had hoped there would be some admission of guilt in general for what they had all seen. Some admission of complicity in their suffering. Instead, his father drank himself into a stupor until he was arrested three days later.
Many of his classmates went for placement in Azkaban, people who had raised their hands in lectures and talked about patient advocacy and prison conditions. Draco had never really understood how people could feel unfairness that deeply for anyone who had been the worst of wizarding society, himself included.
“That’s enough for you. You’re brooding and the barman’s looking at you like you might glass someone.”
They ate a severely under-seasoned chicken breast with a salty brown sauce and boiled veg. Harry caught Hermione’s eye and they both made a face. She tapped two fingers of her glass and gave him a tiny knowing smile.
“We know how they recruit, how they fund their activities, and even their cover stories. But we still don’t know why,” Penny added.
He spotted Hermione and Draco, looking for all the world like the beloved reigning King and Queen. The cameras turned away from him to take pictures of them, and Harry drew closer to them.
“But it’s not ours to live in, Draco. You know that.” If they remembered that, they couldn’t continue. Harry understood more than anyone else could, but they had stolen seconds, minutes and hours from themselves in these worlds. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t a good thing. And Harry felt that deeply, even if he wanted to stay here too.
Draco tried not to shiver at the casualness with which Harry treated the information. Whatever some of these groups had mixed themselves up in was more than a social club if Aurors were surveilling them.
Every single day Draco sweated hauling boxes of books up and down the stairs, reading the front pages for basic information, then sorting them in sections. He was unfamiliar with all of them. He had never, to his knowledge, read a Muggle book at all. Sometimes when he finished a particularly grueling task, he’d sit behind the counter and read passages at random until Eustace caught him.
Harry was deciding how he could ask what was okay. He was trying to prove that they could be good together and here he was, fucking it all up. He wanted too much. The trembling continued as he tried to be careful. Draco would not appreciate him ripping the buttons off his shirt.
“I’ll stand for both of you, obviously. Let’s keep your horrible cousins out of the mix, shall we?” Draco said.
Harry doesn’t hear Pansy come up behind them so there’s a pang of guilt when she chimes in a faux-chipper voice, “It’s just the first house. There’s others!” The faint edge of desperation reminds him Pansy needs this sale. She doesn't even make fun of Harry as per usual, and it makes him feel slightly terrible.
Pansy and Theo swept in together so late there was barely anyone left but their house-elves, tidying up the remaining refreshments. His mother hugged both of them, kissing the tops of their heads.
Draco tasted whiskey and warmth. It was everything he wanted. Better than he had thought. Harry was steady, steadier than Draco who nearly overbalanced himself trying to get closer. Draco pulled away.
"Get Luna to gift you one of her wall tapestries," Harry jokes. Draco snorts. He has a softer spot than anyone for her antics.
“Did you make the cake yourself?” Draco asked. Some of the piping was a bit crooked and it didn’t seem like house-elf work.
“Hermione, you can’t take care of everything else and not yourself. You’ll burn out. You saw what happened to me when I burnt out. Get some sleep.”
Her deep brown skin gleamed and her hair was always in some elaborate confection of long twists. She was as tall as Kingsley, as loud as Kingsley, and needled her husband relentlessly while he cooked.
He knew the Healing team would be back in the morning and they had set alarms, but Harry felt responsible.
Draco was exasperated as she was transparently trying to be annoying and succeeding. That and she’d eaten all his ginger chicken because she’d ordered her own food too spicy.
He gave Harry a look like he thought Harry might be tempted to take a sip from one of his cauldrons to disprove this theory.
They continued thanking people. Laid out in front of him, he could see the divide between who had faced consequences and those who had largely got away with it. Both the Goyles were there. The Parkinsons came forward together, although without Pansy. Adora Nott greeted them by herself which meant her husband wasn’t around as he wasn’t allowed to trade in Britain.  Anneliese Crabbe was by herself. There were widows everywhere but there should have been more of them. It was a nasty thing to think but he felt it.
“I’ll pay you to talk, this once,” Harry said. He sat heavily on the bed since there was nowhere else to sit, and Draco opened the balcony doors and stood. Was that the Eiffel Tower in the distance?
“I think the lager here gets worse every time I drink it,” Harry said, making a face. It was such a useless remark, meant to put Draco at ease. Draco smiled. It was brief but real.
“Leave him alone. He’s young. Of course they want to live in London,” his mum said. She pinched Harry's cheek just this side of too hard. He had seen this with the Weasleys, and he knew the expected thing was to complain about the fussing, but he couldn’t bring himself to.
All Harry can think of is the last time Harry had seen him. Through the blur of his job and his friends and their kids, he had stopped really thinking about that time in his life. He had basically forgotten, but it comes back into sharp relief.
Draco turned to Camilla Thiessen. She was dressed, as always, like she had robbed a jewelry store and then one of the peacocks from the Manor for her hat, in heavy diamond gauntlets and collar over gaudy patterned robes. Her eyeliner was caked on and crooked. Draco adored her, if only because she actually read his papers and always came prepared with a question that wasn't about profits.
Penny rolled her eyes. Harry did not miss the allusion to Draco and he avoided turning to the side to glare at him. Zacharias knew Draco had not been the one to give them this information. Just because Zacharias was a fuck up that nearly got everyone killed  didn’t mean he should blame other people.
“Well, what do you want to do, Harry?” Ginny had asked him several times. No matter where the fight started: whose turn to wash the dishes or attending a party or how long she’d be away or living somewhere other than Grimmauld, it always ended on this topic.
At present in Grimmauld Place’s kitchen, Draco was examining a strange necklace under protective spells that may or may not have anything to do with a rash of vandalism. Harry was standing and eating because Draco had taken up the entire table.  Harry was shovelling food in his mouth at a ground speed only previously recorded with Ronald Weasley during a Halloween feast.
When he was finally done hours later, there was a pile of boards and plaster all over the floor, but the whole area felt lighter somehow. He could buy paint. He could change it. Things could change for the better.
“No.” At least Benjamin didn’t look put out. He handed the chart back to Healer Cummins, who Draco belatedly realized was staring at him.
When he took the Firebird in hand again, it was with determination. One more for today. He didn’t want to search in any far universes at the moment. That had been too unfamiliar. Too much. The proximity charm meant Malfoy had been there at some point, but he couldn’t have stayed long.
“I think the term is orphans,” Draco said. He knew she mentioned Harry Potter to annoy him, though she didn’t know the details of any of their interactions on his cases. While Draco didn’t mind children he encountered in Paediatrics, he liked treating adults too.
“Mmmm, you smell like the hospital,” Harry teased. Harry lightly bit on the column of his neck and a little frisson of pleasure passed through him.
Over the next few weeks, Draco got into a routine. Every morning, he tried to make coffee, and it went badly because there was no magic. He could not cook, so whatever mess of coffee he made was his breakfast. He generally managed to make himself a sandwich for lunch.
“I don’t think I have to take leave. I can do whatever it is you need from me while I’m here,” Harry protested.
“Please go home, Potter. I have to go back to work,” Draco said finally. Harry pulled out his wand. In the split second before he cast the spell, Harry could have sworn he caught a look of raw envy, so open that Harry was almost drawn back to it.
“What do you think?” Draco lobbed back at her, despite being well aware this was not necessarily how therapy worked.
“It is,” Hermione admitted. “Put the Firebird around your neck. Then take its left wing and turn once clockwise. We find each other as quick as we can.”
“I’ll tell him.” Harry had a flashback to Remus telling him how difficult Wolfsbane had been to brew as Draco handed over the package.
Hermione would have some technical explanation for it. But the dreams didn’t happen when he stayed and did happen when he went to the other worlds. He didn’t need to have seven NEWTs to draw the conclusion the two things were related.
“I should leave,” Draco said. They walked slowly back towards the kitchen. Then it occurred to Harry that he was missing some key information.
Harry, selfishly, liked watching Draco hold babies. Draco had a natural warmth to him that came out as he cradled anyone’s child. He was patient, and made funny faces. He forgot to be so self-conscious.
“If you didn’t come back for your parents’ funeral, I could hardly expect you to come back for me.” A careless remark, that cuts Draco visibly. Harry regrets the hurt the instant it appears in the clench of Draco’s jaw, the too-hard grip of his pint glass. Harry tries to backtrack.
“It’s...it’s always nice to see you and Hermione. I’m not as much of an intellectual as you two,” Harry said, poking fun at himself. Draco frowned.
“You don’t know that for certain so why assume it?” Melinda challenged. “If you have changed, why can’t he have changed?” Draco scoffed.
Harry had a...thing about people wearing his clothes. It made his throat itch. No one should dress in someone else’s castoffs. Even if Harry was going to wear things in poor condition, it made him feel like he wasn’t taking care of the people around him when they did. He had since realized that gritting his teeth because someone borrowed his housecoat or cardigan was not typical for friends and especially not lovers.
Harry reminded himself that sitting here instead of receiving a slip was a sign of favour, and he was wasting it. He swallowed the rest of his reflexive contrariness.
“I’m alright. Same as last week. Gods, I don’t know what you and your man get up to in that flat,” Sirius waggled his eyebrows. “Maybe try to go for some walks, eh? Get some fresh air. Both you and him have been a little strange lately.”
"I'll buy you three more, " Harry promised. His voice was still sleepy, lending a rasp to it. Harry reversed their positions being careful to give Draco a way to wiggle out. Harry didn’t want him to panic. Experimentally Harry pressed into him with his hips and Draco made such a filthy needy sound that he could have been undone right then and there.
Harry shut up Grimmauld once again, but this time a little sadly. With another person, he had enjoyed being there for once. It hadn’t seemed so empty, dark and sad. But with no one to share it with, he didn’t think he would return as often. Not while he still felt all tangled up.
"I already put in the paperwork last evening." He is being pragmatic, Draco tells himself. There are rules. Harry will be fine in the long run.
“It’s either me, you or a seventy-four year old witch named Geraldine from Lancashire as far as perfect travellers,” Draco said. His joking tone was probably to set Harry at ease but it had the opposite effect. Draco read Harry’s expression when he came back into their bedroom.
Harry carried this with him in every waking moment. He would find himself writing more and more things to remember what was here and what was there. Because they were him, and he was him, and the specifics of the worlds felt different, but they had seemed the same in some important way.
"I keep wanting to ask him if he likes the new wand? I mean, Ollivander didn’t approve of me using vine as the core of a black walnut wand, but I thought it fit for him."
It was quiet for a few seconds, the air filled with the sound of Draco’s heavy breathing. Then without warning the floor shifted hard, throwing them towards the left wall. Harry threw up a shield charm before they both crashed into it. This entire area seemed delicate and Harry didn’t want them touching anything unnecessarily.
Harry and Zacharias stared each other down and then Harry claimed a desk in the living room. Penny claimed the desk beside him, which left the dining room set up for Athena and Zacharias.
“Doesn’t work. I can’t feel if it’s lined up correctly when I use magic,” Harry explained patiently. He had explained several times already.
“Also, I hit him with a stunner and it...didn’t hit him.” Draco said. “I didn’t miss. It was like he absorbed it.” Harry sat up. Hitting someone with three stunners was a little more than reasonable force, so he was going to decline to admit that to an officer of the law.
Harry also did not like Healer Blishwick’s office. For one thing, Harry expected something that looked more like an office. Instead, he was stuck in a replica of a beach house. The window showed a view of the Pacific Ocean. Every few minutes at random, wind chimes played. Even their chairs were a teak frame with a woven white hammock-style seat. The effect must be meant to be relaxing but Harry felt deeply irritated as if someone was trying to trick him.
“You covered it. Who are you? You would have died for him once!” Greg shouted. His composure had cracked. For all that they were adults, they had known each other as children. And that meant it was harder to pretend.
Draco always waited for the last person to leave. Less opportunity for him to be accidentally tripped or shoved then.
“The last part. I can shut out the rest of our meeting.” Harry cast and watched as he cut those few minutes and Draco’s eyes went blank and refocused. Harry hurried and gave him the wand back; he didn’t want Draco to realize the missing time was his fault.
The post arrived from the Ministry less than a week later. Draco had got all seven NEWTs. Seven. As many as Hermione Granger. True, he had 6 Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations because he had practiced the wrong sort of Arithmancy problems.  But it was more than good enough to be a Healer.
Harry doesn’t think he’d even have convinced Draco if not that Pansy needs to sell something as an estate agent. Anything. She has yet to manage the feat in two years.
Lee Jordan had told him later. The lily was the symbol of safe havens for Muggleborns during the War.
“I’m named after my grandfather, but he didn’t much like my father. I think my Da hoped it would make him think better of him, but it didn’t work. Also, my grandfather hated anyone who idled around reading books rather than doing something useful. So it’s a bit funny, isn’t it? Also, not good for any nicknames.”
So he knew Gregory Goyle was not one of the people who had taken the Fall as a reason to change his views.
Draco opted for the furthest wing of the house. His mother had shut up so many rooms in the interim. Now safely ensconced at home, he cast
Draco didn’t look back as they left the Pyramid. The Firebird was cool, but he would have to wait for a moment to be alone. The trip back felt shorter, and they didn’t speak again until they reached a small clearing full of army green tents. A few people poked their heads out of tents to wave.
Neville’s face had hardened when he saw Draco, but whatever the issue was, he was polite enough to give him a quick nod. Malfoy’s expression was carefully neutral. Whatever emotion he had shown Harry was strictly under control, subsumed by that blankness.
“Two dozen of the special kind with pistachios,” Harry said. She only made them around the holidays and it would annoy Ron, but they could sort that out themselves. Ron was in Ibiza on an Auror mission right now, anyway. He didn’t have to know.
“We’ve been noticing an uptick in activity for pureblood terrorist groups,” Kingsley said. Harry lifted an eyebrow. It came in waves, usually around some piece of legislation, but last he knew, nothing major had happened. He was skimming the Prophet if not reading very closely.
“I want,” Draco said, fumbling with Harry’s shirt buttons and still pressing searing kisses to his mouth.
the way he wanted while looking at Hitwizard Warbeck in a long time. He gathered his wits about him.
“Stand down, Crimson,” Kingsley said. They were supposed to keep the channels as quiet as possible just in case
Harry found himself walking through the forest alongside Draco, looking for a hill that led to a clearing or maybe a clearing that led to a hill. Draco couldn’t remember exactly, but Harry found it charming even though he was certain they might end up lost.
“I’m not going to forget,” Harry said fondly. “Although you’re welcome to remind me tomorrow.” A kiss on the cheek. “And the next day.” Another kiss pressed to Draco’s knuckles with their hands still joined. “Maybe for the next year or so.”
All in all, it’s time for a new place. The idea of living with Draco is more appealing than it is terrifying.
“I was thinking that there are universes where we’ve done this before.” Draco offered him a small private smile.
“After the War, sometimes I found I couldn't breathe either,” Draco said. The music was loud for a brief second, then quieter again as the balcony doors closed. Harry fumbled with the Firebird as his hands shook.
“In the middle of enjoying the sights, we met a wealthy Italian merchant and his wife who persuaded us to follow them to their villa for a week. You know how the old country houses are in the summer with people traipsing in and out. Opera singers, minor royalty, other merchants. One night they introduced us to a nice chap named Benedicto. Our age, but very sheltered. Have you ever heard of a fucking Italian over the age of twelve that wasn’t allowed wine at dinner?”
Pansy threw him a little party at Theo’s flat (where she practically lived) with champagne and a lemon vanilla tiered cake. Pansy told him Theo had got the flat because he was no longer welcome in Nott residence when his new stepfather was around.
“In the way that running is like fucking, Potter, sure.” Draco slashed the air and two cauldrons began pouring themselves into empty glass vials.
Harry strode into St Mungo’s at 3 pm wearing the standard-issue Auror field cloak after a twelve hour surveillance shift and asked for Healer Malfoy. The witch allowed him into Draco’s office in the family medical ward  upon seeing his badge. Draco was bent over a chart wearing silver wire-framed spectacles.
Harry rewarded him with a kiss on the cheek. Harry buried his face in his neck and sniffed deeply. Draco was going to complain about what a base, horrid thing it was to do, but unfortunately his body hadn’t got the memo and was responding in a way Harry would be well aware of.
Harry was beautiful in every way he could imagine. He seemed a bit bewildered by Draco’s insistence. But if Harry thought it was strange he didn’t say anything about it, just ‘yes’, ‘please’, ‘more’ and then brokenly, ‘Draco’.
He had bought all his partners fairy silk robes and brand new Quidditch jerseys and woven shorts without holes in them. The ones when he was really trying: Ginny, Roger, Keltie, Francis, Quinn. He had talked around his quirks—a polite euphemism for the collection of habits and beliefs he had adopted to survive. Except now it was clear to everyone else he had survived, but Harry carried on as he might not.
Draco could see the righteous indignation building up. He didn’t want to make an enemy this way. He could see what would happen when she went round to tell people how the Head Healer had punished someone for him.
He nurtured a hope that he could get all five NEWTs to be a Healer. It seemed a useful job. One where people might respect him. Where he could fix a little of the harm he had put into the word.
“Of course, Malfoy,” Harry said, attempting to match what he thought this Harry Potter would say. Maybe he should have done the Acting Society at school instead of Quidditch. Circe knew he was no good at pretending to be himself.
“Was he supposed to wear a top on a beach on vacation?” Harry asked, watching Neville flick water off his hair in a loop. He had the lightning scar. It looked better on him.
Why did it sound like Kingsley was apologizing to him? Kingsley reached into his desk and handed him a card for a mind healer.
Harry felt distinctly unwell himself, but he was suddenly glad he’d kept up seeing Healer Blishwick. All the implications hit him and he narrowed his focus to the exact colour of the living room flooring for five breaths before the feeling returned to his hands.
Harry desperately wished he had an excuse. After his first owl checked that Draco was well, he didn’t know how to respond to Draco’s last message. Gideon nipped him for his trouble.
“The funny thing is that a lot of people are acting like the world is changed but it really hasn’t. Minister Steel can tell us that we are all reconciled, and filthy beasts are just as good as wizards, and being a mudblood doesn’t matter. But I know that’s not true, and you used to as well,” Greg said calmly.
“I’m Valerie.” She shakes his hand firmly, but her smile is bright. “Is this your first time in Montreal?”
They dropped the subject, but Draco let Harry walk him to the apparition point. Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s too quick for him to react, too quick for Harry to pull him closer.
Harry cast for a far universe. He couldn’t be sure why because he had been sticking mostly close. But he thought he should see a far universe to know if his theory was correct. He had an inkling about the pattern all the universes formed.
He had known there was a reason he was an only child but not the details. They never discussed things like that with him.
“Children should be spoiled, Harry.” Draco continued, oblivious. Harry put his hand over Draco’s right at the kitchen table.
A Falcons pennant, Slytherin banner, and a silver clock with the family crest are the only things that hang on his bedroom wall. He wishes there were some other sign of his personality, like a piece of art or a book that wasn’t from the family library.
“That’s not the point. You can’t just call me up at any time to do shit for you. I don’t work here anymore. You promised me I would be done and walk away from this. I don’t have missions or duty or service. I don't owe anyone anything.”
He had to live like a Muggle for five years. That’s all. He would rather not, but it was a far cry from what his imagination came up with.
“We thought it only had to do with muggleborns and Dark objects. But it doesn’t make sense because that’s not all they are doing,” Harry exclaimed.
The Firebird reminded him of a paper crane made of steel. It was a beautiful contraption, and if he looked closely, he could see the morning light playing on it. At its heart was a bright white glow, like the centre of a flame. It looked like some sort of mechanical art piece from the Louvre more than a practical device. It dimmed somewhat while he held it, and he looped the chain around his neck.
Kingsley had put his hand over his eyes and was breathing hard. Harry sat in the chair in front of him.
"Hm," Harry says, as if he is seriously considering the merits of Swiss universities. "This is not very pragmatic of you."
They hadn’t had sex like this during their fling. It was always hurried, rough and a little desperate. Harry didn’t want that. Harry rode him with a slow deliberate drag like he had nowhere else to be. Harry wasn’t surprised when Draco got frustrated, pulled out, reversed their positions and slid in again, hot, fast, and perfect. Draco kept one hand on Harry’s cock. He pulled Harry chest to chest, kissed him deep and filthy and rolled his hips as if he was trying to get even deeper, then Harry was coming with lightning zipping up his spine and behind his eyelids. Draco didn’t slow down for even a half second, coming inside him as Harry was still shaking through the last aftershocks of his own orgasm.
The first caller he had was Gregory Goyle the next morning. There were no house-elves now since they fled during the War, so he received Greg in the solar after answering the front door. Draco felt uneasy greeting him, and that feeling didn’t abate as they spoke. They talked about the fine autumn weather, some news Draco had missed, the upcoming Greengrass-Zabini wedding and other schoolmates. Then the conversation shifted.
Harry seems furious the moment they are drawn together. Draco is not surprised. He had been thinking of the last bond curse when this happened. The guilt warring with the practicality, the way Harry had gulped down air after he came, the satisfaction that Harry wasn't immune to him. No doubt the image had inspired their current predicament.
“You’re going to tell me that you suddenly understand the arithmancy underpinning parallel universes? We can’t map the universe we live in. We don't know the future. You don’t know that,” Draco said.
When Kingsley invited Harry to dinner with his wife Patience about nine months into his leave by Owl, Harry figured it would be good to show he was doing better.
“It has,” Harry agreed. When he turned his attention to Draco he realized why. Where Hermione and Draco clasped hands here, they wore matching silver wedding bands. Without him, his stomach lurched at the idea.
Really, how was Harry supposed to respond to that less than twenty-four hours after he had kissed Draco? It was probably fifty kinds of ethical misconduct, and Draco wasn’t even a suspect. Harry didn’t know whether he could find it comforting that Kingsley was Head Auror and had done the same thing. Not that it would stop him.
Draco’s hair was mussed, his lips were red, and his pale neck already had faint pink marks where Harry’s teeth had presumably been. Harry’s Firebird did not glow.
“You brought him home to me, and that’s all that matters,” she said finally. Narcissa was beautiful but not nearly as cold as he remembered. She had lovely crow’s feet, a sprinkling of freckles across her nose and the same eyes as Draco.
“Yeah. Yeah. I’ve got you.” They both carefully laid flat, with Harry wrapping his arms around Draco’s calves. Draco’s chest was hanging over the edge and remembering how deep the chasm went, Harry tightened his grip.
He appreciates that the flat is very Muggle, although Harry’s concession to him is that it’s well-appointed. He appreciates the haphazard piles of paper, the photos of Teddy and a canvas Luna painted for a housewarming present. He sees the little wizarding knickknacks Pansy bought them on her travels. This is his home now.
Harry expected to dream of the war. However, this was unfamiliar and unsettling. He couldn’t remember a single dream that vivid in years. He laid awake until it seemed ridiculous not to get up and do something else. Candles lit as he walked down the hall and down the stairs.
Draco was sitting up, pale against white silky sheets. He was awake and the most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen, even bruised and cut. Draco spotted his mother first and smiled at her.
Draco didn’t let Harry look around to figure out what kind of flat they lived in together. Draco dragged him up the stairs and kissed him. Harry gave in to the feeling. After an evening like this one, it was hard to even think about what he should do. He wouldn’t let it get too far, but Draco’s mouth against his jaw was a revelation. He tasted faintly of anise, lemon and beer.
Well, Draco certainly hoped so. After they slammed the door, Draco decided no matter what, he needed to get out of there. There was a dull ache in his chest and the little wandless magic he could manage wouldn’t come to him anymore.The pain in his wrists was duller than what he’d recently experienced, so he slowly started to pull at the ropes.
He had kissed Draco slow and reverent once they stumbled into the foyer of Grimmauld Place. Kissed him all the ways he knew how, then trailed smaller presses of his lips against Draco’s cheek, his neck, the solidness of his sternum. His hands had wandered, thumbs in the dip of his back, fingers spread. Draco had let out a long sigh. At the time it felt like surrender, but in retrospect it could have been relief.
“Yes,” Draco says automatically. His reflex has always been to make everything seem fine. Then he changes his mind. “No. I—I’m not. It was difficult being back there. I knew it would be.”
This was unethical. It was highly unethical. He was not the Harry that this Draco had an arrangement with, no matter how many inches of skin he exposed on his thighs. Whether money changed hands, which he wasn't quite clear on.
"Ah..." Healer Ahmed waits a long moment before saying, "I don't advise it, but if you were to consummate the bond, it would still be reversible."
“Leave him alone,” Draco said. Before he thought about it, he hooked an arm around Harry’s shoulder and pulled him closer and away from Blaise. Blaise smirked in a way that said he knew exactly what Draco had been thinking and left.
“Have you eaten dinner?” Harry asked, bypassing Draco’s ability to derail even the simplest conversation.
They are at St Mungo's yet again, with another Healer. Healer Smythe is competent, but with the bedside manner of a frozen turnip.
“I’ll walk you. You were heading in the wrong direction,” Draco muttered. Chike returned with a small hand towel and a black t-shirt with the name of the bookshop, a size too small, but Harry took it anyway, dried his torso a little and changed quickly. She handed him a branded tote bag for his wet shirt.
“My friend Chike illustrated them,” Draco said. Draco rubbed the back of his neck and looked at the ground.
,” Draco said, his tone sharp and hostile. He ducked his head immediately after as if he had got out the habit of responding meanly and didn’t know what to do with himself.
“I’ve got guest bedrooms if you’d like,” Harry said. Draco took off his shirt and trousers unceremoniously in Harry’s bedroom. The room felt hotter and smaller than it had just seconds ago.
“To be clear, I’m not asking you about whichever of the half dozen groups that keeps trying to recruit you. We have information on them all, and I know you’re not involved, so I don’t need it.”
“Yeah, sorry,” the Captain chimed in. Mud streaked her from head to toe, and it took him a minute to figure out which of the Slate triplets he was looking at, although only Cadence was on his team. Sometimes they liked to switch.
It was a gentle remark from her as if she had sensed the significance of him asking. They talked about what it had been like for Harry, the only biracial kid in his school in Surrey. Incidents as an adult, too. Hermione knew. She had plenty of her own stories. How shocked she had been to come to the wizarding world and find out there was yet another thing she couldn't help that people despised her for. The way people sometimes spoke loud and slow or played guessing games about where they thought they might be from. Trouble was that Harry had wanted so desperately to know where he was from. Here was one more piece.
. Draco tasted good, he tasted right, sliding his mouth over his. It had been so long since he felt even a shadow of this desire for someone. This felt specific; it couldn’t have been about anyone.
“You have to buy me dinner first. Good night,” Draco answered. Was that flirting? Was Draco flirting with Harry or was he messing with him?
Aunt Andromeda came in late. She wore a black silk Muggle dress and made no concessions to a traditional funeral otherwise. She was unadorned and stood out among the peacock feather hats and heavy heirloom necklaces and brooches encrusted with jewels. But she had shown up at all. Looks and whispers followed her around the room.
“Paedetrics if you’d like to keep on with your shiny new redeemed image,” Pansy continued. “You could go work in that foundling home they named after Saint Potter.”
“Hi Hermione. Hello Minister,” Harry said. If he smiled a little, it was because he knew what was next.
“I went on my Grand Tour with Blaise Zabini. We started in Italy since one of us spoke the language and we both wanted to get far enough away that no one could report back. We were sixteen. Father wouldn’t have minded the drinking and gambling halls, but he didn’t like the political salons. Too many radicals, actors, practicing out-of-wedlock homosexuals...” Here Draco winked.
Harry wanted a home like this. He finally realized why Ginny had asked him to go to shops with her on their weekends off to pick new dishes when they already had dishes.
“I don’t have any names that would help you, ” Draco continued. Harry was rather impassive. It was impossible to know what he was thinking. Harry kept those green eyes trained on him like he wanted something but hadn’t decided what.
Draco led him through a few twisting hallways until they ended up in a dark room barely wide for them both. Harry cast a floating orb of light and it left them both in chiaroscuro, their shadows long and lean on the wall.
Harry knew what the patterns meant without going to his notes. He should have known where the Firebird would drop him next.
No. Harry is mostly stung by the realization he had over-invested in Draco Malfoy to such an extent. He shrugs again. "You have every right to go looking for another partner. I imagine it would be uncomfortable to realize that your coworker harboured inappropriate thoughts about you."
Embarrassingly, Harry had idly wondered why she worked in Special Crimes if she seemed so fragile. Penny sat him down, made a cup of tea splashed with whiskey and waited with him. She was silent, but it was a warm comfortable silence while Harry kept having to remember he was anchored in a human body. She had a resilient, flexible strength he had mistaken for weakness.
He startled awake, even though this dream seemed more benign than the others. This fucking case. It was getting to him. He rubbed his face hard. Harry tried to hold on to the dream, but the details slipped away like trying to catch wind in a sieve.
“I’ve got Harry, Malfoy Manor,” the woman said, speaking into her wrist. The fuck she did. He stunned her, but nothing happened and within seconds two more people had arrived. Draco was lying peacefully on the grass.
Draco tilts his head to the side. There is something about the way this creature feels that abruptly lets him know she...
Draco found a broken nose was really quite a lot more blood than anyone wanted outside their body for a minor injury. He pinched the bridge of his nose to try to get something to clot.
"Look, we just want to know if you've seen anything," Draco says, his palms upturned. He has stowed his wand because he knows from experience many magical creatures hate them. Her shoulders relax a fraction.
“Everything?” Harry asked, running his fingers over the smooth wood. He had done this a fair few times as an Auror.
“A present,” Draco said, pulling out a package from his bag. Harry looked at him. They had already sent money to Rose’s trust. They had discussed his propensity for generous and unnecessary presents. He was still not over the fact Draco had bought Teddy a brand new Firebolt without telling him.
Draco had been offered a floo directly into the Headmaster’s quarters but that seemed like too much to deal with all things considering. Instead, he apparated into Hogsmeade and walked across the fields and towards the castle.
“It’s allowed in an emergency. It just makes my feelings very...confusing,” Draco said, half to himself. Draco took off the glasses and dropped them on the table. He rubbed his temples, then walked towards the living room. Harry followed, as if they were not in his house.
“Watch your spells for a while. Start simple,” Gabe said. He handed Draco his wand and Draco found himself overwhelmed with the idea of casting anything at all. He stuck it in his pocket instead.
"I should have known by the robes," Yannick said, still smiling. Draco was wearing black brocade but the underlayer was definitely a matching emerald green. It wasn't like he had done it consciously. But he liked the way they looked at the last one, Harry in midnight blue with gold stars, Draco in a matching gold just a shade away from gaudy. The picture was still on his dresser.
“Remember there have been Potters in Godric’s Hollow since the sixteenth century. It was the first Black Wizarding community in the UK. It’s important that we keep it alive,” his father said.
Harry gave Draco a hand up. Amazing what not lying on a hardwood floor and bleeding could do for your mood. Draco led Harry to his bedroom, under markedly different circumstances than he might have hoped.
All at once, all the spells were released and Draco lay on the floor breathing hard. All this to remake the world.
“The last one. It felt too strange to be in universes where there wasn’t a War or where I was too different,” Draco said.
“Thank you,” Draco said into Harry’s ear. His breath on his ear tickled. Harry peered at his own chest. No colours. Still hot to the touch. He would have to say something before he leapt out of this universe.
Draco was sure his face was flaming Weasley red. He didn’t expect to be made an object lesson for their morning huddle. All he tried to do was keep his head down and qualify.
Andromeda stared at a lesser Rosier cousin who had clearly been eavesdropping and turned her back to him. For someone who had left the pureblood inner circle decades ago, Aunt Andromeda still knew how to deliver a cut direct. The cousin scampered away.
He wore long khakis and a long shirt with an obvious holster for his wand. Thank fucking Merlin. He didn’t think he could cope again without magic and in a strange place. Also, he was certain he had cast a cooling charm inside his clothes.
“Turn counterclockwise,” Hermione said. They both pulled the wing back to centre and stumbled back into their bodies at the Ministry.
Harry asked Hermione about the other universes in a roundabout way because otherwise, she pursed her lips in that unhappy way of hers. She didn’t want him to dwell, Harry thought. But it was impossible not to dwell.
"Why would anyone be to blame?" Harry says. "There's a new place down the road I'd like to try tomorrow morning."
“So he broke your nose?” Harry said. One would think Harry was completely unfamiliar with the concept of violence.
“No, I am happy when you try. No matter the result. Ground drills, and then we’re done for the day.”
“Why do you think that was important to tell me?” She asked. Her cardigan today was a sunshine yellow with a tiny smiling cartoon dog pin.
Good, Harry wasn’t the only one surprised, as evidenced by the incredibly stilted conversation they were having.
It disappointed him that it seemed like there were no universes where he wasn’t like this, perpetually caught up in some past. Draco was rubbing his shoulders to try to give him comfort.
“I think we got confused because of what happened over there,” Draco said. “Did you see how it was with Hermione?”
He had this argument with his friends in reverse when he bought his cottage. All his friends had tried to get him to be closer to them in the summer. They had wanted him to move closer to wizarding communities, or in a bigger city at least. Not because you couldn’t apparate or Floo, but because it was harder to do impromptu dinners or casual hangouts—out of sight, out of mind.
“Malfoy, you’re not getting off scot-free, but you do now have more information than the rest of the department on this project so I’d like you to share it.”
The longer he stood there the more he recognized that borrowed feeling wasn’t a general distaste for Malfoy as he might have imagined. It was longing. The ache in his chest wasn’t his own, but it didn’t lessen looking directly at Draco.
he didn’t want any part of in this world or the next, so he barrelled forward, with Draco behind him.
Sirius regaled him with tales from long motorbike rides he had done along the Aegean Sea. Next summer Sirius was planning to do another road trip across Estonia.
“You bastard!” Pansy lunged for him and Draco waited until the last minute to dodge and then slung her over his shoulder.
“I need to lean over farther, laying flat over the edge,” Draco said, looking back at Harry with a serious expression. Harry could see the light reflecting in Draco’s eyes.
Inside, at least, the cottage was cozy. It wasn’t until Ron pointed it out during his last visit that he realized it kind of looked like the Gryffindor common room with overstuffed sofas, macrame hangings and plush red carpeting. Oh well.
Somehow, he hadn’t believed they would allow him to walk away, but they released the magical restraints and the same officer walked him back to a side room where his mother paced.
Every once in a while Harry looked for him and watched him. He nursed the one beer all night but otherwise looked at home here, among Harry’s family and friends. They wore no rings, but Draco knew what to do when he panicked. This couldn't be casual.
“In other universes, he could break it off with Hermione. He could cheat on her. Harry could have stopped the wedding.”
“Welcome back, Mr. Malfoy. I trust you’ve studied hard,” Headmistress McGonagall said. Draco scanned her face for some hint of reproach but she seemed genuinely pleased to see him.
So he did. During his evenings, he learned to turn on and then watch television even though he understood none of the shows, wrote to his mother, and read something until it was about time for bed. When he couldn’t stand to be idle, he would do push-ups in his bedroom until his arms gave out.
“Mr. Warbeck.” Draco inclined his head slightly, with his hands behind his back clasped firmly at the elbows. It was an old Pureblood gesture of respect, but he fell back on those manners when he had nothing else.
“The place is a wreck,” Draco says. His voice is creaky and faint with disuse. He hasn’t spoken to anyone since he left this morning.
“Her sister Ruth also lost her husband. I tried to help. She shut me out because I reminded her too much of Dorcas,” Kingsley said. Harry had never seen Kingsley look so defeated.
“I was. They were annoying, you know?” Here Draco smiled faintly at the memory. “I had forgotten how annoying they could be. Constantly hovering, asking for an update on everything I did or ate. If I didn’t write every other day, my father would write a dramatic letter. My mother asked a lot of prying questions about how I meant to get heirs of my body to satisfy their last will and testament when she wasn’t asking about restoring the Malfoy name.” Here he laughed, recalling their exact words. “They were absolutely terrible but I missed them. It made it easier to think that I could let them go,” Draco said.
In his universe, he was older than they had ever got to be. Here he could see both of them in him as an adult. More James in the softness of his mouth and the corner of his eyes. More Lily in that habit of smoothing his hand over his hair, as she did now.
“I can write the letter for you. And they should accept you if I write it. It’s at least something,” Harry said.  If Draco let his pride rule him, he would have strode back into Diagon Alley. But this time, practicality stayed his hand. His heart picked up tempo a little. A letter from Harry Potter would mean something to the Board.
The International Association of Defense Practitioners and Researchers is having their annual conference. Canada was chosen to host this year. In the middle of August, it’s hotter than it is back home, sweat sticking his shirt to his back. Harry’s happy at least that he’s opted for shorts instead of trousers.
“You could quit,” Harry told him. Draco wasn’t the type, too loyal, but Harry could put the idea in his head.
“Experimenting?” Kingsley said. He didn’t sound as skeptical as Harry would have thought as they gathered in the living room of the safehouse facing Athena’s chart.
Harry came back with the champagne, face stormy and back rigid. Draco had only seen his current expression previously during a Quidditch match. Draco must’ve been completely dulled by the sensory processing of being around Harry all the time because he realized three things all at once: One, Yannick was very close and still had a hand on his shoulder. Two, Yannick was kind of hot, objectively speaking. And third of all, Harry was Not Pleased.
Bill sat them both down in his tent. They gave him an account of the afternoon. Harry thought it would be unfair to blame Draco for not seeing the last rune since he was largely useless, so he glossed over that part as they took turns. Bill pinched the bridge of his nose, though he didn’t seem upset with them.
“Pansy has already done one scandalous thing. She’ll get married in the forest by Parkinson Place like the rest of them,” Draco chimed in.
That night he dreamt that he was in his quarters at Hogwarts and it was gradually filling with ice-cold water. The waves lapped over his desk, over his kitchen and his dining table.
“There’s nothing to know! Just because she was your partner doesn’t mean that we’re anything to each other. I never met her! I never wanted to meet you! I’m not an Auror!” Athena was yelling. Then a long silence.
Draco was familiar with that face. The “I have secrets I can’t share because of my job” face Harry was sporting. He’d always figured Greg was a suspect but it was confirmed.
“Do you want to get out of here?” Draco asked him. “Come if you’re up for it, Hermione. Last time was fun.”
Pansy came by a few days later with Theodore Nott. Draco was a little unsettled. He didn’t know Theo well, but from her letters nowadays Pansy came as a package deal. Draco had been that way with her once, but it had been five years.
“He had a funny way of showing it,” Draco said. He desperately wanted to stop the torrent of resentment because it seemed inappropriate, but it was picking up speed the more he thought about it. He thought he’d finished it during his emergency therapy appointment but resentment was a bottomless hungry thing.
“The lab is unstable!” Draco calls to Harry, who is sprinting toward the fire. Draco knows Harry is reckless. He has shown that more than enough times in Auror training. Even now years later, as a Senior Auror, Harry is often the first into an active situation.
“That’s up to you,” Harry said. Harry would give him a single point in all this, which is once Draco understood, all bets were off. Draco firmly grabbed the lapels of Harry’s jacket and pulled him closer. Draco’s slate-grey eyes were boring into Harry’s.
Azkaban was damp, acrid smelling and dismal, but at least there were no Dementors now. The most conversation Draco had was with the wizard who handed him a tasteless grey nutritional paste disguised as oatmeal three times a day. Something about the complete lack of scent made him think they laced it with enchantments and potions. Probably meant to make him docile. He ate it anyway. He had several long, pointless conversations with his Ministry-assigned lawyer.
There was an immediate tension in the air as he fell into this world. Scars covered his body if his hands and arms were any indication. He was dirty, his hair was falling into his eyes, and he felt bone-tired.
“It’s for you. It’s a gift. A gift for you. Because you like that sort of thing. I’m not implying anything.”
“And what then? I run around trying to locate him by blind luck?” Harry asked. Did she seriously not have some protocol?
With overwhelming pride, Draco flashed a little wallet photo of that same blond, chubby-faced boy Harry had seen. Scorpius grinned and waved. "We went to Brighton this week." Harry had never thought about Draco much, but he had especially never thought about what he’d be like as a father. Draco seemed good at it. Harry wondered if he was any good at being a dad.
The floors are still a warm maple, with a scorch mark where he’d dropped a candle while reading at night. The wood matches the shelves all lined up with Hogwarts textbooks and the writing desk that had been a replica of his grandfather’s. Draco leans over his desk to open the window and it glides open like it has been waiting for his return. He can see even more of the wildness of the land from this vantage point. Yellow and brown have overtaken everything; it is all dead or dying.
“You were getting serious,” Ron said. It was a statement and not a question, but Harry nodded. That much was true on his end, no matter how Draco really felt. He should have pressed him.
Whatever she is, she has taken the form of a elderly woman but something is off about her eyes. They glitter too brightly. She moves too quickly. She feels like too much magic is contained in her body.
"Desjardins and I went into our Potions mastery together. He’s a mediocre brewer, completely lacking imagination. Too confident despite that. Maybe I'd call him if I wanted someone to fuck my wife."
When he landed back at Grimmauld for the next world, the house was different. The wallpaper was light grey. The floors were shiny. Everything around him was sleek and modern, a mix of Muggle and Wizarding appliances. He walked up to the pantry doors and saw a photo of him and Ginny with three small children, all jumping in a puddle in matching yellow wellies.
“I would be fascinated to know which way you could have possibly meant it. From now on, Potter and Meadowes will be on field duty. Smith and Clearwater will be on support. All seven bombs were powered by Dark artefacts. Find out how.”
Maybe it was that day or the day after. His team had been working on a series of break-ins at old Wizarding homes. All of the families had young children, too young for Hogwarts. They hid behind skirts and couches when Harry went to go visit. Some ran up, bold as brass, to ask if he was really Harry Potter.
He felt bereft, even though Draco still stood in front of him. Then Draco stepped closer to Harry and tilted his chin upwards with two fingers.
“Everything about this is bizarre. You fancy him, but that’s different from deciding...I don’t know what you’ve decided, but you’re always intense about it,” Ron said.
“Sure. But she started to notice her mum’s reaction and started avoiding me too. I gave her space. Wrote her and got no replies. After she was thirteen I didn’t see her again until career day at Hogwarts. Her professors recommended her in sixth year for Auror training. She refused.”
Still, Draco tries not to think too hard about why it feels like he’s lost something when finally, he can unhook his bare ankle from Harry’s.
Harry fidgeted with the glass case. "To answer your question from earlier, I come to you because...I like sharing happiness with you. And I always feel like we um, expressed that in a way that I realised might be confusing? And we are friends. And I like you a lot?" The last part was definitely not planned, and Draco whipped his head up as if to confirm what he just heard.
“Extended travel visa access and a better seat than the Americans at the next Wizarding Nations meeting hosted in Europe,” Hermione said. Draco snorted.
“Pretty good,” Draco said. He forgot all his defenses against Harry’s closeness now that he was near. He should be used to all of this. Harry’s gaze on him. How naturally affectionate he was with everyone, leaning closer to Draco like it was nothing.
“No, I can’t leave you here. I remember Budapest. You’ll go eat at some tourist trap of a brewpub and end up going to bed at eight,” Michael says. Harry had already looked up one that looked like a short walk down Sainte-Catherine street.
The team circled him on the ground of the pitch, soaked in sweat and the unrelenting cold fine mist that Hogwarts usually had in the autumn.
Reciting the facts, as terrible as they were, reassured him. Dragonpox was only supposed to be dangerous to children and the elderly. You could add extra willow bark to a standard pain potion on the early stages, Draco thought. But it must have been too late to suppress the fever. He would have hallucinated before his organs failed one by one.
She reached a hand out to cup his chin like he was a boy again and her eyes were brimming with tears.
It was dark and the space was small and he was trapped and they were going to—no. Draco shook his head. He felt around the room he was in blindly. It was a room and not a cupboard. If he kept his breathing deep and even, the fabric on his head wasn’t so bad. They might hurt him but they were giving him time. Time meant he could think.
Yannick made a pained expression and leaned in. "Let's just say, a lot of people here think mind healing is a form of advanced coddling and that it would be better if people just toughened up."
“You’re a brilliant researcher and you worked on this project for years. Why would you just throw it all away?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco said, standing up from his chair. Greg stood too. Draco belatedly realized that Greg was taller than him and had exercised in the intervening years with weights.
“No, nothing. I feel fine,” Harry said. Draco’s intense expression knocked whatever air Harry had managed to keep in his lungs.
Both departments were public facing and the worst possible choice for someone like him as he would rather die (again) than talk to the media or politicians.
They had met up in a nice restaurant in Covent Garden that Draco assuredly could not afford anymore. Blaise had a way of being generous without making it seem like an obligation, so they drank wine, fed each other oysters and laughed.
“I have the strangest headache and I’ve forgotten what I was saying a moment ago,” Draco said. He picked up the cigarette from where it had dropped and burned a hole in the carpet. Harry waved a wand to fix the scorch mark.
Three hooded men in black robes caught him walking during his lunch break in the hallway outside of the lunchroom. He wasn’t practiced at using defensive magic anymore. He stunned one and broke another one’s nose throwing a decent jab. But soon enough they converged on him and bound his hands. One fumbled in his pocket for a small coin. A portkey shouldn’t work in St Mungo’s but this one did.
This time the first sensation Harry became aware of was overwhelming heat. He was sweating lightly as if even his own body recognized giving up too much water in this environment would be foolhardy. There was a crisp blue sky as far as he could see and endlessly blowing beige sand.
Draco hops down from the counter to fold her into his arms.“None of that,” he says sternly, but it’s with the utmost care that he pulls out a handkerchief and swipes at her tears.
When she turned her face back to Harry, he felt a shock. Lily Evans Potter’s eyes were exactly the same shade of green as his, just as people told him his whole life. She looked a little like Aunt Petunia now she was older, truth be told, but with softer features and auburn hair framing her face in a sharp bob.
“Everything seems fine,” Draco said. Harry dropped his shirt but didn’t miss the way Draco watched him do it, with a slow heat.
“Don’t put too much pepper, dear. The boy doesn’t have an iron cauldron for a stomach like you do,” Patience said. She elbowed Harry conspiratorially, grinning widely. Harry sat on their couch, holding his mug of tea. Her smile and laugh was contagious.
“If I thought there was any other way, I would never have called you Harry. I hope you know that,” Kingsley said as Harry left.
So Harry pulled the offered plate towards him. They both silently ate part of each other’s meal. The food was excellent. Tastier than anything Harry had eaten lately, even the stuff that wasn’t Waitrose Ready Meals.
“If you were to run, where would you go?” Harry asked instead, curious. He didn’t think it could help, but this was a Draco if not his Draco.
“He made a choice,” Harry said. “I’m making a choice here. My choice is you. For as long as you'll have me.”
Harry had been avoiding interfering with other universes’ Harrys but maybe it was time to interfere a little.
Theo laughed. Draco could see Harry’s confidence crumble a tiny bit as he was unsure whether he was the subject of the joke.
He had corresponded with Headmistress McGonagall, who agreed to allow him to take his NEWTs without attending once he returned. There was only a year and a half to go. He would need some time to study. No magical materials and no wand meant there was not much he could do at the moment. At least, now he was sleeping, the tremor in his hands had subsided.
Harry made it back to Grimmauld before hopping back to his world. It was important, somehow, that they were close to each other in these worlds. That was the key difference in his world and there. Draco was something closer to a tertiary character in his life now.
“You always found that kind of thing boring, sorry,” he said to Harry while Hermione flagged down another glass of champagne.
Harry’s floo activated and Harry was met with Draco. He was wearing Muggle clothes which Harry hadn’t realized Draco wore at all. He was very casual in some sort of jeans and a grey henley with the sleeves rolled up and those glasses again. He had always assumed that Draco kept the Mark hidden as it would have faded, but he had covered it with a solid band of black.
“Well, he implied that the Post-War changes were all temporary and soon it would go back the way it was with....” here he made a gesture. With Pansy and Theo, Draco used
reminders of my past as well,” Another wizard on the panel said. Draco fought the urge to grab his left forearm reflexively. It was covered. They couldn’t have seen it. The only people who were even sure he had the Mark were dead or in Azkaban. He bowed politely and left. He couldn’t afford to—
“Or else I have to figure out how to charge you and get the incompetent fuckers in the Auror department involved. Sorry Harry,” Hermione added as an afterthought.
“Draco?” Gabe said. “I’m not supposed to ask, but owl me if you ever want to go to the pub together. For a drink or something. But only if you want.” Gabe was uncharacteristically tongue-tied.
The second time, Harry is well and truly pissed off before they even get to St Mungo’s. The perpetrator escaped, but not before flinging a cursed jewellery box at both of them. It hit because they were both distracted. Draco’s attention was taken up with keeping the walls from collapsing on top of them. Harry was distracted by Draco, and that’s nearly unforgivable.
"Now Draco, that's no way to refer to the Monegasque royals," Hermione said with a bit of tease in her voice. Draco grinned then, so happy it lit up his face.
“Not exactly. There are patterns to how you jump. It’s a shorter jump to universes that are like ours, and a longer one to universes that aren’t. If we cast for a close, it’s more likely to be one that seems somewhat familiar.”
Sometimes they had forgotten him entirely and everyone would have a new inside joke he wasn’t privy to next time he came around. One day he’d shown up to some dinner and Blaise had joined their group. No one thought it was strange, but no one could explain either. Harry didn’t mind so much though. He could stand a little loneliness for some privacy.
“I need to—you don’t know me,” Draco said. Harry knew he was trying to be reasonable. “I don’t know you. We bonded over an experience no one else has. Think about this for a second.”
