Harry looks at him. "Keep the collar on," he says, and Draco takes that for the permission it very clearly is, and smiles.
Draco shakes his head. “No, sir,” he says again. His little cock jumps at the shame of it.
"It's fine," Draco says. "She loves you. Has she definitely gone?"
For a while, they watch the sea. It’s relatively calm out there, if cold, and Draco refreshes the warming charm on the blanket, and on him, and on Harry. It gets rid of the worst of the chill.
"I know you want me to treat you like you're not there, or like you're nothing," Harry says quickly, Their corner of the hamburger restaurant is quiet for a minute. "But that's like-- that's when we're having sex. You don't think like that in real life, do you?"
"Draco."
Harry has at least the grace to blush. "If it makes you feel any better, she made fun of me the whole time. Hermione did as well, if it helps."
"Even though what I want is dirty as fuck."
routine, and to be honest Draco's just glad to fade into the background.
"Property of the House of Potter," Harry says. "For a start."
Harry doesn't bother asking him if he wants tea, just pours him a cup and pushes it across the table. The milk isn't in a jug, just in a small plastic carton with TESCO on the front.
"All right," Draco says.
. "Sometimes I do it right in the office, or in the sitting room. I don't always make it to the bedroom."
Harry looks up at him, chewing on his lip, hand on his dick. "I'd like," he says, and Draco nods.
"I am," Draco says. He adjusts his waistcoat.
Draco bends over the bowl and nips at the first piece of cake with his teeth. He gets sugar on his nose from where he bumps up against the rest of the piled up cake pieces. Shame rattles through him. It feels so good, being down here on his hands and knees, eating from the floor like an animal, Harry watching him. He gobbles up half the bowl with ease, bits of cake on his nose and his cheeks, sticking to the come that Harry had left there in the hall. He even gets some on his eyelashes.
"What a useless little cock," Harry says, fingers catching in Draco's hair. "So fucking worthless. Just like you."
"I was a superior little snot," Draco says. There's a pause. "And I wanted so desperately to be your friend. Not then, when I didn't know who you were. But as soon as I did."
"Well. It's not like we've been massively great at the whole, you know, defining what this is thing. We're still not great at it now."
"I never used to think of it at all," Harry says, and it shouldn't hurt, but it does. He turns to look at Draco. "I've never been as obsessed with anyone in my whole life as I was with you, you know. Well," he tilts his head, a weird sort of sideways nod. "Except for Voldemort."
Harry comes up behind him and rests his chin on Draco's shoulder, turning him so that they're both looking into the mirror. Harry smells like someone else, like he just got fucked by someone else.
Harry suggests that he and Draco come to a business arrangement.
Draco, for want of anything better to say or do, responds with a clipped nod.
Harry curls into Draco’s side, and wraps an arm around his chest. “And what if I need to call you Piglet all weekend and put you on the lead?”
"I don't care. I'll do it."
"I know," Harry says. "You think I don't know that?" There's a pause. "Take all your clothes off. Show me both your holes in turn. Remind me of your value."
Draco prides himself on being able to go down on his knees and not wear his trousers out.
"Good," Harry says. "Just how I like it."
"They weren't hidden," Draco says, but he knows he's gone pink. A whole box of chocolates, just for him. It's greedy.
Draco's already removed his clothes, methodical and precise, and has got into bed and pulled the covers up whilst Harry had excused himself to the bathroom. Even given everything that they've done together, and even knowing that if requested, Draco will humiliate himself in almost any way that Harry can think of, outside of that, he's still bound by same rules he's always lived by, of modesty and carefully constructed social graces, and that includes getting into bed with one's… one's boyfriend. Lover. He and Harry exist firmly within four walls; he's no idea how to take the two of them out into the wider world and define them accordingly. For now, he will accept the humiliation and have it sit carefully next to the rest of his polite, quietly ordered life. Up to and including covering himself up in bed when he's not wearing his pyjamas.
"It's Gryffindor red," Draco tells him, still playing with his hair. Harry seems to like it. "Gryffindors are brave, aren't they? You can be my brave boy today."
"Shame," Harry says. "And there you were, showing me your hole like you weren't untouched."
There's a whole packet of mini Battenbergs in there. Draco licks his lips, mouth watering. He glances at Harry.
Harry, his Harry, keeps on touching him, stroking his skin, running his fingers through Draco's hair, outlining the lines of his harness, running his thumb over Draco's collar. Draco trembles, trying to press closer.
"Draco," Harry says. "It's all right. Go to sleep. We'll talk about it another time."
"Blue."
"I didn't know you'd be coming in," Draco says, "otherwise I would have tidied up after myself."
He's masturbating his cocklet, kneeling on his kitchen floor, on his hands and knees whilst his boyfriend ignores him and treats him like he's nothing, and it makes Draco want to come. It makes him want to come all over the cake.
Oh. Draco's lost in that for a moment. He's so lost in Harry that he's assumed it's obvious how much he feels for him; just having Harry and Hermione in his flat is more open than he's been in his life so far. "I am," he says, but he knows from Hermione's face that it's not enough.
“You know,” Draco says, and he tries to say it carefully. “You could have had everything you ever wanted as a child. All the toys and love in the world, and you would probably still have grown up wanting what you want right now. You wanting a nursery isn’t some fucked up response to what Dumbledore did to you.”
on them. There's one pair that are red and have llamas on. They don't move, which is odder, they just sort of sit there, still. Another pair have mermaids on - clearly drawn by someone who's never ever seen a real one, and has omitted to draw in the talons - and there are some with puppies on and sloths and pandas. Some are
"Collar," Harry says, and Draco obediently holds his hand out so that Harry can come over and take it from him. He holds it gently. "I like putting this on you."
Harry nods. They’re tramping through leaf mulch. Maybe wellingtons wouldn’t have been the worst idea in the world.
Harry jumps, looking vaguely guilty as he clutches two books to his chest. Draco pretends not to notice, and instead, sets the little table by the fire for breakfast instead.
"Going to come," Harry says, after a while. "Want to come on you."
Harry doesn't bother looking back, and by the time Draco's scrambled to his feet in embarrassed humiliation and got his dick away, there's no sign of him in the main bar. There's just a business card in Draco's pocket and humiliation settling down dark against his skin.
"Yeah," Harry says, hand moving faster now, Draco can hear it. "You got that right. Messy fucking rag."
Harry looks at him. "Because you're looking after me." It sounds a little peculiar.
"No," Harry says, and his fingers curl around the edge of the cake box. "Would you like me to feed you? I can if you'd like."
Harry rolls his eyes, and pokes Draco in the direction of the escalator. He slips an arm around Draco's waist this time, standing behind him and nudging him forward.
"Let me take charge for a bit, will you?" Harry asks, even as he's leaning in and kissing Draco's cheek.
Draco glances down. The Blacks were prone to hips, his mother had always said, but the Malfoy were exquisite. Draco was exquisite.
Draco stills. His fingers tremble. "Harry."
"I've been thinking," Harry says, later that afternoon.
"Last chance," Harry says, holding out the knife and fork. Draco meets his gaze, but doesn't say anything. Harry shrugs a shoulder. "Suit yourself," he says, and puts them back down on the counter. He steps over Draco's plate to sit back down at the table. His cock's still out. "Eat," he says finally, waving a hand, and Draco makes a strange, cut-off noise in his throat.
Harry looks him up and down. “Do piglets stand up?”
"No," Harry says. "I'd like you to say yes, but it doesn't have to be now if you're not ready. It can be later."
"It matters to you," Harry says. He kisses the corner of Draco's mouth. His kiss tastes like chocolate. It's probably more Draco than Harry, but he can't bring himself to care. He has to focus on what Harry's saying to him. And the truth is: Harry is right. Draco has grown up knowing what he'd been told of his marriageable value, and of the importance of saving himself for that marriage. Saving himself and finding it all for nothing had driven his mother to the continent, her dreams in pieces. "And if you'd like, we can go and visit your mother sometime."
The shop assistant - whose name is
Draco chooses not to pay any mind to the last time they were in here, when he'd eaten off the floor and Harry had fed him expensive chocolates. He leans on the counter instead, and watches as Harry fills the kettle and sets it to heat. He looks tired.
He doesn't tell Draco how, and it would be easy enough to get a cloth or a tissue from the bathroom or the dressing table, but Draco doesn't pick the easy way. He drops to his knees instead, his soft little cock still hanging out of his underwear, and cleans it up with his tongue. Harry crouches next to him and strokes the back of his neck.
. He's a dirty piglet. He's Harry's dirty piglet. Literally on his hands and knees in the  grass, pissing up against a tree.
"One you haven't seen before," Draco says. "How did you recognise me?"
"Of course," Draco says. "You know I'm yours."
Draco doesn't move. "If
Draco feels almost numb with it now. His skin is tight with drying come.
"Well, for that you definitely get the first slice," Harry says. "Was that German?"
or had any particular source for society gossip; part of being shunned for the whole of his twenties did rather leave one out in the cold when it came to being in touch with the latest things. There had been that whole expectation thing that Potter would end up married to Miss Weasley, with a whole parcel of tiny sproglets by this point. Except Ginny was off touring with her Quidditch team, and Harry Potter was picking up boys in bars and hand feeding old enemies cream cakes whilst they presented their arsehole for comment, so clearly something had detoured from the path of least resistance over the years.
“I don’t understand.”
. He doesn’t push it.
"Right," Draco says. "It’s really quite surprising she even let me in her house."
Draco looks at him. Neither of them have made a move to start getting dressed. "Come on," he says, and nods towards the bed. "Let's just sit down for a bit."
"Better," Draco says. There's a pause. "I just wanted to check you were all right."
“Remember your fantasy?”
. He nods, licking his lips. Harry's hand in his hair keeps stroking, and pulling, and Draco's chin tilts up with it.
Harry’s smile is lopsided. "Will do."
She watches him. "Is he? Safe with you?"
"They are," Harry agrees. There's a pause. "I think the ones downstairs were softer. I think you deserve soft things."
"I just wanted to," Draco says. "I just wanted to kiss you."
"Are you going to come for me, Piglet? Come on, Piglet. Show me how much you love thinking about this. Being my good pet."
Draco obliges, little animal licks to Harry's fingers.
"Well," Harry says. "Have one."
"I am," Draco agrees, because his mouth is actually watering, and his dick is already chubbed up and fat in his Quidditch clothes, jutting out and barely making a difference because he’s so fucking small. "Let me suck you. I’ll suck you here."
"Hello," Harry says, as Draco flushes at being caught in his socked feet and with his collar unbuttoned and tie missing. "Can I come in?"
"I'd be hard," Draco says. He touches Harry's hair. "All those people looking at me. Seeing me."
"Glad you're getting it," Harry says. "Hurry up and finish, will you? I'm bored."
, he slipped inside the post office, and composed a note for Harry:
"I won't be long," Draco says, but his attention is already slipping back to his charms, to his drawings and his plans and his work.
"I love you," Draco says. "You're coming with me to visit my mother. This is the opposite of breaking up with you."
"You were always so fucking superior," Harry says, "thought you were better than the rest of us, didn't you? But all the time you wanted this. What are you?"
"Yes," Draco says, and
Draco stands awkwardly outside Harry's front door, debating whether or not to ring the doorbell. In the end, the decision's made for him, because Harry opens the door to him.
"As if I would. Anyway, come on. The coffee will be there before us and then you won't appreciate my present."
"A wank," Harry says. "It's been a long day. Some dickhead no one cares about was rude to my best friend."
"What about your lunch?"
"Yes," Harry says.
Rose unhides her face for a fraction of a second and says something that sounds like "'lo."
Draco murmurs, pressing closer. He feels oddly uncertain, a little like he's at sea, but it doesn't change the fact that his cock's still hard. The tip's slick with pre-come. He doesn't ask for permission before he wraps his hand around his erection. He's small enough that his cock is almost lost in his fist, but he doesn't look down to see what he sees every other time he plays with himself; instead, he keeps his eyes closed and buries his face in Harry's neck. He wants this to settle him, to answer some questions about what just happened, to thread himself back together so that he isn't lost anymore. He wants to come.
When he wakes up, he's in bed, and Harry's next to him, asleep, the covers pulled up over them both. He didn't remember being moved, or his collar being taken off.
"Indeed," Draco says. "Was this when you were still with Miss Weasley?"
The collar is on the bedside table and the nappies are in the nursery. It's the work of minutes to go and get them and bring them back down to the sitting room, and in the intervening period Harry has cleared away the tea things and stripped off his trousers until he's just in his underwear and his shirt and jumper. He doesn't look quite so confident as normal, but Draco recognises this Harry Potter. It's the one that occasionally gives speeches or appears on the front of the Daily Prophet. It's the mask he wears so that people don't find out what he's feeling underneath.
"I do," Draco says. "I put up with a lot to tell the world just how annoying you were. I had to make secret liaisons with a beetle."
Harry hums against his chest. "What if I never can?"
"I didn't know you'd be doing this," he says finally.
"That's nice," Harry says, but he's not entirely comfortable, Draco can tell. He pauses for a moment before coming over and slipping an arm around Draco's back and going up on his toes for a second so that he can kiss Draco's temple. "Everything all right?"
"I'm entirely certain that's all you're getting from me tonight."
Harry smirks. "Horny, aren't you? Bet you'd beg me to do it again if you could. But you can't, can you? Because you're just a piglet." He stopped playing with Draco's hole and went to cup Draco's tiny, stiff little cock. "It's barely a cock at all is it?" He went on, the palm of his hand pressed to Draco's little prick. "Don't even know if it's big enough to be a cocklet."
"Are you ready to put your dick in that?" Harry asks.
Draco is always thirsty for cock. His mouth starts to water.
Harry's eyes are wide. His lips are wet from Draco's dick, from his come. For a moment, an unforgivable moment, Draco considers kissing him. He drops his gaze to Harry's cock instead, curving his hand around Harry's erection.
“Going to come on your tits, piggy,” Harry’s saying, but Draco’s stopped listening. He’s stopped listening to anything, losing himself in Harry’s hands on him, eyes closing as Harry smears cake over his skin. In his head he’s just what Harry’s telling him he is: a stupid, dumb pig, soft all over, living for nothing but cake and Harry’s touch. His cock’s so small it’s barely there at all, useless and tiny, and Harry owns him. He
Draco's heart beats loud in his chest. "Harry--"
"That I was still obsessed with you, I don’t know. That school was a long time ago and it was about time I faced up to how I felt about men in general, and you in particular."
“Hmm,” Draco says. “What sort of teacher waits until after the decorations have been put up to splash out with the final, special points for his special favourites?”
"Safety in location, perhaps," Draco says. "I'll check the wards tomorrow. Make sure they're up to date."
"I love you," Draco says. "You always look after me."
That sounds nice. It sounds peaceful. Draco feels a little bit like the sea the moment, tossed around and uncertain. He wants to plaster himself to Harry's side until it stops feeling strange.
Harry shifts his attention and strokes his hand over Draco's bum. "I'll take you out on Saturday night if you'd like. Find you a back room. Get you a queue of people you can suck off."
"We won't, and anyway, Ron sent me an owl to say he was half an hour late putting the meat in the oven so we'll be fine."
, and is followed up by an immediate second message that just says,
"I know," Harry says. He leans in and kisses him, catching the corner of Draco's mouth. Draco takes a moment to respond, to unwind himself and kiss back. "I hope the wine's okay. Hermione helped me pick it out."
trying to save the world," Draco says, choosing not to focus on
"You're fat," Harry says.
"Marvellous," Draco says, for there are two people in his house besides himself, and it has not been like this since his father was alive. For a moment, he longs for his mother, and the weight of her love for him. "How was your day?"
Not a bad spot to hit 50k on the last day of nano with! Thank you for the comments x
"Yes," Harry says, and pulls back the sheets. "Gosh, do you really make your bed like this every morning?"
Harry ignores that, and pats the space next to him on the sofa. "Come and kiss me hello."
"Nice," Harry says, without moving from where his face is hidden in Draco's shoulder. "Comfortable."
"Draco--"
Draco glances at the piles of clothes, all needing washing and looking after. After the clothes will need to come the sheets and the towels. And making sure the wardrobes and drawers and in the right state to welcome clothes back in. He doesn't let himself think about shopping for gaps in Harry's clothes collection. "No, sir."
"Uh-huh," Draco says, holding on to Harry's hand for grim life.
"Definitely," Harry says. He's lost his robe but underneath he's wearing some of his new clothes; a shirt and pullover in dark, rich blue teamed with jeans. His brown brogues are even polished. There's a bag next to Draco's in the hall, a little scruffier and older, perhaps, but nevertheless, a weekend bag.
He's wearing Harry's collar. He's Harry's pet. He's nothing more than an animal. A soft, round, piglet. He's owned.
"I'm going to take you out," Harry says. "I've found us a place with a back room I think you'll like. And it's Saturday night, people want to get off. And you want to get them off, don't you?"
Harry sees him looking, turning on his broom, but by then the snitch is off again, heading towards Draco like for once his luck is in. It darts away at the last minute though, and Draco rushes after it, Harry on his tail. The wind rushes past him and Draco has missed this, missed the competition and the flying and the snitch, he’s missed it so, so much. If he could just— he reaches out, trying to catch the snitch in his fist.
It settles over Draco's skin like a cloak.
"Okay," Harry says. "But if we’re doing that, then we’re doing us."
“Your piggy one,” Harry says. “The one you told me about. Will you let me play with it?”
Draco remembers. He'd come without being touched. He's not sure he wants to be restrained today, and he thinks he can read the question that Harry's not asking out loud about whether to do it today. He doesn't beg for it, and Harry tilts his chin in recognition.
After a minute, the door's opened by Ronald Weasley, in a striped jumper, an apron, jeans, and fluffy slippers with bunny ears. Ronald Weasley, it seems, is invariably drawn to inappropriate footwear.
Harry nods. "Understood." There's a pause. "Let's just get down to business, shall we?"
Harry shushes him. "So good, Draco. I'm going to clean you right up."
“Describe what you can see. What you’ve noticed.”
"They look like books to me," Draco says. "Would you like me to read you one of these after breakfast?"
. Draco's heart cries out with it. He gathers Harry up in his arms instead, sliding his hand into Harry's hair. "Of course," he says, and Harry's magic whirls around them as he apparates them upstairs, to Draco's bedroom, and their bed.
"Do you have one?"
He is loved. He is loved and he loves. He's woken up and the world is new. He could shout with it. As it is, he tips his head back, eyes closed, and lets himself feel.
"Do we?"
"Please," Draco says. "Please, Harry. Do it."
Draco, well-- he doesn't. He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't have breasts.
But it's not like that anymore. He's happy. He's really, genuinely happy.
Breakfast is higgledy-piggedly, cooked by Harry who appears to be drunk on love or some such, for Draco is presented with a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausages, and tomatoes, all on top of each other and demanding to be eaten first, and a pile of messily cut toast, butter leaking down the side of the stack.
Draco whines at that. He got fucked. He got his hole used. He was just a hole. Just an animal.
"Another few minutes," he says. "I'll be back on Tuesday, though."
Harry grins at him. "I do. You can't have a bolthole that's practically a mansion, it makes no sense."
Harry looks more enthusiastic than Draco had expected. “Bloody love the sea,” Harry tells him, clambering to his feet. “Never really got to go when I was little, they always left me at home when they were going on holiday.”
"Are you ready to go?" Harry says, his hand still stroking through Draco's hair. "Cock your leg against the tree, Piglet?"
Harry rolls his eyes for a second time, his hand to Draco's shoulder. "I'm going to the toilet," he says, tucking his cock back into his trousers. It's still wet from Draco's mouth, from being warmed in one of Draco's holes. He unclips Draco's lead. "Go and wait by the door, I'll take you out when I'm done."
It's a while later when Harry slips a hand into Draco's hair. "Stay," he says, fingers in his hair. "Just stay."
"Because I'm a dirty little animal," Harry repeats.
"Put your face in the other cake," Harry goes on. "Eat all that sweet stuff, as much of it as you want. Get it everywhere. Maybe I’ll make you come on it first, then you can eat it."
"So dirty," Draco says.
"Indeed," Harry says, and he steps up onto the stool. "Maybe you'll have to come with me next time."
"Where is that?"
it's been a while, so just a little chapter :)
They'd take tea in the sun room, he decides, opening up the doors. It opens up onto the terrace, but whilst the weather isn't warm enough for that, there's still a beautiful view of London, the shimmer where the magical world comes to an end and Muggle London continues on beyond his understanding. He sets up the cake on the coffee table by the sofas, and makes sure there's a little fire in the grate to take the chill off the room. He doesn't use it all that often; the flat is too big for just one of them, especially when every corner and every crevice reminds him of his parents. He sets a warming charm on the tea pot, and lays out a cake slice, cake forks, and plates that match the tea cups and the tea pot.
"Well, then," Draco says, and steps back, allowing Harry inside. "In that case, I'm appropriately surprised."
Harry gets to his feet, and he's not got any shoes on. His feet are bare, his trousers rolled up a little at the ankle. There's the soft, gentle breeze of a warming spell cast over both of them, and then Harry turns the key in the lock and opens the back door. It's only a little garden, grass coming right up to the door, no step or stone or otherwise. The grass must be kept back by magic alone, because it doesn't touch the doorway. The garden slopes up, slate stone walls enclosing nothing but grass, an ancient washing line, and a few trees and bushes that can survive the onslaught of the Welsh sea wind in the winter. Above them, to either side, the cliffs climb upwards again, rocky and green.
"I can give you what you need," Harry says, leaning across the table. There's a muffliato charm on their table, probably two since Draco is fairly sure Harry's put one on too, but it doesn't stop Harry from leaning even closer. "I can make you feel as ashamed and humiliated and turned on as you want. I'll take you to those back rooms. I'll tell you to get your cock out and show it off to anyone who wants to laugh at it. And they will laugh at it, won't they? They'll laugh at you, for being so fucking desperate you're begging for it off strangers. And then I'll take you home, and I'll give you everything you want, every filthy thing in your head. You can have it."
. His world, which for so long has felt like a prison, is opening up, and it's because of Harry. It feels like he's waking up.
The march to the Quidditch pitch takes them along the length of the terrace and through a stone archway and past a weird little dilapidated museum that had used to be a part of the castle grounds before his father had shown up and turfed everyone out. There are still weird taxidermied animals in there, but Draco has his limits, and it’s not like he’s spent that much time here.
"Fine. Good riddance," Ron says, and Draco waits until he's around the corner before he apparates back home.
Draco shakes his head. Harry has it all wrong. He's not scared about losing his virginity. He's scared that he won't. "I want to," he says, because trying to articulate the confusion in his head is too difficult, and because Harry's never led him wrong before. "I want to so much."
"You and Ron are my best friends," Harry says. "You're my family. But even that doesn't mean you get to walk into my relationship with me. You don't get to walk into Draco's home and make him make jokes about how he wouldn't trust himself either when I trust him with my life, okay? I trust him with my life."
Draco just nods. His mouth's open again, presenting his holes. HIs tongue's out.
Harry strokes his hand over the small of Draco's back. Like before, at Hermione and Ron's house, it makes want to throw himself across the room so that no one can see him be touched, but he wills himself to be still. He's allowed this touch, this feeling, this
"Why do you even carry a key? I can update your wards for you."
"Uh-huh," Harry says. He sounds amused. "Is it the kind of overwhelming experience that is suitable to be followed up with tea?"
"You wouldn’t, I don’t know, go along with something that you thought I wanted but you didn’t?"
Draco stumbles to his feet. His pristine clothes are crumpled and messed up. There's never that much to see with his stupid little cock, but it juts out a little bit at least. He can feel the damp patch even if he can't see it on the dark fabric. His hair's everywhere and his skin feels like it's on fire.
He nods his
When Harry finally does come, it's with a cut-off cry against Draco's mouth, and he spurts all over Draco's dick. He pants into Draco's cheek, hips rocking as he pulses, and it's sticky and hot and sweaty and not like Draco imagined at all.
Then, afterwards, in a slightly different coloured ink, like it had been rushed on afterwards,
"What colour would Piglet like, do you think?" Harry says, a little louder than he should do. They're in front of the shelves of food bowls. There's a duck egg blue, a pale green, and a pale pink on one shelf, and then on the shelf below, more solid, fiercer colours. There's a Gryffindor red, and a Slytherin green.
He comes, like a dirty little piglet, all over his chocolate cake.
Draco obediently steps back and invites Harry into his room. It's got a green tartan theme because he hasn't bothered redecorating it since taking over the ownership of the castle. There's a large bed in the centre of the room, vaguely littered with Draco's travelling outfit and the discarded parts of his Quidditch kit.
"The snitch just hit me," he says, but Harry laughs at him, pulling away, skin flushed.
"Because I went down on my knees for strangers. Because I'm a come-hungry piglet and I got to be a hole for their come."
"Hello," Harry says, leaning against the doorway. There's a pause. "You're not ready for me."
"Greedy piglet," Harry tells him, the smirk turning into a laugh. "Always such a greedy piglet, aren't you? So fucking greedy." Draco flushes, and Harry laughs again, before feeding Draco his cock.
“Yes,” Draco says, although it would have to be truly dreadful for him to say no. Harry’s never stepped wrong before.
“Of course,” Draco says. “Is there anything in particular you’d like to do this afternoon?”
Harry glances down at Draco's cock, then raises an eyebrow, amused. "Anyone could see," he says, and Draco doesn't bother explaining any of the complex spellwork that protects his home from the outside world. "But I forgot, you like that, don't you?"
It’s a while later when Harry strokes Draco’s hair behind his ear. "Piglet," he says, and maybe he’s said it before, Draco can’t tell. Opening his eyes is a wrench.
"My little animal," Harry goes on, his hands stroking over Draco's skin. "My soft little piglet." He spreads Draco's legs more and cups his balls whilst his thumb presses at his hole. "Someone got fucked last night, didn't they? Someone got their hole used."
"I know," Harry says. "Thank you."
Draco drags his attention back to Harry.
Harry just nods. "You should, uh… you can use the bathroom upstairs. The same one you used before. I'll use the other one. Take as long as you need. Use whatever you want." He stands up. It's the first time Draco's really seen him not in control, and he doesn't quite understand why. "I won't go in my bedroom. You can tell me when I can go back in there. If you're ready to resume that. I'll be in the living room. Take as long as you need, Draco."
"Not for me," she says. "So, will you do it?"
"Nah," Harry says. "World still turns. I’m still a better flyer than you."
"Fair," Draco says.
"Let's get that off you," Harry says, going for the buckle of his collar, but Draco manages to shake his head. He clambers into Harry's lap, eyes screwed shut, and he wraps his arms around Harry's back and tries to ignore the relative stiffness of his limbs. He just wants this, to be held in Harry's embrace as he tries to capture his voice and his mind and his body all in the same place and time, and fit them all together again like they were before this. Before he lost himself in the space between his breaths.
"Hermione Granger," Draco says, carefully.
"I am a piglet," Draco says, fucking his stupid little cock into his curled fingers. He’s too small to fist. "Useless cake-fucking piglet."
"Sometimes I do," Harry says, and then he backs Draco up against the wall and kisses him, swallowing down Draco's whine of surprise.
"Cheek to the floor," the man goes on, and Draco obeys, cheek pressed to the dirty floor, trousers down by his ankles, arse on show. "Fuck, you're slow at this. Spread your cheeks. Use your hands. I want to see that useless little hole of yours."
"What are we doing?" Draco asks, hand encircling his cock. He's already slick across the tip.
"That's right," Draco says, leaning into Harry for just a second. "My good boy."
"Yes," Draco says. He'd just begged to be immobilised in the most shameful of positions; humiliation spreads across his skin like wildfire.
Draco hadn't even heard him come in.
"I'll teach you," Draco says sleepily.
"Yes," Harry says. "You should clean up." There's another pause. "I should clean up."
Harry looks at him. "My poor darling," he says finally. "You've had to look after too much for too long, haven't you? You need this, don't you? Taking in hand."
Upstairs there’s an old bathroom with one of those flushes that hang from a chain above the toilet. There’s also a large, claw-foot bath. There’s no bubble bath but — again — Harry’s come prepared. He drops a little pellet into the water and it fizzes with lavender-scented joy, little stars and petals and bubbles erupting through the water as the bath fills.
And Draco, Draco fucking comes.
"Some of them," Harry says.
"A file landed on my desk today. This kid who they wanted us to investigate for magical potential. Except they got to his primary school and he was a catalogue of signs of neglect."
The hamburger restaurant is loud, busy, bustling and - Draco doesn't like to admit it - daunting. In the end, Harry deposits him at a plastic table upstairs and tells him to stay put whilst he gets them their food, and Draco is left staring in some horror at the fact there is ketchup and spilled salt on their table and no one to clean it up.
Harry picks one of the sitting rooms to stop in, one they've been in before where there's a view of the gardens and a record player left over from the previous castle occupants. The carpet is red and is just as rough beneath his palms as the last time he was in here, doing this.
"There's a workshop and gallery in Dorset that makes the most beautiful things out of glass," Harry says, almost as if he hadn't heard anything that Draco just said. "I only found it by accident when I was doing some outreach with a primary school near there. They do custom pieces."
Harry looks at him. "Good enough for me," he says, and whirls around. "An absolutely solid no from me," he tells Heathen. "One hundred percent not buying it."
Harry smiles at him. It looks a little lopsided, but generally fond. "Don't use it as an excuse to put your tie back on," he says. "I like you like this."
"Are you hungry, Draco? Do you want your chocolates?"
"Stop thinking so much," Harry says, his words fuzzy against Draco's lips, and then he's kissing him again. He kisses him over and over, and Draco kisses back until his dick's slick with pre-come and bumping up against Harry's much larger dick.
Harry's thumb strokes his cheekbone. "Of course. Whatever you need."
Draco's cup catches on the saucer with a clatter. "Yes," he says. "Yes, I'd like you to do that."
Harry flushes at that. "I feel like it’s right," he says. "I feel like when it’s you and me, what we do, it feels like it’s right."
"Wet," Draco says, for the weather has given into the shock-grey clouds and descended into dark rain. It's glorious. The cottage is small enough, and near enough, that the sound of the sea echoes around them as the rain patters against the slate roof. "We shall have to amuse ourselves inside."
"Please," he begs. "Please let me fuck the cake."
"Yeah," Harry says, still stroking Draco's bum. "If you want."
“It wasn’t all fucked up.”
He want to do it again.
"I know." There's a pause. "I know."
"Okay," he says. "Let’s go."
"Probably. And I had my dick in this guy’s mouth. I was busy. Perfectly acceptable blow job, I suppose."
Draco opens his mouth, flushed but obedient. Oh, he wants to be used so badly. He wants it so fucking much. He wants
Friday dawns heavy and overcast, and by the afternoon the rain is heavy and unrelenting. It's so dark Draco has to light the lamps in his office and force himself to carry on working even though he runs his own business and could just as easily take the afternoon off. In the kitchen there's a new package of black tea infused with rose, delivered this morning, and two small boxes of the most expensive Charbonnel et Walker chocolates he could find in the wizarding side of Liberty waiting next to it. One is English dark violet creams, the other milk sea salt caramel truffles. In the hallway waits his new weekend luggage, soft brown leather with dark green trim and interior. His trousseau, new, richly expensive, and all neatly tailored, is spelled inside, crease-free and immaculate.
"I love you," he says, after a while. He's never said it out loud before. It's not the kind of thing his parents went in for. He's never had anyone to say it to. This time it's lost a little in Harry's hair. "My love."
Draco makes a noise at that, the sound catching somewhere at the back of his throat. He is going to come. He's going to come with his stupid little cock pressed into a cake, and it's all so overwhelming and too much that he barely knows what he's doing.
"Thank you," Harry says finally, because they haven't really filled the quiet with inane chatter, "for letting me look after you."
"You were so good," Harry says. "Draco, you were so, so good."
It feels a little like his mind and his body are slowly separating, right there in the garden. He presses his cheek to Harry's trouser leg, making soft noise after soft noise into his thigh, and Harry keeps stroking his hair and holding him close and there's a deep, dark sense of satisfaction that's settling into Draco's chest in a way he never even imagined. Not once.
Harry, who must be used to Ron because he hasn't smothered him in his sleep yet and he's had plenty of opportunities, chucks a cushion at Ron's head.
Harry puts his glass of wine down on the table, and leans in to cup Draco's cheek in his hand. "I want to keep doing this, then," he says. "Kindnesses."
"So small," Harry says, in seeming wonder. He stops folding back the covers and tucks them under Draco's cock and balls. "Such a terribly small little thing."
Draco is already reaching for Jonathan's cock, hands encircling his length, guiding him in. He sucks on the tip and wanks him off with one hand, cupping his balls with the other. He wants Jonathan to come, to come on Draco's face and mess him up so that Harry can watch him get dirtier. So Harry can watch how far Draco still has to fall into his humiliation. About much he wants it, needs it, craves it.
"So soft, darling," Harry goes on, fingers slipping out of Draco's hole and stroking over his thighs, and round to his tiny little cock and the little jutting curve of his belly. "So beautiful, so soft."
“I’ve got you a present,” Harry tells him, pressing the remains of the lemon cake to Draco’s mouth so it smears across his skin. “Do you think a messy, dirty, stupid piggy deserves a present?”
Harry leans forward in his seat. "Is that dirty enough for you, Piglet?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's not much of  a cock."
Draco presses his cheek to Harry's hand. "Yours," he says, letting his eyes close.
“Harry,” Draco says, after a while. His heart pounds.
Then he reaches for the charmed coin in the little green bowl on his bedside table. Hand-blown Venetian glass, an accent both picked and displayed by his mother. The coin shines silver. He runs his thumb over it until it glows.
"I know. He's just, um… well, he's not always as
Draco smiles. It feels lopsided, but Harry has, at least, stopped pulling away so he'll count that as some sort of a win. "You know I love the humiliation. I can't think of anything hotter than that kind of shame. And you give it to me. You know the difference between the kind of shame that makes me want to hide from the world and the kind of shame that makes me want to come."
"You're holding it now."
"My soft, happy piglet," Harry says, "so indulged." He leans in and kisses Draco's mouth again, too brief for anything other than Draco to moan and try to arch up to meet his mouth in another kiss, but Harry pulls back. "I'll indulge you, Piglet. I'll indulge you and indulge you and indulge you. Give you every depraved thing you want. Make you feel so humiliated you won't even need to beg for more. Show you and that tiny cocklet off in public so that everyone can see that you're mine. You're
. He nods his approval, trying to press his face into Harry's hand. He already doesn't want to talk.
Draco whines again. There’s nothing for him to rub his cock against, and he really needs to. He’s naked except for his collar, cake in his hair and and smeared across his face. He can’t help it; he reaches for his cock.
"What?" he says sleepily, turning on the lamp with a flick of his wrist. "Harry?"
Draco's face burns but he does as he's told, holding his arse cheeks apart. "I'll wank you off," he says again. "Suck you."
He presses his tongue to the base of Harry's cock, and feels him tremble.
Draco does it too slowly and is almost cut in half by the ticket gates. He darts forward, free of the gates, and then marches up the stairs to where he can be outside and not be in danger of death by Muggle.
"You didn't
, he remembers, and Draco knows. He
Draco lets out a breath, and shuffles a little closer. "Which one are we starting with?"
"Pig," Harry says again. "No, not even that. A piglet. Filthy piglet. Rutting against the rug like an animal. That's what you are."
Draco shrugs a shoulder.
"I'm trying. Please. All that time before my mother left, and that whole time afterwards, when I first started going out wearing the glamour, I felt like I was crawling out of my skin. I wanted it so badly. I needed it. I was crying out for it and I'd never been able to satiate any of that. It helped, going out. Getting people to use me. I'd been denying myself something that I'd needed for so long. But it wasn't ever as good as when I started doing it with you."
Harry's shoulders are shaking. "I want to be okay with it."
"Yes," Draco says. His little cock is so hard. "Put me how you want me, and make me stay there. Make me stay there. Please."
"Wanted to do it sometime," Draco says. "It's a good thing we've got lots of unplanned sometimes, then."
"Me too," Draco says, even though he hasn't heard it all the way through. Warmth has settled in his chest.
It takes a long time for Draco to close his eyes. “Now what?”
They’re still holding hands. "Is this one of the ways that makes it hurt less?"
"Is it? It seems like the right one to me."
"I did," Harry agrees, and Draco gets up onto his knees and takes Harry's cock into his mouth, sliding his lips down over the length of him.
"I should think so," Harry says, and then he does something that Draco doesn't accept - namely, coming over to where Draco's standing and going down on his knees so he can pull Draco's underwear down and free his little cock.
Draco rolls over. "I'm going to wash my face," he says, which is code for use the bathroom.
"Come and see me tomorrow at seven," he says. The card's got an address on it, a pub in north London. "I feel that we might be able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
Draco takes another chocolate, a gold one this time, and chooses not to think about how and when he got hard.
"Shit," Harry says, "I've left the towels in the bedroom. Two seconds, Draco. Two seconds and Ill be back to dry you off."
"Settle down," Harry says. "Get comfortable." He helps Draco settle so that Draco's cheek is pillowed on Harry's thigh. The pet bed is ridiculously soft. Harry's not asking anything of him right this second, so Draco closes his eyes, and Harry doesn't tell him to open them again. He just keeps stroking Draco's hair. "That's right," Harry says. "There you go."
Draco rolls his eyes. "Times have changed."
"No," Harry says, and he almost thrusts a bottle of wine in Draco's direction. "I just wanted to see you."
"I'd never even thought about it. Different underwear."
He sticks his tongue out, and tightens his grip on Harry's cock as he wanks him off, and then, between one panted breath and the next, Harry's hips jerk forwards and he's coming. He comes in stripes across Draco's face, catching his mouth, his tongue, his cheeks, his eyelashes. He marks Draco like he's his own, and Draco is. He really, really is. He leans back so that he can look up and meet Harry's gaze, and then he smears Harry's come across his face. He smears it everywhere, and he doesn't look away.
“Which one?”
"It rather passed me by."
Harry just rolls his eyes. "You've been in suits since you were fourteen, you've probably never even owned anything comfy, I don't even know why I'm asking you."
"I mean," Harry says, waving his hand in Draco's general direction, "you know, comfortable. Not buttoned up."
Draco rather suspects no one’s called Harry beautiful in his life, but he is. He strokes Harry’s messy hair, brushing it to one side so that he can touch his thumb to Harry’s scar, then down over his cheek until he can cup Harry’s face in his hand. “Beautiful.”
"Right," Draco says. "Would you like some tea before we leave?"
Harry catches him up. "That was cool."
"Hey," Harry says. "I asked you a question."
Draco's eyebrows go up infinitesimally in Hermione's direction.
“What’s in it for you?”
Harry nods. "That's good," he says. "But I was thinking, how would you feel about doing it with cake?"
His glamour spells are brilliant, his speciality, and he finds a place in Muggle London where there's a back corridor where he can go down on his knees and get his cock out and take what people want to give him.
"I know you do," Harry says, and he pushes at the waistband of the awful, horrible trousers.
"You don't have to look at me."
Draco waits until Harry really is mostly asleep this time. "Thank you," he says softly. "For tonight."
Harry points lazily to the arm of the sofa. "Rub yourself off on that," he says, and Draco must look confused because Harry's expression turns exasperated. "You don't get to touch. If you want to come, you rut against the sofa." He waves his hand towards the door. "If you don't want to come, you know where the door is."
“Oh no you don’t,” Harry says, and he catches Draco’s wrist in his hand. “Can you stay still all by yourself or are you too stupid a piggy for that? Do I need to tie your hands to the bed?”
"All done?" she asks, getting the milk out of the fridge. Ginny, like Harry, has milk that comes from TESCO, and she doesn't decant it into a jug. She just slides the bottle down the counter so he can add it himself, and opens a packet of digestive biscuits. "Let's be fancy and have it in the living room."
"Just how you like it," Harry says. He's smiling. "Come and sit down."
There's chocolate on his lip. He licks it up. His jeans have a button and a zip and he's wearing underwear. He can't get all of that out of the way in less than two seconds. He doesn't even bother trying.
"Exactly," Harry says, and he hands Draco the bag. "Are you ready?"
Draco, red-faced and ashamed, ducks his head over the plate, and starts to eat. The chicken's easy to nip at with his teeth, and so are the bits of bread, although he gets butter on his nose and his cheek. The salad's cut a bit too small to eat with ease, so he chases bits of it around the plate, his face getting messier.
Draco
Harry Potter, the chosen one, the saviour of the wizarding world, brave Gryffindor Harry Potter, youngest seeker in a century, is holding Draco's hand in public.
"Of course," Harry says immediately.
"This one's a dark hazelnut praline," Harry tells him, as the chocolate melts against Draco's lips. "That's right, Malfoy, all for you."
The jeans go on a smaller, separate washing pile with Harry's other jeans. Then Draco settles himself in Harry's newly cleared red armchair, and picks up the first piece of mending - a shirt with a rip in the sleeve. It's a mixture of Draco's delicate skill with a needle and exquisite charms knowledge that leaves the tear almost invisible afterwards. He tidies up a fray on the cuff too.
He reaches for his cloak to wipe up the worst of the mess, but Harry shakes his head.
Draco closes his eyes, just for a moment, but he's afraid Harry caught it anyway.
Harry takes a sip of his tea, then lifts his wand. He must have left it down here earlier, because he hadn't carried it with him.  A second chocolate cake appears on the floor next to the first one. The icing is more extravagant on this one, more whirls of chocolate cream and chocolate stars and planets. It sparkles.
It's Draco's turn to
"You keep me on your cock most of the time," Draco says, as Harry starts to unzip Draco's trousers and push them down so that his little dick is freed. "Warming your cock even when you've got guests. You don't make me come. You just let me rub myself off on something whenever I need to. I don't use my hands. You probably laugh about it with your friends but I barely understand what you're saying anymore. Just tone of voice."
Draco does not like the tube one bit, and when he stumbles off when Harry indicates they're supposed to be getting out, he resolves he's never doing that again.
"Come on, darling," Harry says, and Draco, obedient to the last, comes again, pulsing over his fingertips and his thighs as Harry kept on fucking him. "That's right, you come first and then it's up to me to follow, isn't it? You're going to make me come, Malfoy, you're going to make me come so hard." His hips rock up, his pace increasing, and Draco wipes come across his own face and lets himself be fucked.
Draco looks perplexed. "I don't think I want one of those."
. Harry hands him a glass of wine, then sits down and arranges himself so that he's casually thrown his legs over Draco's lap and has his feet on the cushion. At some point he's removed his shoes; Draco hadn't noticed.
"Do I come on them?"
"I saw a cake in a shop window and I wanted it, and I wanted to share it with you."
“You deserve it,” Draco says, after a while, and Harry shivers a little at that. “It’s yours. Whenever you want it.”
"Good," Harry says. "And when you come back, you should be naked."
"Yes, well. Harry's important to us."
"They're pyjamas," Draco says again, because he doesn't have anything for Harry right now that isn't that.
"Is that little cock hard at the thought of what's coming next?" Harry asks. He drops his hand to cup Draco's little cocklet, then lets go so he can go back to playing with Draco's nipples.
Draco sighs. "All right. The tea's warmed."
Then Harry moves. He rolls his hips up and slides his dick further inside of him and covers Draco's little cocklet with his palm. "So little," he says, as he fucks into him, rocking up into him and Draco presses back to meet him, the ache stretching across his skin. "My soft little piglet."
Draco licks at some of the sugar in the bowl before picking up another little piece with his teeth. He's being masturbated whilst he eats cake from the floor. Even in his wildest fantasies over the past few years, he'd never got here. He'd never even known he could think about it, let alone live it. Let alone get what he wanted from Harry fucking Potter.
"Well, you've said it now. And you're going to get what you want. I'm going to give it to you."
"My pyjamas," Draco says weakly.
"Careful," Harry says. "The humiliation comes later. You don't get one for free just because you're handing it to me on a plate."
"Just a hole," Draco says. "I'm nothing. Just holes for you to fuck."
"Please," Draco says, and wraps his hand around his cock.
"Right then," Harry says. "I believe I need a few bits and pieces for my pet."
, Draco thinks, over and over again. Not even a proper cock. He shivers with it, lapping at the floor.
never shows a skirt above the knee. I really am genuinely completely unobservant."
Harry leans in and kisses him. "Our first time will be special," he says. "I promise."
"By the end, everything I wanted to do for Ginny was wrong. She didn’t want it, and I wanted to give her stuff, and it was a mess. We got hurt. I felt hurt. She was trying not to hurt me and I got hurt anyway."
"I don't understand."
"That's right," Harry says. "My good piglet."
"Okay," he says. "I'll get changed and you make the tea."
"A guest always waits to be invited."
"I'm nothing," Draco says, even as he's taking off his sweater, loosening his tie, and unbuttoning his shirt. "Just holes."
Draco's mouth goes dry.
Draco bumps the back of his hand into Harry’s. "It wouldn’t ruin it. If you had nightmares."
"Yes."
"Ah," Draco says, imagining Harry sneaking around his house whilst Draco was upstairs getting changed, putting his plans in order. He straightens, rolling his shoulders. He reaches for Harry, hand to his shoulder. "Let me get you undressed."
"Yes," Draco says, and he means it. He is loved. He is fed. He is full. He is happy.
And then, carefully, heart pounding, he crawls to the kitchen, and waits by the back door.
“By yourself?” Draco asks carefully, as Harry pulls his jumper over his head and messes up his already messy hair. Draco has long curbed the physical urge to reach out and tidy him up, but the mental urge is likely to always be there.
"Until now," Draco says. The cottage is tiny, just big enough for a small bedroom, sitting room, kitchen and bathroom, with a tumbledown garden out in front and a small hut and a woodpile out behind. The Pembrokeshire stone must have seen a century at least pass. The whole cottage could probably fit in Draco's London hall. The bedroom doesn't even have room for a bedside table. There's just a bed and a chest of drawers at the end of it, and the sitting room just has a small sofa, a table for two, and a bookshelf stuffed with books that don't look like they were ever Harry's, and some old games on the bottom shelf. There's a woodburning stove that Draco will check the charms on later; there's nothing that keeps him up at night like the horror of nightmares about fire. The kitchen is small and cramped, but there's a set of stone stairs that lead down into a cool, dry, little pantry with thin shelves along each wall.
"Cheat," Draco howls, but Harry just laughs at him, unrepentant.
Harry's fingers catch in Draco's robe. "When did you think of that?"
"Well, you have permission now," Harry says. "As many sweet things as you'd like."
"Better," Harry says. "Then what?"
“Harry,” Draco says softly.
"We can do," Heathen says, and Draco turns around to pay attention to a selection of really rather terrible accessories whilst Harry works out the details of delivery.
"Not tying you up today," Harry says, stroking his hand down Draco's side. "Never unless you want it," he goes on, just touching his fingertips to Draco's softening tummy. "Never anything you don't want. Never, darling."
Draco's whole body feels hot with embarrassment, but his little cock displays nothing except tiny, stiff pride. There's a little blurt of pre-come across the slit. Harry rolls his eyes in seeming disappointment, and swipes at it with the tip of his pinky finger before holding it out for Draco to lick clean, which Draco does obediently, despite his cheeks heating.
"Your horror is worth the expense alone," Harry says, sliding the tray down the table and sitting down. He starts dividing the portions out so they have a small box each, a carton of chips, and a drink. The third box is 'chicken nuggets', and Harry invites him to 'dig in'.
Draco can usually do a fairly good job of partitioning off his brain so that the part of him that gets naked and eats cake off the kitchen floor from a pet bowl feels entirely separate to the part of him that's standing in front of Harry under normal circumstances. Sometimes, though, it feels a little blurry, like when Harry's telling him to do something.
Harry's hips roll up a little, his cock pressing forward into Draco's mouth. Draco startles out of his reverie, the sound he makes little more than a hum around Harry's cock. When he looks up, Harry's putting the book on the arm of the sofa, cover up, pages spread so that the sofa is his bookmark.
"Very," Harry says. He still looks nervous, and is still clutching his books.
"Come on," Draco says. "The sooner we get inside, the sooner we can go outside and fly." That old familiar anticipation is coursing through him, the memory of how exciting it used to be to be able to play Quidditch regularly. There might only be the two of them playing, but Draco hasn’t flown with anyone else in years. He hadn’t realised how much he’d missed it.
And then his father's dead and his mother's gone, and the Scottish house and the London flat are Draco's because his mother's never coming back to Great Britain.
"It changes nothing," Draco says. "You're still very important to me. This is still very important to me."
He goes over to make sure the curtains are open, the dull morning light hitting the carpet just in front of the comfy window seat. Harry's taking it all in again, the fireplace with the moving pictures on the wall above it, the bookcases, the rugs. The armchairs in front of the fire. He keeps looking at the doors too, at the one that leads into the nursery bedroom and beyond that, into the nanny's room.
Draco's dick is so fucking hard he's about two seconds from coming in his underwear.
"I'd say
"Please," Draco says. He keeps rubbing his cheek against Harry's palm. "Please, sir."
Draco has heard of this happening, but he's never known anyone where their mother was the main breadwinner. He can't help but wonder if his mother would have been happier if she'd been able to focus on something other than Draco's failure to position himself in the marriage mart over the past decade.
"No, dirty little piglets don't get to wear clothes when they're just a come rag."
"Yes," Harry says. He's still wrapped in his robe from the bathroom, as is Draco. He glances around. "The decor reminds me of Professor McGonagall."
"I turn around and I get on my knees," Draco says, and his skin feels hot. He wants to stop holding his arse cheeks apart to show off his hole and touch his useless little cock instead. "And I present like this, so I can look behind me and see in the mirror what I am."
"They’d come all over you like you were nothing, wouldn’t they, Piglet? Just use you and then go off and play Quidditch like you weren’t even there, and you’d love that."
follows that, then
The doors unlock for Draco at a flick of his wand, and then they're inside and Harry's shrugging off his coat. Draco follows suit, although when Harry kicks off his shoes, Draco undoes the laces with his wand and steps out carefully.
Draco looks at him.
"I didn't get it wrong, did I?" Harry sounds uncertain all of a sudden. "I thought if we were formalising this, you'd want us to go and see your mother."
Harry pinches a nipple. "You're thinking again."
“You’re dying to say something,” Draco says. “You may as well say it.”
"You cheat," Ron says, without looking up. Rose is still shy, curling into his side as she drinks her milk.
"Anyway, whatever," Harry says. "We're talking about you. What do you own that counts as, you know… casual wear."
"Aren't we all," Harry says. He glances down at the floor, then into the mirror. "Is this where you wank when you get home from those back rooms?"
"What's that?" Draco asks, as they file through some of the racks in search of the pyjamas.
"Take me back to bed," Draco says, after a while.
Draco takes off his jumper, and starts to fold it up to put it on the bed.
"Put your shirt back on," Harry says, and fuck, his shirt's disgusting, and slimy in places, and Draco shudders as he pulls it back over his head.  It's stained and wet and smells terrible. "You dirty, dirty boy."
4.30, they'd said, and Draco's been naked since 4.15. It's 5pm. There's pushing the boundaries, and then there's just plain rude.
Harry shrugs, bored. "Kind of," he says. "He has his uses. Mostly just sucking me off."
He's embarrassed, both for her social faux pas, and for Harry and her, together all that time. Harry keeps getting Draco right, like he's got a secret path into Draco's brain and he can go in and out whenever he wants and scoop up all the private, secret, desperate bits. And maybe he'd found it by accident, but he'd found it, and Draco hates the idea of Ginny's guilt and not wanting what Harry needed so desperately to give.
Harry shrugs. "Yes, you. It's okay if you don't want me to talk about it."
Draco will come before Harry even properly touches him at this point, and he doesn't even care. He pants into the pillow, breathless and needy, filled up with Harry's cock.
The sofa's not quite high enough to be comfortable, and Draco has to bend his knees as he hesitantly leans in so that his cock's pressed up against the arm. He rolls his hips.
"I had it all planned out, but now I'm here I don't really know where to start." She smiles. It's a little wonky. "I just… a lot of people think Harry has everything under control, that he's well adjusted--"
anyone," Draco says, going pink.
Harry doesn't say anything for the longest time. Draco's half convinced he's fallen asleep, although neither of them is very good at falling asleep like this. They like their own sides of the bed.
Draco lets out a puff of air. He battles the two warring parts of his brain a lot: the part that demands to be in control, that owns his own business and knows he's one of the best in the world at what he does, and the part that aches to go down on his knees and relinquish all the decision making to someone else. "You have no taste."
"However many you're having," Draco says, and pokes at one of the tinfoil parcels in the roasting tin. "What else are we having?"
"You haven't tasted it yet," Harry says, going pink. "And who am I supposed to toast to?"
. He's conversed with Granger and Weasley, and no one ended up hexed. He's been terribly polite all evening.
Draco swallows, his chin tilting up. He's breathless, his fingers spreading in the damp grass. He moves his knees further apart.
"I could piss on you," Harry says. "Right here, right now. And I'd bet you'd like it."
"No," Harry says, "you're not."
He sits down on the sofa next to Harry, and is surprised when Harry manoeuvres them both so that Draco's legs are over Harry's lap and Harry can cup Draco's cheek in his palm.
Draco's brow furrows. "My mother isn't wrong, you know. The Blacks carry cake on their hips."
"Yes," Draco says. Grief still weighs heavy in his chest. Maybe it always will. Maybe one of these days he’ll stop feeling it for his mother prematurely, and remember that she’s still alive, even if she’s had to leave to prove it.
"Don't say anything," Harry says, without moving his face from the curve of Draco's neck.
"I expect so," Draco says.
"Next time, Malfoy, next time I summon my come rag, you come dressed for it, you understand? You arrive naked. Why's that, Draco?"
"Compared to what I get off on, is it more, less, or the same amount of embarrassing?"
"I love you," Draco says, and it's Harry's turn to make a queer, half-bitten off noise in his throat. His eyes are so bright.
"You really are a filthy animal, aren't you?" Harry continues. "I gave you a plate but I don't even think you deserve one. You should have a food bowl like an animal. A trough like a piglet. Maybe I'll get you one. If I can be bothered."
"I'm sorry," Harry says, turning around. "She should never have come here and said that to you."
"Forever changed, but all right," Draco says, which is how he really thinks about himself.
"Mostly, I would imagine, because I said I'd dress you and undress you if you had any clothes in your wardrobe I didn't want to burn."
"Think about what?"
Draco makes another noise, catching in the back of his throat.
Harry's smile, just for a second, gone before Draco can place it, is rueful. "Right place, right time," he says finally, and it doesn't make much sense.
"What are you?"
"Well, then," Harry says. "We'll have coffee in your coffee cups." He snaps his fingers and the tray lifts up off the counter and floats over next to them.
It's a little strange, once they've finished clearing away their dinner things. Draco doesn't know what to do next. Should he suggest a game? There are some on the bottom shelf of the little bookcase in the sitting room. Maybe they should have tea. Maybe there's something for the house that he could do, some little job that will help Harry out. Maybe--
"I am," Draco says. "I'm a cake-fucking piglet."
Draco shifts closer, and lets himself breathe in, then out. Harry breathes with him, the two of them naked but for Draco's collar, and pressed together. It’s the closest he’s ever been to anyone in his life.
There's the kind of pause where Draco can tell Harry's turning the words over and over in his mouth, trying to build up the courage to say them out loud.
He kneels down on the kitchen floor, facing away from Harry, and leans down until he's pressing his cheek against the tile. Then he spreads his legs until he's presenting his hole for inspection.
"Come for me," Harry says, breathless. "Come for me, Draco, come on."
"Comfortable," Harry says, and Draco can't stay and look at Harry looking at him like that, so he disappears in the direction of the kitchen so that he can decant the wine and find them both a glass.
"Thank you," Draco says, and Harry just smiles at him. He's putting on a pair of pyjama trousers, and he's doing it because Draco would like him to, and Draco really does love him. Maybe one day soon he'll trust himself to say it out loud.
He's wanking himself off, and Draco's not standing for this. The only person who makes Harry come is Draco. He blinks three times in quick succession and the spell breaks. Muscles held rigid for so long immediately start to ache but he ignores it all in favour of scrambling to his knees.
"Come-hungry piglet," Draco says, although that’s not the right answer. "A hole. A come rag."
Harry makes a face. He disentangles his hand from Draco's and goes back to eating his burger. "Eat up, then," he says. "There's a little cafe at the other end of the high street that stays open late and does heavenly cake."
Draco glances down at the wine. It's expensive, but Draco is fairly certain that Harry knows nothing about wine or under which circumstances you'd pick which type. His good choice tonight is almost definitely accidental. Unlike Draco, Harry didn't have his parents to drill wine choices into him from the age of twelve. "Is everything all right?"
"Come on then, little one," Draco says, and he pushes open the door.
Harry, with a breathless, cut-off cry, comes inside of him, and doesn't let go.
He's already late, and Harry is already waiting. He doesn't bother changing his clothes or unbuttoning his coat. He follows the siren call of his coded message, and apparates to Harry's home.
"Your job," Harry says, sounding a little strangled.
Draco tilts his chin up. "I'm sorry," he says, even though there hadn't been instructions in Harry's hastily scrawled note that afternoon. "I'm sorry, sir."
Whole lifetimes seem to have lived and died in the time since they were in the shop with Heathen.
Harry strokes his hair. "My dirty little piglet. My filthy little animal. My round little piglet. Look how lovely you look, my darling. You make me want to come."
Harry doesn’t let go of Draco’s hand until they’re back inside the castle.
"Draco."
, the desperate need that Draco has to be used, well, that can start coming true.
After Jonathan there's Ahmed, who slaps Draco in the face with his cock, and a nameless guy who makes Draco put his hands behind his back so that he can wank himself off and come on his lips. There's Tim and his boyfriend Dave, and he wanks them both off as they kiss over the top of him, and he can't help but feel like he's just a rag. Nothing. A sex toy. The kind of thing Muggles and wizards alike buy at seedy sex shops in Soho.
"She cares." Draco isn't really used to stews. He's used to more delicate fare, less hearty. Less suet dumplings. This one's nice, though. He watches Harry take his bread and dip it in, and does the same. "She wants to make sure you're all right."
Draco scrambles to obey, laying on his back and bringing his knees up to his chest. He's on his mother's rug. He's a dirty little piglet, humiliating himself on his mother's rug. He lets his tongue hang out.
Harry, still flushed, agrees, and trails after Draco to the window seat with his blanket and dragons in hand. He lets Draco tuck him into his side though, still in his pyjamas but with his too-big red jumper falling down over his hands. Draco finishes the story and asks Harry if he'd like to start the next one, which has virtually no pictures and will take an age to read.
Going back outside, he finds Ron Weasley in a deckchair next to a Volkswagen camper van, all set up on the pavement like he's never heard of privacy. He's eating an ice cream, of all things, and reading the newspaper. He's wearing flip-flops. It's terrible.
"Are you talking to yourself, or to me?"
. One of them is called
"Yes," Ron says, eyes narrowing. He glances at Harry. "Is he going to be a problem?"
"Have a biscuit." He offers her the plate again, and rather than remove to the sitting room, they stay where they are, leaning against the kitchen counter. The silence, when it comes, stays.
"Yeah," Harry says. "It does."
When Harry comes back with his tea, it's actually dark outside. He brings Draco a cup and saucer, and waits whilst Draco makes a space for it on his desk. It's probably the first time Harry's been in Draco's study, if Draco really thinks about it. Nobody's ever really come in here. Even his mother had recognised it as his own domain and rather left him to it.
Harry nods. "Mostly. Have you?"
Harry's smile is sort of sadly lopsided. "It was a long time ago."
"When I wake up." Draco recalls years of burying his face in his pillows and waking up to hump his little cock against the sheets until he comes with it. "If I shower or bathe. If I'm working at home and it's lunchtime. When I get into bed. When I'm going to sleep."
Harry throws Draco a look of sheer exhilaration, and then sets off at a run for the pitch, broom in hand. He’s kicking off and soaring up into the air practically before Draco’s even putting down the little case of snitches he’s brought with him.
Harry's gaze doesn't waver. "There isn't another table."
"Thanks for coming over," Harry says. "Are we still on for Monday night, me coming over?" He's talking to Hermione but Draco's still staring at him.
"Don't be. Don't be sorry. We'll figure this out, I promise. I promise."
Draco eats that piece, and another piece, and another piece. He eats a fourth piece and there's sugar on his nipples and on Harry's fingertips and across his cheek. There's so much sugar, like the tin is full of it, like tiny sweets against a sea bed of sugar, and it's got everywhere.
And after a while, Draco stops trembling and starts shivering instead, so Harry helps him to his feet, and into the bedroom. He dresses Draco, even though he's undressed too, and it's Draco's job to make sure that Harry's looked after. He won't take no for an answer, even putting Draco's socks on for him, until he's in his trousers and his shirt and his jumper and warm again. Then Harry pulls on his soft, elasticated trousers, and a t-shirt and a sweater, and finds a pair of socks in his bag.
He licks and licks, until Harry's fingers are spit wet and shiny, and there's no more come to be had.
"My good little boy," Draco says again, and Harry shudders in his arms, burying his face in Draco's neck. "I'm going to look after you," he says. "This isn't impossible. This is a fantasy you can have."
"Don't see why not," Harry says. "You want cream cakes and you don't think you can have them. You want sex that makes you feel dirty, and you don't think you can have it unless you're pretending to be somebody else and only doing it with strangers. Have a cake."
Heathen clearly doesn't think very much of Draco, which is perhaps understandable considering Draco's concerted attempt to blend into the background - he's wearing a pair of
"You and M&S," Draco says, remembering their trip there some weeks ago, when Harry had held his hand and made him go on those awful underground moving stairways, and bought him his soft pyjamas, and then kissed him outside afterwards. "We do have plenty of good shops where you can buy food here, you know."
"Relatively frequently," Draco says, without making eye contact.
"Mine," Harry says again, and he reaches for the tiny cloth bag on the pillow beside them, and opening it up, comes out with a box of chocolates far bigger than the bag itself. "Look what I've got for you," he says, and takes off the lid. There are rows of exquisite, expensive chocolates that clearly cost the earth.
“I like giving you sweets. I like how soft you are. I like making you come. I like you being my piglet.”
Harry keeps his hand in Draco's hair, and doesn't let go.
"You're still mine. Even when we're in there and you're looking after me. You're still mine."
"Once we've got these two down we can sit down and properly relax," Hermione says, taking Hugo back from Harry. "We're running a bit behind. And, uh, Ron and I can toss a coin for who gets to drink more than a single glass of wine tonight."
"Settle down," Harry says again, still stroking Draco's hair, and Draco can't, he's too close to the edge and it feels too much like his insides are clamouring to get out. "Just stay still, Piglet, and keep my cock warm."
Harry keeps on fucking his thighs, but he comes too, following after Draco in less than a minute, breathless and panting against Draco's shoulder.
"There you go," Harry says. "Such a good piglet."
Harry, for a second, looks so desperately full of longing that it hurts. "Please don't do that. Please. Because if you say no now--"
Harry hums. He's still stroking Draco's hair, but sometimes his fingers dip lower, over the collar of Draco's shirt and down over his back. "I think we did too."
Harry holds on tighter. "Help me," he says. "Help me not feel this way anymore."
was startlingly true.
"You look after me," Harry says. "It's not one-way."
Harry doesn't ask him to move and Draco doesn't volunteer. He stays where he is until Harry nudges him with his toe and wipes his hand off on Draco's thigh.
This time Harry catches icing sugar between his finger and thumb, and holds it over Draco's chest before letting go. He leans in after it, catching it on his tongue.
"You told me to come," Draco says.
Draco's insides feel a little like a catherine wheel. "I was thinking," he says, "of extending you an invitation. I thought perhaps you might like to join me in Scotland for a weekend. I have a house there. It's rather remote. I've updated the wards and there's a Quidditch pitch. You could fly and no one would notice."
"You said I could suck you," Draco says instead. "You said I could make you come."
He's in the early stages of his ward design. The scrolls are mainly notes.This project is warding entirely from the ground up, and he's going to have to dismantle whatever's there already before making a start on adding his own, signature wards. It means an added layer of complication to his spells, as he'll have to construct a temporary system of wards that will protect the property whilst not affecting any of the charms he'll be building for the permanent protection. Normally he builds on whatever's already there, for sheer ease, and because doing it the other way is significantly more expensive. Significantly so.
"No," Draco says, because he wants to wait. "I haven't done anything to deserve it."
"Scruffy," Draco says.
Draco does. He needs indulging, and spoiling, and to be told what to do. He nibbles at the bread, licking up melted butter from Harry's thumb.
"Put your knickers on," Harry says, nudging Draco's knee with his toes. "Then show them off to me."
Harry's face brightens as he smiles. "Thank fuck," he says. "Because I've never been happier in my life."
“He did,” Harry says. He glances at Draco, then away from him. He reaches out with the back of his hand and touches it to Draco’s. “If you’re the beast in a castle, does that make me Beauty?”
"What are you?" Harry asks, taking away his fingers. He presses them to Draco's little hole, that last spot where his virginity remains and his real life worth outside of Harry is nothing. He strokes in little, lick-wet circles, but doesn't press in.
"That's a pet shop," Draco says, and his voice catches.
Draco nods. He can't do other; Harry's fingertip is pressing inside of him, slick and intrusive and touching him, over and over so that all Draco can do is humiliate himself with the kinds of soft, almost-squeaky noises that he's never known himself make before. He squirms beneath Harry's touch, unable to keep still. He wants to open his legs wider, wants Harry to give him more, but Harry remains frustratingly, purposefully slow.
There's something there, Draco can tell. A bit more of the jigsaw. Pieces he didn't have before. Harry's testing the waters, but for what, Draco doesn't know. "You can talk to me," he says finally. "You can tell me about it. You can even tell me which bits are supposed to be the funny bits so I'll laugh."
"No," Draco says, rubbing his hand over his little, stupid cock.
They eat a light lunch of cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches by the French windows in a small dining room Draco’s never eaten in before. There’s a light Ceylon in the pot, and for dessert, a small selection of cakes that Draco had chosen the previous day. Harry has been quiet all morning, ever since they’d left the nursery and — for want of something better to do — had settled in the sitting room with books and the record player. Harry has never really struck Draco as being the kind of person to enjoy reading quietly, but maybe he’d needed the mental space as much as Draco had.
"Yes," Harry says. "Like I said. I'll hold your hand if we do anything scary."
"I can understand that." Harry reaches over and slips his hand into Draco’s. "I’m all right, you know."
“You want my whole fucked up childhood?”
Harry leans against the door frame. He's wearing one of the new pairs of jeans they'd bought when they'd gone shopping together and subsequently altered; they're cut to his actual shape and not a vague approximation of a human, like everything had been in Harry's wardrobe before Draco had got his hands on it. Tonight he's wearing dark, indigo jeans that follow the shape of his leg and fit snugly around the crotch, and one of his new blue shirts with the top button open. He's stepped it up a level and is wearing one of the waistcoats Draco had demanded he buy.
"Not yet, you're not," Harry says, and there's a little
, Harry had said, and maybe he was right.
Draco is oddly close to tears. He nods, his cheek still cupped in Harry's hand.
"Wank," he says. "I know you want to. Look how hard that little dick is."
"About you, mostly," Harry says. They're in the red sitting room, Draco sitting and Harry lying down with his head pillowed in Draco's lap. It's perhaps the only time in Draco's life he's ever sat like this.
"Are you breaking up with me?"
"No, I looked at you and I knew. Glamours don’t disguise your mannerisms. I’ve been watching you for years. Or I had. I’d mostly retired that habit because you weren’t in my eye line all that frequently."
"Got any more you haven't told me about? London and the Highlands? Anywhere else?"
Jonathan doesn't look overly impressed. "Better a hole than not, I suppose," he says. "Is he not even going to clean himself up after last time?"
"It's all right," Draco says, stroking Harry's back. "I'll look after you. I've got you. It's all right, my darling. It's all right."
It's a muggle pub, a normal one just off the high street so it's not tremendously busy. The man from last night is seated over at the far side of the room, a drink in front of him.
"Every filthy thing you want, I'll give it to you," Harry carries on, and there's his second finger, pressing inside of him alongside the first. "I'll fuck you covered in cake, I'll feed you chocolate until you're filthy with it, until you've got it everywhere and your cocklet's so stiff you're begging for me to let you come. I'll show you off in that club, show everyone how much you're desperate to be humiliated, put you in your collar and your lead and have you warm my cock all night so that everyone can see. I'll make you masturbate into a bowl and then lap it up, and I'll bring you home and I'll make you do it again, just for me. I'll make you do it all again, all of it just for me, Draco, make you rub yourself off until you come, no hands, like you're my piglet. Give you everything that's in that head of yours, everything you've ever come wanting, every dirty, depraved thing you've ever thought about. I'll give it all to you." He slips in a third finger alongside the second, and Draco is maddened with it, whimpering at the thought of what Harry's offering him, his skin flushed with sweat. "I'll give it all to you, every last thing you've ever wanted, my darling, because I love you so fucking much. I love you. Are you ready for my cock, love? Are you ready for me to fuck you?"
"And not even that very well," Harry says conversationally. "Can you even imagine what you look like right now?"
"I know you don't," Draco says. "But it's so all right that you do. I'm going to make it all right for you. I promise." He leans in so he can wrap his arms around Harry's shoulders, and pull him into a hug.
"Can't imagine he will, no," Harry says, unconcerned, and Draco makes up his mind to not even wipe his mouth until they leave. "Dirty piglet."
In his hall at home, ward specifications already dropped on the hall table, he holds the coin in his palm as the message glows bright.
"To humiliate me," Draco says dryly.
"Educated guess," Harry says. "How close did I come?"
"Yeah," Draco says. "And it's lovely, being that soft."
. "I've never been anyone's boyfriend."
"No," Harry says. "I let myself have as much chocolate as I want, whenever I want it."
That desperate, cut-off noise that Harry makes really is a sob, and Draco can't help but wonder how long Harry's been dreaming of this, needing it and believing he couldn't ever be looked after like he wants. Believing he couldn't ever be loved like that.
"That can't be true, though," Draco says. "You're Harry Potter." He'd known, objectively, that Harry had grown up with Muggles, and - rumour had it - Muggles that hadn't particularly cared that much about The Boy Who Lived, but there was a material difference between not caring that much, and not caring at all. Ginny had said that he'd grown up with nobody. At the time, he'd thought it might have been an exaggeration.
When Harry looks behind him, he looks surprised for no more than a second. "Of course," he says, and turns his attention back to the mirror. When he turns back around, he's taller too, darker, not a mirror image of his glamour from that first night, but like his older brother, or his cousin, or someone else that's close but not too close. "Ready to go?"
Harry's bedroom looks - and smells - different after 24 hours. Draco has opened the windows and aired the room, just like the house elves used to do back in the manor, and he's used every cleaning spell he has at his disposal to make the room as spotless as he can manage. Everything's gone from the room, books and bits and pieces and clothes and memories. The painting of the stag and the dog and the wolf is down from the wall.
Draco would shiver if he could, but he can't. He lies there, holes out. His cock leaks. Drool dribbles down onto the rug.
Nevertheless, Draco doesn't complain when Harry feeds him a sticky, cream covered half of a raisin scone, and he doesn't complain when Harry settles in next to him, arms around him, after the scone's finished and Draco's sleepy against his chest.
The thing is, Draco just wants to be treated like he's nothing. That's it. Like he's worthless, like he's less than human. Like he's just a hole, or holes, like he's a rag for people's come and nothing fucking more. It's settled, down deep in his chest, this need he has to be humiliated, to be shamed, to be taken and used and fucked and ignored and then afterwards, he can clean himself up, take down the glamour, and go back to being Draco Malfoy. Go back to being haughty and above it all and a fucking Malfoy, where nothing sticks and they just keep their heads held high until the noise dies down and the money starts coming in again.
“Initially by someone who had Voldemort’s head fused onto theirs,” Draco says, trying for lightness, but he’d been plagued with bad dreams for years about their first Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher and his awful secret. “Absolutely the stuff of nightmares.”
"Sir," Draco says, because it's the only thing that he can say, the only thing he's got to break the weird fucking tension in the room. He glances at the floor. There's bits of his lunch that have fallen off the plate and onto the floor. "I made a mess. I'll clean up."
"Because I'm your come rag," Draco says. "Because you can come on me and it doesn't matter. I don't matter."
"Indeed," Draco says, as Harry serves him new potatoes and unpacks the contents of a foil pack of the rest of his meal. It looks really nice, even if it comes directly out of cookware. He waits whilst Harry pours them both a glass of wine, and then sits down, before holding up his glass for a toast. "To the chef."
Draco makes a sharp, desperate noise in the back of his throat.
"Indeed," Harry says again. "Hermione did make me talk to someone, you know. A couple of different people. About the residual trauma, apparently."
Draco stands up and takes his trousers and his top off. He leaves his underwear on, but Harry shakes his head.
"A start," Draco says. "And beyond that?"
There is a fleeting glimpse of something that looks quite desperately like want that Harry allows to show on his face for a fraction of a moment.
"No, I mean--" Harry stops. "Hagrid came to get me. On my birthday. It was the first time anyone had ever told me about magic. He took me to Diagon Alley to get my school things, and sent me into Madam Malkin's, and there you were. Talking about racing brooms."
Harry looks at him. "Do you want some?"
Harry takes one look at him, and smirks. "Oh no," he says, stepping back so that Draco can step inside Harry's house. "That's not going to do at all."
"All right," Harry says, but he doesn't suggest any names. He just keeps running his fingers down first one dragon's back, then the other, and smiling when they purr.
"You like that, don't you'?" Harry goes on. He comes and crouches in front of Draco, elbows to his knees. "You actually like being made to clean up your mess with your tongue."
Someone whose cock isn't stupid and useless and tiny and so, so fucking hard.
"Was that there before?"
Harry looks momentarily amused. "Indeed," he says. "Would you like a cup?"
"Shhh," Harry says. "I'm about to ask if I can come on your face."
"Don't know," Harry says. "Maybe have my own fun."
Whatever it is they're doing, Draco doesn't want it to end either.
"I suppose," Draco says. "I can tell you where I normally buy them from."
"Do you want to see the other rooms?" Draco asks, when Harry doesn't move from where he's still looking at the fireplace.
"I can't," Harry says. "Molly Weasley made them for us."
"Is that a bad thing?"
Harry's already unbuttoning his jeans, nodding towards the single cubicle. "In there and on your knees," he says.
“Honestly,” Harry says, “you should try being the one who touched him and had him fucking disintegrate all over you, that’s more nightmarish. I think I inhaled that dust.”
Draco watches him go. He's ruined their evening, their lovely, quiet evening together, and he can't help but feel guilty about how Harry had prepared for it, dressing up, cooking, bringing music with him so they could be together. Harry fumbles with the case on top of the record player, and then with the small stack of records. The one he picks has a black sleeve, but Draco can't see any more of it than that.
He doesn’t open his eyes until afterwards, when Harry’s untying his hands and pressing his thumbs to the insides of Draco’s wrists. Harry’s mouth follows his thumbs, a slow kiss pressed to each of Draco’s hands.
