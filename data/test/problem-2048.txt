Harry untangled himself from Draco and led him to the center of the small stone labyrinth that meandered its way over the ground. When Harry pointed to the words engraved there, Draco knelt to read them.
Harry looked down at Malfoy, whose eyes were already closed. He hesitated for only a moment before removing his own trousers and placing his glasses carefully on the windowsill. He lay down on his back, head turned toward Malfoy. He could see the ridges of the other man’s spine through his thin shirt. Harry shivered and closed his eyes.
Either way, he couldn’t think of anywhere else he’d rather be, so he lay down in the grass and brooded. But after a time, he found that he wasn’t quite as miserable as he expected to be.
It had been almost two weeks since they discovered that the golden dust signified protective magic, and Draco had barely taken a break since. He came to bed late and woke up early. In between, he’d kiss Harry breathless, rousing him from sleep to whisper about base liquids or an anomalous reaction. Even drowsy and painfully hard, Harry liked hearing Draco talk about his potions, so he did his best to concentrate. And he’d managed to pick up quite a bit from Draco’s monologues while waiting to come. He understood that Draco was performing elaborate tests on the properties of the flowers, working toward a series of reactions that would give him enough information to brew something that would shield them from the hooks.
He had expected Potter to be angry, had expected him to lash out at Draco for intruding on his grief. But Potter was surprisingly
What had helped the most though, was McGonagall’s announcement that Padma would make a full recovery. Luna’s water-repelling charm had somehow been twisted to drain all the fluids from Padma’s body. Madame Pomphrey was in the process of rehydrating her, which was a slow, but thankfully simple process.
Draco told Harry about his day, spinning stories out of his interactions with odd or irritating customers. Harry laughed and teased and asked questions, drawing every tiny detail out of Draco. Then Harry spent a good ten minutes speaking rapturously about a new Kickboxing move he was trying to master. Draco understood almost none of it, but he was charmed all the same.
Luna was narrating the chess game as if it were a bedtime story. Having missed the beginning, Harry was a little confused, but he found himself sympathizing with the plight of Luna’s queen, who had lost her love in a faerie war and was traveling west to find refuge from famine and drought.
Harry frowned, the guilt giving way to prickles of anger. But then Ginny continued, and Harry understood.
But Harry’s gaze kept returning to Ron’s eyes, which were overflowing with shining golden tears. The shimmery orbs floated toward Harry, airy and insubstantial as sunlight.
Draco looked entirely unruffled by Harry’s sudden appearance. He straightened his back and let the blanket fall away from his shoulders. There was a cup of tea and a fat book resting on the mahogany table beside him.
And then, slowly – oh so torturously slowly – Draco slid down his sweatpants and pants together, revealing his skin inch by inch.
Finding Lavender such an enthusiastic dueling partner had surprised Harry at first, but the shock had quickly faded. She had fought in the war too, after all, and she seemed to need the dueling club for the same reasons Harry did. Dueling was an outlet; it swallowed the aggressions and quicksilver reflexes the war had bred in them, the thirst for action that had not been quenched with Voldemort’s defeat. For an hour every morning they could lash out, fight and strike and stumble and curse, all without the world being at stake.
The sensation of falling wasn’t as strong this time, though Harry still staggered as he landed. He tripped over his own feet and promptly toppled onto a purple sofa.
“What?” Harry exclaimed, fork falling from his hand with a clatter. “Merlin, Malfoy! I’m so sorry. You really should have woken me.”
Draco had just started forward to join them, wanting to give George his thanks as well, when Blaise slung an arm over Draco’s shoulder.
“I know you did not wish to continue your formal education after the war, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall had said matter-of-factly, “and I do not begrudge you that decision. But this is a different sort of schooling. They seek innovation, and they allow their pupils many paths to discovery. They’re based in London, and would provide you with resources and connections while affording you independent control of your research. You would do well to apply, as would Mr. Malfoy. I would be happy to provide you both with a recommendation.”
Harry moaned shamelessly. Draco’s cock was much thicker than his fingers, and it burned as Harry tried to adjust around him. But it was so good, already so good, Draco stretching Harry, making him feel so gloriously full.
They burst through the door together, Maeve right on Draco’s heels. Embarrassingly, Draco was a bit out of breath. He huffed in displeasure and tried not to wince as he glanced around him.
Draco hummed thoughtfully as he tied his bag closed. “I base my teas on experiences,” he finally offered. “I hold a moment in my mind and I reach for flavors the memory evokes. There is a lot of trial and error involved, but eventually the taste matches the feelings and I know the blend is done.” He tilted his head down with a self-deprecating smile. “I know it sounds daft, but –”
It was quite pleasant, sitting quietly with Draco and looking out over the sculpted grounds of Hogwarts, though there wasn’t much worth spying on. The Unspeakable shifted around enough for them to see that she wasn’t in any type of uniform, just inconspicuous black robes, but there was still no magic that they could discern, even when Harry reached out with Sentiomancy. She appeared to be doing no more than intensely observing the flowers.
“I – I apologize.” Draco lowered his head, even as embers of anger still burned in his stomach. “It will not happen again,” he promised.
“Were you thinking about me?” Draco gasped as Harry’s fingers teased his still-clothed erection, thumb and forefinger rubbing the head of Draco’s cock. “The first time this happened?”
“Thank you, Hermione,” Draco said, as he settled next to Harry. He was careful to keep a foot of space between their chairs. “It’s really very kind of you to help.”
“It is unusual,” McGonagall mused, “for a wizard to be able to sense magic without first learning to see it, but I suppose it is not unheard of. Advanced Aperiomancy is not considered very useful, so it is not often studied.”
His shirt was already buttoned and he was smoothing down his jumper over top, looking remarkably composed for someone who wasn’t yet wearing trousers. Harry was still in just pants, peering mournfully down at his damp jeans. He grimaced and pulled them on with a shudder.
“Y-you’re ok?” Malfoy stammered. He ran his hands up Harry’s arms and down his back, as if checking for injuries.
“Of course it is, Potter.” McGonagall waved a hand dismissively. “You are utilizing your own magic to directly access the echoes of other magic. That is Aperiomancy.”
When the sun went down, they went their separate ways, Draco back to his flat and Harry to have supper with Andromeda and Teddy. Harry spent one or two evenings a week with them, wanting to be there for his godson. Recently, he had started asking Draco to join him, and Draco thought that eventually he would.
“I plan to cycle through the five wands, casting several different Dark Magic spells with each. Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, please remain in these exact positions until I tell you I am finished. If either of you need me to stop for any reason, simply say the word and I will do so immediately. Am I understood?”
It felt good, to laugh like this with Ginny. Harry had missed her, even if he hadn’t missed their relationship. Months without her had left a hole in his life, in his family, that was now filled.
As Draco sucked in a startled breath, Harry tackled him, pushing him down onto the plush rug. On all fours above him, Harry smoldered down at Draco. “You know, darling, I’ve been thinking.”
Harry chuckled softly, a little sheepish, but mostly relieved. It didn’t seem to matter so much, now that he’d finally allowed himself to think things through.
Potter took a long sip of his tea, closing his eyes as he swallowed. Then he grinned, only a tad self-consciously, and gestured at the table. “These are for afternoon tea, or for a drink before bed. I use whichever suits the mood of the day.” His eyes crinkled at the corners. “Like I said, silly.”
The silence grew heavy. Finally, Harry cleared his throat. “Can I – ?” he asked, gesturing to the bandages he was holding.
that he couldn’t help starting to giggle. Draco moaned once in frustration, then dropped his head onto Harry’s shoulder, smothering his own giggles.
Harry chuckled along with him, then clarified. “No, I mean – I was looking forward to you coming over, and I was excited to show you the hammock, but it wasn’t like I
They rutted against each other in frantic thrusts, Harry’s hands sweeping down Draco’s back until they reached his arse. He pulled Draco into him, squeezing and kneading those perfect globes as Draco shuddered and keened and licked Harry’s throat in encouragement.
With that, Tahlyn strode across the room, leveling her wand at the beds. Draco hurried out of the way as a pale glow enveloped the jerking bodies. Tahlyn’s wand darted and swooped as if she were dueling, but despite the constant motion, her spell held steady.
Harry blinked. He was surprised Draco remembered him saying that – he’d been panicking about his first Weasley family lunch at the time and hadn’t seemed to be absorbing any of Harry’s reassurances.
Harry opened his mouth to Draco, reveling in the softness of his lips and the hint of apple tartness left over from the makeshift bludgers. He tightened his grip on Draco’s wrists and melted into the kiss.
Harry licked Draco’s stomach, following the line of his waistband. “Did you need a break from research?”
But Harry remembered the Forbidden Forest and what Draco had done for him there, remembered how Draco had
“My thought,” Hermione continued, “is that the potion’s magic got knotted into the magic of your life-debts, invoking them indirectly.”
Harry was in the middle of cursing himself for not wandering over to the courtyard during breakfast –
After a few moments, Draco stepped back. He looked up at sky, like he always did when he was about to say something that made him feel vulnerable. But then he surprised Harry by lowering his head and meeting Harry’s eyes.
“Yes,” Draco said, seeming surprised that Harry had noticed. His fingers twitched toward his pocket, but he did not take out the notebook. Instead, he moved his hand to rest on Harry’s knee. “I’m sorry I’ve been so busy,” he said, giving Harry a little squeeze. “How’s your dueling?”
“Not to worry, dear. It’s quite simple. Look up the theories of Glendelwelltrod. His book will get you started, and if you have any questions, you can write to me in Peru.”
He stretched his arm out and cast again, conjuring over and over, until a dozen glowing orbs floated above him, illuminating the tiny space in shades of blue and pink and green. Still clutching his wand, Draco wrapped a blanket around himself. He settled back against the wall, frozen in place as he stared up at the evidence of his magic.
Sadness descended like a shroud, the absence of Fred suddenly shadowing the stairwell. Harry rested a hand on Ginny’s shoulder.
But when Harry invited Draco back to the cottage, Draco said no, claiming he’d need an early start in the morning. It was not a lie – he had heaps of work waiting for him at the tea shop – but it was not the whole truth either. This thing between them – well, it seemed too good to be true, and Draco could not help but feel the need to ration it.
“I don’t regret it either, Gin,” Harry said. “I’m still sorry, though. I should have seen that you were unhappy.”
Maeve was two weeks into the search for new shop assistants to work with Draco while she was in Peru. Draco had protested the decision at first, arguing that Maeve had handled the shop perfectly well alone before hiring Draco. Maeve had gone a bit cagey at that, bustling away from Draco as she called “that’s not quite true, dear” over her shoulder. Suspicious, Draco had tried to follow, but Maeve simply bundled empty tea tins into his arms, pointed him toward the storeroom, and told him not to bother her while she was writing up the advert.
“No, hang on,” Harry interrupted. “I wasn’t hurt the night Draco popped into my bedroom. I just had a bad dream.”
Draco huffed a small, embarrassed laugh, but he let Harry comb out the bits of dried leaves with his fingers.
Harry’s vision went black for a second, but as he struggled through a few breaths, he realized that the ground felt no harder than a firm mattress. He moved his limbs gingerly, sighing in relief when they obeyed him.
The simplest explanation would be that Potter’s cottage had exceptionally effective wards, which was entirely plausible. Potter still appeared in the papers often enough to indicate that his fame had not eroded with the end of the war, and it would be prudent of him to take precautions with his home. Still, as much as Draco would have liked to believe this idea, wards kept intruders
Draco sucked on Harry’s lower lip and wiggled his hips in silent assent, somehow entwining his fingers with Harry’s as they both slipped out of their pants.
“How could the Ministry do that to him?” Harry cried, the words bursting from him in violent spirals of frustration and sorrow. “Bad enough they took all his money, but his magic too? What was he supposed to do? If he hadn’t stumbled into his job at the tea shop, would he have been out on the street?” The last bit of the tirade was high-pitched and breathy, as Harry struggled against the tears building in his throat.
“No, it is,” Harry admitted. He pulled off his glasses and tossed them onto the table, massaging the bridge of his nose. “I know that. And you have every right to be mad.” Harry paused, letting his hand drop into his lap. “But I couldn’t stop thinking about your Potions formulas.”
Draco demanded, belatedly processing Maeve’s earlier comment. He craned his neck to meet her eyes. “That long for
Harry happened upon Draco rather sooner than he expected, in a long, open-air corridor that overlooked the grounds. A swarm of butterflies fluttered to life in Harry’s stomach. Smiling softly, he made his way to where Draco stood, framed by an enormous arched window. His elbows were resting against the stone ledge as he surveyed the gardens below.
“Oh, pish posh,” Maeve cried, suddenly appearing out of nowhere, as if she had apparated into their midst.
“That place was terrifying,” Draco insisted, a bit defensively. Harry pressed a kiss to the top of his head and hummed apologetically. “Yet part of me longed to explore it. I never felt that way at the Manor. I would never have thought to explore those gardens. They were so strictly controlled – only one way to grow, only one way to
over and over against Harry’s neck and chest and mouth. And when Draco had finally pushed inside of Harry, their magics mingling together as if they had always been one, Harry shook beneath him, entirely overwhelmed by the depth of his love.
Distracted by the muscles rippling beneath Will’s burnished bronze skin, Harry had to shake himself out of a daze. He huffed out a laugh, surprised at himself. He must be feeling jealous of Will’s indefatigable energy, which was rather silly. Putting it out of mind, Harry snatched his water bottle from the ground and chugged the remnants as he headed to the locker room.
Draco closed his eyes again, tilting his head up to catch the breeze. Outside the window, a squirrel chittered, and a corner of Draco’s mouth quirked at the noise.
McGonagall’s hands were flat on her desk as she leaned toward them. She opened her mouth, likely to further berate them, but then something shifted behind her eyes. Her fingers stuttered, and she moved them to grip the edge of the desk.
Draco rolled his shoulders until he found a comfortable position. Watching, Harry shivered, desperate to cover Draco’s body with his own.
Draco trembled and slowly lowered his arm. Pupils blown wide, irises the color of a storm-tossed sea, he fixed his gaze on Harry. Without breaking eye contact, Harry brought his hand to Draco’s cock and began to pump. Draco’s eyes fluttered closed then, so Harry lowered his head and enveloped him once more in his mouth.
As he was pouring them each a second cup, Draco eyed Harry nervously. He wrapped his hands around his mug and said softly, “I have nightmares too.”
“I can’t wait to see it,” Harry said. He squeezed Draco tightly to his chest. “I’m so proud of you.”
“It’s alright. I just finished my run, and I was planning to come over here anyway.” Harry swiped his sweaty hair away from his eyes with a grimace. “I was gonna shower first, though. I’m sorry if I smell.”
Blaise’s expression hardened into something more brazen, and bizarrely, for a fleeting second, Draco found that comforting.
“To apologize,” Harry said. The word fell heavily from his tongue, the weight of it only increasing with Draco’s obvious confusion. “I’m just trying to work out what to say. Which I probably should have done before showing up on your doorstep –” Harry bit his lip and looked away – “but I missed you, and I couldn’t wait any longer.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed softly. He wanted to tell Andie that potions were only made from turtle shells once they had died of natural causes. But that most likely was not true, and he did not want to lie to her. Young as she was, she had the intense, inquiring eyes of a burgeoning scholar. Andie was a knowledge seeker, just like Draco.
“No need to play coy with me, dear,” Maeve said. She stood with a grimace and massaged her lower back. “I’ve seen the way you look at him.”
Draco watched him with a faint expression of distaste. “I would have made you a fresh cup, had you asked.” He sniffed in disapproval.
“You’re not getting rid of me that easily, Malfoy,” he said. He rubbed a thumb gently across Draco’s cheekbone, softening the teasing words.
Well, we've reached the end! This story became far longer (and took far longer!) than I ever expected. Thank you so much for reading! I hope it has brought you a little joy during the craziness and sorrow of this pandemic, as it has for me. Love to all! Please stay safe <3
Harry closed his hand into a fist, severing the connection. His magic snapped back into him just as McGonagall cried,
“Will you transfigure this?” Draco asked, shame clouding his eyes for only a second before he fiercely blinked it away. “Into a cloth bag?”
Harry hissed and jerked upright, rubbing at his cheek. He had just been sideswiped by the bristles of a broom. Giggles floated back toward him as the culprit zoomed away. Harry sighed, then let out a yelp as another broom collided with his knee. Ignoring the stabbing pain, he looked down at the small boy who had fallen onto the grass. Wide brown eyes stared up at Harry in alarm.
Harry glanced sharply out the window at the gathering dusk. Without slowing his pace, he sighed and massaged his temples. It was getting harder and harder to pretend that this delay was due to anything other than his own nerves.
Draco cupped Harry’s face in his palms and kissed him tenderly. “Thank you,” he murmured. “This is a lovely first date.”
“He modified the spell,” Harry went on, “and he thinks he should be able to use it to – er, pull the potion out of us, like. Untangle it.”
“Something happened in a duel with Lavender. It was the morning after you found out about Maeve –” Harry winced slightly, but Draco just nodded, waiting calmly for Harry to go on. “I was distracted, worried about you – and I couldn’t focus. Lavender caught me in a full body-bind, and I don’t know what I was thinking, but I just twisted out of it using a kickboxing move. And then I blocked her next spell with a Shield Charm, but I moved my arms like I was doing a kickboxing block. It was so strong it practically knocked her over.”
Wasting no time, Harry plopped down onto the stool beside Draco. “I liked Maeve. And this shop is brilliant! How many different teas do you have? It seemed like dozens!” He swiveled on the stool and beamed at Draco. “Do you make them all? Right here? I’ve never thought about how tea is made before. What do we need to do?”
For a moment, Draco just stared at Harry. The memory of Draco’s screams seemed to echo in the space between them. Tears pricked at the corners of Draco’s eyes. He was ashamed that Harry had seen him like that, and yet profoundly grateful that he hadn’t had to face it alone.
Draco groaned and collapsed back in his armchair. He crossed his arms and stared up into the branches overhead. One of his legs bounced up and down erratically.
The flowers seemed to be leading them somewhere. The delicate blooms stretched across the walls in trailing vines, slowly, ever so slowly, growing thicker and more obvious. The more flowers there were to follow, the more quickly Harry and Malfoy moved, until they were practically sprinting down the (blessedly empty) halls. Harry took a moment to silently praise McGonagall for creating such flexible eighth year schedules. When you have an enemy –
As the sound reverberated throughout the room, growing shrill enough to resemble a Banshee’s shriek, the flowers trembled and dropped petals on the bodies beneath them. They seemed to be straining to reach the patients.
The silence slipped into the cracks between them, but Blaise spoke before it could harden into a wall.
Concerned, Harry moved toward Draco, only to stutter to a shocked halt when he caught a glimpse of what lay beyond the rocky ledge. White nothingness stretched in all directions, the cave and its cliffside floating in an otherwise blank canvas, the painting unfinished. In the distance, darkness seethed, a tiny spot threatening to grow. Harry knew that in the center of it, there would be a dead body, drenched in blood.
“Right, sorry.” Harry crossed the room and sat on the edge of the coffee table, knees knocking against Draco’s. He gazed up at the painting above the sofa, lavender fields in the sunrise, the plants swaying gently in a slight wind. “It’s just – I didn’t really find out anything. I cast every Dark spell I could think of – er, except the Killing Curse, that is.” Harry’s breath stuttered, but then Draco placed a hand on his knee and he felt able to continue. “Anyway, no hooks. Well, no new ones at least. There’s always some hanging around people, so there were a few already on me.”
McGonagall cleared her throat pointedly, then continued speaking as if there had been no interruption. “But for everything we have lost, there are also things we have gained. Hogwarts is the finest institution of magical learning in the world, but there are ways in which it has failed you. All of you. And we will not repeat those failures. Every single person in this room has made mistakes.”
“I was actually looking forward to this class,” Harry admitted. “I really wanted to be able to do this.”
All at once, Harry’s mouth was gone, leaving Draco shivering in the cool air of the bedroom. Steadying himself with a firm grip on Draco’s bicep, Harry leaned sideways, his other arm groping beneath his pillows. Draco whined needily, but it was only a second before Harry was back, drizzling lube over their leaking cocks.
Draco had blushed. every. single. time. He’d even squirmed a little at first. But he never once pulled away or tensed up or asked Harry to stop.
“It was the only way,” Draco said after a moment, the words surprisingly calm. “If I cast nothing, there would have been no residual Dark Magic in the room. The Carrows would have noticed.”
The smirk widened, Draco remaining stubbornly motionless until Harry settled back against the tub. Then his finger moved again, down Harry’s chest this time, and Harry could barely breathe. Draco was trailing fire along his skin, carving pathways of desire as Harry shuddered, nearly weeping with need. It was the ghost of a touch, a barely-there whisper, and yet Harry felt Draco’s fingertip like it was a tongue pressed against his cock.
“You’re right.” Hermione nodded, losing her contemplative look. “It’s not a curse. I don’t think we should disregard the possibility of a bond, but it sounds more like some sort of life-debt situation to me.”
“Maeve was bustling around, the merriest person I’d ever seen, and she recommended this shortbread, all orange flavor and spice. It was delicious, and the shop felt so – right. Warm and safe and hidden almost, from everything I was afraid of. I went back, every day, and Maeve would talk to me, about tea-making and baking and magical theory. And then, only a few days after the Ministry acquitted me, Maeve offered me a job.”
He liked the lack of ceremony. It was the antithesis of everything he’d been born to, anti-pureblood tradition in the best possible way. It was just Draco, stripped down to the bone. No familial expectations, no prodding or posturing or punishments, no Death Eater business creeping in at night. Just Draco, just the person he should have been, maybe even
“Is independently magical. That part of what I said was true. And it can definitely interfere with other magical processes.”
Harry kissed Draco on the cheek, then wandered over to George. He clapped him on the back, thanking him for his part in setting things right.
It was just after dawn, and the two wizards were in the courtyard outside the Great Hall, using Harry’s not-Aperiomancy magic (
“What about the tea shop?” Harry asked, suddenly queasy at the thought of Draco losing the little workshop that seemed so much a part of him.
Molly offered a spoonful of gravy to Draco, who sipped on it daintily and murmured something about what the subtleties of the spicing “evoked.” The comment didn’t entirely make sense to Harry, but he was still charmed to bits. He padded across the worn rose floor tiles and wrapped an arm around Draco from behind.
Harry had returned from the castle a few hours ago. After visiting the hospital wing and updating McGonagall on their progress, he had indulged himself with a quick wash (and wank) in the Gryffindor showers before procuring breakfast.
Maeve was deep into her Christmas baking as well. The air smelled of cinnamon and peppermint, and row upon row of chocolate biscuits were cooling by the stove. Draco was tempted to steal one, but Maeve did not break her stride.
Malfoy’s stare was no longer comforting. Harry could feel the tension mounting between them. It wasn’t hostile, but there was still a challenge in it. Harry resisted the urge to back away.
Harry wasn’t sure where Malfoy was going with this, but he listened patiently. Because it felt like Malfoy was offering him something.
been deliberately focusing on needing a dinner guest, after all. He frowned, unnerved by how unpleasant it felt to even skirt the truth while speaking to Potter. He imagined his younger self laughing at him. The frown deepened.
“I know that,” Draco said, voiced tinged with frustration. He closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the wall.
He blinked down at his socked feet, too weary to know what to do next. Breathing raggedly, Draco slumped against the wall. And then the pain hit him, all at once. He sank to the ground, arms clenched tightly into his stomach, trying to hold it all inside.
With an impressive amount of self-control, Draco managed to set aside that tantalizing comment to ponder later, quickly casting around for a way to distract Hermione. She had regained her composure and looked far too interested in the mention of Draco’s “Potions theories.” The last thing he needed was another Gryffindor do-gooder to nag him about his restricted magic.
How so much of modern magic – both real and Muggle – had its roots in Egypt, or how many myths across the board could be explained by magical creatures or wizarding involvement. That Reginal Scot's
Running an absent hand through his fringe, Harry regarded himself briefly in the mirror. Von always did a good job; he had a hand for making his artwork appear natural that few others Harry had happened across could quite managed. It was no wonder Dot liked him. Besides that, he actually had stylistic taste that aligned somewhat with Harry's; despite that Harry never knew what he might find himself outfitted in on any given day, Von knew what suited him and enforced that knowledge to the overwhelming disregard of the other stylists at every shoot.
"Yeah. Yeah, probably. I'd like to branch out a bit though, you know? Work for a cause and all that. The opportunities are really endless, so I can basically head in whatever direction I want to."
Sparing a moment longer to glare up at Draco's ashen face, he harrumphed, looped PJ's leash around his hand, and stepped around him. He strode with chin raised down the footpath and didn't look back.
Harry blinked. A watchdog…? "She uses a magic charm to follow you around?" he said, instinctively lowering his tone before the risk of the surrounding crowd. "Isn't that kind of invasive?"
His friends were staring at him. Staring, silent and all but unresponsive, as he approached them once more. Ron looked little constipated again, Hermione was regarding Harry thoughtfully, and Ginny was darting her gaze between Harry and Draco so quickly she must have been giving herself a headache. It was she who spoke first.
Little enough was known about the students his C&C class would be meeting with for the coming few months. They were from up north, over the border into Scotland, and they were a boarding school. They supposedly wished to extend their reaches and community immersion by interacting on a more personal basis with some of the nearby schools.
"Can you just talk to me?" Harry demanded, glaring up at him with more frustration than he'd felt in a long time. Somehow, Draco always seemed able to coax his anger forth. Harry was hurting, aching from the sting of Draco's words, and
Harry shook his head. He rarely took the charm off nowadays, though Von never failed to ask him. "No, it's fine."
Harry stared at him. He glanced over his shoulder at James, at James' aggressive rage that trembled through every limb, to his trained wand then back to Draco. Draco, who still stared at him like he couldn't believe what he was seeing. Or
Harry sighed. Such ignorance. It was the same excuse, if not quite so maliciously spoken, as that given by the bullies who called him 'poof' or 'fairy'. "When you use it as an insult, it's not really just a description," Harry said.
"What, because you've never done it before?" Pansy scoffed and continued before he could speak. "Even if you haven't, you know this is a good opportunity. Just how far do you think you'll fall back down when these interviews are finished, Draco? You need something to keep you afloat when the industry will still be stabbing you with accusations. Don't tell me you haven't felt the effects already, because I know you have."
Did he want to keep playing quidditch? Yes. Of course he did. There were few things he loved more in the world than flying, and the game added an extra layer of excitement and competitiveness that Harry had never experienced in a sport before. And yet, after everything, coming back to Hogwarts and resuming the position and status he'd once held… Somehow, it didn't feel right.
Once, Harry hadn't believed there was such a thing as talent involved in modelling. How wrong he'd been, and how ardently he now embraced dissolution of that belief.
Harry wasn't sure what favour Draco was referring to. The companionship at lunch, maybe? But he didn't dwell on it. Diving into the sea of pedestrians, tugging his floppy hat a little further down his ears and his scarf a little higher up his chin, Harry extracted his phone from his pocket. With a huff of breath that just slightly misted the air before him, he raised it to his ear.
Harry slowly lowered his gaze down to his textbook once more. Considering only Cragstone's description, such a short segment when compared to the rest of the mind-numbing chapter, almost made him uneasy. Harry pursed his lips again. "You reckon I only have to read this bit?"
Draco blinked. His mouth opened then closed. He seemed at a momentary loss for words, which Harry silently congratulated himself for. Even better that his muteness didn't seem to be driven by disgruntlement but rather confusion. That was a very good thing. Harry had never been particularly good at keeping his thoughts to himself; blurting them out at inopportune moments had gotten him into a fix more than once. It was a good thing that Draco at least knew how he felt about him.
"A stigma?" Harry frowned. This house system seemed ridiculously exclusive. Or at least it did how Draco was describing it. Harry had thought they were simply a means of organisation. "What kind of stigma?"
Harry snorted. Then he dropped his gaze down between them, to his open jeans and Draco's own arousal still apparent through the front of his slacks. A brush of embarrassment passed briefly across the surface of Harry's thoughts but disappeared almost instantly. "Let me return the favour?" he asked, a question that held none of the nervousness Harry felt at the prospect of giving a blowjob for the first time.
"We never stayed in the one place for too long. It was move or risk being found by - by Riddle's followers."
"It extends beyond that, of course. The families impacted by the war, the kids who lost their parents, and my godson for starters, but also kids who have to struggle through domestic abuse and neglect, because I feel like they get little enough –"
There was so much that still needed to be said. Even after the previous day, after confessions flung and quietly voiced alike, after stares that spoke more than words and touches that fulfilled them, there was still so much that needed to be said. Draco longed to ask even as he was scared to: where did they stand? What did this make them now? What were they to one another, and just how deep did it go?
"How could I?" A slight frown creased Harry's brow. When a flutter of wind caught his hair and blew it into his face, he flicked it aside almost angrily. "You never say anything. You've never done anything, either."
Not that she appeared to need any help. Draco didn't think he was someone easily cowed, though he'd learnt years ago when it was best to back down and bow his head. When one's life and that of one's family was on the line was usually a good place to start. Draco didn't put the woman across from him quite on par with the likes of the defeated Dark Lord or his own deranged aunt, but it came surprisingly closer than he would have anticipated.
"Are you kidding? I look gorgeous all glammed up, and didn't even have to do the legwork myself. I'm never washing my face again."
Another approached, and Draco didn't even bother glancing his way. The man, whoever he was, didn't stick around for long but scowled and slouched off with a glare flung towards Draco that Draco only saw from his periphery. What did he care if a Muggle got offended by his disregard?
Except that it wasn't. In spite of its isolation, its predominance of witches and wizards, and the head of the company being a renowned with herself, magic didn't permeate every room and fizzle through the walls like an air conditioning system. There were no folded, magically animated notes flapping about as flooded the British Ministry of Magic, no snaps and crackles of spells, no appearing or disappearing employees as they disregarded the elevator system and Apparated instead.
"If I wind down these windows, the entirety of London is going to hear how shit you are at singing," Harry all but shouted to Jackie.
Or it would have been interesting if he'd been able to actually read the textbooks he and Jackie had borrowed from the city library earlier that week. Even better if his partners helped him in his studies.
Draco snorted. "She says that, but she knows neither Blaise nor I will actually abide by her restrictions. Besides," he swept a hand through his hair with a sigh, "I just wanted to talk to her for a minute or two. About the posters."
"I'm passionate about that. I've realised that much after really thinking about it. It's what I want to do, and I have people I care about who are being impacted, so…"
"What do you want me to say?" Harry said, absently grazing his hand through his hair. He settled his tumbler down upon the table alongside Ron's glass. "We were kids back then, Ron. And no, just because there's history between us doesn't mean I'm obligated to hate him."
Harry glanced between them at their snapped exchange. It was somehow just a little fascinating. He'd never considered that they could share such companionability despite their friendship, even if it was underscored with teasing and jabs. It made sense given they were friends, but…
"Not just mine," Harry said, though it wasn't entirely true. Von had been culling other jobs and offers increasingly over the years. He was in Harry's company exclusively these days, and spent most of his time with Harry himself. "But even if he wasn't, I think he's too competitive not to care."
Life, Harry had found, was far easier, far less objectionable, and far more peaceful when he simply let things happen. Rather than chaffing at the bit, it was easier just to stop fighting entirely.
The fact that Jackie had taken herself down to the locker rooms at all was surprising. Worth questioning, even, though Harry wouldn't ask. Not because they were in the middle of what should have been a hushed library and Jackie wasn't the sort of person to keep her voice down, but because she would tell him if she wanted to. She always did.
"To be fair, Hermione, I doubt anyone's really going to tell Harry-bloody-Potter he needs to learn more about Defence Against the Dark Arts."
"Harry, we agreed on this. You won't be able to use your phone with the magical interferences so that means you have to send owls."
Harry folded half a piece of toast into his mouth, skirting the table once more to where he'd discarded his school bag the previous afternoon. "Ah, yeah. That."
"Or not. As it happens, I don't remember anything about the night I, uh, lost my parents. Or anything from before that, for that matter."
"Why don't you blame them for what was done to you? You were only a child. Don't you feel any resentment whatsoever?" Draco clicked his tongue sharply. "Hell, if you did, half of London would rise spitting and screaming to your defence and likely start a manhunt for –"
Harry had almost punched him. Almost, and only hadn't because it would ruin Draco's perfect nose and, in spite of being an arse, he was nice to look at. His hands had balled into fists regardless, however, and he felt a different kind of heat well within him.
Edging around the room, using it as a crutch to keep himself upright and growing only slightly more confident with every step, Harry crept towards the door. Or he tried to creep; the scuffing of his socked feet seemed far too loud to his ears. He was sure that, however far away Bellatrix was, she must certainly hear it. Between that and his thundering heartbeat, it felt certain that she would hear his every move.
He missed school, though he didn't know why that thought occurred to him. He missed the sunlight, though he couldn't have said exactly how many days it had been since he'd last seen it. The comfort of his bedroom, the familiarity of his kitchen, the cosy dinners with his family that he'd taken for granted when he'd had them but now felt like the greatest gift in the world.
"I don't know if I've changed my tune more or something, but it really doesn't bother me who you date, and I mean it." He settled back in his chair, straight again, and rocked on the back legs slightly. "A boy or girl, even my sister, it doesn't bother me. Definitely not the boy thing. You remember when Seamus and Dean properly hooked up, right?"
"Oi, hold on a second," he said, sitting forward with elbows on his knees once more. "This guy. You talk to him, right?"
The best looking – which Pansy had once agreed with in awe and then with increasing derision – and the smartest. The best, most reputable at school, too, which he'd managed with the exception of a single infuriating Muggleborn that planted herself firmly in his way.
No one could question the sincerity of Jill's words. It simply wasn't possible. Even knowing her and that she disliked her long-time bullies as much as Harry did, he was convinced she meant it. Jill had an impossible disposition of compassion that seemed to extend even towards her enemies. It was unwavering and always had been.
Maybe that was simply because he found his own just yet? Or at least not one that he let himself acknowledge.
Harry had folded his lips after that, and not because a retort didn't rise onto his tongue. Jackie was simply right, and he didn't particularly want to acknowledge that fact. Approaching Draco Malfoy, he was made all too aware of that fact. Again.
Glancing towards her, Harry saw that both she and Pansy had disregarded whatever exchange they'd been having. They were surprisingly similar in their sharp-eyed stares. Surprisingly critical too despite that Jackie held a book on executions with a rather gruesome depiction of a beheading on the page and Pansy her hand aloft and fingers curled to dry.
"I take it back," Sirius had said when Harry admitted to his visit with Draco. "James, I agree with you; the Malfoy kid's a right little fucker for taking Harry before we could."
That smile, knowing and speaking a thousand silent words, widened further. "You're not nearly as oblivious as many of the gossip magazines would have the world believe."
From what Draco had seen, from the tight expression on Harry's face and the equally tight squeeze he'd given his phone before stuffing it away, hadn't he been…?
"It's no bother," Malfoy said, waving a hand in a grandiose manner that was so unexpectedly reminiscent of the stuffy pureblood Harry had known him as most of his life that he almost laughed. "It wouldn't be the first time."
Harry huffed. He settled back against the table, propping his hands on the edge. There wasn't much distance between him and Draco, only enough that their knees weren't quite touching, but he was more aware of it in that moment than he'd been in months. "Of course I bloody well am. But I'm not an asshole. You clearly don't want to talk about it."
Was it even an exchange program? What did it involve, exactly? And it was just the C&C class… right? Mrs. Joyce had been somewhat vague on the subject when she'd mentioned it all of once nearly three weeks ago.
Draco was equally ashen. Gone was the boy Harry had kissed and held but minutes before and in his place was nothing if not the terrified, confused teenager that Harry felt like himself. "You're… you mean you're…?"
"Which is more evidence that you know jack-shit." Ginny grinned as Ron subsided into grumbles, picking once more at his dinner. Then she glanced at Harry. "Besides, we know that Harry can be distracted from being obsessed with Malfoy. If there's something more interesting, for example. Like when he thought he was actually into me and we started dating –"
"You're incredible," Harry managed when he could bring himself to come up for air again. He couldn't pull away far, couldn't bring himself to let go of where his arms had made their way around Draco's neck to hold him as close as possible. It didn't matter that Draco held him back just as tightly; Harry wasn't inclined to loosen his hold even a little.
"You kind of are," Harry mumbled, shrinking beneath Sirius' arm. He couldn't pinpoint what part of the confrontation was the worst bit – the staring, the gaping, the demands – but decided he wished he'd somehow delayed what was, ultimately, an inevitable reveal. "I haven't even told Jackie or Jill yet."
Draco didn't care about Harry and Harry didn't care about him. Or that was how it was supposed to be. Draco didn't let himself wonder why that thought felt like a lie itself.
Harry's own smile widened, the dimple appearing in his cheek. "You and me both. But I'd like to think I know what I'm talking about and keep up to date with the news when I seem to be in it so often."
Harry flapped a hand at him. "Whatever. Anyway, he was a Slytherin, so now everyone since he was around who is in Slytherin too has a black mark against their name?"
Such scolding slipped from his thoughts in an instant, however, and Draco barely saw Picard at all as she was followed into the room by a pair of men. One – tall, broad, with a perfectly bald head and so well-dressed that he must have spent hours in the sole company of his wardrobe that morning – Draco discarded almost immediately. He wasn't important. What was important was Potter.
Harry started at her, then glanced at Ron. In the relative quietness of the corridor, removed from students and staff but for the distant murmur of voices, both Hogwarts students seemed suddenly uncomfortable. "This is a whole-school tradition you've got going or something? Calling it that?"
"Accident –?" Harry cut himself off. "Well, I suppose. It could be construed as an accident that I started doing it, but the practising was pretty deliberate on my part."
Draco snapped almost before he'd pulled his wand from his pocket, and he was all but running after the little firefly of red light that appeared to seek as he per his mental request. Running, clutching his jostling camera like a lifeline and hating himself just a little, he swiping aside the curtain the globe disappeared through.
Draco peeled his eyes open. A trembling mixture of emotions flickered across his face before he managed to smooth it all into a mask that wasn't quite complete. "I do," he said. "Because I… I care about you."
It was bad. Draco knew he had it bad. Pansy didn't even tease him for it as she more than likely sorely longed to, so it must have appeared as utterly pathetic as it felt. And Draco couldn't do anything about it. He hadn't even seen Harry since that last day, that last shoot, let alone spoken to him. For all Draco knew, Harry wanted nothing more to do with him. It didn't necessarily fit the person that Draco understood Harry had become, but maybe… just maybe…
"Alright, you're done," he called to the model. Flicking a hand in the direction of the crew waiting attentively around him, he gestured for cessation of the shoot. As one, managers, dressers, and dismantlers flooded forwards to disassemble and cluster around the model like pigeons flocking to a pile of breadcrumbs.
Draco glanced sidelong at the man planted in the doorway that he'd mistaken in his periphery for Von. He looked – and he froze.
When Draco spoke, the gratitude carried a distinct weight that Harry didn't hear from many people. He wondered if that was part of being a pureblood – or from an old family or being a wizard – too. He was smiling before he could help himself, fighting the urge to hold the two-way mirror just a little bit closer, and made the deliberate attempt to change the subject.
"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. But, if it was something magical, it certainly wasn't intentional."
Three words. Three syllables. So simple and yet so weighted with meaning. A part of Harry had been swept aloft in weightless, wonderful delight; Draco wanted him, and that Harry felt that want in return wasn't a secret he bothered hiding to himself anymore. But the other part of him, the bigger part, had shrivelled in unexpected disappointment.
Draco's lips thinned, his jaw bunching as he clenched his teeth. "Not necessarily. They're the people I grew up with. But there's a certain stigma attached to Slytherin due to an unfortunate history, and that stigma still clings to everyone who is assigned to that house."
"How did your study go today?" Jill asked, turning from Hermione and Ron's wre 'ooh'ing and 'aah'ing.
The girl didn't wait for him to finish before leaping into another string of words. It was only when Harry glanced to their side in a half-hearted plea for rescue that she was interrupted. A woman, dressed down as either a manager or member of the crew typically was, appeared at the girl's side and cut her off with a word and pointed direction. In an instant, startling slightly beneath the woman's suggestion, the girl uttered a hasty apology – Harry could understand that word at least – and trotted away in her too-high shoes. Harry was left staring after her, shaking his head slightly. It wasn't as though he hadn't encountered such enthusiasm before, but here? In Switzerland, when he wasn't even working?
He hadn't realised quite how much that punishment would sting. Ignorance… It was a blow that Draco hadn't appreciated the strength of before it was inflicted.
Harry switched his attention between each of the portraits as they jumped back and forth, criss-crossing and recalling. History. Legends. That was what they were going on about? And that was supposed to help somehow?
Harry barely heard him. "That's why you all kind of cling to each other like you're holding each other afloat?"
A breath of even more familiarity, the hold recognised and remembered but seen in a different light.
He hadn't intended to use the powder in his pocket for a distraction against bullies. Truth be told, he hadn't even remembered putting it in there, had only considered doing so days before, and definitely not to use it as he did. For a show, maybe, but for Draco, not a bunch of thick-skulled arseholes with a vendetta against him. It was luck more than anything that he hadn't had a chance to use it that day. Luck, or maybe fate. He certainly hadn't planned a trick with the glittery dust that day.
"When you say you felt like she was a danger to you even when the door was closed," Emmeline began at one moment, but Harry didn't hear the res. He was drawn back to the feeling of being in the dark room, of Bellatrix railing just outside the door, thuds of heavy objects crashing against walls and sometimes the door itself, and the memory of pleading that would diffuse before she next came into the room.
"We'll certainly need it," Dot said, a hint of resignation to her tone, but Harry didn't miss the touch of a smile that shadowed across her lips just before he closed the door behind him.
"No," he said. "You're not like them at all." Raising his gaze, Harry caught and held Draco's, stare for stare, as Draco finally lowered his fist from his forehead. His resignation seemed to have banished any ability to hold tension in his expression. That mask crumbled away piece by piece, a feeble attempt that hadn't really a hope of being maintained in the first place.
"I can't believe you're pinning this on me!" Harry exclaimed. Then he dissolved into laughter and, if it was louder than the situation warranted, he didn't really care.
Harry couldn't help but smile properly this time, warmth unfurling in his chest. Ron was really saying all the right things that night. Harry would never have expected it of him.
Sagging slightly, Harry raised a hand to his head. It shook, he noted, and couldn't for the life of him think why. The thought was fleeting, however, and far less important than what stood before him.
"Come on, then," Ginny said, and in a motion that was far less familiar than Hermione's arm-link, locked her own through Harry's to fit elbow into elbow. "Let's see your world, Harry."
He felt of him – so warm, thin and lean, but more than strong enough that his caging arms seemed a barrier from any rearing horror chasing Harry's thoughts.
PJ all but shoved Harry out of his path as he scampered through the front door. Despite being nearly ten years old, he had all of the enthusiasm of a puppy. Harry's uncle Sirius said it was because he was a mutt. Sirius always looked so happy when he said that.
Even as he said it, Harry didn't think it meant quite what it used to. Spinning the flower between his own fingers, Harry thought Malfoy probably thought as much too. For whatever reason, despite the darkness painting the walls, when Malfoy took Harry's hand, the room felt just a little brighter.
Harry hadn't predicted he would become a model. He hadn't foreseen Ron to take to IT with a fervour and passion that rivalled his father's father's love of anything Muggle. He might have suspected that Hermione would become an activist, but that she would be leading a feminist wave as an out-and-proud lesbian? Certainly not.
He'd never done that with Ginny, either. It would have felt strange, and though Ginny wasn't a long sight smaller than himself, thinking of it… No, it didn't seem right. He was fairly sure he could crush her. Malfoy wasn't really much bigger than him or anything; taller, yes, which had been a source of disgruntlement for Harry when he'd realised it for the first time, but not really all that much bigger. So why…?
Draco had his chin raised, shoulders set, and his chilling gaze narrowed. "Pray tell," he said slowly, so coldly that he seemed almost to be breathing frost, "just what do you think you're talking about?"
Draco didn't speak in reply. Harry didn't really expect him to. Instead, he simply held Harry's gaze and somehow, even without words, Harry thought he could heard an answer. An answer of the kind that twisted his gut and inhaled a balloon in his chest, making it more than a little hard to breathe.
"Apparating? You mean like -? That's the teleporting thing, right? So all of you seniors do that every Wednesday when you come to Potting Point?"
Striding towards him, Bellatrix planted herself over him. Her hands hung loosely at her sides, empty of anything – empty of a
That same flush of chilling not-quite anger cascaded through Harry when he'd seen Draco being beaten to a pulp. When he'd caught sight of the witch and wizard tearing him bloody not with their wands but with their fists, like primal beasts thirsting for the scent and the taste of blood. Harry hadn't used an aggressive or even defensive spell for a long time, but magic rose at his beck and call instantly and leapt forth.
Harry didn't know. He understood next to nothing about magic, and he was beginning to think he knew even less than he'd assumed, less than he'd considered Draco's lessons had taught him. Magic didn't have laws like science. It didn't follow known rules, because it was magic. It was the very definition of impossible.
Wandering up the aisle towards the Little Head Table, as he'd had heard it called by some of the younger students, Harry waved absently to the Gryffindor table where Ginny sat. She caught his eye with a smile and waved back, though was distracted almost instantly by the girl at her side who drew her back into their conversation.
The modelling industry could be brutal, and not just for photographers, though Draco had experienced more than his fair share of back-breaking hours, time spent editing and stylising shots that was ultimately rejected, and overall dissatisfaction when he couldn't achieve what he wanted just right.
"I'm not good at this," Harry said quietly. "At any kind of dating, for that matter, even if I have done it before. This is – different. For me. I don't really know how it's supposed to work, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do, or say, or think. So you're going to have to throw me a bone a little bit, okay."
"I should probably take PJ for a walk this afternoon," Harry reminded himself aloud. "What kind of an arsehole big brother am I that I don't even wish my dog goodbye in the morning?"
Harry stared at him, then glanced towards Hermione, frowning at Ron's side. They'd paused at the edge of the Entrance Hall, alongside the door to wait for the professors to give them their go-ahead to leave for the carriages, and Harry hadn't even noticed.
"Since when have you been all buddy-buddy with Mal – Draco?" Ron asked, correcting himself at the last moment to Hermione's slight nod of approval.
His chest seized, squeezing and convulsing, even as his hand released its grip on his wand. He was only distantly aware of the sound of it clattering to the ground at his side. Of greater importance was the thundering of his heartbeat in his ears, his tightened throat, the fading blurriness of vision reminiscent of seeing without his glasses but darker, darkening, juxtaposing sharp flares of too bright and too fuzzy.
Harry's smile widened a little, though he didn't raise his gaze. "Maybe not. But there's a whole lot of wall space, and I'm happy to learn."
Yet somehow, Draco hadn't expected Harry to be as up-to-date with the politics behind the scenes of photography and magazine management. Not in the least, and definitely not after how little interest in studying he'd had in school. It was surprising, yet oddly satisfying, and Draco couldn't help but smile a little as he watched Harry gesturing with a sweeping grace he definitely hadn't had in school, in full possession of Clementine's attention.
Blaise rolled his eyes at her reminder. "You're such a killjoy," he said, and ducked out of the way as Pansy swatted at him in reply.
"So," he said, brushing off the thought. "Group work. Collaboration. Because everyone knows that working in groups is the best idea any teacher has ever come up with."
"Harry," he said, nodding his head shortly. It was more formal than he'd treated Harry all year, even if he did still use his proper name.
"He's from a different house to me," Harry continued, barely hearing her, "and everyone expects us to stay as far away from each other as possible. Which we do. Sort of. Because that's what we always try to do, always have done, and it would be weird if we didn't."
With a sigh, Draco allowed his crossed arms to unfold. He snatched up his glass and held it aloft in a gesture to the waiter. "If I'm going to do this for you so you don't have to fish through any more inadequate fools, then you owe me at least another drink."
He watched, chewing on the inside of his lip, as Draco strode down the hallway towards the room Pansy had disappeared into. Draco had seemed to recover from his bout of melancholy since they'd left Diagon Alley, had very deliberately swept the subject aside, but maybe it worried him more than he'd let on. Was he saddened by what he'd seen? Angry? He hadn't appeared to hold any affection for the woman Bellatrix Lestrange, but maybe Harry was wrong. Maybe he'd misinterpreted and Draco was actually rattled.
Draco took himself back to Harry's side. Even so close, it was nearly impossible to believe that Harry was with him. They'd shared a portkey, and Draco had stood alongside Harry as he'd called his agent Picard from Bern in a belated explanation of his abrupt trip to Switzerland. He'd met Harry's stare when he'd ended the call, and Harry had smiled a little tentatively with an almost questioning "I guess I'm free to go now."
Harry glared at his father before dropping his gaze back to his barely-touched dinner. "We're so not ready for that yet, so screw you."
Harry missed Sirius and Remus. He missed his friends, missed Jackie's loud confidence and Jill's calm, quiet reassurances. He missed PJ, too, and couldn't help but think of how warm the dog's fur would be if he was at his side, the comfort as much in his presence as the heat that he would provide.
Harry couldn't really blame her. He supposed he should have told her earlier – should have told both her and Jill – but it had never quite felt like the right time. How did anyone tell their friends that they've started dating someone who they'd all initially considered to be a bit of a tosser only a handful of months ago?
Draco shifted beneath him. Harry suspected he reached for his nightstand, then was sure of it when the faint glow of a
It was nice. In many ways, Harry kind of liked the break from the Wizarding world. Maybe it was a Swiss thing, or maybe it was an industry thing; though not quite to the same degree, he'd noticed that many of the companies he worked for in the past didn't integrate magic into their daily routines quite as much as others. It was an aspect of the modelling and photography world that he hadn't known or anticipated but certainly appreciated.
"I think you need to revise your understanding of what 'a beard' means," he said. Then he pointed his magazine at Ron. "You should stop supporting them. Shouldn't you be happy that I never actually shagged your sister?"
Like Hogwarts that would surely have required rebuilding of its own for the damage that had been inflicted upon it.
"Of course." Draco shrugged as though it were only to be expected. "I suppose you could see this as confirmation of my suspicions."
Jackie practically hissed, rising from her seat, and only stopped when Pansy darted a hand out to stop her. A languid smile spread across her lips. "Fortunately for you, my opinion never needs to be requested."
"Yes, but a predator taking offence that an ex-Death Eater is working so closely with the beloved Saviour," Draco grumbled. Seething, he hunched into he seat. His mind was awhirl, and not because Pansy spoke fallacies. She was right. This job would open doors for him.
Harry turned his face slightly to peer up at Draco's. He still couldn't see it, but it didn't feel like it mattered. "What do you mean?"
Harry didn't know what direction the voice had come from, so he didn't bother replying. Closing his eyes briefly, squeezing them shut as his head pounded like a drum for reasons he couldn't quite pinpoint, he took a moment to stand and gather his bearings. Was he still holding his cup? He thought he was. Yes, that was definitely a cup still in his hand. That was good. For some reason, Harry decided that was a very, very good thing.
? Draco had encountered such behaviour before, such a need for validation from the subjects of his shots. It was a little pathetic, in his opinion, and not only because it spoke of deep underlying insecurities. They always knew, at least a little, that their query was only in search of confirmation. For whatever reason, Harry sounded different again.
"How long as what been going on for?" Harry asked, though he already knew entirely too well what Draco referred to.
It was only then, in the ringing aftermath of McGonagall's words, that Harry actually turned to Draco and Pansy once more. They'd edged closer together, gazes still wary, to mutter to one another in a nearly inaudible exchange. When Harry glanced their way, Draco's lips returned to silenced thinness and Pansy her to her wide-eyed staring.
Ipetsky appeared nothing if not amused by her words. He glanced at Harry, lips twitching and eyes brightening. "I'm really not allowed to stick around?"
"Or to being treated like an honoured guest," Gertrude said, nodding knowingly. Her smile shifted distinctly in a way that Harry couldn't quite pinpoint the meaning of, and when she leant forwards in her seat, her intensity felt just a little different to what Harry was used to too. No flamboyance. No flirtatiousness. No effort to appear open and friendly. If anything, the gesture seemed somehow…
Even so, Harry couldn't just let the subject lie. If the bullying he'd endured his entire life had taught him anything it was that he shouldn't take shit without a fight. Taking another sip of his shake, Harry shrugged with forced nonchalance. "Just that you seem to think you're above this sort of thing because you're upper class and all that."
Flickering his gaze up briefly, Harry saw Draco's lips thin. "A couple of years being since he first started shooting you."
With a flick of his wrist, Harry set to spinning his pen between his fingers in a flying pattern that Draco had once called magic. It wasn't, merely took practice and dexterity, but Harry made a point of performing whenever he had the chance.
It was a sign of Lily's understanding and gentle consideration that she didn't pull him up on his muttered resentment. If anything, her frown and the audible kick under the table was reserved for James.
Harry glanced towards Draco. He was staring intently at the rose in Harry's hands. Harry frowned. Conjured? A wand? He really was going all out.
They continued their conversation as Draco rose to standing, as casual as acquaintances could be and sounding more like friends than ex-schoolyard rivals. Draco shook his head slightly again. He knew it was all Harry's fault. Or not quite fault, but something else. Whether he made nice to make a point as his last interview suggested he was doing or because that was simply the person he was, had become, had maybe even been forced into being, Draco didn't know. But just as he did with Draco, Harry made a distinct gesture of friendliness when it came to Pansy.
"I don't," Harry said easily, and he didn't really. He knew that, regardless of how much his friends loved him, they were still and likely always would be a little derisive of his career. Many people who hadn't any direct experience with the world of modelling looked down their noses, even as they admired the finished piece. Glamour, glory, and pampering was the general consensus when most considered the life of a model. Harry was never quite able to break it to them properly that the reality was quite different.
"Oh. Well, yeah, Antarctica was pretty different. We went for a trip around the Peninsular, and it definitely pays to be a wizard 'cause there would have been so much we would have missed if we hadn't Apparated."
Just like that. All at once, just like that, everything within Draco seemed to freeze. The air that swept around them, running fingers through Draco's hair, was chilling. The scent of the lake was sharp and crisp, the shuffle of trees further up the shoreline rising in oblivious whispers. But Draco barely noticed any of it. He had attention only enough for Harry's stare as it swung back towards him and the words that still rested upon his parted lips.
The cot rocked wildly with her collision. Harry was in her arms as Lily staggered to her knees. He was waking, stirring, gurgling and then grizzling as she clutched him and all of his swaddling to her chest, spinning towards the black-robed man. The man who straightened, turning towards her. The pale hand, the pale wand, the cowl and the black draping that hid almost every inch of him…
"You're a one-woman team all by yourself, Jackie. You're more than capable of handling potentially crazy people, even if you're outnumbered."
"I think that's a little extreme, don't you?" Hermione said, wriggling into her seat until Harry withdrew his feet just slightly. "You're allowed out, aren't you?"
Paired eyes narrowed as they drew to a stop beside them. "We don't get a say on the subject of where we sit?" Pansy asked, nostrils flaring slightly.
. Harry nearly snorted. How much things had changed indeed, that he could contemplate such a thing as casually as the urge to recross his legs.
"No," Harry denied him simply. "I have. I've just taken revenge and learnt that it doesn't really help all that much. It's better to just move past it. What better way to spit in the face of your past abusers than to forget them and what they did entirely?"
"Then date me." Draco had smirked with confidence that was more than a touch arrogant, and Harry had abruptly decided that, prat or not, he might just adore that smirk. "That's what two people do when they're interested in one another, do they not?"
The dark room was something of a retreat for him. He'd all but stumbled upon it by chance in the early days of his apprenticeship under Dimitri in what had been a curious peek yet deteriorated into both a thorough explanation and a guided tour. At the time, when Draco was still uncertain of involving himself too greatly in Muggle technology, let alone Muggle chemicals, he'd peered into the room flooded with its ruddy light uneasily.
Harry ignored her. It was relatively easy to manage; he'd become adept at feigned distraction over the years. Jackie's theatrics demanded it if he wanted to remain sane. Flipping through the menu spread open before him, he scanned the selection on offer.
At Harry's nod, he shrugged. "Why the bloody hell wouldn't I be happy for them? Why would I be as much so much of a tosser as to have the shits with them for deciding to date another bloke when it doesn't have anything to do with me? It's not like it really changes all that much, right? I mean, they were always hanging out anyway; now they just kiss every now and then, or sometimes they'll share the same bed at night. As long as I don't hear anything, why should I care?"
"That would be because the nature of the Death Eater's escape was unknown until only recently. Lestrange's means of escape is still in the process of being discerned –"
The Dragon's Nest was an old building refurbished for the short, express purpose of housing the returning eighteen-year-olds whose final year of education had been crushed by the weight of Voldemort's war. Surprisingly – or perhaps not surprisingly at all – there were only a handful of students in Harry's year who didn't return. When the feast in the Great Hall drew to a close, when the eighth years wandered in a slow but constant stream towards their new dormitories, he saw the familiar faces of many that he almost expected never to see again.
purchase the wand that Draco had offered to outfit him with what felt like so long ago was unnerving, though more because Harry's entire family, uncles included, saw it as an opportunity to educate him on a part of the Wizarding world he'd already seen.
with every inhalation, and his mind filled with the sensation of Draco's hardness easing into him. Strange, unfamiliar, a little uncomfortable and a little of what wasn't quite painfulness – but not bad. Not as he'd feared. Not as he didn't allow himself to admit he'd worried.
"After seeing it enough times, you sort of get used to it." Harry's tone became a little rueful. "It becomes almost easy to pick up on sometimes. A lot of people only want one thing. Not all of them, but the way even those people stare? It's the same."
Ron laughed, leading her through the arched entrance, but Harry barely heard that either. Ducking away from his friends unnoticed, he slipped through the thin stream of students, shared a brief smile with Wayne, brushed by Su's shoulder, and picked up his pace as the majority of them fell away to leave only a handful interspersed in its wake.
Harry sniffed again before raising a hand to press his thumb and forefinger into his eyes. "Sorry you had to see that."
Draco's jaw worked for a moment. His frown deepened even further. When he spoke, he sounded somehow urgent. "You can't do magic," he said. "Muggles can't. It's not possible, and you, who you are, and the fact that you go to this school, means that you shouldn't be able to do it."
Finally, with a struggle, Draco tore his gaze from the image on the wall towards Dimitri. Even in the face of the bearded man's small smile, his curiosity and blatant approval, the image of the model – of Potter – swum before his eyes. Draco didn't even truly care that his composure had slipped. He nodded shortly, hummed his affirmation, before turning back to the wall.
Snorting at himself and his foolishness, Draco tipped his forehead lightly against Harry's. "I like you," he found himself murmuring, so inadequate and yet so perfectly truthful that Draco could almost feel the memory of his childhood antagonism and his resentment shriek in distress. It was made no less starkly jarring by having already admitted to his feelings the day before.
In the nightclubs, too. At the bars when a hand drifted down his back, or a figure appeared at his side, their stare visibly heated and shining with want even in the darkness of the club. Those people hadn't been drawn to Harry by his name. They hadn't been attracted by his fame, or his money, or the prospect of dating a model and what for some reason seemed to be a fetish for some people. The pursuit of an unfulfillable ideal.
With the barest touch, Harry brushed his arm alongside Draco's. It wasn't much, just the graze of their arms, barely felt through the thick material of their jackets, but it would have to do.
Extending a hand, his fingers curled almost like claws, Draco offered. He wouldn't grab Harry's hand, wouldn't snatch and demand, but he would ask. He'd ask, and if Harry would reply favourably, he'd take it this time.
"I think he wouldn't care if you used shots of him," she said slowly, "but if it bothers you, then tell him. Show them to him."
"Or with those birds, or how you said your phone miraculously worked when it was 'broken', or when you forgot your umbrella and –"
Turning, Harry smiled at Hermione's abrupt appearance at his shoulder. Her cheeks were still a little red from where she'd scrubbed them herself in the bathroom rather than using the products that the makeup artists were more than willing to offer her.
At his words, Von did just that. Hooking his arm around Harry's shoulders in a one-armed embrace that was more directional than affectionate, he steered them from the studio. It wasn't necessarily typical for stylists to be so hands-on at the scene, but Von was different. He wouldn't allow anyone else to touch his work, and that work extended to his models in their entirety. Or model, as it was, given that he didn't really work on anyone but Harry these days.
Harry blinked, startled, and almost missed the sidelong glare Hermione briefly shot his way. "What?"
"Not to sound like a prat, he says," Von said, shaking his head again. "Bub, I don't think I've ever actually heard you sound like a prat."
Draco all but glared at Harry for a moment before closing his eyes. He butted his fist against his forehead, not hard enough that Harry felt the urge to stop him but enough that it seemed to be with intent. Slow, deliberate knocks, measured and focused. It was about the only steady part of Draco at that moment.
A round of poker erupted, and galleons were produced from pockets. More beer, more whiskey, and more wine – unexpectedly the courtesy of Daphne Greengrass rather than Zabini this time – was offered, and bottles emptied so fast it was almost as though they were drained by magic. Someone – probably an ex-Hufflepuff if Harry clung to the stereotypes – conjured a table and bowls of chocolate, sweets, and fruity punch appeared out of nowhere.
The lines of muscle in his back were loose but still dense, distinct enough that Harry's fingers had something to cling to.
Because that was Ron's passion. It was what drove him. He'd found it, just as Ginny had found hers in quidditch, whether playing or teaching her juniors. Just as Hermione found her passion in her activism, standing up for her stalwart beliefs even in the face of her parents' denials.
"I'd actually rather you didn't imagine me in the sack with anyone, to be honest," Harry said, more to himself than to Ron.
That was it. The briefest question, the barest consideration, and the last of Harry's walls crumbled. It was safe in his home, in his room, and he had everything he wanted at that moment right before him.
"I've always found to be, yes," Pansy replied, flashing a smirk over her shoulder. "This is the difference between the good and the best in the industry."
It was as though Draco stood apart from his supposed helpers that Harry had seen over the past weeks didn't help all that much at all. As apart from them as Harry knew he'd become from his friends, made all the more apparent for their continued antics as Ginny jabbed at Ron, Ron swatted her out of the way, and Hermione looped an arm around Ginny's waist as though to restrain her from her attack, though the looseness of her grasp suggested the deliberate ineffectiveness of such a gesture.
Which it would be. Harry would make sure of it. The war was over, but there were still battles to be fought, and people like the Slytherins? Like Malfoy, his gaze lowered to the floor before him, Parkinson, her pug-nosed face for once tucked in an unending flinch, and Zabini, usually so swaggering and confident yet now walking with as much solemnity as his old housemates – they still fought. They were still fighting every day, even if the eighth years that walked around them didn't so much as clutch their wands in wariness.
Harry's eyes flicked from Draco's quill to his face. It hadn't shifted, hadn't risen, yet the corner of Draco's eye was visibly trained upon him. Harry felt his heartbeat give an anxious quiver, and his arms tightened over his chest just a little.
The offer was tempting. As much as Harry felt a flicker of guilt for abandoning Jackie and Jill, the chance to see the Wizarding world, Draco's world, that he'd only been told about, was too great an opportunity to pass up. Just as great a temptation, to spend the afternoon just in Draco's company was…
Harry had known it would be. Their Defence class, the last class of the day, had been a practical lesson. They were few and far between that year, and Harry might have even put it down to blessed luck if Ron hadn't spoken otherwise.
Ron had a long list that he often ran through in Harry's defense. It had become almost funny, and most of the time Ginny mouthed his words in perfect synchrony behind him.
Keeping his smile fixed, Harry lowered his gaze to his wine, swirling it idly. "I don't know. I think Dot's planning on turning away most offers for a while. We're expecting outcry about something or other, or hyper-focus – which wouldn't be the first time and is far from pleasant."
They'd come this far. A magical school and a magical boyfriend? It was everything Harry hadn't known he wanted, and he'd be damned if he would give it up.
The city was a riot of crowded roads and crowded footpaths. Of beeping horns, the puttering of engines, the shouts of pedestrians and the laughter of a clutch of school children idling around a bus stop. The street in the centre of London, diverging into a network of branching roads, was the hub of the city. It was vibrant and loud and, compared to so many vastly different cities and quaint little townships that Harry had encountered in the past months, it was almost a shock. A fondly exasperating shock.
He was still watching as she and her horde drew into the arms of the gate and stared up at the school. A few of the kids glanced towards Harry, and Harry stared unabashedly back at them. No, definitely no recognition, which was unlikely of city residents his age. Even the kids from the other two high schools in the city were all familiar faces. It was only when the woman turned towards him that he was able to drag his attention from them.
"Yeah. You can't be too careful. We'd move every day or so, and more frequently if we had to. It felt a bit like a game of cat and mouse, except that we couldn't even see the cat."
There was a trio of ex-Ravenclaws at the desks three down from Harry and his friends, heads bowed but with only one of them seemingly still working. The other two looked on the verge of sleep. Alongside the bookshelves, Hannah was tucked into the cushioned couch with her knees drawn up before her and a book propped against her thighs. She looked ready to fall to sleep, too. As he watched, Neville, sitting in the couch beside her, leaned over the arm of his own chair and murmured something that had them both smiling sleepily. Other than that, there was only…
Harry didn't protest when Draco grasped his shoulder in a grip he struggled to keep gentle. He did nothing more than blink his acceptance as Draco dragged them into a narrow tube of their own Apparition. When Draco thought about it, he didn't think Harry even knew how to say no.
Jackie waved her book at her. "Don't worry, it's not real magic. Just the kind of tricks that Harry used to do, except that this guy does it as a job."
"It's a school for prats," Jackie said, her words little more than a grunt. "Sounds like you'll fit right in."
A touch of renewed warmth rose in Harry's cheeks, and he switched his glance towards Parkinson across from him, to Zabini at his other side. Zabini gave a small smirk. "Don't worry," he said. "We already knew about it."
"Yeah, I know that, too." Harry flipped open his book. "But most people don't have a hermit for a boyfriend who would probably starve to death if he wasn't either dragged from his study hole or hand-delivered food."
That they drew towards one another, chest to chest, hip to hip, legs intertwining, felt so utterly natural. Draco lost himself in Harry's warmth, in the brief hint of coldness from his toes, in the way he felt, and smelt, and tasted. When Harry drew away from him slightly – just a fraction, his arms still comfortably locked around Draco – even that was worth it for he had the chance to look at him, to trace the contours of his face absent of the smears of makeup and editing.
Madame Clementine's studios were a photographer's dream. Not only were there so many to choose from that Draco doubted anyone could cry that they couldn't find one to fit their personal taste, but they were stuffed with equipment and polished gear, with technology, and lighting, and standardised cameras of the highest quality and newest make.
"Not really. It was just some schoolkid antics. I'm sure you're familiar with it. My friends and I just having fun. Hagrid too, actually. He's a good guy."
Draco lingered, and it was only because of his continued scanning that he noticed the pair of stumbling drunkards with their arms pretzeled around one another slipping from behind a heavy curtain, revealing a dimly lit hallway beyond. The curtain flopped closed again, seeping into camouflage against the dark wall alongside it, but not before Draco was striding across the club towards it, all but shoving clubbers out of his way as he did.
, he thought idly, watching as a pair of young women latched onto one another, the shorter stretching on her toes to plant a sloppy kiss on the corner of the taller one's mouth.
Startled, Draco glanced over his shoulder to where he hadn't even noticed Harry appear. Harry met his gaze, his face barely a hand's breadth away and chin nearly resting on Draco's shoulder, and smiled slightly.
If she explained further, Harry wasn't sure. Jackie slung an arm around his neck a moment later, tugged him into her side, and was diving into the rapidly segregating students before Jill could utter another word. He spared a glance over his shoulder to find Jill fluttering her fingers after them and Ron and Hermione following their retreat with something like bemusement.
Draco could almost feel Pansy smirking at his side. He pointedly ignored her, just as he ignored the urge to swing a kick at her ankle. "What do you project is the likely duration of this endeavour?" he asked instead.
Harry was only too happy for the company. He wasn't fond of the echoing silence of the house in his parents' absence, and on the days that Jackie or Jill didn't accompany him home, he appreciated the company. Talking to PJ only went so far when he replied solely in wordless huffing and cocking of his head.
He was quite well and truly whipped. It was a good thing, then, that Draco had, for whatever reason, silently accepted their abrupt promotion into boyfriends. The suddenness, the unexpectedness, and the sheer wonder of that fact still left Harry floored sometimes, and never more so than when Draco reached for his hand and clasped it in his own.
Draco scowled. He was in a bad enough mood as it was. The pain of his bruised belly had eased somewhat throughout the day, but a knotted ball of malcontent in his belly had replaced it. Fucking Ipetsky. Fuck him and all of his skills as a photographer. Draco didn't even know the man, but he hated him, and a part of him knew it wasn't solely because of his interpretation of Harry's barely perceivable response.
Sighing, Harry straightened. The sounds of the room around him flooded back into his awareness from where he'd deliberately blocked it out: the chatter of his classmates and the Hogwarts students, the laughter and babble, the scrape of chairs and the echo of Mrs. Joyce's voice as she nattered to McGonagall in her endless prattle. The spread of chairs in little clusters of four, heads bowed over exercise books or disregarding of work entirely in favour of conversation. The studious vigour seemed to have distinctly died from its enthusiasm of an hour before.
Draco hardly noticed. He hadn't any particular interest in the recruiting process, but he'd heard so much about Pansy's work directly from her that he couldn't help but be a little invested. Besides, some of the pictures were truly dismal.
"They'll grab at anything they can get," she said with flat insistence, not a hint of concern evident in her tone despite that Harry knew she felt it. "You need to be careful. There's a frenzy going on, and if you get caught in the middle of it, you could be hurt."
Pansy still had a pug nose. She still held that nose too high in the air, and the way she regarded the crowd around them was at once ridiculous and wonderfully hilarious now that Harry knew where her aloofness came from. Draco might be changing his tune, but Pansy still had a long way to go in becoming comfortable around non-magical people.
For an extended moment, Draco thought that Harry might deny him. That he might continue to cling to his supposed ignorance and deny any such falsehoods on his part. But after that moment, broken only by the distant, indecipherable tune playing overhead and adding an almost soothing ambiance to the bathroom scene, Harry's lips drew to the side and he hitched a shoulder in a shrug.
Draco snapped his eyes open, glancing towards the dressing room. Harry was standing just inside the doorway into the hallway, Von ahead of him and already disappearing. Draco swallowed with difficulty once more, because how could he not? How could he not stare and be just a little enchanted by the Harry that wasn't quite the model he presented himself as before the camera but wasn't the boy of their shared past, either?
What was he doing here? Draco picked at the sticky bar top, scowling to himself. Honestly, what how had he let himself be coaxed into coming to the club? It wasn't because of Pansy's bloody suggestion, even if he was incessantly aware of the weight of it hanging from his shoulder pointing him towards his camera. It wasn't because he was hoping to interrupt the companionable conversation occurring a dozen bodies down the line, because, much as he might want to, Draco knew he wouldn't.
Harry snorted. "Hate to break it to you, Draco, but your prying is sort of the basis for our relationship."
"Would you just fuck off for once?" he muttered, more to himself than to the bird, but he flicked his wand at the latch nonetheless and the owl hopped inside. He'd learnt that it was better to simply accept the rain of mail in the morning than attempt to avoid it – though avoid he'd managed to do of late. It was part of the reason he got up so early. The part that had nothing to do with punctuality for work.
Draco glanced towards the wall of glass. He nodded slowly. "I am. I suppose I'm partial to beautiful things." He glanced down at his camera, finger tapping lightly upon the edge. "Perhaps that makes me superficial."
"We can only hope so," Dot muttered. Shaking her head, she glanced at her note paper. "Honestly… why in God's name do you incessantly feel the need to utilise the skills of Pansy Parkinson?"
"Cheers!" Harry replied, and then he was through the front door. Running, vaulting over the fence, and speeding down the pavement with eager steps, he flew in the direction of his school almost before the door slammed closed behind him.
Lily was seated in the kitchen when Harry entered. She glanced up from the papers she'd spread across the table, a distinctly professional air that always shrouded her when she was working hanging over her, but she smiled as Harry entered.
Harry stared at her. Then he glanced towards Ron again, still shifting between his feet, his gaze switching between Harry and Hermione and lips folded tightly. What was all that about?
That afternoon seemed to be more flooded with excitement than the week prior. Precious little happened in Potting Point, so a visiting boarding school, regardless of how weird or stuck up they were, was cause for curiosity. The previous week seemed to have seen the enthusiasm inhibited for some misguided awkwardness or decorum, but this week was a different story entirely.
"I take it that you've none with potential enough to appeal to you?" Draco asked, gesturing once more to the papers of what was likely resumes.
Draco was torn between concern and satisfaction at the prospect; it was clearly well paying, with a prominent figure in the Wizarding world and likely the Muggle world too, and it would proceed for an extended period. How could he not be satisfied? But then again…
Harry retrieved a glass from the cupboard, filling it from the fridge, and hopped onto the edge of the counter before replying. His feet propped on PJ as he planted himself beneath him with his usual attentiveness. "School is school," he said. "How was work?"
"Ew, study." Ginny pulled a face but was grinning again a split second later. "Theory of Fundamental Transitions, right? I've still got to read that chapter."
In the throes of winter, ice-cream wouldn't have been Harry's first choice, but Diagon Alley appeared to be thickened with more than just a crowd. The warmth of the mall had to be artificially heated, for not even a glimpse of the winter frost touched the scene, despite being outside. With bodies packed and constantly moving, it was almost hot. Definitely warm enough for a neon green ice-cream cone that tasted of a slightly confusing mixture of lime and aniseed. Draco looked particularly petulant when Harry flicked a drop at him. It somehow managed to land on his nose.
That entire morning, the entire night before, the evening in the hotel, Draco struggled to properly believe the reality he'd fallen into. 'Too good to be true' didn't necessarily mean that it wasn't true, did it? He and Harry hadn't discussed just what lay between them, hadn't really had the time, and yet…
Then he walked. He trudged, one foot before the other. He couldn't look up, couldn't raise his gaze, because the world was spinning around him, the edges of his vision darkened and blurred, and he couldn't look away from the ground before his feet, the mess of twigs and leaves, in case it went away. He barely dared to blink.
Harry didn't. Not in the least. He'd replied to Draco's teasing query in the most telling way possible: by planting a kiss upon his lips that he was actually allowed to do.
a niggling concern, it felt good. The kind of good that breaking rules did, even though Harry new there'd been no such breakages.
Remus' stared at him for a beat as though he expected him to call bullshit. When Harry didn't, a slow smile spread across his lips. "This is new for you. What brought it on?"
The fact of that matter was, however, that he would have to endure the moments of shadowed nothingness and waiting that was to come. Draco knew he would have weeks if not months when the interviews were being printed in which hatred for him, for Pansy, would peak. He knew he would have to keep his head down. Regardless of how well those interviews paid, he would be living on next to nothing in that time.
Not that it was Harry's job to regulate it. He had to remind himself of that. Even if he was magical, could do magic, it wasn't his world. Smiling at the cluster of them as they awkwardly shifted between their feet, murmuring vague agreements and thanks, Harry stepped past them into the hall.
"Yes. It's almost funny how long he got away with it when you think about it. You'd think the professors would have noticed."
"Harry too," Jackie said, shooting Harry an exasperated glance. "For someone who apparently prefers sport over school, he does far less actual sporting than he does homework. You're a failure of a jock, Harry."
Harry was so distracted with gazing down at Draco, silently drawing his fingers through his fine hair, that he didn't even notice they were being watched until Pansy shifted a shuffling step. It didn't bother him to be observed as it once would have – he and Draco had borne such study almost constantly in the past week – but he was a little surprised.
"Oh, come now," Pansy said, humming into her glass as she rested it against her lips. "You should know that one can hardly throw a stone in Mayfair without puncturing a hole through the window of a French restaurant. No offence intended," she added with a brief glance at the waiter. He only tipped his head again in response.
Harry watched him. He could only watched, biting his tongue to hold his silence. Rather than feel the urge to take flight even more, however, Draco's agitation was somehow calming. This was more familiar. Harry could handle this. At least it was better than the wall of blank-faced nothingness.
"Just asleep," she chanted, her voice shrill in her ears. "He's just asleep, he's just asleep, he's just –"
Harry didn't glance up from his book. Sliding down further into his seat, he tucked his heel onto the edge and raised the book higher. He skimmed the written words in a committed search for useful titbits of knowledge.
"You could say that," Pansy said with a smirk. "Didn't you have a whole month last year where practically everything you wore was green?"
"Doing my best," Harry said, managing a smile that felt more than a little shy. He couldn't remember the last time he'd been properly bashful. "Bear with me."
"I didn't tell either of them anything," Draco said. "They're just cluey enough to pick up on what is apparently blatantly apparent to anyone I spend time with."
A little while later followed, "Just because I'm good at it doesn't mean I'll just do you a favour for free," Ron said when Ginny requested he take a look at her apparently deceased computer. "It's my job."
He still couldn't believe it. Not really. It felt so impossible, so unbelievable. Draco Malfoy liked him? Actually liked him, and as more than a throw rug to stave off the chill of the library, or a delivery boy to bring him meals when he didn't want to fetch them for himself? More than an annoyance to be tolerated who increasingly crowded his space and used him as a misshapen mattress?
"But you can. Even when it seems like you don't, you have a right to abandon a situation that's hurting you. Take it from one who knows and didn't take the offered hand extended to them."
"Skinny twits can't hold their liquor," he'd said countless times, and not only to Harry. It seemed a common reminder he gifted to models whenever one threatened to invite him out for an evening.
Far from offended, Pansy's smirk widened, and Draco couldn't help but reply in kind. "Did you read the article?" she asked.
It was an itch Harry scratched at until he picked it open. Realisations and revelations, an unprecedented understanding of himself, had bombarded him in the months since the war had so violently ended. The twinging feeling of discomfort as often as horror or confusion wasn't unfamiliar to Harry anymore. What Draco had said, and the possibility it presented, was somehow a combination of the three with something else added on top.
Glancing sidelong, Draco couldn't help but watch as Harry took half a step towards the wall of window on display across the breadth of the room. His eyes were wide behind his glasses, his eyebrows raised and his mouth slightly ajar, and in all honesty, Draco couldn't blame him for his stupefaction. Still, despite the view, he found himself almost as transfixed by Harry and his open wonder as he was what lay beyond the window itself.
"Of course," Pansy said, tipping her head in a nod. "I couldn't have you waiting on my beck and call, Dimitri."
It had felt nice, satisfying, to be competent at something and to make people happy and just a little amazed when so many around Harry turned from his with glares and scrunched noses. Harry was proud of what seemed to come so naturally to him - but he didn't necessarily want to do a project on it. Definitely not when years had firmly welded that door closed.
"If you have a problem with it, go down to the Great Hall and get your food for yourself," Harry had said, shaking the burger pointedly. "Don't make me dump this in your lap. I'm still going to sit there, but it would make it gross."
"I remember you telling us about him," Hermione said, frowning slightly as she stared in the direction Von had disappeared. "He's not what I expected for a bodyguard."
With a deep breath – he was only tempting fate, was only going to make his inevitable departure worse, but he couldn't help himself – Draco clicked his phone to life and called the number that he'd never directly called before. A part of him soared as soon as he pressed the button.
Malfoy raised his gaze towards him, returned to its hooded detachedness. "Sixth year. You weren't quite so appalling."
"Thanks," Harry said, and Von only nodded in acknowledgement of his gratitude. He crossed the small room and, without pause to flick through the articles of clothing, drew a shirt and jeans from the rack just alongside the vanity. He held them towards Harry with an indicative tilt of his head.
Sharp heat. Heady tightness. A coiled tension built in his gut, and the flush of warmth that suffused him seemed to trickle down ever limb, into every extremity. Draco's gasping breathes, the stuttered groans that arose from him every other moment as if unbidden, met Harry's own as they moved faster and easier. Pleasure thrumming through Harry built in the backs of his eyelids, a direct line between his brain and his groin, his pumping fist that twitched with a mind of its own in an increasingly desperate bid for release.
Harry landed with a heavy thud, and the weakness of his knees couldn't keep him on his feet for long. He slid to the floor, his belly twinging only slightly as was both familiar and inevitable with Apparition. He hurt just a little, and though not from the Apparition, the hurt was familiar too.
Draco accepted the bundle wordlessly, and even as he flipped to only the second picture he could see what Pansy meant. There was no life to the pictures. They were stagnant, posed, absent of the trembling fluidity that bespoke the subject caught in the midst of action. The only one ever remotely resembling such a shot was just a little blurred at the edges. A little, but enough that Draco couldn't refocus his attention away from the mar.
Harry sucked at Draco's lips, drinking in his breath, revelling in the warm press of his body until he was gasping for air. The ragged gasps of Draco's own breathing were all that managed to override the pounding of his skipping heartbeat in his head. It was the only thing that mattered. The only thing, until Draco drew away from him slightly.
His jerking hips and riding motion had abruptly stopped, but though Harry swam through a haze of pleasure, he was all too aware of Draco still thrusting beneath him with increasingly erratic jerks. Thrusts that pushed into him, grazing across the quivering mass of sensations and sparking them alight in an almost painful clamour. Steadying himself with one hand on Draco's chest, gasping in a desperate bid for breath that seemed to have abandoned him, Harry opened his eyes to the sight of Draco's flushed face, his eyes still open and fixed upon Harry's but expression wrought in a mask of his own pleasure that Harry had never seen before but knew instinctively. Even through the buffeting aftermath of orgasm, the stuttering hitch of his heartbeat and the unexpected heaviness of his limbs, Harry reasserted himself enough to push back further onto Draco just a little more, to push him just enough.
Levering himself slowly, almost delicately, with the arms of the chair, Harry climbed to his feet. He couldn't look at Draco, glancing around himself to the table, to their textbooks, to the notes he'd barely started that day, and shifted between his feet. He chewed his lip, gnawing over the urge to slink in Pansy's wake. He should leave. If Draco was pissed off – about Pansy's intrusion, her discovery, that she would make his life hell from there on out – Harry would probably be the last person Draco wanted to see. Even had Harry been comfortable right where he'd been, he wouldn't force his company upon Draco. It didn't feel right to do so. Maybe once upon a time he would have rolled his eyes and called Draco out on being a tosser, would have made light of the situation or even revelled in his sour mood, but not now. Not anymore.
Regardless of how mentally taxing caring for a resistant toddler in the midst of a war was, Lily couldn't allow it. It was hard enough to leave Harry when guilt dragged her to the warfront.
Matured. Matured was one way of looking at it. Making a complete personality about-turn was another. Did Harry truly not realise it? Or was he deliberately hiding himself and his character for reasons unknown?
"I think it's probably looking like an acid-based substance, though I'd have to check with an indicator first. You can see around the edges. See?"
Harry had suggested it as though it were commonplace. As though they'd been before. Maybe they had. Maybe there was an underlying reason for coming, other than the fact that it was clearly a gay bar and Ipetsky's blatant forwardness that had Draco scowling so severely wouldn't look out of place. The Wizarding world might not have a problem with it, but Muggles were inexplicably a different story when it came sexuality. It was just one of many things that had always baffled Draco.
"Harry James Evans, you'll refrain from using such language in my house," his mother called from the kitchen.
Harry opened his mouth, paused, and considered. He supposed… yes, Draco was right. Though it made him feel a little like a childish fool, he was indeed fascinated. And yes, it was somewhat amusing, their seeming reversal of roles. Harry found himself smiling. "We're coming full circle."
Leaning back against the bar, Harry propped his elbows on the counter and turned his regard upon the club. The sunken dancefloor was a jumping, bobbing mass of bodies, more like one fluid creature than separate entities. The raised floor surrounding it was almost as crowded, with every table was filled to bursting, and a constant stream of clubbers disappeared and reappeared again from the darkened corridor leading to the restrooms.
It was a breathtaking image even without the knowledge that Draco had conjured it from nothing. A display of magic for Harry, because he knew that it enchanted him.
"I don't like him!" Harry barely realised he was shouting, but it didn't matter. Hands falling to clutch instead at his knees, he stared up at the five women with nothing short of desperation. "I don't! I can't! After everything, it's impossible. I – we have always, always fought, and he gets on my every goddamn nerve, and he – he fought on the other side of the war! I don't like him! Not even a little bit, I swear!"
The touching, the kisses, the sex – it was incredible. Better than good. But for Harry, those quiet moments in between that seemed to smother his nagging concerns were just as wonderful.
"If you could go back, what would you change? What would you do differently? Would you even want to?"
"Thanks," he managed, before all but flopping onto his belly. His eyes slipped closed, or maybe his vision just faded; Harry wasn't sure and didn't really care. "You're a real champ."
So many unanswered questions – or answered insofar as 'it's magic, it just happens' could be considered an answer. It was less confounding and unnerving than it was fascinating these days. Harry was growing to find it less and less of an issue that he didn't quite understand how it all worked. In fact, that he didn't understand made it even more interesting. He'd have to ask Draco, maybe give it a go himself.
Still looping his tie around his neck and stumbling over his half-laced shoes, he could hardly be blamed for not looking where he was going. Even if such a disastrous start to the morning as almost tumbling head-over-heels down the stairwell was almost a daily occurrence.
"Where do you find these people, Pansy?" Draco asked, holding up a picture in the air and squinting at with the assistance of the more direct ceiling light. "You need a finer-toothed comb, I think."
Maybe Draco realised that, for he straightened slightly, tucking the wooden rod away. "I'll have to tell you," he said, decisiveness ringing in his words like a command. "You can't not know, even if you are Muggleborn."
Or, as it happened, not exactly like Gertrude. She seemed just a little atypical in her approach. Her prying was… different.
"Well, I am an upstanding member of society, after all," Draco said, smirk widening and pulling just slightly on the cut on his lip. "The hatred can easily be mistaken for adoration."
It was as disheartening as it was infuriating that Harry's mental coaxing only seemed to mostly work.
The very thought turned Draco's stomach. Him? Kill someone? He didn't think he was capable of it. Despite the brief, discomforting tightening in his belly, he picked up his toast and took a deliberate bite in the echoing silence of the Howler's destruction.
", and Harry caught the vague lift of his wand from the corner of his eye as he did so. A moment later and he was all but forced to glance up, because Draco had shuffled on his knees to his side and draped the warmth of an incredibly soft blanket around his shoulders.
"Then –" Draco paused. He pressed his lips together and cleared his throat before continuing. "Then what if I asked you to?"
Hermione sighed, though she too didn't appear particularly disappointed. "I should know better than to bet against you when it comes to Harry," she said, propping an elbow on the back of the couch and raising an eyebrow at Ginny. "You do know him best."
"Then this will be an experience for you," Harry said, making for the counter. "I see it as my duty to relieve you of your Maccas virginity."
Outside Ollivander's, there was even less foot-traffic. A stately building, old yet polished and sleek, it appeared to be empty of anyone but a single figure, little more than a shadow, positioned behind a wide desk. Squinting through the darkened windows, Harry could make out rows of shelving but not much else.
Hands tucked casually in his pockets, Draco tipped his head back to peer up at the sky overhead. It had darkened with evening, the glow of lampposts and their frosted breaths the only relief, but Harry didn't mind. With the weight of a satisfying dinner in his belly and Draco at his side, he didn't think he would mind if it were snowing a blizzard.
Throughout school, Draco was a git. Harry likely had been a bit too, but that understanding didn't dampen that they hadn't been friends. Far from it, even, and Harry recalled enough of his adolescence clearly enough to know that the very sight of Draco – sneering, scowling, smirking at him, or even blank-faced and distracted – could spark a flame of his anger.
Harry didn't protest. Once, he might have done, might have proclaimed how public image was nothing and that he could do whatever the hell he wanted. Time and experience had taught him that such wasn't true. It was far from the truth, in fact.
Harry stared at Draco and Pansy for a moment longer. Their composure was sliding back into place with every passing second; Pansy's lip curled again, and Draco's eyes narrowed to their previously hooded stare.
Malfoy didn't say anything. He took a breath, Harry knew, he felt it, but he didn't speak. Harry waited a beat, then two, and finally turned back to studying the sample.
The touch of fingers residually warm from the hotel as they curled around the back of Harry's neck in return.
Impossible. And yet, time and again as Harry had spent sleepless night after sleepless night lost in thought, he kept hearing Draco's words. He kept seeing his expression, wrought into a picture of frustration and agitation, so far removed from his usual cool composure. Draco seemed to let his guard down a little more around Harry these days, but not that much. Certainly not that much.
With only a quick glance over his shoulder at his house, he turned and set off at a run for the roadside.
The only thing Harry really cared about was that he was content. Unexpectedly content – or unexpectedly to some Wizarding interviewers that still shook their heads as they called him a 'darling Saviour'. Fashion, photographs, his name in gossip magazines more often than tagged to news headlines… It wasn't necessarily what he'd wanted, but Harry was busying himself and that was satisfying enough.
Draco regarded him, and his eyes were still incessantly hooded, his face persistently blank. Except that his expression was just a little too still, his cool detachedness broken by a slight hint of colour. It was the barest flush so minimal that it might have been overlooked entirely if Harry hadn't been sitting so close to him. Next to him. On him.
He wanted to know. He wanted to understand what hummed and quivered between them, what that tension – palpable ever since Harry had Apparated to the portkey terminal barely a day before – had been. It wasn't a bad tension, not I the least, but the way it made his skin prickle, dancing as though struck by static, was unmissable.
Approaching the Dragon's Nest, feet scuffing up the stone steps towards the arching doorway with its metallic beast slumbering on the front, Harry glanced around himself. He skimmed over the familiar faces of the Patil twins, of Neville standing alongside Hannah in quiet yet enthusiastic conversation, of Terry and Michael arguing and Susan and Mandy sharing a laugh. He skipped over Seamus as he led the way into the tower, hauling Dean after him, then glanced over his shoulder towards the trickling tail end of their party. He frowned.
"Quite," Draco replied without inflection. He hadn't much care for posturing these days, even from waiters. "Though it could hardly be constituted evening just yet."
Harry shook his head, glancing briefly towards Gertrude with her incessant smile and then back to the severe woman. "I'm not modelling material. I've never had any experience in doing something like that. What Gertrude said before was…"
Mostly, however, he didn't like being surrounded by so many people. Not only had Draco learnt to be wary of people as a whole, but in a club…
She continued, but Harry didn't feel much need to add his two cents. He was there to listen and respond to her questions, after all. And, not so surprisingly as he'd felt just that way in years, he didn't mind. He didn't feel disgruntled that his opinions were practically overlooked. He didn't care that he didn't get to choose who interviewed him, or what was to be asked, or what he would wear in the shoots and how it would all be compiled and presented. He simply didn't care.
Jackie didn't even bat an eyelid at his correction. She turned to him, lips pulling to the side as she always did when smothering a grin. "Look at this, Harry. We've actually excelled at something vaguely sociable."
Absently scuffing the side of his head, Harry shrugged. "I don't know what's going on. I mean, I don't really understand what Pansy was talking about, but she clearly annoyed you. And it had something to do with me, so –"
Jill was too, but even after years, she still compulsively flinched whenever someone misgendered her. Kurt and Jacob knew it, too. They took every opportunity to coax a response. Being the kind of person Jill was, she didn't rise to the bait.
Harry swallowed past a different kind of lump in his throat this time. He nodded. While not expressly correct, Jackie was close enough.
"So that's why everyone else in Hogwarts hates you?" Memory of Ron's palpable dislike rose to the forefront of his mind.
With a trembling hand, Harry clamped his fingers over the slice running down his arm. It stung, throbbing with his heartbeat. Warm blood pumped from the wound, and that was terrifying in a whole new way. What if he kept bleeding? What if the cut got infected? Lip trembling despite his teeth clamping into it, Harry stared down at his arm turned invisible in the darkness.
Neither of them contributed to the assignment, however. And neither would they, if Harry's past experiences with Jackie were any precedent. Draco had suggested the same for Pansy.
"No," Harry said, nodding. "But you can change how you act from now on. You can't tell me that you don't look down on me and my friends. Hell, you even my school."
Harry lifted only his eyes. Draco was watching him intently, his own book resting open in his lap. "Does he?"
Touching wasn't a thing. Not quite with Hermione, or with Ron. Barely with Ginny when they'd been together, and not even a handhold with Cho. Before that, with friends, with family, with –
Only the distant hum of the occasional passing car accompanied Harry's jog towards the bus stop. He was definitely running late, but turning the corner at the end of the road, could he really be blamed for stopping at the fence of number eleven? The lumbering labrador, tail thumping in greeting as it did every morning, was a greeting Harry couldn't bypass, even at the risk of missing the bus entirely.
"I do," Draco replied. There wasn't the barest hint of jest in his own voice. "I know you never liked being the centre of attention, even if I pretended otherwise. You hated it when reporters came to the school, or when you had to get your photo taken. You always tried to get out of any situation that put you in the middle of it all, though it rarely worked given you're you."
"That's good of you, but I think that most of the secrets anyone really cares about are already in the open."
This time, when Picard stalked from the room and closed the door behind her, Draco swung towards Pansy with the full force of his glare. "I hate you," he growled.
Harry stared at him. For a moment, he wasn't entirely sure he wasn't seeing things. But no, it was definitely Draco standing before him, staring at him with such keen-eyed attentiveness that it was impossible to look away from him. How he'd gotten there, Harry didn't know. It wasn't possible; Harry had been tearing at breakneck speed across the school and had apparently all but flown over a fence, regardless of if he could remember that flight. There was no way Draco could be standing there before him.
Snorting, peeling an eye open from where he'd closed them minutes before, Harry met Jackie's gaze through the darkness. The streetlamp outside his window was enough to make out her features down to the disgruntled set of her lips.
Pausing for a moment on the threshold, Harry brushed his fingers across his lips. He was smiling again, he realised. It happened quite often of late, and quite without Harry's direct consent. He found he didn't mind quite as much as he once had. He didn't even mind that the previous day Jackie had given him a disconcerted sidelong glances when she noticed, or that Jill seemed strangely knowing for someone who shouldn't know anything at all. Regardless of how much he loved them, Harry wasn't sure how to broach the subject of his dating Draco. They would be supportive, he knew, and Abel likely would be as well, but for some reason, the time just hadn't been right. Not yet.
Without turning her head, Pansy drew her gaze towards him. Her lips twitched very slightly. "He's very good, Draco. One of the best, even. It was a lucky break that I caught him when I did, actually; he found me a good couple of photographers and editors that he's worked with before and got them to lay off their prejudice for a bit."
"Out of the way, Harry," James said, his voice thundering, forbidding of resistance as his wand shifted to point around him. Harry had never seen him so terrifying. "Let me deal with this. A Malfoy? Honestly, do you think it's been so long that we'd forget?"
But Pansy was different. As she stared down at Draco with her face blank and eyes unblinking, Harry couldn't help but feel a little sad for her. Not pity – he didn't think he could consider such a thing, not for Pansy – but definitely sadness. Even Draco was changing, but Pansy…
There was so much about that statement that Harry objected to. For a moment, he could only stare up at Draco, his mouth hanging open. Then he held up a hand. "Hold on one fucking second."
"It sounds a bit weird, doesn't it?" Potter said, ignoring Draco's mental demand. He shook his head a little. "But, then again, I think it would be weirder if I called you Malfoy, don't you?"
Harry didn't know. He wasn't sure, and the unfamiliarity of not knowing left him feeling oddly exposed in a way that he hadn't felt since his first casting had demanded he take his shirt off. Not since his first assessor had told him he was 'too fat' and 'should probably work out more', and his first rejection notice had given him a thorough rundown of exactly why he wasn't good enough for the job. Not even when someone had stalked him with a camera for a time and sold some grainy but distinct enough photos to a magazine that had impeded any job offers for a solid month.
“Very poorly,” Draco said. His fingers drummed against his knee, belying his easy drawl. “Even Harry caught on.”
Draco stood and moved toward the open window. Sticking his head out, he leaned his elbows against the sill. Outside was just an overgrown alley – dirt and weeds and discarded bottles – but the hum of insects and the sun-warmed air always managed to settle Draco. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, trying to deduce what Maeve was baking from the scents on the wind. It would be easier, of course, to simply walk to the kitchen and ask, or even to shout the question across the space between them, but this way was infinitely more fun.
“Hello,” Blaise offered, nodding in Harry’s direction without making eye contact. “Right, must be off! Draco, I’ll drop by later this week.” He clapped Draco on the shoulder and was gone.
His cock throbbed, and though he instantly regretted abandoning his suggestive pose, he couldn’t quite manage to make his limbs obey him. Hardly able to breathe, let alone move, Harry stared slack-jawed at Draco.
This chapter contains a brief mention of past self-harm (magically inflicted). Please read with care. Love to all! <3
“Probably.” Draco attempted a smile, but it looked more like a grimace. “We didn’t exactly have the healthiest of childhoods.”
Luna stared after them, trembling. Malfoy strode over and put an arm around her, speaking softly into her ear. Harry couldn’t hear what he was saying, but Luna shook her head and collapsed against Malfoy’s chest. He held onto her as she cried, rubbing her back soothingly.
Draco demanded in horror. “But it’s my most rudimentary tea! Only one flavor profile, and so bland.” He wrinkled his nose in displeasure.
Almost before she finished speaking, platters began to appear on her desk, covered in eggs and toast and pastries. She gestured for them to help themselves.
Draco himself however, was still, almost unnaturally poised – painstaking control exerted over a body primed for flight.
Harry was frowning slightly at Hermione and he began to fidget in his chair. Draco hurriedly let go of Harry’s knee and leaned toward Hermione.
Draco inhaled shakily and began to fiddle with that dry tea bag again, fingers tugging at it almost violently. After a moment, the filter paper tore, scattering dried leaves across the table. Harry wanted to stop and ask Draco what was wrong, but he was sure Draco wouldn’t thank him for drawing Hermione’s attention to his unease.
There was nothing to be gained from these small, petty rebellions. Draco had done wrong, had had a hand in spreading the evils of the war, had proven that he was not to be trusted with magic. His punishment was justified, whatever Maeve had to say about it… even if Harry Potter seemed to agree with her.
Draco frowned when he noticed Harry’s expression, but Harry waved off his concern and sprawled on the floor near Ron. Draco sat beside him.
Malfoy’s comments were well thought out and interesting and made a hell of a lot more sense than Driffield’s babbling. Once Malfoy started participating, things seemed to click for a lot of the eighth years, and suddenly other voices were offering opinions and answers.
certain, which is why it had taken him nearly three weeks to decide to speak to McGonagall. But every time he told himself he should respect Draco’s choices, Harry found himself thinking of that leather notebook full of calculations, and of the lie in Draco’s eyes when he had dismissed it as
McGonagall tapped a fingernail against the table, an oddly calculating look on her face. It was almost as though she was about to tell Harry off, but then her eyes softened with something that was not quite sympathy.
“Because you were a child,” Harry cried. “Because you had no good choices. Because you did what you had to do to
Harry swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat and kissed Draco tenderly. When they broke apart, Harry lifted himself to sit on the edge of the desk and pulled Draco between his legs.

, not even glancing down at the words. He would never admit it, but the book was nothing more than a convenient prop. What Harry was actually doing was staring across the room at Draco Malfoy, and he didn’t want his friends to notice.
“Yeah,” Harry said, voice embarrassingly rough. “I’ve never been so happy.” He thought for a minute before adding, “It’s been slow, and there’s been a few rough spots, but he’s – everything I didn’t know I needed.”
“It is necessary, if I say it is necessary,” she stated firmly. Clapping her hands together as if the matter was settled, she tapped her wand against a pear-shaped crack in the wall beside her. “Now then, I believe a celebratory breakfast is in order.”
Harry snorted. “Draco, I wouldn’t turn down a cup of your tea if it made me late for my own wedding.”
But Driffield dismissed Malfoy’s contributions, listening with a distracted air before moving on, never validating Malfoy, except for the occasional mumbled
Draco sighed. He closed his eyes and leaned into Harry’s touch for a single heartbeat before pulling away. “I’m just telling you what I felt.”
And so, Harry had put off his plans for the greenhouse, not wanting to do anything that would make Draco feel pressured to move in before he was ready.
When Draco released him, Harry lowered himself onto the bed. He draped himself artfully across the pillows, stretching until he felt his t-shirt ride up. He heard Draco’s sharp inhalation and smirked up at him, watching Draco’s eyes darken as they caught on the bared skin. Harry felt the gaze as if it were Draco’s hand caressing the trail of hair that led down to Harry’s cock.
A soft moan escaped Draco, and Harry smiled at the embarrassed little sound that followed it. Draco’s hand slipped, and Harry nipped gently at his fingertips before pulling Draco into his lap.
Draco inhaled sharply, and his eyes filled with the beginnings of tears. He swallowed hard and then abruptly stood.
When he returned, Draco had been sitting on the bed fully dressed. He was staring down at his hands, looking rather lost, but when Harry sat down next to him, his eyes cleared and his mouth twitched into the beginnings of a smile.
Dazed, Draco blinked at the fire, the afterimage of Hermione’s face shimmering behind his eyelids. He shook his head and turned to Harry.
Harry huffed out an exasperated breath, which finally seemed to capture Malfoy’s full attention. He turned to face Harry with a sigh.
Staring at the empty stands, Harry slowly reasoned it out. “The potion protects our magic – but Jaffey and her partner must have attacked the hooks directly. We’ve never tried that before.” He paused, gnawing on his lip thoughtfully. “It makes sense they’d react more strongly if they were being threatened. Maybe Voldemort even built in some type of defense mechanism.” Blowing out a resigned breath, Harry concluded, “so the hooks must’ve twisted their spell Dark, and it hit the flowers.”
of buildings; he had never heard of wards that trapped people inside of them. Besides, if whatever had caused his apparition had circumvented the wards to get Draco in, he should not have had any trouble getting out.
Harry let out a little gasp, and Draco opened his eyes, coming more fully awake as his mind caught up with him. He hadn’t meant to get so serious, or to let his guard down quite so much. He squirmed uncomfortably, then sat up, leaning against the wall next to Harry.
“Oi! Is this a thing then?” He was standing over Harry and Draco, gesturing between them. “You two?”
The nostalgia in Draco’s voice was like a summer wind chasing through Harry, stirring up forgotten dust. His heart cried out, aching with a want that Harry could not quite define. He swallowed hard before moving to sit beside Draco.
“Not particularly,” Draco said lackadaisically. He folded his hands behind his head and closed his eyes. He looked like a prince in a fairytale, the sunshine turning his hair into a crown of gold.
“Yeah, she did,” Harry agreed. “But before that Voldemort killed me. Didn’t sever the bond between us though, so I was able to come back. I had a choice.”
Harry turned to see Draco standing with his back pressed against the smooth wall where the door had been, hands scrabbling behind him for a nonexistent doorknob.
Draco hesitated, then sped up as well, matching his strides to Harry’s. In a carefully neutral tone, he asked, “Do you think you might enjoy teaching?”
before I could get away!” Malfoy paused to glare at Harry, as if the fifteen minutes between knowing where Harry was and being free to find him had been a burden too heavy to bear.
“No.” Draco’s voice was hard as he cut Hermione off. It felt like a window had come crashing down, shutting out the smell of flowers and sunshine, leaving the air tepid and stale.
Instead, he found himself leaning closer to Potter across the table, teasing and laughing and blushing as they passed the evening talking of other things.
“I suppose I thought it would be more explosive, somehow,” Malfoy admitted. “Hurled insults, wands drawn, that kind of thing. If we even spoke at all.”
“I was going to get a sandwich.” The words tumbled off his tongue in such a rush that it took Draco several seconds to decipher their meaning. Potter’s blush deepened as he continued. “Do you – er, do you want to – to come along?”
“I see.” Maeve crossed her arms smugly and leaned across the counter, making an obvious show of studying Harry. “And Harry is not exactly an old friend who did not hit you?” The words sounded more like a declaration of victory than a question.
When Harry had shown up at Bloom Orchards this morning, clutching the letter they had sent months ago and ready to volunteer, he had expected a more gradual start. He thought he might meet the staff, observe some lessons or activities, maybe play some games or chat with a few kids one on one. Instead, he found himself surrounded by a dozen children aged five to seven, leading an impromptu flying lesson.
“It is jarring, certainly,” Draco went on, “and – embarrassing, at times, but it has not hurt us. And if it functions by sending help to the person in need…”
Watching Draco work was a particular weakness of Harry’s. There was something about his quiet absorption that stirred Harry’s blood. It was almost as if Harry could see Draco’s potential writhing beneath his skin, as everything he was – and everything he could be – trembled on the verge of discovery. His manic thirst for knowledge distilled into a single, crystal-sharp point. A stillness that was as charged as any motion. To Harry, it felt like watching miracles unfold.
“You like it?” Draco said. He tightened his fingers on his mug, let the heat of it sear into his palms.
“Save it, Potter,” Malfoy interrupted harshly. He pulled his knees to his chest. But his voice softened slightly as he added, “You don’t owe me anything.”
“How do you apologize to him? Buy him an aggressively fancy tie and ask him to perform a financial risk analysis?”
Draco blushed, face feeling hot enough to rival the bold red of Harry’s t-shirt. He stood and busied himself with lowering the blinds. The streetlamps had winked on while they were eating, and the fluorescent light created an unpleasant glare against the table. He left enough of a gap at the bottom to still allow in the breeze. It fluttered his shirt tails, and for some reason, Draco found the sight calming. “I had hoped you’d forgotten about those,” he sighed. “You were half asleep when you looked at them.”
The word seemed to break the spell over both of them. Draco jumped back a step and averted his eyes, while Harry yanked the blankets from beneath him and threw them over his lap. He pushed himself upright and leaned against the headboard, dropping his head into his hands.
“What do you mean?” Harry rolled toward Malfoy and propped his head in a hand. He was surprised when Malfoy mirrored the movement, turning to face Harry.
Harry glanced around the room and caught Ron’s eye, but he just quirked his eyebrows playfully at Harry before returning to the chess game he was playing with George. Hermione was snuggled into the corner of the sofa, feet on Ron’s lap and her nose buried in a book. She waved merrily at Harry without lifting her eyes from the page.
He collapsed on top of Draco and nuzzled into his neck. Draco wrapped his arms around him and sighed contentedly.
There was a thud next to him, and Draco’s beautiful face appeared. His eyes were wide and full of tears.
“I’ll try,” Draco whispered, wiping the back of his free hand across his eyes. “I’m just really going to miss you.”
Draco pretended to grumble, but he yawned again and smiled gratefully as Harry pulled the blankets up to their waists.
Impulsively, Harry took Malfoy’s hand, and Malfoy did not pull away. The shadows retreated. Malfoy gripped onto Harry tightly, and continued.
Draco’s lithe form darted past. He looked over his shoulder at Harry with a grin, then executed a perfect hairpin turn before swooping away in the other direction.
Maeve gave Draco a little push, then trailed after him down the hallway. With one last suspicious look at her, he unlocked the door, slipped the key into his pocket, and made his way across the threshold.
“He used to talk about it all the time when he first started,” Weasley continued, “but I could never really picture it, you know?”
The beginnings of rage bubbled in Harry’s guts, though he wasn’t sure whether to direct it at the Ministry or himself. He’d spoken on Draco’s behalf at the trials, made sure he wouldn’t end up in Azkaban in punishment for being traumatized and manipulated into his childhood mistakes. Harry knew that Draco had done wrong, but he had seen enough during the war to know that the children of Death Eaters had had no good choices.
The scruffy wizard manning the desk in the club’s foyer waved them on without even glancing at their membership passes, too absorbed in his magazine to bother with regular customers. Lavender dumped her bag into an empty cubby, then placed her palm against it to lock it with her magical signature. Harry threw his wallet into one of the smaller cubicles and after a moment of indecision, rid himself of his hoodie as well. The air was always unpleasantly cold in here, the bare concrete walls providing little insulation, but he knew he’d work up a sweat soon enough.
