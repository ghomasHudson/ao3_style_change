Severus knew for a fact that his Lord didn’t have a hand in the two going missing. His Lord had a plan for Draco, one that wouldn’t be possible with the young Malfoy missing. And that meant the Dark Lord was fuming. Ranting and raving about cowards and betrayal. Both him and Lucius had tried reassuring their Lord that Draco wasn’t a coward and that he wouldn’t betray them.
Whatever way Draco went Harry wanted to hex his mate, because it seemed Harry entered the large room first. It fell silent when he walked in and he could feel every person in the room eyes on him. Included the Professor at the staff table. Professor Mcgonagall and Sprout gave him a welcomed smile, while Snape barely looked away from his plate. The headmaster face smiled but it made Harry felt cold. He quickly made his way over the Gryffindor table. Ron and Hermione scooted apart making room for him on the bench between them. He gritted his teeth and sat down.
“Now. Potter.” The blonde snapped at him, and Harry found himself moving to the small dressing room area.
He didn’t move as Remus turned away and stared heading inside the large gates just out side the school.
But then an arm wrapped around him and instead of running or fighting he relaxed a little. It was weird being so keyed up and freaked out and then the second the arm wrapped around him, he felt better. Calmer more relaxed, he leaned against the body and had a strange thought of being home.
What he hadn’t told his godfathers about was the letter from Lucius telling him to contact one Amelia Bones head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Which he had, he sent her a lengthy letter, in which Draco had spelled to only open when she agreed to keep everything, including his involvement, secret until everything was set up. He wrote her about Sirius lack of trail and the confrontation with Peter Pettigrew in his third year. He even found a way to send her copies of his memories from that night and the night of Voldermort’s return. Showing her how Pettigrew had helped resurrect the Dark Lord. Proof that the man was a Death Eater and a traitor.
He should be worried about Malfoy using this against him but instead he was clinging to the blonde like a life line, using the other’s steady heart beat to ground himself, to stop the building panic he felt building and he wasn’t sure if he regretted it. Because for the first time in months he felt he found someone to trust again.
He heard the blonde growl. As Harry rounded a corner he saw the doors to the Great Hall and slowed his steps.
he really should have told him, Draco was going to be mad about him keeping secrets, not that he meant to, it just slipped his mind.
Twice the kid, started to talk but shut his mouth over the words. His companion quickly answered for him. But Remus's wolf was pushing him to check over the other student. He shook his head and stuck out his hand, "Well, I'm Remus."
Harry remembered Sirius, his Sirius, mentioning his favorite cousin before. Maybe when he made it home he could ask his godfather more about her. If she was still around maybe she could give him some advice.
Malfoy was about to say something, probably another insult when the door opened and Grimmhook walked back in.
He turned to meet his concerned mates eyes. “If it will help us stop him, yes.” Draco’s eyes narrowed before he smiled and gave Harry a quick kiss, “Okay, but I’m coming with.”
A/N: Guys I just published my very first novel, please check it out on Amazon, Malevolence by C.A. Human
He could remember hearing Charlie talk about how powerful different parts of a dragon could be, that’s why they were popular ingredients in wands and also why dark wizards try and hunt and kill dragons that are protected on preserves like the one Charlie worked.
So, he told him about the meeting at the bank, the circle, and the meeting at the twins later that day. It took a little over a hour an hour, before he had finished and Lupin called Black back into the room. Lupin was faster about telling the story as he filled in the other man while they ate.
“You trust them?” Malfoy asked sitting back down. Harry swallowed, his gut told him yes. That he could trust them. But he was having a hard time trust his gut after everything he had discovered lately.
She looked at his father and then across the table at Pettigrew. The rat of a man shrugged and then looked at his food.
“I do--” Mister Malfoy was cut off by the door open again, him and his brother turned to look at the door.
Harry woke up the next morning feel better then he had in weeks. The feel of the familiar blankets and bed, the soft purr in the air of the castle’s magic, told him he was home. Sure, it wasn’t the same, but it was enough for him to feel safe.
“Yeah?” He asked, wondering how long the man had been standing there watching him while he had been lost in thought.
Bill looked at all of them for a brief second, the sighed, “This has to do with Dumbledore doesn’t it?’
Fred used his wand to summon all the papers and floated them to his brother’s lap. Him and George sat there quietly as Charlie read over them.
“You should have told me,” Sev scolded as he stormed into the room. His old friend stopped and stood in front of him. Lucius could tell Severus was fuming and he didn’t need to ask what the brewer was talking about.
Then reached for another, Harry now more than a little worried, rushed across the room, snatched the current book being held by the slytherin, and slammed Malfoy against the shelves.
“What!” They both shouted jumping to their feet. George held out his hand for the paper, the goblin handed it over. They both looked down at it and it was true and Fred wanted to rip it to pieces and from George’s grip on the paper so did he. Fred couldn’t believe their mother, though it did explained Ginny’s obsession with Harry. They had both tried talking to her over the years but she kept telling them that Harry and her were meant to be. He sighed and looked at his brother, this was all their mothers’ fault. Before either brother could rip apart the paper, the goblin took it from George’s hands.
“They are old and strong.” The goblin went on, “However, they appear to be weaken and I believe we can remove them.”
.” Lucius head spun at the power of the command coming off the werewolf. Surprise didn’t cover how he felt, he had always assumed Lupin was a submissive wolf. The man was reserved, quiet, and shy in the way he seemed like to disappear into the background and let people forget he was there. But it seemed Lucius was mistaken, Black let out a whine and lowered his head.
“All right, Who’s first?” Harry looked at the Floo, he really hated traveling by floo powered, he always ended up flat on his face.
Harry laughed and grabbed Malfoy's wrist dragging the blonde in between to rows of books. Then he slipped off the cloak.
“Okay what’s up?” Their older brother asked, crossing his arms over his chest and narrowing his eyes at them.
The goblin looked, well annoyed, and Harry could guess why. The way Malfoy said it was as if it was an everyday thing, that any goblin could have helped with. He groaned.
“How much money do you have?” Harry asked, when he finished as much food as he was going to be able to keep down. The blonde looked up at him and raised his eye brow, making Harry want to roll his eyes.
“I will be keeping my last name for now. There are certain people who can not know of our marriage yet,” the man said, looking at the three of making sure they understood.
They spent the next hour slowly moving around the room, getting changed and packing all their belongings into their new trunks. Malfoy then shrunk them, so they could be placed in the pocket of their robes. He didn’t speak much, truth was his throat was dry and he wasn’t sure words would find their way out if he tired. And he was grateful because the blonde seemed to sense it, because he didn’t try and make him talk.
He nodded his head. “Yeah. They don’t really show emotion. So, he trends to do things in weird ways. He probably figured I would yell at him to get lost, if he came. Which I guess I would have. So, he sent you.”
“I’m going to shower, then try to get some sleep.” He said, leaving Malfoy to make of the statement what he would. Then he got up, walked over to the rack and grabbed the pair of pants he picked out and on of the tank tops Malfoy had picked. He didn’t normally sleep with a shirt on, but he figure the blonde had gotten them for a reason.
Somewhere else in the room, Harry heard their names. He growled and clutched at Draco’s robes. His mind screaming that this was
“It won’t work.” Said Remus. Both twins turned to look at him, heads tilted to the side with questioning looks. “Your thinking his father's cloak?” The werewolf asked to making sure. They both nodded. “It won’t work, because it is there in the past as well. With James. Using something in both times would confuse the spell.”
It wasn’t fair that he was finally in a potions class not taught by the grease git only to end up with him as a partner. He quickly looked around the room trying to spot Malfoy. Or, course the blonde was grinning at him.
“But often, right?” he asked, trying to hide the worry in his voice. Because he wasn’t sure how long they would be trapped here but the sooner they got home the sooner the better. His life might be a mess right now, but he still had people counting on him. Just because Ron, Hermione and the headmaster turned out to be liars didn’t mean everyone else was. Plus, he needed to get back for Sirius. Even if he had no one else he had his godfather.
As he went to try on the clothes, he felt a little awed. Most of the clothes he owned where hand me downs or school robes. He had never been clothes shopping for himself. Sure, he had spent hours following along behind his Aunt, while she shopped for the others. Only bring him to carry the bags. But he had never himself picked out and tried on clothes for himself.
He snuck over to James’s bed and ran his hand along the top of the trunk at the end. It held the Potter crest, which Harry had only learned about when he saw it and asked the other Potter about it. When his hand slide across the etched symbol the trunk hummed. THen there was a click and the trunk came open.
While Harry had been standing there staring Igorth had approached his colleague and they were talking in low voice’s back and forth.
Grimmhook looked at him, “If we are to integrate you into this time, it would be wise to know the people who your interactions with could impact the future.”
Draco hopped the other boy found some useful information, he felt slightly bad for not having the right knowledge to help the emerging submissive.
He put the blondes notes back were he found them and picked up a small stack of coins, Malfoy must have left out. He hoped that they were left for him, because before this he hadn’t even see Malfoy’s money. Decided to let Malfoy sleep, he changed and pocketed the money.
He felt a little bad after him and Blaise turned in their potion, Dean called out to him but Harry rushed out of the classroom and hid in a dark corner until he heard the hallway was empty. It was just he didn’t know where Dean’s loyalties stood. Was he really Harry’s friend or was he just anyone person pretending? He knew he shouldn’t just lump Dean in with the others but it felt easier than chancing it and finding out he was wrong.
“We would like to speak to someone in private.” Malfoy said with a slight bow to the goblin behind the counter, Harry felt his brows lift and his mouth open. Did Malfoy really show respect to someone other then a pureblood wizard.
“If this was something personal about the younger Malfoy, we wouldn’t be here.” The other twin said.
Harry jumped to his feet and backed away from it and the table the second his mind told him what it was. How could he have forgotten that he had given it back to the man after everything was done. He swallowed around air as he tried to will away imagines of the chamber, Ginny, Tom, and the basilisk.
Sooooo ummmm this chapter is just over 6000 words haha. See it started off short at about 2000 but I had a crappy day, (which means I needed something to focus on) and I decided to rewrite it. My plan was to just go through and add more detail haha yeah that didn't happen. The chapter is way different then it started but I'm really happy with it. I hope you guys are tooo.
He stared at the paper, trying to understand. It wasn’t until the morning light started to peek through his window that he realized he had been staring at the small note all night.
Not that it put this weird morning cuddling thing out of his mind, because he knew soon or later Malfoy would mock or tease him about it, and he knew that if he reacted in any way but indifferent it would be come a thing.
He felt so overwhelmed. His fear, anxiety, regret, and anger grew every day he was stuck here and now he had guilt to add to his list. He sighed, feeling like an utter arse for not realizing how hard this had to be on his new friend. He had been so consumed with his own worry and fear that he for Draco was trapped here too. Yet, the annoying proud never complained about it. He been by Harry side and tried to help with everything he was capable and Harry hadn’t done the same. He felt bad about it and vowed to do better.
“It’s a good plan.” He said, watching as Potter drew into himself. Feet on the chair and arms over his knees.
“Do I want to know?” Bill teased, slipping off his jacket and tossing it over the back of a wooden rocking chair.
“For now, nothing. I do not know what Potter or Draco have planned but you are right, I will stand with my son.”
“Well you both are wearing Hogwarts rubs, so you are a bit away from home. But nothing some floo powered can’t fix. Come along, I have a fireplace this way.” He looked back over at Malfoy, unsure. Something was still off about all this. He could see Malfoy looking around, seeming as unsure as he was.
“Now for the other matter,” Lucius said before dropping a destroyed diary, fang free thankfully, onto the table before them.
Of, course, Malfoy was walking next to him and looked unfazed but their journey. He wondered if the blonde had some kind of glamor up that hid, how he really looked. Harry was tempted to take out his wand and check, but he was to tired.
He followed the werewolf out of the room and into a small potions lab towards the back of the cottage. The small room was full, Bill and Snape stood over a boiling cauldron talking in hushed voices. Charlie and the twins seemed to be comforting Sirius who looked extremely worried. Draco stood leaning against the far wall watching them all. Harry moved towards the blonde, standing close to him.
“It’s okay. I bet Sirius loves that someone is looking out for him. He never minded a bit of trouble anyways.” Hermione huffed but Luna gave him a blinding smile.
Grim: This is a reference to Sirius's dog form, as it matches the description of a Grim perfectly. With all the small little things in the books that pointed this out, from Trelawney's prediction to the couple times Harry saw it and thought of it as a Grim before he learned the truth. Not to meant Sirius's home is called Grimmauld place. I kinda always like the idea of Sirius and his friends using this to scare the shit out of people.  So, you find I'll use Grim for Padfoot. Cause you know it amuses me :)
“Father’s getting him,” Draco whispered back not looking at him. Harry could tell his normally pale mate was even more pale. He understood. What they were about to do was wrong, but necessary.
“I may have an idea about how to get money.” Malfoy said, “But first, we will go search for books. Though I doubt we will have much luck.” The last bit was muttered. Then Malfoy got up and headed for the door, never once looking back to see if he was being followed. Harry rolled his eyes at the blonde’s attitude of course he was used to people doing what he wanted and following his lead.
“It’s great for our Dragon treats--.” Fred said. Getting a startled look from just about everyone other person in the room.
He hasn’t heard George walk in, but suddenly he was wrapped in a warm hug. He dropped his head against his brothers’ shoulders. He could feel George shaking just as badly as him. They stood there long enough that they heard Bill come in. Though they didn't move as they heard Charlie greet him, it wasn't until Charlie called for them, that they broke apart.
“It’s the potion,” he told the man. Not wanting him to think that him and Remus had done this to his child. He saw Malfoy nod before he took his son from Charlie’s arms and headed back into the house. Sirius walked towards the twins who held Harry between them and did the same. He carried his godson into the house, passed the vile man on the couch, and into the bedroom.
Lunch went by surprisingly well right up until Lupin told Black he couldn’t come with them to the meeting.
He tried not to shift his body as he tried again, again the sleeping blonde tightened his hold when Harry tried to remove his arm
He entered the common room, grateful to see it full of mostly younger years. He headed straight for his room and took a relieved breath when the room was empty. He felt guilty for what he was about to do. But he and Malfoy had to get into the restricted section. And he knew of only one way to do it unnoticed.
About a half hour later, he dropped the book, he had been reading, on the bed, and walked over to the door. He knocked, “You coming out?”
He heard Remus mutter a “Yes,” as he walked out of the room and headed for the kitchen. When he entered he found Sirius and the twins chatting at one end of the table while Charlie and Blaise sat at the other end eating. All five people looked up as he entered.
He let himself linger in bed for a few moments before he reached out to the table next to his bed to grab his glasses and wand. A quick
“Now are you going to tell me why we can’t speak to the headmaster?” Malfoy asked, “Would could ask him to be the tether or to set one up. After all we know he will be at Hogwarts in our time.” He looked over to see Malfoy studying him.
The office door opened before they could discuss it anymore, in walked the goblin from before, only this time he carried a large black box and a frown.
“Blaise.” The Slytherin said after a moment. Opening his still darkened eyes at Harry. He was so caught in them that it took a second for the blonde’s word to process.
Malfoy closed his eyes and took a couple slow deep breaths. The strange tingle dissipated but Harry still felt the need to drop his head. He didn’t, not again.
He lost his smile as he looked at it, and then at Lucius. “You think that has something to do with why Voldemort didn’t die?” The older blonde nodded.
It burned, which he thought distantly would explain the coughing. Then a sharp pain radiated through his stomach and Harry gasped and wrapped his arms around his stomach, willing it to stop. When it was over he felt light headed and shaky.
“It changes. Depending on what you need.” Harry said, looking around the room. It was kind of simple two long couches and two arm chairs, set around a large circular table. Candle and lamps set around the room lighting it up bright warm light. To Harry surprise the far back wall was covered in bookshelves. There had to be a couple hundred books lining the shelves and Harry wondered if they would be useful in their search.
Snape sighed at their twin speak but nodded. “I believe that would work. How about for Draco?” He asked looking back at Malfoy and Blaise.
“I would also like to talk to a few of the Curse-breakers see if I can learn anything about what Dumbledore wants from Potter Manor.”
He groaned, did Malfoy really know he had been standing there gaping at him or was he telling him not to say anything. Whichever it was, he closed his mouth.
A few seconds later, the goblin that had been behind the counter came out followed by a slightly taller goblin that was well dressed and held a frown in his face.
“Now, Mister Potter,” Igorth said, oblivious to Harry’s wondering thoughts. “This tooth can be used as a powerful focusing object. Much like a wand. So, after we place your glamour’s, I want you to practice a few spells without your wand, to see if you can tap into the tooth’s magic.”
Again, they looked at each other. They were here to see if anyone had been in Harry’s vaults. Not see something so personal.
It does however bother me that instead of someone telling me of mistakes or errors, I get what feels like a put down and almost mocking sounding comment. I don't understand why, if you don't like the story, or you lose interest or find the writing horrible, you can stop reading it at anytime. There is no need to meanly inform me that you will no longer be reading my story. This story takes a lot of time and work and peoples comments genuinely make it worth it. But mean or upsetting comments can hurt. This is something I do for fun and entertainment, I don't earn anything past the happy feeling I get from writing and nice comments. So, please remember that when you guys leave comments.
Lupin placed his hand on his arm and apparated them. Lucius was surprised to find himself outside a small hut, on what looked like a empty beach. The smell of salt heavy in the air. He hated beaches the salt in the air tended to impact magic, making it harder to work. And when the door opened and very confused Sirius Black walked out, he understood why.
“Can you give them marks that look like they are from the metal cuffs?” He asked instead of telling the man he was impressed. He hadn’t thought about making it look like the two boys had fought back. It was smart, neither Harry nor Draco were the type to sit back and let someone hurt them.
“You have to show me this place we are supposed to meet. I figured we could do it before breakfast. We can also set a specific day and time.”
He cleared his throat to get the blondes attention. Then when Malfoy looked at him, he gave the other a lost look.
“We don’t know how long we are going to be here.” He pointed out, letting to blonde feel in the rest.
“Mister Potter and Mister Malfoy, have you made up your minds?” The Goblin asked sitting them down on the couches.
Draco’s head felt like it was full of cotton, or like Pansy had got him drunk the night before. He groaned and reached for his blanket, no way he was getting up yet. When his hand hit something, cool and, well pointed, he opened his eyes and looked down at it.
He put his hand on her back and tried to lead the Ravenclaw away from the Gryffindor table, but it seemed Ron and Hermione weren’t going to let him. Both his ex friends got up and followed behind him.
Also: This story was originally meant to be done in two Parts. THIS is officially the end of part one! I might go and change it so that this is the end and start a second for the part 2. I haven't decided yet.
“We swear.” The twins said, getting a sigh from him, Lucius, and a chuckle from Blaise. Who then added, “I swear.” The circle glowed and then a box appeared at its center.
“Oh, just walk in front of that wall three times thinking about that room.” He said sending the other student a smile over his shoulder, speeding up his steps.
Harry flinched from the sight. Draco’s face looked sunken and his eyes seemed dull. Stepping back so he could see Draco in full, he noticed how much thinner his mate looked. His once perfect fitting clothes now hung loose. The proud blonde’s hand shook and Harry reached and grabbed one. Giving it a squeeze before he drank his own potions.
Hearing his voice must have been enough to freak the other, because Potter yelped and jumped to his feet. Draco watched as he swayed from the sudden movement. Though he didn’t try to reach out and steady him, ‘served him right for over reacting,’ he thought.
“This looks to be in order.” Grimmhook said placing the papers on the table between them, “Only you have both left your names off.”
Malfoy glared at him for a moment and then gave a smile, “You and the m… Hermione pulled one over on the ministry and my father.” Then he laughed. “Perfect.” The blonde muttered when he stopped laughing, then he waved Harry on.
“The Potter and Peverell, family rings.” The goblin said, “Mister Potter is the last heir to both houses. As far as I can gather Dumbledore knows of the Potter family ring, but also knows he has no claim, even if he was Potter’s guardian. I do not believe he knows of the Peverell ring, as Potter’s trustees, I leave them in your hands to return to their proper owner when he returns.” After that they placed everything back into the black box, and carried it with them as they left.
He was about to reach down and shake the other teen and demand he tell him what happened, when he remembered.
He lowered his gaze to the floor, “ We can’t trust him.” He muttered, then cleared his throat. “Before all this,” he waved his hand and gestured around the room, “I got a note from someone I trust, telling me not to trust him. Then I found out that others have been lying to me too.” He looked up, hoping the blonde would get it. And that he wouldn’t have to go into anymore details.
“Well, hello dearies,” She said waving them over, “What can I do for you?” She asked. Harry saw out of the corner of his eye, Malfoy looked at him and then back at the women, it seemed the blonde was expected her to comment on Harry Potter being in her bar. Instead there was no look of recognition in her eyes. Giving Harry and horrible feeling in his stomach.
“So, don’t answer them.” It was said offhand, like it was no big deal. Hinting to Remus that it was most likely a Slytherin, meaning it was probably Luke.
He didn’t plan on being gone long, but he still left a small note on another piece of parchment before he left.
Harry’s blood ran cold, he was looking at Tom, really looking at him. Not only had the man not recognized him but he looked better. Younger, less grey hair and wrinkles. But that couldn’t be right. This was wrong, it had to be some kind of trick, because the only thing coming to mind about what could possible be happening, was to weird even for him.
I have recently had my very one book, Malevolence professionally edited, and the cover art done. (which I love!). I still have a few things to do before I can self-publish, but I am close. (You guys should check out the first 6 chapters, posted on here.) I also have a second book, Rescued that is completely finished, (first 6 chapters are also on here.) but it still needs editing, (have to save up the money).
The blonde just looked at him with a look that again told Harry that the blonde thought he was an idiot.
“Close your mouth Potter.” The blonde said, his voice the same, and for some reason that relieved Harry. Maybe because with a new look it would be able to forget who Malfoy really was, but no way would he ever forget that entitled tone in the blonde’s voice.
Not really in the mood to watch Malfoy shop, Harry quickly found a chair and pulled out on of the books, they had just acquired and started reading.
How could we not have seen it?” He looked at his older brother for help, he just didn’t understand any of it. He poured the tea and picked up the small potion bottle. He tried to pour it but his hands shook.
“We need a tether.” The blonde went on, oblivious to Harry’s inward struggle. “Someone in our time, to perform the same ritual with something to tie us to that place and time. That way when we perform the
He’d always imagined Hogwarts as a home, but it was nothing compared to this. Here he felt happy, content, and safe. He woke each morning excited to spend time with the others. A large part of him didn’t want to go back to school, he would rather stay here and spend time with his family. The thought of going back and having to pretend and fake his loyalty and friendships made him nauseous. He didn’t want to go back and be pulled into the headmasters game. He didn’t want to deal with his fake ex friends, or have to worry about Voldermort trying to kill him. He just wanted to stay here and be a normal magical teenager.
“Fucking…” One twin said at the same time the other cursed, “Hell…” And to his surprise Zabini spoke in sync with the due, “Truth circle.” Severus saw the twins eye the slytherin with interest, then they both grinned. And he felt a wave of worry. Not for Blaise but for the rest of the world if the three became friends. Keeping Draco and Blaise out of trouble was problem enough without the two Weasleys influence.
“Probably.” Malfoy said looking back over his shoulder at him. When he didn’t say anything else the blonde raided his brow, but Harry just shook his head and looked down at the ground.
“Interesting.” He whispered, Lupin look over his shoulder at him, eyes amber and narrowed. He understood the warning and bowed his head slightly. Respect not submission. Lupin nodded.
He took his time going to the bathroom, letting his mind wake up. Then he rinsed his hands and face and left the bathroom. When he sat at the table. He noticed a small roll of parchment in the center and reached out a grabbed it.
Then it was gone. Harry could still feel the tooth vibrating in his hand but the electricity and hum were gone.
A second later Blaise and Draco appeared, the blonde shoving Harry backwards until Blaise could close the door behind them.
He actually saw the blonde’s eyes roll, before he placed the book next to his drink and stood up, walking towards him.
He had decided to show Malfoy the Room of Requirements a few days before when they were discussing meeting up some where private. After all, sitting in the library talking about time travel and the future wasn’t a smart plan. The best place Harry could think of was the same room him and his ex-friends had used for D.A. meetings.  At first, he felt a little guilty about showing it to anyone else but then he remembered his friends weren’t really his friends. So, his guilt slipped away.
A few moments later Tom placed a big bowl of soup in front of each of them along with a glass of pumpkin juice Harry dived in right way, while Malfoy eyed it.
Harry quickly threw everything laying around his bed into his old trunk, shrinking it, he put it in his pocket and placed his new one in its place. Then he opened the new trunk to find his potions textbook and rushed out of the dorms and towards the dungeons. He didn’t want to be late on his first day back.
“What’s it like?” He asked, fidgeting with his robe, “Not the dorms or the common room, but the other students?”
He knew what she was doing. And it pissed him off. She was trying to distract him by telling him that Sirius was in trouble. Make him forget about what the article said and focus on the harm it could do to his godfather. He wanted to snap at her, scream at her for being a horrible person instead he turned to Luna.
“Why don’t they talk?” He asked, trying to remember if he had heard this before. He knew Sirius’s family had been mad when he was sorted into Gryffindor and that his godfather eventually moved in with his father and grandparents, but he couldn’t remember Siri talking about his brother.
“Sev?” He questioned moving to stand as close as he could to the other man, without touching him, “are you with me?” the question was whispered, as if he didn’t have the heart to say it any louder.
“The past.” He said when Black was out of ear shot. Lupin looked at him, at first he could tell the man wanted to say bullshit but he seemed to be thinking about it, then he placed his head in his hands, “Tell me everything.”
The goblin shook his head, “No, but we have always known there was a possibility. So, we have set up a number of plans, incase it was needed.” He sat down, “Now, was from misuse of a time turner?” He asked, only slighting glaring at them.
Harry tried so hard the night before to stay awake. After what had happened that morning he didn’t want to fall asleep and wake up wrapped around Malfoy again. When he has realized he was resting on the blonde’s chest and said blonde was wide awake, but not doing anything about it, his mind went blank and all he could think was run.
no wand in sight, across the room. This time not aiming for Harry. “Stupid...bloody...books.” He heard the blonde curse as he picked up yet another book and hurled it against a wall.
As they approached the small town, they passed a few people, none of them seemed to be surprised to see them. There was no pointing or gawking. No people coming up to him asking him millions of annoying questions, and no one accosting Malfoy. At first, he wasn’t concerned, figuring maybe it was a muggle town. But he noticed a few with wands and a group of small children using magic in the open.
The man was good at potions but that was it. He had no talent for dealing with students or people really. And Remus wasn’t sure if he would know how to handle a developing submissive. But before he could say anything, he felt Evan shift to look at the professor. Still not leaving his arms.
“It appears you are all here. Now I must ask each of stand and step inside this circle.” The goblin said as he waved his hand and a large white circle appeared in the center of the room. Etched runes glowing throughout it. Severus studied the circle, something about it seemed familiar, but he couldn’t place it.
“His brother is in Slytherin. They don’t talk much anymore.” James’s voice was so different then he had imagined. He always pictured the man sounding something like Sirius but in a weird way his father’s voice sounded like him.
“We have a couple theories,” Lucius said looking at his husband, “But we are having a difficult time finding any information that might be helpful.” The man sighed, “We are going to talk to Black after we leave here. The Black family has one of the most extensive family libraries, both light and dark magic. Hopefully we will be able to find something there.”
“We should get going. Owen’s partner should be checking up on him soon. And we don’t want to be here when he does.” Sirius nodded, but before he stood up and leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss on Harry’s forehead. Then he pushed to his feet and left the room as fast as he could so he didn’t risk changing his mind.
“Cut this in half and then add it to the cauldron.” Snape said, then added, “And it matters when you would rather partner with a Slytherin then one of your own housemates.”
“One for a second tracer spell on Potter’s wand,” The goblin went on, “several requests for curse breakers for Potter Manor. Though it appears the familial wards kept them out. No matter how many times Albus tried.” George winced, wondering if the curse breakers were okay, trying to break through familial wards was dangerous.
“Him and Sirius went to bed a little bit ago. We didn’t want to wake you up. I hope that's okay.” Evan nodded as he spoke. “Yeah, of course.”
“Sirius.” He tried in a firm voice to remind his friend that not everyone liked being dragged around. Not that he listened.
Malfoy was awake and reading, when he opened the door. The blonde looked up long enough to make sure it was him, then went back to his book.
“We got them,” one of the twins said, walking up behind them. Sirius swear Severus almost growled at the young redhead before he stepped back. He understood the urge when the other twin moved beside him and looked down at Harry.
“You will both need to be holding it and it will transport you to the school.” Harry felt his stomach drop, he hated travelling by these things. Why couldn’t they just take a car or train to the school.
Plus both Dumbledore and Tom have giving him the means to take them down. They placed him on a pedestal, the whole wizarding world knows his name, whether they praise him or fear him. They gave him fame, which gives him
“What could the goblins know?” He asked moving to his next to his brother, Malfoy’s gray eyes following him. “I don’t see Harry running off and hiding in a bank… though that’s not a half bad idea.” His brother laughed.
He left the empty classroom with a strong urge to see James. He needed to see him. Make sure he was okay. Logically he knew his friend was fine and that whatever would happen wouldn’t happen for a while yet. After all he hadn’t gotten with Lily yet, so no little Harry on his way. But just the knowledge that something was going to happen made him despite to see his friend.
“So, classes?” He asked sticking his hand out for his timetable. Thankfully Sirius allowed the subject change and handed him schedule.
The twins looked at each other. “We can’t. We can tell you about this, but not about what’s going on with Harry right now. Sorry.” Charlie studied them, then nodded in understanding.
When he reached the front gate, he had a moment of panic that the two kids weren't there. But then there was a buzz in the air that had Moony snarling. Then two large bodies came into be.
“Luna,” Hermione said grabbing the other girl’s arm. “I saw the article your father wrote about Sirius Black.” Harry stopped, Luna easily stopping with him. “While I’m sure Sirius is grateful it doesn’t seem wise to draw more attention to him. The man his in hiding and now he is going to be on people’s minds. It will make it harder for him to remain unseen.”
Malfoy throw his head back and laughed. “You talked the sorting hat out of placing in the house it wanted to put you in.”
“I’m afraid, Mister Snape, I can not tell you until each of you as stepped into the circle.” The goblin’s black eyes stared up at him.
Harry rose to his feet and moved to follow the small Goblin in front of him, he gave a look over his shoulders at the door, the blonde had stood up to greet the Goblin, but his eyes were on Harry.
“Let’s take this inside.” Lupin said, moving forward shoving his friend back into the hut. He followed them inside, wondering how the truth spell would react. He had been given permission to tell Lupin but not Black.
He had to fight a smile as he watched Evan looking him over in almost the exact same way his father had an hour before. When Evan seemed satisifted he was okay he relaxed and Remus felt his heart warm at the love he felt from the other boy.
“You don’t seem bothered, that he sent me instead of coming his self?” Sirius questioned, “I thought you were friends?” This time Harry did laugh. Which earned him a curious look from his godfather.
“I’ll fire call him.” George said, standing up and walking into their bed room were the fireplace was.
“It was important to him, Riddle I mean, he is the heir of Slytherin, he revelled in the idea that he was the only person who could get in there, is it possible he hide something in there?”
“We wanted to learn at a school.” He said, looking down at his food, “Get a better handle of stuff before we head out into the world.” He hated lying and knew that he should met their eyes and sound confident. So, they didn’t think anything was off about what he was saying but he just kept thinking of the fact that he was lying to his father, his godfather, and a person who was like a father to him. Something inside him didn’t like it.
He wasn’t sure how many he was supposed to pick out, so he ended up adding a third, clothes that he liked but didn’t have to have.
The blonde just sighed and pushed past him. Again, he found himself following behind the blonde, this time he didn’t make a comment even to himself. Instead he just handed the other teen his half of the books when they were ready to leave.
“They'll be okay, Black.” Sirius looked over at Severus who despite his words was running his hands through his own godson’s hair. He wanted to snap and yell at the bloody Slytherin but he didn’t. Not when he saw his own worry mirrored on the other man’s face.
“I…” He tried but when he looked up at Snape the man had a look in his eyes, they narrowed when Harry met them and the urge to cower or run slammed into him so hard that he actually felt his body start to move.
Whoever it was, was laying on their side, so he reached down and took the other person’s shoulder in his hand and turned them over.
“Are you two related?” Sirius asked, and suddenly it didn’t matter to him that the kid was lying because he knew what was about to happened. He shifted to look at his friend, hoping that this conversation wouldn’t go the way he imagined it would.
Harry hadn’t realized how much bigger he had grown since he first got the cloak. He and Malfoy had to stay close to make sure they were both covered. When the reached the restricted section, Malfoy pulled out his wand and whispered a spell, Harry didn’t know. The lock came open with ease and they slipped inside.

“Kin.” His brother answered his unasked question, “at least I think. I didn’t get any scales, my eyes have never changed but my mind work faster than normal and I have an almost perfect memory. From the research I’ve done, Dragon Kins are known for higher intelligences.” He shrugged, “I was never really sure, but if you and Bill are both Kin and the twins are Azenab’s, I fit the Kin descriptions more.”
“It seems we have some other business to attend too,” he said looking over the strange group, “before we can leave. However, if any of you which to talk all this over, we have a flat over our shop. You can meet us there tomorrow.”
“Siri, Your wanted.” Black growled and Lucius was curious about the canine smell that filled the air, he hadn’t known the Black line carried a creature, in fact, he was sure they didn’t. Narcissa would have told him, if only because of Draco.
He sighed walking down the next row, even the room of requirements hadn’t had anything of help. It seemed the room had tried. Giving him books on the theory of time travel as well as the invention of time turners but nothing on actually time travel being possible.
“Now this,” Igorth said pulling out a necklace. The chain was thin and silver, but on the end hung what appeared to be a fang of some kind. “Is a dragon’s tooth. Powerful magic, and it will power and maintain the glamour’s we place upon you. The chain is enchanted as well. Protection spells weaved into that will cause it to warm if a spell or hex is aimed at you. It will also shield you from good number of spells.” Harry heard what the goblin said, even as he stared in wonder at the tooth.
Charlie reached out to stop him, he didn’t want to force Percy. But before his hand could touch his brother the twins grabbed him and pulled him back to the couch, giggling as all three hit the back. He heard Bill snort from in front of the fire place before he stepped into and disappeared in green flames.
Sirius had been the one to buy and pack it but Remus had handed it to him last night before he left the hospital wing. He told Harry they didn’t trust the headmaster not to have spelled or warded Harry’s belongings that had been left behind so they bought him new ones. All he had to do was switch out the trunks and give the old one to Remus when he saw him. The werewolf had promised to go over the map and cloak as soon as possible and get them back to Harry.
His mate must have agreed because he too growled, not even pulling away far enough to break their kissing. It sent an excited spark through Harry.
Slughorn looked over at them but Remus had removed his attention from the man and towards Snape who was eyeing Evan. Remus could see it in his eyes that he was figuring out what Remus already had. Evan was submissive and didn’t know. And that he, Remus had just claimed him as under his protection.
Harry couldn’t help but feel a swell of happiness as they entered the Great Hall, seeing the familiar magicked sky and floating candles along with all the students seated at the four long tables. Made him feel like he was home, even if it wasn’t truly the same, it was still Hogwarts.
He easily found the two people he was dreading and dying to see, on the right side of Remus sat a dark-haired boy with glasses talking to a red headed girl. She had her hear thrown back in a laugh and the boy’s face looked like he was watching the greatest thing in the world.
His mate glared at him, “Of course I'm with you, you idiot! I’m just pointing out how stupid this is. And that we will be on our own. Only Potter and his friends at our side, against two of the strongest wizards alive.” His mate took a breath, “I am just wondering if we have enough allies to win.”
“George I’m telling you that snakes skin will not make these taste better.” He looked at his twin who was grinning at him. “Nope, brother of mine, but it will make them glow pretty.” They both laughed.
Three long days later, Dumbledore sent him an owl saying that he would have to stay with his relatives for the rest of summer, due to something happening with the Order.  With any hopes for his summer ruined, Harry fell into a dark and miserable mood. Left with nothing else to think about Harry kept thinking over Sirius’s waring, and the ramifications if his godfather was right and they couldn’t trust Dumbledore.
“Potter.” There was a draw to the way the blonde said his name that hinted it wasn’t the first time he had said it. Harry shook his head and looked at the other teen.
“Bonded.” Lucius said, “It seems the last of the Headmaster’s bindings have broken and your creature side as fully emerged and just now it started the bonding process with Draco. If I hadn’t stopped you, you would have--” the man gave his husband a pleading look. At which Harry blushed because he figured out what Lucius hadn’t wanted to say.
Once inside the book store, he intentionally went a different direction then Malfoy. He has a feeling they were going to be stuck with each other for at least a few days and he was going to take any chance he could to be alone.
He eyed the bottle and then looked at Draco. His mate gave him a reassuring smile and pressed the bottle to his lips, drinking it all in one go.
His friends all exchanged looks and he felt Sirius relax next to him. Remus took a second to give his friend a look. But Siri looked over him towards James.
“Nothing,” they said together, both turning towards the door and walking out. Harry’s stomach flopped when Draco headed down a separate hallway. He hesitated as he watched Draco walked away. Then with a deep breath he forced himself to continue towards the Great Hall.
Harry walked to the supply cabinet at the front of the classroom, gathering everything they would need for their potion and rushed back to their table. He was hoping to avoid anyone that might want to talk or lecture him.
Harry was covered in sweat and hungry, by the time, he reached the bottom of the hill. Whatever magic crap had transported them, had left him in a lot of pain. He hated travel by magic, unless it was his broom.
Draco had grumbled as his godfather shoved a pile of clothes at him and told him to get dressed. Harry had chuckled, watching the two of them, then of course Remus came in and did the same to him.
He hummed his agreement. He wondered just how much power the old fool had over Potter, and why he was afraid of losing it. He had always assumed Dumbledore’s fascination with the Boy That Lived was because he was a beacon for the light side, but it seemed he was missing some information.
The blonde studied him, “Who ever we told we could obliviate after.” The blonde pointed out. Harry groaned. That was a good point.
With his emotions all over the place he was on the brink of tears when he walked into the common room. He stopped short when he found his dad and Sirius hanging out in the otherwise empty common room. His dad was sitting cross legged on the floor a book in his lap. While his godfather was sprawled out on the couch behind him. He let out a relieved breath, if they were here then Remus was okay. They wouldn’t have come back here if Remus was hurt.  They must have heard him because both of the other teens looked up at him. Sirius had a goofy grin on his face and James gave him a happy grin, both fell away ad they took him in.
Then the sweet scent of plums filled his nose and Harry relaxed. The chamber fell away and he was back in the shack, Snape, Blaise, and Lucius stood in front of him all three a little pale, not that Harry cared at the moment. All he cared about was his mate behind him. He turned in Draco’s arms and buried his nose against the blonde’s neck. The smell of plums deepening. He breathed it in and let the calm safe feeling wash over him.
Percy however must have known it because he groaned, “Makes sense,” then he blushed when all of the others looked at him. Charlie watched as Percy swallowed, “Azeban are one of the 13 Descended families. They are tricksters. If I remember correctly, troublesome and mischievous but never dangerous. Not unless they, their families, or mates are threatened.”
The blonde relaxed a little, “Family vaults are accessible to those that can prove by magic and blood that they are allowed. I believe if done correctly I can gain access to my family vaults.” He sounded so smug, that Harry wanted to kick him.
As a fanfiction writer, I have a good number of followers and loyal readers. I’m hoping that some of you might be interested in my original works as well. I love writing and it would be a dream come true to turn this hobby into a career.
Then ice cold water spilled over the both of them and they broke apart.  Harry turned to glare at the other’s in the room. While Draco growled and went to lunge at his father, who was the only one with his wand out.
“Those are bindings.” The other teen reached out, he didn’t touch the spell work floating the air, but he didn’t seem to follow one single strand to see where it lead and then another. Harry watched him, “Can you break them?” He asked Igorth and Saomur.
He heard Snape snort, “You have not been on the other side of one of their pranks. It would be wise to apologize and plead ignorance.”
Thinking about the things he could and couldn’t change made him think about home. He wondered what his old friends were up too.  Where Ron and Hermione pretending to be worried about him? Was Ginny still trying to get Dean’s attention? Had Seamus or Neville blown up anymore calderon's in Snape's class? That one made him laugh. What about Remus? Or the twins? Where they still his friends? Or--
“Why not?” Harry asked looking at Malfoy, annoyed that the blonde spoke, because he wanted these spells gone. He hated the fact that someone had used magic against him. In fact he was starting to hate how someone was always trying to hurt or manipulate him. Why couldn’t people just leave him the hell alone.
“It appears the tooth was trying to break spells, that were already placed upon you. I believe, before we can place any glamour’s we will need to speak to Grimmhook. Follow me.” A bad feeling settled in Harry’s stomach as they left the room and returned to the one from before.
Then he did laugh because here he was stuck in a different time, with a supposed enemy. And yet that person was helping him, and the weirdest part, Harry was listening to him and believing him. He never once doubted any of the information the blonde shared and he was trusting his judgement on not breaking some of the spells.
Harry looked up, the tall student in front of him rang of familiarity. And it took his brain a moment to figure it out. “Yeah. Thank you.” He felt weird saying something nice to Snape. But the kid in front of him had helped him up and asked if he was okay. Something Snape in his time would never have done.
“Potter?” He heard Malfoy’s voice, it was gentler then he had ever heard, and the shock of that was enough to pull him back.
“You okay?” James asked, and Harry wanted to cry a little because he was already recognizing the voice.
"That's not all." He said lowering his voice. "The one, Moony liked him." He felt Sirius stiffen next to him, Lilly's eye's widened and James raised a brow. He sighed. "Not like that. He thought he was pack." He whispered the last word harshly. Like he was angry at the word and not just his wolf.
Question, the first chapter i switched back and for between Draco and Harry instead of waiting to start a new chapter to switch pov. I'm thinking about doing this again because I have somethings I want to do from different pov but they aren't long and it seems a waste to make them whole chapters when I can just jump back and forth. What do you guys think? Or how do you feel about it?
He stopped walking, his face full on turning red when he realized what part of the store they were now standing in.
But as the days passed, Severus could see even his old friend was starting to have doubts. He prayed that Draco was okay, and even if he wouldn’t admit it to another living soul, he prayed the same for Lilly’s son.
Lucius smirked, “I think our Dragon and his mate, are a dangerous duo. Draco is intelligent, strong, and cunning, Potter is stubborn, smart, and more importantly
“It…” He cleared his throat, “It wasn’t too bad. But I’m excited to be here.”  Again, there was a sour smell in the air and Remus tried not to react to it.
"I..." he opened his mouth a slow build of panic setting in. The front door's opened and in walked a wave of first years. He tracked the movement of the two taller boys that were hanging towards the back of the mass of smaller kids.
“Excuse me?” He asked, “Umm these don’t fit,” He said pulling out the small pile, “If you tell me where they go, I’ll put hem back.” He finished with a smile.
I honestly can’t Remember if Draco see’s the Room of Requirements in Order of the phoenix while working for Umbridge and since this takes place before book 6 (where he uses the room, I’m making it so that he hadn’t discovered it yet.
It didn’t take long for him to find Malfoy. The blonde was still in the library reading a book Harry didn’t recognize. Harry slipped behind the Slytherin and poked him in the shoulder.
“No.” Harry caught him off, “He hates me. He supports Voldemort.” He saw Malfoy’s hands tighten at the name. He didn’t trust Snape, though he was starting have some doubts about just how much the man supported Voldemort. After some of the things he learned about the people he had trusted, he started looking at other people in his life, and while the man was an arsehole, he had never hurt him. In fact he had saved his life a few times.
Before they could say more, there was a knock at the door. Causing both twins wince. They had forgotten who they had invited over today. George pulled out his wand and summoned all the bank documents. Then he ushered both his older brothers into his bed room.
“Yes.” Lupin said low, and Lucius could hear the growl buried beneath the word, “Dumbledore knows. We have been trying for years to get him to call an emergency hearing. But he kept giving reason on why the timing wasn’t right.” The man sighed, “Now I’m thinking it’s because if Sirius was cleared, he would get all rights to Harry and it seems Dumbledore doesn’t want that.”
“Azeban.” Fred said with a huge grin. Charlie tried to remember all the inheritance he studied when he came into his but that one didn’t sound familiar.
He found him sitting on the floor, pushed back into a far corner before the last row. The other teen was sitting with the book he found on his lap, staring at it blankly.
The goblin tilted his head in a slight bow, “One moment.” Then he turned and disappeared behind some large doors.
Harry winced when Draco coughed and doubled over, holding his stomach. Harry almost dropped his own bottle when he reached forward to help him. It only took a second for Draco to stop coughing and straighten back up.
Severus scoffed opening his eyes to glare at him. “You son is the mate of the boy-who-lived, whom our Lord wants dead. I know you, Luc, you’re loyal to the Dark, but not more so than to your son. Which means you have already started to plan? So, I ask again, what do we do now?”
“EVAN!” He heard Malfoy shout behind him. He laughed out loud and darted over the Gryffindor table, ignore the looks he got for his laugh or the ones that were sent towards the Slytherin as he stormed into the Hall.
He grabbed the cauldron and filled it halfway with water then placed it over the fire. The heat set to low, like the instructions said. And prayed he didn’t mess this up. Snape returned placing the ingredients on their table. This time he looked at Harry.
“What?” He almost looked up, tempted to see if the look on the other kid’s face matched the surprise in his voice.
He felt a shiver run down his spine. He hadn’t taken an order from Lucius in years, not since they were young, but his body still reacted. He returned the glare, stepping into the circle.
Fred wiped a tear from his cheek and turned to hand the letter to his brother, who in return looked stunned over the letter he was reading. When George finished, they exchanged letters and now he found himself reading over Lily’s Will.
Hermione stopped and actually seemed to think about her responds. “That’s not the point,” she finally settled on. “The article put Sirius back in the forefront of everyone's minds. He is going to be in ever more danger now.”
“Now go!” Charlie said, shoving him back towards the fireplace, “and George,” He looked at his brother an eyebrow raised, “You two be careful too.”
Sirius seemed to be arguing with Peter, who sat across from him. He sighed. The two always seemed to be fighting lately. He quietly slipped into the empty spot between Sirius and James, and felt his wolf relax. The scents of his friends hung heavy in the air and the smell of pack calmed his wolf. It also helped ground him. He sucked in a deep breath and let himself calm down. He knew thinking about things rationally was more likely to lead to answers then panicking. Sirius elbowed him in the ribs to get his attention.
He shook his head and wondered if Evan did that every night. Counting and making sure they were all there before he relaxed and went to bed himself. He also wondered what else Evan did to comfort himself, while he was stuck in the bizarre situation. Remus would have to keep an eye out, hopefully he would find something he could to do help. He wasn’t sure he could tell Harry that he knew the truth, but maybe he could still find a way to make things a little easier on him.
They had barely sat down before Lucius pulled out an envelope and handed it to Draco. The blonde gave his father and then Harry a confused look before he opened it. It took barely a second before Draco was out of his seat and was hugging his father and then Snape. Then just as fast he was lunging at Harry. The kiss was quick and surprising, Harry didn’t even have time to register it before Draco was pulling away.

"You think he's a wolf?" Peter asked from across the table. And Remus felt his stomach drop. That couldn't be it? Could it? Wouldn't his wolf feel territorial if another werewolf showed up.
“No need to apologize, Mister Potter.” Igorth said, “Though that was unexpected.” The goblin tilted his head and it was like his eyes focused in on Harry for the first time.
