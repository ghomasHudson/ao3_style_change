“Dangerous, that.” needled Draco.
With his heart beating way too fast he looked at it. Confusion hit him, it wasn’t one of the harder runes nor a new one. Surely Granger would know it? “It’s the discomfort rune,” he said, trying to not sound doubtful and even succeeding, considering that Granger sounded more frustrated than insulted when she answered, “Yeah I know that, but it just doesn’t make sense in the context of the paragraph.”
“Draco? Is that true?” asked McGonagall, compassion in her voice, despite the hard look on her features.
A sharp tug on his hair pulled him back into reality and forced him to look up again. Morris was still talking to him, slapping him across the face when Draco didn’t answer.
They had finished the main course and Draco was in high spirits. The food was excellent, Harry was surprisingly easy to talk to and on top of that easy on the eye. Against all expectations he really enjoyed himself.
Apparently it was Potter’s turn to be gobsmacked. “Like I said before, I don’t hate you.”
2. Anything admitted during the game stays within the game. And I mean that, there will be a modified lip-lock jinx cast before we start, stopping you from ever talking to someone outside of this circle about anything that happened in it.
Another moan: loud and clear, “YES please, please! yes…harder… please!”
and in the window he could see a wall filled with art, some black and white, some with colours. It finally clicked in his mind that he was looking at a muggle tattoo place and his heart raced.
Tickling the pear on the painting at the kitchen door, he made a mental note to thank Professor McGonagall once again.
Rolling his eyes — rather ineffective thing to do while invisible — Harry answered, “You know I can.” Thursdays were Ron and Hermione’s ‘couple time’ and it was also Harry’s and Draco’s most common date night. At least when Draco managed to sneak off.
“You don’t deserve to be punished, love. You deserve to be happy, you have suffered enough. We talked about it, remember?” Pansy urged gently, continuing at Draco’s small nod. “I agree with ‘Mione, you should tell McGonagall, it doesn’t have to be today or even tomorrow, but someday soon, yeah?”
“Oh shush. None of them fault me for trying to sell out Potter or ratting any of them out, none of the eighth years blame you for the war either. We were all just kids, we still are. Start with us, a small study group with max five people, a small way to get some human connection other than me. I’m not asking you to face every person in Hogwarts. Trust me that I wouldn’t invite you if I thought you would suffer from it. Plus, I’ll be there the whole time.
In the confinement of his bed, Harry didn’t even try to pretend not to know the constellation by heart. He knew it, just like he knew everything else about him, like he knew about his feelings for the blond.
After they left their classmates behind and entered the rarely used stairway leading to the seventh floor, Draco let his hand brush against Harry’s. Harry cast a nervous glance around before taking the offered hand. They ascended the stairs slowly, neither feeling any need to rush.
Dressed in only his pajamas, he slipped into the common room and dropped the gift into the chest.
ART-Break!
A cough interrupted his thoughts, Potter was actually looking at him now. Green eyes piercing right into Draco’s soul, or so it felt.
Confused Draco looked at her and then he realised that Pansy just gave him the game’s equivalent of a skip. Still he thought about the question for a moment.
Harry shrugged and turned back to cuddle closer to Draco once more, mumbling, “It was long overdue.” before hiding his face in Draco’s shirt once more. Cherishing the feeling of Harry in his arms, Draco relaxed into the couch.
“Okay” Draco whispered and quickly changed into pajama pants and t-shirt before slipping into bed next to Harry.
Reluctantly Harry laid his hand upon the dark blue wax cloth.
Draco let the shirt fall to the floor as his eyes raked over the beautiful body before him. Neither man moved for a moment, before Draco simply pushed Harry on top of the messy sheets. Draco quickly grabbed his own shirt and pulled it off, dropping it to the ground, before crawling up on the bed and straddling Harry. Even through their jeans he could feel Harry's erection as he ground down into it.
Pansy had been certain that telling Potter would have one of two outcomes: either Potter and his hero complex would help by  touching Draco every now and then or he would set Granger and everyone else with any research talent on it and have the problem solved within days. Either way, Draco would be helped and everything would be fine.
Draco.
Monday, November 30th 1998, evening:
The guilt inside of Draco rose and rose, nearly taking over his brain. He didn’t notice his fingernails digging into his palms or his body rocking back and forth on the hard wooden stool. He could just make out Morris’ voice, over the ringing in his ears, reminding him of his failures and crimes for the umpteenth time.
“Fine with me,” Potter said and pulled out his quill and parchment, “Ready when you are Professor Malfoy.” Potter joked and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco’s fingernails dug painfully into his thighs to stop him from cowering at the volume, and with a tremble in his voice he answered, “I don’t have one, Sir. I only have that one. Hawthorn with unicorn hair, 11 inches, it should be noted in my file that I only have that one.”
In the silence of the room he listened to Harry’s breathing and the finally slowing beat of his heart.
The doorstep. He couldn’t cross the doorstep. In his chest, his heart tried to escape his ribcage and he belatedly realised that he had stopped breathing. Hastily he inhaled.
Draco shook his head, “No, just… thinking. I’m ready.” He leaned over to press a soft kiss to Harry’s cheek and then whispered, “After you Professor Potter-Malfoy.”
“What is he doing here?”
When they got to the door of his flat, despite his nerves, Draco asked if Harry wanted to join him for some tea, Harry nodded and patiently waited for Draco to dig his keys out of his pockets and let them in.
“They were brilliant, my best ones yet.” His green eyes were sparkling with joy. “I spent Christmas with Ron and his family, they really know how to make it feel home-y, you know? Plus it was great to get to spend some time with him again.”
Some of the nervous energy left Draco. This was only another one of those ‘are you behaving’ talks he had to endure. At least McGonagall wouldn’t insult him the whole time through. Eyes downcast, he informed the Headmistress that he was faring rather well and that he was keeping up with all his coursework.
He could pinpoint the moment Pansy realised that he really wouldn’t explain the man in his lap, as her eyebrows went from questioning to angry. Nonetheless, she talked.
He barely noticed Hermione and Pansy joining him, too focussed on the fantasy world playing out right inside the pages in front of him. It took Pansy nudging him in the side repeatedly for him to snap out of it. Once he did, Hermione roped him into a discussion about the theory behind the charms they had covered on Friday.
Draco was anxious. Harry hadn’t been at breakfast and although Granger and Weasel didn’t look too concerned, he was worried as to why. Even though it was a Saturday, Harry was usually in the Great Hall by the time Draco would go up for breakfast, but not that day. Only listening to Pansy with half an ear, he sat on one of the leather couches in the common room and mused over reasons for Harry to miss it. He hadn’t mentioned anything on Thursday so it must have been something spontaneous, but he couldn’t ask. Weekends were always difficult in regards to random meetings and they had agreed to not meet this one in specific, in order to ease the suspicions of Pansy and Blaise.
“I’m gay,” his gaze was still focused on the food, the shoulders shaking.
“You should come to our study meeting on Thursday. I know Hannah would love to discuss the Herbology aspect of this assignment with you — She really has been hanging out with Neville a lot lately — in any case, we are pretty productive during these and it is nice to properly connect with people outside one's old gang.”
Considering that Draco only remembered the previous day until early lunch time, it was no wonder it had taken him a few hours to heal. He must have been unconscious for a few hours before Pansy had even found him. A hand squeezed his and Draco’s brain rushed back to the important matters: Harry knew.
his brain provided unhelpfully,  but it felt surprisingly good to finally talk about it.
It was silent for a moment before Malfoy took a deep breath, “It’s a habit I developed during the war, walking along the property line to… Dammit. I can’t do this sober.” Harry was confused, although he didn’t know whether it was because of Malfoy actually answering, Malfoy cursing or Malfoy implying… implying what? Implying that he would give Harry an honest answer to a very personal question if only he had some liquor in him?
Clearly not having expected them to cave so easily, Hermione’s eyes widened in surprise and moments later, she smiled brightly. Squealing slightly, she nearly vibrated in her seat. “I knew it! Oh Harry! I’m so happy for you.”
Harry thinks about the offer for approximately 5 seconds before he checks to see if he is alone in the locker room, and apparates home. He briefly considers getting changed into more formal clothes instead of his worn-out jeans and shirt but decides against it. It isn’t a date, just a casual drink. Right?
They moved against one another coaxing louder and louder moans out of the other and placing open mouthed kisses wherever they could reach.
“I wanted to thank you again. For… showing me the kitchens and for… listening I suppose.”
With the potions portion of the day dealt with, Draco found himself looking for excuses to continue talking to Harry. “How did you like your holidays?” he asked, feeling stupid. That feeling quickly disappeared when Harry’s face lit up.
“You’re going to pay for that.” he threatened but Pansy only laughed it off.
“I´m sorry! Kingsley kept me longer than I wanted and I only escaped by literally running off. And then it was running late or showing up in my uniform”
And so fall changed into winter and Draco continued looking forward to seeing Harry again. He was aware that he had a crush but he didn’t act on it. As far as he knew Harry wasn’t interested and coming onto him might only push him away; better to take what he could get and let the rest stay a fantasy in his head.
“Welcome to Starlight and Moonshine. What drinks may I offer you?”, she said, handing them both a drink menu.
and Draco remembered saying,
On the other side of his counter stood none other than the Boy-Wonder himself, Harry Potter.
. The moans rang loud in the otherwise silent living room and Draco had to concentrate not to come on the spot. He focussed all of his attention on stretching Harry, scissoring his fingers and reducing Harry into a quivering mess.
“If you could stand up for a moment”, Harry adressed him nervously. Confused, Draco got up. Now Harry had his wand out and summoned a picnic blanket. Then he transfigured their chairs into a bunch of pillows. Shaking hands laid the wand onto the small table and he sat down onto the blanket, motioning for Draco to do the same.
They were quiet while they cleaned the workstation and cauldron. Draco had bottled some of the potion for a later use and he was busy writing small labels for the bottles when Harry spoke up again.
“Times of war, Mr. Malfoy. And as far as I am aware you never had the actual intentions to kill someone, and especially never wished to be in a position where you had to.” Her gaze was stern and the posture as rigid as always, her hands clasped behind her back.
Should he apologize for his role in the war?
Snapping out of it, Harry continues to the mat, and  quickly finds his spot in the lineup — in the past months the course had grown to ten regular participants —  across from Malcolm and Malfoy and kneels. All through the customary greeting ceremony Harry wonders why the hell Malfoy is kneeling on the instructors side and why he was even in this dojo at all.
“Good. That’s... good.” Harry scratched his neck nervously.
The scraping of wooden chairs against the wooden floor pulled him from his thoughts and he looked up to see the rest of their study group clearing their table. A tempus revealed that it was time for dinner. Harry must have noticed too, because he too was packing his books and parchment away.
A few rounds later Draco found himself heading to his dorm. He was rather drunk and his social energy was drained. Dropping his uniform to the ground, he slid into bed in his boxers. His mind replayed his latest kiss with Blaise, and in his drunken state he realised how he missed being that close to someone.
Draco let out another snort at the noticeable effort to remain secretive. “Them, Pansy? Really? Don’t play that shit with me, you’re almost as gay as I am.” He hesitated a moment and then decided to continue anyway, “Or since when does Hermione go by they/them?”
“We’re planning a party for next week, before we all head home for Christmas.” Hermione explained, “I actually wanted your opinions on where to hold it. I think it would be nice to invite some of the 7th years and that would mean we can’t have the party here, like we usually do.”
“Robes are rather impractical in the snow. They scrape the ground and by the time I even reach the hills it basically acts like a snow plow.” Silence stretched between them again, both men sipping their tea. The discomfort led Harry to blurt out the first thing in his head once again, “Why do you walk the hills anyways?”
He must have been louder than he anticipated because within moments Potter was at his side, looking worried.
Slightly calmer, he exited the bathroom. Draco sat on the bed, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, “Morning Harry,” he yawned. Harry let out an awkward “Hi” and faced his trunk, putting his toiletries back.
They languidly kissed for a few moments before Harry waved his hand to clean them both of their mess and lay down next to Draco, pulling him close to his chest.
Draco quickly reassured her and promised that he would think about it. To his own surprise, the prospect of an evening together didn’t feel threatening. On the contrary, he was rather looking forward to it.
“Draco! You can’t let him get away with this!”
“Do you happen to know where the kitchen is Mr. Malfoy?” she suddenly asked, gaze pondering. Confused with the change of topic Draco shook his head. The professor hummed and then muttered as if in deep thoughts. “It’s a fairly open secret amongst the Gryffindors. I will have to show them to you. Next Tuesday after lessons would be good.”
Harry feels himself growing red and mumbles, “Getting choked apparently does, yeah.” and swiftly drains his glass. He’s far too sober for this type of conversation. A hum can be heard from the other side of the sofa.
Draco couldn’t help himself. “Honestly Potter. Cutting leaves you with uniform, cubic  pieces the size of your thumbnail - at least if not it’s not specified. Chopping leaves you with smaller pieces that don’t have to be as uniformly sized. Slicing leaves you with thin and long stripes. Besides, slicing is done with little pressure and more movement while chopping is more about pressure than the sawing motion.”
Malfoy scoffed at that, muttering something under his breath, but Harry could only make out the words, “Stupid idiot”. He mentally counted to ten before he continued.
His best friend noticed his unwillingness and continued, “I’ll make you a deal: if you promise to come on Thursday I promise to bring you food until then. This way you can maybe sleep for longer than just a few hours and you don’t need to face the rest of the school. And if you promise me to try to get better, I’ll bring you food after Thursday too. Deal?”
Draco said a shy “hello” to no one in specific and sat down at the small end of the table, next to Pansy and Hannah.
“What? Are we just gonna take a bunch of shots? Get drunk for the sake of it?” asked Harry.
Draco realized he was staring and cleared his throat. “Hello Potter. What brings you to my little shop?” he asked, trying to be his usual customer service self.
Reassured, Draco sunk back into her embrace, he didn’t have the mental strength to deal with the Great Hall on top of everything else. Still he felt guilty. He had seen the pride in Pansy’s eyes whenever he had joined her for meals in the Great Hall and completely skipping dinner just felt like giving up.
“If there is still time, get back to your knees, face each other again and start anew. I will end the randori with the commando
Harry takes a step back and looking Draco in the eye, brings his hands to the button of his jeans, toying with it, before moving to remove his shoes and socks, somehow making even that act impossibly sexy —  his eyes never once leaving Draco’s face.
Two paragraphs into the essay Malfoy cleared his throat. “While I understand how my shields may hinder the process I am not entirely sure how one achieves ‘making a memory present’.” Sensing a longer explanation incoming, Harry capped his inkwell and sat down in front of Malfoy.
As for topics covered this time: mental breakdown, needles, tattoos and piercings, coming out, and verbal attacks/insults.
“You never said if you can make it.” Draco eventually mentioned.
Without breaking their kiss or slowing down, Draco places his hand on Harry’s neck again and slowly chokes him, applying only a little bit of pressure. Harry groans, meeting Draco’s thrusts with his own and presses his neck further into Draco’s hand. Thankfully Draco gets the message and increases the pressure on his neck. Harry can hear his heartbeat inside his head and every nerve is on high alert, he feels Draco push into him with a new intensity and just as he is nearing his orgams, Draco loosens the choke again and slows down, fucking into him almost sweetly.
Breakfast began at 6:30 just like every other day, but on the weekends it was also available until ten so most students didn’t actually get up before 9, if they didn’t absolutely have to. With Hermione’s and Pansy’s plan actually banking on that fact came the flaw that they had to indeed get up at sometime close to six. Bloody hell. Breakfast in the Great Hall was just more trouble than it was worth. The arrangement with Pansy worked after all.
The ringing was still there when Draco stumbled out of the headmistress’ floo an hour later, only seemingly composed. Fortunately, the office was empty. With a racing heart and hectic breaths he left, each of Morris’ insults still reverberating in his head.
Once the door closed behind Blaise, Pansy turned back to Draco.
Draco put on his black muggle jeans and his favourite dark blue jumper. It was knitted with softening and warming charms interlaced in it and it was slightly big on him, the sleeves falling down to his fingertips. For a moment he thought about doing something with his hair, but in the end he just brushed it, letting it frame his face.
there is only a slight
The wand pointed at Lisa next and Neville dared her to read out the last letter she had received. She took a shot and then leaned forward to spin the wand. It landed on Potter.
Harry exhaled in relief the moment he appeared in the Scottish countryside. The air was cold and crisp, and there was a thin layer of snow covering the ground and trees. The quiet stood in such a contrast to the bustling he had just left behind that it took him a moment to understand that he was finally here. It was his first vacation since he had become a full auror almost two years ago, his first vacation alone.
Draco was glad that they didn’t want to use their common room, that way he had somewhere to flee to that wasn’t his dorm.
Immediately awake, Harry realized that not only was he on Malfoys side of the bed, but also that Malfoy was cuddling him from behind. Hastily, Harry scrambled to his still damp side of the bed, and turned off his alarm. Glad to be away from Malfoy, Harry left the room quickly before the Slytherin could fully wake up.
“I also need to apologise,” Harry said softly into Draco’s hair, “I ....didn’t know what the spell did... when I used it, which makes it all the worse. I can’t tell you how sorry I am for that.”
“Granger? I doubt she wants me to go anywhere near her let alone sit down to have a chat with her!” he hissed. He didn’t miss the triumphant smirk playing across Pansy’s face when she answered, “I’ve actually already talked to her about that and she would appreciate your help.”
Evening came faster than Harry wanted it to and so he reluctantly made his way to his and Malfoy’s room. He was dead tired.
The third time Harry nears the edge he pleads with Draco — begs him — to let him come,  despite his voice coming out strangled and despite the effort it takes him to form words with the hand around his throat. Draco is slamming into him, fucking him hard and fast, and he releases the choke for a second, letting Harry’s head clear without slowing down, only to dig his finger tips into Harry’s pulse point seconds later, cutting the blood flow off completely. “Come for me love.” he orders and Harry tips over his cock untouched, and he is drowning in the lake of lust and haziness.
Potter had pulled himself off the floor too and settled himself onto the worn maroon couch furthest from the fireplace. A glance back showed Draco that the room had picked up on his fear of being trapped in it, as the door didn’t close after them. Instead there was the shimmer of wards passing over the opening which meant no one outside the room would hear or see them.
Harry was about to protest that Malfoy could move himself, when Susan Bones cleared her throat behind him. “Sorry, I am supposed to partner with Weasley, could you move?” With a resigned groan Harry grabbed his bag and went to Malfoy. Harry chose the stool furthest from Malfoy but realized shortly after that he needed to at least be able to reach his hand. “This is stupid” he grumbled as he scooted his chair closer until he was within an arms length.
She had a point. They sat in silence for a few moments before Neville spoke up, “What about the Room of Requirement? That way we control who comes and Filch won’t find us.”
Am I posting this in the wee hours of the morning, because TECHNICALLY it is monday and therefore posting day? Hell yes I am. I am super excited to put this out there.
It was most definitely the alcohols fault that Harry mumbled, “Not the one I’d like to ride” before taking his shot. He didn’t even know where that had come from. Grey eyes meet green ones, shock written in both of them. A blush crept its way up Harry’s neck and Draco raised an eyebrow but thankfully remained silent, until…
Christmas had always been a small affair within the private rooms of the Manor. Of course there had been Yule balls hosted in years past, but those had almost always been out of propriety rather than actual holiday spirit. There had been some presents but that had been it. No big meals, no traditions. It was after all a muggle holiday.
“Draco, you could have said something. You know I'm here for you, darling. Please, don’t shut me out…” Pansy tried.
The words wash over Harry with excitement and clearance all at once. He sobers up from his drowsy, lust-riddled brain and sits up straighter. “Okay, what do you want to talk about?”
“So…. Choking?”
Draco and Gemma remained on the sofas in the sitting area, but before their silence could turn awkward, Gemma turned to face him properly.
Harry agreed so they started walking, Draco leading the way.
Filled with pride he set to work preheating the oven, preparing doughs, and mixing batters.
. Forcing himself not to flinch at the realisation he focussed on the feeling of the Gryffindor in his arms. It felt… right.
McGonagall sat her teacup down and folded her hands. “That is perfectly understandable, Mister Malfoy. Most teenagers have to face the values they have been taught at one point, even if only to accept them as their own. You happen to have had those values forcefully reevaluated for you by others, which complicates the process a bit. But it is a process. Take the time to find your own values.”
Or should he demand an apology for slicing him open and scarring him?
McGonagall noticed his glance and dismissed him finally.
The day so far has been rather hectic for a thursday. Only halfway through did he realize that the muggles had a school holiday and with the rather nice weather out, loads of them went to the park nearby to entertain their kids.
Draco closes his fingers around his neck again and within seconds Harry is close to the edge again, moaning hoarsely and angling his hips to let Draco deeper into him. Just before Harry can tip over though, Draco stops his thrusts and releases the choke — and while the release of the choke itself feels orgasmic, Harry refrains from coming.
Without taking the cloak off, Harry leaned against him, his head resting on Draco’s shoulder. “I know.”
So Draco had dreaded his mother’s reaction, but the soft question that rang with care behind it hadn’t been what he had imagined. Disapproval or admonishment, yes, those he had prepared for. But care? No.
The light reflecting off of her ear caused him to look at her properly. “Does it hurt?” he asked without thinking.
Which is why Draco now found himself sitting in his favourite armchair, staring at the tip of the wand pointing at him. Susan Bones had spun after having done an impressive impression of Severus Snape. Chancing it, Draco picked truth.
A moan pulled him out of his sleep the next morning. So faint that Harry was convinced he had imagined it, thinking it could have been his dream, but before he could recall what exactly he had been dreaming about the moan sounded again, louder this time. And while the first one had been somewhat ambiguous, this one was definitely lascivious.
The same panic reared up in him again and Draco made a mental note to look into wandless shield charms. Still he didn’t so much as flinch as Morris carelessly tossed his wand onto his desk.
“Don’t worry, Chris accidentally hit his nose. He will be fine, but it wouldn’t do to ruin the mats now, would it?” Malcolm says with a chuckle and asks them to switch partners again to start a new
“Where?”
than him. He never had been good at being second best. How was he supposed to ever salvage their relationship?
Grabbing all 10 of them, he set his sights on decorating the dragons as lifelike as possible. With the mermaids, pixies and pegasi he just went for artistic rather than realistic, those were ultimately only fairytales to the muggles.
“Is there a problem regarding my sexuality?” he simply asked, after almost 5 minutes of uncomfortable silence. The shocked expression on Potter’s face was almost worth the awkwardness of the situation.
“I know Draco. I know you couldn’t get out. I- I guess I forgive you.”
Unceremoniously, Malfoy let go of Harry’s wrist, smirking at the smack of it hitting the table.
Pulling his mind back from the unpleasant route his thoughts were taking, Draco became aware of his surroundings again. The pair of them were still sitting on the floor where Draco had crumpled.
“Why did you do it then? Save me I mean. Why risk yourself?” As if Draco didn’t know that Potter had saved him out of compulsion. As if Potter had had a choice in that.
Their discussion was interrupted however by a doubtful, “What do you think Harry? Draco?” from Hermione.
*****
“Yeah. Sirius left it to me and I started renovating it last summer, but there are still some rooms left. And I still don’t have a solution for the tapestry in the hallway.”
He took a closer look at the passage and saw what she meant, he had been stuck at that paragraph for a long time too.
Despite knowing who was standing at their table, Draco’s head shot up and he stared straight into Potter’s face. Hermione scooted closer to Draco, motioning for him to scoot closer to Pansy in turn and summoned another chair.
and what do you do then?”
Gasps and a general agitation pulled him from his thoughts. Most of the heads in the relatively crowded common room were facing towards the entrance and when Draco followed their gazes, he realised why. There in the archway stood Harry, still wearing his plaid pyjama bottoms and the oversized shirt he slept in and looking absolutely unbothered and unaware of all the people staring at him. The green eyes met his and Harry made his way through to where Draco was sitting.
A reassuring smile appeared on McGonagall's face. “I am glad that your friends are trying to help you. Should you ever want professional help though, I am more than willing to organize a meeting with a mind healer for you.”
Judging from the guilty look on Harry’s face, he hadn’t. In an effort to reassure him, Draco said “It’s not that bad. But you know I am aiming for a potions mastery and even without my reputation making it worse, most Potions Masters expect top marks.”
“That’s not what I meant! You carried yourself with confidence again, you looked ambitious again, rather than just silently suffering. There was a spark in you. I missed seeing you like that.” Pansy sounded wistful.
He shook the thought out of his head, he really didn’t have the time for a wank now, better not to think about his dream Adonis for now.
“It wasn’t me! Ginny dared him to do it, although none of us expected to get that much of a show out of it.” Pansy justified and Draco realised he was screwed. If the mischievous glint had nothing to do with starting the situation then Pansy had figured out why Draco had allowed it in the first place.
At half past 8 the cookies had finished baking and were laying out to cool. Grabbing his thermos and one still warm swedish short snout that had sadly suffered the loss of one of its wings, he sat down for a short break.
His mind healer had taught him different meditation techniques to calm him, to let him focus or to help him fall asleep. Harry slipped into the familiar breathing pattern with ease and sleep soon found him while still sitting against the headboard.
Having been on the edge of coming ever since he had seated himself onto Draco’s cock, Harry only tugged himself a few times before he came with a guttural moan all over Draco’s chest.
After Blaise, or the fact that you never shut up about a certain speckled git. You literally talked about nothing but Potter for years, so Yes Draco, I'm very aware your gay and glad you finally realized it yourself.
Potter was munching on the last cookie when they stopped the session two hours later.
A single tear fell down his cheek as Draco stood to hug Narcissa. Her confession was much more than a simple apology to him. It meant that she chose him over his father, him over herself even, and Draco had rarely felt this close to her.
Next chapter should be up by monday evening at the latest
(See the end of the chapter for
It had been a shock to realise how fundamentally his opinion of his father had changed and the comparison still hurt.
Memory-Pansy said in his mind and Draco corrected his assessment. He wasn’t a coward. He was trying.
Before David could turn away, Draco added, “Put it on my tab. I’ll come by next week anyways, I still owe you some of my cherry pie.” The last part was a lie, but he knew David would want details.
He smiled fondly. Pansy really was a great friend.
“Smart enough to explain this to me?” Harry challenged and pointed to the text passage he was having problems with. A challenge proved to be the right approach as Draco looked up, squinting at Harry before skimming over the section.
A tentative hand on his arm ripped Draco out of his discussion with Hermione, causing him to flinch slightly. Pansy smiled apologetically and asked if he had a moment, shooting a sharp glance at Hermione. Confused, Draco signalled her to go ahead. With another glance at Hermione, Pansy began, “So, I know Saturday was a bit of a… well bad idea in the end, but up until that point I thought it went rather well.”
Harry wanted to reassure him, flee from the awkward conversation but Malfoy beat him to an answer. “Please, you wouldn’t come out like this if nothing had happened last night. Just say what you have against me and what you want.”
There was a big post on the eighth year common room board:
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
(See the end of the chapter for
“Let me at least get Hermione to look over it? She must know some diagnostic charms”. Pansy all but pleaded with him. Draco relented.
, he told himself.
It was a rather peculiar problem to say the least. With Hogwarts being badly damaged during the final battle — just months before the new school year started, and consequently, Harry’s eighth year — there had been constant reconstructing by a team of witches and wizards who worked on fixing damaged hallways, classrooms and most importantly: the wards.
Despite the comment, Malfoy sat on the bed fully clothed and appeared to be reading.
I'm sorry?
As he was still only clad in pajamas, he headed up the stairs to his room and knocked before entering. He was hoping that Malfoy was still there and hadn’t already run off like he did yesterday.
(Or in the words of the most wonderful beta Monika: "AJ, you're projecting again")
Finally done with cleaning he slipped into his warm winter coat, grabbed his backpack, checked the bakery one last time before he was out the door and locking it behind him.
“Now for the first falling practice, start in half a kneel and bring the lower shoulder towards the ground.”
‘Potter,’ Harry’s brain provided, ‘I liked
“No unsanctioned spells, no complaints from the Headmistress. How utterly obedient. I’d say following orders seems to be something you’re good at, but I don’t believe you. Where is your second wand? Where?” The original hissing had turned into yelling.
“Guess I’ll be blind throughout dinner tonight then.” Draco snarled sarcastically but took the clue. They would both be missed if they spent much longer in the little alcove.
The train would be leaving in an hour and Draco still wasn’t dressed or packed. The latter simply because he kept pulling clothes out of his trunk to consider them only to then chuck them back in, deeming them unfitting. He had been trying to get dressed for the better part of an hour and every single outfit felt wrong.
They had a brief chat about what Potter did for work, in which Draco learned that the Saviour had actually quit the Aurors years ago and now taught intercultural classes for wizards and witches. Meaning he taught muggle borns about wizarding customs and wizarding folx about muggle customs. Draco thought it rather fascinating to see Potter get so passionate about his work.
Harry automatically reached his arm up and cupped Draco’s face. He leaned forward and, before his brain could catch up with him, gently placed his lips on Draco’s. A shocked mewl escaped Draco’s throat before Harry felt the others' lips softening and moving against his, kissing him back.
Harry nodded apologetically. “Yeah. I know that sucks but once people know it is only a matter of time before the press knows and I am just not ready for that.”
Friday evening saw Harry as a bundle of nerves. He had spent the day replaying the way Draco had looked at him during potions as well as fantasizing about kissing him. Harry was pretty sure Draco couldn’t have heard him or known what he smelt in potions class, and so Harry had settled on ignoring the whole matter for the duration of the Patronus lesson. He would figure something out over the weekend.
That night, Draco thought about warm lips that tasted of Firewhiskey, green eyes that sparkled with joy and the weight of a head on his shoulder.
“Uhm. I noticed you freaking out just now and I can imagine why. So… would you maybe want to head there before and just… deal with stuff? I told Hermione I would check to see if it still works anyways, and that might be a good chance for us to… actually talk?”
Raising an eyebrow, Draco turned to her. “It’s ‘Mione now, is it?”
‘Now for the exciting part!’ he thought as he braced himself for the time consuming task of decorating the cookies. The piping bags were one of the few magical things about his bakery. He had multiple for the different colours and any icing inside of them would always have the perfect consistency and they weren’t nearly as messy as muggle piping bags. They cleaned themselves on command and they even had adjustable piping tips that could be changed with a simple spell.
Moments after, Harry realises how much contact there actually is. He is basically straddling Malfoy; chest pressed together, his arms holding Malfoys arms close to his upper body. Sensing his apprehension, Malfoy worms his way sideways, lodging one leg free from in between Harry’s, grabbing his belt and switching their positions. Before he really knows what happened, Harry is lying on his back with Malfoy putting his weight onto his ribcage, effectively keeping him from sitting up, but keeping Harry’s legs free.
The ‘problem’ had made itself known around Halloween, when the weather was positively chilly. The charm work inside the castle walls had apparently been affected more than originally presumed, leaving many classrooms without weather protection. Like a net unraveling, the failing temperature charms were seeping into other parts of the castle and by the beginning of December not one common room was left unaffected and McGonnagall had had enough.
After giving the password to the stone guard Draco stepped onto the winding staircase, suddenly dreading the meeting. With each centimeter closer to the door, his mind was less able to ignore his nerves and slowly his giddiness from the previous night was taken over by unease.
“Hngghh. Draco! Please! I- ahh. Fuck me. Please!” Harry begs once they break the kiss and Draco can’t resist any longer. Without pulling his wand out of his bun, he vanishes his remaining clothes as well as the ropes restraining Harry and pulls his fingers out of Harry. With his newly free hands, Harry pulls Draco into another heated kiss, but pushes him away seconds later, “Fuck me, please! I need you inside me!” he urges and Draco complies, lubing up his own cock swiftly before positioning himself at Harry’s entrance.
*~~~*
All in all not a lot of space, but Harry loved it. The furniture looked homely and the faint smell of firewood was good enough to be made into a scented candle. Harry unpacked his bag and settled into the overstuffed armchair next to the fireplace, book in hand, determined to finally relax.
Draco swallowed and went into the boys dorm, searching for his note.
My lovely, wonderful, fantastic beta Monika made some snarky comments while reading through this the first time and I am honestly living for them. Check out the end for it.
When Draco didn’t verbally react to her statement, she went on. “There is a reason why your parole is set the way it is, why Narcissa merely has house arrest even though your father will spend the rest of his life in Azkaban. The Wizengamot believes, as do I, that you will be a functional member of our society given the chance to actually be yourself. And given what I have seen of you in the last two months I have no doubt about it. You have already changed into a person of your own, visibly resenting the ideals your father has forced upon you. This will only strengthen over time.”
Harry returned with his potions book pressed between his elbow and ribs, carrying two mugs of steaming tea. When he placed one in front of Draco, the blond looked up, startled. Harry saw confusion hush over the face and offered the obvious explanation, “I made tea: no milk, one and a half sugars.”
“Urgh. Fine. I’ll play. But you cast on me. No one else.” It had always been useless to go against Pansy when she wanted something. At least for him. With a small squeal Pansy dragged him to the quickly forming circle on the assumed dancefloor. Apart from the usual 8th year party group, there were only Ginny, Luna and one of the younger Ravenclaws present.
At the time of publishing, Mr. Potter was unavailable for comment.
“So, I thought we could begin with potion bases and maybe even start on the effects of temperature and stirring while brewing today? We can focus on the assignments on Thursday’s in case any of the others want to discuss that as well, and then we can do some more revision on Friday’s. Maybe after the Christmas holidays we can even start on some practical brewing.” Despite his mask, his explanation was rushed and Draco had to remind himself that he needed to breathe. His heart was pounding in his chest, even though he theoretically knew that there was no reason to be nervous.
“Pardon?” Draco asked, not really following.
Draco shot her a grateful smile and nodded, “Yes please. I think I managed to translate the first five sentences but I am not really sure of the fourth one. After that I am lost as well.” They got to work.
He was hit with a wave of the scent of his favourite broom polish, parchment, something that he could only describe as dusty and cologne. A very expensive, exquisitely balanced cologne, he recognized from somewhere.
“Stop that. You know I don’t care. I only mentioned it so it wouldn’t come as too much of a surprise if it takes me a while to get them off my back again.”
“Once?” he chuckled dryly. “I bullied people, for YEARS. I joined a fucking hate cult.” All of his wrongdoings flashed through his mind, his heart clenching at the reminders. He looked back up again, straight into Potter’s face, “I nearly cursed you, I let Death Eaters into the school, I almost killed Dumbledore.” His voice dropped into a harsh whisper, “I tortured, and stood by doing NOTHING while others were killed. So tell me Potter, how was that just once?” Draco sneers at him. His chest rose and fell in quick succession, adrenaline pumping through him.
As Pansy had promised, Hermione brought them some food and Draco invited her to stay, which she gladly did. Sitting on the chair in front of Draco’s bed, while Draco and Pansy ate, she observed Draco carefully. There was a furrow in between her brows, which Draco didn’t notice.
“It’s okay, we can start small with a late breakfast tomorrow.” she soothed, seeming to feel Draco’s inner conflict. “I already told ‘Mione to bring us some food if we’re not at dinner. One bad day doesn’t mean you failed.”
Harry was late. Who is late to a first date?
“So,” he forced out still panting, “this guy you like.”
Discussing his translation with Hermione was actually a good idea, and if Draco was honest he had missed studying with her too. “Sure” he allowed. Together they hurried up into the castle.
After they had left, Draco’s day continued as normal. When he had closed up for the day and started cleaning he couldn’t reign his mind in anymore. The resemblance between Potter and the man in his dream was disturbing. He couldn’t deny it: Potter was attractive and coincidentally exactly Draco’s type. He could only hope that Potter would return.
The feeling of the sobriety charm hit him like a truck.
“Thank merlin!” whispered Draco, cherishing the feeling of Harry in his arms and hugging him tight.

So with the pull making itself apparent, so soon after his last run-in with Potter, Draco was worried.
“Can I please kiss you?” Harry whispered. His question was met with a slow nod from the still shocked man in front of him, and Harry closed the distance. Draco’s lips were impossibly soft and warm against his own. Sparks appeared behind Harry’s closed eyelids and he felt warmth surge through every fibre of his being.
Rage reared within Draco and he desperately tried to quell it, his anger wouldn’t help right now, it was all in the past. He took a deep breath to steady himself and then admitted in a small voice, “If I did something wrong as a kid, father would send stinging hexes at me.” He wanted to show Potter how much he appreciated that he opened himself up to him, that he understood.
Draco carefully made his way to the eighth year common room.
He had to admit that he did look a lot like his father had years ago.
“Hey, you want a cuppa?” he offered and took the absent “huh? mmh” as an affirmation.
Not wanting to be outdone, Draco  slipped his hands under Harry's shirt, letting them roam over the warm skin and feeling the toned body he had been fantasizing about. It felt even better than he imagined. He let his hands slowly glide up until he found his goal, and teasingly began circling his thumb around Harry’s nipple. Harry’s hips twitched forward as he let out a long deep moan. Harry pressed his body into Draco’s, somehow pinning him further against the door, and brought their groins together with a brilliant thrust.
“That's why you’ve been avoiding me??” Pansy sounded outraged. Swiftly she turned him around. “Draco, I want to be your friend, not your bloody lover or wife!” Her eyes showed how hurt she was by his distance. Merlin, how he'd missed her in the last weeks.
It took him a week to come up with an idea but when he did, he nearly cursed himself for not thinking of it earlier. When he was little, his parents had shown him pictures to teach him about the pureblood families and there had been a few pictures of the Potters. Hoping he remembered correctly, Draco pulled out some parchment and crafted a letter to his mother.
But since starting back at Hogwarts, Draco was allowed to travel within Britain as long as he reported back for his parole meetings. Unfortunately, Narcissa was still on house arrest for the next year and a half, which made her suggestion of taking Draco somewhere impossible.
It took Draco a moment to understand that Harry was talking about the bathroom incident in sixth year. Draco gently put his hands on Harry’s arms to push him back so he could see his face, “I threw an unforgivable your way that day. I deserve worse than just a handful of scars for that.”
That seemed to appease Malfoy as he picked up the fork again and resumed eating. Harry was about to get up and leave again, when Malfoy spoke up.
He took a deep breath.
“Still. I should have thought of it. I’m sorry for bitching about it,” Harry conceded.
“What gives us the honour of your company today Potter?” She asked cheerily.
Draco learned that Harry liked his coffee bitter and his dessert sweet, that he was excited about starting a new class in January, and had even invited Draco to join him “as a teacher of course”, saying that Draco probably knew more about wizarding customs than him, even after all these years.
“Never have I ever been good at potions.” he slurred and watched Draco elegantly tip the shot glass back for the upteenth time. The other had a twinkle in his eyes when he in turn said “Never have I ever ridden a dragon.”
“Draco, I’ve been studying with her for weeks now. We’ve spent so much time together, I could probably start calling her a friend.” her tone was as dismissive as always. “So? Will you help us?”
“I doubt that the way most of the other years treat you helps with that.” McGonagall said in acknowledgement. And Draco was surprisingly glad. Glad that the headmistress didn’t look at him in pity, didn’t say how sorry she was or that it would be okay. Then he registered what she had said and gaped at her. She knew.
The sudden return of the focus to himself shocked Draco. He had listened attentively, soaking up the knowledge.
“You said you had to kiss me.” Draco realised once he had half his brain back.
Sighing deeply, Draco pulled his eyes away from his notes and gave Harry a quick kiss. They joined Pansy and Hermione at the common room entrance and together they left for the Great Hall.
Harry stood around for a moment before awkwardly settling onto the rug in front of the bed.
Draco teaches Potions and Harry has (another) sexuality crisis.
“No wonder you were so spooked!” Another laugh. “Well, surprise, I think you're fit.” Draco admitted, offering his hand to Harry, who took it. Instead of continuing their way back though, he pulled Draco closer.
As promised, McGonagall’s office was empty when Draco stumbled through the floo, wincing when he needed to catch himself in order not to fall. The muscles in his abdomen protested their use. At least he had stopped crying.
An hour later Harry was stuck. He knew why he had avoided doing the potions work, who cared whether he chopped, ground or finely sliced the ingredients? In the end the stuff would be in small pieces and mixed into a bunch of other stuff. But apparently that was not how potions worked and now he had to explain exactly why that. Bloody fantastic.
Mr. Potter felt it necessary to emphasize once again, that his sexuality is independent from his current partner and that he would appreciate it if adoring fans would not harass his boyfriend with angry letters.
Ron won all of them, since Harry was busy watching Malfoy — again.
“We’re still meeting Monday for theory lessons, right?” asked Harry as he charmed the cauldron clean. Draco only nodded, too focussed on keeping his body from reaching out to touch Harry.
to move, to meet Harry’s downwards motion with a thrust of his own.
“I consent.” Blaise said and Draco lifted himself out of his armchair. The few steps towards Blaise he reminded himself that he was doing this for Potter, that he owed Potter his life. He reached the couch and expected Blaise to stand up and meet him.
Mere minutes later Harry was grinding against Draco, groaning and sending shivers up his spine. As Draco pulled Harry’s jumper up over his head, Harry stilled and concentrated briefly. Seconds later they were naked and Draco suppressed a moan at the blatant display of wandless magic. He captured the other’s lips again and let his hands wander over the bare skin of Harry, pulling him closer still. Their cocks rubbed against each other leaving them both panting.
Draco had taken his chance in Potions only three days after his black-out. He had been sitting behind Harry for the whole term now and it finally paid off. Only 20 minutes into them brewing a topical anaesthetic for minor cuts and bruises (apparently the eighth years were trusted enough to replenish the hospital wing), Draco overheard him complain to Weasley how their potion was supposed to be blue by now. A quick glance into their cauldron and Draco had known what they had done wrong.
With a jolt Harry realised that Malfoy was scared, likely scared about what Harry might have heard.
“Well then let’s plan our sessions. We can use the study group time for theory although we should maybe add another afternoon to that. And then Friday evenings we could do some practical stuff every now and then.” His mind was already racing to where they could brew.
Draco huffed at that and muttered, “ I didn’t know whether it was you at first and I didn’t LET you steal my wand.”
Draco looked up, he was nearly finished with the assignment when the disgusted insult made him look up. A few tables over a group of Gryffindor 5th years had finally registered his presence. Draco recognised them immediately, they had threatened him on multiple occasions, taunting him with the knowledge that Draco wasn’t allowed to do any offensive or defensive magic outside of the classrooms. Draco had stopped going anywhere partly due to them.
A doubtful sneer arranged itself on Morris´ face upon the affirmation. While writing something into Draco’s file, he muttered to himself, “How could Death Eater scum like him show good behaviour? Do they even realize that there's more to good behaviour than just
“But I still don´t know why you did it. This is far too elaborate to be a prank and -” the git had the audacity to laugh. His face coming nearer.
“I think that’s enough for today.” he croaked, vanishing the potion with another flick of his wand. Harry nodded gratefully and moved to put the remaining ingredients back. Draco still stood in front of the cauldron, unmoving.
Instantly Harry blushed and hastily backpedalled. “I mean, only if you want. I just thought- You didn’t seem to mind- I didn’t- I- Forget it.” By the time his stuttering came to a halt, he was beet red.
Instead of listening to Draco, Harry pulled him closer by the hips, pressing their torsos flat together and claiming his lips in another bruising kiss. The intensity led Draco to see stars, and when Harry began thrusting his hips slightly so that he was grinding against him, he moaned. Forgetting all about his previous worries, Draco moved his hips to match Harry’s and hungrily captured any moans escaping the other’s lips with his own.
And Draco did remember sitting in the common room during their first potions tutoring session, and Potter hesitantly asking,
His inattention shows the moment he tries to imitate the hold on Chris. He gets the first steps easily but his hold doesn’t choke Chris in the slightest. Chris is just as lost as Harry is, the technique too new for him to correct Harry, and Malfoy notices.
“Your fucking parole supervisor. It was him who beat you, wasn’t it?”
carved artistically into the bark.
Once again, Potter called after Draco when he left class. He was on his way back to the castle, hurrying through the cold. After the warmth of the greenhouse, the windy grounds felt even colder than normal. Reluctantly, Draco slowed his steps to let Potter catch up with him.
Harry was again sitting in the kitchen, enjoying a very late breakfast, when he saw Malfoy walking past again. The telltale white of his hair contrasted against the dark line of trees behind him. Like the day before he wore no jacket, the sleeves of his shirt were pushed to his elbows but unlike the day before, Malfoy was walking a path further away from the cottage. From his position at the window Harry tried but couldn’t make out the expression on Malfoy’s face when the blond momentarily turned towards his general direction.
Harry’s reply was grumbled, but Draco had spent enough mornings with him to understand it.
“Shh. Have to kiss you.” His words were slurred and Draco figured that he must have continued drinking, even after their previous game had ended.
Another big grin spread across Harry’s face. “Of course! I just- Yes.” He laughed and Draco found himself joining in.
“I… I’ll think about it. Thank you.” he replied, not looking at Granger.. A party seemed impossible. Too many people, especially too many people with good reasons to hate him.
He didn’t have to return to Morris.
Startled, he looked down when the sofa dipped, just in time to see Harry straddle his lap.
He was about to snap at the dark haired in front of him when he saw a small boy clutching at Potter’s hand, staring at his cookie display in awe. It startled him and he let his eyes wander across the sight in front of him again. Potter looked good, he realized with a shock. His hair no longer looked like a birds nest but rather artistically dishevelled with the few locks escaping his bun. His clothes looked as though they actually fit him and showed his figure off rather nicely. Coming to think of it, he looked somewhat familiar, brown skin, dark hair, fit body… Almost like the adonis….
“Draco. I nearly killed you in sixth year.”
“Do you mean this?” Harry repeated himself and basically shoved the dark blue parchment into Draco’s face. The Slytherin’s eyes skimmed the page and a moment later his eyes widened and his face went pale. That was all the confirmation Harry needed. He let his hand clutching the letter fall to his side, only to raise his free hand and reach towards Draco’s face.
“So I know you’re normally more of a salted potatoes and veggies person for dinner, but sometimes you take the rice with the spring onions and paprika as well, so I got you both. There’s also enough pudding to function as a whole meal, just in case the session went that bad. Oh, and one of the older elves insisted that I take some of those chocolate and pear muffins?”
“Draco’s lodge”
Almost content, Draco headed towards the closest hairstylist. He had had to take off the hat in order for Leah to pierce him, and after she had finally stopped laughing enough to listen, he had explained his original reason for heading into town. Still chuckling slightly, she had explained the way, reminding him to be careful with his ears.
The once familiar walk from their rooms to the Great Hall felt strange and unknown when walking it hand in hand and as Professors no less. So much so that Draco paused shortly before the doors to the Great Hall so that he could catalogue his feelings to later dissect them with Gemma.
It was clear that he thought Draco personally at fault for the family members he had lost in the final battle. The blonde couldn't blame him. It
Harry nearly toppled off the bed at hearing his name. He had to get out, away from Malfoy and his forsaken moaning. Merlin.
“Merlin and Morgana. That was fucking fantastic.” Harry admits some time later, turning to look at Draco. The Slytherin agrees and pulls Harry closer to kiss him. They kiss languidly for some time before pulling apart and Draco’s gaze drops onto Harry’s neck again, eliciting a slight chuckle. At Harry’s questioning look he says “I did warn you that I like marks, right? and conjures a mirror.
“Mr. Malfoy, if you would please stay behind for a moment?” The heavy Scottish accent of  Professor McGonagall rang loudly through the silent classroom and then there was the rustling of students getting ready to leave. Eighth year transfiguration had just finished and Draco hoped that whatever it was wouldn’t take long, he had muggle studies starting in a few minutes.
He carefully packed his presents away and slid back into bed, hoping that sleep would help with his terrible headache.
“Then go?” Harry replied confused.
he heard.
Both Hermione and Pansy were absent when Draco reached the Great Hall for breakfast that morning. Without much thought he sat down next to Blaise, which also meant he was across from Hannah and Neville. Hannah sent him a small smile as Draco grabbed himself some toast.
Silently glaring at each and every student present, Draco thanked Merlin and Morgana that he still held some power within Slytherin house, as each and every student turned away at his clear challenge. Every one of them, except for Pansy and Blaise, who were staring at him with shocked expressions. Deciding to ignore them for the time being, Draco nuzzled Harry’s hair with his nose and murmured, “You know that everyone can see you, right?”
Harry pairs up with Jonathan and pins him to the mat within seconds after bowing. He releases him and the dance begins anew. After five minutes Harry had Jonathan pinned twelve times. They’re in the midst of fight number thirteen when Malcolm orders them to stop. When Harry looks up from his bow to Jonathan, he sees Malfoy escort a bleeding Chris from the mat.
“Never have I ever slept with someone who was more than 5 years older than me.” was Weasley’s contribution and Draco watched in amazement as Hermione cursed and took a shot.
Despite rolling his eyes, Draco felt touched that Harry had noticed his absence at dinner. Maybe even missed him. His shoulder was warm where Harry had touched it.
His Mother didn’t disappoint. She sent all seven pictures within two days and didn’t even ask a single question. With consideration, Draco got out his dark blue parchment and the silver ink that he normally used for his personal notes and sat down to craft a letter to Potter.
Harry laughed delightedly, “That’s it Draco!” he exclaimed, before he realized what he just said. “Uh I mean… Congratulations Malfoy”
Movement drew Harry’s eyes from the muscular shoulders and onto the hips still hidden underneath pajama pants and the blanket. It took him a moment to realise that Malfoy was rutting against the mattress. Harry gulped, casting Lumos had been a mistake.
Wand in hand he dashed out of the room and fled to the kitchen. He would return after a tea, and maybe a cold shower.
“I somehow can’t believe you spent most of the holidays reading textbooks. There must have been something more than just Potions and the Weasleys.”
Draco pondered the idea for a moment. After the party and the previous visit to the room he wasn’t nearly as opposed to the idea as he would have thought. He accepted and they settled on meeting the next day after dinner to try brewing a few of the simpler potions.
When Potter made no move to reach for the wand, Pansy took it upon herself and spun. It once again landed on Draco. He looked at her and the years of friendship paid off as he understood when she flicked her eyes to Potter, brows furrowed, only to moments later watch questioningly between Draco and Blaise. Draco gave a minute shrug at her plan, if it would stop everyone from looking at Potter like a kicked puppy he would do it.
“Okay, Hermione said, “Game time. The rules are as follows:
“He’s my boyfriend.” Blaise admitted.
Finally saying the words out loud to her felt like he was diving too fast, his broom hurtling straight towards the ground, not knowing if he would be able to pull up before crashing. His hands were still shaking badly, heart still racing and tears still gathering in his eyes but it didn’t matter. Right that moment he was weightless, his broom may have been hurtling towards the ground, but right then he was still falling freely.
“Well, how am I supposed to know that?”
At her mention he looked to the two students sitting to his right. They were working on the same parchment and sat pretty close to each other, completely oblivious to their surroundings. While he looked, Blaise gently nudged the small Hufflepuff with his shoulder, making her giggle. The gesture seemed oddly intimate. When had those two become so close? And hadn’t Pansy mentioned something about Hannah spending a lot of time with Longbottom?
“I’m glad you told me, although I wish you had told me earlier. Now I won’t promise any results, but I will see what I can do about getting you a new parole officer. I still need some more detail about what exactly happened, but I believe and trust you Draco.”
As if it were obvious, Potter only motioned between the two of them. “It’s you and me. You have hated me since forever.”
“Thank you for yesterday.” Draco said, hoping he had conveyed his gratitude in a way Potter understood. He allowed himself to linger a second longer and let his hand fall from Harry’s.
“Welcome to Dragon Cakes and Coffee, what can I get you today?” He said cheerfully while he placed the tray on the counter, his head snapping up when he heard the incredulous, “Malfoy??”
“Bloody ferret”, grumbled Ron, refraining from going after the Slytherin, probably for Hermione’s sake. Harry had heard her lecture Ron about not rising to the bait often enough that he could repeat the speech in his sleep. And for this instance, Harry had to agree with Hermione.
Another sip of tea.
Detailed warnings in the chapter end notes.
. With his eyes still firmly trained on the edge of the desk in front of him he said, “I’ve been keeping out of trouble. Nothing has happened that is worth reporting.”
Groaning Draco buried his head in his hands. Not only did he need to manage physical contact with Harry Potter on the daily, no it had to be meaningful too. Bloody fantastic.
Oddly enough, the soft breathing next to him only helped him fall asleep faster.
“I can wait.”
The little boy nodded with enthusiasm and Draco watched his hair change from blue to white blonde. ‘Inherited his mother's gift then’ he thought as he put the eleventh cookie into the bag and closed it. He went back to his cash register where Potter still stood and asked the man whether he would want anything else.
Draco felt himself blush more violently, “I thought I was just imagining it, that you came for the sweets and maybe later on the friendship,” he whispered. Not once had he dared to hope that Harry might reciprocate his attraction.
They walked in silence for a moment, turning the corner to the 4th floor. When they were just a few feet away from the entrance to their common room, Granger spoke yet again.
“Do you have a reference with you?” The girl - Leah according to her name tag - asked sceptically.
Clutching his trunk tightly, he spun on the spot and apparated home.
Mentally preparing, Draco gave permission and held his breath for the expected touch of Potter’s fingers. The touch, when it came a few seconds later, was hesitant and warm, the fingers gently tracing the lines of the faintly raised scars on Draco’s chest and abdomen. Draco focussed intently on the fraying leather of the couch just next to his left knee. His concentration broke when the fingers stilled on the worst of the scars, the one that had cut the deepest, just below his right collarbone.
Draco tried to listen to them, but his heart was pumping fast and he could hear his blood rushing. Pansy nudged him again, “Relax, you’re safe. Remember?” In his panic, Draco didn’t notice that Hermione whispered something to the other participants.
“Don’t. It’s okay, really. Pansy explained it to me.”
“Unless you have a better idea?” A shot disappeared into Malfoys mouth.
Without a second thought, Draco waved his worries off. “No, it’s fine. Really. Even without the addition of coming out, the press will have a field day once they find out, just because it’s us.” A shiver ran through him at the possible headlines and Draco was suddenly glad that he didn’t take the Prophet anymore. “I meant it earlier. As long as I can tell my friends and my mother about us at some point, I don’t mind sneaking around.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at that, “I saw the recognition on your face. I would know you anywhere and you know me anywhere too. And please, I know what you’re like in an actual fight. You put on a show to protect yourself, not to stop me. Regardless, you saved me, so thank you.”
48 hours.
They broke apart to look at the beautiful silver doe that strutted across the room. Harry knew they would have a lot to talk about, but for now he was content with simply pulling Draco close and kissing him again.
I also need to thank you… for saving me from the fire and for speaking at my trial.”  His hands were clammy inside his pockets and he nervously gnawed on his bottom lip.
This fic was originally supposed to be a 6 chapter, lighthearted drinking game fic. Safe to say I failed at that (although there will be drinking games) but I do hope you like it nonetheless.
With Pansy, cutting straight to the point was always preferable.
there were SO MANY comments on the last chapter and I am super happy that you liked it!! I hope this chapter is to your liking as well. I sure feel good about it :)
Draco mumbled his thanks and took the empty seat next to Pansy. Once he was seated, Hermione seemed to have finally recovered her ability to speak as well. “The hair suits you,” she complimented, only to ask moments later, “Are those muggle piercings?”
Hope flared up inside of Draco, “Yes?” he prodded gently.
Another shaky inhale and then all of a sudden a sob. And like a damn braking, Draco crumbled on the threshold of the door, the sobs shaking his body. A litany of “I’m sorry” escaped his lips. Trembling fingers clutched at blonde hair, pulling as if to tear it out.
Hand in hand they entered the Great Hall, already waiting for the students to come in and start another term at Hogwarts.
“I am not going to Pomfrey over this.” he stated flatly. He had lived through worse, a few bruises weren’t enough for him to rouse everyone.
At least he could avoid the room, if it proved to be too much.
it is easier to fight someone close to your own weight and height.” he explains. Moments later he gives the command to start and Harry is left with the single focus to pin Chris to the ground.
, who helped me figure out how to write this.
That seems to get Draco going again. He clears his throat and says “I can work with that. Even though your arse would probably look lovely glowing all red…” he drifts off.
Looking around the room Draco catalogued its inhabitants as if on instinct. He could spot the whole study group, the members involved in different conversations but all present, as well as Terry Boot and Padma Patil who were deep into a discussion with two younger Ravenclaws. On top of that there were the Girl-Weasley and Luna currently talking to Hermione, Pansy, and Harry.  If he included himself and the few 7th years all around the room there were only 22 people present.
“Are we that obvious?”
Pansy sat with her back to the common room entrance, deeply invested in the discussion she had with Hermione, who was sitting across from her. The seating arrangements resulted in Hermione being the first to notice Draco stepping in, and Draco cursed himself for not ducking into one of the bathrooms on his way to check his appearance. From the look on Hermione’s face, he deduced that he must look a fright.
“No need to be shy, Dragon. Nothing I haven't seen before.” Blaise teased.
Sometime during that, Harry had let his hands slide out of the blond hair and now that he lies on his back, Draco on top of him anew, he opts for reaching for the buttons of Draco’s dark dress shirt. His plan gets thwarted when Draco intercepts his hands and forcefully pushes them into the mattress. Harry struggles against him but Draco is stronger and even manages to switch to holding him down with only one hand. With the free hand he pulls his wand out of his jean pocket and when he spells ropes onto Harry’s wrists, Harry feels another surge of lust racing through his body. He moans loudly, pulling at the ropes slightly only to realise that Draco must have anchored them in the headboard. The thought only turns him on more.
Which is how Harry found himself in the current predicament; standing in a doorway with Malfoy of all people, looking at a small room with only one bed.
When Draco slips out of Harry a few moments later, Harry is still coming down from his high and Draco simply pulls him into his arms, ignoring the pain across his back.
Completely taken aback Harry nods, “Uh, sure.”
He could feel the piercing gaze of McGonagall on him, the professor clearly waiting for him to say more. He stayed silent. McGonagall cleared her throat and then spoke in a soft voice, “Mr. Malfoy… Draco,” his head shot up at hearing his given name, “I can’t help you if you won’t let me. I know you might not believe it, but I do want to help you.” There was a long moment of silence which the headmistress broke with another soft spoken observation.
“Thank you for this Harry. It’s the most wonderful first date.”
And Granger was a worthy discussion partner. Her arguments were solid and passionately presented, her understanding of magical theory was quite impressive, especially considering she had had 11 years less than him to learn it.
He then lifted his head to look the Gryffindor witch into the eyes for the first time this whole year.
When the day came to an end, Harry took the stairs up, passing Neville and Dean’s door to his dreaded room that he had avoided all day. He knocked this time, but didn’t really wait for an invitation, ’let Malfoy be angry’ he thought.
“As a general rule you have the right to refuse to talk about anything you don’t want to talk about. There might be moments where I will ask why you chose to remain silent, especially if you decide on starting your healing journey with me, but you don’t have to tell me anything.”
A blush spread on Draco’s cheeks and his hands began fidgeting with the hems of the overlong sleeves again. “Uhm… Sorry for stealing it?”
Over the years he had heard multiple of his mates have wet dreams of course — living in a dorm did that — but those had been his mates, not Malfoy. And none of them sounded as desperate or sinful and none of them had begged.
Another curse escaped Hermione and she blushed a deep scarlet red even though Pansy cackled. “Do tell darling. I’m sure Ginny wants to hear all about it.”
His thoughts drifted off and he absentmindedly continued eating his porridge. He nearly spat it out again when he remembered the early stages of the morning, remembered cuddling into warmth and imagining arms embracing him. What if he hadn’t imagined it? What if Malfoy had had his arms around Harry?
At the same time the conditions of his parole were concerning him; they were too kind, almost too easy.
“Wha-” he started to ask only to be interrupted by Harry.
“Didn’t you hear? Potter vouched for him. Said he was forced to do most of the shit he did.”
“Dare,” he said.
Draco closed his book and motioned for Pansy to keep her voice down, offering her the armchair across from him.
“Potter!” Draco groaned, after reading over the others' essays so far, “You can’t add ground wartcaps into this potion! It would explode right into your face. The assignment was to counteract the foul smell of the potion, not to kill everyone in the vicinity.”
That surprised him. He was so certain that she still despised him. In an attempt to distract Pansy from the original question he asked, “Since when is she Hermione to you?”
At the mention of a mind healer, Draco’s brain provided him with the memories of Lucius sneering about ‘those weirdos’ that were in need of such utter nonsense. So he declined the offer with a simple, “Thank you professor, but no thank you.” and let his eyes flick towards the clock. If he wanted to make it to muggle studies in time he had to leave now.
Pansy looked absolutely unbothered, laying down her conclusions with confidence. Begrudgingly, Draco admired her and confirmed her assumptions with a nod, before turning his attention towards the more pressing matter.
“LIAR!” roared Morris and he slapped Draco right across his face, knocking his head to one side.
He sat and still it took him a moment to sort his thoughts, but once he had done so he shook his head ever so slightly. “Okay, Potions. I noticed that you seemed to be struggling with the unusual reaction of the ashwinder eggs.”
Her small hand covered his shaking one gently and Draco found himself actually finding comfort in it. And before he could think too deeply about it, Draco nodded. “I… I can try. No promises though.” Both Pansy and Hermione reassured him and shortly after they went back to their respective assignments.
“Draco! PLEASE!” Harry begs and Draco takes pity on him, letting his fingers dip into the crease of his arse. Eyes focussed on Harry’s face, Draco casts a wandless lubrication charm and pushes a finger into Harry’s tight hole. The resulting moan in combination with the way Harry throws his head back goes straight to Draco’s groin and he stifles a moan of his own. He opts to kiss Harry fiercely again instead, swallowing moans as he pushes his finger in deeper, slowly fucking Harry open.
Draco wanted to ask what it explained but the compulsion to drink interrupted him. He threw the shot back without knowing what he was drinking to, and then swiftly charmed his glass to refill with whatever non-alcoholic beverage resembled firewhiskey. With the 6 shots he had already drunk, he felt tipsy enough and he was unwilling to get too drunk after what had just happened, but it wouldn’t do to inform everyone else on his decision to keep his wits.
His cheeks grew hot and Draco found himself staring at his own shoes. They needed to be polished again, the worn leather was dull.
If Draco had thought their earlier snogging was mind-numbing and intoxicating, it was nothing compared to what he was feeling then, with Harry’s hands on his hips, his own hands in Harry’s hair and their tongues performing an intricate dance with each other. He was quickly losing himself in the sensation, getting high on the endorphins and dopamine.
Tears were welling up in Harry’s eye, and slowly they started falling. “I still have nightmares about it, you lying on the floor, bleeding, dying” he admitted , swaying on the spot. It was Draco’s turn to pull him into a hug. When Harry had calmed down, Draco carefully pulled himself out of the hug and coaxed his companion into walking with him. With both of them emotionally exhausted, dinner was out of the question but they were close to his flat.
‘Because I was horny and couldn’t deal with you moaning my name’ Harry thought but aloud he said, “I didn’t want you to know that I know. I originally didn’t even plan on telling you that I heard you until I slipped this morning.”
SURPRISE: The most amazing and wonderful beta in the world
The Gryffindor moaned in appreciation and took in the sight of Draco shirtless on top of him, a hand reaching up to touch the faint criss crossing scars on his chest. Draco could see the guilt building inside Harry, but was unwilling to let his scars ruin the mood.
Draco had excused himself to his rooms to unpack and come down from the long trip as soon as he could, only spending enough time with his mother to greet her and assure her that he would tell her everything he hadn’t put in his letters over dinner. Once he was out of sight, he dashed into his bathroom and curled himself into a ball on the cold floor, desperately trying to steady his breathing. There were tears streaming down his face, and he was vaguely aware that he was pulling at his hair again, but right then he didn’t care.
, he thought. Aloud he said, “You don’t even know what I was talking about!”
Time was hard to tell within the Room of Requirement but based on just how rested Draco felt, he thought it might be morning or sometime after breakfast even — he hadn’t been this rested in months.
No warnings this time :)
“Mh? What?” Draco simply gestured to the three of them talking avidly.
It was nearly time for dinner when Draco left her office that evening.
Once again he cast a Tempus only to realise that it was in fact still 3:23 in the afternoon and that the study meeting wouldn’t take place for another 37 minutes. With a huff he threw his wand on top of his bed and started pacing his room. When he passed his mirror and caught a glimpse of himself, he stopped dead in his tracks. He looked absolutely awful, his hair was sticking in multiple directions from running his hands through it multiple times and his school robes were wrinkled.
Afterwards, sticky and sated, they sat kissing, though at a much more leisurely pace. Draco still hadn’t moved from where he was straddling Harry but neither of them cared to change that either.
“You have earth hands, hence you are a practical and realistic person, some may even say grounded but that’s not a word I am going to use for you.”
His hands were shaking as Draco packed away his transfiguration notes. Before he even finished packing his bag, both Hermione and Pansy were by his side.
“Oh, uhm… I… kind of noticed that you weren’t at dinner, which isn’t that unusual but then you weren’t in the dorm either so I figured you must be in the kitchens. I stopped by the kitchens to come get you but Winky said you hadn’t been there all day and then I just… thought you still needed to eat and that we could have a little picnic.”
Leaning in, Draco stage-whispered, “Better check your brain then darling, it has only been a year.” pecked Blaise on the lips once more and extracted himself from his lap.
Even though her announcing her actions made Draco feel stupid, he was glad because despite the warning he felt his heart speed up, when she took out the wand.
The group of Truth or Dare players had returned to their game, but Draco caught Pansy’s eyes, noticing the mischievous glint in her features. One insistent eyebrow-conversation later, Pansy and Hermione made their way over to him.
An hour later Harry leaves the studio, exhausted but content. He had managed to progress into falling from a standing height and even did some basic throws with a partner, his fear of falling completely gone.
In the end, Draco had managed 7 NEWTs, 6 of them Outstanding and only one Exceeds Expectations. He was proud of himself and he even had an interview for a potential mastery lined up. Soon he would be at the manor, seeing his mother and shortly after he would pack what little belongings he still had at the manor and move in with Harry. After he had secured that he could floo his mother whenever he wanted, he had had few qualms in accepting Harry’s offer.
Without even thinking about it, Draco answered, “No.” and when no one said anything else asked, “You were saying?” Still no reaction. “Something about Astoria Greengrass?”
Despite the question, Hermione sounded sure of herself. It was only logical. Draco only ever left the common room for class, and nowadays meals, but for both of those he was accompanied by someone from their study group. There was the rare occasion that he would talk to McGonagall but then he still wouldn’t come back bruised. That left only one option open: his parole meetings.
Also this chapter feautres a therapy session for which I really want to thank
he told himself.
Harry spent the day avoiding Malfoy, which was quite a feat considering that neither of them left the small cottage that the 8th years were sharing.
“Merlin, I want you.” Harry murmured hoarsely into his ear, the sound going straight to Draco’s cock.
“Thank you, thank you!” Malfoy happily murmured inches from Harry's ear and seconds later Harry registered the smell of the cologne and Draco began to pull back.
Draco pulls his hand from Harry’s neck and thrusts into Harry even faster, chasing his own release. The fingernails that are still digging into his back and the pulsing of Harry’s walls around his cock pushes him over the edge as well, and his moans mix with Harry’s as Draco pumps his release into him.
scratches against it. They are learning the falling exercises themselves in a moment, and hurling himself into the ground at high speed just doesn’t sound fun. Malcolm senses the hesitation from his four trainees and switches tactics.
The hand in Draco’s hair tightened and pulled at his hair, forcing another moan from his lips as their kiss broke and his head was pulled back. In an instant Harry’s lips were on his neck; kissing, sucking and biting lightly.
“Mounts??” Harry asked in confusion. He had no clue what Malfoy was talking about. Trelawney had most definitely never talked about mounts.
“I was about to cast an unforgivable on you, knowing full well what it would entail. I think we’re even on that. I might have even deserved worse.” Draco mumbled, looking down at the table.
The sofa had left him with an aching back and a stiff neck. He supposed it was his own fault for falling asleep on it, but he still grumbled about it.
Sporting an overdone image of innocence, Pansy said, “I forgot?” and fluttered her lashes. She laughed when Draco snorted at her display. “Nah. I just thought it would be pointless.”
‘Fleamont Potter and Zaira Zabini, winter 1951’.
*~*~*~*
He and Harry had spent the morning in the Hogwarts kitchen baking cookies. Or rather, Harry had taught Draco how to bake cookies. The dough mixing had seemed similar enough to Potions but when Harry had said to roll out the dough so they could cut it, Draco was confused. Patiently, Harry explained the concept of cookie cutters and how thick the dough had to be. Then they started baking.
“Draco?”
The vulnerability Malfoy offered him felt as if he was handed a precious gift and Harry wanted desperately to return the favor.
This chapter deals with Anxiety, Canon violence (such as sectumsempra and general references to canon occurences) as well as scars.
Confused, Draco looked around for any hint of the time. Guessing his confusion Harry continued, “Sometime early morning on boxing day. I came in just after dinner yesterday.”
“What about one of the house's common rooms?” asked Harry, confused.
Draco rushed to the great hall, he had overslept and now breakfast was nearly over. In his haste he ran head-first into someone and was just about to snarl that they should bloody watch where they were going, when he realized the warmth blooming in his chest. There was an electrifying feeling rushing from their point of contact into every fibre of his being, chasing the tiredness and the pull that Draco usually ignored, away.
“You know?” An incredulous laugh, a single tear escaping his eyes. “How? When??”
Please do tell me what you think of this chapter because it was at this point I realised that I hate writing drinking games. This chapter was so much fun yet such a horror to write. Honestly.
That seemed to take the wind out of Pansy’s sails and no one spoke for a few seconds until Blaise breached the uncomfortable silence.
He tasted of caramel and fruit and his lips caused Draco’s to tingle; an electric sensation starting where he was connected to Harry and slowly reaching into every fibre of his being. Despite the energy racing through his system, he felt frozen in place, unable to move. The butterflies in his stomach were fluttering up a storm and Draco dreaded the moment he would wake from this dream.
he reprimanded himself.
With a sense of urgency he raced to the dorm across the hall, knocking rapidly on the door. Fortunately it was Draco who opened. “Do you mean it?” Harry asked, slightly out of breath.
During Harry’s tirade Malfoy’s shoulders had dropped, his head had lifted in between only to now vehemently stare at his plate again.
Harry groaned slightly and lightly swatted Draco on the chest. “It’s you, you idiot.”
“Hermione and I.” Draco stopped eating, the remaining sandwich forgotten in his hands.
The Gryffindor witch reached Draco and motioned him to walk with her.
“I guess I never really said it, but I like you too. A lot.” he confessed, gaze fixed on their joined hands.
“I am keeping us secret for you. Because you don’t want everyone knowing yet and that’s perfectly fine! Your reasons are solid and I probably would have asked the same in your position. But this is Hermione we’re talking about. She will be happy for us once we tell her, and you know it. I’m fine with telling our friends about our relationship when you’re ready for it.”
and leaving with three new piercings, Draco once again stepped through the door, this time leaving with another new piercing as well as a new tattoo.
“I was thinking, the bond will roughly be active until the end of August and that it would be highly irresponsible of me to leave you alone in that time for more than a day.”
“I’m sorry.” Harry whispered once he was close enough. Draco, too used to Harry invisibly sneaking up on him, didn’t even flinch.
In the morning he felt guilty. It was one thing to not tell Draco about him cuddling Harry while asleep, but to consciously enjoy it felt like using Draco. They still spent the day studying next to each other but Harry found that he couldn’t as freely join into the easy flow of conversation they had grown used to in the past week. If Draco noticed his odd behaviour he didn’t comment on it.
“I don’t care. Let them see.”
“It’s your dare and I am perfectly comfortable here.” Blaise teased and Draco recognised the playful tone.
His fault.
No one really acknowledged him except for Pansy, who nudged him with her foot when he sat down in the armchair next to her. A few moments later, Hermione addressed Hannah, “So, truth or dare?”
“Feelings, huh?” now it was his turn to stare at his plate. He felt his cheeks heat, his blush would be quite prominent —  damn his light complexion. Harry hadn’t even admitted to liking him, just to having any sort of feelings.
The sound of someone entering the room let Draco flinch and hurry to cover himself. He was acutely aware of his bare forearms as he hastily pulled his t-shirt over his head.
It took a few minutes for Draco to stop crying but when he did Pansy asked him again to tell her what had happened. Desperately clinging to his composure, he told her the gist of it. His admission was followed by a few moments of enraged silence before Pansy had collected herself enough to command him to strip his shirt and let her check for damage.
Harry took a deep breath before looking him straight into the face, “Would you like to go on a date with me?”
Pansy arrived back with the potion and added that there would be a spell, keeping everyone from speaking to anyone outside of the game about what happened during the game.
“Sorry. It’s just… The name carries too many memories.” he said lamely.
“You bloody idiot! You could have DIED and you’re worrying about ruining Christmas? Why didn’t you tell me before?” And that was the Harry Draco had known for the past few years, loud, angry, self-righteous. He jumped back into their old dynamic with ease, pulling his hand away.
“It’s fine Draco. I sometimes need to be forced into things for my own good. It’s how we always handled it.” Harry then turned to Hermione. “You can’t tell anyone else though. Let Draco tell Pansy on his own terms and I’m really not comfortable with anyone else knowing just yet.”
Intuitively and without a doubt.
This was what Draco had been dreading from the moment his head had cleared enough to actually realize what he had done. His hair. His unmistakable platinum blond hair was now shorter, barely reaching his earlobe. In his state he hadn’t thought about any technique, style or even reason, he had just grabbed a strand and cut it off. His mind had calmed with every little
Harry shrugged. “I mean I spent some time renovating No. 12 but I only did one of the bathrooms and the second sitting room, so not really much to talk about.”
Harry leaned forward, hands reaching to cup Draco’s face, and Draco nearly stopped breathing. His heart was threatening to jump out of his chest and heat radiated from the simple contact of Harry’s rough hands to his cheeks. Without properly realising what was happening, Draco felt himself short-circuit when Harry’s lips touched his, sinking his hands into the dark locks and pulling the other even closer.
Aside from the practical experience, Mister Potter is also in possession of a Muggle degree in education, which he will be using to reform the Hogwarts curriculum in collaboration with the Headmistress herself.
“Of course.” Hermione insisted, sounding almost insulted at the implication of being a gossipmonger. Giving Harry a kiss on the cheek, she got up and returned to her own table.
, she hadn’t invited the other Slytherin to make him feel better about being here, meaning Blaise had come on his own accord.
Malfoy was once again sitting on the bed, book in hand, but shuffled towards Harry at the mention of food. He looked suspiciously at the food before mumbling his thanks and beginning to eat, right on their bed.
“They treated me like a house-elf. I had to cook ever since I was old enough to lift the frying pan, I had to clean and do the garden work. If I did anything wrong they would lock me in the cupboard, sometimes not even letting me out to eat. Even if I did nothing wrong I was only ever allowed to eat the scraps none of them wanted. The day Hagrid came to give me my Hogwarts letter felt like a miracle. I didn’t even know I was a wizard until then.”
Harry conceded and settled for dismantling the muffliato and walking over to the other table. Watching avidly, Draco saw Harry whisper to Hermione and Hermione in turn giving Harry a supporting nudge. He then heard Harry say, “Uhm so. I guess I just wanted to say that I’m bisexual.”
They enter his bedroom and Harry looks around in surprise. He had expected a luxurious and Slytherin coded space, but instead he stands in a comfortable room, kept in greys and darker blues.  The last of the evening sun lights the bed in an ethereal light. Completely transfixed by the room, Harry doesn’t really notice Draco slipping into the en-suite bathroom. He snaps out of it, when the Slytherin slips him a small vial.
“What the fuck Potter?” Draco heard Blaise exclaim and found he shared the sentiment. What the fuck indeed.
“I don’t even know.” Harry lamented, throwing his hands up. He groaned in frustration, before leaning towards Draco and placing his head on his shoulder. On the outside Draco remained calm, while on the inside he was once again freaking out. The other’s head felt heavenly on his shoulder, the perfect weight and warmth and he could feel himself losing the fight against his rising hope. His brain was replaying their drunken kiss near the end of the last party, jumping to conclusions and leaving him yearning for the touch of those warm lips on his.
And completely opposite to their previous drunk and dared kiss, Harry leaned closer slowly, one hand raising up to cup the side of Draco’s face and after what felt like aeons, his warm lips were finally touching Draco’s.
Draco saw the moment it clicked in Blaise’s brain as his fury disappeared. Still Blaise didn’t seem thrilled, sending a questioning look and a whisper to Neville sitting next to him. The Gryffindor nudged his shoulder and whispered back. From Neville’s other side, Hannah smiled encouragingly at him.
Once Harry had calmed down completely, Draco dismissed the silencing spell around them and the laughter of the circle hit them like a front. Momentarily panicking that they were laughing about him, Draco took stock of his surroundings and noticed that Hannah Abott had gone red next to Neville. Her boyfriend gently nudged her and whispered something in her ear that did nothing to diminish the redness. Draco calmed.
“Look, I really can help you with this. I may have an idea why it’s not working.”
“Are you coming down for dinner?” asked Harry, hopeful. But Draco shook his head no. His social batteries were drained and he had planned on a silent dinner in the kitchen ever since leaving the Great Hall after lunch. The dejected look at his declination almost made him change his mind. Almost.
The Hall was bustling with activity when he finally left, both girls at his side.
and you will stop when one of you is pinned down or one of you says stop. Is that clear? Remember, you want to pin your partner down and not hurt them, try to get them into the holding techniques we covered already or get creative.”
“I know my darling.” came Narcissa’s reply, no hint of surprise or negativity in her voice. “I’m glad you finally feel safe enough to tell me.”
Harry had the decency to look unsettled. “He named me heir.” he repeated quietly, “I don’t know why, but the goblins confirmed it and all. It was quite the fuss when we found out but I’m guessing Sirius didn’t want it all to fall to one of his relatives and all that, what with Grimmauld being our Headquarters.”
By Sunday, Draco had skipped another five meals and it wasn’t even lunch yet. He had tried to go down for dinner on Saturday, after Pansy’s endless nagging had grown to be too much.
After multiple reported sightings of Harry Potter in the company of Draco Malfoy it is finally official! Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy are in a committed relationship with each other.
Before he could wonder about the friendliness displayed in the single sentence, Morris was talking to him again, “This isn’t over, I’ll get you next time.”
His bakery was close enough to his flat that he could walk. He reached the doors as it was nearing 5am and let himself in, locking the door behind him. Dragon Cakes and Coffee wouldn’t officially open until 10am.
(See the end of the chapter for
Just when Draco thought Harry had fallen asleep, the man spoke up, “I may have understated my feelings for you.” he confessed and nuzzled his face in Draco’s hair.
