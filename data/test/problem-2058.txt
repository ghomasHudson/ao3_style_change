Remus seems to swallows a sigh, ”No, you saw her at King’s Cross with Harry only a couple of years ago. Now—”
”Oh Merlin…” he mumbles. ”There
”Oh, is that all…? Well, after all that walking, I’m sure you must be hungry…” he says and walks back into the kitchen. ”The treacle tart is still hot and I’ve just put the kettle on…”
”He believed me. But I think he’d already figured most of it out himself. Also, he’d figured out what the monster is…”
”Yes!”
”It’s okay, it won’t be dangerous, I promise!”
”I was just leaving”, Harry mumbles after another awkward moment of silence.
renounced the old ways!”
”Hiya, Harry!”
”Have either of you seen a toad, Neville here has lost one”, the girl says in a rather bossy voice.
Harry snaps his mouth shut again.
With a jolt, Harry spots a familiar-looking eagle owl hovering outside the window, scratching insistently against the glass pane…
”Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll be writing more horrible stories about us all, I’m sure”, Granger says loftily, shaking her massive, frizzy mane from her face with a haughty sniff. ”Find someone who cares, why don’t you?”
” he says, narrowing his eyes at the teenager for a second, but then a thought occurs to him and he sags a little, turning away. ”
”And ten points from Ravenclaw, too, Stebbins!” Snape calls after them.
”Draco?”
before they pop out of existance all around his head like so many soap bubbles.
With no-one to talk to and the gentle rocking of the bike lulling him to sleep, Harry dozes off for a while and when he wakes up, the sun has started to set. He straightens up and peers over the side of the sidecar, catching glimpses of green peeking out through holes in the blanket of golden clouds.
”Yeah, maybe…” Harry nods.
Malfoy frowns, ”Dementors?”
”— tomorrow will be different, I promise. Please.”
”… and with that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around as well — no, poor man’s having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I’m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place!”
what she wanted to talk to you about?”
”I think we lost him”, Harry pants.
He is steeling himself for the inevitable moment when Draco will envelop the leaking head in his hot mouth and begin to suck, and gasps in surprise when the inquisitive mouth ventures further down and mouths at his balls instead. Draco’s slender but strong hands knead the insides of his thighs, gently but firmly pushing them further apart while his tongue continues to swirl around Harry’s scrotum —
”I don’t think she did it, either”, Harry says remembering the pitiful elf. ”Mr Crouch made her sit in that Top Box the whole game and save his seat for him and she looked terrified. She kept hiding her face in her hands. And he never even showed up…”
”And these two?”
Harry and Pansy’s heads bump together again briefly, before they manage to look up and locate the direction of Draco’s voice. They blink blearily at him where he’s sitting, watching them patiently from the other end of the sofa. Harry squints, trying to determine which one of him he should be focusing on, since there are now two of him and they are both giving him pinched smiles.
Glaring at the door in front of him, Harry reaches out to push it open.
” Draco says haughtily and huffs.
Better even than Harry, who did do quite a lot of practising in using non-verbal spells when he was revising for his O.W.L.s with Draco last year, not that the O.W.L.s included non-verbal spells or the Patronus Charm, but Draco wanted to practise that too, probably hoping for the opportunity to show off in the exams, even if it wouldn’t award him any actual bonus points. So Harry knows he can cast at least Protego and Expelliarmus non-verbally, but right now he’s really struggling to concentrate.
”No, she is
Harry startles awake, his hands twisted in the sheets and a frustrated growl stuck in his throat. He punches the mattress next to him and fists his hair.
”One: bringing Granger to the dionysian spectacle that is the Slytherin end of year party. Two: unleashing Pansy and myself on the Gobstones tournament that a bunch of slightly butterbeer-tipsy gryffindors considers a party…”
”She caught us using her fireplace”, Harry clarifies. ”But we got away, thanks to Hermione—”
He tries to tilt his head a little more, so that he can see into the corners of the room, and before he knows it his nose has brushed the surface of the substance. No sooner has the cool sensation registered with him, than the entire Headmaster’s Office gives a massive lurch under his feet and he feels himself falling…
This is the first year where there’s been actual animosity in their House and it’s mostly been directed at Draco. Luckily Crabbe and Goyle were always hopeless at potions and as far as Harry knows there’s no-one else in their — besides Theo — who’s got parents who are Death Eaters, so Millicent Bulstrode’s perpetual grumpiness aside, at least here they can relax…
”Is that from Draco?” Remus asks lightly, clearly intending to distract Harry from the fact that he hides the other letters at the bottom of the small pile of old Prophets at the end of the counter.
The boys all look up and grin in greeting when they see him, but the girls pretend not to have noticed his entrance at all.
”Ron…” Harry says.
”Well, it’s clearly guarding something, isn’t it”, Draco says and shrugs.
”Bastard”, Draco hisses suddenly next to him and Harry flinches, believing for a second that the blonde had somehow managed to read his mind, but when he looks over he’s relieved to see the other boy’s eyes are fixed on the paper again.
Draco looks like he rather finish his porridge than call a grown-up he barely knows by their first name, but dutifully mumbles an
in all the best places. Before he’s even opened his eyes, he finds himself moving instinctively, burrowing into the warmth of the embrace, his hips gyrating slowly but eagerly, chasing some kind of friction, his hands fisting silky hair…
”Yes…” Umbridge says quietly. ”It hurts, doesn’t it…”
”Okay”, Harry says. ”Theo, you okay with that?”
”Hiya, Harry!” a high-pitched voice pipes up to his left, causing him to jump slightly.
on the 1994 shelf…”
, Harry wants to snap, just to unsettle the annoying elf, but part of Harry shivers just thinking about the name.
Draco’s eyes widen in understanding and…
”I — I don’t — know —
”Ninety-seven”, Harry murmurs grimly, staring up at the small number plaque on the shelf in front of them.
”Yeah, and
”You’ve left me…”
”Come on, better not be late our first lesson with the toad…” Blaise mutters.
, good Bludger from Goyle there, and Spinnet’s lost the Quaffle, Malfoy’s caught it and he passes to Montague, who passes to Flint  — oh, but the crowd is loving this, just listen to them, what’s that they’re singing?”
Draco breaks the kiss again.
Krum watches him thoughtfully for a moment.
”Th-thank you, Mr—”
”I’m sure you have… Questions…”
As the Hufflepuff team enter the Great Hall and take their seats at the table at the far end of the hall, Daphne and Pansy suddenly start squirming in their seats, trying to get a better look and then erupt in a random peal of shrill giggles. Harry frowns, wondering when these two developed an interest in quidditch… Looking over at the hufflepuff table, he immediately spots a new player.
Harry glances at the other teachers and notices that all of their smiles have become rather strained, and the hooked-nosed man isn’t even smiling at all.
”Don’t be ridiculous. You need time to get ready—”
and Harry is pleasantly surprised to find his black and white presence next to Lockhart’s plum-coloured robes and golden curls quite comforting.
”It’s a dragon!” a first-year girl shrieks.
”Yeah?” Harry says.
”Sorry”, the blonde mumbles.
”Are you happy?” Draco whispers into the darkness.
”And they’ve held out this long?” Harry says in surprise.
that is looming ever closer on the horizon and putting a damper on their conversation.
Then finally, Dumbledore — standing amongst the rest of the teachers at the top of the stairs behind them — exclaims, ”Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches!”
”Just a small pepper up type of spell, nothing that will cause her to completely forgo her modesty…” the Slytherin girl says silkily and bats her eye lashes at him.
”I’m ready — let’s go”, Draco says urgently.
”Sir, I was wondering what you know about… about Horcruxes?”
… and, he said he, erm, enjoyed it, but… but straight after, he started crying… I’m
”It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between the two of you”, Snape says finally, his voice slow and deliberate, each syllable spoken with silky precision. ”Until very recently.”
”I said,
Draco huffs softly and proceeds to weave his way to the front of the crowd in his usual dainty manner. Harry smirks wryly, watching him go… As if he’s wading through water, the other students trickle aside and unconsciously make way for him without even realising he’s cutting in front of them…
”I always keep it in my bag!”
”What number is it?” Harry asks curiously, looking at the many doors for any sign that one of them would lead to a magical household.
”Low profile, remember?” Granger murmurs under her breath and he nods quickly, silently cursing himself for being so obvious.
”Did you do more than kiss?” Harry blurts out before he can stop himself.
Harry shoots Pansy a suspicious look and receives an feigned innocent look in return.
Seamus, Blaise and Theo are still awake when they walk inside, but they quickly disappear behind the hangings of their respective beds after giving Harry pinched smiles in greeting.
”You need to be more disciplined than this, come on now…
, Harry tells himself.
Sirius huffs and rubs his hands over his face, ”Let him have them, if he wants…”
The boys quiet down then, turning their eyes on Harry again. He can see the cog wheels turning behind each one of them. He swallows thickly.
with you next time—?”
”Yeah…” Harry nods.
”Well, let the slugs have their little ego fest…” Daphne sniffs and Seamus readily nods in agreement.
Draco has already grabbed the glass back from him and gulped down half the contents. Blaise and Pansy watch him with bated breath. He frowns and looks between the glass and Granger.
”Taking a leaf out of Granger’s book, are we?” Blaise comments drily.
”It was acceptable”, Snape mutters evasively, but his scowl softens slightly and he follows Harry into the kitchen.
”Yeah, a-alright…”
”You’re kidding?” Seamus says breathlessly. ”You actually heard Dumbledore say that?”
Harry feels the familiar niggle at the front of his mind and knows the older man is burrowing inside to sift through his thoughts. He grits his teeth, but doesn’t try to shield anything or throw the man out.
, Harry thinks as he watches his boyfriend roll up the letter neatly again.
”Right…” Remus says, giving Harry a sidelong glance.
”Well, a love potion”, Pansy says drily, shooting him a look. ”It’s hardly
”Viktor Krum? What do you mean?” Harry says.
”But how am I going to get there, I’ve missed the train —!”
”Yeah, positive”, Draco mumbles and takes a swig from the bottle.
”It was Lily’s love for you that protected you when—”
”They’re in here somewhere… Probably hiding, my sweet…”
Harry nods, swallowing hard. It never even occurred to him at the time, but now that he’s had some time to think and process everything, it’s the only thing that makes sense… Also, that would explain the look Draco and Narcissa shared, and it would also explain what Draco meant when he said ”They won’t harm
”… but my plan to get the Stone failed. I was thwarted… thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter!” he hisses. ”The servant died when I left his body and I was left as weak as I had ever been… I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn’t then fear that I might never regain my powers… yes, that was my darkest hour… I could not hope to find another wizard to possess, and I had given up hope that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me.”
”Wait, what?” Remus says. ”You didn’t dream about… About Lily…?”
”Get. Up—”
and he broke half the eggs—!”
Two hours later, Harry has flicked through ten different books and his initial excitement has ebbed considerably.
”More than one?” Seamus pipes up from the floor.
a. PARALLEL
”Okay, well”, Harry says decisively and leans in for a quick kiss before giving the other boy a gentle shove in the chest. ”Good night.”
”Harry? The ball?” Remus asks again.
”Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?” Harry calls after him.
”Granger?” Seamus says sceptically. ”The bookbag-hunchbacked, goody-goody know-it-all? Blackmailing the most vicious reporter in Britain?”
He waits for the wall to rearrange itself before noxing and pocketing his wand, the soft green light from the lanterns lining the Common Room walls enough to guide him across the room towards the dormitory staircase, but before he can, he stumbles back startled when a frantic-looking Malfoy suddenly pops up from one of the armchairs like a manic Jack-in-the-box.
Harry simply smirks at the two friends and resumes his seat on the opposite sofa, exchanging an amused look with Blaise and Seamus.
”It’s fine, we’re okay.”
He disappears into his office and returns a moment later with some kind of salve that he hands to Draco, with instructions on how to rub it into the affected skin. The blonde nods seriously.
”Harry, my boy…” the Headmaster says warmly and twinkles at him. ”Had a good birthday?”
Pansy hands him the jar of murtlap salve with a thin smile and he accepts it gratefully. As soon as he’s lathered a generous amount of the salve across the back of his hand and the magical properties have begun to soothe the searing pain, he looks around and notices everyone’s tired and almost pained expressions and he wonders just how long Draco has been venting about this before he showed up.
”Yeah, very”, Remus agrees.
Harry finally excuses himself and retires to the dorm and dutifully goes through his relaxation exercises carefully, before collapsing into bed and falling into a deep sleep.
He lowers himself slowly into the hole, until he’s hanging on to the edge by his fingertips. He looks up at the other two boys, both staring down at him worriedly, ”If something happens to me, don’t follow. Just go back and send Hedwig with a message to Dumbledore, okay?”
The boy deflates a little with an abashed look and nods.
The first thing that comes to mind is Pansy, and going from hating her to thinking of her as one of his best friends. But when he tries to pinpoint the exact moment when that changed, so that he can focus on that one memory, he can’t. It’s happened so slowly and gradually that it’s impossible for Harry to narrow it down to just one memory.
The old man seems to pale before Harry’s eyes.
He figures Draco is doing the same. However, unlike Draco, Harry has been feeling the same about school in general lately.
”, he calls back and in the next moment Remus appears around the corner, looking slightly flustered but doing a fairly good job at hiding it. ”I was just saying good bye to Professor Dumbledore.”
he thinks he’s completely hopeless and incompetent — and Harry doesn’t know which is worse, but he definitely knows that he doesn’t want Snape to give up on him!
”You didn’t tell me the rest of your dream—”
a subtle but extremely distracting tension headache has begun to strain across his forehead.
”I have only ever taught a handful of students with such instincts — Harry’s mother, Sybill, I’m not sure you ever had the pleasure — a bit before your time, I daresay — Lily Evans, was one of them. Harry, and only a couple of others of his peers. In fact, that’s a lot for one year, you normally only get one, if that… In Lily’s year there were the two, and that was unusual, unusual indeed —Oh! Severus, speak of the trolls!”
Dumbledore lets out several exploding firecrackers from his wand to get everyone’s attention, then promptly intructs the Prefects of Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw to lead their charges to their dormitories and the Slytherins to stay in the Great Hall while the teachers follow him to the dungeons.
”What we just did”, Harry says, shrugging uncomfortably. ”I — I wanted to and I — I really liked it — It was just a bit… Overwhelming, that’s all.”
The three-headed dog starts growling ominously and Draco clutches Harry’s arm so tightly he’s sure he’ll have bruises come morning.
, Harry thinks when he feels the subtle throbbing against his own chest — for some reason, the thought of Draco’s heart beating, and beating
”Everything okay, Harry?” Remus prompts gently.
”So you worked it out then…” Blaise comments, nodding towards Harry’s and Draco’s interlaced fingers.
”Oh…” Harry says in a small voice, feeling his hope sink into his stomach.
”You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you Hagrid?” Harry asks anxiously. ”And you wouldn’t tell anyone, not even a teacher?”
”I’m not saying go inside it. Just fly around the edge of it… It’ll be perfectly safe, and there’s no way we can get caught.”
”I need to talk to you”, he tells Diggory.
. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and now you’ve had a first taste, you want more… Harry, Harry, Harry…”
As Harry lies awake in his bed, he keeps replaying the memories of his dads arguments in his mind and tries to put himself in his daddy’s place, tries to imagine what it must feel like… To carry around a secret that big, that dangerous, that life-altering…
”Righ’, now, who can tell me why some o’ yeh can see ’em and some can’t?”
Harry glances over at Draco who gazes back impassively, his two friends Crabbe and Goyle scowling uncertainly on either side of him, clearly confused as to how they should treat Harry now that he’s one of them. The sandy-haired boy who had walked in front of Harry in the line, Seamus Finnegan, has also been sorted into Slytherin and is sitting next to Harry. He turns to grin at Harry now and offers him his hand.
Lucius face drains completely of blood and for a split second he sways slightly, as if he’s actually going to faint…
”Hello, Harry… Black…” Professor Snape murmurs, his black eyes darting between the two of them before settling on Harry and softening slightly. ”Have you had a good summer?”
The inside of the house is impossibly filthier than the outside. Harry finds himself tensing up as if to try and make himself smaller so as to touch as little of its atmosphere as possible. Morfin is sitting on an armchair, watching the heated exchange between Ogden and his father, whilst petting an adder coiling around his fingers and singing softly to it in parseltongue.
Draco gives him a tiny smile, ”I don’t know yet… Professor Snape says I have a few options… well, two.”
Harry nods and walks over to him. Remus gives him a small smile and combs his fingers through his hair, sweeping it out of his face.
”He’s ill again, isn’t he?” Harry murmurs, watching his dad’s face closely for any sign of…
”We don’t.”
Harry feels a shiver pass through him and quickly hugs himself. In the seat next to him, Draco is unconsciously dragging his fingertips over the lower edge of the newspaper, his eyes staring unfocused at the headline. Harry frowns down at the cackling portrait of Bellatrix Lestrange and shivers again. He wishes Draco would just fold the paper up already, if he’s not going to read it… as if hearing his thoughts, Pansy leans in and whispers to Draco, ”Aren’t you going to see what the article says?”
”Not… really…” Draco mumbles. ”I mean, I get snippets of… but I don’t really remember anything when I wake up.”
” Umbridge repeats, her eyebrows climbing up into her curling fringe and she begins to scribble furiously on her clipboard.
Harry flashes back to his last dream about Voldemort, when he’d killed an old muggle man. That was in August. Harry stares at Dumbledore. He is dying to ask him about what he’d seen in the Pensieve, but at the same time, a part of him just wants to forget… Finally, he decides to leave it for another day and stands up.
”Brilliant, well done”, Pansy tells him drily as he brushes passed her.
spell and watching Draco, who touches down a couple of seconds later, grinning excitedly despite losing the impromptu race.
”You’re late”, the golden eagle statue greets him when he finally arrives at the Headmaster’s Office and Harry gives it an incredulous look. ”The Headmaster said to expect Harry Potter at 18 hundred hours. It is now 18:04.”
Draco looks up at him again, his grey eyes shining like silver as they bore into Harry’s own.
”Well…” Remus says vaguely and combs his fingers through Harry’s hair with a smile.
”I don’t know, maybe you could ask her”, Remus suggests kindly, shooting Sirius a warning look when he snorts.
”Try and get this to Draco as quickly as possible”, Harry tells Hedwig. ”Then you can enjoy some french mice, okay?”
He could go flying by himself, of course. But he rather not risk his and Draco’s tiff turn into a proper argument.
”Do you want to talk about it?” he asks softly.
There are only ten Blast-Ended Skrewts left, since their eagerness to kill each other hasn’t been squashed out of them, but ten is still plenty now that they’re almost six foot long and more temperamental than ever… Harry throws a dejected glance at the large wooden boxes that Hagrid has brought out, all lined with pillows and blankets, dreading the coming lesson…
He lets himself be hugged briefly, but quickly pulls away again and avoids his daddy’s probing gaze as he turns away and walks out of the classroom in a hurry.
Harry sighs heavily and gives the old man a grateful look, then guides Pansy through the door and into the man’s sitting room. The girl is now bouncing on her feet and all but fluttering around the room. It’s like trying to walk a pixie.
Harry shifts slightly, bringing his arm around the other boy’s body and hugging him close to his chest. He nuzzles his hairline absently, happy to breathe in the subtle scent of his coconut shampoo and the other indistinct scent that is just pure
The blonde quickly stuffs a Knut into the bird’s money bag and then grabs the paper. Harry can tell his hands are trembling slightly, the only evidence of his emotions since his face is still as shuttered as the night before, and it’s with a sinking sense of foreboding that Harry watches him pick at the knot tying the paper together.
”Don’t really give a hippogriff’s tail about what pleases him”, he says without thinking, startling a bark of a laugh out of the Potions Master that sends a thrill through him.
”I know I don’t
”Yeah, and guess who she suspects are the generals of this little army of Dumbledore’s?”
”In a manner of speaking…” Madam Bones says with a polite smile. ”Mr Potter, would you mind if I asked you a quick couple of questions about last night?”
Harry runs towards the sound of the squeaky voice without missing a beat, ignoring the stitch in his side and the weight on his chest…
Draco more or less ushers Harry inside the dorm and then shuts the door with a definitive
I’ve seen first-hand how Severus will go above and beyond to look out for hi—”
Harry stretches out languidly, craning his neck over the rounded edge of a shoulder and squirming as he feels a familiar length of soft flesh hardening along the crack of his arse…
”Fine, I’ve never heard this song before in my life”, the girl speaks in clipped tones, her eyes flashing at him. ”But my ears aren’t
”It’s okay”, Harry mumbles, even as he clutches Fawkes with trembling hands, as if the ancient bird was some kind of stuffed animal and he was a little boy. ”They helped me. They… lingered… after I broke the connection, they lingered and distracted You-Know-Who so I could run back to the portkey… and then I came back to the maze, and you all know the rest.”
Harry shrugs and turns back to the window in front of his desk. It’s pitch black outside, so he can only really see himself and the room behind him reflected in the glass. Remus steps over the threshold and approaches him silently, putting the mug of chocolate down on the desk without a word and stroking Harry over the head and neck. It makes Harry feel a little better, but he flinches and shakes his daddy’s hand off anyway.
Narcissa comes swooping inside the room from another doorway and smiles serenly at him as she inclines her head in greeting. Harry quickly mirrors the gesture and smiles back, if a little hesitantly. Although Mrs Malfoy has never been anything but nice to him, something about the witch makes him feel very uncomfortable. Probably because he can’t seem to read her and therefore has no idea what the woman is thinking, and more specifically what she thinks of
His wand is vibrating more violently than ever and beads of light begin to travel up and down the thread of light connecting it to Voldemort’s, before they slowly start to move away from Voldemort and closer to him… and the closer they get, the more violently his wand vibrates… the hotter the wood seems to get inside his hands… as the first bead gets close to the tip, Harry is sure the wand will burst into flame if it connects and concentrates all of his thoughts on willing it to move back…
The last time Harry was here, he’d been almost stunned at the sight of the Atrium. But now, he barely looks up. He vaguely registers the tinkling sound of running water as they walk passed the fountain, but Harry’s gaze doesn’t waver from the golden gates in front of them.
”That’s right!” Gaunt roars, brandishing his middle finger in a rude gesture whilst showing off the black-stoned ring he’s wearing. ”See this? Do you? This has been in my family for centuries!
”Draco…”
”Up until now, it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sneaking a peek at his thoughts, without him being any wiser… however, the vision you had shortly before Christmas was such a strong incursion upon the Dark Lord’s thoughts—”
”Yes, Sir”, Harry says quickly. ”Thank you.”
”So are you going to let me up?”
Harry chuckles, even as a light blush blooms in his cheeks at the subtle but unmistakable reference…
Every nods eagerly.
Although his mood doesn’t completely lift, Harry feels somewhat lighter when he steps out into the crisp morning air and by the time they see the Hogwarts Express roll into the station, a modest stirring of excitement is finally allowed to slip through the dense fog in his mind. He looks over at Draco and sees that the blonde’s face has relaxed a little as well.
”Harry?” Draco says in a small voice.
He leads Harry through the maze-like lower level of the manor, then up a sparkling black marble staircase. At the other end of a vast corridor lined with huge, intricate portraits of the Malfoy family members, Draco opens a door and lets Harry enter first.
Harry goes over the letter in his head several time during History of Magic, worry still gnawing at him relentlessly, but when they enter Greenhouse Three for their Herbology class and continue to repot Mandrake Roots, the high-pitched squeals of the ugly little plants manage to drown some of the worry and by the time he and Draco stand side by side at their desk at the front of the Potions classroom stirring lizard’s eyes into a Pepperup Potion under the unnervingly watchful eye of Professor Snape, the letter is all but forgotten again.
”That’s enough cheek from you for one night, mister Potter”, the girl says with mock sternness and he snickers.
”It’s… Those things…” Harry mumbles distractedly, catching Theo’s eye and giving the other boy a wry smile.
”Well, because… because we’re at
”Again, I can only offer you my own theories, but the years before Voldemort’s rise to power the last time were marked with disappearances and now a Ministry Official has disappeared without a trace, as well as a muggle by the name of Frank Bryce who lived in the village where Voldemort grew up… he has not been seen since last August. ”
”I know…” Harry agrees calmly.
”He goes to Durmstrang! Didn’t you know?”
Harry nods and hurries over to his friends, smiling at them all when they notice him approach and try their hardest not to beam, but instead nod coolly at him even as relief floods their eyes.
”Yes, you’re right, Sir”, Harry says swiftly. ”I’ll come to the next one—”
”Fine”, Draco mutters shortly, then swiftly turns away to ignore them both.
”You know… Finding a date…”
”Sirius arrived. I was really happy to see him because — because — earlier, when everyone was duelling, Bellatrix Lestrange hexed him and he fell through the curtain thing in the arch, except — I ran around it to check on him, to make sure he was alright — he wasn’t there”, Harry feels himself choke up and ducks his head, swallowing thickly a couple of times. ”I wasn’t there and… Lupin grabbed me and was pulling me away — he was saying he was gone — I didn’t want to believe him — Bellatrix Lestrange was laughing, that’s how I knew he was telling the truth — she was laughing and singing, singing she k-killed Sirius Black—”
Harry had forgotten how whip smart Pansy is,
Unfortunately, that wasn’t to be the last Harry would see of Gilderoy Lockhart — not even the last he would see of him
is to face the dragon in the air, and to do that he needs his Nimbus. And to get his Nimbus, he needs to
”Harry Potter…”
”Boys…” Remus’ loud and steady voice reaches them from the other room.
”NEVER!” Harry yells and jumps to his feet, dashing towards the still burning doorway.
”Hey, look at me… Draco? Please, look at me?”
For one awful second, Harry allows hope to fill him once more…
Realisation flickers into Draco’s eyes and the frown smoothes out slightly again.
Harry glances over at Umbridge warily, dreading the moment when she discovers him awake and threatens to expel him for breaking into her office… But the woman doesn’t seem to be aware of anything going on around her. She’s staring unseeingly into the ceiling and appears to be humming quietly to herself.
”Sorry”, Draco mutters, pulling his arm away as well.
”Of course, Remus… I completely respect your wishes… I simply had a different matter to discuss with young Harry, that is all.”
Stop kicking! I’m trying to get your boots off—”
”Really… Play Quidditch at all?”
”What”, Draco yelps. ”No, I don’t want to be on my own! I want to go with Harry!”
Once it’s finally faded away, Remus claps his hands again.
”Yes”, Remus says, looking away. ”In sixth year we… We got friendly—”
He plants his feet firmly apart and grabs his own wand, relieved for once to delve into his Occlumency lesson, if only to avoid any more awkward heart to hearts with his Head of House.
They don’t see Umbridge all day, but they hear rumours about her inspecting Trelawny when she was teaching the Fifth Year Gryffindors and that it hadn’t gone very well — for Trelawny. Harry can’t really bring himself to care, however. Sure, Divination is an easy enough subject and he’s happy for the ’O’ he’s guaranteed to get in his O.W.L.s for the trouble of having his untimely death predicted on a regular basis, but as much as Harry knows that Divination is all hokum, and he actually couldn’t care less if the lines in his palm or the tea leaves left in his cup spell out some terrible fate, he has noticed that it seems to bother Draco… in fact, it seems to bother the blonde more and more with each passing lesson, and for that reason Harry wishes Trelawny would give it a rest already — and if an inspection by Toad Face is what it takes for that to happen, then so be it!
The whole group wheels around and stares at the small pink-clad witch who stands a few metres away from them in the hallway, smiling smugly.
” Draco says, shaking his head a little as he searches for the right words. ”I was surprised at how good it felt, how… there was no pain at all, and… it was just… so many feelings all at once, that’s all—”
”What did he make you do?”
Harry thinks with a mental shrug and fixes his cauldron with an even more focused look, counting to seven and adding a clockwise stir.
”Yeah, but let’s not do it in the trophy room this time”, Harry whispers from his own bed.
Almost paralysed by panic, Harry had looked between the broomstick in his right hand and the Marauder’s Map in his left.
Harry follows Sirius gaze to the forest, then turns back to the house. And he’d thought moving to Hogsmeade was moving to the countryside…
”How may I help you, Harry?” Dumbledore asks gently.
”We were with the Order at Grimmauld Place for our weekly meeting, that’s true”, Remus says slowly. ”Then we came home to find two owls waiting for us. One was from Hogwarts informing us that you’d been caught breaking into a teacher’s office and illegally used the fireplace to floo from the school grounds and the other …”
Harry feels himself nod automatically.
don’t go, then
Sure enough, the next smoky shape to emerge from the tip of Voldemort’s wand turns out to be a human head… Krum’s head, furrowed brows and all… followed by the rest of him, and he slouches over to stand next to Harry, frowning deeply at the thread of light connecting the two wands as another shape starts to emerge…
Suddenly, Riddle stops dead in his tracks and inclines his head, listening… Harry strains his ears and listens as well, and that’s when he hears it, a voice that sounds vaguely familiar…
…” Granger says, wringing her hands in a way that definitely contradicts her statement. ”I just don’t think… It would only stir up trouble, you know what he’s like.”
”Dumbledore”, Harry says heavily, scanning the words in the brief message.
”A lot of funny people showing up here recently… Foreigners and weirdos… You look all right enough, I suppose, all things considered…” he trails off, giving Narcissa’s robes a once-over.
”And how are you going to get the Gryffindors to play spin the bottle sober—?” the other boy counters stubbornly, dodging the clawing movements of the blonde’s hands.
dumb, he’s on top of half his classes
”No—” Sirius starts, but Remus gives his hand a squeeze and he cuts himself off.
He puts the bowl of porridge down on the bedside table with a clatter, spilling some lukewarm milk over the top of his hand in the process. Without another word or a look in his boyfriend’s direction, he stomps out of the hospital wing.
”Harry”, Snape greets cordially and gives him a tiny nod. ”I trust you had a good Christmas.”
instead, settling back against the pillows and flicking through the magazine idly. When he’s finished it, he immediately reaches for the next edition. He glances over at the books with the gay cover art, feeling that curious tingle in his lower belly again. But
”Never mind that, we think someone is going to try and steal it —!”
Harry tears his eyes away from the nearest wall and looks over at the Ministry Official, catching him staring back excitedly.
”But what did you talk about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?”
Harry, too, has pinned a photograph of himself and his dads next to his Tornados poster, as well as the handmade Christmas card Draco sent him back in First Year. What he would really like to have pinned on the wall is one of the many beautiful drawings Draco has made him, but he doesn’t want to tear any of them out of the leather bound book.
”He doesn’t really care, as long as I work for the Ministry in some capacity”, Draco mutters. ”He wants me to follow in his footsteps, basically…”
First his daddy and now Draco. Harry doesn’t think he can handle any more heartbreak… Draco scowls back at him, and then Harry catches his eyes flit over to Ron’s bed suspiciously and his heart sinks into his stomach.
The invisible blanket stays securely wrapped around Harry and the light, warm atmosphere of the cottage remains firmly in place as Christmas Eve rolls around. If anything, it all intensifies with the fire in the fireplace and the many candles hovering around the rooms, and the smell of mulled wine and gingerbread wafting out of the kitchen and seeping into the living room.
and Dumbledore sighs softly and leaves the Hospital Wing first.
, that was a close one! Nice Bludger from George Weasley there, but Malfoy is a fast little ferret —”
For a split second, Harry imagines he catches a glimmer of triumph in his dad’s eyes, like he’s happy about that. But no. He shakes his head. His dad can’t be that cruel, surely?
”And I’ll see you soon, okay? Next Hogsmeade weekend. Bring Draco too, if you want. And if he wants”, Remus says, pulling back slightly to peer into Harry’s face with a watery smile. ”Okay?”
”I believe you”, he mutters tiredly, then shoots his a sidelong look of warning. ”We are
”Was it a nightmare?”
Harry frowns and looks between Barty Crouch and his daddy, then glances over at Snape in confusion but his Head of House seems just as confused as him as to why the Ministry Official would assume his daddy is Sirius.
Suddenly, he sees the blurry shape of the bludger come hurtling towards him for a second attack, this time aiming straight for his face —
” Draco demands in a shrill voice, his eyes wild with alarm as he cautiously approaches the window to check if the coast is clear. ”I mean
Dashing around the corner, Harry gasps in amazement as a light suddenly shines in the darkness ahead of him. There, on a plinth about a hundred yards away from him, the Triwizard Cup stands waiting for the champions to grab it… it’s serene glow giving the illusion of calm and safety as if they haven’t had to fight their way past monsters to get close to it… Harry’s knees almost buckle under him as relief surges through him. He’s safe. It’s over…
! I know what we need to do!” He exclaims and runs over to grab three of the broomsticks and hands one each to Ron and Draco before mounting his own. ”They’re not birds, they’re winged keys! We just have to find the one that will unlock that door!”
Harry feels the shiver when it passes through his boyfriend and tightens his embrace.
, so he starts walking in the opposite direction of Hogwarts.
”Yer one to talk!” Seamus huffs. ”The two of you is just as bad—”
”Harry? What’s wrong?”
”Well, me and Seamus”, Harry adds. ”I think it’s the Gryffindor halves in us…”
Remus puts his arm around Harry’s shoulders and walks with them, but they’re all stopped at the door by Madam Pomfrey who refuses to let them in.
Granger grabs a hold of the back of Ron’s shirt and gives it a hard yank, and he finally staggers back. Harry keeps his hands on his chest, just to be safe.
, but that was years ago… He eyes the wall speculatively.
Harry frowns.
“I will”, Draco mumbles, wiping at his face self-consciously and making it worse. “You two better get a move on though. Slughorn will be halfway through that fire whiskey already, if you leave it any longer he’ll have passed out by the time you get there…”
”Now, you say you’ve promised Granger to go to a party with her, as if that has some kind of significance—”
Snape’s eyes widen slightly again.
this potion is, how
Draco steps up to the table and seizes a roll of parchment, ”Look! Instructions!”
”Oh… Yeah…” Harry mutters and attempts to flatten it with one of his hands.
Harry automatically scans the faces of the other students as they walk past, but as soon as he catches a flash of white-blonde hair, he ducks his head and stares at the floor instead before he can see the look in Draco’s face, suddenly terrified to find out what emotions might be at war there, now that he knows Harry’s asked Ron to the Ball.
I’ll hex you to oblivion if you ever try to go anywhere without me ever again!”
”Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that would most likely show up in their OWLs — not much left to do actually, since they’ve already studied unicorns and nifflers — I thought we’d cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognise crups and knarls, you know…”
”There is one more present for you as well”, Remus says, changing the subject. ”When you and I go to Diagon Alley to get your school supplies, you may choose a pet to take with you to Hogwarts.”
Draco immediately grabs Harry’s hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. Harry tilts his head back and looks up at him, his smile wavering as it suddenly strikes him how much the blonde has grown over the summer.
Not wishing to waste any more time, Harry begins to swim towards the centre of the lake until he can no longer see the bottom or the shore in any direction. Then he dives into the dark depths.
”Do you then think perhaps that it might be perceived as
Harry thinks passionately.
, Harry thinks.
The students follow him at a wary pace, but they all exchange relieved looks and relax as a group when the gamekeeper veers away from the Forbidden Forest and instead leads them to an empty paddock.
”Yeah… I didn’t realise… I mean, I knew Hagrid bred them up at the Forest, but… it’s okay, they won’t harm you!”
”There you are, Ced…” he says in a loud voice, giving Harry a side-long glance. ”We were beginning to worry they’d forgotten you’re Hogwarts real champion as well…”
thinks as he retires for the night.
But Draco is right. It
Harry walks up to the mirror and Quirrell stands back to let him have a proper look. At first, there is nothing in the mirror’s reflection that shouldn’t be there. No invisible people standing behind Harry, like the last time he looked into it. Only him. Except… There is something slighty off about his face… Harry can’t be sure, of course, since he has no other means of seeing his own face, but it seems odd to him that his reflection is smirking… And also, there seems to be no streaks of tears on his face, but Harry can definitely feel the chill on his cheeks where some of the tears have yet to dry…
”I don’t know”, Draco shakes his head impatiently. ”Is it important? You said something about Father?”
”Very well”, Snape cuts in. ”We’ll have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”
kissing… it’s enough to know that they are.
”, Harry continues in an even louder voice, tears now streaming down his cheeks again. ”Because after my run-in with Quirrell and Voldemort in first year, your Patronus has been a swift instead of a wolf
”Someone just gave me these”, Harry mumbles uncertainly.
the potions we are brewing today…
”Merry Christmas, cub”, he says warmly. ”Happy with your presents so far?”
”Nothing, Harry”, Remus says. ”Don’t worry about it. It’s just… Your dad and I once knew a person who… Well, he was an animagus and he could turn into a rat, similar to your friend Ron’s pet, that’s all…”
”P-Potter!” he stammers. ”I c-c-can’t tell you how p-p-pleased I am t-to meet you!”
”I kind of does—” Harry mumbles, flinching when Draco wheels on him with a madman’s rage. ”I’m just saying, the prophecy—”
”Did he make Morfin believe he’d done it, or did Morfin lie?”
wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy! However, I felt it would be instructive to let the students see…”
”Oh.”
he thinks desperately.
He puts his glasses back on just in time to catch the blonde’s twitching smirk, before he leans in to steal a quick kiss.
”Yes, Harry”, Remus says patiently. ”But there’s a difference between people assuming something and having it stated in black on white… I don’t think Hagrid is any more eager to tell people he’s half giant, than I am to tell people I’m a werewolf…”
”I wasn’t sure I’d ever see you again.”
Harry frowns.
Maybe it’s a good thing these things don’t come with smells, Harry thinks wryly, just as Dumbledore lands next to him.
”—and on the castle grounds—”
”I hope that woman stays!” Pansy says excitedly.
”Y-Yeah”, Harry mutters and gets to his feet.
”Well, all right then”, Remus says with tired finality. ”No point in putting it off further, I suppose. So, when you’re ready, boys…”
Ducking under Peeves. Harry and Draco run for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slam into a door — but it’s locked.
Harry gives him a scandalised look and Draco huffs, rolling his eyes again. Then looks around for the shop assistant instead. Harry shuffles over to stand at the blonde’s shoulder awkwardly while he and the chipper witch launch into a discussion that is way too passionate for Harry’s liking, considering it’s about women’s perfume…
”The authorities?” Aragog repeats, his eight eyes blinking slowly.
”Well…” Blaise says drily, his smirk turning into a proper smile. ”I just saw him ask Fleur Delacour to the Ball—”
There is a subdued smatter of hand-clapping, barely audible over the chorus of snickers. Harry pinches his lips together and quickly marches to his place in the back. Draco gives him a sympathetic look, but his eyes are glittering.
”I might fly faster than you, but I might be rubbish at catching the Snitch”, Harry counters.
Draco jerks his head and pulls Harry along, swinging their arms, until they reach a cosy teashop at the end of the main street. It’s got a moss green store front and some subtle Valentine’s Day decorations floating discreetly in the windows and the name of the teashop —
… Glancing up into Professor Snape’s face, he can tell his Head of House looks sceptical as well. But Dumbledore seems satisfied with the explanation.
She promptly sits down next to Harry and stares at Ron expectantly.
Ron snickers, but Harry simply frowns.
”Draco, did you hear about that mudblood Granger?” Pansy Parkinson says eagerly.
… Given enough time to prepare, to practise, to…
The blonde’s face twitches slightly, but then he nods and hurries across the chamber and disappears through the door.
When Professor McGonagall reaches the Ms, Harry heart begins to hammer rather hard in his chest and when Draco Malfoy swaggers up to the stool, the by now familiar flutter in Harry’s belly makes itself known again and he stifles a groan. The Hat has barely touched Draco’s head when it opens its rip and shouts ”SLYTHERIN!”
”Hey, I think this is ready you know…”
”Don’t ever get physical with one of my students again”, Snape counters icily.
”Yes, yes, I will”, Remus says with a polite smile, his gaze flickering over to Harry nervously.
”Hey…” he murmurs and scrambles up the bed and curls up next to the other boy, giving him a small but reassuring smile. ”It’s okay… we’re safe here…”
”I’m not hungry”, Harry mutters sullenly.
”Yeah, me too… It says here they spent the prize money on a holiday in Egypt and will return home for the start of the school year. Maybe we could send them an owl and ask them if they would like to meet up in Diagon Alley?”
”Well, yes… yes, that’s… that’s true, but… oh come on, Harry! We all want a Hogwarts victory, after all—”
Draco doesn’t say anything for a long while, but Harry can feel the tension in the air between them. He’s just about to lean across the bed and reach for his glasses on the floor, when he hears the other boy sigh.
”I didn’t even see… You’re just… Amazing!”
And remember, the longer you talk, the longer
”Yeah, of course I do”, Harry frowns.
”Just five more minutes?”
, Harry re-reads just those words over and over, trying to make sense of it.
”You can go back to sleep soon”, Remus says. ”Your dad and I just wanted to say goodbye —”
”That is a very good question, Potter”, Snape says and then remains silent until they reach the secret doorway to the Slytherin Common Room. ”The others are surely waiting for you to tell them all about what happened tonight. I will return in exactly ten minutes to make sure everyone is in their dormitories, and anyone who
”So if Sirius and I told you we don’t approve of your relationship with Draco, what would you do?”
”Yeah…”
”Fine”, Harry grits out.
”Tut, tut… Broken wrist…” she mutters, then gently helps Neville to his feet. ”Come on, boy — it’s all right — let’s get you to the hospital wind…”
official statement…”
A long flame shoots out of the tip of Harry’s wand and hits the spider in the face. It recoils immediately and drops Harry, who crumples to the ground as his ankle twists under him and he lets out a shout as pain sears though his leg. He scrambles back and holds his wand aloft, ready to blast the spider again but it’s already scuttled away into the darkness. Harry is alone with the Triwizard Cup once more.
”Wait…” Harry says, feeling a jolt of excitement. ”How to
”No, no, I love it”, Harry says quickly. ”Really!”
Once he’s standing, he feels strangely lopsided. He swallows thickly and avoids looking down, but he feels his arm dangle heavily along his side. Don’t throw up, don’t faint and don’t throw up, he wills himself.
”, Harry says out loud, shifting his weight between his legs in a show of annoyance.
”Ron, can I talk to you? Er… in private?”
hope he fails his inspection, because
Harry whips his head around and stares in shock, as a younger and fitter Bagman takes a seat in the chair in the middle of the room. The chains remain lifeless and he sprawls out in the chair, looking exactly as relaxed and happy as Harry is used to seeing him. The only difference is in his appearance. His nose is straight still and his body taut with muscle instead of bulging with a beer gut. Harry realises he must still be in his Quidditch hay day.
”See…” Draco squeaks. ”I told you, Pans. He’s lost his mind.”
”Madam Pomfrey?” Harry says. ”Do you know what happened to Professor Quirrell?”
Harry hides his smirk behind his hand when Seamus gives him a sour look.
But his eyes are glittering intently and he fixes them on Harry like he’s trying to tell him something…
”Professor Snape says you’re from some kind of different reality, where everything is the same as here except…”
He fights the urge to look down at his scarred hand.
”Where’s… my dads?” Harry says suddenly, looking around as if expecting them to jump out of the shadows.
, he thinks.
Quirrell lets out a humorless chuckle, ”Old school feuds… Such childish incentives… And Snape thinks he can frighten me into submission, thinks he can get me on my own and bully me into spilling my master’s secrets… He doesn’t know, he doesn’t realise, that I am never alone… ever…”
”Stand back, Harry, there’s a good lad…” Remus says and gets his wand out.
”What?” Harry says again, feeling more and more nonplussed.
”Now, as a Triwizard champion, you don’t have any exams to sit and it is up to you whether you want to remain at the castle for the last four days of term and attend the End of the year feast… or whether you want to accompany your dads home this afternoon…”
”The other Harry, from the other dimension, world, whatever — do you know if he was Seeker as well?”
”Over here!” Hermione yells and waves her arm.
friends. So if you think I’m acting weird or out of character, then that’s why. I’m not…” he shakes his head again. ”I’m not going to be acting unfriendly towards you, unless you give me a reason to. Because I like you and… And anyway… Yeah.”
”I’m going for a walk”, he adds. ”Can you watch my stuff if I leave them here?”
”What do you mean?” Harry says in surprise.
Before Harry has really registered what’s happened, he’s pulled slightly off balance and immediately caught again, steadied between one of Draco’s hands on the small of his back and the other holding one of Harry’s own in a firm grip. The blonde proceeds to spin them both around with confidence, startling a gasp out of Harry who clambers to link his free arm around the taller boy’s shoulders and focus all of his remaining energy on not tripping over his own feet.
A sense of urgency flares up inside of him, like he’s running out of time and his heart begin to pound…
”He’s back…” he whispers thickly. ”You-Know-Who, he’s back…”
”The ones addressed to
Then they begin to walk. The hands have gained arn arm again and what Harry thinks must be a body, that keeps bumping into him and knocking him off balance when he’s trying to simply put one foot in front of the other. He has half a mind to tell the body and the arm and the hand that if they’re going to insist on jostling him like this, he rather walk on his own.
Harry thinks vehemently.
”I’m not ill”, Harry mutters and shakes his head. ”I think — I think it’s a warning… it means danger’s coming…”
Struck with a sudden idea, Harry grabs a new ink bottle from his trunk and then climbs onto his four-poster bed and sits cross-legged on top of the covers. Opening up the diary to a random page, he grabs one of his quills and lets a drop of ink blot the page. No sooner has the ink landed on the page than it gets soaked up by the paper and vanishes.
It made this horrible high-pitched noise—”
”He is”, the other twin says excitedly. ”Aren’t you?”
”It’s not too late to get your books by owl order”, Remus mutters for the umpteenth time.
”Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley”, Draco comments lightly, to the appreciative snickers of the other Slytherins. ”It’s almost as though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?”
Harry looks between the two of them in confusion.
”Dad, you don’t have to”, Harry says and stands up as well. ”I’ll do it, just go get daddy…”
”So, how did you kids end up in this pickle then…?” the Potions Master says, waddling over to a small side table with bottles and glasses on it in the corner of the room.
Lucius and Narcissa exchange a subtle look.
”Potter’s muggle relatives”, Harry shrugs. ”You — the Sirius and Remus of that world — they didn’t adopt him. He grew up with Lily’s sister and her family, and none of them were very happy about it by the sounds of things…
! TOFFEE! CHOCOLATE FROG!
”Drink some coffee, you’ll feel better…”
(See the end of the chapter for
”Almost”, Harry mutters and takes another large gulp of coffee before putting his glasses back on.
”Merlin’s pants!” Harry exclaims with a laugh despite himself. ”That’s just sick!”
”Leave the door open?” Remus asks from the doorway.
”He tried to get me to jump onto a desk, but I resisted and sort of jumped into it instead… Four times…”
He doesn’t get a chance to tell Draco about the barrier in King’s Cross until they’re both nestled into their respective beds, watching each other through the gloom.
”Because we’re — I mean, where you’re from, because of that, which is what you know — you think of me as — as — friends?”
brings back
… just so Madam Pomfrey can do a diagnostics spell, that’s all…”
He finds the shelf immediately, because there’s still a book-sized gap left where Hagrid must have taken his book from. Harry quickly scans the titles on either side of the gap and gapes in astonishment.
”What… what are they?” Harry says, glancing at last from the beast and seeing a hundred others standing in front of the other carriages.
”Huh…” he says and shrugs, turning towards the door and trying the handle.
”Did you ever go to bed?” He asks him warily.
Draco leans in close, his nose nudging the side of Harry’s face, murmuring quietly, ”Oh and thanks for letting me score before catching the Snitch…”
Draco’s blush deepens, but so does his glare. Harry frowns, wondering why the blonde would get angry with him —
”Good”, Snape says again. ”You can report to Filch at ten o'clock on Sunday morning. Now off to bed, both of you.”
It’s obvious on the Potions Master
”Yeah!” Diggory exclaims happily, brandishing his wand. ”So we’re doing wandless —
”How… How is this possible?” the older man murmurs thickly.
But this is it from Canon!Harry and the Canon Universe. (I know none of you will *really* miss him.. hehe)
”Have you finished packing?”
”H-Hi Hagrid…”
”How old are you now, Harry?” Voldemort asks suddenly, but without looking at him. ”Fourteen years? Fifteen? You’re in Fourth Year, I believe? That’s four years at Hogwarts, four years of…
Harry barely has time to take one last look at the house where he’s lived for as long as he can remember, before Remus is ushering him into the hall.
”So have you had a chance to ask your parents about Nicholas Flamel?” Harry asks as they make their way back to the manor.
Harry nods in agreement, but it’s too late; from either side of the corridor they can suddenly hear the rumble of footsteps and the low murmur of all the other students now making their way from the Great Hall to their dormitories, and in the next moment, hundreds of students come crashing into the passage from both ends… The noise of chatter and bustle dies suddenly, as the students stare between the hanging cat, the bloody message on the wall and the two Slytherin boys…
”No, you don’t have to”, Harry says and shrugs. ”I’ll be quick…”
Harry completely ignores Draco’s quiet hiss to
”Do you… Want to… Talk about it?” he asks uncertainly.
”But…”
Holding his hand up idly, he examines the evidence of what he’s just done as it cools on his skin…
”You stay out of this!”
trying
”Yes, Sir”, Harry sighs.
”Is this for real?” Draco hisses.
Harry thinks and silently curses himself for being so careless…
As they reach the shore, Remus wraps big fluffy blankets around both of them, then sits with Harry and rubs his arms furiously until they start to fill up with blood again. Weirdly enough, the stronger the sensation of pins and needles in his arms get, the more violently Harry shakes…
course of defensive magic this year…
Harry quickly jumps back from the door and moves aside just in time before it bursts open and the house-elf comes hurtling into the corridor with a pained squeal, followed by a furious-looking Lucius Malfoy.
The rumours about Hagrid being part giant has already spread throughout the castle, but the gamekeeper himself haven’t been spotted since the Yule Ball and when Harry and the other Slytherins make their way down to his hut for their first Care Of Magical Creatures lesson of the spring term, it isn’t the half-giant who is waiting for them but an elderly witch with close-cropped grey hair and a stern expression to rival that of McGonagall’s.
Feeling a thrill of excitement and pride, Harry turns to smile at his daddy, but Remus is still staring at the lake and looking anything but pleased… Sirius however crouches down next to Harry and gives him an encourageing smile and a wink, before thumping him on the back.
”Oh, it’s good” Seamus says. ”There’s this one group called
”I only found out about it recently myself”, Sirius says.
he thinks,
Diggory is pacing along the far side of the tent, looking tense and troubled but he gives Harry a small, pinched smile when he sees him, before he starts pacing again.
”Come to think about it… I think I’ve seen noses like yours down the village…” Gaunt says, his lips curling in distaste.
”BLACK! I’M SERIOUS, YOU GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!” Snape screams as he comes pelting down the stairs. ”I am
Harry whips his head around and nearly groans as he sees Gilderoy Lockhart striding towards them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him and his teeth gleaming.
”Come on, get up, get up,
”I know. I get it.”
”Truth is, Harry… I look at you now and I don’t see a little boy anymore, I see a young man and I know it shouldn’t matter, because you’ll always be mine and Remus’s boy, even when you’re old and grey, but I just… I just don’t know what to say to you sometimes… it was so much easier when you were little, you asked simpler questions and when you were sad, or scared, all I had to do was lift you up and spin you around like that… I can hardly do that now, can I…"
”I am going to try and break into your mind”, Snape says softly. ”You… are going to try and stop me… you may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of.”
Harry glances around the classroom to see his classmates progress. Draco is already on to the next step, trying to cut into his Sopophorous Beans. It looks like they’re putting up quite the fight, slipping under the blade of the blonde’s knife. Harry can see that the other students who are slightly ahead of him are having the same problem. Granger is getting increasingly frustrated, her beans slipping and shooting across the desk as though trying to escape her knife.
”No”, Harry mumbles.
”Blast-Ended Skrewts!” Hagrid says proudly, pointing at the crate nearest to him. ”Oh, all righ’ then, if the Slytherins are late it’s their funeral — go on then, gather ’round—!”
”I did, but they need me to come in, just for a second… something’s come up, and you know I can’t talk about it but… it shouldn’t take too long, so I was thinking, I could either drop you off at Grimmauld Place, I think the Weasleys are there—”
you wanted me sent home
Harry ignores them both. Anger is beginning to boil under his skin.
”Enough already, he’s right”, Draco mutters.
”You mustn’t blame yourself”, Pansy says firmly.
”Just an expression, Professor! — OH! — Malfoy ducks another Bludger, bloody hell — but there Fred Weasley’s got him—!”
”What… happened…?” Snape asks them both in his stoniest tone of voice.
Voldemort lets out a small, cold laugh.
”Go work on your essay, Potter”, Snape says with an exasperated eye-roll and gives him a dismissive flick of his hand before turning his attention back to the textbook and obviously ignoring him.
Harry laughs wetly and leans back enough to plant a sloppy kiss on the other boy’s lips.
At least now he’s not completely alone anymore. But as cool as the Gryffindors have all turned out to be, Harry still wishes he was with his own friends. And especially Draco.
and he catches the ripple of restless movement amongst the Death Eaters. Here is the last piece of a puzzle, Harry just knows it. Unfortunately he hasn’t seen the other pieces, or at least not all of them so this one means nothing to him.
”Those are all things that you could find out—”
”Hey”, Harry echoes politely, giving the girl a pinched smile as well.
”But now it’s illegal”, Draco insists. ”It’s actually
In the end, he ends up ticking all the same subjects as Draco, figuring if he doesn’t care about the subjects anyway, he might as well pick ones in which he knows he’ll have the blonde for company.
It’s still fairly light out, but the air definitely gets chillier and since he left without his cloak or his jumper, he begins to feel cold. For a moment he considers staying out for a bit longer anyway, the thought of returning to the red and gold wrongness that now seems to be his life almost too miserable to bear. But halfway through the moment, a particularly vicious gust of wind whacks him in the face and sends his shirt flapping frantically around his body. He takes a deep breath and a subtle shiver accompanies it on the way out again.
He sits up, staring out into the darkness and seeing nothing.
”Potter,
Ludo Bagman appears at his shoulder suddenly and whisks him away, steering him into position along the water’s edge ten feet from Krum. Harry can tell the older boy’s eyes are hard with focus and he’s got his wand clutched tightly in his hand, ready at his side.
”Where are you going, Harry?” Remus asks lightly, but the intense look in his eye doesn’t dim.
Harry frowns, feeling slightly perturbed. It’s one thing for his friends and family, and even Snape, to be concerned about him. But Bagman is an Ministry Official.
A sudden sharp pain explodes on Harry’s forehead and shoots into his skull as everything goes black —
Harry wants nothing more than to run and throw himself at his daddy, but he forces himself to walk slowly and calmly across the room. When he reaches the sofa, Remus grabs his hand and guides him to sit down next to him and Harry eagerly cuddles into his side. He can feel the man’s chapped lips brush his forehead in a gentle butterfly kiss before his nose dips into his hair and inhales his scent…
He trudges down the stone steps towards the Fifth Year boys’ dorm and more or less collapses on top of his four-poster. His persistent headache keeps tapping against his skull and pushing on his eyes, from the inside, making it impossible for him to actually fall asleep, but the semi-darkness and the quiet allows the tension pain to at least simmer down, so that by the time he joins the others in the Great Hall for dinner he feels less like the walking and grumpy dead, and more like the tired Fifth Year that he is.
”The third floor corridor, you know, guarded by that three-headed dog”, he insists.
”His grandfather”, Draco mumbles, fingertips grazing the embossed letters of the main author’s name. ”This is meant to be the best, most comprehensive textbook of wandlore.”
”A bad idea, Professor Lockhart”, Snape murmurs maliciously and glides over to the other man. ”Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest of spells. We’ll be sending what’s left of Mr Weasley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox… How about a couple of students from my own house… Potter, Malfoy!”
She trots over to him and places a long, black quill next to the piece of parchment on the table.
He rolls his eyes.
He feels Draco’s arm curl around his shoulders and gratefully leans into him.
He drops back down to the ground and whistles for the others to join him. As soon as he’s got everyone’s attention again, he divides them into three groups of ten and asks each group to race each other around the pitch. He watches with a wince as a few Second Years, literally left in the wake of the older students, struggle to get control of their brooms and end up crashing into each other. The older students make it all the way around the pitch, but even the winner does it in a time that’s good enough, in Harry’s opinion.
”It’s not what you think…” Draco says quietly after a moment’s tense silence. ”I don’t think I’m fat or anything, I just don’t like to feel full… That’s all…”
”Hey…” Harry says again, rubbing his back gently. ”What’s brought this on?”
”—We are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
he tells himself sternly.
Riddle’s right eye twitches, and there’s definitely a red gleam in them now… But Harry isn’t so scared anymore. Maybe it’s the comforting weight of the phoenix on his shoulder, or maybe he’s gone so far beyond scared that he doesn’t even feel it anymore, but he just feels light… Numb and empty… But warm at the same time. Hopeful. Strong.
, sending several cards flying.
”Good, good”, Remus shouts. ”It’s getting confused! Keep going, keep going!”
The other man nods quickly before giving Harry one quick hug, then jumps back onto the platform before the steam enginge starts to pick up speed. Harry hurries over to the now closed door and leans out of the open window to wave at his two fathers. They both wave back enthusiastically.
Harry blinks startled and swallows. Just sitting this closely to Draco is enough to make his stomach flutter, especially when the blonde leans in to whisper in his ear like this and Harry can feel his warm breath against his skin, not to mention the whiff of coconut… But at the same time, he’s still a bit rattled by their latest sexual escapade, sure that the next time they disrobe and get physical with each other, Draco will want to take things to the next level… And as much as the thought of that arouses Harry, it also scares the shit out of him and he’s almost sure he isn’t ready for it quite yet — he just doesn’t know how to tell Draco that… What if he feels rejected and hurt? What if he feels frustrated? What if he gets angry?
”No — come on!” Hagrid protests feebly, his bruised forehead glistening with sweat now. ”I mean, a dog’ll bite yeh if yeh bait it, won’ it? — but thestrals ’ave jus’ got a bad reputation ’cause of the death thing!”
”What happened…?” he says shakily.
”No, I’m sure he’s in another compartment, that’s all…” Harry mumbles uncomfortably.
”I would like that…” Harry mumbles again.
” Harry says loudly.
”Oh, hello, Harry”, the half-giant says glumly. ”And Malfoy. Happy Valentine’s Day…”
”N-no, it’s okay”, he squeaks. ”I-It was my f-fault—”
Great, Harry thinks, glancing at the large creatures again. They look less and less beautiful as Hagrid talks, he thinks. Especially when they toss their heads and flap their massive wings. They really don’t seem to like being tethered at all…
”NOTHING!” all the Weasleys say in unison.
Swirling around, Harry sees Crabbe and Goyle’s dress robes are both green as well, but a very dark forest green and not nearly as luminous as Harry’s. Theodore’s are a nice, subtle midnight blue and Draco’s, he knows, are made from black velvet —
Harry arches his back in a languorous stretch and kicks his duvet off as a yawn slowly splits his face in two. He rubs his eyes thoroughly, before feeling around on the floor for his spectacles, knuckles bumping books and fingers getting tangled in dirty clothes.
With a sigh, he pushes himself to his feet and stumbles across the floor of his bedroom and out into the hall.
”Yeah”, Harry nods. ”I’ve been thinking that, too…”
”What?” Harry asks.
heard as much… still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe?”
”Just because they’re not very pretty doesn’t mean they’re not useful”, Granger says haughtily. ”Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you!”
As it is, Draco doesn’t speak to him all day, which is equal parts annoying and heartbreaking, but at least they get most of their homework done… and Harry has learned by now that if he sticks close to the blonde, but keeps a low profile and just lets him stew in quiet, he will cool down eventually. And he does this time too.
”Er…”
”Yes, of course”, Dumbldore says. ”I daresay the kitchens can whip up enough chocolate to go around… But first, if you don’t mind, I would like a word with the two of you in private?”
Before Harry can say anything else, the doors to the Hospital Wing swing open and he turns his head to see Dumbledore stride inside, his mauve robes glittering with golden stars and crescent moons embroidered into the silky fabric.
”Come on, I’ve made your favourite…”
Severus gives him a curt nod and then proceeds to spin on his heal and sweep out of the office again without so much as a look in Harry’s direction.
…” Blaise mutters.
”Oh — what —” Zacharias Smith stutters. ”Is he—?”
suddenly pops out from the text and he looks at the accompanying photograph instead. A grin immediately splits his face in two as he looks at the whole Weasley clan, waving happily at him from the picture.
Harry nods in understanding over his shoulder, then lurches forward and gives the blonde a quick hug. He breaks away again just as quickly, before the boy has a chance to hug back or pull away, and hurries over to where the others are standing.
”See the Tornados win”, Harry chimes in.
He flicks his wand and Harry can hear a creaking sound from the sitting room behind him and assumes a door has been opened.
”I — I — I didn’t, it wasn’t me, I —” Harry mumbles, gripping the taller boy desperately.
Harry blinks, hesitating.
”I’m getting private lessons in something called Occlumency this term… Dumbledore’s idea—”
crushing
”As soon as the students have been safely evacuated—”
”It’s
”Mmm…” Harry mumbles, turning his face into his pillow.
”Hey, sleepy head…” he hears Draco say teasingly.
”Thank Merlin for Lily”, Remus continues with a sad smile, mirrored by his husband.
When his surroundings regain their focus around him, Harry is once again kneeling on the floor and this time he feels like his brain itself has been battered and brusied from someone trying to physically remove it from his skull and his chest is tight, his lungs squeezed together and he has to gasp for breath.
”Ehm — maybe — I don’t know — a Prefect?”
Draco noses at the nape of his neck and he smiles widely, turning over inside the warm, safe confines of his boyfriend’s embrace. He blinks his eyes open, squinting at the blurry outlines of the other boy’s face and feels his smile widen even further.

He’s walking through the Common Room, he’s
Remus bites his lip, throwing a furtive glance in Draco’s direction.
”My dear”, Trelawny says, fluttering her shawls around her impatiently. ”You were undoubtedly affected by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room, if you leave you may lose the opportunity to see further—”
”Hey!” Ron says, shooting his brothers a disgruntled glare.
Harry shoots him a glare, ”You’re not hearing me! I did it, I established the connection, Sir! But that — that —
”No. I’m not.”
”—Just tap it again and say
He finally come to a thundering stop outside Professor Snape’s office and leans back against the wall as he catches his breath.

signs. No Death Eaters or Dark Lords, but…
This year, however, feels nothing but bitter. Harry is in a mood before he’s even opened his eyes and any hint of excitement that might have been is entirely overpowered, not by melancholy so much as dread and then, of course, there is his new pet monster of rage and jealousy, which is refusing to go back into hibernation and instead continues to coil tensely in the pit of his stomach. Every so often, it lets out puffs of fire, like warning sparks fired from a wand, that surges up Harry’s insides like heartburn.
Harry grins excitedly and bounds after him as he begins to lead the way through the house.
The Gryffindor team is already waiting for them in the middle of the pitch, next to the Quidditch teacher Madam Hooch, in her judging robes. As the Slytherin team joins them, she instructs Flint and Oliver Wood to shake hands, which they do reluctantly, but once they’re gripping the other’s hand they seem to be squeezing a lot harder than necessary.
They all finish eating in record time. Even Draco, although he is the last of them to put his spoon down, is done long before most of the students at the next table. Harry glances over at Professor Snape, who is still picking his way through whatever he’s having for breakfast and he decides to top up his coffee since they all need to wait for their Head of House to hand out the timetables anyway.
Sure, the first two subjects are his favourites, but he doubts he’ll enjoy DADA as much this year as he has done for the previous two years, and as much as he’s begun to genuinely enjoy Potions, it’s still one of the hardest subjects and definitely not something he wants to have to tackle on a Monday morning — especially not when he’s barely had a wink of sleep the night before!
The wail definitely had a screechy quality to it, but there was something about it that sounded distorted as well, like the noise had been filtered through water somehow… and whenever his daddy told him stories about banshees, he always got the feeling theirs was more of a tinny shriek, and more high-pitched… of course, no-one can no for sure what a banshee sounds like and live to tell the tale, so for all Harry knows
”What the —?”
Horror-struck, Harry stumbles away from the desk. Snape’s eyes narrow suspiciously and he twitches with what might have been an impulse to catch Harry who for a second seemed to have lost his balance, but he quickly gets his feet back under him and before Snape has had a chance to react, he launches himself forward and grabs the potion out of his hand and hurtles out of the office.
”Erm, yeah, maybe later”, he says. ”I’m just going to go see my daddy quickly, okay?”
”Nothing…” the blonde says with sniff.
Subconsciously, Harry pulls to a stop next to the cauldron and inhales deeply, relieved to have the sour, bitter stench of Polyjuice replaced with sweet aroma of this potion.
”I have a theory… but it’s only a theory…”
”Yeah, so what are we going to do?” Draco says again.
that?” he says, slapping his free hand over his nose and mouth.
”Come, Viktor!” Karkaroff says and storms out of the chamber, sneering at Moody as he shoves past him.
”What’s — what’s going on?” he says.
Harry looks around at the other beds to make sure the other boys are sleeping, then walks over and sits down at the foot of Draco’s bed and tells him everything.
Harry nods.
Although, even if he’d stayed up and celebrated with them and was nursing a hangover because of it, Harry knows the other boy would still be up by now. Draco is always an early riser and never late for anything…
”Oh yeah sure”, Harry snaps. ”Unless of course they decide not to tell me anything! Everyone seems to think I can’t be trusted with informaton anyway — not even information that is about me, about my life, about the future, information that might be the difference between life and death depending on if I have it—!”
while Harry and Remus have been talking, and he smoothes it out on top of the table, turning it so that Harry can read the article.
, Harry wonders with a frown.
” Harry says incredulously.
”Harry, what are we —?”
”Be safe, I know”, Harry cuts in with a smile.
”Presumably”, Snape mutters.
”Oh, sweethearts, are you?” Mrs Finnigan says, handing them each a cup of steaming hot tea. ”Isn’t that lovely… I’ve tried asking Seamus if he’s sweet on anyone, but he refuses to tell me!”
”That’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now, Harry”, he says in a mock-stern voice. ”It just won’t do, m’boy.”
to get caught, there’s no way the Ministry could justify firing a professor who’s worked at Hogwarts for over a decade, providing excellent results for the most part, just because a handful of the students in his house were caught performing an essentially harmless prank.”
”Some of you handed in acceptable essays and were graded accordingly, but the general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week’s essay on various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a ’D’ in the future…”
”That’s not true!” Draco says stubbornly, and Harry rolls his eyes. ”Whatever. And I know he’s our Head of House, and although I’m pretty sure he really hates me deep down, he’s obviously doing his best not to show it —”
If Draco lost any sleep or remembers their talk —
Maybe it’s because he’d imagined so much worse, but the dinner turns out to be quite pleasant. Harry isn’t even aware of any tension at all, until he’s halfway through replying to one of Narcissa’s polite, standard questions and he notices the woman’s gaze flit away from him before narrowing at something in front of Draco on the table… Harry trails off and follows her line of sight to Draco’s plate and catches him move his food around idly, as is his custom.
”The window was open!” Harry says, remembering the moment just before he fell asleep, watching that bug flit back and forth on the other side of the glass.
Swallowing his fear, Harry turns back around. Keenly aware of Umbridge’s suspicious glare, he asks the Potions Master for a word in private.
”I… I thought you said…” Harry mumbles and looks down to see himself unmistakably hard still.
As Diggory disappears through the side door, the noise finally dies down again and the Hufflepuffs resume their seats.
”You need to get your emotions under control, Harry”, Professor Snape says firmly. ”As awkward as the situation may be, Diggory is now technically your teacher and you need to treat him as such.”
Harry gives him a tight smile and reaches for the rice pudding, only then noticing Ron Weasley in the seat opposite him, bookended by the twins, all of them wearing matching jumpers with big, golden letters on the front. Ron’s has an R, presumably for ”Ron” and the twins have a G and an F on theirs.
”Ludo Bagman did?” Remus says. ”But he’s one of the judges, he’s not supposed to be partial —”
He startles halfway through a figure eight and wheels around. Ludo Bagman is coming out of the Three Broomsticks, waving his arm excitedly at Harry. Feeling really stupid at having been caught playing in the snow like a little kid, Harry tries to look as mature as possible as he waves back awkwardly.
”You’ve made excellent progress already”, he tells Harry as they stop for a lunch break and Harry beams at the compliment. ”I believe you’re ready to start trying to put your skills to the test.”
last summer without even really looking at it…
He’s finally told his friends all about it, but he hasn’t done much to actually get the memory from Slugorn. His friends all agreed that a slower approach would be better, rather than make the old man paranoid by just coming out and asking for it since he’s clearly gone to great lengths to conceal whatever the real memory contains. Pansy in particular made the argument that Harry should befriend Slughorn first, lull him into a false sense of security and
”— good maneouvre by Malfoy there, he’s ferreted his way past another Bludger and he’s got the Quaffle, he’s — oh, hang on! — looks like Potter has spotted the Snitch!” Jordan shouts. ”And McLaggen is close on his tail, but I don’t think —”
”They’re grey.”
”Oh, don’t be such a toff… I bet you bring snacks when you go to a Quidditch game?”
”We’ll see you soon”, Remus says, stealing another hug.
” Ron and Hermione exclaim.
The witch gives him a pained look, but Harry can bring himself to watch as his daddy reacts to the truth so screws his eyes shut again and grips the hand on top of his chest.
angry with his dad for not letting him tag along to his office. Ever since he was a little boy, he’s known that his dad is an Unspeakable and therefore can’t tell him or Remus anything about his job, or he’ll be fired quicker than a hex in the cheering sections of a Tornados-Cannons match. If anything, Harry’s annoyed with himself for choosing to come along to the Ministry in the first place, knowing he wouldn’t be allowed into the Department of Mysteries anyway, so he’d be stuck waiting for his dad in some boring place (like Weasley Senior’s broom cupboard of an office or an even more boring corridor!)
”And what do you want?” Remus asks kindly. ”You said you want to get a Mastery, so you’ve obviously thought about it…”
”Moony…” Sirius says in his most patient voice from his own seat at the table. ”Calm down —”
…” Harry says.
Remus puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder and gives him a questioning look.
The silence in the room slowly morphs into something a little sharper around the edges.
”What?” he asks warily.
in the dorm is wrong. Bright and
Suddenly the pain stops again, although his arms and legs continue to spasm for several long seconds and the ropes restraining him dig into his body painfully. He blinks his eyes open to see Voldemort lowering his wand… except, it’s not Voldemort standing in front of him anymore. It’s Lucius.
”All right, all right”, Sirius says. ”I’m only teasing, Harry.”
Death Eater hurling them at him, so he’d been sure they’d kill him… But then he managed to grip the doorhandle behind his back and before he really knew what had happened, the door swung open and then… Then he was falling.
As much fun as he’d had with Ron during dinner and that first dance the night before, overall the Yule Ball turned into quite the fiasco and his cunning plan to light a fire under Draco by making him jealous, had backfired like the back end of a Blast-Ended Skrewt… Now he just wants to find a quiet corner to lick his burn wounds. Luckily he’s been given special permission to visit Hogsmeade today, so that he can go home and celebrate a late Christmas with his dads — his absolute favourite corner in the world, for wound-licking as well as everything and anything else — and he can’t get out of Hogwarts quickly enough.
Strolling closer to Harry once more, Voldemort stands astride the crack in his father’s grave. His eyes burning with what Harry can only assume is hatred, because his scar bursts open once more and his eyes fill with tears. He grinds his teeth together, to keep the screams from escaping, not wanting to give Voldemort the pleasure…
”Fine, we don’t have to go to Dumbledore”, Draco says. ”But let’s go tell Snape at least…”
Wormtail collapses on the floor with a blood-curdling scream, his whole body convulsing in violent spasms that reminds Harry briefly of the spider in Defence Against the Dark Arts, before his scar suddenly bursts open and he can’t think of anything but the pain and Wormtail’s screams anymore… the screams grow higher and higher… Harry is screaming too… he can’t help it, the pain is too much… Voldemort will hear him and know he’s right here, he’ll kill him… but it doesn’t matter, because he can’t keep the screams in —
”Oh, all right, then… For a bonus point…” the little old man says, squinting happily.
”It wasn’t Draco”, Harry says and shrugs uncomfortably.
”Or rather, he talked and I listened. It wasn’t exactly a discussion.”
With Seeker instinct, he ducks his head just in time to avoid getting hit with an ink bottle. It smashes against the doorframe behind him and he feels the wet splatter of ink hit the back of his head and ear.
”Eager though I know all of you are to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts”, Dumbledore continues after a moment of letting the news sink in and the students all fall silent once more and give him their full attention. ”The Heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age — that is to say, seventeen years or older — are allowed to put forward their names for consideration—”
”Look, it wasn’t personal, I just needed Umbridge to give me detention”, he tells them roughly. ”We don’t want to
”I’ll be honest”, Sirius adds wryly, combing his fingers through his husband’s hair. ”I was a bit relieved. If he had turned into literally anything else, then
, then he wouldn’t be angry with Draco for doing it, Draco had apparently taken to mean that he was now allowed to tease, pester and psychologically terrorise Ron and anyone else on the Gryffindor team as much as he wanted, during the week leading up to the first match of the year because he takes every opportunity to cause the Gryffindors grief.
, for lack of a better term, to the only living thing in that room…
”Writing?” Harry asks nonplussed.
With feign interest written all over her immaculately made up face, Ms Skeeter nods eagerly as Hagrid continues to talk, his enthusiasm from earlier returning full force, and Harry
”Your
”I know”, Harry sighs.
”There”, Madam Pomfrey says and lifts her wand away.
”Who? Where?” He asks, already striding towards the Common Room.
he begins to shake his head and opens his mouth to speak, but his daddy hushes him gently once more.
”He is a
”Yeah, remember your tea leaves, Harry…”
”Nevertheless…” Remus mutters.
They continue deeper and deeper into the forest until the path is almost impossible to make out because the trees get so thick and close together. They can see some unicorn blood splattered on the roots of an oak, as if the poor creature has been thrashing around in pain.
”Okay, my turn!” Harry calls out after a while.
”Hello, hello!” Bagman exclaims.
he finds himself thinking at it.
Another loud
Sirius looks crestfallen and Harry quickly looks down to keep his resolve.
”Hey everyone”, Granger says in an overtly dignified voice, obviously ignoring Pansy’s catlike behaviour and instead focusing her attention on Harry and Draco sitting next to her. ”Hi Draco, Harry…”
”Come on, your presents are in the kitchen…” Remus says and stands up again. ”Draco, will you help me cut the cake?”
”—We’d let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason—”
”Still not getting my answer…”
Feeling his eyes sting, Harry blinks miserably and hangs his head even heavier, until the back of his neck begins to ache from the strain.
After only a few minutes in the air, he already feels better… He’s still shaken up about everything, but for the first time in what feels like forever he doesn’t feel like he’s carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. He keeps flying along the edge of the forest for about an hour and a half, judging by the movement of the waning gibbous moon over the night sky, before he decides to head back to the dorm. He lands smoothly on the lawn and moves stealthily towards the castle through the darkness, not daring to light his wand until he’s inside.
As if making up for lost time, Draco plasters himself to Harry’s side for the rest of the evening, even as they talk to different people, but Harry doesn’t mind the warmth of the other boy’s body along his side at all but rather welcomes it. Especially after spending an hour in the ice cold waters of the Dark Lake.
The other boy’s lithe body moves in waves under him, undulating eagerly against his own and every time their erections grind together currents of pleasure shoot through Harry — and yet, what really sends him over the edge, is the thought of his jumper rubbing against Draco’s naked torso; the rough texture scratching that pale, smooth skin and leaving it blotchy and pink, ruining that perfection, marking it as
Harry honestly doesn’t know what he is, but he nods anyway.
Draco’s eyes widen in alarm.
”Now we shall know… who will be brave enough to return… and who will be foolish enough to stay away…”
Harry snaps his head back around and looks at Dumbledore sharply.
”Who’s that sitting next to Flit—?” Daphne starts to speak until her voice is suddenly drowned out by what sounds like a stampeding herd of hippogriffs, but turns out to be the First Years, lead by Professor McGonagall.
Draco smirks and shakes his head, pulling on his hand slightly.
”Y-Y-You … d-don’t know… how t-t-to… swim…?”
”Yes!” Harry exclaims.
Draco holds out his mug of coffee and Harry gratefully accepts it, taking a mouthful just to get rid of the grainy taste in his mouth.
”Want to go explore the campsite?” Harry says eagerly.
Harry has put his Animagi potion away on a bookshelf in his and Draco’s bedroom for now. Draco had practically been bouncing on his feet with excitement when he first took the phial out of his pocket on their first day back, then quickly deflated in disappointment when Harry put it away. But he’s decided to wait until after Christmas to drink it and perform the final spell, because he just wants to enjoy the Christmas preparations and this time with his family for now.
”Look sharp, Tom”, Slughorn says. ”You don’t want to be caught out of bed after hours, what with you being a Prefect and all…”
”, Draco mutters and ducks his head. ”I just mean… I’ll miss you…”
”Okay… if you’re sure…”
angry, Harry thinks.
A moment later, Sirius returns to the lounge with two Aurors trailing after him. They remain standing just inside the doorway, even as Sirius and Dumbledore resume their seats around the coffee table, but politely accepts when Remus offers them a cup of tea. He grabs the tea pot and brushes past them out of the room, muttering about being right back and the Aurors nod and smile politely at him, before turning back to stare at Harry seriously.
”Behave”, Draco mutters under his breath and she gives him a subtle eyeroll. ”One hour.”
”PEEVES!” they hear her holler almost as soon as she’s disappeared out of sight, and there is a collective sigh of relief in the Hall, because as annoying as the Poltergeist can doubtlessly be, he never poses any real danger.
”And brave? Sir?”
”Ehm… Okay…” Diggory says uncertainly. ”What’s up?”
He watches the girl’s gaze flicker over his shoulder and small frown form on her face. She emits a low grunt.
”Mister Weasley!” Snape snaps.
my son’s life will be put in jeopardy as long as I have anything to say about it… Are you going to challenge that, Albus?” he adds sharply.
He grabs Draco’s hand and drags him towards the front door, pausing next to the staircase only to call up to Remus that they’ll be in the garden for a while.
”Must… tell… Dumbledore”, Mr Crouch gasps quietly, his fingers finally falling away from Harry’s robes front and he crumbles to the ground again. ”All my… fault… have to tell… Dumbledore…”
Harry stares in horror as the unmistakable sheen of tears well up in the other boy’s eyes.
”That wouldn’t matter”, Draco says. ”All it would take is a split second… But maybe…”
”How…” Harry croaks. ”How do you know?”
”Are you calling me predictable?”
Quirrell wheels around to face Harry again, and once again the pain in Harry’s forehead fades to a dull throb.
”If you do get hungry—”
?” He sneers. ”To business… Twice — in
”Did you not understand my note, Professor Snape?” Umbridge asks, without coughing first.

fighting?” Snape clarifies, and his dark eyes flicker over to Moody silently.
”I know, I know”, Harry says hurriedly. ”I didn’t mean it like that.
Everyone’s eyes flit over to the shadowed corner where he’s still standing. The air feels dense around them suddenly. Harry feels it seep into his lungs, but instead of filling them with oxygen it seems to weigh them down.
The end of the school year can’t come soon enough, he thinks heavily. Now that he’s ruined any chance of ever being happy in this version of Hogwarts, he just wants to leave.
He struggles to get back up on his feet after having collapsed on all four for the third time, but his knees buckle under him and he falls back down.
to save the day!”
Harry glances over at him, but still doesn’t say anything. Draco huffs and rolls his eyes, then tells everyone about how he’d followed Harry down to the Chamber and when Harry fought the basilisk, he dragged Ginny to safety.
”You have us”, Draco reminds him firmly.
”Besides we already know who the new Defense teacher is”, Blaise reminds him. ”We’ve just told you. Professor Slughorn.”
”Yes”, Harry croaks. ”Krum and I, we both grabbed it together… we wanted to tie… we didn’t know…”
”Well, I… I’ll just explain… it…” Harry trails off awkwardly, shivering as cold sweat breaks out over his skin and chills him.
… A particularly cold breeze hits him and he shivers, hugging himself…
he thinks in relief. It’s soft, but he can definitely feel the patter of a pulse.
”Yeah, I remember”, he says quickly and hopes it sounds convincing.
”I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
”We got… sidetracked”, Draco says with a smirk.
Harry gives it another few minutes, then carefully leans forward to check if the coast is clear.
But before he can even open his mouth to protest, Lockhart has shouldered past him and blasted the snake several feet into the air. But instead of vanishing, it lands heavily on the floor again and doesn’t look too happy about it either… It raises itself up and opens its jaws wide and hisses furiously… Disorientated and enraged, it turns on the nearest student, who happens to be a paralysed-looking Justin Finch-Fletchly, and bares its sharp fangs —
”Like Quirrell would have been much help if the troll shows up!” Seamus says.
”So…” Harry says slowly, tearing his eyes away from the ring again and staring up into the headmaster’s face again. ”That old man… That was—?”
He’s not surprised when Draco joins him in bed within minutes of him curling up under the duvet. But it’s not until the other boy hugs him from behind and Harry feels himself go limp in the embarce, that Harry realises how tense he’d been.
”What? Snape snaps.
”—But I don’t want you to think that that makes it okay for you to disregard the rules and what we tell you, Harry.”
Professor Snape is there.
, please… there will be no need to talk…”
”What?” Harry turns to the other boy with a frown.
They enter a small, dim room and Riddle slides the door almost shut then stands stock still, staring out the tiny crack left between the door and the frame… Harry watches his back tensely for a long moment, but after a while, with nothing happening, he starts to get bored and restless, wanting to return to the present and his bed…
He blinks his eyes open in surprise and stares out into the gloom. He doesn’t know where that thought had come from, but as soon as it popped into his head, he just knew it was the truth.
”Of course, my Lord, of course… you are merciful,
was. That’s why
Harry and Ron climbs into one of the boats and is followed by Neville and Hermione, much to Ron’s chagrin. Harry discretely looks around for a sign of blonde hair in the gloom, but it’s too dark to make much of anything out.
It’s Harry’s turn to chuckle.
He hears the door behind them swing open again and throws himself sideways, scrambling under the nearest desk and Draco hurries to crawl in after him.
”But he’s underage! He’s—!”
”I’ll walk you to the Common Room. Let’s go.”
”Hah!” Sirius mutters almost triumphantly.
Sirius crouches down in front of him and puts a hand on top of his shoulder that weighs Harry down even more and he staggers a little under it.
They told him Draco was in the dorms and fine — but they were all acting so strangely that Harry isn’t sure he can believe them… He really rather see for himself.
”He can”, Professor Snape says. ”If his horcrux is destroyed first.
”M-Myrtle…” she answers, with a childish giggle.
”For a short stretch only”, Fudge says hurriedly, avoiding the half-giant’s glossy eyes. ”Not a punishment, you understand, just — just as a precaution!”
Harry sinks down next to Draco on the sofa with a sigh and can feel the blonde tense up next to him. He rubs his forehead wearily, telling him all about the Pensieve and the memory Dumbledore had him witness.
Remus arms tighten around him and he shoves his face into the crook of his neck. Harry can feel the wetness of tears from his face as they smear against his own skin.
Taking a deep breath, Harry tells Draco everything — skipping over the part where he more or less swooned over Riddle’s good looks, obviously — and by the end of the story, Draco’s eyes are round as saucers and his breathing shallow…
”He did it!” Filch spits, his blotched face darkening furiously. ”You saw what he wrote on the wall —!”
Remus raises his eyebrows in surprise, ”You want to help me cook?”
A jet of red light shoots out of Harry’s wand and connects with the jet from Voldemort’s — green like Harry’s nightmares — and suddenly, Harry feels his wand begin to vibrate violently in his hand. He quickly lifts his other hand to help steady it.
, Harry thinks with a jolt.
”Sorry”, Harry mumbles again.
”How do you know she was in London?” Harry interrupts curiously and only adds a
”I’m fine thanks”, Harry mutters to Seamus who snickers.
Draco.
he thinks.
”Come on, let’s get out of here…” Harry murmurs to the others.
”Harry…”
He gestures towards the door of his daddy’s office, knowing that his sleeping quarters are situated in an adjoining room accessed through the office itself.
He quickly steps back again and even though he tries to remain stern, there is no mistaking the softness around his shining eyes. Harry grins back, but says nothing. He doesn’t have the words to express what he’s feeling right now… Adrenaline is still coursing through his system, his legs slightly shaky from it and his chest tight with emotion and still he feels incredibly light… so light in fact that, if his daddy’s hand on his shoulder wasn’t weighing him down, he might just soar away again, even without his broom… the noise from the audience reaches an almost deafening level and as he looks up at the hundreds upon hundreds of grinning faces, he feels so overwhelmed he doesn’t even know what to think…
”Hiya Harry”, he says, when he catches Harry staring at him.
”Er… Could I have that again… Ehm… More slowly?”
”Good night, Harry…”
”Yes. I don’t want to cause a rift between you and your parents. So you do what you have to do and I’ll… I’ll ask someone else to the Ball…”
”No”, Draco says shortly, his lips never even twitching. ”It’s just… my father…”
They eat in companionable silence, making eyes at each other every once in a while. By the time they’ve finished their eggs, the parchment the witch by the window is writing on has reached the floor and is inching across the aisle between the two seating areas of the teashop, much to the shopkeeper’s annoyance when he has to step over it to collect Harry’s and Draco’s plates.
”I didn’t say anything”, Draco says immediately, but his eyes keep glittering madly at her.
But it’s not until he covers his eyes with a trembling hand that Harry realises that his daddy is actually crying. Without thinking about it, he rounds the desk in three quick strides and then, curling up like a pretzel, he burrows into the man’s arms and clambers up into his lap. Remus immediately throws both arms around him and buries his face into his hair and breathes in deeply. Then tightens his embrace even more.
”I think they might be ter suck blood”, he says, sounding as excited as Seamus when he’s gushing over the muggle sport of football, and receiving a similarly nonplussed reaction from his audience as well.
”, Harry reminds him.
There is a sudden tumult as heavy, squishy objects tumble through the overhead candles and land with loud
The other two boys seem less interested in his stories after that, exchanging a meaningful with each other that makes Harry feel exactly like the scum he thinks they probably see him as. When they get a chess board out, effectively ignoring him, Harry returns his attention the Quidditch magazine he’d found in the trunk down in the dorm.

Draco shakes his head and leans back, allowing them all to see the front page better.

”Yeah… But it keeps happening lately”, Pansy murmurs.
”Gentlemen”, Moody interrupts. ”I suggest we wrap this up, because I believe Potter wants a word with the Headmaster… he’s just outside the door…”
”No”, Draco chokes and runs up to him.
Draco snaps his mouth shut again with click. Harry snorts and chuckles.
”Up here, boy…”
all makes perfect sense —
”Truth, I guess”, the boy says warily. ”If I don’t want to answer I take a swig? Is that how it works?”
”Yes, Sir?” he says politely, turning back around.
A strangled grunt is all the warning Harry gets before he’s roughly pulled into a massive hug and lifted off his feet. He struggles against it half-heartedly for a couple of seconds, but quickly caves and buries his face in his dad’s neck.
”Whaaa…” Harry grumbles.
”What?” Harry frowns. ”What about it?”
He watches through his lashes as his daddy rises to his feet and walks out of the room. Sighing heavily, he leans the broom against the wall next to the open window and follows him out into the kitchen. Sinking into his seat at the table, Harry watches nervously as Remus moves around with familiar movements, making coffee and toast as a tense silence spreads out between them.
Filch’s sobbing increases and he clutches his face in despair.
”Draco? Are you okay with this?”
”What, then?” the blonde mutters, squeezing into one of his impossibly tight pyjama tops and peering over at Harry with a wary frown.
”No, no”, Sirius hurries to reassure him. ”No, we’re fine.”
As the door to the dorm shuts behind Remus, a nervous silence grows between the boys. Harry watches Draco’s face, trying to read his feelings but other than the blush in the boy’s cheeks, his face is completely unreadable and he’s definitely avoiding eye contact now.
”No…”
He gives Harry a sheepish look, but Harry simply smiles.
”Where on earth did you get that absurd idea?”
He hugs both his dads again and then waves good bye to them as Snape escorts him back to the tent, where the other three champions are waiting. After a while, Bagman comes bouncing into the tent, looking as excited as he’d done the first time Harry met him at the Quidditch World Cup, if not more so.
The sobbing witch sitting next to Crouch begins to rock back and forth, her sobs growing in volume as she presses the handkerchief to her face.
”Miss Granger, a word with you!” the stern voice of Professor McGonagall can be heard over the ruckus.
”Trying to”, Draco mutters pointedly.
”And is that what you want to do when you grow up? Play Quidditch professionally?”
” Seamus insists almost aggressively and thrusts the glass of firewhiskey into his hand, before slinging his arm around his neck and letting out a victorious crow.
Of course, he remembers his daddy mentioning the prophecy, the reason Voldemort set out to find and kill him as a baby, but as always when talking about the past, Remus had been very vague…
Harry grudgingly agrees to, but thinks to himself that there’s no way he’s going to start a secret DADA group with a bunch of Gryffindors right under Umbridge’s nose and risk the wrath of both his dads and Professor Snape. Not to mention Draco, he thinks as the blonde leans in to hiss in his ear about Granger already losing her mind over the OWLs already.
”You coming?”
Draco continues to write.
”You… Know about your father’s condition… Harry?”

”Harry?” the man says uncertainly, returning the embrace briefly.
Something collides with him suddenly and knocks him off his broom. He falls and lands in a graceless heap on the frosty grass. The fall isn’t high enough to seriously hurt him, only knock the wind out of him. If anything, his Nimbus hurts him more when it clatters on top of him.
”I assume that’s why you lied to get out of it?” Pansy asks.
from the lounge alerts them to the floo activating and Harry looks up at Remus in alarm. The man just smiles at him and gestures for him to go in there.
One more visit to the Hospital Wing, one more floo call from Snape, or if you get so much as a
”We’re not
” Harry snaps impatiently.
He’s immediately aware of stepping inside the Time Room, recognising the sound of whirring and clicking from all the clocks. This time, when he’s directed to stop, the blindfold disappears from his face again and he blinks in the sudden brightness.
”That is because it is a monstrous crime to slay a unicorn. Only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit it. You see the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch away from death, but at a terrible price… You have slain something so pure and innocent to save yourself that you will from then on have a half life, a cursed life…”
Ducking into the nearest doorway, Harry marches inside what looks like a replica of his dorm in Gryffindor Tower, except with a different —
is replaced by something that sounds muggle, possibly that muggle grunge band Seamus likes — although Harry can’t think how the Slytherins would have come across them in this world, where Seamus is Sorted into Gryffindor.
”Fine, don’t get your wand in a knot…” Harry mutters, still chuckling quietly.
”Because your dad asked for it”, Remus says. ”I just sent Hedwig to get him, he’ll only be a minute… Why don’t you have another cup of coffee while you wait for him?”
”What?” Harry says, feeling perplexed. ”It’s just the mail?”
”Dad…”
The lead guitarist, Kirely Duke, grabs one of the guitars and slings the strap over his shoulder and the rest of the band quickly follows suit, grabbing their instruments while Myron Wagtail, the singer, performs a Sonorous Charm on himself.
”Well, if the
… is a big deal.
Remus turns to Sirius with a sharp look.
”Sure”, Harry mutters wryly.
, Harry thinks anxiously.
”Yeah, hang on, I’m doing it…”
”Just —” Remus starts.
Professor Snape’s narrowed glare flickers over to Diggory and he gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement.
on the reaction to hellebore—”
Closing his eyes and breathing in deeply and slowly, Harry counts backwards from five until the impulse to throttle Malfoy subsides. Then, opening his eyes again, Harry slowly straightens back up.
Hi everyone! I just wanted to say that I do like Dumbledore and I do not intend to "bash" him or make him OOC in this fic. However, in the scene when Harry wakes up in the Hospital Wing, since he's got Remus and Sirius there in this Universe, and Remus is quite angry with Dumbledore for putting Harry at risk by keeping the Philosopher's Stone in the school in the first place, Dumbledore doesn't get a change to speak with Harry about everything that's happened. (Also, the first time Harry and Dumbledore speak privately in the canon Universe is when Harry keeps going back to visit the Mirror of Erised, but my Harry doesn't do that because he has no need for it. Make sense?)
”No”, Sirius agrees quietly. ”I’d like to think we matured a bit towards the end of school… and after. I’d like to think I’m not a bully now, although Snape does bring out that side in me, but that’s because — well, that’s complicated —”
”You told her the Dark Lord has returned?”
Draco frowns in confusion, ”What?”
” Draco hollers in a sudden burst of panic. ”
Harry hauls his cauldron to the empty table in front of Professor Snape’s desk and heaves it onto the table top before lifting the ingredients out of it again and lining them up on the table in the order he’ll need them.
”Well the alcohol is easy”, Pansy shrugs. ”Nice bottle of wine, or something stronger… Wrapped in a bow… Left on his desk with a note from a grateful student,
”Such a brute”, Draco mutters and finally lets go of his hand as they descend the stairs to get to the dining room.
The Slytherin boys’s bathroom is empty when Harry gets there and he allows himself to get lost in thought while he brushes his teeth carefully and thoroughly, and for a much longer time than he normally does, his heart thudding hard in his chest as he tries not to let his mind flash to the illustrations of his Sexual Handbook (and failing remarkably, as usual…)
Diggory’s eyes have widened steadily during Harry’s short speech and when he trails off, the older boy just blinks at him, clearly at a loss for words.
”It touched me! It touched me! Oh, it’s disgusting!” She screams, scrambling off the bench. ”
Professor McGongall quickly sweaps past Harry’s bed and disappears out of sight, only to return moments later with an anxious-looking Madam Pomfrey close on her heels. They join Dumbledore at the other bed and Harry can hear a sharp intake of breath as Madam Pomfrey reaches it.
Harry tells himself — and now he just has to deploy a diversionary tactics, like Flint taught him in Second Year…
not”, Draco adds with a meaningful look.
Harry rolls his eyes, but refrains from retorting, knowing there’s no point.
”Not sure”, Seamus says. ”I thought he’d set his hair on fire, but so far he’s only been staring at them…”
”Gilderoy Lockhart”, Harry murmurs. ”Where have I heard that name before…”
”—and I wasn’t even scared of you then!” Harry finishes stubbornly.
He finally stops writing and snaps his head up to fix Harry with a threatening look and Harry sighs, nodding his understanding. Professor Snape tosses the quill aside and thrusts the piece of parchment into Harry’s hand.
”First of all, Professor Slughorn”, Dumbledore says, pointing with his whole hand towards the big-bellied, balding old wizard squeezed into the seat on Professor Snape’s other side and he immediately stands up to give the students a small bow in greeting. ”… is a former colleague of mine, who has agreed to resume his old post as Potions master—”
Giving the clock another glance, Harry grits his teeth…
”Thanks” Harry murmurs thickly. ”You don’t have to, this one works just fine…”
”Why did you come get me?” Harry mumbles under his breath, leaning his head just a little closer to the other boy.
Riddle lets out a high, cold laugh that sends a shiver down Harry’s spine.
Granger frowns in question.
”Harry?”
smear campaign against him immediately kicks in and knots Harry’s stomach.
But he takes the carafe and pours himself a cup anyway, thinking it can’t really hurt to try. He takes a cautious sip and nearly gags. Draco, Seamus and Blaise laugh at him.
”Well, she’ll learn the truth soon enough… they all will…” Harry says grimly.
Harry huffs.
Professor Snape seems even stonier now than he’d been during their Potions lesson before lunch. His impossibly white face looks drawn and he keeps pressing his lips together grimly.
”I can’t believe it”, Sirius mutters. ”You’re in the lead Harry!”
Draco lets out a wordless, but definitely contented
”What, in Gryffindor Tower? You just invited me to the Gryffindor end of year party? In the Gryffindor Common?” he sits up and leans into the table, his wide eyes pinned to Harry’s face. ”Me, Draco Malfoy?”
Harry rocks forward on his feet indecisively, debating with himself whether he should just dive in and pry the boys apart…
”That was quick”, Seamus comments and Harry suspects he just wanted to break some of the sudden tension around the table, as everyone else has stopped whatever they were doing and gone silent, all watching Draco’s face nervously to gauge his reaction.
”Well, hold it out. That’s it.”
”Thank you, Aurora.”
He and Seamus jump to their feet and saunter out of the Great Hall, Seamus ’accidentally’ knocking his shoulder against Ron’s as they walk past him and Granger. Draco snatches the paper back from Harry and holds it up again, but this time he turns it around as intending for Ron to continue reading the article on his own.
Harry’s jaw is now clenched so tightly it’s begun to throb, but with a deep breath he manages to reel in his anger again.
”I want her fired too”, Harry says again. ”And I want to get back at her. I really do. But just in case Fudge or Dumbledore can’t get her to stop doing whatever she wants, we all need to be a lot more careful from now on… and yeah, I know, me especially… believe me, I don’t plan to get any more detentions with her. Even if I have to granger the fuck out of her, I will stay in her good books from now on!”
Be nice”, Harry says.
And he clings to that to keep himself grounded. No matter how good as he feels right now, no matter how much he wants to get swept away…
A tense moment of silence passes.
”What look?” Draco asks in surprise.
The Hogwarts Express finally emerges through the darkness and pulls into the platform. Remus gives Harry a final kiss on the forehead, then unwraps him from his robes. Harry shivers as the evening wind whips him once more, but steps away from his daddy and grabs his trunk.
Draco glances at him and Harry finds himself holding his breath, waiting for his reply.
”S-s-sorry”, Harry mumbles, blushing furiously.
Draco snaps his wand up in front of him, the almost black wood cutting his pale face into two scowling halves. Harry quickly mirrors him, his stomach churning with unease.
get Sorted into in the end, won’t you?”
”Okay”, he sighs. ”I’m ready. Let’s go…”
Harry nods his thanks. He wonders if he should ask about the curtained bed, so as not to make the matron suspiscious that he eavesdropped earlier in the morning. But before he’s made his mind up, the woman has bustled back into her office again.
Harry stares. His wand clatters to the floor, the only sign Riddle was ever there at all. Looking around in wonder, Harry sees Draco hunched over something on the floor… The blonde is gripping something in his hand and his chest is heaving… It’s not until he lets go and sits back on the floor that Harry sees what it is — it’s the basilisk fang that Draco pulled out of his arm, now embedded in Riddle’s diary… Riddle’s
Draco snorts and shakes his head, then leans down and captures Harry’s lips in a gentle kiss. Harry eagerly deepens it and as the kiss gets heated, they both begin to unfasten each other’s arm guards and the clasps of the other’s robes, before pulling off their own leather gloves and leg guards, then finally toeing off their boots.
it was full of Dark Magic! Why didn’t you show it to me or your mother, or Percy?”
If Harry had had any intention of broaching the subject of so-called blowjobs tonight, it quickly goes out the window as his and Draco’s kiss turns heated and desperate and the blonde’s hands suddenly seem to be everywhere at once, because there’s no way he is going to last long enough for Draco to so much as ghost his breath over his crotch, let alone engulp him…
”What—!”
”, Sirius interrupts. ”I’ll Side-Along you — Merlin, you really
”My dad’s an arsehole anyway…” the other boy mumbles. ”My mum and I barely see him and when we do he’s… Well… Nevermind…”
”Ah yes”, Dumbledore says and shakes her hand. ”It was enchantingly nasty. I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat…”
the two empty halves fall apart. The hair-raising wail immediately rings out in the silence of the dorm and Harry’s very skull seems to vibrate from the onslaught. Gritting his teeth, he stares in determination at the hollow centre of the egg and tries to think…
”Champions and their partners, over here, please!” Professor McGonagall’s stern voice calls from the closed doors to the Great Hall.
”Very well…” Dumbledore smiles. ”She said,
to sleep in order to try and reach out to the other Harry.
Draco’s cheeks flush a dark pink and he glares at his feet, but stands perfectly still as the medi-witch casts another spell on him.
”See you soon”, Harry says and pulls back again. ”Very soon.”
”I love you…” he murmurs. ”Be good.”
”Let’s have a look, then”, Umbridge says softly and Harry jerks his head up, startled to see her standing over him suddenly, one of her flabby hands held out towards him expectantly. ”Ah yes… much better… I think we’re done for tonight, Mister Potter.”
the deal…”
he thinks,
”I can only drink Dreamless Sleep every third night, the other two I have to… you know…”
”Sir…” Harry mumbles uncertainly as they ride the moving staircase down. ”There
Harry thinks for the second time and still he struggles to really comprehend what that means.
”What”, Draco murmurs, the tip of his nose nudging Harry’s jaw. ”You’ll make him hand over the real one under the threat of violence?”
”Oh…” Harry blinks in surprise. ”No. No, I definitely don’t hate you.”
like something—”
… I meant
”They’re not”, Remus mutters.
”Excellent idea!” Lockhart says and gestures for the rest of the crowd to clear a good space in the middle of the Hall to give them room.
Harry huffs and rubs his forehead tiredly, ”Well,
He grabs Draco’s book from him and tears the rope off. The book immediately tries to clamp down its jaws on his hand, but Hagrid smoothly moves it away and drags the forefinger down the book’s spine. It shivers and then falls open.
”Oh, she was remarkable…” Slughorn mumbles, slumping sideways again the armrest of his chair. ”One of the most talented witches I’ve ever taught… Truly amazing…”
Draco shrugs tensely.
”You know what she’s like”, Draco mumbles, deflating even more and looking like a lost glumbumle. ”I hope she’ll forgive me…”
”Aha! So there’s someone called Nicholas Flamel involved?” Harry exclaims triumphantly.
”What the hell was that all about?” Harry says.
Ginny Weasley’s face goes beet red and Harry groans, sure he can guess who the author of the song is.
Even Remus when he taught them Defence in Third Year. Although he would have had every excuse to treat Harry in a more informal manner, whilst in the classroom, he never did.
Pansy simply frowns, her mouth set in a hard line.
”But we’re still on for the — ehm —
”Yes, that
”Drink up, won’t you…”
”Well then it’s
A pale young man wearing a weird, purple turban suddenly moves out into the dim candle-light from a shadowed corner, wringing his hands nervously, one of his eyes twitching.
Harry is barely out of the side car before Remus comes running out of the house and envelops him in a massive bear hug. Harry hugs him back eagerly, burrowing into his warm chest greedily and nuzzling his soft christmas jumper.
”Let’s just dance…” he mutters.
”Ollivander”, Harry says. ”The wandmaker?”
”Hagrid has never sent humans into our hollow before”, Aragog says slowly, all eight eyes fixed on Harry and flashing darkly.
And he had to go through it all alone, because Sirius had to stay with Harry, and for some reason neither if them wanted him to know the truth…
” Madam Hooch hollers as she comes striding up to them and Harry and Seamus immediately move back.
”What”, Pansy says, blinking. ”You’re joking?”
”What… Will you be teaching me Occlumency, Sir? My scar hasn’t really been hurting at all lately, and I haven’t had a vision since—”
”Never thought I’d see the Great Hall from this angle”, he comments lightly and reaches for the coffee.
” an unfamiliar voice exclaims suddenly over the excited murmur of the crowd and a hush immediately breaks out in the small bookshop.
”M-My broom…” he mumbles uncertainly.
”Lighter”, Seamus supplies mildly. ”And a matchbox.”
The unwanted memory of when he was transfigured into a ferret jumps to the forefront of Harry’s mind, just before Moody begun to bounce him up and down, when he’d sort of twitched on the floor and then tried to make a run for it…
”They’re Gryffindors, though—”
”Well… See you, then”, Ginny says and returns to her own friends.
explained it to him (something about
Harry suddenly becomes aware that he’s being watched and looks up. A very small, mousy-haired boy is standing at his elbow staring as though transfixed and clutching a camera. As soon as Harry locks eyes with him, the boy goes bright red and he starts to stammer.
Draco frowns, but doesn’t say anything. After a moment’s awkward silence, he climbs into his own bed and burrows down. Peering through the gloom, Harry thinks he can see the boy pouting and suppresses a smile.
”Your dad was Padfoot”, Remus says with a small smile. ”James was Prongs…”
… Harry has no idea where he’d go now.
”What?” Draco and Harry say in unison.
”What are you playing at?” he demands then. ”Get out of here!”
”There’s a note, Harry”, Remus says quietly and points to a piece of parchment on the floor.
The first thing he notices is the absence of mountains on the horizon, telling him he and Krum must have travelled quite far from Hogwarts.
”All right then…” the man mutters. ”I’ll keep this… you get your wand back…”
” Dean Thomas cries suddenly and everyone jumps. ”It got me! Its end exploded!”
Harry swivels his glower around to him, but it immediately melts and he leans in for a brief but heartfelt kiss.
”I’m afraid not”, Grubbly-Plank says breezily. ”Just got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a few weeks’ teaching work. I accepted, and here I am.”
He feels like someone is watching him, and looks over his shoulder nervously as he staggers forward. But he can’t see anything in the darkness behind him.
”What’s that?” Sirius says, looking curiously from Harry to Remus.
Draco is already pulling his books and notes out to start revising for tomorrow’s Care of Magical Creatures exam, but Harry can’t muster the energy to care about that.
”Good night”, the blonde replies in a small voice.
Quirrell curses under his breath, ”I don’t understand this… is the Stone
Harry debates with himself for a second, but finally decides to drop it and instead goes back to staring the professor down.
”She’s always glaring daggers at something”, Pansy sniffs. ”Even when we used to talk to her, she always had a face like a cat’s—”
any women…”
”I can’t, my parents don’t like me spending my pocket money on things I don’t need… Unless it’s ridiculously expensive and flashy, so that I can broadcast to the world how well off we are”, he adds drily and rolls his eyes.
, he tells himself firmly and focuses again on the dragon’s gleaming yellow eyes, as he zooms round its back.
looking!” Remus snaps back. ”And I’m telling you, it’s just a common garden rat!”
Harry shakes himself out of his shock and immediately starts tearing the wrapping paper off, gasping as the brand new broom is revealed to be the new Nimbus 2000 and lets out a delighted squeal, before launching himself at Sirius who laughs as he hugs him back, ”I think he likes it!”
Remus tightens his arms around him once more, but murmurs ”Let’s just go inside, cub…”
”You said it, Harry”, Seamus says drily. ”Out of her mind.”
”Oh, no, you didn’t do anything”, Draco says sarcastically. ”Apart from landing yourself in detention
to see Granger on Valentine’s Day?”
”Hey Granger”, Draco smiles.
”Sometimes”, Sirius says. ”Most of the time I take the bike and park up the road, though…”
”You’re joking!” Draco splutters. ”What,
Harry shakes his head numbly.
”Yeah, positive”, Sirius says. ”They have a bad rep and you don’t want to get too close to a wild one, but these are domesticated, so you’re fine…”
” Voldemort repeats coldly.
”And you
The truth is that out of all the pamphlets he’s glanced at during the weekend, none of the professions seem all that exciting to him. When he tries to picture the future life he’d like to have, he can picture the house he’d like to live in perfectly, and he can picture Draco by his side, maybe even a kid or two… And his dads of course, visiting them on the weekends and celebrating all the major holidays with them like one big family… But no job really comes to mind.
”Right”, Harry says. ”Well, consider it an open offer, in case anything happens to change your mind.”
Harry nods, ”Yeah, you’re probably right. Well, I guess I’ll… See you around then.”
Harry swallows thickly, frowning in concentration.
”It just… caught fire…” he finishes lamely.
The circular room is bathing in the warm glow of a hundred floating candles, each of them reflected in the many glass phials and metallic instruments strewn across the office. Harry steps inside the room, the many portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses are snuffling and snoring softly all around him.
”The b-beginning?” Harry repeats. ”You mean … wh-what … what
”You stand, Harry Potter, on the remains of my father”, he says softly after a moment, the scarlet eyes twinkling with something that might be amusement. ”A muggle and a fool, much like your mother… but they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child and… I killed my father, and now look… in death he has proved himself useful at last…”
”Well… I think I need some more hot chocolate”, Remus says breezily and pushes to his feet. ”Harry, do you want another cup?”
”What’s what?” Harry says.
Then before Harry knows how it’s happened or had time to emotionally prepare himself for it at all, Krum’s dark eyes have flitted over to his and his hand is looming in front of his face.
”No”, Draco says immediately. ”Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t exactly a good sign…”
Sirius leads Harry back down to the first floor and a high-ceilinged drawing room with olive green walls peaking out between immense tapestries and large windows covered with heavy velvet curtains in a reather depressing moss green colour. As they step over the threshold, the grimy carpet lets out tiny clouds of dust around their feet.
”What?” Harry says icily. ”What kind of a question is
”—Yeah!”
Harry blinks the memories away and turns his head to see Dudley Dursley and a handful of muggle boys all wearing the same sort of clothes as him, all shiny fabric and words and none of it seems to be the right size for any of them either.
