"They're not really." Harry says and Draco is quite surprised when the kid just shrugs and goes back to his book. Draco turns to Harry who just smiles slightly and sits on the sofa. When Draco sits next to him Harry turns to him.
"No." Draco denies, but the bright red flush spreading across his face tells Harry he's right. Harry just grins knowingly and Draco sighs. "Okay yes. Shut up about it." He mutters, turning his face away, and Harry smiles brightly, pulling Draco closer to him with a tug at his hand. He reaches up, dropping his broom on the floor to free his hand, and brushes Draco's cheek.
"We became friends a few months ago." He says because she's going to make him say it but he's going to make her wait as long as possible.
It's 6:30pm. Harry doesn't know how he managed to waste an entire day doing nothing but playing guitar and having nightmare filled naps, but he sighs as he stands up. He knows he needs to go back to the castle, and he knows McGonagall is going to be mad at him for missing all of the meals today so he should at least try and make it to dinner which he could, but he just really doesn't want to. He does want to go back to the castle and have a long hot shower though so he puts his jacket back on and grabs his guitar before making his way back through the passageway. He manages to avoid anyone important as he drops his guitar off in the dorm room and makes his way to the sixth floor bathroom.
"It's a shame it's Tuesday and we have classes. I kinda wanna stay here all day." Harry whispers and Draco hums in agreement.
Draco watches as Harry comes and wow Harry looks like a fucking god. His muscles are so visible and he's panting and his eyes are only half open and his hair is a mess and he's staring right at Draco and Draco needs to remind himself to breath. Harry pulls out of Draco and lies next to him, gathering the blond in his arms and pulling him onto his chest.
"Maybe Wednesday. I know sixth years have astronomy tonight, which means all of their classes tomorrow will be in the afternoon. I think fourth years have defence Thursday night. I don't want to wait until Friday or the weekend." Harry says and she nods.
"Of what?" The sun is shining through the window and when it hits Harry's eyes they sparkle and Draco's heart flutters.
"I can't believe you intentionally fell off your broom from like 10 foot up." Dean says and Harry rolls his eyes.
"I just don't want anyone seeing me this messed up." He says quietly and Blaise smiles slightly. He know's Harry doesn't mean 'anyone'; He doesn't want Draco to see him like this.
"This is my boyfriend, Draco." He says, and the woman smiles at Draco. Draco doesn't think he'll ever get over the fact that Harry is his boyfriend, or that he says it so casually, like he's been saying it all his life.
"I don't have a hero complex you prat. And if you believe what Hermione told you you would know I fucking hate it when people call me the chosen one so unless you're purposely trying to piss me off then shut the fuck up about it. Why do you care so much anyway?" Harry spits out angrily. He's standing so close to Draco that their chests are almost touching and he can see the almost silver flecks in Dracos gray eyes.
"Ron what the fuck?" Harry asks and Ron stops walking and turns to him once they're halfway across the bridge, no other students near by.
"Dunno." He says, not tired at all and only slightly sweating. Rhys reaches out and grabs Harry's arm to stop him.
"Mister Malfoy and Mister Zabini are not causing Mister Potter any harm." McGonagall snaps, closing the door behind her so Ron can no longer see into the wing. Madam Pomfrey appears in front of Harry with a light blue potion, and Harry drinks it in one go, praying it takes affect fast. Blaise still has a hand on Harry's right shoulder and Harry is still gripping his upper arm, and when the dizziness starts to go down he loosens his grip and takes a deep breath.
"It's like, everyone expects me to be an auror because of the whole Voldemort thing but I don't wanna deal with that anymore. I'd get to do what I love for a living. You know, you should become the potions teacher then we could be like that teacher couple that all the students ship." Harry smirks and Draco frowns.
"Yeah babe?" Harry asks. Draco wraps his arms around Harry's neck and buries his head in his neck, just below Harry's ear so he can still ask him but so he doesn't have to look him in the eye.
"During the war when I went to the forest to see Voldemort, he killed me. I died, and no one knew until today." Harry says and Blaise's eyes widen.
”Sit in front of me?” She asks and Harry raises an eyebrow but shifts to the side so he’s right in front of her. Pansy runs her hands through his hair, splitting it into a middle parting, before starting to french braid each half. She does half of a french plait before tapping Harry’s arm, who gets the hint and hands her the band on his wrist, and she ties off the plait so it ends in a short pigtail before moving onto the other side. Harry likes having his hair played with, so he just stares ahead as Pansy plaits his hair, and he notices Blaise and Draco, even though they’re still talking, are now watching Pansy. Pansy has noticed them watching too, and she smiles slightly because now Draco is the one who looks entranced. Pansy finishes Harry’s hair and sits back with a satisfied grin.
"You better." He says before squeezing Harry's hand again. "Try and get some sleep." He says, voice soft, and Harry nods despite knowing he wont.
Harry knows Draco was forced into what he did but he doesn't believe that he's glad he survived the war. He doesn't have it in him to argue so he just stays quiet, glad that the tears have finally stopped falling. He doesn't want to confirm what Hermione said, because he doesn't want Draco to know it's true. After a few minutes of silence it becomes apparent to Draco that Harry isn't going to say anything about it so he decides to change the subject for now.
"Well no, but then you gave Blaise your essay for us to use." Draco finally meets Harry's gaze, biting his lip.
"So are you ever gonna tell everyone who it is you're dating?" Hermione asks as they sit down at the back of the stands.
TLDR I'm so sorry I'm a literal disaster but I'm going to try and write as much as I can and hopefully I'll update again soon. I hope you like the chapter and than you so much for your patience <3
Hermione leans close to Harry and whispers "look at that. Your best friend and boyfriend are bonding." She smirks when Harry blushes, imagining what it would be like to be Draco's boyfriend.
He manages to avoid anyone until he walks into the hall for dinner. Rhys Davies, a 7th year Gryffindor, approaches Harry before he's even reached the table.
"Okay, you fly to the goalposts over there," Harry points to the closest ones, "And the rest of you are gonna try and score." Harry says, mounting his broom and flying over.
"Then leave me alone." He whimpers and Hermione looks shocked and hurt and Harry feels bad, he does, but the longer he looks at her the guiltier he feels.
"Alright, leave him alone now. We need to go to potions." Harry says and everyone agrees so Harry lets his hand fall from Draco's back to by his side and the four of them walk to potions.
"People already think this place is haunted. You can be as loud as you want." He whispers in Draco's ear and he shivers.
"Hey Minerva." He says with a cheeky smile. He's always been close with McGonagall, so him talking casually to her is nothing new.
"I'll see you later, mate." Ron says with a grin and Harry finally sees him as Ron and not Fred's younger brother for the first time in months.
"I could use the distraction." He mutters as he stands up straight and pulls on some ripped skinny jeans and a tight white t-shirt.
"Of course, Mister Potter. Mr Potter helped Winky and now Winky helps Mister Potter." She says and Harry smiles at her before heading back out of the kitchen and towards the stairs.
"George? As in Weasley? As in there's no need to be jealous?" Draco asks, actually hurt that Harry could say it so casually.
"But seriously, Draco. If you're worried about him, he should come here, or you should go there." Draco nods.
For the next few days the two find themselves sitting next to each other in the back of the library, always in silence and never actually asking the other for help but if they notice the other has stopped writing they look over and help. Harry is walking to breakfast with Hermione on Thursday morning when she finally mentions it.
"Mate you could have told me you were gonna be captain." Ron says and Harry looks up from his essay to see Ron looking both hurt and annoyed. Harry bites his lip and looks down at his essay to avoid Rons eyes.
"Er, I'm not sure. It was left with my stuff in the library." Harry says and McGonagall raises an eyebrow. It looks familiar, she just doesn't know where from. She glances round the hall before she notices Draco looking at Harry and she immediately remembers seeing Draco reading the book during a transfiguration class last year.
"By the entrance hall." Blaise stands up immediately and, after a look to Draco that he hoped told him everything would be fine, he leaves the common room.
"Talk to me, Draco." Her voice is soft, and Draco knows that she's going to have to find out eventually, so why not now? He takes a deep breath and tries to find the right words.
Okay so I literally have 1/4 of the next chapter written and I have major writers block and no motivation so I don't know when the next chapter will be posted but I'm hoping I get motivation soon, I'm sorry <3
"I know that blush. That's a Harry Potter blush. Either you gushing about how hot he is and Pansy's taking the piss or something happened." Blaise grins and Pansy nods, grinning. Blaise jumps over the table and, after a yell form McGonagall not to set a bad example, he wraps his arms around both of them.
Harry silently and wandlessly casts the colloportus charm to lock the door before his lips meet Dracos and his fingers thread into his hair. Dracos breath gets caught in his throat and he runs his hands over Harrys chest and Harry grins, deepening the kiss.
They make their way up to the dorm room and settle into bed, noses almost touching and legs tangled together.
"I did, I just- still don't know how I feel about Dean. Neville's harmless and Ron is okay and I guess Seamus is too but I still don't wanna be in a room with them. Not after-" Harry cuts himself off, putting his fork down.
Harry holds the stone in his fist and shuts his eyes. He doesn't know how it works, last time he used it was basically just luck, but he's hoping it somehow works again. He opens his eyes and sighs when he sees no one in front of him. He spins round and huffs again. Nothing. Harry frowns and puts the stone in his pocket, deciding to figure out how to use it properly. He continues running in the forest before deciding to get out of the trees. He runs along the edge of the lake and round the castle twice before checking his watch. 6:30pm. He's dripping sweat and out of breath and he can't feel his legs any longer, so he does one more lap of the school before heading into the castle. He walks past the hall without going in and walks towards the kitchen.
"I'd love it a lot more if you would stop fucking about and actually do something productive." Harry grins at how impatiently needy Draco is.
"Ca- Can you play one?" Harry presses his lips together to stop from smiling at how adorable Draco is being.
"Mister Potter sir. Winky thought you'd need breakfast." Winky says as Harry sits at his usual spot at the table. He looks at the food on the plate and grimaces. The thought of eating anything makes him feel sick, and he really doesn't want to eat.
"You can come with me and Hermione? Ron's staying here to practice quidditch." Harry says and Draco hesitates before nodding as the announcement tells 8 years to get to their common rooms.
"What I was trying to say-" Blaise continues, "is that Harry is a vast improvement. I'm just excited to see the look on Brandon's face when he sees you two together."
"Hey." He whispers back, his hand still on Harry's face, and Harry reaches up and pushes a few stands of hair out of Draco's face.
When he steps out of the shower 15 minutes later, skin still steaming from the heat, it is only because the temperature of the water was making him feel lightheaded. He staggers out of the shower and wraps a towel around his waist before turning round only to come face to face with Draco Malfoy, who had just walked into the bathroom. Harry is about to turn around when he feels lightheaded again, and Malfoy grips his arm to stop him falling over.
Little life update though: I’m still sick which sucks but I managed to get the Shane Dawson pallets and lipsticks and I am so excited about it
"If you need anything." Harry nods again before showing Kingsley out, thanking him because he's actually been so good to Harry since the war,
"I'll see you later." He says quietly to Blaise before walking up the stairs and heading to McGonagalls office.
"So what happened to you yesterday?" Blaise asks once everyone has started brewing and Harry pauses mid stir.
"'Arry! Come in!" Harry smiles when Hagrid pulls him into a bone-crushing hug before he sits at the table.
"What happy memory do you use?" He asks curiously, not wanting to ask any questions because there's a scared look on Harrys face and Draco can tell Harry is still pretty much traumatised by his childhood.
"Not really." He says and Blaise is shocked for a second, having been expecting a lie, before recovering.
"It- We're fine, Blaise. I'll see you in class." Harry says quietly and Seamus looks relieved and if it wasn't for the fact that Blaise knew Harry is incredible at legilimency he would think he was being mind controlled.
"Forget about it, Harry." Seamus whispers in Harrys ear, and Harry bites his lip and looks down at the table.
"Hi, er, thanks." Harry says, handing the book to Blaise who takes it and places it on the desk in front of Draco, who is watching Harry with a weird look that Harry has never seen on anyone before.
"Finally!" He smiles, pulling Harry into a hug before turning to Draco. "Guess you're one of us now." He says, offering him a hand. Draco looks at him in shock for a minute before smiling and shaking Rons hand.
"You're right. Draco is also a better person than you will ever be." Blaise uses his words against him, but Dracos hands are shaking. Harry immediately grabs his hand tight, tries to figure out how to calm him down in a room full of people.
"I love you too." Harry places his hands on Draco's waist and slowly pulls him closer, pressing his chapped and bitten lips against Draco's soft ones in a sweet kiss neither of them thought would ever happen.
"Just really don't want to fuck it up." Harry whispers before smiling slightly at Draco, lifting their hands and kissing Dracos before turning back to the door, trying to steady his racing heart as Draco opens the door and leads Harry into the room. Narcissa is sat in an armchair by the fire, reading a book that she seems completely focused on.
"So what you been thinking about that's got you so distracted? And don't say stuff cause I will hex your dick off." Harry jokes and Draco sighs.
"Beginning of second year?" He mumbles, sitting on the edge of the bed that Madam Pomfrey gestures to. She gives him a stern look and he shrinks under her gaze.
Harry sits on the sofa and holds the guitar, his hand pausing over the strings. He learnt quite a few songs during summer, ones he knows his dad and Sirius loved, as well as a few he knew his mum loved. Harry starts strumming a Beatles song, muttering the words quietly. He's not the best singer in the world but he can carry a tune, and he's no Jimi Hendrix but he learnt pretty quick and he's not awful, especially since Petunia signed him up for the free after school Piano and Guitar classes when he was in primary school to keep him out of the house for longer, so he already knew the chords and a few tunes.
"Maybe he's being tactical, I mean they have to play quidditch against each other, maybe he just did it so he could see their game plan." He says, trying to give their friend the benefit of the doubt, and Dean shakes his head.
"No." He whispers, but he lets Draco walk him into the hall and over to the Slytherin table. Harry can feel the eyes of nearly everyone in the hall on him as he sits next to Draco, opposite Blaise and Pansy.
"I, er- I see a therapist." Then after a second he adds "Apparently I'm more fucked up than everyone thought." He jokes slightly and Draco looks at him for a second, and if Harry had turned to meet his gaze he would have seen pain and sympathy in his eyes.
Harry wakes up the next day lying next to Draco, as usual, however before he even opens his eyes he can tell Draco is watching him.
"He promised he'd be at lunch, he just needed to not be in here." Blaise says, and Draco frowns but nods, turning back to pay attention again.
"Potter what are we going to do with you?" Madam Pomfrey asks as she walks over to a cupboard and a sink. "Mister Zabini, Mister Malfoy, could one of you please fetch Professor McGonagall?"
"I, er, saw you and your team practising again the other day..." Blaise says quietly whilst he stirs the potion and Harry pauses before continuing to measure out the syrup of hellebore. He stays quiet and lets Blaise continue.
"Can it wait until tomorrow? Please? I'm really tired." He says and she nods so Harry picks up Teddy and leaves the hall.
"Hey, Thanks Mione, I owe you one. Hey Teddy!" Harry says as he comes round the corner, obviously not noticing Malfoy sat opposite his bushy haired friend.
"I have transfiguration but it finishes at 4. I know fifth year has double herbology but I think it finishes at 3." Will says.
"You're the worst person alive." He growls and Harry chuckles before pecking Draco and unbuttoning his shirt slowly, kissing down his chest as he reveals it and lets the shirt drop to the floor. He smirks at Draco, which makes him bite his lip, before dropping to his knees and slowly rubbing Draco through his trousers.
"But it makes you blush and that's cute." Harry says, reaching down to his hips and grabbing Dracos hands.
An hour later, after Madam Pomfrey forced Harry to eat a bowl of porridge, he's sat up in bed sketching. Professor McGonagall brought his sketchbook down from his dorm room earlier for him and he's drawing Draco from when he was sat at his bedside last night. Just before first period starts Blaise comes to visit Harry.
”Trust me.” He whispers and he slowly pulls Harry off the desk and presses him against the closest wall. Harry turns them around so he’s pressing Seamus against the wall and moves so Seamus’ leg is in between his, Seamus' thigh pressed to Harrys crotch and their bodies pressed against each other. Seamus is gripping Harry's hips tight, and Harry grabs onto Seamus' arms. Harry gasps when Seamus starts moving his thigh against Harry, and his head lowers to Seamus' neck, where he starts sucking and kissing because he feels slightly bad that he's not giving Seamus anything in return. Seamus responds to the neck kisses by biting Harry's neck and moving his thigh harder and faster, and it's not long before Harry is gasping against his skin. Seamus can't help but pull Harry's head back and kiss him as he comes undone. He's never even considered doing anything like this with Harry, not since they fooled around in fifth and sixth year, and he figured Harry hadn't either, but he can't deny that Harry is attractive and, sure this is just a friend helping another friend out, but it doesn't mean he isn't enjoying it.
"Moron." Harry smiles slightly as Draco takes his hands, lifting them so they're in a prayer position and rubbing them with his own hands to warm them up.
"Erm, thanks." He mumbles, crossing out the word spoonful as Draco turns back to his own homework. Harry chances a look and swears he can see a small smile on Draco's face.
"I'm sorry I cursed your friends and caused you to use too much magic." Ron says seriously, and Harry nods.
When Draco hasn't answered in a few seconds Harry rolls over so Draco is on his back and Harry leans over him.
"Try not to be ignorant arseholes. It ain't right." Harry says before stepping away from the group and walking back over to Draco and Hermione.
Harry curls into a ball in an armchair in the back corner of the library and starts on his herbology essay, using his textbook as a table despite the fact that there's a table right in front of him. He hears Malfoy and Zabini talking quietly as they sit somewhere near him, and frowns slightly when he hears what Malfoy says. Harry loves playing quidditch with him too and he would love it if Malfoy became slytherins seeker; he's missed playing against Malfoy. He keeps quiet, but they don't say anything else on the subject and Harry goes back to writing his essay in peaceful silence. Until Ron finds him, that is.
On Thursday morning, when Harry and Draco are lying together in bed before classes start, they decide to 'enter phase 2' as Harry puts it.
"Good job buddy." He smiles at Teddy, high fiving him. Harry decides to actually get some work done and by lunch he's finished his DADA homework and sent the letter he wrote. He puts his stuff away and throws his bag over his shoulder, picking up Teddy but pausing before they leave and turning to Malfoy. Through the time they've been here Malfoy has been nice to Teddy, hugging and playing along and adding to Teddy's amazing imagination, and then threatening Harry with murder or pain if he told anyone after every cute thing he did.
"I don't know. Thank you so much for letting me stay here, Mrs Potter." Sirius says and the man puts his hand on Sirius' back.
"Potter, you are the strongest person I know. You have been dealt the worst possible hand, but you're still here, and I know it's scary, and it will probably hurt. But living hurts, Harry. Being alive hurts, but it's also amazing. You're still here, and you've put everyone else first for your whole life. Now it is your turn to be happy. It's your turn to live, Harry." Harry hugs her back tightly, because she's right, as usual, and she's like a mother to him.
"So you're definitely sick of me, then?" Harry jokes and Draco opens his eyes just so Harry can see him roll them.
"Harry, Draco doesn't sleep with you because he has to. He wants to help you. And he knows that you sleep when you're with him."
“I’m gonna be an uncle!” Sirius says before pulling Lily in to join their hug, the other two joining in too.
"It wont." Harry sounds like he genuinely doesn't think it will and Blaise wishes Harry could see how much Draco loves him.
"Of what?" Harry studies his eyes again, and Draco tries to show him that it's okay; he can tell him.
"Hi Diane, I'm good, how are you?" Harry exchanges pleasantries with his neighbour for a few minutes, and then she mentions Draco.
"Detention, Harry. 6pm." He says, sounding like he really doesn't want to give Harry the detention but knowing he has to. Harry just nods and goes back to staring out the window. He's done the homework, it's in his bag and, to be honest, he wrote a bloody good essay and he's proud of it, however the thought of having to move and get it out of his bag and actually interact with anyone or do anything other than stare out the window sounds unbearable right now.
Draco is already lying in his bed and whilst Harry changes into some tracksuit bottoms and takes off his shirt he's certain he can feel Draco's eyes on him. Harry looks at Draco, lying in his bed with no product in his hair so it looks fluffy and soft, his eyes staring directly at Harry's. Harry wants nothing more than to climb into Draco's bed with him, and figures you don't get unless you ask, but he's too nervous to ask, so he decides to be Gryffindor about it. He walks over to Draco's bed, Draco can tell he's nervous, and Harry climbs into the bed and lies with his back to Draco before biting his lip nervously whilst waiting for Draco's reaction. Draco can't help the small smile that appears on his face because Potter is so cute when he's nervous and he makes himself look so small even though he has great muscles and is 6 foot, so he just moves his right arm around Harry, wrapping the duvet around him as he does so, grabs his hand and pulls him into his chest, burying his face in his shoulder. Harry realises that Draco is the first person to comfort him like this, to just accept that he's not okay and hold him, to not try to fix him, but to just hold him so he doesn't break completely. It's such a weird realisation, and Harry has never felt so alone yet so connected with a person, and before he knows what's happening he's crying quietly.
"Harry, are you okay?" Seamus asks as he leads Harry through corridors. Harry sighs and shakes his head, wrapping his arm around Seamus' waist as they walk.
"Not the fifth one. Not sure I could deal with that." Harry says, sparing a glance at Draco who smells one of his potions and immediately looks at Harry. Harry looks back at the list and presses his lips together, wondering if everyone has the same 7 potions.
"I'm sure you will think of something, Harry." McGonagall smiles and Harry nods. He figures he might as well try.
"Er, Granger, I er, I want to apologise for the way I treated you." Malfoy stutters but the sincerity is clear in his voice and Hermione smiles, knowing he means it.
"Nothing much. Told me I'm meant to eat. Also told me I'm meant to stay with you or Malfoy. Nothing else really." He says and Blaise nods.
"It's honestly nothing Harry, forget I said anything." He says and Harry frowns before sitting up and looking him in the eyes.
"Like the fact that he is the best friend of Mr. Malfoy." She says with a smirk and Harry's eyes widen slightly before he quickly looks down, fiddling with the bottom of his shirt.
"Why didn't you like your aunt and uncle?" Draco asks, he assumed Harry would have been spoiled when he was a kid, considering he was the one that defeated Voldemort.
"Thank you." He whispers, and Harry stands up just in time for Ron to pull him into a bone crushing hug.
"I'm imagining you and Draco fucking. It's hot. That's a good mental image." Seamus says and Harry punches his arm.
"Call me Narcissa." She replies before they pull out of the hug. "Who's for tea?" She asks and Draco and Harry glance at each other before nodding. "Brilliant. Draco, dear, why don't you show Harry around and I'll meet you in the kitchen in half an hour?"
"Okay team, lets go." Harry says, slightly dreading it but he knows it will build his teams spirit and it's a good bonding experience and all that. The team walk to Hogsmeade together, chatting about whatever, and when they get to the the ice cream parlour they grab a table in the corner. Harry sits in the very corner, next to Will and opposite Rhys. He joins in the conversation as much as he can, so not much, and he eats ice cream and avoids Ginny's gaze as he listens to his team. They're bonding and getting along well and Harry is glad he has such a good team and his chest fills with pride. They talk about strategy for their first game in a few weeks and they make jokes and at 2 Harry realises he needs to start making his way back to Hogwarts. Most of the team want to stay in Hogsmeade, but Rhys says he'll walk Harry back because 'we can't leave the captain alone and vulnerable, one of the other teams might kidnap and torture him to get our game plan!'
"Harry that's a mental image I did not need." He says, and Harry doesn't know if that's good or not. He didn't say he doesn't think Harry and Draco dating is bad, he just said he doesn't want to think about them snogging. Which is good, right?
"Or you'll be in love for the rest of your lives, or even just a while, and when, if, it ends, you'll realise you spent that time together happier than you've ever been and it was worth it." McGonagall says and Harry looks down again.
"Shit I have practice in like 5 minutes!" He gasps and he almost falls over as he jumps out of his bed, realising he's still holding Draco's hand. Draco chuckles and lets go so Harry can get up properly.
"I'll get the ingredients?" He offers and Harry nods. Blaise goes over to the store cupboard with half the class, Harry notices he says something to Draco, whilst Harry sets up the cauldron and other equipment. They start working in near silence, only talking about the work they're doing, whilst most other pairs are talking casually.
“I get that a lot.” He jokes, wiping his eye. Something about seeing his parents so happy to be having him makes him emotional.
"Good luck with your essay, Draco. I need to get going but if you need help with anything or to talk and stuff, just let me know." She smiles before walking off and Draco smiles slightly. When did Granger get so nice. Has she always been like that?
Draco easily gives in and allows Harry to control the kiss and when Harry moves his tongue against Dracos he can't help but let out a quiet moan that makes Harry grin into the kiss. After a few more minutes Harry pulls back slightly, just enough to look at Draco properly, and tries to catch his breath.
"I asked Professor McGonagall about her." Harry explains, shifting so he's lying on his back with his head in Draco's lap.
"He's welcome here, Draco. Any time, for however long." Narcissa says softly, and Draco smiles at her.
"Harry why won't you talk to us?" She asks and Harry sighs, moving so he's looking straight up at the ceiling because he can't bare to look at her anymore. Her screams haunt him.
“Harry, I- I’m- I don’t know what to say.” Draco mutters, pulling Harry into a hug and Harry let’s the tears fall. Just then the door opens.
"Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy." Professor McGonagall calls as they both reach the top of the staircase by the entrance hall and they both freeze. Harry bites his lip as he turns to his left to face McGonagall rather than turning right to go to the common room.
"I'm sure he'll get over it eventually." He says and Harry nods, grabbing Dracos hand and pulling him closer to him, wrapping his arms around the blondes waist.
"He came to find me a few hours ago. He said he had a fight with Weasley and that he looked into his mind and saw what they thought and they had a fight about it. I took him to the Slytherin common room but he was sad so I wanted to cheer him up, and suggested a little 1v1 game. Well, it was the three of us so I guess 1v1v1." Blaise pauses to make sure McGonagall is okay with what he's saying, and when she nods he continues.
"Nothing really, just, when are you finally going to get together? How will it happen?" Harry's silent for a second, and Blaise thinks maybe he's finally got through to him, but then Harry looks at him and his eyes are full of sadness.
"Sorry." He mutters before rushing away, and Harry flexes his hand a few times, taking a breath to calm down before turning to Blaise.
"Yeah, she's great, she's going home tomorrow." Harry says and Draco frowns, confused for a second, before realisation crosses his annoyingly perfect features.
”Believe me Harry, I know.” Draco says with a small smile, “But I still love you.” Harry finally lets himself believe it.
"Thank you." Madam Pomfrey walks over to her office and Harry sighs back against the pillow before sending Blaise a message that he can come back in.
”Beautiful.” Harry says, and Blaise laughs and Draco chuckles and Pansy smiles fondly and none of them mention the fact that Harry is running his hands through the sides and back of Dracos hair, careful not to disturb the style but threading his fingers through as if unconsciously. And when Blaise joins Pansy on the sofa and Draco stays on the floor in between Harry’s legs no one questions it.
"Sirius, how are you, sweetheart?" The woman says, wrapping a towel around his shoulders before pulling him into a hug.
"I know. I never asked-" McGonagall lowers her voice as students start arriving "How did it go with Mr. Burns? You think it'll help?"
"People can look, but they ain't allowed to touch." Harry murmurs, kissing Dracos cheek. "Mine." He mutters, kissing his way to Draco's ear. "Mine." He whispers in his ear and Draco shivers as Harry starts kissing and sucking on his neck.
"How about we get our teams together on Wednesday and have a friendly game of quidditch? Like joint practice." Blaise suggests and Harry thinks for a second. It would be good to see how his team play against other people before an official match. Besides, Blaise is a nice guy and Harry wouldn't mind hanging out with him more.
Narcissa was planning on checking on the boys, seeing if they were okay, but stops when she hears soft voices coming from Draco's room. She knows snooping is bad, and is about to turn around and leave them alone when she hears Draco's question about Harry's parents liking him. She hears the doubt in her sons voice, and listens carefully to Harry's response. She smiles to herself, eyes watering, because Harry sounds so in love with him, so determined for Draco to understand him and believe what he's saying, and she wipes her eye as she walks away, her heart full, and she figures she can just ask how they're doing at dinner.
"Not really. I told him I don't hate him. He said he didn't hate me." Draco mumbles before sighing. "I just don't know what I'm going to do, Blaise. He's so damn cute it makes me want to kill him."
”Okay.” She says, reaching down, Harry holding her waist so she doesn’t fall, as she grabs the black nail varnish out of the bag Draco has now opened. Harry holds out his left hand when she sits back up, his right hand still on Pansy's back, and she starts painting his nails. Harry doesn't mind having his nails painted, and it seems Pansy is just thrilled that someone is letting her paint their nails.
"Yeah I know, still nervous though mate. I'm always nervous before quidditch." Harry says and it's true, he's had a lot of near death experiences when playing quidditch and although he is amazing at it and wins every game and loves flying, he still gets nervous.
"Harry, for one, you both look like you just spent a few hours making out. And secondly, the way he was looking at you kinda proves it. Besides, it's Malfoy. He manages to keep his hair perfect even after playing quidditch in a storm, and his hair was a mess when I walked in your room." Hermione says and Harry just shrugs.
"Or we can stay here and hope McGonagall will find it in her heart to forgive us?" Harry has a cheeky smile on his face and Draco wants to give in but he knows he can't.
"I don't know what I'm doing." Harry looks beyond the lake, staring where the mountains meet the stars.
"Not you exactly, just, the idea of you not being here. You leaving. When school ends and I'm not gonna have you anymore." Harry sounds so genuinely scared that it breaks Draco's heart.
"I know, Potter. And may I say Poppy told me you have been eating and I am very proud of you." Harry bites his lip and looks down.
"Neither do I, Mione. See you later Draco." Harry says as he leaves their dorm, throwing his arm around Hermione's shoulders and resting his head on top of hers. Draco knows they're just really close and Harry is this close with everyone so it shouldn't bother Draco at all but he still glares at the back of Hermione's head as they walk out the door.
"They'll think you're even stronger. Harry admitting you need help is the bravest thing you've ever done." A tear falls down Harry's cheek and Draco wipes it away. The rain is falling so hard now that the pair can barely see the mountains and the lake through it.
"I am in love with Draco Malfoy." Harry says, not taking his eyes away from Draco, and Draco smiles the cutest smile and blushes like mad and lowers his head to hide behind his hair because every single person in the hall is looking between the two of them, waiting to see what happens.
"You're welcome." Harry stops sketching after that and goes back to trying to listen to Professor McGonagall.
"Draco are you okay?" He asks, making sure not to move his hand. Draco grabs the back of Harry's neck with the hand that isn't holding his and pulls him back towards him.
"Well I'm back in the dorm now, but it's awkward. I haven't really spoken to them." Harry says quietly.
"So where'd you go?" Draco asks after a few minutes and Harry glances at him before his gaze returns to the view. Harry is about to make something up, say Pomfrey just needed to check up on him, but he stops himself before the words can leave his mouth, deciding to tell the truth.
"I- I'll think about it. But, Professor I really don't think it's a good idea. I'm already the centre of everyone's attention and to be honest I just want them all to leave me alone." Harry mumbles.
"Harry sir, would you like something to calm you? Tea perhaps?" Kreacher asks and Harry sighs, stopping his pacing.
"I don't believe we've met." Harry interrupts him, and Brandon was obviously expecting Harry to stay quiet because it takes him a minute to comprehend what's happening.
"I don't go to Hogsmeade anymore. Get too much attention." He says and Harry sees the regret in his eyes.
"Harry! You look wonderful!" Narcissa smiles in greeting, pulling Harry into a hug, and Harry forces a smile at her. She looks amazing, in a very fancy and definitely expensive dress, and her hair and makeup look immaculate. Harry probably looks like shit in comparison.
"Draco there is no need to be jealous. I haven't slept with him in a long time." Harry says, but Draco is looking at the bed post.
"Harry have you been lying in this cold for 11 hours?" She somehow understands what he meant, and Harry nods, gesturing up to the sky. Luna lies beside him, expanding the warming charm so she can stay warm too, and looks up.
"They haven't been through as much as you, Harry. They were part of the war and they lost people, but you've been fighting your own battles since ye were a baby. You've been through more than any of them. That's why it affects you more than it effects them." Hagrid says and Harry nods.
"I have decided that you are allowed to go to your classes, on the premise that you return here and attend meal times in the great hall, and as much as you can I would like you to stay near Blaise, or Draco, in case your dizziness gets worse. This way you are not staying in the hospital wing all day, but we will be able to keep an eye on you." McGonagall says and Harry bites his cheek. He will be able to actually get up and leave the wing, but he will also have to go to meals and eat. That will suck. McGonagall must sense his reluctance because her face turns from 'determined teacher' to 'sympathetic mother figure.'
"What happened? Why did he tell you?" She asks smiling slightly. It takes a lot to make Harry blush and Draco's managed it without even needing to be there.
"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside, I'm not one of those who can easily hide..." Draco's never heard this song before, but the way Harry is singing it makes Draco's heart beat faster.
After a few minutes or sitting and watching Draco sleep Harry accio's his Transfiguration textbook to him and he decides to do some of the reading they were set to do over the weekend, reading with one hand, balancing the book on the arm of the sofa, and continuing to stroke Dracos hair with the other hand.
"He knows we're dorm mates. He also knows we've slept in the same bed every night for 2 weeks." Harry says and Draco's eyes widen.
"Doesn't change the fact that no one will want me to be part of the slytherin team. And they'll assume you only picked me as a seeker because I'm your friend." Draco mutters and Blaise sighs, shaking his head but agreeing not to say anything else about it.
When Harry grabs Draco's dick with one hand and kisses the tip Draco lets out a loud moan and Harry has to stop himself from groaning at how amazing that sound was. He licks along the underside of Dracos dick and when he gets to the end he sucks on the tip, making Draco tremble.
"Everything Hermione said is true." He says. Especially the stuff she said to Harry about being in love with Draco.
"Hey Harry, apparently we're dating." Dean shouts from one of the chairs near the fireplace as Harry and Hermione enter the common room.
"If you're gonna have attitude I don't think I want you sleeping on me anymore." Harry jokes and Draco pouts, gripping Harry's shirt.
"Stay here for a bit?" Harry asks, not wanting Draco to leave, and Draco glances hesitantly around the room. Harry grabs Dracos wrist lightly, tugging him closer so he sits on the edge of the bed next to Harry.
"Yeah." He says and Harry grins, grabbing his chin softly and turning Draco's face to look at him before pecking him softly on the lips.
"I'm proud of you." He says, knowing how hard it is for Harry, And Harry smiles slightly, connecting their hands. He never received praise as a kid, and he didn't really get any praise during school. It's nice to know someone is proud of him. "You heard from the Gryffindors?" Draco changes the subject, knowing if they spend too long talking about food Harry will start to feel guilty.
"I spoke to Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Zabini last night, and it's really important that you tell me the truth, Harry. Did you redirect a curse?" She asks and Harry sighs.
"It's cause of Teddy, Harry." She says and Harry raises an eyebrow at her, silently asking her to explain further.
"I'll go get madam Pomfrey." He says, and the second he walks out from behind the curtain Ron starts complaining.
”Yeah. You- you look great.” Draco echoes, blushing slightly, and Harry smiles slightly, nervously,  before standing up and turning back to Pansy.
Harry stands up and he can feel all eyes on him. Hermione nods encouragingly, probably sensing his nerves, and Harry catches Dracos eye. Harry watches Dracos face as he slowly pulls his shirt over his head, the tattoos moving at the lack of warmth, and Dracos eyes basically light up when he sees the wolf. Harry hears a few cat calls from his friends which makes him laugh. He also hears gasps from people and he doesn't know whether it's because of the scars or the tattoos. Hermione catches Harrys eye and she motions to Draco so Harry nods.
"I'm sorry Harry." George says before pulling away. "Come to the shop after class tomorrow yeah? We can have a good ol' chinwag." He jokes and Harry smiles.
45 minutes later they've got a 'perfect pepperup potion' according to Slughorn, and Harry and Blaise are walking out of potions and towards History of Magic. They have to walk slow because the fumes from being in potions have made Harry feel lightheaded and dizzy. Harry's bag is slung over his shoulder and the book Harry is now convinced belongs to Draco is in his right hand. He want's to ask Draco about it, he just has no idea how to.
"How can you be so sure?" Draco tries with a witty remark but he's kind of breathless and he sounds more needy than annoyed.
"I mean, you were reading and I kind of interrupted you." Harry says, slightly quieter, and Draco rolls his eyes. Harry is so broken and sad that he doesn't even sound confident when talking to the boy he supposedly hates. And it breaks Draco's heart.
"I got cold." He explains and Draco rolls his eyes but smiles slightly, Harry looks adorable all the time, but when he's wearing Draco's hoodie he looks amazing. Draco walks over and sits opposite Harry, cross legged. He's looking at the guitar, remembering how amazing Harry sounded when he played it, and wishing he could hear it again.
"Yeah, we should. Maybe not yet cause I haven't told Ron yet and I'm not sure how he's gonna react but I'm planning on telling him today at some point so maybe some time this week?" Harry offers and Blaise grins.
"Yeah, I knew that anyway. He told me he ran away and went to my dads. He said he was always welcome there." Harry explains. "It's kind of like me and the Weasleys. Which is why it fucking sucks that Ron doesn't like you, or me, right now." Harry says and Draco sighs, deciding to go and talk to Ron.
"Absolutely." Blaise says before they dismiss their teams and carry the chest back to the store cupboard.
"Ron and the Slytherin beater are having a fight in the quad. Kinda need help diffusing the situation." She says and Harry rolls his eyes before standing up and following Hermione out of the dorm, Draco following them both out too.
"Mister Zabini would you be so kind as to give us a moment?" Pomfrey asks and Blaise nods, standing up and leaving the hospital wing.
"I won't pretend I don't know how you feel, Harry. I was engaged once, to a muggle, whom I loved dearly, but my mother was a wizard and when my father found out it ruined their marriage, so I knew a relationship between wizard and muggle wouldn't work out, and I left him. I left him to prevent the inevitably painful end that would eventually happen, but in doing so I cut down the time I had with him. I could have had so many more years with him, but I was scared." She says, and Harry can hear the emotion in her voice. Harry doesn't know what to say. She has a point, as she always does, but Harry is still scared.
"What is it?" He asks, his voice breaking. Sirius left him something? What could there be? Everything he left to Harry was in his will.
"We went through this earlier, darlin." He says, smirking and Draco pouts at him. Harry smirks and gets up, walking over to Draco and putting his hands either side of Draco's head against the headrest. He's still standing up so Draco has to look up at him and his face is chest height as Harry is leaning.
"Good or things would've got very awkward very quickly." Harry says and Draco rolls his eyes before leaning forward hesitantly and pressing his lips against Harry's. Harry pulls away after a few minutes and chuckles slightly.
"Why it's Perfect. Absolutely perfect. I can feel it calming me down from here." He grins before moving on to the next pair.
"No one has spoken to me about it. Ron was mad I didn't tell him. Then again I don't tell him a lot of things these days so I should probably get used to that." Harry mumbles and McGonagall frowns.
"Yeah, should I give yours back now or take it to your office?" Harry asks and McGonagall says she can take it now, so Harry pulls it out of his bag and hands it over.
"The only people that knew were the members of the order and your aunt and uncle." She says and Harry frowns.
"Mister Potter, I know you are still not completely better, however I must ask you something." She says and Harry looks nervously at her.
"I can't do it." He whimpers as Sirius' fingers thread through his hair. His parents sit at the end of his bed, rubbing his legs comfortingly.
Harry sits at his usual table, Malfoy already there, and puts his bag on the table as he sits down and puts Teddy in his lap. Malfoy looks up from his textbook and frowns at Teddy for a second.
"Fuck Harry." He groans and Harry smirks, suddenly taking all of Draco. Draco's hands immediately grab Harrys hair and he groans which makes Harry groan. Harry bobs his head at a steady rhythm until he feels Draco getting close, when he varies his speed which drives Draco insane and it's not long before his fists are tightening in Harry's hair and he's moaning out Harrys name along with a few groans and mumbled 'fuck's' as his warm cum shoots down Harry's throat and he swallows it all.
"Harry, you still want us to keep the tattoo a secret?" She asks. They all know about it since they get changed in front of each other, but they don't know what it means. Harry nods.
"First of all, yes he is because he wants to forget about the war more than anyone and he knows we're all different now. Second, he hasn't got a choice anyway cause I co-own the shop." He says and Draco raises an eyebrow.
"Wanna talk about it?" Harry would say no but he's so tired and it's 4am. And Harry has missed Ron. He sees him as his brother, and things have been off for the past few months but he's missed him a lot and there's something about being on the edge of a high bridge at 4am in the cold with his first real best friend that makes him talk.
"The only time I've seen my parents alive was through Snape's memories and I'm not being funny but he was slightly jaded with hate for my dad and Sirius." Harry says and Draco nods.
"You jealous, Malfoy?" Draco focuses his gaze on his hand in Harry's. Harry is playing with his fingers absentmindedly and it makes Draco's heart flutter.
"You've never hated him, Draco." Draco rolls his eyes again but smiles down at his empty plate because he knows she's right.
"Me? Potter are you okay?" Harry shakes his head and grips Draco's arm tighter when he feels a wave of dizziness hit him. Draco wraps his arm around Harry to keep him up and sighs.
"Goodnight, Blaise." Blaise smiles again before getting into his own bed, sparing a glance at the two to see them both fast asleep, holding each other close.
"I left it in the store cupboard." He says as they reach the pitch and he starts walking over to the cupboard. Draco has stayed quiet since they left the common room, and Harry can't tell what he's thinking and it worries him slightly.
"I just need his help." Then, noticing her skepticism, he holds his hands up. "Honestly, Harry needs him."
"Are you fucking serious?" He shouts at the Slytherin, automatically casting expelliarmus and watching as the slytherins wand flies towards him at the same time a curse is fired at the Slytherin, not too bad but powerful enough to knock him to the floor. Harry frowns slightly before clocking who it was and looking at Draco, who is stood to his left a few feet away. Harry feels kind of happy that Draco would curse a Slytherin just because he threw a hex at Harry.
"Harry? Where you going?" Ron asks, his voice slurred with sleep, and Harry looks over to see him leaning up in bed.
"Come and eat, Harry sir, and then you must go to bed." Harry nods before pulling himself off the sofa, following Kreacher into the kitchen and sitting down. Kreacher fills his plate with pie and mash, covering it in gravy the way Harry likes, and then he sets the plate down. Harry really isn't in the mood to eat, but he knows he needs to, and it does look delicious, so he forces himself to take a bite.
The finish the walk to the great hall in silence and when Harry sits down in between Seamus and Dean they both automatically start piling food onto his plate so they know he will eat. Harry grimaces slightly at the thought of eating any more but he forces himself to take a few bites to keep his friends happy. After eating around 3 roast potatoes and a tiny piece of chicken Harry decides thats enough. He stands up, slightly too quickly as he gets a bit light headed, and walks out of the hall. He knows his friends are watching him as he leaves and they're probably worried that he hasn't really eaten since he's been back. What they don't know is that Harry hasn't really eaten since he died. He ate a bit when Kreacher would make him food and practically force him to eat it, but he never made himself food and if it wasn't for Kreacher he would have died of starvation months ago.
Happy New Year!!! I hope you all had a great Christmas/Holiday season! Mine was good thanks for asking except I got super sick on Sunday and had to call in sick to work yesterday (if you follow me on insta you will be well aware of that lol) I can't believe the decade is over! It's so weird to me that in this decade I started and finished secondary school and sixth form, finished my teen years and got a job I /mostly/ love that I've been at for 2 years now. Life is crazy. And terrifying. so terrifying.
"I've temporarily adopted a Gryffindor. Be nice." Blaise says to Draco as he sits on the sofa next to him, and Draco looks up, apparently just noticing Harry was in the common room. The second Draco looks at Harry's face his heart breaks. He looks so vulnerable with his red puffy eyes with dark circles under them and the fact that his hoodie sleeves are pulled down over his hands and he looks so small despite the fact that he's hench as fuck and Draco wants to hug him until he's better. But he can't, for obvious reasons.
"You wont curse me Draco." Harry breathes into his ear and Draco doesn't know how much longer he's going to be able to cope without grabbing Harry and kissing him. Harry is so sure of himself and he's right, Draco couldn't curse him. But he does hate how Harry can do nothing more than look at him and he's a gooey mess.
Harry tells her about the first time Draco comforted him and every night since then and how they use each others first names and about how Draco has nightmares sometimes too and how they act when it's just the two of them in their dorm room. The whole time he's talking he realises how weird it is to be doing all of this with Draco and how normal it all feels.
"Draco do you want to maybe breathe at some point?" Blaise asks as Draco takes bite after bite. Draco pauses and looks at him.
"Now come on, you go and find Draco and fuck him against a wall or whatever it is you do nowadays and I'll go talk some sense into my dumb ass little brother." George says, pulling Harry up off the wall and ruffling his hair in that brotherly way he and Fred always used to do.
"I wasn't really part of the family. They figured I'd be a wizard and didn't like it, so I was basically just treated as their servant. My uncle hated me and my aunt blamed me for my mums death. My cousin used to beat me up too. I slept in a cupboard under the stairs for the first 11 years of my life." Harry explains and Draco looks up at him in shock.
“As long as they’re okay I don’t care. But I’m thinking boy too.” Lily takes a deep breath then releases James hand before opening the envelope. She looks at the paper inside and grins.
"Amortentia." Harry hands him the bottle and Blaise smells it properly whilst Harry goes back to work. The sixth potion is blood-replenishing potion and the last is Essence of Dittany.
"Obviously not, Ronald." Hermione sighs, "Besides, we should be happy for him. He's finally getting along with Malfoy."
"You both look incredible! Way to make us all look like shit." Pansy says, and Harry rolls his eyes because Pansy always looks beautiful.
"Is he doing okay? You said earlier that he's got a lot on his mind." Draco asks, figuring now is a good a time as any.
"Mister Harry Potter should be in the great hall for dinner, sir." She says confused and Harry shakes his head as he gets a glass of water.
"I can't- I can't be near you anymore- it hurts." Draco doesn't move his hands, but he leans back slightly, taken aback by the statement.
"Speaking of..." Pansy smirks as she glances past Draco's shoulder. It seems Brandon has just noticed Draco's arrival and is staring at the back of his head. Pansy isn't sure he can see who Draco is with, but he must know, because everyone in the party has heard by now. Draco glances over his shoulder, leaning further into Harry's side as he does, and immediately turns back when he catches Brandon's eye.
"We can go hide in my room? Father said I have to stay down here for at least an hour but after that?" Blaise offers and Draco nods.
His session with Michael today was mainly about the past week. Harry tells Michael about how he doesn't see the point, how he can't sleep, doesn't feel like eating.
"So has anything happened yet?" Draco asks, because there's usually some drama at parties like this.
"You were the best keeper Rhys, don't tell the others, but you're welcome." Harry forces a smile, and Rhys grins.
They go back to their dorm room after half an hour and lie on Draco’s bed, Harry’s head in Draco’s lap, in a peaceful silence with Draco stroking Harry’s hair. But there’s something on Draco’s mind that he needs to talk to Harry about.
"Or it was tactical, Potter." Draco says, growling his last name just at the two girls walk past and he smirks when they start whispering.
"It's just- I'm scared." Harry admits and Draco looks so far into his eyes that Harry is sure he's seeing his soul.
"About?" Harry asks and Draco unconsciously bites his lip. Harry raises an eyebrow, trying to get Draco to answer.
"Somewhere I know no one will look for me." Harry says, not wanting to give his only quiet place away.
"Okay, don't touch anything for the next 5 minutes." Pansy says, finishing the last nail before sitting up. Draco turns his head to see how Harry looks and has to quickly turn back to the front because the thoughts running through his head are sinful.
"Weasley." Draco whispers back and Harry nods slightly, leaning away from Draco to look at Ron. Ron places his hand on Harry's shoulder and squeezes.
"You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue. Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean... yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen." Harry continues looking Draco in the eyes, and Draco knows his face is bright red but for whatever reason he can't break the eye contact. Harry's expression is unreadable as he continues, but he's admiring the way Draco is looking at him.
"I don't know." He mumbles, closing his eyes with a sigh. Draco's thumb strokes across his cheek again and Harry leans forward and rests their foreheads against each other again. Draco takes a deep breath before running a hand through Harry's hair.
"I'm glad. I would have had no idea who to choose if you had said no." McGonagall says with a small grin.
"No worries, as long as you don't fuck on my bed." Harry laughs, Draco blushes, and Pansy almost chokes on her drink. Blaise just chuckles as he pats her back.
"It is nothing extreme. I wonder if you will be able to look out for Harry as he has you. Not because you owe him, it was his choice to look out for you, but because I worry about the effect the trauma of his past has on him." She says and Draco knows she cares about Harry as much as he does, so he agrees.
"Hey Malfoy." He says, sitting down next to Hermione and she notices the sexual tension from where she's sat. Both boys get on with their work and Hermione almost laughs when they unknowingly take it in turns to stare at each other.
"Do- do you want to try and get some sleep now?" Harry presses his lips together. He would usually immediately say no to sleep, knowing that he will have nightmares, but if Draco is asking it might mean that he's going to stay with Harry whilst he sleeps, which means Harry wont have nightmares. Draco is watching Harry have some sort of internal battle, and waits patiently until Harry finally nods, eyes nervous for a split second before they shine with mischief.
"Oh Draco I'm so happy for you." She whispers and he struggles to get out of her grip. When she finally releases him he rolls his eyes.
"Well the only person I didn't want to see them has seen them so it doesn't matter." Harry explains and Ron nods in understanding.
"I don't want it so you have to have it." Draco says and Harry stares at the toast for a second before his eyes lift to meet Dracos.
”Who else wants their hair done?” Pansy asks and Blaise and Draco glance at each other before looking back at Pansy with their eyebrows raised.
"Potter how are you?" She asks and Harry shrugs, forcing himself to take a bite of a potato. He may have slept for a few hours but it was full of fear and nightmares and he still feels exhausted.
"Different passageway." He says before biting his lip and starting to turn around, but Draco squeezes his hand and stops him.
"Harry?" Draco whispers, sounding worried, which is understandable because Harry is gripping his side and staring at him but not seeing him, and Harry focuses back on Draco, catching the look in his eyes and the soft way he's rubbing Harry's side, and Harry almost cries because he doesn't know what to do.
The same thing happens at lunch, only this time Draco notices. They all had a great time in Harrys room and Ron and Hermione get on well with Draco now. They're at lunch sat on their respective tables and Harry sees a slytherin boy around a year younger start talking with a hateful look on his face to Draco. Draco looks kind of taken aback and hurt so Harry feels anger at the seventh year bubbling inside him. Suddenly Dracos tattoo growls and starts to breath ink fire across Dracos forearm and the kid walks away quickly. Draco looks confused before looking up and his eyes meet Harrys. Draco must notice the angry but guilty look on Harrys face because he motions to the door and walks into the entrance hall. Harry follows shortly after, leaving Teddy with Hermione and Ron. When Draco sees Harry he grabs his hand and pulls him down the closest corridor and into an empty classroom.
"Cause I'm depressed, Ron. I'm depressed and tired and so broken and I don't want to make him deal with me."
"Maybe when we've finished this potion you can drink some." Blaise says, stirring it slowly. It turns from muddy green to vibrant green. Harry huffs a laugh at his attempt to cheer him up, and Blaise smiles slightly.
"Alright fine but I'm not happy about it." Draco mumbles and Harry grins because sleepy Draco is adorable.
The grounds are empty as they walk back to the castle so they hurry up to the common room before they get caught. The eighth years have a later curfew than the rest of the school but they'll still get questioned as to why they're wandering around together at 11pm.
An hour after they woke up Draco decides they need to get up and go to breakfast so they reluctantly pull themselves out of bed and get dressed. Blaise wakes up half way through the pair getting dressed and gets up too, raising an eyebrow at the smile on Draco's face but not saying anything because whatever it is, he's sure Draco will tell him eventually.
"Draco, love, get up." Harry whispers and Draco opens his eyes and glares at him, but Harry called him love and he loves that so he gets up anyway.
"It's great to meet you!" She grins, holding out a hand, and Draco shakes it with a small bemused smile. Harry excuses them, telling Diane they have to go but he will see her later, before they continue to walk.
"I think if he sees how happy you and Draco make each other he wont be able to stay mad for long." Now that Draco has heard that George isn't trying to fuck Harry he feels a lot better about everything so he smiles slightly and walks round the corner so Harry will see him as he walks into the castle but so it doesn't look like he was snooping. As he's walking away, however, he hears Harry tell George he misses him and Draco wonders if he misses seeing him or misses fucking him and now he's confused again.
"When are you more okay?" Draco asks and Harry knows the answer immediately. Trying to convince himself to admit it out loud, however, takes a bit longer.
"Be right back." Harry says to Ron, who is doodling on his parchment, before walking over to Blaise who is standing near the store cupboard.
"Is there something you're not telling me? Because my tattoo starts to growl and then I look up and see you glaring at the kid that was being rude." He says and Harry sighs.
"Yeah. Greatest person I ever knew." Harry's voice has gone wistful and Draco holds his hand properly.
"Thank you, McGonagall." Harry says and McGonagall smiles at him as he leaves her office and heads back to his dorm.
"Well I appreciate you coming. I don't really know how I'd survive without you there." Harry smiles slightly and squeezes Draco's hand.
"Miss Granger I'm going to have to insist that you leave." She says as Harry shoots up, gasping for air, and he sat up so fast his head is spinning and he feels sick. Madam Pomfrey gives him a potion that Harry recognises as a calming draught and Harry has a sip of it before taking a deep breath and falling carefully against his pillows, shaking
"Are you okay?" Draco steps closer, turns to look at him, and Harry nods, pressing a quick kiss to Draco's cheek.
"But you love playing quidditch. And you can't tell me you haven't missed playing against Potter." He says with a knowing smirk and Draco shoves his arm.
"Of course not." They stay awake playing snap and chatting quietly until 2am when they both feel so tired they can't keep their eyes open, and Billy goes back to his own bed.
"He's in the shrieking shack. It's where he goes to escape. Or hide." Ron says and the look on Draco's face makes Ron stop walking.
"Yeah. Not my actual home, obviously, cause my actual home up until summer was with my aunt and uncle and that didn't count as a home cause it sucked and Grimmauld place doesn't really feel like home yet. You just smell comforting and warm." Harry says, slurring not because he's drunk but because he can't be bothered to form words properly.
It's a few days later and Harry hasn't spoken about what made him so upset and stressed the other day. Harry's kept to himself, and he goes on a run during dinner, after which Harry meets Draco, Blaise, and Pansy outside the hall and the four of them make their way to the Slytherin common room. Draco and Blaise sit on the sofa near the fire, Pansy sits in the armchair next to the sofa, and Harry sits on the floor, leaning back against the front of Pansy’s chair. Draco and Blaise are talking about something or another, Harry is half paying attention as he watches Draco, a glint in his eye that Pansy can’t help but smile about because he looks so entranced, she has no way of knowing that Harry is having the biggest internal battle he's ever faced. Pansy is watching Harry, and she grins when she sees a hairband around his wrist. She sits up straight, causing Harry to look up at her.
"Yeah cause everyone here definitely wishes they could fuck me right now." He mutters deadpan, "They totally don't want to rip my heart out or anything."
"I'm sorry I didn't help you. You know, that's the most I've heard you say in months." Ron jokes, and Harry smiles slightly.
"Run." He says briefly before leaving the room. He knows they're going to start talking about him again once he's gone but he can't bring himself to care. He takes off down the stairs and through the castle until he's outside, and then he starts running around Hogwarts grounds. On his third lap of the castle it starts to rain slightly and Harry regrets not putting on a jacket on. He's been running for an hour but he doesn't want to stop, so he continues running in the rain. His white t-shirt is now completely see through but there's no one here to see him anyway.
"Honestly I'd rather not enter the lions den again so soon." Harry nods and grabs his guitar before following Draco to the Slytherin common room. They make their way up to Draco's dorm room, both of them feeling extremely awkward, and when they get there they stand awkwardly. Harry is just now realising how tired he is, and the thought of sleeping feels enticing for once rather than terrifying, but when Draco took him to his room the other day Harry was pretty much out of it and it wasn't this awkward. Draco sits on the side of what Harry is assuming is his bed, and Harry sighs before sitting next to him.
"Watch it. I may be lying on your lap but I'll still curse the fuck out of you." Harry jokes and Draco rolls his eyes but Harry notices his pale cheeks turn slightly pink.
He runs and he keeps running until his legs go numb; and when he finally feels like his lungs are on fire and he's struggling to breath he slows to a light jog and runs for another half an hour before he stops, breathing heavily, and makes his way to his dorm so he can shower. He's not sure what time it is. He knows he missed dinner and it's dark outside but not too dark, so it's probably around 9pm. Harry showers on the sixth floor and by the time he gets back to his dorm he's exhausted. It's around quarter to ten and the beds in his dorm are unoccupied so he walks over and sits down, pulling the curtains around so he's hidden. He reaches into his trunk and grabs the notebook that he hid under clothes before sitting back against his headboard. He doesn't always open and read the notebook, and he doesn't always add to it, sometimes he just holds it, because even that is enough to remind him of every single thing that's ever happened to him. Today is one of those days. He's not adding anything new to the innumerable pages that he's written over the years. He's simply sitting there, on a Friday night, in the dark, the rain hitting the window and the distant sound of thunder accompanied by the occasional flash of lightning, wallowing in the horrific nightmare that is his past.
"What the fuck is that noise?" Dean asks and Ron looks over at Harrys bed to see his broom shuffling out from under his bed.
"What happened, Mr. Malfoy?" Madam Pomfrey asks and Harry listens carefully so he can hear their conversation.
"I'm okay. You can move." Draco murmurs and Harry nods, resting his head on Dracos shoulder as he slowly pushes all the way in and it takes all he has not to come from the sensation of that alone. Draco's hand is in Harry's hair and tugging hard whilst the other is gripping Harrys hand tight and Harry is concerned he's hurting him so he lifts his head to see Draco's face. His eyes are squeezed shut and his lips are parted slightly and swollen from the kissing and his eyes flutter open to look at Harry and Harry feels his heart explode.
"Ron my life was already hell. He's helped me a lot the past few weeks. Please mate, give him a chance." Harry pleads.
"Darlin you do realise just because he's third doesn't mean I want to date him. He just happened to be one of the people I used to start rumours." Harry kisses Draco on the lips before smirking.
"Were you looking at the Gryffindors or were you looking at mister Potter?" The boys pause. As soon as Harry raised his wand they both turned to look at him, surprised that Harry was going to fight his friends.
"The fact that you haven't eaten anything in days. The fact that you're avoiding your friends. The fact that you're sat in a dark unused classroom instead of playing quidditch with Weasley and Finnegan. Also if what Granger said is true then something is definitely wrong." He says and Harry rolls his eyes.
"Alright fine." He says, returning his hand to Harry's hair. Harry's eyes immediately flutter shut again and he looks so peaceful that Draco turns that 5 minutes into 30.
"Not really. I don't want to be an auror. I know I'd make a good auror and people expect me to become one. But I don't think I can. I don't really wanna be fighting dark wizards anymore. I've been doing that for 18 years." Harry explains and McGonagall nods.
"I- can we just go make sure he's okay first, please?" He asks and Ron nods, continuing the journey to the shrieking shack.
"Oh they definitely do." Pansy says with a smirk. "Just cause they're meant to hate you doesn't mean they can't appreciate your attractiveness."
"Well firstly obviously how it happened! But like, when did it happen, what did you say?" Blaise asks and Harry is glad he's happy for them and he's excited but he also feels like what they said is private, and honestly it's mostly things Blaise has heard Harry say before.
"Potter you missed dinner and you were out in a storm." McGonagall says softly so only he can hear, sounding like she doesn't know what she's going to do with him, and Harry bites his lip. He hates upsetting or disappointing her.
"Only partly. He came to see Ginny." Harry says, quieter so Ron doesn't hear. They basically were friends with benefits if he's being honest.
"He slept, Malfoy. With you. He slept when you were there. He slept peacefully. For the first time in months. When you were with him. No one else has made that happen." Ron says and Draco's eyes flash with realisation.
"Are you sure?" He asks, kind of breathless because hearing Draco ask Harry to fuck him is the best sound Harry has ever heard. Draco nods but Harry needs to know he isn't just saying this because he thinks it's what Harry wants to hear. Harry moves so he can see Draco's face and looks him in the eyes.
"I'll try not to take that personally." Draco mutters but he's joking and Harry chuckles at his response.
"Draco-" Harry pauses because this hurts too, the desperate look on Draco's face hurts, the way he's holding Harry's face so gently hurts, the way he's here hurts, and Harry just needs to say it. "It hurt's being around you, and it hurts looking at you, and it hurts touching you. It hurts so much, cause you're here, and you're not always going to be, cause you'll get sick of me or tired of dealing with me and I get it, cause I'd get sick of me too. So it's okay, that you're gonna feel like that soon, if you don't already, but it hurts. Knowing that hurts. It hurts cause you've got soft hair and the prettiest eyes and you're so damn beautiful that it hurts. It hurts cause I love you. I love you and it fucking hurts cause loving people always hurts. I'm already broken but I love you and it hurts cause you'll leave or you'll d- something will happen and it will hurt cause it always does. Loving people hurts, and I love you more than I've ever loved anyone." Harry chokes, and Draco is frozen in shock, and Harry whimpers again because he was expecting Draco to shout or laugh or tell him to get out.
"Yes, this is another secret passageway. This is my favorite one though, because my dad and his friends used to use this one all the time. We're in the shrieking shack. No it's not haunted, but I'll tell you that story later too." He says and Draco looks at him with so many different emotions on his face and Harry smiles.
"A drop." Harry hears after a few minuets and he looks to the side and see Malfoy looking at his essay.
"Oh, you're still up here. Hermione said she thought you'd left. Okay well I'll leave you two to it then." Draco says awkwardly and Ron looks at Harry before biting the inside of his cheek.
"What's wrong?" Harry knows this is the best chance he's going to get to tell Draco about the book. He also has no bloody idea how to tell him. Harry sits, legs crossed, looking at Draco, his eyes skimming over every inch of his face, trying to come up with a way to tell him; to thank him.
"Someone call the daily prophet! It will make the front page." She joins in and Harry rolls his eyes.
"Honestly Pansy the things you come up with. How on earth am I supposed to talk to Potter? We hate each other." Draco says and Pansy chuckles.
"Yeah." He says, glad he was able to make Harry feel better. They both finish getting ready and walk to breakfast and when Harry enters the hall instead of going to the Gryffindor table he walks straight to the teachers table at the top of the hall and to Professor McGonagall in the headteachers chair. He can feel the eyes of some students on him as he walks.
He sits in the very back corner during History of Magic, next to Blaise, and when Draco enters the classroom he sits on the other side of Blaise, Pansy next to Draco. Harry hasn't seen Pansy much, and he hasn't spoken to her at all, but she gives him a sympathetic smile as she sits down and Harry figures she's not that bad. Professor Binns is rambling on about something or another and Harry sighs, feeling the thoughts and emotions and fear taking over, and he knows he needs to get the hell out of the class before he has a full on breakdown.
”Go for it.” Harry says, and Pansy grins wider before jumping up and running to her dorm, returning with a makeup bag. She pauses when she sees Harry relaxing back against the chair, Dracos head resting against his thigh. Pansy smiles slightly before walking over. She drops the bag onto Dracos lap with a ‘hold this please’ causing him to sit up with a grunt because ‘Merlin this is heavy’ before Pansy sits herself on Harry’s lap.
"No, Draco. Now is not the time to read." Blaise says, taking the book from him, and Draco raises an eyebrow at his best friend.
"I know, I almost feel bad that we have to play against each other competitively." Harry says as he shuts the cupboard door. The two of them start to leave the pitch and walk up to the castle together and after a minute Blaise glances at Harry.
"Are you feeling better though?" Draco asks as they make their way down the stairs when Harry stumbles slightly into Draco.
Draco explains how they've been sleeping in the same bed for a few weeks and how they eventually kissed and now they're dating and their visit to Hogsmeade and the Weasley shop and when he finishes explaining Pansy smiles so wide Draco fears for her safety.
"They were gonna call her Iris." He says smiling. "I like it. It's a cute name." He adds and Hermione smiles too.
"There are people that disagree. I don't agree with them. Harry doesn't think you deserve that. Neither should you." She says before smiling slightly.
Ron walks into Harry's dorm and sees him sitting on his bed. Harry looks up, expecting Draco, and widens his eyes when he sees Ron.
"I want you to resume your post as Gryffindor quidditch captain." She says. She's hoping it will take Harry's mind off of everything he's been through. He used to love quidditch, and McGonagall thinks it will help. Harry looks at her in shock for a while before sighing and shaking his head. He doesn't want to be the focus of attention any more and being captain won't help.
"I used to say you were annoying and irritating." He whispers and Harry frowns. He wasn't expecting that. Draco sits up and turns to look Harry in the eyes. "But I've always thought you were the strongest person I've ever met." Harry's frown disappears slightly. "And that was without all the things in that book." He adds, raising a hand and running the pad of his index finger down Harry's forehead and along the bridge of his nose before cupping his cheek. Harry's frown disappears under the touch and he's left staring at Draco as if he personally put the stars in the sky. Draco never thought anyone would look at him like that. Like he's important. He kind of feels powerful when Harry looks at him like that. Feels like he belongs. Feels like he's where he's always meant to be. Harry leans forwards slightly and presses his forehead against Dracos, and Draco moves his hand from Harry's cheek to his neck, holding him close. They're sat like this for a while, just breathing each others air in the silence of the empty dorm room.
"I can't stop thinking, I just need my brain to shut up and it wont stop. I just want it to stop." Harry whimpers and Madam Pomfrey frowns.
"Potter, I can't begin to imagine how hard the past few years and months have been for you, but you can't give up or stop trying. I've had some of your professors say to me that you didn't try during your lessons today." McGonagall says and Harry sighs.
Harry and Draco hold hands as Draco leads them around the manor, and Harry can't help but look at every picture on the wall. It's homey now, nothing like the cold manor he was in before, and Harry watches Draco talk, smiles at how happy he seems now. He's not tense like he used to be. He jokes with his mother and he walks the halls slowly, calmly, rather than standing straight and stiff. Harry gets it, though. Gets why Draco was tense before. Having Voldemort in your house is not ideal, for anyone. And being forced to be on his side when you don't want to be is also not ideal.
"Well, should you want to, I would love to take you on as either a DADA or Quidditch teacher." McGonagall says and Harrys eyes widen.
"I think you need to leave." Draco speaks for the first time and his voice is dark and threatening. Ron keeps his eyes on Harry, and when Harry doesn't back down he falters slightly.
"I told him. I'm closer with George than I am with Hermione. And that's saying something." Harry says before seeing George talking to a woman. He smiles immediately.
"So I'm gonna go see him again after transfiguration." Blaise says and Draco doesn't look at him but Blaise knows he's listening.
"Will there be a next time?" Joey, sixth year Slytherin beater, asks sounding excited, and Harry and Blaise look at each other for a second as if having a silent conversation.
"What's going on?" Blaise asks, slowly walking over to stand beside Harry, Draco and Pansy waiting in the doorway to the greenhouse.
"Morning, Potter." He says quietly and Harry looks at him for a second, not expecting him to talk to him.
"Consider it done." He says before walking over to his friends, and Harry walks over to Hermione and Ron.
"Sleep?" Draco asks and Harry nods, lying down. Draco quickly changes into some comfier clothing before lying down next to Harry. They're both lying facing each other, and Draco is sure there's still a blush on his cheeks.
"Hey, Harry." Hermione says softly as he reaches her. Harry wants to smile back at her, but he can't.
"Well that's cause you're not trying hard enough." Draco says, rolling onto his side too. Harry bites his lip.
"Oh, er, Yeah sure." She says and Draco breathes a sigh of relief. Draco smiles slightly at her, figuring he can try and charm his way to the information.
He gets up and showers before getting dressed, grabbing his bag and making his way to the library. He has potions first thing for 2 hours, and as he's partnered with Zabini he won't have to talk to anyone, not until herbology third period. Harry reads until 8am when he makes his way to potions. He's half an hour early but he doesn't care.
"Harry?" Hermione snaps her fingers in front of his face and he looks up at her, his chin still resting on his arms. He doesn't say anything so she continues.
"Guess I gotta go, Potter." He says, standing up and grabbing his bag, not rolling his shirt sleeve back down but rolling his other up and Harry grins.
"Malfoy I don't blame you for that. We were arseholes to each other. And you didn't have a choice during the war. A lot of people didn't. You don't need to apologise Malfoy. But if it makes you feel better I forgive you." He says, his eyes sparkling with determination, truth and something Draco doesn't quite recognise.
"Trust you to know about a secret passageway." Draco says, secretly loving it, and Harry pulls him into the passageway.
"It's fine mother." Draco lets go of Harry's hand so he can kiss his mothers cheek. Harry thinks it's nice that they both seem a lot happier and less stressed without Lucius here.
"Oh brilliant idea pansy get us drunk that'll help the situation." Draco mutters, but they all make their way over to the bar anyway.
"How may I help you, Potter?" McGonagall asks, gesturing to the chair opposite her, which Harry sits down in.
"He sticks up for people that deserve it. He sticks up for people he cares about." Hermione says and Draco glances at the back of Harry again. He's leans against the bar, chatting to the barman, and Draco can't help but feel jealous when the barman smiles as he hands over the drinks. Harry walks back over to the table and his heart flutters slightly at the way Draco is watching him. Harry puts the drinks on the table before sitting next to Draco, pressing his knee against Dracos and Draco has to bite the inside of his cheek in order to stop himself from grinning like a lunatic in the middle of the pub.
"Harry forgave you, you know. He knew you didn't have a choice. When I asked him why he was going to testify for you he said that both you and your mother saved his life, and that it wasn't your fault. He couldn't bare to see innocent people spend their life in Azkaban like his godfather had to." She says and Malfoy looks intrigued and is about to say something else when a voice they both know well is heard.
"I just had the best conversation I've ever had ever at all in my whole life ever." He says, not attempting to stop the almost grin on his face.
"Harry?" He hears a soft voice call him and he opens his eyes to see he's surrounded by everyone, except this time Fred isn't there.
"By making sure your future husband is okay? You should be thanking me." Blaise say, placing his hand over his chest feigning offence.
"I hope so. Take a seat Potter." She says with a smile and Harry turns around to see most of the class is here. He walks over to his table in the back corner and sits down, pulling his hoodie sleeves over his hands. He knows people are watching him, his money is on Ron and Blaise, but he doesn't lift his gaze from the desk in front of him to check. McGonagall starts the class and Harry decides to spend the lesson writing his essay for potions, since he knows everything McGonagall is talking about.
"Well, if you insist. You may go. And as you actually did the homework you do not need to come to detention." He says and Harry nods, leaving the classroom. He walks to his next lesson, History of Magic, and arrives just before the class starts. He places his essay on Professor Binns desk, who nods as a thank you, before making his way to his seat in the middle of the right row, next to Ron and behind Hermione. Draco is sat in the row behind Harry and a few seats to the left, and Harry can feel Dracos eyes on him through most of the lesson. Harry doesn't pay attention, though, and instead decides to read. Harry finishes sense and sensibility half way through the lesson and takes to looking out the window for the last half an hour. Hermione keeps turning round to ask if he's okay and Ron keeps giving him worried looks throughout the class and by the end of the hour he's had enough. The second Professor Binns says they can go Harry is out of his chair and on his way to the library before anyone can so much as call his name.
Harry eats most of his dinner, to Hermione's joy, and at around 8:30 they head up to the common room. Dean and Seamus have decided to throw a pre game common room party so Harry ends up going up to his dorm room at 3am quite drunk and extremely tired. Harry saw Draco disappear from the common room a few hours ago and is actually very excited to be alone with him. He walks into their dorm to see Draco lying on his own bed. They usually sleep on Dracos bed because Draco is a stroppy git but Harry doesn't mind; it smells like Draco. He strips to his boxers before climbing into bed next to Draco.
"I love how you can go from being a confident, arrogant prick to being a blushing, adorable mess." Harry says softly and Draco looks down at the ground below the bridge, willing his blush to go away.
Harry disappears just after Herbology. Draco and Blaise look for him, but when they can't find him they decide to go to their next class and hope he turns up soon. Harry walks around, finding himself outside of a classroom full of students currently being taught by Professor McGonagall. She catches his eye before frowning in concern before addressing the class of first years.
"I'm just- I feel bad, cause you help me so much, and I don't do anything to thank you." Harry says and Draco squeezes his hand again.
The two spend a while talking, Harry tells Ron everything about the pensive and the memories and him and Draco, skipping the details to spare Ron being scared for life, and their trip to hogsmeade and about Iris.
"How am I meant to practice and train my team if every 5 seconds someone is asking me who it is?" Harry groans into his duvet before letting go of his broom, letting it fall to the floor with a quiet thud.
"Oh yeah, you're cousins." He says, accidentally out loud, and Malfoy looks at Teddy for a second longer before looking at Harry.
"Well it's a lot less than everyone assumes. Yeah I've fooled around with a lot but I didn't fuck everyone I've kissed." Harry says and Draco stays quiet, willing Harry to go on.
"You need to sleep, though." Harry grimaces slightly. He hasn't slept in days and he doesn't want to but he is so tired. Harry sighs before nodding and standing up.
"Hopefully they'll come to their senses soon, cause we've only got a month until Christmas and I don't want Harry to be alone for the entire break." Ron agrees, and they share a few more words before parting.
"Will you fuck me?" The second the words leave Draco's lips Harry's grip tightens on his waist and he feels his dick twitch.
"You okay?" Draco asks and Harry nods because he's really not but how on God's green earth is he going to even begin to explain to anyone why he both needs Draco more than anything but also can't be near him anymore because he just keeps falling further and further in love with him and it's not fair. Nothing is fair.
"During practice they we're chatting and making jokes and stuff, like it was the most I've seen Harry talk since before the war."
"I know." They look at each other for a few seconds before Harry continues walking, Blaise not following him. Harry walks around for a little bit longer before stopping at a tree by the lake, settling on the grass and resting back against the trunk, one leg out in front of him, the other bent at the knee. He looks out across the river and sighs. He really needs to tell Draco what he meant this morning, he just has no idea how to and he's terrified.
"Welcome back everyone, and welcome to the first years. We will shortly be handing out your timetables, but before we do, I want to say a very big well done for the people in this hall who returned after the events that occurred here, we are very proud of you all. Secondly, to the first years, I hope your time here is only full of learning and happiness. Head boy and Head Girl will be decided by the end of the week, and last, but most important. Quidditch. Those of you that want to try out for your teams, speak to your head of house by the end of the week. Okay, I won't bore you any longer, we will now pass out your timetables." She finishes before walking straight over to Harry.
"We played quidditch. He might have hit his head when we collided. But he said something about legilimency too." Blaise says and Madam Pomfrey sighs.
"I'll be back soon, yeah?" He says to Harry before leaving their dorm in search for Ron. He finds him at the bottom of the stairs by the great hall and figures he wont talk to him unless he's made to, so Draco grabs his arm and pulls him into the nearest classroom.
"What!" Ron asks, his voice a mix of anger and confusion, and Ginny shrugs. She came straight to the boys dorm after practice, where Hermione is sat at a desk, Neville and Ron are on their respective beds, and Seamus is lying in between Dean's legs, resting back against his chest.
“Draco, what’s wrong? You look like a lovesick puppy.” Pansy teases and Draco glares at her. It's been 2 hours since Potter left the library and he can't stop thinking about how unhappy he looked.
Harry actually eats at breakfast, much to Hermiones joy, and he can feel Draco's eyes on him all the way through breakfast. When he gets onto the pitch and shakes hands with the Ravenclaw captain he can basically feel Dracos burning glare on Jason Samuels. The second Harry mounts his broom and kicks off he spots Draco in the stands, next to Pansy. His gaze is fixed solely on Harry because Draco has always thought Harry looked very attractive when he was flying, even more so when he's in his quidditch uniform. Harry catches Dracos eye and winks before flying off to find the snitch.
"Finally!" He all but jumps onto the bed and pulls Harry into a hug, grabbing Draco's arm and forcing him to join in, causing them to end up lying in a heap. "Merlin I've been waiting for this day for years!" Blaise pulls back a little so he can grin at Harry and Draco before he gets off them. Harry and Draco sit up, hands still connected, and shift so they're both sat leaning against Draco's headboard, and Blaise sits down on Draco's bed opposite them.
"Harry, I am glad you came back here. I know it can't have been easy." She starts and Harry shrugs, looking at her desk rather than looking her in the eye.
"What is it, Draco?" She asks, clearly expecting him to insult her or something. Draco considers changing his tactic and going for the 'make her angry' route, but she looks stressed and tired and he's not the same person he was when he was 14 and he doesn't want people to think he is.
"It's an invisibility cloak. Don't want anyone to see where we're going." Harry whispers, his face so close to Draco's. Harry grabs Dracos hand and pulls him closer to the tree, smiling at Draco's hesitation.
"We could go to the Gryffindor common room? The sofas comfy and the fire's warm." Harry suggests and Draco bites his lip.
"I don't want you anywhere near my name. It doesn't deserve you. Besides, I want to be a Potter." Draco says and Harry smiles slightly.
"Okay, we decided that for today's practice we could play against each other. Now this is a friendly game, not a competition. If there's any foul play I will kick you off the team." He says to his Slytherin team and Harry nods. Ginny, who had been confused why the Slytherins were here, is frowning. When did Harry and Zabini get friendly?
"Harry, listen, we're hoping to close the tattoo pools today, so would you be willing to show your tattoo at dinner?" He asks and Harry bites his lip, he was only opposed to people knowing about it because he didn't want Draco to know how he feels, but now he knows Harry has nothing to hide. And it would be a cool way to show everyone that knows about his tattoos his new one. Hermione will know why he got a wolf straight away, as will Draco.
so I thought I'd post again this week because I'm a lovely person and I love you. It is absolutely for that reason and definitely not because I'm bored at work. Definitely not. Maybe a little. Anyway hope you enjoy :)
"Well, my godfather went to Azkaban. He was there for 12 years." He says, and Draco knows this. Sirius Black was in Azkaban and he escaped. All Draco knows is people kept saying he was on the Dark Lords side.
"Do you think there'll be a day when I can compliment you without you blushing?" Harry asks, running his hand along Dracos arm before wrapping it round his waist.
"Okay. So here's the thing." He says, looking at Ron. "You know how Draco and I called a truce?" He asks and Ron nods slowly.
"You came to get your book?" Blaise asks, noticing the book on Harry's bedside, and Harry shakes his head.
"Because I can't look at Ron without seeing Fred. I can't look at Hermione without remembering what Bellatrix did to her because of me. You remind me of what happened. And who we lost because of me. I can't- I'm not- I can't." Harry says before he walks out of the greenhouse and over to greenhouse 6. He walks straight to the back corner and sits down, not bothering to see where anyone is sat, he just keeps his head down, pulling his sleeves over his hands in a lame attempt to stop them shaking. Seamus walks in and sits down silently, not knowing how to tell the others what Harry said. No wonder he hasn't spoken to them. How did no one realise what he was going through?
It turns out that his friends were all in the girls dorm room, probably having fun without Harry. He heard laughter when he walked past as he was on his way to bed at 3am. He figures him being depressed is too much for his friends to deal with, so he decides that if they can't be around him then he shouldn't force his presence upon them. He wakes up at 5am on Sunday after a series of nightmares, and showers and gets ready before going straight to the library. He sits in a different corner to his usual one, knowing his friends won't look anywhere other than there. He sits in a corner right next to the restricted section as no one really goes in there, and settles into an armchair, pulling out another muggle book. He knows he shouldn't be surprised but he still feels his chest ache with every hour that passes. He doubts his friends are even looking for him. Why would anyone look for him. He doubts they've even noticed his absence. Harry runs his hands through his hair and grips it tight, trying to force the thoughts out of his head, to no avail. He sighs and puts his book down, making his way up to the hospital wing. It's empty which is to be expected, and when Harry walks over to Madam Pomfrey she looks at him in shock.
"I have something that may help him. I was instructed, by Mr Black and Mr Lupin, to wait until his 21st birthday. However I feel that he should have them now." She says before sending her patronus to go and get Harry.
"Ye need to talk about it to someone, 'Arry. Doesn' have to be me, but someone." Harry nods. He knows Hagrid is right, he just doesn't know who, or how he would even start to explain. He also really doesn't want to burden anyone else with his problems.
"Yeah." Harry grins. Ron holds out a hand and Harry grabs it, letting him pull him up, and the second he's standing he's pulled into a hug by Ginny, shortly followed by the rest of the team.
"No! Well... sometimes we just want to have a laugh, mate." He mumbles, hesitant, and Harry instantly feels nauseous. He knows he shouldn't but he can't help it. Before he can stop himself he's looking into Rons mind.
It's 45 minutes after they got to the library, and Draco lets out a small groan, resting his head in his arms. He's just finished his essay, and he has a headache.
Anyway we're back to our regular scheduled programming :) I hope you are all enjoying this and I hope you like the new chapter :) <3
"Harry it's okay." Draco says again, running his hand down Harrys arm and grabbing his hand, his other hand cupping Harry's neck.
"You're evil." Draco says, still blushing over the fact that Harry called him babe. Harry just grins and winks at Draco before pecking him softly. Draco still can't get his head around the fact that he can now kiss Harry whenever he wants. When Harry pulls away from Draco completely and sits on his bed, grabbing a book and opening it, Draco looks confused for a second before the door opens and he realises why Harry moved away.
“Was that so hard?” Harry says softly and Draco smiles and blushes against his neck. Draco nods and Harry chuckles leaning away from Draco slightly so he can see him. He loves the way he looks when he's blushing, so he just looks at him with a small smile on his face. Draco has no idea why Harry is watching him but it gives him a reason to watch Harry so he doesn't mind. Harry looks amazing with that small smile and his shining eyes and his hair that Draco secretly loves and think looks amazing despite it being an absolute fucking mess.
"I know you don't wanna talk, but I want to cheer you up somehow, Harry. So you don't have to say anything if you don't want to, but mate you need to help me help you." Seamus says, his tone soft and gentle, and Harry turns to look at him to see Seamus looking desperately into his eyes. Harry feels slightly guilty because he has no idea how Seamus can help him. He just want's to take his mind off of everything that happened and that's going on and his brain won't shut up and he just wants it to stop. At least for a while.
"Hermione is gonna be back soon." He breathes, knowing he should get off of Draco because he doesn't really want anyone to know what just happened; he's not even sure what it means. The only problem is in order to get off of Draco he'd actually need to move and he doesn't want to move away from him.
"He escaped Azkaban and was wanted by the ministry because they thought he was trying to help Voldemort. He said we'd live together when everything was better. But he was killed fifth year." Harry says sadly.
"Now for the moment you've all been waiting for." They shout and Harry rolls his eyes as they motion for him to stand up. Harry feels slightly self conscious as he goes to stand up. He has a great body, he knows that, but it's covered in scars from the war and from being beat up throughout his childhood.
"It is nothing personal, Mister Malfoy, I just need Mister Potter to try and get as much rest as he can today. He had a visitor earlier and it did not do him any good." Madam Pomfrey explains and Draco frowns but nods.
"No." Harry says immediately, a small smile on his face. "No, my mum was so accepting there's no way in hell she would have minded, that I'm bi or that I'm with you. My dad was the same, so he wouldn't have cared either. Sirius maybe." Harry says and Draco raises an eyebrow.
"There's 4 bets. If it's colour or black, or both, how big it is and what it is, then the additional if you have more than one." Hermione fills harry in and he rolls his eyes.
"Won't tell a soul Malfoy. I didn't have you down as a softy." Harry teases and Draco glares at him before unwrapping Teddies arms from him.
"Harry how haven't you noticed? You make him so nervous and he makes you stronger. You make each other happier." She says softly and Harry bites his lip.
”Beautiful, Pansy.” Blaise says and Pansy walks over to a mirror on the wall before turning back to the three boys.
"Dumbledore. Said I was protected from Voldemort because of my mum. And I had to stay with my aunt because it kept that protection going. If I stayed with them then Voldemort couldn't find me." Harry says, absentmindedly playing with Draco's fingers of the hand he's holding. "Also, you know, I didn't have anywhere else to go. Rather be miserable in their house than miserable and homeless." Draco nods slightly in understanding.
"Malfoy?" Weasley asks, sounding more shocked than anything else, and Draco's gaze snaps over to him.
"You think we've caused enough chaos?" Draco murmurs, his head resting on Harry's shoulder, tracing the scars on his torso, still slightly breathless from what he and Harry have spent all morning doing.
"Headache." Harry looks at him for a second before standing up. He walks over to Draco and throws one leg over the chair Draco is sat on, sitting behind him on it so Draco's back is pressed against Harry's chest.
"I think I'm gonna head to my room guys." Harry says, briefly disturbing their conversation and Hermione frowns.
"It is too late, master Harry. It is time to leave." Harry sighs, feeling slightly like he could throw up or pass out any second.
"Well yeah, can't argue with that. But you're also very pretty." Harry says and Draco looks shocked.
"All I need to do is make sure people hear me saying someone's name in a 'totally whispered and secretive' conversation, so I'm gonna go recruit Hermione." Harry says before winking at Draco and leaving the dorm room.
"Are you okay?" Draco asks and Harry sighs. Not really. He's head over heels in love with Draco but will never tell him and he wishes he could talk to Draco but he can't and he keeps thinking about the blond boy that has somehow taken his heart and ran off with it. Of course he can't say that so he just mutters that he's fine.
"Okay." He says, but everyone can hear how nervous he is about it. McGonagall looks at him for a second before walking back towards the doors. As she opens them she runs into Ron and Hermione.
"No worries, 'Arry." Hagrid pats his shoulder once before seeing Harry out of his hut, and Harry feels a little bit better for talking to him.
"A beautiful mess. Harry considering what you went through you're doing amazing, darling." Lily says and Harry nods.
"I'm so sorry, Jamie. I couldn't stay there." Sirius says, his voice trembling, and James wraps his arm around Sirius's shoulders and leads him into the front room, where a man and woman are sat. Harry guesses they're his grandparents.
Thank you so much for being so sweet and understanding and supportive on the last chapter, and I'm so glad you're all sticking with me and this fic <3
They both fall asleep lying facing each other on Dracos bed shortly after, waking up hours later when Hermione comes in to get Harry for dinner. She walks in and sees them lying together and thanks God that she convinced Ron to meet them in the hall rather than come with her to get Harry. She almost doesn't want to wake them up because they look so sweet and content and happy. But she knows Harry needs to eat so she walks over to the side of the bed Harry is lying on and gently grabs his shoulder.
"You okay, Harry?" Seamus asks quietly and Harry shrugs before shaking his head and resting it on Seamus' shoulder, sighing.
"Well all of my other supposed friends were listening to the conversation so yeah." Harry mutters, not knowing what he's going to do. He really can't face anyone. Not now they know he died and especially not after what he saw in Ron's mind.
"Oh my god how did it take me this long to realise?" She mutters before she grabs her book and stands up.
"I know you still can't talk to me because of Fred. But it's okay, Harry. We miss him, but we're okay. None of us blame you. You don't need to feel guilty, Harry." Ron says and Harry feels a tear roll down his cheeks.
They make their way to the hall, Harry and Draco's little fingers linked together, and Harry can feel Ron looking over at him. Harry meets his gaze and smiles slightly as a greeting, and Ron smiles back. Draco spots McGonagall looking at Harry out of the corner of his eye and turns to look at him, frowning when he sees there's still no food on the plate in front of him. He's sorted out Harry's sleeping problem, now he needs to try and help him with the not eating thing. Only problem is, he has no idea how to do that. He briefly considers asking Madam Pomfrey but decides against it; last time she tried to help him eat it was with an appetite booster potion and Harry noticed immediately. Maybe he should just try asking him? Or he could take him to hogsmeade at the weekend and see if he'll eat there? But then Harry has therapy on Saturday and training and Draco isn't sure Harry would even want to go to Hogsmeade with him. Could he- no. That's a definite no. He couldn't possibly talk to Granger or Weasley. He would, of course, if it meant helping Harry, but Draco knows for a fact that Granger and the whole Gryffindor gang hate him. Weasley asked him to help Harry, so maybe Weasley is his only option. Although would Weasley actually be able to help?
"You okay?" He asks, voice soft, and Draco smiles, leaning forward and pressing a gentle kiss to his lips.
"Stared at the ceiling, stared out the window, played guitar, wallowed in self misery, all that fun stuff." Harry says with a sad smile, and Draco wants to wrap him in a hug and never let go.
"Harry James Potter you do not voluntarily fall off your broom." Harry hears and he turns around to see McGonagall walking onto the pitch. She's still head of Gryffindor and, even though he shouldn't have voluntarily fallen 6 foot he knows she's glad he won.
"Harry stay at the manor tonight." Draco pulls back to look at him, eyes pleading, and Harry can't bare to disappoint or upset him, but he also doesn't- "You won't be intruding." Harry rolls his eyes.
"No rude remarks. In fact we actually help each other if we notice the other one is stuck." Harry says and she raises an eyebrow.
"I love you too." He says quietly and Harry grins, grabbing Draco round the waist and kissing him fiercely, holding him tight, Draco's arms wrap around Harry's neck and he kisses back just as passionately. It's not long before Harry feels Draco's dick harden and he knows his is too, so he pulls Draco's body flush against his, so every part of them is touching, and moves his mouth from Draco's lips to his neck, starting to suck and nibble and lick, loving the sounds Draco is making.
"I'm going to assume you've used the pensive before?" McGonagall says and Harry nods. The box is divided into quarters, 50 vials from each person, their first name initial is on the lid of each vial, and there's 50 attached to the lid, all with gold lids.
"Okay." Harry makes his way up to her office and takes a seat in the chair at the desk, wringing his hands together whilst he waits. He's not sure why he felt the need to talk to McGonagall, he just knows that she's like a mother to him and he can talk to her, above anyone else. It doesn't take long for McGonagall to get there, and when she enters she sits behind her desk and looks at Harry softly.
"Blaise?" A third year walks over to him and Draco, looking slightly nervous and worried. Pansy went to bed a few minutes ago, and Blaise and Draco have been sat chatting by the fire.
"Draco- you-I need to leave. I need to go." Draco starts to panic now, because how did he fuck this up? Did he do something wrong?
"No you're not." He says, and his tone is so much softer and more caring the Harry ever thought possible, and then before Harry can even respond Malfoy is turning around, opening the window and walking out of the bathroom. Harry stands still for a second, half because the room hasn't cooled down yet and he still feels dizzy, but also because his stomach is going crazy right now because Malfoy isn't just beautiful, he's also soft and caring. Although, does he care? Or is Harry seeing what he want's to see? Harry sighs before pulling on some clothes and grabbing his stuff, making his way to his dorm to put it all away before he has to go to herbology.
"Mr. Malfoy, I would like a word with you. Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy will not be long and I'm sure he will be happy to meet you in your dorm room." McGonagall says and Harry's grin falters slightly before glancing at Draco.
"Do I get the feeling your fears are somewhat to do with Mr. Malfoy?" Harry nods, looking up at McGonagall again.
"You just had a chat? Nothing happened? At all? Nothing? You? You are capable of being in the same room as someone you've fucked without fucking them?" Seamus asks, sounding genuinely shocked, and Harry smirks.
"Harry! How you feeling?" Blaise steadies him before looking him over. When he's satisfied that Harry seems okay he looks him in the eyes again.
"Hey Siri, come in, what happened?" James asks, grabbing Sirius' arm and pulling him into the house, taking his backpack and putting it on the floor by the stairs.
"Is he gonna want any of this?" Draco asks before seeing a plushy snitch and grabbing it. "No okay I'm getting him this." He says and Harry chuckles at how childlike and adorable he is.
but that hardly gives anything away, it could have been written centuries ago. Even though there's a nagging in the back of his mind that he swears he's seen this writing before. Harry closes the book with a sigh and puts it on the wall in front of him, not knowing where to go from here. He's never going to figure out where the book came from. Whoever gave it to him obviously doesn't want the book back, unless they're going to ask him for it, but he seriously doubts that. He just sighs, grabs the book and hops off the wall before making his way to his usual table in the corner of the library.
"Yeah, love." Draco leans up, presses a kiss to Harry's jaw, and Harry shifts so he can kiss Draco properly.
"But you must eat, sir. Winky insists." She says and Harry sighs, forcing down a few bites of the roll she hands him. Winky doesn't look pleased but seems to be fine with the fact that he's actually eaten something, and hands him another glass of water, which Harry downs gratefully.
Ron's surprised when he walks into his dorm room to see Harry and Draco sitting on Harry's bed, holding hands and leaning against each other. Not because they're so close, but because Draco being in the Gryffindor tower is a rare occurrence, one he's only witnessed once. Harry's gaze meets Rons, and he looks tired but less so than he used to, and Ron smiles slightly.
"Well I can solve one of those things." Blaise smirks and Harry glances at him nervously. Blaise must know about the book.
"I know." He mutters, pulling away from the hug and resting his head on Dracos shoulder. Hermione smiles sadly at Harry before leaving them alone, deciding to catch up with Harry later.
"Productive? I think I'm being very productive, considering my goal was to turn you on so much you're begging for it." Harry says and Draco whimpers slightly.
"Okay, Potter. Well, I have informed your professors that you will not be in class today so stay here and rest." She says and Harry sighs but nods. He would really rather do something to distract him from his thoughts but he knows Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall are going to make him stay here.
He enters the library and walks to the back corner, hidden by bookshelves, before sighing and collapsing onto a chair. He pulls out his charms homework and starts writing. He feels someone sit at his table at some point and glances up from his essay to see Seamus sat opposite him. He doesn't say anything, just pulls out an astronomy textbook and starts reading, so Harry gets back to his essay, realising that this is the first time he's been around people and they haven't tried to make him talk or explain.
Draco rushes through dinner, wanting to get back to Harry as soon as possible so he can go back to sleep. Blaise is watching him as he all but inhales his food.
"Yo!" Dean shouts, after a nod from Harry, and the Gryffindors automatically stop talking and look at Harry. Harry tries to ignore the stands, which are full of around 50 students, and clears his throat. He hasn't spoken to this many people in a while. He catches Ginny's eye, of course she's trying out, and she smiles encouragingly at him.
Harry spends most of the lesson staring at Malfoy or feeling Malfoy stare at him, and by the time the lesson ends Harry realises he took barely any notes. He's going to need to ask Hermione for hers so he can do the essay. They walk out of the dungeons and Harry turns to Hermione.
Quick note though, your comments from the last chapter made me so damn happy and I really bloody love you <3
Hufflepuff beat Ravenclaw 240 - 90 and then Harry, Ron, Hermione, Seamus and Dean go to lunch before their DADA class. Harry knows he's the best at DADA and as they're learning about what a patronus is for he kind of zones out, allowing the guilt to consume him for the first time in a while. His mind goes to Sirius and the time he saved him from having the dementors kiss and he sighs, staring out the window at the students on a free period sitting in the sun, some reading, some laughing, some sun bathing, some chatting. Harry remembers the memory he watched the other day of his dad, Sirius and Remus sitting under a tree chatting and laughing and being so happy and so care-free.
Hello you lovely people, quick question for ya, how many chapters/how long should I make this? Like I can make it slow burn af or I can end it in 5 chapters but idk what you would want to read??
"Mate?" He asks and Harry feels his eyes brim with tears. He can't stand it. Why is everyone so okay when it comes to what happened? Why are his 'friends' insistent that he can't talk to Blaise just because he's a slytherin?
"All of it." Draco says nervously and Harry smiles slightly. He wasn't that drunk last night so he remembers everything he said.
Draco feels his heart break slightly, so he shuffles back on the bed, rolls Harry over so he's facing him, and pulls him into his chest, holding him tight again. Harry's face is buried into his neck and Draco can't help but thread his fingers through Harry's hair like he's so desperately wanted to do since he was 12. Harrys hands are clutching onto Draco's thin t-shirt for dear life and Draco frowns.
"Thank you Harry." He smiles, not even realising he used his first name, and a grin spreads across Harrys face as he turns to look at the blond.
"What he means is, Harry you can't help who you fall in love with. Trust me." Lily says and James gasps at her.
"Oh I know, but I think it suits you." Rhys smirks and Harry rolls his eyes before making his way to the hospital wing.
"From McGonagall?" Harry shrugs. He know's it's not. He still hasn't given her Sense and Sensibility back, which he needs to do. And she wouldn't secretly give him a book, she'd just hand it to him. When Harry enters the great hall it's already nearly full. He decides to ask McGonagall, just in case, so rather than walking over to the Gryffindor table he walks to the teachers table.
"Malfoy, can I have a word?" Ron asks, and Malfoy looks up at him confused before nodding, following Ron out of the library. Ron turns to look at Malfoy and Malfoy can see the desperate look in his eyes.
"Potter, how are you doing?" She asks and Harry shrugs, hoisting his backpack strap further onto his shoulder.
"Potter are you sure dreamless sleep would not be beneficial to you?" She asks and Harry shakes his head.
"You don't have to worry about that either. We both know my father hates you, not that his opinion matters, but mother likes you." He says and Harry raises an eyebrow, sitting up.
"I still can't look at them, but I also don't want to talk to them. I don't really want to talk to anyone."
"Eh, they did worse than that I'm just not really... Basically they just liked to make sure I was aware of just how unwanted and unloved I was." Draco can't bare the look in Harry's eyes so he surges forwards and pulls him into a hug. He wants to know just how bad it was, but he also knows that this is hard for Harry to talk about and he probably doesn't feel like talking about it all right now.
"It's not just me, either." He says, squeezing Harry's hand. "Dorm feels weird without you in it." He smiles and Harry's gaze finds it's way to Draco before flicking back to Blaise.
"Yeah." They both stand up, legs aching slightly from being sat down on the hard ground for so long, and make their way up to the castle. When they enter the great hall there's only a few first and second years there so Harry follows Draco over to the Slytherin table and sits next to him. No one casts a second glance and Harry feels slight relief wash over him.
"Harry!" Hermione calls and Harry sighs. People have started leaving the hall now and those around are looking at him and Hermione. Harry stops walking, halfway up the stairs, and turns to look at Hermione. He pulls the bottom of his top up so he can wipe his face with it whilst he's waiting and when Hermione gets to him she frowns.
"What- Where's this coming from?" Draco asks softly, his hand moving from Harry's hair to his cheek.
Okay this is just a short chapter but it's an update nonetheless! I am so sorry it's been like nearly 3 months, but I've just been having a real shitty time. I hope you're all staying safe and well, and I also hope you wont have to wait another 3 months for the next chapter, which will be all about the party!
"Ready." He says, releasing the bludgers and the snitch, throwing the quaffle in the air. Harry and Blaise quickly mount their brooms and join their teams and when Blaise blows the whistle they begin.
"I know you didn't mean it, Mione, it's fine. Why's he been distracted?" He asks and Hermione rolls her eyes.
"I'll try." Harry says and McGonagall sighs but knows that's better than nothing, so she nods once and Harry walks over to Hermione and Ron and sits next to Ron, opposite Hermione.
"I wanted to show you how much you mean to me, and I figured showing you my spot would kinda send that message. And..." He trails off and Draco bites his lip.
"Granger?" Draco asks quietly as he sits on the other end of the sofa. She looks up and smiles slightly.
"What are you doing?" Draco asks, voice muffled and cheeks blushing bright because he's sitting in between Harry's legs, which are pressed against his on either side, and Harry starts rubbing his temples, applying the perfect amount of pressure to ease Draco's headache. Draco melts under Harry's touch. He can feel Harry's magic running out of his fingertips and all through Draco's body.
"I couldn't get too drunk, Draco. I have a quidditch match today. Actually I have a quidditch match in a few hours so I need to get up at some point." He says but he doesn't actually make a move to get up and when Draco buries his head in Harrys neck Harry wishes he never had to get up again.
"Knowing he- Right now, I don't know he loves me, in fact I highly doubt it, so if something was to happen, I feel like it wouldn't hurt as much, cause I wouldn't be losing as much. But- if I was to tell him, and by some miracle he loved me too, then I would have so much more to lose. And I've..." Harry meets McGonagalls gaze again, tears forming in his eyes. "I've lost everything. And it hurts so much, it hurts just being alive, without my parents or Siri-" Harry's words get stuck in his throat and he takes a shaky breath. "I'm so tired of losing everything. So if I have nothing, I have nothing to lose. I can't get hurt again." McGonagall stands up and does something Harry never thought would happen. She walks round the desk and pulls Harry up into a hug.
"Why don't you ask Hermione. She seems to know how I'm feeling more than I do." He mutters before pulling his hand away from Draco and leaving the room.
"Potter?" He asks quietly, almost hoping he doesn't hear him. Harry looks up from his parchment and his eyes meet Draco's and Draco feels those fluttery things in his stomach again.
"We should hang out. Like all of us. Me, Pansy and Draco and you Granger and Weasley." He says and Harry nods.
"No." He answers honestly. Draco nods, he knew that anyway. He knew there was no way Harry got any sleep last night; he can tell by the look on his face.
He can't say any of this out loud, of course, so he just ignores his friends and stares out the window. If he looks careful enough he can make out Malfoys reflection and he can see him watching him and Harry just wants to turn around and - He's not sure what he wants to do but kissing him seems like a good option. He just sighs and turns back to the front of the class as the bell rings. He picks up his bag and leaves the class just in front of Malfoy, and the second he's through the door Seamus appears at his side.
"So how are you and lover boy doing?" Pansy asks as Draco sits down and he blushes involuntarily, watching as Harry walks up to the teachers table. His arse looks great in those jeans and his arm muscles are prominent.
"I really wish that was true." Draco moves his hand onto Harry's neck and runs his thumb over Harry's jaw.
"I know. But I can't." Harry mutters, prodding the mash on his plate with his fork, not feeling hungry. He's found he never really feels hungry anymore and only really eats to stop Hermione from bugging him about eating. Harry forces down a few mouthfuls before going back to the 8th year common room with Seamus and Dean.
"Homework, Harry?" He asks, snapping Harry out of his daydream. He's only been back 3 days and he's already being called out in class. Harry blinks slowly before looking up at Slughorn. Professor Slughorn is looking at him expectantly and Harry can feel the eyes of the class on him too. It seems they've all paused in the middle of packing up to watch the interaction. Harry just shrugs and Slughorn sighs.
"I hope so." He says before looking over at Harry. "What's up?" He asks, noticing the look on Harrys face.
"Not bad, actually." He says and before she can say anything else Harry is running up the stairs towards to dorm. He showers and changes before making his way to the library, deciding to start his research now. He searches the shelves for anything relating to the resurrection stone or the deathly hallows and, after a slightly awkward talk with Madam Pince in which he had to promise he wasn't trying to do anything wrong or against the school rules and was simply interested, he ends up carrying 10 textbooks back to his table in the corner. He starts to skim through them, getting lost in the theory and rules and consequences, and when he finally looks up from the fifth textbook he notices it's pitch black outside and, after a glance around the library, he notices only a few people left. 3 doing last minute work, frantically writing, and 1 fast asleep. Harry debates whether he should sit in the library all night or actually go and sleep, but eventually his exhaustion beats his unwillingness to have another nightmare. He leaves the books in a pile, leaving a note on top that they're being used so Madam Pince doesn't put them away, and makes his way up to his dorm, collapsing in bed and falling asleep immediately.
"Why?" Harry shrugs, his gaze dropping from Malfoys eyes. The more he looks into his eyes the more he realises how bloody beautiful they are and at this point it aches. Draco runs his hand through Harry's hair and Harry meets his gaze again.
"Now if you will please practice a few times on your own, I will be back shortly." She walks to the back of the class, towards Harry, and the class watch her before turning back to their work.
"Draco gave me his essay as I didn't take any notes last lesson." Blaise explains as he sets the essay in between the both of them so they can read it and get an idea of what they're doing today. Harry looks around and notices Draco isn't there.
They walk out of the common room and Harry explains his plan, which Hermione is all for. As they walk they chat casually and when they get near a student or group of students Harry lowers his voice and whispers a random name from their year or the year below or Hermione whispers 'really though? when people find out it's Justin he'll get questioned by everyone.' replacing the name with a different one every time.
Blaise and Draco share a look when Harry shrugs. Draco knows, he thinks, a way to help Harry sleep, and he would never do this in public, but Harry is clearly exhausted and he wants desperately to help him. He hesitates slightly before moving closer and slowly lifting his left hand and running his fingers through Harry's hair. Harry all but melts under his touch and Draco feels his chest flutter, continuing the movement until Harry is breathing evenly. Blaise watches the two of them with wonder and amazement on his face, and Draco glances at him with a frown.
"Yeah, okay. I'll get the ingredients." Harry walks over to the supply closet and starts grabbing what they'll need. He and Blaise are, it seems, the first pair to either state which each potion was or decide which one they want to make because Harry manages to get everything they need and take it over to their table before anyone else stands up.
"So Blaise says you're going back to the Lions den?" Draco says quietly. They're almost done with dinner and they've been having quiet conversations about nothing in particular. Harry nods, pushing his food around his plate. The hall is slowly filling up now, not with many people from his year or seventh year, but there's enough people to make Harry feel awkward.
"The dog constellation. My godfather was named after the brightest star in Canis Major." He says, still with his back to Draco. Draco stares at the Draco constellation and secretly hopes that this one is because of him, although he knows deep down Harry wouldn't get a tattoo for him.
"Why are you talking to him more than you're talking to us?" Ron asks and Harry sighs, putting his book down on the bed in front of him.
"Hey." Ron says awkwardly, and Blaise, Draco and Pansy glance at Harry, who isn't meeting Rons gaze.
Hermione is, of course, the first to realise something's up. They're sat at breakfast, Ron playing with Teddy, when she turns to Harry.
"I will, professor. He er, he spoke about his godfather earlier." Draco says, because he kind of wants help with how to help Harry; He's never lost someone he cared for so he doesn't know how to comfort him.
The common room is now empty, considering its almost 1am, so Harry leaves without interruption and he walks straight out of the castle and to the whomping willow. He stops the tree and climbs in before walking straight to the bedroom he was in earlier. He knows running away from everything isn't going to help but it's easier to do than face up to everything. He collapses on the bed and sighs, hugging a pillow and falling into a nightmare filled dream.
"Anyway, your teachers have told me they are very impressed with your work. They tell me you are quickly becoming the best in your classes. How are you otherwise? I notice you haven't been eating a lot?" McGonagall says and Harry shrugs, sinking back into the chair.
Harry walks up to the common room and looks around, not knowing what to do. Seamus and Dean are sat on the sofa by the fire and when Seamus sees Harry he opens his arms. Harry walks over, drops his bag on the coffee table, and collapses onto the sofa. Seamus shifts so he's lying down and Harry lies next to him, neither of them saying a word. Dean rolls his eyes but lies on the other side of Harry, him and Seamus wrapping Harry up in a hug with him buried in between them.
"Of course darlin'." He whispers before casting a wandless charm to lube up his dick. He lines his dick up and slowly pushes the tip in, stopping when Draco gasps. Harry leans down to kiss Dracos neck, just under his ear.
"What else do you want me to say? We're actually dating now and snog all the time?" Harry asks and Ron scrunches his nose up as if he'd just smelt something rank.
"Missed having you around, you know." He whispers, and Harry throws him an apologetic smile. He knows Blaise worries about him.
"Harry that was so gay." Dean mutters and Harry chuckles and it's small and quiet but it's the first thing thats even close to a laugh that Harry has done in months and Seamus and Dean are so proud that they made that happen that they can't help but laugh with him.
"Okay, find your happiest memory and allow it to fill your body." He says and Draco thinks about when he was around 8 and his dad was away and he and his mother were planting flowers in the manor grounds and his mother made a flower crown and she put it on his head and he was giggling and she tickled him and they were having fun, being free without his father there.
"How'd you get in here?" Harry whispers and Draco almost rolls his eyes because of course that's what Harry is focused on.
"He didn't eat. I don't think I saw him eat at all for the first few months. I would kind of make him eat something here and there but he still wouldn't eat much. He didn't sleep either. Not until he had an argument with the Gryffindors and started sleeping in our dorm room with me." Draco didn't want to leave him for 2 weeks over Christmas all alone. He know's he wont sleep, and Draco doubts Harry will eat much, if anything.
"I love you too, Ron. But I've loved so many people. And it hurts so much. They leave, or they betray you, or they die, and it hurts. And every time it breaks you, and eventually there aren't enough pieces of you left to fix yourself with. I just don't think I can cope if it happens again." Harry says and he doesn't know when he started crying, just that there are tears falling down his cheeks.
"I don't think you understand how much you help me." Harry whispers, and Draco squeezes his hand slightly.
"Congratulations on you and Mr Malfoy. Normally I would disagree with causing a whole school debate and I am definitely against betting, however I have been enjoying it." She says genuinely and Harry smiles and thanks her before leaving the classroom, a grin on his face.
"You were abused too." Harry says softly, suddenly not caring about his aunt and uncle because Draco had it worse.
"Told you you wouldn't keep up." Harry teases, trying to take the attention away from how fucked up he is, and Rhys rolls his eyes.
Secondly, I know it's been a while since I posted a new chapter and I know this is kind of really short but, surprise surprise, I have writers block again. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING!!! I know where I want this fic to go and I know what I want to happen but actually figuring out how to go from A to B is SO DAMN HARD!!! I have the next chapter /mostly/ done but after that I'm like... who fucking knows what's going on after that... :( Also I've been sick again (what else is new) which didn't help
They sit at a round table in the back corner and whilst Harry walks over to the bar to get some drinks Hermione turns to Draco.
"What does that mean? What do I smell like?" Draco asks curiously and Harry gets the feeling he's using the fact that Harry has consumed alcohol to get him to say things he wouldn't when he's completely sober; jokes on Draco though cause Harry would say this any time.
"What do you mean distance yourself emotionally from me?" He asks and Harry bites my lip, he was really hoping Draco wouldn't pick up on that but it's now or never.
"Yeah. Not too sure why but we were walking and then I told him I died and he said he's glad I came back." Harry says briefly and Hagrid smiles.
"Mate can I talk to you real quick?" Harry asks and Ron agrees so they walk to the quad and sit on the wall.
"Elton John, pop legend." Harry says with a small smile. "Wrote some pretty relatable songs, eh?" Draco nods and Harry smiles before he yawns.
Harry spends most of his time over the next 2 weeks either in the library or on the quidditch pitch, when he's not zoned out in a lesson. He only goes to the hall for meals a couple of times a week and he goes on 2 or 3 runs a day. He walks into potions on Friday afternoon and sits in the back corner, next to Seamus, and sighs. He hasn't eaten in two days and he is so tired because he hasn't slept in ages either.
Also thank you for all the love you are giving me on this and my other fics, it means a lot and it makes me feel warm and mushy inside <3
"I think it's more he doesn't trust Draco. But what's important is that you do, and that he trusts you. Being in a relationship with no trust is like being on a rowboat with no oars. You can paddle with your hands but in the end you'll not go anywhere and you'll be exhausted." George says and Harry smiles slightly.
"Tomorrow." Harry can tell Draco doesn't know what to say, but when he places his hand on Harrys and squeezes Harry smiles because he doesn't really want to talk about Teddy leaving and Draco is actually helping.
"She felt sorry for you cause you had a shit life no offence and you were forced to fight from a young age against an evil wizard and you had no choice and you were pretty much forced to sacrifice yourself. When you spoke for us at our trial she saw how much the war affected you, cause lets be honest Harry you looked like shit after the war." Draco says and Harry smiles slightly.
“It wasn’t. They didn’t.” He says, his eyes filling with tears and Draco grabs Harry’s hand with the one that’s not threading through his hair.
"Alright," He says, finishing his drink, "Let's go." Hermione and Draco finish their drinks before standing up and the three of them walk out of the pub, Harry walking next to Draco in case anyone tries anything.
"I'm usually not but apparently I have no say in what happens when you're around. My body goes into autopilot." Draco says, slightly embarrassed, and Harry smiles slightly and tilts his head to the side, as if he's confused.
"You know, I still haven't forgotten the fact that you refused to tell me what I smell like." Harry smirks knowingly and Draco immediately blushes.
"What kind of run in?" She asks concerned and Draco knows the concern is for Harry. He explains what happened and what was said and, when he mentions what Harry said about Hermione, instead of getting upset like Draco thought she would she just smiles.
"Don't need to be in the hospital wing anymore. s'long as I come to meals and stuff." Harry says, frowning slightly, and Draco looks at him for a second.
"I can't help but feel guilty. When I was younger I wasn't given much food, and I had to eat it fast or my cousin would take it. Most of the time I just wouldn't get the chance to eat." Harry says and Michael tries to hide the shocked look on his face.
Okay so I have a question... I was thinking about making this the last chapter, because I kind of love how this ends, but I also want to add a few more chapters of Harry and Draco at Christmas and Harry and his friends making up properly and them meeting Draco as his boyfriend and basically a bunch of cute school days and then maybe an epilogue or when school finishes or something, so... what do you think? Just know whatever you decide will take me a while because I have nothing else written yet.
"You're nervous?" Draco asks as they walk down the long path towards the front door, and Harry nods. He feels a bit sick, and the closer they get the door the worse he feels.
"He was accused of telling Voldemort where my parents were hiding. People thought he was their secret keeper but it wasn't him." Harry says before sighing. "I never thanked you Malfoy. For saving me that night at Malfoy Manor."
"Good job Gryffindor, Slytherin, there's always next time." Harry teases as Gryffindor won 3 out of the 5 games they played.
"Harry is Draco's date. Blaise said he was invited. I hope it's not going to be a problem." She's talking sternly, because Harry is with her son so he is family, and she protects her family.
"I don't know. I'm never fully okay. But sometimes I'm more okay than other times." Harry says, cringing at how bad he is at communication. Talking to Draco is harder than he thought.
"Was that the dinner bell?" Draco asks quietly, not making a move to get up. Harry nods, his head still resting in Draco's lap.
"Oh dear. Well, that does seem like the lesser of two evils." Harry presses a kiss to Draco's neck before lying next to him again, pulling him into a cuddle.
"Nothing really, wanted to know if we had homework." Harry lies easily and Ron nods, not buying it at all.
Draco almost falls asleep too, what with Harry's even breathing being the only thing Draco can hear. Draco isn't running his hand through Harry's hair anymore, instead his arm is resting on Harry's side and he's running his fingers across the parts of Harry's side and back that he can reach whilst still lying comfortably. Harry has been asleep for 4 hours, and Draco may have dozed off for a few minutes but he's spent most of it watching Harry sleep. It's around 5pm now, and even though they both missed lunch Draco isn't that hungry and he knows Harry wont eat anyway so he doesn't bother waking him up. He needs to sleep more than he needs to eat at the moment, and they can deal with the not eating thing later. If he's going to help Harry he's going to have to do it one thing at a time, and right now Draco needs to sort out his lack of sleep. Harry shifts slightly, and his face is suddenly a lot closer to Draco's than he ever thought it would be and their foreheads are practically touching and Draco doesn't know if his heart beats faster or if it stops all together. Draco carefully moves forward so his forehead is pressed against Harry's and closes his eyes, enjoying the feeling of being this close to him.
Harry is still awake. It's nearly 6am now and Harry is still awake. He's still holding Draco's hand and side, and Draco is fast asleep. He's been asleep for half an hour, but Harry can't seem to sleep. He's not scared about nightmares, he's just still thinking about what Draco said. Harry is part of his life. A permanent part or just until school ends? And even if he's going to see him often he wont be able to see him every night, so Harry will still have to miss sleep. There's no possible way Harry can sleep with Draco every night. Nothing he can do to ensure Draco stays with him. Harry studies Draco's features, the sharp jawline, his cheekbones, the way his blonde eyelashes brush his cheeks, the way his lips look so soft. Harry almost can't believe he's lying next to him. For the first 7 years of them knowing each other Draco and Harry were never anything other than enemies, and here they are, at 6am in the shrieking shack, Draco fast asleep and angelic and
"How can I help you, Harry? How can I stop everything?" He asks softly and Harry bites his lip and diverts his gaze from Seamus' eyes to his chest as he shrugs. He isn't sure what he actually needs but he can't stop thinking about Malfoy and the war and the people that died and it drives him mad.
"Ron can we not just be happy that he's actually talking to someone?" Hermione asks quietly as Ron fumes whilst glaring at the back of Blaise and Draco's heads.
Draco opens his eyes again a few minutes later and when he pulls away from Harry he can see a small smile on his face. His breathing is still even so he's definitely asleep, and Draco feels his heart flutter because Harry looks so beautiful when he's sleeping. Harry frowns, and Draco panics slightly that his touches aren't working but thinks maybe Harry is just dreaming, so he carefully moves his hand to Harry's forehead and runs his finger across Harry's forehead and across his temple, following the line of his cheekbone before ghosting over his lips and across his jaw. Harry's face immediately softens, and Draco smiles slightly as he continues softly tracing Harry's features. After a while Harry's breath stops being even and Draco knows he's awake. Harry keeps his eyes shut, just enjoying the feeling of Draco's finger moving softly from his forehead to his temple, and despite knowing he's awake, Draco keeps dragging his finger carefully across his skin.
"I know, but when you love someone you'll do anything to make them feel better. Like sitting in a dorm that isn't theirs and staying there because you're asleep on them and they know you need the sleep, even when your friend walks in and asks why they're there. Or visiting you every day in the hospital wing. Or threatening to curse your best friend because they're threatening someone you love. Or sitting on the rail of a bridge older than this school in the freezing cold." Ron says and Harry rests his head on Rons shoulder.
"Don't apologise. Is there something wrong? You wanna talk about it?" Harry knows he can talk to Draco, and he knows he should, but he feels guilty, piling all his shit onto him.
"I was just wondering if I could ask you about what we did in DADA today." He says, uncharacteristically nice, and Granger looks taken aback for a second before she composes herself.
"Yeah." He says apprehensively. Seamus looks at Harry, watching Draco's hands for a moment, knowing that Draco is probably the one allowing Harry to sleep so soundly. Seamus turns his gaze to Draco, looking at him thoughtfully. He know's Harry is in love with him, which is probably why Draco is helping him sleep, but why would Draco actually willingly sit there running his hands through Harry's hair unless he loved him too. He nods at him before turning back round the corner.
"Not a fan of being stuck here." He mutters just as madam Pomfrey enters the wing holding a glass of something.
"You know, all we'd have to do is tell people we're together and they'd all leave me alone." Draco bites his lip, unsure. "Plus Rhys asked me if I'll go out with him next weekend and I was so tempted to just flat out tell him the truth so he leaves me alone." Harry says, fingers brushing into Draco's hair.
"I think if he sees how happy you and Draco make each other he wont be able to stay mad for long." George says, wrapping his arm around Harry's shoulders and kissing the top of his head.
"So the poll ends at dinner today because young Harry here is finally gonna put you all out of your misery. We stop taking guesses at 5." Seamus calls and a few people get up and walk over, ready to make their guess. Harry rolls his eyes and walks out of the hall with Ron and Hermione.
"Thanks." Ron throws her a grateful smile before making his way up the stairs. He opens the door slowly, trying to stay quiet as he glances round the room. He sees Draco immediately, and walks over to his bed. Ron touches Draco's shoulder slightly and Draco's eyes snap open immediately. He looks at the bed in front of him, as if expecting, or hoping, to see someone there, before his gaze lands on Ron.
"Hey, Harry." Fred says quietly before reaching out and hugging him. "I miss you. Tell George I'm okay and I'm watching over him. Make sure Ron and Ginny are okay. Tell Charlie if he doesn't marry Oliver then I will haunt him." He jokes and Harry nods. He didn't know he would be able to feel them, and upon realising this he squeezes Fred tight before turning to Sirius. He's missed his hugs so much, and when he's pulled into Sirius' chest and feels Sirius' chin on his head he can't help but cry into his chest.
"You're the only one that can do Legilimency here." Harry's lips twitch up in a smile and Draco smiles back. "So are you going to stop arguing and agree to stay with us tonight?" Harry huffs but nods and when Draco grins Harry can't help but smile, leaning forward to kiss him.
"Lie with me?" He asks and Draco blushes dark but lies down next to Harry. They both lie there looking up at the ceiling, Draco's blush a dark contrast against his pale skin, until Harry rolls onto his side so he can look at Draco.
"He didn't say, but I could tell. He didn't say much." Blaise says and Draco sighs but doesn't say anything and Blaise sighs again.
"Mr Potter. What are you doing gallivanting about the corridors at this time?" McGonagall asks, looking between the two boys a few times before her gaze settles on Harry. There's a smugish look on her face that you wouldn't notice unless you've seen it as many times as Harry has, like when she was arguing with Umbridge.
"And now we're more than that." Draco says, trying to remain indifferent but not able to keep the smile off his face.
"Okay, well, I will announce the quidditch captains on Friday at breakfast, and will let everyone know to come to me to sign up for Gryffindor, so you won't have to deal with the people that will use this as an excuse to talk to you and ask questions." She says and Harry smiles.
Also there's a very high chance I'll post twice this week cause on Thursday it's gonna be quite quiet at work :)
"I do, just not when you're leading me into a death trap." Draco whispers back and Harry rolls his eyes. He gets his wand out and casts a spell at the knot in the roots, freezing the branches. He pulls Draco towards the almost invisible hole in the roots and whispers "trust me" as he pulls them both through the hole just as the tree springs back to life.
"See you at lunch." He says and with a final squeeze of Harry's shoulder he walks back down the hallway to the classroom. As he enters the class turn to look at him, Ron looking pissed off, but Hermione looks gratefully at him. It doesn't seem like Binns even noticed that two of his students had left the room, and when Blaise sits back down Draco turns to him.
"I'm gonna tell him." He says as he turns back to Hermione and her eyes light up. She's been gushing about how cute the two of them are ever since they sat down for dinner.
"I knew it!" Seamus grins before stopping and looking thoughtful, watching Draco as he stands talking to Pansy.
”No one gonna say I look good?” Blaise asks. Pansy, it seems, couldn’t do anything with Blaise’s hair, considering he has an undercut with the hair on top not being very long, so she settled for putting pulling it into the smallest ponytail and clipping it with a black bow.
They continue the conversation as they enter the hall and sit down and as they talk Hermione notices Harry is so distracted by talking about Draco that he doesn't even realise he's eating dinner. Hermione's smile grows wider after this realisation and Harry looks at her confused.
"I will. And I get it if you can't talk to us or look at us, but we miss you, Harry. And we went the wrong way about it but we miss you. And I get you're friends with the Slytherins now but can we arrange joint custody or something cause we miss having you around." Harry smiles slightly, wiping his eyes, and Ron smiles.
"Maybe you've lost your touch." Harry jokes quietly and Draco rolls his eyes and reaches his left hand up to run through Harry's hair.
The room is empty when they enter it and Draco leads Harry over to his bed, carefully sitting him down.
"Hi." His voice sounds raspy as he hasn't spoken in who knows how long, so he clears his throat and continues. "Sorry I didn't write much." He only wrote back so they knew he was alive.
Okay so I hadn't realised it had been quite this long since I last updated like I honestly thought I'd posted less than a week ago so I'm sorry it took so long <3
"Hi, Harry." A first year boy says with a bright smile as Harry leads Draco over to the sofa by the fire.
"Well you're not wrong, you definitely did. It's a shame you'll never know." Harry chuckles before looking over at Draco and catching his eye before motioning for Draco to come over. When Draco reaches the two boys Harry places his hand on the small of Dracos back as there's no one around.
Harry manages to finish his potions essay after an hour and takes a deep breath, running his hands through his hair, before standing up and grabbing the book. He know's Blaise is still in the library because from where Harry is he would have seen and heard him leave, so he figures he should give him the book so he can use it. Harry walks round a corner to where he knows Blaise usually sits and freezes slightly when he sees Blaise is sat with Malfoy. They both look up when they hear Harry's steps and Blaise smiles slightly.
"You two are disgusting." She says smiling fondly and Harry grins when Draco blushes, probably just realising that they aren't alone. He sighs and sits up properly, rolling his eyes when Harry throws his legs across his lap the second he's upright, and smiling nervously at Hermione and Ron.
"What's got you so happy?" Ron asks when Harry sits down on the coffee table in front of them all, his legs crossed.
Throughout the lesson Seamus keeps leaning into Harry and whispering names to see how he reacts, but he just shakes his head and whispers 'after class'. The second the lesson ends Seamus grins and grabs Harrys arm, pulling him out of the greenhouse and round a corner where no one is.
"Harry where were you? I was worried!" Hermione asks and Harry shrugs, not in the mood for her mothering. "Around." Harry says simply before walking up to his dorm without looking back.
“I don’t wanna think about it.” He chokes and Draco pulls him into a hug, resting his chin on Harry’s head.
"I need to ask Professor Flitwick a question. I'll see you at dinner Harry. Bye Malfoy." She says, looking at Malfoy and nodding towards Harry, making sure he get's what she means, before grabbing her stuff and leaving.
He misses dinner and he knows Hermione and Ron are going to complain but Harry doesn't care. He runs until every thought of the people he lost and the people that gave their lives are out of his head and all he can think about is the autumn breeze blowing through his hair and the fact that his legs are feeling numb and his chest is tight and he knows he should stop running soon but he's been running around the castle and to the quidditch pitch and through the forest and along the lake for nearly 3 hours and it's only 9pm and Harry doesn't know what he'd do when he stops running and has to go back to the castle. He thinks as he runs of what he could do to keep the thoughts away, and considers Seamus for a second before realising his legs are literally numb and he's exhausted so that might not be ideal. Harry settles on sketching when he looks up at the sky as he runs and sees the moon that reminds him of Malfoys eyes, feeling the urge to draw him.
They're met halfway between the quidditch pitch and the forest, and Harry isn't expecting Hermione to cry when she sees him. He really isn't expecting Ron to breathe a sigh of relief and pull him into a hug. Ron hates hugs.
"I dunno, since like fourth year." He says and Draco blushes again. Harrys cocky smirk reappears and Draco knows he's fucked.
"Your happy memory isn't strong enough." Potter says softly, looking at the side of Draco's face. Draco shrugs, sitting back down.
"Was that an invitation, Harry?" Seamus smirks, leaning close to harry, and Harry sees Draco out of the corner of his eye looking nervous, as if he thinks Harry's being serious. Harry leans forward as if he's about to kiss Seamus but stops with a few inches between them.
"Well I can tell you to fuck off if it makes you feel better." Harry jokes and Draco rolls his eyes and shoves Harry's shoulder. Harry grabs the hand that shoved him and holds it in his lap.
"Fuck, Harry. How- how do- you- do this?" Rhys pants and he's slowing down and Harry slows down with him.
"Oh... Why?" She frowns and Ron realises that someone who has publicly hated Draco for years coming to find him in the middle of the night looks a bit suspicious.
"Thank you for looking after Teddy. I knew we could count on you." Harry nods before turning to his parents. He hasn't felt a hug from them since he was a baby, and he doesn't remember what it feels like, so when they both circle their arms around him and pull him into a hug his last remaining defences crumble and instead of the quiet tears he starts sobbing.
"Harry, son, you're only saying that cause you're in love with one of them." James says and Harry blushes.
"Yeah, damn I'm gonna have to listen to bloody Jason complain about me being late again." Harry mutters as he shoves on his quidditch boots before standing up and looking at Draco. "You coming?" Draco nods, getting off the bed and accepting Harry's hand before Harry leads them out of the dorm and towards the quidditch pitch. Ron doesn't mention how natural it was for them to hold hands.
"My aunt was your godfathers cousin?" He asks and Harry nods. Draco knew very little about his family too, apparently.
Harry wanders around the grounds until 1pm when he walks to the great hall for lunch. He didn't care how he looked after quidditch so he's wearing joggers and a slightly too big plain black hoodie that he borrowed from Fred last christmas and never gave back. Now he just keeps it because he misses him and feels like his death was his fault. He notices Malfoy watching him slowly as he walks over to the Gryffindor table and sighs as he sits in between Ron and Dean.
"Mister Potter does not need a wand to perform magic, I'm sure he only raised his wand to let the other Gryffindors know he would stick up for you. He is a powerful wizard. He can perform wandless and silent magic with ease. Which is why he is able to use Legilimency." McGonagall says and Blaise frowns.
"Draco. I love you." Harry says, more nervous than Draco has ever seen him, and Draco can feel a glow spread from his heart throughout his body and it's blinding because hearing Harry say he loves him is the best feeling in the world.
"Hey," Harry calls, trying not to scare her as he walks towards the third year, who looks at Harry with wide shocked eyes.
"Wow." He breathes, and he didn't mean to say that out loud but Draco blushes and Harry thinks he looks so damn fucking beautiful. He's wearing black trousers and a black shirt, but his jacket is dark green velvet and he looks absolutely incredible. "I mean-" Harry cuts himself off before shaking his head. "No that's right actually." He smiles slightly and Draco blushes darker.
"I'm not going to dignify that with an answer." Draco says, turning away from Harry, who grins and leans in close to Draco.
"Me neither." He breathes and Draco watches him closely, the way his eyelashes brush his cheeks and how his hair falls when Draco's fingers run through it. Harry is asleep within a minute, and when his breathing becomes deeper Draco watches him, memorising his face, every feature, just because he can.
"I think Harry said something to them all, but like, in their heads, because they sort of just, left." Draco says.
"He's been gone for 11 hours. Yeah he disappears sometimes but he's always back in the dorm at night." He snaps before looking at Hermione, who is biting her lip nervously.
