-And what about me?-Hermione asked,-You could have told me then,-Harry stuttered. He could have. But he didn’t. Why?-I am still your friend, you know? Not just Ron’s girlfriend,-she said and there was too much pain and unspoken resentment in her voice.
-Mr. Potter approached me yesterday, saying he wants to testify for you. I couldn’t say no to him,-Draco looked at the door as it opened. Harry quickly walked in and stopped beside Draco. He was looking right into Kingsley’s eyes, with ambition and determination in his eyes.
-Neither do I! So? You’re in?-it was the most insane thing Draco could do. He wasn’t even planning to go to that Ball, and now he actually considered showing up hand in hand with Harry damn Potter.
-Hey,-Harry replied but felt a strong urge to leave. These two had a lot to discuss – which they started already – and Harry didn’t want to disturb. He stayed though. And even during their conversation with Draco, Pansy kept throwing glances at Harry. Ones he couldn’t really understand.
Harry didn’t know how to feel. He looked around and saw people he used to study and live with. Ron, Neville, Hermione, Dean. Saw faces of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs he knew, but not really. They looked at him and at McGonagall with a fair share of skepticism and curiosity. And Harry saw only two Slytherin students who decided to come back. Draco, who actually didn’t get to make this decision and whose face remained indifferent and emotionless; and Zabini. Blaise looked around with unfriendly and cold smirk, showing that if there’s anyone Harry should be looking out for, it’s him.
-Very noble of you, Harry,-Kingsley said. Harry didn’t say anything, but Draco was sure he shook his head,-Did you mean what you said? You can tell me now, it won’t affect Malfoy.
Harry couldn’t help but notice that Malfoy took way more time that both Hermione and Ron. For at least 40 minutes Potter walked around, starred at the door, made small talk with some other students, until he heard a loud squeak and Draco walked out of the office with an unreadable expression, putting the brochure into his bag. Unfortunately, Harry didn’t catch a single word on it, which teased his curiosity even more.
-Very well, Shrong,-the elf breathed very loudly and his posture was very far from straight. If all the elves here are as old as him, Harry wondered how they get anything done. And that’s when he had an idea.
-I…I’m gonna check on Hermione…in the library,-Ron mumbled and took off. Harry saw him out with eyes filled with jealousy.
-Okay, where did that come from?-Hermione asked, pointing at the table. The whole 8th year class gathered in their common room, accompanied by a few friends; Luna Lovegood, Ginny Weasley, Astoria Greengrass and some other younger Slytherin girls Blaise invited. Blaise himself was behind the table, chuckling at Hermione’s question. He looked at her with a sly smirk and started opening many bottles of firewhiskey standing on that table.
-I’ve been looking for you for an hour now, asshole!-Pansy said once Draco put her down. She wore a short black dress that matched her dark lipstick. Together with Malfoy they looked pretty harmonious.
-I…well, it’s nothing,-Hermione looked at him,-Okay, did you notice that Malfoy is never in the castle on the weekends?
-We are going in circles here, Malfoy,-Harry said. He wasn’t going to drop this. Draco was only about to find out that Potter’s stubbornness doesn’t know any limit.
Harry knew loneliness first hand. Maybe Draco’s parents weren’t dead, but they couldn’t be with him now when he needed them. And unlike Potter he never had a big loud happy family of a friend to give him a home when he needed it. Never had friends that would give up on anything for him and follow him till the very end. And seeing that, Harry, who had spent most of his life assured in his own absolute loneliness, now knew how wrong he was.
-Where do you stay for the night usually?-Harry asked. They walked towards the Diagon Alley, taking their time.
-I wanted to ask you,-Hermione said to Harry. They were watching their Quidditch team training for the next match. Ron gave them a week of vacation, but now made them work harder than ever before.
-Pretty, huh?-Pansy asked. She couldn’t stop smiling,-Sometimes mermaids come. That used to be a real show.
-To keep my food fresh?-he smiled,-I don’t know, I got used to it in Dursley’s and decided to get one for myself too.
-Madam Polkinghorne ,-he started,-I have a house elf myself. Inherited him with the house. I don’t really need him, and I think he could use some company too. Maybe he could come in handy here?-Analise’s eyes lit up.
-Forget it,-Draco cut him off,-I’m not actually mad at you for what you did when you were 12,-Draco chuckled,-Everything was very different back then.
-If who doesn’t show up?-the three of them heard a voice behind them. Harry immediately turned around to see Malfoy in an all-black suit, hands in his pockets, a smirk playing on his lips. Ron wouldn’t admit it, but he definitely regretted not buying a suit like his. And Harry had to make a physical effort not to let his jaw drop.
-Of course. What else do you plan to do after graduation?-her smile was so open and pure that for a second Draco thought that she actually had no idea what he was talking about. Or that his worries really didn’t have any ground.
-Wow,-Ron gasped as Hermione returned from the dorm. She wore a blue dress. It reminded Ron and Harry of their previous Ball, but was classier and more elegant. High heels and slight touch of make up made Hermione look not just like a pretty girl, but like a gorgeous young woman she was. Ron blushed so desperately as he saw her that his awkward attempts to compliment her weren’t necessary. She saw all he wanted to say in his eyes.
But that didn’t mean Draco would welcome Potter into his almost non-existent inner circle with open arms. If Harry didn’t know any better, he’d assume Malfoy was onto something again, that’s how suspiciously quiet he was, and every time these thoughts kept coming back, Harry had to wake himself up, remind himself that the time when he could easily be betrayed by anyone and no one could be trusted was gone. Sometimes it was hard to realize and keep in mind that he was safe. Sometimes even a simple headache from studying too long gave him huge panic attacks; Harry couldn’t tell if it was the scar that ached or not.
-So, Harry, what’s new? I heard you didn’t make it to the Quidditch team,-she said, ready to comfort Potter. He just shrugged.
For some unknown to him reason Harry expected to see Draco crying. He assumed it was a bad news type of letter, maybe even from Azkaban. But his eyes were neither red nor teary. Malfoy looked…lost. Disoriented
Choosing uniform was a whole issue for the team. The players obviously had to look different from the others and their old uniforms didn’t serve that purpose anymore. Ron did his best to arrange a proper meeting and discuss what kind of uniform everyone wanted. Most of them just shrugged and said “whatever you want”. Draco didn’t even show up on the meeting. One of the few girls on the team offered to make a compromise and combine all 4 main colors of Hogwarts houses in the design, using black as the base. Ron didn’t come up with anything better. He tried to please everyone, and in the end, they all hated the result.
-Do you miss him?-Harry asked probably the stupidest question in his head, but he didn’t know any other way to get Draco to keep talking about his father. He finished fixing up his eye, hid the tube in his pocket and sat down to the opposite bed.
-I think you will agree with me when I say that you are one of the brightest representatives of your Hogwarts House. You have always had enough ambitions, your leadership skills are very high, you are obviously very cunning and resourceful young man,-Draco wasn’t sure where she was going with this,-If I’m not mistaken, it took the sorting hat less than a second to put you into Slytherin. Right?
-Not much of a choice, mate,-Ron smirked,-Malfoy or Zabini. I recommend the second one,-even despite the evil stare he received from Blaise earlier, Harry agreed. He thought and hoped it would be easier with Zabini. Until he saw him walking out of another dorm, without his bag.
-It does! And I’m just trying to understand, okay? Why such sudden change of heart?-Harry didn’t reply. Even if this question was asked in more appealing circumstances, Harry still probably wouldn’t have an answer.
Eventually, some lady approached Draco, gave him his wand and asked if he needed help. Draco said no and finally got to his feet. He walked out of the court room with a weird feeling that his body wasn’t even his, and the reality he was in right now, wasn’t the real one. He saw Harry talking to Kingsley, and before he could tell himself not to, he hid around the corner where he could hear every word they said.
-Why?-he started going through his memories of the second year and scoffed when he realized the reason 12 year old Potter had,-You thought I opened the Chamber of secrets,-Draco made a step away from Harry.
Malfoy marched to another wing of the castle looking around himself. Slowly but firmly the school started falling into the madness familiar to everyone who had studied here during the Triwizard Tournament. The preparations for the Ball. Students were hysterically looking for partners, deciding on the outfits, dedicating most of their days to that one night that was still months away. Draco wasn’t even going to go. The only person he could’ve invited even just as a friend had better things to do than go back to Hogwarts that year and Draco respected her decision. He thought that maybe he’d chime in for a second if he gets too bored, but mostly, the ball didn’t attract him at all.
-Look!-Ron pointed him at the mirror,-It’s the one! You should get it!-Harry almost didn’t recognize himself in the mirror. Though it wasn’t a complete look – he probably will have to do something with his hair – even now, he looked so different. In a good way. Not like a shy confused kid who never knew where he actually belonged and wore hand-me-down clothes that never fit. He looked mature, organized, confident. But at the same time, the tux didn’t destroy Harry’s personality – he still looked like himself. He smiled. It was the one.
-I’m sure. It’s not news for Hermione,-she looked at Ron with a weak smile, while concern grew on his face,-I wanted to tell you for a while…
-Look at yourself!-Draco said through a smile,-Just…breathtaking,-she smiled. Her dress seemed to have been made of pure diamonds, as it sparkled and reflected the light from all the chandeliers and candles.
-She says so,-Ron sighed,-She is all alone now; Dad is basically living at work. I hate how lonely she must be,-Hermione kept stroking his arm, as no words could really comfort Ron now. Molly went through something unimaginable; her biggest fear coming true. And now she had to live with it, thinking about it, thinking about him all day, all alone.
-Of course! Thank you, thank you so much,-Harry hugged Molly, closing his eyes. He imagined Lucy’s face when she meets Molly for the first time. God, she will love her so much. And though he kept himself from doing it for weeks while practicing this conversation with Molly in his head, Harry imagined Draco’s face when he tells him that he had found a home for Lucy. Those two pictures didn’t let Harry sleep at night, he couldn’t wait to start actually doing something about it, he didn’t want Lucy to spend another day in that place. Once again, Harry Potter made a huge mistake of letting his expectations go way too high, but this time he thought they could actually match the reality.
Someone, probably Dean Thomas, offered to dedicate the rest of the day to celebrating the victory. No one complained. Team members walked to the common room as if they owned the castle. And Draco was getting so much positive attention, that he started doubting the realness of what was happening. Even Ginny Weasley gave him a pat on the shoulder and a “Not bad, Malfoy” as she walked by. Many others did too. Draco will never admit how much it meant to him.
-That’s not beating up, Potter,-Draco scoffed and got into his bed, marking an end of this conversation. Harry stood there for another second, just trying to process what just happened, and laid down too. Sleep hadn’t come relatively soon to either of them
-Thanks,-Harry replied and wanted to compliment her back, but Ginny already wasn’t listening. Her attention was completely occupied by Luna. Her eyes sparkled, she smiled very differently. Harry couldn’t help but think that he had never seen her like this back when they were together. And through he was very happy for Ginny and didn’t want anything romantic with her, he still felt some weird kind of jealousy when he looked at them.
-Who?-Harry scrolled through a list of all the girls he knew in his mind. It was surprisingly short,-Ginny, of course.
-Do you still like me? Do you still want…this?-Ginny asked. Her straight-forwardness amazed and terrified Harry at the same time. He could never just come up to a person and ask if they like him.
-No time! 15 minutes till the portal closes! Let’s go!-Draco fought for another minute, at least trying to buy himself some time until Harry returns. But he didn’t, and Draco had no choice but to follow Filch. On his way out he tried calling for Ron or Hermione, to warn them, to ask them to warn Harry too, but they didn’t hear him. Draco couldn’t believe he had to leave like that. Just for the holidays, but still.
-Yes, but…I want to,-Ron said, blushing so hard that his freckles disappeared,-I want it to be sweet and romantic and all.
-Oh, God,-Draco entered the Great Hall, hiding his face. His hair, now longer than ever, was combed in a way to cover the left part of his face, Draco was looking down and didn’t notice Harry who basically ran into him.
-Mister Malfoy, please take a seat. How are you feeling?-Draco mumbled something remotely similar to “fine” and sat down. McGonagall opened a new binder that was in front of her. Relatively smaller than Harry’s.
Harry and Draco would be glad to stay downstairs for longer and talk – and Draco still hoped for that tour – but it was too late and they were too tired. Harry gave Draco one of the other bedrooms on the second floor - Potter himself was only two doors away - handed him a change of clothes and with clean conscience went to sleep. He fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow, that’s how tired he was. Draco felt just as exhausted, but sleep didn’t come to him for a while. He laid sleepless for hours, thinking about things he normally wouldn’t allow himself to think about, going back to the memories he normally wouldn’t even have. And he did all that in Potter’s clothes; trousers were a little too short and only reached the middle of his ankles, but an oversized black t-shirt (muggle, but weirdly soft), felt like a hug. And maybe it was an illusion of sleep-deprived brain, but Draco could have sworn it kind of smelled like Potter.
-I wanted to talk to you,-she said once Harry finally sat down,-Alone, but this was the closest I could get,-she threw a venomous glance at Draco, who remained absolutely uninterested in what was going on.
-Sure,-Harry didn't feel as confident as he looked. When Draco approached him right before he was about to leave that lake, his heart started dancing like crazy inside his chest and still hadn't gone back to normal.
-Mister Malfoy!-he heard a loud voice behind himself and saw Filch running towards him. Draco sighed,-Mister Malfoy!-poor old man was out of breath and carrying around his old fat cat didn’t help much too.
-Hey,-Harry landed right next to him, ignoring a bunch of available seats around them. Before Draco could react, he started filling his plate with food, as if claiming the seat his own.
-No, it doesn’t hurt, let go off me!-Harry just noticed he was still holding his arm. And didn’t let go,-Potter, piss of, I’m not in a mood!
Draco sighed and closed his eyes. It all felt like a dream. One that started as a nightmare and ended as the happiest dream in his life. He just couldn’t believe it. Couldn’t believe that he was free, free to live on, free to have a future, free to do whatever he wants with his life. He hid his face in his hands and tried to normalize his breath. Draco heard Kingsley saying something. Congratulations, something about Hogwarts, something about his parents. Draco hardly heard him. He finally looked up and saw Harry walking away and thought that he should thank him. He wanted to thank him. But his legs just wouldn’t work and his chest felt so free without this huge stone of guilt and fear.
-He’s going with me,-Draco said confidently to Hazel,-We agreed not to tell anyone now, but you deserve to know the truth. Right?-Draco looked at Harry.
-No, really. He’s not very young too, but…help is help, right?-she nodded. Tears were shining in her eyes,-Kreacher? I need you,-Harry said and a second later Harry’s old pal appeared in front of them.
“Keep it between us”. What? What did Draco not want people to know? What did he want to hide from Harry? Why? Was Harry the only one who actually considered them friends? Yes, Draco started opening up to him, he did it slowly, but Harry had to respect his pace. But was it different with Luna? How come he’s already “Draco” to her, while Harry is still “Potter” to him? Has he been secretly dating her this whole time? And is this why he didn’t want to accept Harry’s friendship, because he already had a loved one in his life and didn’t need or want him?
-So were you when you killed Voldemort,-even after his death, that name caused anxious whispers to fly over the room,-Given the circumstances, Mr. Malfoy has to be judges as an adult. Especially since he is about to turn 17.
-Tell him I got nervous and had to throw up. And don’t let Professor Hooch just hand me this position,-Harry said and ran towards the castle. He didn’t turn around once, too afraid to see Ron’s disappointed eyes on him.
-I know,-Harry took his hand and shook it,-Me too,- Their eyes finally found each other. Green curious eyes and cold grey ones. Harry never had a chance to see Draco and look into his eyes this close, but now he saw so much. Way more than Malfoy could ever express with words.
-Who were you talking to?-Harry asked, carefully approaching him. Draco was so obviously holding back tears that Harry’s conscious was eating him up alive for even being there.
-Thank you,-Harry said and saw a short gray-skinned man walking out of the kitchen. It was one of the house-elves and when Draco said they were “old”, it was a compliment. He was…ancient. With a groan he bowed to everyone present and looked up at Madam Polkinghorne with his light gray eyes.
It just…It didn’t really make him feel any better when his friends didn’t notice him if he left the table earlier, for example. Or stopped waiting for him to get to the class together. Harry understood it all. Love, what can they do? They stopped noticing everyone and everything except for each other, and had every right to. There was no reason to look after each other now, everyone was safe, and if one of them gets late for the class, it’s because they slept in, not because they were kidnapped.
Draco was standing in a dark kitchen, with no light at all, not even from his wand, when he heard noise from downstairs. Harry Potter, the savior of the Wizarding Britain, the legend, the boy who lived, showed up lighting his way with his wand in one hand and a hanger in another.
-If you don’t come out now, they will have to delay the match!-Harry yelled through the closed door and smiled at people who looked back at him,-Draco!
-Maybe,-Harry said, leaning back in his chair,-But you just called me adorable,-Harry didn’t manage to hold in a small smirk.
-And you have absolutely nothing to do with it,-Draco had goosebumps as a familiar deep voice flew across the room. He looked up and saw Albus Dumbledore, not exactly in the flesh, smiling to him from his portrait,-I apologize for the interruption, Minerva,-he said. McGonagall just smiled sadly,-And you, Mister Malfoy, need to stop taking blame away from Voldemort. If there’s anyone responsible for the horrors of past couple years, it’s him. And definitely not you.
-Fine,-she sighed,-Grab the brooms, I’ll throw the snitch,-more than a half of the crowd was already gone. Harry, still afraid to meet eyes with Ron, just grabbed two relatively same school broomsticks, threw one to Draco and waited.
-Who else would it be?-Draco asked,-And what you were going to do with that?-he pointed at the hanger and laughed.
-Yeah. We’ll apparate?-Draco nodded, but it was clear that it was Malfoy who had to apparate them both. Harry had no idea where they were going and how to get there.
After two hours players were basically falling down from the broomsticks. The audience, too, lost a fair share of its enthusiasm and now just wanted the game to be over. But the score was 80 : 40, and Ron was very, very unsatisfied by that.
-Anyway, I’m not interested. I’ll try to get the Seeker, but nothing more,-Harry replied, pouring himself another cup of juice and putting it as far away from Ron as possible.
-I wasn’t accusing you of anything like this!-Draco finally left his school supplies alone and looked at Harry.
-Thank you, guys,-Harry decided to keep his thoughts to himself and smiled to his friends. They smiled back to him and everything seemed settled. Except…,-There’s something else I need to say though.
-I didn’t let him win, I’ve told you already,-Harry said,-It was a fair game,-friends were already approaching the common room. Harry mumbled the new password “Amaryllis” and the door opened.
-No,-the girl said,-Ginny has a date,-Harry wasn’t really surprised by that, but still felt a small shot of something remotely similar to jealousy
It wouldn’t be fair to say that nothing had changed in Hogwarts and that war hadn’t left any consequences. Everyone tried to act as if it hadn’t, for themselves or for others, who knows. Especially professors and the Headmistress. They kept talking about friendship among houses, about love and harmony, and sometimes it couldn’t help but annoy. Of course, no one wanted to forget everything that happened or those who gave their lives to this war, but still, it was naïve to expect students to sustain that harmony McGonagall wanted so bad.
-Draco, wait,-Harry finally found courage to talk to him, as they were about to enter the common room.
-Thank you. You know, I heard today was a special day,-she said. Draco smiled and nodded. Of course it was,-It’s a day of true love!
-You see, even Malfoy understands how important it is to…,-Hermione started, but Ron shook his head cutting her off.
-I couldn’t read it. I just saw that you had one,-Draco shrugged, relieved. They were already approaching the common room,-Come on, just tell me!-Harry kept asking. Draco just liked annoying him.
-Because I am your friend, not him! You’ve been acting weird since the beginning of the year! First Quidditch, now this!-Harry slightly blushed.
-When are you planning to tell Ron about Malfoy?-Harry sighed,-You know that technically you are making me lie to him too?
-She’s spectacular,-Draco answered putting so much pain, rage and childish, fake hatred to his mother into his words. Tears started shining in his eyes again,-Living her best life with her friends in France.
-No, no, I swear I didn’t. All you, Malfoy,-he smiled. Draco took a deep breath and chuckled,-Congratulations, Mister Seeker,-Harry got up, offered Draco his hand to get up too. Malfoy looked at it for a second, took it and got on his feet. The crowd around them was booing disappointedly. If either Harry or Draco cared enough to look around, they’d see how they were the only people on the field happy with the way these tryouts ended.
-Finally!-Ron exclaimed when he paid for his tux and was free to go back to school. Already relaxed but still very tired he opened the door and almost left the store when…,-Wait!-he shut the door right before Harry’s nose,-What are you wearing?
-She’s too bloody spoiled!- Madam Polkinghorne said, making sure Lucy heard her,-She is a complete nightmare on the weekdays.
-Paying an awful lot of attention to Malfoy, I see,-Ron said to her. Hermione smiled and knocked Weasley’s shoulder with hers,-Go follow him already, you were going to do it anyway,-he told Harry.
-I think I was nine. Maybe ten,-Draco started, trying the pizza. It wasn’t…bad. It was actually pretty okay, but Malfoy wouldn’t admit it,-We came to visit my grandparents. I don’t remember much.
-Great,-Ron didn’t want to tell much in Malfoy’s presence and it was visible,-You’re next, Harry. Want me to wait for you?
-No, there are also her daughters and a few friends. And some house elves working at the kitchen and cleaning the place. But they are so old that they aren’t much help. Other than that, volunteers,-Draco explained.
-Sure. Whatever you’ll get,-Harry nodded and walked towards the alcohol-free table. Draco watched him with a smile. He was more than happy with the way the night was going. Until…
-Nothing…I gotta go,-he stormed off, heading for the stairs. Harry watched him go and then looked at Ron and Hermione.
-What are you even talking about?-Harry wanted to cover his ears just not to hear the nonsense out of Weasley’s mouth. But he also blushed so desperately that he could no longer use the weather as an excuse.
-What exactly?-Harry asked. The train was about to come, they had couple minutes to spend together before their last goodbye.
-I’m not asking. You’re doing it,-she put her hands on his shoulders. Draco was about to resist, but Pansy shook her head and repeated,-You are doing it. Go.
-Listen,-Harry said because he risked losing his mind if he didn’t,-About the Polyjuice and everything..,
-Trust me, I remember that very well. And I would like to remind you that it is not Lucius Malfoy sitting before you.
Harry pretended to be asleep when Draco walked into the dorm. He knew that even if he tried to get anything out of him, he’d fail. So, Potter had one option. Wait till the morning and ask Luna. She rarely lied.
-How dare you speak my name, filthy mudblood!-she exclaimed right away and looked at Draco,-Hm…introduce yourself, young man!-she ordered.
-You’re not even trying to understand,-Draco said to her, downhearted. Harry knew this conversation wasn’t meant for his ears, but he couldn’t just chime in now! And leaving after making all of this way was stupid too.
-This is stupid,-he mumbled, passing through the door and as his name finally filled the table, knight applauded. Draco would have already regretted coming back to Hogwarts, if he actually was here on the free will. Instead, he just left his things on the only free bed and dashed out of the common room. Harry saw him out and noticed that even after the midnight, when everyone was done discussing new rules and circumstances they were supposed to live in, and finally went to bed, Malfoy’s bed still remained empty.
-What happened?-Ron asked again. And Harry wished there was someone else to answer that question because even Potter himself wasn’t sure.
-I have to go,-Draco mumbled and Harry heard approaching steps. He looked around and saw an absolutely empty hall that literally welcomed him to use it as an escape plan. But Harry decided not to. With a heart beating way too fast, he waited for what was to come. Draco opened the door and looked right at Potter. His face was red, so were his eyes. He starred ahead of himself with pure rage mixed with sadness. So much sadness.
Harry felt…refreshed. Hopeful. Optimistic. His breath was quick and short, as if he just ran a mile, Harry was desperate to tell someone about his conversation with McGonagall. But instead, he approached Ron, showed his Aurors’ brochure and smiled to him.
-Are we accusing Draco of not stopping Lucius Malfoy, one of Voldemort’s closest and most powerful allies?-Harry was getting mad,-He is not his father,-Harry added in a much calmer voice and Draco looked up at him again. Potter never took a seat that was offered to him before, and was standing tall beside Draco,-And accusing him of his father’s crimes is not fair.
-Yeah,-Draco looked at him. He knew exactly what Harry was talking about,-Hope you’re right. And…Thank you. For going with me and all.
Anyway, hope you enjoyed, I won't promise to post soon, but I'll definitely try to and thank you so much for reading! Also thank you for your kind words under previous chapters! Nothing motivates me to write more than your comments.
-In your dreams, Potter,-they cheered, and this time even Draco couldn’t hold back a smile. Harry started laughing and Draco almost did too, but he accidentally looked into the window and froze.
-Wait a second,-Ron came back with another dark-blue suit, but this time it looked a little more luxurious. And costed more.
-To be fair, I didn’t really have a say in the matter,-both Harry and Draco laughed,-Seriously though, you need to find a date for that Ball as soon as possible. In a few seconds the whole school will think you are actually going with me,-Draco said, writing something down. Harry nodded, but then an idea struck him.
-No, actually…,-Draco looked around too, trying to find his date. Harry approached them. It took Pansy a second to understand.
Kingsley looked at him with weird compassion, creating a very false illusion that he was on Draco’s side. Or maybe his new raise to Minister of Magic still blew his mind enough to care about other people. Yet, when the trial started, all Draco’s hopes faded away. He was looking at 20 years in Azkaban. More than enough to drive a person crazy, more than enough to kill. Draco listened to Kingsley’s speech as he listed everything Draco was accused for. Malfoy had pretty much nothing to defend himself with. His father had already given out all the names of Death Eaters Ministry would want to know. It didn’t help him. It could have helped Draco though.
-Of course!-Hermione supported him. Harry nodded and tried to smile, but he knew that if Draco really doesn’t show up, Potter will go back to the dorm and leave the love birds alone.
Draco really was weirdly unenergetic during the first hour of the game. Harry always kept an eye on him, and sometimes he wanted to yell : “WHY THE HELL ARE YOU JUST HANGING THERE?”
-Ready to begin?-Potter nodded. McGonagall opened a rather thick binder full of Harry’s grades, academic and not achievements, professor’s comments and recommendations on him. She slowly turned pages, looking up on Harry from time to time, as if waiting for him to say something.
-You are a horrible liar, Potter,-Draco said, smiling too. His cheeks were slightly pink, while Harry’s face was bright red.
-See you soon,-Harry smiled. His cheeks blushed, his lips were brighter and more red than usual, his hair was even messier, if that's possible. But he looked so happy. So did Draco.
-Last week we stayed at Luna’s house. It was…weird. Usually they either give me the room at the orphanage or I go back to school,-he said.
She laughs at her brother as he does his own little dance around the family room, Cassiopeia joining in. Things were looking up for them finally.
“Well, I remember Luna telling me a long time ago and it’s not that hard really,” Draco responds, with a smug look on his face.
It’s so sincere that I don’t know how Hagrid doesn’t burst into tears. The other Slytherins pretend to gag at the moment but I just sit in my seat in silence. These heartfelt moments were unknown to us so we laughed at it. Thought it was a weakness. Whatever our parents disapproved of was not allowed: muggleborn friends, hugs, touching, even smiling for stricter families like mine. Showing emotions, like love, was prohibited. I wondered sometimes what it would have been like to grow up in a loving family or at least have someone in my life like Potter had Hagrid and Granger and the Weasley’s. It hurt to think of what could have been.
I have never been the main concern of our parents before. Of course, they wanted me to behave and get good grades but if I chatted with a Hufflepuff, I would get a warning. But if my brother did, he would get letters and letters and maybe a howler and once we got home, he might even get a beating, depends on how serious my brother acted out. I know that my brother sometimes took whippings for me and it frightens me. They did this because he was the heir to both the Black and the Malfoy and I was female while he was male, the Malfoy line will continue on his end while mine it would not.
I gasp, why was our family always involved? Matilda was another cousin but on our mother’s side. Some random cousin of mother’s that got disowned for marrying a muggle. Our mother kept in touch though with the cousin because they were very close. Matilda had two sisters as well, Rachel and Lucy. Rachel was four years older than me and Lucy was only two years older. Matilda was the year below me.
And then she spills it all, the speech and the reaction their father would have and the end result, both of them together. The girl expects her brother to say no, he is still thinking that their father is great. But perhaps she is rubbing off on him because he smirks back at her. He sits up on his elbows and opens his mouth.
Professor McGonogall coughs loudly into his hand before Draco can reply. I focus back on the screen, thankful that someone stopped the fight and that no one got hurt.
Blaise shrugged and reached up and scratched at the image of a pear. Nothing happened for a few seconds and Cass was sure they had been tricked and that the twins would hex them and run off laughing or something. But finally, the portrait swung open and peering inside Cass saw house elves running around, the smell of freshly baked pastries filling her nose and she knew this was the kitchen.
“No one should be alone. Not after that.” Granger responds and yanks her arm out of his arm, walking over to the room. Weasley follows afterwards with a sigh. The movie continues once they leave.
Draco frowns. The meaning of invicta was ‘unconquered’. It should be a good sign that he had picked the right house but it only gave him a bad feeling. He decided everything would be fine after a good night's sleep.
Dumbledore saw us and waved us over. He pulled out his wand and said a spell I couldn’t hear and a large screen showed. I gasped and Dumbledore spoke, a twinkle in his eye, “This is a projector to show the CDs on.”
I nod, unable to speak. I had never seen anything like it and neither had Draco so I assumed it was a muggle object. It interested me so I was sure to search up ‘projector’ later. Dumbledore told us to take a seat at our table so we did and soon, students began to fill in, all of them people I remembered were on the list. I was searching for students who weren’t on it but it seemed no one that wasn’t on the list were interested in coming.
Pansy pets my cat who licks her hand while Blaise sticks his finger in the cage at Persephone. Persephone stares at the finger before snapping her jaws at it, almost biting the finger off. Blaise yells in fear and the screen goes black with the last picture being all of us making fun of Blaise.
It’s like someone flipped the switch on my brother because he immediately snaps his head over to her and says, “At least I could pronounce my r’s.”
I am thankful when they move away from the snake and retreat to a different animal. What I don’t expect is for Potter to start talking to the snake. I would have laughed at this if I didn’t know from second year that Potter is a parselmouth and if I didn’t do the same thing when I was young. There were many animals in the forest that I talked to when I was lonely.
I take out some cloth and Pansy hands me a cooling pack. I wrap the cloth around it and Blaise sets a cooling charm on it and I pass it over to Draco. He presses it against his eye and he cringes at the cold and the pressure against his bruise. I give my brother a side hug which he leans into. Underneath all his emotionless masks, my brother just wants love and is a big sap. The other two join us and we sit on the bed like this for a while until Daphne and Theo turn up along with Millicent, Greg and Vincent. We welcome them in and we sit in a large circle.
My brother shakes his head, “And thank god for that. Our father bought them before we were born because he thought they would express wealth and elegance but they are just really loud and annoying.”
I cheer because I’ve wanted to go down to the Slytherin common room since we got here. I miss the mermaids and the darkness and the green, “Hey Potter, you’ll get to see the common room for the first time.”
“Oh, nothing, nothing at all,” Draco answers, staring right at the girl despite the glares Cass was sending his way.
“Well,” She says, pondering, “We only have until tomorrow to give him back his precious, rich owl so we should send the letter today.”
Potter snorts and I look over at him, my eyebrows raised. He knows something that we don’t. I’m now more intrigued than before. I wonder what is going to happen next.
"We never asked him his name!" Draco exclaims and they groan in unison. How dumb could they be? The boy hopefully remembered her brother's name since she said it outloud a few times. They would have to run into the boy at Hogwarts sometime this year.
There are a few 8th years in the common room but we go unnoticed, no one cares about us or what we do anyway. I push the painting open and the two of us step out. The stairway is lit up with a few lanterns but not bright enough for people to see us. We stride down the stairs in silence, skipping any of the purposely squeaky stair steps that alert teacher or students of you going down. The hallways are deserted at this time, only one or two students out who are either prefects or have detention. Our blonde hair stood out but one quick glance at the green on our ropes made people immediately look the other way. It was a curse and a blessing.
All of their friends had been there for Draco’s obsession over the boy. From reading all the children’s books to writing letters to him. It had died down over the past few years but it didn’t take much to start it up again.
Theo and his group passed the common room and Draco made sure to give them his worst stink eye. He didn’t care if Vince and Greg were part of that group, Theo was going down. He and Daphne were never close with the rest of them when they were kids as they preferred doing things alone rather than with everyone else. That was fine, Draco even understood sometimes, but that didn’t excuse the rude behaviour he always had towards them which he had ignored since they had known each other since they were in diapers.
That’s when I realise they are happy tears. Her mother wraps her up in a big hug and there is crying and laughter and joy. Eleanor claps and yells:
Neither of the twins were paying attention though, used to their father complaining about the old coot but also distracted by the food that had popped up on the table in front of them. There was roast, steak, kidney and shepherds pie and even mashed potatoes with sausages. Looking down the table, Cass spotted even more dishes of food. If this was the meals everyday, well, she could get used to this even if she had to listen to Dumbledore.
From behind her she hears the girl she bumped into, Hermione, whisper, “It’s not real, the ceiling. It’s just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.”
I’m not sure how Grace got in Slytherin, because she should be a Gryffindor or even a Hufflepuff for she doesn’t question me about why. Maybe that’s why she is a Slytherin because people underestimate her and then she surprises them with her Slytherin side. She goes back inside because Jessica is planning a big heist to steal her makeup back from Pansy, which will probably end badly so she doesn’t want to miss it. I wave goodbye and Draco and I make our way to the boy’s side.
Weasley snorts but Draco and I don't even snap at him, just sunk in our seats. Pansy rests a hand on my shoulder and its comforting but not enough. Some of the Gryffindors, including Potter and Granger, glance our way but I ignore the stares that pierce through my brothers and I's skulls.
I rolled my eyes at her but waved goodbye when I walked up the stairs to the girl’s dormitories. Sally-Anne, Susan, Hannah and I had been good friends since second year when our timetables changed and we had herbology with the Hufflepuffs. They were understanding, not caring I was a Slytherin or a Malfoy, and sometimes when I met up with them, I dragged Draco along and they were welcoming. We brought out the other sides of each other, I showed my caring side while the puffs showed their badass side which I loved seeing. They really knew how to sass people.
It seemed odd for the blinds to have been closed when it was such a nice day outside. That’s when something caught her eye. Sitting next to the candle was a black book, a journal. Draco walked over to it, a foul stench wafting into his nose from the book, and flipped open the book cover. Inside was written:
An owl suddenly flies through the open window and drops the letter on young Longbottom’s lap and soars back out into the sky. His face is full of shock and he doesn’t waste time picking the letter up. The Hogwarts seal is on the back so he opens the envelope, making sure to not tear the paper. The letter slides out and he grips it tightly.
I smile at the cake. Though it doesn't look like much, compared to the dirt cake Potter drew on the floor earlier, it’s much better and edible. The only thing the dirt one had was candles and ‘Happy Birthday’ spelt correctly.
I had heard from Luna that it was a riddle but I couldn’t see any. Before any of us could reply, the eagle talks,
That surprised Cassiopeia. Never before had her brother expressed doubts about what house he would be in. It was always going to be Slytherin and there was nothing that made him change his mind. It didn’t help that their parents reminded them constantly that Slytherin was the only respectable house for them to be. But even without their reminders, he constantly talked about what the common rooms would be like and who he would share a dorm with and how he always looked good in green which would make her laugh. But now, getting closer to their chosen compartment at the very back, he seemed relatively anxious and seemed to think he could be in another house.
A mysterious voice, seemingly coming from the ceiling, hushes Potter and he shuts up almost automatically. “Sorry to scare you. I’m Samantha, the one who gave you these CD’s. I’ll only speak when someone is about to say a spoiler and I cast a

-Goodbye then, Harry Potter,-Draco offered him his hand,-I want you to know that I do wish things were different,-If even a year ago someone had told Draco he would say those words to Harry, he'd laugh at their faces. But now their fake hatred didn't matter. After the war past enemies didn't seem like enemies anymore.
-Oh, you brought a friend again, how swell!-she said. Her glasses were hanging on the chain around her neck and once she took them on to see who Draco’s plus-one was, her hand shot up to her chest and the glasses fell back off,-Oh dear…Harry Potter!
-You could try. However, I’m afraid it will not lead to anything,-he replied,-Mr. Malfoy, if you are ready to stop wasting everyone’s time,-knight took out his sword and pointed it at the door and table next to it, that still missed one name.
-You have somewhere to go. Even if the Manor is gone,-Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, searching for an answer there, but Potter just kept his sly smile and waited for Malfoy to get it himself.
-5 years is a lot of time!-Draco cut him off,-And even then, coming back there every summer? She is unhappy there!
-And she’s not even sorry about it. “I’m sorry if you’re upset”, of course I am upset!-Malfoy was getting angrier with every second. He got up and started walking around the room, throwing hands and almost yelling,-Isn’t it just awfully selfish? Selling the manor, pretending nothing ever happened? What will father thing when he finds out? He’ll call me a traitor!
-Really? This is amazing!-Ron didn’t look so excited anymore,-I mean, you totally deserve it. I’m very proud of you,-Draco felt like he should leave them alone. He wasn’t a part of this. Wasn’t supposed to be.
-Promise,-Draco promised gladly because the feeling of someone waiting for you was one of the most amazing things he had ever felt. The whole night was full of the most amazing things he had ever felt. He really wished he could stay, but there were minutes left and he didn’t have a choice,-Goodbye, Potter. It’s been nice.
-Give me a second!-Harry did his best to clear his mind. It worked. With a loud clap they disappeared and when Draco and Harry opened their eyes, they were already standing in front of the number 12 Grimmauld Place. Muggles’ houses moved sideways, revealing Harry’s. Draco gasped.
-Is everyone here?-Professor Hooch asked as the field started getting crowded. Half of their class was there, but once she checked the list, it turned out Malfoy was the only one missing. Potential members of Hogwarts’ newest Quidditch team lined up in front of the professor and waited for her orders,-As usual, Seekers are the last ones to try out, so Mister Malfoy still has some time. However, if he doesn’t get here in time, Mister Potter, the position is yours.
-Is it? I don’t want to go back there,-for a few seconds Draco remained silent. Harry just stood there, with no idea what to do. He had already forgotten about Ron, or Quidditch, or why he was there in the first place. He waited for Draco to say something, and accidentally touched the doorknob, that inevitably made a sound that Malfoy couldn’t help but notice. During that fraction of a second, Harry already cursed whoever had built and rebuilt Hogwarts. Why would there even be any doorknobs when the doors are opened by passwords?
-We will play a game that should help us narrow your opportunities down. Now, close your eyes,-Draco did as he was told. His heart immediately started beating faster,-Imagine that none of your previous actions or mistakes have any impact on your future. Imagine that all of your grates are excellent, which is almost true, imagine that all the doors are open,-Draco slightly nodded. He liked what he was seeing,-Also, you don’t have to make money. There’s no such thing as money. And not a single person in this world has any expectations on you. No peer pressure, no social statuses, nothing. Imagined?
year. Draco had to lie that he already had a date and we went together,-Harry remembered the day he and Draco decided to go together. That explained Malfoy’s quick lie.
The snitch gleamed near Hufflepuff’s goal hoops and Malfoy noticed it. Draco was way closer to the snitch than Dora, but he didn’t rush to it using his full speed, instead he started moving pretty carefully, not gaining much attention from Hufflepuff’s captain. He was halfway across the pitch when she, fast as the lightning bold flew to get the snitch first.
Speaking of Ron! He did come up with the most amazing, romantic and loving way to invite Hermione to the Ball. He worked on it for so long and found something flawless. If he used it back in 4
Harry and Hermione ran towards the pitch. They were both out of breath from all the screaming, but the feeling of complete rapture took over them both. Hermione immediately jumped into Ron’s arms. She kissed him and he kept laughing and smiling, holding her in his arms. Harry watched them with one eye as he finally found Malfoy in the crowd that filled the Quidditch pitch. He pulled him towards himself.
-Really? Well, you are SO dramatic, I can’t even begin to describe!-they both were laughing now, talking over each other,-You should have seen your face, really.
Harry stood a little aside, watched Draco and smiled. He felt…weirder now. What could have happened, what he almost did, it scared him. But at the same time…he sort of was upset they were interrupted.
-I’m sorry, mate, but I can’t imagine a fair game with you losing to…,-Ron got quiet once he looked into the room. Ginny was sitting on their couch, clearly waiting for someone. Ron and Harry froze. Harry wanted to run.
-But you don’t now, right?-Draco shrugged. But it meant yes,-You have to tell her! You can’t just leave now!
-I just…I wanted to say I’m sorry and…you really don’t owe me anything, I mean it,-Harry was mumbling. He took a deep breath to get his thoughts in order and looked Draco straight into his eyes,-I have no idea where you get that patience from, I would have already fought half of the school if I was you,-Harry said,-And…if you can’t stand up for yourself, I’ll do that,-that promise came out awkward, not half as strong as Harry implied. But he meant it, every word.
-I’ve had pleasure to work with many great Slytherins during my life. Great in completely different ways. But what they all had in common, is that none of them could ever be stopped by a closed door or a simple no. I don’t believe that you can be too, Mister Malfoy.
-Yeah,-Draco buried his face in the cup, tasting the bittersweet drink and inhaling the smell. He waited for coffee to do its special magic, but it almost never worked on him.
-Just stop lying to him. He already forgave you, just don’t let it happen again,-Hermione said. And Harry wished he could say that there were no lies between them anymore, that their fight could be forgotten and they could trust each other again. But…,-What?
Now, an hour before the Ball was supposed to start, Harry looked back at the moment with a smile. He was standing in front of the mirror in the common room, while Hermione was trying to get a hold of his hair. Ron was half-asleep on the couch, already dressed and ready.
-Sure,-Harry replied,-It was…nice. Because it was with you,-Draco, who claimed to never blush - because only idiots who can’t hide their emotions and wear their hearts on their sleeves blush - blushed so desperately that his cheeks were actually hot. Harry just smiled again and said a password (Meliora, Latin). The door opened and Draco walked into the common room first.
Next time Draco saw Potter that day was on his way to the class. The second class of the day, actually, because Mister Potter, for a reason known only to him, had decided not to honor the mortals with his presence on the Potions. Draco could hear Snape’s voice saying those words, added to many other taunts and sadly smiled to himself.
-For him to get along with Draco. Maybe then he’ll understand that he was innocent and I did what I had to do.
-I guess you could,-it was hard to explain what, but something made Draco sit down there. It was slightly humiliating, very weird and new, but also kind of…nice. He waited for Ron to start complaining, but he didn’t. At all. Well, not about Draco. He complained about homework for the whole breakfast.
-No one wants her,-Draco said, doomily,-Everyone wants little babies they can pretend were theirs from the start. No one wants an already formed child with her own temper,-Draco sighed,-I know I can’t do much. They wouldn’t give her to me even if I tried. It’s just…
-Are you aware how that trail went down, Professor?-Draco asked. Potter’s presence was a secret, but something told him that Headmistress knew how to keep one,-Harry Potter testified for me. He convinced the minister to let me go. I haven’t been proven innocent, Potter bailed me out,-he sighed, as if admitting his weakness. Draco still wasn’t sure what he felt about Harry’s actions in court. He was obviously very relieved and grateful, he valued his freedom a lot. But at the same time, Draco now owed that said freedom to someone else, owed his whole life basically, because in his case, going to Azkaban equaled to death. And his pride absolutely hated the fact that Harry Potter had saved his life, without ever asking for anything in return.
-Yes,-said Harry right away. Draco’s heart jumped,-I do. He was scared, we all were. He didn’t have a choice. Draco is innocent.
Ron Weasley wasn’t as oblivious and blind as people thought he was. Sometimes he just chose not to notice certain things, either for his own comfort, or for comfort of other people. Sometimes he noticed everything, but didn’t act on it. Sometimes he noticed more than anyone else did. And when Harry casually mentioned to him and Hermione who his date for the ball was – casually, but with terror in his eyes – Ron reacted the way Harry would expect him too; shock, a bit of disgust, a lot of mistrust. But inside, he admitted that it was a perfectly expectable turn of events.
-Not everyone! Someone has to be too cool for lame school dances,-she said,-Come on…HA!-the door opened and a girl walked out,-Oh my god, that’s Astoria! We’re so lucky!-she looked at Draco who started shaking his head.
-I am not dating anyone, especially Luna,-he said. And Harry couldn’t help but notice he said “Luna”. Not just “Lovegood”
-That’s…not very like him,-Harry knew it was just Hermione’s way to say “You are insanely wrong”, but still, something made him think he wasn’t. The way Draco constantly looked at Ron, the way he stopped himself from flying after the snitch, and misdirected Dora Williams, Hufflepuff’s seeker, instead.
-He won’t be dressed up,-Harry said, opening up the curtain. The suit was too big for him, but the color looked pretty great.
-Nervous doesn’t even begin to cover it,-she said. The game hadn’t started yet but it was minutes away,-And how’s Malfoy?-there was only a drop of bitterness in her voice, but even that didn’t go unnoticed.
His seat was still available. The word about their fight hadn’t gone out yet, so no one would even think about sitting there. But neither did Harry. Instead, he took his seat in the back of the class. Next to Malfoy. Again.
-Did you and Pansy ever date?-Harry tried to sound casual and indifferent, but let’s just say that if he paid half as much attention to the classes as he did to Draco’s answer, Hermione would have a competitor.
-You promised not to cry,-Draco kneeled in front of Lucy and wiped her cheeks. She wasn’t sobbing yet, tears just silently fell down.
-Oh no, Malfoy, please don’t go!-he almost yelled,-You are the one Harry shares everything with now, you should be a part of this conversation,-Draco froze.
-It’s…I’ll explain later. I’m really tired and I have homework,-Harry got up. He imagined himself writing an essay now, after two long days and one very short night, and wanted to cry.
-Yes, but don’t you think that if Mr. Draco was as innocent as you think he is, he would try and stop his father? Or affect him and his actions in any way?-she asked. Draco didn’t like it. Hearing them talking about his dad and not being able to say anything.
-Thank you, loser,-Harry smirked. By the time they realized they were still holding hands, Ron and Hermione approached them.
A lot has happened since the last time I posted; I turned 19 (wow), I got absolutely obsessed with 'Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency' (please watch it) and I kinda got tired of this fic. I do not know when the next part will be posted - in case anyone was actually looking forward to this one.
-I have to say this,-he said. He was halfway done with the paste,-It’s so weird seeing you like this.
-I don’t know,-he looked down, embarrassed by his own indecisiveness. National Hero isn’t supposed to act this way. He’s supposed to always know what he wants and do whatever it takes to have it.
-I’m a horrible captain,-Ron said to Harry as they walked back into the castle after one of the trainings. It was late September, there was a little over two weeks before the first game of the season with Hufflepuffs. Ron started getting nervous. And when Ron gets nervous, he starts doubting himself.
-Uhm, okay,-the girl clearly hoped for some privacy and threw an unsatisfied glance at Draco,-I was wondering if you…wanted to go to the Ball with me?
-Just trying to see how hopeless you are,-he said,-I guess I’ve seen enough,-Harry felt a strong desire to grab Draco’s hand and drag him away from this field. From Ron, who obviously blames him for their fight, from all the other teammates who use him as a puppet to let their anger out on. Just take him away and protect him from all this mess. Instead he just looked at him with a silent “are you okay?” in his eyes. Draco seemed to have gotten it and gave him a slight nod. One of the last trainings before the match was over.
At the door is Professor McGonogall, holding a letter in her hands. Most of the muggleborns gasp and a collective of “You got McGonagall!” and “The best teacher to pair with her.” filled the room. I roll my eyes.
She smirks and I know I’ve chosen the wrong one, “I dare you to sneak up to the Astronomy tower and kidnap an owl.”
Cass tried to make conversation with the two boys but it’s mostly awkward. Draco is able to talk about Quidditch with Ron until teams come up and they switch to telling Harry the rules. It doesn’t go bad though and Draco doesn’t insult either of them once which she considers a win. Cass is resting her head against the wall near the door. She’s barely awake but listening into the conversation to make sure Draco doesn’t cross any lines. It’s nice. She doesn’t know the two boys well but she can tell Draco is ecstatic even if he is in the company of a Weasley.
“Ew,” Draco cringes, “It’s bad coming from Pansy, but from my sister, it’s just disgusting. Never say that again.”
As they walk through the opening in the wall, the Prefect hands them a slip of paper which he realises is a list of his schedule for the rest of the year. He is surprised when he glances up by the look of the common room. Draco had been told it would be leather couches and damp with a cold atmosphere and a green, eerie feeling. However, the couches looked leather but the students sitting on them sink into the cushions and look comfy. Lights are everywhere and a fire is crackling in the fireplace. Blankets are everywhere and there is an entire wall that looks out to the water of the Great Lake.
She watched as the paper caught fire, the flames licking the edges. Normally, her father would just vanish things but that could always be traced, burning a paper the muggle way was more efficient. Once the paper was reduced to ashes, Draco blew out the candle and placed it back in the cupboard where he found it.
Hagrid glances at Dumbledore who only smiles, “It’s all in the past now, Hagrid. I thank you though for doing what I did not. I should have taken Harry out of there when he was younger but I was being selfish, thinking it was the only way to protect him when I knew it was not.”
“Yeah, it’s something isn’t it?” the Prefect chuckles, “But if anyone from the other houses comes over or if one of your parents wants to visit, let us know. We change the common room to fit their expectations or at least the stereotypes of us snakes. Can’t let them know who we truly are, you know?”
“But if you are associated with a different gender identity, we can always figure something out for you.” The Head Boy adds in which the prefects and heads nod along with.
He clinks his spoon against his goblet, says some random words and announces, “Let the feast… begin.”
“Well, it appears that we have come to the end of the first section of the CD. Let’s take this time to take a break. Games are over there with lunch and rooms for sleeping or talking.” He then winks at us and I look up at him in disgust. Not all of us were going to do what he was suggesting, some of us were single.
The girl was not phased at all by the boy’s anger, just rolled her eyes at him, “C'est bien, Draco. Ci, personne ne croit en la magie, de toute façon..”
Now this got my attention. I could lie and say I didn’t cheat but then this argument would go for weeks. I could say the truth and then be bombarded by the others yelling at me. “And what exactly did I do?” Hopefully my innocent face was as convincing as my mother told me.
Their father snatches it out of his hand, glaring at him, “You should know better than that Draco, stealing my book. This is dark magic, should not be in the possession of children.”
My brother tries to shush me but it’s too late, Flinch must have heard our footsteps going down the back stairs because Mrs Norris was at our feet, Flinch coming down the stairs. My face flushes and I hide the owl behind my back as Flinch stalks over to us.
As he closed his eyes, Draco hoped that these next seven years would be the best. He was counting on it because who knows what could happen in that amount of time.
Draco did know and he liked this. He didn’t want the other houses to think they were soft but he also didn’t want them to think him as cruel. Maybe his sister was really rubbing off on him.
And Cass was right. When they walked up to her desk and showed the permission slip, Madam Pince could do nothing to stop them. Though Cass was pretty sure from the way the librarian glared at them as they walked to the Restricted Area that she still disliked them even if it was the second day. She probably thought they forged it.
Everyone seems to relax at the familiar face and I see Hagrid brighten up at seeing himself on the screen again. Personally, I hope I don’t see myself, or any of the Slytherins, up on the screen for a long time or better yet, never again. Knowing Dumbledore though, the chance of that is unlikely.
To entertain myself, I thought about what Potter’s reaction would be when he saw that Draco and I had been faking all the mean things we said towards Luna and that we were actually cousins. Luna’s mother, Pandora, was our father’s sister but once she died, we stopped seeing them because our father felt we didn’t have to anymore with his sister dead. Our mother snuck us out a few times to visit them, though.
The bricks begin to move and create an entrance to what he believes is the common room. Gasps echo throughout the students but Draco had already been told of this by his mother.
Hope you enjoyed this. Luna, Cass and Draco are cousins btw :) I like that idea since they have similar hair colour (in the movies, not the books). Luna's mother is Draco's father's sister. Leave kudos and questions in the comments. And bookmark this too!
Also I know that i kind of forgot Theo was supposed to be rude in the other chapters so he's rude now lol (cause he's supposed to replace Draco later on (tho Draco is still kinda rude in this year))
Once we get down to the bottom, Potter shows us the list. “There are only Slytherin’s left on the list, no Hufflepuffs. Which means...”
Potter glared but Dumbledore just clapped his hands together, “Well, since you are all here, I have an announcement.”
Once everyone settles down, Dumbledore claps his hands together again and the lights above us turn off and the light above him stays on.  He smiles, not breaking eye contact with me, making my hair stand on end but I don’t look away.
Weasley shakes his head, “That’s accidental magic, mate. But that’s usually breaking something or levitating something, not making glass disappear.”
Draco was standing next to Pansy and Blaise and stepped to the side to let the girl with bushy hair past. That was the girl his sister had talked to on the train. She mumbled under her breath as she passed, “Just relax, it’s okay.”
And then he was off, walking out of the door so he could aparate away. Our father addressed us with an approving look,
The screen goes black and then turns back on. A young boy with dark brown hair to match his skin was staring at the Nimbus 2000 broom. Dean Thomas groans and Finnigan laughs, patting him on the back. The scene doesn't last long, he talks with another boy who he doesn’t seem to know very well about wishing he had the broom. It quickly changes.
I can tell Draco does not know how to answer this without spilling all our secrets so I butted in, “Ok Potter, enough questions. Luna, we need you to go to the great hall at eleven, just by yourself, can you do that? We will explain everything then.”
An old lady, his grandmother, is already sitting in a chair. She glances up at him from over her glasses.
The hat doesn’t reply for a few seconds and Draco suddenly panics, did he break the hat? But then it speaks,
She had guessed from the ginger hair that he was a Weasley but didn’t want to ask in case it came off offence or she was wrong. There were plenty of red-heads on the train but their father talked a lot about the Weasleys. How the lot were blood-traitors and stupid Gryffindors with too many children to feed and worn down clothes.
I stop thinking about that and as I gaze up, a head of platinum blonde hair, almost identical to mine except mine is darker, catches my eye so I jog to catch up with him, “Hey Dray, where are you heading to?”
Theo ponders, “Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws are out because I don’t think they would want to play with us. Ravenclaws don’t seem like the party type and neither do the Hufflepuffs. Which leaves… the Gryffindors.”
We all say goodbye, Potter still confused, but he doesn’t say anything as we make our way down the stairs from the Ravenclaw common room and off to the Gryffindor common room to pick up some of the younger students. Slytherin is last and there’s no one in Hufflepuff we need that are not in the eighth year.
Pansy stares at it, tilting her head before nodding slowly, “Yes, I think it will. I was planning on wearing that yellow and white shirt with maroon pants and maroon high heels.”
Draco knocks on the door but I don’t wait for an answer and barge in, it is my dorm as well. Millicent is the only one there, Daphne and Pansy must have already left for breakfast. She looks up as we enter, “Can you do me a favour, Millie?”
They all looked around for the culprit and saw Theo and his group waving a bottle of pumpkin juice at them before disappearing into the crowd.
There was silence and she wished the other girl wasn’t a pureblood. Most of the supremacist purebloods would know that there were no Black that wasn't dead or in Azkaban. Hopefully, no one was that interested in figuring out who she was. With her new look, people would assume she was another girl, nothing special about her. Her father ordered her beforehand to change her hair colour to a golden blonde along with adding a slight tan to her skin. Now, she didn't look like Draco's sister but only a distant cousin. The girl didn't seem to notice anything strange, grinning and sticking her hand out to her which Cass shook.
Katrina rolls her eyes, “That’s still the most ridiculous superstition I’ve heard. I’m left-handed and look at me!”
Grace is very cheerful, full of life and joy and is the conversation starter out of the four of them while Katrina is more quiet and cold. She adds in to the conversation but keeps her distance and mostly reads her book. Cass can tell Katrina is just more protective of herself, that someone hurt her once so she has walls up. She understands because that’s just like Draco in public with his snobbish attitude. It’s a shield around him, his default personality though in reality he is kind and just like any other child. Katrina had a very dark sense of humour which matched Draco's perfectly and Cass learns early on that most of what Katerina said was sarcasm.
The library doors shut behind them with a bang and all five of them flinched at the noise. Madam Pince was not to be messed with and they learnt that the hard way. Who knew such an old lady could hear that well? Or maybe they were just loud. Sitting on the steps, they all sighed in unison.
Sorry I haven't updated in a while, this chapter was a real slug for me because nothing interesting happens in it for me. I put the train and the sorting all in one because I was too lazy to seperate it. Hopefully you guys like the OC's and that I didn't change any houses. Also there are a lot of students in each year in each house because this is the wizarding school for all of Britain but I think other students from other countries also go there too sooo idk
Cass and Draco clapped to be polite but there was really no need because half of the Gryffindor table was the Weasley’s family and they were cheering like crazy. Weasley flustered under the attention when he sat down and his brothers all clapped him on the back or brought him into a hug but Cass could tell he was enjoying it. The Great Hall quietened down and the next name was read out.
Real life Hagrid starts sniffling and tears appear in both their  eyes. He clears his throat and he pulls a tissue out of his pocket and blows his nose.
He welcomes me in and Blaise waves from his bed where he is reading some book for some reason. Theo is in the bed across from Blaise’s in the far right corner sleeping, slight snores coming from him. I hear Draco mutter a wandless ‘
Draco and Cass headed to his dorm room to keep the book there so they didn’t have to carry it around the whole day. They hid it in his trunk, locking it shut with a spell his Father taught him that would only open to him.
He tucks himself underneath the blankets, snuggling into the comfy mattress. Draco wishes his friends goodnight and the lights immediately turn off. He grins into his pillow, listening to the comforting sound of the swish of water as his bed was the closest to the window. It drowned out the sound of snores from the other beds which was good.
Hagrid, who is sitting on the teachers table, frowns at this and tries to make eye contact with her but she seems to be trying to avoid it.
She switches the bags with me, “I heard from Daphne that you had to do something with Potter and if you’re associating with Potter and Draco in the same room, it can never turn out good so I just wanted to wish you good luck,” I smile and that and give her a hug, when I let go she adds, “But seriously, you can’t have a blue handbag with all that other blue, it’s too much.”
The two look at each other, grinning before Draco realises who the other is and looks away, a slight blush on his cheeks. Potter almost looks disappointed but I hold back the urge to smirk. These two were ridiculous. I focus back on the screen.
Millie and Blaise entered the dorm room, “We found an owl up there with a potion delivery for Snape from Hogsmeade. So, we sent a letter to them saying Professor Snape forgot one more ingredient and they gave us a vial!”
The woman measuring Hannah says and Hannah rushes off with her new robes. She doesn’t even bother saying goodbye. She pays for her robes with money her mother gave her and leaves the shop
“This one.” Blaise pointed at one of the compartments and Cass doesn’t even have time to tell her brother to behave before he’s sliding the door open.
Looking at the screen, I had to admit that despite the terrible name, Hedwig was a beautiful owl. Her snowy white feathers and bright eyes. Hagrid must have bought one of the more expensive ones because Hedwig seemed like the type of owl that could be found in the Malfoy owlery. One of the smaller, cheaper ones but still, she could be one.
“Well, see you tomorrow at nine Potter. Don’t be late.” I then walk off, smirking as I hear Draco mumble a “Bye, Potter.” before trailing behind me, leaving Potter in the dust.
Hagrid looks down at Potter from the teachers table and smiles. It wasn’t goodbye, just a very long time in between the first and second hello. Sometimes, I have to agree that the Headmaster says wise things a few times.
Everyone laughs as Dudley goes flying forward into the snake’s cage, getting drenched in water. Granger’s eyes are wide with eagerness, “How did you make the glass disappear?! That is difficult magic and you just did it then!”
One thing as well is that the people who came back from the dead or people who just appeared are: the Weasleys (including Fred but not the parents), two OC's named Lucy and Rachel, Oliver Wood, Marcus Flint, and just other random people or students that already graduated. The Dursely's are not here though. In the later books, Sirius and Remus, Tonks, etc. will appear. The teachers for that movie will appear as well (except Quirrell cause he died)
More laughter fills the room at Petunia’s face and everyone agrees with Dudley. The atmosphere changes to a more somber feeling along with the setting change on the screen. I gasp and hear Draco’s breath hitch next to me.
The two siblings attached the letter to his leg and sent him off. All they had to do now was to wait for Matthias reply. It shouldn’t take too long.
“I’m Hannah Abbott. What house do you think you’re going to be in? All the houses sound nice but my mum says I would be good in Hufflepuff.” The girl rambles on and Draco can’t help but stifle back a laugh at the name of the house she wants.
My brother’s nose crinkles, “Pumpkin? What kind of horrid nickname is that? Calling a child after a food?”
Draco next to me is furrowing his brow and asks me, “Didn’t they eat our birthday cake at our ninth birthday party?”
I give him a side hug, “Because they knew you would win if they didn’t threaten you with expulsion.”
Draco almost groans out loud, Crabbe and Goyle were dumb rocks and Pansy would never leave him alone. “And finally…”
It was the muggleborn, Jessica her name was, and she was sorted into Slytherin. Cass cheered for the girl and then it was just Blaise left. So far, all their friends and even pureblood acquaintances had been sorted into Slytherin so it was just him left.
Millie coughed into her hand, “Come on guys, we need to get the next things on the list; a bottle of pumpkin juice from the kitchens and a token from each house.”
And then Professor McGonogall disappeared, leaving young Granger and her parents confused. That was ridiculous. If I wasn’t a pureblood and this happened to me, I wouldn’t believe it one bit. Pansy seemed to have the same thought.
It was a tradition in the wizarding world for when a child turns eleven, they would receive a letter from a wizarding school. Sometimes it depended on what country you lived in or if you had applied beforehand for what school accepted you. Their father had first wanted to send them to the wizarding school, Drumstrang, in Russia because their father knew the headmaster. Luckily, their mother did not want her children that far away from her but now they were being sent to different schools. They could never win.
“That was a lot to handle, especially for some people, so why don’t we all take a break. There are snacks on the tables and restrooms to the left.” He sits back down.
I raise an eyebrow, “Why are you getting this worried? We’re just going to meet Pot- oh! You have a crush!”
A few other muggleborns blushed, thinking of how their parents acted at the idea of magic. They most likely kicked out the professors or threw a hissy fit. The screen finally switched again and Cass paled. No one would recognize the manor since this was the one in France. Potter, Wealsey and Granger had seen the one in England which they stayed in for Christmas and the last summers of Hogwarts. They usually stayed in France for summer but with you-know-you there, they had to stay in England.
"Yes." He replied, resisting the urge to roll his eyes, but he didn't say anything else and silence stretched between the two. It seemed the conversation ended there and her brother was waiting for more questions but the boy had nothing else to say.
Headmaster Dumbledore grins, “We are fortunate then that there is a spell for that.” He mumbles a spell and directs it at the box with the CD in it. I hope it doesn’t work and I can Draco does as well. We are unlucky, though, because my younger self’s voice fills the room again but this time in English.
The owner tried to protest, telling her the animals were dangerous but the glare from the woman shut him up. He gathered all the necessities needed for the two cats, put it in a bag and told her the price. The two cats along with their stuff was paid for and then the three of them left. It wasn't until they were outside that Draco pondered the new name for his cat. Cass was happy with Diana but Cecilia only reminded her that she was blind. He thought about it the whole way to the broom shop. Then in the middle of the alley, he blurts out.
Everyone groaned, hoping Potter would have been able to get the answer out from Hagrid. No such luck it seemed. Not only did they want to know who got into Gringotts and tried to steal something and how but what they wanted to know what Hagrid had to get for Hogwarts. What was so special about it? It didn’t look like money. Why was it a secret?
Anyways, I kept switching between trial, ceremony and ritual but it's actually more of a test to see who are the true Slytherins. Also I was lazy with characterisation so Millicent, Blaise and Pansy kinda sound the same, so sorry. Millie supposed to be more tomboy, Pansy is supposed to be girly (but like with a bitch attitude), Blaise is just *finger guns* and then there's Cass and Draco.
Potter huffed but didn’t say anything more. Dumbledore sighed, “Well, now that you know, tomorrow your job is to gather up all the students on this list and get them in the great hall at eleven. Classes for the week are cancelled for the students on the list.”
Inside the compartment, Pansy sent Cass a look and she understood and got up to follow the two boys. The two girls already knew what the boys were planning to do and knowing her brother, he would find a way to either offend Harry Potter or embarrass himself. She left the compartment and jogged to catch up to her brother and Blaise. Blaise was a great friend but he could never get her brother under control like she could. Besides, he would probably just laugh at Draco if he made a fool of himself.
This was Harry Potter? The legend that killed You-Know-Who as a baby and survived the killing curse? He was wearing baggy clothes and looked like he hadn’t had a proper meal in a while. Cass knew the look. Sometimes, if her brother behaved badly he was sent to the dungeons for a few days. The longest had been a week and Draco had come out shivering and skinny. It didn’t surprise her why Draco didn’t openly show his tolerance for all types of blood because he knew the consequences. Cass had never been sent to the dungeons but she had gotten different punishments.
“Is that all you need, Young Mistress Cassiopeia?” Dobby asks, his hands trembling with fear that he may be punished for not being able to write. He knew the two children were kinder than their parents but sometimes if they were angry with him, he had to slam the oven door on his hand.
“Draco!” Cass hushed him, nudging her brother in the ribs, “I am so sorry for his attitude. He’s been grumpy today because we woke him up. I’m Cassiopeia Black, pleasure to meet you.”
For a second, the two think they have been caught but their father continues, “Not accepting you into their school! Ugh, I would send a letter to them complaining but they do not deserve a letter from us. If they won’t accept you on their own then they won’t get you at all. Now we have to find a different school for you to go to.”
On their way to their compartment, Cass bumped into a girl with bushy hair who was reading while walking. She stumbled backwards while the girl fell on the floor, “Oh, I’m so sorry!”
Weasley glares and is about to challenge Draco when Granger sees me holding the painting open and says, “Only 8th years are allowed in there.”
“Alright, to begin the ceremony, we will call each group up one by one and you will present your items to us. We’ll tell you if you passed or not. Don’t worry, if you fail, you can try again this weekend.” One of the Prefects said and called up the first group.
A few minutes later, I saw four girls come down, two redheads, one blond and the other a brunette. The Wesalette and Matilda were redheads but I did not know which of the other two were Spinks and Rogers. Chris had dirty blonde so perhaps Sophia had blond hair too but I was not sure. The other student leaves us seven alone. Matilda gives a small wave at me which I return, trying not to attract any unwanted attention to us.
The cover was a dark green leather and the title was written in silver lettering. Cass now understood why Severus chose this book. It was exactly Slytherin’s colours and it was quite heavy so Severus would get a kick out of imagining them carrying this book all the way back to the dungeons.
Then a little boy with the same colour hair as the girl and same baby blue eyes runs up next to the girl. He only rolls his eyes. Draco buries his head into my shoulder. Looking around the room, some people are looking at us like you would look at a cute puppy while others were disgusted by them thinking a Malfoy could be cute. Someone behind us awes and I turn around to see Astoria and Grace cooing at us.
Draco sniggers into his hand, obviously thinking of a few people that fall into the first category when Pansy mumbles to me, “Granger got the best of both worlds.”
I sigh and say, “Listen, Weasley. What do you think would have happened if I told my father, the death eater, that I didn’t agree with his ways, do you think he would have taken it kindly?”
Hannah grinned and took the hat off, walking to her new houses’ table. The Great Hall erupted into applause and didn’t settle down until the next name was called out. Cassioepia didn’t know any of the names and zoned out until “Bones, Susan.” was called out.
Daphne holds out a cute white dress with yellow daisies and green leaves on it, “Would this dress look good underneath my robes?”
“Finally,” Dumbledore says, “There will be breaks half through each CD and after every CD for people to eat and for other personal things. You may use it to hang with friends or talk with others. We will also set up some games to do so we can bond as a school. You do not have to wait until the break though to use the restroom or to get a snack, they are both over to the side on the left.”
I ignore it and continue my way down to the common room. It’s a bit of a long walk but in five or so minutes, we are there. It doesn’t take long for me to find the spot where the secret brick is. I pull it out and fiddle around for a piece of paper. When we were in Hogwarts before, we used to hide a paper with the passwords for the week on it in case we forget. No one ever found it though so it worked and I guess the younger students passed it along.
>A few more first years get sorted into Slytherin, including Theo, and then it’s Pansy’s turn. Draco wasn’t as close to the girl as Cass was and when he was younger, she annoyed him a lot. Now, he joined her for tea parties though he never really liked them but he enjoyed her company. Maybe when they got older she would be less, well, girly.
I gulp. This could go two ways: if I said Truth, she would make me spill about my not so secret crush on this girl in Gryffindor which I don’t want to talk about to her and if I said Dare, it would probably have to do with her or some stupid dare that results in me going out. I decide the second one is better because Draco would always help me if it was something I didn’t want to do. “Dare.”
The only teacher that would know was Professor Snape but Cass wasn’t sure if he would let them into the Restricted Area. Being a Slytherin was also about making smart choices, not like Gryffindors who would storm into things without thinking.
The wand itself meant great things for Draco and so their mother didn't not protest against the choice of wand. She paid for both wands and ushered her children out the door. Unbeknownst to them, their mother had been experiencing flashbacks to her first year during their time at the wand shop. The first time she went to collect her Hogwarts supplies and the first time she held her wand. All good memories but she would rather forget them. There was no use thinking about the past when the present was happening.
Dumbledore asks for us to come back to our seats and I sit down in the same chair, Draco to my left and Pansy to my right. “Now, it appears that the next section of the CD is not of the movie but extra videos that the person who gave this put in. The videos will be around the same time as the part of the movie we saw. This will include all other houses and people who are not here.”
“It’s ‘early bird gets the worm’ but you used it correctly.” Millie threw a thumbs up in Daphne’s direction to which she beamed at. Daphne had always been fascinated by muggle things and since Millicent was a half-blood, she had the perfect teacher.
We all laugh, Potter confused in the background which reminds me of the real reason we’re here, not a family reunion, “Ok, so Dumbledore has sent us to round up a bunch of people including you but you need to meet us at the great hall at eleven and we will explain everything there. Cool?”
“Welcome little snakes, to the kitchen,” One of the twins said but Cass wasn’t paying attention to them anymore.
Looking over, Potter seems visibly offended and shocked. Weasley stands up and shouts, “You gotta problem, Malfoy? Gonna run to your Daddy and tell him? Oh wait, that’s right, he’s in Azkaban.”
“I am not a drama queen,” She lifted her nose into the air, a smile appearing on her face but she didn’t move from her group.
At the same moment, the lady finished fitting her clothes and beckoned for her to go to the front and pay for the robes. The girl stepped off the stool, muttered a ‘goodbye’ without looking back and hurried away from the two. A few minutes later, the sound of the door chimes went off and the girl was gone. He was glad she was gone, he didn’t like her that much. She seemed dim-witted and very much a Hufflepuff and Draco didn’t want to deal with a Hufflepuff. His sister though, was not impressed.
I don’t say anything back. Thinking about it, there are plenty of people who got a good family and looks. Most of the Slytherins, well at least the purebloods, were in the second category. There were also a lot of ones that had the worst of both worlds.
Sitting on the edge of the shore, my feet splashing in the lake. Fish jumped up and down and I laughed as one sprayed me with water. The cold was refreshing since it was late summer, the end of September. The Great Lake frightened people, the unknown beneath the surface, the creatures hiding that no person would ever see. But, if you had grown up next to it for seven years, waking up to seeing mermaids and small sharks next to your window, then the lake was just another place wizards had yet to explore.
Everyone cheered, exicted they were able to relax until Madam Pince shushed them all and told them to quiet down or leave.
Her brother nods and the two leave the room they are in and head down the stairs, passing through hallways. Once they reach the bottom, Cass recognizes two familiar figures and grins when she sees her parents. Draco goes to hug them when he notices that they are not happy to see him and his sister.
Theo lets out a groan, “Ugh, your stupid rivalry. I can’t believe we have to watch it again. Why can’t you just kiss and make up already.”
As I walk past, scattered Slytherins, younger students, latch to my side. Slytherins now have to walk in groups of no less than three people unless you actually want to get beaten up by someone. Me and my brother, though, are usually the ones picked on most but being the eldest we have more safety because no one hits someone in front of a younger student. This makes us magnets to other Slytherins who need protection. My brother lets only a few others join him on his strolls but I don’t mind if there is a crowd around me, as long as everyone is safe.
“Hey Slytherin! Why don’t you slither your slimy ass back over to your own table!” A Gryffindor yelled at her, the rest of them chuckling at his hilarious joke, but she ignored them.
“Must remind you of your birthdays, hey Malfoy? Daddy buying you everything you want?” The other Gryffindors laugh at the comment and my brother opens his mouth but Dumbledore beats him to it.
“The letter states that these CDs show the past seven years in the perspective of Mr Harry Potter,” Gasps sound throughout the room, “But, the person who sent this has footage of the other three houses that they have edited into the CDs. This may revolve unsolved mysteries and tensions between students and may reveal secrets,”
Longbottom thankfully asks the question that I have wondered this whole time, “Are those your relatives, Harry?”
“Well anyone who doesn’t get in the other teams can join us.” Susan declares, loud enough for everyone to hear.
They had decided to give it to their father early, writing in the letter that the rejection letters were sent earlier than acceptance letters so they could use fewer owls. Draco didn’t think that sounded very proper but they had no other options. Miny had been a good help, her handwriting a nice wavy font. At the bottom of the letter, Cassiopeia had duplicated the signature from the first letter onto the paper before burning the first letter. There had to be no evidence that the letter was a fake.
He leaves to go to his study, their mother trailing after him, messing up her daughter’s hair with a rub before she leaves. Cassiopeia huffs, trying to flat it back down while Draco wraps her in a hug, squealing, “We’re going to Hogwarts together!”
And that’s when I remember that the second twin died in the war and that whatever magic the person, Samantha, who sent the note, did bring back anyone who died in the war. I spotted Lavender Brown and Colin Creevy sitting among us. Luckily, Vince, who we all thought died, had been sent to a ward and gotten treated. He seemed he was only severely burned. I did know that Draco had been avoiding him. He felt like it was his fault Vincent was burnt though no one believed it was.
Then it was Tracey next who always landed on ‘go to jail’ but was out the next round, saying she had a ‘get out of jail free’ card. Someone should have been checking because when another argument was happening in the group, I spotted Tracey moving her little flip phone out of jail. Since Tracey and Draco and a few others, including Astoria who had two pieces on the board and so she got two turns somehow, Blaise who was stealing property cards without buying them and Millicent who was silently moving her piece a few spaces ahead to get the place she wanted, I decided to end the game. By flipping the board in a hissy fit.
They all agreed that was a smarter choice than stealing from Professor Snape who would probably kick them out of Slytherin just for stealing from him, if they even got that far. They decided to spilt up as well to, as Millie would say, ‘kill two birds with one stone’.
I probably had to go wake my brother up now or else he will never be ready in time. Exiting the room, I made sure to close the door behind me softly and then made my way down the stairs and up the stairs to the boy’s side. All the Gryffindors had been surprised to see they had not been forced back down when going up the opposite gender’s stairs and even more shocked to hear none of the other houses, not even Slytmyin, had the same rule. I found it stupid because that didn’t stop homosexuality happening.
“Hufflepuff is simple, we can just get one of those replicas of Helga Hufflepuff’s cup from the library.” His sister says and Draco turns down a different hallway, adjusting their course to take them to the library.
“Oooh, what do we have here Fred? Looks like the little Slytherin’s are trying to find the kitchens.”
Potter is the one holding the list and he reads off a list of names to a random sixth year who wouldn’t let us in any further because we were Slytherins, “Um, Ginny Weasley, Ava Spinks and Sophia Rogers.” Other than the Weaslette, I have not heard of any of the others. I do wonder if Sophia Rogers is related to Chris Rogers, a Slytherin in our year. Draco looks at me and I know we had the same thought.
No one says anything in response, either they can’t think of what to say back or too busy processing what just happened. I can tell though that my words didn’t have a big effect on the majority of the Gryffindors. I’m not surprised, old habits die hard just like superstitions and stereotypes.
Pansy whispers in my ear, “I think that vault was the one the person tried to steal from because it happened on the same day and when the person got to the vault, it had already been emptied.”
The way Potter stutters over his words I can tell he is generally scared. If he’s scared that means this man has done bad things to him in the past. There’s part of me that wants to see what happens because it might help me understand him better but there’s another part that doesn’t want to see more because if I don’t see anymore than I can pretend that nothing else bad happens. But with Potter’s luck, more bad stuff is bound to happen. And this is only the beginning.
His father always told him that Malfoy’s were superior to others and Draco was a Malfoy, but he was also a Slytherin and they always took an advantage when they saw one. Draco had to decide which one he was more of but the wonder that filled him at communicating with the merpeople was far greater than any words his father told him. Wasn’t it useful? He was branching out and spreading his connections to a whole other species, shouldn’t his father be proud? There were many things his father said that Draco believed, but discarding muggle techniques was not one, there would be too many opportunities lost if Draco agreed with him.
The rest of the students seemed confused so I explained, “Left-handed people were uncommon back then and believed to be worse at magic. So all children were taught to do magic and write with their right hand. It’s an old superstition now but families still follow the tradition.”
Someone gasped and he felt a tingling on his chest. He looked down at his robes to see a small, green snake embedded beneath his Slytherin house patch. Draco watched it slither around his robes and allowed himself a small smile. He loved magic.
The mother laughs and calls for a house elf named Rini. The house elf appears with a cake on a plate in their hands. Rini sets it down on the table with a knife and three small plates before vanishing. The scene ends with the three of them happily eating the cake. The father isn’t present but I know that Susan’s parents got a divorce when she was nine.
“How dare she call you a freak! How dare she call us freaks!” Granger stands up, “How dare she lie to you about your parents!”
They both nod, anything is fine as long as they aren’t apart. Their father continues, “First, you must keep up the Malfoy facade, no speaking with any of your cousins in public.”
-Harry?-at first Potter didn’t even notice that someone was standing beside him. He was laughing at something Draco had said, and Malfoy had to nod at the poor girl for Harry to look at her.
-You’re here!-she exclaimed as she saw Draco and Harry, waking up Ron,-How did it go?-Harry look at Draco, hoping he would answer.
-Are they asleep?-Madam Polkinghorne ran into Draco and Harry as soon as they exited children’s room. Draco nodded at her question,-Very well. Should I be expecting you tomorrow?-another nod. Analise smiled and turned to Harry.
Because Draco is lonely. Because he feels like the whole world had turned its back on him. Because he is desperate, insecure and lost. And though Malfoy would rather die than admit any of it, he doesn’t really have to, not to Harry. It takes one to know one, right?
-MALFOY!-strong arms of Terry Boot and Megan Jones pulled him away from Harry before the irreversible could happen. They congratulated and praised him, so did they whole class. Ron, too, didn’t seem to be upset that Draco was the one who brought them victory.
-Exactly,-McGonagall smiled again,-I think the events of past year had taught us many lessons, but the biggest one, in my opinion, is how important it is to be united,-Harry heard someone groaning,-It is my decision to do my absolute best to stop the rivalry among Hogwarts Houses. And not a single professor disagreed to support it. So, our first step is to unite someone who had already been through way too much together. You.
