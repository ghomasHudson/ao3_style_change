“You said you had something important to speak to me about,” Draco reminded him, after silence that stretched for long moments.
“I know,” Harry said. “And you’re my family, too. But you have to take care of this one — the one with your parents. And I can live somewhere else while you do that.”
, breathing down my neck, watching me do it! I’m fixing this dump up! I’m trying not to go out of my fucking mind, Potter.”
“Of course it isn’t,” Malfoy said, shifting his weight from one foot to another. “It specifically mentions
It cheered Harry up to see and he reached forward, deliberately picking the one that Malfoy had graced with the full force of his glare. This seemed to startle Malfoy, who briefly looked up at Harry, and then transferred his glare to a different macaroon. Unable to stop himself from grinning at it (it was just so
Harry snorted. “That’s it exactly.” They were quiet for a moment, the conversation slipping away from them. Harry looked at his feet moving forward and noticed Malfoy had cuffed his trousers and wasn’t wearing any socks. He forced himself to look away and not ask about why he seemed to have a vendetta against both socks and shoes. To avoid blurting the question out, he heard himself say, “You know, if you want me to visit you could just ask.”
“Harry,” he said and then, turning red, “Happy Christmas.” Draco smiled, looking shy, and then something settled onto his face. He peered at Harry accusingly. “I didn’t know you were coming.”
The next time he visited the Malfoy’s, Malfoy himself was there, once more meeting Harry outside the front door. He stood there, watching Harry carefully, hair shining in the late summer sunlight, his arms crossed over his chest. Harry raised a hand in greeting. “Loved the bun, Malfoy,” he said brightly. Malfoy scowled. “It was great — Ron and I split it.” As he passed the other boy, Harry reached out to clap him on the shoulder.
this much. Harry’s embarrassment was warm and fresh, but the wave that swept through him this time was gratitude and love and a hundred other things that pushed the tide of embarrassment back. Before, when he was small and young and alone, he had never thought he would get this: somebody who cared about him like Ron clearly did. Harry had to take a breath before he spoke.
Suddenly, Draco looked shifty. It was amazing how quickly that happened, how quickly his expression shifted from prim and proper to sly and shifty. Barely anything changed but Harry saw it nonetheless. “Yes.”
“I don’t need you to pretend that you care about my father, Potter,” Malfoy said, more to the fire than to Harry. “It’s insulting to both of us and, although I usually enjoy insulting you, I’m feeling too tired for it today.”
,” Harry said immediately, picking up the nearest thing to throw at Ron that he could. Thankfully, it was a spoon and Ron easily ducked out of the way, laughing uproariously. Harry’s laughter joined his moments later.
Malfoy’s mouth twisted into a shape that Harry couldn’t comprehend and he leaned backwards in his chair, tipping it onto its back legs. “I heard that you never regret something if you follow your heart.”
It never went any further. Harry decided he didn’t mind even when he followed Malfoy’s lips every time he pulled back, even when he arched into him, even when his hands slipped below Malfoy’s shirt and he found skin only for the two of them to break apart shortly after. It was fine. They would need to talk about it to make it go any further and Harry decided
Harry buried both hands in his hair and took a few quick steps away from Malfoy. “Why? Why can’t you figure it out on your own? You’re not stupid.”
“Not really.” Harry couldn’t remember what the point had been, other than they could go anywhere they wanted now and Hermione had been pretending not to cry all that morning as she looked at pictures of her parents. Harry had suggested Oxford, but it was only because they had been on University Challenge the night before. “The eavesdropping mostly happened by accident.”
Harry let himself fall back into the rhythm, question, answer, trying not to look at Malfoy more than he had to. It went on for longer than Narcissa’s had — much longer, actually, but he supposed the mark on Malfoy’s arm had to do with that. When Harry finally stood, dismissed by the Wizengamot, he could have demolished another one of Ron’s sandwiches. As he slunk bank into his seat, he lifted his head to look at Malfoy.
“Potter, if you are going to embarrass me, I would really rather you left and did it in a letter. I don’t want to — I’d rather not look you in the face.” Malfoy was clearly very serious about it. He hadn’t looked at Harry and was instead staring straight ahead. There was colour high on his cheeks and the back of his neck was red. Harry watched it avidly and then he reached out, gently touching Malfoy’s shoulder. He started and then looked at Harry. His eyes were huge.
“I’m thinking of having two breakfasts.” Harry pointed at the fridge. “There’s bacon in there. It’s calling my name.”
“Hermione thought it would be nice,” Ron said. He did not really need to but it made Harry smile anyway, especially when Hermione quite clearly kicked him under the table. The wince made it funnier.
“Ah, yes.” Malfoy nodded. “All of my misdeeds up until this point have been so clever and untraceable. They’ll be shocked at this break with tradition.”
“If you talked to her again in a couple of days, she might change her mind,” Ron said. “We always used to say that about her. She’s always thought she knew what was right straight away.”
A silence settled on the kitchen which was only broken by the sound of water boiling. Hermione and Ron looked at each other. Hermione’s face looked tight and Ron’s eyes fluttered closed for a moment.
George was unpredictable. Harry had arrived at the Weasley home one night three weeks ago, slightly merry from after dinner wine, Ron leaning into his side and George had been in the garden, methodically destroying furniture. Ron had gripped Harry’s arm so hard he had been afraid a bone might snap and they had stood watching for a minute before Harry pulled him forward and they stood, one either side of George, as he finished blowing up a wardrobe.
“Some of us have to read the news, because we aren’t the news,” Malfoy said with a sniff, tone haughty.
Harry stared down at it in surprise and then laughed for so long that there were tears in his eyes and Ron emerged from his depression nap to see what was going on. They demolished the cupcake together after rustling up a camera and taking a photograph.
Malfoy looked sad. “No. No, of course not.” He sighed and then pushed himself off from the sink, taking a long step and coming to a stop in front of Harry. Malfoy held his gaze as he first pushed his shirt sleeves up and then rested a hand on Harry’s hip. His voice was low and secretive as he said, “I think very well of you, Potter, and I had thought that was abundantly clear. I can only gather it was not, for which I can only apologise. You’ve clearly felt comfortable enough to be
Tilting his head backwards, he looked up into the sky. Clouds were spread all over, light grey and hazy. The sun had burnt off some of them, letting blue peek through, and it didn’t look like it was going to rain. He glanced over at Draco and said, “Let’s fly.”
Harry hesitated for only a few moments on the lane and then squared his shoulders, walking forward with purpose. The Manor looked different than the first few times he had come. He could see the work that the Malfoy’s were putting into it. The garden was tamer, although he supposed it was winter and therefore easier to tame. Windows that had been broken were mended, curtains were pulled back. Harry’s gaze caught on the warm glow in some of them and a smile flickered across his face.
Harry turned his face away and looked at Narcissa as the door closed behind Malfoy. “Um,” he said, and then nothing else came to mind.
Suddenly Harry felt as if he had to defend himself. Malfoy didn’t know the half of it. He didn’t know about Harry’s life, or what his friends were doing, or how he was coping. He didn’t know that the last few years had felt like hurtling forward at breakneck speed, barely hanging on, barely getting time to breathe and Harry wanted to enjoy the now but wasn’t sure how. He didn’t know anything at all.
His hair hadn’t changed much, though the length had — it was still black and thick and irrepressible, always deciding what it wanted to do and just going for it. There was no real hope in taming it but Hermione had gently told him a few things he probably needed to do with his hair because “you’re just going to ruin it, if you carry on like that.” His hair curled more now and it was longer than he’d worn it when he was younger — and it was in significantly better shape than it had been last year. His eyes were still his mother’s, green and bright. Harry thought they looked sadder than they used to but they no longer looked as haunted. He no longer looked at his face and saw the nights of interrupted sleep or the days spent walking around like he was a shadow of himself. His skin wasn’t as pale, the bags under his eyes weren’t as noticeable. He could look at his reflection and see someone who could survive this.
When the music ended, Harry almost wasn’t ready. It startled him and he blinked several times. There was suddenly tension in Draco’s body that he couldn’t hide: there wasn’t a hope of it when Harry was leaning so close to him and breathing the same air. Harry lifted his hand and placed his palm, spread, on the small of Draco’s back.
Harry laughed then nodded solemnly, as Hermione dug her elbow into Ron’s ribs. “I completely understand. I’ll even let you break my glasses, if you want.”
He did not like Narcissa Malfoy. It wasn’t as if they were friends. Sometimes, Harry still looked at her and felt cold and alone, remembering the shock of air when he woke up from King’s Cross. He usually left after, feeling shaky and walked around the estate before he let himself back into Hermione’s house. Sometimes, he barely talked to Narcissa, sitting in near silence as they drank tea, exchanged mild pleasantries and, on one occasion, let Narcissa read aloud from the book she had been reading. It had been about the DMLE, an account from an infamous Auror who worked in the department from the 1870s to the early 1930s, pioneering structural change.
Instead, Harry took another bite of his sandwich and listened to Ron tell Hermione that her new found knowledge of the Wizengamot was frightening. It went on for several minutes, gentle bickering which Harry half listened to as he finished his sandwich and then stole a drink from the bottle of water Ron had brought along.
“Nothing like — we’ve never really talked. It’s not our thing.” Harry shrugged, letting his shoulders stay up against the cold.
His first hint was, admittedly, huge. Harry stood at the front gates for nearly fifteen minutes before they opened and after his trudge up the lane, his heart thudding with a sadness Harry was ashamed of for not seeing Malfoy there, he was met by Blighter at the front door.
Malfoy opened his mouth then shut it. He repeated this several times and then scowled at Harry, as if angry that he would dare say that. He didn’t speak though, so Harry felt emboldened to carry on. “I think your dad sucked, but it’s okay to be upset that you don’t get to see someone you cared about. I’m not gonna tell you that you shouldn’t. Probably.”
“You’re damn right I am,” he said and leaned over the counter, tugging lightly at the end of one of Hermione’s braids. She looked up and her face brightened; Harry turned his head so he didn’t feel like some kind of awkward spy watching his friends kiss.
There was barely a delay in response. It made him think that Lavender must have been waiting for him because the door sprang open, even though she didn’t step forwards. “Why were you hesitating?” she asked, sharp and immediate.
“Really?” Harry asked, a smile crawling onto his face. “Because I thought you were thinking about demolishing that sandwich.”
The question sat uncomfortably in the air, the sharp tang of it invading Harry’s senses. It made his stomach turn but he couldn’t let Hermione know that. She’d been there for him so much; he was going to be there for her. Moving onto his knees properly, he shuffled closer to the fire and said, “You’re going to, Hermione. I promise. I bet you’ve already done more than you think you have, because you always downplay that, and I know you’re going to get them back.”
Harry tilted his head to the side. He turned his gaze away from Ginny and looked out at the Weasley's garden. The sun had long since set and it was dark now but he knew this garden, knew where everything was, knew what every shape was even if it was far off and barely discernible in the night. He squinted at his favourite tree in the distance and thought about it. “I think I’m getting there,” he said, finally. “I’m still not sure who that is all the time, but I’m getting closer to who I want to be.”
“Oh do I?” Malfoy sneered. He looked cruel and violent as death, an imposing figure against the looming shadows of the Manor. Harry wanted to touch him somehow, to calm him, to pull the Malfoy he had started to get to know out of the shadows and replace the one standing in front of him. “I couldn’t imagine why. My father should be here but he’s in jail. That could be something to do with it. My mother and I should be allowed to visit him but we
“I’m not a perv. You’re really picking this up wrong.” Draco shoved Harry back out of the shed into the day. “I’m going to keep the picture to gloat over.”
There was a pause, as if Ron seemed to realise that Harry was asking a proper question, that he wanted a real answer. His eyes were still not all the way open and sleep made his movements sluggish and slow as he shifted on the sofa. The pillows he had tucked around him moved. Ron yawned and then said, “Yeah sometimes. But it’s different than — whatever it is you’re asking for.”
It wasn’t enough that he had apologised in the courts. It wasn’t enough that he had thanked Harry, that he had made flippant remarks about his own stupidity, that he had kissed Harry breathless. It wasn’t enough for Harry to just wish that Malfoy was trying and it meant that he was. He needed him to say it to feel like he knew it. He wanted Malfoy to tell him that he was determined to keep changing. He wanted him to indicate that he cared about repentance, beyond the morose funk he’d fallen into at his father’s birthday.
“Master Malfoy is in the gardens, by the fourth greenhouse,” Blighter said and then disappeared with a crack.
“Not tonight. Maybe another time. It wasn’t that bad, it was just — it was just long.” Ron sighed and rolled his shoulders like he was working out a particularly bad knot. “It’s making me tired to think about it.”
“Of course, I’ll need to get started right away. I have rather put it off, at this point, and I would like some of the flowers to have bloomed before summer. Thankfully, we have some bulbs in the greenhouses that I can just replant but it will not be nearly enough.” Narcissa ran a hand over her hair, smoothing it down.
Harry stared at his bent back and then swallowed. He shrugged, even though Malfoy couldn’t see him. “Could you not just have said that?”
They turned towards him as one, a complete unit and Harry beamed at them. Hermione beamed back, her eyes wet and her voice hoarse as she said, “Hi, Harry.” She opened her arms and Harry hesitated for a moment and then he picked himself up, flying down the stairs and wrapping his arms around her. He pressed his face into her hair and felt his chest expand with how glad he was to see her back again, whole and here, if not completely joyful. Behind him, he heard a telltale sniff and then Ron was hugging both of them.
, Potter, you ask for so much.” Malfoy slammed the lid closed on the piano. Then he opened it and slammed it again. “Stop making me
“Of course it’s not,” Malfoy said. “You’ve saved the whole world again, everything else must pale in comparison.”
Ginny’s grin was quicksilver. “You’re the one who taught me all about that.” She stood quickly, almost bolting across the kitchen floor to him. She was much shorter than him and Harry liked that she had to lift herself up onto the tips of her toes to brush her mouth against his cheek. He liked that he could smell her perfume, citrus and sharp, twisting its way up into his senses. “I’ll be ten minutes.”
Harry had no answer to that question because then he would have to admit he had no idea what Malfoy was talking about, as he had not realised that was happening. Instead, he snapped his mouth shut, looking to one corner of the room. He studiously tried to avoid looking at the bed. It seemed weirdly intimate. “I didn’t know we were near your bedroom.”
“Of course not.” Narcissa kept pulling up weeds. “Do you think that he’s been rather not himself, as of late?”
“It definitely isn’t.” Harry wanted to hold Draco’s hand still. He reached out and did, linking their fingers together and ignoring the look on Draco’s face as he did. “Your mum wasn’t talking about you. Your mum loves you. She thinks the world of you.”
had changed him, Hogwarts had reshaped him, remade him. Getting to know Sirius and Remus, pulling the threads of his past out and exposing them to the light had made him into someone new. Harry had looked into Voldemort’s face and saw hate and knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that he wasn’t made for it. He
He clearly tried to say it like it didn’t hurt, an attempt at breeziness which fell pitifully and woefully short. Every word was clearly wrenched out of him: Draco looked lost, and young, and furious about it. Harry wanted to hold his hand.
Harry laughed. “Okay go right in then.” Yolanda trotted along beside him but when Harry nodded at her she took off, bounding across the grass. She headed straight for an area where Harry knew plenty of flowers had been blooming a few short months ago. Harry hoped she didn’t dig any of them up. “I thought it was — weird. I felt weird.”
Malfoy turned red and then grabbed for Harry, fisting his hand in Harry’s t-shirt and pulling him closer with a vicious tug. It was an awkward angle because Malfoy barely moved, turning from the waist only as their mouths met in a searing kiss. It was an awkward angle but Harry didn’t care, couldn’t care, as Malfoy kissed him so fiercely that it felt like he was stealing his breath. Harry pressed his fingers tight into Malfoy’s skin and then ducked down further, sliding his hands back into Malfoy’s hair.
“Shut up about that, Malfoy,” Harry said sharply, waving a dismissive hand. “I don’t care about that. We’re not talking about me. Yeah, she meant them but you’re an idiot if you think she meant
“Yeah, all right,” Ron said, after a minute. “I mean, my snogging buddy just left for the other side of the world and yours is only under house arrest.”
fuck off, Potter. As if I’d trust you to do this.” He shoved at Harry lightly but he was still laughing, head thrown back, the line of his throat exposed. Some of the colour reappeared in Draco’s cheeks. “You’re literally useless. I’ve never met anyone more useless than you.”
“Oi no, it’s got my name on it,” Ron said. He stood quickly, making his way over to the fridge. He was extravagantly careful with the appliances still, touching the fridge as if it could choose to attack at any moment. Harry and Hermione had once sworn they heard him ask it not to give him an electricity shock. He was slightly better now, but even through the sleep clinging to him Ron was tentative with the fridge. He was far less tentative with the frying pan, which he slammed down on the hob, eagerly slathering it in oil. Harry grinned at his back.
His first week flew in. Harry felt weariness tugging at him throughout, but he was just glad that he was enjoying it, glad that Patrick seemed to have taken a liking to him and had Harry in as many of his appointments as he could. They had gone out to a local farm only yesterday and when Harry landed home he had chattered Ron and Hermione’s ear off about. Then, he’d chattered Lavender’s ear off about it over breakfast. Once it reached eleven a.m. and it was late enough that it was probably acceptable to go to the Malfoy’s, Harry left to chatter their ear off about it.
“What’s the right way?” Harry reached into the shower and turned it on. Malfoy’s gaze flicked between the shower and Harry and the door.
Harry hated that he knew which one was the fourth greenhouse. He studied his reflection for another moment, wondering when he had become this person, and then he turned and tramped out onto the grounds. As he walked he had to keep reminding himself not to put his hands in his pockets and risk destroying the scones. As he walked, he tried not to dwell on Draco’s straight spine and the fact he had no idea what to say.
She was beautiful, her hair thick and shining and pulled high into a knot at the top of her head. She was laughing at something — a story Seamus had told her the night before when there had been a group pub night that Harry begged off, a thoroughly embellished story about his latest fiasco with the postwoman he had developed a gigantic crush on. The laughter brightened her face but there was something in the grim determination in her expression that made Harry’s heart ache.
This idea had been much better when Harry had come up with it. He realised that fact somewhere between when Malfoy started speaking and when he finished, probably around the exact moment that Harry felt his temper spike. He tried to take a breath and breathe through it — a technique that Hermione had been insisting would help for years — but it didn’t work. Instead, Harry felt himself focus on the irritation even more.
Draco’s expression was very haughty when he said, “You don’t pay an awful lot of attention to anything. You’ve a terrible attention span.” Harry loved it. The haughtier Draco looked the more taken aback he was. He knew that now.
Several days passed and Harry mostly ignored the papers. There was a steady stream of visitors, no matter where he was: Ron was a constant at Hermione’s house, the three of them sitting in the kitchen until Ron and Hermione would disappear upstairs and Harry would camp out in front of the TV, flicking through channels or trying to lose himself in some of the books around the house. The Weasley’s home was always bustling, too, but Harry found it odd being there and feeling their grief. It sat heavy on each member of the family and Fred’s hand on the clock had moved to
He was almost at the front door when it was flung open. Harry paused for barely a second, threw his shoulders back and walked closer.
He still emphatically did not understand either Malfoy, however Harry was becoming increasingly sure that he barely understood himself. Every time he apparated outside the manor without asking, he was surprised. Every time, he told himself he was going to consider it deeper, maybe engage in some self-reflection. Harry had not managed to do anything approaching it.
Ginny let out a bark of laughter which did not sound amused in the slightest. “I don’t think I ever will be a hundred percent sure, you know? I think a part of me still wants to stay here and look after everyone and spend time with you.”
“What?” Harry startled, staring between Hermione and Ron. Hermione just looked at him steadily but Ron flushed, his skin turning red. “Since when? What?”
He caught Malfoy’s eye at one point and saw them widen, shock passing over him, followed by a long, slow reddening of his face.
When he pulled back, Draco pressed a kiss to the tip of Harry’s nose and then his forehead. “You are intolerable, Potter,” he said and it sounded like something else.
Harry bounded down the stairs, humming to himself as he nearly skipped into the kitchen. It was early but the whole house was awake: Ron because he had to be for Auror training and Hermione because she ‘liked the routine’ and ‘preferred to get her work started in the morning.’ Harry said his good mornings as he walked past the kitchen table where Ron was shoving bacon into his mouth and Hermione already had her books spread around her. There was an open notepad at her elbow and a pen but she was sipping on her tea and talking with Ron.
Narcissa sighed. “Yes. Not my idea, of course.” She chose not to elaborate and Harry felt he couldn’t push. She lifted her wand and although Harry tracked the movement with his eyes she simply waved it and then set it back down again. To his curious look, she said, “I’m summoning both tea and my son. Nothing to worry about.”
“She’s right, Harry. If you need anything, we’ve got your back.” Ron took another sip of his drink. “But if I go home tomorrow and Ginny’s crying her heart out, you know I’m gonna have to come back here and beat you up.”
“Hi,” he said, greeting the receptionist with a smile. “My name’s Harry Potter. I’m here for an interview?”
Harry squeezed Hermione’s hand and tried to reassure her that everything was going to be okay and he was proud of himself too and proud of her and that it was really much too early to be crying. It took a few minutes: Hermione’s emotions seemed closer to the surface now than they had before. Harry supposed that was what happened when your parents didn’t remember you properly, when months of spellwork had brought back only brief memories that seemed to scare them. Hermione had taken a few weeks to fill Ron and Harry in on everything that had happened when she was in Australia but Harry already knew he would never forget the tone of voice that she has used, the fear and the self-loathing bubbling under her words. He had tried to wrest it away and he knew Ron had, had heard some murmured conversations that he had pointedly tried not to listen to. It had left Hermione raw and a little overexposed; she cried easily now.
It only took a moment of remembrance before Harry sprang to action. He couldn’t leave, not with things as they were, not without checking in. He shrugged on the jacket and started to wind his way through the Manor, checking every hiding place of Draco’s he had ever come across. He started with his bedroom, sure that it wouldn’t unveil itself for him and startled when it did. The door sprang into existence in front of Harry and Harry stared at it for a minute, his mouth open. The wood twinkled at him and Harry tried not to search for meaning in its shine.
Harry nodded. He didn’t think to speak. He didn’t think he needed to, considering that Narcissa was barely looking at him. She held the muffin in her hand as she stood, excusing herself. Harry was left in the library, staring at the assortment of scones and the half-full cups of tea. He tried to grasp what had happened, how quickly everything had changed — less than ten minutes ago, the thought had been curling at the edges of his mind that he loved how warm the Malfoy’s library was, that he appreciated how it soothed a part of him he couldn’t give a name to.
Harry blinked in confusion and looked at Ron who just polished off the last of his bacon and said, “She’s right, Harry.”
Draco swallowed and then Harry watched a sneer appear. It looked tremulous, as if Draco was really digging deep to pull it up, but it appeared nonetheless. “Is this when you admit to me that you actually did lose it that time in fifth year?”
“Well I appreciate it,” Ginny said, her eyes twinkling, her smile illuminating her face. “I’m happier, too. It’s not because you’re not around me, either. It’s just because I’m doing what I want and I’m trying to be who I want to be.”
Harry’s mouth curled into a smile, almost a secret, tucked away at the edges. “Yeah. Yeah I think so too.”
Ron watched Harry with a considering look on his face, his gaze searching, before he finally nodded. “Yeah, all right. I’ve decided I’m gonna help you figure out what you like, anyway. This weekend. We can go and sort of try a bunch of things out.”
“I’ve been keeping myself busy,” he said, after a brief, awkward silence. “We had a lot of funerals and then, well, I’ve been visiting a lot.” Narcissa Malfoy did not need to know about depression afternoon maps either.
“Indubitably,” Ron said and Hermione wrinkled her nose. “He seems to have developed a glow as well, but for the love of God nor money, we mustn’t ask. The Harrificus Potterus animal can be both quite private and prone to oversharing.”
“I did think it would be easier. I wanted to talk to you.” Hermione reached out to grab his hand again. Harry let her. “We want you to be happy and healthy. Malfoy is — and was — a difficult choice. You know that, right?”
I don’t know how many invitations you receive that usually do that, Potter, but I would hope you had enough sense to refuse them.”
Malfoy startled and looked round, abashed. “Potter!” He looked accusingly at Harry. “You were visiting my mother.”
“After the after?” Harry laughed, shoving Ron out of the way to check the vegetables roasting in the oven. “That doesn’t make sense.”
“I didn’t say a word.” Malfoy looked pleased with himself, a small smile tucked away in the corner of his mouth. If Harry hadn’t been looking so closely, he doubted he would have seen it. He needed to look away.
“You wouldn’t complain if I shoved you to the ground, trust me.” It was out of Harry’s mouth before he thought about it. He snapped his mouth shut, colour creeping up his neck as embarrassment flooded him. Clearing his throat, Harry said, “Anyway, um. What I’m trying to get at is that I know you were trying to do something nice. I mean, I get that.”
“Malfoy, I can assure you I never once have acted thinking ‘boy I can’t wait for Malfoy to congratulate me.’”
“It is, isn’t it?” Harry said, instead of arguing. Then he moved forward slowly, as if pushing gently into a body of water. The cool air nipped at him. Malfoy’s coat whipped around them as the wind picked up. Harry’s mouth covered Malfoy’s and he kissed him, soft and gentle as a feather.
“Did you do it?” Harry asked, because it was a question he knew how to ask and it was easier than trying to pull apart what he really wanted to say.
Harry picked his head up from Draco’s shoulder and turned to look in his face, frowning, knowing he looked open and far too earnest. His eyes were shining. “I’m not trying to cow you, Draco,” he said seriously. “I’m not trying to guilt you either, not really. I’m just telling you that making yourself feel physically bad isn’t going to actually help you feel any better.”
It was a good question. Surely, that meant that Harry should have expected it, should have some answer prepared. When Malfoy turned to look at him, Harry found that every word seemed to evaporate immediately. His mind was empty, blank, his throat closed over. There were a hundred reasons that he was there and in the moment when Malfoy looked at him with huge, beseeching eyes, Harry couldn’t even think of one.
“Yes, Ms Crank,” he said and she smiled at him. “I believe it’s important for all of us to understand that people can do things — bad things, horrible things — but that doesn’t mean we’re purely that. I think we should be showing that people who stand up and do something because it’s the right thing to do and show that we can be brave should be rewarded for that. And I think that she did that and that she deserves my testimony.”
“Of course you do.” They were getting closer to the top of the lane where Malfoy usually disappeared through the front doors and down a hallway, leaving Harry to go upstairs to the study. This time, once they stopped inside the front door and removed their shoes, Malfoy very unsubtly crowded Harry, clearly leading him down one of the hallways. Harry did not debate whether he was going to follow; he just did it, natural as breathing.
but they had helped him and they had each other. Harry had thought very little of them but the sight had played on him for a long time afterwards. It was the love they had for each other. It had been bewildering to think about at first. Now, he was glad they had at least.
Harry was making his own pasta when Ron crashed through the door, muddy boots still on, a smudge of blood high on his cheekbone and a toothy grin on his face. Harry stopped kneading for a split second, blinking at him, and then started again. “Shoes off, mate.”
“We love you too,” Ron said. Harry opened his mouth to say something, found he couldn’t, and nodded instead.
“And then they moved the date,” Harry told Narcissa, spreading jam on another scone. It was his third. He shouldn’t have been eating it but he was anyway. The day had been long and miserable, the December cold biting into his bones. Harry hadn’t minded it so much because it gave him an excuse to run with the contingent of dogs he had amassed. Word had got out that “the nice Potter boy” would take any dog out for a walk and Harry had started to almost draft a rota for himself of Hermione’s neighbourhood dogs that would fall into his care for a couple of hours every day. He thought it was good for him: he would run and run, letting the dogs chase him, chasing the dogs, letting himself be lost in the motions and blending into the landscape wherever he took them. It calmed him, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t sometimes freezing. He enjoyed leaving them home and arriving at the Malfoy’s, red in the face from the winter wind, shivering slightly, knowing there were scones and tea awaiting him. Narcissa very rarely disappointed.
plain to see when he was told what was going to happen to him: probation. House arrest. A suspended sentence. Malfoy dropped his face into his hands, hair falling forward, and took several huge breaths. His shoulders didn’t shake but it looked like he was struggling not to cry. Harry averted his eyes.
“Probably not.” Harry popped some of the cupcake into his mouth. “They still had a house elf. I reckon he probably does most of it.” He couldn’t stop himself from remembering the gloom over the house, the thick vegetation and overgrowth in the garden. The curtains he had noticed from the lane. “I guess it’s probably a bit much for him. The place didn’t look well looked after.”
Harry didn’t know if Draco would expect him. They had danced around the subject of Christmas, gesturing towards it but never fully landing. Harry had watched Draco’s eyes shadow, his lips turn thin whenever it came up. He didn’t need to ask to know that it probably wouldn’t be a very happy Christmas. He didn’t need to ask to know that the last one had been miserable. He remembered his too, although he was doing his best to create a fence around it, a partition between the now and then which he carefully tended to.
The gates sprung open, as usual, and Harry stared at them. He stood there, staring, for a long time, trying to regulate his breathing, trying to remind himself what it was to feel normal. He knew part of what Ginny had said was the truth, but that didn’t make it the whole truth. He wanted her: he just didn’t know how to live as someone who wanted people, who could have them, touch them and taste them and take them. He’d never got to do that before, not properly, not without the stark and certain knowledge that Voldemort was going to appear again.
“I’m a shocking kind of person,” Malfoy said grandly. They lapsed into silence when Malfoy finally broke when he said, looking at Harry now, “All right, Potter.”
Malfoy held up a hand and shook his head. “Potter, if I am going to do this without insulting you greviously then you need to not say such ridiculous things in front of me. Obviously you are having a crisis. I cannot think of any other reason why you are here or why you have been here. You broke up with your girlfriend, you’re consorting with Death Eaters in a house that you no doubt have horrific memories of, and you’re currently seeking career advice from one. That spells crisis. I’ll give you that it’s an unorthodox spelling but I’m fairly sure it’s in a dictionary somewhere.” Malfoy finally lowered his hand. He looked pale and tired and very certain. “You know what you want to do and you’re overthinking it. So why don’t you just do what your heart tells you and stop talking about it? Your voice is getting on my nerves.”
“Oh, right. Right.” Ron looked thoughtful and then he smiled. “You did ask us if we thought you could be a Healer before. You could be an animal one. I think you’d have a better bedside manner then.”
Harry blinked at her. He thought about being smart and telling Narcissa he hadn’t heard a question in anything she said and then thought better of it. He was trying to be polite. “Curious how?”
“Oh,” Harry said again, but it was different this time. He thought he got it now. He ran his thumb up Draco’s and moved closer to him, chasing his body heat. Pressing a kiss to the hinge of Draco’s jaw he said, “I think you’ve got a great life ahead of you. I’m really proud of you.”
The greenhouse came into view. Draco’s spine was still straight, somehow, even though he was carefully watering the plants inside. His shoulders were high and tense and Harry stood and stared at him for a moment before he walked forwards.
Malfoy tilted his head to the side and studied him. “What is our thing then? I try to be nice to you and you run away?”
Malfoy’s face fell, twisting into something as hard as stone. He looked away from Harry, scowling into the back of his armchair. “Of course I’m going to see him again; that’s not the issue. The issue is I’m always just going to be
Conversation flowed and ebbed and, finally, once her plate was cleared, Hermione said, “Harry, do you know what you’re doing with Malfoy?”
Ginny looked at Harry and smiled and Harry looked at her and grinned and they were normal and happy and healthy. They talked and tried to push away awkwardness. Harry still tried to hang back and it was fairly late on before Ginny cornered him as he made his way back from the bathroom.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, trying for airy and sounding oddly stiff. “I suppose I did.” Silence sat between them again, sharp as a thorn Harry found himself reluctant to prick himself on. Malfoy did not have the same compunctions. After a minute, he sighed. “Potter, if you tell someone you’re debating your future it’s only polite to share how. Are you weighing up the pros and cons of tell-alls to each publication? My advice is to go for the one which pays the most.”
“I don’t wanna.” Malfoy sounded like a child, a high-pitched whine in his voice, the uncharacteristic word choice making Harry grin. Harry would have bet he was pouting.
“Harry, it’s lovely to see you again.” Narcissa set the book aside, gesturing for Harry to take a seat. He sank into the sofa gratefully and a moment later a cup of tea, merrily steaming, was in front of him. He grinned at it.
As Harry had suspected, Ron did love the cupcakes. Not only did he love them, he professed a deep infatuation with them. His favourite was the mint and pistachio one which he shoved into his face with such fervour that it was almost admirable. Harry stood, shoulder-to-shoulder with Hermione, watching the proceedings with a kind of rapt fascination he suspected they should have divulged of long ago when it came to Ron and his appetite.
Draco spoke to his mother in a low voice. As Harry approached the door, he could see that he was sitting on the ground at Narcissa’s feet. She had chosen the armchair closest to the fire and every now and again she ran a hand through her son’s hair. They were lit up by the glow of the fire and Harry stood for a moment, watching them and thinking how picturesque they looked. He could scarcely believe that he could see this now, that things had changed so much in a few months that this brought him joy but it did. He looked for the people who he had once known and he knew they were: brash or harsh, snotty and rude, bigots who clung to an ideal until it nearly destroyed them. He could see them, but over everything he could see the people he had begun to know.
“I’m not boring, Malfoy. There’s just a lot that needs to be figured out first and it’s not smart to rush into things.”
Draco opened his mouth to speak and then sighed. He dragged his tongue across his lips, nervously wetting the lower one and Harry watched it. He wanted to kiss him but his ears were ringing and his heart was pounding and he needed to hear it. Draco breathed out again and it was practically into Harry’s mouth. He tightened his fingers in his hair.
Narcissa frowned and then said, “We’ll see.” She didn’t really sound like she believed him. In fact, her shoulders looked straight and determined and she was clearly thinking deeply about something. Harry had never had a mother, so he wasn’t sure what she was thinking but he had the distinct feeling that there was no way on earth that Narcissa was ever going to think she didn’t need to protect Draco. That wasn’t something she was prepared to accept.
Harry laughed so hard it hurt and shoved him backwards, nearly toppling him over. “I’m the one out running with dogs every day while you stir your potions, dickhead,” Harry said. “You’re just sore you can’t beat me.”
“That’s one way to put it, I guess,” Harry said, shoving the rest of a macaroon in his mouth. Narcissa inclined her head. “I haven’t really minded coming for tea.”
“Has Malfoy dosed you with something maybe?” Ron asked that night, dumping a lot of pasta into a pot of boiling water. He considered the pot and then added more.
Harry thought about lying. He didn’t think that Narcissa needed to know what had happened yesterday or the strange note that he had received. He didn’t think that Narcissa needed to know every single thing that Draco had said to him that ever worried him. He could keep Draco’s secrets but there was a tightness to Narcissa’s face and her concern about her son was evident. Harry knew just how much she loved him.
Hermione laughed; it sounded tired. “I miss you too. I wouldn’t — I wish I could come home.” Her voice sounded small, lost, girlish and young in a way that Harry hated to hear. It reminded him too much of nights spent in a tent. It reminded him too much of death.
Harry pushed his hand into Yolanda’s fur for comfort and raised his hand in a wave. Malfoy stared back, his arms folded over his chest. Harry thought he must have been cold. The air had a very pronounced chill and the grass around them still had morning frost clinging to it. Harry could feel the ice in the air even through his thick Weasley jumper and all Malfoy had on him was a shirt and a pair of wool trousers. He stood still, looking as pale and remote as an ice statue. Harry looked for any thawing as he got closer.
“I don’t,” Harry started and then stopped. His heart was beating in his chest, a hard, steady drumbeat. It felt punishing. He swallowed again and tried to speak once more. “I don’t want to tell you what I want you to do. I want to know what you want to do.”
The meeting had been requested a few days before, the invitation coming with an owl that had woken Harry up from what Hermione had taken to calling his “depression afternoon nap.” She said it with a twist of her mouth, a laugh that almost crawled out of her but didn’t quite. He had briefly wondered if it was a criticism but ultimately brushed the uncharitable thought away. She called Ron’s naps the same and had excused herself for one more than one.
“All right, Potter. Then, yeah, let’s say I’ve changed. Let’s say I’m different and somehow better. Are you happy?” There was something gleaming in Malfoy’s eyes that made Harry feel dangerous.
“Why don’t you sit, Harry?” Narcissa asked. She didn’t move, which Harry was glad for because then it meant he didn’t have to sit beside her. Instead, he chose the sofa facing hers and sat down, not quite sinking back into the plush cushions. They looked at each other, neither of them speaking at first, before Narcissa started to smile. “I wanted to thank you again.”
Narcissa cut a glance back at him and then nodded. “Yes, that makes sense.” She cleared her throat. “They’re beautiful flowers. They don’t take up too much room, either; roses are extremely prone to spreading and they loathe too much competition.” She continued to talk for a while as Harry stood there, pointing out different plants that hadn’t flowered yet, discussing how she also intended to incorporate lavender and what that helped repel. Harry tilted his head and listened and asked questions, nodding all the while. He had never hated herbology but it had never been where he shone, though he wasn’t sure if gardening was the same thing. All he knew was that this was clearly a passion of Narcissa’s — her face changed when she spoke, grew brighter, less troubled. She didn’t look like the woman who had asked him to visit her before her son’s trial. That person seemed like a distant memory.
“Right,” said Harry, business-like. “Up. Come on, Malfoy. Bed. Up.” He herded Malfoy like a sheepdog, finally depositing him on top of the bed where he sprawled on his stomach, starfishing. Harry looked fondly at him and then turned to call Blighter. Once he had given a very rambling, rather tipsy, but probably fairly clear run down of things he thought Malfoy would want Blighter to know, Harry had to borrow an owl.
Harry had left soon after.  Malfoy had still been asleep and when he had quietly cast a spell to see what time it was he knew that there was no hope Malfoy would be up soon. It wasn’t even eight when Harry padded carefully down the corridors heading to the front door. It wasn’t even eight when he rounded a corner and Narcissa was walking towards him.
Malfoy looked away and then started to walk, picking up his pace. His legs were longer than Harry’s but Harry had been friends with Ron for long enough that he caught up fairly quickly. “We have visitors coming out of our ears. Stop talking to me now. I liked you better when you were brooding.”
There was an exhale and Draco turned onto his side, still holding onto Harry’s hand. “Did you get it?” he asked, voice low.
Instantly, Draco turned bright red. It was like looking at Ron. He stood up fast and cleared his throat. “I have to go to the bathroom.”
It tugged desperately in his chest but Harry had other things to say. His hand went to Draco’s chest, palm flat against it and he shoved him lightly. He was careful to do it away from the cauldrons. Harry might not know that much about potions but he wasn’t
It delighted him now, making his heart both sing and clench. He remembered how jealously he had watched the Malfoy’s clinging to each other after the battle: they had been on the wrong side, they had been in the
Harry nodded, humming a little in the back of his throat. He knew he wasn’t stupid, no matter what the niggling voice in the back of his head said. He wasn’t stupid but he was definitely better at practical work, at seeing things done and then replicating them. Staring at books when he wasn’t sure what half the words meant wasn’t going to help Hermione.
Draco shifted just slightly but never missed a beat. Harry watched his fingers move up and down the keys of the piano, fascinated as always and slowly, ever so slowly, rested his head against Draco’s shoulder. He heard his intake of breath, quick and sharp, but Draco kept playing.
Draco’s eyes were bright. “That shows how little you know me, Potter,” he said, his voice a murmur. “I don’t want that at all.”
“Draco is,” Malfoy said, still sounding incredibly sour. It was mingled with disbelief, as if he couldn’t quite grasp that this was his life as he headed towards the door. Harry watched his back again, struck once more by how thin he was and how weird it was to see Malfoy barefoot, sauntering around in a shirt so large it kind of made him look like a pirate.
It was only part way through his first day that Harry realised he had never had a first day on the job before. No matter what had come before — the DA, or the Order, or finding Horcuxes — none of it had been actual, gainful adult employment. He tried not to let the thought throw him for a loop as the receptionist, whose name was Betty, helped him fill in some forms and showed him how the appointment system worked. “Just in case,” she had said. “We all pitch in around here as much as we can!”
Although Harry felt his explanation was perfectly sound, Malfoy very obviously and violently disagreed. He made a noise of disgust, glared at Harry and then turned as if he was going to stalk down the stairs. At the last moment, he appeared to think better of it and twirled back around. Harry noticed the shirt billowed out around him. It really was very piratey.
The sense of calm that descended over Harry after he made his decision lasted until he told other people about it. Hermione asked him over and over again a litany of questions, composed of the liturgy: was he sure? Did he want to take some extra time? Did he want to make another list? She was quick to stress that she supported him, but she just wanted him to be
Harry was afraid of his grin, afraid of the giddy burst in his chest. He was afraid of how quickly it had come, how thoroughly it chased away what had come before. He laced their fingers together and then brought Malfoy’s hand to his mouth, brushing his lips against his knuckles. Malfoy stared at him, eyes bright with reverence and Harry smiled. “Okay.”
“I don’t think it’s particularly odd to dislike someone but think they don’t deserve life in Azkaban, if that’s what you mean.” Harry stared at the prosecutor again, his tone hard when he spoke.
The sound that escaped Malfoy was somewhere between a laugh and a sob. He looked disgusted for a moment as he pressed a hand over his mouth, fingers clawed as if he could force the noise back inside his body. “You’re a genius. Harry Potter, world renowned scholar.”
Harry blinked at Malfoy several times, thoughts clambering over each other, every nasty one digging in deeper. He took a breath. He took another breath. “I need you to be honest with me,” he said, instead of shouting. His voice was loud, though. He knew he sort of sounded like he was shouting. Harry couldn’t help it. “That’s what I’m asking you for.”
Malfoy sighed into it and rested his hands on Harry’s hips. Harry smiled into his mouth and kissed him again.
He wanted to but instead he found himself sitting at a slightly dusty kitchen table, a bottle of newly opened firewhiskey calling his name. Ginny poured the measures, as blessedly heavy-handed as her brothers had taught her to be, making sure they were always evenly matched. Harry kept his hands wrapped around the glass, watching her as she flung back her latest shot.
She turned on her heel and said, “Come in then, Harry.” Harry obeyed, following her into the house, kicking his shoes off at the door.
“Nah,” Harry said, feeling warm. “I’ve not done a single thing stupid lately. You don’t get to duck out of this one. I’m telling you off.”
He sat and listened whenever Draco talked and tried to help. Draco had regular deliveries of ingredients and, now that Narcissa was allowed out, she brought him back more. Harry had started to bring the ones that made Draco anxious and twitchy, ingredients that some of the apothecaries flinched at selling to someone with the name ‘Malfoy.’
The laughter carried on for long enough that Harry had time to sip at his own drink as Ginny regained her composure, face almost as red as her hair, dashing tears of laughter out of her eyes. “I’m so sorry,” she gasped out. “It was just your
Harry shrugged. “It’s fine, honestly. I mostly just want to be as happy as you looked talking about it, you know? I don’t think I’d be that happy where you are, so it’s best for both of us.”
Malfoy stared at him and then laughed, a gentle exhale of air. He turned and started to walk. Harry had no idea why he followed. “Potter, in case you haven’t noticed, or in case my mother failed to share it with you, we don’t actually have visitors falling out of the sky. People do not want to come here. I have exactly zero interest in becoming your confidante but for the love of Merlin you could at least provide a prisoner with some kind of conversation. You grunted at me last week. Grunted! It was an affront to all of society.” Malfoy’s words got faster as he walked and he matched his pace to his conversation. Harry determinedly kept up, following down a corridor he had never seen before. They reached a door, large and heavy, a gleaming dark walnut. Malfoy flung it open and they were in a garden.
“It’s Tesco. It’s not important.” He wanted to wave one hand dismissively and started to, only to realise it was squashed under his thigh. Instead, he half-shrugged and tried not to think about how ridiculous it probably looked. “I think that this’ll all be way more comfortable for both of us if we don’t have to keep talking about gratitude, though.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “It is obvious.” He didn’t say anything else for a long moment, instead staring straight into Draco’s face, clocking every change in his expression. He did look better, much more rested. The bags under his eyes were still there but Harry suspected it would take more than one night’s sleep to eradicate them. His hair was neat and he had clearly taken great care in choosing his outfit. Harry smiled into his face.
“Don’t call me that.” Hermione elbowed him lightly in the ribs and Ron pretended it hurt more than it did. Harry beamed at them as he watched the way Ron pressed a kiss to the top of Hermione’s head and how she pulled him towards the kitchen table. He didn’t go back to singing but he hummed as he cracked eggs into the shakshouka and waited for them to cook, keeping a careful eye.
“You seem upset.” Malfoy spoke haltingly. “When I was — upset that time. With my father’s birthday. I was very grateful to you afterward, because you were there and you did the right thing and you didn’t seem to think twice about it. You just knew what to say and you did it. You were just there. I regret getting absolutely blottered and throwing up everywhere, but I don’t regret spending the time with you and I think that maybe you would regret it if I — if
“So am I.” Harry moved closer, brushing past Draco, looking at the rows of plants that he had been watering. He couldn’t remember what they were called. He wished he could, so he could say something funny, or clever, or interesting about them. Sometimes Harry didn’t feel very funny, or clever, or interesting. Sometimes he wished he could say what he wanted to Draco and have it be the right thing. He turned his chin to look at him, studying his profile for a moment.
all this, but the only thing you’re doing is visiting Malfoy Manor every other fucking day and drinking with me. That’s not a life, Harry.”
“It didn’t backfire. I appreciated it.” Harry traced Malfoy’s profile with his eyes. He reminded himself of how he’d felt after he’d ran out on Malfoy and thrown himself into everyday minutiae. He thought about how his stomach had twisted every time he thought about Malfoy waking up alone, about Narcissa telling him how Harry had left, the shame that had crept in every time Harry dwelled too long on it. Maybe he didn’t know what they were doing, but he knew he should be better than that. “I’m not very good at talking to people about things. I’m not very good at talking to
Something twisted, sharp and biting, in Harry’s chest. He leaned forward, elbows on his thighs, eyes bright and earnest as he said, “Malfoy, if you tell me something and I think it sounds believable, I’ll probably believe it.”
“I’m here because of your letter and it’s delusional if you think it wasn’t an invitation.” Harry enjoyed the glare Malfoy shot him. “And I’m here because, like I said, I’m contemplating my future and it’s actually not that fun.”
Narcissa’s mouth quirked upwards, just barely. “Yes. Draco’s emotional control is not the best at the moment.” Feeling extremely kind, Harry decided not to tell her that Malfoy very rarely seemed in control. He nodded instead, which he felt was the perfect neutral response. “I don’t suppose he would mind terribly if you would talk to him. I heard him talking to one of the ghosts the other day and it upset me greatly.”
Fourteen had been perfect. Harry had even laughed to himself a little as he sent the owl off and then had to immediately stop because it made him feel a bit like a supervillain. Honestly, it also seemed like less of a laughing matter when he was faced with the very real prospect of making conversation for the next hour at least.
“Good.” Draco stopped tracing lines on Harry’s palm and instead moved his fingers up, curling them through Harry’s. He stared down at their joined hands and Harry stared at him.
Malfoy’s head snapped round. “I’ve become very good at applying myself to things, Potter,” he said, harshly, as if Harry had said anything to the contrary. “It rather depends on occasion, but I could be a lazy child and I don’t believe that’s who I am anymore.”
There was a heavy silence that swept through the library instantly, a wall of ice appearing between mother and son. Harry looked at Narcissa and then Draco, whose face had gone completely still. Stillness was, perhaps, the worst thing when it came from Draco.
Draco had screamed and punched him in the arm. Harry had turned and laughed in his face and kissed him and then ran away, still laughing.
“Oh yeah?” Harry grinned at her, ignoring the tension within his chest. “That’s great. I know you weren’t sure.”
The fire caught on the pale hue of Draco’s hair, masking it and turning it almost orange. From his position, Harry could see that he was slightly red in the face and Harry remembered that they had taken the charm off to prevent people feeling the heat of the fire. He watched Draco for a moment, barely noticing the rise and fall of his conversation with Narcissa. Instead, he just watched him.
As one, Harry and Hermione turned to him and Hermione reached out. Ron came to her instantly, confusion on his face. She pulled him down and folded him into their hug and said, with wonder, “My parents remember who I
“It’s not a dirty word, Harry,” Draco said. “It isn’t. There’s always power, no matter what. People always want it, or have it, or they don’t. It’s in every interaction we ever have.”
It was strange moving himself out of Hermione’s home. He had thought about it as his home for so long that stripping the room of his belongings made something kick in his ribs. There was a moment, as he packed his photographs away, when Harry felt so breathless he had to sit down and bend forward, forcing himself to breathe. Panic gripped him, the unbidden thought ripping through him that he was never going to get somewhere he belonged. That this was going to be his life forever, darting between people’s spare rooms, never making a home he could stay in for very long.
Malfoy was making a potion the next time Harry stopped by — or, rather, he was probably making a potion because he was in the kitchen and a cauldron was bubbling but he was soundly ignoring it and was scribbling on some parchment. Harry hovered in the doorway, watching Malfoy. He had a jumper on over his shirt and both were pushed up, almost to his elbows. He chewed on the end of a quill every now and again, the feather bedraggled from how often he had done it. Harry watched Malfoy move the quill around and then back to his mouth, entranced, and then he cleared his throat.
Harry thought about it so much he ended up writing to Lavender Brown, the only person he knew who had seriously expressed a desire to work with animals. It struck him as he sent the letter that he hadn’t really seen her since the incident, as people called it. When she wrote back, she invited him for lunch and Harry went, nervous and hating that he was.
Catching up to Draco, Harry fell into step beside him and said, “Please don’t tell me more about how you’re gonna wank over me when you’re like a hundred. It’s making me a bit ill, you creepy old perv.”
“I am.” Hermione shot him a watery smile and then held up what was in her hands, a letter that looked crumpled. “My parents sent me a letter.”
“No, no.” Harry crossed his arms over his chest. “It’s important for me to say it, so will you listen?” Ron nodded but Harry barely looked at him before he barrelled on. “I love you, you know that? And I’d love to just do stuff with you forever, like I’ve always dreamed about working with you even though I would have point blank refused to get business cards. And for years and years I thought that it was going to be us against the world, yeah? Like, we were going to grow up and become grizzled old Auror partners together, with a long list of stories that we could break out and people would be so awed and impressed and, more than that, we’d be able to say that we had fun and did good and always had each other’s backs. That’s what I wanted. A part of me still kinda wants it, but it’s not all I want, you know? And if Ginny thinks I’m stuck — and I don’t think she’s wrong, I’m just saying if she thinks I’m stuck then maybe I am. And maybe I feel a bit stuck. And maybe I feel like the only way to not be stuck is to do something that I want now, not that I wanted before. I’m not the same person I was a couple of years ago. I’m not even the same person I was a couple of months ago and I don’t really want to be an Auror anymore, but I would do it in a heartbeat for you if that’s what you want me to do.”
If he could survive Voldemort, he could survive an interview. He could impress people. He had probably done it before, sometimes even intentionally. Harry looked for signs of nervousness and then tried not to. It would make him worse.
“You’re such a pushover,” Ron said. It was clear he was saying it just to talk. He shook his head and then the two of them were walking down the corridor, heading to the courtroom as it was called. “I can’t believe you’ve no backbone.”
can say that, can’t you? Of course you can say that! You don’t know! You don’t know!” He had turned into a flurry of motion again, flinging his body around the kitchen. There were so many cauldrons set up now that it probably put any Hogwarts potions class to shame. They bubbled away, a merry chorus underscoring just how desperate and frantic Draco looked. He wove through the cauldrons, staring at all of them with a pained look on his face. Harry stepped forward, dropping the shopping bag onto the table.
“You like a good hump……...day, do you?” Ginny squealed out, between brays of laughter. Her whole body was shaking and Harry had to prise his fingers away from his eyes to watch her. It was almost impressive the way Ginny could just keep laughing, how she never seemed to run out of air. Harry pushed his hands through his hair and tried to pretend he wasn’t going beetroot red, even when Ginny pointed it out gleefully.
She made a noise, though, and he turned his face towards her. He didn’t know what he had expected to see but the firm determination on it startled him. It reminded Harry of all of her best moments and she squeezed his hand again, sitting straight as she said, firm as if settling the matter, “Well, if it’s for you, it’s a different matter altogether. But drink up, because I think I’ll need to get a bit smashed to appreciate it.”
“I’ve been thinking about trying to tidy this place a bit,” Malfoy said, cutting into the silence. He sounded dreamy. “I never really liked gardening. I didn’t have the patience for it and it was always Mother’s forte, but she doesn’t always love to come out here now. I would hesitate to tell you why.”
A smile spread across Harry’s face, slow as treacle and just as sickly sweet. “But, Malfoy,” he said, innocently, “I’ve already caught you out. You’re practically purple with annoyance.”
On Christmas Eve, Harry stumbled back from his dog walking shift laden with treats. His backpack, which was usually filled with water bottles and snacks and dog treats, had been charmed by Hermione to expand. Even though he had seen the charm in action before, it didn’t prevent the wonder that seized him when he saw just how much he could shove into it: panettone, gingerbread biscuits, mulled wine, Christmas cake, various cookies and biscuits and scones, tubes of Pringles and bags of fancy crisps and some alcohol too. Harry had done his best to give them back but Christmas cheer seemed effulgent. Joan Harrison, one of his favourites, had pinched his cheek, ruffled his hair and shooed him away with a loud, “Don’t be at that now. Bugger off and have a marvellous Christmas, Harry dear.”
Nostrils flaring, Draco turned on his heel and started to stomp across the grass towards the shed where the brooms were kept. Harry laughed at his back.
Malfoy snorted, lifting his mug to his mouth carefully and slowly before setting it down. “All right, Potter. You have twenty minutes exactly.” He nodded at Blighter, standing in the corner, and the house elf clicked his fingers. Numbers materialised into the air and started counting the seconds back from twenty minutes. Harry stared at it, surprised, for a full five seconds before Malfoy said, “You’re wasting time.”
“That’s not fair. A couple weeks ago it hadn’t even been Hallowe’en yet, so my grumbling was entirely justified.”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “For God’s sake.” He wanted to throw his hands into the air and he would have done if he didn’t catch the expression on Malfoy’s face, a quicksilver flash of amusement that told him that no matter
“I’ve been thinking about the future,” he said finally, “and then I remembered you used to talk all the time about wanting to work with animals. And I think I want to. And I remember how much you used to love it, so I thought maybe you’d be able to — help me out? That sounds a bit selfish.”
“I’m in for an interview at the animal Healer’s I was telling you about.” Harry crunched his way through more of the cereal. “See how it goes and if I like it I might apply to start learning, you know. In the autumn.”
“Do you want to stay for dinner?” Draco asked later, his hair brushed again, clothes straightened. He asked it casually, but his shoulders were stiff. He didn’t look at Harry, instead staring down at whatever he was writing.
They sat like that for a moment, both breathing harshly, the sound mingling. Harry shifted to wrap his arm back around Draco’s neck and pressed his forehead back against Draco’s. He knew he was breathing, but he barely felt like he was. He knew he still had a body because he could see it, but he barely felt it. He felt buoyant. He felt like smoothing one hand (the cleaner one, naturally) through Draco’s hair so he did.
Harry squinted at Malfoy, wondering how he had possibly forgotten how loud he could get. Malfoy had been barely a part of his last year and, before that, sixth year had marked such a change in the other boy. He supposed it had been a while since he had had to listen to a Malfoy tirade and he’d somehow forgotten how chaotically bizarre he could be. Harry raised a hand to massage his temples; Malfoy looked extremely affronted.
“Narcissa Malfoy.” Harry heard the disgusted noise that Ginny made, although he barely registered it outside of noise as he looked down at the paper. It wasn’t a long letter — in fact, he wasn’t sure it could even be called a letter.
“She’s right, mate.” Ron nodded, looking proudly at Hermione. “And even though it’ll be funny as anything if you keep going back to bother him, you know that means you have to actually be there, right?” The more he spoke, the less proud Ron looked. Instead, his expression looked like a mixture of amused and concerned, clearly not sure which emotion he should let triumph.
Draco’s face was so pointed that it was easy for shadows to appear. They chased each other across his face now. “I did not see the point of remaining there much longer. Dry yourself, Potter, you look like one of your dogs.”
Draco rolled his eyes. He glared at Harry and then glared down at his notes in front of him. “Dares don’t work on everyone, Harry. We’re not all children or Gryffindors or Gryffindors who are
When they separated, they were both panting. Harry’s mouth was kiss-slick and Draco’s hair had been ruined. He stared at him and then said, “Your mother is literally in her rose garden around the corner.”
Harry, who rarely got to see Draco shy, smiled at him. “We can figure it out,” he said, watching the light of his eyes, the way the sunlight slithered into the manor, how bright it made everything look. “We have time. Me and you have got a lot of time.”
He looked at Blighter and smiled at the same time Narcissa said, “That will be all, Blighter, thank you.”
Malfoy exhaled, the kind of breath which let tension leave his body. Harry watched his shoulders with interest as Malfoy rolled them. “Brilliant. That’s perfect. Now, if you could agree to stop visiting just to annoy me that would be wonderful. I think it makes my mother sad.”
“Habit,” he murmured, when she gave him a look. She shrugged and then disappeared into one of the rooms: Harry followed her. It was a living room. He couldn’t tell if it was small or if it was just so filled with
like that’s the case, Potter, when you keep doing it. I loathe this conversation. I loathe everything you’re saying.”
“Can we talk?” she asked, tilting her head up to look at Harry. Harry blinked down and then nodded, following Ginny as she walked out the back door.
,” Malfoy stood, raising a hand to tug at his hair. It looked like a painful motion; it looked like he wanted to pull the hair out at the root. Harry resisted the urge to go to him. “You should know this, Potter. You said — I
The next day was miserable and filled with Ron’s impression of Harry stumbling down the lane of Malfoy Manor and tripping over his own feet several times. Harry groaned and blushed and tried to drown everything he didn’t like by eating bacon and drinking several gallons of water.
Instead, he pressed open the door, clearing his throat as an announcement of his presence. It didn’t matter, because Draco wasn’t there. He wasn’t in the kitchen, or the piano room. He wasn’t in the second library or the guest parlour, or the small alcove Harry knew exclusively because sometimes Draco dragged him into it, pressing kisses along his jaw, his throat, his sternum, and lately his hips. Harry lingered there for a moment, feeling strangely bereft at standing there without Draco, and then moved on.
Malfoy was silent for a moment. Harry hated the silence. He twisted in it, chafed at it, thought desperately about disturbing it again and then Malfoy said, “That was surprisingly astute of you, Potter.”
Harry smiled, small, mischievous and unrepentant. He shrugged. “I’m talking about talking. Trying to be better at it. Thought I should maybe be a bit more forthcoming.”
For some reason it annoyed Harry. He looked away from them, watching the house elf as he covered the table in front of them with cups and an assortment of refreshments. There were cupcakes and macaroons and small sandwiches. There were some kind of cream buns that Harry didn’t know the name of and cherry bakewells and a few croissants. There was much more food than three people would need.
“Because you’re having some kind of crisis, clearly.” Malfoy said it as plainly as he would have told Harry the time. Harry hated that. He hated that Malfoy could spit out words that held such heft and it didn’t seem to shake him or take a piece of him at all. He hated that Malfoy seemed to have somehow resigned himself to his own seismic shift and therefore gave little consideration to Harry’s. He hated that he even thought like that, like a part of him wanted Malfoy to be more concerned about
He even went back to Grimmauld Place, trying to ignore the clenching of his stomach every time. If it hurt, it hurt but that didn’t mean it wasn’t necessary. Harry had stood in the doorway of the house every time, told himself that it was going to be worth it and then entered. Kreacher was always delighted, Walburga was always less so, and bit by bit Harry was trying to make the house less stomach-churningly depressing. Sometimes, someone else would help him.
“Well that makes sense,” Draco said slowly, “seeing as you are an animal yourself.” He looked inordinately pleased with himself, slanting a sly, amused look at Harry. Harry smiled back at him and elbowed him in the ribs.
Harry felt his curiosity tug at him. He took a step forward and Blighter rushed forward himself, hand up, as if he could stop Harry in mid-air. “Mr Potter, it is a bad time. I do not believe Master Draco or Mistress Narcissa would be happy to entertain  guests at this present moment.”
“Oh, Harry!” Hermione cried, flinging out her hand to reach for his. Harry let her pull it towards him. “Oh, I’m so sorry.”
There wasn’t a pause in the music. It kept going, although Harry saw Draco look up from under his eyelashes, watched him realise who he had invaded his space. Draco didn’t acknowledge him. He just kept playing, a song that Harry didn’t know himself but one which he had heard Draco hum many times. Harry walked across the room and lowered himself onto the piano bench beside Draco.
“I think you’re right,” Narcissa said, nodding her head in agreement. She shifted slightly and Harry thought it was to look more comfortable. “We can put some of it to rest then. Though I’m afraid I did instruct Blighter to prepare the gratitude cupcakes.”
Hermione nodded and said goodbye as Harry grabbed his jacket and apparated to the gates of Malfoy Manor.
Scowling darkly at Malfoy, Harry nonetheless stepped forward. The gates barely waited for him to pass before they slammed closed, coming so close to his arm it felt like a reprimand. Harry looked at Malfoy for a moment and then started to walk up the lane. Malfoy wavered behind him for a moment before catching up, matching his steps to Harry’s.
Harry lifted a shoulder. “No, I think he’s mostly fine with it. Ron’s a good guy — and if you disagree with me, I will throw this mug at you, so.”
When they asked Malfoy to confirm his name, if he understood why he was there, if he intended to be truthful, he spoke in short, clipped sentences. His voice sounded different to Harry and it made him look round at his friends, catching each of their eyes. Hermione was frowning deeply enough it cut a new line in between her eyebrows and Ron had her hand in his as he stared straight ahead. He turned to look at Harry and his face looked grim and set.
While he disappeared to get the coat, Harry sank down onto his hunkers and petted Yolanda. He muttered to her, telling her that he didn’t believe she’d jump on Malfoy unless he specifically told her to. She seemed to like it, preening under his attention, coaxing a laugh out of him as she rubbed her head against him over and over. Harry stopped laughing when Malfoy’s shadow passed over them. He squinted up at Malfoy and then stood.
“I think I’m going to have tea. With your mother. I wrote to her a couple of days ago.” Harry tried to continue on but Malfoy had come to a stop just in front of him. His eyes were flashing, grey and hard as stone. His face was slightly pink but Harry couldn’t have said whether it was from the shouting or the run down the lane. Harry regarded him for a moment and then moved to go past him; Malfoy moved directly into his path.
“No.” Draco hesitated and then pulled back. His grip on Harry was still tight, his face disconcertingly open. Harry didn’t know what that meant. “Nothing about you makes me sick.”
Harry turned his head to look at Malfoy, so he saw the way Malfoy’s eyes glittered when he spoke. “I don’t know, Potter, but you deliberately ignored my request to stay away, so I figure I’ll return the favour and ignore everything you say.”
“Hi,” he said. Draco jumped and spun. Water sprayed out, splashing Harry’s chest, before Draco ended the spell. He looked flustered and surprised, pink faintly rising up his neck.
Harry stood up so fast that he nearly knocked the pot off the ring. He turned to look at Ron with a gaping mouth. “Ron!”
Hermione laughed, nose scrunching up as she watched Ron eat. “That’s what you say to everything that involves food.”
ugly emotions threatening to press in. He took his own deep, shuddering breath and tightened his grip on Ginny’s hand. Leveraging himself out of the chair, he sat in front of Ginny, on his knees at her feet, and lifted one hand to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear.
Harry nodded and dropped his hand, stepping back. Draco took a deep breath and his chest rose and fell with it. He stared at Harry looking furious, but Harry decided not to take it too personally.
, half-wild, half-tamed, stretching everywhere around the estate. As autumn swept in, they had become brighter; the cool, sharp winds rustling the trees and shrubbery, gracing the land with its own quilt of brightly coloured leaves. Several of the plants had died and Harry had noticed that greenhouses had sprang up, carefully reinforced with charms. Malfoy’s sentence, Harry had learned, meant that he was allowed to do very little magic and that every time he used it his wand logged a spell with his probation officer. Malfoy, who had admitted that it rankled, therefore did as few spells as he could manage to. Harry knew that he must have thought the gardens worth it.
Malfoy was breathing hard, lingering close enough to the rest of the candlesticks that Harry suspected they could become a missive again. He didn’t appear to have noticed them however, instead staring straight ahead, looking at Harry with a hunted expression. Harry lifted his hands, palms out, and walked closer.
“Of course not!” Hermione looked genuinely shocked at the suggestion. “It has to be personal. This is all about you. I already know what I’m doing and I found making lists infinitely helpful. There’s something soothing about it.”
It did not look like Ginny much wanted to cry when they were finally alone again. She lay on her bed, feet kicked up and resting against the baseboard, apparently fully unconcerned that her shorts were muddy and would undoubtedly transfer onto the sheets. Ginny had moved the clothes off the armchair when Harry entered the room and he sat in it, twisting towards the bed so he could watch her. His elbow was propped on the arm of the chair, his chin resting in the palm of his hand. Harry traced Ginny’s profile over and over and waited for her to speak. It looked like she wanted to — she kept shooting him looks out of the corner of her eye, biting and then releasing her lip.
Harry looked at her and then nodded. While Ron finished preparing his breakfast and then as he wolfed it down, they drew up a list — the offer from McGonagall for private tutoring, or to return to Hogwarts if he wished. The offer from Kingsley, backed by Head Auror Robards, to join the DMLE. The offers he had received everywhere he turned, owls pouring in and people clasping his hands and telling him that they’d be honoured if he would join their training programme/fine establishment. Some of them Hermione frankly refused to put down. She looked particularly stern as she scored out “Tattoo artist” after Harry scribbled it.
Malfoy smiled. He looked over at Harry, the dance of the flames in the grate reflected in his face. Harry watched the warmth of it light Malfoy up. “That’s a bizarre reason to not like someone.”
“Sure, of course not,” Malfoy said, softly. “I don’t really — maybe you’re not wrong.” He looked sheepish as he said it, like he hated admitting Harry was right. “I can’t think of any way I could have been clearer and you weren’t getting it.”
“Well just in case you wanted to spend it with Malfoy or whatever.” Ron pulled a face but it disappeared quickly, chased away by the fond smile he kept giving Hermione even when she wasn’t looking at him.
because we’re under house arrest. My mother can go in a few months at least, which is great for her, but I can’t go until
Swallowing down crumbs, Harry said, “Also, it was something to do.” Unfortunately, it sounded completely sincere but then he supposed it was sincere. Visiting
Harry looked down and assessed the damage. Mud ran up his legs. His t-shirt was still wet, both from the run and from Yolanda shaking her coat off in front of him. He was wearing shorts, even though it was the end of October and they were covered in muck. There was even dirt on his biceps. Harry blinked in surprise. “I didn’t realise it was so bad.”
Harry stared at her, unsure of what to say. He wasn’t good at this stuff. Being reassuring had never come naturally to him, not when there was a tangle of ugly emotions underneath, not when he could feel his
Malfoy lifted his hands and cupped his own face, fingers clawing at the tops of his cheekbones. He still looked wild and desperate, but the cruelty had leached from his face slightly. “Put your hands down, you look ridiculous,” he snapped. “I can’t bear you.”
Harry laughed and grinned and took Draco into his mouth as deeply as he could. When Draco gasped, something thrummed through Harry that he couldn’t name.
“That’s what it looked like to me.” Malfoy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me if you’re brooding, Potter, but if you want it to have it’s full impact, shall I call the
“Harry,” Harry interrupted. It was the third time. “Please don’t call me Mr Potter. I really mean it; I’m not just saying it to be polite or anything.”
It must have been good enough for Ron because he just nodded and they returned to silent observers until Harry was called. Malfoy’s gaze was a weight on his back as he headed towards the witness box; Harry pretended not to notice how heavy it was as he took his seat and the questioning began.
Malfoy was lying on the bed, a book on his lap. He looked up as Harry stood in the doorway of the en suite, towel in hand. Harry felt unbearably awkward and Malfoy looked tired. They regarded each other.
“It’s very nice, Harry,” she said, glancing at biscuit tin Harry had sat down, the wine, the panettone. An expression he didn’t quite understand played across her face and then she ran a hand over the top of Draco’s head before standing. “I have a letter that I need to send. I’ll be back later. Rather a bit later, I must admit; it will be a long letter..”
Grinning, Harry nipped lightly at Malfoy’s collarbone. At some point, he’d opened Malfoy’s shirt and he moved back, one thumb brushing lightly against a nipple. Malfoy hissed in a breath and Harry grinned, dragging the other hand down, letting it dance over Malfoy’s stomach, touch feather light. Malfoy was somehow both panting and barely breathing, his chest rising and falling, his eyes glued to Harry.
Laughter escaped Draco’s mouth and it sounded more like a gurgle. He pulled his hair. “I’m losing my mind!”
“I’m not hungry. I was thinking. You might want to try it a time or two.” Harry turned his back to start the kettle boiling; when he turned around again Malfoy had tugged the sleeves of his jumper back down to his wrists. Harry looked at him and Malfoy stared back, face only slightly flushed, meeting his gaze straight on. “Potter, for the love of Merlin, can we please skip lengthy discussions today? I’m very busy.”
Harry shifted in his seat, suddenly uncomfortable. He was keenly aware of how much Narcissa loved her son and, as he stared into the surface of his tea, he realised ‘I decided to do it to wind your son up’ wasn’t going to go over too well with her. Glancing up, he cleared his throat. “I thought it would be nice.”
Everything Harry could think of to say sounded stupid even within the confines of his head (“I didn’t know you had a bedroom”) so he chose, instead, to reach for the glass in Malfoy’s hand and take it, throwing back the whiskey. When he tilted his chin down again, Malfoy was watching him with glittering eyes.
He looked away to maintain that it was a casual offer, a normal thing that he could or would have done at any time. Malfoy’s eyes were hot on the side of  Harry’s face, but Harry kept methodically chopping and did not look at him.
Narcissa blinked at him, ice itself, and inclined her head. Harry stared at her and reached for Draco as he passed by, fingers open. He didn’t grab for his hand. He didn’t know what stopped him but he couldn’t make himself and his fingers brushed ineffectually against the side of Draco’s hip. Harry thought his movements stuttered for a moment but it could have been his imagination because he was out of the library before Harry could collect himself to speak again.
Harry was cut short by Malfoy stopping abruptly and throwing open a door. It was too dramatic an entrance and Harry cringed away, even as Malfoy strode into the room. Compared to the rest of the manor, the room seemed practically pleasant. It was clearly a study of some kind and it gave the impression of caging them in with books. The bookcases were mammoth, stretching from ceiling to floor, and crowded. There were not only books on them, but decorations – a huge globe, several jewellery boxes, and candlesticks interspersed the collection. There were portraits at the head of the room and a large desk in one corner whose surface was covered in neat piles of books and papers. The middle of the room was dominated by something Harry
She smiled slightly as she looked at him, the kind of hidden smile he never would have noticed if he hadn’t spent so much time with her. Her eyebrows were drawn up. “Of course they moved the date, Harry,” she said, sipping at her tea.
“I’m going to tell you about my job now,” Harry announced. “You’re going to be blown away by how clever I am.”
Harry couldn’t decide how affronted he was so sat, scowling, until Malfoy deposited a mug in front of him. He looked at his mug which was perfect — strong enough for him and, when he sipped it, sweet enough too. He looked over at Malfoy, who was slowly sipping from a much milkier cup of tea. Malfoy was watching him carefully.
“Should’ve got more,” Ron said, sagely. He did not take another bite right away, but instead looked at the cupcake in his hand. “D’you reckon if my parents had been mad and followed some bizarre megalomaniac that we would have had cupcakes like this?” He sounded wistful and dreamy.
“Please stop talking so dirty, Potter, these portraits can’t bear it.” Malfoy turned a beaming look onto some of the paintings around them, mostly filled with old Malfoy relatives. For the most part, they looked supremely unconcerned with the conversation happening around them. The only one paying attention was a man, mostly bald and very large, wearing a pink coat, surrounded by hounds.
“You want to testify for Narcissa Malfoy?” Perpetua Crank asked, the large floppy hat on her head moving with every word. Harry glanced at it and thought back to what Hermione had told him about her during her long treatise on every Wizengamot member he would need to know.
Ron sighed and muttered, “Wish you wouldn’t.” There was no real heat in it, though, and as he pushed himself up, gently ensuring he didn’t kick the mug on the coffee table, Harry felt a huge surge of affection. They had all spent weeks and months since the war had ended talking and trying and swearing they would be better for each other, for themselves, for the world. Ron was one of the best people Harry knew, even when he yawned so widely his jaw clicked, even when he lifted the mug of hot chocolate and drank the rest down in one gulp even though it was bound to be disgustingly cold.
Immediately, Hermione reached out, wrapping her hand over his and squeezing it. “That’s not what I meant,” she said sharply. “Of course it’s weird, though. You know it’s weird. But we know you and we trust you and Malfoy’s wrote to each of us quite a bit, actually.”
When it was done, he brought it over to the table and dished up everyone’s breakfast, setting the leftovers carefully to the side before he took a seat again.
“I think we should eat maybe,” he said, running his thumb over her pulse point. He felt it jump and smiled. “If we keep this up, we’re going to be smashed before lunch time.”
The memory of the evening burned bright in Harry’s mind. He thought about it, trying to recreate the tears of laughter gathering in Dean’s eyes, or how hard his ribs had hurt with the force of his own cackling. He thought about Ginny, tossing her hair and slamming her body back against the seat as she scream-laughed, and used the joy on each of his friend’s faces to try and chase back the memory of Voldemort’s.
Ron kept studying him. “You don’t have to, though. Not if you don’t want to, or if you think she’s right.”
“No,” Harry said finally. “He doesn’t bother me. I mean, he bothers me all the time but not like that. I think I know what I’m doing.”
Pulling himself together, he ran a comb through his hair and then pulled on an outfit that seemed very appropriate before leaving the house. It was a late February morning and the month was dying off. It brought with it a shift in the air, a brightness to the sun. As Harry walked past gardens he could see them trying to repair themselves after the winter. The breeze brushed against the trees, ruffling the leaves. It felt like they were whispering at him.
Draco laughed and said, “I’m always blown away by you.” He instantly blushed and added, “Not by your cleverness, as you really are daft.”
either!” Malfoy stopped then, coming to a halt at the top of a flight of stairs. He looked down them, apparently considering something himself, before he turned. His face was flushed. “Why did you come here, Potter?”
Harry was stuck on wondering whether she was sympathising or making a veiled comment about how horrible house arrest was when there was a loud crack outside the study and then the doors opened. Malfoy was standing just behind Blighter, obviously a house elf, slouching against a wall and looking very bored. As Blighter walked in, he straightened and came into the room after him.
It was strange, Harry thought, how much the war changed people. He remembered Lavender differently — he remembered her as being high strung, fanciful, doting. He could easily picture her, still, wrapped around Ron, calling him pet names and beaming girlishly and giddily at everything. He hadn’t been in school for the last year and he wondered how much she had changed or if this person had always been there. The thought occurred to him that maybe Lavender had always been blunt and to the point and he had just brushed it aside because it didn’t fit with how he thought of her. It shamed him and Harry looked at her for a long moment.
Once they were seated, it couldn’t have been more than ten minutes before Draco Malfoy was brought into the court. Harry sat beside Ron, deliberately only looking forward. He could feel heavy stares and an artist appeared to be drawing pictures in the corner: he told himself that it didn’t matter if a portrait of him ended up in the morning paper. What mattered was that Malfoy was being led out, looking thinner than the last time Harry had seen him and somehow taller. Always pale, he looked even whiter, a shade off a ghost as he was led to his seat by his guards. Malfoy barely looked around him, but he didn’t look nervous. He looked quiet, private, too tired to be haughty.
It was a hungry kiss, all teeth at first and then they were pulling at each other, hands grasping. Draco bit at his bottom lip and demanded entry; Harry yielded and laughed into his mouth. “Shut up, Potter,” he growled, hands hard on Harry’s hips as he pulled him forward. Harry couldn’t respond because he was too busy tumbling into a kiss he wanted to live in.
He supposed they were. Malfoy certainly seemed to view them as precious; it was clear from the light in his eyes, the way he swept his gaze across them. They were quiet as they walked down the pathway, Malfoy letting his fingers drag slightly in hip height bushes. There had been blackberries glinting from them just a few months ago and they had picked them off as they passed, eating them as they walked. Harry missed it. He thought maybe Malfoy did too.
“I mustn’t admit anything,” Harry interrupted. A ripple started to go through the crowd. “I think you’re trying to get me to say that I would only be here if, somehow, someone had forced me into it and that’s not the case. I didn’t like Malf – Draco Malfoy. That doesn’t mean that I think that he was running happily through fields of murder. I think he had a terrible choice and he chose wrongly, but I don’t know that there were a lot of options left. I wouldn’t call him brave, but he refused to identify me when we were captured and standing in front of Voldemort, which does require a great deal of bravery. There have been better men that have crumbled in similar situations and it could have backfired on him pretty badly, to be honest. I do not think that he’s a saint and I’m not blinkered or under any kind of spell. I’m telling you what happened. You can choose to interpret that how you want, I suppose, but it’s my understanding of events which is what you’ve asked for.”
Narcissa Malfoy sat across from Harry, her hands clasped loosely in front of her, her long fingers twitching occasionally as if she wanted to fidget. Harry had been unable to stop focusing on it since he’d noticed: the way her hand spasmed every few minutes, as if she wanted to tap her nails against the table or play with the cup in front of her. She never did, always catching herself and quieting the impulse.
Moving out of Hermione’s house didn’t mean she didn’t want him there. Moving out of the temporary stopping place that had been his home didn’t negate that he had lived there and been loved there and tried to repair himself there.
Harry looked down at himself. He had dressed quickly, with little regard to what he was wearing. It hadn’t occurred to him that it would matter: they were only the Malfoy’s and Harry didn’t care about impressing either of them. His t-shirt had been lifted from the end of his bed, an eye-searingly bright yellow with a huge pelican in baby blue across the chest, something he had picked up at a gig Hermone and he had gone to. It was hideous but he had loved it. Harry shrugged. “I thought it would brighten up your day.”
“What if I like a good hump day?” Harry asked. There was a beat and then he screwed up his face, holding up a hand. “Don’t. Don’t. I heard it.”
Harry did not keep going back to the trials. It seemed unnecessary after he testified and if he wanted to learn anything else, all he had to do was read a paper. The coverage was relentless, if tucked behind a few human interest stories — Neville took a trip to buy some new gloves and the paper talked about the size of his hands for a frankly ridiculous amount of time. Seamus had insisted everyone meet at the pub and read the article aloud, swooning and carrying on, pretending to fall at Neville’s feet until he’d turned red as a tomato.
It sounded ridiculous, even in his own head. Harry did not understand it. He stared at the blades of grass, squinting at them to make every one stand out in his vision, and then lifted his head. “I think the fact she said you aren’t getting on is what makes her sad.”
“I’m not gonna get her a tea towel! I just — what if Mum wanted this one?” Ron reached out and lifted one of the towels. There was a trim of holly around the outside and the fabric was charmed to show a snowy winter scene, children pushing a sled down a hill and then trekking to the top, over and over. It was very festive and the children were redheads.
It was chilly but not particularly cold. Harry felt the wind hit his cheeks and knew he would be red-cheeked, but he didn’t feel the need for any sort of warming charm. There was something about the winter air that made him feel alive. Ginny dropped down to sit on the steps leading down from the back door and Harry followed her a minute afterwards.
When Harry wandered into Hermione’s kitchen that night after his run, it was to find her carefully filling a pencil case with stationary. He greeted her before downing two glasses of water and then turned to her, a considering light in his eyes.
“Of course she’s not right!” Hermione interrupted. She glanced between Ron and Harry, pulling away one of her hands from clasping Harry’s to gesture. “You told me that you were excited to get back together!”
Harry tilted his head and studied Malfoy for a moment. Malfoy was still avoiding his gaze. Harry didn’t really think he deserved that, but then he didn’t really know how Malfoy felt. He took a breath and a leap and covered Malfoy’s hand with his. Immediately, the remaining tension in Malfoy’s shoulders disappeared. “Maybe you can just answer my questions straightforwardly?” Harry suggested, with a smile.
Harry sighed again and put his head in his hands. He thought about not doing it for a brief second, aware that it was dramatic, but it was half past eight, he had been up forever, his girlfriend had broken up with him, he had no idea what he was doing and his sleep had been punctuated with nightmares so bad he’d woken with a scream lodged in his throat. He felt entitled to a moment of drama.
Malfoy squinted at him, confusion in the shape of his mouth which was chased away a moment later as he started to laugh.
seemed so lost and now look at you! You’ve got plans! You know what you might want to do!” Hermione started to cry and then she flung herself out of her chair, wrapping her arms around Harry’s neck and pulling him into a hug that was made slightly awkward by the fact he was still sitting and still holding his bowl of cereal.
Harry had known that Narcissa had been confined to her home, a house arrest issued as she awaited trial. Her husband and son hadn’t fared as well, remanded into custody and instructed to wait. Harry mostly tried not to think about it: he hadn’t had time to sort out what he felt, or why, or what any of it meant. Instead, he’d bounced among appearances, among families, and into bed, clinging to the occasional afternoon nap. He glanced at Narcissa and wondered if she was taking naps.
“Oh.” Harry could feel himself blush. He cleared his throat and said, “Right. Let’s crack on, then, shall we?”
Malfoy stroked the soft skin on Harry’s hip once more and let out a shuddering breath. “Don’t rush yourself.” He stepped back, nodded at Harry and left the bathroom.
Chuckling weakly, Ginny drew away from him. She covered her face with both hands and shook her head a few times. Harry, unsure what to do, sat backwards. He watched Ginny and wished that this whole conversation was over. He wished that the ugly spike of resentment trying to make its way through him would go away. Ginny had done enough and deserved to get what she wanted; he just had to trust her.
Harry had nodded, muttering “Of course, mate,” and Ron had made a choked sound and dragged George into a hug. Harry had stepped back to let them cry in peace.
Hermione and Ron stayed behind too, lingering in the courtroom doorway as Harry made his way to Narcissa.
“I wouldn’t have,” Draco said, churlishly. “I was — it’s not important. The important thing is that I know she loves me, but I — I let her down a lot. Because I wanted something stupid.”
“I think it’s been hard for him,” he said carefully, hunkering down. He started to pull up weeds beside Narcissa. “Obviously it’s been hard for him but now that you can go out, too, I think it’s harder. I think he feels stuck.”
Lavender blinked in surprise. She moved and the scarf moved down. Harry barely saw the glimpse of ruined skin and then she was fixing it with quick fingers. “You want my advice?”
She blinked at him and nodded, stumbling over her words. “Of course! I know who you are! Um, can you take a seat? I can — do you want water? Coffee? Tea?”
Both Narcissa and Harry turned to look at Malfoy. Harry saw his surprise mirrored in Narcissa’s face before she hid most of it away. In contract, he was completely unable to hide his own shock, his mouth falling open as he blinked continuously at Malfoy. Malfoy looked at him for a second, a muscle in his jaw twitching, before he made eye contact with his mother again. Narcissa and Malfoy kept staring at each other for what felt like an eternity while Harry stood and tried to stop himself from gaping like a fish.
“Christ.” Harry massaged his temples. This time, he opted not to tell Malfoy that his dramatics gave Harry a headache but he filed it away to mention later. “Do you really think that’s what’s going to happen to the world? You think you’re just going to finish your house arrest and stay here forever?”
Harry bit back his first retort and then his second, trying to will away any urge to hit Malfoy, yell at him, or chuck the cup of tea around him. He thought about doing it for a blissful moment and then said, like someone who was trying to be a grown up, “Malfoy, it’d be nice if you weren’t a prick for like twenty minutes.”
For some reason, that made Harry smile. He felt his mouth curling upwards and then he laughed, a soft exhale as he nodded. Malfoy looked at him oddly. “I loathe it too. That’s what I’m trying to say. I get — I get self-conscious. I don’t ever know what I’m supposed to say. Not just with you, but also it seems to happen a lot with you.”
