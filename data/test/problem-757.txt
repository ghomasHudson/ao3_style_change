Draco always blushes when he wants to ask something sexual but is embarrassed about it. Harry absolutely loves that blush. Harry pulls Draco close and makes him sit on Harry's lap. He then caresses Draco's cheek and Draco leans into the touch, closes his eyes and gives a content sigh. Harry kisses his forehead and cheeks then asks him again.
"I'll tell Teddy though when he'll be big enough to understand this."
Yeah. Don't underestimate him.
"Then we definitely shouldn't be with each other like this." Draco closes his eyes.
"He looked like he was going to come here, drag you up and eat you." Astoria said.
"I figured you'd say that." Harry said and then proceeded to take a wooden box out of his court he was wearing.
Draco's POV
"No you don't" Harry cut Hermione. "You both have had a good childhood. Loved by your families. You both didn't live in a house where you are hated, neglected and abused. You can only know but you can't understand and you definitely can't relate or feel what we went through. I didn't get raped but I was abused as well. Beaten, starved, neglected. You don't understand and you never will. So don't pretend that you do."
He can feel Draco's spent cock twitch in his fist. No doubt, the effect of his praises. Draco always was a sucker for praises. He looks at Draco, his mouth parted, revealing the knickers in his mouth and his cheeks flushed. His hair falling all over his face, he looks gorgeous, so Harry tells him so. The reaction can immediately be felt in his fist and Harry smiles. He increases the speed and Draco drops his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry can feel his fast breathing and the amout of power it takes Draco to not make a sound. Harry commends on it. The praises take their effect and soon Draco is fully erect.
Her blood runs cold. She desperately wishes she were a muggle, away from all of this. She wishes so many things. She wishes she were never caught by Lucius while working with Sirius. A secret that was well kept until she slipped and Lucius caught her. Caught her and her sister who was planning to run away with a muggle. Andromeda, who she loves much more than she loves herself. So she agreed to the contract, to keep Andromeda alive. Because he had managed to catch her, Andromeda and the muggle. He was just moments away from giving them to the dark lord after torturing them for several hours in front of her where she begged for their life. She begged her sister and the muggle to be set free which he did, but only after gaining her as his slave. Lady Malfoy. She scoffs at the title. That's all it is. A title. In real, she's nothing more than a slave. That's the price, paid by a 17 year old girl to a 19 year old boy and a 57 year old man, since forever.
"Stand up, love." Potter says and and Draco obeys.
"Potter, would you and your friends like to spend next weekend here? We all can get to know each other. You know, you, Granger, Weasley, She-Weasley, Luna, Longbottom?" Theo asked.
"Did You-Know-Who threaten your mother?"
When Harry entered the room, just as expected he doesn't see Malfoy. He frowns. He turns towards the washroom. The door is open which gives him a view of broken glass and tiles and he doesn't even knows what. He holds his breath and walks inside. He looks at Malfoy curled in a foetal position, blood dripping from his temple and his hand. His first thought is that someone came in here but the baseball bat Malfoy holds in his clutches like it's his lifeline suggests otherwise. He crouches down in front of Malfoy and threads his fingers through Malfoy's hair with slow caresses. Malfoy takes a deep breath, as if drawing strength from Harry. His eyes are open but he looks at the floor. Harry slowly coaxes the bat out of Malfoy's hands. He takes Malfoy's injured hand and slowly picks out the pieces of glasses. The ones he can't remove by hand, he removes with magic. He then slowly removes the tiny piece of glass from Malfoy's temple. He cleans the wounds and with some spell, he heals the wounds.
"Its just three days, Potter. I'll let you know if I need anything." Draco says for the fifth time.
"Lets go back." Harry said quietly and apparated them to hogsmade, where they walked to the castle.
"I'm here my love." Blaise came with alcohol.
- Bee
Harry picks up Draco's [Harry's] discarded t-shirt and uses it to wipe Draco's face. Draco gives a rough meow, his voice hoarse due to the throatfucking. Harry looks at Draco's erection and smirks. He climbs on the bed and sits facing Draco's erection. Draco gives an eager meow and Harry takes Draco's cock in his mouth. Draco gives a throaty moan. Harry sucks on his cock, eager to get Draco on the brink of an orgasm which doesn't take more than five minutes. Oh the whimpers and moans and the lewd noises Draco makes. Harry missed them so much. As soon as he feels Draco reach the edge, he stops and pulls out. Draco gives out a whine.
"But Harry, if we leave and you stay, it will still create doubts. If he has surveillance on us then he knows you'll are here. Taking Teddy away will put even the Weasleys in danger. It would be for the best if we stay here."
"Draco, are you sure? We haven't even been to a date yet." Harry asked.
Harry stands behind him and slowly presses his shoulders, giving him a gentle massage. Draco moans.
"Oh, sure you'll get your treat." Cormac removes a paper from his pocket and hands it to Millicent. "Premier tickets of that new Hugh Grant movie. Free popcorn. It starts at 8.30."
"Belle had to make sure she's not seen with anyone of your friends so no one knows she's working with you all. That is why she made Neville tell that the Room of Requirement was his idea. It was Draco's idea but Neville knew how to use the room well. Belle didn't even know that room existed before Draco told her." Blaise said.
How can Draco tell him? About his father, about his mother, about the war, about the death-eaters, about all those other men Lucius gave Draco away to.
"That guy barely managed to get his bones back. His parents won't let him put charges. They're terrified of Potter." Daphne for some reason thought Draco needs this information.
"That colour is ridiculous, McLaggen!" Millicent argues.
Draco's eyes widen. Shit. He can't go without showering. He looks at Potter who tells him to go. Draco dashes out in the bathroom to follow his morning routine but not without listening to Potter chuckling. This is the quickest shower he ever had. When he comes out, he notices that the room is like yesterday he never thrashed it. The only thing that's ruined is Potter's bed. He looks at Potter with huge sorry eyes which only makes Potter roll his eyes, but he's not smiling anymore. His face is stern.
"We've known this for years Harry." Hermione explains.
After 10 minutes of crying, I go to the washroom and fix myself. I come back to my room and open my trunk. I take out my Ancient Rune's books and some parchments. With that I take my diary out. I open to see if there's anything new. There are some messages.
"I know it's you behind the killings. I have a name for you that Draco wouldn't give." Harry sees Nott swallow.
I cried writing it. You better cry reading it.
"Draco is here?" Narcissa pretended to be shocked.
Whack. One slap straight to his cheek in such a force that Draco's head whips aside and his chair falls with him. Now there's that familiar burn he hasn't felt on his cheeks for about a year. And truth to be told, he didn't really miss it.
They all looked at each other and me nervously. I suddenly heard a voice from behind.
McGonagall is talking about evacuation when suddenly we all hear a voice. Voice of Voldemort himself asking us to give him potter. Shit no. This is it. I look at the Slytherins table. They look at me. My eyes are silently begging them not to do it. Please don't do it. Pansy looks at me, takes a deep breath, then looks at McGonagall.
Kingsley didn't reply.
Draco narrows his eyes.
"Maybe I like holding you down. Maybe I like having you like this." Harry replied and watched Draco's Adam's apple bob as he swallowed.
"I found out awful many things that year."
Draco thinks.
"Do I still belong to you?" He asks quietly.

"Harry!" Draco yells again and Harry runs to him. He climbs on the stand just as Draco falls down on the floor screaming. Harry pulls him in his arms, petting his hair, trying to make Draco breath.
Draco swallows again and takes a few moments to reply. "I won't ruin it." He says in a small voice
"And this one is a female." Ron says.
"I'm sorry you had to go through that." She said with her smile weak and eyes watery.
"Mr Malfoy. Mr Potter." He shakes our hand. "I'm here to talk about the will of Andromeda Black Tonks."
Draco wakes up with a gasp. He looks around and sees that it's still dark outside. He looks to his right, still laying down and looks at Potter. Potter's hold on his torso is tight as if he's afraid that Draco might disappear again. Draco smiles. He snuggles up closer to Potter and holds his firm and strong biscep. He feels Potter kiss his head and hold him tighter.
Harry removes Draco's blouse and the sweatpants and leads Draco to the bed only in grey lace knickers. He makes Draco lay on his stomach and places his hands above his head.

"You have no idea how long I've waited for this." Harry said as he let go of Draco's wrists. He held Draco's hip with one hand and stroked Draco's soft silver hair with other. His heart gave a jolt as Draco leaned into the touch. Harry gave Draco one last peck on his lips, held Draco's hand and walked him towards the east wing for Draco's ancient runes class. The walk was slow and leisurely. Harry enjoyed it as he lead Draco there holding his hand and Draco obediently followed. They had fifteen minutes before the class started. Harry ignored everyone who looked at them shocked and looked back at Draco who had his eyes on Harry. Harry smiled at him.
Draco came back and sat besides Harry. He didn't look at him and instead looked at the ground.
"Nope. But I don't mind listening." Pansy said.
"We aren't any different, are we Teddy? Two orphans of the war." Draco sniffs.
Draco stops there in the middle of the foothpath. He shuts his eyes, amd steadies himself, not wanting to break over the phone.
Mea meaning my
The morning was same as last, Draco being a father to Teddy. While almost  everybody sat on the breakfast table, Harry floo himself in.
"Luna. I, I-" Pansy is cut of my Luna kissing her.
"Go slow I suggest. There are collars that you can just use while playing. But the collar I'm wearing, it's not something you decide on a whimp. It's almost like getting engaged. It is that serious. I say that you go on it for a few months before you get collared." Draco suggests.
"I think I'm going to adopt a crup and stay single my entire life." Pansy replied, her voice a bit robotic on the phone.
"Can't listen to it? I can't say it any more." Ralph speaks, a silent tear in his eyes. "Go to sleep, my love."
"Why would the snake listen to me anyway?" Harry asks.
"I lost my hearing aids. I can't hear anything Theo. I don't know what to do. I can't find them." She sobbed.
Draco finished reading and looked at his Nan with slightly wider eyes. His Nan looked back at Draco with wet eyes, tears threatening to spill.
"Would you like me to stay with you? At least until Wednesday I can help during the day. If  I'm spared and I don't go to azkaban, I can help permanently. I'll be here during the days to help you. I'd love to help raise Teddy." I said.
"The wrackpurts are growing around Draco at an alarming rate." Luna says and Harry groans.
Draco thinks.
"No. In fact I haven't agreed to the nonsense they sprouted since my second year. I had to keep pretending otherwise though."
"This one is mine and his name is Eltanin."
Draco could feel the burn in his cheeks as he blushed.
Yeah. Molly, Dori and Mar just left. I've never seen Molly so angry. She said she will kill Bellatrix herself one day.
"Harry. Call me Harry."
"Daddy, Dad. Its time. Come on!" Teddy said.
"Well, at least I haven't kept you tied up somewhere only I can have you." Harry joked.
"Oooh Pansy has a crush. I knew you liked her. You couldn't keep your eyes of her even for a second. My doubt was confirmed when she said she'd hook up with Ginny and you looked like you would hex her then and there." Theo said. That fucker.
"Why don't we get to the pet part, then go out and get back to that part again?" Draco suggests, because why won't he.
"Can you try and call it here?" Draco asks.
"You think Draco is behind the killings? You're giving me mixed signals here Robards." Harry said to deflect.
He hears Potter and Andromeda walking up so he closes the door behind him, leaving them outside. Then with a twirl of his fingers, his harp starts playing a slow melodious tune and he starts to sing slowly.
Do you mean irresistible?
"Let it remain a secret." Harry laughed.
Draco blushes furiously.
"Do you want to get fucked little whore?" He asks.
"Hi Nura. Oh, you're so pretty." Draco then turned to Harry. "Is this where you were the whole day?"
"Do we know why she did it?" Harry asks.
"I have a friend who heard them talking. She was going to the kitchens when she heard Greyback and the Carrows talking. She freaked out and ran. I was the only one awake at that time trying to complete some homework. She looked so scared and pale, I asked her what happened. She told me everything." I lied.
Thesthralls. Such beautiful creatures. Such a terrifying way to be able to see them. There stands here one, beautiful, black skinned, waiting for people to get on the carriage. Draco pets it on it's nose slowly and the thesthrall keens.
"Draco, are you sure?" Harry asked. "You're not a killer."
I walk the line- Halsey
"How much longer will you take to come in the room?" He asks slowly.
Ginny's heart dropped.
Harry was proud of Draco. He sounded like that confident Draco Malfoy, Harry knew before the sixth year, two years ago. The one sure of himself, even if that confidence was all fake. Harry knew better now.
"Not possible." I say. "Both of the cabinets are in Borgin's and Burke's." I say and pray to Merlin the Room of Requirement doesn't come in their mind. They're all daft. It wouldn't really occur them. Hopefully.
"I am a death-eater." I say looking down at my toes.
He remembers that night. Christian does too. That night when Christian took Draco out for a night picnic in a park and was bit by a spider. They spent two hours in the hospital to get the venom out. Draco would then tease him as Spiderman. Christian hugged Draco and took a deep breath like he's trying to remember Draco's smell. Then kissed on his forehead and left abruptly, without looking back. Draco looked at where he was standing just a moment ago and then sighed. He walked out for the washroom.
"You're of age Malfoy. You can legally belong to me even if temporarily and refuse to belong to anyone else. You can belong to me and still be a Malfoy. Plus, I hate to say this but I'm Harry Potter. The only person who can stop me from having you is you." Potter replies.
"Have you, uh, you know, decided where will you be living?" Draco asked.
"I don't think so. We've only settled everything with those people. Plus I think I'd rather know her as a person before going ahead. She's cute but I don't know if I want to go forward with anything or no." Theo explains.
"I can already see it. Harry and Draco. Drarry. I ship it! You'll look so cute together." Ginny said making me blush even more.
Drumrolls excitedly
Harry makes him sit up.
He places Malfoy on the bed and covers him with the duvets. Malfoy falls asleep.
"Daddy! Hat! Daddy look hat!" Teddy says looking at McGonagall's hat.
"Harnesses and cuffs?"
Sorry for the delay. I was trapped reading amazing drarry fics back to back. Also, i won't be stretching this much with a lot of unrealistic twist and turns. It will be short and simple. I'm kinda upset. This is gonna be over soon. But i already have new ideas for new fics.
"Are you okay, my boy?" Mr Olivander asks him.
"Cormac. Where are we going?" Draco asks.
"I just, I just want to try giving over total will and control like that. It sounds hot." Draco bites his lip.
"My son. I am so sorry I couldn't protect you. I am so sorry I couldn't be there with you. But now everything will be fine. It will be alright. We'll be free." His mother tells her in a calm soothing voice. The same voice she used to use when she would try and heal Draco's wounds, the same voice she used to sooth him in when he used to cry and complaint about how unfair his life is and how he wishes he could run away. How he wished that father would leave them alone. And for so long, that voice had helped him calm down. And it felt so, so good to listen to her mother's calm voice and be in her fierce embrace. It feels like home. Home that he used to feel when he was a small child whenever he was hiding with his mother. Home, like how he feels with Harry. Home.
Draco selected one nighty and panties, eye liner and a lipstick and left for the bathroom to dress up.
"Eh, hello. Why are you all here? And since when are you all here?" Potter asks.
Draco breathes.
Draco blushed. He always did whenever Christian praised him.
Draco felt something. When Potter stood up for him. Well, threatened that boy like that. And Draco is loathed to admit, once again, against his wishes, that Harry Potter is extremely hot when angry. Now that he's gone past the scrawny, skinny phase, he's got a growth spurt. He's a head taller than Draco. He's got that muscles building up. Potter is no longer wearing too big clothes. He's wearing jeans and a grey shirt that fit him just right and looks amazing on his bronze body. And Draco can't look at him anymore. But it's just. It's just been so long since he has felt anything apart from the numbness. And it's overwhelming. So he turns around and sits in the carriage.
"Mad Pomfrey, can you please make sure she's here for a few days? She'll be safe here. Don't tell anyone I asked you this please." Madam Pomfrey nods her head.
After a long pause, Harry broke the silence.
McGonagall calls all the eight years up front. They all stand up and follow McGonagall to a part of the castle, they haven't really seen before.
"You don't talk to him. You both have never had a good relationship. I understand why you would come when your aunt comes or when you bring Teddy along. I just don't understand why you would come alone as well, just to sit around with him." Nott says
Whatever you say pads
In front of him are Petunia, Vernon and Dudley Dursley, tied up on the kitchen chairs in the living room. They're all trying to yell but no voice would escape their mouths. Silencio charm, Harry guessed. He looks at Draco who is waiting besides an armchair. He asks Harry to have a seat and Harry does. The seat gives front view of the Dursleys, destressed, terrified, crying. Draco kneels before Harry, placing his hands behind his back and head lowered in silent submission. Its a beautiful view. Every time Draco kneels out of his own violation, Harry feels the butterflies in his stomach. Which, by the way, happens a lot now a days. Draco sometimes like to have breakfast kneeling besides Harry, as Harry feeds him. Or he kneels besides Harry in the Black Library while Harry sits on the desk, doing his research sometimes. Harry loves this consensual submission more than Draco kneeling because Harry said so. Harry pets Draco's hair and Draco leans to the touch.
Narcissa walks in the kitchen and sits on the chair as Andromeda pours tea for both of them. Narcissa glances at the Daily Prophet flashing pictures of Narcissa with Nicholas and making theories about where Lucius Malfoy has disappeared too. Many of the theories hit close to home. But Lucius is dead and far from their lives. She sees an article that shows that Nick is a muggleborn and rolls her eyes.
"What did your aunt talk about with you?" Marina asks.
We need to find a way out of the castle. Ginny needs to get home. Staying in RoR is risky as well. She needs to be somewhere safe.
"That its the best base for cantros potion. Cancer medicine are extremely difficult and gold is the only metal that doesn't cause disruption in the potion. The best quality is always made in gold couldrons. But then there are potions like pepper up that you just can't make in the gold ones." Draco continued chatting like the auror wasn't there and pretending not to blush at the term of endearment Potter used.
Belle stood besides me, her eyes not leaving my mother and her wand ready in her hand. I noticed everyone had their wands ready. They all were there for me.
Harry remembers that night Draco had the nightmare where Astoria helped wake him up. He remembers how that nightmare was specifically bad and affected Draco more than others. He holds Draco tight as he cries hard in Harry's arm and Harry barely manages his own tears. Harry's eyes fall at the pictures and his blood runs cold as ice, he can barely breathe. There are pictures of a limp and naked Draco Malfoy, surrounded by so many death-eaters, at least ten of them. They all have their hands on Draco, his Draco, while one is in Draco's mouth and other is under Draco, clearly visible of what he is doing underneath the limp and barely moving Draco. How can people be so inhuman? How can they do something like that to a child? How can one watch unbothered as their child goes through something so horrendous and horrible? And Draco had to go through this because he chose to save Harry that night in the manor. Harry shuts his eyes close and the pictures burn. He can't look at them anymore.
He's in here. Harry can feel it. Ron, Hermione and Harry are in the third floor while rest have scattered to check the rest of the two floors. Laughter. He hears laughter. They made Draco say something embarrassing and are  interrogating him. How dare they pick him up like that. Harry breaks down the door. He can feel the anger flare up. He is furious. The aurors point their wands at Harry and with a flick of his fingers, they fly back away along with their wands, falling on the floor after dashing on the wall, painfully. Draco. He's tied up on the chair like an accused and he looks hurt. There's blood running from the side of his lips. Harry clenches his fists.
"Mr Grant, that is way off the limit? He's a child! How could you?" Blackburn yells at the prosecutor but Draco barely hears them.
He hears the door open and close and lights suddenly illuminate the office.
"What, Ronald?"
"Harry." Draco said and stopped walking. Harry stopped and looked at him. "Would you like to live with me? In the Manor. Blaise, Belle, Pansy and Theo will be staying as well. But I mean, would you like to move in with me? In my bedroom?"
Bee! You're amazing! That is perfect.
He takes out five leather diaries. He takes his wand and does something on the diary. Each diaries get an alphabet imprinted on it. He hands me the one with D written on the leather cover. And he gives everyone the diaries with their initial written on it. Belle's diary has a beautiful Bee written on it.
"Someone I want." Cormac replied.
In the evening, I receive three more letters. The lawyer and Potter said that they will come to meet me at breakfast. Aunt Romie sent a letter saying tomorrow is okay and that Teddy loves dinosaurs and barbies. I have spoken to Belle and she says she'll testify. Pansy, Blaise and Theo say they'll testify as well. I wonder now what will happen tomorrow and Wednesday.
"Yeah?" Potter asks and then comes to lay besides him. "Like what?"
"Blaise. I think we need to talk." I tell, looking down on the grass. "Blaise. I like you. I really do. Like madly head over heels like you. But we're too young. And after everything we all have been through, I am not ready for a commitment. I would like to be free right now. I really like you Blaise. I have strong feelings for you. But right now, I'm not ready for it." I explain. God I hope he takes this well. I'm so not ready for any drama.
He is offered water by Blackburn which he is so grateful for. He doesn't know how long it's been since he has had some water.
"That is true. He adores you. How is it? This owning thing." Hermione asks.
Potter turns to Draco. He raises his hand to touch on Draco's cheek and Draco flinches. Potter slowly touches his cheek and Draco hisses, burn of the slaps still alive. Sparks did slap him thrice and he didn't hold back. Potter caresses his cheek. No one has ever caressed Draco after being hurt. Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He's never felt this before. This is soothing. This feels nice. His eyes flutter open and he looks into Potter's vibrant green eyes. So green. Potter takes his hand back.
Third person pov
I feel so down. I have to select one child out of so many. None of those kids deserve what will happen to them. How do I do this? How do I select one child? I enter the common room and see some first years sitting together, working on their homework. I feel so overwhelmed. I run to my dorm and cry. I cry a lot. Diana is there but she knows I like to be left alone when I cry. I hate people keep coming and ask me what happened and what's wrong. So she stays on her bed and pretends as she doesn't see me. I'm grateful to her for this.
"Thank you for the cake. If you don't mind, I have to finish this." Draco says politely.
He knew what the answer will be. Draco won't even shower with him to avoid removing the glamour. There was no way Draco was going to say yes now, but Harry had to try.
"Anything you say." Harry agrees.
Teddy and Victorie were already there with Bill and Flur. They ran towards Draco and Harry.
Neville? Will he be good?
Mr Olivander smiles at him and vanishes in the back, bringing out few boxes. Draco ignores the two aurors standing inside with him. He only has thirty minutes afterall and he's on house arrest. Can't go anywhere without the aurors. One of them keeps sneering at Draco. Draco doesn't have it in him to show back any emotions, to feel offended. There's a copy of Daily Prophet kept on Mr Olivander's desk. It shows a picture of Draco walking out of the ministry as a free man. It has an article of how Draco was a victim of war, how Draco was innocent and forced. He doesn't believe in it. He was forced, he knows. But all those deaths in the battle, he knows it's on him. He is to be blamed. He blames himself. A little noise pulls Draco out of his thoughts as he sees Mr Olivander appear. He makes Draco try five wands and none of them fit.
"And if I'm not there to talk, or there's something you can't talk to me about, then please talk to anyone else. I wont mind. But please talk. Okay?"
I believe that a daily prophet article is a necessity when it comes to drarry fics.
McGonagall has called all the Slytherins. All the professors are putting protection wards. Many people from the order are here. They're making all the underage go. Shit. I'm underage. I'm 16. I can't leave my friends alone here. I'm not going to go. All the Slytherins come. This is it. This is when my friends sacrifice themselves and no one will even know.
"Let's go home, Harry." Draco smiles.
"Tori was in her element yesterday. She, cooks a lot when she's upset or stressed so she cooked for an entire army and sent us some." Draco explained.
"Yes who and yes what?" Harry demanded. He felt a shiver pass through Draco's spine.
"Harry, we understand-"
"Smoking every morning for once."
His heartbeat was quick, not afraid but excited. He would love to stay with Potter at his home. He would have Potter all for himself and in the privacy, there were so many other things they could do. They could explore. He smiled at Potter. He's been doing that an awful lot these days, the smiling. His friends seem to be happy about it though.
"Are you fucking kidding me?" Belle almost yelled in shock. Pansy just gave a weak smile.
"Yes. Your grandfather James was in similar predicament as well with Sirius and Remus."
Malfoy gives out an amused laugh.
"Harry we all need to talk. With all of you." Luna says.
"Draco." Potter warns sternly.
"Why aren't you at the window, smoking? And why isn't the music on?" Potter asks sleepily.
"Good news?"
Draco sighed and picked up a fork to pick up on the fruits and Harry gave a triumph smile. Harry wanted to talk to Draco about the music thing. He wanted to apologise but didn't know if now was a good time.
"Why did you come here in such a pouring rain?" Nan asked. "You'll fall sick, Draco."
"You didn't answer me, you know. What are you doing here?" Draco asked after a few moments of silence.
"It's alright. Stand up."
Draco's cheeks heat up as Potter says that. They are doing it today. The spell. The spell which will make Draco's control and will lock in Potter. He bites his lips and gingerly stands up. He holds Potter's outstretched hand and follows as Potter leads Draco into their room. Once in, Potter makes him kneel in front of the French windows that give complete view of the outside. He makes Draco strip down to his knickers before making him kneel. Draco can already feel his cock hardening from the anticipation as Draco kneels on his haunches, crosses his wrists behind his back and bows his head in submission.
"That's an Antipodean Opaleye. I remember Charlie telling me about this one pair that was injured by some wizards. Figures that you get this specific dragon for Draco." Ron informs.
"We can do that." The healer replies.
"Strip." Harry commands softly with a smile.
Marina chuckled.
"Oh, shush you." Neville blushed.
I immediately put silencing charms and lock the door. I go to Belle and hold her. She sits there crying at my chest. I can't do much but to just hold her. I stroke her back and slowly her breathing evens out. She pulls away and wipes her eyes.
"Everything." Draco replies. "Those glasses are way more dead than the dark lord." Draco says earnestly and Harry snorts.
"Yeah. She is pretty. You should ask her out." I suggest.
"I feel like I've slept through the entire week. I've never slept through such extent." Draco siad rubbing his eyes.
Healer Jacobs gave a scrutinizing glare to Cormac and gave him a letter an owl had dropped.
What happens next is something Harry doesn't understand. Malfoy is screaming. On the top of his lungs.
"Before you get angry, please give me a chance to explain. Please listen." Harry said.
The party was going hard in the Leaky. Everyone was drunk except for Harry and Draco who were making fun of others and their drunk stupidity. It was the day of their last exams, it had just finished and they all were here to celebrate as they were all leaving for home tomorrow. Draco was sitting so close to Harry, their thighs touched, Draco could feel the warmth spread towards his groin and flutter in his chest. They were so close, looking at each other leaning so close, they could almost kiss. Draco clears his throat and leans back a bit, then he proceeds to tie up his long hair. Harry stops him, holding his hand.
Oh for fuck sake!
"Belle. Why don't you become the defence against the dark arts professor after finishing the teaching studies? As they all talk about you, you will be good at it." Harry said.
Harry shakes his head as he starts his push ups again, which of course is not the whole way down because there's one Draco Malfoy laying beneath him, demanding a kiss every five push ups.
I swallowed a lump in my throat and a weak voice I replied. "Belle Darling."
"It's wrong, Harry. Wanting to be with him is wrong." Hermione said.
"I love you." Harry hears in a sloppy way which can be something entirely else. But he's sure its I Love You that he heard Draco saying. He grins, holding Draco tight and close to him. Never letting him go.
Draco takes the phone to the living room, only room with magical socket. He places Darien's phone on charge and just as he was about to keep the phone down, it rings. There's a message. Darien is shaving so Draco thinks maybe he can give Darien the message. He opens to check but what he finds is not what he expected.
"What has this got to do with me?" Harry asked.
He pulled his fingers out, leaving his hole wide, gaping and ready for him. He pours good amount of lube on his cock. He slowly pushed the head of his cock inside Draco's hole, slowly fucking it in and out, making his huge cock fit. Draco moaned and screamed through the knickers gag. Harry fasten the pace, knowing he won't be able to hold on longer, he ordered Draco to cum. Draco came immediately without touching, Harry had never seen anything so hot. With a few brutal thrusts, Harry came in Draco as well and then flopped down on top of Draco. He took few deep breaths and sat up, then admired his cum leaking out of Draco's bruised arse. He picked up a glass fallen from the floor, cast a scurgify on it, filled it with water and kept it aside. He turned Draco a little bit. Draco hissed a little as his arse touched the bed. Hary removed the knickers from his mouth and wiped the drool on his chin with the bedsheet. Then he slowly made Draco sip the water and lay him down besides Harry.
As the cheers went silent Harry Yelled. "I love you Draco Malfoy!" Draco blushed and winked at him.
The guitar picks up as Iris and Draco strum and what happens next surprises Harry. The entire crows sings loudly along with Draco.
"Keep your eyes open." Potter commands.
"5:30. But there are some documents in the office I have to pick up so I'll leave a bit earlier."
"Preparing to play with my kitten." Harry smirks.
"This is the third time in two days. I'll set your room on fire if this happens again and not care about the punishment. Stop laughing!" Draco scolds but it goes to waste due to the slight upward tug on his lips.
Harry thinks and chuckles again. He pulls the duvets over Draco and accio's a book he was reading on wandless and wordless magic. With Draco, he just stays.
"What dark magic you used to make Harry Potter fall in love with you? We're here to free him from your curse." One of the two ugly men said.
"Draco?" Potter's voice pulled him back from his flashback.
Andromeda asked questions about everything that happened and Belle and Draco answered about how Belle helped them to get everyone out.
"Swings are for children, ect."
"She's cut throat, scary, not one to be messed with and a Slytherin. Means she'll use all underhanded methods to get what she wants. She's brilliant at her job." Neville tells Elizabeth.
"Oh." Darien replies. "Listen, please handle it all, I'm busy." Darien says and cuts the call.
"Good night, Mr Malfoy." Draco said as he closed his eyes.
"You're a Gryffindor, aren't you?" Draco narrows his eyes.
Harry can't imagine how someone can make a smirk sexual but here Malfoy is, looking behind, his wavy platinum blond hair falling over his face smirking at Harry in the most sexual way possible. His glossed pink lips full and pretty while his cheeks shine due to the glitter. With that milky white body in black lace knickers grinding against Harry's erection, he looks like a fucking walking wildest of Harry's wet dream. Harry groans in frustration as his erection keeps getting harder to a level, its physically painful to control it. And Malfoy grinding against it, isn't helping at all.
"It'll all go down the drains."
What? Draco looks at Harry wide eyed. He can feel his skin on fire and his cock twitch on the command.
"Those are the only scars I want to keep forever."
"Never worked before." Malfoy slurs.
"Alright! Alright! As you say. Hey, it's alright." Cormac tries to calm her down. "Sir, she, uh..." Cormac trails off.
The war is going to come soon. The battle is going to happen. I know of it. What do we do?
"Leave quietly, Weasley. Trust me, one more word, anything towards Draco, I'll rip you apart piece by piece and force your body parts down your wife's throat.
Oh. Harry doesn't say anything, because, honestly, he doesn't know what to say. So he stands there, gaping at Draco like a fish with his mouth opening and closing and opening and closing again. Draco laughs.
"So you will be able to use the hand signals or the safeword if you want it to stop and I can just cast the counter curse on you to get you free of the spell."
He looks up at Harry with his eyes wide and bloodshot. He throws himself on Harry and cries. He cries loudly, sobbing hard. Harry holds him tight and takes a deep breath.
Love,
Shit its a smoothie!
"I don't want to talk to him! I hate him! I hate him! Ask him to fuck off! I don't want to talk to him!" Millicent starts yelling.
After an hour of Draco dancing, in between which he had removed his heels and gave them to Potter, they left the club. They walked hand in hand. Draco's feet were paining so Potter did the most gentlemanly thing he could. He gave Draco his loafers, which Draco had told Potter had to wear or he would cancel the date, and walked with Draco's heels in his other hand. Draco blushed as he walked in Potter's huge shoes while Potter walked only in his socks.
We have no option. We can't let anyone know what side we truly are on.
It was Draco's choice when he heard about the level of the man's fascination with all things muggle. Mrs Weasley then hands Draco and Potter their presents. Draco blinks at her wide eyed then blushes. He bites his lip and eyes the untidy wrapping, then with delicate hands, opens it. Inside he finds a hand knit midnight blue jumper with a beautiful cursive D embroided in silver. His very own Weasley sweater. He can feel his eyes tear up. Polite hospitality is what he had expected the most to happen. This acceptance of him as family, he didn't. And these were adults. Actual adults who accepted Draco with open arms and Draco is terrified. Adults have always let him down. His father let him down. His mother let him down. So many other adults did as well. Actually, every adult he's met let him down. The only person who didn't was Severus, who every moment tried his best to keep Draco protected. He did so, as much as he could in front of the dark lord as well. He was the only one who actually cared what Draco had to talk about, what Draco felt.  And then he let Draco down by getting killed. Draco bites his lip to stop it from quivering. Will these adults let him down as well?
"After the pictures I saw in the court, I have to agree. If anyone deserves to die, it's Lucius."
Harry smirked and slowly picked up his pace. Soon he was thrusting in Draco fast and deep. Draco let out cries and moans of the pleasure and pain he felt. After good ten minutes of fucking, Harry took out his cock from Draco and came on his ass.
"Thank you for walking with me." Pansy smiles.
This, now, calms Draco down immediately. So the fucker had been planning this. He planned and learnt and took care of everything. It wasn't a reckless Gryffindor thing he did with those four people.
Draco couldn't look at Harry. His cheeks were red from blushing. Harry did a wandless silencing charm. He caught Draco's waist from one hand his caught his hair from other and pulled in Draco for a kiss. The kiss started slowly but then Harry became aggressive with the kissing. He kissed hard and forced his tongue in Draco's mouth. Draco caught Harry's neck from one hand. His other hand went in Harry's shirt. Harry broke the kiss and without wasting a second kissed Draco's neck. He slowly sucked and bit Draco's neck while still having a hard grip on his hair. Draco left out soft moans and put his hand on Harry's ass. Draco felt his tender but firm ass while Harry sucked his neck. Harry pulled of and kissed Draco again. As soon as Harry moved his hand slowly towards Draco's abdomen, slowly going down there was a knock at the door.
Pansy waits in the waiting room of the Witch Weekly's building for an interview. She still works for the prophet, but she just can't anymore. It's too much for her. She turns the pages of her magazine as she hears a familiar voice. She looks up to see Longbottom.
"Oh, thank you!" Darien scoffed.
"You had two days. Two days and you could've won. Why did you give up?" Potter asks breathless.
"You really should know that you're alive because of him before you say that." Theodore said.
"They went on a date next day after you people met us at Outcast." Malfoy says. Harry looks at him questioning and he sighs. "The gay bar I sang in. They kissed that night and Weaslette asked her out. They've been dating since."
What can I say, I'm charming snd irresponsible
"That would be because you've starved yourself for four days. Have a little something in your stomach please. I've got all kinds of sweets for you. Pastries, pancakes, waffles, toast and tea as well."
The only reason he didn't block the burrow through the floo is because of Arthur and Molly. They seemed genuinely sorry for what Ginny, Ron and Hermione put Harry through. Even though they didn't agree on Draco, they were willing to accept him for Harry. After a little while, so were Bill and Fleur. Charlie always supported Harry and cut off ties with Ron, Hermione and Ginny after listening to everything they made Harry do and said to him. Charlie being a bisexual, couldn't handle his temper at the blatant homophobia. Harry understood George's reason not to support, Fred's death was something he could never move on from, but he wasn't really looking for George's permission.
"Where to?" Asked Potter.
"Thank you" Draco mumbles, still not looking up, feeling like a child.
"Hanna has fixed it. Neville already has a Gryffindor child packing. Take this." Luna said as she gave me a coin. I looked at her confused. "Its the D.A. coin. You can communicate to all us D.a. members together as well as personally. This will help us a lot." She said. I nodded and put it in my bag.
He holds Draco's hands and pulls Draco towards him. Wordlessly, Draco comes and sits on his lap. Harry hugs him and Draco automatically locks his arms around Harry's neck.
"That is not what I meant and you know it. I specifically told you to stay away that imbolc and you didn't listen. That's it. You're not allowed to meet him alone or write him anymore." Longbottom says firmly.
I close the diary and put it in my bag instead of the trunk. I think it will be safer with me and I won't be late in getting messages. I run of to washroom and freshen up. I come to my dorm, take my bag and leave for the great hall. When I sit I turn and look at Neville. Ginny is no where to be seen. Luna comes and sits besides me.
Longbottom's gonna die. There's nothing I can do about it. What's happening? Why are people- Potter! He's alive! He's alive! Yes!
"How do you know about his childhood?" Harry asks.
"Good job. That was the first and the last time I'll ever spy for you though. I didn't become an animagus for this."
Rituals
Outdoor scenes Public exposure
"Why won't I be serious about this?" Harry grits his teeth and asks.
I am going to sleep
"Do kittens walk on two legs, pet?" Potter asks.
"Belle." Draco said. "Don't slouch and please take your elbows of the table. How many times do I have to remind you? Its not polite to keep your hands in the table like that."
Harry caught Draco's hand and stopped him. With his other hand, he caught Draco's hair and pulled him in for a kiss. Lucky for Draco Harry was tall. Draco was tall as well, but Harry was taller. Harry caught is hair tight that it pulled. Draco moaned and pleasure of being kissed and pain of his hair being pulled. Draco caught Harry's neck and waist. Harry bit Draco's bottom lips and Draco gasped. Using this opportunity, Harry pushed his tongue in Draco's mouth. After the intense kissing, Harry finally let go of Draco. They both looked at each other breathless. Harry grinned at Draco and Draco blushed. They both held hands and continued walking in the garden.
Rose narrows her eyes as she watches a girl approach Scorpius. It's been a year, but these bitches never leave him. Damn him for being so good looking.
Draco covered his face, eyes burning as tears welled up.
"Nick." She sighs with a small smile on her own face.
"Leave." Potter growls. "And if you ever touch him again, it will be the last thing you do."
"Hello, Duke Cartier. I'm Harry Potter and I've heard a lot about you." Harry's smile widens.
"Pansy all the clothes I bought are her size and style." Neville blurts out after a moment of silence.
"No. Don't you dare." He says in a stern voice while still fucking.
"I didn't peg you to be the one to know about that."
Whatever makes you feel better prongs
Harry felt irritated now. Draco had been hurt and she cared about what Harry did to them.
"You love reading, Draco. You told me you loved reading so much that you were worried you'll end up a Ravenclaw. I have a homework for you."
"It's not her?" Draco chokes.
We all looked at them stunned.
"I love you Draco." He said.
"Please do it for me." Neville kisses her neck and Pansy moans.
At this moment Belle had enough. She glared at Milicent furiously and casted a wandless slug vomiting charm. Milicent started to yell and cry and she ran to the hospital wing.
"I was supposed to give you this yesterday but we got distracted and we didn't have time in the morning. Sorry." Potter said sheepishly.
"There's that blush. I missed that blush of yours. You're gorgeous when you blush, you know that?" Christian smiles.
Draco gags as Potter directly shoves it down deep in his throat. He can feel his throat burn in intrusion. He tries to relax his throat and breath through the nose, which honestly is a huge task if you're sucking a cock like Potter's. Potter clutches Draco's hair with both hands and fucks Draco's throat in a brutal pace. Draco gags and chokes, he can feel his eyes burn with tears and spit drool down his chin. He knows Potter is close, he always does. And today, potter isn't trying to prolong his orgasm. Soon Draco can feel the sticky salty taste of Potter's cum. He coughs as he tries to swallow it all down.
"He was innocent. He was framed. He is Harry's godfather and has been working alongside us since the order was formed. All the 'adults' were the part of first order. Sirius is a very nice man and we all trust him. Well, trusted him. He died trying to save Harry."
Harry's POV
"I missed singing. I was thinking how it's been so many months I haven't been on stage. I miss that too. I haven't done many things I used to do since I'm with you." Draco replies.
Draco blushes and nods.
The rest three attackers came out and all hell broke lose. They all shake Harry's hands eagerly and make tea for Harry. Harry sits there, the smile still intact on his face.
"I do." Belle says.
"I'm here, Draco. I'm here. You're safe, my love. They won't touch you. You're safe. Shhh pet, you're alright. You're with me." Harry tries to calm Draco down.
I don't know if she hid herself. I did tell her too. Luna and Neville were there helping her. I'll try to find out during breakfast.
Harry laughed. He tried controlling but he just couldn't. Draco and he had been laughing and talking about silly things while Draco made jokes about it with all his animated hand gestures. The way Draco narrated stories with expressions and hand gestures was the Draco Harry knew from their past. The one who made fun of him and dressed up in a dementor costume once. Harry had woken up screaming from a nightmare in the middle of the night. He woke up to Draco calling out his name, trying to wake him up. Draco didn't ask if he was okay, didn't tell him to talk about it, just held him in silence and let Harry calm down. He talked about things that didn't matter, about anything and everything, which Harry was greatful for. Harry was slightly embarrassed to be seen as weak in front of Draco. He's the one in charge, he should be the one taking care of Draco and have his shit together.
Harry leans down and whispers in Draco's ear with a heavy drawl.
Hair pulling
"Malfoy!" Draco's eyes widen as he watches Dean Thomas come up to him with a smile and hug him. "How have you been?"
Ginny rolls her eyes and ignores Harry completely. She walks past him to her girlfriend and bebds down to give her a kiss
He starts to suck my other boob and bites this nipple as well, while he pinches my other nipple painfully. I moan through my gag.
"They do." Draco agrees quietly.
"Mione! Mione!" Ron yelled.
"I don't know anymore." Draco replies.
"Mine. All of our parents are in azkaban so we all have been living together. Dray and Bee will live with us." Theo says. I give a nod.
"This, children, is called the cruciatus curse. It is used to torture people. It is used for punishment. And I will use this on every student who dares open their mouth. Specially on filthy mudbloods." Amycus said while Alecto laughed. "Call Draco." He came near me and knelt besides me. He raised his hand then touched me on my cheek, slowly moved his fingers towards my neck.
"Did your aunt visit again?" Mind Healer Marina asks.
Gags (phallic)Gags (ring)Gags (ball)Mouth bits
Potter regards him for a few more seconds which makes Draco extremely uncomfortable. He shuffles from one foot to another and fidgets with his fingers, looking down. He does not want to look at Potter when he looks like that.
"Do you know to dance?" The blond asks and Harry's smile falters.
"Draco only Harry knows what he'll say. I don't care if he's the golden one. If you like being girly and he doesn't appreciate that about you then he isn't the one. Although I have a feeling he might actually like that. I think you must talk to him." Belle assured him.
"Strip." He orders and I obey.
"As much as I appreciate to be checked out by you Potter, I prefer you warm your eyes inside the house." I smirked. He looked at me and I saw him swallow his Adam's apple. "Come inside everyone." I smiled.
"That day, when you took Cissa to St Mungos, I wasn't with Pansy. I was with someone else." Draco sobs. "I've been meeting him since past few weeks. I don't know when it started. Please forgive me Darien. I'm sorry." Draco cries as he hugs Darien.
"Well, can't help. You are just that precious." Potter laughs and kisses his forehead.
It isn't your fault Bee. If it wasn't you it would've been someone else. And even if it was you there definitely would've been another girl. These people make me sick. I just wish they didn't exist. I'm so sick of it. Our parents are one of them. I'm so ashamed to be called their son.
"I'd go with avoid. Why would anyone be friends with Malfoy?" Ron sneers.
Next morning Harry wakes up to instrumental music, again. Not that he's complaining. He actually likes it. He opens his eyes to see a sight that takes his breath away. Malfoy is standing on the window, wearing the knickers and white shirt from last night, his hair tied in a half bun, smoking a cigarette. Sometimes he wishes he wasn't a boy, so he wouldn't have to deal with morning wood and untimely erections. He ignores it the best that he can and think of the things that will most definitely turn him off. Dudley naked works like a charm. A shudder passes through Harry and he cringes but the deed is done. His erection is off.
I sensed someone come besides me. Draco leaned towards me and picked me up. I used his support to stand and somehow managed to walk to the hospital wing. Draco called Madam Pomfrey and help me lay on the bed. Tears had started rolling down my cheeks. I looked at him and he looked genuinely sad. Madam Pomfrey arrived and then everything went black.
"Of course I do. I let him call me Daddy instead of Father." Belle and Potter gave him a questioning look. "My father didn't really held me. I had to call him Father because that was a formal thing to do. Calling him dad would be very personal. Living with him was like living with a person who just takes care of your finance. There never was a personal bond. I won't do that with Teddy. I'll always hug him and let him call me dad. I'll be like a friend. Teddy won't grow up without a dad like I did. And I'd definitely not be an abusive father." Draco explained, hugging Teddy in his arms.
"What time is the portkey?" Millicent asks as she takes a drag of her cigarette.
They walked to the common room together. Belle held his arm and rested her head on his arm while walking. Blaise was really tall for her. As they entered the common room hand in hand, everyone smiled at them.
"I have no idea why you and the ministry thinks that." Potter replies, looking straight in the eyes of Blackburn.
He didn't torture Dudley that much. Dudley was afterall, a child as well. Harry ensured not to use his wand as he slowly and painfully, cut them in pieces while they were still conscious. He saw their breathing stop at cutting their heads. With a quick spell, he transfigured all of the parts of the dead bodies to various stuff, like china, wooden toys, dead animals. And with a quick spell, he cleaned all the blood. He cast a strong Notice Me Not charm and Muggle Repellent charm then asked Draco to lift his head.
"Yes." Draco replies. Why did he decide to come here again?
"Yes Ron." Hermione kisses his cheek.
"Do you ever hate me for maiming you? For adding in those scars of yours?" Harry asked with a heavy heart.
Songs
"And what will you do if it's too much or you want to end it?"
"It was always you Harry. I love you." Draco blushed.
"I'm fine." Draco says blushing. It's not always that Tori shows her soft side.
"I'd love to see that one day that Draco isn't in any trouble." Brown sighs.
They get upset when they fight.
"Ginny you need to hide. In the room of Requirement. You need to hide. Your brother, Ron. He's with Potter isn't he? Your family has just been labeled as criminals because you'll are blood traitors. They're coming for you tomorrow. You need to leave. You need to hide." I tell her. They all freak out.
"Tried that. The owls came back empty handed."
Storm was sitting there, looking smug. Draco avoided the portraits and sat on the chair opposite McGonagall's. Her desk between them.
"Thanks?" Draco smiles.
Draco nods in answer as he blushes on being called a good boy.
"He favoured gryffindors. Hated us. Just like all others. He knew I was tasked to kill him. He still didn't help me. He wouldn't have until he could find a way to get my loyalty. That's how he really was. Blind obedience is what he looks at and his version of right and wrong waries on what's good for him. I've seen it myself. Many times. No Slytherin could ever count on him. We've all seen this. He knew my task and did nothing to help me."
"Draco is a man." Harry says.
"Harry." Ginny looks at him.
The snake replies.
"Yes."
Harry took the small plate from her hand, added a bit of brownie crumbs beside the cake and few choco-chips. He took a deep breath as Eveta grinned and gave him a thumbs up. Harry went out the door, straighten his shirt and placed the plate on Draco's table.
"That's fine. I was missing Teddy anyways. And Draco was craving of french pastries from his favourite bakery in France." Harry smiles.
"You do know I'm not a whore, right?"
Wildfire: demi lovato
"Merci." He thanked before he looked up and then his world shook."
"Talking will help, Harry." She says, her brown eyes drawn in concern.
"And if I win?" Draco asks because he has to.
Draco is still laying on the bed, cocooned in the duvets. He looks at Harry and manages a weak smile. Harry smiles back at him. He places the breakfast at the bedside tables and grabls a glass then fills it with water. He manages to coax Draco into sitting and makes him drink it after he casts a cleaning charm in Draco's mouth. Harry charms the juke box to play some loud music he doesn't know but as Draco has the cassettes, it plays. Draco looks at him, clearly confused at his action. Harry passes the tray in front of him and he gives the food a look of disdain. Harry sighs. It happens after the nightmares. Draco had only started eating regularly because of Harry but he still went on the starving mode and skipped meals every now and then. And Harry honestly couldn't handle it. He couldn't handle Draco starving well enough because he had been starved enough to never want to starve again.
"You have great taste, that's what." Harry replies.
After another success and a salary raise, Draco decided to treat himself with desserts. He had seen this mint green bakery yesterday and wanted to try it out. He loved bakeries. He always tried to find bakeries wherever he went in the world. Today, he chose this one to celebrate. He wished he could celebrate it with Pansy and Blaise, but they were off on their honeymoon and wouldn't be back for another week. So Draco entered the bakery with a smile on his face, ordered lemon cheesecake with a frappe. He was working on the next steps of the potions, comparing notes when he saw the cake appear.
"Why do you think so?"
He waits patiently as Draco gathers strength and courage to open his eyes. He waits as Draco reaches out for Harry's wand hand to hold him and ground him. Harry abandons his wand for Draco and holds his hand. He watches patiently as Draco takes a deep breath and slowly opens his eyes. Grey eyes meets green and slowly leaves to tilt his head and gasp as he sees the plain skin, unmarred, unmarked, unscarred. He watches Draco's Adam's apple bob as he thickly swallows, staring at the pale, plain skin on his left arm. He watches as tears well Draco's eyes, his face showing hundred emotions at once, relief, gratitude, love, happiness. He watches as Draco looks back at him with a smile so wide that lights up the room as if the room is filled with a thousand candles. He watches Draco breath, free of the scar, free of the mark, free. He watches as Draco drags his hand away, puts it in his pocket and takes out a small box. He watches Draco as Draco uses Harry's wand to unshrink the box and use the same left arm gift Harry the box. Harry eyes the box for several seconds before he finally takes it from Draco and opens it. The box reveals two albums. The albums beautiful white with gold delicate flowers on it designed with thin outlines.
Harry wants to take off Draco's clothes and just keep him in the pretty knickers he will be wearing today. He just doesn't know how to go on about it. Draco hasn't been much naked since two weeks. He then catches the hem of Draco's [actually Harry's] t-shirt and looks at Draco, silently asking for his consent. Draco gives a shy nod and a soft smile. The smile makes Harry believe that Draco is actually okay with it. He proceeds to take off Draco's t-shirt. He asks the same way for his pants and takes it off when Draco replies in affirmative. Harry then takes his wand to cast a spell to create a hole in Draco's purple knickers. Then he casts the spell to give Draco cat ears and tail. Draco looked beautiful. Those pointy and fluffy white cat ears and the white tail looks extremely adorable on Draco. Draco blinks and looks at him shyly but with shiny silver eyes. Harry then strokes him behind his cat ears and Draco purrs.
"I do. Related to my yeses and nos, Potter has come up with a few rules that I have to follow. As he is the dominant one and as a submissive I must respect and obey. Potter, he's not like my father or those other people. The rules I have are the ones that I'll happily follow. He doesn't make me do anything I don't want to. He doesn't make me want to say no."
"Fine." Harry grits his teeth. "Been happier with Draco." Harry says and kisses Draco's lips, showing everyone that Draco belongs to him. "How have you been?" He asks finally after kissing Draco.
"Overdramatic sod." Draco can hear the fondness in Harry's voice.
We say the password and knock McGonagall's door.
His heart flutters as he hears Potter chuckle. With one strong tug on Draco's hands, Potter pulls Draco close to him and closes his other hand firmly around Draco's waist.
"I'm getting married. Hannah Abbott." Neville replied.
His gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead.
"Why do you say that?" Harry asked, still looking at the dragon mesmerized.
"It is! You just don't know. You have a bad taste."
Draco gave a small nod and took his hand. Christian lead him to the dance floor that has Halsey's cover of Sucker from Jonas Brothers playing. Christian placed one hand on his hip and other held his hand, Draco placed one hand on his shoulder. Christian kept fomal distance from Draco unlike the other times when he used to pull Draco so close that there wouldn't be any space for air to pass between them.
Wait! When the fuck did Draco start thinking of Potter as Harry?
Draco averting his eyes gives the answer.
"You are." He says equally quiet.
Oh look. Apparently conversations like these is all it takes to make wormy wrote properly.
"You do. You can say no." Theo says.
She gives me a hug and eats a muffin. "So what's up?" She asks.
"Why did you want You-Know-Who and other death-eaters dead?"
I hate when people ask me about myself. "What do you want to know?" I asked somewhat uncomfortable.
"Where's Draco?" I asked Pansy.
"Nope. If you don't give me the job, I won't out your secret. I'm just showing you that I'm amazing at my job and that I can find stuff others can't. Your secret is safe."
"That's shallow, but I understand." Harry said as he entered. Draco flushed. "Its okay little dragon. I understand." He smiled.
They all walk towards the great hall. Draco gets some death glares as many people still don't believe that he was at their side all along.
"I've no idea what are you speaking of."
Albus looks at McGonagall who is already looking at him.
"Its alright though. Next hogsmade trip she just came to me, handed me a plant with a note and left. Note said Sorry For Punching You." Neville laughed.
"I, I'm just worried." Scorpius says as he sits on the teacher's desk in the transfiguration classroom.
Sometimes I drink milk straight from the container
Draco pours tea for Harry and himself as well and Harry thanks him. Draco waits until Harry takes a sip of his tea and then Draco takes a sip as well.
"I am a whore, Rose. Of course I can't be casual with you so it's other girls I go to! You're not the one to be casual with for fuck sake."
"Harry. I'm sorry. Please look at me." Draco asks quietly.
"I will, my love. I will. I will save her, I will end him. I will heal your scars. Then you will be completely only mine. Mine and mine only." Harry promised and kissed Draco's forehead. "Come now. I've brought some take out for you. You will like it."
"Your mother didn't do anything?" Harry asked.
"Shit, Draco. I'm so sorry." Harry's green eyes softened.
I already informed everyone through the diary that I will be going home today. I'm called home by my parents and voldemort. I reach home by floo and I'm welcomed by many death-eaters who are now living in my home. This place never really felt like home but at least it was safe before all these people claimed it as theirs. I catch on on everything that has happened and I find out that they have Luna here. They just got her this morning. I freak out but don't let my expressions show. I settle in my room and put out wards so that I have some privacy. I immediately take out my dairy and start writing.
Draco is desperate, his balls hurt, he wants to cum so bad, Potter is teasing him and there's nothing he can do about him. He's never been more alive.
"I would've given you such good rewards today, Draco but alas. You had to be misbehave. I'll have to punish you instead." Harry says and then leaves Draco.
Draco enters his home, now bared and empty after Darien left and as soon as he enters, he watches an owl awaiting for him. He walks to the owl and hands it few treats then watches as the owl flies away. He picks up the envelope and can make out Harry's untidy scrawl. He slowly opens the letter and reads it.
"Yes, pet. I'm here. I'm with you." Harry reassures him as he strokes through Draco's hair.
This was test waters. He hoped Draco would answer him. He needed the answer and he got one after fifteen minutes of silence.
"What's happened to you, Millie. You were such a fun-loving girl." Darien sighs.
"Guys. She's Belle Darling. Yes that's her name." Belle chuckles at this. "She's my friend. Belle, this is Pansy, Theo and Blaise."
"I wasn't killing myself. I just, the pain, its my relief. I've been getting it since I was a baby. Its the only way I know." He starts sobbing slowly. I hug him.
"Yeah. I was just so scared. I don't like him. When I saw him, I immediately remembered that Hufflepuff girl who lost her life. I was so scared." She says, her voice still weak.
Potter raised his eyebrows and narrowed his eyes. Draco just realised how Potter could look strict without narrowing his eyes. And now that he has seen Potter narrow his eyes, he wants them to go large again. He swallows.
Draco blushed. He loved watching Draco blush.
"You okay?" He asked.
Pansy walked our of the office with all dignity, closed the door behind her then ran to Neville, jumping on him for a hug. Neville laughed and hugged back.

"Hmm." Potter replies sleepily.
"Did you go and check?"
"Harry, please, please."
Aunt Romie [Andromeda]
Potter stood up for Draco. There weren't many people aside from his friends that would do something like this and Draco felt something warm in his chest. He's got to step away from Potter. Potter is making him have feels and Draco isn't sure he likes that.
Harry felt his throat close and his hear beat skip. He could feel tears well up in his eyes. He bent down a little and gave another kiss on the top of Draco's head.
"She's a Slytherin, Ginny." Draco says. "We have a rule to not let any Slytherin behind. They will take care of each other even if she doesn't have best friends there. She'll be fine."
I sigh. "Its alright." I hug her. "Go on now. Try to be out of the radar. She nods and walks towards the door. "Belle." I call out.
Harry pulled his hand away, raised the belt and gave three rapid blows in succession. A choked sob escaped Draco's throat and to Harry, that sounded beautiful. Just as beautiful as Draco begging for more, which Harry generously gave. Blow after blow from the belt, leaving red and angry welts on the pretty arse. Draco's arse was extremely red stood out from his entire pale white body. The contrast looked beautiful. Harry turned Draco around to see his eyes red and tears flowing freely, his expressions blissed out. Harry pulled him in a possessive kiss. His hands exploring all over Draco's body. Draco moans in the kiss. Harry barely notices that all the glass, the broken objects move out of the way as Harry catches Draco's wrists and pushes him down Draco's bed and Draco hisses through the pain. He removes his shirt and gets back to kissing Draco, his hands, fingers exploring every possible inch of Draco's skin, touching lightly, teasing. Making Draco moan deep in the kiss.
"Belle Darling." She said and put her hand out.
"Up you get, my love." He hears.
"She hates us smoking. So creates a scene when she sees us smoking. So we don't let her see us." Belle explains.
He still doesn't understand why it is Potter he is speaking with about this and not Nan or Pansy. He always shares everything with Pansy. Pansy was the first one to know how his marriage had taken a turn for. She knew that the marriage was over but he didn't like to admit it so she never forced him to talk. Just always held him as he cried, knowing without asking what was wrong.
Third person pov
Draco had lipgloss on with glitter on his cheeks. 'Highlighter.' Draco called it. Harry extended his arm and Draco took it. They walked out of the dorm hand in hand.
"And if she isn't okay with it, you're going to just end our friendship?"
"Sorry Minnie." Belle said looking down.
"My phone's lost since past two days. Do you have a quill?"
We are too D. I hate it how my parents talk about how great that dark lord is. And I have to smile and pretend to agree on everything they say. It disgusts me.
"I don't know yet. I'll stay here for a while until I figure out a place to live. Maybe rent an apartment."
"How brilliant, Cormac, you have so many recommendations. People say I should make you a paralegal."
"Ho. Ly. Fuck!" Hermione all but yelled.
Draco sits in the library and glares at his astronomy textbook.
He feels hands under his arms and someone picking him up, laying him on the bed. The bed is good. It's comfortable and soft and good. He can distantly hear Potter mutter something, the voice soothing and soft on his ears. And he's unaware of the goofy grin that's on his face as he lays on the bed, his eyes still close and he falls asleep.
I take Teddy to the kitchen and sit on the dining table. I transfigure the chair besides me into a high chair and place Teddy there. When I was a child, you had to earn the place to sit besides your father. I never really got to sit besides him. A reminder of what a looser I was. I make a decision that I'll never let Teddy go through any of such shit. So I settle Teddy besides me. Tilly gets Teddy's breakfast and I ask her to cook something up for me. While she cooks my breakfast, I feed Teddy. Its a task and Teddy plays with his food a lot but I manage to feed him half of his breakfast.
"Are you fucking kidding me?" She yelled with gritted teeth. "Why would I want to talk about my feelings when I can just ignore them, have sex and move on. Next time someone asks you sympathy sex Blaise, just give them."
And so Harry does.
"Nothing makes it okay you wanting to be with that bastard of an arsehole who-"
"There are so many books about undetectable curses, wards, incantations to remove any magical traces or residues. Plus I'm raised muggle, you know. There's also science that can be used." Potter says and sips his tea.
Draco gives him a pleading look.
"Say anything to him ever again, and I'll make sure people here who can't see the thesthralls yet will be able to see it. I'll make it painful for you."
"Sit up." Potter commands in that tone that Draco likes.
Tori looks at him with expressions Draco has never seen before. Draco doesn't understand those expressions.
"There was a time Darien couldn't keep his hands off me. Now I feel pathetically grateful if he even glances at me once." Draco says, finally, out loud. The truth about his marriage.
The blond gives Harry one glance and turns back again looking down at his phone and having a sip of a light blue drink.
"And your new Care of Magical Creatures teacher seems to be late today." Says McGonagall as someone runs inside the great hall and Draco's eyes widen.
"Cormac?"
"Okay. Body hurts a bit." Draco replies honestly.
"Buzzy Bee, I never knew what it was like to have a family. A real family. I had people who gave birth to me, thats it. I had wonderful friends who cared about me, and I love them but then you came in my life and became something I never thought I could have. You, a muggleborn, saw me for who I am, saw me against the person I kept playing, saw the real me and became mine, a pureblood's true family. And today I walked you down the aisle. I've always been so proud of you. Zabini, I will not give you the 'You hurt her I'll kill you' talk because let's face it. She will herself end you herself if you hurt her so I'm not really worried about her. But I am worried about you and I hope you survive the rest of your days. I love you both and I'm so proud of you both." Everyone has a drink and Draco sat.
Draco bites his lower lip and has a small, extremely shy smile.
His eyes narrowed. The secret he had kept hidden from so many people, but he couldn't anymore. He couldn't keep it a secret from Potter or his friends. But the last thing he wanted was pity. He did not want to be pitied by anyone, especially the Weasleys. He sighed. He didn't have the energy to hide it all anymore. He sat down on the armchair in the common room and poured himself a glass of the expensive wine he likes. He picked it up and oxidised it a bit by swirling it a bit circular motions. He gulped down the entire drink and refilled it.
"Mr Potter?" An auror came through the door without even bothering to knock in Draco's room in St Mungos. It had been a week since Draco was admitted because of the curse those four people had placed on his Draco.  Draco was to be discharged in two days and then they would be in the sanctuary of their dorm. Wait, not an auror. Head auror. His red robes had golden rim, not silver. He raised his eyebrows in question and let Draco take his hand. Harry immediately squeezed it to reassure Draco.
"I was a Slytherin about it. I made Rose be a Gryffindor and pushed her to talk. Scorpius was a lost cause." Albus smiles.
"Harry has a thing for Malfoy in leather pants?" George barged in. "Finally. Congratulations Harry. You're officially the last one to know that you have something for Malfoy."
"Christian." Draco whispered.
"Oh, you know baby that you're the one for me. I'm talking for Draco." She says as Nott walks towards her and kisses her.
"Harry please. My head hurts, my whole body hurts and I need water. Please let's just go home. I want to go home." Draco pleads.

Belle's POV
He looks at Draco, observes him. Draco bites his lips, that pretty blush hasn't left his cheeks once. He takes a bold step forward and nudges Harry's thigh with his cheek and the top of his head. Harry smiles at his confidence. He strokes Draco's cheek tenderly and gives a sigh.
"Whats in your pocket?" She asks. I take the green apple out.
"Two weeks, Harry! Why is she younger than us? She has to go through an entire year without us. I mean, all her friends are graduated, I'm graduated. She has no one there. " Ginny rants.
Belle's POV
"Harry, what did you do to them?" Hermione asked.
"I do."
"He can't sleep still. Its a pain." Hermione spoke. She spun the bottle and it landed on Pansy. Belle smirked.
"What the hell was that about?" Ginny asked.
"Draco! Would you like a drink? Come on, my boy." Iris urges Draco and Harry can feel the tension release from Draco's stiff shoulders and neck.
Harry can hear Draco's constant angry muttering.
"You don't even have to ask."
"Close your eyes." Harry says as he rests his forehead on Draco's and Draco, his obedient pet, obeys.
"Mr Potter, you can't be here right now. We're healing the patient." The mediwizard says. He and the healer are both staring at Harry.
"Mr. Malfoy." Robards ignored Harry and turned to him. "Can you tell me anything about the attack?"
Magic. Oh sweet magic. He feels it rushing and flowing in his body. In his very veins, his blood, his every fiber as soon as the shackles are off. It flows through him, warming him like sun in a winter morning. After Merlin knows how many days in that cold, damp, holding cell, the warmth is greatly appreciated. He breathes in deep and leaves it out. Did his another birthday got wasted? Well, his mother certainly isn't going to welcome him home with lemon cheesecake she got it made for him his every birthday. He shuts his eyes. Flash. Flash. So many cameras. So many reporters. How does he escape this? He barely notices the aurors pushing them out, away from him. He opens his eyes and for a minute goes back to the war. He goes back to that maniacal laughter of his aunt Bellatrix. He can feel the Cruciatus curse flowing to him. He blinks. It isn't Aunty Bella. It's his Aunt Andromeda.
Draco kissed Teddy good night and gave a hug to Pansy. He took Harry by his hand and ran to his room. He asked Harry to wait while he gave Pansy Teddy's favorite blanky and dinosaur soft toy.
Forced nudity (around others)
"Congratulations, Mr McLaggen. And, you'll receive a very good news for your restaurant in a week."
"How do you know this?" Neville asks.
"What?" Draco squeaks.
"Tell her I'm not home." Harry told Eveta, knowing full well that Hermione could see him.
"Potter, can we take her to France with us? Please please please?" Draco gave Harry puppy eyes.
"You're serious." Malfoy states.
"Because you want it." Draco replies quietly.
Harry takes a shark breath.
"It's not her, Draco. It's not her. You're safe, my love. She just looks like her. It's Andromeda. Your aunt Andromeda." He hardly registers the words being said to him but they do.
"So, what are you doing here?"
"Pussy." Pansy fake coughed.
*Voyeurism/Exhibitionism
Draco stood in front of the doors of the ball room. He raised his hands and held the doorknobs of the double doors, took a deep breath and slowly opened them. The doors creaked in the dead silence. As Draco should have gotten a picture of the ruined ballroom, he didn't. What he got instead was a flashback.
"Why?" Millicent asks.
Confidence that he is faking because right now he is anything but confident. He doesn't know how to help Draco. He wants to make Draco feel better.
"Thank God!" I breath a sigh of relief.
McGonagall had a tear in her eyes. She cupped Belle's face and kissed her forehead before handling the certificate. "I'm so proud of you Belle. I'm proud of you. You are just as well as my own daughter and I love you."
"It doesn't matter Harry. Its okay." Belle looks at me. I think she sensed my emotions.
Millicent's eyes widen as she looks at Cormac shocked.
"Have you tried talking to him?"
Guys. I just recieved a very shitty news. A Hufflepuff thirteen year old raped by the death-eaters then tortured and killed by Bellatrix. Fucking Goyle was laughing about it. She's killed! I don't know what to do. I'm so scared.
They spend almost thirty minutes discussing they negotiations. They had a fair set of the yeses, nos and maybes. But now they both also had erections.
Vibrator on genitalsMasturbation
"Lupin?" Draco asked.
"Aah, Draco. Take this filth to the hospital wing. I want her back on her feet as soon as possible." Amycus said.
He starts fisting Draco's cock again and this time it doesn't even takes Draco a minute.
Draco doesn't reply. What will he say. He has nothing to say to them. To anyone. He's got nothing left to offer. He is dead inside. Just as dead as his mother.
"It's not their place to say anything. You have the right to be with whoever you want, Harry. If it's Malfoy you want then be it. And they're your friends Harry. If it's Malfoy that makes you happy then they will have to accept it. Because they love you." Ginny says.
The blond finally turns to look at him and stares at harry through his pale blond lashes. He narrows his eyes as if regarding something.
"You will stand in the corner, holding this galleon on the wall with your nose for as long as I say and you will think about what you've done wrong. Understand?" Harry says sternly.
What's the point? What's the point in all of this? Why don't they just kill him and be over with it. He nods regardless. He feels rough hands opening his miuth and pouring ten drops of Veritaserum in his mouth which he dutifully swallows.
"Oh for fuck sake. Thats pretty pathetic and cheap Bulstrode!" She yelled at her.
"From not feeling anything for months to feeling so much of everything at once. It's not, I'm not over it. I still feel as if my head is under water most of the time. It's just, I think, being here helps. So does
"I am a Gryffindor!"
"He is cute." I hear Luna's dreamy voice. I turn back and see she sat besides me. I blush, looking at her. She caught me drooling over Blaise. How do I tell her I like her as well.
Suddenly Bellatrix comes in. "What is this? What happened Cissy?" She asks.
Draco blinks up at him then responds, his hands frozen besides him. "Very well, thank you. And you?"
"The ministry has the right to know when Harry Potter is involved with a death-eater. A Malfoy no less." Kingsley said in a dangerously calm voice.
Harry gets up and pulls Draco up. They both quickly change and Harry drags his submissive but whiney boyfriend who keeps complaining that he didn't get to cum as well as smoke towards the first class.
[I sob.]
"You've veen having sex at least twice a day with different men since a week. Get some rest." Theo sighs.
"Then why did you call me?"
She gave me a tight hug. I was surprised at first but then I hugged her back.
Pansy spun the bottle and it landed on Luna.
Blaise held him close.
"Tell him to leave." Malfoy says with a crack in his voice. Something in Harry's heart clenches more.
Nice.
Draco moans in the kisses and Potter hungrily swallows his moans. He has no trouble believing Potter. This stupid golden boy with his golden words. Words as true as gold. He doesn't doubt Potter's capabilities. Potter always had been capable to make Draco feel the emotions he couldn't. Draco moans as he feels teeth bite hard on the nape of his neck, just below his red collar. Teeth sinking hard in his flesh, sucking, bruising, marking his neck. He always loves the marks and bruises Potter leaves. He knows Potter loves claiming his property. Showing the world Draco belongs to him. That he owns Draco Malfoy. Draco never could understand why Potter would show him off to the world as Potter's property. Each and every person who's had Draco has done so under closed doors, trying not to let out that it's Draco they had. He's always been a dirty little secret. Not something to be paraded around, or be proud of. But Potter does. Potter is proud to have Draco. He owns Draco not just behind closed doors, but out in the world as well. And that's not it. It took a while but Draco does believe, that as much as he belongs to Potter, Potter belongs to him as well. Maybe he always had. Maybe they always did belong to each other.
"Actually, Harry, I should go. Cissa will be waiting as well." Draco said.
"You're going to face worse fate. We'll make sure of that." One man said.
"Harry, we know you feel protective towards Malfoy, given the way of your relationship." Ron said. "But you can't go on attacking people like that."
"Make it stop!" Draco screams.
"What do you think you're doing, Potter?" Draco asks in shallow breaths.
Draco stopped cutting the vegetables and shut his eyes. He took a deep breath, not wanting to break down on the phone. He was always on the verge of breaking down when anyone talked about anything related to marriage. He kept his voice steady as he spoke to Pansy.
"I don't think I can do it." Pansy replies.
"Draco." Harry gives a rueful smile, he's sure that his face is showing the pain in his heart.
"Can't say no when someone is being sexual with him?" Ron asks.
"Potions? Why is a healer here?" Pansy asks.
Slapping (back, buttocks, breasts, genitals, testicles) Strapping (full body beating)
"Bad news?"
"But Harry-"
After the graduation ceremony was over, Mr and Mrs Weasley hugged each one of them. She then took all those Slytherins, Gryffindors and two Ravenclaws to the burrow. They had an eventful lunch filled with laughter and sweet chaos. They all wore their Weasley jumpers. Yes, Belle, Draco, Theo, Blaise and Pansy had their Weasley jumpers as well.
"Funny, isn't it. You're the golden boy, poster boy for the light and I'm the light one between us. You want me to stay pure." Draco said.
"Well, you're kinda late there. I regret being born ever since I was five. Anything else you can do instead?"
This stuns Harry to silence.
"You're overthinking. Shut it." Tori's voice pulled him out of his thoughts. "What about pain? Does there have to be pain?"
"She's pretty and fierce. I'll give her that. And yeah she's nice. But I don't think about her like that. Maybe if I know her more. But right now she's a pretty girl I met. Her hair is so red though. I love redheads."
"What do I do now?"
"Say my safeword or tap my palm or foot three times in fast succession."
"Just tipsy." Draco smiled. "How is it you're oblivious to the world but anything related to me, you notice everything? Your obsession regarding me knows no bounds."
"Parkinson, this is enough. Listen to me before you go blaming-"
"How does it feel?" Potter asks.
Draco can feel his cheeks burn off. He's sure he's red all over his pale face. He looks down on the mattress and give a weak, meeky 'Meow'.
There actually is a newly found breed of pit vipers in Arunachal Pradesh, India and is named after Salazar Slytherin. How the snake got it's name in the chapter is a story by me.
"Draco, I think you'll look really cute in pink. I definitely want to see you in pink." Harry said excitedly. Draco blushed.
"Draco, ever since the day we first met at the robe shop, I always noticed you. For some reason, I always saw you. I noticed smallest of details. Before the second year of Hogwarts I knew that you loved lemon flavoured sweets, the way you picked at the hem of your robes when nervous, your pout when you concentrate, how you would first tap the apple with your fingers near your ear, examine it before you ate it, everything. For so long I suppressed my emotions and labelled them as hate. I did like some other people in between but I always loved you. It was always you. And today, Draco Malfoy, I promise you that you will never find yourself without a family. You will always be my family. I love you." Harry finished his vows.
The Daily Prophet is filled with articles about me. There are articles about me not being a death-eater but a hero, about me being a father to Harry's godchild. In which Harry has said that he's glad I'm raising Teddy and that I'll be a great father. There are articles about Belle and rest of my friends as well. This is a good news. This means that my name is cleared. I'm no longer known as a death-eater but a war hero along with the golden trio. Belle gives me a hug and a kiss on my cheek.
"Then you'll be with us next year." Catherine said.
"Because we're leaving for France in a week. It will be nice for you to get out from the house before that. So you're not suddenly out for France. Get dressed, pet. I've kept your outfit for you near the mirror in the wardrobe." Potter answers.
Y r dey holdn hands?
"I was eating one when Christian asked me for it."
"It will stop, Draco. It will. Somehow or the other, I will make it stop. And I'll do everything to keep you safe so that you don't ever have to go through what those men, those women, those people and your father put you through. And I'll do everything to make you happy." Harry promises him.
"You don't have to worry about it Draco. They have already accepted you in the family as you're my boyfriend. And Ron kind of told them about you, your past, so they don't blame you as well."
"Yes." Potter replied. "Stay with me during break, we'll come back to Hogwarts together. I'd even like to introduce you to my adoptive family."
Everyone sat on their respective seats. Behind the students, sat the parents. Draco had no one left for him. His parents were dead, so was is Aunt Romie. This was a happy day but it felt equally sad. This situation was similar to his Slytherin friends and one particular ravenclaw sister. Theo, Pansy, Blaise and Draco's parents were death-eaters, so they all were left orphan. Belle's parents were killed by death-eaters, so she was left orphan as well. Harry and Hermione had the Weasleys though. What none of them knew is that Molly and Arthur Weasley were here for Draco and his friends as well and not just for the golden trio. Another surprise was that McGonagall was there for them too, and not just as their professor or headmistress.
"Can I fuck your throat?" Harry asks.
"At our place?" Andromeda asks confused.
"Do you promise not to let anyone purposely know that Blaise Zabini will be helping you with the tasks?"
"Can I have one?" Harry asks.
"We started a trend." Teddy kept the conversation going, waiting for James to realise that he was here in the school.
"How lovely!" Astoria sighed dreamily. "Oh Draco, I always knew Potter was a fierce top."
All Draco does his turns his chin away in attitude. Huh. This is new. Draco has never been a brat during the scenes. He definitely never behaved in this demanding and bratty way. Harry can see how the fur is standing up as Draco hisses angrily when Harry refuses to give treats and Harry is not prepared for this. Draco never ever behaved like this during a scene. He is always a good boy. Always obedient. Shall Harry give him the treat? But then it might give Draco the wrong message. Harry isn't sure if he should reach out to Draco again. He has a feeling Draco will bite. If Draco does bite, then the kitten is up for a punishment. Suddenly Harry gets an idea and he snaps his fingers. Two red ropes come out of thin air. One rope ties Draco's elbows together and second rope ties his knees together. Draco gives a surprised yelp and falls down on the bed. Harry then holds him by his hair and Draco looks at him wide eyed. Harry looks back at him with narrowed eyes.
"Listen, I have a lot of work and I'm busy." Darien replies.
Hermione and Ron have the sense to look a bit ashamed.
"Let's all apparate there and then let the dragon lead us." Neville suggest.
He takes me by my hair and slowly takes me towards the bed. He makes me lay on my back. Its uncomfortable to lay like that because my hands are tied behind my back. He removes my panties.
Malfoy's cheeks fill with pink colour on being called as sweetheart. It's endearing and fills Harry with glee. He lays on the bed and extends his arms as an invitation for Malfoy to join him. Which, Malfoy accepts. Malfoy lays on his stomach besides him and places his chin on Harry's chest, his fingers playing with the buttons of Harry's shirt. Harry places his hand on top of Draco's hair and gently massages it, petting it. Malfoy gives a content sigh and Harry makes a mental note of doing it as much as he can.
"I see. Alright. Listen, I will be away for few more days. Don't let her go home." Darien commands.
"Then how the fuck will you be with me, Scorpius?" Rose asks.
"I honestly thInk you should let go for a while if that's the case. I don't want you to go after him now." Nott says.
"You're like an older version of Potter." Draco says and Harry laughs.
They are what they are. Are you alone there?
"Yes I should. I'm going to spoil my little baby." I say looking at Teddy excitedly playing with the new dinosaurs.
Narrowed eyes. Potter is looking at him with narrowed eyes. There are only five times when Potter has looked at Draco with eyes like this. And all those times, Draco had misbehaved. The first time was when Draco had thrashed the dorm room and burnt Potter's bed in Hogwarts. Draco swallows. He gives a faint meow.
"How's the bet going? Its been two weeks, right?" Ginny asks as they walk on the quiditch pitch.
"I think we should first start with getting them safely into the room. We'll try to find out a way to get them out of Hogwarts while doing that." Neville finally says. Ginny and Luna nod.
Pansy, the bitch, gigles. She let's Draco go and with a last kiss, she leaves Draco alone. Draco scowls at Longbottom.
Theo and Ginny went to speak to McGonagall. She immediately granted permission.
"Yes I am." Says Cormac.
Blaise broke the kiss and rested his forehead on hers.
"Good news?" Pansy sighs.
"Teddy, do you want toys?" I ask him.
Harry's there, sitting on his motorcycle wearing leather jacket, hair tied in a bun.
Malfoy sings the entire song, his eyes never leaving Harry's.
They sat on the outside setting of the small cafe while looking at menus.
"That I was, in fact, not under any curse or potion. That being with Draco Malfoy is my concious decesion. You know what that means?" Harry asked.
Draco saw that burning intensity in Potter's eyes. Eyes that look at you like that can not lie.
He can see Malfoy's scowl turn into worry, concern and fear. Harry chuckles.
Millicent narrows her eyes and then splashes the wall paint on Cormac.
Harry sits on the bed, and closes his eyes. He's aware that Draco is still on the floor, on his hands and knees, waiting. He hears a hesitant 'meow' and smirks. He opens his eyes and turns to look at Draco who's looking at him with huge expectant grey eyes.
"Draco?" Pansy asks.
Malfoy ignores her and continues sipping his wine. Lavender gives a tired sigh and looks at Hermione unamused.
"Nicholas Barnes. I'm a chef in French wizarding world." The man replies.
"God give me patience to not kill anyone today." She said taking a deep breath. "Yes Potter. Antidote. He's been given love potion. So fucking take him to Slughorn." She almost yelled.
Draco raised an eyebrow in question. He mused how Potter said he wished he could do the 'one eyebrow thing' as that heathen called it. Probably not a good time to be musing things, Draco mused. People were surrounding them now, to watch the show and Draco knew that no one will help them. These four were the extremists of Potter's fanclub. Others were in the fanclub as well but had sense to stay out of Potter's business.
Draco gave a small smile and nodded.
"Zacharias Smith broke up with his girlfriend."
"He made me take many oaths after our so called matrimony. Most of it were when I tried to free myself. One of the loyalty oaths mentions that if Lucius were to ever decease, I am to as well. And it isn't pretty. I am to lock myself up in our dungens and starve myself to death after the funeral is done. And in case there is no chance for funeral, I have to do it anyway." Narcissa answers. She waits a few seconds for the answer to sink in. "My husband is a vile man. He has no soul. Half of the things he does to me is just for the sake of pleasure and entertainment. He loves the power he has over me. Breathes in it. He might not be as easy to take down as the others were. There was a reason he was Dark Lord's right hand."
Cormac realises what he wants. He removes the key to his flat and places it on the table in front of Darien.
"Oh yeah. About that. Potter do you mind bunking with me? My home isn't as big as Malfoy Manor and we all have used up rooms for us. There isn't any spare room left." Theo asks.
Pansy knocks at Cormac's door. Cormac opens the door and stairs at Pansy, panick clear in his eyes.
"You. Anything. Please." Draco says and Harry kisses his shoulder after dragging the blouse aside.
Harry takes a deep breath.
Draco entered the France Manor and he felt the wards around him, sending a shiver down his spine. He was to wait outside until he was called upon by Potter. And now was the time. With a pounding heart, he walked into the sitting room and stopped dead on his tracks with a gasp. There, in the middle, was his father, tied up in a chair. With little to no marks or scars. Oh no. This won't do. Draco spent his entire life full of emotional and physical scars. His father has to have some before he dies. He looks at his father, his pride broken on his face and red eyes.
Draco sighes. Well, this should be interesting. But it has to wait as Draco is extremely tired. He goes in his dorm, has a quick shower, wears his girly shorts and a tshirt, puts on silk bedsheets on the bed that is near the window and goes to sleep.
"You are?" Marina asks surprised.
Draco Malfoy knows he is hated. He knows half of the people will not sympathize with a Malfoy. He knows there are people who still think he should be in azkaban or dead. He enters the platform of Hogwarts express, looks around, smirks at the glares of people and gives a particular wink to one of the haters. But glares are not all he gets. He gets looks of surprises, gaping mouths and looks of lust as well. He is not just Draco Malfoy anymore. He is free Draco Malfoy. Gaping and lustfull looks also might have to do with him wearing extremely tight leather pants, hoop earrings and platinum blond hair a bit longer than his shoulder. No longer sleak back with gel, but left out loose with slight waves and lipgloss. He walks among his friends and climbs the train to the Slytherin slot.
"Bath or shower?" Draco asks.
"Strip." He orders. I obey and start undressing myself.
"A little while more, darling." Harry replies.
Draco looked him in the eyes before he spoke. "Potter, I don't need a date to be ready for you. It was you Potter. It was always you. I'm ready."
"This is my home you know. I can walk wherever I want to." I spit.
"Can you tell me what happened next?" The prosecutor asks.
"I'll help you pack." Luna says.
Theo Draco and Blaise laughed.
"S.P.E.W. Ronald. And I'll ask Harry to make you his next victim if you don't refer to it correctly." She smirks.
"Like how?" Draco asks, even though he knows the answer.
"Ginny." Theo said. "There's this girl I really like. Do you think I should ask her out?" He asked.
"Mother!" I called. I searched for her. Mother and Father were searching for me. I ran to my mother and hugged her.
"You should thank me. You should bloody well thank me because I am not beneath you in anything. If I want to work, I still can and earn twice as you do and you're very well aware of this fact. And I still take care of the finance regarding the children, their education and turors. You wouldn't be able to afford it all if I didn't. And don't forget who took care of the house and the bills. It was me, with the money I earned, not even needing my inheritance while you were setting up your startup. So don't ever talk to me like that!" Draco yelled and took a breath after a choked sob. "The cake is in the storage room on statis. Happy anniversary." Draco said and left the living room, slamming the door behind him.
"He'd take me to Dumbledore. I never trusted that old coot."
"Stay, Hera, stay, please stay." He begs as he reaches St Mungos, yelling for a healer.
"Don't look at me like that. There's nothing wrong with learning basic etiquettes. It helps you remain graceful and keep your head held high even when you are completely not together. Also it is basic manners one must learn. You're a Malfoy now, you have to be graceful." Draco explained.
"What do you want, pet?" Harry asks.
After the Gryffindors were done, it was now the turn of Ravenclaws.
Draco can feel the flush rising on his neck and the cheeks burning off. Potter has to stop claiming Draco or he's going to do something stupid. Like kiss him. Or fall in love."
"Pansy? You are brave and amazing. You're are all the right things that your parents weren't. But its more than that, isn't it?" Luna says softly, stroking Pansy's back.
The day passes so slow and I can't stop thinking about that child. I rarely eat anything the entire day and I sleep only for like two or three hours. I can't stop thinking about that child. What is he going through? Is he alive? In the morning when I go to the great hall for the breakfast I try to find Draco. He isn't there. I look over at Pansy and she shakes her head. I understand immediately. That boy is dead. I can't think of anything but let a soft sob escape my face. Will this ever end?
She looks like she's ready to bolt . She bites her lips, clasps and unclasps her hands in front of her, looking down.
"You'll see."
"Stay here okay. I'll be back in a minute. I'll be locking the door from out so Ginny or Astoria don't come in." Harry says and waits for Draco to nod.
"Why were you talking about McLaggen?" Ron asked.
He's glad that Malfoy has people to take care of him. Who care such great deal about him just like Harry's friends care for him. He receives a warm hug from Daphne, oh yes, that's her name, and nods and handshakes from others.
"Proper food first Draco. You can always have deserts later." Harry reprimands Draco.
“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does… I am the true master of the Elder Wand.”
He feels Potter hold him tighter and kiss his temple and then just above the well worn red collar..
"No." Draco said in a soft voice.
"Why can't you say no? Why don't you understand that you have a choice? You can say no Malfoy. Why is it you think you can't?" Harry pesters.
We don't have any option. Bee we have you. You have been friends with the good side and you can vouch for us. But I understand if it doesn't make much difference. We have made our bed. And I will at least my heart will be at peace during my last moments knowing what I did was right.
Draco catches Astoria by hand and leads her to his room, practically running away from there. Once in the room, Astoria gracefully sits on his bed.
Remind me to throw a party for Molly that day. I got your homework. On my way.
Draco screams. He screams and he screams and he screams
"Why can't you understand I can't say no! I can't! I can't!" He yells after screaming and dashes of the room.
"I'm sorry, Harry, I'm so sorry. I feel so cheap. I feel so, I don't want to become what my husband has. I feel like a slut. I feel like a slut. Please, Harry please." Draco sobs and turns to run away.
"Already did." Draco replies.
"Ha Harry, puh puh please, ha Harry." Draco sobs.
Hey guys yeah I'm fine. Didn't feel like eating so I skipped lunch. Guess what. Ginny found a way out of the castle through RoR. Neville and Luna will be checking it now. I'm going to go select a kid to help escape.
"She was a good woman. May her soul rest in peace." Mr Olivander says as he hugs Draco. Draco hugs him back.
"Not really. The person I'm looking for is not here. So, goodbye. Shut your mouth Potter, the flies are making home there." Malfoy said, turned and left.
"Are you going to keep repeating words or can we leave?" Harry chuckles.
"Yes."
"Bee. Are we okay?" He asks. There it is. The question we can't avoid anymore.
"The job maybe."
"No one should speak about that insane bint."
'yes.'
She threw it at you prongs fff
"Are you sure? I'll drop you." Harry says.
"So am I. It really is over." Draco sighs.
I am so punk rock!
"I'd honestly like to give you a fighting chance." He says to deflect his confusion.
Hi Bee. Didn't see you at lunch today. You okay?
"Remember the walking classes? Those were the worst." Theo said.
"Bad news?"
"Well, that was interesting." Neville tipped and Ginny laughed.
"Who told you?"
Draco wasn't. He wanted to run back to Hogwarts or maybe Theo's manor. Anywhere but here. He stood in front of the gates of Malfoy Manor. Along with his personal valts, he had also got the manor. He would rather not have it but now that he did, he didn't know what to do with it. All he knew is that he couldn't live here. There were so many terrible memories. Rarely any happy ones. He swallowed a lump in his throat. Behind him, a bunch of curse breakers stood, led by Bill Weasley. He wanted to get rid of every terrible thing his family and the death-eaters had filled the manor with. He felt Potter take his hand.
"Yes, I heard. Keep me informed. I have a meeting now. You'll have at least two investors by the end of it." Darien replies.
"I'll free you from him, Narcissa. Even if I have to die for it." Nicholas exhaled.
"But Sir, she'll be discharged tomorrow morning. Where will she go?"
Harry's jeans immediately tightened as his cock expanded at the thought of Draco calling him Master. A reaction, Harry never thought he would have. He's never had much that he owns and the fact that Draco is now his, all his, willingly submitting and calling him Master, had an increasing amount of effect on him. He's pretty sure that Draco can feel his reaction too, the smirk on his face shows it.
"You want to watch how you look, kitten?" Potter asks and Draco eagerly immediately nods.
"Men go in priesthood, you dumbass. Why?"
"I'm fine Pans." Draco tells her.
"Gin, how long are you due?" Blaise asked.
He saw Christian's face fall as his eyes roamed around the red collar he was wearing and then he gave Draco a small smile.
"Please. I'm so close. Please." I beg.
Wax Play
Harry along with Ron, Hermione, Bill, Ginny and Andromeda, leaves the court. They are immediately bombarded by the press but not just the press. He is met by a group of Slytherins. Parkinson immediately comes and holds his cheeks.
