"Not that it is any of your business. At all." Harry nodded. It was an obvious point. "But this is the first time in a very long time that I could be…"
can’t like you. And I’m beginning to see why.”
Harry struggled to breathe. “Malfoy’s gone? I just thought he’d cleaned up his desk, that he—” Wanted to mock me. Force me to see him day in and day out.
Robards’s laugh had a mean edge to it, and a bit of Harry curled in on itself.
“Well, I’m glad to hear it. Mostly.” She gave him a brief look of disapproval before setting out in front of him. “And I’ll catch up with you at home.”
“What would I say? ‘Happy Christmas, you git’? Much more satisfying in person.”
“Alright, alright.” Draco’s foot arched and searched for Harry’s in the water. Finding him, he stepped close enough to bump noses. The steam curled around them and Draco’s dressing gown, saturated and heavy, swelled at Harry’s knees.
It took several minutes to spot the house. A hundred feet further out, wood as pale as the sand stuck out from the ground to support the remaining tiles of a sagging roof. Space separated each slat like the gaps of a ribcage. There were no doors or windows, just empty frames that opened into a shadowed interior.
They walked together to Level Two.
was why you should know better than to get your hopes up—
Draco heard the voice clearly in his mind. He shook his head.
Draco nodded eventually, steps taking him to the drink cart in the corner. “Certainly.” He shook himself back to the present. “And do make yourself at home.” At the suggestion, Harry winked and stretched wide, sliding an arm around the back of the couch.
Harry shook his head. “Not in any specific terms. I feel like, it'd be fine either way. If I stay home for a while, not a problem. There’s a restaurant I’m quite keen to try nearby. And if I get a case abroad, I get to avoid helping you move.”
Thirty-seven deliveries later, feet aching, Draco left Subspace again for the desert and made straight for Potter’s house. The Deniden sat on the side of the lane this time, and much farther from the house. Its scales restrained themselves to purples and blues. Draco met its gaze and paused. Despite the distance, the dark of the house reached for him, stronger than the day before.
Potter tapped his wand in a steady beat under Draco’s jawline. His hands smelled like earth and iron. “Does the Ministry have any idea you're delivering packages? Because I bet they don't. And I doubt they’d like it.”
Ginny hmmed. “And you’re doing alright now you’re in that guest room? Merlin knows how you can walk around it with that giant bed in there.”
Pansy picked up the package and gave it a shake. “Please tell me you got him something outrageous, like personalized bed sheets that say ‘The Next Mr. Malfoy.’”
“Is that why you joined International Operations?” Malfoy didn’t look at him as he asked, but Harry felt his full attention run down his spine.
Harry took his glasses off and cleaned them to avoid knocking things off every surface in swinging distance. "But couldn’t he just wait for the next one?”
Potter was speaking again: “And thanks, by the way, for showing up. I’ve done big ones like this before, but there was so much awful in the crevices, it caught me off guard. It had to be a family here, or some kind of group. Anyway, I might have used some of your power to, er, finish the job. That’s why you’re so weak now. Sorry for that, but it’ll pass in a day or two.”
The blond went on: “Well. That is much more believable than you actually having an interest in surveillance theory. It really has nothing to do with the hullabaloo from my portkey application?”
Harry didn’t bother sitting when they reached their seats at Ginny’s Quidditch game. Teddy was already on his feet and jumping near the rails, so Harry kept close in case he needed to stop a fall or answer questions or tease him. Their box was reserved for players’ families: Ginny hadn’t taken back his seats when they’d broken up. He could’ve purchased new ones if forced to, but then Teddy wouldn’t have the other players’ children to hang out with. Worse, it would put them in the middle of strangers who would inevitably be more distracted by Harry than the game. This kept it an experience he could share with Teddy whenever he came home, to give Teddy the Wizarding childhood Harry imagined for himself sometimes. And it felt good to see Ginny play and be settled on a team. It had taken so much longer than they expected for her to move off the reserves. Their condo had burst with the elation of her immediate placement after graduation with the reserves for the Falmouth Falcons, and a picture of in her uniform had sat at Harry’s desk. But after a few years, as the spot on the reserves roster continued, he’d turned the picture around. It reflected only disappointment by then, little helped by an injury that side-lined her for half a season. Though you’d never know it from watching her now. She flew like she’d never done anything else.
we were going to get there, I would’ve abandoned you at the bar.” Malfoy pulled down the collar of his jumper, refusing to take off his jacket. Inviting a group of intoxicated wizards to trek a steeply angled pavement did seem the perfect invitation for trouble. But the houses were a charming variety of colours, and from his angle, he could tell just how flattering Malfoy’s clothes were for his figure, so Harry wasn’t complaining.
The first time Draco delivered a package to Harry Potter was not the first time Draco had tried.
I’m me. No one will listen.”
“She gives her opinions pretty freely.”
“What… are you doing here?” The wings began to flutter. Loose sheets of paper fell free of Draco’s desk and arced in the air. Pens rolled off his side table. Then the Deniden’s eyes glowed emerald green, and Draco knew.
This was Harry’s chance to go to the conference without him. To get the time he needed to think things over. Malfoy’s name flashed in his mind, a hazy scribble on The List.
“Sounds nuts, man,” Dave said, sitting back. “My family grew up in Denver, and it freaked us the fuck out when that happened. School’s supposed to be safe, y’know? Or at least it was. Not really so novel now.”
“Malfoy?”
Harry laughed. When he put it that way, it didn’t seem so bad.
“Is that a Chelsea bun? I’d love some.” Draco blinked up at Harry’s hand reaching to the plate. At some point in Draco’s mini-crisis, Harry had crossed the room to him. After biting into one and holding it between his teeth, Harry took the tray from Draco’s hand. “Drinks,” he asked, settling into the middle of Draco’s couch.
“They did not! Oh, I’ll be so upset, especially when they wouldn’t let me put ‘Posh Git, Extraordinaire.’” The distance between them disappeared as Harry crowded beside him, grasping Draco’s hand to pull it back away from the tag.
“Did you know they’ve got a prison floating out there?” Malfoy pressed his finger to the glass.
Harry rocked onto the back legs of the guest chair in Robards’s office. The Head Auror was late, which was annoying—Harry’d cut his lunch with Hermione short to make it back in time. He’d done fine, that morning, it turned out. She appreciated the chance to think things through (and loved, loved,
“And that doesn’t bother you at all, does it?” Malfoy asked, pulling Harry back to the moment. “To work for an organisation that looked at my family at the end of the War and thought a few years of solitude on our family estate was punishment enough?”
“Auror Potter. Harry. Is all of your proof from Auror Malfoy himself?”
Bleary-headed, Draco rose with the sun. In his dreams, he’d found Potter face down and bare in that front room. Shadows from the wooden slats arched over Potter’s twisted spine, caging him in place, as the scorpion crawled the length of a tattooed thigh. On the wall, a painting of Mother and Father replaced the photograph. The oils melted in the heat.
Harry laughed, cradling his chin in a hand. “Sounds like that’s asking more of you than the Ministry. Not sure many people in that office work half as much as you do now.”
He’d done this. Whatever he could tell himself about Malfoy and the office, he couldn’t put this on someone else.
Draco had become more daring the last few weeks, finding his own initiative between them. Rolling his shoulders to ride along the shiver in his spine, Harry let his hands slide down to Draco’s and then lead them back up to the edges of his dressing gown.
“And I’ll happily be involved in getting them brought to justice,” she replied, unaffected by his argument. Harry worked through his files with an extra fervor, riled by the censure. He was doing his best to make up for it now. They’d see. And he’d make it through the files this weekend without them just fine. Ginny didn’t have a game that weekend, so his only non-work commitment was some time at the park with Teddy on Sunday.
“So, you’re from England, right? The Ministry, or something?” Dave took out each item from his lunch box and set them out in front of him before he began to dig in. Harry watched the deliberate movements, then caught up that he’d been asked a question.
She laughed at him. “Oh, I know, Harry. I brought it up exactly because you wouldn’t ask. You do realise that even friends talk about the bad things going on in their lives, right? It’s not just relationships that can’t survive when you pretend everything’s alright?”
“But if you haven’t read the files,” Draco began, sealing his suitcase shut. “How do you know what they’ve been up to?”
She waved that off. “Please, we both know those anonymous owls are ninety-nine percent hogwash. He did his house arrest. Doing all that manual labor should probably count as extra punishment. I can’t imagine having to read that much public nonsense and gossip.” Her next gesture almost sent the yoghurt carton flying again. Harry shrugged. She was well and truly going now. He’d been gone too long. Things were clearly building. “And did they have to give his Department such a ridiculous name? ‘The CRAPI Department,’ honestly. It’s at least unkind to the public.”
Forcing himself to focus, Draco tried to suss out Potter amongst the fray. His magic was everywhere, filling the valley that the compound occupied. But its strongest point came from the main house.
Harry shifted further back against the sofa cushions to get a better look at him. The usually perfect coif of Malfoy blonde had mussed under the cap Draco had to wear, and his skin looked flushed, a little shiny: a familiar look, after this long. Harry tugged at the edge of the jacket nearest to him. “Maybe I should mention it, just in case. Might help me understand better.”
As they bickered, Hermione caught his eye. “The rest of your day go okay? Other than all of this?”
Hermione chewed on one of the churros, considering. She’d stretched out on the couch near them to observe. “Mm, nothing terribly eventful. Work is—” She paused to look at Ron, who offered “Same old Ministry bollocks wasting your time?” before she looked back at Harry and shrugged, giving him a look this time before focusing back on her food. “—Work. Nothing of interest there.”
“But it’s not better for me,” he said, annoyed at how much it sounded like whinging. “There are a lot of capable adults in the Auror Department. And the world at large. I don’t have to solve everything.”
“Alright, Malfoy, I’ll buy those pants—one for Ron and a pair for myself—if you buy one of those chocolate covered willy biscuits right now and eat it.”
“You’re finally awake,” Potter said.
“You see, I think a person only gets access to… to…” Harry’s free hand had slid down, tugging the tie back and forth to loosen its tongue. “To so much happiness and—”
, this hurts.” Harry pulled his hand back and his skin had flushed a bright red where the blood was starting to return.
The following Monday, Harry stopped by Robards’ office to let him know that yes, he would go to the conference. He sat at his desk after that to finish the last of his outstanding reports. Watching the files go down, closer and closer to the desk’s surface, felt like a countdown. Once he finished, he could see the faded wood of his desk for the first time in years, could almost make out his reflection in the veneer, after a quick clean. Ready for a new occupant level of clean. His gaze averted quickly, only to fall on the bottom shelf of his file cabinet. The pile of Malfoy’s unread memos seemed to pulse.
“Wait, did you even finish your education?”
“A good Healer could probably sort him out, but otherwise, it has to be the caster who withdraws the jinx. Of course I’d have to be somewhere in his vicinity to do so… and I really have no need to cross paths with him again.”
Draco’s heart sank at the innocent question, delivered with simple curiosity but also intrusive enough to have him feeling helplessly cornered. He struggled to stem down the swell of anxiety that had bubbled up inside him and Charlie’s smile began to dim as his question remained unanswered.
“Don’t forget cute.”
“Wotcher, Malfoy.” George’s eyes glittered wickedly. “Ticklish, are we?”
“You ready?”
“Is this your first time taking the tube?” Potter asked him as they passed through the gates.
?” Percy had been fidgety and deep in thought all evening, barely speaking a word, but the mention of peacocks seemed to have shaken him out of his silence.
“Don’t mind at all,” he managed to grit out.
“It was a bloody brilliant catch too,” George called out from the other side of the room and nearly upset his drink over Angelina. Draco lifted his own glass in salute.
“Relax, Malfoy,” Potter laughed. “I meant that sometimes I stay back at the Academy to get in some more duelling practice. Or I go out late with Gin and the others.”
Draco considered this. “Do you really think it’d make the papers?” he asked.
“It’s okay,” Potter spoke up softly, and his voice was reassuring and so,
Draco smiled fondly as the two began to bicker; Blaise taunting half-heartedly and Pansy replying with heat. It almost made it feel as if everything was normal; as if nothing had changed, even when Draco knew that he couldn’t fool himself no matter how hard he tried.
“Oh, thank you!” Bob shook his hand vigorously. “I’ll be sure to remember you for all times.”
Draco could feel his patience rapidly reaching its limit and he willed himself not to snap as he replied with a brief, “A scarf.”
. To make matters worse, Draco wasn’t even drawn to Potter on a solely physical level; he’d begun to miss his company
Draco drew back slowly, bringing a hand to cover his mouth. He didn’t know why but he was happy. So happy. He’d never known that a single word could make him feel like he’d been given the world. Could make him feel worthwhile and wanted and
“I’m tired, Mother.”
Draco’s shoulders slumped. Sometimes Potter could be so dense it wasn’t even funny anymore.
Potter took a warning step closer. “You better watch yourself, Malfoy.” And his voice oozed authority. Must have been something they were taught in Auror training.
“Draco, I swear to god, I will smack you so hard you’re pretty face will have the mark for a week if you don’t stop faffing about and tell us what hap–”
Draco kisses him again, sweet chaste pecks until they are both smiling against each other’s mouths. They end up cuddled against the fireplace, Draco somehow ending in Harry’s lap, and he relishes in the warm weight of him against it. They sit like that for a while, and Harry has one hand stroking at Draco’s neck over his pulse point. He can feel the rapid beat of his heart gradually slowing down to a steady thrum.
Ron shook his head, his smile turning tight. “I’m sure you do.”
Across the room, the door opened up and a different official led Malfoy past the processing desks and toward where Harry was seated.
“Yes, but I’m a better cheat.”
“Godric’s Hollow. What if you never get strong enough to bring it back?”
“Good night, Harry,” she said, waving behind her. He watched the door close. Brilliant. His friends were devious, but brilliant.
Checking his pocket again for his wand, he traveled through Subspace and braced himself at the exit. Just ten more minutes, and he’d return to his crap but uneventful life.
Potter summoned a small mortar and pestle through one of the window’s gaps.
“Come on,” he said to the Deniden and reached for his wand. Then the compound pulsed. Every door and window shattered outward, the light grew brighter, and Draco’s Mark
“Me?” Draco tried to sit up, but his body refused. He settled for a stern gaze. “You’re the one with the murder houses and dark rituals. My assumptions are very, very normal.”
Robards leaned back again and sighed.
Andromeda focused her dark eyes on him, her fingers squeezing the handle of her mug. "Isn't my nephew on that list of yours?"
Pansy’s eyes, darkened at the edges with kohl, narrowed at him. “Of course he does.”
Hermione and Ron gave him a pitying look.
Malfoy shook his head and explained: “Too many people at the bar. And you still have my drink.” The statement sounded casual enough, but Harry saw the tightness in his jaw and posture. Definitely a thing about crowds. Strangers, too, maybe.
Her next toss nicked him in the head.
He laughed at the sour look on her face. She went on: “I didn’t enjoy them as a young woman, and I’d like them even less now. Why do you ask?”
Harry avoided eye contact as he left the lift, almost barrelling past Susan Bones when she tried to catch him on his way.
“So how’s Luna, then?” he asked, dropping the collected bludger into the case she offered. He’d seen some press coverage about the two of them in one of his Quidditch mags. He’d have asked about it at The Burrow this trip, but she’d been too busy to attend any of the brunches.
“I keep everyone’s secrets except yours, Potter, I couldn’t tell you if I wanted. Though the many properties you are inexplicably gifted from dying members of our society… is noteworthy, to say the least.”
Robards looked him over. “I’m listening.”
Harry stopped struggling, the curl in his mouth softening from its mild irritation into some kind of frustrated amusement. Draco could feel the warmth of Harry’s hand where it settled near Draco’s ribs. If he took a big enough breath, he could press back against it. Seek it.
Harry squinted at him, then put on his glasses. He stared at Draco's name, embroidered in scripted blue font over the left breast of the uniform jacket. "Because you're a chef now?"
“Your job is way too lame for that.” She stuck her tongue out, then tossed the case further to the sidelines. “Luna’s doing fine. She travels a lot, but so do I, so it works out fairly well. We make the most of our time together when we get it. Though we’ve been talking about Christmas, since it’s our first one together, and it’s gotten kind of contentious.” She watched Harry start shuffling his feet before continuing. “Luna wants to spend it with her father. Obviously, I should go to The Burrow. I’m on thin ice enough as it is, missing ninety percent of the brunches this year. I don’t know. What do you think?”
Draco settled his arms in front of him so he could interlace his fingers. “This is it. Bachelor’s Eve.” Draco cleared his throat. “Just the two of us left.”
He tossed his rubbish, selected the Ministry package from his list, and entered the white door that appeared beside him. It closed on its own, creaking before it silenced the echoing sounds of the crowd and nearby traffic. Now, in the dark of Subspace and the path to his next destination, a quiet classical theme played. The cold caressed his face as he skated down the path in time to the adagio tempo.
“No problem. I saw the headline. Shocking news, I always took you for a Chocolate Frogs kind of guy.” One look at her face said she was taking the piss. He shook his head and let her go. “Anyway, chocolate controversy aside, I wanted to let you know Robards was looking for you earlier. Might want to pop in when you have a chance.”
"Anyway, as I was saying," Draco went on, talking over Harry’s complaints about treatment of his property, "you are officially dating a self made man." He spread his arms out wide to put his uniform on full display.
"As anything,” Robards said, eyes narrowing. “Someone thought they were very clever and submitted his portkey paperwork with the Death Eater affiliation noted. MACUSA continues to be extremely sensitive to terrorist affiliations. The damn thing took my weekend and half this week to get it sorted, and believe you-me, there will be consequences once I find out who it was.” Robards stared at his closed office door to the bullpen beyond it.
Harry nodded. “Guess you’re right then.” He let his foot toe-heel up the sofa’s back until he could nudge at Draco with it. Once Draco finally looked at him, Harry smiled. “I am dating a self-made man.”
“So it seems.” Draco futzed with his empty glass. “It’s going to make her a terrible solicitor. She’ll be nothing if she doesn’t build up some discretion.”
“What are you doing?”
Malfoy set his own tote back on the room’s desk, laying it flat. “The Headlands and Beach Tour.”
Harry sank back into his seat. The files seemed to stare back at him, as they had most of the week. As they had from the bottom drawer of the file cabinet where he’d left them (and forgotten them, really) for ages. It made sense, he reasoned, in some horrible, twisted way that they’d mean fuck all the minute he started to pay attention to them.
Harry fully smiled now. “I’ll let her know.”
“Some things are worth waiting for, yeah?”
When Harry stepped through the doors into the appointed conference room, he saw Malfoy seated near the middle of the first row.
“Isn’t that the point of a cocktail hour.” Harry tried not to wince at the watered down mouthful of his drink. “To talk to people?” He handed over Malfoy’s glass.
Harry felt for where his scar would normally show. His skin had itched where he thought Malfoy might touch him. “It’s like I said, it’s kind of a uniform. Gets my mindset right. Protects my team, just in case. Though it’s more about how I see me, I guess, than other people. ” Harry leaned in closer. Malfoy watched, leaning in some himself. “Except you cheated, because you didn’t answer my question earlier—not seriously. Is it like a punishment thing, keeping you at that desk? It’s a waste of talent, for sure, given all this stuff you’re learning here. What you could do.” He broke the connection to take a few swallows of his margarita. “You did your house arrest. That had to be punishment enough.”
Harry’s hands clenched. “So do lots of people! Charity funders. Teachers. At least rotate us. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m late for work.”
“She’s right,” Ron added, directing the various takeout boxes toward the bin. “I imagine it’ll keep the office plenty busy to work through all the matters you’ve put together so far. You can leave the rest with ‘Mione’s office, they can close it out.”
Robards considered him. “They’re senior enough that I don’t have much reason to question their judgment.”
was the crap department, covered as it was with papers and files all the time. Except it didn’t make sense for it to be Jenkins because the memo arrived after eleven p.m. (Jenkins never stayed past six), and Harry was the only person still in the bullpen. Other than Malfoy. It was always the two of them late in the pen, then; at least when Harry was working in England. Malfoy had graduated from the Auror Training Program eight months earlier. And while Harry avoided ever learning what exactly Malfoy did—he never wore Auror robes, despite the location of his desk—the man was there doing it by the time Harry arrived in the morning and was still doing it by the time that Harry left.
Harry set his luggage down on the floor. “Doesn’t bother me to share with another bloke.” When Malfoy looked at him this time, he kept doing so. His gaze didn’t quite meet Harry’s eyes, but got close.
The walk to his desk was a long one. That Malfoy wouldn’t take his job back, it didn’t... He hadn’t considered—Harry paused in the aisle leading to his desk.
“And Robards didn’t let you know when you’d be going out again?”
There was nothing left to do after that. He was fine at Transfiguration, but he rather liked the bed as it was.
So he wasn’t dead. Whether that was a good thing, he didn’t know.
This close, Harry smelled fresh, like the woods, the pine trees at the edge of the Manor’s grounds.
“You don’t have to go. They don’t give credits for the optional happy hour.”
Hermione made an effort to flatten his hair down before she summoned another set of glasses and cast an Aguamenti into each. “For this? I suppose he might be.”
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed a moment beneath his fringe. It still needed a cut. Malfoy also did a poor job of avoiding the other pedestrians, occasionally checking shoulders with black clad figures focused on their iPhones, and flinching away when others got too close. Harry’d read about the iPhone during his research before the trip—just released and all the rage apparently.
It had been his compass for almost six years. He looked over “Destiny,” the events themed around him. Not everything had to go.
“Hogwarts,” Malfoy said, voice gone quiet.
Harry focused on the video advertisement playing on the small television screen above the lift numbers. He wasn’t the one who’d needed convincing to come to this. The screen showed a golden bridge behind some scrolling text about rock bottom interest rates on mortgages.
?” Harry kept his amusement to himself.
"Just what I said. I want you to stop following me. It’s distracting me from—” He forced himself not to cringe. “From my work. And it’s sharing a lot of information with enemies of this country in a manner that’s interfering with the safety of all of us. Including me. So if you’ll just give me your cards, I’ll pass them on to my assistant, Ms. Crookshanks, and we can start arranging proper interviews or press releases once in a while. But otherwise I’d appreciate if—actually, I insist that you start focusing on something else. The people of this country need to know about more than what candy bar I like to eat, for Merlin’s sake.”
Ginny turned to him, face flushed and still aglow from the game. She scanned his face and her smirk grew a little wider. “Pretty effective that way, I’ve found.” She started to peel off some of her kit, the leather smell heavy in the air, then bent down to collect some of the warm up brooms. As one of the junior members of the team, sorting things after the game often fell to her. “Though in my defense, I’d have had a harder time trying to schedule it while you were in town. It was nothing personal. Timing just worked out better that week.”
Harry looked over the schedule. The first day offered nothing but a series of lectures. He made an effort for the first session, powered by the caffeine rushing through him. He was doodling by the second half of it, and the session that followed. He spent most of the third reviewing case notes he had placed among the conference binder’s pages. The DMLE was using them for trial next month and had a number of questions about how to interpret his chicken scratch handwriting. The other attendees around him were rapidly taking notes—he didn’t have to worry about his own frequent writing giving him away.
Andromeda’s elegant laugh rang sharply in the kitchen. “I think you’ve handled worse.”
Jenkins shrugged. “I ‘magine the boss’ll mention it to you when you chat.”
Harry waved his hand and the curtains from the windows slowly drew to the side, letting in light from the cloudless night outside. In the lighting, Draco looked otherworldly, his skin fair but flushed against the other earth tones of his surroundings. His eyes were closed, shut tight below his drawn brows. Harry let his hands fall down to his sides.
Thank you so much for reading. I've never made a piece this long before (it was scary), and I dove so deeply into this Harry and Draco for this story, and the world even before this part of their journey. It's bittersweet to reach the end, but it means so much to be a part of, and contribute to this fandom. Readers make it worthwhile, and I truly hope you enjoyed it!
“It’s an interesting place. I’m glad I got to see it. Not sure when I’ll get the chance, next.”
“Well, I appreciate your coming in on the last day before you leave,” Robards said, as though Harry hadn’t said anything. “I know that there’s a lot to take care of before going out in the field like that.”
Harry did. He kept his mouth shut.
“Malfoy?”
Pansy was looking at him again. Her steely gaze always had a certain weight to it. He flicked at the shining edges of the gold wrapped gift on the bartop. The wood had been polished so smooth, the box made several rotations before it stilled again, moving slightly toward her. A distraction.
“Here you go. Sure it’s just you that’s going to eat all of this? I’d imagine just a few scraps of bread could fill you right up.” The woman—the owner, he’d learned—set out a pot of oil and two more with cheese, followed by an artful display of meat and bread. The scents warmed him down to his bones.
He’d liked working for her. She was young and creative. Loyal to her team, protecting them against critics wondering why they needed foriegn aid, why they hadn’t found the agitators themselves. The implication about England, though, had twisted at him, a mix of resentment and guilt, so he’d put the offer out of his mind in retaliation. Ron and Hermione, the Weasleys, Teddy and Andy: they were family. He’d told them he would always come back, and he would: tosh on her for implying otherwise.
“Is that what you really think about my house arrest?”
“Whenever you’re ready.”
Robards waved the response away, his other hand resting on the swell of his stomach. “I don’t care about the timing, that's no bother. This conference might be good for you, actually, given the shift of things. Cases are going to be a lot less on the ground in the future, and a lot more staring at screens and charts, if the policy papers are to be believed. Keen observation skills will still be important, but the means are changing. Not that it'll solve everything to sit on our duffs, but—" He whirled his hand in a small circular gesture, trailing off.
Harry wiped off his hands on his jeans. “I don’t know. And—” He dug for it, the other reason, past the grey eyes, the lingering taste of him somehow identifiable despite a tangy beer. “I’ve also got a case at the office I’ve been putting off. I think it might be better for me to wrap that one up before I leave. To make it a clean break.”
Because that was what happened, wasn’t it, when Harry got too close to things. Got involved. He burned himself out. He learned way more of another person’s problems than he ever needed to. And nothing ever got better.
“Sure, take a seat.” A few women, including Malfoy’s dark-haired front row buddy, had settled at the opposite end of the round table. She spoke in Spanish with the woman next to her. Harry tried to tune it out, his brain already translating, and focused instead on the man’s badge. Dave. He should’ve remembered that by now.
He settled in, coffee in hand, and scribbled out a post to the Spanish Ministry contact about his availability for an interview in a week’s time. That gave enough time to wrap things up. With what he already knew about Jenkins and Flemings, he didn’t anticipate it taking long to get through everything’d Malfoy’d put together.
Warm from the fire and food, Potter’s eyes drifted closed. “If what never happens?”
It took Harry a few mindless jabs, but he managed to find and press the lion-shaped doorbell without looking away from the doormat.
When Harry and Malfoy got in the hotel lift from their floor later that evening, three other people followed. Harry settled into the corner, and Malfoy kept nearby, settling a few inches away. Harry could feel the small bounce of Malfoy’s leg as they went up the next ten floors.
“Make what up?”
“Yes. To great success, until now.” He swirled the contents of his mug. “If I don’t go, it’ll take months for the next one to come around. I can’t imagine what a horror I’d be by then.” And for all her solicitousness, he didn’t imagine Minister Salas would appreciate further delay either. He skipped over the inability to work part—he’d had enough scolding on that point.
Warm breath? Draco opened his eyes. The Deniden sat on him, gaze unblinking. Seeing him awake though, it stretched its wings wide. They were enormous.  A cold seeped down Draco’s spine.
Harry smiled as he tilted his head. “It’s been different the whole time, Draco.” Harry chased Draco’s intake of breath with his mouth. Draco’s lips were warm, full against his own. Draco’s fists blossomed open against Harry’s chest, fingers splayed. Tentatively searching.
Malfoy gave a single nod and looked down, his hands stilling. "Right. No, that’s—” He straightened, swiping his hands to rid them of any lingering sand. “Better. How it should be.”
His hand tightened on the door handle, willing it to open. Malfoy could be hurt. He’d been so tense when they left. That energy had to go somewhere. And that tiny room didn’t have many things to break. Even fewer people.
Potter sat too close, with his back against the nearest wall. The ink had cleared from his skin. Now, he just looked tired.
Harry frowned at the chess board. Not many good moves. “It’s no good if I start making exceptions, that’s a slippery slope right back to where I started.”
Harry squinted a bit at that, feeling pleased that he couldn’t tell if Malfoy was digging him or the nudists. “You have to be used to it, after school. Quidditch. Even the loos.” Harry paused to drop into the sand and pick up a few pieces of shell that caught his eye. The beach felt cool through his jeans. “After a while, bits are bits, y’know.”
Harry glanced at Malfoy, then over his shoulder at the bathroom. Something tugged at him, something familiar, but it passed.
“What kind of tip?”
“It’s how we keep them accountable. So that’s why. Even if it’s unpleasant.” He stopped and pointedly turned himself away, hands running back through his hair. In a whisper, he added: “Or contrary to my wishes.”
“Would it help if there were two?”
The grey eyes widened under the bright light of the shop, but Vickie interrupted the moment with a dismissive wave of her hands.
“You’ll need these as well.” The man handed over a folder, a leather-bound notepad, and a spiral-bound publication. “The map’s on the left hand sleeve of your folder. You can enter right through there.” He gestured behind him to the large wooden doors of what appeared to be an oversized brick home, now he had a proper look. Harry watched Malfoy take off. The peacoat lengthened his torso. From behind, he looked confident.
His Mark flashed with heat and pain, the skin nearly tearing with the force of something jagged pressing beneath the surface.
“Will do.”
Standing clear of the floating dishware, Harry went to the humming white fridge. He immediately groaned at his To Do list. It hung among an array of postcards and photographs, and in bold, capital letters, the first item clearly stated he needed to “GET YOUR CREDITS THIS YEAR OR ELSE.” Shite. Lot of good that did him. He took the magnetised red pen sitting above it and crossed the words out in a flourish. He needed to get a duplicating charm or something to have a copy he could carry along with him. Glancing at the To Do list when he was home every couple of months wasn’t cutting it. He skimmed it for anything else noteworthy, crossed off a few other things, and turned to The List.
“You'll be back in England for long, after this?”
“Your favourite grandchild,” Teddy corrected, peeking over the edge of the couch. A headband with charmed cat ears sat on Teddy’s head and twitched under Harry’s observation. The attack came only a moment later, Teddy springing himself over the furniture in a quick burst. Harry feigned a miss, then clutched him tight.
Then Potter smiled. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
She shook her head, laughing at him a little. “Please, it’ll be a great start to my tenure. And then I can give you updates while you’re gone. Assuming you still plan to go?”
After that, he tried to sleep. Unlike his crowded room, the bed, a California King, felt too large for one person. He’d pushed for a larger bed back then because Ginny had said he moved around too much in his sleep. And he’d figured one day, it would have to fit some children, when they had nightmares. Maybe a dog or two. Instead it occasionally just swallowed him, when he was home, or Ron if he were in trouble, apparently. Harry pressed his palms to his eyes, making his decision then and there. He needed out of England, Malfoy be damned. Then he’d get a new job and a new house and a bed that fit and there’d be no expectations that he be aware of everything all the time, nevermind fixing it.
Walking through the silent, sparkling condo to the kitchen, Ron’s absence was palpable. The kitchen didn’t look used, and it likely hadn’t been. Hermione worked too much to cook. Cocktails had been the compromise. Ron had said that to Harry, once, that family was about that, and sharing the load. Harry sighed, tapping on the counter. He’d forgotten that at some point.
The energy coming from Draco finally snapped. Whipping out his hand, he summoned his bag and his jacket swiftly to him, his eyes burning toward Harry all the while.
After another half hour of walking, the group Apparated back to their hotels to clean up and meet again for dinner. They’d joined up with Dave, Vickie, and a few other Americans for some spectacular burgers, followed by enormous biscuits from a tiny shop (“Hot Cookie”) that sold even tinier pants.
Harry nodded back. His smile turned his mouth just so, the way it did when he was thinking. Draco’d seen it last week, at the end of the night. When Harry, almost as close he was now, had spoken into the limited air between that he had only just realized Draco had some height on him.
Harry re-read the note, glancing by habit now over to Malfoy’s desk. Empty again. On either side of him, Jenkins and Flemings leaned back in their chairs to stare at him.
She smirked, mischief sparking in her eyes. “Would’ve if the ref weren’t watching.”
“I very clearly pointed up the street when we left the bar and said, ‘that ’a way.’ You have eyes, you could see the curve. Aren’t you Aurors supposed to be in top shape or something?” Dave paused to help Vickie and a few of the others along. He kept his eye on Malfoy as well, as he’d continued to fail to look the right way when they crossed streets.
“And trips overseas, it seems.” That got his attention. Harry got a glimpse of those grey eyes turned lavender in the right light, before they narrowed to sharp points.
He felt a familiar tingle at the back of his neck that told him he was being watched. When he looked up, he started. Malfoy’s papers were gone. The man, though, was not. He bent over a stack of files, fringe covering his eyes. Today’s jumper was a faded green. Harry swallowed and set his bag down.
Harry waded back to the bar and traded his drink for a fresh one before exploring the rest of the floor. About half the place had convention attendees—everyone else appeared to be Muggles enjoying a drink. Passing the lift bank they’d arrived in, Harry crossed the other half of the space. The tables were lower, arranged for meals, but a contingent of the attendees were gathered at the far end near the windows. He recognised Malfoy’s blond hair among the crowd. Even against the other blonds, his was the lightest. Malfoy’s posture remained tall, distant but curved toward his companions. Open, almost. Harry scanned the group’s faces. Whatever conversation they were having, it was serious. All of them looked serious under their glasses. It looked quite posh compared to the Auror pub gatherings he kept dragging himself to. More civilised. Less anti-Malfoy. He joined some conversations on the fringes. Looked for anyone as disinterested as he was.
So Harry wasn’t alone in that observation.
For his appearance of ease, Draco had a number of tells. An agitated flicker of his foot. A dimple that deepened with his discomfort. Harry’s silverware echoed against the plate. He felt exhausted for having just woken up. Harry cleared his hands with a napkin when he finished, and as he leaned over to set the tray aside, Draco finally spoke again. “I can’t look at you while we talk about this.”
“I know, sir, that’s the part I don’t understand.” Harry swept some hair behind his ear. “This says all my credits have gone through. That was supposed to take up to a week.”
Pansy was to blame. If she weren’t running late, she would have been there to remind him that while it was fun to
Draco groaned, allowing his hands to roam freely, finally, over the expanse of Harry’s shoulders, the softness of his nape, the warm, forbidden skin of his lower back beneath his shirt. “Hopefully not too quick,” he got out, mouth exploring each inch he uncovered. If he could have this, if the world really wouldn’t burn with it, he would savour every moment he got.
He drew some pictures in the condensation of his beer mug. “It was fine. Actually, I—” He checked Ron and Ginny to see how engrossed they were in their argument.
For most of his life, bathing had been a necessity, withheld or hurried by life with the Dursleys, in a dorm, or on the run. The master bath had slowed him—turned it into an indulgence. Within ten minutes, the bath filled with water and bubbles like cityscapes, Harry let himself sink below the surface. His hair and limbs floated loose within the currents of the jets.
Something circled his wrist. He forced an eye open. The light coming from the main house had turned a darker shade and formed into undulating shapes. Coiling tendrils extended out, reaching through the other buildings to pull out furniture, ropes, hides, and knives and draw them into the central house. And one such tendril had taken Draco’s arm and begun to pull.
“Some of us more than others,” Malfoy said finally. “If you’ll excuse me, Potter, I’m going upstairs. Good chat. Really.” Malfoy twisted out of Harry’s hold and disappeared into the crowd.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” At Draco’s silence, he took a step closer, nudging Draco’s shoulder with a boot. “You kicked my face in like this once, you know. I could return the favor.”
“Have you even seen what can pass for a solicitor’s office downtown?” he said. “At least mine’s not a converted living room or a former beans factory or some other nonsense: it was built to be a workplace.”
“It’s kind of funny,” he said, as they waited in queue for bacon sandwiches. “The only time we go in together is your last week at the condo.” She and Ron were moving out that coming weekend. He’d helped them pack. It seemed an appropriate penance to him, even if they argued it was what friends normally did.
“What’s different about this, then?” Harry had a theory. He didn’t track people around the world without some ability to understand them. Even so, he wanted to test it first.
For a moment, Malfoy’s face was stunned, unmoving. It remained that way until the music changed. A group beside them cheered and pressed past them toward the dance floor.
Shite.
Department had to say could possibly be relevant to him now.
“Maybe you should get some of these for the Weasel,” Malfoy said, pointing to the red and white stripes. They’d had a few drinks with dinner, and there was a flush in his skin and glow in his eyes that aged his appearance down a good five years. “They’d go quite well with his hair.”
Of course. Nothing could be bloody easy. He put the list away.
This was what he’d wanted: the only thing tying him to England had gone. He almost looked across the bullpen, but covered his eyes instead. No, he still had to be here for Hermione. He couldn't leave yet. He'd owl the Spanish Ministry tomorrow.
He looked at her then. She stood solid against a fading sky, unbending to him or anyone.
“Because it wouldn’t be
Her eyes started to shine, but she looked imperious as she said: “Of course I did.”
Harry lay awake long after, his blood and body slow to settle. He’d woken in this place nearly every morning the last few days, his body a comma to Draco's full stop. Something in him had been reaching. Drawn to the body in his arms. But for what.
“Being alive. Free. Having friends. Being your friend. I thought I couldn’t ever get more happiness than that.”
“Have you ever—” He shifted in his seat and lifted his head to face her again. “That is, would you ever consider leaving England?”
—but you.”
Draco felt it, then, past the silence and the dull throb in his forearm: the beckoning call of dark magic. It flicked at the edges of the circle on the floor, as rhythmic as flames.
"I’ll have whatever isn’t wine." Harry set out the remainder of the treats and Vanished the box. "It’s been nothing but wine for months, and I don’t care how ‘fragrant’ it is, or how many years it’s sat, or how many ‘tannins’ there are, I can’t get a taste for that stuff."
"That you've left the door unlocked again?" Harry didn't look up from the couch or his magazine; instead, he flicked his wrist and the old lock turned with an echoed click.
As Harry moved through the small queue for the food, he saw a few eyes flicker toward his badge, but no one lingered or looked twice. He smiled when they caught his eye, made some introductions. Harry went back to the main room and found a seat a few rows back, far to the left, even so. He set down the two coffees he’d nicked and pulled the somewhat crumpled donuts and an orange from his bag of goods. A few minutes before the conference began, a sandy haired man reclined into a seat one away from Harry. He put his arm around the seat between them, and when Harry looked at him, he leaned over.
“Why don’t you go collect Teddy? We’re all going out for drinks at the pub soon—Neville, Susan, maybe Luna if she makes it—you’re welcome to join us once you take him home.”
He stood, the universal signal for Harry to do the same. Harry eventually nodded, then stood as well.
“Auror Malfoy submitted his resignation to me last Monday. Surely you’ve noticed his desk’s been empty? It’s been a blessing to get the eyesore of all those papers out of sight at last.”
Though that wasn’t entirely true. Hermione had found comfort in his presence, once he’d finally given her the time and space to share. Teddy was a healthy, social child. And for how horribly things had blown up, he’d even seen Malfoy come out of his shell with Harry’s quiet support, his attention through the crowds and streets.
Draco smiled back when their eyes met, a feat given his beating heart. “Here we are.”
“I’m not reading it.”
“Is it that offensive? I thought it could be a nice footrest or something. Or a blanket?”
“We’ve got work to do,” he said. Harry’s heart sank.
“Hey.” The tall, sandy haired bloke from the other day appeared on Harry’s left. Harry looked up from that day’s box lunch and took in the light dusting of freckles on the man’s face, the warm hazel eyes. Like a Professor Lupin without the scars. He swallowed down the bit of roast beef in his mouth. “Do you mind if I sit here? Hair-ry?” He had bent his knees to get a glimpse at Harry’s name tag for the last bit.
Weeks later, on Harry’s first day back from administrative leave, he walked to the canteen with Hermione for an early breakfast.
Harry moved closer, lingering near the outskirts of the group until someone mentioned they had about two minutes to go and should start getting ready. Harry did another sweep across the horizon, his bag tucked close to his side, then made his way over to claim one of the umbrella spokes. When one minute was announced, Harry caught the sounds of running feet. Malfoy was moving toward them quickly, a suitcase in his hand. Thirty seconds. Harry saw some of the others drawing tighter together when they recognised Malfoy, some muttering sounds of disbelief. Malfoy had slowed then, avoiding anyone’s eyes. No one made room when he reached them.
He pressed his forehead into the door with a slow exhale, cursing himself. He was being an idiot. Malfoy had grown up posh. That was probably just how he bathed. For hours. Luxuriating. Seemed like the kind of thing you did when you were rich.
Harry’s eyebrows lifted at that. “Prefer them speccy, then?”
“What the hell is a panoptic tower,” he muttered to himself, glancing over the summary of the session. He flipped to the appropriate pages of the binder and read over the slides replicated there. A forlorn prisoner. A single guard tower in the middle of a circular building, the windows obscuring the guard’s outline. The tables beside him laughed, and Harry set the materials aside once the food came. He’d learned more from speaking with Malfoy than twenty minutes with that binder.
At some point, Malfoy stepped into place beside him. The realisation came slowly. One moment, Harry was staring eye level at the window. Then, against the dark impression of a blue apartment tower, the window reflected a set of eyes back at him below strands of familiar blond hair. Harry stared at him, surprised he was allowed to.
“It’s very inauspicious timing on his part. I got a report with the accusations over the weekend. I imagine he caught word that they were on to him and fled.”
Potter sat in a chair he’d pushed back on its hind legs. His feet balanced against the deck’s guardrail. He could have just left the trials, he looked so untouched by time. The same ruinous and wild hair, eyes hidden behind the same awful glasses. Revolving in the air beside him was an apple, red as the peppers had been, its skin slowly peeling away with each rotation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Something like agony flashed on Draco’s face, but he gave a small nod. “Can we get in the bath now please?”
“Fuck.” His eyes blurred with moisture, and his fingers pulled tight enough to tear the package’s edge. Falling back, he summoned the door and threw himself through. His wheezing breath filled the stretch of Subspace, and he closed his eyes. The pain in his arm, the call to the dark, didn’t reach him here.
Draco pointedly stared at the paper, waiting to answer. The hint eventually sank in and Potter scrawled something (hopefully his name) at the bottom. Draco caught the paper and quill as they returned to him. “Theo’s uncle,” he said.
And there it was.
Harry tossed the towel from his hair to the bathroom floor. “All yours then, your majesty.”
Now that he had been in England for eighteen days (and approximately ten hours), the topics for coverage were clearly growing slim.
“—Doxies, Ron—”
“I can’t forget. Whatever the continent.” Harry reached for him and placed his hand over Draco’s chest. He'd seen now that it was smooth beneath the jumper. Unmarred. Slowly, giving him time to pull away, Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's shoulder.
The news broke by the end of the week. The Prophet gave the story front page coverage with an exclusive Harry’d given to the two blokes he’d spoken with the week before. He got final say before it went to press, and they’d argued a bit about the phrasing for his role, but the end result suited him well enough.
Harry did not do that. He returned a sleeping Teddy to Grimmauld Place, made his excuses to Andromeda, and passed through an empty living room into his bedroom. Hermione and Ron were either asleep or out. He rested against his bedroom door, once he’d closed it. All his boxes still sat everywhere, cluttering up the floor and closet and tops of his dressers. The room had seemed to shrink, the walking space for him narrower, the area too small for his things. He tried to start putting things to rights, but fifteen minutes in, he pulled open one of his drawers to see some spare clothes of Ron’s and slammed it shut.
She shook her head, smiling now. “I’m not even going to dignify that with a response. But, I do think you should tell Ron about Malfoy.”
The lazy smile on Harry's face grew wider. “Come on then, open it up. If I’d known I was going to get all these theatrics, I’d have brought you an Olivier Award instead. Is that something people look for in a solicitor as well as discretion? Drama?”
Harry couldn’t argue with that. Draco continued: “International cooperation is really where everything’s headed. It makes sense to send the stronger Aurors overseas.”
“Or like Charlie,” he said, much preferring that comparison.
“Hm.” A couple brushed past Malfoy as the trolley started to come into sight, and Harry didn’t miss the minor flinch. Under the guise of leading him towards the opening door, Harry put himself between Malfoy and the crowd. Malfoy swallowed. “Well, if we end up in one from England I will not be impressed.”
“A case? I see.” She considered him, eyes narrowing, then raised her glass. “Well, if the DMLE can be any help, let me know.”
“You’ve never sat in it,” Draco said. Harry risked a look at him.
Outside, they met a clear blue sky for the first time in days. The wind still swept bitter and cold off the Bay, the air crisp, but the sun warmed them while they waited for streetlights to change or bicyclists to pass. In the Wharf’s Ferry Building, they walked side by side along the stalls. Draco picked up some artisanal soaps. Harry grabbed some for himself. They had lunch along the water. Harry opted for a charcuterie over oysters. He’d done an international portkey once after a large seafood meal. He was never making that mistake again. And he liked the taste of chorizo, the familiar spice. Draco had a salad and couldn't look at the array.
“Theo Nott?”
“I did. Good game! Almost thought you’d knock that Keeper into the sun for a minute there.”
Ron and Hermione summoned them after another half an hour. Ginny didn’t leave room for awkwardness: as soon as the door opened, she suggested, “Pizza? I’m starving.”
Draco finally opened his eyes. The room had no light, save the fire, but Draco recognized the main room of the compound. Free of hanging foci and herbs, the ceiling was smooth and painted blue. The walls and floors, too, were blank and smooth. Like nothing had happened. He lifted his head to drink. Half of it spilled over, but it was enough.
“I’ll be sure to allocate blame accordingly.” Draco let the gift sit in his lap, watching Harry tear away the wrapping paper and set aside the box lid with care. Their eyes met for a moment, the edges of Harry’s crinkling some with amusement.
Harry turned the map around as he oriented himself. “Part of my uniform,” he said, tracing a line down the paper with his finger. “Hotel’s only a few blocks away. It’s Muggle, so figured we walk?” Harry folded the paper back into his pocket and started off. It took Malfoy a moment, but the heel of his leather shoes had a distinctive enough patter behind him soon after.
“Sorry?”
“I know,” Harry said, a wicked grin crossing his face.
“Keeping your country safe from outsiders, you mean,” Malfoy said, arching an eyebrow.
Stepping out of Harry’s grasping range, Draco sat on top of the sofa and picked at the same edge of his jacket that Harry’d futzed with.
Harry frowned at that.
“Thanks for not giving up on me,” he said, pulling the blanket up around her. She seemed small again, in the middle of all their things, the bed meant to fit her and Ron together. She smiled at him as her eyes fluttered closed.
Harry pushed through a lingering dream about flying to open his eyes. The bed had again been divided. The sheets were drawn, but the bed for Malfoy was empty. Harry sat up and strained to hear anything beyond the loud hum of the air conditioning unit. Once his eyes adjusted, he stared down the hallway reflected in its mirror. The bathroom door suddenly opened, and Malfoy stepped out in a long sleeve shirt and pyjama bottoms, a towel scrubbing into his hair. Within a few minutes, Harry could feel the curl of heat and humidity reach his feet.
The mailbox stood a few feet behind him. The metal that remained shone silver in spotted clusters. Whatever name it used to bear had disappeared under a series of carved slashes. An unmarked cross leaned against the wooden base, and two smaller crosses lay half buried in the sand. His fingertips brushed over the scratch marks. They ran deeper than they looked.
“You think my gift is lovely?" Harry asked. Draco looked over his face, the openness there the same combination of enticing and torturous as ever.
“You remember you don’t live here anymore.”
Ron’s sip of his drink did little to hide his smirk. When Hermione saw it, though, Ron wiped it clear off his face. “Don’t be mad at me, ‘Mione. You’re the one who created the monster.”
He sat back and smoothed his jacket. Didn’t have to lie about this one. “Nothing special.”
“You’re having me on: they do not,” Harry said, stepping a little closer to squint into the darkening distance.
the unwrapped gift, and I wouldn’t be paying for a single drink all night.”
the chocolates he’d left her).
“I’ve brought you in to discuss Auror Malfoy, and I want you to think very hard about your answer before you respond. Two of our Aurors have come forward with some very serious accusations against him—bribery, harassment, false warrants—levels of interference I honestly find it difficult to imagine, from that desk we put him on. And I need to know if there was anything, of any scale, that gave you cause to question his character while the two of you were in San Francisco. Obviously you didn’t have eyes on him all the time, but any information you have could be helpful.”
“Nothing special. It’s actually a joint matter with The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. They think they’ve got someone illegally breeding and selling Occamies. I’m just consulting on some of the procedural stuff, doing some interviews.”
Un-fucking-believable. Draco glared up at him, even as his hips arched up and stuttered at further contact. “So much happiness. It’s a quota, per person, and I—”
Harry waited for the door to shut before he summoned the Quidditch Weekly back into his hands. He rubbed out a crease from the cover, then shifted back into his fully reclined position.
Harry didn’t think much of it, taking another step. The couple inches Malfoy had on him were distracting. Not a marked difference, but he had to lift his head and arch his neck just so to meet the man’s stare head on.
Draco pressed their foreheads close, his eyes drifting shut. “This. I was so sure that you’d never… I’ve tried to be a realist about things. Our prospects. And I’ve had a theory actually.”
“Come on,” Dave called. He and the others had already started down the block. “Time to party!”
“This is your place?” Harry’s head tilted back so far Draco wondered how he didn’t slip on the pavement, well and truly covered as it was in a layer of snow. Maybe the bags held him down.
“This is not the Gryffindor common room. You have a guest.” When Harry didn’t respond, Malfoy continued: “‘Modesty is a virtue’? I mean you should get dressed in the bathroom.”
Potter’s body shook. Sweat dripped from his hair. And the inky colour rose higher up his body, rolling over the curve of his jawline toward his mouth.
The door creaked a little as he opened it. Harry passed him by, his head moving as he took in the room at an easy pace. The entrance opened into the cacophony of a room that was his study area, sitting room, and library all in one. Three-quarters of the walls were inlaid bookshelves full to bursting; that architectural feature alone had made him sign the lease. The rest of the wooden walls, the haphazard collection of furniture built for comfort more than appearance, were just necessities.
Harry took a sip of his cocktail, then another. Malfoy did the same.
“I’ve been told that if I go to that conference, I have to go with Draco Malfoy. There was some drama with his paperwork, I guess, so he can’t be there on his own.”
“Well, come on then. That chair isn’t that comfortable, anyway.”
The day after speaking with Harry, Robards called Malfoy back to the Ministry. He offered Malfoy a job: not with the CRAPI Department, but as a full Auror, to begin case work immediately if he wanted it. Harry wasn’t there for the meeting, though he’d been fairly creative in the excuses he considered to go in. Beyond handing over everything he knew to Robards and later, Internal Affairs, they agreed it was best that he take some time off work for a while. Robards was grateful for Harry’s honesty, but also troubled, and while he wasn’t going to take punitive action against him for sitting on his information for so long, he had to do something. So he sent him on administrative leave. Harry penned the letter withdrawing his application to Minister Salas himself. Spain was not the solution, really.
“One bake sale at a time. A man has limits.” Ron looked at her, raising his eyebrows some for emphasis. While she lifted her eyes to the ceiling, seeking grace, she was smiling when she finally looked back at them.
“They never are in places like these. Believe me, the foreign service puts you up in much better places.” Harry lay back down, punching his pillow into place.
"Good, because that's all you'll be eating," Ron said as he stirred the bubbling contents of a pot. "I only made enough for two."
“Right,” Malfoy said, pressing his hands down and flat along his thighs. The fingers, though, pressed deep into his trousers. Harry braced himself. The energy had changed, a thrumming in Malfoy’s posture. But Malfoy’s voice stayed at its same low tenor when he said: “Glad we cleared things up then. I’ll just—I’ll meet you back at the hotel.” He Disapparated.
Harry watched Ron slide in beside Hermione and budged over when Ginny gave him a sharp poke in the ribs to make room.
them, but recognise things). Like how Malfoy never wore black, white, or grey. Or anything that wasn’t a soft shade of some colour. How he always wore roll-neck jumpers, and his hair never got long enough to dip below the collar line. That he never responded to the harassment from other Aurors.
“You’re holding up the line,” Vickie said, pressing between them to get closer to the display case. “Less flirting, more getting out of the way.”
Draco scoffed. “That’s purely a technicality.”
“However much money that family spent getting that kid into this department, it wasn’t enough, I guess.”
to something. That was the ‘making’ part. Now, the self-making is done. Day One at the fry station.”
Malfoy’s voice ran through the room. “Don’t bother, that mess is only going to get worse once we’re out there. The pamphlet says it’s going to be very windy.”
Turning back to the proper page, he said quietly to the room: “Goodnight, Chef.”
“What’s she like? The owner.”
“If you’ll be overseeing it, I imagine so,” Ron said.
“Wait a second. You asked me to work a bake sale, and you weren’t even going to be there?”
Harry nodded, going back to his sandwich.
“Mm, yeah?” Harry asked around the dryness in his mouth.
“Okay.”
Harry watched Malfoy’s easy movements folding the towel over the edge of a chair, his shuffling of items at his bedside. It was more thoughtful than Harry’d expected. Only as he began to slip to sleep did something hover at the end of his mind.
"I was going to say 'anonymous.' Hopefully I never get so desperate I have to be myself."
thing.
They sat in silence for a while. Potter brought the fire back to life and helped Draco sit up so he could eat. When they were done, Draco asked: “What are you going to do if it never happens?”
“—repeatedly—” Ron said.
“Now who’s the prude?” Malfoy followed his question with a self-satisfied smirk. That look Harry’d seen many times. And could work with.
“I didn’t think criminals could leave the U.K.,” someone else muttered.
, he thought.
The first and oldest file detailed a case with Jordan Maxwell, a potioneer that had smuggled illegal ingredients into the country by stuffing them into hollowed brooms. The case had been ongoing during Harry’s last large case at home, the Reynolds case, and the key witness had almost made a run for it. Maxwell’s family wasn’t Sacred Twenty-Eight, but they were close, and had no problems using some of their money to knock out people connected to the case. Next to Harry’s desk, the pair of Aurors had discussed the bribes they’d given the witness to take the stand and take the risk. It hadn’t worked out entirely—the witness was attacked as he walked into the Wizengamot—but the conviction was secured once he’d recovered in a private, protected wing at St. Mungo’s. Malfoy had been thorough and was clearly beginning to make use of some of the technologies they’d discussed at the conference. Infrared shots of the Aurors in the witness’s home, time stamped long after the Aurors would’ve handed the matter over to the DMLE for prosecution. Recorded conversations, transcripted conveniently, where they described what they’d give him to testify. Copies of the wire records showing the transfers. Harry set the papers down. He didn’t know how the hell Malfoy had managed to obtain all of this evidence. Or even been able to access it. Until he found warrants at the back, signed by a P.P. in the DMLE’s clerk office.
“Fine,” Malfoy said, put out at the prospect. “I left my galleons in the hotel room. Remind me when we get back.”
. Clothes seemed far too presumptuous (no matter how much Harry could use an upgrade—or how badly Draco wanted to dress him). Towels fostered inappropriate fantasies of Harry using them (always after a steamy, thorough shower, and for only a moment before being discarded in favor of a romp). Soft pyjamas led to more inappropriate fantasies (like Draco taking the pair off him with his teeth). Draco’d eventually left the mortal plane around the men’s “essentials” section. Faced with a display of silken pants, he achieved, as the Muggles say, nirvana. At least until the salesperson approached him with more reasonable options.
That left his inbox. It loomed from the left corner of his desk, overflowing into a series of several piles. So much for not having work the next few weeks. He pulled out the three silver-lined and oversized envelopes that stood out from the rest.
Harry relaxed his head back to the hard edge of his chair. “I have, but I was looking forward to this trip—”
Saturday morning, Andromeda was in the sitting room reading when Harry emerged from the Floo at Grimmauld Place. Her hair was swept high off of her face, and even in an oversized button-up and grey trousers, she looked elegant and younger than the streaks of grey in her hair implied.
“As if anyone else would work with that tripe.” Jenkins had joined in now. “Or the information he gets.” This caused another round of laughs.
Harry shook his head. “I know so.”
From the parking lot, the guide directed them into a small grouping of trees. The guides played lookout and when the area was cleared of Muggles, they were Side-Alonged to the stretch of beach off of San Francisco and opposite the Headlands. Harry liked the Headlands more from this side of the strait. The stretch of them seemed placed in better context now, with the long stretches of green and battered coast.
“Let’s go down to the Wharf. We’ve got some time before the portkey.”
“I didn’t know it was you.” A thousand responses had come to mind, but Harry settled on that. “When I got your first memo. I didn’t know the CRAPI Department was yours. I thought it was Jenkins playing a joke."
The pressure in his chest tightened. “Ah.” He nodded. “So, you told Ron, then?”
“Tourism is available to answer any questions you have if you go out that door and to the left. Next!”
He considered The List for a moment more, turned the pen over in his hand, and scrawled
"Whenever you're ready, Mr. Potter."
Harry looked down at the files, the CRAPI Department typeface visible across their fronts. “I mean, the hard documentation is, but—”
“So,” Harry began, clearing his throat. “Anything specific you’re interested in?”
Harry watched, noting the same elegant movements that had opened the bags of letters were now shredding that napkin.
Hermione drew her shoulders back and ran her hands over the table. “I may have deferred—”
Draco stilled at the caress of that familiar baritone. They both turned to see Harry standing beside them with several gift bags in hand, snow gathered in his dark mop of hair. Harry extended his right hand to Pansy. The outermost bag said
She smiled at him, though it wavered a little. “Alright, I’ll get you a glass.” She met him back on the couch and poured him some. She held the pitcher closer in her lap, taking a drink from it with a colourful straw.
“No, but refusing to help in any of my projects,” Hermione said, crumbs forgotten to wave her churro at him, “is putting you well on your way.”
Harry groaned into his pillow the next morning, the back of this throat aching and sour. He flicked his hand at the blaring alarm, and the small machine flew against the wall, then shattered. For a few golden moments, the room was silent save the hum of the AC unit. He enjoyed it before his mind so helpfully reminded him the final set of sessions was this morning.
On the street the next morning, Malfoy set a brisk pace toward the designated conference building. Harry had offered a good morning back in the room that went unacknowledged, but Malfoy had waited for Harry to gather his things before leaving. Same detente as the office, then.
Malfoy was taking too long. Was he waiting him out on purpose? Holding himself hostage?
Draco extended his arm for the Deniden to join him. “Let’s go get him.”
“I can shake off the Imperius,” Harry said, voice low because if he didn’t hold it together, he was going to shout himself raw. “But no, I haven’t been to the Healer.”
Harry brushed some of his fringe back, a lazy smile on his face. "Going for broke, then?"
The shower squealed as Malfoy turned it off. The sound gave Harry just enough warning to be on his feet, at the ready, when the door opened. Most of Malfoy’s face remained in shadows, but Harry saw the red rimmed eyes, the dark flush to his skin.
“It’s Potter, isn’t it?” In trouble, clearly, though Merlin knew what the fuck Draco was supposed to do about it.
“I think whatever half of it came from Hermione is.”
“What’s ridiculous is I’d feel ten times safer on a broom,” Malfoy said, his voice a little breathy. Harry grinned, feeling charmed at the muted smile stretching Malfoy’s lips.
Harry’s eyes flickered to Draco’s before he tugged on the soft fabric, nudging Draco slightly closer. Slowly, so slowly, Harry bent forward, his lips brushing first the left corner of Draco’s mouth, then the right, before pressing fully and firmly against him.
Draco didn’t need to be told twice. “Of course. Ta, Potter.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered. No sudden movements. Harry took a measured step forward, looking up at him, using the leverage of his hands to bring their faces close. Malfoy’d been fast—his hands blocked Harry from pressing flush against him, each one curled into fists against Harry’s chest. His thumbs, though, were each brushing a narrow inch of skin there. His eyes—awed, shining—tracked their movement. He’d brushed his teeth. Each breath passing between them felt clean, fresh: the opposite of the thick choking steam crowding them in the bathroom.
Though Draco might be a “maybe” himself, assuming he hadn’t misread last week entirely. Except he probably
“There’ll always be another one I can save.”
“No, no, nothing like that. By myself is fine.”
The creases in Robards’s forehead grew very deep at the question. He sat back in his chair, waiting for it to rock and settle into stillness before speaking again.
He came back to himself in his flat’s kitchen, hand already in the middle of an unsteady pour of firewhiskey, the package back in his deliveries box. He put the bottle down. It wasn’t good, that place. Not good at all.
“Yes,” Draco said at last. He dragged out the s at the end, letting it fizzle out. Harry counted seconds before answering.
A short man in a green suit and the bushiest beard Harry had seen since Hagrid blinked into view. With a wave of his hand, a fold out table appeared with a colourful array of binders and documents laid out in a row. Leaned against the front legs of his table was a sign. Welcome to the Second Annual Auror Conference for the Theory and Application of Magical and Emerging Surveillance Technologies.
“Do you want some tea? I haven’t made any today, but—”
“Right. Well, good job then.” Malfoy’s right shoulder hitched for a moment in a half shrug. Then he turned back to the bag and pulled out a handful of correspondence. At some point, Harry returned to his desk.
“—I thought maybe we could just go to mine? Or yours? You’ve mentioned your place is close to here, haven’t you?”
Harry swallowed. This was why he rarely stayed the night. “Er, not sure. Depends on when our credits process. And what Robards has in mind.” He should have grabbed the Russian text instead. Spanish seemed like a glaring sign of his lie.
“Is that all? Seemed like there was more going on.”
“The principle is the same, Potter. Even if one is more offensive than the other.”
“So you’re really a cop now, after all of that,” the official said, shaking his head. “That’s pretty impressive. My sister’s husband is in prison, but he’s been doing this, like, chef training program or whatever? We’re hoping something comes out of that once he finishes his sentence. He can’t keep on like he is, you know?”
“Ah, yes.” So he’d known he was late. Draco took his time getting settled back into his chair. Rolled his shoulders. Straightened the bow on the gift box. “This is it, actually.” He watched Harry’s face in the mirror above the bar.
“Is he always like that?” the man asked, watching Malfoy’s departure as well. Harry shrugged.
It felt hard to breathe. “So Gin was right, then.”
“Among other reasons.” They stayed there for a while, watching some of the other attendees step up and order drinks. Harry could see Malfoy’s gaze flickering over to one table in particular.
Malfoy turned away and walked over to the nearest queue. Harry followed him, not forcing further conversation. From a quick survey of the room, Malfoy already had the attention of a few of the security officers. His portkey timing was probably still flagged, if Harry had to guess. When Harry made eye contact with any of the officers, he kept it until they shared a nod. Confidence could go both ways, but he typically found it lowered suspicions in places like this. The officers looked mean on purpose.
They got into a stare off until Ron took another of Harry’s pawns.
Malfoy almost smiled at that, though he seemed to catch himself and keep it small.
At the doorway, Draco braced his legs on either side of the frame and resisted the pull. He could see Potter now. His dark-haired figure faced Draco, but he focused downward, his body bent forward. His hands disappeared into the rippling surface of another circle. It looked like oil, dark and viscous, and it had stained up Potter’s arm and neck. Around him, the tendrils placed their collected items at the circle’s center. The items sank at first. After a minute, though, they sank only partly. Then they stopped sinking at all.
The water slowly stilled. In the quiet that followed, Harry caught onto some murmuring, followed by a rise in voices. He looked behind him toward the door. Hermione and Ron were home. Carefully, Harry wrapped himself in a towel and Vanished the contents of the tub. The voices grew louder, angry. Whatever peace he’d managed in the bath left him, replaced with a sense of unease. He walked toward the second door, which led out into the main room. He stilled, catching glimpses of their voices still, but the sounds disappeared once he crossed to the hall. He paused in the kitchen to toss his To Do List in the bin, then entered his room. Without tripping for once, he stepped around the boxes he still had not unpacked and collapsed into bed, willing sleep to come. The conference started to creep back to mind, but he pushed it aside.
Harry laughed—the brilliant one that arched his neck and rang deep between his broad shoulders—and Draco was glad for it. Otherwise, his slightly shaky hands would give him away as he lifted off the box top.
He couldn’t look at his arm. It had to be dissolving, on fire, the way his nerves screamed along his bones. He struggled to breathe, to open his eyes. This had been a terrible mistake. He should’ve stayed asleep. He should’ve stayed in the damn Manor.
And Harry, his eyes practically glowing, traced down Draco’s face and back again with his gaze. “Yes, well, you’re very discreet aren’t you?”
“What are you talking about—”
Malfoy glanced in his direction, then shook his own expression away. “If only we were
“Didn’t you say this light didn’t work earlier?”
“And if you do go?”
Lifting his head from the pillow, he took in Draco’s formal, seated position on the chair in the corner. Harry slumped. Draco had dressed in his usual ensemble of softly coloured jumper and trousers. Beside him, on the desk, sat two breakfast trays. Draco’s gaze focused around Harry’s knees. The openness on his face had gone.
How typically Potter of him. Draco hummed.
Hermione bit her lip. “Well, yes, actually.”
“Until he made it clear he wasn’t who I thought he was. I thought he could understand what it was like. That we’re not who everyone thinks we are. That he could see me differently. But I’m just ‘Harry Potter the Great’ to him as well.”
“Sure,” he said. “I’ll do that.”
Harry shrugged. “It’s been what, almost three years? We’re friends.”
is the girl you've been shagging?”
Harry’s smile fell away. He pocketed his shells and stood. “Yes, I can see it now. ‘Saviour Blesses Public Park with the Chosen Ass, Encourages All to Embrace Body Positivity.’”
Harry reached for his scar, reminding himself he’d reset his Glamour that morning. “Harry Potter,” he said, watching for the telltale sign of recognition. The man just rummaged through the box, tossing badges to the side as needed. The shoebox was deeper than it looked.
“Auror Potter.” Harry looked over at Robards’s assistant, smiling near his elbow. “Head Auror Robards would like to see you this afternoon, if you’ve the time. 2 p.m. works best.”
“Eh, loosely. We’re not really on speaking terms. And he seemed alright the first few times we spoke, but then he reverted back to the same old arsehole, so, who knows.”
Draco accepted this as he recast a charm to fold his jumper. “He does usually keep you for only the worst matters now.”
Harry nodded, fingers digging into his palms. His hand still felt the press of Malfoy’s body against it. Harry shook it out.
He indulged in a long shower to scrub the travel that lingered over him. Once he found his local Auror robes, he cast some strong Scourgifies to freshen them up. They’d been crumpled under his bed all this time, covering a discarded and well used pair of trainers. After that, some sense of obligation kicked in: homemade coffee and breakfast were tempting, but it was past ten, and there was a Muggle spot near the Ministry that did a good bacon sandwich and latte in a pinch.
They’d mingled for years in numerous homes: the Granger-Weasleys’s cottage, Pansy’s penthouse, Dean’s flat above his art studio. Harry visited Draco’s office, of course, but even there, Draco always had the formality of his large desk and paperwork, some trainee or another flittering about with his cantankerous secretary Berta near the entrance. For his convincing self-talk that he and Harry could only ever be friends, that at some point, his interest in him would just go away, he’d always had the sense to recognize that there would be no moving on from having Harry in his home. That once he’d touched Draco’s things, been seen on Draco’s furniture, he’d linger there. And now, with almost no effort to stop it, they were drinking together on Christmas Eve and stamping over the sole barrier Draco had maintained all these years.
Draco couldn’t stop himself. He cried out from the pain of the tendril’s pull. It would dislocate his shoulder soon.
It took a little over fifteen minutes before they saw a large sand-coloured hill peak out of the middle of the residential area, and Dave gave a hoot.
Harry felt again the dark silence of The Burrow when Shacklebolt shared the news. He’d arrived early to join the family dinner, a few months after the last of the memorials. His kind face had seemed pained from the outset, his formal robes holding him back from his usual casual rapport. He waited for dessert to announce that the Malfoys were cooperating with the DMLE: that there would be no trial, just an out of court agreement bartering house arrest for full cooperation in the location and prosecution of Voldemort’s remaining comrades in arms. The news seemed to suck the house of air, a cold contrast to its usual bustling energy and warmth. Harry had stared at his plate for most of the speech. At least until Ron’s powerful slam of his plate and steps out the house snapped him out of it.
“So you get the bad guys or what?” Ron asked. “Usually you’re bursting to share the details.”
“Who are the Aurors?” Harry asked, his voice scratchy through his dry throat.
Harry grimaced. “I mean, we spoke, after that game I went to with Teddy.” Now it was his turn for guilt. “She might have hinted that there were some things going on.” He couldn’t bring himself to mention the fight he’d overheard. Ignored. Hermione nodded at this, unsurprised.
“You’re not wrong there. Don’t get me started on the way those Aurors behave around one another.” At Harry’s expression, she changed course, lips pursed around her straw. “Anyway, the point is you have to find some balance. Back when I told you to set some boundaries, I didn’t mean forget who you are. You don’t have to fix everything. You don’t have to say yes to everything. But when there’s a problem you can fix, I think you have a responsibility to do it. And that’s not because you’re the Slayer of the Dark Lord. It’s something we all face in some capacity. It’s how relationships work. What it’s like to be a parent. You don’t always want to do the thing, but sometimes you have to. Or you could go live somewhere exotic and forget all about us. Spain sounds nice. Seems to be working for you so far.”
“Unlikely.”
Harry stared a moment longer, then said “right” because he couldn’t think of anything better. That case took a few weeks to solve, but the information had been spot on. The Monday after the case closed, he went right to Malfoy’s desk and hovered until Malfoy paused what he was doing.
“Whatever you think of my theory, Pans, we must agree to disagree. Having Harry’s friendship is already more than I deserve.”
“Whatever packs more punch,” Harry said, wiping his mouth with his hand. Disgusted—Draco should be disgusted, not amused. “It’s about quality more than quantity nowadays.”
“Do you see it? How beautiful you are? It’s so much I almost can’t stand it.”
It should have been his first stop that day. None of the other packages in his queue matched its importance. Still, he slid the charmed roller blades onto his feet and delivered several others first, mostly personal correspondence or documents of court, for names he didn't know. Then he lunched on a bench by the Santa Monica pier and watched tourists fly (and mostly fall) on a modified trapeze. They had all kinds of flight, Muggles. They could reach the stars in the guts of the metal birds that roared over his flat every night from the airport. But none of that matched the
“Can we do it together?” Harry watched the pleading look flash, then get buried in Draco’s gaze. One beat passed. Another. Then he nodded. Draco let the tie fall to the side, then brought his hands up to the edges on either shoulder and waited for Harry’s hands to cover his. With the lightest pressure, Draco began to pull them apart, guiding Harry’s hands along with his own. Inch by inch, his chest emerged; then, his shoulders, the length of his arms, then the dips in his waist as at last, the heavy dressing gown fell away into the tub with a splash. The tension in Draco’s figure ran through his hand, and he crushed Harry’s fingers in his fist. When Harry looked up, Draco had closed his eyes again.
Harry forced his expression to stay neutral. He was going to shred up that bloody useless To Do list the minute he got home. Robards went on: “You can think about it, of course. I believe you can cancel your conference registration on Monday at the latest without extra expense to the Ministry. Why don’t you take the weekend to think about it?”
“It wasn’t a punishment the whole time. You only had to stay the first three years. But back to my real question, where the hell is everyone?” He pulled back his jacket sleeve to look at his watch. “Bachelor’s Eve started over an hour ago."
“You remember you’re a wizard,” she said, tossing a practice bludger from hand to hand. Harry leaned against the wall near her, his arms crossed.
“No.” It was
After a few hours, Ron let his files lie flat against his chest and stretched out on the length of the couch. “You’re telling me the Ferret himself put all this stuff together?”
The piece detailed Jenkins’s and Flemings’s wrongdoing over the years. It couldn’t capture all of them. A newly opened investigation by Internal Affairs was conducting a thorough review of every case the pair of them had worked, including all those involving the prosecutor that had helped them. But it captured everything Malfoy’d summarised, Harry’s own bits from the years, as well as some of the older cases Harry’d remembered from further back. Harry played a central role in the narrative the Prophet put together, but he made sure they addressed how none of it could have come to life without the extensive and selfless efforts of Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy was up and out of the conference space as soon as the last morning session wrapped up. By the time Harry tracked him down in the room sectioned off for lunch service, Malfoy had already found and queued up in a group around the day’s keynote speaker. Harry looked at the woman’s face, the long brown hair pulled up into a loose bun, and recalled something about the questionable use of Revelio charms for passive surveillance in populated retail areas. Harry took a box of cold sandwiches and found a seat at the furthest section of the space, against the windows. From there, he could see Malfoy and the others mingling around. Robards had mentioned Malfoy’d argued for why he should get to attend this conference. He seemed to be taking it seriously, at least. He fit in amongst the academics. No one looked twice at Malfoy’s face or badge either.
“Strange, to put it so close to civilisation,” Harry said after the white noise of the crowd had quieted back around them, and his heartbeat stopped ringing in his ears.
Something tugged in Harry at the look crossing Malfoy's face.
“Where is everyone? I thought I was late.”
She gave him a look. “Of course not. I’m going to take the job. But.” She pressed her hands flat on the table and flicked her head to toss some hair back. “I will make clear that I will be accepting the job on the condition that I get to come home by seven and work one weekend a month.”
Harry nodded, distracted by the guide’s tweed hat and boat shoes. Malfoy’d been right, tweed wasn’t for young people. And the combination with the shoes somehow seemed more offensive than any nudity or fetishists.
“Checks out,” he said, after a fashion. “But when someone’s flagged, we’ve still gotta ask ‘em some questions first. Check for Dark residue, ill intent, and what not.”
“Shall we?”
Draco tugged his mouth into a customer service smile. “Not necessary, Potter. Just trying to do my job.”
“This is who you are,” Malfoy was saying, voice cracking. Once in a while he paused with a wet, shivering breath. “This is who you are.”
“The public was right, you mean.” Malfoy straightened the papers on his desk, though they already looked quite straight to Harry, even from his angle.
The city sprawled before them, sparkling with light. The newly built highrises, made almost entirely of glass, glittered as cars passed in and out of the city along winding skyways. Further out, over the water, clouds hung low, and fog reached like fingers toward them. Each breath felt cold and clear.
) outing for furniture shopping with Ron and Hermione. The cover stories still kept coming. The first week had featured a series, each day recounting a different case he’d been a part of with International Operations: the recent arrests of political agitators in Spain; a Mer trafficking ring based near Florida in the United States; a cell of Dark wizards trying to resurrect ancient Mayan leaders from tombs in Honduras; a group of MagiScientists along the E.U.-Russian border coordinating to spell humanitarian aid packages to amplify hostile emotions in whomever opened it. The Prophet failed, of course, to address the crucial fact that Harry had not been the sole or even primary person on these investigations—they had all required teams of at least five other people. He remained grateful the Prophet’s circulation did not extend beyond the U.K.’s borders. The other Ops members would never let him live it down. The next week had covered some of the unsolved cases he’d been kept home for, ending with his previously least favourite story:
Her eyes narrowed, sharper now. “Oh?”
“Right.” Draco forced his attention away from his undressing to look up at the ceiling. Only Harry seemingly took the stretch of his neck as an invitation to trace the line of his pulse with his tongue. Draco stuttered as spoke: “So the theory is, one person is… is only entitled to,
“So the takeaway is, she’ll make an effort to work less, and we’re going to look for a place of our own. And then we’ll take it from there.”
She caught it with ease. “It has actually. We're doing Christmas on our own this year. Things have been so busy, figured we should reserve a few days for ourselves."
Potter’s face soured. “Whatever. Don’t deliver any more of those to me. They could send a thousand, and I’d burn every one of them.”
“I bet. Probably makes it hard to get serious, too, moving around so much.”
Harry lifted his chin. "I'm sure." He took a biscuit as well and cocked his head. “Does Charlotte really think I dress like a yuppie?”
“But, it lifts their spirits, sir. You set an example.”
“She’s been a good sister to him.”
He blamed it on the novelty. Since the trials, Draco had seen Potter only once before. The lights in the Soho bar made it hard to see, but Draco felt Potter’s magic in the air. It filled the space, danced along the bodies that moved around him. Draco didn’t understand how Muggles couldn’t feel that power. Taste it, like Draco could. He nearly worked up the courage to approach him, after a few drinks. Potter’d testified for the Malfoys. They’d swapped saving lives. Surely they could share a drink in a Muggle pub. But he’d waited too long. From his corner, Draco watched Potter fall into the arms of a redhead too well dressed to be a Weasley, and too broad to be Ginevra. The pair left the bar together, and Draco returned alone to the Manor. A few months later, Potter would be gone.
Of course she did. He smiled a little and reached out to grab her foot and squeeze. She gave him a small smile back.
“Was fine.” He turned a page. Good. They weren’t going to talk about it.
“Well, Harry likes my office,” he said, pivoting to the more welcoming thought of the warm look on Harry’s face the first time he’d stopped by Draco’s shop to look around. The way his rough fingers had trailed over the dark leather furniture in the reception area, the trusts and estates periodicals laid out, before he settled into Draco’s chair (cheeky bastard) to sign up as a client.
“You have three years to get those credits,” Malfoy eventually said. Harry threw up a careless hand.
“Of course, of course. You should have said something.” She stepped back. Once they were out of the way, he waved the door closed. Hermione swiped at her eyes with her jumper sleeves.
The lightness in Draco’s chest faded. Of course. Bachelor’s Eve was meant for a raucous gathering of unattached celebrating in a stupor of booze, not two blokes sharing a dinner and drinks like it was a date or something. This, Draco,
Potter frowned, but answered: “They want me to go back.”
Before Harry could reply, Malfoy was gone.
Malfoy picked up a blueberry parfait, then moved down to the coffee display. “I see.”
"Speaking of liquor," Hermione said, squeezing Harry's shoulders as she passed him. With a flick of her wand, the dark cabinets in the corner flew open to let out a steady line of bottles and silver accoutrements. The items assembled themselves neatly behind the makeshift bar. The three of them had put it together last year from a desk Harry never used. Hermione surveyed the stock and asked, "What sounds appealing? I've just enough cherries left to make you that old fashioned you like. Otherwise, we’ve been partial to an Earl Grey Martini lately."
“We are friends. Great friends. But that was before–” He stopped.
“You don’t have to talk to me. You can pretend I’m someone else if you have to.” Carefully, Harry turned his head, letting his nose trace the sloping arch of Malfoy’s. “But let it be different for now.”
Draco focused very close on a crease in a pair of his trousers. “You’re being compared to the likes of Jenkins and Flemings. It’s not a very competitive pool.”
Harry got to his feet, arms rigid at his sides. What utter bullshit. You could be whoever you wanted: do what you did and didn’t want. “I think I’m starting to understand what you were saying earlier. Except the problem isn’t me, or how other people perceive you, Malfoy. It’s not that I can’t like you—it’s that
“Ah,” Harry said, crossing his hands to avoid fidgeting. This is what people did. Friends did. He just needed to listen.
“Someone had to supervise him. We both know how reckless he is when he’s
Harry did nothing with the information. Not at first. Not intentionally. The Daily Prophet was mostly to blame. The elder Malfoys, their house arrest complete, had held a coming out ball for themselves to mark their return to polite society, and the coverage had made the front page. Harry knew this because Hermione had extensively mentioned to him over lunch how the news had brought up all of Ron’s old feelings and they’d rowed again about her working at the Ministry. Harry had stared at the paper and wondered if the youngest Malfoy had attended. Whether there were photos. Hermione had left their lunch early when she caught sight of someone who’d been avoiding her meeting requests, and she forgot the paper in her rush. So Harry took it with him. He had to put the paper in the bin, of course, where it belonged. And if it meant he could also confirm that the answer to both his questions was yes, well, it was because the front page hadn’t talked about anything else.
The shutter of a camera sounded as soon as he approached the Ministry. Of course it did. He always forgot about the damn papers when he came back after too long. Harry kept on past the coffee shop, his stomach making a mournful whine when he caught a sniff of freshly baked goods. The man in his periphery didn’t look like anyone from The Daily Prophet’s usual rotation, but Harry still lifted up his briefcase to block the next set of shots. They were always more enthusiastic the first few days after he returned. He'd told the team to hold off on publicly announcing the arrests, hoping he'd have a few days unnoticed, but it had been a flashy case the Spanish Ministry was eager to advertise as a swift success, even if they'd needed foreign aid to finish it.
Where Barcelona and Madrid always smelled of spices, this place hummed with music. He stopped by a number of tents offering local art or jewelry, but a bit beyond that, a group took turns dancing to blasting hip hop. At the next corner, a musician played drums on a bucket to back up a recorded jazz track. Crowds of other tourists moved with him around the groups. He stepped along with them, pausing for the occasional local shop between chain stores. In one of the storefronts, he saw his reflection as others rushed past. Just one of a thousand faces looking in that day.
But Malfoy accepted it. Eventually.
“Yes, though I did not sign up to get constantly accosted at the same time.” He rolled his shoulders and some of the tension seemed to leave him. Just when Harry started to scrape for something to say, Malfoy nodded his head toward the window.
Harry’s hands slowed for a moment, then gave an extra correction or two anyway. As he flicked off the light and shrugged his coat on, he paused.
Harry enjoyed the warmth in Draco’s eyes for a few moments longer. “So does that mean you’ll be washing your own work clothes from now on? Getting yourself out of bed?”
Sand had been cleared off the circle, as had the cans and magazine. He saw it fully now, the intricate overlap of the lines and runes. Crushed flowers and leaves, trapped in a thick liquid, criss-crossed the surface. Hollowed cacti held unlit candles. And the lines sank deep into the wood now, disappearing down.
“Harry?” Harry looked up from where he had been watching the dance of Draco’s fingers. “Can you do it? I…”
He moved through the fog, pushed it back to get out: “Whatever you want.”
All at once, Harry felt tired. Drained.
“Well, if we get everything confirmed, I’ll have you both in on the raid. I could use the extra help when the time comes, anyway.”
“Don’t get him started.” Malfoy’s voice washed over Harry’s spine from somewhere to his right. Harry stood a little straighter. Dave waved Malfoy off, tapping at the screen.
“I was thinking about staying a little longer, actually. I was going to head out next week, but something’s come up. Could keep me here for a few months, if I let it.”
“What about Dublin?”
Harry circled the furniture, arms swinging with his steps. “Moving is a big change.” He unbuttoned his jacket, and Draco followed the inches of skin that appeared. “I’ve been telling myself I’d move out of old Grimm for almost a decade, but who knows now? Thought turning thirty would cause some kind of panic or epiphany, but here we are.”
in a looping script along the side.
“What’s this, then?” Harry asked, once he came to. Malfoy was already looking back down. Harry took in the short hair, cream jumper, and light brown trousers. He seemed warm, somehow, despite his pale skin and the bullpen’s terrible lighting. When Malfoy didn’t speak, Harry shook the memo again.
A couple were seated around the corner from Harry’s seat shortly after, and once he’d broken the ice—Americans often warmed to a British accent, he’d found—he took the time to ask them about the area, where they worked, how long they’d been around. When his food came to him, he was surprised at the time.
Her mouth became a thin line. “A week ago.”
“Saguaro,” Potter said.
“He felt very clever at the store,” Hermione said, walking over to hand them each a drink. “I was partial to a literary one myself, but he convinced me we needed to have your interests in mind.” The pair of them shared a quick look.
“Truly. I didn’t even pick it out myself. A salesperson at Harrods did.” A young salesperson who had watched Draco wander to and from the second floor over and over for at least half a day selecting and rejecting all manner of gifts, before said salesperson finally took pity on him and intervened. As if Draco was supposed to know what to give Harry
“Harry,” Draco breathed, the longing and ache of it mirroring the press of want pulling Harry closer. His name sounded sacred, pure, in that tone of voice, an evocation. It sent his hands searching over warm, soft skin, burdened shoulders, narrow hips. He maneuvered them to the right, stopping when he felt Draco’s hips hit the bathroom counter. The jostling separated them briefly, and Harry spared no time shifting to trace the salt-lined trail down one cheek, then the other, sliding a thigh deep between Draco’s to press closer, the contact not enough. He wanted, Merlin, he wanted. When he moved forward to kiss Draco again, Draco kissed back, a brief brush, a second deeper draw, before his hands curled up around Harry’s shoulders to stop him. His eyes were closed when Harry looked at him, the corners tight with strain.
“I haven’t, no. Haven’t had an active matter at home since, so. Didn’t imagine they’d, er, have anything relevant to me.” Harry almost braved Draco’s face, but opted for reading the book title again. “You know how it goes, Departments send administerial memos all the time. Who to talk to, new procedures and all that tripe. If it were important, someone usually flags it for me eventually.”
And the shower kept on.
Potter nodded toward the corner where it shifted into view. “It’s not mine. You can’t own a Deniden, they’re meant to warn Muggles away. I’ve just been following him where he goes. He can feel it, too, in these places.”
Malfoy turned to him, his eyes a hazy grey in the fog. “What do you think I’m doing now, sitting at that desk all day? At least here there’d be no one to bother me.”
Harry set his fork down. “Is this what we’re going to talk about all lunch? Because if so, I have plenty of tedious topics to focus on at my desk, thanks.”
Ron turned off the burners and set out their plates, humming to himself.
Pansy’s sharp laugh echoed, and she gestured to the bartender. At his inquiry, Draco conceded that yes, mistakes had been made, and the martini should go. This time, he ordered champagne.
Harry tried to take his hand back, but she wouldn’t let him. “The only chance we really get to chat, just the two of us, is a lunch or two at work, some dinners at home if Ron’s late at the shop. And I have tried to hint at some of these things, the last couple years, but either I’ve been too subtle, or you’ve been ignoring it. You deserve to be happy, Harry, you should get a break from being Mr. Everything, but it doesn’t leave a lot of room for the rest of us. Wherever you go, you leave us behind.” Her eyes, shining again, spilled tears over her cheeks. They were silent this time.
Draco paused, tray in hand as he stepped through the entrance. Harry had dressed down to his navy blue button up, the sleeves rolled to his elbows. His suit jacket curled over the armchair Draco usually worked in, and its edges brushed the tops of the paperwork piles Draco’d left there. Harry had his back to the kitchen as his attention switched across the moving photos dispersed on the book shelves. Draco’d just added some from their trip to Paris.
Pansy relented in favor of throwing back the two shots she’d ordered. “I’m sure it is,” she said, setting each glass down with a bang. “I’m sorry I’ll miss his face when he opens it.” She stood and started to gather her coat.
About sixty feet away from them were several fully nude people, ranging from solidly in their thirties to seventy-somethings. None had ventured into the water, though a few had their feet dancing in the seemingly freezing waves that slid up the shore. Instead, most were laid out on blankets or making castles in the sand. Harry blinked several times before he took them for real.
He threw it back with a little curve. "How are you? Has the Christmas crisis of 2007 been resolved?"
“Dave, if you had explained
Harry put the pen back and walked to the guest room. He slumped against the door once he’d opened it and turned on the lights. Boxes were everywhere. He hadn’t unpacked at all before he’d left last time. The room switch idea had been last minute. And of course he’d left his suitcase in the living room.
“I understand that I’ve sunk low, Potter, but not that low. Or this low, for that matter,” he said with a gesture to their surroundings. “Theo’s in Vegas with Pansy. L.A. wasn’t quite enough for him.”
“Ugh, that’s right. Draco said that yesterday, but I am shit at names.” Harry blinked at the casual use of Malfoy’s name. Dave opened his side dish of some sort of potato mash. “Kind of funny how it abbreviates to ‘Mom,’ isn’t it? Can’t tell if that’s better or worse than ‘MACUSA.’” Dave hummed around a spoonful of the mash. “‘Mom’ is a lot friendlier.”
International portkey travel to the United States occurred only from a few designated, pre-approved locations and times for easier MACUSA monitoring. He was scheduled for the one out of Ditcheat at eight p.m. Since he’d been there before, he Apparated to the designated point, grabbed dinner at the nearby inn, and took his time wandering from the square to the portkey location. His lungs filled from deep greedy breaths of the fresh air as he walked, the energy of a new destination already buzzing in his limbs. When he reached the designated tree in a nearby field, he could see the crowd of people further out mingling around a large, overturned umbrella. He scanned for the familiar blond head of hair, but Malfoy wasn’t there yet.
“I really hate this.” Harry nodded in penance, letting his mouth wander and press at his right shoulder, the juncture of his neck and the birthmarks there, then back, repeating his attention on the other half of his body.
Harry stared at his reflection in their room’s bathroom mirror. His curls, wet and clumped from his shower, hung deep over his forehead. He used the towel to rub away the moisture and make the mess look at least somewhat intentional. Not that it mattered. It was just a bit of shopping. Maybe with a colleague.
“Mm,” he said aloud. Words were hard to find. “And what is that?”
She was right. Different tactics were required. “Pansy, please. You can’t leave me alone with him. Not entirely. Just… stay until he arrives at least. And maybe a minute longer."
Malfoy shook his head, watching a couple of cars get into an aggressive honking match with distaste. “Not in particular.” When Harry didn’t say anything, Malfoy added: “It’s been years since I’ve left the country. The last time we went anywhere worth shopping from, we—” Malfoy shook away whatever thought he had and said instead: “I don’t have anyone specific in mind.”
“Sir?”
She quirked an eyebrow at him and tossed the ball with a bit of force. "What about me?"
Eventually, Draco’s gaze steadied to Harry’s in the mirror. Harry smiled, glancing down at their hands and back. With effort, Draco guided their hands to the tie at his waist. He guided one side out of the loop, then another. When both strands hung loose from his hands and dragged in the water, a small sound left him.
He glanced again at the restaurant entrance. The angle wasn’t ideal from his cordoned off spot at the far end of the bar. He could just make out the door through the gaps in the liquor shelves. He needed to be diligent if he wanted time to brace for Harry’s arrival.
“Well, my connection in here is terrible.” Dave put his phone away. “I swear, wasn’t there something a while back about some psychopath attacking a school? Somewhere in the UK? Right around there. Or am I crazy?”
“This is supposed to make me keep you from slipping?”
Arsehole. Draco kept his temper even. “Just me,” Draco said.
“Are you busy for the next few hours?” Harry listened for an answer, then jumped when Malfoy peered around the edge of the open bathroom door.
Harry laughed and followed her toward the sidelines. “Yeah, you do like to get in moves when no one’s looking, it seems.”
“Come now,” he said quietly, rubbing circles into her back. It always worked with Teddy. “Ron will come around. He always does, in the end. It's just... a rough spot. Something he'll need to consider for a bit, once he's calmed."
The conversation was slipping away from him. Harry leaned back to set his elbows on the bar. “You work for them, too.”
Before Malfoy could step away, Harry curled his fingers around the elbow of the other man’s jacket. The fabric felt soft, pliant under his fingers, though Malfoy’s body beneath was sharp and hard. “Come on, where are you going? What does it even matter here? We’re different people.”
“Technically, it was the good people of this country that solved them.” Harry dug around his wilted salad for croutons and the lone tomato it came with. “He just picked out the right tips.”
“Yeah.” Harry wet his lips, unable to resist the smile stretching across his face. “I’d like that a lot.”
Malfoy watched him over the rim of his seven and seven. “What can I say, good work gets awarded with more work.” Malfoy turned away to scan the crowd. The strobed lights flickered over his face, turning his pale, unblemished skin a rotating palette of muted blues, greens, and purples.
Other than forgetting the List, like an idiot. This was exactly what happened when he Got Involved. Maybe he’d make a portable version of it when he moved to Spain. Though, he supposed, he wouldn’t really need it there. Strangers at a bar were never that complicated.
The bed shook with small tremors. Harry closed his eyes hard.
“And the Deniden? Is it yours?”
Draco tossed the thought aside. “And it would have been worth it, because I could guilt you for that
"And I've told you,” Harry said, pulling away to grab his wheeled baggage. “This is the best way to avoid any unwelcome surprises." That, and nine times out of ten, he forgot to ring ahead. Once a case was solved, he closed out any and all loose ends before facing the trip back to England. So, his return remained as much a surprise for himself as for them. Seemed fair, on the whole. As Harry shut the door, Ron waved off the remark and crossed the large open room to the kitchen.
“Alright. Technically, I wrapped your gift. Still counts.”
“Well, why don’t you go double-check while I talk to your grandmother, and then we’ll leave in a bit?” Teddy nodded and bounded up the stairs. Harry went and slumped in front of the large coffee mug already set out in front of his usual seat at the kitchen table.
Harry pushed his glasses up and leaned on the counter. She rarely asked him for anything. “Oh?”
Given the extent of the misdoings, he tried to contemplate how the DMLE had not picked up on the issues during their case prep. And then reviewed Malfoy’s sixth folder. The file was dedicated to the longstanding relationship and history between the two Aurors and one of the leading prosecutors for the DMLE—the same prosecutor that had taken their cases to trial. So working near Hermione in her department turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
Auror Flemings leaned over his own folded arms from the cubicle on Harry’s other side to ask: “Aren’t those the ones that wanted to blow up that Muggle sports thing? Like a World Cup match, but not Quidditch?”
A Ministry package arrived the next day. Draco sent it back with the requisite form for non-acceptance. The Ministry of Magic did not seem to care whether Harry Potter wanted their packages. Each day, they sent another, and each day, Draco returned it. The smog came back to the city. The days blurred once again.
“Do you mind?”
Steeling himself, he walked through the doors, gazed fixed forward. He breathed through his mouth, avoiding any possible hint of mint he might catch. That could make the next week or however manageable. Jenkins and Flemings weren’t at their desks yet, and he was glad for that small mercy. Might be worth coming in early more often just for that.
From several feet away, he called Potter’s name again. No response. He approached the front door, stopping only when the roof blocked the sun and he could finally catch the glistening red objects hanging halfway to the floor. Hundreds of red peppers, layer after layer, extended down in thick ropes. At each end, cotton bulged from between coiled layers of wheat-coloured twine. The air smelled of smoke and sage.
“Conversation run dry?” Harry asked.
After a few moments, taking care, Harry reached to run a hand through Draco’s hair. “That’s more elaborate than my excuse.”
“You can piss off now, Malfoy.” Potter’d leaned back in the chair, the heels of his hands pressed hard against his eyes.
“Sorry, Parks, I meant to get it wrapped, but I was in a bit of a rush to get here. It was Charlotte’s idea.” He pushed his glasses up. They were terribly smudged, and the warmth of the restaurant had caused them to fog. Draco pressed his hands into his pockets. If he didn’t, they risked doing something reckless, like tracing the flush of cold along Harry’s cheeks and nose.
Robards still seemed a bit deflated. Harry forced a little extra effort into his smile. “Thank you again, sir. I’m grateful.”
Fair. He stood and crossed to the side of the wall directly opposite her and sat back down. He held his hands open for her to toss the ball. “And what about you?"
“You’re early.” She put her book down and looked him over, then added: “Will tea be enough for you, or shall I make something stronger?”
“They most certainly do. There’s an island out in that bay, Alcatraz, and they used to put all their worst criminals on it. Muggles, as far as I know. They no longer use it—some people managed to escape once, and what’s the point of a prison that isn’t as inescapable…” Malfoy looked at him, and when their eyes met something tightened in Harry’s chest.
“Before you open yours, I have to say that it’s from me
The pamphlet said it would take anywhere from four to seven days for his credits to process. He’d reread it in the room, killing time before going to the portkey station himself. Up to a week in that office. Passing
it. The paper wrapping snapped and coiled off. Then page by page, the fire consumed it.
All that while, the bathroom lights had been off.
“Please tell me you’re not going to leave that sopping cotton dressing gown sit there the whole time,” Draco muttered after a while, his feet pressing the discarded clothing away from him. Harry snorted.
“What about you? This place is new.”
Malfoy scanned his face, then met his eyes and held them. “Remember what we talked about, at the happy hour? How the current evolution of policing, maintaining order, is surveillance? Well, how do you get around, accomplish things, in a system where everyone’s watching?”
“Well, better to be explicit,” she said. Harry nodded.
“Potter? You’re here?” Malfoy’s gaze ran across Harry’s face, lingering over his forehead. Malfoy shook himself out of it. “I didn’t—”
“I’m not sure what is making you force me to have this conversation, Potter, but I am perfectly capable of casting a Lumos sufficient for night time use. Thanks for your permission to use the lights, though.”
Harry left the bathroom, his hand ruffling a towel through his hair. He turned at Malfoy’s sharp inhale.
Harry blinked at that, his head beginning to turn from side to side. “It’s the deal the Ministry made with your family. We make them all the time.”
She swatted at him, but he managed to dodge with a deft step to the other side of the lift.
“Because I already know what it says.”
“Mind if I spell the curtain’s closed?” Harry asked, more for himself. Draco shrugged, and Harry waved them shut.
“Punishment used to be like that.” Malfoy leaned against one of the iron window pieces. His drink, a smoky purple, looked almost blue in the fading light. “Public, I mean. It was entertainment as much as retribution. Lock people up in the stocks for days. Hang them in the public square. The whole town would gather to watch.”
Harry tossed the book aside and sat up on the bed. “I don’t like it, obviously. It’s not right. But I can’t solve every problem in that Auror Department and do my job. A man has limits. I’d never stop working.”
"Mm, she’s older. Kids long grown, husband dead. Watch out for that step.”
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry said, raising his voice to carry around the bathroom door and down the hallway to their bed. The bathroom fan was loud, but Harry made out the familiar tones asking ‘What?’ a few seconds later.
She pulled back enough to see they were still in the open doorway.
Taking in the relaxed curve of Malfoy’s shoulders, the ease around his eyes, Harry nodded. “Seems tough, to sit around staring at nothing for days. By yourself.” Harry clasped his hands back together after using them for emphasis. “Again, not for me.”
Harry looked over at him, then Hermione, who avoided his eye. “He did,” Harry said.
“—and it would be great to have an extra set of hands.”
Draco nodded. “After the… everything, he reached out to Theo about coming to the States and working for him. He has a delivery service based out here and a few other big cities. Ones where the animal labour issue is more of a thing, I guess.”
“So, what happened?” Andy’s directness made it hard to avoid her. She didn’t fill him up with food and pie first like Molly Weasley, lulling him into the warmth of her home and a food coma. Harry ran his fingers over the faded Cafe du Monde logo of his mug. He could still take his time.
"Right. I want you to leave me alone."
Reaching over to his file cabinet, Harry began to pull out the various CRAPI Memorandums. Once they started to cover his desk, the mint followed, even after all this time. He pushed them to the furthest end of his desk to help his focus. He’d also forgotten his file cabinet was forever extendable (and just how long he’d been ignoring the messages). He leaned back in his chair once the drawer was empty. Five stacks, each five files deep, were arranged along the length of his desk and the furthest cubicle wall. He sighed.
Harry and Hermione waited out the rush of feelings in silence. When Ron’s voice finally cracked, and his knees began to give, they were there on either side of him again, leading him to the ground and holding him close. They met eyes over Ron’s shoulders, his hiccups echoing in their periphery. Hermione had already prepared her five-year plan: the next year helping with the Hogwarts rebuilding efforts and studying Memory Charms with Flitwick; joining the anticipated Eighth Year that followed to get her N.E.W.T.S; some months in Australia to try and recover her parents; and after that, the Ministry. As for Harry, he’d already begun his training for the Aurors. It hovered between them—Ron’s declaration, their current and future plans.
Harry curled his toes to avoid the urge to press further into that wandering hand. “I’m more of a head first kind of guy.”
"Well, you’re getting better." Ron stood and stretched wide. He gave Harry a firm clap around the shoulders before heading toward the master bedroom. "Glad we’ll have you around for a while.”
“It’s nothing personal. As you said yourself, this is the last conference before your continuing education credits are due. If you don’t go to this one, it’ll take you three months before the next qualifying conference is held in Belgium, and I’m sorry to say that not even you can work with a lapsed Auror certification. They do give you three years to get all your credits, Auror Potter, and there have been plenty of conferences in that time. No one to blame but yourself on this one.”
Once they were out of sight, Harry closed his eyes and indulged in a brief fantasy of walking into Robards’s office with a tidy report about some of the tactics that likely got those two their arrests. The backdated warrants. The bribes Jenkins liked to give. The pair of them took a whole portion of The List that Harry kept only in his mind: the bit he couldn’t risk sitting out there publicly for anyone to view. But he wasn’t Getting Involved. He opened his eyes and finished sorting the last of his receipts.
Harry drew them over to a narrow coffee shop they’d smelled from halfway down the block. There was a long queue, so they shuffled slowly toward the entrance. Malfoy read out loud from the sign that explained it was a former coat room for the theater beside it. “Is this whole city full of things that aren’t things? Like that house that’s a conference centre, and now this place?”
Harry focused out to sea at the reminder. London had felt so far away. When he looked back down, Malfoy looked at with the same steady gaze. Those grey eyes gleamed against the dark sea behind him.
“Please, I’m the intimidating arse at work, why would she tell me?”
Draco glared at her and welcomed the arrival of his drink. “A scarf, actually.”
Harry remained at the top of Kite Hill. People tried to walk their dogs in the area, even this late, though something in Harry’s expression seemed to make them wary and turn back the way they came.
“Sorry, Susan,” he said, catching her in time to avoid the sharp edge of a desk.
“Get a breakthrough on that case of yours?”
“That’s all right,” Flemings said, snickering.
The next morning, as they walked along the table of breakfast foods, Malfoy frowned and parsed through the collection of parfaits. This seemed as good a time as any, so Harry helped himself to a few pieces of toast on the nearby tray and said, “You can turn the lights on next time.”
Harry got his notepad and pamphlet out. The first day had established that the conference far exceeded his scope at work and the level of surveillance went beyond that of the Ministry, too, but Malfoy had him curious now. It would give them something safe to talk about, at least.
Harry scowled. “Oi, refusing to sell biscuits for doxies does not make me a monster.”
His stomach turned. He’d delayed enough.
This one had lived a life. His dirty clothes were nothing to the necklaces that wound his neck or the rings that covered his fingers. They ranged from thick to thin, bone white to black and purple, matte to shining. Ochre lines ran along his skin beneath from the rings’ edges, peaked past his collar and sleeves. The shadows beneath his eyes were nearly as dark.
“But,” Malfoy continued. “We could talk about it over dinner. Maybe. If you wanted to.”
His hands were numb by the time he stepped into the hotel lobby, even after the warming charms, and he considered picking up some tea from the lobby cafe when he saw Malfoy’s curled figure at a table in the corner. Harry moved closer to a wall to get a better look at him. Several to-go cups and half-eaten pastries sat on the table. He had the same book as earlier, open now, though he wasn’t reading it. Malfoy pushed his fringe out of his eyes and observed the crowds going in and out. He seemed to shrink if any of the other patrons moved too close to him or a conversation grew too loud.
“It’s a good opportunity to meet experts in the field,” Malfoy said. “And to promote my department.”
“So I didn’t make it up?” He traced the curve of Harry’s cheek, nestled beneath his glasses. His voice left him whisper soft.
“There’s a season of events, among all the old families. They rotate hosting balls, hunts, gaming nights. A lot of empty conversation and boasting in formal clothes.”
“Don’t worry, I’ve been made well aware of what a shit I’ve been. You’re still on The List, though.” He let his feet bend and slide down to sit beside her. “How’s Ron?”
At a small table in an Italian restaurant, facing the large glass windows along the pavement, Harry reviewed the titles from the day’s presentations and tried to remember what the speakers had said. ‘The
“That’s different, he can’t speak the language, I had to go.”
Harry pulled the striped green jumper over his grey shirt. “Really? Guess you’re stuck with me again, then. I would’ve figured you for the wine tasting tour.”
Harry’s laugh echoed in his chest. “Some credit please? I’d obviously move your body. Maybe I’d put you in the guest room. Stick a copy of Hermione’s N.E.W.T. marks in your hand.”
“Fine,” she said with a strong shake of her curls. “Fine. A woman can try. Hopefully you’ll at least be a little helpful and tell the Auror bullpen about it tomorrow?”
“Afternoon,” Harry said, handing over his identification. “I’m actually here together with that gentleman you just pulled aside, Draco Malfoy? I work with him at the Ministry of Magic. There should be something, actually, that indicates that.” Harry nodded toward the official’s computer. He looked Harry over, then spent some time reviewing something.
“Alright, let’s hear it.”
Draco’s hands slid around Harry’s neck and shoulders until he could press his face into Harry’s hair. The lithe body in Harry's arms grew heavier, loose. Harry walked backwards in small steps, guiding Draco along with him. He was careful not to let them press too far apart. The forming intimacy relied on contact, like Draco would remember himself without the warm body against him. To take him out of himself. Harry flicked out the light. Then, at the bed, Harry crawled back on to it, but took Draco’s hands before he did, leading him around and under the sheets. Draco laid on his side, and Harry curled around him, pulling him back into Harry’s chest.
Harry nodded and added another string of kisses as encouragement. When he reached the edge where Draco’s palm met the flat of his hand, he gave it a small nip and pulled back. “Turn around for me?”
I see you as Harry Potter. And you.” He searched Harry’s face, his body. “Of all people,
Harry made his voice softer. “The lights, in the room. Or the bathroom. Whichever. It was nice of you to keep them off last night, but I’m not the world’s lightest sleeper. You can turn them on to see, or whatever, it won’t bother me.”
Harry sputtered, more surprised than offended to hear the epithet after all these years. Worse, he could clearly imagine Ron wearing them, and he smacked his chest to clear his airway of biscuit crumbs.
“And.” Draco flattened his jacket down. Adjusted one of the buttons. “And it’s the first thing I’ve managed that wasn’t… set up for me. Or expected of me.”
Draco turned. Before he finished, Harry pressed along his back, his head settling on Draco’s shoulder. His arms wrapped close around Draco’s torso. He could make out the darks of their outline in the far mirror, but no details. He let them stand there for a few moments first, the lavender coming back to him. Pressing his mouth to the unsteady beat in Draco’s throat, Harry flicked his wrist and lit the several wood wicked candles throughout the room. They sparked, instantly making their faces and bodies clearer in the mirror, but they kept a shadowy quality to the room overall.
The St. Clair had hosted every Bachelor’s Eve since the beginning, the high ceilings and perpetually drunk clientele providing cover for their interhouse mix of post-War revelry, the unguilty celebration of a bunch of twenty-somethings being unwed and untied and young and alive. Until person by person, the members of their group settled down and stayed home, leaving only Draco and Harry now. And Pansy, “maybe,” whatever that was supposed to mean.
Harry left early for his portkey Wednesday evening after putting on the longer-lasting Glamour he always used when going overseas. It corrected his vision, covered up his scar, and gave his hair a little warmth, appearing dark brown rather than ebony. He felt lighter as soon as it washed over him.
The woman speaking Spanish narrowed her eyes when she finished speaking with her companion. “You have an iPhone, Dave, look it up.”
The clock said 2:36 a.m. when Harry looked again. He pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes until colours formed in the dark, a kaleidoscope of sparks.
Harry swallowed, feeling heat from where Malfoy almost pressed along the length of him. His free hand flexed in the space near Malfoy’s hips. It would be nothing to set it in the arch where hipbones met waist. They would fit. It would feel nice. This close, he couldn’t pretend otherwise. He nodded, slowly, and watched the surprise starting to spread in Malfoy’s face.
She smiled at him and wiped her hands on her apron. “I’ll believe it when I see it. Just make sure you try everything.”
“The witches out in the Haight have all but left across the bay now. Berkeley, Oakland, you’ll find a lot more over there. Here, you just can’t rely on things the same way. I tried to Apparate to the shop the other day and found myself on that street corner across the street. Finally caved and got myself a Prius.”
Draco let Harry press him back against the couch and watched in disbelief as Harry sat astride him. The squeezing heat between his thighs, the promising hardness matching his own, fluttered Draco’s eyes closed, his head back against the couch.
Before Harry could respond, the bartender handed them each a drink. He let Malfoy get a few swigs down and enjoyed his personal victory. Theory proved. “I get that. That’s one of the nice things about getting away once in awhile. If no one knows who you are, you get to decide how they see you.”
“Never could back down from a challenge,” he said. A wind ran through the street, then, carrying the smell from the coffee shop they’d gone to for souvenirs yesterday. It smelled warm, like hazelnuts. Standing where he was, Harry caught the increasingly familiar hint of mint from Malfoy as well. It was easy, in that moment, to imagine the Malfoy he’d never known. One that wasn’t burdened with a hateful upbringing and then a tarnished past. Who needn’t hide behind wealth or Manor walls or towers made of paper. Instead he could just be a bloke on this street full of neon lights and rainbow coloured pavements, enjoying an overpriced biscuit with a mix of friends. With Harry.
At that, Potter stared into the fire. Draco could barely see the green against the flames.
Once Flemings and Jenkins came in to work, Harry cast a surreptitious charm over the pages. He doubted they’d pay much attention to one of Malfoy’s memos, but if they bothered to snoop, they’d only see administrative guidelines on how to appropriately process a targeted review by the CRAPI Department.
“It would be, to most people today. But death was so much closer to daily life back then. Sick beds in their homes. Wheeling their dead into the streets. And anyway, the point was for it to be unpleasant. To show people here, this is what happens when you cross the line. Nevermind the satisfaction for victims, getting to see their wrongdoer punished.” Harry watched Malfoy’s delicate gestures. His voice had gone soft, but Harry had no trouble making out his words against the din.
Silence.
“Ugh.” He sat up, his hands flung out to either side of him. Malfoy didn’t seem the type to fall asleep in a bathroom. Hadn’t seemed that drunk either. Maybe it was a ploy? To distract him while he stayed somewhere else? No, Malfoy’s bag still sat in its same neat spot on the hotel luggage rack. And it seemed too elaborate a ruse. Harry checked the hallway again. The question remained what the hell he was still doing in there. What he had been doing the whole trip.
“You tosser, there’s no typo, I can’t believe you!" He flashed his eyes up at Draco and made to pull the bag away, but Draco moved faster this time.
