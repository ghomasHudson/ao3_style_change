Hermione shut her eyes. “No, but you should. Don’t set a bad precedent. You don’t want to make Draco feel as if he has to choose between you and them.”
Granger turned three different shades of scarlet as she pulled her hand back. "So you still hate to be touched by a mudblood?"
“So this life-debt does not encompass your most recent daring mission? Pulling Mr. Malfoy out of the flames once more—”
“Ah.” Harry didn’t bother hiding the smile in his voice. Draco was adorable when he was ridiculous. “So . . . things are going well with them?”
"Legitimate investments?" Ron looked both shocked and put out. "Merlin, Malfoy, when have you had time? You're only twenty, same as us."
"Not quite." Harry took a deep breath. "How do you feel about moving into Grimmauld Place with me? The old Black residence, I mean. For now, at least."
Harry grinned as he collapsed onto the guest-room bed. He was fairly certain that Draco’s voice—they were speaking over their mobiles—was meant to sound expectant. Perhaps even commanding. But he could hear the nervousness his boyfriend was attempting to hide.
So Potter blithely expected him to obey orders. But Draco had no desire to be interrogated by the Golden Trio, especially since he answered—in theory, at least—only to Robards or to the Minister for Magic himself.
So this must be New York. Bill Weasley had travelled here once, after the war, on Gringotts’ business. It was like London, he said, but much smaller, especially Manhattan itself. Boroughs like Brooklyn and Queens had a bit more space to them, but in Manhattan everyone was crammed against each other or piled on top of each other. And that somehow gave the city and everyone in it a jolt of energy. You felt it, Bill said, from your first breath.
Harry felt him reach over for something, and then heard him rubbing his hands together. Applying more ointment, no doubt, which seemed to sink into Harry’s muscles and burn out the soreness and tension. In a good way, of course. Harry didn't know the name of the stuff, but Draco claimed that the secret behind it had been in his family for generations. He also claimed to have improved it himself. Harry believed him; he'd always been good at potions and such.
“Hell, yeah. If everything goes well, my parents will return the invitation and allow Malfoy to come to the Burrow. And Harry never has to know that they didn’t want him there at first.”
Harry laughed again, but then his face grew serious. “Speaking of, er, disowning . . . I don’t suppose you’d be willing to meet your Aunt Andromeda? I know your mum’s not on speaking terms with her, but Andromeda’s grandchild—she’s caring for him, you know—is your second cousin or something.”
“Yeah, and I think that makes sense. I used it for wards that took weeks or even months to set. And you were always good at long-term projects. Not too many people would have had the patience and persistence to fix that vanishing cabinet.”
“Come’ere.” He pulled her down on top of him and kissed her soundly. “I don’t want to spend the whole night talking about Harry’s problems. Or the ferret’s.”
But Harry wanted Ron and Hermione to, well, look after Draco. He knew it wasn’t really necessary; Draco was an adult who had taught himself how to reject his parents’ prejudices. Who had built a new life for himself in New York. Who had also survived for three years undercover. He was obviously capable of looking after himself.
He’d have gone straight to St. Mungo’s, but Ron had texted him to let him know that he had ordered Draco home. The ferret had been up for forty-eight hours straight, Ron said; he wasn’t doing his father any good keeling over from exhaustion.
Draco groaned and sank back into the mattress. "You actually are going to be this proper and annoying, aren't you?"
“Yeah, that's one way to put it.” He choked out a half-laugh before turning serious again. “Harry, what are you thinking?”
“Yeah, that’s true.” Harry nestled his face against Draco’s neck. “I’ll do my best to come home to you in one piece, you know.” He paused to bestow a kiss on that perfect, ridiculously pale skin. “Always.”
“Enough, Potter!” Draco gave him a look. “You got what you wanted. Now lean back and let me show you what a good servant I can be.”
“Yeah. So don’t keep this from him just to protect him. You don't have to tell him, but if you want to, he’ll be okay.”
But Draco transformed before Harry could finish the sentence, and all Harry could do was laugh as a white-blond ferret scrabbled onto his chest.
Draco had told Harry a bold-faced lie: he never had any intention of just snogging like two virginal teens. At the very least, there would be more frotting-through-clothes. Or dry humping, as Harry had so inelegantly put it. The saviour couldn't possibly be virtuous enough (or infuriating enough) to resist that.
"Because—look, this isn't on you. I think, left to yourself, you'd always choose words over violence."
After a moment’s consideration, Harry released him. They both shifted until they were sitting on the bed, cross-legged, facing each other.
At length, Toffee turned up with an onion bagel for Draco, just the way he liked it: lightly toasted with lox and capers, hold the schmear. He washed it down with an excellent cup of coffee, mixed with a generous amount of milk and sugar. He had just sent her to the kitchen with the dishes when he heard the front door open.
“I will.” There was still no judgment in his voice, but there was suddenly an odd sort of determination. “We’re not going to see those memories yet, though. I need to tell you about . . . about my link with Voldemort. And how it broke.”
Fortunately, they were in a smaller, cozier dining room tonight—what did you call it? The second dining room? The family dining room? He would have to ask Draco later.
Thankfully, by the time Draco and Granger shut down the laptop the trio were almost late for their ministry jobs.
Harry swore under his breath as he read through the message once more. "Yeah. It's a consult for the Americans. They only need one of us."
Draco, meanwhile, had successfully penetrated the shirt by sacrificing a button up near the collar. He had even turned himself around, temporarily, so he could peek out the top of the garment, facing Harry.
"Shacklebolt can do that while you're in America," Draco pointed out. "I've heard he's not afraid of muggle technology. Which airport is he sending you to?"
So he had set aside his embarrassment and explained that he had to visit Myrtle. That he had promised her he would from time to time.
Draco seemed at ease with that. "I do, to an extent. I know what it's like to share their view of the world now. Our sight is shit but our hearing is magnified and our sense of smell is extraordinary. Each person has a unique scent, did you know that? I really like yours, by the way."
“Yes.” Draco nodded. “That’s how you knew for certain that he had remained loyal to Dumbledore; that’s how you exonerated him. Posthumously.”
“Look at Weasley! He as good as said it, didn't he? He’ll tolerate me only if I'm serving you. And I’m sure that whole family of ginger paupers will feel the same.”
Then suddenly Draco's voice was back in Harry's ear. "I'm being ordered to bed, as if I were five years old."
“You really ought to visit her again before autumn, dear.” Narcissa set her own fork aside. “Or invite her to come here for a holiday.”
So Ron was in a decent mood as they left. He was ready to face the members of the press who were hovering outside, a barely respectable distance from Coralia’s front door. (Some of them must be paparazzi; there were plenty of cameras out there.) He kept his wand at the ready, though, in case anyone in the crowd thought to take a shot at Malfoy.
Hermione must’ve reached for her wand, because a moment later she had summoned a warm glow of light. “Should I ask how it went?”
“You could learn a thing or two from muggles, ill-bred or not.” Harry leaned down and kissed him. “No more stealing covers.”
And Draco was gay, wasn’t he? At least judging by his conversation with Ron. And the Prophet had outed him ages ago.
They stayed like that for a while, spent and close and satiated. When Potter finally rolled off of him, Draco tugged him over so that his head was in the crook of Draco's shoulder.
Draco remained standing, struggling to form a response. He wasn't unhappy. He wasn't furious. He was more . . . bewildered. “I'm—do you know what you're doing?”
Her voice was curious, but she didn’t seem particularly invested in the answer. They might have been discussing a recent quidditch match. Harry shook himself, just a bit, wondering if this conversation was really part of his life now.
First, Harry used his own wand and gave Draco back his. The wand seemed to work for Draco again. And not just in the perfunctory way that any wand will work for any wizard. No, it worked in a way that meant it recognised and acknowledged Draco.
“I don’t think I had even read the spell at that point,” Harry explained, sounding lame even to himself. “And if you really were willing to confess, I wouldn't have attacked you.”
“I, er, might have overstepped my authority. In fact, Draco might have commanded me to confess that to you.”
“Yeah.” George was stroking Draco’s head now. “And I’ll say this much for Malfoy: he is ridiculously pretty.”
But Harry just tightened his grip and pushed Draco back against the door. Not hard, though. Well, maybe a little hard.
“We both stink of petrol and smoke.” Malfoy paused for a racking cough. “My ears are ringing from that damned explosion too. And as for your back—well, you should have apparated us onto a bed instead of a sitting room floor.”
George turned scarlet, right to the tip of his remaining ear, but he laughed again as he shoved Draco off of him. “No, but I imagine Harry was thinking exactly that. He just might not have realised it at the time.”
Now Draco knew that Snape was acting under Dumbledore's own orders; Harry had made the truth plain to everyone after the war.
Draco was still staring at her, but now his eyes looked both startled and oddly gentle. He nodded slowly, as if it did make sense to him. But then he shook himself and pointed toward the laptop. “You’ll be due at the ministry soon—shall we get back to work?”
No, not Harry. This was Draco’s memory, and this was Draco critiquing the architecture of the Twin Towers. This was not a pensieve: Harry wasn’t just viewing Draco’s memory, he was living it.
Potter answered before he could. "Robards blackmailed him. He couldn't resist making better use of a former Death Eater with a flair for occlumency. So he threatened to seize your home and send your husband to Azkaban if Draco didn't comply."
He sounded oddly like Harry, in so far as he seemed to think he had a right to the answer. Draco couldn’t decide if that fact annoyed him or not.
The man finally smiled and seemed to relax, at least a bit. “I do know that. It didn’t look ‘untoward’—but I didn’t realise you two were so attached to Draco Malfoy. And, Ron, I didn’t expect to hear you issuing him orders as if he were a house elf.”
The film was funny. Charming, even. And there was something oddly enjoyable about watching not only with Harry, but with a cinema full of strangers. Muggle strangers, presumably, though that didn't matter in this case. What mattered was the shared reactions: laughter, mostly, but some groans as well.
The best place to talk turned out to be Hermione's cramped office at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Harry collapsed into one of the two chairs in front of her desk. Then he reached for Malfoy's arm in order to tug him into the other one.
“Our minds were linked for quite a while.” Harry’s face was bright red now. “Once he realised that he turned it against me, but . . . well, that link remained a factor in the war.”
“Right. Well, er, what about muggle synagogue life? You know about that. And Arthur would probably find that interesting.”
For now, Harry was just relieved that he'd gotten to Draco on time. He ought to have been pulled from the operation weeks ago. But the bastards at the ministry hadn't cared how much danger an ex-Death Eater was in, as long as he kept providing such valuable intelligence.
“I’m not insulted. I'm just surprised that Draco . . . well, I'm glad he has a higher opinion of Ron now.”
Draco stopped pacing and considered that. “No, Snape can’t have wanted you to fail. I’m sure he wanted to defeat the Dark Lord more than he hated you.”
That brought the holy-fucking-saviour up short. “No.” Harry shook his head vigorously. “But I—Draco, I just want to keep you safe.”
Draco actually chuckled at that. “He didn’t know how obsessed I was with you. The thoughts he saw were about my fear of him—which he enjoyed—or about me trying to live up to my father, or about my impure thoughts for other boys my age. Ah, excluding you, of course. I kept those fantasies locked up tight many layers deeper.”
Hermione furrowed her brow. Draco wasn't related to the Baumgartens, as far as she knew, so presumably that 'Uncle' and 'Aunt' were merely honorific, and a mark of the friendship between the two families.
“Oh, I don’t know, Potter. Possibly I was too busy doing the Dark Lord’s bidding so he wouldn’t murder me or my parents.”
Draco swallowed. In his head, he could still hear her screaming as Aunt Bella tortured her. "Sorry, Granger, I didn't mean to bring up—"
She pointed to a chair. Harry folded his arms over his chest, intending to find fault with whatever outfit Draco had chosen. But although Harry would never have paired that shirt with that blazer—and wouldn’t have matched either to those trousers—he couldn’t object to the overall effect. They all worked rather well together, actually. And his robes would suit them perfectly . . . .
"Yeah, sorry." Harry shook himself again. "I just, um, dunno. My brain went off track for a moment." Now was not the time to bring up patronuses. Harry would talk to Hermione later.
That took Draco completely by surprise. For a couple of seconds he didn’t seem to know what to say. But then he managed a tight, sour smile. “Fuck off, Potter. But yeah. That’s exactly it.”
With that in mind, he launched himself off Potter’s lap and smoothly transformed, landing gracefully on his feet. His clothing might be grimy and torn and Merlin only knew what his hair looked like, but he was still a Malfoy. He still knew how to carry himself.
Draco stared for another moment and then snorted. “I wouldn't blame you if you were. Look, I'm sorry for what Fenrir did to you. I didn't mean to let him into Hogwarts, but you, er . . . you have a right to hold me responsible—”
“I don’t think your own owl will try to devour you.” Harry was opening the window and guiding the horned menace inside. “This beauty belongs to Shacklebolt. Let’s see what’s so important that it couldn’t wait till morning.”
Harry and Granger had been waiting for them utside of McGonagall’s office. Draco briefly entertained the idea of sneaking off on his own, but he rather liked having two aurors to protect him. And, all right, it would have been difficult to elude them, even as a ferret.
Malfoy gave him a look that was hard to interpret. He didn't seem to mind following Harry's lead, exactly, but maybe he was struggling with the novelty of it. Or maybe he was just amazed by Hermione's plethora of SPEW posters, each advocating for equal rights and fair pay for house elves. Knowing about Hermione's activism and seeing the posters in all their manic glory were two separate things.
Draco turned around to face him. "You'd have done well in our house—don't pretend otherwise. Put it on."
Harry's lips twitched. “Yeah, but he's not my sex slave in his animagus form, obviously. And we prefer the term 'boyfriend.’”
When Harry woke up, Draco was out from under his tee-shirt, but still burrowed under the covers, curled up alongside Harry. He didn't seem to be awake yet—did most ferrets sleep so soundly?
"Kreacher blames himself." The house elf gulped down more tea and then wiped his mouth with his hand.
"Bill, George, I'm grateful for the opportunity to meet you both properly. Especially after, well, after everything my family and I have done . . . ."
She barely paused to breathe before launching into a tirade against her native Judaism in particular and all religions in general. But Hermione didn't mind, because an interesting discussion grew out of the diatribe.
Harry wasn’t even sure how to frame his next question. “Um, how many ‘layers’ had you prepared for?”
Ron snorted as he smoothed the fur on Draco's back. "Yeah, he's half in his ferret brain. But we need to establish some boundaries."
Nothing. He swore through another cough as his stomach clenched. Harry could feel Malfoy breathing, so he knew he was alive. But he wasn't sure he was conscious.
“Well, we both need a decent night’s rest, what with Weasley and Granger arriving first thing in the morning.”
“Aw, that’s sweet of you to say.” Jamie favoured him with a wide smile before turning to Shira. “I like him.”
“You need to understand this, Harry.” At the moment, Draco didn’t care that he was interrupting the man who was, rightfully, his master. “This life debt is legitimate for a reason. Without you, I’d be dead twice over, at least. I might keep stressing that it’s not legally or magically binding, but that’s just for Granger’s sake. And the public’s.”
“Is that what this is about?” Draco muttered something under his breath, but Harry couldn’t make out the words. It was probably some Yiddish curse he picked up from the Baumgartens. Even without a translation, though, it conveyed his level of frustration perfectly.
Draco let out a high-pitched ferret-screech which seemed to imply that transfiguring any of the furniture was not an acceptable solution.
“No, I don’t object.” Goyle wasn't his favourite person, but at the moment he rated higher in Harry’s esteem than Blaise or Pansey.
Harry didn't let go right away. Instead, he tightened his grip. "I expect you to hold up your end too. This agreement isn't just going to be for show on your part."
And that was all right, wasn’t it? Draco wanted it too. Consenting adults and all that. It didn’t mean that Harry was power-mad or anything. He wasn’t like Tom Riddle.
Ron didn’t realise it at first, because he was facing the opposite direction, but it was not Kreacher who opened the door and crossed the threshold. In fact, Ron only stopped wrestling because Draco had suddenly turned white. (Yes, even whiter than usual.) And then Hermione let out a little gasp, which she quickly turned into a welcoming smile.
Draco sighed. "Potter has saved my life four times in total. Once from that fiendfyre, once in the Battle of Hogwarts afterward, once—"
“No, you've always been about raw, undisciplined power. But it doesn't matter—we’ve already talked about that duel. I’m not even counting it.” Draco paused to roll down his sleeve again.
“Apparently,” Harry yawned and leaned back against his chair so that it was balancing dangerously on two legs. “So what about the rest of the house? Have you thought about how to redecorate it?”
“They know he suffered a heart attack,” Draco continued, “but not from natural causes. And he was cursed at some point, but they don’t know when or by whom.”
“Perhaps. I’d have had to offer you my services at some point, however, for saving me from the fiendfyre. And that Death Eater just afterward. So I suppose you’d have had your chance to forbid the arranged marriage after all.”
Harry stared at him for a moment longer, but then his eyes softened. “I do care what I put you through. And I am sorry. I thought . . . look, Hagrid will get to know you—how you are now, I mean.”
“Arthur wanted to take this opportunity to become better acquainted with you,” Hermione put in. “That's all."
The ferret was on board with Hermione’s idea, of course, but demanded to be seen in a posh place. Harry had objected at first, because you needed reservations in advance for a restaurant like this, even just for lunch. He knew they’d make an exception for him, but he hated taking advantage of the whole saviour thing.
So his 'dates' with Shira involved testing wildly experimental potions. That and the occasional trip to the Strand, a used muggle bookshop in Manhattan that was, surprisingly, a pleasure to browse. Sometimes it even offered something of use to a wizard.
George picked him up and then set him down on his lap. “You’d make a great therapy pet, Malfoy. Why don’t you leave Harry for me?”
It was almost impossible to imagine Draco so chummy with a muggle, but Harry kept that thought to himself. “How do Shira’s parents feel about . . . about a regular muggle businessman in the family?”
That was harder to answer. And, unfortunately, it was the crux of the whole matter. “Not in the way you’re thinking. Nothing Harry and I do together will set me off.”
Draco just stared for a moment, but finally shook himself into answering. “Yes, sort of. But Shira—look, I'm not as close to anyone as you are to Granger. And Weasley.”
“Draco is not his father, Hagrid.” Hermione attempted to keep her voice soft, devoid of any reprimand.
But Harry was having none of it. “You’ll be welcome, Draco, I promise.” He put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Hagrid’s a grown man and a teacher. He’s not going to hold a grudge about the stupid shit you did or the stupid shit you believed as a teenager.”
Harry did stay put. Sort of. He attended both MACUSA and auror meetings in the Woolworth Building for one more day, but that was his limit. He spoke with the auror commissioner personally and explained his situation.
He had worn a mask all through school, then. Draco had never really been the bully he pretended to be. It was much more likely that he'd been attempting to emulate his father.
That turned out to be the wrong thing to say. Ron’s lips twisted with a jealousy that might have faded over the years, but had yet to die.
“And neither do we. But you two really should give yourselves some breathing room before you allow the press to comment.”
Draco, however, seemed unimpressed. “Not personally. Kreacher saw to it. A couple of frum wizards went into the kitchen with those muggle blow torches—”
But Harry and Granger both looked upset, and Harry shook his head. “Stay,” he ordered. Then he turned back to Hagrid. “Draco’s here with us, Hagrid. Shouldn’t we all come inside?”
“I can see that these neo-Death Eaters intend to manipulate our currency, but I don’t think I understand their plans as well as you do. I’ve never properly studied finances, and this requires a sound knowledge of both Gringotts and muggle banking—”
"But I owed you one more for that stupid spell I cast during our, uh, duel in sixth year." Potter was bright red now. "I swear, I didn't know what it would do. I never meant—"
"You do not." Draco should know—he'd been scrupulously careful not to expose it around him. It hadn't been visible even on the night of the explosion.
Salazar, Potter looked furious. But that fury wasn't directed at him. Draco stood there stupidly, as if he were rooted to the floor. He hadn't ever expected to see Saint Potter so righteously angry on his behalf.
The wizarding world seemed painfully behind the muggles when it came to therapy; that had become obvious for everyone in the aftermath of the war. At least they were finally starting to take the muggle disciplines of psychology and psychiatry seriously.
Malfoy favoured him with a thin, sour smile. “Keep insulting me all you like about that. You’re not going to break any bones of mine.”
“I don’t have the right character to summon a patronus! And I . . . look, I have apparated before. I told you as much, remember? I just can’t anymore.”
“But he wouldn’t have done what my father did,” Draco cut in. “You’re father’s just a snob, not a supremacist.”
Fuck it. Draco wasn’t backing out now. He climbed back onto the bed, sat cross-legged once again, and looked Harry straight in the eye.
Draco felt whatever little colour he had to his face drain away. But before he could comment, Granger piped up.
Draco had the cheek to grin at that. “Oh, it’ll only be a quarter of them, I reckon. More of them are bearable than I anticipated. But really, Harry, where do you shop for your muggle outfits?”
That elicited another sigh from Draco—an exaggerated, long-suffering one. "Kreacher will take my side on this. He understands this sort of thing. He'll think I'm more perfect and noble than ever."
“Well, let’s start with bringing a house elf over without my permission or even giving me any warning—”
Hagrid’s brow furrowed. At length, his shoulders sagged and he let out a long sigh. “Suppose that’s reasonable. So to him, Buckbeak’s just a predator.”
"You don't want to talk about this just yet." Draco eyes were narrowed, but his tone was surprisingly free of judgment. Mostly.
Hailing him as a deluded menace and then as a hero: that—rinse and repeat—represented Potter’s entire relationship with the press. Well, the press was not always to be controlled; it had certainly betrayed the Malfoy family.
"Oh! Right. Shira and Jamie will be here. That's who they want with us." Harry tried to dial back his astonishment. "Do they know about Jamie? I mean your parents are—um, they won't mind being seen with a squib?"
“Don’t you dare make fun of me when I tell you why,” Harry warned. “Or tell me what an inflated ego I have.”
But then more of the memory struck him—or, rather, an emotion embedded in the memory: relief. Beyond the shame and the anger and the terror, beyond the pain and the shock, what Draco had felt more than anything was relief.
He looked astonished. Still terrified, but astonished too. But he nodded and, after a reassuring look from Harry, crossed the room.
Bill obliged, but snorted at the same time. “Poor Malfoy, is it? He had something to do with the fact that I smell of wolf, remember? And you said you had a few choice hexes in mind for him if he didn’t grovel properly—”
Anyway, she and Draco were now setting aside their differences. As the only political conservatives at the table, they had to stick together to fend off the arguments that the liberals were putting together.
“I suppose not.” Draco hesitated, but then motioned to the desks around them—or perhaps to all the people in them. “Is this your first look at a muggle office? Did your muggle family ever bring you to one?”
With that, Draco ushered Ron’s father out the door. Hermione followed him, but Ron grabbed Draco’s arm and pulled him further inside.
“Right, you just go on Draco.” Harry shook his head at his pet/sex-slave. “Remember you'll be answering to me later.”
Now those grey eyes were actually turning soft. “No. You’re right. I can block you from the memories I really want to keep private. So stay. Eavesdrop to your heart’s content.”
“Constantly worried about what other people must think of you, or how they’ll judge you if they do pick up an anything. You don’t have to live like that anymore, Draco.”
Shacklebolt. Of course. The wards here would only allow an owl from a close friend or high-ranking ministry official. “What does it say?”
Malfoy read him perfectly—and suddenly his sneer was back in full force. "Ready for some quality time with my parents, Potter?"
"Merlin, that's true." Harry pushed himself up again and twisted a bit so he could see Draco. "Why haven't we?"
“Yes. Mother prefers a house with more than one style, in fact. As long as the transitions are handled well.”
“It’s real for Harry too, you know.” Ron shook his head ruefully. “But if this is how he likes it—well, it’s no wonder things didn’t work out between him and my sister.”
Draco and Kreacher both stuck their heads out of the spare bedroom and peered down the first-floor hallway. Harry, Granger and Weasley were traipsing up the stairs.
Very well, directly against her chest. Her sigh turned into a reluctant giggle as Draco decided that female breasts could be quite comfortable.
Fuck. Did Harry have any idea what that tone and that reminder did to him? When Harry was like this—commanding and concerned at the same time—he was irresistible. Draco couldn’t help but obey to the best of his abilities.
“Yeah, Benj let me.” Harry knew he sounded overly pleased with himself, but he didn’t care. It had been cool to drive in America, on the opposite side of the road. “He was there with me. I didn’t fuck up at all, I don’t think. Not even on those narrow streets in Hoboken.”
“But,” she said, “I’ve never heard of any Death Eater—or former Death Eater—casting a patronus, have you?”
A murderer, Harry wanted to say. That’s what Lucius was, whether or not he ever got his own hands dirty. No point in saying that out loud, though.
The name Benjamin sounded familiar, but Harry latched onto the business name instead. “Cantor Fitzgerald? That’s a muggle company?”
“Draco, are you still afraid this won’t work?” He kept his voice soft. If this was another example of Malfoy’s insecurities driving him, it was best to reassure him.
“Well, I’ve no desire to make a career out of repairing near-hopeless magical items.” He paused and shifted again, pulling Harry a bit closer this time. “I’m not sure I want to be a homemaker, though. It’s a possibility, but there’s something else I’d like to explore first.”
Harry found himself grinning. Draco wasn’t too protective of these memories, because without any serious effort Harry could all but live them. It was as if he were at the table with Draco and a host of people Harry didn’t recognise. One argument seemed to concern U.S. presidential primaries. That must have been sometime before the 2000 election, then. Even Harry, who purposely and resolutely remained ignorant of both magical and muggle politics, knew that George W. Bush was now president of the United States.
"Good. You can start by telling us just what you ferreted out of that hidey-hole before we escaped the explosion."
“No, Mrs. Malfoy. I’m just Harry.” Shit, why was he being so formal? She felt free enough to call him by his given name. And he didn’t owe the Malfoys, of all people, respect.
Draco rolled his eyes. "This, Harry,"—he made a motion with his hands, but it was obvious he meant the life debt—"isn't just for show."
That was news to Draco. He finally looked up. “You had a house elf tailing me? And you still didn’t figure out what I was up to?”
But Shira was frowning. “It’s hard to imagine Uncle Lucius and Aunt Narcissa falling for Voldemort.”
"Casting you in the light of the oppressor? That should be fun." There was a sudden gleam in Draco's eyes. "Maybe I should call Skeeter—just think of the stories I could make up about you this time."
She smiled, but then both their eyes darted to the window, where a horned owl was clawing at the glass. “Isn’t that one of Shacklebolt’s?”
"Of course. I—” he broke off awkwardly, remembering that Draco didn't want him professing his love yet. "Goodnight."
“Harry . . . Harry, you can't be serious.” That was Granger. Draco wasn't facing her, but he reckoned she was wide-eyed and outraged now. “You didn't transfigure him!”
Harry let out a sigh that still sounded annoyed. But he also reached across the table to place his hands over Draco’s. “Look, I know you were brought up to think—”
Harry shrugged as he collapsed into a chair. “It’s fine, I suppose. Not sure why everyone needs to know our business—”
Shit, Harry wished he'd known how insecure Draco was then. A lot of his bullying, cruelty and general brattiness must have stemmed from that. If Harry had known, maybe things could have been different between them at Hogwarts.
Still, Ron would hear it too. If she asked his opinion, he wasn’t going to lie: Harry had every right to control Malfoy’s life, both because of the life debt and because it was what Malfoy wanted. If he didn’t want it, he could walk away.
“I’m aware. But it's not so simple. And the reason behind it will upset Harry. I don’t want him haunted by this part of my past. I don’t want it in his head whenever we—”
She let out an exaggerated sigh. “It means I can’t have a BLT here. A bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwich, I mean.”
Kreacher looked as if he were about to burst with pride from Draco's selflessness. "Master Draco is an honourable wizard who repays his debts! Only the most noble of pure-bloods understand—"
Ron wasn’t sure what to do with that confession. “Huh. I can’t picture you as part of a large clan. And I’ve heard of the Baumgartens—aren’t they a Jewish family?”
“Yes. I don’t despise Robards’ methods as much as you do; some of his ruthlessness is necessary. But only some. Overall, your ethics will be preferable. Besides, you would be out of the line of fire.”
Hermione, who had been suspiciously quiet until that moment, gasped out loud. "Harry, no! You two are talking about . . . ." She stopped and shook her head. "This life debt sounds as bad as what the wizarding world does to house elves."
“Treat you as if you really are the second coming?" Draco grinned. “All right, I understand why you want to keep this quiet. We don’t need anyone seriously worshipping you or seriously attempting to lick your trainers. Again, not more than they already do.”
When Harry opened his eyes again, Malfoy was still pressed alongside him. There was a pillow under Harry's head, though, and a blanket draped over them both.
“I thought he’d make it through three or four. But I was lucky. He didn’t find me very interesting, so he rarely bothered with me. Or rather, he did, but not as far as legilimency went."
“Harry, then,” she continued smoothly. “That bubble is not our reality. Muggle politics affect all of us.”
Harry shook his head. Everything Draco was telling him made sense, but to curate your memories and thoughts and feelings to that extent . . . that had to be hellish. And it was so cold. How was it possible to be cold enough to sort through your memories—memories tied to the best and worst of you—and choose which to put on display in order to mislead people?
George, who had finally eschewed the floor in favour of a proper chair, shot Draco a mischievous glance. "Harry, you ought to tell Shacklebolt that you can't find a reliable pet sitter."
Was he joking? "Have you looked at me? Or in a mirror? We each need a shower and change of clothes. And though I doubt you have anything I would deign to wear—"
“But you don’t see him finding happiness with a former Death Eater?” Draco didn’t bother to hide the bite in his tone.
“Yeah, the grand prick himself.” Ron shook his head. “He went on and on about how a Death Eater like Draco Malfoy should never cross the threshold of the Burrow, that he’s directly responsible for what happened to Bill—which, all right, is true—that he as good as killed Dumbledore—”
Fuck. Draco didn't know whether to laugh or to pull his hair out. "Ah, this has been a lovely dinner, but perhaps we should put off the rest of our discussion until morning."
"I know what you mean." He kept up the massage, working his way toward Harry's lower back. "You're worried about the fallout if Skeeter publishes the truth. And what will happen if the public discovers just how you came to pull my arse out of the fire again."
He knew what Draco looked like when he was genuinely amused—when there was no cruelty mixed in with his laughter. He knew what Draco looked like when he was . . . aroused. And when he was satiated afterward.
“Yes. No.” Harry sighed again, this time in frustration. But he didn’t move his hands away. “He was my friend, Draco. And there’s so much I don’t know about him. And the things he said about how he was treated as a house elf at Malfoy Manor . . . the things he said about—”
So where did that leave him with his father? The man would try to take advantage of Draco's relationship with Harry; he wasn't even hiding his intentions as far as that went. But even if Harry allowed that, Lucius Malfoy could not possibly be proud of the son who was now in service to their former enemy.
There was a smile in Draco's voice as he replied. “Not a morning person, I take it. Never mind; I'll give you to half-seven or so. I'll leave your clothes laid out over here—”
“You hated sixth year.” Harry hesitated and then gentled his voice. “That was—I mean, you were undercover then, in a way. And you hated it. Merlin, you were breaking down.”
“How did you survive undercover for so long?” Ron rolled his eyes. “Hogwarts is safe enough, especially since no one expected us. But we’re out in the open.”
He just stared down at Draco, remembering that all faces repeated in nature, that if there were really a Creator, that Being had only made so many, and so somewhere out there was another man who was as pointy and angular as Draco—and just as hot. But that person would never do that thing with his eyebrows or laugh the same way or master the Malfoy sneer. And he would never belong to Harry the way Draco did.
"But no one would care, would they?" Hermione asked. "I mean, no one will listen to Draco or lift a finger for his father."
Fortunately, there were some supportive letters as well. Many of them dismissed the whole story, arguing that an agreement between two consenting adults wasn't newsworthy or anyone else's concern.
Did his father have any contacts left at the Ministry? The man was no longer an influencer, but perhaps he'd heard something . . . .
“Dunno. You should ask him.” Harry paused, looking both earnest and hopeful. “You, ah, seem to be getting on well enough. I mean, dinner with Ron and Hermione wasn’t torture for you, was it?”
“Well enough, when last we spoke. That was before I, er, entered your service. I’ll reach out to him again, if you don’t object.”
“Mostly I think about ways to reform the aurors. I didn’t understand how things worked when I joined. I didn’t know that we use some, er, underhanded methods to make our arrests and keep order.”
Kreacher bowed and then disapparated with a little pop. The tea mysteriously disappeared at the same time.
“That’s true. Fuck it. I probably won’t break up with you—even if they do offer me a chance to be their third.”
“I, uh, can’t apparate any longer," Draco managed. "And I think there’s a connection between that fact and those transactions. In my head, I mean. In fact, I know there is.”
And then they both stopped short at the sight of Harry sitting on the floor, holding a ferret, and looking like—well, like both him and the animal had survived an explosion.
“Anyway,” Shira continued, ignoring the controversy she had just kicked up, “I almost wish we had just made a baby while he was here, without bothering with marriage. But both our families would have lost their minds.”
“No.” Draco shook his head. “Weasley respects the life-debt between us. Granger doesn’t, so I can’t go to her with this.”
Her face reddened. For a moment, at least, she looked honestly chagrined. “You’re right; you have made that clear. I’m not sure that Draco fully believes it, but—Harry, he is happy with you. That’s obvious. Or at least as happy as he knows how to be.”
Narcissa raised her other hand to prevent her husband from speaking. “Harry, an arranged marriage needn’t come between you two.”
Harry studied his boyfriend. Spending his birthday at a muggle pub surrounded by Weasleys was possibly not a dream come true for him.
“Doesn’t matter, I suppose.” Draco shook his head and then, after a ragged breath, took a seat on the bed. “All those classrooms you saw—Harry, I told you. I keep them locked for a reason.”
Oh no. Suddenly Ron understood. He glanced at Hermione, hoping she had some clever response, but she had turned white.
Draco shrugged. “To the best of my knowledge, he only made it through two layers of my protection. He didn’t think I was capable of hiding anything deeper than that.”
Harry smiled a little. “I know I haven't met them properly, but Shira and Jamie seem like the right sort.”
“Never mind.” His dad looked at them both in turn and then sighed. Then he nodded toward an armchair in the corner of the room. “May I?”
Honestly, it would be a miracle if the press didn’t claim that they were shagging each other raw every night. They kept looking at each other with a half challenging and half adoring gleam in their eyes. But Ron kept that thought to himself.
“Then you might as well have a proper harness, in case we go out, and a proper muzzle to keep you from nipping.”
Harry sighed. "So I understand where muggle finances come into the estate now. Half the Malfoy fortune, at least, is in pound sterling—not the vaults of Gringotts."
"Oh God!" Shira sank into the armchair by the fireplace, somehow managing a dramatic pose that didn't look staged.
No, that wasn't fair. They wouldn't be upset about him being bisexual. Surprised, maybe, but not upset. But he would have to tell them that he and Malfoy were together. He would keep that secret from the press, but not from his closest friends.
Draco shifted a bit and placed his hands, now nicely warmed, on the middle of Harry's back. "How's that?"
“Interesting.” Draco looked intrigued. “I can’t promise that, of course, but you’re within your rights to punish me appropriately if I do.”
“All right, all right!” He was still smirking, though. “Your wand responded to me too. Not the way my own did, but . . . more than just functional?”
They had been obsessed with each other during their years at Hogwarts, getting under each other's skin in all the wrong ways. God, how Harry had hated him. But only until sixth year. Granted, he still despised him after that. Sometimes. Mostly he pitied him.
Draco did that thing with his eyebrows. “Your skill in legilimency leaves much to be desired. You know that, don’t you?”
An awkward silence followed. Draco finally broke it. “Now what? Are you ready to go on? Do you still want to?”
Draco’s whole life was the wizarding world. Yeah, his parents taught him something of muggle politics and finances, because they considered such knowledge necessary to their own well-being. But, for all that, Draco was brought up with a severely limited world-view.
“Of course I do. A moronic saviour, obviously, but still both my personal saviour and the saviour of our British wizarding community.”
It always took Draco a few seconds to adjust to his ferret senses—everything looked, smelled, and sounded different. His eyesight was shit, really, in this form. But he could hear and smell so much more.
"Oh. Right. Of course. I'd like to come too, if that's all right. Unless you want quality time alone with them." It was fine either way, really. He could survive another dinner at Malfoy Manor, but he didn't mind if Draco wanted his parents to himself.
Harry closed his eyes. He didn't have another apparation in him tonight. He still couldn't even be arsed to try for some basic healing. So he let himself drift off, hoping for the best.
Draco looked amused. "Even my father taught me that muggles have their uses, Granger. And the sense to get their currency off the gold standard."
“Harry boycotting the Burrow isn’t going to help us!” Draco folded his arms over his chest. “Your parents will blame me for any estrangement.”
How did he even know this stuff? Did all pure-blood parents teach their children about interior decorating? Did it come right after teaching them the alphabet?
“I’m Shira Baumgarten.” She held out her hand. “New York Baumgartens. My girlfriend and I are staying with Harry.”
“What, Hermione?” George rolled his eyes. “He is Harry's pet. His sex slave too, I gather. But it's all consensual, yeah?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I agreed to allow you to teach me. It’s not my fault you’ve been procrastinating.”
Harry would probably be doing a lot of that in the years to come—Draco was a bit high strung. And a bit high maintenance. And completely worth it, so Harry started dialing.
Harry wanted to retch at that. “No! I mean, yes. He's here and I brought him, but—this isn't what it looks like.”
Harry should have realised, though. If he were a better boyfriend, he would have done. So much was happening at home: Harry’s job taking him all the way to the States, Draco’s private chat with Arthur Weasley, Shira and Jamie arriving, Ron and Hermione staying on at Grimmauld Place . . . which of those had set Draco off?
She believed, at heart, that Draco had always secretly respected and admired Harry. Those emotions had been poorly mixed with jealousy, fear, and resentment, but they had still been visible whenever he tried to put himself at the centre of Harry's attention. (Usually with resounding success.)
“Yes. The chuppah, the breaking of a glass, people lifting us up on chairs at the reception—all of it.”
"That was the first time he pulled me out of a fire, Mother," Draco cut in. He didn't like to interrupt her, but this couldn't wait. "Yesterday night was the second."
Right. These were Draco’s private memories. He wasn’t willing to share here, except for the ones connected to Dobby.
Harry’s expression turned serious as he narrowed his eyes. “Really. We’re not playing here, remember? I own your arse, so you’ll do exactly as I say.”
“Yeah.” Harry strained to keep his voice even. “Otherwise I would.” He braced himself for an explosion of anger from Draco, but it never came.
The ferret paid him no mind, keeping his attention on George, who returned the favour. And then . . . then it was ludicrously difficult to describe what happened next. It all happened faster than even Bill, with his heightened wolf senses, could keep up with.
“God, no. The Dursleys only went to services on Christmas and Easter. I don’t know about my parents, though . . . huh.”
Perhaps. Harry stopped looking him in the eye as he continued his story. They were still sitting in the sanctuary of the synagogue, on steps that led up to a raised platform. Since they were side-by-side, Harry could look down the aisle, or even at the floor, without appearing rude or frightened.
"Shit timing on the Ministry’s part." He paused to stroke the head of Shacklebolt’s great-horned owl. "I'll be stuck there for a week. Draco, is there any chance you can come with me?”
“I dunno if—Harry, I need time to think this through. And I don’t even know if you’re religious. Did those muggles bring you up to be a proper Anglican? Or a proper anything else?”
“I’m sorry, Draco.” Harry was on his feet now. “I shouldn’t have . . . I shouldn’t have been prying. I was wrong, but—”
Apparently Harry could cast Lumos silently and without a wand. Of course he could; why was Draco so surprised? The man was undoubtedly the most powerful wizard alive at the moment, however raw and undisciplined his magic.
“Brought?” His dad’s face was a mixture of shock at the scene before him—Merlin, he didn’t think he’d stumbled into a ménage à trois, did he?—and bewilderment at the question. “This, er, young elf answered your door. Harry's door, I mean."
Weasley’s pale skin was turning a violent shade of red. His freckles almost blended with his flush. “But he’s responsible for you, yeah? So he has a right to know that there’s some sort of trauma preventing you from apparating.”
Draco stared. “Not a good idea. If you're determined to go through with this, at least let me come—”
Harry smiled at that, but only for a second. "I'm not sure I can keep your father out of Azkaban. I can expose the deal Robards forced you into. Or threaten to—"
Harry seemed to deflate. “I know I'm asking a lot. I don't expect you two to become friends, but . . . he has changed, Ron. He doesn't believe in the pure-blood propaganda anymore. And he was never a killer. You know that.”
“Stop being modest.” He knew he was still sneering, but he couldn’t help himself. He had made his peace with Potter’s superiority, but that didn’t mean he enjoyed having it rubbed in. “According to the official histories of the war, you’re a brilliant teacher. Single-handedly teaching Dumbledore’s Army Defense Against the Dark Arts when you were just a fifth year—”
"Benj will be driving, not me. He really does seem decent, Draco. I think I'm going to like the whole family."
“But maybe he's shagging you just to make himself look good. You know, maybe it will help his public image to be dating the chosen one.”
Harry put his hands on Draco’s shoulders. He knew he couldn’t ask what sort of advice—that would be overstepping again. “Why Ron? I thought you’d be much more likely to ask Hermione.”
"What? No, it's not that!" Fuck. He managed to offend people even when he didn't mean to. Well, actions would speak louder than words in this case, so he reached for her hand.
Benj shrugged. “No offense, but your society isn’t the only one in existence. It’s a real small one, in fact. There’s a much bigger world out there. So if you can’t find a way to help the one you fucked up in, find a way to help the one right in front of you.”
Potter had, somewhat inexplicably, helped the Malfoys after the war. There was no reason he should help them again, but . . . well, Potter had come charging to the rescue, hadn't he? Perhaps he'd offer even more assistance. Draco would be a fool not to find out.
“Is this your impression of an octopus?” he finally asked. “You’re not about to confess to some tentacle kink, are you?”
Of course it wasn't. Draco had already known that, but better to be sure. He was still working out just how to, well, fit with Weasley and Granger.
Harry could feel Draco’s gut clenching with a mixture of shame and self-revulsion, but he followed Benjamin to a quieter spot regardless.
“Right. But, er, even a person who doesn’t mind compartmentalising still has to learn to do it effectively. And that’s where meditation comes in, yeah? A disciplined mind is essential. In fact, my Aunt Bella said—”
Fuck. Draco hated to lose. It was arguably even worse to keep losing to Ronald Weasley—some part of Draco wondered, ironically, what his father would have to say about that. But even Lucius Malfoy couldn’t deny the man’s reputation as a brilliant player.
“What if I can’t move forward?” Draco’s stomach was still clenched. “I can’t—I don’t know how to make amends in my . . . society. And I’d only make things worse if I tried.”
Harry had to bite back a grin. Kreacher, as far as he knew, had only been in Ron and Hermione’s flat once. He’d been horrified at the mess—and considering that he liked to sleep in a nest of old rags, that was saying something.
An awkward silence passed. Neither of them spoke; both just listened to the cordial mayhem of the office workers.
Kreacher was on hand to give them each a bag with an onion bagel packed inside, prepared to taste. Apparently Granger preferred a prim amount of butter, Weasley liked his over-stuffed with traditional ‘lox and schmear,’ whilst Harry took egg and cheese.
Draco snorted. "You're so sure you're going to forbid the arranged marriage for me? What if you're over me by then?"
He had switched to a different opening for that second game, one he’d been fairly certain would hold up against most of Weasley's defenses. Then he forced Weasley to trade queens a bit later. It was an even exchange in theory, but in practise Ron was still deadlier with the piece than Draco was, so the trade was really to Draco’s advantage.
Besides, Draco deserved their protection. But she wished more fervently now that Hagrid had just allowed him to remain with them.
Somehow Draco found his voice. “Weasley’s right.” He looked straight at Harry. “I think just the three of you should go. Give Hagrid a chance to get used to this idea without me there, yeah?”
“I know exactly what you are, Draco.” He tightened his grip. “And I still have your wand, you know.”
Malfoy actually smiled. It was a genuine smile this time; nothing thin or sour about it. “My family is prejudiced against muggles and muggle-borns, Weasley—viciously so. But we’ve never been racists or antisemites. Don’t pin even more sins on us.”
"It's all part of the life debt I owe our master, Kreacher." Draco was obviously enjoying this. "And I'm not signing my fortune over to him, I'm merely adding him to my accounts. He can draw on them when or if he pleases. Or order me to support some worthy cause, if he must."
This is not how he expected the day to end: lying here on the floor at Grimmauld Place—covered in dust, soot and probably some dried blood—with Draco Malfoy, of all people, sprawled on top of him.
He looked grateful for the change of subject. Hermione had to suppress a sudden and ludicrous urge to giggle. That would be beneath her, but gratitude seemed so alien to him. He really must have changed.
"It's no use, Shira," Draco said at one point. "You can't blame everything on religion. I know that first hand."
“I think I understand why Mr. Baumgarten didn’t disown Noa.” Draco rested his chin on top of Harry’s head. “He’s a decent man, despite any prejudice against mixed marriages.”
“But I thought you didn’t care if anyone penetrated these memories. You’re purposely keeping them on the surface, yeah?”
“Well, yeah. So do I, Ferret, for your own safety. You’re going to have a target on your back for a long time.”
He frowned at the shop. His brother wanted him to quit the aurors and come work with him instead. Ron thought about Robards, and how he both admired the man and despised him. For the first time, he was tempted by George’s offer.
Ron hadn’t kicked him out of their bedroom last night, then. Harry felt weirdly happy about that. It was sort of cute, picturing Draco-in-ferret-form curled up with his two best friends.
The Prophet had carried the story about the rescue. The Auror Department—advised by PR types, probably—had led the public to believe that Harry had been acting under orders when he rescued Malfoy. Robards couldn’t admit that he’d left an agent to die, or that Harry had risked his life to save said agent without permission. Hell, Harry shouldn’t have known who the agent was or where he was being held.
The boy’s shoulders stiffened as he glared up at her husband. “Technically, only since this morning. But we’ve known each other for years.”
“Not an option,” Harry agreed. “Anyway, the mark has no more power. Voldemort is gone, even if he managed to leave his marks behind.”
“Yeah. He’s alive and well at Malfoy Manor. I’m still quite fond of him, despite . . . well, you know.”
This was a terrible idea, but somehow Draco managed a nod. “That’s fine. You, ah, you should tell whoever you’d like, Harry. And if it gets out—well, it gets out. My parents will survive.”
There was a flicker of surprise in his Dad’s eyes. And a flicker of hurt. “Well, I hope Harry will be patient. This is a new relationship for him—very new.”
“You what!” Draco’s eyes were wide and horrified, as if a dementor had suddenly descended on the room.
He felt himself inhale sharply. “Does that mean you think I owe him this? If he asks what a particular nightmare is about, I’m obliged to tell him?”
Harry fell quiet for a moment. “Would you like to be a house husband? Or, er, homemaker, if that’s the proper term?”
Draco glared at him again, probably just for good measure, and then turned back to the house elves. “Kreacher, you seem to know something about kashering. I rely on you to find out what needs to be done and who should do it.”
“Harry!” A feminine voice with an unmistakable American accent cut Hagrid off mid-sentence. “So glad you’re here.”
“No.” His expression was uncompromising. “Not if it involves a crime. But you haven’t raped or murdered anyone, have you?”
“Because he liked having it, and it wasn’t as harmful to me as he imagined.” His smile grew almost proud. “That’s a critical part of occlumency, Potter. Give the person penetrating your brain a secret that’s not nearly as important as he thinks it is.”
“Look, I’m fine with the idea of you having a boyfriend, okay? I don’t care that you’re bent. Or a little bent. Or . . . I mean, not that you need my approval—”
“I should look into it, I suppose.” Harry was furrowing his brow now. “Not that it matters; I might somewhat believe in—um, well something. But I’m not attached to any particular religion, so I’ll go along with whatever you want.”
Hermione seemed to seriously consider that question, as if Harry’s faults were so obvious that she couldn’t be expected to listen to the specific circumstance. But, after a moment, she nodded and sat up straight, giving Harry an expectant look.
"Leave it be, Potter. You're two up. Three, if you count the fact that your testimony kept my mother out of Azkaban too."
“Harry, whatever you’re thinking, stop.” Draco tugged him closer, encircling him in his arms. “You’re only duty tonight is to show me just how good you are at make-up sex.”
Hermione favoured Draco with a sidelong glance that promised more questions to come and then turned back to Ron’s Dad.
Harry turned around slowly, and found his boyfriend leaning against the edge of one of the desks. A large desk for multiple people. A woman was sitting right next to him, in fact. She was staring at her computer screen, making a face at data of some sort, but she paid him no mind.
Harry blinked, remembering that the Dark Lord had forced Draco to torture people here. "Right. Was Voldemort ever here in this room?” For some reason Harry’s stomach clenched at the thought.
“Dunno. I’ve thought about teaching. I think that’s something I’m good at, judging by my time running Dumbledore’s Army. But . . . .” He let his voice trail off.
"And I see it whenever you do your animagus bit—whenever you transform," Harry continued. "I noticed because your left, um, foreleg is the only part of your fur that's not pure Malfoy blond."
But as long as they were getting on, Harry wasn’t about to complain. And since the sudden tension seemed to be draining from the room, he felt confident enough to continue.
"Ten points for Gryffindor, Granger." Draco's eyes were still intent on Harry. "See, Potter? I need you to do this. The ministry will listen to you."
Draco didn’t say anything to that. He looked frustrated now, as if there were no way he could get Harry to understand.
But Draco would have to learn how to cast the patronus charm. And re-learn how to apparate. Those spells could help any wizard out of a tight spot—and Draco was especially vulnerable. There were people who wouldn’t accept that the war was over, who still wanted revenge against anyone who had sided with Voldemort. And now there were neo-Death Eaters who knew that Draco had spied on them on behalf of the ministry.
“Of course he did. They’re genuinely sweet, and they didn’t mention the BDSM thing. And he didn’t notice anything peculiar about their clothes. Well, he wouldn’t, would he? Half of the wizarding world still dress like Victorians . . . .”
Harry hesitated. “How do I know if it’s my calling? How do I know I shouldn’t be doing something else?”
"Right." Suddenly Potter's defiance evaporated, and he was actually blushing again. "I'll, uh, just follow you, then.”
Harry, meanwhile, had figured out what the fuss was about. “Over-reaction, Malfoy.” He grinned despite the bit of blood seeping through his tee-shirt.
“The wand didn't feel right to you anymore. Not then.” Harry's voice was thoughtful now. “It was mine by right of conquest. That's how Olivander explained it.”
“It can’t be impossible for Draco to cast a patronus.” Harry pulled his knees in toward his chest. “Umbridge has one, and she’s a much more miserable human being than he is.”
“And you’re still stupidly easy to rile up,” Draco retorted. But he was smiling too now, and he kept smiling as he walked up to Harry and gave him another light kiss. “Resign yourself to Toffee, please. You’re a bleeding heart when it comes to house elves, aren’t you?”
Harry couldn’t answer that, other than to say that it took a great deal of focus and lots of meditating. “And, anyway,” he added, “don’t you think it’s unhealthy?”
It was, at least, much better than sleeping with Crookshanks on the bed. Draco burrowed and squirmed a bit, but he didn’t drape himself on anyone’s face.
“Yeah. As  it turns out, it sucks to be a pure-blood when you’re a squib,” Jamie explained. “No one’s begging to arrange a marriage with me.”
Narcissa took a seat next to Potter and tentatively placed a hand on his arm. “Harry, when Lucius and I contacted the Prophet, we had thought it better to beg your forgiveness than ask your permission. We didn’t think you’d understand our reasoning.”
“They weren’t,” Draco insisted. “They were well-reasoned arguments on religion, politics and all other verboten topics.”
“Master Draco is . . . resting with Master Ron and Mistress Hermione.” Kreacher put a hand on his heart.
“Yeah. But I told him that he could forget about the life debt. That I'd still help him and his family. He didn't want to forget it.”
“Yes, but don’t let it go to your head.” He paused, furrowing his brow. “I don’t mean it in a religious sense.”
Draco and Harry both sat up. There was, Harry noticed, a deliciously outraged expression on Draco's face.
“No.” Harry could feel a scowl creep onto his face. “I think they cut ties with him, after his arrest. None of them tried to secure a visitor’s pass to Azkaban, even though we were allowing them at that point, and none of them turned up at his trial to support him. So I hope he wants nothing to do with them.”
Draco took a deep breath. “Harry, I was already tentatively attached to the neo-Death Eaters by the time I went to New York. As far as my parents knew, I was there to get to know Shira. I, er, led others to believe that I wanted to get away after the war.”
“Well, I’m not.” Harry couldn’t explain why he felt defensive of all a sudden; he was doing the right thing. “They might as well know. And Shira might as well too, so let’s call her.”
"Maybe." Harry sighed. He could see what Draco was getting at, but he already knew Draco's faults and weaknesses. He already knew Draco. They hadn't been rivals and enemies all those years for nothing.
Draco leaned down and grasped Harry's shoulders. "Or what?" he whispered. "Want to give me a real spanking?"
In a good way. Yes, it was a fucking miracle that Draco had changed his opinion of muggles so much, and it was definitely a good thing.
“I’ll never stop being jealous of you.” Draco was still annoyed, and still sneering, but he grabbed Harry’s hand and kissed it. “And I’ll never learn those spells, you prick.”
But he had been one. A much more committed Death Eater than Draco had ever been. So if Snape could cast a patronus, there was no reason Draco couldn't.
Harry nodded. “Thanks to the flash drive Draco retrieved, yes. And we can link some members to the explosion. But now that Draco’s service is public knowledge, he’s a target for the remaining members at large, and for every other Death Eater wannabe.”
“Er, yes. But that’s expected in American synagogues. I might have gotten carried away once or twice—especially as one of the very few political conservatives in this shul—but it’s all part of the culture, I assure you.”
He rolled his eyes. “Believe me, I want to. I don't like having his mark on me either. I thought it would fade after his death, but apparently nothing short of amputation will remove it.”
“Yes, a sitting room really isn’t the place for this.” Hermione pulled out her wand and furrowed her brow. “Those I suppose we could transfigure the hard edges of that table, for a start.”
Ron sighed, deciding to delay this particular battle. “There’s a bit more to the story than that, but it’ll keep till morning.”
“For peace in the home?” Harry nestled closer. The office continued to bustle around them, taking no notice. “So that’s the password? Much better than your last one.”
And it took six months to become an animagus, didn't it? And you didn’t learn what animal you would become until after your first transformation. Although, if Draco knew what his patronus was, he might have known in advance. Harry remembered hearing that it was almost always the same.
It was a bizarre situation, really. Bill's scars always drew looks from strangers, and some knew that a werewolf had caused them, but people weren't generally terrified of him.
“I disagree. He had the perfect revenge in his hands three years ago: he could have ensured that all three of us rotted in Azkaban.”
"Tell me something." Draco carded his fingers through Potter's hair. "Are you new to this because I'm another man, or are you just new to this?"
After a moment more of sniffing, Draco obliged him. He tumbled away from both of them, still in ferret-form, and emerged as a human sitting cross-legged at the bottom of the bed. A human in quite posh pajamas, if he did say so himself.
Fuck, Draco was enjoying Ron's outrage. Harry could tell by the growing sneer on his face. So Harry kicked his foot, silently warning him not to bait Ron.
Draco looked back up at Harry and gave him that tight smile again. It was a gentle smile this time, though, with just a hint of his customary sneer. “I think I’ll remain in your service for the rest of our lives. And I think you’ll always enjoy that. And you might even continue to enjoy my company, for the most part.”
Maybe it wasn't so astonishing, though. Draco was twenty now, not a spoiled prick of a fourth year. And he had survived both Voldemort and the war. Of course he'd grown up.
“I’ll walk him to the castle,” Weasley said again. He tightened his grip on Draco’s arm and turned them both toward Hogwarts proper.
"I don't trust his judgment. Besides . . ." He paused to shrug. "I know what my father is, all right? And I know I'm like him, but—"
McGonagall, to Draco’s surprise, had greeted him evenly enough. There had been no particular warmth in her eyes, but no contempt or scorn either. And she refused to let him make an appointment; he and Weasley, she said, ought to step into her office now.
Harry shrugged. “He said he couldn't go to you about this. You don't respect the idea in the first place.”
“Pardon, but Master Draco says if Master won’t get up for the sake of his job, then Master must be reminded that Mr. and Mrs. Ron Weasley are to be arriving.”
“When? We haven’t seen each other for three years. And you’ve only just discovered that you’re a little bent.”
“I didn’t think it was.” Draco hesitated, trying to find the right words. “Dunno, really. I suppose I qualify as an agnostic.”
Hermione considered the lot of them. “Yes, I suppose it did. They’ve been talking for hours, haven’t they?” She hesitated, frowning. “Harry, have you seen any of Draco’s friends? From back at Hogwarts, I mean, not his new ones from New York.”
Harry nodded, trying to convey a bit of gratitude, and looked around. This room, stone floor and all, appeared to be an old-fashioned kitchen, with pots and kettles and such hanging directly over the massive fireplace. It was rather like the kitchen in Hogwarts, only much smaller. But it was . . . tense, somehow. Like the room itself was waiting for something to happen.
“Draco?” Weasley let out a startled and delighted laugh. “You actually named him after Malfoy? That's just cruel, mate.”
Draco rolled over to face him. “No?” He traced the outline of Harry’s face with one finger. “I think you’ve got a thing for power imbalances.”
Draco leaned back against the door with a nonchalant shrug, as if he had chosen to be pinned there. “I told you to go back to sleep.”
“Her father’s not overjoyed. But, honestly, Noa—that’s Shira’s sister—is exceptionally strong-willed. She’d have married Benjamin even if her family disowned her for it.” Draco paused to give Harry an ironic grin. “But at least he’s Jewish.”
But she didn’t remember moving and didn’t quite understand how she ended up where she was, in danger of being cursed by either or both men as they aimed for each other.
"Yes, I know and no, you didn't." He swallowed again. "The dittany made the difference. Snape administered it on time."
Draco wished he could roll his eyes. Trust Potter to be a sap and have no shame about it. But that was rather endearing.
“Because I knew I’d probably be sacked for this! And I thought it'd be a simple extraction.” Potter kept stroking Draco as he talked. “They had figured out that Malfoy was a spy. He was magically restrained when I found him—but I swear, Ron, that was the only impressive magic they used. Their wards were shoddy, their . . . well, it doesn't matter now.”
“Here,” Draco was saying. “The fourth floor will do for Shira and Jamie. There’s a large bathroom they can have all to themselves, plus we can convert one of the bedrooms into a sitting room. Toffee, let’s give it a bohemian feel. We’ll see what Parisian artifacts we can commandeer from my parents’ attic.”
“Yes, once. He had a right to be angry, mind, but not to make me bleed.” He shook his head ruefully. “I'm going to have to keep his ferret form muzzled around anyone else he might be upset with.”
His father actually fidgeted a bit at that. “I agree. But he’s still the son of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black. He was still raised a certain way—”
“Of course we did,” Lucius snapped. “It would have come out regardless and someone has to control the narrative—will you kindly sit down?”
“I didn’t name him after Malfoy. This is Malfoy.” Potter placed Draco back on his lap as he released his scruff.
Draco glared down at him. “Thank you for assuming you understand what’s going on in my head better than I do.”
Harry paused to consider that. “Actually, it is, isn’t it? Either way, I mean. But nothing went wrong. I didn’t run anyone over or cause an accident. And I’ll be extra careful driving in Manhattan.”
He reached out to smooth the collar of Harry’s shirt, those grey eyes of his soft. “It means I’d rather have my lord and master safe at home than off risking his neck on some idiot mission.”
Harry laughed at the snark in Draco's tone—and at the satisfied smirk in his voice. "Yes. As long as Hermione doesn't think I'm too tyrannical."
Harry almost smiled at that; Draco could see it in his eyes. But then his face grew serious. "We can't shag—or, um, dry hump?—or anything else until this is sorted. So maybe we shouldn't wait until September."
No, this wasn't an act. The satisfaction Draco took in subservience might not be healthy—Hermione found it difficult to remain open-minded on that point—but it certainly seemed genuine.
“Perhaps,” Hermione acknowledged, “but that sort of twisted idolatry was hardly compatible with any of the world’s religions. Whatever their faults," she rushed to add, forestalling another rant. "And Draco's right: humans don’t need religion to be brutal to one another.”
In truth, he was terrified. He didn’t know which would be worse: Draco telling him that what happened with Dumbledore at King’s Cross had simply been some sort of near-death experience, or Draco suddenly looking at him as if he were, well, some sort of holy walking miracle.
Narcissa looked at him thoughtfully. “It would mean there would be no formally recognised Malfoy heir. But Potter is correct; it needn’t mean the end of the Malfoy bloodline. A surrogate, with Draco as the biological father—”
"I tried to tell him Draco should have extra protection, but the car is first-class as far as that goes, and Draco does have a proper wand again. And my father is competent—"
Thunderstruck—that’s how Hagrid looked at the moment. Until his expression cleared, and suddenly it seemed as if pieces of an irksome jigsaw puzzle had just clicked into place for him.
"No." He looked as if he were trying for a smile—and failing spectacularly. "No, they only want you."
Hagrid stumbled over a greeting and gingerly took her tiny hand in his before almost instantly releasing it.
For a moment, Draco clung to a forlorn hope that Harry would make some kind of excuse. But the idiot was grinning in anticipation.
Potter jumped in. "I don't think Draco's told you what crucial work he's been doing on behalf of the ministry and the aurors—"
“Look, Ron—” He broke off and took a deep breath, as if he were about to face a dementor’s kiss instead of his best mate. “Even if Draco and I weren't together, he'd be around, you know?”
“Next week!” Shira looked outraged. “I have potions that are in the middle of a month long brewing cycle—”
“They must have done, don’t you think? Sirius Black was your godfather. You generally acquire godparents at your christening. Unless they did something more informal.”
He could feel Harry’s eyes on him from his seat across the table. Not boring into him, exactly, but watching him expectantly. And a bit impatiently.
Ron grunted. "I think I cursed him in advance for getting us all killed. Which, you know, didn't happen. So Harry was right: there was enough time to go back for you."
"Yes!" Draco turned back to his mother. "Once by keeping me out of Azkaban; I'd have killed myself in there—"
“Which he might do, for a while. But only for a while.” Weasley favoured him with a grim smile. “He told me once, back when you were awaiting trial in Azkaban, that, in a way, he admired you for everything you were willing to do for the sake of your family.”
Hermione, meanwhile, was sinking into the ugly chesterfield with a crease in her brow, as if she were thinking about something else altogether. "This entire consult business is odd,” she said, proving that her mind was back on Shacklebolt’s note. “I suppose our Ministry wants you out of the country whilst the scandal plays out. It looks as though Robards will be forced to resign."
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but abruptly closed it again. In the end, he simply nodded as he took Harry's hand and shook it.
"—and the final time was last night," Draco finished, ignoring him. "He's made quite the habit of rescuing me."
“Of course not. The catacombs are too well known; one really can’t hide anything in there.” He paused to chew on his lip. “You could fit catacombs here, though it would take a great deal of advanced structural magic—”
“He’s after the same thing he’s always been after.” Harry stared up at Hagrid, unblinking. “Protection for his family. And for himself.”
Draco, who was keeping his distance from the owl, gave him a pointed look. "Shira and Jamie are arriving Sunday morning."
“Meanwhile, though, I’m still confused about something.” Harry leaned back a bit with the air of someone about to turn the subject. “You have loads of good memories here, I think, even if some of them involve quarrels—”
Draco shrugged, cool and nonchalant. “I pay off my life debt to him. So, you see, he does have the right to interfere in my life.”
Harry had expected that. This office didn’t seem a likely place for storing childhood memories about house elves, so those memories must be deeper down. Behind another password, no doubt. He opened his mouth to ask what sort of memories were here, but abruptly shut it again. He did have some training in legilimency, damn it. He would figure this out.
"Her girlfriend . . . so you each bring a separate date and then talk about your potential engagement? How does that possibly work?"
“Not sure,” Ron answered. “I don’t use it much, but it has its advantages. It’s flexible, and it allows white to get his dark-square bishop out early. I’m sure Draco will use it against you some time.”
“Make it clear that you might not accept any arranged marriage.” He paused. "That's what I want, Draco. Give us a chance."
Draco grinned. “Don’t worry. I don’t expect your taste to be as refined as mine. You’ll prefer something more neo-classical, no doubt.”
"Not all of them," Harry countered. "Hermione hasn't. Neither has Noa. Hell, Noa didn't even do the hyphenated thing."
Draco stared at the figures retreating downstairs before turning back to Ron. “What?” he demanded in a whisper. “I wasn’t rude to your father.”
"He's joking, Kreacher. Oh, we brought you home a Thai iced tea. Harry says you like them. It's on that table there."
"Yeah, that's the one." Harry paused to consider. "I want you to tell Shira, and your parents, that it might not happen."
It was so easy to let the ferret side of his brain take over. He almost never had nightmares as a ferret, and when he did they were more easily dismissed or even forgotten.
“I'll be happy to tour the house later,” he promised. “But for now, I need you to deliver a private message to Robards, the head of the aurors.”
He knew it wouldn’t be like a pensieve, and yet the initial sensation was the same: he was falling. But the similarity ended there. He wasn’t tumbling into a specific memory. It was more like plummeting through a whirlwind: colours, sounds, scents, and emotions spun around him.
But this was a first. Harry had ever seen Draco like this: grey eyes narrowed, not in judgment, but in a combination of curiousity and concentration. His entire body tense with focus as he paid heed to each word Harry spoke.
Toffee, meanwhile, was staring up at him, tears still welling up in her eyes and a thoroughly confused look on her face.
“Yeah, I noticed.” He had given Draco his wand for that second duel. “The wands must sense some kind of connection between us.”
“It was more about meditation. She told me once that if there were such a thing as a truly disciplined mind amongst muggles—a true master of mediation, I mean . . .”
She didn't argue that, turning back to the original subject instead. “Why is he asking Ron’s advice about boundaries?”
But she thought that Harry should be seen out and about with Malfoy, so the paparazzi—another muggle term—would see that he wasn't abusing the ferret. Their relationship should look 'friendly and respectful.'
Harry didn't have nearly that much faith in Lucius Malfoy, but, once again, he kept his mouth closed.
“We, um, were supposed to work on it at home.” Weasley crumpled the foil and shoved it back into his pocket. “But then Harry went and rescued Malfoy and—well, we all got a bit distracted.”
"So you've made sure that Draco is no longer under Robards' thumb, Mr. Potter." Draco's father finally put his wine glass down.
"I suspect Granger would agree. She thinks our relationship might help do that—heal the past. But we still have to make it down the aisle, Potter."
Fuck, how was he supposed to answer that? Half of him wanted to leap at the chance, but the other half knew better.
Harry was tempted to order him to tell him now, but Draco was already half asleep. So he closed his eyes as well, and allowed himself to drift off . . . only to wake up an hour later, shivering.
Harry frowned. “Skeeter got her story; it will run in the Prophet tomorrow. She knows that Robards hung you out to dry and that I disobeyed orders to fetch you back.”
“I know, Harry. It switched its allegiance to you.” He rolled his eyes. “Merlin, you were so fucking gentle when we both realised there was no point in me taking it back. I almost started hating you all over again.”
“And I deserved it, after everything I went through today.” Draco glanced down at his lover. “Which was all your fault, of course.”
“Well, I’ve absolute faith that you’ll become head of them one day.” He didn’t look particularly happy about that, but he looked as if he meant it. “And just as much faith that Granger will get herself elected Minister for Magic.”
“Not long.” He pushed himself up a bit so that he could see Kreacher. “You served my great aunt? So this is the old Black place, is it?”
Nonetheless, Harry seem flabbergasted. “Buckbeak? That’s not the same thing—” Somehow he stopped himself from finishing that sentence. He swallowed instead before continuing. “Look, I love Buckbeak. You know that. And Draco was wrong for what he almost let happen to him. Completely wrong. But Draco was only fourteen.”
Potter and Weasley exchanged glances, but neither demanded their own copy. Both seemed content for Granger to give these accounts the careful and meticulous reading they required. That settled one long-standing question for Draco: Granger had clearly kept the saviour and his sidekick from failing half their classes at Hogwarts. He wondered how many papers she had written for them.
“We were, Arthur.” Hermione smiled. “And this floor—well, you can see it’s a suite of rooms now, really. Almost a flat, but without a proper front door. Harry and Draco had them fixed up for us. And I’m sure we have Kreacher and Toffee to thank too.”
“Grown on you?” Jamie shook her head. “Don’t listen to him, Harry,” she ordered—and it did sound rather like an order. “We heard all about you while Draco was living here.”
Harry coughed a little to hide the fact that his head was spinning. An arranged marriage? To an American witch? Somehow he pictured the Malfoys insisting on an English pure-blood. A nominally Anglican one.
“It’s two in the morning,” he pointed out, his voice strained. “What does Shacklebolt want with you now?”
Draco allowed his lips to curl into a sneer as he rolled onto his back. “Yes, I should certainly bow before your superior skills.”
Light exploded in the hallway. A painful light that struck Harry full on, lifting him up and hurling him to the floor.
The tears vanished, replaced by a shrewd look. “I wish to serve here. There be many elves at Malfoy Manor—here, Toffee will shine!”
“You mean resume, right?” Benjamin crinkled his brow. “Well, for a job like this, you’d have get into a good college or university. And ace the right courses.”
What happened next was beyond Narcissa’s powers to mitigate. Potter was shouting, enraged, about the bloody Prophet and Lucius was snarling at him for his idiocy when it came to dealing with the press and somehow both men drew their wands—
“Ow!” Potter grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and lifted him up until his hind feet were scrabbling for purchase. “Behave, Draco.”
Draco kept up the deferential look—no, better to call it what it was. His suck-up look. How many times had they seen Draco give that look to Snape? But he looked even paler now. Almost as if he were about to pass out.
“So . . .” Harry paused to swallow. “Are you really in love with me, or are you just grateful to me?”
Harry rolled his eyes. "That's why you won't call it off yourself? You're afraid I won't want you after a few months?"
"Well, as far as I can see, American wizards are ahead of us when it comes to relations with muggles. I mean, of course they keep magic secret, but wizards here seem much more comfortable in the muggle world."
Shit. This was not going to go over well. “Lucius Malfoy was admitted. Ron already brought Draco home—he'd been up for forty-eight hours straight—but Narcissa is here, along with two of my house guests.”
But Draco ignored him as he continued. “Close your eyes, Harry. There’s a memory of mine hidden right in this room. You need to centre yourself so you can find it.”
“Muggles call that an induced coma.” Harry frowned. “If they haven’t woken him—that means they still don’t know what’s wrong?”
“Those were different. They were good memories. You didn’t mind me seeing them. You weren’t even trying to protect them. Not really.”
But Draco shook his head. "I want to see if you reach the same conclusion I did. I doubt the twats at the ministry will. Except maybe Robards and Shacklebolt—we'll see."
“Don’t we all? Half of us probably have some form of—what do muggles call it? PTSD or something. But there’s no professional we can talk to about the trauma of surviving a wizarding war.”
The house elves looked from one man to the other. Neither bothered to hide their interest in the power struggle that was taking place in front of them.
Harry had no idea what he was doing. He had only called in this life debt because it seemed to mean something to Malfoy, not because he understood what it actually involved. With his luck, it was some ancient pure-blood tradition with a zillion protocols.
Kreacher, meanwhile, was standing in the centre of the room, extolling Draco's virtues. He paused only to answer Harry's question. "You are 'Master.' And as your chosen companion, young Mr. Malfoy is 'Master Draco.'"
Harry blushed, but managed to fill her in without halting and stumbling over his words. Well, not too much.
“Don’t worry. I had my own difficulties with the man. Starting in sixth year, of course.” He sighed. “I assume the aurors taught you both occlumency and legilimency. And at some point you must have learned some sort of basic meditation.”
“I was possibly kvetching,” Draco explained, as if he were making a concession, “but definitely not whinging.”
“That thing?” Harry chuckled as he moved toward the window. “You had a beautiful owl yourself, as I recall. An eagle owl, yeah?”
Harry nodded. "Yeah. This isn't fair, Hermione, but he's right. Besides, my home at Grimmauld Place was probably acquired the same way. Maybe the Potter fortune too, back in the day."
“I was only spying on you, you know. The others were just there. And you got your revenge.” Harry found himself rubbing his nose.
Granger narrowed her eyes at him, but she didn't snatch it away. Draco raised her hand to his lips and kissed it. In fact, he overdid the courtliness enough to break through her anger and bring an exasperated smile to her face.
“Former Death Eater.” Harry took a deep breath. “A former Death Eater who didn't identify me  when he had the chance, and who just risked his life in service to our ministry.”
"In the New York area? Probably not. I did, but only because the Baumgartens never met a muggle appliance they didn’t like.”
Draco did that thing he always did with his eyebrows: that weird but effective way he had of arching them. "Then I'm a better actor than I gave myself credit for."
"Perhaps, but there's no point. Not when I got everything else I wanted." He paused to straighten up and turn toward Malfoy. "You're no longer an agent. Robards will debrief you officially tomorrow and thank you for your service."
He knew what Draco looked like when he felt proud of some accomplishment. And when he felt safe and content. And when he felt grateful. And when he was annoyed with Harry in a good-natured, exasperated way.
Draco shrugged. "Famous nineteenth century author. Never read her works, but at least this film is based on a classic."
“That’s it, isn’t it?” Harry let out a snort of laughter, even though there was nothing funny about this. “What are you, Draco? A two year old testing his boundaries?”
“No,” Harry interrupted. “They can't take the train. Or apparate. Too much luggage, even with a variation on the extension charm."
Draco folded his arms across his chest. “Possibly. When you convince me that this is, indeed, my forever home.”
“How much time?” Ron knew he was being curt and possibly unreasonable—and why in Merlin’s name was he doing this for Draco Malfoy’s sake?—but he waited for an answer anyway.
"Are you really this clueless?" Draco stared at him, half in amusement and half in bewilderment. "You think Shira and I can't manage to shag enough to produce a couple of little Malfoys?"
"Don't be like this." Harry’s blood started pumping hard—he could feel it rushing to his face. “Don’t you dare turn cold on me.”
“Anyway, I finally gave up talking about muggles and tried complimenting that new estate car of his. He obviously put some painstaking magic into it. But that just raised his hackles for some reason. And that’s when he said I reminded him of my father.”
"It's all right, Harry." He let his hand drop, but that fond look was back in his eyes. "Our relationship still includes, you know, affection and—well, whatever the fuck else is happening between us."
Somehow that laugh and that bit of muggle slang—even though both were mixed with a classic Malfoy sneer—cut through the tension. “I wish you had. I would have . . . I don’t know what I would have done.”
“Well, he doesn’t!” Weasley stood his ground. “No use sugar-coating it. Remember how he made Hagrid’s life miserable, trying to get him sacked and gossiping to the Prophet? And never mind him and that vanishing closet and letting those monsters into Hogwarts—”
There was a hitch in Granger's breath. "Speaking of establishing things, we—Ron, we ought to make certain that Draco knows he doesn't owe us . . . there's no life debt. We wouldn't have—"
They knew, of course, that Draco had done some services for Robards to help keep his father out of prison. But Draco had led them to believe that he was quietly assisting the aurors with their financial investigations. That he was almost the equivalent of a forensic accountant, and in no greater danger than an average accountant.
“Yeah, your life is rough.” He leaned forward and planted a light kiss on Draco’s mouth. “Now listen, I’m not going to find another witch or wizard. And I’m not going to get tired of you. And we are in a relationship. I promised your parents I’d keep it quiet for now, so we don’t have to deal with the Prophet finding out about that too, but I also told them there’s no way I’m letting you go through with this arranged marriage—”
But Draco had to endure a private conversation with his father. The man had made it clear that he did not believe Draco's relationship with Harry was platonic. He was willing to make his peace with that, so long as Draco still made a respectable marriage and still produced heirs.
Draco, however, was by no means cowed. He had ordered Potter to remain at Malfoy Manor last night, and Potter had meekly agreed. If their sudden passion for one another didn’t burn itself out, they would likely end up more-or-less equal partners. Draco wouldn’t be trampled, at any event.
"That's an awful lot of trouble," Hermione said. "And they've probably made other arrangements as well."
“No!” Draco felt his shoulders tighten. “The debt is real and permanent, Harry. That’s what I’ve been trying to explain. There is no cancelling it.”
“True,” she said. “Except that you did learn to suffer in silence, from our sixth year until the end of the war.” She paused. “ At least some of the time.”
“I’m not worried.” Draco let himself fall backward on the bed, dragging Harry on top of him. “I hear you’re really good under pressure.”
Draco shrugged. "It won't go back to the muggles, Granger. Someone at the ministry will end up lining their pockets. And, anyway, protecting the place for my family is part of my bargain with Potter."
“Tosser.” Harry gave him an affectionate punch to the shoulder. “So you promise not to repeat any of this? You can discuss it with Ron and Hermione; they already know. But no one else does.”
Draco sniffed at Ron and then at Granger, trying to determine the problem. They both smelled off, somehow, but they hadn’t a moment ago. Then suddenly both of them were sitting up, and Ron was chucking his chin.
Draco snorted. “Of course I hated it. You Know Who—no, I'm done with that. Voldemort was forcing my hand. He was threatening my parents. And me.”
But Draco didn’t wait to hear how it was different. Instead he went through the lightning-fast ritual of summoning his most playful, curious and, paradoxically, restful self. A bare second later and he was in ferret-form, burrowing under the loose tee-shirt Harry had worn to bed, and settling down on Harry’s chest.
"He's agnostic," Shira said with a huff. "Not that it matters, but there are a million other reasons he shouldn't convert to anything."
“Yes.” He sounded matter-of-fact now. “You being an unintentional horcrux fits the facts perfectly. When you died, so did the horcrux in you. Then you were, er, allowed to come back. I’m only surprised that . . . .” Draco paused. “Well, it doesn’t matter.”
Harry was blushing too, actually. He could feel the tinge of heat to his face. But it wasn't embarrassment, exactly. Or if it was, it was mixed with something else.
Harry laughed. “Good point.” A thought seemed to strike him. “You didn't tell McGonagall why you were spending so much time as a ferret, did you?”
"Yes. But Shira and I weren't going to make a final decision until September, after her brother's bar mitzvah. So you'll wait that long too. Agreed?"
Hermione had already guessed as much—and so had Draco, probably—but she still felt her face go white. No wonder Ron had left with him. He wasn’t just helping to smooth things over with Hagrid; he was acting as a bodyguard.
“Delighted to hear it,” Lucius said. “Still, no need to flaunt your relationship in public. Especially now, when only the most traditional families still respect the concept of arranged marriages—”
"Are you?" He didn't look surprised as he helped himself to a seat. "The Prophet tried to out you once—claimed you'd been seen in a muggle gay club in New York—but, well, it's the Prophet."
“So the idea is for me to produce Jewish, pure-blood children who will grow up to be outstanding wizards.” Shira paused to give Draco a judicious look. “And you must admit that Draco will make beautiful babies.”
“Oh yes.” Draco’s voice was sour now. “Aboard the Hogwarts Express, of course. When you were using your invisibility cloak to spy on me. And Blaise. And Pansy. And—”
Draco adjusted himself again as they continued to chat about the game, closing his eyes as he sprawled against Ron's chest. This was good, he decided. He only wished Granger were here too, so he could account for each member of the Golden Trio. The ferret side of his brain liked knowing where all his people were.
“You’re going to be tiresome about it too, aren’t you?" Shira winked at him. "I think you and Jamie are going to get along really well.”
But he shouldn’t have worried about that. He should have worried about the poisonous tongue of Rita Skeeter instead.
Lucius put down his wand immediately. She should have known that he, at least, would never harm her.
“Harry.” Narcissa attempted to sound calm and serene as she nodded a greeting. “Is everything quite all right? Is Draco—”
Draco didn't answer that. Which probably meant he was concussed or something. Harry probably was too.
“No idea. I’m filing that one under Potter’s Problems.” He kissed Harry once more, took him by the shoulders, and then turned his body toward the bathroom. “Now get ready—Granger and Weasley will be here any moment.”
"I'm in," George piped up. "And Angelina will come." He paused to give Draco a searching look and then bit his lip. "How, er, welcome are you at most wizarding establishments?"
“She can’t be the one setting those boundaries.” Weasley paused to roll his eyes. “Fuck, Malfoy. I dunno how good I’ll be at this.”
He wanted to ask her what she meant by that, but stopped himself. She was right; Draco was more content than blissfully happy. But who was blissfully happy after the war? They all had baggage. They all had trauma.
“He is rather devout, actually. So is Jamie; I presume she’ll convert eventually. But they both find the patriarchal slant of scripture problematic as well.”
So a magical creature injured him and he didn’t want McGonegal to find out. Word might well weave its way back to her regardless, though.
Harry wanted to groan at having his own words tossed back at him. They we're both getting good at that, actually.
"I disagree," Shira said quietly. There was no sharpness in her voice now, just a pained sympathy for her friend. "That was its own type of religion, centered around the doctrine of pure blood supremacy and an evil bastard who wanted the whole wizarding world to worship him."
Perhaps that explained why Hermione hadn't been shocked to find Harry and Draco tumbling headlong into a relationship.
Draco seemed to weigh that possibility. "Unlikely. They would be prime suspects. And they do like you a bit, you know, for saving me."
Once again, Hagrid struggled to form a response. He probably wasn’t keen to take a stranger for coffee, let alone a stranger who referred to Narcissa Malfoy as ‘Aunt Cissy.’ But he couldn’t seem to piece together a polite refusal.
"I know.” Thank Merlin, or God, or whoever, that Ron and Bill had already forgiven Draco. “But your father—is he willing to give Draco a chance?"
"Not necessarily." Harry stood up too and, to Draco's astonishment, took his hand. "I think we can handle anyone looking for trouble."
“Well, then, that’s sorted. No arranged marriage for me. Unless you change your mind come September.”
The ensuing pillow fight was probably more competitive than it needed to be, but it ended with both boys collapsed on the bed, laughing. It was the first time Harry could remember fighting Draco with no wands and no fists involved, and somehow that seemed to settle certain long-held grudges. For both of them, he hoped.
The words, put like that, sounded casual and matter-of-fact. But Harry felt each one—no, Draco felt each one etch itself into his brain.
It was such a mindfuck, though. This was Draco Malfoy, who tormented him for years—sneering the whole time, except when he was laughing at someone. Yet here he was, content to go on and on about the dining room’s potential.
“Doubt that. But here goes: despite all the loud, well-reasoned arguments, this is still a place for contemplation, yeah?”
“I have my ticket and my muggle identification,” Harry continued. “And an expertly packed suitcase.”
He arranged himself cross-legged on the bed, somehow looking elegant as he did so. "Morning, Potter. Sleep well?"
Draco was the first to break the silence. “Safe flight and all that.” He stared down at Harry’s hand—the one still holding his. "I’m sorry I haven’t gotten you to a proper nail salon yet. You still need a manicure.”
Harry laughed. “Yeah. And he always knew what buttons to press. Still does—you should hear him go on about Hagrid. He still doesn't think he should be teaching.”
“I’m not procrastin—fuck.” Harry let go of him and pushed up to his feet. Then he crossed his arms over his chest, enjoying, however briefly, the sensation of looking down at Draco, who was still seated on the bed.
So the saviour was going to be relying on raw power as he poked through Draco’s brain instead of discipline. So Draco was going to need enough discipline for the both of them.
“I don’t know what happened. That’s half the problem. He insisted on driving me to Heathrow to collect Shira and Jamie—but only me, so we could chat in private along the way. Get to know one another, Granger said. Not that it was her idea. Or, at least, I don’t think it was.”
"We'll go to a pub to celebrate, yeah?" Ron said. "You, me, Hermione, your New York friends—that all right, 'Mione?"
Harry shook his head. He wasn’t up to this conversation. Not now. “Sorry, Hagrid. I really must find Narcissa. We’ll talk soon, if you’d like. Tomorrow or the day after—why don’t you come to mine?”
She felt her own face heat up. “Then this is an even more important question. Is Harry pressuring you to sleep with him? Even unintentionally? I mean, you’re not just going along with what you think he wants—”
Harry opened his eyes and just stared for a few moments. Then he walked down the aisle, pausing at one pew in particular before continuing on. When he reached the front of the sanctuary, he turned around and sat down on the first step of the bimah.
It was hard to think of someone who deserved to rot in Azkaban more than Lucius Malfoy. Harry had never forgotten how willing Lucius had been to see murder done in the Hall of Prophecy, and that was just the start of his wrongs. Somehow, though, Harry kept his mouth shut.
Ron glanced at Malfoy with frank admiration—that bored drawl of his was an effective way to close an interview. Much better than saying ‘no comment.’
But for the second day in a row, he was up at an ungodly hour. Harry cracked one eye open: five o'clock.
It had started a while back, just before Draco’s trial. But it had really—what was the word he wanted?—blossomed, maybe. Yeah, that worked. It had really blossomed the other night.
Harry finally smiled. “Yeah, that was rather brilliant of you, actually. If the aurors hadn’t been looking for me, I would have ended up back in London. But that’s not the point.”
There was a muggle painting in the room too, quietly dominating the opposite wall. It was a charming picture of two camels, of all things. Harry forced himself off the bed for a closer look.
Fuck. Hermione didn’t know about that yet. How could Ron have forgotten that? He was too used to telling her everything, that’s how.
He paused a moment, coming back to his human senses, and then turned to nod at Potter's guests. “Granger. Weasley.”
Ron scoffed. "You've got an awful lot of conditions, Malfoy. In fact, you make out a lot better than Harry in this deal—"
Fortunately, Weasley’s brain seemed to be working just fine. “You want to bring Malfoy? Are you barking, Harry? Hagrid doesn’t want to see him.”
“None of us sleep well after the war, you know.” His voice was soft. “Not all the time. Even occlumency can’t fix that.”
And yet he was scarcely paying attention. He only cared enough about politics to vote intelligently and conservatively; he had lost interest in acquiring power for himself or his family.
“I can probably bring you as a plus one if you fancy a trip to the states,” Draco offered. “You have to survive a long synagogue service, but at least there’s a party afterward.”
"Toffee answered the FRONT DOOR!" Kreacher all but pounded on the old table. “Toffee has never been trained to buttle!”
“So you must be Hagrid." There was an odd note of satisfaction in her voice. “I’ve heard so much about you from Ron and Hermione.”
George looked amused. "Never mind all that. We'll see you on Tuesday. And I expect you to come 'round the shop soon and explain why I should accept muggle money."
He shrugged, blushing a little. "Mostly for your sake—but I also want to remind the bastard that Harry owns that obnoxious mansion of his now."
“You can walk out of here and apparate.  But don't. If you're serious about this”—Harry knew he didn't have to explain what 'this' was—“just stay put.”
“Nothing. Let’s find Granger and Weasley, shall we? Hopefully they’re not inside.” He nodded toward the Three Broomsticks. “Madame Roserta won’t want to see my face.”
George came to a skidding, laughing stop near the wall as Harry grabbed Draco by the scruff of his neck and pulled him up off the floor.
“I think I agree with my father.” Ron shrugged. “He believes that old saying about religion making good people better and bad people worse.”
“I always thought you were projecting a bit.” Shira raised her eyebrows at Draco. “Maybe you’re the one who wants to be licking—”
Harry didn’t bother to bite back his laugh this time. “Uh, I don't think muggle London will be shocked at the sight of two goths.”
Draco sighed. “Sorry for all this talk about someone you don’t know, Potter, but my parents are doing their utmost to arrange a marriage for me.” He stared down at his plate. “At the moment, Shira is their prime candidate.”
To his credit, Weasley offered them privacy. But Draco shrugged that off—with him present, the conversation was less likely to drift into any awkward territory about life debts. You could never tell whether McGonagall was going to come down on the traditional or progressive side of an issue, and Draco didn’t fancy another Granger-esque lecture.
"Shhhh." Draco wrapped his arms more tightly around him, holding him through his climax. Potter returned the favour as Draco came a moment later.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Hermione was sitting next to him on the couch, whispering. “I shouldn’t have brought Bill and George over without your permission, but there was no talking them out of it—”
"No." Harry forced himself to look like this was a normal conversation. He had no intention of letting Draco know how out of his depth he was. "No, that's all right. This stays between us."
There was a warning note in Harry’s voice. Draco would have been offended, but the warning seemed designed for Weasley.
Of course. Harry knew his testimony had saved Draco and his mother from prison, but he'd always wondered how Lucius had kept his freedom after the war. Ratting out other Death Eaters had helped,  but it hadn't seemed enough.
Harry shook his head, laughing a little. “Draco, I would never have refused the opportunity to put you under my thumb. Not from the day we met.”
“I still want to wipe that sneer off your face.” Harry walked over to him and put his arms around Draco’s waist. “In a good way.”
He even knew Draco’s expressions when he was in his twitchy ferret form. He could tell when the adorable little furball was angry, playful, curious, sleepy, or, again, when he felt safe and content.
“Seriously Potter? You don’t think it’d be a bit awkward to discuss what we need to in the middle of services?”
Draco nodded. “Yeah. She’ll never grow up. She’ll never stop obsessing over her own misery.” He paused. “But she listened to me when I had no one else to turn to. So . . . I’ll always owe her something.”
Harry wasn't sure how far he could push Draco with this particular line of teasing, but fortunately he just laughed. He stopped, though, when he noticed Harry looking more serious.
Harry swallowed a smile. Draco seemed to take this all too seriously. "We've got other things to worry about. We have to talk with your parents and figure out how to transfer the manor to me."
“I know. I was stupid. Impossibly stupid. But it was partly Snape’s fault too.” He paused. “I’ve learned to love the memory of that man. But back then . . . .”
"In a moment, Potter." Draco glanced at each of his parents in turn. His mother was turning white. His father was in danger of breaking the wine glass in his hand by the sheer tightness of his grip.
"That too. Robards wants to fire him for going rogue, but can you imagine how that would play out in the Daily Prophet?"
“Well . . .” Harry paused. How was he going to get through this conversation without insulting his lover? “It sounds a bit fussy. But that’s just me.”
“No, not technically. But it’s real, Potter. Because if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t be here to worry about whether I should have invited you to my wedding—or whether you would have accepted.”
Harry would have lingered in that room for ages, but soon they were headed downstairs toward a foyer, a couple of small offices, and a few short hallways of what must be the classrooms.
“Enough!” Narcissa almost didn’t recognize her own voice. She never yelled. But that word, full force, had definitely come out of her mouth.
But Draco just snorted. "No designs, Weasley, but I'll admit it: I wouldn't kick the saviour of the wizarding world out of bed."
"Ron, relax. Just tell Draco to talk about muggle things. Draco's comfortable in the muggle world now."
Draco just shrugged. “I don’t appreciate being left behind so you can have a private chat about me with my parents.”
“Right. And he risked you accidentally killing Ron and Katie in your idiotic attempts to assassinate him.” He hesitated. “Ron’s the one who worked out all that about Dumbledore, actually. He’s not so fond of the man’s memory anymore.”
“Quite heroic, Mr. Potter.” Skeeter's voice carried easily now; everyone else in the crowd had fallen silent. “But why would performing your duty as an auror entitle you to a life debt?”
“But you thought you had a fucking right to, didn’t you?” Draco snorted as he turned his face away to glare at the wall. “It’s like sixth year again, isn’t it?”
Harry could tell, as they laid together on the floor of the sitting room—exhausted and bruised and bleeding—that Draco had changed even more since the war. He was still a snarky, bratty, snob. But he had largely shed his prejudices, and his cruelty, and that made all the difference.
Draco rolled his eyes with an air of long-suffering. “Edward Remus Lupin is my first cousin once removed.”
For a moment, Harry couldn’t breathe. Or perhaps he forgot to breathe. Or perhaps he forgot how to breathe.
Harry studied him for a moment and, with a wary sigh, repositioned himself next to Ron, who was still holding the ferret.
“Ah.” Harry nodded. “This seems to be a . . . a frequent memory? You sitting there between Benjamin and Aunt Sarah, I mean. Oh, Jamie too?”
Draco shut him up with a quick, chaste kiss to the lips. "You can't be my friend when I'm relying on you to keep me in line. You don't order Granger or Weasley about, do you?"
“Yes.” Narcissa hesitated. “And if the friendship is strong enough—as I hope it might be between Draco and Shira—either spouse might, by mutual agreement, seek romantic fulfillment elsewhere.”
Kreacher muttered something that suggested he would like her to find out only much later, if at all. Draco grinned in sympathy and turned the subject.
But in Draco's mind, all he could see was Dumbledore struck by the killing curse, his body tumbling . . . then the wild flight through Hogwarts, Snape grabbing Draco by the collar . . . Greyback and the others flanking them . . . then the hut burning as Harry tried to stop them, tried to stop Snape . . . .
Ron put an encouraging arm over his shoulder. “My dad just thought—well, seeing as you and Harry . . . .”
But he shouldn’t have worried. Whatever the man’s misgivings, his father was clearly determined to be polite. He even stepped forward with his hand outstretched. “Yes, we’ve met. I understand you’ve spent quite a bit of time in New York?”
Harry had never thought about Draco's birthday before, though he might have seen it on some court paper or other back during the trials. In all their time at Hogwarts, he had never wondered when or how his nemesis celebrated the day. "Thank Merlin you gave me some warning! What do you—"
“Bisexual,” his dad repeated. “That might take getting used to, but . . . well, of course it doesn’t matter. But his choice of boyfriend is problematic.”
Draco sighed. Then he leaned forward and kissed Harry on the lips, pausing only to give a playful little bite to his lower one. “It’s complicated. Besides, I . . . I wasn’t a spoiled brat anymore, Harry. I knew I didn’t have a claim on you and I knew how you felt about my father.”
There was a delighted yip from George—Bill couldn’t come up with a better way to describe that sound—and then somehow Draco was squirming out of Ron's arms and into George's, whose whole face probably lit up.
Harry seemed to take their words seriously, because he turned to Draco with an apologetic smile. “I know you and Hagrid didn’t get on back at Hogwarts. But—I’m really close with him. And I want him to know how much you mean to me. I know he’s not always discreet, but . . . look, I think he’ll keep this quiet.”
Potter had testified for Draco and Draco’s mother, keeping them both out of Azkaban. All of Draco’s pleading couldn’t convince him to testify on behalf of his father too . . . but Potter had promised he wouldn’t testify against him either. And he wouldn’t speak out against any deal the man cut with the ministry.
Draco felt his eyes go wide. He bit back any response, though. He was not about to risk ruining this moment.
As the owl launched itself out the window, Draco felt his heartbeat return to a more manageable rate. “Let me get my wand; I’ll take care of your chest.”
"Yeah." Draco blinked, allowing his mother's words to sink in. "He collapsed, but he's still breathing. I don't know what's happening. It sounds like heart failure, but—"
Harry fell silent. Draco was right. Well, half-right, perhaps. Harry had a responsibility to keep him safe, and that meant, in part, ensuring that he could apparate out of a dangerous situation.
“I did have to die. And Dumbledore knew it.” Harry smiled a little, knowing full well the smile was a bit sour. “You know Snape gave me his memories as he was dying?”
Draco, as it turned out, hated having his nails trimmed—at least in ferret form. A proper salon for humans was an entirely different experience. There would be no ugly chesterfield in a salon, no Weasley to hold him down on it, and no Potter to show just how inept a saviour could be with a pair of clippers.
Predictably, Harry laughed and scratched him (through the shirt) behind his ears. “All right, furball. I’ll let it go tonight.”
Harry, obviously, did not see Hagrid’s shortcomings. And it wasn’t that he was a half-giant. Draco was making an effort to curb his prejudice as far as that went. He was less successful than Harry would like, no doubt, but still.
He opened his eyes to find himself right by one of the office windows, peering out over Manhattan from that dizzying and exhilarating height.
He was about to step away from the doorway to make room for them when his eyes found Draco. For a moment, Hagrid just stood there staring, but then he shook his head in distaste.
“Hello, Toffee.” He reached for his glasses. “So, ah, who are you, exactly?” He wanted to ask what she was doing in his house, but Draco must be to blame for that.
He spoke in a drawling, bored tone—but Ron wasn’t fooled. “No specific threat, Ferret, but we’re assuming there’s a target on your back.”
“Because I pulled your arse out of the fire—literally!—twice now. I didn't do that so the ministry could just throw your life away.”
“And you think you’ve got a say in that?” Draco tried to put his habitual sneer into the words, but they came out oddly flat.
But Lucius refused to be goaded. After one penetrating glance at his son, he turned back to Harry with a thoughtful expression. “Oh, Blair and Labour will triumph this June, as expected. Blair is popular, Hague hasn’t healed the divisions amongst the Tories, and no one wants to upset the apple cart just now. I imagine few people will even bother to vote.”
“First you came back for me in the Room of Hidden Things, or Room of Requirement or whatever we’re calling it. You risked your life to save mine.”
In fact, she and Ron should confront Draco with an unpleasant truth. He deserved to know how much more he owed Harry.
“No.” Harry shook his head decisively. “Dumbledore might even want the truth to be told; he knew his shortcomings.”
“I think you’re wrong.” He spoke with what Harry recognised as a New York accent, although it wasn’t as exaggerated as the ones he’d heard on TV or in films.
"Oh." Harry stared at him, impressed that he'd put together such a calming and, well, grown-up room. Ron and Hermione's flat looked like it belonged to frazzled, caffeine-addicted university students. And 12 Grimmauld Place was currently a gothic disaster.
It was still sumptuous, but not nearly so heavy. It was the sort of room that granted you a reprieve from the rest of the house.
Harry sighed and reached out to him. Somehow there was too much space between them now. “Come here.”
"It's clearly not perfect as you're tensing up again." How did Draco manage to sound haughty, exasperated and kind all at once? "You can do some of your own kvetching, whining and whinging, you know. You're entitled."
“They’re protected by passwords, Harry.” Draco kept walking as he spoke, not even bothering to glance behind.
No bones were broken; Harry was sure of that. Well of course they weren’t. This wasn’t real, at least in the sense that Harry wasn’t physically here. He shook himself, remembering how legilimency worked.
“You must.” She paused to put her hands on her hips. “I notice you and Ron didn’t bring any paperwork home.”
Draco shot him a suspicious glance as he turned the page. Harry had turned bright red when he mentioned the picture. A second later, Draco understood why. It was almost sickeningly sweet. He was in ferret-form, curling up in Harry’s arms and gazing up adoringly at him. Harry was smiling down at him before looking up at some ministry employee.
“Ron and I will handle that.” Harry leaned over and brushed his lips against Draco's. “Not everyone holds what happened in the war against you. McGonagall doesn’t. You said everything went well with her—that it was a good talk.”
"Oh, don't worry, Potter." Draco tightened his grip too, even as he put the Malfoy sneer back into his voice. "I mean to dedicate my life to obeying your every whim."
“A thick one, sometimes. If you had come to me after the trials, and told me that Robards was blackmailing you, I’d have protected all of you back then. And the manor. Your life would never have been at risk.”
Weasley and Granger, meanwhile, exchanged glances, both obviously unsure what to say. Well, Draco would have to take the initiative, then.
"I didn't. I have Toffee checking in with my parents each day; she had a note from the man waiting for me when the four of us got home—word of that little interview must have spread like fiendfyre. Toffee gave it to me right before my disastrous chess match with Weasley."
He wondered, for a moment, if the family had closed the dining room off. Perhaps they were trying to shut out the memories of living under the Dark Lord. Once Lucius dropped from his favour, they’d been living in terror.
But he didn’t have to obey gracefully, so he huffed out a purposely obnoxious sigh, rolled away from the man, and climbed out of bed. “Fine, Potter,” he said without a backward glance. “Just don’t expect miracles.”
Harry regarded him with a thoughtful look . . . a look that turned almost devious after a moment’s consideration. “Well, perhaps more time with Hagrid will help you two appreciate each other. And he did mention that he could find some chores for you. I know just what you think of manual labour—”
“No, stay, Weasley. Both of you.” Draco took a deep breath of his own. “I have some conditions for Potter, assuming he's serious. And I want witnesses.”
Was this the look Draco had worn whilst working on the vanishing closet? Was that combination of curiosity and concentration—with a healthy dollop of determination too—what made him so good at magic that required time and patience?
A cough from Hagrid brought her mind to the present. He was blushing a little; she could tell despite that massive beard, because his nose and forehead were turning red.
A prolonged silence fell over the table. Draco was afraid to break it. He knew just how his father felt about Potter—knew how much he still despised him.
Draco smacked his arm again. "Bastard." Then he pushed himself up. "Enough talk. I've won our bet, remember? Time to pay up."
"Right." Ron forced himself not to roll his eyes. He never thought he’d hear old Kreacher—who was as tough and hard-bitten as they came—sounding as forlorn as Dobby used to over some imagined failing.
Draco tumbled over himself and set off after George. The game of ‘it’—or ‘tag’ or ‘tig’ or whatever one wished to call it—continued in madcap fashion. Harry was the only one who didn’t waste a minute staring stupidly; he positioned himself so that he could snatch Draco on his next pass near the ugly couch.
One thing Harry would say for Malfoy Manor: the guest room bed was the most comfortable thing he could imagine. He draped himself across it, still dressed in the shirt and trousers that Draco had deemed appropriate for the evening, and relished the feeling of sinking into a cloud that somehow gave just the right support.
“Isn’t it obvious? I came back from the dead, Draco. I don’t want anyone thinking . . . well, you know.”
"They do. The Ford Focus should do. And it's an estate car, isn't it? Plenty of extra room even apart from the extension charms."
“You really don’t.” Harry gave him a pointed look. “But I do understand. I wasn’t the only sacrifice he was willing to make. He was the greatest wizard of his age; he could have told you at the beginning of sixth year that the Order could hide you and your mum from Voldemort. Instead, he let you play your hand—”
"You're not like him," Harry repeated. "Your real crimes were committed under duress. Lucius all but ran into Voldemort's arms, at least until you were in danger."
“Kreacher is saying it is a great honour,” Toffee piped up. “He is promising that our heads will be mounted someday too, when we are finding ourselves too old to work.”
But then he turned to her and grinned. “I know. But there’s a part of me that still resents coming in second to your marks.”
“What are you lot doing back here?” Draco stepped into the hallway and kicked the door closed behind him. Draco wanted no further objections from Harry on anything unwearable. And Kreacher, no doubt, could just apparate out.
But Harry did understand, sort of. He knew those three years must have been the making of Draco, because he had changed during them. No, that wasn’t fair. Maybe some of those changes had started earlier. Maybe he had dropped some of his prejudices earlier. And some of his cruelty.
"Ah." Harry untwisted and lowered himself again. "True. I like that, though. I mean, we should exchange numbers, obviously, but I also like the idea of you staying right at my side."
"Stop." Granger's voice was harsh now, and her face was suddenly bright red. "I'm still not ready to talk about that. But there was nothing you could have done to stop Bellatrix."
"I saw it when I visited you in Azkaban that time, remember? Back during the trials. And I saw it during your trial when you were made to expose it."
At least they weren’t in the formal dining room. Harry had a good idea of the crimes Voldemort had committed in there, including the use of a Hogwarts professor as a meal for Nagini. Merlin, why did the Malfoys want to keep this place? Harry would be just as happy to see it demolished.
Harry’s mobile was ringing. It took a second or two for that information to sink into his sleeping brain, but at length he reached for it without bothering to open his eyes.
Harry could almost hear Draco rolling his eyes in response. “I know what one synagogue is like. And that’s not just a muggle thing. He can ask any Jew in the wizarding world about that.”
That brought back the smirk. "You spend a lot of time caressing my hair or fur. You really do want a pet, don't you?"
Harry smirked as he thought back to the animal Draco had briefly transformed into as they escaped the burning house. He couldn't help it.
“It was a rather longer conversation than that. In fact, I remember begging you to testify for my father too. And I remember you refusing.”
“This is not a pensieve, Potter. Don’t expect these memories to be orderly or logical or objective.”
Of course, they had been careful in the spells they used. Harry thought there was a real possibility that any attack Draco made would bounce off Harry and strike Draco instead. But the wands seemed to understand that they were playing.
“I'm sorry. I was wrong, full stop. I want to take care of you. I want to know that you can always apparate to safety. So I thought if I could see what's holding you back . . . .”
Still, he didn’t relish the idea of confessing his mistake tonight to Hermione. And he couldn’t quite explain why his stomach was churning at the thought.
"Because, um . . ." Harry felt his face heat up. "The thing is, Draco, we have a violent history, yeah? I beat the crap out of you after that Quidditch match, you broke my nose on the train, I . . . I sliced you to pieces in the bathroom."
Harry's arms wrapped around him and Harry's lips brushed against his forehead, heedless of the sweat. “You stole all the blankets again,” he whispered.
“Right. The wards at Grimmauld Place.” How could he have forgotten? “We’ll change them so you can apparate in and out freely, I promise. Meanwhile, we should have walked outside with Ron and Hermione. You could have apparated yourself.”
"Enough, Draco. This decision has nothing to do with your past, as you're well aware. In fact, I think a hyphenated name for both of us would, well—it would be good. Another way of putting the past behind us."
“Yeah, saw that in the Prophet.” Hagrid shrugged as he set the cups on the table, his rough, enormous hands surprisingly gentle. “Sounds like he did good work, I’ll give the ferret that much. But why’d he do it? Weren’t out of the goodness of his heart.”
They both quieted after that. But it was a good, contented sort of quiet. At least until they neared their destination.
Draco wondered why he hadn't gone to a cinema whilst he was in New York; the Baumgartens, in general, weren't afraid of muggle outings.
“Oh, I know what they are.” Harry gave her a grim smile. “But, trust me, they love him. I don’t know for sure, but I don’t think they ever mistreated him.”
Hermione seemed to chew on her words before speaking them. “Hagrid's much better now that McGonagall requires all Hogwarts professors to submit their lesson plans.”
Her response was straight to the point; she was doing an admirable job of keeping her head. It was his father, she said, and proceeded to fill in the details.
Fuck! Harry closed his eyes, still falling, trying to make sense of everything bombarding him. This was the storm-like rush of thoughts, feelings, and memories that Draco allowed to remain at the surface. Harry needed to find the eye of this whirlwind, the calm centre, so he wouldn’t be battered by them.
"Yeah? Well, you're not wrong." He leaned forward and pressed his lips to Draco's chest. Just for a moment, though, and then he drew back. "I'm glad I didn't scar you. I don't want to hurt you. Maybe I did back then, but not like that. I had no idea what that spell would do."
“We spoke with Robards this morning,” he explained. “He got us into his office and away from the press for a few minutes. Almost that whole neo-Death Eater cell is in Azkaban now, awaiting trial.”
Even if Harry hadn't known Draco was gay, he would not have taken Shira for his girlfriend. The photo somehow screamed platonic friendship.
Draco, even though he couldn't vote in the states, favoured a Republican named McCain, who seemed to be a war hero of some sort. There was one other conservative at the table: a squarish, middle-aged woman who was backing Bush for the Republican party.
Harry was stretched out on the ugly chesterfield at Grimmauld Place, lying on his back with his knees over one of the arms. Draco, in ferret-form, was curled up on his chest, semi-dozing as Harry stroked him with one hand and held up a book about ferrets—an ironic gift from Weasley—with the other.
Any other time Harry would have been equally delighted to see his old friend, despite that last disastrous visit. But not now. Not here. Nonetheless, he forced a smile onto his face as he looked Hagrid over.
Harry smiled too, but he tightened his grip on Draco's wrist. "At that point, I couldn't figure out how to get into the room and see what you were up to. But I also knew you couldn't afford to get caught in there. I knew you'd be hiding and squirming for as long as I stayed on the other side of the wall."
She had a point, but Harry was loathe to admit it. “Maybe. Draco doesn't think highly of Dumbledore—not as a headmaster.”
But in this new and radically different world—one his parents had done nothing to prepare him for—his father would no doubt expect him to eavesdrop. If Draco cared to, he could glean all sorts of tidbits about Ministry personnel and events.
But it wasn’t about that. And it wasn’t just Draco ingratiating himself with the Golden Trio either. No, Draco seemed content to give up control—eager, even—as long as he liked and respected the person he was handing it over to.
Draco's mobile. Ron had brought it up in case Harry called. Draco scrambled off the bed—elegantly, of course—and grabbed for it.
Eventually Draco refocused on the conversation at hand. Both Granger and Weasley were reasonably sure they would be allowed to return to work on Monday. And Ron was betting that Robards would be gone by then—either sacked or forced to resign over the weekend.
The irony of that wasn't lost on Draco: he had been brought up to believe that he would be the one climbing the ladder of power and hobnobbing with other influential people in the Ministry. He had never imagined a world where a muggle-born and a blood-traitor would be the ones to come out on top.
Everything would have been all right, Hermione thought—or manageable, at least—if only Hagrid wouldn't keep on about Draco. But he ignored her quelling glances.
"Yeah." Harry nodded with more confidence than he felt. "They're going to be my parents-in-law. I want to have a civil relationship with them."
Draco didn’t say whether Mr. Baumgarten was prejudiced against wizard-muggle marriages, or Jewish-gentile marriages—so Harry assumed the answer was both. Well, as Draco mentioned earlier, at least Benj was Jewish. Presumably Mr. Baumgarten clung to that.
That gentle look was back in his eyes, softly gleaming the same way it had just after the trials. “Your wand belongs to me now. But . . . well, so do you.’
He felt sick to his stomach, just remembering. It was the night of Dumbledore's death. The night he was supposed to kill Dumbledore. The night he watched Snape do it for him.
“But you'll enjoy lording it over him.” Lucius was back to snarling. “How does it feel to have a Malfoy sworn to obey your every command?”
Merlin, Potter was enraged again. Draco could almost smell the anger in him, all directed at Robards. If he were in ferret-form, he would be able to smell that anger. Someday he would have to explain that Robards' ruthlessness actually served the aurors well. But not tonight.
There was a long moment of silence. Narcissa knew full well that Potter was enjoying their chagrin, but—with considerable effort—she pushed back her own annoyance. Potter was still the boy who had risked his life to save her son.
Still, the write-up was friendly and factual enough, covering Draco’s work for Robards, Harry’s daring rescue, and the fact that Harry had saved Draco’s life back during the war as well. There was an approving tone regarding the life debt, and the mutual consent—confirmed by Mr. Ronald Weasley and Mrs. Hermione Granger-Weasley—of both parties. His parents had chosen the reporter well.
Harry sighed. “That’s not going to happen. You’re happy with me; she’s happy with Jamie. Neither of you need an arranged marriage.”
They had spent it dealing with Draco's parents, dealing with Robards, and dealing with the tossers who gave Draco hell for not registering as an animagus sooner. Never mind that he'd been undercover, with permission from both Robards and Shacklebolt to avoid the registry.
“I didn’t call it in,” Harry spat. “Draco and I came to an agreement, that’s all. An agreement that’s not magically or legally binding on either of us. It’s just—it works for us. And it lets us sort a few things together.”
Suddenly he couldn’t breathe, as if there were iron bands around his chest, as if he were pressed hard from all directions—
Draco gave a short, bitter laugh. "Neither. I don't think I could have gotten it up for anyone in sixth year. Not even you."
Harry took a ragged, shaky breath. “I’m not a saint. And I’m not proud of everything I did along the way—but it wasn’t any killer instincts of mine that defeated Voldemort. Quite the opposite.”
The conversation languished a bit. Lucius and Narcissa had insisted on putting off the real purpose of this meeting until after dinner. Harry wasn’t even sure how much they knew. Draco had sent them an owl to arrange this gathering, but he probably hadn’t told them why he wanted to bring Harry.
Harry nodded as he reached for a quill. “Yeah. Might be a bit awkward for me, though. Not staying with Benjamin and Noa, I don’t think, but meeting Shira’s parents. They were hoping that Draco would marry her.”
“Don’t act so surprised. You’re a natural leader, Harry. And Granger is almost as competent as she is self-righteous—not to mention ambitious.”
Potter—no, Harry—pushed away from him and sat up. There was an incredulous look on his face. "Is that the only time I've called you by your given name?"
"No, you gave him a decent game." He paused. "I suppose I should change the wards here so that you can accept owls from your family, yeah?"
She still didn't approve. But since Draco seemed satisfied there wasn't much she could do, apart from making certain that Harry squashed his tyrannical tendencies and Ron remembered that Draco did not actually owe him anything.
But Draco shook his head. “Not that I know of. He didn’t bother with every corner of the mansion. As far as I know, the other Death Eaters left it alone too.”
Harry left Draco alone for a good hour after their little—what should he call it? It didn’t seem serious enough to be a fight. Draco was just being prickly and melodramatic and . . . well, he was just being himself, really.
“Hermione, I know I was wrong. I just . . . I got carried away. And that specific memory had something to do with the reason he doesn’t apparate anymore. Hell, that’s probably what he’s asking Ron. Whether he owes me that memory or not.”
Harry stopped pacing and stared at him. “Are you seriously defending a pure-blood tradition? That's all this arranged marriage is about: keeping up 'pure’ bloodlines.”
He owed him even more now. Weasley, he was certain, would keep the secret Draco had confided. More importantly, his reaction to it filled Draco with relief. Weasley hadn’t looked at him with disgust or even shock. And he wasn’t holding Draco at arm’s length. If anything, Weasley was simply more protective of him.
Fortunately, Shacklebolt had accepted the new arrangements: Harry would land in Newark, where Benjamin and Noa would collect him. They would bring him to their home in a New Jersey suburb, which was, apparently, a short train ride from Manhattan.
Draco tapped his foot, looking as if he'd very much like to cast an Imperious on Harry, so he wouldn't have to bother explaining things. "You'll be staying with Benjamin and Noa. One of them will pick you up at the airport, and Newark is much more convenient than JFK."
"It should feel later. You gained hours, remember? And don't you have a meeting this afternoon? Pull yourself together."
Neither complaint made sense to Ron. The ferret wasn't a slave; he could walk away from this anytime. And life debts weren't just a pure-blood thing, even if pure-bloods had created specific ways to repay them. Granted, lifelong servitude did seem a bit extreme—but Harry and Malfoy's entire history together was extreme.
