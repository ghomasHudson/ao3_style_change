Ron pulled a face before waving his wand. Suddenly the sound around them decreased as if they had left the room. Ron nodded in satisfaction before smiling and speaking again. “We’ve known for a while that there’s been trouble, but I didn’t know about the other bloke until tonight. I’m going to bloody kill her!” His face was serious and grim with anger.
Something soft and deliciously warm landed across his shoulders, instantly calming the painful shivers that had overtaken him. He turned first, then jumped to his feet. He hadn’t heard the door behind him, and yet Malfoy stood over him, hands still open above him where he’d draped his jacket over Harry’s shoulders. He stood, alarmed, feeling his ears burn.
Harry groaned as Draco ran his hands into his hair, holding him tight as their lips caressed and stroked each other.
“Lucasta Lloyd? The Harpies’ Seeker?”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, and Draco could hear the tone of worry in his words.
As they got closer, it was as if the bubble that Ron had cast around them absorbed Luna and Hermione.
Draco halted here, only momentarily, as though his feet had gotten confused between destinations. He resumed his stride towards the kitchen, leaving the drawing-room and the horrors behind.
“Surprisingly, yes, Charlie and Malfoy are good friends now. They’ve worked in the field together for years,”
“Oh, I see,” Luna nodded. “Where is Ginny, by the way? I was looking forward to seeing her,” Luna looked around. Harry looked at Hermione, not knowing what to say.
“And have you ever met either of these women before or know of any reason why they would hold a grudge against you?” A shadow passed across his face at this as his gaze lowered to the quick notes quill scratching behind him.
“I can think of many of the words for Harry.” She smiled kindly as she offered her hand.  He took it and smiled.
“Benvenuto! Welcome to Italy, Harry Potter,” floated a smooth, accented voice from the black. Harry’s head jerked to the right where the voice had come.
“Blaise, stop!” Draco urged, barring his way to the wizard behind the counter.
Draco nodded as he lit his wand and watched as Patrik disappeared back to the houses. He watched as the light of the other wizard’s wand disappeared before turning around. Taking a deep breath he began to walk, his eyes darting everywhere and listening out to the night for signs of dragons. As he approached the cluster of trees, he saw lanterns dancing and swaying through the bracken. He wandered closer until he was at the foot of the jetty. Towards the end, only just visible was what looked like a picnic set out with cushions and blankets. Draco stepped tentatively closer, confusion thrumming around his head.
Harry smiled a genuine smile as he sat back. He loved this family so much. It suddenly dawned on him painfully that technically he was no longer a part of it. No longer being married to Ginny meant he was cast adrift again, not belonging to any family. A momentary feeling of desolate loneliness filled his lungs, and he found it hard to breathe.
“Hi, Yeah, I’m Harry. Good to meet you, Patrik. I’ve heard lots of things about you and what you do here.” He smiled as he offered his hand.
“I’m sure you could, if you truly wanted to, Potter.” He glanced down at their hands again and shook his head. “I can die happy, now that I’ve shaken hands with the chosen one.” Harry grimaced.
The headlines had led to a family meeting. He hadn’t been able to look Molly in the eye for months after, the embarrassment too much. He’d vowed never to do that again. He knew Ted was right.
“What?” They all asked, turning to follow his gaze.
Harry shrugged before answering. “To be fair to the old codger, Gryffindors have caused him the most problems. Between Me, Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron, and then obviously, Uncle Fred and Uncle George, I don’t think he ever got much of a break.”
“Noomi?” He called out before wiping his shoes on the rug.
“It’s not like I had a choice. Hermione, He draped it around me before I knew he was there.”
“Morning,” Harry offered with a smile. “This is early for you. I wasn’t expecting you up until at least ten today; it is Sunday after all.”
“Not appropriate, Blaise!” Draco warned. Blaise had seen it all before. They had shared dorms, after all. One of the reasons that Blaise was as popular as he claimed was because of what he could bring to the bedroom. Draco fought the urge to blush and succeeded.
Harry felt panic rise within him at the pressure from all sides. He shook his head, and Hermione raised her hands in surrender.
“Oh, Harry!” Hermione chided as she pulled out her wand, but Ron beat her to it.
“So, enough about my travel arrangements. How have you spent your birthday today?”
“That’s right,” he nodded carefully.
“She means that he is usually up with the dawn.” he explained
”Yeah, Good luck.” Weasley offered as the lift closed again and pulled away. They stood, sharing a loaded glance as he disappeared from view. As he descended further, finally left alone with his thoughts, he started to worry. If Weasley knew everything from Charlie’s letters, Did Harry? What did he think? If Weasley knew, then, of course, Harry did too. But would that work in his favour? He couldn’t work out whether it was a good thing or not.
Grudgingly, he found he respected this new, mature Weasley with his insightful case comments and questions. Finally, he appeared to have found his footing in life. Pausing in his thoughts, Draco recalled that morning. Weasley looking at him as if he expected better behaviour, and Granger trying her best to be friendly. It was all so guileless, earnest and completely un-Slytherin. His mind darted back to the letter he’d received from Harry and felt his heart make an extra loud beat as a small smile slipped to his lips. Shaking his head to shake those thoughts out, he closed the file. Thinking about Harry was not the way to stay focused, and he needed to concentrate. He slid the file to one side before picking up the witch’s file.
The sun poked through the hazy clouds as they wove their way between the barns and shacks. The largest house sat, which Harry assumed was Patrik’s sat before them, freshly painted in the distinctive terracotta and highlighted with stark, white bannisters marking the decking. The effect was very attractive and simple; Harry liked it. There was some commotion within the barn as they walked passed. Harry turned to look but could see nothing out of the ordinary.
“Come in.”
“Blind? Why have I never heard of this curse?”
“Ministry of Magic, Atrium.”
“I already knew that when I popped the question, remember?”
As he twisted around, Blaise’s flawless ebony skin came into view. Draco honestly thought that if he hadn’t been hexed with the body bind curse, he would have collapsed. He felt tears prickling, unable to blink to keep them back. He watched helplessly as Blaise levitated him to the bed and lowered him down gently. He felt the invisible bindings loosen as his chest was given full movement to pant.
Draco looked away as he buried the memories down. A ritual he returned to time and time again, saving each shard of dreadfulness until he could pick it out of his skin and try to grind it sand. Something smaller, blunter and more manageable. He rubbed his arms against the cold, momentarily wondering what he’d done with his jacket. He paused when he remembered, then buried those thoughts too, for now at least. Fear was natural and familiar to him, something to be confronted. However, his emotions concerning Harry were dangerous bubbles filled with hope; Fragile and beautiful and far too fanciful to be taken seriously. He couldn’t face those yet, not without a fire to burn away the shadows.
When Harry returns to Grimmauld, Malfoy is waiting in the living room, a glass of red wine in hand. He’s lounging on the sofa, an arm propped on the back with his legs sprawled out in front of him. Harry is grateful to see he’s dressed this time, but doesn’t think he’s spared much since Malfoy’s wearing a silky black shirt, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. It’s unbuttoned at the collar to reveal a triangular expanse of skin which is strikingly bright against the dark fabric. To top it off, the shirt is tucked into what has to be the tightest jeans in existence. Harry almost drops the bag of crisps.
And that is how Harry ends up cooking breakfast for Malfoy’s latest hookup, who still hasn’t even introduced himself much beyond, “Over hard, mate, thanks”. (In which case, who bloody likes their eggs over hard?) Well. There’s certainly no accounting for taste—in eggs or blokes, he supposes, taking in the brunette man casually sitting at the table as he cooks. He’s not all that bad looking, really, Harry admits grudgingly, but he also isn’t anything special, either. Harry shakes his head and turns back to the stove, flipping the eggs in the air with ease. They land back on the skillet with a sizzle and Harry just takes it all in for a second. This is his life now. The Saviour of the Wizarding World, reduced to feeding his ex-rival’s paramours with overdone eggs. He sighs.
Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes. “He’s off on his Gay Brunch today.”
“Yeah,” Harry croons, fisting Draco’s cock faster and angling his hips to hit that sweet spot inside him. “Come for me, then, Draco.”
They fill the room with the lewd sounds of skin on skin as he fucks Draco until he’s a babbling mess, speaking solely in moans and whines and cries of Harry’s name. A few ‘Potters’ slip out too, but Harry only wants it all even more, the reminder that this is them—Potter, Malfoy,
“Well. Sounds like Draco’s been having some fun lately.” Ron chuckles.
Draco nods then, still not able to look him in the eye as his incisors bite down on his bottom lip, but Harry isn’t having any of it anymore. He doesn’t want Draco’s silence.
It is far too early in the morning to be plagued by Draco Malfoy, Harry thinks, as he is up and out of bed before the sun has even risen. Harry doesn’t even bother to stop by the loo on his way downstairs. He’s almost entirely certain that if he were to look at his reflection now, he’d find only dead eyes and dark circles looking back.
The past few instances immediately come to mind. He’s spent quite a few nights now lying awake in his bed. The variety of noises next door always keeps him up. Moans, and groans, and what has to be the incessant creaking of Malfoy’s bed, courtesy of Grimmauld’s aged furniture. Harry remembers the flood of embarrassment and then the bite of frustration that had him cursing Malfoy until morning light. He tries to think of a way to convey just how much it affects him, but can’t seem to put it in words.
He can’t respond when he finds Malfoy later in the afternoon, lazing around in the backyard, drinking something cool and refreshing and ostentatiously orange. It’s appropriate for such a blistering day, as are his shorts and worn Bowie tee, but that doesn’t stop Harry’s thoughts heading in less appropriate directions at the sight. Especially when Malfoy lifts the hem to wipe away the sweat beading on his face, exposing the toned expanse of his abdomen.
Ron’s eyebrows shoot up. “I didn’t know you were into that, mate.”
“Too right, Potter.” Malfoy catches his eye over his twinkling glass of wine before taking a swig. The pale stretch of his throat works as he swallows. Harry quickly looks away.
If he has to hear them go for the rest of the night, Harry thinks he might just lose it. He hopes that he’ll at least be put out of his misery this time. Another night of this seems especially cruel with Harry’s recent realizations. Malfoy’s unique brand of torture would succeed in things Voldemort never could and finally end him for good. Maybe he’ll have some peace and quiet then.
Harry stops on his way to the broom shed to stare and ask, “Is that my shirt?” It’s a familiar, faded thing, one of the few left behind in the back of Sirius’s closet.
“Oh, right. Is that where he finds his
. I need—” Draco sobs, and Harry gives it to him.
—but no. There it is again.
After living with him for four years, Harry can admit that Malfoy is not a bad housemate by any means. He keeps their shared spaces orderly, doesn’t spend too long getting ready in the loo in the morning, and is not as much of a git as Harry knows he could be about Harry always managing to leave his socks everywhere. He’s still a git about other things though, of course.
Draco enters the foyer just then, and Harry cannot help but stare. No amount of preparation could have ever prevented it. He is as hopeless as he was in sixth year.
He keeps it slow at first, wanting to give Draco time to adjust before he’s seated fully. Draco moans, long and low at the feeling. Harry watches, mesmerized, as that tight heat takes all of him inside, stretching beautifully around his cock.
“For who?” Harry slows down his wanking, his other hand on Draco’s hip keeping him still. “You’re coming for who?”
“I want to hear you say it.” Harry leans down further, Draco’s erection inches in front of his face as he wanks him, letting out a hot breath close enough for him to feel it.
“You’re a bloody fucking tease, Malfoy,” he growls, flipping them over and tugging off shirts and wrestling with zippers until it’s blissfully only skin on skin left.
“Yeah, Harry.” Ron sobers up a bit. “We’ll listen, even if it is about the ferret having horribly loud sex. Wouldn’t wish that on you—or, well, anyone, really.”
“Have you tried asking him to be quieter?” Hermione asks.
Draco laces their fingers together. “Alright then, but you better take me somewhere nice.”
“I think I’m going mental.” Harry jumps in with no preamble, pulling up a seat beside Ron before sitting down. Ron doesn’t respond, only sliding his pint over to Harry and waiting for him to continue.
At exactly 11:58 pm that Saturday night, as Harry’s Tempus states into the black of his room, Harry finds that he can indeed blame Malfoy—extensively and emphatically. He hasn’t seen Malfoy since the night before, having already left on whatever plans he had when Harry got up that morning. It’s a welcome interlude in the continuing trial of Harry’s newfound attraction, but it abandons him with too much opportunity to do nothing but mull over everything.
Harry rubs the head of Draco’s cock, thumbing the slit. Beads of pre-come make it slick and he swipes a taste onto his tongue before continuing his tease. “Gonna put on a show for me then? You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Draco?”
A single word, spoken with the barest of breaths, but it leaves Harry arrested. His name on Draco’s lips simultaneously holds only two syllables and the entirety of the history between them. The pad of Harry’s thumb presses down on Draco’s bottom lip, and his tongue darts out to wet it. No longer able to resist, Harry leans in to ghost his lips over his cheek, his jaw, further.
Harry is just about ready for bed, when it happens again. It almost comes as a surprise because Harry was so preoccupied with not seeing Malfoy that he had forgotten what that usually meant. You’d think he’d be used to the routine by now, Harry muses, as a moan sounds through the wall. Harry turns his head towards the ceiling and closes his eyes, sighing sharply through his nose. He tries to gather his strength, knowing he’ll be needing it again tonight.
Draco turned and let out a breath, counting to ten as he closed his eyes. The chances of Potter owning this shop was slim. He was sure he would have heard about it from someone. Also, the saviour was rich and famous, without any real need to work for a living. He shook his head as he disregarded his feelings. The likeness must have been just a play in the light. Or wishful thinking, his mind supplied treacherously.
“Shush!”
“So, is there anything else to do in preparation for the conference?” He asked. If he could keep his mind on work, he could stop the blushing and the embarrassment that threatened to send him back to bed to hide for the rest of the day.
“You are all going to be the end of me,” He groaned as he walked in, hearing the portrait close behind him.
What did a bunch of Gryffindor’s even do at parties? He couldn’t imagine the Weasleys holding cocktail parties and eating hors d’oeuvres. But, of course, that’s very much what his own parents would have done at New Year. The fire would be roaring, and the Christmas decorations would be placed tastefully around the manor. The pièce de résistance would be the enormous tree in the hall, twinkling with fairy’s and filled at the base with shiny packages and hand-wrapped gifts.
“Focus.” He replied.
He wandered through, expecting to see Harry, but Noomi was alone, her feet propped up on one of the other chairs.
Draco only had time to nod before the cold rush encased him. The mediwitch managed to manoeuvre a container to catch everything before it was too late. He felt so ashamed and pathetic as his head thumped with pressure. It would be a long time before he ordered the Caprese salad again.
“Where is Ron?”  Harry asked, his adrenaline spiking.
“I’ll leave you two alone for a minute; I could do with a coffee. Anyone want anything?” Blaise asked. Draco opened one eye to scowl at him as he walked towards the door.
“What about Zabini? Isn’t he expecting you back?”
“Yeah, It’s me and Ron Weasley.” Blaise continued.
“I told you, Romilda’s child isn’t mine!” Harry almost shouted.
“Yep. Happy birthday, love!” He replied as they stepped back and looked at each other.
“Ow!” He muttered, rubbing his leg.
“What? Reckless children with a cavalier attitude and bad hair?” Draco teased.
“Halt, who goes there?” Cried Sir Cadogan as he finally stood in his armour.
He looked back at the letter before he refolded it and tucked it into his jacket pocket. His stomach growled, reminding him that lunch was ready. He stood and left, the letter virtually forgotten.
Draco watched in curiosity before he continued. “I went along as part of a Cherokee study group. The main aim was to study their mating habits, protect their habitat, and assess their population stability. Unfortunately, deforestation and Muggle habitation has shrunk their territory considerably.” Rolf nodded eagerly as he waited for more.
Gone was the chubby boy of their youth. Neville was now almost as tall as Ron but not as thin, His shoulders broader and thicker from working in the greenhouses. It was hard to deny that Neville had really grown into a handsome man. The only thing that hadn’t developed so well was his self-esteem. He was still the unsure boy he remembered, nervous to touch or do anything for fear of messing things up.
“You sure you’re alright Moon? That was a bad fall.”
“Draco!” She chided gently as she twisted around to see him better.
He and Ginny had sat in silence, she in her nightgown, the collar gaping, revealing her generous cleavage. Harry felt empty as he looked at her, not sure what to say or do. The divorce had been her suggestion after the silence had grown too heavy between them. He had just nodded, feeling relief. Relief at what? He wasn’t sure but as though something tortuous was finally over.
“What?” Draco asked
Fear and anger raged through him, his ears filling with a thick and deafening buzz, like millions of agitated hornets.
“If she attacked without provocation, then that’s at least a six months suspended sentence and a fine,” Hermione advised thoughtfully. “I can’t believe he was just assaulted, especially after so many years.”
Harry read and reread over the letter, ensuring that it flowed nicely and that his spelling and punctuation were correct. He wondered whether it was too forward and friendly, considering that they’d only managed to have that amiable conversation at the reunion. Finally, he decided that he didn’t care. Malfoy would have to like it or lump it. If he had bloody replied to the first one, he wouldn’t have to put up with stupidly insecure letters.
“It’s stunning, have you always cared for dragons here?” Harry asked before taking another spoonful of porridge.
“Ron! You’re dreadful!” Said Hermione, but they both ignored her.
“He’d be running back to Molly quicker than you could say, Woollongong Shimmy,” She smiled. Harry snorted, almost causing fire whiskey to come out of his nose. He spluttered, feeling the liquor burn his oesophagus.
Draco looked at him, still waiting for a hint of humour or smugness as he stood in the doorway. However, Weasley was remaining the consummate professional. It was that more than anything that made him nod in agreement.
“Don’t give her a hard time,” Harry said, “Probably wasn’t easy living with me and like you said, we’ve not been happy for a while, so…” Harry said as he knocked back the first of his new whiskeys. “I’m surprised it took as long as it did for her to find someone else.” Harry gazed into the bottom of the glass as he felt the bitter taste and the burn as it went down
“He was the worst apprentice!” She laughed. It took him five of the years to learn what most learn in three.” They all laughed now as Patrick rolled his eyes again. “But he kept coming back. My Far thought that he only came back to impress me and thought he was better at the role than he was. I think that was the only reason he agreed to the wedding” She raised her eyebrow as she smirked at Patrik. He grinned back.
Harry jumped as he realised what he was still wearing. He felt his cheeks begin to burn as he looked down at the dark dress blazer that adorned his shoulders. The intoxicating scent filled his nostrils, spicy and sweet.
Around this time, Romilda began telling tales about his poor performance in lack-lustre trists. Soon after, she announced that she was carrying his child. Ginny had left to stay at the training grounds for a week after that headline, leaving Harry to deal with the howlers about his refusal to pay child support. After the birth, pictures of the child were published, and it was clear from the pale, blond hair that the child wasn’t Harry’s.
He grinned as he pulled Draco closer again. “Good surprise?” He asked tentatively.
The tinsel was bad enough, but the metallic concertina decorations leading from every corner to the lampshade in the centre was too much. Its gold and green metallic shine made the red bedroom look like the same monster had then decided to throw up. He closed his eyes and rubbed them with his fingers, pushing his glasses down in the process. Maybe that was the answer to his sanity; he’d just have to remove his glasses until the new year came and they could put all this festive rubbish in the bin.
“He knows where I am,” He replied with a smile and a nod, “Goodnight, Harry.” Malfoy pushed his hands into his pockets and silently walked into the night.
Harry listened intently, knowing how it felt to be frozen to your broom. He thought for a moment about his extraction from four Privet Drive and his agonising flight on his broom.
“Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Sir.” He responded
“That surprises me. Of all the commendations, Ms Dalca’s is the most complimentary of both your work ethic and your methods. She speaks extremely highly of you.”
“I’ll be coming too. The Auror’s need a statement.”
“I had thought you’d forgotten what day it was,” he said with a smirk. “No, nothing’s come yet, but I think the owls haven’t arrived yet.” Draco looked around as if expecting the owls to appear at their mere mention.
“World domination?” He laughed with a shake of his head. “Not for me!” He stood up and carried his bowl and spoon to the sink, where he washed it by hand. He left it in the drainer before turning back to Noomi, who had a thoughtful expression on her face. “Are you alright?”
The first platter was a platter of baby potatoes, but mixed in were bright yellow daylilies, carrots, and a green stalk-like vegetable which Harry suspected was samphire. He knew that samphire usually accompanied fish, so he wasn’t at all surprised when the following platter revealed pickled herring sprinkled with red onions and herbs.
“An old witch who was dining in the same place, you know that ‘Tre e Viverna’?”
Harry smiled as he thought of Hermione and S.P.E.W. He had talked with Kreacher about the prospect of freedom which hadn’t been taken well. The tiny elf had cried and sobbed against the prospect of Harry releasing him from his servitude. The thought, too much for the wizened little elf. Harry had managed to find a way around it which both he and Kreacher found agreeable. Every week, Harry would give Kreacher a Knut as wages, and the house-elf stashed the money in a small metal tin that looked older than Kreacher himself.
“Who?” The deep male voice lied.
He couldn’t help feeling an overwhelming wave of unease as he stared hard at the fireplace; His nerves squirming like worms in his gut. He tapped his pocket and felt reassured by the glass vial that lay there as a safety net. If it all got too much for him, he’d be able to remain calm and hopefully fight off any panic attacks before they got out of hand.
He closed his eyes, the truth stinging more poignantly because his godson was bringing it up. He’d struggled with the news that they couldn’t have children and had resorted to drinking to numb the pain. He’d never become addicted but often walked around intoxicated, only to blur the harsh realities of life. It hadn’t been noticeable until someone had reported it in the Prophet, how a co-worker had smelt the scent on his breath and someone else had seen him with a hipflask. The press had followed each family member to get more information. Ron had to be taken off an important assignment as he was recognised and hounded. The press overran the Weasley’s shop, almost causing a fragile George to relapse into his own darkness, and Ginny had been ambushed as she left training.
He looked up at the stars and smiled. They were the same stars that he’d been able to see from Sweden, and it made him feel better knowing that both he and Draco were being watched over by the same sky. It made him feel slightly closer to home.
Draco sat up, avoiding Weasley’s stare as he cuddled his knees up to his chest. He knew it was a defensive gesture but didn’t care enough to hide it.
“Right, Welch, Michaels & Nott.” He handed out the papers, trying not to stare at the dark-haired boy who looked so much like his mother. “Good work, Nott” He nodded as the child bobbed his head and returned to the back of the class. His mind often wondered about the boy now that Pansy has been arrested. Part of him felt guilty having anything to do with it, but he would do it all again if It meant that Draco was safe.
“What about your last whiskey, mate?” asked Ron. Harry smiled and knocked it back, feeling the burning sensation as the fire coated his insides satisfyingly.
“In about two weeks,” He said quietly.
“What if he blabs to the Prophet? Or tells Harry?”
The muggle couple who had vanished had been hikers. Mr and Mrs Kilbride from Invergarry had last been seen by their neighbour, Mrs Barrisdale, as they left for a long weekend hiking. Something that they were known for in their small village. He scanned the rest of the report noting that the last place they’d been spotted had been in Broadford. Whilst there, they had purchased a few essentials like water and teabags before stopping for dinner. From there, he presumed they travelled further north and disappeared. His mind flitted through creatures native to Scotland. There was the Blue Men of the Minch, but they were mostly found out at sea, not coasts or Loch. If it had anything to do with the Hebridean dragons, the MacFusty’s would have reported and dealt with it. It was probably a Will-o’-the-wisp or the Sithchean fairies playing pranks by guiding them from their path. But that didn’t explain why no one had discovered their remains, especially after a muggle police investigation.
“Ron and Hermione bought me a glass, dragon chessboard,” Draco said with a smile.
“Thanks,” Harry replied as he felt the warmth rush through him as though submerged in warm water, his sore jaw loosening as the subtle shivering stopped. He looked at Malfoy, assessing him. He noticed the paleness of him even against the stony backdrop. He had grown into his points and angles and had gained confidence he hadn’t had when they were children. A prick of sadness spoked at him, knowing that it was too good to be true. “So, where is Mrs Malfoy?” He asked, looking down at his shoes.
“Are you alright?” He asked quietly so others around the compound didn’t overhear. Noomi nodded as she waddled by his side.
“It took me a long time to realise that some people could do that; Help people without expecting a reward. I never understood that people were capable of such compassion.” Malfoy looked at him with such intensity that Harry wanted to look away. There was such a rawness in the gaze that he felt transfixed. “I don’t think you realise how rare that sort of kindness has been in my life” Malfoy looked at him again. There was something in his eyes that Harry couldn’t quite put into words, a vulnerable but determined look. It was a look he didn’t think he had ever imagined seeing on his face. The blond opened his mouth as if to say more but decided against it and closed it again.
Blaise and Weasley laughed as the redhead left the room. Then, before his head completely disappeared, he called back, “I’ll tell Harry you were here. He’ll probably be in touch soon to return your jacket anyway. Take care of yourself, Malfoy,” he waved and was gone.
“I’m planning the whole thing. If you think I’m skimping on anything I want, you don’t know me very well.” They both chuckled before Draco carried on “If we did a huge wedding next year, what would be different?” Draco asked, trying to ignore his nerves.
Malfoy looked at him steadily, his face sober and serious. “It is nice, indeed,” he said softly. He seemed to ponder something for a moment before opening his mouth again. Harry waited for the cutting remark and the sneer. “Thank you, Harry.”
“Maybe.” Teddy grinned as he waved his wand to summon the biscuit tin.
“Something like that, yes.”
“I’m just worried about History of Magic; I just can’t remember all the dates!” Lucy complained.
“I hear you two got married. Congratulations.” He offered weakly. Small talk had never been a strength.
“You’ve done this before,” Rolf said from behind him.
“So loyal to the ones you love, that surprises me, Mr Potter, with an upbringing like yours. It would be so easy to leave people by the wayside.” The footsteps sloshed. “But no matter, he is… nearby, after a fashion.”
I, stupidly, only recently realised that you and my Godson Teddy Lupin are related after telling him that I would be owling you. Yes, I know! I’m a stupid Gryffindor… Stop rolling your eyes! Ted showed me some of the postcards you’d sent him. Is there anywhere on this planet you’ve not been to yet? It’s ridiculous, and I am incredibly jealous! Since the war ended, I haven’t travelled further than the channel.
He felt around for his glasses before pushing them on, feeling the familiar relief of being able to see again. The room looked like a colour-blind house-elf had stolen all the discarded 80’s decorations and had distributed them unevenly throughout the lower floors of his house. It gave him a headache to look at it all. He could’ve sworn that Ted hadn’t put up quite so much the day before, but then his mind had been elsewhere.
“Divorce,” Ron shouted back. “Come on, mate! Mione may be the smartest witch of our age, but she’s a rubbish liar,” He snorted. “How are you coping?” Harry sat dumbstruck but comforted to know that his best friends knew.
Harry didn’t know what to say. He realised that he hadn’t told anyone or confided in anyone about any of it. He knew it was because he couldn’t bear to see peoples reactions; the sympathy and interest, or worse, the people who’d pretend they’d known it wouldn’t last.
Draco had found that since the war, sleep was a mixed blessing. It sped up time and removed you from the world, but the world it trapped you in was very rarely nicer. Dreams haunted Draco, visions of snakes and skulls and shadows dancing along the walls. However, tonight snow and ravens appeared accompanied by emeralds and the scent of honey. There were worse dreams
The kettle boiled, rousing him from his thoughts and back into the dreary Islington kitchen. He heard a bang and scuffle from upstairs and smiled. He’d almost forgot that it was the Christmas holidays at Hogwarts with everything that had been going on. Again, he smiled as he heard the heavy stomping that could only belong to a teenage boy.
“Why has mother sent a card this year?”
Draco remembered a time when he’d looked at his ancestral home with pride and love, where every nook and cranny showed his family’s superiority and power. Now all he saw was the shell of a house filled with horrors. Black windows, gaping in silent screams as if shrieking at the atrocities they’d witnessed. Draco pushed that thought away as images came unbidden to his mind. He gritted his teeth, squeezing his fists so tightly that the blood began to pound, and his nails bit into his skin. The pain helped, as it always did. The pain grounded him and kept him in the present, both a blessing and a curse.
“Steady on, mate!” remarked Ron with a laugh.
“What?” Asked Harry nervously.
“I wish you weren’t going,” Draco whispered as they broke away, still clinging to each other.
Harry smiled back and nodded. It would be her style to slip in some Amortentia into it if no one was looking; she did have form for it, after all.
“Yeah, he told us you’d leant it to him,” Ron looked back to him, his pale blue eyes boring into Draco, and he knew the redhead was fishing for information, even if his tone was light.
The hospital was a blur as people and voices seemed to float around him, their voices disembodied and distorted. Being unable to focus on anything made his churning stomach roll uneasily, and he was relieved when they were finally alone in a quiet room.
“Looks like the Somnus delorum hex,” someone muttered
Harry arched an eyebrow as he too, stood. He belatedly realised that standing brought them closer together. Their cloudy breaths mingled in the cold night air as they stood face to face. He had never realised before that Malfoy was taller, which brought his eyes level with the other man’s lips. An unfortunate height when all he could seem to think of was how soft they looked. He found himself staring at them for longer than was polite as he tore his eyes up to Malfoy’s steely grey ones.
“You must be Harry. I am Patrik” He smiled, and Harry noted that he was indeed good looking. His pale eyes were the palest blue he had ever seen, like a glacier. His sandy hair was also so fair that it was almost grey with light red threaded through giving it a warm hue. His skin was tanned and had a fine dusting of freckles; he reminded him of Ginny.
Anyway, good luck at work today. I’m sure you’ll impress Rolf with your knowledge and skills.
Despite all the noise and mayhem, he’d been left alone to his thoughts. Some of the older kids had talked to him, the ones he hadn’t seen since the summer. But Molly, Ron or Hermione shooed them off or distracted them before the answers could become too difficult. He could see it in their eyes, the watchful vigilance, like his own private guardians. All, he assumed, thought his silence was due to the divorce.
Draco said nothing for a little while. It was always like this with Harry, and sometimes it made it difficult to bear. Draco’s cold and aloof upbringing, while full of love, was never as brazen and bold as this. He swallowed as he tried to accept all the was offered. His mind healer had told him that he deserved this. He closed his eyes as he concentrated on the sensations of Harry at his back, and the warmth he provided, the uncomfortable and raw sensations lifting to disperse into nothingness like smoke on the air.
“You’re welcome, Pumpkin!” Harry looked around the room, the flames licking at his throat. “Have you already opened my presents?”
Noomi paused for a second as she thought back. She shook her head. “I don’t think so.” Her face broke out into a smile. “I think you have dominated the world with your talk of dragons.”
Draco raised a disbelieving eyebrow but chose to say nothing. He had to admit, except for the desserts, it sounded relatively healthy.
It was almost certainly his fault that her eyes had wandered. Since leaving school, he had lost all his ambition and drive; he had tried joining the Auror’s only to drop out a few months through the training. He had taken her for granted, and Ginny was not one to sit back and take it. In contrast, she had become even more vivacious and adventurous after joining the Holyhead Harpies as their first chaser. Training and matches had broadened her horizons far beyond being ‘just’ unhappy Mrs Potter.
“Draco Malfoy’s”, Ron replied, casting Neville a loaded glance. Neville’s eyes widened in surprise.
“She told me about the divorce,” She said carefully. “Are you sure that there’s nothing left worth saving?” She asked, her voice careful.
“When am I?” He asked with a smirk before taking another deep bite from the apple. He sat and chewed the apple for a few moments before gesturing to Draco. “So?” He drawled with a grin.
The sky was beginning to lighten in the east when they decided that they had better make their way to bed. The moon, which had been peeking over the horizon when they’d started was high overhead as they stumbled back to Draco’s hut. They quietly giggled as Draco fumbled with the lock as Harry teased and tickled. As soon as they were through the door, they fought with their clothes before climbing into the bed. Draco pushed himself under the bedclothes first, holding them open for Harry who, after removing his glasses, climbed in. Within seconds of the covers covering them, their limbs entwined and their lips pressed against each other.
Draco nodded and started to explain the series of events up until the hex hit him. Blaise took over from there, and Draco listened on intently as the other events became apparent.
“I’m glad you like it, Love” He smiled. “Now, I really must go, the bells have started to ring for lessons.” He smiled warmly at Draco causing his heart to start beating again “I love you, Pumpkin,”
The restaurant seemed surprisingly quiet for a Saturday the week before Christmas. Draco suspected that some still held grudges against Goblin-owned businesses even though they had been banking with goblins for generations.
“Never thought I’d say it, but yes. Surprisingly, I have actually missed the place. Nowhere I’ve visited feels quite like Hogwarts.” Malfoy smiled wistfully as he gazed back at the large front door. Harry watched his face, realising he had never seen that smile before.
“Dad will be out in a minute,” He said before disappearing back out of sight.
“Wrakspurts? I’m unfamiliar with that term.”
“Thanks, It’s really thanks to Gran and Pansy’s Mum, Calliope. They organised almost everything between them,”
Pulling out his wand, he levitated a satanic looking snowman and a moth-eaten stocking and sent them flying into the fire. Then, watching with a sense of satisfaction as they melted and bubbled, he deserved the resulting smoke and smell of burning plastic as he rushed, coughing and spluttering, to open every window he could find in an attempt the drive off the fumes.
“Nothing. All the Ministers are apparating on Monday morning. This week, the ministers from China, Japan, North and South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, and Vietnam, Malaysia and Myanmar. I think Russia and Mongolia may also apparate in. We will have to wait and see.”
Momentarily arguing with himself, he signed. He resigned himself to breaking whatever etiquette there was in sending another letter so soon after the first. He accio’d his inkwell and quill and waited for inspiration to hit. It didn’t take as long as before for words to flow as his quill sped across the page.
“I asked Shacklebolt.” He said coolly.
“I’ll show you to come with me.”
“Malfoy? Working at the Ministry?” Ron laughed suddenly.
If you have any other questions, please feel free to comment and ask :)
“He was fine last time I heard.”
“People don’t normally insult people when they’re conversing in my experience.” Harry waited, not wanting to look around to see if Malfoy waited. After a few silent seconds, he turned to see him motionless and looking at him—a look of surprise on his face, which was soon erased by the mask.
“Anything, my sweet?” He asked the cat, ignoring the portrait. The cat meowed quietly before winding herself around his feet. He sighed as he turned around to head back to his perch. “Better luck tomorrow, my pet,” He muttered as he disappeared from view. Harry waited a few more minutes before returning to his office.
Draco began ripping at the paper before a small clear box appeared. Within it sat a golden snitch, its wings wrapped around its small golden body.
He sighed, glancing out of the window at the London weather, watching as the rain bounced off the patio slabs. He shook his head and removed his glasses, rubbing his eyes firmly until white dots appeared behind his eyelids. Why was a white piece of parchment so intimidating?
Draco nodded again but fortunately was saved from answering when the doors clanged open.
“Kreacher?” Harry called, “Have we had any post today?”
“I imagine that you’re overwhelmed with plans for Christmas this year, but if you could spare us an hour… I know Luna thinks of you as a brother and would love to spend Christmas with family, especially as we lost her father last year.” His face fell at the memory of the loss.
“I know, but it’s disgusting.” Rose pulled a face. “Fred does the same at school.”
”Glad to see you didn’t kill each other. Then again, I guess we are in the best place if you change your minds, ”
One of the witches spat on the floor as they walked past, the spittal landing on Draco’s boot. Blaise paused and turned, releasing Draco to turn to the women.
“No, my all means, we can arrange that dinner on the way, if you would like to join us?” Draco smiled and nodded, wondering just how he was going to get out of it. He liked Luna; she had been a welcome friend in the years since the war. She also wrote more regularly than Blaise. However, he also knew that she could be the most eccentric and outlandish person whilst being the most astute with her observations.
“Here, drink this,” said the mediwitch from his right. He held his hand out to grab the bottle and felt her press it into his hands. He knocked it back and closed his eyes as the potion took effect. His vision returned painfully slowly as he willed the world back into focus.
“Potter, of course, What happened?”
Noomi laughed back and after a moment looked back at Harry.
“I can tell you that your bride will be absolutely stunning. That your first dance will bring tears to your eyes and that we’ll be leaving in style.”
“My apologies for shouting. I promised myself I wouldn’t. But I need you to understand just what you have done for myself and my family. You always did drive me crazy with how oblivious you can!” He shook his head again and laughed. “Thank you, though. Thank you for what you did. It’s not been easy for me to say this. Half of me hoped you would be here tonight to give me this opportunity. To say, thank you.” His eyes glistened in the darkness; snow had started to fall steadily around them in big fluffy flakes.
“I’ll see what I can arrange.” He grinned again as he looked around the kitchen. “So, when you invited me round for tea, this was not the reception I had in mind.”
“Revelio,” he said as he waved his wand over the jacket. When nothing happened, they all let out a sigh of relief.
Draco nodded slowly, wondering why he wasn’t able to form a complete sentence. Two pairs of hands pulled him up into a sitting position before leaning him against something.
“It is no trouble. Draco has been coming here for years, and by the sounds of things, we have you to thank for it” Patrik said as he sat back down and took a sip of his tea.
Draco looked back to the open door before facing the concern in Blaise’s dark eyes. Draco didn’t know how to explain what the problem was.
“Here and there, I’ve travelled quite a lot.” He looked down at his hands and seemed almost nervous.
“Harry.” Hermione chided again from Ron’s side. Harry rolled his eyes as Ron continued.
“I’ve heard divorce is a bitch" he patted Harry on the arm as Harry fell back, shocked.
Draco sat on the bed for a moment as he remembered that snippet of his life. If he lost all of the memories of his life since Hogwarts, if he could keep that one, he would die happy. Then, after realising that he was sat there, staring far into space, he stood and forced himself to put on his shoes. He ran a comb through his hair, relieved that he could just pull it back into a ponytail, something he should have done years ago.
Draco nodded, and the silence returned to the lift until Granger took a deep breath and turned around, the confused look back on her face.
“I’m not sure. Harry loves to cook. I only just thought about it.”
“Just as well, because I don’t have any!”
Blaise whistled in amazement, his eyes wide and bright. “So you went out there and talked about family? I take it that it was a short conversation? Not being funny, but between the pair of you, you’ve got no family left.” He shrugged. “Sorry to be brutal,” He added as an afterthought when Draco glared at him but without any true malice. He was used to Blaise’s ruthless honesty.
With that thought, he considered whether voluntary disappearance could be a possibility. He would have to look into her life, too; maybe there was an abusive husband or an overbearing family member. But, on the other hand, perhaps she was protecting her family from goblins to whom she owed money. He scribbled the thoughts into his muggle notebook before looking at the auror reports. He was surprised to see a complete and detailed report for the muggles but then realised that it was a copy of the muggle police report.
He cut that train of thought off. It was no good to dwell on things like that; it would only make him feel more lonely and pathetic.
“He’s right, Harry. Did you know almost all the members of the DA survived the war?” Ron insisted
“Must be nice to have the freedom,” Harry replied bitterly. He closed his eyes, immediately regretting the comment. He knew, without a doubt, that he was not in the right frame of mind for this conversation. He glanced at Malfoy and saw the surprised look on his face. Harry sighed and closed his eyes again. He’d not meant to reference the war or the trials.  It was an unwritten rule, but he had accidentally broken it. He had wanted to go travelling so many times, but Ginny’s schedule hadn’t allowed for it. In all his years, the only travelling he had ever done had been when he’d fled to find Horcruxes. He rubbed his face tiredly. “Sorry, I didn’t-“
It took less than a second for Draco to realise that he was no longer alone in the kitchen. He saw a shadow move to disrupt the morning light coming through the high windows. Ice flooded Draco’s veins as blind panic overloaded every nerve. He shot up and bolted for the door. Like a wild animal cornered, he ran sightlessly before he heard the crack of the curse. He had nearly made it to the door when his body stopped, arms snapping to his sides. He wobbled as his legs snapped together, and he waited for the impact on his face. Nothing happened. He opened his eyes and found himself floating above the ground, unable to move his eyes to look around. His heart continued to thunder in his chest as he fought to gain breath. He was back.
“I’m getting married, but I don’t know much about the details of the day, we’re going on a month-long honeymoon, but I don’t know where to. Is there anything you’re willing to tell me about our special day?” He laughed as Draco moved to reach for some more food.
He remembered the sweet spot just after all the trial had ruled and the tributes paid when everything seemed to quieten down. The wizarding world had grown weary of seeing their young and innocent faces plastered in the headlines. The great Harry Potter had managed to disappear for a few months as reforms at the ministry took precedent. However, as people rebounded and news slowed down, journalists began following him, snapping photos as he tried to rebuild his life. It had started with speculations about his career choices, which had flared up when he quit the Auror corps. Then Romilda, sensing an opportunity, submitted her first article, which slowly became a series. First, it was details about chaste clandestine meetings they had shared on the grounds at Hogwarts. Then to sordid details about passionate nights they had apparently spent together.
When I testified for your family, I had hoped that my testimony would cut you some slack after the war. But, obviously, not as much as I would have liked. So, for that, I’m sorry.
“Uncle, I warn you. I’m going to sound like Hermione now. You can be so dense.”
“Well, she spent Saturday night locked in one of the holding cells screeching like a banshee about civil rights and how the death eater should have been in there instead. Auror brutality and all that, I’m sure you can imagine. Although, her language was more… colour than you’d expect from an old lady. Bloody hell, she made Seamus blush!”
“All in a day’s work, eh Potter? I can imagine you writing out your to-do list. Do laundry, get milk, save bully from… prison, make dinner,” He listed with a stutter and a shake of his head. He sounded angry now. “You don’t understand, do you?” Malfoy shouted. “No one else came forward to defend us! None of Mother’s society friends, nor any of my Father’s contacts at the ministry. The Malfoys were an embarrassment that they wanted to bury and forget like a dirty secret. You saved our lives, Potter!” He was shouting the last in exasperation now.
Harry nodded as he stood. He bent to grab his bowl, but it was whisked away as if taken by a gust of wind. He snorted as he saw Noomi grin at him, her wand out.
There were a few glances in his directions but so far, nothing too monstrous. He’d taken no more than a handful of steps when he began to hear disgruntled murmurings behind him. Mutterings and bitten off curses cascaded around him as they all neared the golden cages. He felt his anxiety rise but kept his head down and pretended not to hear them. Instead, he kept his gaze forward as though the lifts were his lifeline.
“You were right,” Draco said with a slow, appreciative nod as he admired the intensity of the wine through the imperfect goblin-made glass.
“So come on, how did you get here? This place is unplottable, so I know you didn’t just make a lucky guess.”
“He shook my hand,” Draco offered as he stared off into the room.
“Should be ashamed.” One of the older women shouted.
“Mum will be pleased when I tell her,” Weasley replied, clearly not believing the reply. He opened his mouth but closed it again.
“Thank you, Master. Master is very kind.”
“I’ve got Malfoy’s jacket, and I’m just trying to return it,” Harry muttered, leaving out the other details.
“Right, the plan is, you guys hide in the alcove here,” He pointed to the map around the corner from where Filch was sat immobile. “When you hear Filch leave, you all get back into your common room. And I don’t want you doing this again!” he warned.
“Because this is your thirty-fifth summer, Master.” Draco waited for more, looking at the papery grey skin and saucer-like eyes of his family’s house-elf.
“About the role, Sir. What is it I’m here to accomplish? The letter was rather vague.”
Draco looked at him, speechless at his arrival.
Harry smiled and nodded.
“Left? He mentioned that he’d been travelling,”
His body spasmed again as the frozen air suddenly gusted across his shoulders. He sped up the path, huddling in upon himself to shelter from the cold. He barely spared a glance for the dead plants and decaying outbuildings he knew to be there. He grimaced in shame as he briefly remembered all the summers where the place had been green and lively, the air buzzing with pollinators, the flowers enticed them onward. White peacocks had once roamed the grounds, their splayed feathers looking like a blinding starburst, but that was before...
Draco scowled but racked his brain.
—” He arches up, chest pressing firm against Harry’s, and breathes out into Harry’s ear, “
Ginny was here
Officially, it was a spare bit of parchment with Things For Potter Not To Forget written at the top, in all capitals and underlined, that was spelled to update with weekly reminders. Malfoy had proposed the list a year into living with each other, after a few too many times he’d been the only thing keeping Harry from missing an important date. It started as a way to keep Harry grounded during the hazy period immediately after the war, when his grief was so consuming that he’d been unable to tell each day from the next. At first, it kept track of upcoming ministry events, Molly’s birthday, and the anniversary of The Battle of Hogwarts.
“This is really getting obnoxious, Draco.”
Harry makes a face which Hermione takes as her answer. She rolls her eyes at him and huffs, fixing him with a stern look. “If this is making you as miserable as you seem, Harry, it’s worth a try. You’ve been living together for years, surely you can communicate like
When Harry heads downstairs, he finds Malfoy already in the kitchen, leaning against the counter with the tea cabinet door hanging open above him precariously close to his head. The days when Malfoy is up before Harry, Malfoy likes to brew them both a morning cuppa. He’s already finished his, the magical dragon mug, that Harry gave him for his birthday, sitting empty beside Harry’s favourite antler mug on the counter. The little dragon on the ceramic is asleep, puffing out small clouds of smoke into the starry sky above him.
It doesn’t take long at all. The other shoe drops almost immediately after Harry walks into the pub and spots Hermione and Ron sitting at a table.
, which makes it duly out of my jurisdiction.”
Exasperated, Harry exclaims, “I bloody well hope not. This was the second time this week! And just yesterday, not only did I have to hear everything they did the entire night, but when I got to the kitchen in the morning, Malfoy’s
Seeker Game Wins: Potter 30 / Malfoy 31 (suck it)
He wonders if he’s made a mistake, however, when he reaches the ground floor. Standing awkwardly at the foot of the landing, blocking both the foyer and the hallway to the next set of stairs, is the bloke who had to have been Draco’s latest attempt on Harry’s life. Harry slept so well, he had forgotten about the other man until he’s right in front of him. They really do need to stop meeting like this, he thinks, taking just a moment to mourn the morning cuppa that the bloke is firmly blocking him from reaching.
It’s unmistakable now; Malfoy’s moans sound heavy in the emptiness of Harry’s room. It’s a sweet, lilting thing, striking goosebumps on his skin at the dulcet tone.
Raising his arms in surrender, Ron says, “Hey, no need for that, mate, it’s Draco who’s guilty here. Wait, was it Ginny or I that was your favourite?”
Though, as the years went on and they both slowly healed, it had become more of a way for Malfoy to pester him about whose turn it is to pick up the groceries and who’s winning in their ongoing Seeker’s game. Now, the list is pinned on the fridge under the matching Holyhead Harpies magnets that Ginny gifted them two Christmases ago. Harry passes it as he enters the kitchen to look for his wallet. It reads:
“Well, don’t just stand there,” Malfoy says, mildly. “Put those away and pass me my snacks, would you.”
Harry tries to imagine what the shape of his name would be like in Malfoy’s lazy drawl, but the sound of others arriving through the floo draws him from his thoughts. Malfoy goes to greet them, and leads Ginny and Neville off to where the drinks are kept with a dramatic whirl that has Harry’s eyes trailing his back.
“Is what she gave me lube too?” Harry asks, resigned to their antics.
Ron pulls a face before laughing and throwing an arm around Harry’s shoulder, slapping his back in greeting. “You know, ferret, mate, I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that. Although, you do still call Harry ‘
“Is that—?” His eyes dart up to Draco’s shooting him an incredulous look. “Your regular order at Luna’s is
Draco moans first, a low, pleading sound, before he breathes out, “Yes. Yes, Harry.
Malfoy looks away and huffs. Harry is reminded of the little dragon. “Potter, I’ll kindly ask you to not mess up my hair, thank you. We already have a resident bird’s nest.” He fixes his hair gingerly, a faint flush on his cheeks that Harry blames on the tea.
Potter, you left your wallet on the table. Again.
“Can I ask you on that date now?” Harry asks, a hand stroking through his hair.
And when Draco, head falling bonelessly on Harry’s shoulder, moans his name, it’s finally,
He sighs, leaning his head into one hand. “I know, I know. And I’m not miserable, really. Or even angry. It’s not like I have an issue with him having people over. He lives there too, he should be comfortable.” Harry shuffles uncomfortably in his seat. “He’s just…very loud about it. Consistently loud, actually. It’s just. Really,
Draco looks deeply amused, and Harry wishes he could actually be annoyed at the wanker, but he can’t help the rush of warmth at the sight of Draco’s wide, unguarded smile. Harry wants to swallow it down. So he does, along with every little sound he makes afterwards, pushing Draco back down onto the bed.
Strolling through the snack aisle in Tesco, Harry packs his trolley full of the crisps he knows Malfoy likes and a few extras for the party just for good measure. He’s still undecided about whether he is baffled or amused by Malfoy’s insistence on pretending he has no idea what crisps are. When he first introduced them to Malfoy, during eighth year, they had sat on the floor of the common room, passing between them the bag and their stories in turn. For Malfoy, it was his father, sixth year, and the Dark Lord. And for Harry: the Dursleys, Sirius, and the Forbidden Forest.
They stare at each other in silence for a moment.
“Crisps,” Harry mutters under his breath, then swears. The guests are going to arrive in an hour, and he definitely forgot that he still needs to drop by Tesco. Harry can at least rely on Malfoy to remind him. He’s somehow always keenly aware of when something’s escaped Harry’s mind. In all honesty, Harry wouldn’t know what he’d do without Malfoy’s list on the fridge to keep his life in check.
Harry decides.
“Have fun at your Gay Brunch!” Harry calls out to his retreating form.
He wants it so badly, wishes Malfoy were under him now, writhing and gasping in pleasure. Harry’s fist is flying over his cock, eyes shut and head thrown wildly back. He is lost to the pleasure and Malfoy’s noises suggest the same.
, even if it is with Draco. I’d hope you two can resolve conflicts without hexing each other by now.”
Harry stares at the familiar bottle for a moment while Draco sits up and unstoppers it, pooling some of the viscous liquid onto his fingers.
loud? What could he possibly be doing that would warrant those levels of volume? And could he kindly
Surely, if he just keeps his eyes closed and pretends like he’s somewhere else, pretty soon he’ll have to start drifting away. He focuses on warm, summer winds and rolling pastures flitting fast below him. A memory from July, trying out his new broom. He remembers the calm joy of flying and tries to hold on to it, tries to let it lull him to sleep. But then Malfoy is moaning again, and suddenly his thoughts are hurtling to black silk shirts with the collar unbuttoned and unbuttoning,
Draco shivers, hands reaching up to card through Harry’s hair and pull him closer. When their lips finally touch, it has nothing of the hesitance that began their friendship and everything of the ferocity that they’d always thrown at each other. A kiss like a car crash, a right hook, a forest fire. And Harry thinks to himself that,
“Oh, of course, Harry.” She passes the package across the counter. “It’s just in the back. I can get it for you in a sec.”
Everything is hazy and razor sharp all at the same time, a tidal wave of emotions and realizations and desires. Harry is drowning. Because Malfoy is saying his name, and Harry is struck with the fact that he must know. That there was no way Malfoy would be this loud, moaning Harry’s name, without knowing that Harry can hear him.
Harry learns that Draco can be quiet too, little shuddering gasps and cut-off breaths and he loves it just as much as when he’s loud. Draco is sitting on Harry’s cock now, sweat-slick and wine spattered, a dark blooming trail of love bites leading down his neck. Harry’s hands grip his hips, pulling him down to meet each of his thrusts.
“Come to pub night, then,” Harry says seriously, knowing Draco’s only kidding, and meaning it anyway. “But go out with me too.” He reaches for Draco’s hand.
A frustrated sound escapes him, before, “
Ron doesn’t seem to hear him, but Ginny does. “I reckon you might be needing something a little stronger than an oil massage, Harry,” she chimes in, handing Harry her drink. Harry obediently downs it in one go.
Eyelids fluttering shut as Harry’s fingers trail down his cheek, Draco whispers, “Harry.”
It’s finally 8pm when the Floo lights up in a roar of green sparks. The first of the guests to arrive are almost always Ron and Hermione, doubtlessly due to Hermione’s unwavering punctuality, Harry thinks fondly.
“They’ve been your friends for a while now too,” Harry snorts. “Besides, you invited Pansy and Blaise. So if anything, it’s your party.”
Bloody Malfoy, keeping him up all night. Who even is
“No, Harry,” Draco speaks between his laughter. “Yours is just an essential oil. Luna would have told you that it was external use only. You’re supposed to rub it on your temples.” He takes his lube coated hand and demonstrates the procedure on Harry’s face. Harry futilely tries to smack it away with an indignant cry.
“Potter,” Draco says as he spots the two. “I see you’ve met Harvey.”
“Ah, the prodigal Saviour returns. And bearing gifts!” Malfoy exclaims, catching the bag with a Seeker’s grace. “It would be unbecoming to be late to your own party, Potter. Whatever would your friends say?” Harry settles down on the sofa beside him and Malfoy easily drapes his legs over Harry’s. Warmth seeps through Malfoy’s jeans and into Harry’s bones like honey.
• ☽ ϟ ☾ •
“Bossy,” Harry chides playfully. “Not for long, though. I’ll have you screaming for me this time, Malfoy.”
The lube is put to good use, Harry slicking up a finger before running it down Draco’s crease to circle around his rim. He presses lightly at first, listening to the way Draco takes a sharp inhale at the feeling, raising his hips up slightly and parting his legs wider for Harry. His other hand reaches down to cup a firm arse cheek, squeezing before he trails it back up.
Malfoy snorts. “Graced to have your permission.” He reaches his room and he calls out from inside, “and don’t forget to pick up some of those muggle snacks I like. You know, the crunchy ones.”
In the end, Saturday rolls around once more and it doesn’t get brought up at all. And if the thought of Malfoy lingers far longer than the sleeplessness he caused in the first place, then Harry only has himself to blame.
For the next few days, Harry tries to continue avoiding Malfoy. It isn’t nearly as effective this time around, however, since the prat always seems to be everywhere. In the morning, when Harry goes to take a slash, Malfoy barges in unannounced to start getting ready. He just calmly reaches for his toothbrush in their shared toothbrush holder and lines up the products he uses for his skin care routine, while Harry scrambles to keep his prick covered, spluttering mismatched words at the cool gaze regarding him in the mirror.
“You’re so beautiful,” he whispers, unable to look away. Draco’s flush is decadent, a fine aged merlot in a carved crystal glass. Harry drinks his fill greedily.
Harry can’t counter that. “You and Ginny are a pain in my arse. I’m switching my favourite Weasley to Charlie again.”
Harry groans at the reminder that he’ll never live down sixth year. “No!” He complains. “And I’m not stalking him again, ‘Mione, I promise.” In fact, Harry had spent most of the past few days adamantly avoiding Malfoy—a feat considering they roomed right beside each other. “He’s not doing anything more nefarious than torturing me every Saturday.”
their games, Coach Potter?”
“Uh,” Harry starts, unsure how to proceed. “Hi?”
Harry leans against the railing and waits. His eyes trail Draco as he promptly herds the imposter out the front door with a cheerful salutation, fingers waggling. Harry hopes he trips on the troll leg on his way out. Draco closes the door and turns to face him. Harry holds his stare unflinchingly.
“Thank you, Luna, I’ll be sure to visit soon,” he promises, resolving to drop by her quaint shop on Diagon by the end of the week.
Thoroughly chastened, Harry nods. The idea of bringing it up with Malfoy is still mostly painful, but Hermione gives him a look like she’d know if he didn’t go through with it. Knowing her, she probably would. Sighing again, Harry drops his head onto the table. Someone is patting his back in sympathy.
Harry has no excuse whatsoever the next morning. He’s already in a rush, struggling to throw on his Muggle suit to get ready for the important meeting they had briefed on earlier in the week. Malfoy catches him on his way out, stepping in close to adjust Harry’s skewed tie and lay his collar down neatly.
“Isn’t it?” Luna says, pleased. “Draco helped me improve on the standard Hangover Potion.”
“I don’t know, should you be fraternizing with players on other teams
“Is he plotting something again, then?” She asks, clearly amused.
fly away from—leaving him to burn bright and hot with Draco Malfoy.
Ginny enters the shop from through the door leading upstairs to her and Luna’s flat. She looks almost as hungover as Harry feels. “Please, let’s not bring up drinking for another week at the very least.” She kisses Luna’s cheek. “Good morning,
Harry kisses up Draco’s chest as he fingers him, taking care to run his lips softly over the scars that litter his skin. He presses his apologies against the raised silver marks and finds absolution in the way Draco breathes out his name.
Draco smiles, sharp and bright like a rapier parrying. “That’s awfully candid of you after a few weeks, Potter. And here I thought you just slept like the dead.”
, Potter.” His eyes flick back towards Harry one last time over his shoulder. “If it’s ‘Gay Brunch,’ you should technically be joining us.” With the last word, his rude gesture morphs into his characteristic finger-wagging farewell as he leaves.
It would be beautiful and debaucherous to watch Malfoy fall apart, his picture perfect composure broken as he bites down on his bottom lip and lets go of his inhibitions. Harry can picture it clearly, glorious and free in its image. Malfoy on top of him, his chest rosy pink and nipples hard, ruddy cock bobbing while he fucks himself on Harry’s cock. Harry reaches out to stroke him, and it pushes Malfoy over the last edge of his control. He spills over Harry’s hand with a final drawn-out moan of Harry’s name.
Though, Harry has no doubt that Malfoy will always be sharp, jagged edges. Elegantly deadly, like slivers of shattered crystal. But if Harry’s enmity and then his friendship with Malfoy indicates anything, it’s that regardless, Harry is all too willing to be cut. Preferably on the glint edge of Malfoy’s cheekbones.
Harry wants to be annoyed about it again, but ends up amused instead. “You’re a menace, Weasley. Good luck with your match tomorrow.”
Draco only raises an eyebrow, aristocratic arrogance slipping on as easily as a silk glove. “Is that a threat, Potter?”
“Hm,” Draco says, considering, his elegant fingers trailing over Harry’s scars. “I’ll have to check my schedule. Perhaps if I can fit you in between Saturday brunch and your pub night.”
Harry scrunches up his face. “They always go clubbing later in the day. You know I’m not keen on crowds. Or dancing.” His mind flashes to an image of Malfoy under pulsing neon lights, sweat-sheened and smiling as he leans back into a faceless bloke. He quickly wills it away, but an unpleasant feeling remains.
He grabs the carton of eggs from the top shelf.
• ☽ ϟ ☾ •
The interactions throw him off enough to dispel any attempt to bring up volume control completely, even if Malfoy’s appreciative noises during dinner are the perfect segue into it. It’s perplexing and disarming and always leaves Harry dazed afterwards.
“I really do hope it helps, Harry,” Luna says, seriously. “But please remember it’s external use only.”
“Well, I’m glad to see you. I have Draco’s stuff right here with yours.” She says, grabbing something from underneath the counter. She brings out two glass bottles of shimmering liquid, labelled only with Harry and Malfoy’s names, and proceeds to package it diligently with brown kraft paper and golden twine.
“Draco,” he whispers back against the hollow of his throat, and it speaks more than Harry ever thought it could.
Draco keens as Harry starts to work him into his mouth slowly, lips sliding down his cock. He intends to make this last, to hear as many sounds as he can have Draco make until Draco can no longer speak in words.
Harry rubs his face, tiredly. “It’s just that—he’s so
Harry isn’t able to respond in the midst of his haste to get out the door, but he spends the meeting with his face hot, thinking about the way Malfoy’s fingers brushed the nape of his neck.
“Heading out today, then?” Malfoy asks, levitating Harry’s steaming mug over to him and taking Harry in with a slow once-over.
to the list before Apparating away, satisfied.
Grabbing the ends of his pillow, Harry cocoons his head inside and around his ears until the sounds are muffled and indiscernible. But once again, he barely sleeps a wink.
Harry is somehow able to get himself to walk away to the kitchen where he places the snacks onto the table next to what seems to be the entirety of Grimmauld’s alcohol stores. He grabs a bag of crisps and throws it at Malfoy.
• ☽ ϟ ☾ •
Then, it is quiet again, and Harry is spent, silent, and still. In the calm hush of the night, Harry slowly falls asleep to the sound of Draco’s voice echoing in his head, calling his name.
Draco turns away slightly, eyes sparking, but his blush is hot on his cheeks. “You’re the—
.” Harry mutters, unable to help himself.
“Mate, it’s always Malfoy,” Ron says after a pause.
Later, Harry gets up and heads out to Luna’s. He leaves the mugs sitting together on the table.
Unbidden arousal rises and for a brief instant, Harry considers giving into it. To simply allow himself to paint a picture in his head to go along with the sounds. To imagine Malfoy with his head tipped, mouth parted on a moan. Malfoy, rocking his hips back and forth. Malfoy, eyes glazed and wanting. Malfoy.
Fuck it, Harry promptly decides, skipping past what would have been a stumbling walk up three flights of stairs and instead Apparating them directly to his room. They land halfway upright before they’re tipping onto his bed in a sprawl of limbs and wet lips and teeth. Harry can’t tell which way is up.
Draco laughs, “
As Luna heads to the back, Ginny turns to Harry and looks at the package in his hands with two eyebrows raised. “Picking up Malfoy’s stuff now, huh?”
Draco only whines, grinding his hips in a way that makes Harry hiss.
” She makes a beeline to where Malfoy is standing without a backward glance at anyone else.
“You had no reservations saying my name last night,” Harry says, determined.
, gonna come for you—Potter, please.”
Harry cannot stop thinking about Malfoy—hasn’t been able to for weeks now—pumping faster and harder, and he knows that he is so hopelessly gone. Harry aches and wants with relentless fervor. It’s a fire that he cannot fly away from—that he
“Er.” Harry rubs the back of his neck. “You wouldn’t also have something for a hangover, would you?”
It’s happened a few times over the course of the past few weeks. Every Saturday, when Malfoy goes out, he brings home some bloke. They always have what seems to be the loudest sex possible in the middle of the night. Usually, Harry can do nothing more than try to smother himself to sleep with his pillow, blocking out the noises and the uncomfortable feelings they incite. He is always left restless.
He watched on Monday while Harry looked off with a frown at seemingly nothing during a meeting with the department head of Magical Games and Sports and the other Quidditch League coaches. And on Tuesday, during practice, when he paced with a frown on the quidditch pitch until he was hit by a wayward bludger. And today, when he filled out paperwork about a new player’s contract with his persevering frown—all while Harry thought of goddamn Malfoy.
Reaching a hand under his shirt, Harry looks for more of Draco’s angles, wanting to see everything he hasn’t already. He wants it all. Every sharp breath, every shiver, every soft moan. He wants to see the full picture of his past week’s torment on full display for him, the sight of it reunited with the sounds he has heard.
, Ron.” Harry casts a deadpan expression. “Who eats bloody over hard eggs?”
Grocery run this week: Malfoy
He once again begins the tedious journey to the kitchen. Grimmauld place has always been exceedingly large, and it’s one of the reasons he liked the idea of Draco living with him after eighth year, filling the too-empty house with a presence he’d become so accustomed to. With how the past week has been going, Harry has been grateful for the extra space that allowed him to avoid Draco easily—short-lived though it was. Six floors of hiding places are well worth it, but less so when four of them stand between him and a decent cup of caffeine. Of course he could always just Apparate there, but the walk down the steps helps to wake him up, and a moment to steel himself and gather his thoughts before seeing Draco is appreciated.
• ☽ ϟ ☾ •
Harry is hungover. His head hurts and his neck has got a crick in it from the unfortunate sprawl he’d landed in when he passed out on his bed last night, but at least he’s gotten a decent amount of sleep. More than he can say he’s had for a certain number of nights. A certain number of nights that may or may not have been partly responsible for the sheer quantity of drinks he ended up having and perhaps even that round of exploding beer pong or two. He thinks one of his eyebrows might still be singed. It’s confirmed when he enters the loo but he easily fixes it with a simple charm after he’s showered and dressed.
Surely, he’s having an aneurysm of some sort and he did indeed die and this is some weird version of the afterlife that bypasses King’s Cross entirely, since he
Harry makes good on his promise. Draco is so loud, Harry thinks that you could probably hear them from outside. He isn’t at all put off by the thought, the idea of others hearing the sounds Draco makes for him at least a little tempting. Draco might make an exhibitionist of him yet.
“Wha—” Harry starts as their kiss is suddenly broken, but he’s cut off by Draco grappling around for his wand, still tucked into the pocket of his jeans discarded on the floor. With an arching swoop, he casts a wordless Accio. A glass bottle of shimmering liquid hurls through the air and into his waiting palm.
“A madman,” Ron agrees, nodding along.
Harry takes a moment to consider that perhaps this, this uncomfortable calm before, is worse than the offensive sounds of last night. Perhaps it’s even Malfoy’s newest form of torture. Harry takes a bite of his eggs. No, last night was definitely still worse.
“It’s Malfoy,” Harry goes on, and Hermione and Ron don't look very surprised.
“Draco now, am I?” He raises an eyebrow. “I think I’ll stick to calling you Potter.”
Harry almost drops the eggs. There, sitting silently at the kitchen table as though the world is his oyster, is the bloke that must be partly responsible for last night’s lack of sleep.
.” Draco groans loudly now, fingers tangling into Harry’s already messed up hair. It’s a bit sharp and tugs a little at his scalp, but it makes Harry hum around Draco’s shaft and take it deeper down his throat.
, on the right side of the walls.
“Fuck. Harry—
Harry grabs his wallet from the kitchen table, but pauses at the list. He taps his wand on it once, adding
Harry gratefully takes the excuse to get up from the sofa, gently dropping Malfoy’s legs off his lap as he goes to greet them. “Hey, Ron, ‘Mione.” He hugs her and leans back to grin at Ron.
“Oh, uh, yeah, no. Go ahead,” Harry manages to get out, stepping to the side to let him pass. Malfoy’s bare arm brushes lightly against his as he passes and Harry can feel goosebumps rising on his skin in his wake.
. Merlin, you’re dense, Harry.”
Ginny comes up to them with a colourful drink in hand. “Oh yeah, Harry. You do seem awfully
!” Pansy suddenly shrieks, stepping out of the Floo and effectively diverting the entire room’s attention. “You didn’t say you hooked up with Antonio from Transportation!
“Well, we can’t trust you gaggle of Gryffindors to be worthwhile entertainment, can we?” He smirks and eats a crisp. Harry tries not to follow the movement, but fails with a quick glance at Malfoy’s lips. He looks away and bites the inside of his cheek to contain an endeared smile. Trust Malfoy to be the kind of person to eat two-pound crisps with a glass of wine.
, and for Harry alone. He watches Draco become a mess under him and the rush of power it gives him is potent, settling heavy in his groin, his cock hard and leaking, untouched, against the sheets. Harry gets off just knowing he’s the one able to do this to Draco. He revels in it, bobbing his head faster.
it’s bothering you so much.”
Harry pulls him down to give him a soft kiss, smiling against his lips. “I’m willing to suffer through it for you, Malfoy.”
—Gryffindor. Took you long enough to notice.” He struggles to hold a lofty glare as Harry works him languidly, and Harry finds it incredibly endearing.
She only laughs, raising a hand to playfully salute him. “Thanks, coach.”
Harry doesn’t know how to feel about the fact that they’d been discussing his Malfoy related suffering. “Should you be fraternizing with players on other teams after their games, Consultant Strategist Weasley?” He asks instead.
No one says anything while they proceed to eat breakfast. The only thing cutting the extended silence is the strikingly loud clatter of knives and forks. It leaves room for Harry to switch back and forth between anxiously looking at the other two men and unwillingly recalling the loud sounds that Malfoy made last night. With the bloke who sits just to Harry’s right. Who made Malfoy make those sounds. Through unspeakable means.
“Harry,” Luna says, approaching him in a silver sequined dress that glimmers with each step. “It seems the moon frogs are plaguing you especially this season. Have you been having difficulties with concentration as of late?”
“You’ve been driving me insane bringing those blokes over. With all those noises you make,” Harry says, reaching for Draco’s cock and giving it a slow stroke. Draco’s breath hitches. “You couldn’t just ask me out, could you? You really had to torture me first.” Harry huffs out a laugh. “Do you get off on being a prat or were you so unsure I’d reciprocate?”
“Is it?” Draco says nonchalantly, as though Harry didn’t hear it so clearly the night before that it still rings through his mind.
“Harry. Harry—
His fingers brush up on the tight knot of Draco’s prostate and a sharp wail leaves Draco’s lips. Twisting his hand to angle it deeper, Harry rubs against it over and over, watching the way Draco falls apart as Harry’s fingers slide in and out of his arse.
Potter! Pick up snacks for The Party!
“Luna, thanks again for the—” Harry gestures vaguely to the package in his hands.
And he’s fit too, Harry notices, all dark hair and sprawling muscles. Then Harry recalls the night before and scowls. His mind goes to Draco’s voice crying out his name, and resolves not to think of the bloke as Harry #2 in his head, valiantly hoping that maybe ignoring him would make him disappear faster.
Draco looks at him with heavy-lidded eyes, trying to fuck himself harder on Harry’s cock. “Ahh, yes. Gonna come.”
Upon waking, Harry realizes immediately that he has slept in for the first Sunday in several weeks. The sun is already pouring in through the ornate curtains and his room looks almost unfamiliar bathed in the golden light. It’s enlightening in more ways than one. He laughs softly, looking up at the ceiling. Last night certainly cleared up any remainder of his reservations.
“Oh, Harry,” she says, traces of mirth lingering, but smiling at him with genuine warmth. "You know you can tell us about anything that’s bothering you.”
Harry could not know the answer to that. Not unless he asks, and the mere thought of that has Harry rushing to think of anything else. Sharp, rhythmic creaks puncture through his embarrassment like a knife. No, Harry withdraws his hands from his pyjamas, he doesn’t want to get off to his (potentially unaware) best friend’s moans like a sneak. What he wants is Malfoy cognizant and receptive. The reality of the situation hits him hard. He is lying alone in his bed and Malfoy is very much not alone in his. It’s like being doused by a bucket of ice water.
Maybe it made him happy because he actually chose to sign the paper himself, despite Harry pushing him towards it- he knew that the choice was still ultimately his to make. Harry would have accepted it if he had said no.
The weekend finally came, and Draco awoke in the frumpy, soft gryffindor bed he’d come to actually find comforting. He took a moment to fully wake himself up, and pulled a grey sweater adorned in maroon and gold over his white dress shirt, sliding his uniform pants on afterwards. He then tried to neaten up his corner of the dorm room- which simply ended with him shoving everything into his trunk quickly. Afterwards, he finally made his way down to the common room.

Hint: The next chapter is called "Loyalty: A fine line between..."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione are forced to share a compartment with him, a surprise he didn't like.
They slowly moved away from fundamentals to focus on more powerful spells like
“But this is different, flying is… Well it’s not Charms.” He stared at his wand, a stern face of frustration on his face
- conversation with his prefect. Afterwards he made hiw way down to the great hall for breakfast.
In which Draco recieves a letter from the famed school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
His wand burst out with a clean, thin shield which puslated far brighter than he’d ever expected. He concentrated and it slowly grew in size, and he let an astonished, small laugh. He was at a loss for words, the feeling was like nothing he’d anticipated-
His pale eyes stayed fixated on the letter and he felt himself frowning. The three tried to ask him what was wrong, but for a brief moment he could not process it. ‘
He prepared his wand again, mind racing, and his grey eyes wandered over to Harry- a genuine and sincere smile slowly forming as he called upon the charm again, the feeling of magic rushing through his body again.
“Impressive! Now take that idea and focus in on the good aspects. Take hold of the happiness in those memories.”
“Nice to meet you, Draco.” Her voice was light and fluttery and he dipped his head in response.
Draco, of course, had his doubts on whether or not this was a good idea
Expect the next chapter soon, however I will have to write most of it from scratch so it might take longer than expected. Stay tuned!
Draco's fever dream continues as be goes against everything he'd do if he'd never been moved. The inquisitorial squad is formed and all Draco can think about it how he's somehow grateful he isn't with them.
All he could remember from the recent weeks had been a couple of tests, an unfortunate run-in with the inquisitorial squad... That- and the formation of the DA.
“Right, right.” He drawled out. “I’m sure it’ll be in my most dire time when it happens, right?” They both laughed. “Anyways- I think I’m going to call it here, if you don’t mind. That took a lot out of me, and I don’t want to beat a dead horse and continue.” He sighed and stuck his wand into his pocket.
When the meeting ended, they gathered at the alcove of the room where Harry had set up tables and a mirror and a few other things, and he talked about his plans and announcements, then the group broke for dinner.
“Not at all, unfortunately.” A bitter voice replied.
“Where else would they go?” Harry laughed. “Can’t imagine a more suitable place, after all.”
. As they did, the mild stigma that had been looming over Draco’s head seemed to lighten, until he felt that
“Terrible. Angelina wasn’t even running a real practice. We basically got told off by Umbridge for god knows how long and barely got on our brooms.” He complained. “It’s not really quidditch now, it’s just…”

attention being drawn to him- which was hard when every passing Slytherin actively chose to glare at him from down the halls when he took a few steps out of the tower. When he did manage to slip into the corridor unnoticed, the doors’ intricate carvings etched themselves into the wall and cracked open for him.
Draco grabbed a few pieces of toast as they argued over
He murmured.
He smiled when she shot off a spell which sent Draco’s wand across the room far further than he’d expected. “Good work! Keep that in mind while you’re practicing.” He said enthusiastically, patting her on the back while Draco collected his wand had been thrown. “Draco, your turn.” Harry then said, and he picked up his wand.
thing anyways, so-” It was clear what Harry was doing, and Draco gave him a reassuring nod to try and calm his nerves.
Then, of course, the newly ordained 'High Inquisitor' had to step in and ruin everything.
His voice was cut off by the powerful draft that picked up as the morning flurry of mail owls ran their course through the great hall and filled the room with the sounds of letters opening- and some
He would be lying if he said he wasn’t impressed with how the organisation grew each passing week, and how competent Harry turned out to be when teaching the students and how they could improve. He’d also be lying if he said he wasn’t proud of the group- despite only having just learned all of their names, and only befriending a few of them. He’d be lying if he said he regretted joining too.
Draco knew liked anything Umbridge did, the High Inquisitor created a group of students called the ‘inquisitorial squad,’ which he assumed was just a glorified hall-monitor position for extra credit. He and the others suspected that the squad’s actual purpose was to investigate and find the lucrative

that the ministry thought Dumbledore was hiding from them, or in real life case, they assumed they were searching for the DA.
Then of course, there was Umbridge. A surprise he very much didn't like.
“Alright everyone, welcome to the first meeting of the DA.” Harry started, Draco could tell he was straining his voice to make sure it didn’t crack in front of the group, awkwardly standing in front of the group with little confidence- despite Draco knowing he was capable of a ridiculous level of it.
SO SORRY FOR THE LONG WAIT and super short chapter. I usually aim for ~4000 words or 10 pages per chapter but the original version of this chapter only had roughly... 2 pages and like 1000 words? It was really difficult stretching this out and cleaning it and getting it to a minimum standard that’s i set for myself.
Draco kicked the stone brick floor and laughed. “Right. Doesn’t make it any less frustrating. I’m supposed to be good at this whole ‘magic’ thing.”
The holidays chapter used to be one, but this became so long I decided to split it up into 2 separate chapters.
“Of course! We’ll catch up in a few, I can pitch you some ideas for next year’s plans!” Harry responded, walking him towards the door which formed as they approached, saying his goodbyes. Draco stuck his head out the door slowly, seeing no sign of Umbridge’s search party, and made his way down the corridor to the grand hall.
I hope you enjoy it, even if it isn't perfect!
“It’s just an update from my mother.” He finally concluded to the group. “Stuff about my father’s work, and when he’d finally be able to come and fix this ‘rehousing’ mess that’s been going on for so long.” He tossed the letter to the middle of the table, shrugging. “Barely any word from him, but according to her, he should be home for holidays.” He scratched the bird’s head.
Edit NO. 1: The first chapter of the rewritten series is now complete at roughly 10k! I am currently in the middle of the second chapter, at 6k, and I intend to post the new work after I’ve gotten at least 2-3 chapters rewritten and I get back into the groove of writing. The new series will be published soon, though! 💜
“Another detention, sounds like.” Draco mumbled between chews of his own food. “Good thing I’m not on the team.” He let a small chuckle leave his system.
Anyways, thanks for reading and for all the support! <3
A burning sensation filled his body and he felt a force press against the wand, when his pale eyes cracked open- a small, but far more developed shield of light pulsated in front of him, and his surprise caused his focus to drop and the charm dissipated.
ps the fact that hes wearing harry's jacket for like most of this chapter his killing me guys its KILLING ME!!!!!
I'm so sorry this chapter took FOR-FREAKING-EVER!!!
“You two, enough about those things already, we all know they aren’t real.” Hermione finally groaned, looking up from her own reading.
After a few moments of silence, Ron showed up- sitting across from him at the table with a tired expression across his face. “Patronus got the best of you, too?” Draco asked, still staring at the ceiling.

A small voice in his head appeared, saying things that he himself would never admit aloud.
I didn't like the way I'd handled the relationships and connections and scenes in the first iteration, so I decided to rewrite it and get myself back into the swing of things.
He looked down at the grated stone ground. ‘
The afternoon continued along a similar path as Draco and the others who obviously knew what they were doing were working to perfect the spells while Harry stuck to assisting the younger students. As the class continued, Harry grew more confident which made it far less awkward when he tried giving feedback to people, and Draco tried to get more comfortable around being in a large group.
caught by the squad, despite how unlikely it was. When the looks in their eyes caught his in the halls, their shiny new badges imposing threat to the students as if they were prefects, he began to truly think that perhaps his old friends weren’t very good people at all, and that even when he did get rehoused, he probably wouldn’t stick

The group had decided it to be on a Saturday- to ease them into the lessons that Harry had been planning with great enthusiasm.
being a viable memory to pick. When he attempted to cast the spell- eyes closed and his concentration far greater than he’d ever had to focus on a spell- he summoned all the best memories he could, and allowed the energy to flow and carry through the spell. The result of his concentration was a sad puttering spew of light from the tip of his wand and then nothing more.

“Expecting anything?” Ron asked.

Have fun thinking on that one for a little while ;')
He realised. ‘
That is- until something rather unsettling arrives.
He bit his lip, unnerved by the idea that had crossed his mind.
This chapter really marks the beginning of change within Draco's mindset- so I'm excited to bring the next few chapters... which have some very interesting scenes and ideas behind them.
Draco didn’t respond, and they didn’t bring it up again in the conversation, letting it fall back into an almost satire conversation about things that didn’t really matter.
He knew that Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise, and Pansy were on this Squad. He knew that a number of his old friends were now currently searching for an organisation he helped to create, and he knew that it wouldn’t be good if they

“Likewise.” He murmured quietly. After exchanging their pleasantries- they bowed to begin their duel and began exchanging magical blows. Luna was alright, if not a little hesitant with her spellwork. When Harry made his way over to them, he seemed to notice that too- showing her how to follow through with the spells more confidently.

Hello everyone! I just want to send out an update that I AM alive and I AM still working on this!
“Fancy bird, Draco.” Ron blurted out as the owl ruffled its feathers, placing the letter onto the table. It was addressed for him. He swallowed, not knowing just what it could be-
Sorry guys ;')
Harry nodded his head along and shrugged. “That’s true, but Hermione was never any good with flying. No one’s perfect, and that includes you too.” He offered a smile.
“You should be glad- It really did feel like detention!” Harry rested his head on the table with an annoyed exhale. “Well, I guess it can’t all be bad, at least my
Early update, surprise!
When he entered the Great Hall, he mindlessly sat down at the Gryffindor table, not too many people had arrived for dinner yet- so the population of students wasn’t too high. He nodded to a couple passing students as he examined silverware or stared off into the sea of candles which floated above him- mind wandering.
“It knows french?!” Ron groaned, still picking up crumbs from the

. It felt warm and comforting to be surrounded by the vaulted walls and ceilings draped in curtains, wallpapers, and enough windows to start a garden. He liked the dozens of couches and sofas strewn about, the fireplace in the centre of it all with the golden cups and house portraits lining the surrounding area.

Draco paused for a moment, stopping himself from rejecting the offer. “Mostly my memories with my mother.” He sighed. “My life’s been very chaotic as of late, so not a lot of other things are necessarily bringing me joy.”
The four finally headed down for dinner once every student successfully left the room without Umbridge screaming at them, and that night Draco had an odd feeling in his body he couldn’t quite place. Whether good, or not, he wasn’t going to think too hard on it, and he seemed to all but worry in the moment.

The room was already decently populated by the time he’d arrived, doors forming from other sides of the wide training hall which made way for other arriving students.

Things, of course, are not that simple.

Harry hummed as he thought for a second, watching the room. “Well, clearly that hasn’t worked. Have you tried something more recent? Usually the fresher the memory the more influence it has.” He suggested. “It doesn’t need to be something too incredibly powerful either.”

“Minuit is the family owl. Very rare, and very well trained. We got him from the french bureaucracy. I’m pretty sure he knows more french than I do.” He stared at the letter with any amount of discretion, and for some reason, felt his heart sink.

Draco hesitated at the notion of groupings, but eventually found his way to Luna Lovegood- whom he knew to remember- but had never spoken to before. She was a bit of an oddball herself, so they ended up being last-pick partners.
he couldn’t help the pit feeling of enthrallment.
It's generally the same, with a few minor changes to the plot, and a completely new facelift to the writing and stuff.
The hallway was silent except for his muffled footsteps on the carpet. He felt his nerves jangle, remnants from when the house used to look like a funeral parlour. Ginny had spent most of her spare time renovating and remodelling the townhouse, and the changes were extraordinary. Yet, despite the changes sometimes when he was alone. With Kreacher out of earshot and Teddy at Hogwarts, there still seemed to be a lingering presence, like a thick, cloying darkness that hung close to the corners.
“What?” He said, surprise paling his face. “So, you’re telling me that you’ve spent the last twelve months chewing on this without talking to anyone about it?” Teddy asked, his voice cracking slightly. “Uncle Harry, that’s not healthy. ”
“Morning!” He smiled as the sandy-haired man approached.
He shook himself as he continued down the stairs towards the kitchen. They’d eventually managed to remove all the portraits along the corridors, including Mrs Black, much to the relief of everyone that frequented the property. Harry had secreted the picture in the loft room and had let Kreacher turn that area into his den. Kreacher had been the best-behaved house-elf ever since.
The discussion eventually veered toward Christmas plans, and Draco felt a deep, aching loneliness at the prospect of staying in the manor alone. Alone with all the ghosts. Seeming to sense his sudden swing in mood, Rolf smiled at him brightly.
“Right, in no particular order, Perkins, Moon & Wright” the pale girl walked up as she tried to hide her blush as she reached for her sheet. Harry smiled kindly.
“Give him a break Mione, he’s going through a divorce!” Ron winked at him, and Harry watched as her face dropped into one of horror.
“It’s amazing here, and it’s only a bit colder than home this time of year. One year, you really must come! They had the annual broom race come through here last night. There must have been about two hundred racers; I heard that close to five hundred racers set out from Koppaberg.”
He unrolled the scroll and began to read. His hands began to quiver as his almost-forgotten nerves start to vibrate with renewed anxiety. He closed his eyes for a second, crushing the paper to his chest as he let out the breath he was holding. His heartbeat thundered in his ears as he shakily pulled the letter out to start rereading it.
“Maybe he’s gay,” Blaise said again, his voice deeper and softer.
“Hey guys,” came a tentative greeting which drew their attention immediately. They all looked up as Neville appeared.
“Not so odd now. Do you reckon he knows? About the affair, I mean?”
notes at the end, just in case of spoilers.
“No, this place wasn’t around then. Ollivander’s was the only wand shop worth visiting.”
“So?” She started, looking at him directly, her frizzy hair clinging to her luminous skin. “Do you want to tell me what’s going on? Or do I have to guess?” She asked, tilting her head as she checked her face in a small mirror she’d revealed from her purse.
“He’s right, Harry. Who better to teach children about the dark arts than THE Harry Potter?” Hermione added.
After a playful nibble on his tongue, Harry growled and began undoing the buttons of Draco’s shirt. Draco felt his heart skip a beat as felt the air caress his exposed skin before Harrys claimed his neck and collar bone with kisses and nibbles of his own. It was Draco’s turn to moan as gooseflesh rose across his arms and chest.
“Wow, Potter. Your vocabulary astounds and wounds me in equal measure.” Malfoy replied, a small smirk playing on his lips. “Nice to know that some things haven’t changed from school.”
Lifting his quill to the inkwell and started to read as he tried desperately to forget Draco and their upcoming nuptials. He smiled as he held the feather to his lips. What Draco didn’t know was that he had arranged to surprise Draco tonight. Smiling, he knew Neville was going to cover his rounds this weekend. He focused back to the essay before him and knuckled under, knowing the more marking he did now, the more time he would have with Draco over the weekend.
“Mrs Malfoy? Who? My Mother?” Malfoy asked, surprise and confusion waring on his normally blank face.
“Right, you leave it to me. You like that design?” He nodded again. “Now get out of here! I am busy!” She almost pushed him out with a smile and slammed the doors behind him. He stood for a second, wondering to himself what had just happened. He shrugged to himself as he followed the path back to the hatchery and back to a half-naked Harry. He’d be lying if he hadn’t run part of the way there, and Malfoys did not run.
“Malfoy?” Hermione asked, finally, “As in Draco Malfoy?”
Harry shook his head, nervously. He had thought about teaching but knew that he would fail if he tried.
“Sorry if I startled you,” he said shakily to the bird. “I wasn’t expecting this letter,” Draco looked at the letter again. Harry had asked for a reply. He glanced at the letter again, nearly unable to contain his excitement. He threw the scroll onto the bed as he furiously riffled through his bag in search of his quill and parchment. Unable to find it, he cursed as he grabbed his sketch pad and pencil. It pained him to use it instead of his quill, but he had no choice.
“What floor it that?”
“Dray, it’s me,” Blaise said, touching his shoulder. He jerked from the touch, but his heart slowed.
He spotted her wild hair, frizzy and voluminous in the strobe lighting. She and Ron were dancing together right in front of the stage, clearly enjoying the music. Harry sighed again; maybe it wasn’t his age. He was the youngest of the three of them, after all. He knew he shouldn’t have come. He was in no mood for partying or socialising. Unbeknown to Ron or Hermione, He and Ginny had signed the divorce papers that morning. They were now legally Potter and Weasley again, respectively.
“Yeah, Why?” Harry asked, his eyebrows furrowing in confusion.
“You’re the genius, see if you can work it out.” He said as he leant back, watching his face.
“Yeah, that’s why Weasley is here.”
“Of course he’s not!” She dismissed as she turned back to Ron.
“It’s Harry’s,” said Ron, then as if not sure himself as he appraised it “, isn’t it?”
“How did you hear about this place?” Draco asked, placing his wine glass down and tenting his fingers.
Malfoy straightened up as their eyes met, his face smoothing into the blank mask he always wore; Or at least the one he had worn at school. Harry held his gaze with a sinking feeling in his stomach, watching as he added layer upon layer of armour to his stare, like a knight preparing for battle. His eyes narrowed to focus as he and the blond shared a look from across the room. Harry tried not to let his eyes wander to the alabaster skin, how his suit flattered his figure. He really tried not to notice how the sleeves on his shirt were rolled up to his elbows, showing off strong and toned forearms.
Walking into the kitchen brought back memories, especially being so close to Christmas. He turned, expecting to see Sirius in the doorway. He frowned sadly when the door remained empty. He felt oddly bare as he turned back to the bare room. There hadn’t seemed to be a point of putting up any decorations this year, and there was a suspiciously large gap in the corner where they’d traditionally put the Christmas tree. He slumped down on a chair and folded his arms onto the table as he toyed with the idea of being lazy and getting Kreacher to make him a coffee. He shook his head, unable to bring himself to disturb the elf over such a small task. Finally, he pulled his wand out of his back pocket and with a swish, the kettle filled and settled itself on the stove, and the hob roared to life.
“True. Old habits die hard,” Harry said, still chuckling as he stepped out from behind his counter and approached his son, studying him.
“This has got your wand in a right twist, hasn’t it?”
“Nothing, just getting some fresh air, just like you,” Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously but sat back down. He stared into the distance, hoping that his senses would forget he was there. After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, he realised that even his nerves seemed to vibrate in such proximity to Malfoy, like iron filings to a magnet.
“See? That’s better. Just think of all the things I do to annoy you, and these next couple of weeks will fly by.” Harry chuckled as he kissed him again before going to stand. “Come on; my Portkey is about to activate.”
“Don’t worry, nothing too dangerous,” She assured him. “He’s at the hatching place, mucking out the eggs.” Draco felt the tension leave his shoulders as he began to eat his porridge with more gusto, realising just how hungry he was. Noomi watched him, a smirk on her face. “So, did you have a good birthday?” She asked, raising her cup to her lips, her eyes trained on him.
Harry sighed, and even to his own ears, it sounded aggravated. He wasn’t sure whether he had just reached a grumpy age or whether his newly divorced status had brought around this particularly dark mood. He was convinced that the last time he had heard the Weird Sisters play, they had sounded better. Albeit, he hadn’t been in much better spirits at the Yule Ball in fourth year either.
So Malfoy might be gay, and he might have become a decent human being. He felt his heart droop slightly at the thought of spending Sunday alone, going through old stuff to separate, ready for the finalisation of the divorce. Still, he knew that freedom would be his soon. As soon as he passed through the gates, he revealed his wand, and with a crack, he found himself on the top step of Grimmauld place.
“I had been out looking for the abandoned nests when the storm blew in and stranded me on the hillside. Luckily we have little shelters all over. I bunked down, waiting for the storm to pass when there was a crash to the side. I jumped out of my skin; I thought lightning had struck the roof, I head something roll down, and I saw a man on the ground. I stamped out the fire of his broom and brought him inside.”
“Which would you prefer? Muggle or Magic?”
“Go on, go to lunch. I’ll see you all later.” They waved as they left the classroom, leaving him on his own.
“I think I can restrain myself. I mean, it’s been at least five minutes since you’ve insulted me, so I think we’re good.”
“My name’s Scorpius, Mr Potter. It’s very nice to meet you,” His son said as he stepped forward to offer his hand. Draco watched the tanned face and sharp eyes take in his son, confusion waring with surprise on his dark features.
“What makes this Christmas different?” Harry asked
“That is hardly the point.” Blaise laughed first, followed by Draco shortly after. Draco took a sip of his wine, placing the glass back down, before opening his mouth to say something else.
“Don’t you think that’s a bit weird? You’ve never been friends, and you used to bully each other at school. It’s just a bit, you know, out of character. Don’t you think?”
“It wasn’t publicised much, to be honest. Malfoy left not long after that,” Ron replied after he took a sip of his mead.
“This is your desk” Rolf smiled. “This is Cosima’s desk, and I’ll introduce you when she’s back after Christmas. Once everyone has made their way in, I’ll introduce you to everyone, alright?”
“Ah. Yes. Of course,” The darker man chuckled as he linked his fingers in his lap and leant forward. “I wanted to pique your interest. Luna said that you could be very particular when you have too much information to work from. An ‘Overthinker’ she called you. What else did she say?” He paused as he looked away as if chasing a thought. “That was it! ‘Your head fills with Wrackspurt’.”
“Think about it, Harry. I think you’d be a great teacher; you really helped me in the DA.” Neville smiled. “I never thought I would be able to cast half of those spells if you hadn’t taught me, and I would never have been able to learn how to cast a Patronus with Snape as my teacher.” He shuddered.
He stepped out into the bright day and took in a deep and refreshing breath. He loved the smell of the air; everything smelled so fresh and new. He could smell the dragons too. Smoke and meat with a high metallic tang to it, sometimes the sweetness could be confused with hay. That was the smell of dragons. It was such an unusual scent to describe; only people who worked with dragons could understand. But, it was a scent you never forgot.
He fought to keep his thoughts at bay as he waited for the comforting warmth of a fire and the safety of somewhere to break down and crash. He focused on inconsequential thoughts like how the weeds, despite the incantations in place, still managed to grow through the gravel, causing the once neat and regulated driveway to become unkempt and shabby. Ivy had woven around the stone pillar and gates, giving the once-grand entrance to the house a neglected and abandoned aura. He slashed his wand abruptly, causing the gate to disappear momentarily, only to reappear again once he was on the other side. He tried to ignore the tingling in his fingers, of the dizzying haze at the edges of his vision.
“He’s a highly sought after Dragonologist, according to Rolf,” Said Luna, “The Ministry had no choice. They need his expertise with a new project.”
He grinned at her before raising another spoon to his mouth. He chewed and swallowed before answering.
“Yeah, He’s been owling Nandi for years since Aunt Sis start started to visit,” Harry couldn’t help the snort that escaped him. The thought of the Malfoy matriarch answering to ‘Aunt Sis’ was too funny not to. However, his smile faltered as he remembered that she had passed and he hadn’t known.
“Are you alright?” Blaise asked, wisely, not touching him. Draco closed his eyes as he pressed his now free hands to his head. In the panic, he had managed to ignore the gnawing pain between his temples. He felt a blanket covering his body and realised distantly he was naked and shivering. It felt like an eternity for him to calm down as his stomach threatened to erupt.
Draco could see them clearly now. It was as if their faces had featured in his nightmares. The first wore a dark and pointed hat which reminded him of Professor McGonagall. However, the hat was where the likeness ended. Makeup gathered in the lines and creases in her dry skin. Her dark eyes were narrowed, showing where her unsteady hands had quivered when she’d applied her mascara. The black lines smudged around her lids. A large blue ring sat on her finger, and large fake jewellery covered every joint visible.
When Draco had heard the words uttered: “Potter is looking at you.” His heart nearly jumped out of his chest. He felt his hands start to sweat as he looked up. Their eyes met across the crowded, great hall, and Draco felt the longing in his heart that he’d carried since long before they met at school. He pushed and smothered the feeling as he tried to regain his composure. Had Harry looked longingly at him? Or had it been wary or confused? It was difficult to read after so many years, and the idea that Harry could be gay too was beyond laughable. Draco couldn’t have been that lucky.
Draco didn’t answer as he felt the bile rise, burning his insides. Blaise sighed heavily before speaking as if explaining something simple to a child.  “He is not going to tell the British Wizarding community that his brother could be gay! I can’t believe we’re discussing this. You really must’ve been hit hard by that hex!” He shook his head as he rubbed his face.
“You are not supposed to. I don’t need you to understand.” Harry felt the panic bubbling away beneath his controlled surface.
Blaise shook his head again with a snort as he fell back into the chair beside his bed. He studied Draco for a moment before rolling his eyes.
The others sat, looking at Harry expectantly while he checked the map again.
“Lucasta Lloyd introduced me to the place, a most accommodating woman, I must say.” Blaise smiled as he held his wine in place on the table, his tall, lean body lounging on the chair. Draco had always thought that Blaise was one of the most naturally stunning men he had ever seen, and his grace and attitude only added to his mystique.
I just wanted to thank you for lending me your jacket. It was warm and did the trick. I would very much like to return it to you whenever you are free. It seems expensive, and I wouldn’t want you to be without it any longer.
“And if you’re worried about flowers, we can always get Neville to put more around however I think someone may drown in wisteria.” Draco chuckled, and Harry nodded, his smile returning. “It’s going to be perfect!” Draco insisted.
“What?” Ron asked, rubbing his arm.
“I’m alright, just got a lot on my mind.” He muttered back apologetically. “How was the rest of your weekend?”
He lay in the darkness and made no attempt to remove his clothes as he assessed his life. He guessed it made sense that it would turn out like this. He’d had his childhood and family stolen from him, so why would he get to have a happy ending? He hated feeling so mopey but found he couldn’t help himself.
“Not bad at all!” Draco agreed as his gaze returned to the dusting of dark hair across his pecks, which led down into a delicious trail below his trousers. He bit his lip as memories resurfaced from the night before. He cleared his throat, and both men looked over.  Patrik smiled and waved, as did Harry, but their eyes lingered on each other before he returned to work.  They walked closer as they listened.
The boy paused for a moment before speaking, looking confused at the intensity of Draco’s gaze.
“You actually let Malfoy sneak up on you?” Ron asked with raised eyebrows.
“It’s a lovely house you have here, really beautiful.”
“Ugh, Don’t tell me that you’ve finally bought into the myth,” Harry asked, ready to feel disgusted. Malfoy’s face changed as his eyes rose from their clasped hands to his lips and then his eyes. His heart fluttered, wondering if Malfoy felt what he did.
The light was waning in the distance as Draco followed after Patrik through the wild grass surrounding the compound. Draco had always thought of Sweden to be a land of snow and evergreen forests, and the last time he had visited, he had not been under any other pretence during his mid-November visit. Now, under the June sky, he was surprised at how many wildflowers danced and swayed in the evening air. He recognised foxgloves, albeit they seemed to be of a paler variety than the ones familiar to him in Britain. He recognised forget-me-not’s too, the small, cornflower blue stars dotted in little clusters, highlighting the pale grass.
“What?” He asked, eyes wide.
They remained in silence for a while, Malfoy leant against the stone, fiddling with the bottom of his pale waistcoat. Harry didn’t know what to say. He felt his heart beating heavily in his chest. He pulled at a thread in his trousers as he carefully replied.
“Thanks,” Harry said faintly. His voice sounded steady, and he was thankful for that.
Blaise looked at the card for a second, raising his eyebrows suggestively. Finally, he grinned before pushing the card into his pocket.
Whilst on his travels, he had discovered the joy that was the muggle shopping centre or mall as the Americans called them. This discovery had opened up a previously unknown area of style to him. He had only ever seen some of the muggle-borns in the other houses wearing jeans, but now he had tried them, he could see the appeal. He’d had to reign in his spending, only purchasing a couple of practical items and exercising every ounce of self-control he could muster.
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” He cried with glee, “Knew I would catch you, Gryffindor scum. Hang you, I will, from your thumbs,” he muttered as he rounded the corner.
“Open it,” Harry urged.
“When you’ve visited that place”, He interrupted as he looked into her dark eyes. “When you have been there and felt the overwhelming sense of desolation and despair that still lingers there, even now the dementors are gone, you come back to me and tell me why I should have let him waste away in that hell hole.” Harry still passionately believed that he did the right thing by speaking up for them at the trial.
He could admit to himself that it did seem out of character for anyone looking in. It was the nicest thing he’d done directly to Harry, but despite it all, he still felt the annoyance prick him.
“It was pleasant enough. Did you and Granger enjoy yourselves?” He countered and watched as the redhead grasped for words.
Harry just shook his head before the contagious yawn spread to him.
Draco smiled, feeling the nerves calm and turn to sweet excitement.
Harry stood staring after Malfoy long after his silhouette had disappeared, wondering whether he would return after a walk or whether he had left for good. His nerves danced through his innards like a colony of ants as he began to pace again. The warming charm faded as he ran over the conversation repeatedly; His mind continually returning to a single phrase. No doubt a throwaway comment of no importance, but Harry couldn’t dismiss it. “You always did drive me crazy.” the statement brought a rush of warmth to his stomach and a wave of adrenaline through his veins.
“Oh, Shut up!”
Draco’s heart fell. When he had asked for juicy morsels, he had wanted to hear more about Harry and Ginny. He nodded, feigning interest, not allowing the disappointment to show. The bell at the door rang as four teenagers walked in. Draco assumed they must be older than Hogwarts age, but they didn’t look like it. They occupied a table in the corner, raising the noise level in the fairly quiet room.
“He hasn’t, but that story is legendary!” Said Louis.
Harry blushed again. He took a deep breath as he attempted to change the subject.
Harry nodded, avoiding the blond’s gaze as the silence stretched between them again. Only the whistling of the wind through one of the upper battlements audible between them. It occurred to him that he couldn’t hear the music from within either.
“Ooh, that’s better,” Lune exclaimed as she sat down next to Harry. “Hello Harry,” She smiled, her floaty, lilting voice crooned as she arrived at the table, Hermione close behind her.
“Yeah, Professor Vector said she’s testing us as soon as term starts again. Plus, Arithmancy is fascinating.”
He watched cautiously as he waited for the pair to climb aboard before the woman’s voice started again.
“He didn’t kill anyone, Mione and anyway, he’s an ‘upstanding members of society’ now…” Harry repeated her words back to her, watching as her glare darkened. He sniggered before taking another sip of his whisky.
, to expose more pale swathes of skin. He can just imagine how smooth Malfoy’s skin would be under his palms.
When Harry finally lets himself feel, he lets loose the floodgates holding back everything that he didn’t want to dwell on about Malfoy. Harry’s thoughts turn to long, elegant fingers trailing down the nape of his neck. An easy smile passed between wayward touches and half-lidded stares. The washboard melody of toned muscles beneath Harry’s hands, beneath the faded Bowie shirt he stole from Harry.
Harry only lasts three days of silently brooding about the egg incident before he crumbles. It’s Wednesday’s weekly pub night that finally gives him the opportunity to explode. Ron had been eyeing him warily the entire time at work, as though he was suspicious of Harry’s silence and waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Harry doesn’t reply, turning to Hermione and gesturing back at Ron. “See? This is what I mean, Hermione.”
Draco moans a steady stream of Harry’s name as he’s coming thick stripes over Harry’s fist, some of it hitting him in the chest. Harry joins him not long after, thrusting once, twice, before emptying himself into Draco’s arse with a groan.
His thumb swipes over the head of his cock, and he bites back a groan into his other fist. It’s too easy to imagine that it’s him Malfoy is saying that to. That it’s him causing Malfoy to say his name like that. Easier still to watch it play out in his head, the plunging heat of Malfoy’s arse around his prick, as he drives himself ruthlessly against Malfoy’s prostate while Malfoy cries out for more and faster and
“Potter,” he says, waking Harry up from his daze. “Is there a reason you’re standing in the middle of the hallway? I need to get ready for the party.” When Harry pulls his gaze up, Malfoy is looking at him with an eyebrow raised and a faint tug to his lips.
“Or did you just like knowing I could hear everything?” Harry asks as Draco arches off the sheets, gasping softly. “That I was just on the other side of a wall, listening to every single sound you made?”
“No,” Draco lies, but it’s unconvincing as he writhes.
he thinks, glancing between the two men at the table. As though he needs any more reminders. Harry reluctantly pulls out the seat next to the bloke and sits down before he can think better of it.
“So, are you going to tell me about all the dragons or not? It is a dragon reserve, after all.” Harry chuckled.
“Which witch cast the hex?” Weasley asked them both. Draco shrugged, but Blaise answered.
“That’s great, Nev! Tell her congratulations from us!” Hermione offered with slightly forced enthusiasm. It appeared that the Slytherin wasn’t yet a fan favourite with her either.
“And no tiny details about flowers or food, that’s cheating!” Harry warned. Draco smirked and rolled his eyes.
“I woke up, and this angel had wrapped me in furs. I never did finish the race. I became an apprentice and spent a few summers here, tending the grounds and trying to impress her.” He smiled at her, and Harry suddenly felt awkward in the intimate gaze.
”Good morning. Bet you thought that was hilarious!” Draco grumbled as he reluctantly admired the markings, stroking the soft feathers at its head. It was a handsome owl, to be sure. However, the closer he got, the more scars and old wounds he could see on the bird. Finally, the creature preened under the attention, chirping in delight before offering his leg. Draco took the letter gingerly before stepping back. “I hope you’re a good-news owl. I could do with some kind words today, ” the bird chirruped again, making Draco smile at the friendly bird. He turned to grab some owl snacks scattering them on the side and watching as the owl nibbled happily away.
They paused finally, and he waited for any hint or clue as to where they were. They began moving again and even over his heartbeat; he heard a rusty gate lock behind them. His panic rose higher as the chances of his escape lessened.
“I heard about Astoria,” Harry winced. “I’m very sorry for your loss, both of you,” They both nodded before the room fell into silence.
He set to work getting the rest of the classroom in order and with a few swishes of his wand, the pillows transfigured back into desks.
They all nodded and smiled, Hermione and Ron offering their best sympathetic and supportive smiles. Neville frowned
“I did not. I haven’t taken tea since Mother died,” He paused, feeling a small stab of sadness.
Blaise nodded in agreement. They sat quietly for a moment as Draco mulled this information over. One of the older ladies met his eyes before Draco turned swiftly back to look at Blaise. The younger couple had already left. The teenagers were placing their order with a grumpy looking grey Goblin who could barely see over the table, a wand perched behind his ear. Draco turned his attention back to Blaise.
“I said ‘about’,” Weasley argued with a smirk.
“I think he knows about Charlie,”
“I even brought us dinner,” Harry said as he motioned to the food behind them. “Are you hungry?”
“It’s a long story,” Harry replied, sipping his drink again to avoid speaking further.
Harry rolled over after appreciating the room and gazed at his fiancé. The man was stunning, and it almost killed Harry every time he looked at him. His longer hair now fell across the pillow, creating a messy halo around his sharp face. It was one of the only times he got the chance to see him without a mask. His pale skin seemed to glow in the sunlight, and his eyebrows were so pale that they were almost invisible unless you looked closely. His lips, which had parted slightly, were tinged pink, adding an innocent tone to his peaceful face. Harry bit his lip as he remembered last night. He loved the look of flushed abandon he could produce on the blonds pale features. He pulled the covers up after kissing Draco’s shoulder to make up for the heat loss.
Pushing himself over to assess just how bad the view was from his position, he groaned and covered his face with his hands. He waved his wand and muttered ‘nox’, luxuriating the darkness as the light died around him, taking the decorations with it. It was lucky that he usually went to bed and got up in the dark this time of year. Maybe he could survive the two weeks without hurting Kreacher’s feelings after all.
“Blaise?” Draco asked, blinking against the fuzziness of his vision. He could see his dark complexion, but the features were beyond comprehension.
“Not married yet, I managed to escape the skulduggery of an arranged marriage,” Malfoy sighed. “And I hear that thanks to Minister Shaklebolt and Granger, Blood purity isn’t all that important any more.”
“I was at St Mungo’s on Saturday. Guess who I was with.” Ron announced, drawing in the adult’s attention as he glanced between Harry and Hermione. Hermione shook her head, sending her frizzy curls quivering as she shrugged. Some of the others also shrugged or raised their eyebrows in interest.
Rolf smiled broadly again as he handed back the notebook.
“Sounds magical” Harry replied as he reached for one of the spinach and ricotta tarts. “I’ll have to press Ron for more details.” Draco’s eyes narrowed as he turned to him. Harry laughed and shook his head. “Don’t worry, there’s no point anyway, since becoming an auror he’s become much better at keeping secrets. Bloody sod!” They both laughed.
Harry nodded and looked at his watch. The lesson was coming to a close quicker than he had anticipated. He cleared his throat as he stood, the class fell quiet almost instantly, and he smiled appreciatively at them all.
“Oh, dear.” He said finally. “Looks like Filch has perched himself by the Gryffindor portrait.”
“Stop being negative,” Harry chuckled. “Two weeks left, and then you’ll be unable to get rid of me” Harry brushed a stray strand of hair away from Draco’s face. “Come September; you’ll be pushing me through the floo,”
“No, I meant your wife. I would have thought you’d be married by now,” Malfoy chuckled to himself as if laughing at an in-joke.”What’s so funny? I would have thought you’d be raising a whole manor full of purebloods by now,” Harry said with a smirk.
“He was cold, and it had started to snow.”
“Late night?”
“Harry James Potter! We have been friends since we were eleven, don’t waste your breath trying to lie to me,” She looked disapprovingly at him. “And before you say anything else, it may be worth knowing that Ginny and I have already talked.” She glanced at him. She offered a smile as she reached out and placed her hand on his arm.
“Come on. I want to go home.” Draco lied, letting go of his arm, determined to walk off without him.  His knees buckled after a few steps and only Blaise’s grip on his arm stopped him from hitting the floor. “thanks,” He muttered sullenly as he held onto the wall.
Draco shook his head as he looked down at his hands. His heartbeat had only just returned to normal. He took a breath as he tried to organise his thoughts from the night before.
“I can’t believe that a pureblood like Malfoy would deign even to speak to a blood traitor like your brother!”
They waited as the lift doors opened before pushing through a small crowd gathering at the gates. Most eyes lingered on his white hair before glaring at him. Draco kept his eyes ahead, trying to ignore the feeling as they rounded a corner.
“Malfoy!” Weasley offered calmly as a warning.
He sat down on the bed he’d yet transfigured back to an apple and looked at his clothes cluttering the kitchen walls. He had draped or hung his many suits from every available surface and spelt them to erase the creases, ready to wear at a moments notice. Living in Romania’s wilderness had restricted his need for tailormade refinery; however, he still appreciated how the clothes could create a first impression which words found wanting, like a secret, non-verbal language, spoke subtly to the eyes.
“Love you too,” Harry replied as the portkey activated. He watched as Draco’s face disappeared from view as the world spun away from him.
”Are you asking me on a date, Auror Weasley?”
“Patrik, eh? Is this someone I should be jealous of?” Harry asked, mock suspicion in his voice as he scowled. Draco laughed and shook his head.
“Rolf, Please!” He smiled back, the jovial tone back in his voice as the lift shuddered to a halt.
“Where have you been?” Harry found himself asking. Malfoy looked at him for a moment, his silvery stare looking like he was considering something.
“That’s enough of that at the dinner table,” Noomi smirked. Draco’s cheeks turned pink as he smiled.
“Thirty-two.” Blaise nodded with a snort.
Draco nodded as he looked around the office.  The room could only just accommodate the furniture, the centrepiece being a giant walnut desk. Around the edges of the room, filing cabinets showcased an array of plants and other greenery, making the air in the room smell fresh and sweet. “Good, good.” He beamed as he turned, perching on the edge of the thick desk. His dark eyes looking up at him.
“So what's your plan then, oh great jinx breaker?” She smirked back.
“Firstly, I guess, we could rent out a nice place and have flowers everywhere, we could invite a few more people.” He paused, “I don’t know. Now that I’m saying it out loud, I guess nothing would be different. We’re already inviting all of our family and friends. We’re already holding it somewhere close to home?” He phrased it as a question, hoping to get more information, but Draco remained silent, so he continued “I guess there isn’t really much difference.”
Draco looked down, just in time to see a green leaf slide under one of the coils of the wool. He couldn’t help his laugh as he gently unravelled the material. Gently opening the material revealed the tiny stick figure with dark brown glassy eyes.
He felt a hand on his other arm before he felt the familiar pull from behind his navel. He felt sick as they landed.
The rest of the sentence went without saying. If Harry had stayed with the Auror office, then he would have known all of this information too. If he had remained with the Auror office, he probably would have learned a lot of things, but his stomach and heart spasmed at the thought of it.
“Of course, Kreacher will make this now.” He shuffled off, leaving Harry to his thoughts again. Looking around the kitchen, his eyes landed on the short-eared owl in the corner. Harry looked around but could see no post.
Every action, every thought, adjusted as if Harry was there watching and judging. It was almost laughable. Harry Potter, the ’Savior’, ’Chosen One’ and ’Boy who lived twice’ had virtually become the wizard version of one of the many Muggle Messiahs to him. With his wild dark hair, the thought of Harry fit the images of a lone figure walking through a desert that he’d seen in various Muggle publications over the years.
Harry wondered what their lives would have been like had he taken Malfoy’s hand. He guessed that it wouldn’t have felt as solid and calloused as it had at the reunion. Instead, the skin would have been the soft, supple skin of a child who had never known work. It would have been quite unlike his own. Even at eleven, his hands had been dry and cracked, calloused and sore from the Dursley’s constant chores. He was almost embarrassed to think of what Malfoy would have thought had they shook hands, seeing the state of his own.
“What? From his letters from home?” Draco nodded in response. “Yeah, he used to send photos home with his letters too, got a few good ones of you, Malfoy,” Weasley smirked, and Draco felt things starting to make more sense. Of course, that would be the reason Weasley thought he knew more about him. The thought certainly didn’t fill him with joy as he wondered just what information Charlie had divulged. Knowing the guileless Gryffindor, he’d revealed everything.
“I have never been better!” He nodded with a smile “I’m just trying to remind myself that this is real and that I deserve it,”
“In the kitchen,” She called back.
“You’re getting married?” Noomi asked, her cute face wide and bright with her radiant, beaming smile. He nodded sheepishly.
“And you kept it on?” Asked Hermione incredulously.
“So, enjoying the party?” Malfoy asked eventually.
“No, I mean, yes. Binky belonged to my mother,”
“He isn’t needed to do any work today, is he? If not, I don’t mind stepping in to help.” Surprise passed over the hosts face briefly before being replaced by a wide smile.
“It was acceptable,” He smiled. She snorted and shook her head.
“And you do make me so happy.” Harry murmured against his skin. “I can’t wait for our honeymoon! A whole month of us, together. Where are we going?”  Harry moved his head to look down to Draco.
His eyes, drawn away from the flowers to the darkening figure before him, Patrik, looked beyond him, trying to glean a hint of what the sight could be. His host had mentioned a view which Draco needed to experience before he left. Draco had urged for more information only to be denied by a wink and a tap to the nose. So now he found himself, traipsing through the wild flora, off in search of an experience which he wasn’t entirely sure he was ready to have.
“Neville, It was your wedding. I would have been there regardless if I could have been! Pansy being the bride, had absolutely nothing to do with it!” Harry offered, honestly.
“I’m not too sure,” He said quietly. “I wanted to get Harry something as,” He paused for a moment debating to say it out loud or not “as a wedding gift,” he said finally, avoiding her eyes.
“Nothing,” Malfoy replied with a shrug.
“I don’t have a reply for him at the moment. I’ll respond later.”
Blaise’s chipper voice announced as he carried in the cups. He looked between them as he placed the cups down carefully. His eyes clamped onto Weasley for a moment as if detecting some of the tension in the room.
He almost tripped when a youth appeared at the counter. He looked around to ensure Scorpius was still there as he felt like he had been transported back to Madam Malkins twenty-six years ago. The teen looked at him in curiosity as he grabbed something from the shelf. His dark hair sticking up at all angles. He let out a breath when he noticed that the boy’s eyes were brown.
Closing his eyes against the room, the lights and the mere concept of the tree, he hoped he could hibernate, leaving this year behind. He wasn’t in the mood for all the fuss, but Teddy had told him, in no uncertain terms, that sulking and bouts of melancholy were not permitted. Luckily, Teddy was still at the Weasley’s, so no one was there to police him now.
“How do you know that?” Molly asked, lifting her eyebrow suggestively. “It’s not like any lessons take you down there. Is it?”
“I’m just saying.” Blaise shrugged. “Or maybe he can’t perform anymore?”
“I’m here. How are you feeling?”
He considered some of the other Malfoy properties dotted around the country but kept rejecting the idea. He was back in the land where people knew him as the arrogant, insular Malfoy heir who couldn’t look after himself. Draco wasn’t that child anymore. He had grown up, grown wiser? Maybe. Time would tell. He firmly believed that using his parent’s wealth would be a bad idea, not with the wizarding community watching; Waiting with bated breath for him to fail or slip up, proving them all right that he deserved to be locked up in-. He gulped the word back. Even in his mind, he struggled to say the word. Saying it once tonight was enough, and only his force of will to apologise to Harry had forced that out without stammering like an imbecile.
Draco nodded sadly as he held Harry’s hand.
“You need to turn the coals over and rotate the eggs so that they are kept uniformly warm,” Patrik explained, holding an egg between a pair of toughened dragon hide gloves. Draco knew that the egg would be blisteringly hot. “Any bits of broken egg you see, let me know. We use it for pots.” Draco nodded, reminded of something.
Harry felt a blush rise in his cheeks as he looked into the bowl. It looked like porridge, but the oats were rounder, and she had sliced apple on top. He took a tentative spoonful and after tasting the cinnamon and honey, decided he liked it very much.
“You going for the job, Uncle Harry?” Teddy asked excitedly.
“You think this is a lot; you should come for Christmas, we’ll treat you to a Julbord,” Patrik Smiled.
“So, where is this surprise?” Draco asked as Patrik lit his wand to guide the way.
“She writes a though you are aware of the significance, Master. Binky knows not,” she said as she stepped slowly down from the bed, reminding Draco how old and feeble, she was.
The bird yawned and stretched his wings wide before flapping them gently closed again, then gently plucked the letter from Harry’s hand before stepping towards the ever-open window. Then, with a couple of graceful flaps, he disappeared into the night. Harry darted his eyes towards the clock sitting high on the wall. He knew that the mansion was in Wilshire somewhere so hoped that Peppin would be back before midnight. He owed that blessed owl a couple of mice and vowed to treat him when he could get to Diagon Alley.
“Thank you. It has been my family home for almost ten generations. The land has been ours for hundreds more,”
It was dizzying to watch as the enchanted subjects enacted and re-enacted their parts in the story. Harry looked away before his eyes could settle on the raven-haired figure painted in the centre, a baby one second, a man the next, the lightning bolt scar clear for all to see. He knew that if Professor McGonagall were still headmistress, the new art installation would have been something much less gaudy.
“Much. Thank you,” Harry said as he sat in the chair next to Draco. Draco’s leg was suddenly in line against his under the table, a comforting rub of fabric unseen from view.
“Are you mad?” Ron asked for a second time. “That job literally has your name on!”
“Scandinavian too, eh? We’ll have to get you over for dinner sometime to tell us all about it; you can meet the twins too. You could bring a partner too if you wanted,” He mentioned
“Draco?” Harry asked, and he realised that both he and Scorpius were looking at him.
Draco nodded but not that he understood.
“Ginny Potter. Now she’s a flyer!” Blaise nodded wistfully. “Such passion and ferocity. Makes you wonder what she’s like in the bedroom. Well, maybe not you.” Blaise smirked again, and Draco couldn’t hide the small grimace that crossed his face.
“He’s definitely not; also he is very happily married to a lovely lady called Noomi and has a child on the way, I may be a lot of things, but a home-wrecker, I am not!”
“I don’t know; I guess I had better return it. It looks expensive,” Harry shrugged. “What department did Luna say he was joining?”
He shrugged before knocking the cool liquid back. The urge to gag coming almost immediately, but he managed to swallow through it, consuming the coagulated slime. The taste was at odds with the potions consistency; he could taste the peppermint, first and foremost. However, there were subtle underlying flavours he could detect, such as Feverfew, hops, and Betony. The Betony was hardly surprising as Blaise had provided it.
“Was there something you had in mind?” She asked curiously.
“Mr Malfoy, Can you hear me?”
“He didn’t say anything, which I thought was strange,”
“It’s Malfoy’s” There was silence for a moment where only the pounding of the music beyond the bubble could be heard. Hermione’s eyes grew wide as Ron’s eyebrows raised. Luna looked as dreamy as ever, as though it wasn’t a surprise at all. The silence between them was deafening.
He tried to be comforted by their polite exchange as he took a few more steadying breaths. The lift finally came to a stop at level four, and as the gates opened, his thoughts turned back to work. With sounds of exotic creatures filling the air, he took a single deep breath and decided that today would be a good day. Resigned to his fate, he started towards the Beasts, Being and Spirit Division.
It dawned on him that the description matched the relationship that Teddy and Draco had. Had he been a barrier between them have something closer? He hoped not and vowed to tell Teddy so as soon as he saw him. Blinking long, he realised just how tired he was. Undressing, he collapsed again onto the soft bedcovers. Would Malfoy reply tomorrow? He hoped so as he removed his glasses and placed them on the bedside table before rolling over and drifting off to sleep.
“Right, okay. That’s a story I need to hear! Pansy will be thrilled that you two are getting along,” He smiled as he waited
Bill, Percy and their respective families hadn’t been able to make it to dinner. Still, George and Angelina appeared, followed by their children Fred and Roxanne, bringing the total up to ten Weasleys, one Potter and one Lupin to fit around the dinner table.
“Thank you, Sir.” He replied, his voice sounding shaky
The mediwitch pulled out her wand again, the wand and bone emblem on her tunic twisting as she caused the air to shimmer between it and him. Draco waited, his stomach rolling uncomfortably and his heart thudding in his ears. He felt hot and sweaty now as the cold sensation left him.
“Who’s that?”
“Draco Malfoy,” Ron nodded earnestly. “He’d been attacked in Diagon Alley,”
“Oh, that?” Harry dismissed with a wave of his hand. The surprised look on Malfoy’s face confused him. Surely he couldn’t be thanking him for something that happened so long ago. It was a lifetime ago; Harry had nieces and nephews now, younger than that.
Draco shook his head, knowing that nothing would deter Blaise Zabini from his mission if he chose to sink his teeth into it. Distraction was the best option. He would have to keep Blaise preoccupied.
“My jacket?” Draco replied tonelessly as he felt the blood rush from his face. He kicked himself internally as he tried to think.
“Who’s jacket?” Neville asked, looking from Harry to the other two, “What have I missed?”
He wanted it gone so that he wouldn’t have to admit to himself the thoughts in his head. He had been more than happy living in the figurative closet, and every time he looked at the green blazer, the door to that closet opened up a little more. He was lying to himself, knew it down to the marrow in his bones just as he had always suspected. If he stopped and let himself think and feel, the sudden lack of momentum would shatter the world around him.
Draco smiled and ducked his head in assent.
The mediwitch nodded to each of them in turn before exiting the room, leaving an awkward silence in her absence.
“There are no younglings here, you churlish braggart!”
The snow had started to settle on the floor, coating the courtyard in a fine dusting of white. Trees and fields were becoming more visible in the surrounding darkness as the rest of the world turned white.
“So, looks like good news all around then?” Harry smiled. Malfoy smiled back, and Harry felt his stomach roll on itself in excitement.
“What a feast! What do we have?” Draco asked as he pressed himself against the warmth of Harry’s chest.
Draco turned his head to the voice, only making out a petit figure with dark hair.
They climbed the steps without another word as Patrik held the door open for Harry. The smell of fresh linen lingered on the air, and Harry took a deep appreciative breath. Inside the house, the walls were the same pale colour as in Draco’s Shack; however, this was highlighted and patterned with a mint green making the place look fresh and clean. Bare wood-framed each window adding to the rustic feel. To the left, he caught a glimpse of their living room, with comfortable-looks grey sofas with furs to keep out the winter chill. He stopped as he waited for Patrik to take the lead.
“Fine.” Draco sighed. “One of-”
“That was a joke, but as you’re not laughing, I’m guessing things didn’t go too well?” Blaise’s smirked faltered and disappeared, concern shaping his eyebrows now as they knotted together. He slid off the work surface and lowered himself gently onto the bottom of his bed.
“You’re probably right; you are very annoying,”
“I think you may win the bet,” Patrik said as he too sat down around the pine table.
Harry smiled and ducked his head sheepishly as he sat down. He realised he had been staring. Noomi was cute in the fact that she was pretty but also small and petit. The only things large about her was the white knitted jumper and the size of her pregnant belly. A cup of tea landed before him and another in front of Patrik.
“Rose, you should know by now, your dad never wastes food,” Harry said to the eldest Granger-Weasley child.
Peppin was asleep on his perch, and it was clear that the owl was getting old. Harry wondered whether this was a mistake, remembering the Weasley’s old bird, Errol. He thanked Merlin that Peppin seemed to be handling his old age with slightly more grace.
“You don’t have to give me an answer now, of course. Just drop us a fire call before you come over, or send an owl if you’re unable to make it. We’ll leave a space set at the dinner table for you, in any case.”
They travelled down the busy corridors, picking up speed as Draco’s body remembered how to work. He still clung to Blaise, mind still racing and fuzzy. They stopped suddenly in front of a counter, a stern mediwizard looking up at him expectantly. It took Draco a few moments to realise that they were at the dispensary, not the welcome desk, thanks to the desktop’s wooden sign.
“I didn’t think you bought into the festivities,”
“Which was when?”
“So,” He cleared his throat to clear the image of the ear-loving critters. “May I ask? What is it that I am to do?”
All too quickly, the time of Harry’s portkey back to Hogwarts loomed. Noomi and Patrik had already bid their goodbyes as they left Draco and Harry, allowing them some privacy. They sat on the steps of the large house, the stars beginning to make their appearance.
“Thanks, Arthur. I’ll speak to Gin about it. I don’t want to do anything yet as she deserves a right to have her say too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right, I’d better get back; I’ve got things to sort out before bed.”
The loud throbbing music stopped, causing Harry to be wrenched from his thoughts with a blazing blush up his neck. Someone announced a short interval as the room’s lighting changed, the contrast between dark and light hurting his eyes. The sudden loss of music made him feel deaf as he saw people moving and only faintly hearing them go by. The recently transfigured food tables and bar swarmed with people, hiding them from view completely. He saw Hermione’s hair first, followed closely by Ron’s sweaty red hair as they wove their way towards him.
“So, what are you going to do with the jacket?” Ron asked, darting a glance back to Hermione. Harry felt the embarrassment bubble inside him at the question. What would he do with the jacket?
Harry went to open his mouth to reply when Luna began to speak.
“Thanks, you decided where we’re going yet?
“Can’t see anything at all or can’t see in focus?” Weasley asked.
Harry looked down at his drink and sighed again. He wished he could be angry with her, but he couldn’t find it in him. Even catching them in the middle of their passionate infidelity had proved it. He had seen them, naked and hungry for each other, as her body pressed against his. He had lingered as long as it had taken his brain to comprehend before he had turned tail and retreated to the kitchen. He had waited, not as long as he had expected, for Ginny to emerge. Orion had left shortly after, sheepishly apologising before disappearing into the night.
“What about you, Nev?” Harry smiled, trying to tune out the thoughts of his many failures.
Draco gingerly shook his head as he touched the growing welt on his face. Maybe today wasn’t going to be as good after all.
“What?” Draco snapped harshly. He regretted it instantly and tried to soften his tone. “What were you going to say?”
“Great new, Neville,” Hermione beamed. “You’ll do an amazing job.”
“As I was saying, It appears that you were attacked and struck with a rather nasty variation of the Somnus delorum hex, which included confundus-like symptoms. I have just administered a general decoction of cornflower and snowdrop for the cloudy eye complaint and the confusion. There may be some lingering dizziness. However, we should be able to discharge you within the next hour or so. Do you understand?”
He pulled the clear lid from the golden ball and picked up the snitch. The wings sprang open and unfurled slowly before shimmering writing appeared on the surface.
“Not normally, Master” she replied squeakily.
This chapter may need a bit of back story if you haven't read All The Wrong Choices already.
“No, just thinking. I’ve been looking over the files you gave me. Thought I’d try and get a head start on the new year.“
Draco had loved the birds, he thought as he took his mind sharply in a different direction, barely avoiding another collision with the past. Draco couldn’t wait to get rid of the manor. The place was like a muggle time bomb with detonators everywhere. The smallest thing could be the catalyst for another panic attack. He had only been able to tolerate living there due to his mother’s presence and distractions, but with her now gone, the place held no comfort for him. Voldemort had seen to that. Draco had decided that if he were going to attempt to stay in England, he would need to move. He felt a slight pang of guilt, something that the younger Draco would have obsessed over, but he wasn’t that person anymore.
“Exactly what I said.” Said Blaise slapping his hand on the table for emphasis. “Again, According to Lucasta, they’re going to be recruiting from Hogwarts if they haven’t signed someone already. They must think Harris is getting a bit old.”
“Are you ready for lunch?” Draco nodded. But before they could leave, there was a loud crack behind him. Draco spun around only to come face-to-face with a house elf. Pepin, the owl, squawked loudly and flapped his wings in fright at the intrusion.
“Wow! Well done, Mate.” Ron announced enthusiastically.”Things really are going well for you!”
“Sorry about that! The last boy in here really clashed with a maple and dragon heartstring…” the voice said as he turned around. Draco met those vibrant but surprised eyes and felt the bottom fall out of his world.
He was relieved to come home to an empty house. As Ginny had thrown herself into training, he would often find himself alone. The relief of not needing to keep up the pretence in front of people was ineffable.
“You know, you could always write us a note saying that we’d be in detention.” Victoire pointed out.
“How? When?” He spluttered.
Draco saw Harry’s bag and sighed with relief. It hadn’t been a dream. He smiled for a second as he recalled their evening, but curiosity stopped him.
“Busy with training, I suspect, she is a very good chaser. The Harpies are lucky to have her.”
“He’s an amazing chef!” Said Draco eagerly as he waved his empty fork around. “He once made a roast duck with a pomegranate glaze, and it was superb!” Draco smiled, eyes hazy as if remembering. “And what this man can do with chocolate-”
He felt moved, a warm sensation soothing the cold loneliness felt moments before.
“You’re not broken, Harry. But I think your relationship has been for a long time,” she reached forward and held her hand out. He took it and squeezed as he felt his throat tighten. “That relationship is in the past; it doesn’t matter who did what or when. You can focus now on what you truly want in life, whether its women or not. Now that it’s over, you can move on.” He nodded as his eyes scanned the room again. He was just about to ask what she meant about wanting something other than women when a flash of white caught his eye. As his internals tightened and his heart rate increased, he knew that colour. He caught sight of an angular jaw and a pointed nose and felt his breath stutter in mid-inhale. His eyes travelled up, now actively looking for the unmistakable white-blond glint and felt his heart falter. His mouth grew dry as he tried to swallow.
“Please, call me Rolf.” He said.
“Italy, as I said.” Smiled the voice, the arrogance and calm filling the air.
“My wife said he wouldn’t rise until noon today. It looks like she might be right,” He chuckled.
“We’ve been married about ten years now,” Weasley said
“Now, now ladies, that kind of behaviour is unbefitting, don’t you think?” He smiled charmingly.
Draco closed his eyes to hide the glint of hope. Blaise snorted dismissively, not paying too much attention to him.
“It’s ok; It was a long time ago. I barely remember her.”
“Noomi, this is Harry Potter,”
“Hi Mr Malfoy, How are you feeling?” Came another voice. Draco’s eyes shifted to the left and noticed the red hair instantly.
He crashed face-first on the bed, relieved that his retinas could rest in the darkness. He lay for a moment, feeling his hot breath warm the covers around his face as he pressed it deeper. He considered removing them with his wand but knew that Kreacher’s feelings would be hurt. He didn’t think he could deal with a moping house-elf.
“Disgusting,” Draco admitted as he lay back on the bed.
“Good Evening, Pep,” Harry muttered to the bird and smiled when the owl chirruped back at him. “I’ve got another letter for Draco Malfoy if you wouldn’t mind taking it, please?”
The owl tilted his head again, gazing at Draco with bright yellow eyes before flapping his wings. Finally, Draco reached and opened up the window again and watched as the bird hopped up and swooped off into the morning mist.
“I suppose not; it has been a long time.” Granger nodded.
“Eleven,” Hermione added, throwing a slight glare at him.
“Well, a witch disappeared in the Hebridean mountains a few months ago, a muggle couple a few months before that and possibly some livestock from the surrounding areas. Normally, it wouldn’t be much cause for concern; however, there seems to be a growing number of muggle sightings of creatures on the ridges. Unfortunately, no remains have been recovered, and no one has seen anything concrete. We need to investigate whatever is causing the disappearances and deal with it accordingly. The role for which you have been hired is to head the investigation.”
“I am sorry. You are not what I expected at all,” Patrik gave an approving nod before speaking again “Noomi will like you,” He nodded and grinned “Come and meet her and I will tell you what I need help with,”
“Maybe you should brush up on these hexes just in case you ever do feel like taking the defence job at Hogwarts,” Ron added with a smirk.
“Not sure that’s the right job for me. Thanks anyway, Neville.”
“That’s it, Welch!” He called as he noticed a particularly well-executed jinx. The small auburn-haired girl smiled and blushed slightly as her partner picked himself up from the mound of cushions. “You alright, Michaels?” The boy nodded with a grimace as he rubbed his chest. He looked around and caught the eye of the three Weasley first years, Louis, Lucy and Roxanne. They grinned at him, and he nodded slightly back. He thanked his stars that they were good during his lessons as he’d heard some of the other teachers. Whether that was down to the fact that he was family, that his classes were fun or that he could tell all their parents, he chuckled to himself at the thought as Roxanne sent her partner flying. The poor girl missed the cushions and landed with a thump. Harry grimaced and stood up, but Roxanne was already there helping the girl to her feet.
“I don’t-”
Zabini said something else, the cut of his light suit hugging his body as he posed against the wall. In response, Malfoy bent over double, laughing. Harry could almost hear the sound beyond the chatter and clatter of people around them. He didn’t think he had ever seen Draco laugh like that as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Maybe he doesn’t anymore, Harry thought bitterly, thinking about everything going wrong in his own life. Blaise looked up, and their eyes met. A rush ran down his spine as if doused in cold water. Zabini’s smooth, dark face sobered up as his mouth moved. It was Malfoy’s turn to react. Harry watched as his muscles tensed and his lips thinned before he tugged and arranged his waistcoat.
“Don’t worry, Love. My dangerous days are behind me. I’m just a lowly professor now.” He smiled, and Draco knew that he had never been happier.
“We all saw it when we went to Diagon Alley the other weekend; I knew you would when Ron suggested it.”
“What? Why?” Harry asked, drawing himself out of his memories.
“Salazar! I am remiss in my duty to keep you grounded, Potter. Let me make amends. You really must do something about that bird’s nest; I can’t believe your wife let you leave the house like that.” Malfoy snorted.
“Where’s all of Aunt Gin’s stuff? I went into the bathroom, and almost everything has gone except for your toothbrush.” Harry sat back, the dread building, as he took a deep breath. He knew that he should have told Ted everything before, but there never seemed to be the right time.
Draco nodded as Harry’s hand slid out of his. He held the clothes peg tightly, his eyes trained on Draco.
Draco pulled the shirt over his head and proceeded to remember Harry making them dance around their kitchen as he sang, ‘talk dirty to me.’ Draco felt the laugh tumble out of his mouth in the silence of the chalet. It was one of his favourite memories. Harry had been cooking a Sunday roast dinner, and Draco had been fussing over something. He couldn’t remember what now, something inconsequential, no doubt. Harry had taken the opportunity to grab Draco and spin him around the kitchen and dining room, singing the song word for word. Draco had blushed and laughed so hard as he’d tried to escape from his awful muggle dancing.
Harry waved as he left the great hall, waving to some of the others as he went. He looked back to find Neville and Hermione still looking at Ron in shock. He snorted with a shake of his head as he pushed through the large doors and into the cold winter air again.
Harry couldn’t help the eye roll and smirk as he appeared in the doorway, and the children let out a sigh of relief.
“Exactly, then again, it could be worse, I’ve got no spoilt, entitled brats this year. That would be awful.  Don’t have time to be chasing all my students around to see if they’re up to something.” Harry retorted smugly
“I think I’m broken, Mione.” He said finally, still staring into his empty glass. It felt like he was the glass, fragile and empty. She waited for him to continue before she said anything. “I’m not angry about it, but I feel like I should be. I’m happy for her, but I feel like it’s all my fault,” He paused as he glanced at her again. “I’m relieved it’s over, but I’m scared to be alone.” He took a deep, shuddering breath as he acknowledged the truth he’d said.
“I do. Would you mind if I accompany you?” Rolf beamed as he shook his head.
“That was a joke, Potter,” Malfoy said softly. “Although, where is the lovely Weaslette?”
He looked up as he waited for Hermione to tell him that he was a freak, but she didn’t say a word. Her eyes gleamed more as he saw the tears gather, but she remained silent. “Since she joined the team, I’ve barely seen her. We don’t talk any more. I don’t love her anymore, and I’m wondering whether I ever truly did,” He ran his fingers through his hair to hide the tremor as he sat back “things just aren’t as simple as they were in school” He shook his head sending his unruly, salt and pepper hair even more askew. He glanced around the room, looking for Ron as he twirled the cool tumbler in his hands, listening to the remainder of the ice clink against the glass walls. He desperately needed another drink.
“You want another?” He offered with an eager nod. He felt like getting utterly smashed. With a nod, Ron disappeared back through the crowd again. The first clue that he’d been caught in Hermione’s trap was her deep sigh.
Harry regarded his godson with a stare that would make an Auror jealous before looking at his watch.
“Don’t try that with me, Fred. I knew your dad and uncle in school. It’s the ‘Or anything’ I’m worried about.”
“I am not getting you lot out of this one. You get caught, on your own heads be it. If I get caught, the one year jinx of my job goes unbroken.”
He hastened his steps as though being chased, feeling closed in by the two columns of conifers pressing in on both sides. The irrational fear resurfacing from childhood, climaxing as he ran out of harm’s way, well outside of the trees reach. He turned back to look at the looming wall of branch and shadow and remembered how, as a child, he’d thought that an inferius would reach out and snatch him if he didn’t walk quick enough. He shuddered, fear flashing up his spine before it was gone. He chided himself, knowing he was being childish. He tried to take a deep breath to steady himself as he turned to face the still, oppressive manor again. The tall, daunting turrets stood black and solid against the moonlight.
“Dad tells stories about Uncle Fred sometimes.” Roxanne said sadly, “I wish we’d met him.”
Draco opened his eyes sharply and looked at Weasley, who had the good grace to blush.
“So you both finally went through with the divorce?” Ted asked calmly. Hary felt his heart stop as he looked at the lanky teen in front of him.
“Stop freaking out,” Blaise said kindly as he pushed the cup into his trembling hands. “What’s going on in that head of yours?”
“Have you had enough, dear?” she asked discreetly. Harry realised he’d forgotten his food, not that he had much of an appetite. He glanced around and noticed that everyone else was busy in their own conversations. Only Ron and Hermione watched on, the same worry bearly hidden on their faces. He smiled weakly as he turned back to Molly.
“Fine, sir,” she muttered before running back to Roxanne.
“Where is Ollivander’s now?” Scorpius asked, turning curious grey eyes to his father. There was no mistaking him for anything other than a Malfoy. However, certain angles and expressions reminded him so much of Astoria.
They were all sat in the kitchen again, around the pine table, talking as Harry entered. He placed his bag down as they turned to him. He smiled at them all before his eyes went to Draco’s. He watched as Draco’s dove-grey eyes did their usual cycle, lingering over the slim peek of flesh where his t-shirt rode up as he continued to rub his hair. He watched as Draco’s fine, pink tongue whipped out to wet his lips before disappearing again. Harry smirked as Draco’s eyes found his again. The pale berry blush had already appeared along his cheeks before he turned his head with a smirk at being caught.
“Is that something to do with what you need help with, by any chance?”
“I need you,” Harry desperately muttered, as he withdrew his fingers. Draco whimpered as the boy-who-lived positioned himself before sliding home. Hot and slick, he was suddenly full to bursting as Harry pulled on his shoulders, burying himself to the hilt. Draco cried out; his mind overwhelmed with every touch and caress.
“I’m trying to write a letter, and I just can’t get it started.” He explained, peeking at his godson from between his fingers. “I may have to pop out to Diagon Alley soon and get more paper.”
He stared at the raised pink skin, the outline of the skull still visible in the firelight. Shiny white skin stretched against the perfect alabaster flesh. He loathed the sight of it. Hated that it was still visible, like a permanent brand on his life. Another hitch in his breathing disrupted his thoughts as his diaphragm ached. The knot that tightened and twisted in his stomach rose higher, and he knew he was going to be sick. He managed to rise and rush to the sink before more poison purged from his body. Nothing but liquid, pretty much all his body had seen in days.
“Good night, Harry” Ron winked again. “Owl us if you’d like to meet up.”
“It’s all he ever talks about; I swear,” She complained, a smirk pulling at the corner of her lips. Harry knew that as much as she might protest, she wouldn’t have her life any other way. Silence fell between them for a moment as he pondered whether to let slip about his feelings or apparent ‘lack of’ on the matter. “Are you alright?” Hermione asked before he could speak. “You could have spoken to us at any point, you know? We love you both.” Harry nodded, avoiding Hermione’s gaze. He took a deep breath before he felt his words pour out in what would be the closest to a confession, he could bear
“Do you care?” He asked, his voice rumbling now. The primal tone it had taken made any resistance Draco would have had, dissolve.
“You know, Bill and Fleur might start getting annoyed if you keep owling Victoire. You know how protective Bill can be.”
