“Tough luck, mate,” he whispered in Harry’s ear. “I thought she was a shoo-in for Juliet. Ah well, guess it doesn’t matter if you get cast as Romeo anymore.”
“Bringing us our breakfast.” Harry sat cross-legged on the bed next to Draco and began pulling the contents out of the bag.
As the students parted and made their way to their respective rooms for the evening, Neville nudged Harry on the arm and asked, “There’s a bar on the first floor. Luna and I are going to check it out—you guys fancy joining us?”
the week before the summer holidays, but the play had magic in it, so naturally I wasn’t allowed to see it.”
“But we weren’t canoodling!” Harry cried after her in protest. Draco shook his head in disbelief and attempted to sort his hair in the train window’s reflection.
Knowing he had more than overstayed his welcome now, Harry got to his feet and headed for the exit, wondering if he’d see Dennis at the Gryffindor breakfast table in the morning, or if this was the last time he’d ever see him again on school premises.
Several of the other students seemed to have forgotten that they were supposed to be in character as they stopped to watch Harry reach out to Draco and touch his hand.
Harry raised a surprised eyebrow at Draco. The one and only time Draco had previously attempted to engage in small talk with Harry was during their very first time meeting at Madam Malkin’s when they were eleven. That attempt had been as tactful as this one.
“I suppose only time will tell. It’ll all depend on how you perform on the night, won’t it?” said Theo lazily before his eyes stilled. He cast a furtive glance at Draco before continuing as casually as possible, “‘It has also come to our attention that Mister Malfoy is taking even greater strides to rebuild his image in the public eye. True to his family reputation, he seems to have developed a taste for famous witches
“Old issues of The Prophet,” she shrugged. “They’re forever taking photographs of you two, so there were plenty to choose from. I tried to pick two of the nicer ones.”
Harry, who had only a moment before been floating on cloud nine, unceremoniously crashed back to reality. “What do you mean?”
Ron clapped Harry reassuringly on the shoulder, “No problem! I suppose we better get to Transfiguration class, at least it’ll be a Malfoy-free lesson.”
Ron opened his mouth to speak, then seemed to think better of it and quickly closed his mouth again. He gave a careless shrug and crossed his arms. “Alright, even if that isn’t the case, I think it’s worthwhile reminding you that Malfoy’s been nothing but a foul git since the day we met him. Have you forgotten how hellish he’s made life for you here over the years?”
The wind had died down and the high street was much quieter now, all of the students having returned to the castle and most of the shops now closed for the evening. They walked up the dark dirt path towards Hogwarts in amiable silence for a few moments before Hestia playfully nudged Liv with her shoulder.
“Bugger,” she growled, bumping her head against the door in frustration. Her peaked hat was sitting off-kilter atop her head and her grey hair was sticking out in odd directions. “If I ever cross paths with George Weasley again, he will rue the day he invented those blasted Canary Creams...”
She didn’t know what Liv had won hers for—there were too many hearings, award ceremonies and memorials to keep track of in the last few weeks to remember them all—but she supposed Kingsley had a good reason to give her one. It was only on Kingsley’s suggestion that she was even considering Liv for the position of Muggle Studies Professor. The Prophet were right about one thing—Minerva didn’t want to repeat history by installing a Ministry strawman in her school just so that they could spy on or undermine her. Not that she really believed Kingsley would do that; he was a good man, loyal to the Order and a long-time friend of Minerva’s. That was the only reason she had even agreed to interview Liv. The Prophet had once again jumped the gun—there was no guarantee that Liv had the position yet. She would have to convince Minerva that she was up to the task first.
No. Theo didn’t know anything. He was only saying that he did because he was trying to get a rise out of Draco.
“That’s great,” said Harry, absent-mindedly stroking Asha, who remained curled up on his lap. “I’ll need at least an Exceeds Expectations in Herbology if I’ve got any chance of joining the Auror Academy.”
“It’s your line,” she hissed out of the corner of her mouth. Goyle looked flustered at being addressed and gave his head a quick shake.
Harry grinned and punched Draco lightly on the arm. “Shut up about my hair, will you? I actually like it as it is.”
Draco began to wonder if he had miscalculated the moment, but if there had been a moment then it had Disapparated as quickly as it had arisen. Deciding that he was attributing too much meaning to Harry’s friendly behaviour—
He regretted the words as they came out of his mouth and he realised that, once again, he had let his temper get the better of him. Myrtle’s eyes widened with shock and welled with translucent tears. Guiltridden, Draco’s shoulders sagged and he turned to face her.
Trying his best to ignore Draco, Harry distracted himself by watching the pins and fabric set to work and slowly a set of long, black school robes began to take shape. He couldn’t help but notice Draco’s eyes darting up to look at him, narrowing, then flitting back down at his own feet.
off of the shelf, she opened it at the section detailing how to ask the object of your affections out on a date:
“I don’t want you to get the wrong impression of me,” Liv continued. “What they quoted me as saying in the article, they twisted my words: I merely confirmed that I had put my name forward for the position. I wouldn’t presume to think that I had gotten the job before seeing you about it personally.”
“Saint George and the Dragon,” Neville explained. Luna tugged on two pull strings sewn into the arms of her costume and the large green, bat-like wings on her back began to flap.
Draco watched as Goyle lumbered towards the Matron, closely followed by Neville and Luna, who—still wearing her dragon costume—practically skipped towards the hospital wing as though she didn’t have a care in the world. Hermione squeezed Ron’s hand and gave him a reassuring smile before leaving her seat and hurrying after her friends, leaving her boyfriend alone.
“What if Juliet was a boy?” Hermione suggested. “It would introduce a whole new dimension to the love affair! By all accounts, Romeo and Juliet’s relationship is already the perfect example of a queer romance: the fact that they transgress the norm by falling in love with someone outwith their respective kinds and engage in a forbidden relationship, the philosphical debate behind the weight of names of identity…the play provides a perfect critique of the heteronormative society surrounding them in Verona!”
Neville nodded vigorously, “We spent a lot of time together over the summer and, I dunno, something just...sparked.”
“Why not?” Harry explained to Ron that in the Muggle world, some Muggles held the same prejudiced attitude towards gay people as some wizards had about Muggles. Ron pulled the same indignant expression as Ginny had done when he had told her the very same thing. “Bloody hell. Your aunt and uncle, were they like that too?”
“Absolutely! Trust me on this, mate. We’ll get you the role of Romeo if my life depends on it. I’ll even help you rehearse the scene.”
His booming voice seemed to snap them out of their trance. Several Death Eaters drew their wands and hurried forward to try and put the fire out.
Draco fixed a smirk to his face as his heart began to beat harder in his chest. “For once the rumours about me are true. Unfortunately, the stories about me eloping with Myron Wagtail were pure hearsay. His loss, I say.”
The scene dissolved and a quick succession of memories followed: they cut between Liv doing her best to make herself invisible at work and avoiding Yaxley and Umbridge, while her evenings were spent in her small bedroom listening avidly to
“And more importantly than any of that, I want to do something good,” she continued. “For once in my life, I want to be a positive influence, to use my knowledge and experience to help others, and this job provides me with the perfect opportunity to do that.”
“The Ministry and I have come to an impasse,” she replied evasively. “I want to take my career in a new direction. It’s a year of fresh starts for everyone, including myself. I’m sure you can understand that.”
“I’m fine,” Harry assured them. “The bandages are the most annoying thing. I can’t pick up a quill so I haven’t been able to write anything all day.”
“...and finally, I am delighted to announce that this Valentine’s Day will be an extra special one,” Professor McGonagall continued. “For the last three months, our final year students have been hard at work readying a production of the Muggle playwright, William Shakespeare’s, most famous works,
While they sat and had their lunch, Narcissa quizzed him with the usual questions: how were his lessons going, and how was the train journey to London? Draco kept his answers brief: everything was going well, the train journey was fine, and there was absolutely nothing of note to share with her. Not a single thing. He picked at his individual strawberry and almond tart when the conversation took a predictable turn.
Harry threw another missile but just as it was about to land inside the bedpan it veered wildly off to the right seemingly of its own accord. Harry frowned, confused at what had just happened while Draco struggled to smother his laughter. Brushing it off, Harry tried again only for the same thing to happen. He threw a suspicious glance at Draco who tried to look innocent but was struggling to hide the smile that threatened to spread across his face.
“I look ridiculous!” he cried, gesticulating wildly at his gaudy appearance. “I told you that I didn’t want to wear a dress.”
“I’ve taken the precaution of marking down on the maps where the hotel is just in case you struggle to find your way back,” she explained. “And your Muggle currency is in the envelope—remember, they use pound sterling here, that’s pennies and pounds instead of your usual Knuts, Sickles and Galleons. If you have any issues, Professor Jones and I will be in the Gilbert Scott suite on the third floor.”
Liv’s smile faltered. “Well, not exactly.” Ron looked less than enthused at the prospect of watching Shakespeare performed outwith normal school hours, but Liv quickly added, “It wouldn’t be just any performance of
“And you will,” Liv assured her. “In a couple of pages’ time, when Gregory and Sampson fight Abraham. Just reign it in a little bit until we reach the actual fight scene. Yes, Mr Goyle, do you have a question?”
Draco sat on one of the stadium benches, unconsciously thumbing the edge of his script as he watched Harry and Theo resume rehearsing their big fight scene in which Romeo kills Tybalt in a fit of furious grief. In truth, he was only half-watching the fight; Draco had seen the pair perform the scene enough times now that he knew the lines and choreography by heart. Instead, his gaze kept drifting over to Dennis who stood off to the side and out of sight of everyone else, painting one of the background set pieces. Liv had tried her best to get Dennis to participate in the play—she’d even given him a speaking role that would open up the performance—but Dennis remained reluctant to take part in any shape or form. For the time being, she had resorted to giving him small tasks on his own, such as painting scenery and running errands for her.
“What do you think?” Harry asked as he peeled off his heavy school robes and tossed them onto the chair beside his bed. Draco stood awkwardly by the door taking in his new and unfamiliar surroundings.
When Hermione released Draco, Ron stepped forward and held out his hand to him. Draco eyed it warily for a moment before finally taking it into his own.
The pair sat at the large oak table in the centre of the room while a squadron of servants went about completing their daily tasks, which included preparing their lunch, washing dishes and polishing the extensive silver collection. They had a perfectly functional dining room on the ground floor. They had a perfectly functional dining room on the ground floor, but the Malfoys rarely used it anymore. A healthy appetite was hard to maintain when rather than a bowl of mashed potatoes, all you could see was the lifeless stare of your murdered professor. To be honest, Draco had avoided venturing anywhere in the Manor beyond the confines of his bedroom since that time. Even though Voldemort and the Death Eaters had long since departed, his home still felt tainted by everything that had happened here.
“He said that it was urgent,” Harry pressed, keen to end this reunion with Snape as quickly as possible. Snape’s thin lips twisted into a tight smile.
Professor Sprout left the Hospital Wing wishing Harry a speedy recovery and promised him that he would have plenty of homework on the proper methods of handling fire seeds to catch up on when he was well again. Meanwhile, Madam Pomfrey pulled several bottles from a nearby medicine cabinet and proceeded to mix various potions and ointments to treat Harry’s wounds. Draco pretended to be reading his script but watched out of the corner of his eye as Harry, with some difficulty, peeled off his robes and shirt and allowed the matron to begin treating him. Draco felt the heat rise in his cheeks when Harry moaned in relief as the matron began applying cool salve to his injured arms. He tried to focus on the lines that he had to learn but he couldn’t concentrate on anything but those obscene and annoying breathy noises Harry was making.
“Suit yourself.” Harry shrugged. Scooping Asha up into his hands he addressed the ferret. “Can you make your way back up to Gryffindor Tower or do you need me to come with you?”
Minerva rolled her eyes and continued, “Right or wrong, when it comes to Slytherins and Death Eaters, people have an unfortunate habit of conflating the two. Slytherin has always set itself apart from the other Houses, but this…” She shook her head slowly, looking despondent. “The animosity that students will face when they return to Hogwarts will go way beyond mere inter-house rivalry for the House Cup or winning the Quidditch Cup...people died, Albus. The students were traumatised and abused by members of staff. Students were instructed to torture and report on each other for perceived treachery, and most of those involved were from Slytherin. It’s going to be an uphill battle trying to restore their reputation.”
Harry frowned and sat upright. “No right? You’ve spent hours waltzing around in my head seeing my worst memories. I manage to get past your defences for a split second and you freak out!”
They came to a stop a few meters away from the Apothecary and Harry groaned. Several journalists and photographers were standing outside the shop looking around impatiently for someone—looking for Harry. Ron turned around and began heading back up the cobbled street.
“I’d be crying too if I were sorted into Slytherin,” Ron said grimly. “I’m surprised McGonagall doesn’t just disband their house altogether.”
“Somehow I seriously doubt that,” he muttered, snatching his script off of Liv’s desk and spinning on his heel, pausing when Liv called after him.
Liv’s plan might have been a failure but she wasn’t going to give up so easily. With nobody else to turn to, in her desperation, she had resorted to consulting books on relationships and dating for ideas. Too embarrassed at the prospect of being caught purchasing one of the self-help guides, she had taken to visiting the bookshop every weekend, perusing love guides for sound advice. So far, her search had been a fruitless one.
Confused by that cryptic reply, Harry opened his mouth to ask what the hell he was implying, but quickly closed it as, without warning, Snape’s head dipped out of the frame for a few seconds. When he reappeared a few moments later, any amusement that had been written across his face was now gone. “The Headmistress will see you now.”
“I didn’t see anything,” said Harry quickly, hoping to de-escalate the argument that was about to erupt. “I hate to say it but he’s really good at Occlumency. I couldn’t get past his defences.”
“So, are you going to tell me what you’re dressing up as?” asked Harry for what must have been the hundredth time. Draco smirked and shook his head.
They spent the rest of the afternoon rehearsing their lines, only stopping when Madam Pomfrey came over with two large trays with steak and kidney pies for their dinner. She still looked a little miffed but less so than she had done earlier in the day. Evidently, seeing her patients studying had somewhat softened her mood. Draco was happy to continue rehearsing with Harry for the rest of the evening. It surprised him how easy Harry was to work with when he wasn’t being a self-righteous git, so he was a little disappointed when Harry’s friends showed up shortly after dinnertime to check in on him. Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna and Ginny all piled into the Hospital Wing, surrounding Harry’s bed and chatting animatedly to him while Draco pretended to read his script.
He turned to Luna, expecting her to agree or, perhaps, offer a viable alternative. He did not expect her to close her eyes, point her finger out directly in front of her, and proceed to spin in a circle several times.
While the station was busy (that shouldn’t have surprised him considering there was only days to go before Christmas) what took him aback was the noise: he could hear alarms blaring in the distance, children screaming, car horns honking, the rumble of traffic and screeching tires on wet tarmac. All these other sounds were drowned out by an echoey voice that suddenly blared overhead, alerting the Muggles to long delays from Cambridge.
Draco frowned. “So despite the Friar’s noble intentions, it was all for naught. Tybalt’s hatred won out in the end and everyone died. What exactly is the point of it all, then?”
Happy Valentine's Day, everyone! This week's chapter is short and sweet, I promise next week's will be more substantial. Enjoy!
“Exactly!” she said brightly. “Your parents got over that little snafu with You-Know-Who, I’m sure they’ll get over you having a boyfriend.”
Draco felt his stomach drop at those words but he kept his expression impassive. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Do you want me to come with you?” she offered, but Harry shook his head. She let out a tired sigh and rose to her feet. “Alright, I’ll leave you boys to talk it out amongst yourselves. Send a messenger spell if you need me.” She hesitated a moment before adding, “He might be less than understanding about your relationship with Draco, but he won’t abandon you, Harry. You’re his best friend. We both just want what’s best for you.”
“I understand that your parents’ opinion matters to you, but wouldn’t they just be glad that you’re happy?” she asked gently. Draco gave a derisive snort.
Harry took the drinks over first, placing his cup on the bedside table before handing the other to Draco, who still had his eyes closed but was sitting up in bed now. His bed head was evident now as one side of his fair hair was sticking up on one side. Harry felt a wave of affection for him then and leaned over the bed to press a quick kiss to Draco’s lips before going to retrieve the rest of their food.
Harry didn’t reply. It was difficult to admit but the same thought had crossed his mind on more than one occasion. He couldn’t quite fathom why Dumbledore, who professed to love and care for Harry, would choose to leave him in abject misery for so many years. Yes, there was the matter of the blood bond that kept him safe, but did it really mean that Dumbledore—or anyone else, for that matter—couldn’t have stepped in and spoken to the Dursleys about how they were treating him? Even if it didn’t make a difference, had anyone even tried? When he had been a child, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened. As he grew older, Harry had become resigned to his miserable situation. Little did he know that he did, in fact, have people out there that could have helped him—they had simply chosen not to.
Harry read the contents of the poster aloud. “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Presents ‘Romeo and Julien’...”
“The Dursleys weren’t exactly connoisseurs of the theatre,” he explained. “I almost saw one of his plays once: my school arranged for everyone to go and see
“Brilliant plan, mate,” Ron exclaimed, slapping Harry on the back. “Doing two auditions means twice the chance of getting cast in the top role! Genius.”
“I know that this is a daunting task so I’m going to ease you into this,” said Hestia. “Everyone, pair up with someone that you know and, ideally, trust.”
“Well, clearly none of that bothers Harry,” she consoled. “You like him. He likes you...sounds like you’re pretty compatible to me.”
“Hmm, anything in particular from the Dating Section that caught your eye?” Hestia asked lightly. Liv felt a blush creep up her cheeks.
Umbridge’s slack mouth stretched into a false smile. “Good. Well, I’m here with important and exciting news for you, Miss Tonks: you’re getting a promotion.”
“There’ll be no need for parchment and quills today,” she said brightly. “I’ve got a little surprise for all of you. Everyone follow me.”
Ron shrugged. “I dunno, maybe. I guess you never know what’s going on in people’s private lives. Whatever it was, it was enough to spook Neville. Hey! Maybe he saw Goyle’s memories of Snape, that would give me the willies, too.”
So just a heads up to my regular readers, I'll be going on a brief hiatus (no more than a month, I promise!) from posting chapters. I've got another story for a fic exchange that I need to complete and life, in general, has been scuppering my attempts to do serious writing of late.
Harry tutted. “It sounds like I’ve been a very bad boy, Sheriff. Perhaps we can come to some sort of arrangement?”
“I suppose you’re right,” he said uncertainly. “I mean, it’s not like I have to tell them about it, not now anyway. It’s not like Potter and I are officially dating or anything.”
“I didn’t like keeping it from you and Ron, but it’s nice having some semblance of a private life for a change.”
They clinked their metal tankards together and Liv took a deep swig of her drink, relishing the hot, sickly sweet liquid coating her tongue before flowing down her throat, heating her belly. Wrapping her hands around the mug, she enjoyed the warmth flowing through her fingers, banishing the wintery chill. Hestia snorted out a laugh and Liv frowned.
Despite feeling the happiest he had felt in as long as he could remember, Harry couldn’t help but feel guilty about keeping such a big secret from Ron and Hermione. They had been to hell and back with Harry, seen him at his very best and worst. They were a constant source of strength and support for him throughout the years and he was repaying them by lying to them about his relationship with Draco. The more he thought about it, the more his guilt ate away at him.
“You don’t think it’s a tad inappropriate for Harry to walk about Hogwarts with a bare chest?” said Hermione.
“Yes, it is quite a pickle we’re in,” said Draco sarcastically. “If only there was some way we could transfigure out clothes to look the way we want them to—using magic, perhaps?”
“Yes, because the idea of us being friends is inconceivable,” he said with a slight edge to his voice.
“Act one, scene one,” Liv announced from her seat facing the stage. “Gregory and Sampson enter from the right. And...ACTION!”
Unable to use his hands, Draco pushed the swing door entrance to the Hospital Wing open with his back only to be met with a shrill voice crying, “CLOSE THE DOOR! QUICKLY!”
The clothes from his trunk were already washed, dried and pressed, and had been placed in a neat pile inside a wicker hamper at the foot of the dresser. Draco walked past it and sat on the edge of his bed, feeling adrift. The silence that he’d long sought after now felt oppressive in the large, empty room. Glancing at his bedside table, he noticed that Blinken had left the two-way mirror there. He wanted to talk to Harry, but he had several hours to wait before it reached ten o’clock. Draco sighed and flopped back on the bed, feeling miserable. Two long weeks in a big, empty house with nobody to talk to.
“I find that hard to believe. You don’t have Quidditch this year to make sure that you’re the centre of attention, but you’ve got this play to fall back on. I take that you want to play Romeo?”
“Right,” said Ron, clapping his hands together. “Hermione, Ginny and I are off to the Prefects’ carriage. Catch you later, Harry.”
Relieved to have survived her first ever lesson as a Hogwarts professor, she snatched up her handbag from under her desk and slung it over her shoulder. She had a free period before her next class and decided to reward herself with a quick bite to eat in the school kitchens. However, just as she was about to leave the classroom, she paused as she noticed that one of the scripts that she had handed out remained sat on one of the desks untouched. Luckily, she had anticipated something like this happening and had prepared accordingly. Lifting the script, she drew her wand and muttered, “Revelio” and the owner of the discarded script appeared at the bottom of the front page.
Draco didn’t respond, but a little bubble of happiness swelled inside of his chest at those words. Although he still felt apprehensive about showing physical affection in public, he cast a swift glance over the other students to make sure nobody was watching before pressing a quick kiss to Harry’s cheek and pretending to read his script again. It wasn’t the full blown type of affection that he knew Harry wanted, but it was something that Draco was working on building up gradually.
“There’s plenty to talk about!” Ron exclaimed. “I just stumbled across you in the bushes with this...this…”
Draco felt a familiar deep ache in his chest return when he looked at his oldest friend. He missed him more than words could say...he wasn’t even sure if he said that part out loud to Ron or not, but at this point, he didn’t care anymore.
“What do you two have to say for yourselves?” Professor McGonagall cut in, turning her attention to the two students on Harry’s right. Neither boy seemed to have the courage to speak up, and Harry couldn’t blame them; he’d never seen his former Head of House look so angry.
“I’m not upset!” he snapped. Hermione quickly withdrew her hand and Neville looked embarrassed at having raised his voice. He huffed out a sigh and said more quietly, “Look, Goyle might owe you both a life debt but a Nundu doesn’t change its spots; I’d trust him as far as I could throw him. That’s all I have to say on the matter.”
“My friends,” said Harry. “I didn’t think that they were going to stay as long as they did...we were going to rehearse together a bit more after dinner, sorry we didn’t get the chance to.”
Only when they were safely inside the Quidditch Stadium did Harry pull the Invisibility Cloak off of them and stuff it into his backpack.
“Evidently not,” Harry muttered. Although he hadn’t paid too much attention in his History of Magic lessons, he knew well enough that relations between goblins and wizards were tentative at best. He doubted their recent antics at the bank would have endeared them much to the goblin community.
Draco’s stomach twisted with guilt. “It’s not that I don’t want to say that you’re my boyfriend. You know what it’s like with my parents—”
to say is that yes, you are atrocious at Occlumency…” Harry bristled but kept his mouth shut. “...but as luck would have it, it is a branch of magic that I have a particular talent for. So, if you would like a few pointers, then I am happy to assist you.”
She turned to Liv and gave her a quick nod and took her seat again. Liv leapt to her feet so fast that she knocked over a goblet of pumpkin juice in the process. Cursing under her breath, Hestia and Professor Slughorn helped her mop up the mess with tissues before she straightened her robes and smiled sheepishly at the students.
“That would be putting it mildly,” he muttered. “I mean, it’s better than it used to be, I suppose. It’s not illegal anymore, at least…”
Draco sighed and finally looked up at his mother. Her face, normally a porcelain mask, was pinched with worry. Draco felt some of his indignant anger ebb away when he noticed that her icy blue eyes were glassy with tears. Evidently, she was as reluctant to send him away as he was to go. Draco took his mother’s hand into his own and gave it a slight squeeze.
“The costume isn’t that bad,” Harry offered kindly, scrutinising his own appearance in the mirror before giving his reflection a quick nod of approval. “I guarantee there’ll be crazier costumes than yours out there tonight.”
“Miss Parkinson,” Liv called, interrupting the scene. “As much as I admire your passion, you probably don’t need to throw the prop sword about quite so much.”
Myrtle gaped at Draco as though he had just slapped her across the face. “Who put a Glumbumble in your bonnet? I’m only trying to help!”
“It does, doesn’t it?” he preened, strutting past an increasingly furious Ron to where Harry’s changing room was. “Potter, what do you think?”
Rather than venture into the dangerous territory of her student’s love lives, Liv downed her drink and hurried to the bar to get them another pint. The rest of the afternoon passed in a pleasant blur as she and Hestia chatted about everything and anything; they had an in-depth discussion about Tolkien’s work, namely whether or not Bilbo Baggins was a reliable narrator (“Given his propensity to embellish events, I think most of the events were greatly exaggerated,” Liv argued). They also discussed the curious similarities between the power of The One Ring and that of Horcruxes (“I’m still convinced Tolkien was a wizard!” declared Hestia after their third pint).
Draco slowed his pace. “Well, I suppose it’s like you said before, just because something’s weird doesn’t mean that it’s bad.”
The seconds dragged by at a torturously slow speed, but Draco made no attempt to leave, much to Harry’s disappointment. He watched as Draco fidgeted with his sleeves, his expression set in a deep frown as though he were experiencing a great deal of discomfort. Harry knew exactly how he felt: his arms were beginning to ache and he was hot and stuffy in his robes. He had to resist the overwhelming urge to tear them off and make a run for it himself. He kept glancing at Draco, the same question repeating over and over again in his mind until he couldn’t help himself from asking, “Are you serious about going back to Hogwarts this year?”
“I told you, Malfoy, I haven’t been rehearsing,” Harry argued. “I’m not interested in doing the play. I’ve got better things to do with my time, thanks very much.”
“Not to worry,” she assured her, taking Liv’s hand in a firm handshake before they both took their seats. “Tea?”
“All the time,” he sighed, taking a swig from his goblet. “They’ll kiss and make up later. They always do.”
Luna stopped dead in her tracks and turned to see Harry charging towards her. “Hello,  Harry. Have you come to help me distribute the posters?”
“Well then count your blessings that they love me more than they hate you,” Harry said, slipping his arm under the table and taking hold of Draco’s hand. “They know that hurting you will hurt me, that’s why I know that they won’t say anything.”
“Would you like a biscuit?” she offered. Liv raised her eyebrows in surprise at the gesture before giving Minerva a small, but genuine, smile.
“Not my problem,” she shrugged. “If I’m going to have any chance of achieving eight N.E.W.T.S. then I’m afraid that I’m going to be much too busy to help either of you this year. Maybe Ginny will be kind enough to help you out?”
Draco gave a derisive laugh. “Alright, since we’re being frank with each other...no, I don’t have a problem with your class. I just don’t care about it.”
“I don’t know!” he snapped. “Christ, we’ve only been seeing each other a few weeks. Aren’t you getting a bit ahead of yourself?”
“I know that I’m the last person in the world that you want to speak to—now or ever—but I’m taking advantage of the fact that you can’t speak and I can’t lie, and I’m going to tell you what you need to hear.”
Harry thought for a moment. “It’s been years since I’ve last been to a zoo, but I do like them.” Harry turned to Draco. “What do you think?”
Harry stepped further into the room and took in his surroundings. The layout of the Slytherin dormitory was identical to the Gryffindor one: five four-posters clad in green silk hangings instead of red velvet. Silver lanterns hung from the ceiling while the walls were decorated with medieval tapestries depicting the adventures of famous Slytherins from years gone by. Harry peered out of the nearest window to the bottom of the Black Lake. Bottle green water lapped against the window as eerie dark figures swam by in the murky depths.
“I’ll tell you a little bit about myself before we begin, shall I? Like you, I used to be a student here at Hogwarts, though that was a few more years ago now than I care to admit. I’m curious, how many Slytherins do we have in the class?” A couple of hands were tentatively raised and Liv’s smile broadened. “Good to see a few fellow Slytherins in our midst!”
“Yeah, what of it?” he replied a little defensively. Draco finally turned to face him, his face deliberately set in an unreadable expression.
boasting an almost identical headline with his and Harry’s faces front and centre. Evidently, one of the journalists at the newspaper had caught wind of Xenophilius’s advertisement and had falsely claimed the story of the play as an exclusive. Harry was so angry when he caught sight of the morning paper that he stormed out of the Great Hall without having any breakfast, closely followed by the prying, judgemental eyes of the other students.
Harry wiped the spit off of his mouth with the back of his hand before moving to the centre of the bed. “I did a bit of prep on myself while I was in the shower, but I’m going to need a lot more if we’re going to do this. Do you think it’d be easier if I lay on my front or on my stomach?”
“What was wrong with it?” he asked, dropping Draco’s hand. Draco scoffed and made a dismissive gesture.
“Not really,” he’d shrugged, unsure of where exactly this conversation was going. Ginny had taken his hand into her own, given it a reassuring squeeze and had suggested (ever-so-delicately) that while Harry might love Ginny, he might not be
Three polite chaps at the wooden door signalled the arrival of her guest and Minerva opened her mouth to call out to her, but Albus spoke first.
Harry shrugged. “We’ve nearly killed each other on more than one occasion. Saved each other once or twice, too. If Draco and I can get to a place where we can forgive each other, I think there’s hope for your friendship with him yet.”
“Very mature of both of you,” said Hermione in a disapproving tone. Ron didn’t look entirely convinced by this explanation but dropped his interrogation as they reached the Muggle Studies classroom.
A loud scream shortly followed by uproarious laughter drew Harry and Draco’s attention away from each other and they turned to see what all the commotion was. Neville, who was now completely bald, sat staring at his reflection in his mirror with a horrified expression.
“So is that what you wanted to talk to me about?” he asked. “My temper and how you’ve finally found something that you’re better at than me?”
“I couldn’t help but notice that you and Malfoy have been talking a lot more during classes,” she said, giving Harry a searching look. “Anything you want to tell me?”
When Snape had penetrated Harry’s mind during their Occlumency lessons, Harry felt as though Snape was cutting through his mind with a scalpel, sifting through his mess of memories with precision and purpose. But when Neville did it—probably because he had never done it before—Harry felt as though his brain was being beaten about by a whisk. Memories from the distant past got tangled up in more recent ones: Dudley’s fist connecting with the side of Harry’s face...Harry fighting helplessly against Inferi as they dragged him towards a watery grave...Harry tumbling through the air in a storm as hundreds of Dementors surround him...Harry’s mother screaming and a flash of green light—
“Of course, the saviour of the Wizarding world wouldn’t want to be seen walking beside an unsavoury character like myself,” Draco teased. “People might get the wrong idea and think that we were in cahoots.”
“Oh, don’t be so naive,” Neville huffed. “Crabbe and Goyle were in their element torturing other students—they enjoyed it! Don’t forget that he’s a Slytherin—and a Death Eater to boot—they just suck up to whoever they think will make their lives easier. If Voldemort had won the war, he would sooner kill us than shake our hand, and that’s the truth.”
rang through the air and an ancient-looking house-elf appeared. He bowed so low that his long, thin nose touched the flagstone floor.
Harry double checked nobody was listening to their conversation before answering, “I’m worried that our acting might be a little too convincing, if you catch my drift.”
“This,” he yawned. “Knowing nobody’s going to barge into the room in the next five minutes and interrupt us. Just lying here with you...all of it, really. You touching my hair feels pretty good too. ‘Snice.”
Harry nodded. Draco scoffed and crossed his arms. “After the last time we flew together? Not bloody likely.”
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” she warned in a low voice. Reluctantly, Harry withdrew his hand from his robes and raised them into the air. This wasn’t a great start to his incognito shopping trip.
“Ahh…” Harry grinned and nodded in understanding. He should have known Luna would think outside of the box when it came to choosing outfits for her and Neville. “I think you guys are in with a good chance of winning the prize for best couple’s costume.”
“I have an idea,” he began slowly. “How about I go and distract them? I’ll get the books and the potions supplies while you go to Madam Malkin’s? It means I’ll need to put up with them following me about for a bit, but at least you can go and get your robes fitted in peace.”
“You give people too much credit,” Ginny quipped. “If humans were so logical, then prejudice wouldn’t exist in the world. Prejudice by its very nature is illogical, but we still have bigotry against Muggle-borns and Squibs. And don’t get me started on the prejudices that Muggles have against their own kind, otherwise I’ll be here all bloody night!”
Draco stopped at a seated alcove and sat down. He put his head in his hands and looked despondent. “Sounds stupid, doesn’t it? After everything that’s happened, I lose my cool trying to walk through a bloody door.”
—” Harry angrily brandished his left hand which still bore the thin white scars from Umbridge’s Blood Quill “—prevented us from learning defensive magic. That’s why Dumbledore’s Army was started in the first place! And as for targeting Slytherins, you just had to take a look at the Inquisitorial Squad—full of Slytherins, it was. If anything, they were targeting us!”
His mind was a fog of lust and he couldn’t figure out what else to say, but Draco just smiled and picked up the pace of his hand, understanding without having to be told. An intense surge of pleasure rose up from the pit of Harry’s stomach as Draco quickly stroked him closer and closer to climax.
“And finally, the role of Juliet will be played by…” she paused for dramatic effect. “Draco Malfoy. Congratulations!”
“They’re all Muggle authors,” Hermione answered, sounding impressed. “I must admit, I had some trepidations when I read about the new Muggle Studies professor, but if this reading list is anything to go by, we might be in for a treat this year!”
He and Luna smiled goofily at one another, having seemingly forgotten about the other two occupants of the carriage. Draco drew Harry a bemused look, but Harry just shook his head and whispered, “It’s better not to argue with her.” He turned his attention back to Luna and asked, “What are you still doing here, anyway? Aren’t you supposed to be in the Prefects’ carriage?”
The train journey back to London was as unusual as it was unremarkable; it was the first time he and Harry had ever voluntarily boarded the train together. It was strange, sitting in a compartment with two Gryffindors, but Neville proved to be palatable company, even if he did bore on about his house plants for most of the journey. Harry just nodded and smiled along, seemingly content to just listen to Neville talk while Draco read his book. The journey might have been dull but it was infinitely better than being cramped in the toilet cubicle for hours on end.
After fixing up Myrtle’s bathroom, Harry had spent the rest of his evening mulling over the threatening messages that had been written across the walls. He decided to confront Draco about it at the next opportune moment, which came about the next day during their morning Transfiguration lesson. Professor Switch had tasked each student to transfigure their hair into a different colour, then to change it back again. So far, only Hermione had managed to change hers from platinum blonde back to its normal brown colour, but curiously it was a few inches shorter than before. Currently, Draco’s hair was canary yellow and he was having some trouble changing it back.
Harry grabbed Hannah by the shoulder and nodded to Draco. “What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?”
“Really?” she asked, sounding unconvinced. “Then whose idea was it for you to return to Hogwarts—yours or your parents?”
Without prompting, Draco used wandless magic to flip open Harry’s script to the first page. Harry shot Draco a surprised look but he had already turned back to his own script.
know that I was a wizard. It’s just so fundamental to who we are—to keep it from you for so long is criminal, as far as I’m concerned.”
“To find the others, of course,” she laughed, dragging him and her suitcase with surprising ease considering her slight size. “Come on, Draco. They’re waiting for us!”
“Well, it is supposed to be a Muggle interpretation of fairies,” Harry reminded him. “You’ll get less grief if you just roll with it, mate.”
Harry screamed in surprise and almost slipped off his broomstick as Myrtle’s spectral figure suddenly appeared in front of him. He tried to veer left to dodge her but he was too late and as he flew through her incorporeal body, he felt as though someone had tossed a bucket of ice-cold water over him.
“Take care of yourself, Harry dear,” she said before adding, “And please try and stay out of trouble this year.”
“Yeah, you seem fine,” said Harry curiously. “Apart from the fact that you can’t lie, of course. I wonder why you’re less affected than the others?”
When Harry climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the far corner with their heads together and whispering to one another.
“My point is that it will seem a lot easier to hate everything and everyone around you than it is to acknowledge those other emotions,” he explained. “But it can all too easily become a crutch. Hate may seem like the less painful option to feeling grief and fear, but it’s like an infection growing under your skin; it metastasizes, devouring every little bit of you—eating up anything good that you had left—until it leaves you hollow. And it’ll keep picking away at you until you can’t even remember what caused you to hate in the first place, but that’s all that will be left.”
“Think of it this way, then: we’re going to be visiting a city where nobody knows who we are. No parents or professors—just us,” Harry squeezed the top of Draco’s thigh. “Alone. In a hotel room.”
Theo cleared his throat and bowed his head, unable to meet Draco’s eye. “Ginny and I have been talking…”
“And so he should! My being dead is no laughing matter, yet he saw fit to mock me nonetheless,” Myrtle’s anger seemed to melt away as quickly as it had arisen. Her shoulders sagged and she sniffed loudly, wiping a transparent tear from her eye. “How could he say such an awful thing to me? I thought that we were friends.”
The creak of the portrait door swinging open again pulled Harry from his deep reverie and his insides jolted as Hermione stepped through the portrait hole, closely followed by Ron. He immediately sprang to his feet, causing Asha to squeak in protest as she was unceremoniously dislodged from her comfortable sleeping position before scarpering in the direction of the boys’ dormitory and out of sight. When Ron and Hermione caught sight of Harry, they paused. Harry opened his mouth to speak but found that words failed him. Although technically there were only a few meters separating them, he felt as though the distance between him and his best friends was far greater now than it had been earlier this evening. He’d put their friendship to the test on several occasions throughout the years. The last year, in particular, had been incredibly difficult, but despite some stumbles along the way, the three of them had always come out the other end, the bonds of friendship stronger than ever. But by the expression written across Ron’s face—the look of betrayal—Harry wasn’t entirely confident that their friendship would recover from this.
Draco jabbed Harry hard in the shoulder but his response was to simply hold up his hands in surrender. “I do protest I never injur’d thee, but love thee better than thou canst devise. Till thou shalt know the reason of my love; And so good Capulet, which I name tender as dearly as my own, be satisfied.”
“Oh. I thought it would be a nice surprise,” she replied meekly. “Right. Well, just give me a minute and I’ll conjure the room that we need.”
“I must admit that I’m surprised to see you,” said Theo lightly. “I didn’t think that you’d be back this year.”
He pressed a soft kiss to Draco's lips which Draco briefly returned before pulling back. "When you do decide to tell your friends...will you tell them about me?”
will know that gender roles are something that Shakespeare explored more in-depth but we can look at that in more detail another day. I thought for our production, it would be interesting to subvert tradition and have women in traditionally male roles and vice versa.”
After Draco’s departure, no other customers came into the shop and Douglas the tailor was able to spend the rest of the time constructing Harry’s robes. He took a little longer than Madam Malkin normally would, but Harry couldn’t deny that the man had a talent for making normally shapeless robes fit in all the right places. Harry twisted and turned, admiring the expensive-looking outfit from all angles. He wasn’t one to waste much time on his personal appearance, but these made him feel…nice.
“Just let me say my piece,” she pleaded. “Now, I know that going back to school has been difficult, for both you and Theo—”
Draco still wouldn’t meet Harry’s gaze, straightening the sleeves of his shirt and fiddling with his cufflinks as he spoke. “What I mean is, you two were pretty loved-up for a long time and then all of a sudden you weren’t. I’m just curious what happened.”
Draco followed Ron’s line of sight and realised what was really bothering him: sat next to Theo, laughing and chatting away to him, was Ginny. Ron’s eyes narrowed and he shook his head in disbelief.
Pansy bit her lip. “Well, I’m about as popular as you are at the moment. We’re still friends, but I need to choose my alliances carefully. You understand, yes?”
“Uh, yeah. Definitely.” Harry nodded to the empty seat beside him. “I’ve almost finished my breakfast but do you want to sit down?”
The next few rehearsals went as well as Draco had expected them to—badly. Where there had once been divisions between the Slytherins and other houses, the former P.A. members had slipped into the role of pariah while everyone else avoided them as much as possible. Liv tried her best to integrate the two groups as much as possible, giving their newest members small acting roles in the play and getting them to help the more seasoned students with their tasks, but she had to break up more than a few arguments and scuffles between the feuding groups.
“Haven’t you got anything better to do with your time than harass me?” asked Harry irritably. Draco’s trademark smug grin spread across his face.
“Harry wanted to tell you about him and me, but I asked him not to. In part because I’m afraid of what my parents will say when they find out, but the main reason I didn’t want him to tell you is because I knew that you would react badly. And I...I’m afraid that if you ask him to choose between your friendship and being with me, he’ll choose you. We both know what choice he’ll make.”
Harry took the proffered costume from Draco’s outstretched hand and frowned. The outfit was all black, with a cordobes, cape and rapier. Unsure of what it was, Harry quickly pulled on the costume and inspected his reflection in the mirror. Slipping on the black cloth veil mask, he carefully placed the wide-brimmed hat atop his head and smiled. Drawing back the curtain, he stepped out of the changing room to show Draco how the costume looked.
Draco looked around and finally took in the extent of the chaos around him. The hall was half empty—evidently, a few of the students had made a quick getaway when the dragon had appeared—and those that remained looked dazed and confused. Ron was across the room talking to Professor McGonagall, who looked angrier than Draco had ever seen her before. Liv sat at the high table with her head in her hands, crying as Hestia hugged her tightly. The house banners that normally adorned the walls of the Great Hall were scorched and the Slytherin one was completely burnt away. Where the Slytherin banner once hung proudly, a message had been burnt onto the stone wall in its place:
obvious; they had been very careful not to be seen by anyone, not to touch each other too often in public...Oh Merlin, maybe they were being too nice to each other?
Ignoring Snape’s interruption, Harry continued. “All I wanted to say was that since you were willing to give Draco another chance, I think Dennis should be afforded the same courtesy. Christ, the amount of times
They followed Liv as she made her way through the Atrium, struggling to keep up with her pace as she hurried past the
Liv squealed in surprise at the sudden interruption. She stopped the chair spinning so abruptly that it tipped over completely, sending her crashing onto the hard, flagstone floor. She instinctively threw her hand out to break the fall and a shooting pain shot up her arm as her hand struck the ground. It crossed her mind that she may have broken her wrist, but Liv momentarily forgot the pain when she heard the click of heels hurry across the classroom floor in her direction and, without warning, a strong pair of hands slipped under her armpits and pulled her unceremoniously into a sitting position.
As Theo walked past he leaned close to Ron and whispered, “Just because he owes you a life debt doesn’t mean that you can take the piss; don’t use this to your advantage or else you’ll have me to deal with. I don’t owe either of you anything and you best remember that.”
Once all of their luggage was stowed on board, Harry hopped back onto the platform to wish Mrs Weasley goodbye. She hugged each of them in turn, tears streaming down her face as she told each of her children how much she loved them.
“Oh no, the fault is mine!” Liv protested quickly. Without thinking, she thrust out her injured hand to Hestia then quickly dropped it before holding out the uninjured one instead. “Liv Tonks.”
“More the case that I didn’t want to give you buggers the time of day,” she muttered darkly to herself.
“Of course we’re going to rehearse! I know that you’re a bit slow to pick things up but don’t you think it would look a bit odd if we spent the whole day together and you didn’t manage to learn anything?”
“Excellent. Now that’s taken effect, I’ll have to—oh for Merlin’s sake, will you lot please quieten down? I will see to you soon enough!” Madam Pomfrey shouted at the canaries but her protests fell on deaf ears. Draco watched as the little birds continued to twitter loudly as they circled the infirmary.
Of course, that was before the war and before everything had changed. Since his family’s fall from grace, prospective partners were suddenly very hard to come by, and Draco was quietly relieved that any chance of an arranged marriage now seemed to be permanently off of the table. That didn’t, however, mean that he could now take up with whoever he pleased; anyone he took home would be subject to harsh scrutiny from both of his parents. And therein lay another complication: if Harry’s relationship with Draco had been adversarial in the past, that paled in comparison to his dealings with Draco’s father. The hatred between the Potters and Malfoys made the feud between the Capulets and Montagues seem like a playground squabble by comparison.
“Malfoy, just do it already,” Harry cut in impatiently. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “If I can’t resist you, then I’ve got no chance against a dark wizard, have I? So, just go for it. Hit me with your best shot.”
“I’m just about to get onto that very subject. Our lessons will actually entail learning two obscure but highly useful branches of magic...” Hestia began scribbling across the blackboard and Harry’s momentary feelings of elation were immediately extinguished as he realised what they would be learning. Hestia underlined two words that she had written on the blackboard. “Legilimency and Occlumency. Who here can tell me what each spell does? Miss Granger?”
“It’s alright.” Harry hesitated a moment before asking, “I take it that things between you two still aren’t great at the moment?”
Groans of disappointment rippled throughout the crowd and Ron looked horror-struck at this revelation. One of the main things that he and Harry had been looking forward to upon their return to Hogwarts was the chance of winning the Quidditch Cup for one last time before graduating.
When people asked Harry why he had decided to return to Hogwarts, he didn’t have one definitive answer. There were a lot of good reasons for him to come back; he needed the qualifications, for one thing. It was also his last chance to spend time with his friends before they had to go out into the world and find proper jobs. Then there was the food (Merlin, he’d missed the feasts), the Quidditch (Harry still felt a little put out that there would be no league this year), and the opportunity to go on nightly expeditions and explore the castle with his trusted Marauder’s Map. It was the first place that Harry had ever considered home and Harry wanted to wish it one final, fond farewell before he left the last remnants of his childhood behind him and set out into the world on his own.
He leant forward and pressed a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips and there was an audible gasp from the other students. Liv shushed them and everyone quickly fell silent again. As Harry broke the kiss, Draco spoke again, his voice a little hoarse.
She held a goblet full of potion up to his lips and he drank it all in two large gulps. It tasted as bad as the bubotuber pus smelled, but Draco would have happily drank pureed flobberworms if it relieved the pain in his hands and arms. Within seconds, the pain began to lessen considerably and he let out a sigh of relief. Madam Pomfrey nodded approvingly.
Draco frowned and snorted out a laugh when he noticed that Blinken had taken the present he’d bought for Myrtle out of his trunk and pinned it to the ceiling above his bed.
The storm inside Draco’s head was still raging, his thoughts spinning and accelerating, telling him to run, that he was trapped and that he was going to die, but Harry’s voice was like an anchor dragging him back to shore and Draco hung onto it for dear life.
“Alright then. Now let me start by saying that I know a few of you won’t have taken this subject before. Some of you may even have no experience of the Muggle world at all…” A strangled sound came from the back of the classroom and Liv saw the panic-stricken expression written across Neville Longbottom’s face. “Let me assure you now that you have nothing to worry about. Nobody in this class is going to be left struggling or fall behind. We’re all here to help each other.”
Liv resisted the temptation to roll her eyes then since she remembered, all too well, greeting teachers with the same level of enthusiasm when she was at school. Stepping out from behind her desk, she began to slowly pace back and forth in front of the class.
Taking that as his cue to leave, Draco picked his school bag up off the floor and left Liv’s office feeling a little shell-shocked. Of all the things he had expected to happen when he was summoned to her office, rethinking his lacklustre approach to his education was at the bottom of a very long list of possibilities. Draco briefly considered the possibility that she had performed a Confundus charm on him, making him more amenable to her suggestions, but immediately dismissed the theory.
Eventually, he took Goyle’s hand into his own and gave it a quick shake before they both swiftly dropped their hands by their sides again. There was a collective gasp when Goyle then held his hand up to Hermione. She was quicker to respond than Ron, taking his hand and giving it a firm shake before letting it go. Goyle looked relieved—whether it was because they had accepted his small gesture of truce or because the awkward interaction had mercifully come to an end, they weren’t entirely sure. Pansy grabbed Goyle’s elbow and gave it a slight tug.
“Hestia!” she said breathlessly, trying to lean casually on the shelf to her left then immediately straightened when the bookcase wobbled dangerously. “What are you doing here?”
He pushed away his breakfast and left the table without another word. Perhaps joining Harry on one of his impromptu flights around the school wasn’t such a bad idea. To Draco’s surprise,
Harry muttered something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like “foul git” but Draco chose to ignore it. Another moment of silence passed and then Harry spoke up again.
“You have a moustache,” she chuckled before proceeding to suck the cream off of her thumb. “Mmm, tasty!”
“Tell me about it,” Harry mumbled. He checked that nobody was looking before he drew his wand and cast a silent warming charm on the two of them. Draco sighed and relaxed back into his seat as the gentle heat crept up his arms and legs.
Harry and Draco made sure to keep their distance from Luna during the thirty-minute walk to the village. They watched from afar as she began pinning posters up outside every shop window and lamppost, then waited until she had moved further up the street before grabbing the posters and stuffing them into their pockets.
“He’s been busy,” Draco replied stiffly. It was taking all of his willpower to ignore the jibe, but he knew that Theo was just trying to goad him into a fight. Theo let out a derisive laugh.
“I’m surprised they let him board the train,” Ginny continued. “People are still pissed about that stunt he and his friends pulled on Halloween. I lost count of the number of people who tried to get into his compartment to pick a fight with him.”
“Well, regardless of whether or not you care about my subject, attendance is compulsory. While you’re my student, I expect you to participate during lessons—that includes completing homework assignments like reading this script,” she reminded him.
But Harry shook his head. “He might not be able to speak but that doesn’t mean that he’ll listen to me.”
As Draco continued his rant, Harry was suddenly thrown back to the first day of term when he and Draco had bickered with each other in much the same way as they were now as they climbed the stone steps of the castle into the Entrance Hall. Harry had less of a compulsion to hex Draco this time around—but only slightly.
There was an awkward silence before Harry cleared his throat and began to rummage through his school bag for his script.
His words did little to reassure Harry—and for good reason. The next morning, the owl post arrived with the latest issue of
“Okay, I get why you didn’t talk about it. But you didn’t have to keep it from me,” Ron grumbled, unable to hide the hurt note from his voice. “We trust each other with everything else, why not this?”
“No need to thank me,” she assured him with a warm smile. “It’s my job to take care for all of the students at Hogwarts, including the more accident-prone ones like yourself and Mr Longbottom. But please, try to be more careful in future. As pleasant as your company is, I’d rather not see you here so often.”
“I figured we’d need somewhere bigger than my classroom to rehearse the play,” said Liv, stepping into the room. Harry followed close behind and couldn’t help but smile at the sight before him. The last time he had been here, the entire room had been aflame. It had been one of the scariest moments of his life, and he had been certain that he and his friends were going to die just as Crabbe had. But against all odds, they had found some old broomsticks and made it out of there alive. Now, the flames were but a distant memory, the fear extinguished as Harry stepped out of the corridor at Hogwarts and into a magnificent theatre.
“This is what we call a Thrust theatre. It’s a stage that’s surrounded by the audience on three sides,” Liv explained, walking across the stage. “They’re the earliest type of stage in Western theatre and is the same kind that Shakespeare’s plays would have been performed on in the Elizabethan era.”
Draco decided that it was best to keep things as vague as possible and give his mother just enough information to keep her ticking over until he saw her again over the Christmas holidays. He scribbled down a few other lines about missing her and the Manor, and, as an afterthought, added that he hoped Father was keeping well. His mother hadn’t mentioned his father in her previous letter and Draco didn’t care to ask about him. He assumed that the Malfoy patriarch was still cooped up in his drawing room, stewing over how hard done by he and the family were. Draco didn’t much care for his father’s self-pity and he had more important things to contend with, like memorising his lines for this bloody play.
Breaking the kiss, Draco experimentally nipped Harry’s plump bottom lip. That sent a pleasant spark of pain and pleasure straight to Harry’s groin and he instinctively tightened his grip on Draco’s lower back, digging his fingers into his soft skin.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Fake memories, Ron. I seriously doubt that Zabini only thinks about personal grooming. It’s a clever tactic on his part: if you can’t block someone out of your head, you can throw them off by showing them a false memory.”
“But we cannot tar all Slytherins with the same brush,” she implored. “There are just as many good ones as bad.”
“Oh. Yes, I suppose you’re right,” she mumbled. “Well...can we at least visit one of the places that I’ve recommended?”
“It would be far more convenient for me if you remain here,” she countered, tucking the bedsheets around his legs so tightly that Draco now had no means of escape. “Bed rest, Mr Malfoy. The sooner you rest, the quicker you’ll heal. I suggest you use the free time to catch up on your studies.”
“Like this,” he said, pulling one of the pillows out from under his head and tucking it under his hips. “I want to be able to see you.”
There weren’t many things that Harry missed about the Muggle world. He’d grown up feeling like he never really fit in there: not with the Dursleys, not at school, or anywhere. In his earliest memories, Harry had always felt, and had always been, alone. So when Hagrid had appeared one stormy night shortly after his eleventh birthday and whisked him away to the magical world, despite everything being new and strange, for the first time in Harry’s life he felt that he truly belonged. Once he stepped through the threshold from the Muggle world into Diagon Alley, he had never looked back.
“I don’t think it sounds stupid,” said Harry gently, taking the seat next to Draco. There wasn’t much room on the seated ledge and Harry tried his best not to be distracted by how warm and firm Draco’s thigh felt pressed against his own. “Considering what happened in that room, I think that it makes perfect sense. Try not to beat yourself up over it.”
Harry smiled and patted Draco’s knee before turning his attention back to the lesson, a goofy grin gracing his face. Draco stared at the blackboard but he let his mind wander to more interesting places—namely, all the delightful things that he and Harry could get up to during their London trip. But his excitement was cut short when he realised that he’d have to provide an explanation to his parents for his absence at the start of the Christmas break. There was no way that he could tell them the true nature of the trip; they’d ask too many awkward questions that Draco wasn’t ready to address with them quite yet. He also wasn’t keen on staying at Hogwarts over Christmas either as there was no point in staying there when Harry was going home to the Weasleys’ for the holidays. He glanced at Harry then and felt that familiar, pleasant twinge in the pit of his stomach. He would think of something to tell his parents, because there was no way that he was missing out on this trip. Not his parents nor the Dark Lord himself would stop him.
The mistrustful voice in the back of his mind kept telling him that Harry must have some ulterior motive—why else would he want to talk to Draco? It couldn’t be because he actually liked him. However, despite his misgivings, he couldn’t help but trust that Harry’s motivations weren’t self-interested. He was too bloody noble and heroic to be planning anything nefarious towards Draco. Where that once would have made Draco balk, now he found it somewhat endearing. Draco allowed himself a small smile; stupid, annoying, funny and thoughtful Potter was too kind for his own good. Draco hoped that he’d never change. He slipped the little keepsake into his breast pocket and, for the first time since he’d arrived at Hogwarts, he felt glad to be here.
“Well, then you need to get your eyes checked,” Harry sniped. Draco tsked and was silent for a few moments before speaking again.
“I think I’ve had enough partying for one day. I’m just going to head back to my toilet and think about death.” Myrtle rose from her seated position and began to float away. “See you later, Harry.”
Ginny patted him reassuringly on the back but made no attempt to hide her wicked grin. “Don’t worry about it, it’s only acting! And now that you two are friends, it’ll make this a lot less awkward, won’t it? It’ll be like kissing me.”
Draco didn’t answer for a long time before finally admitting, “I don’t know what happened. When I realised where Professor Tonks was taking us, I wasn’t worried about going back there. I know that it’s just a room. But when I tried to step through the door...it felt like someone had stolen the air from my lungs.”
“Professor Switch,” she implored, “I’m sorry to disturb you but the class was due to start ten minutes ago. Sir?”
His smile immediately fell when he heard a loud squeak and he sat bolt upright as Asha scarpered along the bench and onto Harry’s lap.
“Of course not! It’s just that...” he glanced up to make sure that Draco was out of earshot before asking in a low voice, “Does Malfoy know that you’re—sorry,
“What is it now?” he sighed impatiently. He was in no mood for more of Draco’s amateur dramatics. Draco crossed his arms across his chest and frowned.
Luna cocked her head and gave him a curious look. “You and Harry make each other happy, why would anyone have a problem with that?”
“You can’t possibly know that,” he argued. His eyes widened with shock as Luna proceeded to grab his hand and tugged him to follow. “Where are you going?”
“Sirius,” said Harry, his voice tightening. “Him and my dad used them when they were in separate detentions. I never got the chance to use it with him but…” Harry shook his head and smiled at Draco. “Go on then, give it a go.”
“I’m fine,” Liv assured her, wincing as she tried to put pressure on her wrist. She inspected the damage and while, thankfully, it appeared as though no bones were broken, she had taken the skin clean off the palm of her hand. “Oh, bugger…”
Draco humphed out a laugh and pushed Harry’s hand away. “You really do have the libido of a jackrabbit, don’t you?”
Hermione sighed. “No, I’m not angry. I feel a bit sad that you didn’t tell me about you and Malfoy, but I assume that you had your reasons.”
Draco picked up a fistful of bandages from the table and tossed them onto Harry’s lap. “Think you can do it again? Prove it.”
“Would you like to hear my suggestion or would you rather wallow in self-pity? Because if it’s the latter, I’ve got better things to be doing with my time.”
“We can but hope,” she sighed wearily. “I’ve already received several owls from concerned parents wanting assurances that there won’t be ‘Death Eater offspring’, as Romilda Vane’s mother so eloquently put it, allowed on the school premises.”
“He’s over there,” Ron pointed further down the platform. “Still chatting to his parents, by the looks of it.”
Before Draco could answer, Liv spoke loudly to address the whole group. “Alright, now that everyone’s here, we’ll head along to the hotel. It’s only a five minute walk down the road but stick close, we don’t want to risk losing anyone out here.”
On that note, Liv spent the rest of the lesson explaining to the class the various means of Muggle transport that would be available to them in the city, including how to access and navigate the London underground. While Liv stressed the importance of proper escalator etiquette (“Stand on the right, walk on the left. Otherwise, you’ll have some very cross Londoners to contend with!”), Harry turned to Draco and whispered, “You fancy it, then?”
Losing his old broom had been a crushing blow, more for its sentimental value than its actual cost, but he thought that Sirius would want him to keep up the flying, so he made a mental note to order a new Firebolt and have it delivered straight to the Burrow. His eyes scanned over the Firebolt displayed in the shop window to the one below it. The Nimbus 2001 was a fine-looking broomstick, a highly polished black body with silver revolving stirrups. Harry glared at the innocuous object, which had done nothing to offend Harry other than it immediately reminded Harry of Draco Malfoy.
“Really?” said Draco sarcastically. “Is this the same Professor McGonagall who disregarded the rules by allowing a first-year student to join the house Quidditch team after he’d been expressly told
“That’s unfortunate,” said Draco before casually suggesting, “Well, maybe next time we could forgo the Occlumency for an evening and test out that new broomstick of yours instead.”
Harry groaned and buried his face in his hands, great waves of shame and confusion cascading over him at the memory of their fleeting and awkward sexual encounters. When they had briefly dated in his sixth year, they hadn’t done anything beyond kissing. That had suited Harry fine; he enjoyed Ginny’s company, and while he enjoyed kissing her—she was undoubtedly a great kisser—he had no real desire to do anything beyond that. He’d put it down to how stressful things had been at the time—they were on the brink of war, and he had the combined stress of exams and Dumbledore’s task to contend with. And of course, he had spent an inordinate amount of time tracking Malfoy throughout the castle, convinced that he was up to something nefarious. He felt a little bit embarrassed thinking back on it now, the amount of time wasted following that git instead of spending quality time with his girlfriend.
Liv had glanced over their school records hoping to get a better idea of what kind of class she was going to teach and had chatted with Professor McGonagall at length about each of the seventh-year students. She had a rough idea about existing student rivalries and relationships and the Slytherin in her was already working out ways to use that information to her advantage—for the benefit of the students, of course. Her grand plan, which had the headmistress’s backing, was an ambitious one that ran a very high risk of failure. But Liv was as determined as she was ambitious and had never been one to shy away from a challenge.
Harry suppressed a groan of annoyance and sped up his pace to try and get away from him, but Draco managed to keep up with Harry and they marched side by side along the corridor.
“Why do you think I brought you here?” Draco sat down in the tall grass and patted the ground, inviting Harry to join him. Harry sat down cross-legged next to Draco, looking tense. “You said that when things got too crazy, you used to come here because it was peaceful, right?”
The moment the words had passed her lips, the entire room was instantly rendered mute. Harry gasped and instinctively clutched his throat as his tongue was suddenly glued to the roof of his mouth. Several other people around him did the same thing, eyes wide with shock as their mouths kept opening and closing of their own accord like a goldfish gulping for air. Professor McGonagall’s wand fell by her side and she cast her sharp gaze across everyone in the room.
“McGonagall might not be a fan of yours but she wouldn’t stand for students being harassed, no matter who they are.”
Harry snatched the pet carrier off of the ground and boarded the train, Ginny and Hermione following close behind. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny waved to Mrs Weasley out of the open window as the train began to move. As the train rounded the bend, Mrs Weasley and the platform disappeared from sight.
The other students stood hesitantly by the door as they watched the wizened professor shuffle slowly behind his desk and began to scribble notes on the blackboard, but gradually they filed their way back into the classroom and took their seats. The rest of the lesson was mercifully dull as Professor Switch outlined the lesson plan for the year. Most of the lessons would be focused on mastering human transfiguration, which Harry wasn’t looking forward to; he’d struggled in previous years to perform relatively simple tasks such as changing the colour of his eyebrows. That said, the prospect of being able to change his entire physical appearance was appealing to him; it would be nice to be able to walk about in public like a normal person without always having to rely on his Invisibility Cloak. Harry thought that would probably appeal to someone like Draco as well.
“Believe me, if I had any say in the matter, I’d rather have known what I was from the very start,” said Harry. “But that choice was taken away from me. So, I just had to deal with the hand that I was given.” Harry came to a stop when he saw an ice cream van and was immediately transported back to the first time he visited a zoo in Surrey for Dudley’s eleventh birthday. “Fancy an ice cream?”
“You’re too emotional,” Draco explained unhelpfully. “You need to learn to compartmentalise your feelings, otherwise your mind is like an open book.”
“Leave the drawing for the Art Club, lads, and try to concentrate on the task at hand,” she suggested before wandering away to help another student. Draco and Harry smirked at each other before Draco held out one of the pens to Harry.
“I believe you mean exclusionary,” Snape chipped in. “Students of Slytherin House were not permitted to join the organisation.”
Professor Switch shuffled over to Neville’s desk which was covered in blonde hair. He inspected Neville’s shiny bald scalp closely and hummed to himself, “Oh dear. Are you sure that you repeated the incantation correctly?”
Harry took a step closer to Draco and he felt a flutter of nerves assault him but he tried not to let his nervousness show in his face. He didn’t know why Harry was doing this or how seriously he felt about him, but in that moment, Draco didn’t much care what his intentions were. For now, it was just nice to want someone who wanted him too.
“You’ll come down to visit me an’ Fang this Sunday, yeah?” he asked after finally releasing Harry, who staggered dazed back into his seat. “I wan’ ter hear all abou’ what ye been up tae this summer!”
“The job was fine.” Liv shrugged. “But after my dad died, I wanted to come home. I missed my family.”
Harry grew even more alarmed when Draco gritted his teeth and screwed his face up in concentration, trying and failing to answer the question. “Rrrr…rrrrr…RRR— GREEN. Slytherin’s colours are green and silver. Fuck.”
Hermione lowered her hand again and asked tentatively, “I’m sorry Professor but...what relevance does
When it was Harry’s turn to speak, Liv was pleasantly surprised to see that, despite appearing nervous, his delivery of the lines was clear and well-paced.
When the reporters had owled her for comment on the article that they were writing, she had let her anger get the better of her and had ignored them.
“I wouldn’t pretend to know what it was like, Neville,” said Hermione gently. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you.”
Harry cast a worried glance at Dennis, who kept his head bowed and eyes fixed on the scrunched up photograph in his fist. “Okay, but I just have to say one thing…”
“I take a firm hold of my hard cock and imagine that you’re on top of me, sinking your tight little hole onto my cock,” he purred. “Would you like that?”
He watched as Harry opened the loose towel and took hold of his prick, already hard and leaking, and began stroking it to the same rhythm as his head bobbed back and forth over Draco’s cock. Draco let his head loll back and he closed his eyes, caught between trying not to finish too soon and wanting to come down Harry’s throat. The slick wet noises Harry was making as he sucked him off weren’t helping matters, so he gave Harry’s hair a tug and pulled him off of his cock. Harry looked up at him with a dazed expression, foggy with desire, spit dripping down his chin as he panted to catch his breath. Draco stroked his cheek and was once again struck by how beautiful Harry’s eyes were.
Turning his back on Ron’s bed, Harry was surprised to face Seamus, who was attempting to tip-toe from Dean’s bed back to his own. Seamus froze mid-step when he noticed Harry watching him, a look of mild panic written across his face. It took Harry’s sleep-addled brain a few seconds to realise what Seamus had been up to and a tense silence followed as Seamus waited to see what Harry’s reaction would be. Harry sat his wand on top of the bedside table and turned away without saying a word. A moment later, he heard the creak of Seamus’s mattress and although Harry kept his eyes shut, he was too awake to fall back to sleep now.
“Indeed,” Liv laughed nervously. “Who would be desperate enough to consult these books for advice, eh?”
An uncomfortable silence followed and no one invited Draco to sit down. Panic began to rise in Draco then; this was a much frostier reception than he had anticipated. He cleared his throat and turned to Goyle.
“Come on, Hermione!” he groaned. “When are we ever going to get another chance to gain some insight into Malfoy’s frame of mind?”
“As long as it takes,” she replied stiffly. Phineas sniffed indignantly and slunk out of his portrait.
They glided towards the ground and landed gently next to the broom shed. Harry climbed off of the broomstick and handed it to Draco.
“No, he probably wants to be left alone,” said Harry, knowing from his own experience that he preferred to grieve in private. Having people chase after him when he was upset only made him feel worse. Dennis was one of many people who had suffered great personal loss during the war: his brother, Colin, had been killed during the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry couldn’t help but feel somewhat responsible for what had happened to Colin because he had always been an avid fan of Harry’s and Harry wondered if that had been a contributing factor in his decision to sneak back into Hogwarts to join the fight. Evidently, Dennis held Harry somewhat responsible for his brother’s untimely death as well. “Maybe I should leave. I can find somewhere else to sit…”
“Beyond searching and destroying Horcruxes and beating Voldemort, I didn’t spare much thought for what I was going to do with the rest of my life. Now, it’s all over and I’m just feeling a bit…”
he didn’t really know anything about them other than what his father had told him about their family. Truth be told, he’d actually been quite fond of the twins and the antics that they got up to during their school days. And Ron...well, Ron was still a complete moron, but nonetheless, he remained Harry’s most loyal friend despite everything that they had been through together—despite Draco. It occurred to him then that perhaps Ron Weasley wasn’t as bad as he had originally thought, but he brushed
“Saving the world, I know,” she sighed. “Well since you asked, I’ve been doing quite well. I’ve recently taken up residence in a new toilet.”
“His head was just covered in Wrackspurts,” Luna noted gravely. “One of the worst infections I’ve ever seen, it was like a dark cloud over his head.”
“I can see why you’d enjoy that,” he smirked. He looked down at the script and noticed that there was a note scribbled at the bottom of the front page:
Harry felt a strong hand grab his shoulder and he paused. When he turned his head, he was surprised to find that it was Draco who had stopped him.
“There’s been an increased number of violent incidents involving Muggles, too,” Myra added. “I spoke to Arthur Weasley about it in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office and he’s informed me that they’ve been happening across a lot more insidious items, not just prank items, but things created with the sole purpose of hurting Muggles.”
“Well,” he croaked. “When you put it like that. We might as well take full advantage of the experience.”
He knew that it was becoming a bad habit, but Harry couldn’t help himself; while Professor Switch was busy scribbling on the blackboard, Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map out of his bag and checked the Hospital Wing. Sure enough, Draco’s name was there with Madam Pomfrey at his bedside. He wondered if anyone would go to visit Draco while he was there. Considering Harry hadn’t seen him talking to any of his friends since they’d returned to Hogwarts, he supposed not. Harry had thought that it was strange finding Draco lurking about the Hogwarts Express on his own long after everyone else had left. At first, Harry had suspected that he was up to something—as Draco Malfoy was prone to do—but after seeing him sitting alone at meal times and during classes, Harry quickly realised that, for once, that wasn’t the case.
Harry snatched up the robes from the floor and tossed them at Draco’s head. “Never mind that, hurry up and grab your stuff or else we’ll be stuck travelling back to London together.”
“Nah, just forget it,” Neville slid the tank back onto the rack and slumped back into his seat. “I’ve learned over the years that keeping him locked up is a fruitless endeavour. I suppose he just likes his freedom. I trust that he’ll come back in the end, he always does.”
Harry was still of two minds about staying in the compartment because he didn’t want to upset Dennis any more than necessary. He decided that if Dennis did ask him to leave then he would do so without complaint. But when he returned to the compartment a little while later, he didn’t say anything to either Neville of Harry. Instead, he avoided their gaze and continued to stare out of the window, ignoring them both. An uneasy silence followed which Neville mercifully broke when he nodded towards the carrier sat beside Harry. “Did you get a new pet?”
“—I hate Hagrid’s rock cakes!” Hermione blabbered uncontrollably. “And his treacle tarts are even worse! Oh my god,
For anyone who didn’t know them, the best indicator for when Harry and Ron were quarrelling was if there was any disruption to their morning routine. Every day, without fail, they would accompany each other to breakfast. But if they were angry with each other, then they would go to the Great Hall separately and sit at opposite ends of the Gryffindor table. Depending on the nature of the dispute, Hermione would have the unenviable choice of who to sit with during mealtimes until the dispute was resolved. While Ron’s reaction the previous evening had been better than Harry had anticipated, he was still half-expecting to find his best friend’s bed empty when he got up. So when he threw open the curtains around his four-poster, he was pleasantly surprised to find Ron still there, pulling on his school robes with immense effort. He looked up at Harry with a grumpy expression, his eyes pink and puffy from lack of sleep.
“Alright, I’ve listened to enough of this,” Draco growled. He began to push his way through the leafy branches of the Alihotsy tree, but Harry grabbed him by the arm and pulled him back.
Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s ear and whispered, “You promised me that you’d fuck me. Breed me. Make me yours…”
Draco ducked as three bright yellow canaries flew over his head and out of the Hospital Wing, disappearing down the corridor and out of sight. A very flustered looking witch in nurses robes rushed forward and slammed the door shut behind Draco just as several more canaries attempted to make their break for freedom. They flapped and twittered angrily around the matron’s head before flying off in all directions around the ward, perching on the window ledges and medical cabinets.
“Mr Potter failed to follow my instructions and tried to plant fire seeds without wearing his dragonhide gloves,” she explained. “This is the result.”
“You have your moments,” she joked and a mischievous grin spread across her face. “So tell me, is Harry a good kisser? I bet he is!”
Harry thought carefully before speaking again, “Well, speaking from my own experience, friendships aren’t always easy or straightforward. You expect people that you don’t like to say horrible things about you, but you don’t really care what they think, do you? But when it’s your friends...well, they have the unique ability to hurt you the most; because they know everything about you, and they know exactly what words cut the deepest. Draco in particular, well...his sharp tongue is pretty infamous.”
“Next time you sneak Hermione in here, use a Silencing Charm,” he grumbled, clambering out of bed and stalking towards the bathroom. Rather than have the good grace to look bashful, Ron grinned broadly.
“Yes, there’s a few there I haven’t heard of before,” said Mrs Weasley, looking over Hermione’s shoulder at the list. “Austen, Orwell, Shelley...who are these people?”
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know. But I suddenly have the overwhelming compulsion to speak every thought that enters my head.” Draco frowned and turned to Harry. “That is weird, isn’t it?”
“Very well, then. Mr Longbottom, on the count of three,” said Hestia and Neville pointed his wand at Goyle. “One...two...three…”
“Mr Longbottom, since I pulled your name out of the bag first, you’ll be the first to try and infiltrate Mr Goyle’s mind,” Hestia instructed. “Mr Goyle, are you ready?”
“Usually I like to be taken out to dinner first before I take my clothes off for someone,” Harry joked.
“I wouldn't dream of it, Professor,” she grinned. “I appreciate you agreeing to see me. I must admit, after reading today’s Prophet article I was a little worried that you were going to cancel the interview.”
he thought woefully. Always determined to see the good in everyone, even when there was none to be found. The fact that Harry was inexplicably attracted to Draco illustrated that perfectly.
Draco sounded ashamed at his admission, but Harry cupped him by the cheeks and forced Draco to meet his gaze. “Well, I’m glad that you did.”
They chatted a little more before Draco made his excuses and retired to his room for the afternoon under the pretence of making a start on the pile of homework that he had waiting for him. He strode towards the west wing where his quarters were situated, passing the long line of pale-faced portraits that adorned the wood-panelled walls. He slowed his pace when he approached the drawing room, which doubled as his father’s office. The door was ajar, which usually meant that his father was present. Draco wasn’t particularly keen on conversing with the Malfoy patriarch, but there was no alternative route to his bedroom. He was tempted to turn back and hide in another room until the coast was clear, but Merlin knew how long that would take. Instead, Draco braced himself and walked as quickly and quietly as he could past the drawing room door. If he held his breath and kept his head down, his father might not hear him...
“I will eventually,” he said, tossing the pillow back onto the bed. “I’m not ashamed of who I am, but the less they know, the better. Things are complicated enough with my parents at the moment, it would be better to wait until after I’ve graduated and moved out of the Manor before I speak to them about it. What about you? Do Weasley and Granger know?”
“Look at that headline!” Harry hissed. “Anyone who reads that is going to think that Draco and I...that we’re…”
“I also recall the organisation was famed for its disruption of authority,” Professor McGonagall continued. “All manner of disruptive behaviour broke out: dungbombs were released on a regular basis, rogue Nifflers caused significant damage to school property, there were also enchanted fireworks, if I remember rightly…”
“It’s a matter of principle,” he argued. “I won’t pretend to be something that I’m not. I’m not ashamed of what I am or where I came from.”
Draco caught the pillow in mid-air and smirked at Harry. “Well, you’ve certainly improved with practice, I’ll give you that much.” His smile faltered and he bowed his head. “As someone who hasn’t shown any previous inclinations towards anyone else of the same sex before now, I'm just curious when you realised that you preferred the company of men.”
Harry watched with quiet awe as Draco performed a head-spinning corkscrew manoeuvre through the air before landing gracefully in front of him, looking extremely impressed with himself.
“Are you actually going to rehearse?” asked Harry, sounding a little disappointed. Draco lowered his script and drew him a withering look.
Still, if Draco wasn’t taking Herbology this year, Harry was curious about what he was doing instead. Wherever Draco was going, he was heading there in a hurry. Wondering where Draco was sneaking off to this time, Harry rummaged through his school bag for the Marauder’s Map. Hermione and Ron caught up with Harry then, their argument still in full swing. Ron threw his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him towards the main entrance.
Liv nodded in agreement and declared, “No man could perfectly reveal human nature and the desires of the heart more than William Shakespeare. He perfectly captures the pathos of adolescent romantic love: Romeo, who declares it is pointless to attend the Capulet masquerade ball because he could never
“Before we begin our feast, I have a few important announcements to make,” she began. “Reconstruction on the school is nearing completion. However, as the Quidditch pitch was completely destroyed, it will not be ready in time for a new season to take place this year...”
An incredibly awkward silence followed as neither Harry nor Draco wanted to acknowledge the other, while at the same time taking several furtive glances at each other’s reflections and then quickly turning away whenever one managed to catch the other’s eye. It was the first time that they had seen each other since the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry remembered seeing Draco sitting with his parents in the Great Hall after the battle, looking uncertain as to whether he should even be there. He had the same uneasy expression on his face at the moment, like he was about to turn tail and run out of the shop with the unfinished garment still attached to him. Harry wished that he would, as it would bring a swift end to this most unwelcome reunion. He rolled his shoulders, trying to ease the cramp from keeping his arms aloft for so long. Merlin, what was taking so long?
Harry was loath to admit that the risk of getting caught wrapped up in Draco Malfoy’s arms by an unsuspecting passerby did give him quite a thrill. The school year had been, for the first time since he had become a student at the renowned institution, extremely dull and uneventful. Not that he missed being in constant peril, but without even Quidditch to distract him from the monotony of lessons and homework, he had to find other ways of keeping the blood pumping and Draco was certainly more than capable of doing that.
Draco let out a derisive snort and some of the tension in his shoulders eased. “Not bloody likely. I'm the social pariah of the magical world, remember? Even if I am wealthy, suitresses are hardly lining up to marry a gay ex-Death Eater. Which suits me just fine, I’m not the marrying type, anyway.”
“Mum, stop pestering them,” Ron chided his mother lightly. “If they forget anything now, it probably wasn’t that important to begin with.”
“Nothing,” she replied firmly. Her shoulders sagged when she saw the despondent expression on Harry’s face and replied more gently, “Look, you didn’t do anything wrong, but you can’t change who you are.”
“I suppose I just needed someplace to clear my head,” he explained. “I hoped coming here I might find...I don’t know, a piece of serenity, or something.”
He let out a small gasp of surprise as Draco pushed him against the rough bark of the tree, his expression now predatory. Keeping his hand firmly against the centre of Harry’s chest, Draco quickly discarded his hat onto the ground before carefully slipping his knee between Harry’s legs, deliberately brushing his thigh against Harry’s prominent erection. Harry’s eyelids fluttered in response and he pressed his hips more firmly against Draco’s leg.
Harry kissed Draco harder this time, perhaps for longer than necessary...but he wanted to put on a convincing performance, didn’t he? When he finally broke the kiss, Draco’s eyes fluttered open and he smiled.
“Me neither,” Ron agreed. He kissed the crown of her head and took her hand into his own. “Come on, you know that we can’t leave Harry unattended for more than five minutes or else we run the risk of something else mental happening around here.”
“It’s no more than he deserves, if you ask me,” Ron chipped in. “It’s one thing winding up Slytherins, but that didn’t give him and his mates licence to drag the rest of us into it. We didn’t do anything!”
Harry was tired and irritable when he shuffled into Professor Jones’s class—the first of the day—relieved that it wasn’t an Occlumency lesson but not particularly looking forward to what they were about to learn, either.
“Yes, well as you can see I was occupied with important business,” Liv joked, lifting her chair off of the floor and pushing it back under the desk. Hestia chuckled.
“So? Throw it on the floor for all I care.” Draco ran his hand up Harry’s thigh to cup his growing erection. “Hmm, I think you’d rather stay in bed with me, too.”
Draco smirked and strutted over to sit in front of Harry. Harry wanted the floor to open up and swallow him whole.
Draco pursed his lips and tried to think of a counterargument but drew a blank. “Well...yes, I see your point. Alright, I won’t argue that my audition was anything short of brilliant. But why does Potter get to play Romeo? I could do that role just as well—better, even.”
“I’ve also had a few parents owling me wanting assurances that their child won’t be turned away at the school gates,” said Minerva. “I even received a letter from Azkaban from Theodore Nott’s father begging me to grant his son readmission. Although, I must admit, I was surprised that Narcissa Malfoy contacted me requesting that Draco be allowed to resit his final year.”
“Morning!” Hermione replied in an unusually high pitch while Ron merely grunted like a troll. The atmosphere was tense at the breakfast table, but Ron and Draco both managed to refrain from slinging insults at one another, which was really the best that Harry could hope for. When Hermione had finished her meal, she informed the group that she was headed for the library.
One thing that he had not missed, however, was dragging himself out of bed for early morning lessons. Harry had always been more of a night owl, and after spending a long summer with no fixed time to get out of bed, having to get up at the crack of dawn for classes was a bit of a shock to the system. The early morning sunlight poured through the boys’ dormitory window, slowly crawling up Harry’s bed until it reached his face. Still half-asleep, Harry buried his face into his pillow to shield his eyes from the sunlight. He was annoyed at being woken up so early, especially since he’d just been having the most wonderful dream. He couldn’t remember the particulars of it, but it had involved flying atop paper aeroplanes with a particular blonde-haired sort-of friend of his that would remain unnamed.
Harry closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, calming himself as best as he could. Finally, he gave Draco a curt nod. “Alright, I’m ready.”
The students quickly dispersed and took their positions while Liv and Hermione took their seats at the front of the stage on their directors’ chairs. Hermione was shuffling through her already extensive script notes, making suggestions to Liv while Michael Corner approached the front of the stage, cleared his throat, and began to recite his speech. “Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes unplagued with corns will walk a bout with you…”
“I don’t get it. Did you ever actually fancy her?” he asked. “Or any girl for that matter? You seemed really into Cho back in the day.”
“Well, have you ever flown in an aeroplane?” she inquired. “Or been to the cinema to watch a film, or listened to Prokofiev—do you even know who Prokofiev is? No? Well, wouldn’t it be better for you to experience some of these things first-hand before dismissing them? Then you can decide whether or not they’re of any use to you.”
Harry sat in one of the sagging armchairs by the fire with Asha snoozing on his lap. The Gryffindor common room was in semi-darkness; the flames of the dying fire were the only source of light, emitting a soft, orange glow on the threadbare rug beneath Harry’s feet and warming his legs. He stroked Asha absent-mindedly as he stared into the flames, envious that his mischievous mustelid could sleep so contentedly; given the dramatic turn of events earlier that evening, she would be the only one sleeping soundly tonight.
Draco rubbed the sore spot on the back of his head, he could already feel a lump forming under his hair. “Yes, I did hit the ground quite hard. No thanks to you, you’re a lot heavier than you look.”
“Really?” asked Snape making no effort to hide the sarcasm in his voice. “I find that very hard to believe.”
Harry couldn’t help but notice that she didn’t deny that this was the fate that awaited Draco that if he did, in their eyes, let Harry down, but he thought better than pressing the matter any further.
“Potter might not care about who I am but other people will,” he argued. “He gets enough flak just for being friends with me, can you imagine what people would say if they caught us canoodling?”
“I quite agree.” She shrugged. “But we were somewhat involved in both events, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he blamed us a
With those parting words, Theo stalked off, leaving Draco feeling sick to his stomach. He glanced around at his classmates, each of whom was busy doing their own thing—catching up on homework, rehearsing lines together, practising their dance moves and sword routines—and wondered who else knew about him and Harry. Surely they weren’t being
Harry did as he was instructed and raised his arms either side of him, posing like a scarecrow. The tailor drew his wand and gave it a slight flick. A small gasp escaped Harry’s lips at the sudden appearance of several measuring tapes floating above his head. He watched with interest as they uncoiled themselves like white snakes and proceeded to take measurements, slithering along his arms, legs, waist and collar. Several lengths of black cloth and a box of silver pins then flew out of a nearby drawer and began pinning themselves to Harry’s body. He couldn’t help but smile to himself at the elegant dance of fabric, tape and pins floating around him as they constructed a basic outfit; no matter how mundane, he would forever be enchanted by magic in all its forms.
Professor Sprout checked the name on the trunk and chuckled. “That’s Sybill’s trunk, Argus. You’d better put that back unless you want her hexing you.”
Harry didn’t need any more persuading. Draco beckoned Harry to follow and led him through a door on the right side of the Entrance Hall, along the dungeon corridor and down the narrow, spiral staircase towards the Potions classroom. Draco cast Harry a curious look when, without prompting, he came to a full stop at the stretch of blank stone wall in front of the hidden entrance where the Slytherin dungeon was located.
Harry snuggled into his pillow and tried to focus on the dream, hoping that if he fell back asleep his dreams would take him soaring above the clouds again, but just as he was dozing off, he jerked awake at the sound of muffled giggles that sounded like they were coming from Ron’s bed. Harry turned, bleary-eyed and half-blind without his glasses, towards Ron’s bed and found that, unusually for him, the curtains around his four-poster were drawn. Harry groaned and after fumbling blindly for his wand, pointed it at Ron’s bed and whispered a Silencing Charm. It was bad enough walking in on his best friends mid-coitus a couple of times at The Burrow, the last thing that he needed was to hear them engaging in their carnal desires when he was trying to sleep.
Ginny didn’t look particularly pleased to be receiving help from Draco but she kept her mouth shut. Draco seemed equally reluctant to leave but he gave a careless shrug.
Dennis, dressed head to toe in black, threw her a mutinous look but said nothing. Harry hadn’t interacted much with Dennis since the school year had started, but up close he was shocked to see how poorly he looked. He had always been small and scrawny for his age, but even under the heavy black cloak, it was obvious that he had lost a lot of weight. His complexion was pale as though he hadn’t seen sunlight for months, which made the purple shadows under his eyes even more pronounced. Despite his sickly appearance, his expression was one of determination and defiance.
Harry looked absorbed in his own thoughts for a few moments before his eyes suddenly widened and a smile spread across his face. Grabbing Draco’s hand he gave it a slight tug.
“All I mean is that you’re really missing out on a great story,” she argued. “The play is set in Verona—that’s in Italy.”
Some students still grumbled under their breaths, but the protest was somewhat muted now that they knew the headmistress was on board with Liv’s plan. She gathered a large bundle of scripts from her desk and began distributing them to each of the reluctant students.
“Have you had the chance to fly again since we were last here?” asked Harry, following Draco as he waded through the grass to the centre of the pitch.
The station was practically heaving with them. Streams of people passed his vision in a technicolour blur as they marched in all directions, staring straight ahead with stony expressions. People kept bumping into Draco, knocking his shoulder left and right without even apologising, disappearing into the swarm of bodies before he could even protest. Shaking his head in disbelief at how rude everyone was, he balanced on his tiptoes and looked in all directions, but all he could see was more people and no obvious signs of an exit.
“Tell me about it. Actually, that reminds me—I’ve got something for you.” Harry clambered off of the bed, threw open his trunk and began rummaging through it, searching for something. He pulled a small parcel roughly wrapped in paper and string from the bottom of the trunk and sat next to Draco again. Holding out the parcel to him, he said, “I know it’s a bit early, but merry Christmas.”
Liv smiled approvingly at Harry. “An excellent observation. It’s interesting, isn’t it? The play is primarily viewed as a romantic tragedy, but arguably, it is more of a critique on the nature of hatred than of love; as you say, it is hatred, not love, that determines Romeo and Juliet’s fates, as well as that of Mercutio and Tybalt. The atmosphere is set from the very first scene; the hatred that the Capulets and Montagues feel for each other predicts the outcome of future events in the play, and it is this hatred that ultimately leads to Romeo and Juliet’s demise.”
“It’s a common misconception, but the play isn’t about fate or destiny—it’s about the human condition,” she argued. “Shakespeare believed that people are governed more by their faults than their strengths—it’s a theme that’s present in many of his works.”
“Someone wrecked Myrtle’s bathroom and left you threatening messages,” Harry countered. “There’s plenty to talk about.”
Liv clinked her cup against Hestia’s and downed the last dregs at the bottom of the tankard before placing it carefully on the table again. Checking her watch, she was surprised to see that it was so late in the evening.
The piercing cry cut the tension between Harry and Draco and they jumped away from each other in surprise. Draco was still wearing Harry’s glasses so he couldn’t see what was happening but he heard the unmistakable
“Well, because you’re so…” Liv gesticulated at Hestia as though it were obvious. Hestia snorted and took a swig from her drink, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.
“Alright, everyone!” Hestia called to get the students’ attention. “Let’s take a break there, shall we?”
It was an unpleasant sensation, viewing someone’s memories like this. Harry remembered all too well what a brief glimpse of Snape’s memories had been like. The worst part of Legilimency for Harry, the most invasive part, was that unlike a pensieve—where he viewed memories at arm’s length—he could actually feel the other person’s emotions as well as see their memories. He remembered Snape’s emotions when he had momentarily infiltrated his mind—the fear, the frustration, the inadequacy—and Harry felt as though he had glimpsed at something that wasn’t his to look at. He had the same uncomfortable feeling when he entered Neville’s mind; he could sense his friend’s fear but also his trust in Harry. He slipped his wand into his pocket and braced himself. If Neville trusted him enough to access his memories, Harry ought to put the same trust in him.
What did Harry know about fashion? He’d spent most of his life wearing Dudley’s hand-me-downs, so he didn’t feel like he was the best person to get fashion tips from. But rather than argue this point, Harry gave Neville a quick once-over and thought that he looked like the kid from the Milkybar commercials, but said that he looked like John Wayne instead. Neville, not knowing who that was, looked confused, but Harry assured him that it was a compliment. When they reached Liv’s class they found her waiting outside the classroom for them.
McKinley shook his head vigorously, causing the bells on his hat to jingle even louder. “N-no, Professor! I swear it wasn’t me!”
“You!” he hissed. His beetle-black eyes darted between Harry, Ron and Hermione. “The three of you! What are you doing here?”
“Just drop it,” Draco warned. “It’s not something I want to talk about, least of all with you.” Unwilling to discuss the matter any further, Draco used wandless magic to draw the curtain around his bed.
Draco stiffened at the sound of Harry’s voice. When he caught sight of Harry’s reflection in the mirror, his light grey eyes momentarily widened with panic before he quickly schooled his expression into its usual sneer.
A few minutes passed and another paper aeroplane flew into the room, landing on the messy desk. Tearing open the letter, Liv read the short reply and sighed, thumping her head against the desk. She looked equal parts relieved and distressed that her younger cousin had also decided to turn up for work.
Minerva drew her a curious look, “Only Order members know how to cast the messenger spell using the Patronus. How did you…”
She hastily scribbled a note on the front page of the script, tapped it with her wand again, and a moment later the script began to flap its pages like the wings of a bird before it soared out of the classroom and down the corridor out of sight.
“No,” said Liv quietly. “I did see her again a few years ago. She’d come over on Ministry business—she was the American liaison during the English Quidditch World Cup and had a few meetings with Ludo Bagman. I had a pleasant but brief conversation with her; she’s married now, got a couple more Crups...she seemed happy, which is the best I could have asked for.”
“I feel the same way about Muggle Studies,” Neville’s shoulders sagged. “Okay, ‘not confident’ is a massive understatement—full disclosure, I know nothing about Muggles. The only part of the Muggle world I’ve ever visited is King’s Cross Station so I could board this train! How in the name of Merlin am I going to pass that class?”
“A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!” she sighed, a mischievous grin teasing her lips. “Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.”
It was easier to be angry at Draco Malfoy than it was to sympathise with the impossible position that he had been put in. Because if she couldn’t blame him for her friend dying, who could she blame? She had blamed Severus, of course, not knowing until the closing moments of the final battle that Albus’s death had been orchestrated by the old headmaster in the first place. She was angry at them for not trusting her, but she had loved them both in life and had forgiven them in death. She wasn’t sure if she was quite ready to forgive Draco Malfoy yet. If only he had come forward and asked for help, things might have been so very different—Albus, Severus, Merlin knows how many others, might still be alive. It was easier to blame a boy who was foolish and afraid than it was to blame herself. She should have listened to Potter when he’d voiced his concerns over Draco’s behaviour, but she had dismissed him, convinced that his accusations were unfounded. She should have done more. If only she had listened, they might all have lived.
Asha squeaked again and hightailed it down the spiral staircase out of sight. Harry closed the door, hoping that would be their only interruption this evening. “Sorry about that.”
“I suppose I better,” he sighed. “I’ll admit that my grasp of Muggle cultural references is fairly limited. I might need your assistance on this one.”
“No, I think this is enough physical interaction for today,” he replied firmly, withdrawing his hand.
“Of course, since I let you have a shot of my broomstick, I think it’s only fair that I get a ride of yours,” Draco teased.
One thing that he was certain of though, was that the Weasley clan hated him and his family, and he would be the first to admit that their hatred wasn’t misplaced. After all, his father had spent years making Arthur Weasley’s life at the Ministry an absolute misery, and delighted in doing so. That familiar dark cloud that Draco fought to avoid on a daily basis loomed overhead yet again, the futility of his situation bore down on him all of a sudden. Even if his parents somehow accepted his relationship with Harry (and that was a big if), he couldn’t imagine the Weasleys welcoming him into the family with open arms. Harry might have been able to convince Ron and Hermione to keep quiet about their relationship, but neither of them really accepted it. And if Harry couldn’t convince his best friends to accept him, what chance did he have of convincing anyone else?
Harry sighed and rolled over onto his side, hugging himself and wishing that he had someone to talk to about his feelings. It was in moments like these that he missed Sirius the most, although he could imagine his godfather’s reaction if he admitted to liking Draco Malfoy of all people. “A rose by any other name” Shakespeare said. If Draco wasn’t a Malfoy and he wasn’t Harry Potter, maybe things would be so much simpler. But they weren’t and it wasn’t. Harry’s life was one of neverending drama. Harry closed his eyes and fell into a restless sleep. He supposed he ought to just accept that already.
“I don’t want it advertised!” Harry snapped. “It’s bad enough having to perform this stupid play in front of the whole school, I don’t need the rest of the world knowing about it, too!”
The Three Broomsticks was always packed on a Saturday afternoon but they managed to find a small table in the corner of the pub to themselves. After Hestia shed her heavy cloak and scarf, she made her way to the bar to get the first round of drinks while Liv patiently guarded their table and seats. A couple of the students caught her eye and waved and she smiled politely in return. Her smile widened as Hestia quickly returned clutching two foaming tankards of Butterbeer.
Hermione looked thunderstruck while several other students cheered and applauded this news. Neville looked visibly relieved while Draco didn’t react at all. Liv thought that news would go over well with most of them.
“Not sleeping on the job are you, dear?” Umbridge sneered, her pouchy eyes narrowing. Liv shook her head vigorously.
“Dirk was right: years of friendship had to count for something,” said Liv grimly. “I’d sat on my hands and done nothing for long enough. I went over to his house that evening and doctored his family tree and birth certificate to show that he was a half-blood—he wasn’t going to pass for a pureblood, but as a half-blood, he’d be afforded some protection. I went over to Ted’s later that evening hoping to do the same thing for him. Of course, these sort of things seldom go as we plan them to…”
Dennis lurched forward, snatched the polaroid from the desk and turned it over. Harry felt his stomach clench when he saw that it was a picture of Colin and Dennis, smiling and waving in their school uniforms. Harry knew all too well that Colin had a passion for photography, and it appeared that he had quite the talent for it, too. The picture was beautiful in its simplicity, a perfect moment in time captured of the two brothers, frozen forever, blissfully unaware of the tragedy that would befall them. Dennis stared at the photograph in his lap, his face screwed up in pain and anger.
“Oh, that’s lovely to hear.” Liv blushed, looking pleased. “She was a great manager, I learned a lot from her.”
It surprised Draco how relieved he was that Myrtle was speaking to him again—not that he’d ever admit that, of course. He had, however, banked on her curiosity overruling how angry she was with him; evidently, he was right. “Well, I’m not heading straight home. I’m going to Muggle London for a few days first.”
Draco worried his lip in silent contemplation for a few moments before admitting quietly, “I'll admit that I have some idea what that feels like. While it’s true that being gay in the magical world is largely accepted, being an unmarried pure-blood with no heirs is still frowned upon.”
The lion’s long white whiskers twitched a little but otherwise, it remained sound asleep. Hermione cast an uncertain glance back at Ron and Harry, who were gesticulating wildly while they silently mouthed for her to run away. Instead, Hermione turned back to the lion and took a step closer to it before speaking a little louder.
“I haven’t had the chance to try it out yet,” he said, holding the broomstick out to Draco. Draco looked between the broomstick and Harry.
“I wasn’t gawking!” he mumbled in protest. “I just can’t believe that he’s actually showed up. He’s got some nerve…”
“Their love is doomed and the lovers die at the end of the play, in each other's arms.” Myrtle sighed dreamily, her pale, misty eyes glazing over.
“Sure,” Draco glanced at the old Cleansweep Harry had laying beside him. “Tell me something—why are you flying that old thing? It’s hardly fit to sweep the Manor, let alone fly.”
“You’re not going to be the only one seeing thestrals this year,” Harry reminded him. “I imagine quite a few people saw them for the first time tonight.”
Hermione had then disappeared behind her book again and had refused to discuss the matter any further. Fine. If Hermione wouldn’t talk about it with him, Harry could always rely on Ron to have his back. His best friend had always been more than happy to sit and abuse Malfoy’s character until the mooncalves came home, but even he had grown a little weary of Harry’s complaints after the first week.
The tailor eyed the pair’s heated exchange with interest. “I take that you gentlemen know each other?”
Draco cocked an eyebrow at him. “What is it about you Gryffindors and your inability to hold a civil conversation?”
“Whispering your lines. Can’t you just read without making any noise?” Draco complained. Harry tsked and bowed his head.
“Oh, I’m not looking for anything in particular,” Liv lied, casting a silent Vanishing Spell on the book. “I’m just browsing today. You know me, always on the lookout for another book.”
Liv shrugged and set the plate back onto her desk. “Suit yourself. I actually wanted to have a word with you at the end of the lesson, but you left the classroom in such a hurry that you even forgot your script.”
“How am I supposed to study if I don’t even have use of my hands?” he asked hotly, lifting his bandaged limbs aloft to demonstrate his point.
“Right. Look, I want to apologise for what happened the other night,” he began. Draco’s smile fell but Harry continued, “I really wasn’t expecting to be able to get inside your head. Seeing someone else’s memories...it’s like reading their diary, only it’s so much worse because you’re able to feel what they feel, too. It’s embarrassing and awkward and I understand why you were upset.”
On the morning that the students were due to depart Hogwarts for the Christmas break, Draco got up a little earlier than usual to pay Myrtle a visit before breakfast. For her part, Myrtle had stuck to her word and had made no attempt to drown Draco in toilet water since their falling out on Halloween. But his disembodied friend had remained aloof with him in the weeks since, ignoring his summons any time he visited her bathroom or quickly excusing herself before disappearing through a wall. If anyone else—living or dead—were so rude to him, Draco would likely have thrown in the towel and left them to it. He also knew that if the shoe was on the other foot, he would have behaved in a far less courteous manner than simply giving his friend the cold shoulder. But after everything Myrtle had done for him, she was a rare exception to this rule. So he had persisted, dropping off the Daily Prophet for her every day as a small peace offering.
“He might be a bigoted, evil scumbag, but he’s an opportunist above all else,” he argued. “The Malfoy’s name is in the dirt now. What better way to climb back to the top of the social ladder than by getting on your good side?”
“I didn’t say that,” Harry replied quickly. “It’s just...I’m surprised that you’re being so candid about your feelings, is all. Usually, it’s like getting blood from a stone.”
“Me too,” said Harry. He hesitated a moment before suggesting, “Well...since we’re both reading the same scene, wouldn’t it make more sense if we rehearsed together?”
"You can’t help the way that you’re born. Why should you be treated differently over something that you have no control over?” he raged.
As they approached the Transfiguration classroom, they were surprised to find their classmates still standing outside in the corridor. Hermione weaved her way to the front of the crowd to find the classroom door closed and Neville standing guard, barring entry to the others.
“Every show that their names weren’t called was a moment of sweet relief before the dread quickly set in again; tomorrow could be the day that they said their names in the list of victims,” Liv said quietly, watching herself trying to tune the radio again. “And then one day...they did.”
“I’ll be with you in a moment,” the tailor said to Harry before kneeling at Draco’s side. “I’m just putting the finishing touches to this gentleman’s order.”
Harry’s spirits lifted a little when he heard that. So, he wouldn’t have to do Occlumency lessons after all. He could spend the extra time focusing on Transfiguration instead.
“The fearful passage of their death-marked love and the continuance of their parents’ rage—which, but their children’s end—nought could remove, is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage.” He turned dramatically towards the audience again before sinking into a low bow. “The which, if you with patient ears attend, what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.”
Draco slid his hand from Harry’s hip to grab hold of his neglected cock. It felt impossibly hard in his hand and he knew it wouldn’t take much to make Harry come. He tugged at Harry’s slick prick, sliding the foreskin back and forth in time with the thrust of his hips, hard and fast, just the way Harry liked it. He kept his eyes trained on Harry and watched with a feeling of awe as Harry’s mouth fell open and his eyes glazed over.
“Nothing of note,” said Draco. “Spend the next fortnight at the Manor avoiding my father, I suppose. Nothing new there.”
“There have been rumours of a group in the school who are responsible for all of the unruly behaviour this year, and a lot of what they’re doing bears striking similarities to the group you established in your fifth year.” Professor McGonagall leant forward slightly in her chair. “Harry, I want you to answer me truthfully: have you started up Dumbledore’s Army again?”
“Well, what better place to relax than somewhere that you find peaceful?” said Draco. “Make yourself comfortable: keep sitting cross-legged, lie down, whatever makes you feel most relaxed.”
“That’s a clever way of saying you’ll turn a blind eye to letting Death Eaters come back here to receive an education,” Dennis argued. “You should have kept the Slytherins locked up in the dungeon and thrown away the key.”
Happy New Year, everyone! It's been a while, hasn't it? Sorry about that. Inspiration for other projects got their claws into me and I kept putting this poor story on hold. But it's always been floating about in my head, and my new years resolution is to complete my WIPs, starting with this one. I'm working hard on the next chapter now, but I wanted to get this posted ASAP just as an assurance that the story hasn't been abandoned. I get frustrated when other authors do that, and I don't intend to become the thing that I hate! Thank you to all of you returning to this story after a shamefully long absence. Your patience will be rewarded.
They chatted as they climbed several flights of stairs. Harry, who was used to walking this route every day, couldn’t help but chuckle at how breathless Draco was getting. Draco grimaced and rubbed a stitch in his side after they reached the foot of the seventh flight of stairs.
“In the pipes somewhere.” Draco bowed his head in shame before admitting, “She knew that there was something up with me but when she tried to ask me about it, I lost my temper. I think I hurt her feelings.”
“I really appreciate your help with this,” said Harry. “I can paint walls well enough but I’m no Picasso.”
“They’ll be fine,” Harry assured him. “You’re with me, so nobody will say anything. Besides, most folk will be out at the Frog Choir show tonight.”
“Yes, Draco told me all about how you helped him,” she said, giving Harry an approving smile. “It’s a shame that you’re not doing
A murmur of agreement rippled throughout the room as the portraits bearing generations of headmasters and headmistresses nodded in solemn agreement. Minerva McGonagall wasn’t the first person to cry in this office and she certainly wouldn’t be the last.
Draco sighed and twirled the mirror in his hand. “We Slytherins are well aware that the rest of the school hates us. They always have but we’ve always taken it in our stride. Hell, it was a mark of pride for some of us. I’ll admit that I enjoyed how much our victories seemed to rile up the other houses, especially the Gryffindors. We were never going to be loved, so it was better to be reviled, to be feared. But after everything that’s happened, especially in the last year...well, most of us take the abuse as a penance of sorts.”
“You’d think she’d have learned her lesson after the last time,” Ron mused. “Spending several days in a glass jar would make anyone think twice about writing anything negative about Harry.”
“My only love sprung from my only hate!” she despaired. “Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me, that I must love a loathed enemy.”
Harry sighed. He knew that Ginny meant well, but he wasn’t exactly famed for being open and honest about his feelings. Their friendship might be on rocky ground at the moment, but he still valued her opinion. “This summer...it’s been a bit mental, you know?”
“Weasleys’ Wildfire Whiz-bangs,” said Hermione mournfully. “One of Fred and George’s creations. Unlike most fireworks, when you attempt to vanish or stun them, they explode and multiply exponentially. Thank god Ron realised what they were, otherwise the entire hall could have gone up in flames.”
Umbridge grinned. “Excellent! I look forward to working with you, Miss Tonks, you came highly recommended.” Umbridge turned on her heel and strode towards the exit. Pausing at the door she turned to Liv and said, “Be sure to get those records to me as soon as possible. And congratulations on your promotion.”
Harry’s eyelids fluttered shut as Draco sucked and kissed his neck. “If you keep doing that, I’m going to spill my coffee.”
way. That means no magic will be used in the creation of costumes, makeup, set pieces or lighting. Yes, Miss Granger, do you have another question?”
A sombre silence followed as Liv reminisced about the many lost loves in her life. She hadn’t intended for the evening to take such a woeful turn, but Hestia was always such an attentive listener and, despite the subject matter, it still felt good to open up to her and reveal a little more about herself.
“Oh, for the love of Merlin—Malfoy, I promise that she won’t bite you,” said Harry firmly. Sitting Asha back onto his lap, he rummaged through his jeans pocket and pulled out a fistful of tiny biscuits. Draco’s eyes widened as Harry grabbed his hand and tipped some into his palm. “Here, give her these.”
Just then, Ginny’s raucous laughter filled the busy corridor and she lightly slapped Theo on the chest. Theo’s face broke out into a goofy grin and Ron’s scowl deepened.
“Agreed,” muttered Draco darkly and Harry gave him a weak smile. He supposed Draco knew all too well what that was like.
Harry had completely forgotten about the auditions and the play. He was only reminded when he entered Liv’s classroom and saw the large stack of scripts sitting on her desk. Taking his usual seat at the back of the class, Harry’s mind wandered, more interested in what he was going to have for lunch than trying to guess who would be cast in which roles. When everyone had taken their seats, Liv cleared her throat and smiled at them.
Ron plopped the leafy garland on his head and sighed as his miserable reflection stared back at him in the mirror.
Reluctantly, Neville stepped aside and Harry cracked open the classroom door, peered inside and immediately slammed the door shut again.
Ron scoffed, “You’re the one who declared him your nemesis on the first week of school! You’ve hated him for years and now all of a sudden, you two are acting like you’re best mates. How am I supposed to react?”
In an instant, the noise of the city was drowned out by the wind roaring past his ears as he spun blindly through the blackness, but just as suddenly, the wind dissipated and his feet hit ground quite different from the one he’d just left behind. Draco didn’t immediately open his eyes. Instead, he listened. Here, he had to strain his ears to detect any sound. He could just pick up the
“What the hell is going on?” asked Draco aloud as Harry scanned the room for his friends. He spotted Ron and the others near the centre of the room; Ron was now red in the face as he and Ginny screamed at each other while Hermione appeared to be babbling incoherently, tears streaming down her face as she did so.
It went without saying that they would have to be quiet, lest the poor shopkeeper found them as they would most definitely get kicked out, and wouldn’t that be embarrassing. Still, the risk of getting caught wasn’t enough to dissuade Harry from engaging in a very quick and very quiet hookup with his boyfriend. On the contrary, the risk of getting caught made it more exciting. But Harry wasn’t worried about getting caught because he knew he could be quiet if he needed to be. He’d spent several years sharing a dormitory with four other teenage boys: he had ‘keeping quiet’ down to an art form now.
Draco raised his eyebrows in mock surprise. “Deary me, Potter, I was only trying to make polite conversation.”
Although the volume of work seemed insurmountable, Minerva was determined to fulfil her duty as Headmistress and get everything ready on time. She had little time for distractions, but she could not help but be distracted by the most recent article posted in The Daily Prophet. She bristled as she read the article for the third time:
Harry snatched up the parchment in disbelief. It looked very similar to the enchanted parchment Hermione had made members of Dumbledore’s Army sign when they had joined the former duelling club, only the header had POTTER’S ARMY scrawled across the top in scratchy capital letters. The list of names was largely unknown to him, but a couple did catch his attention: Jack Sloper, a fellow Gryffindor and former Quidditch teammate of his, and Susan Bones, a Hufflepuff student in his year, were listed as members. Harry looked at Professor McGonagall and he shook his head.
Harry and Draco watched as Madam Pomfrey slung the giant butterfly net over her shoulder and marched out of the Hospital Wing, leaving them alone.
“The usual,” Theo shrugged. “Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater and least popular person in the wizarding world, is ‘attempting to revamp his tarnished image by taking part in a controversial Muggle play that centres around the love and tragic demise of the title characters’.”
“Piss off,” Harry laughed, but he quickly dropped his smile as he heard someone clear their throat behind him. Harry and Draco turned to find Hestia looming over them with her arms crossed.
“Either you go to Professor McGonagall and tell her that you wish to withdraw from the school since you’re old enough now to make that decision on your own. Or you stick it out, whether it’s for love of learning or because it’s the last thing that people expect you to do. Whatever your motivation is, at least you won’t leave here empty-handed.”
Tom led Harry and the others out of the side exit, bypassing the bar completely, to the small, walled courtyard where the entrance to Diagon Alley was hidden. Harry pulled his Invisibility Cloak out of his backpack and slipped it over his head. Once Harry was hidden from view, Mrs Weasley tapped the wall three times with the tip of her wand and an archway into Diagon Alley slowly began to take shape.
“What does it look like I’m doing?” Draco asked. He floated a few trinkets from atop his bureau to the surface of his window seat and began sorting them into two separate piles. His gaze ticked to Harry. Then, as a simple, unapologetic fact: "I was angry."
Harry’s heart skips, twice — a funny little hiccuped beat. He looks at the stars and says, “That’s exactly what I thought, too.”
Harry let Malfoy move his wand hand away, because — he did. He’d had front row seating for that show, knew precisely what Malfoy was prepared to do to protect her. It was probably the most decent thing about him. And the worst.
Draco nibbled on his lip and stared down listlessly at the gifts on his bed. He didn’t want to do it. He
that Potter’s feet were dirty, or that he was less afflicted with modesty in the showers than he was in the dorms, always disappearing into the loo closet before bed to change. No, in the
of them.” She displays it, turning it over for Narcissa’s perusal, then smiles slowly. “I’m going to use it to speak with Harry today. And then I’m going to speak to your son.”
"If my parents had come today—” He broke off with a grimace and shook his head, gaze dropping. A tinge of pink coloured his cheeks, his thighs tensing under Harry’s hands. Self-conscious, Harry started to pull away, but Draco moved too fast, snapping the coil of his fingers around each of Harry’s wrists to keep his hands where they were. He took a long, unsteady breath, then lifted his eyes back to Harry — intent, sharp. “What did Bill say?"
Draco watched Pansy hustle Blaise past Potter, slamming the door behind them. There was a beat of silence.
Harry frowned and said, “You do?”, only realising how insulting it sounded when Malfoy shot him a sharp look of dislike, as if he couldn’t help it, before dropping his gaze just as swiftly. Malfoy tossed the moss he’d collected into his own basket and stood up, wordless again, which was nothing Harry should have felt bothered by, but did. He said, “Only because Neville didn’t know what they were called until third year.”
Her hair is messy, dark, half-covering her face, and she walks with a limp, her slender shoulders rounded forward. Her pale green dress flutters in the breeze, its skirt stained with blood. She’s got no shoes on, and she’s so petite, the delicate bones of her feet reminding him of—
Draco chances a kiss against Harry’s brow. “It’s a children’s story,” he whispers, though Harry is fast asleep. That's a message on its own, he thinks, like the letters Draco keeps in his trunk:
good, crisp like costly aftershave, his gusted breaths flavoured like wine. And more, a hint of heat, of salt, tantalising on the back of Harry’s palate with each inhale he took, new and masculine; like the first, clean beads of sweat; like precome. Malfoy started making sounds, low and growly little grunts, which made everything worse and infinitely better — both the sounds themselves, and the angry way Malfoy tried to cut them off each time, only for a new one to escape on his next exhale. Harry rode him harder, his cock pushing out from the slit in his boxers and leaving a wet trail low on Malfoy’s stomach after a particularly hard thrust.
Malfoy levitated a black trunk from the top of one of the stacks. It was free of stones, but the wood — ebony, Harry thought — was decorated with elaborate carvings. Malfoy tapped it a few times with his wand. “I saw— that thing gone, dead. No longer in my house.” He swished his wand differently and the hinge of the trunk popped open with a fragile little click. Malfoy moved to the side to let Harry see the confetti of multi-coloured specks inside, glittery as stars, all smaller than Harry’s pinky-nail. Malfoy sifted them through his fingers. “Mermaid scales.” Harry must’ve made a sound, because Malfoy glanced at him again. “They would have been gathered. You can’t harvest mermaid scales from their tails without express permission, and no one ever gets that. But you can gather ones that have been shed; on the shore; in the water. They’re really rare. I’ve only ever seen them in pictures, couldn’t even go looking for them near the edge of the Black Lake because the water gave me hives. Why?”
Hermione laughed quietly, but shook her head. “Your… interest,” she said, grimacing, “in him could interfere with your promotion, if... Harry, Malfoy’s not
“I want you to,” Draco says quietly. Potter’s cock throbs, drooling out more precome over Draco’s fingers, and Draco darts a lick against Potter’s earlobe. “Think about how my face would look, covered in your come. Can you see it?”
“Another round of laps?” Malfoy asks after a minute, chest still lightly heaving. It’s more of a wheeze, really, or even a whisper, but that’s something they’ve both got in the habit of, speaking as though they’re sharing secrets. It fosters a weird sense of affinity between them, and Harry doesn’t like it, doesn’t like that the confidential tone of Malfoy’s voice, its huskiness, reminds him of things he’s heard from Hermione and Ron. He can’t allow himself to care more than he already does; he’ll be happy when there’s enough distance from the city to speak at conversational levels again.
“So merely being drunk in my presence is enough to set that off?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow when Malfoy lifted his drink. “Maybe you shouldn’t—”
Harry glances at Draco, surprised. He’s still sitting on the wall but upright now, rigid. Watching. “No.”
” Draco twisted his wrist to remove it from Harry’s grip but left his hand in place, fingers roaming over the length of Harry’s erection.
a sex shop. Toys and other sexual aids are mainly a side business. As the sign outside said, they work primarily with clothing.”
Malfoy’s face was close, his eyes glittering at Harry from inches away, his breath tea-sweet. As Harry watched, Malfoy’s smirk faded, his expression transforming into one Harry had only seen a few times before — unguarded and warm and pink-tinged — and never out in the open, as they were.
“But not because you’re…” Harry tries to work it out, tries to keep to the parameters they’ve set in place so he can make a statement of fact, but the answer eludes him. He gives up and says, “Wearing knickers doesn't seem like something that you’d feel the need to hide.”
“He is not waking up when Kreacher came back to tell him that his letter is not posting,” Kreacher said, “and when the clock is striking six, he is having new marks all over, and Kreacher is not being ables to ask Master Harry for helps, Master Malfoy has said, and—”
Neville reddens a little and takes a moment to check the corridor for himself. He doesn’t talk about his private research often but when he does, he can bang on about it for hours — usually when he’s successfully moved on from a new stage of development. The last time he mentioned it, excitedly and with the added brightness of a few too many drinks, he claimed he was nearly finished, just days before the Inferi came to their doors. She only hopes it’s not a sore subject now, years of hard work and all the gold he’s spent on costly trimmings from exotic plants from around the world, potentially washed away along with everything else. But turning back to her, his smile grows.
The intensity in Harry’s eyes refocuses on the call, and Draco forces himself to pay attention. Harry says, “Hermione. I’m here. We’re here. We can go whenever you’re ready. Are you all still okay? God, we have so much to—”
The castle is quiet, supervised quarantine in effect. All of the children are accounted for, watched by either designated elves or professors to stop any errant and accidental magic that might disrupt the flow. Hermione opens the doors and reads herself the riot act as she heads for the Healing ward — thus far, all of their interactions have ended poorly: Narcissa silent and smug, Hermione frustrated and just as clueless. She knows she shouldn’t be surprised but, for the love of Merlin, she can’t figure out Narcissa’s angle. She can’t figure out why Narcissa refuses to cooperate, when her own son is in such danger.
“He asked me about you,” Pansy said. She poked him in the ribs and Draco sighed, stretching out his arm over her pillow. Pansy rested her head on it and curled up against him, wrapping one arm around his midsection, and it really was tiresome of her to make him feel soothed when he didn’t
“They have,” Draco smiles against his shoulder, “enchanted buttplugs for that sort of thing, Harry.”
“Call me that ever again, and I’ll kill you,” Harry said quietly. He sent a silent prayer of thanks to Draco for funnelling out so much of the pain storming through him, but it was still there, edging up to the boundaries of his self control. Robards’ cheeks went ashen as if he could sense how deeply his manipulations had cut, how serious Harry’s threat was. But he merely inhaled after a moment, then drained his drink and set it down.
Lust-shaken, Harry watched him go. He finished off Draco’s drink in two swallows to wet his suddenly-parched throat, set down the glass, and proceeded in the opposite direction.
The Betas you're paired with are fine. They enjoy the fuck and don't want anything serious; they can take your occasional knot with enough lube. It all works out nicely. You rotate through two or three a year and never even growl when you smell another Alpha on them. It's more satisfying than wanking, but not dissimilar. Sometimes you date other men, sometimes you shag them. Wizards outside type-coding.
“Pfft.” Harry shrugged and propped himself on the corner of a dining table. He shot back off. “What the hell?”
Malfoy shoots Harry a wry smile. The flutters in Harry’s stomach apparently like it, because they multiply, and a contingent of them pop down to his knees as Malfoy steps nearer. Voice low, he says, “You’ve got two bathrooms, right?”
Malfoy studied him, looking just as intractable as Harry felt. Then his shoulders slumped a fraction and he sighed, and swallowed, and held out his hand. “You’re Harry Potter,” he said with a pleasant smile. He drew in a deep breath. “Draco Malfoy.”
“How long?” Harry asks. Draco says nothing. His hand is making sounds now, a soft, wet slapping over them, and his cock feels so hard under Harry’s it makes him shake, Draco’s slit streaking damp against Harry’s sac.
It didn’t, shockingly enough, put either of them off their stroke. Harry choked a breathless laugh, and Draco shot him a mischievous grin, his brow still tight with building pleasure, his hips still rising to meet the thrusts of Harry's cock. All of it married perfectly inside of Harry: the violence between them, the play, the affection Harry could no longer pretend he didn’t feel, especially to himself. And none of it was something he had to resign himself to, or figure out, or fit together — it was uncomplicated simply because he
Hermione got up and approached him. Ron, still staring at Harry with a sort of outraged fear on his face, dragged his eyes to her as she slipped her arms around his waist. “I’m sorry too,” she said softly, her cheek pressed to his chest. His fingers sank into the brown cloud of her hair, and he exhaled heavily. Hermione leaned back and looked up at him. “You’re right. I’d have been terrified watching something like that happen to you and not knowing why.”
He was leaving it up to chance, Harry thought. Assuming Harry wouldn’t return to the club, or that he wasn’t serious about the invitation for a dance. Harry was suddenly keen to disabuse him of either of those notions, but he didn’t get the chance; on Friday, Draco didn’t show up.
“Potter…” Her tone changed abruptly, a little frustrated noise choking the word off. Her lips tightened. “Potter will hurt you.”
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose, almost wishing for a headache. At least it’d give him some excuse for the way he can’t seem to make himself
“Your solicitor?” he asked. She whipped around to glare at him, haughty and disapproving, then past him, her face flickering with concern at the bangs issuing from Draco’s door. Harry winced a little; he perhaps shouldn’t have spelled the lock so tight — but it did give him a couple of extra minutes, so he said, “Didn’t you agree not to do that?”
Harry nosed along his throat, inhaling the clean salt-smell of his skin and some sort of essential oil, sandalwood perhaps, before pulling away. Draco stared at him with lust-blown eyes, his shirt entirely unbuttoned and hanging half off his shoulders — unlike Harry, whose shirt Draco had tossed unceremoniously to the floor at some point. Harry grabbed Draco’s wrist and guided Draco’s hand to his cock, applying pressure and biting back a groan.
Draco loosened his fingers from Harry’s stinging scalp and Harry pulled away, licking once into Draco’s slit just to feel him shiver before letting his cock slip out of his mouth. He took a few deep breaths and glanced up; Draco looked wrecked, skin flushed from stomach to hairline, eyes glazed and shocked. He licked his lips and rasped, “You didn’t come.”
Speechless, flooded with thirty different types of adrenaline, Harry wanted to leave, and couldn’t — but couldn’t accompany Draco inside, either. From the doorway, he saw Sirius, in his patented indolent lounge, cock a grin at him from the armchair near the fireplace. And standing next to the fireplace, elbow resting on the mantelpiece, having a smiling argument with Remus. He was leaned against the crook of the sofa, an arm scooped around Harry’s waist as Harry’s head lolled onto his shoulder, and whispering affectionately in Harry’s ear:
Draco edges back just enough to send Harry a distracted sort of scowl and says, “Fuck you, Potter, and make me— uhh, make me— come.”
Harry bit his lip against the groan wanting to come out, but it won — a small sound of needy arousal. Twice during the day, he’d offered, and had either been turned down or had forgotten during foreplay, but— he hadn’t been lying: he wanted to try everything with Draco. Harry moved onto his stomach, body loose, anticipation turning each puff of his breath ragged.
It broke every agreement between them, spoken and unspoken. Every one, but for the contract that had brought them there in the first place. Harry took a deep breath and kissed him again, and, for a moment, didn’t let himself care.
Harry hesitated. He had, as a matter of fact. Upon arriving to his office, Harry’d been dismayed to see that the persistent stack of files he’d gotten used to having piled on his desk had only grown in his absence. His own damned fault, he supposed, for never pointing out he was one man rather than three. For never wanting to disappoint. “Actually, Sir—”
And then you don't need to because… because then, he's there. Your captor's arms fall away; peripherally, you see him slam into the far wall as you crumple to your knees. You hear a growl, a warning, his magic washing over you like music. And his
in some Ministry circles, and—” Her teeth snapped shut with an audible click and she gave him a startled blink, followed by a helpless shrug.
“She wouldn’t even let me apologise. She deserved so many apologies, but wouldn’t let me. I pushed her away, like I did so many people back then,” he says, covering Draco’s hand with his own. Holding it. “I pushed her away and hurt her, and she told me she’d understood. I still felt— I still loved her. But she’d fallen in love with someone else by then, and I didn’t want… She asked me to stand for her at her wedding.”
“Are you mental?” Potter asked. “When have I ever let you win the Snitch from me? I’m a better Seeker than you.”
, calling attention to the rest of the similarities between them — the distinctive shade of their hair, with more golden undertones than Lucius’; the dimple that appeared in her cheek when she pulled away, smiling, to inspect Draco’s face. The shape of their eyes, wide-set and faintly upturned.
Harry shivered and gathered him tighter, fucking himself against Malfoy’s still-firm cock. “Do I— Do I—?” Words gone, Harry slid his fingers between Malfoy’s buttocks, brushed them impatiently over his hole. Malfoy’s trousers were too tight for him to spread his legs, but Harry could turn him over, could have him that way. Could use the slick of Malfoy’s come to push inside.
Hermione's mouth was soft when Harry kissed her. Her lips parted sweetly under his, her small hands resting light against his chest, and she didn't, in fact, taste like onion, but like the treacle fudge they'd gorged themselves on after supper. She was a good kisser. Harry had wondered — a lot when they were thirteen and she'd begun developing, and perhaps a few times since — whether she would be, so it was a pleasant discovery. But that's all it was: pleasant, and a little weird that they couldn’t unlock until George’s charm allowed.
He’s just about to ask even though he’s positive the spell is now leaking magic into the air like a scent that might drive the Inferi mad, when he puts it together: The Magic-Muffling Beads. Harry exhales hard.
But hating Potter? That part hadn’t changed, and it had served me too well to give it up. It entertained me when I was young and bored enough to stay up all night making badges, and it soothed my pride when he stood up for me in front of the Wizengamot. Hating Potter had even distracted me from my nerves the first week of my fellowship, Potter always in the background as chatter from the students — who quickly learned their discussions about Defence while in Potions would cost them House points — and glowering at me in the corridors. I hated everything about the man. Perhaps stubbornly, but it was… comfortable.
“Don’t presume to know my thoughts on the subject. I didn’t even know you were—” I gestured to him irritably and he snorted.
Draco was suddenly jerked awake when the train slowed to a stop and he hit the other side of his head on the bathroom wall.
“He’s lucky that he wasn’t expelled and had his wand snapped in two,” Hermione mused when she’d heard the news.
Harry wondered what had been the catalyst that had precipitated this change in Draco’s behaviour. Was it that night on the Astronomy Tower that had sparked this gradual change? When given an impossible decision—to kill or be killed—despite his fear he had chosen to lower his wand rather than become a killer. Perhaps the turning point had been that moment in Malfoy Manor when Draco couldn’t bring himself to say Harry’s name and condemn him to die. Or perhaps it had been when a Muggle-Born ghost had happened across Draco one day—when he had been at his lowest and had been completely alone—and offered to be his friend. He supposed any number of things could have been the trigger, but whatever the cause, the changes—subtle as they were—were irrefutable.
Liv watched each student’s performance carefully, taking note of who she thought would be suited for acting roles. Her favourite performance undoubtedly came from Luna who, despite only having two lines, succeeded in delivering one of the most memorable performances of the day. Hermione and Ginny stood together at the front of the class while Luna lingered by the nearby window, a serene smile on her face as she watched her friends perform.
“Everyone will be in period costume, Mr Malfoy,” she replied calmly. “Unless you have a penchant for corsets and stockings, I doubt that you would like what the men wore, either.”
Liv peered into the window of Gladrags Wizardwear and was pleased to see that it was packed full of students looking for costumes for the upcoming Halloween party. While her suggestion to perform
“She’s a character this one, ain’t she?” he chortled. “You found her at the Magical Menagerie, ye say?”
“Uh, sure,” said Harry uncertainly, rubbing the back of his neck. “I mean, it’s just acting, right?”
Harry looked as though he wanted to say something then but instead he chewed his lip and bowed his head. Assuming that their short but civil conversation had concluded, Draco levitated the script in front of his face again and proceeded to read in silence. However, Draco only managed to read a couple of lines when Harry spoke again.
“Speak for yourself,” Draco chuckled. “You’re a wanted man, Zorro. There’s a large bounty on your head. I ought to slap some cuffs on you and collect the reward."
Harry gritted his teeth in frustration at Draco rejecting his advice to leave. He considered heading back up to the castle on his own, but instead, he moved back to Draco’s side and peered through the canopy of leaves again. Against his better judgement, he was interested to see what would happen, too. Hermione had finally managed to catch up to them and was trying to calm Ron down while he and Theo squared up to one another. Ginny looked livid as both boys threw a slew of insults at one another, practically nose to nose as they jabbed each other in the chest with their index fingers. As things took a more personal turn (Theo began ridiculing Ron’s costume so Ron started mocking Slytherin house), Harry glanced nervously at Draco who was getting more visibly angry with each passing insult.
“A well-written C.V. only says so much about someone’s character,” Minerva argued. “As much as I trust Kingsley, we haven’t had the best experience with Ministry-appointed staff members at this school. It would be naive of me if I didn’t ask why you were leaving a better job for this one.”
As Harry recited his lines proclaiming love at first sight, Liv and Hermione watched intently as he crossed the stage to be nearer to Draco. On cue, Theo, in the role of Tybalt, and Michael began to argue on stage about the presence of a Montague at the Capulet ball but Harry paid them no mind. He had eyes only for Draco—or Juliet—whatever...
She rather hoped that this year, finally, would be one free of worry, woe, and drama for the young man. Although, this is Harry Potter, she thought wryly. Trouble follows that boy everywhere. She could only hope that whatever drama inevitably darkened his doorstep this year wasn’t anything too dangerous this time.
“What were you two doing in the orchard?” asked Ron suspiciously. He had a plateful of sandwiches in front of him while Hermione sat to his right, perusing over what looked like their school supply list for the year.
wizards. His latest prey, sources report, is none other than the veritable saviour of the wizarding world himself, war hero and vanquisher of The Dark Lord, Harry Potter. No word yet on how Aline, daughter of Henri de Montmorency, Marquis of Chantilly, who is engaged to be married to the Malfoy heir, is taking this latest emotional blow. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy couldn’t be reached for comment.”
“Okay!” said Harry loudly. “I’m going to go and die of embarrassment now. Thanks again for the breakfast.”
“That’s a shame. Arcanus is very good. They have hourly Kelpie shows, although I wouldn’t recommend you sit in the front row unless you want to get soaked. My father took me there once and got drenched from head to toe, he was absolutely furious.”
Draco opened his mouth to reply but Harry shushed him as they approached the entrance to the Great Hall. Draco gaped at Harry in utter disbelief.
Draco hesitated a moment before holding out his prized Nimbus 2001. “You can have a go on mine if you like.”
“If you must know, we’ve been trying to track down her parents but, so far, to no avail,” he explained. “I need you to double check that your office haven’t neglected to give us everything when we requested her files the first time.”
“They’re a bit like Quidditch, but Swivenhodge is way harder,” Ron replied. “You need to ride your broomstick backwards the whole time.”
They didn’t say anything else after that. Draco closed his eyes, hoping that sleep would take him. Slipping in and out between the edges of consciousness, his thoughts returned to the play they had seen earlier that evening and the unsettling parallels between it and his own life. As much as Harry argued that he didn’t care what anyone else thought about their relationship, Draco suspected that it would be a different matter entirely if he had the whole world telling him otherwise. And, if he were being perfectly honest with himself, a part of him was inclined to agree with the rest of the world. Where Harry was kind, honest and brave to the point of stupidity, Draco was selfish and cunning, and he had always prioritised his own wellbeing over everyone else's—well, most of the time, anyway. They were polar opposites in many ways and their relationship defied conventional logic, but for some reason beyond Draco’s understanding, he and Harry just...fit together, somehow. And Harry had said that he loved him—or thought that he loved him, at least—which had to count for something, surely? But Draco just wasn’t sure whether or not that was enough to weather the inevitable tempest that was on the horizon. He hoped it would be.
Hermione and Ron both groaned in response to this comment and, mercifully, the conversation steered away from Harry onto more mundane topics. Sitting down at one of the free stools in Greenhouse Seven, Harry immediately unfolded the Marauder’s Map under the desk and began scanning it for Draco’s name, only vaguely paying attention to Professor Sprout mentioning something about fire seed bushes and dragonhide gloves. He checked the usual places that he might find Draco—the Slytherin Common Room, the kitchens—and just as Harry was beginning to suspect that Draco was either off campus or in the Room of Requirement, he spotted his name in a wholly unexpected place. And yet there he was, sat in one of the cubicles in the girl’s lavatory on the second floor.
Ron gave a careless shrug. “Put a note up on the common room noticeboard asking if anyone knows who P.A. is?”
Harry chuckled and sheathed his sword. “You know, if you read enough books, a hero’s story always turns out the same: he beats the bad guy, finds the treasure, rescues the maiden…”
“I thought it would be fun just to have a year where we got to piss about,” he admitted. “Plus, Harry said he was coming back and I wanted to keep him company. Oh, and you, of course...”
“I know you well enough to know that’s not the reason—at least, not the only one. If something’s bothering you, you don’t have to sit out here mulling it over on your own. You could talk to me about it. We’re still friends, you know,” she reminded him. Harry pulled fistfuls of grass out of the ground, ignoring the query, but he stilled as Ginny rested her hand on his knee.
Liv frowned. “It’s not my intention to humiliate you, Draco. I gave you the role of Juliet because I think that you’re the best person to play the part.” Draco made a dismissive sound and crossed his arms. Somehow, he found that hard to believe. Liv took a deep breath and continued in an even tone, “Think about this logically: do you really think that I would go to the effort of convincing you to stay on at school just so that I could embarrass you by casting you as the lead role in a play? A play that I’m investing a lot of time and resources into? It would be like cutting off my nose to spite my face, wouldn’t it?”
“You don’t look fine,” she pressed. “In fact, you seem quite poorly. Do you have a fever? You should go see Madam Pomfrey and—”
“Nothing,” Ginny replied evasively, snatching one of the sandwiches from Ron’s plate. Ron glanced between Ginny and Harry and a knowing smile spread across his face.
“Don’t worry, Weasley, I was just leaving,” said Draco, snatching his bag off of the floor and hurrying for the exit. Harry’s feelings of elation quickly evaporated and it took his legs a few moments to catch up to his brain before he ran to catch up with Draco.
Everyone quickly paired off: Dean grabbed Seamus, Hermione stepped next to Ron and Neville nodded to Harry. Ginny hooked arms with Luna and Pansy paired with Goyle. When everyone else had paired off, only Theo and Draco were left without partners. Any previous year, they would have immediately partnered up; now, they both looked hesitant. But with no-one else to turn to, they reluctantly approached one another. With everyone now ready with a partner, Hestia addressed the classroom again.
“Yes, well...while it may lack some of the creature comforts Gryffindor Tower has to offer, I much prefer it here,” said Draco. “It reminds me of home.”
“Well, excuse me for not taking style tips from someone that dresses like my great-aunt Druella,” Draco bit back.
“It really isn’t my place to say,” he said evasively. “Best to leave it to the Headmistress to explain.”
Hermione lowered her hand. “One of the main benefits of wandless magic is that if you don’t have access to a wand, you can still perform certain spells, such as Apparition, Levitation and Summoning spells. So, I suppose if you were in a bit of bother, you could try summoning a wand or Apparate to somewhere safe.”
Harry chuckled and fell silent for a minute before saying hesitantly, “I don’t know what’s going on with you and your friends at the moment but...I think it’s pretty shitty that they didn’t come to check in on you.”
“Excellent. Now, if you could please raise your arms, I can begin taking provisional measurements,” the tailor explained.
“Well, if you feel that bad, buy her a gift to make up for it.” He spotted another poster outside Tomes and Scrolls and marched across the road to retrieve it. “How about a new book?
“He told me to stick my script up my arse,” Liv repeated matter-of-factly. “To be honest, I was more upset that he broke my favourite mug.”
Professor McGonagall’s sharp eyes flitted towards the boy in the jester hat and he seemed to wither under her furious gaze. “And you, McKinley? Was it you who added the Veritaserum to the punch?”
Draco gritted his teeth in frustration and banged his head against the wall. There he was again, getting defensive and lashing out at anyone who tried to reach out to him. Theo was right—he was childish.
“See, this is why you’re useless at Occlumency,” he said, jabbing Harry in the shoulder. “You always let your temper get the better of you!”
“Want is a strong word,” he joked. “Look, we’re stuck in here for the rest of the day, it might make the time go by faster if we learn it together. It’s either that or you have to keep listening to me muttering under my breath.”
“Wasn’t I supposed to teach you Occlumency today?” he asked conversationally. Harry waved his hand dismissively.
Draco strained his ears and frowned in confusion as he heard what sounded like the fluttering of wings. Curious, he stuck his head out of the cubicle to see if a bird had flown into the bathroom and was surprised to see what, at first glance, appeared to be a large seagull soaring towards him. A bundle of white paper flew into his outstretched hand and he tutted as he recognised it as the script of
“Today is going to be a practical lesson,” Hestia announced as the students filed into the room. “Everyone just grab a seat for now, we’ll need to go over some safety checks before we can begin. Are we all here? No stragglers? Brilliant. Now, first things first…” She flicked her wand and a large pile of parchment sat atop her desk took flight, distributing a sheet to each of the students. “Everyone needs to fill in a waiver in order to participate in the upcoming practical lessons, which will be held once a week during lessons on Fridays. Everyone here is of age and can decide for themselves whether or not they consent to taking part. Miss Weasley, do you have a question?”
“And tell her what?” Draco snapped, glaring at Harry’s reflection in the mirror. “We both know that she’d be as glad to see the back of me as the rest of them. She’d probably award the culprits for services to the school.”
