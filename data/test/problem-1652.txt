Harry chuckled. "In our world, whoever possesses all three of the Deathly Hallows is the Master of Death. It's also a tale. A tale of three brothers. Three brothers came across a treacherous river which would kill whoever come near it. So the brothers made a bridge over the river. Death showed up, said to congratulate the brothers for their job well done by giving them each a wish.
"How many did you see?" Quill asked.
"Yep." He said changing his sword back into his wand. "Before you start charging, wouldn't you want to know what I know?"
"Sadly." He mumbled.
Draco went over to the door and opened it for them. Arthur made his way in as soon as he could and went over to Merlin's bedside.
Harry smiled as he looked at his family around him.
"There's been recent action in the Death Eater house and a new energy surge."
"Only two days."
Laughter erupted from the room.
"Don't cross me and we won't have a problem. I'm here to do what I did back at the Ministry, take down the bad guys and if that means I have you two shooting me every minute, that's completely fine with me."
"How do you do it?" Merlin asked.
"Obviously, I didn't include Pettigrew. Even though he did die saving me from the Manor."
"14,000,605."
Harry laughed, "Dray, I doubt that's possible. Hermione's the Minister, she's not going anywhere for a while."
, he thought to himself.
"Hi, Sev." Draco smiled, looking a bit warn out as to be expected. He handed the phone to Tony and asked him to connect the phone to the screen they had so they could all see.
Sorry for the late chapter! I was busy all day yesterday and could never get on to post this chapter. Enjoy the longer chapter to make up for it. This was originally gonna end after the reveal, for a bit of a cliffhanger.
Two months after the unexpected visit by Nick Fury, Harry started working at SHIELD. Harry's first day was pretty uneventful (in his eyes, in other people's eyes they would think he had enough adventure for a lifetime). He had his picture taken for his ID. Had to fill out tons of papers about himself, his family and more. He even had to write letters to anyone important to him in case he died. If only they knew he couldn't. Clint Barton, another SHIELD agent, was put in charge of him to make sure he knew all the protocols and information he needed. The protocols were pretty similar to those from his Auror days.
"None found other than the three. We searched all the files but didn't find anyone that was related to the three."
"Scorpius... that's your son right?" The dark skinned one asked.
Harry's eyes snapped open, he hadn't even realized he had closed them.
"It doesn't match any records in the SHIELD systems."
The one at the front was a tall, muscular, blonde man with blue eyes. King Arthur.
"Love, you're only saying that because you're not a pureblood and you were raised by Muggles. Everyone knows the best alcohol was Vocatis' Summa. Mother would take me every year to France just to have it. Of course, that was only once I was over 14." Draco chuckled at his husband.
"Wait, hold on. What's a Death Eater again? Who's the Board? Who the hell is Theodore Nott? Who's Moody slash Barty Crouch Jr? Who's Longbottom? Who's McGonagall? Who's the twin left? Who's the she-weasel? And why is she devastated over her childhood crushes death?" Barton asked.
He looked down for a second and canceled the Sonorous charm silently. As he was looking down, someone started clapping. When he looked back up, his eyes basically left his head.
He put his hand on the bracelet and whispered the same spell again, "
Merlin felt cold. Apparently he wasn't the only one, watching Guinevere pull her robe closer to herself and Leon shiver.
"One magical signature showed. It was a man, but we don't know anything else besides he had a wand with him. Apparently the Death Eaters knew this and have the man as a hostage. Scans show 17 heat signatures and 17 magical signatures, meaning the man is a wizard."
Leon leaned over to the closest person, who was Bruce and asked, "Is it normally this... dramatic?"
It took a couple seconds but she responded with, "It was Doctor Potter's. He would spend his time here with Doctor Banner and Master Snape while he was carrying you and after when he couldn't go anywhere seeing as Agent Potter wouldn't let him go anywhere."
"He's my godson and you're nothing to me so I don't have to do whatever you say," Harry growled.
Draco ran down the hallway, trying to get somewhere safe when a voice stopped him, "Draco."
"Alright, folks." Tony smiled towards the group. "The bar is over this way, photographers that way, auction that way, donation center that way, pool tables that way. Mingle. Make friends. Spend all your money. Get drunk. Have fun."
Teddy got up from his seat and hugged Harry and Draco. "I'm so happy for you guys."
"No one? But all the people who use magic here, their eyes turn gold."
Hermione nodded reluctantly then left.
"Right… um, well… I know you told me not to told anyone but I kinda told two people."
"Did you kill King T'Chaka of Wakanda?"
"Where is he?" Hermione repeated with the same amount of anger as before.
"What were you talking to Natasha about?"
He felt everything. Every death, every birth, every stab wound, every Killing Curse, every Torture Curse. But after that, he felt every hug, every kiss, every I love you, every promise, every happy ending.
"But he murdered Voldemort, the man he was trained to kill. That makes zero sense. And the Cedric Diggory part? It wasn't him. It was Voldemort. At this point I just believe they should be let go."
Draco then came in. Then Rhodey, Wanda and Vision and followed them. Everyone was all geared up in armor, metal suits, or just dragonhide and a wand. Draco stopped short when he saw Bruce.
Two weeks later, Draco and Harry were standing in front of the Avengers (now including Peter, Scott, T'Challa and Bucky, all who had already been told about magic and their pasts) and Pepper, who wasn't an official Avenger, she was more like the mother keeping them all in check.
"When you would tell us about your magic. I said you would do it individually." Percival said.
Draco smiled and left the two of them in the room after he finished changing his bandages.
"Can you show Tony the Mark?"
"Who are the Marauders?"
"Sorry, sir. You may be Draco's godfather, but to me I think you'll always be my professor."
Draco laughed a bit. "Of course you'd know there was something else because of my mother."
Harry, Draco, Sirius, Tony, Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Steve, Rhodey and Thor took a shot.
"Okay, now think of your happiest memory. Use that memory to overpower your magic."
Here's a link for ways to help the Black Lives Matter movement.
"His magic is resisting mine."� Severus said then turned to Sirius, "Come here, mutt."
"You'll have to tell Draco that, he's the one you killed."
Severus on the other hand just turned to Draco with an eyebrow raised. "You expect me to believe that you got Harry to agree to me being a godfather?"
"Is it Loki?" Steve asked Thor.
Quotes come directly from the Avengers: Infinity War script, I do not own those quotes.
When Merlin and Harry arrived at the field, Merlin summoned the dragon. Harry let himself be amazed for the nth time that day.
When she stood up on the podium to address the crowds, she didn't know what to say. She had been doing this for so many years at this point, but this announcement was different. It was an announcement of the death of an old friend. But, instead of a friend, that man had become an enemy.
"Oh, for fuck sake," Sam groaned, "Can you just both admit that you wanna kiss each other's brains out, because it's getting really annoying for the rest of us. Why aren't you even talking anyway? All Severus did was confess his love for Sirius and now they aren't talking!"
"Well, yeah. But in this case, Draco was forced to make a Horcrux by Voldemort. He believed that if he failed, Draco would be the one to carry out his work, seeing as Lucius was his right hand man. And it helped the Draco was the one that we could trust the easiest since he went to school with us. A Horcrux is supposed to cause you to go insane because a part of your soul is missing, also cause whoever around it to be extra mad, mean, et cetera. Basically your feelings are dialed up to an eleven. But before Narcissa died, she and Draco worked on a spell that causes those side effects to go away. That's the reason I was able to bring him back. There's only been one person to ever survive the Killing Curse without anything to bring them back, and like I said earlier, it was me.
"How far along?"
"See, those are the questions you should be asking! Good job, Mr Stark. I am a wizard, as are my husband and my godson."
Harry laughed once more before he fell to the ground, the adrenaline dying out. His eyes faded back into their normal green.
People were screaming. Wands were out, all pointed at the man with the gun, Andrew Creevey, father of Colin and Dennis Creevey. Harry pulled his wand out, ready to cast spells to detain him when Draco fell limply on Harry's body. Draco had been shot.
Draco nodded, "Yes, why?"
"That is classified Ministry business."
Silence followed his statement.
"Now, Mordred, I don't believe that will be necessary. I believe we should talk this through." Harry thought? He didn't know what he was doing, mental connections?
Harry used this opportunity to get Barton down, which he succeeded at, resulting in him finally surrendering under Harry's hold.
"Will my parents be there too?"
(See the end of the chapter for
At that point, he couldn't stay hidden any more. HIs disillusionment charm broke, causing Thanos to draw his attention from Tony who was talking to Harry. The magic was just seeping from the Hallows. There were gold sparks everywhere. It was truly gorgeous. Once the sparks ended, where the Hallows sat was now a circlet. It was silver with a black diamond, like the resurrection stone, placed right in the middle of the band. It reminded Harry of the bracelet he wore, but this one more intricate and only bore the Resurrection Stone in the middle.
The day after Halloween, Draco was still a bit depressed. It's not everyday it's your dead daughters birthday.
Once they were inside the room, Draco pulled Teddy into one of the ridges hidden next to the main entrance.
Then suddenly all the Avengers were going, all suited up, or in Stark's case, ready to suit up if needed.
"Go back where?"
Scorpius gasped. "Can I see it?"
"And that?"
"Please, Hadrian is fine. Lord Black was my go—father." He said realizing that maybe they didn't have godparents so in his current fake life, Sirius was his father.
"Yes, bu– Harry, love, you're brewing that potion all wrong," Draco smiled to himself and sat down next to Harry, "You have to crush the bean by cracking it over the cauldron, not on the table. Like this, watch," Draco took the bean and crushed it over the cauldron, breaking almost instantly because of the fumes being released.
"You said you encountered a dragon when you were fourteen. How did that go?" Merlin suddenly asked.
"So, how much longer are you going to stay here and act like you're not just waiting for Draco and Sirius to finish talking?"
"Maybe I'll meet him some day. Everything here is the same, since it's only been three days here."
Merlin walked into Harry's room, seeing it was empty.
"So you have everything in my vaults?" Snape asked, hesitating a bit.
When he finally opened his eyes, they were a blazing gold color. He stood up, not realizing the all the Avengers were now standing behind him, only facing Thanos and his army.
"No, no, no, no, no!" Pietro yelled as Teddy's body slowly faded away.
"But it's your birthday." Draco said, looking at Harry.
"Of course. This prophecy took over 17 years of my life. People were praising my name before I knew of the Wizarding World. While I was living in a cupboard, people were thanking me for something I didn't remember doing. For something my parents died over. For something I should've died over." Harry said, his voice growing more and more angry as he went on. He took a breath at the end, trying to calm his anger. Thinking about Voldemort made him just want to blow things up. But he had to continue with his mission to get his family back. "Well. Thank you for everything. If you ever feel like world hopping, Earth-616 is where I'll be. preferably after the year 2021, if possible. Hopefully they'll all be back by then." Harry stood from the table. "If you'll excuse me."
"Does Arthur ever find out about my magic?"
Snape looked at Teddy and sighed. "I'm assuming he was raised by Potter, seeing as Draco would probably never let a child dye their hair."
Draco Malfoy was actually nice now that his father was in Azkaban. The thing was, now that his father was gone, he seems happier. He looks happier too, though the same he did during his seventh year (from all the products he uses, Harry assumed). He had been training as a Healer, taking after his mother, and had become Head Healer. He and Harry met up occasionally to discuss new procedures, like new healing spells Harry had to teach the others. After those meetings, they always went out to eat or just to talk. They had gotten rather close over the years.
He heard a gasp from the door. They both turned to the door and saw Draco, Gwaine, Peter and Tony there. If they noticed that Harry wasn't wearing his glasses and was able to see them perfectly, they didn't comment.
Mantis spoke up, a bit shocked, "He is in anguish."
Harry and Sirius nodded and watched as Teddy introduced himself to Argo and winked at Bruce.
"To the Wizarding World?"
"You're supposed to be dead."
"Oh. I didn't think that was a secret. I thought everyone knew."
"Sirius..."
"Yes, of course. Everyone will be there."
Severus rolled his eyes. "You do realize that your brat is going to be the most spoiled child ever because of all the Avengers, correct?"
Teddy sighed and cast a spell that summoned the Knights' armor and some dragon hide armor for Merlin.
Draco's knees buckled. "What'd he do? Did he do anything?"
"Your godfather can be a bloody idiot sometimes, did you know?" Draco asked as he rounded the coroner to get to the Veil room.
"He fell asleep while you were talking with Merlin and Arthur about who you were bringing."
After Scorp was six months old, Harry finally let him go on missions with the Avengers, leaving the baby with Severus seeing as he never wanted to go out to fight.
"She's sick so she asked me to bring Teddy with me." Draco had changed over the years. He visited Teddy at least once a week (from what Andromeda told him), always bringing him something new every visit. Of course, the Malfoy reputation had been severely damaged after the war, but he was slowly rebuilding it. His mother had died two years after the war, so he was the only one left of the Malfoy bloodline considering Lucius was on a life sentence in Azkaban. The Malfoy fortune had been left to him and he was putting it to good use. He donated money to St Mungo's, to Hogwarts, to small businesses who needed something to start them off, orphanages, and basically everything he saw that needed help. He was a changed man.
"Are you sure? I could never do that to you." Draco looked up at Harry with concerned eyes.
"Never have I ever killed an innocent person." Clint said.
"Yes, Harry! It's happening in six months. It could be a trap for all we know. He wants us, Arthur and five others, what if he just wants us there to kill us? What if he thinks we're going to bring five of our strongest and he'll kill us to get us out of the way? What if this is all part of Morgana's plan to take over the world or something?"
"If Merlin's going, I'm going." Gwaine said.
"Yeah, sure."
The blue lady (who Tony later learned was named Nebula) looked at Tony and Pietro sadly. "He did it."
"What are you?"
"Harry, what happened?" Sirius asked Harry once they managed to get away from everyone else and into the kitchen to talk.
"The wolf's child?"
And with that, the Cailleach left with the Dementors and the Veil vanished. The temperature went back to it's normal state.
Draco rolled up his sleeve and showed the Mark again, not paying attention to the other people watching.
"Did she have a name?"
2. Scott didn't get left in the Quantum Realm, he got dusted.
"When should we tell them that we want them to be the godfathers?" Harry asked.
"I went to live with my gran since my mum and dad didn't have any siblings. And Harry couldn't really take me in as a 17 year old."
He was fidgeting with a chain he had around his neck. "Merlin?"
All five of the wizards cast the same spell, "
Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger got married and had their first kid two years ago. They named her Rose Granger-Weasley. They were currently expecting their second child. The Trio had slowly distanced themselves since the war. Ron and Hermione were more focused on their family and Harry on his job as Head Auror. Ron had worked as an Auror but decided to stop once he and Hermione found out they were gonna have a kid.
Tony hesitantly stepped through the trunk and was amazed. There was basically a house.
When nothing showed up, she tried a different name.
Draco led him to a room in the second floor. It was a couple doors down from Sirius' room.
Draco looked shocked, "He did?"
"He's complaining about the security at Hogwarts," Weasley responded.
"Harry!" Sirius gasped dramatically, "There are children here!"
"What's a Basilisk?"
Teddy laughed, his hair slightly turning more of a yellow blonde. "Right. Because they would know you have your patronus and your wedding date tattooed on your chest."
"117. I'm not that old. And you might want to ask your godson that, sir."
He had cake, presents, balloons, everything.
Some new (or old, depending on how you want to look at it) friends. A bit of angst. Love confessions. A bit of fluff. Family reunions.
"Loki, hold Scorp, I need to get to my workshop."� Draco said, passing the four year old to the god then ran to his workshop.
"It's a beautiful name."
During 2013, at one point Harry asked Tony to search them up and see what them in this world were up to. Earth-616's Harry Potter died on May 2, 1998 due to a fire. This Draco Malfoy was in jail and has been in jail since 1998, when he was 18 years old because he had illegal drugs. Edward Lupin died a couple days after he was born. Sirius Black committed suicide in a mental institute that he was in because his family abused him so much that he went crazy.
Teddy, since Harry first fell in a coma, had changed his appearance to resemble Harry and Draco again. This time, he had dark unruly hair with gray eyes and pale skin. For him, looking like people he lost was a sort of coping mechanism. It was odd, but no one questioned it.
"Harry? What do you want with Harry?" Teddy asked.
"So! Now that that's out of the way, wanna tell us why you're here and how you got here?" Tony suggested.
"Alright, let's get this over with before any of us get our souls sucked out of us." Harry said, already conjuring his Patronus with the Elder Wand. Normally he would do it wandlessly, but in an emergency, it was better to use the wand.
"We get it!" Tony said, exasperated, "You're old! Move on."
Right then Thanos snapped back into reality and pulled the gauntlet back and throw Mantis away.
Draco's smile faltered. "A couple weeks... Five?"
"So, Hadrian. Tell us about your family." Arthur suggested.
"Right, of course." Harry mumbled.
"Draco was too strong for you. He shouldn't have ever gone with you. You're the Chosen One!" Then, as if it finally sunk in that Draco didn't do what he was supposed to do. He didn't finish what the Dark Lord started. "No, no, no, no, no! You fool! You tricked my son! No one tricks my son! No one tricks Draco Malfo—"
"Wait. Start from the beginning." Stark said.
"She returns the same way the warlock did. She is after what he stole from her."
"Mordred." Merlin said through the connection.
Comment who you think Harry's gonna find on the other side of the Veil (hint: this person had been mentioned in the story before).
"He has a point there, we can't die. Azkaban would be torture," Draco mumbled.
"Castor?"
"Did I forget to mention that? Oh, yeah, I kinda got all the Hallows my seventh year and now I'm the Master of Death... It's how I can't die."
" Thanos said weakly.
*French translation: "I love you so much. Our baby will be perfectly fine. We have the team now. We have Snape, Sirius and Teddy. Our baby will be the most loved kid ever."
"Potter. May I speak to you in private?"
."� He muttered. "It's the Magic of the Old Religion. Unless one of you can perform Magic of the Old Religion, I can't properly help him until he gets here."
"You had to hit them with a book?" Harry asked while walking up to them.
"But time travel doesn't work like that!"
Teddy's confidence deflated.
"Hey, Scorp."
"YOU KILLED MY SON."
Draco walked over to Merlin and lifted his head up a bit. He poured the potion down his throat and used a spell for him to swallow it.
"And what would that be, child?"
"Really?" Harry put down the shirt he was washing and turned to Draco.
"I'll say it. Okay, so, um, you know how when Harry and I were out on our run from the Ministry, well, I got pregnant. But I lost our baby Carina about 4 months into my pregnancy because of some stupid Aurors. Well, um, I'm pregnant again." Draco said, pulling on the sleeves of his jacket.
When the Potters and Snape apparated back to the Potter house, Snape was shocked.
Over the next months, the Potters, Sirius and the Avengers got to know each other better. Harry found out that he had a natural liking for Steve Rogers, Draco a liking for Bruce Banner, Teddy for Clint Barton and Sirius for Natasha Romanoff. But obviously, Thor and Tony Stark were also amazing.
"We have it. The Malfoy's were considered one of the richest families in all of Wizarding Britain. Our money isn't pounds or dollars like here. There're knuts, sickles and galleons. Knuts are copper coins. Sickles are silver coins and galleons are gold coins. 29 knuts equals one sickle. 17 sickles equals one galleon. Just one galleon equals to around 25 dollars. In my first vault, the one I got when I was eleven, I had around 50,625 galleons, which is $1,265,625. That's only the money my parents left me for school. I also inherited the other family vaults once I was 17, the Black vaults considering Sirius didn't have an heir and he named me as the one to get most of his money, leaving some for Remus. We don't even need to go into specifics about Draco's money, but he had a lot more of it. He got the Malfoy vaults, the other side of the Black vaults and the Lestrange vaults thanks to his Aunt Bellatrix not having any kids."
"Yes, of course I am, Scorpius. You know I'd never leave you." Harry pulled one of the chains he carried around his neck off. It was the one with his engagement and wedding rings. "Here. My wedding rings. You can hold onto these whole I'm gone just so you know I'm always going to be here for you. And when I come back, you can give them back, because after that I'm never going to leave you again. Okay?"
" Lightning was surrounding him and his eyes were glowing. He jumped up and crashed down into the floor, forming a large crater and knocking out more of the creatures.
"Okay, yes, we slept together. Happy?" Severus grumbled. "And if you must know, it was sixth year and we were only a bit tipsy."
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. He hadn't even realized he had been doing that. Hermione also pointed it out in fifth year on the first day of the DA that he did that when he was nervous.
Quill flew over and stood in front of Thanos. "I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?"
Harry burst out laughing, "Roam free? You think we—they're roaming free? They're on the run from the British Ministry of Magic. They can stay in one place at a time for only so long and you think they're roaming free? They spend most of their time working on magic so they don't lose the ability to preform simple spells and you call that roaming free? You absolute idiot, 'Mio—!"
As the robot was powering down, they all heard it's last words, "I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me."
"Well, a sacrifice is needed, based on what Merlin said. But I'm assuming none of us are going to want to sacrifice themselves to a magical Veil." Natasha said.
Harry snuck a look at Merlin, "In a way. Prophecies can really cause a lot of damage if not used correctly."
"Then it will be the noblest ending in history." She responded.
Once Harry was out of Hogwarts' wards, he apparated.
Teddy laughed again before turned back to his platinum hair and green eyes. "It's how I reminded myself of Draco and Harry while they were on their run. I just turned myself into their love child! Of course we have the iconic Malfoy blonde hair and the Evans' green eyes."
"This your finest?"
Neville couldn't believe what he was seeing. This wasn't the same boy that left the Wizarding World. That boy was tired all the time, never really happy with the weight of the world on his shoulders. This man was happy and content with his life. He could tell as he had become very good at reading people when he became a teacher.
He hesitantly knocked on the door, having a feeling he wouldn't open it. "Pietro? It's Scorpius. Can I come in?"
Severus sighed, "Like learning how to wield a sword. Hard at first, gets easier as it goes."
Banner slowly made his way over to him. "I can help, if you'd like."
"Ms Romanoff. Nice to finally meet you." Harry said politely, sticking his hand out.
FRIDAY had told them that Teddy, Pietro, Tony, Peter and an unknown man were on an unidentified alien ship and that there was a man in the compound waiting for them. Harry showed up first in his black dragonhide armor and Elder Wand in his hand at the ready. His fighting stance was quickly dropped as soon as he saw who it was. "Oh my god, Bruce!" Harry instantly went over to hug him.
"It's a beautiful name."
Once again, the newcomers were all shocked by the voice.
"Can you stop working on Barnes' arm so I can fix his mind?"
Scorpius gasped, "But I love you so much!"
"You mean if he's noticed if his dad is gone? Yes, he has. He's very smart for a little two year old. He keeps asking when his Papa is gonna come home. What am I supposed to say? 'No, Scorp, he isn't coming home because some big grape man snapped him, Teddy and Sirius away.'? Severus is doing a better job at raising him than I am."
"That may be why. Normal magic users' eyes don't turn pure gold like yours do. You're the most powerful. The only other person whose eyes turned gold is me. A couple years ago when I was fighting the Mad Titan."
Harry laughed. "We always snuck it into our dorms at Hogwarts during 4th year between the Tasks. Ronald would get the twins to sneak it in and the fourth year Gryffindor boys would be having a party. Fred and George would join in, of course. Thankfully, they cancelled Quidditch that year or Oliver Wood would've kicked my ass into the next day if he were there."
, stop it with Lucy."
Draco finally finished setting up everything for his hospital. The hospital was the 'go to hospital' in New York, which says a lot. Now, he didn't have to go into work everyday, only for meetings and surgeries every once in a while. He'd been working a lot with Bruce which made him less crazy about operating 24/7.
"Yes. I was wondering if you knew anything of the Veil of Death. I remember reading something that the Veil was built on an old castle of the High Priestesses, which is why I came here."
"No. I'm Harry's godson and Draco's cousin. But my dad and Sirius used to date. The family tree is very complicated over on our world."
"Okay. So, how do I track someone?"
All quotes from this chapter come from J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter series.
"What if there were no runes placed. And us there a way to track where someone landed?" She looked ready to ask more questions but Merlin stopped her with a hand.
"What are you going to do
So when they all arrived at the common room, they burst out laughing and Tony forced them to sit with their match while they passed out presents.
He looked around, noticing that everything was clear without his glasses. That hadn't processed in his brain earlier.
Once Draco was behind them, he cast a quick Confundo charm and dragged the men into an alleyway. He cast Disillusionment Charms so no one could see what he was doing. Once the men were there, he knocked them out by hitting their heads with a book.
Harry fought against Keodor Hewion and Hugo Granger-Weasley while Teddy and Draco fought against Hermione and the whole squad of Aurors.
"I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours." Stephen said while activating his Mandalas.
Leon snorted into his cup of water.
"The Death Eaters were Voldemort's minions. The Board is the Hogwarts Board, basically the only people above the Headmaster. Theodore Nott was one of Draco's classmates, both in year and House. His father was a Death Eater, though he never got the Mark himself. Moody is an ex-Auror. Barty Crouch Jr is a Death Eater and a previous Ministers son. He Polyjuiced himself into Moody and he's the reason I was in the Triwizard Tournament my fourth year. Neville Longbottom was one of my classmates, also in year and House. He was always scared of basically every class, especially Potions because of Snape, but Herbology was like the only thing he was confident in. McGonagall was Head of Gryffindor up until after the Battle when she became Headmistress. She was also Deputy Headmistress before the War. The she-weasel, as Draco loves calling her, is Ginerva Weasley, Ron's younger and only sister. She had a crush on me her whole childhood. We dated briefly after the War then I realized I was that the whole relationship was based on ifs. If we're gonna live. If we're gonna win the War. It was forced and we broke up about a year after the war. Which brings us to our next point. Her childhood crushes death. That was me. We faked our deaths to stop the Ministry from looking for us. But that didn't happen! We Polyjuiced some Death Eaters we found during our run from the Ministry and killed them. It may sound harsh, but they technically killed me first, so I mean..."
Turns out, they were going the right way. They found a room being blocked off by chitauri (also inconspicuously killed by Loki). Inside, Thanos was sitting on a throne, looking at what looked like a monitor.
So, when Hugo Granger-Weasley, along with the other Aurors and Hermione Granger arrived, all they saw was a clearing in a forest with no memory of the men that lived there for a week.
Snape rolled his eyes. "Why? Why did you get together with my godson?"
"When they're born. It's going to be a secret." Draco smiled.
The door closed, leaving SHIELD's director, Peggy Carter, to her thoughts, looking at a picture of her lost love, Steve Rogers.
Once the Potters left and Draco and Harry were in bed, Harry spoke up.
"He's the one who suggested it. Now, come on. Let me show you your room. After all, us Potters love picking up strays. Just like we picked up Teddy, then Sirius and now you."
"Okay. Hurry up, though, this thing starts in an hour."
Once the Avengers made their way back to New York, their minds finally processed two things. One, Bruce was somewhere off in space. He had somehow escaped in a QuinJet and left the Earth's atmosphere so now they didn't know where he was. And two, that Pietro was carrying Teddy's body.
"Isn't he the one who killed your headmaster?" Bruce asked.
"It's sword, of course. It belonged to Godric Gryffindor, who is one of Hogwarts' founders. It shows up when a Gryffindor is in need of it the most. For example it showed up for me in second year to kill the Basilisk. Then it showed up in a lake where I almost drowned trying to get it out and Ron pulled me out. Then it showed up for Neville when he was about to kill Nagini for the first time, though he failed that time."

"It's a long story."
A man with shaggy blonde-brown hair, scars on his face and worn out clothes entered. He reminded Harry of Remus Lupin.
"FRIDAY? Where's the heat signature?"
"Why don't you like me?"
"How to bring everyone back using the Hallows."
Natasha also passed, along with Maria, Sam and Sirius. He had said, "I do not need that question answered."
It was around three in the morning when an alarm went off. It woke everyone up.
Slànaich an leòn agus thoir air ais e gu tìr nam beò = heal the wound and bring him back to the land of the living
"I'm assuming you vanquished this Dark Lord?"
Post-Endgame.
Hermione finished writing that down on a spare bit of parchment then looked back up at Merlin. "Thank you, very much, sir."
now. Draco Potter. It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?" Harry smiled mischievously.
"Be quiet, Peter, I need to convince them to name their baby Anthony."
"Maybe, say, next year?"
Less than a minute later, the blood looked like it was somehow seeping back inside of Harry and his eyes shot open, "Please don't shoot me. It's not very nice to shoot people on the same side as you."
"Thank you, Bruce." Draco smiled.
There was a sound of wings and before he realized it, there was a dragon in front of him. Harry let his heart clench once again at the thought of Draco.
"It's called whiskey."
"Okay." Draco and Harry both said without a second thought.
"That's true, pup." Sirius butted in, resting his arm on Teddy's shoulder then having Teddy shove his arm off playfully. Snape rolled his eyes at Sirius but he saw that and then they started were arguing.
"Well, I just wanted to ask if you had heard about the most recent Potter-Malfoy sighting. And by most recent, I mean the one from a year ago."
Hermione finished, finally looking up from the letter.
"What?! Draco Lucius Potter! How long have you known about this?"
"You're sure that's him?"
"Do you wish you could go back to your Wizarding World?"
Chapter 18: Epilogue
"You married him?! I knew you were into blokes, but seriously?! Why not someone like-"
"You were all in on this?" Merlin asked, watching as Harry slowly put his sword away. "Then who won?"
"That's her. That's the Cailleach." Merlin pointed at her.
A ship came down, almost crushing Peter in the process. A blue lady stepped out with knives in her hands and charged at Thanos.
"You can shoot me as many times are you want. It won't do anything. I'll just come right back."
"Let's go."
"More of them? Who's them?"
Pietro reluctantly nodded and walked over to his nightstand drawer. He reached all the way to the back and pulled out a black velvet ring box. He handed it to Scorpius.
She began reading the letter outloud.
Harry travels through the worlds and meets some new friends who help him with his dilemma.
Draco laughed a bit, "Okay, love,"
"I never get over how beautiful that is." Draco whispered.
Steve, Natasha, T'Challa and Harry walked to the edge of the shield (Harry more like apparated there to somewhat scare the two who looked like were the leaders).
"As of today, October 31st, 2053, I can finally announce that Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy are dead. They jumped through the Veil of Death in an attempt to escape the Aurors that had been following them since they had entered the Ministry of Magic in attempt to take it over. In this escape, they also dragged an innocent into it. Edward Remus Lupin, or as some may know him, Headmaster Teddy Lupin is dead." There were several gasps but she kept going, "Potter and Malfoy jumped through the Veil of Death with Lupin and now, we have lost him to what lays beyond the Veil."
Laughing and Clint whining could be heard from the main room.
Tony turned to Peter. He was shocked but he tried to stay strong for Peter. "You're all right."
"They're killing themselves..." Okoye whispered while watching the creatures run into the shield trying to get in and killing themselves in the process.
kill you."
Once Romanoff finished, Agent Barton started talking, "He has scars all over his body. They're old scars that have healed over, meaning they don't come from field work. Possible child abuse, but no one is crazy enough to leave those kind of scars on a child. Distinctive features include a lightning bolt scar on his forehead, and a couple tattoos all over his body."
"Why are you here? And why do you need our help?" Merlin asked.
"I know. I'm sorry."
"Loki!"
"Scorpius Potter." Draco repeated.
Griphook just stared, "You wish to marry two men who are dead to our world?"
Then his eyebrows furrowed. "How do you know all this, Potter? Did you somehow get Draco to find all these replacements?"
to get some water in there. He mixed a few drops of the venom, a couple pieces of the scales and a couple crushed yew leaves. He mixed it using a stirring rod. He kept mixing for two minutes then grabbed a glass bottle and put the potion in there.
"Perfect!" Harry smiled.
Scottish Gaelic translations:
Sirius turned to Harry, "What the hell happened? Why's Moony dead? He was supposed to survive! He was supposed to protect you after I was gone! That was the Marauders rule. Whoever's left takes care of Prongslet, that's you by the way. First it was passed onto Remus after James died. Then me as your godfather. Then back to Moony. Wait, how's the Wizarding World even right now?"
"With Severus and Pietro."
From what they could see, Draco was looking for books about the Old Religion or books about Merlin. When he found an old book supposedly written by Merlin, he stopped. He flipped through the pages. "
"I may not look it, but I am older than you, Severus."
Rogers nodded.
"Severus Snape-Prince. Former Head of Slytherin House. Former Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor and Headmaster. Sadly, also the godfather of Draco."
"6th year was Severus. Slughorn was Potions. 7th year, we don't know. I was hiding with my family and Harry was on the Horcrux Hunt." Draco explained.
"Maybe. Depends on what you tell us." Fury said.
After the night was over, Sirius went over to Tony. "Any news?"
The next couple hours were spent just going through the prophecy. They had most of the first half done but the second half was really getting them good. The part that helped them the most was the "look for the broken one and join all three to make a whole" part. The broken one was the bracelet, join all three was referring to the Hallows and putting them all together.
Nick Fury was a very smart man. So when he became the director of SHIELD, his first order was to look at any unsolved cases. It took a long time to find, but the one that interested him the most was an energy surge in 1970. The director on the case was Peggy Carter. The energy surge had originated in London, England. SHIELD agents were sent to check out the site. All they found was some blood which they tested but found nothing. The blood led to no one, meaning whosever blood it was was probably unregistered. They kept samples of the blood in case anything else every popped up. Nothing did pop up for years to they closed the case, saying it was animal blood.
Snape walked around more. "You did this all yourself?"
When everyone was off the island and once it was blown up (thanks to Harry, Tony and Thor), the carrier made its way away from where the hole of where Sokovia was and resulted flying over Europe.
"Did you get what you needed?"
From the field, Harry watched as Thanos teleported away as soon as he snapped then turned around to look for Draco and Sirius.
"Scorpius?"
"So that's it? He kills your husband and now we're fine with him?" Stark asked, earning an elbow jab from Rogers.
"Yes. I apparently had the Potter vaults, Evans vaults, Gryffindor vaults and the Black vaults. Draco had your vaults, the Malfoy vaults, the Lestrange vaults and the other half of the Black vaults. It was a lot of money."
"He was turning into a Dark Lord. We can't just let them go. Plus with the help of Malfoy, he was turning out to be just like You-Know-Who. We need to have him in a place where we can control them. Control both of them."
"Yes?"
"You have magic?" Gwaine asked.
Feumaidh e dùsgadh air ais = needs to wake back up
"That's Orian again, darling."
"Aw, man." Quill said then dusted.
"Yes, thank you. Arthur?" Guinevere turned to Arthur who was still protectively holding Merlin.
The five of them came up to the dance floor. Harry held onto Draco's hand tightly. Wanda and Natasha were the only other ones who knew what was happening. Everyone else was just waiting to see what would happen.
"Whose room is this?"
"Are you out of your mind?" Barton yelled. "You wanna bring a crazed psycho into your house? The one that kinda killed your husband?"
"Yes?"
"How'd they end up together?" Elyan asked.
"Wrong. My life started over 100 years ago."
Harry turned to look at all the wizards and witches surrounding him. He put his hands up in the air, as if faking surrender.
Unfortunately, in a few months there would most likely be something that broke him.
"Good, or else that would make this ineffective."
Scorpius nodded. "He gave me his rings."
Hermione stayed quiet. That had been a lot to take in. She knew Malfoy looked out for the ones he cared for (now including Harry) but she didn't know that he was forced into the Death Eaters.
"Believe me, I was just as shocked as you are."
"Lord Black." Gaius responded while shaking his hand. "What can I help you with?"
have to
"Where's Scorpius?"
"I'm bored now. Someone ask a question and we all have to answer." Tony said. "I'll start, list of all languages you can speak."
"Quill?" Drax said as the same happened to him.
"Are you more of an idiot than I thought you were, Potter? It's been a week since the War."
"Then who is he going to name his Queen?"
- Nick Murray
"Open it."
"Ew, no."
One, go to the Veil on Titan. Two, carve in the exact date that it is in the Wizarding World, according to George. Three, find George on the other side. Four, sneak out of the Ministry and into Hogwarts. Five, go down into the Chamber of Secrets without any students catching them. Six, harvest basilisk venom and scales and whatever else you can harvest from a basilisk. Seven, sneak out of Hogwarts and back into the Ministry. Eight, carve in the exact date for the Avengers world, this time according to Loki. Nine, get back to Avengers world.
The Avengers tried a bit more. Clint went as a weird looking bird, Tony as a skeleton (he hired a professional makeup artist to do his makeup), Natasha as a detective, Steve as a vampire and Bruce as a magician. They couldn't even explain to Thor what the purpose of dressing up was so he was just wearing his usual Asgardian attire. Tony invited two of his friends, Rhodey and Pepper. Rhodey went as the Joker and Pepped was just wearing her normal business attire, a dress and stilettos.
"Goes on missions with us."
"Clint, drive faster!"� Natasha yelled as she saw how much blood he was losing.
"Warlock? Who's he?"
"I knew I could come back. You were protecting Clint and a little boy. If you died, you may've saved them two, but you would've destroyed your sister. You only have each other. It's not fun losing your only family. Trust me. I lost my parents when I was a month old. I lost my aunt when I was two. My cousin and my godfather when I was 10. My gran when I was 16. I didn't have anyone for 39-ish years."
Which he did.
The gala was actually a charity function of a foundation Stark supports. All the Avengers and the Potters (Sirius included) were dressed nicely and all slowly getting out of their limos. Steve came in a blue suit, white dress shirt and a red tie. Bruce in a plain black and white suit with also a red tie. Clint in a dark purple suit, black dress shirt and a white tie, Thor was in a red suit, white dress shirt and red tie that the Avengers had somehow managed to get him to wear. Tony was wearing a green suit, white dress shirt and black tie. Natasha was in a nice off the shoulder black cocktail dress with some red stilettos. Teddy was wearing a blue suit, white dress shirt and black tie. Draco and Harry wore the same black suit, white dress shirt but with an emerald tie and a blood red tie respectively. Sirius was in a red suit and tie with a black dress shirt.
"Would've been a waste of parts!"
Harry stood up and turned to the giant crowed of the Avengers. "His name is Scorpius Leandro Potter. Scorpius meaning scorpion and Leandro meaning lion."
Merlin frowned. That one normally worked. He’d never tried it on a magical being, but it should’ve worked.
Harry reached out and grabbed it, placing it on his head. He suddenly felt a rush of magic. It felt like he was coming home. But in a way which made everything else fade away. All he could feel was the magic, it's presence taking over everything else. It gave him memories of things that Harry never experienced. Memories of his family, of Severus and Lily as children, of Sirius getting yelled at by his mother while protecting Regulus, of Remus' first transformation, of Voldemort as a child, of the first Wizarding War, of a man named Newt Scamander, of the Salem Witch Trials, of the first game of Quidditch, of the Founders of Howgarts, of King Arthur being killed by Sir Mordred, of the Old Religion.
Everyone went quiet as they watched the couple open the package. Inside was a toy broom. There was a button on the edge which Draco pressed, causing it to start flying up. As it was flying around the room, it was leaving a trail of white sparks. After about 30 seconds of white sparks, blue sparks came out.
After finishing reading about his childhood, she couldn't believe it.
Draco looked a bit skeptical, but just shrugged it off.
"Wow." Merlin gasped.
There was another battle, the heroes seemed to be losing against the Mad Titan, even though they were nine against just one.
Harry hummed and watched as his godson charmed the possible Death Eater. He was a natural spy. It was creepy in a way. But it made Harry proud.
Stephen looked at Tony and hesitated before he spoke up. "One."
Arthur rolled his eyes but didn't say anything else.
Harry smiled, as if he knew Snape would want to see it. He pulled out his wand and whispered the incantation before a wispy dragon appeared before them.
Loki would take him to his location, and then George would help him out from there.
"Draco can help you. Sirius doesn't know much about healing." Severus drawled, earning an elbow from Sirius.
They now had a wing in the Compound (the Camelot Wing), each with their own rooms. Tony had purposefully placed the couples' rooms next to each other. Merlin and Arthur. Gwen and Lancelot. Gwaine and Percival (even if they haven't realized yet).
"So, now he has everything about everyone and everything. You do realize the power that he has now? He has nuclear codes, personal flies, our files! He knows we're not from here!" Sirius said loudly.
"Director Carter," An agent called from the doorway.
"I cast glamours on them. Most of them anyways. I cover up the patronus, the Draco constellation and the Marauders. I keep the Snitch and the Deathly Hallows out. No one knows what they mean, so it doesn't matter."
"Where were the going?"
Harry pulled one of Draco's hands away from his fidgeting and held it.
"My idea. Brilliant, isn't it? The Aurors really should've thought to look for distinct marks like tattoos."
"Since when?"
Around May 24th was the first time Draco felt the baby kick. It was around 1:35 AM and he was woken up by his kicking baby. He shook Harry awake and told him to put his hand on his belly. Harry, having just woken up, was confused at first then he realized what was going on. When he felt the baby kick, he almost started sobbing.
"Jay, found them," Draco said to Harry. They had picked their codenames based on their middle names, or their fathers names. Draco was Lucy, short for Lucius and Harry was Jay, short for James.
"No. Never. I love my family too much. They are my people now."
Griphook sighed, "The only way to do this would be with a marriage contract. The magic will be able to sense that the two are married and will accept them as a couple, bonding them in the process. If the magic doesn't accept them, the contract will be invalid."
"What about Sirius Black? Or Draco Malfoy? Or..." Another man with short brown hair said. He was standing next to the woman, who had her eyes placed solely on Merlin.
They all made their way over to the main common room as quickly as possible, those who knew what the alarm meant were suited up, those who didn't (the Arthurians) were still in their sleepwear.
Steve turned around and saw Bucky fall over and turn to dust.
"Who?"
"Also, before you go do other things, can Sirius, Teddy, Severus, Tony and Steve come up here?" Harry asked while Draco was just beaming.
"Yeah, Harry. I know your true intentions." Teddy smiled white brushing out his hair.
"Yeah. It just reminds me of my old home." He replied, still very breathless.
"He needed comfort and it was after he locked himself in his room for a week or so."
"Not really, Scorpius. He's not himself. He's asleep and he's most likely going to be asleep for a while."
Tony nodded.
"Draco and Sirius dusted... He's been quiet since the battle." Severus explained to those who were gone.
"Too Greek."
Hermione was processing. First, Draco, Harry, Teddy, Sirius and Severus were still alive. Second, Draco Malfoy actually loved Harry. Third, time travel worked weirdly. Fourth, the portrait of Merlin knows basically everything about Merlin's life, if it's passed or not.
"Barnes, did you kill King T'Chaka?" Harry asked.
"Let's just say, being the Master of Death has its occasional perks." Harry smiled.
"A place called Hogwarts."
"They were called Arthurian legends. In the legends, King Arthur names Guinevere the Queen. You kill Morgana using Excalibur. Mordred kills Arthur. Magic becomes unbanned after word gets back to the Queen. You are immortal and are waiting for King Arthur's return. You stay by the Lake of Avalon for years to be prepared for his return."
"Yes. How long was I gone?"
Just like magic, the stairs formed all the way to the top.
"May I see this Deathly Hallow tattoo that you have?" Thor asked. He had a suspicion about it, that it might be something that he was thinking of but he had to be sure.
"No." Harry smiled. "It's a promise."
"Don't even question it."
Teddy turned around, holding a wand to the door to hold the man out while using slight wandless magic to shield them.
"He landed in Camelot, which we all know from the legendary myths of King Arthur and the Knights of Round Table. Well, Harry, he met them. He met the King, Knights and Merlin. Merlin is the one who took him to see a dragon who gave him a prophecy." Natasha continued. She pulled up the prophecy and the notes they had made to figure out what it meant. "This is the prophecy he was given. We made notes to figure out what the hell it was saying, but in the end it was Harry who figured it out. Then the battle happened. Harry made the circlet by combining the three Deathly Hallows. Apparently, the power or magic, or something was too much because he fell to his knees due to him feeling overwhelmed. What he didn't know was that that was what brought all of you back."
"Excuse me? What is a Veil?" Wanda asked.
"Ted, let go. I'll open the wards to him."
"It's a long story. Far longer than the time we have."
"Only you would make me propose after you already did, Draco," He smiled but also got down onto one knee, "Draco Lucius Malfoy, will
"What about your husband?" Stark asked.
After dessert, she pulled out the trunk and opened it. The whole family watched as she took things out and gave them to whoever they were addressed it.
Sirius mumbled something about not liking being called a mutt but came over anyway, "What?"�
"He was too much like Loki, we couldn't risk it." Romanoff said to Barton, putting her gun back in its holster.
"Is that a threat?"
"We were going to bring him back... y'know for you to bring him back... but he disappeared." Pietro said quietly. He looked at Harry, "We finally said we loved each other. And I told him I was going to marry him when we got out of this. He said to tell you that he loves you." Pietro looked at Scorpius then at Severus, "Can I hold him?"
Uisge a chuireas a-mach an lasair = water that puts out the flame
"Papa!" Scorpius screamed, getting up and running to hug him.
Everyone seemed to go quiet.
"Yeah. I'm making a speech. No surprise there. I'm more surprised that McGonagall didn't ask me until like three days ago." Harry chuckled slightly.
"That is not for me to decide, that is for the school board. But, for as I know, head of Gryffindor and herbology teacher, Neville Longbottom, will most likely be taking up the post."
"Who are you?" Sirius asked.
On May 1st, Draco started his second trimester.
The reaction was great. They were all smiling and clapping, being careful of not getting too loud to wake Scorpius up.
They all went their separate ways, getting back to their normal lives, once they landed. The first thing (after seeing Harry placed in the medical wing) that Draco wanted to do was see his son.
"Parker, help! Get over here." Peter swung his way over and worked with Tony to get the gauntlet off. "She can't hold him much longer. Let's go."
"If I tell you will you let me out?" Harry bargained.
Ahh! This has been so much fun to write!
"Okay, so we've kinda been hiding something." Harry started.
"Like Luna!" Draco said, finally getting up off the floor to sit next to Harry.
"It's not that you'll get mad. I'm just scared." Draco whispered.
"How will it learn the Wizarding topics? Will the child have a wand?"
Spells came out of his wand like it was the most natural thing ever. Thanos dodged them easily. They got harder to dodge when he didn't know what was coming. Harry was casting spells from both of his wands and wandlessly. Harry made sure two spells went to his body then one always aimed at his hand to make sure he couldn't snap. As Harry got closer to Thanos, the stronger his spells were getting. He was using all his power to ensure that everyone else would survive.
get pregnant in our world." Sirius finished. "It not common knowledge since gay people were so looked down on. And since those gay people couldn't be accepted in the magical world, they went to the Muggle one where they can't get pregnant since they need two powerful magical beings to get a man pregnant."
"You all might wanna sit down. They already heard somewhat of a story because of a truth charm." The group all sat down in the living room, Harry closest to Draco. The Avengers, minus Thor, all seemed to be on edge still, as if Sirius could attack at any moment. "The year after you 'died', Draco was turned into a Death Eater, Voldemort saying he had to kill Dumbledore or he would kill his family. The end of the year came, and when he was gonna kill him, Snape killed him instead."
"My name is Harry Potter. I am from the future... in a way. I was born on his Earth in Suffolk. But after a tragic event," Harry rolled his eyes, "I had to leave this Earth and I landed in a different one. But now I need help from the Wizarding World but instead of landing in the 2000, I landed here. The other Earth, the one I now consider home, well, the universe, was put in danger by a Mad Titan. Because of him, half the universe is gone. He used these objects called Infinity Stones which are part of what created that universe. He used an object of life for death. And I have these objects," Harry said as he summoned the Elder Wand, Invisibility Cloak and the Resurrection Stone, "These objects of death. The Deathly Hallows. I need to bring everyone back but I don't know how to do that."
Edit: I realized as I was writing chapter 12, that Bruce and Thor are not on Earth as of the end of Age of Ultron. I changed maybe two words that Bruce had asked.
"Can you show me the Mark again?"
"Is he...?" Wanda started but had no clue how to ask what she wanted, so she just drifted off.
Sirius' head shot over to his godson, "How'd you know about that?"
"We're? Who's with you?" Harry asked, throwing a hex at a witch who had tried to stop him.
Harry rolled his eyes. "They're stored here. No one can take the bracelet off, no one can take the Hallows unless I willingly hand them over but they always come back to me in the end." He cast a silent spell and the Invisibility Cloak was in his hands. "This is the Invisibility Cloak, the one that belonged to my father." He put it over his hand and it disappeared. He cast another spell and the Cloak was gone, replaced by the Resurrection Stone. "This is the Resurrection Stone. It's purpose is just like the name, to resurrect someone. But, it's not the best thing. Whoever you use the stone on
As he was leaving, an alarm sounded followed by the voice of Hermione Granger, "
"Do you have proof of that?" Banner asked.
Loki laughed. "I'm Loki. Prince of Asgard, Odinson, the rightful King of Jotunheim, God of Mischief. I have many titles." He stuck his hand out.
Harry rolled his eyes playfully at him then stood up. He tugged up the sleeves of his dress shirt (which was now slightly unbuttoned and not tucked into his pants anymore). He grabbed the hammer and pulled. It moved more than it had for any of the others. Then he gave up.
"I'll give you an answer tomorrow. I have to discuss this with my husband."
"Um, alright. I'm Harry Potter by the way."
Once again, Neville was shocked, "You have a child?"
Draco scoffed, "So, now you're a monarch in their eyes. Just because someone is the Master of Death, doesn't mean they have all the power in the world."
"Good." Draco and Scorpius said at the same time.
"Harry. Go back like before that story. You have a Marauders tattoo?" Sirius asked, completely disregarding the story he just heard. He'd already heard it several times from his family and from James himself.
"Here's an idea. Why don't we stop arguing and figure out what everyone can do and based off of that we figure out a way to take Thanos down?"
Life with the Avengers was different than what Harry was used to. He was used to having to do everything himself. As a child, he did all the chores, all the cooking, everything by himself. Then as a teenager, the responsibilities to do things himself were smaller except the giant responsibility of killing Voldemort that was over his head everyday. Then when on the run, he only had to make sure they didn't get caught. And now, they didn't have to worry about that.
Harry had pondered over that question a lot in the past years, especially when half his family had been dusted. He had hoped that after centuries of living, he would eventually get used to it, the loneliness. He couldn't get too close to people so as to stop people from wondering where he came from or how he looked seventeen when in reality he was an immortal being who had been around since 1980. He would probably just mess with people to get some feeling or emotional response out of it.
Harry's whimpering stopped.
"You kissed him after his mother died? How low are you, Potter?" Snape scowled.
It was still January 5, 2021 on their world.
Chapter 13: Infinity War
Then Natasha came out, Pietro's arm around her shoulders. He wasn't hurt physically, but mentally he couldn't get the sight of his love dying in his arms. Harry went up to Pietro and hugged him. Pietro started sobbing into Harry's shoulder.
"Can we hurry this flight up so I can go see my son?" Harry called from his spot next to Draco, not really knowing who was piloting, if it was Steve, Clint or Natasha.
This is what I based the circlet off of, if anyone was wondering: (right click to open in a new tab)
"FRIDAY, copy down the prophecy onto a board and let's start dissecting it." Tony said.
Draco stood up and pointed his wand at Harry, "What was your first tattoo, where is it and why'd you pick it?"
The both nodded and went outside with Merlin.
"The circle is the Stone, standing for those of lost love. The line is the Wand, for power. And the triangle is the Cloak, the one who greeted Death like an old friend. It just so happens that it all connects back to me.
Unbeknownst to her, in another world, two men felt magic coursing through them. The magic of a marriage bond, and it felt bloody amazing.
The bare conscious one opened his eyes. He looked towards the Avengers and spoke, "Harry Potter... He knows Harry Potter." He said while pointing at Teddy.
"Of course he does." Snape growled under his breath. "How the hell do y—"
"They're the same?" Merlin asked, eyes glistening with amazement.
"How do we do that?" Okoye asked T'Challa.
"Past experience?" Lancelot asked.
"Potter, George. He's Draco Potter. We're great. We have a son! I don’t know if you've read about him. Scorpius Leandro Potter. He'll turn five this year in our world. You would love him."
Then came the landing. Tony and Stephen pulled the controls to try to land the donut but it didn't really work and they crashed anyways. Teddy looked up when he heard Peter say something about someone being aboard the ship. He pulled his wand out and got ready.
"Really? She asked me like two weeks ago. Maybe she knows you have experience writing essays twenty minutes before you have to turn it in." Draco smiled.
"The three brothers are Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus Peverell. The Peverell family spilts two ways. The Potters and the Gaunts. Marvolo Gaunt claimed he had Peverell blood from the female line. He had the Peverell coat of arms, which is the Deathly Hallows symbol. Marvolo Gaunt is also Tom Riddle's, or Voldemort's father. The ring was passed onto Tom which he turned into one of the Horcruxes, the Gaunt Ring. Iolanthe Peverell, granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell, inherited the Invisibility Cloak. She married Hardwin Potter and explained that the Cloak was a secret that was passed onto the eldest child of each new generation of Potters.
"Of course. You somehow made your way here? How?"
"Get him to a ship. His family needs the body to bring him back." Clint said as he ran over to a ship to drop the kid off before looking for anyone else.
Harry smiled and started writing in the journal. A couple seconds later, he got a response.
They spoke for a bit about why Thanos wanted to wipe out half the universe.
The man rolled up his sleeves partially. Harry thought for a second he saw the head of snake that looked suspiciously like the Dark Mark but then disappeared.
"4 weeks. Are you mad at me for not telling you earlier?"
He rolled the Invisibility Cloak into a thin line then shaped it into a triangle. Then he placed the Elder Wand directly in the middle, forming a line from the tip of the triangle to the bottom. Then he placed the Resurrection Stone in the middle. "
Draco smiled a bit. "Alright. I'll come over sometime soon to give those to you."
"Sir Gwaine, Knight of Camelot."
"It's Sev's birthday," Harry shrugged, but then noticed the way Neville froze up, "Shit. Sorry, Nev. He's sorry, by the way. He told me he never meant to hurt anyone, especially you, it was just part of the act. He never thought he would ever see any of you guys again, so he just apologized to me."
"Yes." Hermione said, not standing down.
Harry hummed then looked at him, "Oh, it's one I made. It's used just like I showed you, to display memories without a pensive.
It took everything Draco had to not stop and hex her but he kept walking and made it to the elevator.
Pietro nodded and quickly ran over to the nursery, grabbed the blanket, towel and diaper, then ran back. He handed the stuff to Sirius then looked at the baby. "He is adorable, Harry."
Harry sat between Gwaine and Merlin, smiling softly at Merlin.
"The Wizarding World?" Harry waited until he saw Scorpius' nod before responding, "No. Never. Everyone over there was against everything we did. I would never leave my new family here."
"Yeah! We won't tell!" Harry smiled then hugged Steve.
"Well, I should go. Enjoy your family." Steve said then he went to go talk to Sam and Bucky.
That caused Barton to launch forward, going for a punch which he deflected. Harry slid across the floor and got behind Barton, almost knocking him off his feet with a kick to the knees when he turned and shot an arrow at Harry which he found idiotic. Who brings a bow and arrow to a close range battle? Harry let the arrow hit his shoulder, making the archer stop.
"Hi, Harry." Bruce said as he leaned into the hug of his friend. "Where's Draco? And Sirius?"
He opened the door quietly and leaned against the doorframe. He watched as Scorpius was playing with his toys, back facing the door.
Teddy smiled and turned into a copy of Banner.
"Who are you?" Tony reiterated.
Teddy stood up from his spot on the couch next to Pietro and Clint. "That would be me, Professor—er, Headmaster?"
Gwaine took the glass and swallowed the drink. "That's good."
"Dray," Harry started, "You're a bloody idiot. But you're my idiot. And I can't have you dying on me anytime soon. You're all I have left, and I cannot deal with losing you. So you can't die. No matter what."
"James Buchanan Barnes."
" She cried.
Harry walked into Scorpius' room and sat down in the chair across from his bed. Scorpius was asleep with a toy dragon that Tony had bought him all those years ago. His son was five and a half years old and Harry barely spent any time with him.
A few hours later, the whole thing was finished. Harry pulled out a trunk and put the jars and everything in it.
." The Hallows and the Stones worked together to kill Thanos and his army, Thanos being the last to die.
The three adults went quiet before Severus spoke up, "We don't know, Scorp. We hope sometime soon, but we don't know."
"Now just say the spell,
"Then why were you mad?" Merlin whispered.
"There's nothing going on between us, Teddy," Draco chuckled somewhat nervously.
"� FRIDAY's voice came through, shocking the newcomers.
The actual process of the birth was a simple c-section.  Severus would cut the stomach the cut the uterus that was formed in the process of the conception. Then he would surgically remove the baby. The magic comes in after the baby is out of the stomach. He has to get rid of the uterus then close the stomach using a spell that slowly reduces the size of the stomach back to where it was before the birth. That part was only needed if the carrier was surrounded by Muggles and want it to be less noticeable. The risky part came with the actual magic that allowed the baby to be conceived. Obviously, this baby was a result of magic. Therefore, Draco's magic was keeping the baby alive. Removing the baby requires a great deal of magic on Draco's part and whoever is delivering the baby. Once the child was safely out and fine, someone, most commonly someone really close to the family, uses their magic to essentially heal what part of the magic the carrier lost. That part only takes a small portion of magic on their behalf.
"You git," Draco slapped Harry's hand away but there was nothing but love in his eyes, "I don't know we've survived 20 years without tearing each others throats out."
Natasha sighed, "Harry. I know you miss him. I know you miss all three of them, believe me, I do too. But he's your son. What's Draco gonna say when he comes back and finds out his son barely knows his dad?"
"FRIDAY?" Scorpius called.
"C'mon, you can tell me anything. I won't get mad."
Merlin, for some reason, was in Slytherin. Some years ago, they had found a portrait of Merlin and decided to put him down by the dungeons seeing as he was never a headmaster.
Steve rolled his eyes but nodded nonetheless, "So, Thanos snapped. People got dusted. Harry Potter, who if you don't know him, he was the one who destroyed Thanos' army, the one with the raven hair, green eyes that turned gold and the circlet. He, was the one who figured out how to bring everyone back. He went back to the Wizarding World."
"Well, what'd you learn, child?" Severus groaned.
"Life."
"Dead, so is my mum. They died when I was a month old."
Severus put his book down and stood up. "Where is your friend?"
"He's the Master of Death. He can't die." Draco said, in the middle of sobbing.
"Oh, my Merlin! Draco. Thank Merlin! You're alright!"
"Oh my god." Someone (who sounded like Wanda) whispered from inside the Jet. "They're soulmates."
Next order of business was getting the stone out of Vision without harming him. Princess Shuri started working on it but was confused at to why they didn't just reprogram the synapses to work collectively. Bruce responded awkwardly saying they didn't think of it. Shuri told her brother that it would take time to do all of them when Okoye said something entered the atmosphere and Sam spoke into the comms saying they had a situation outside.
"Leon did." All the Knights said at once.
"Who knew Dementors could bring us together again?" Sirius said, after he finished laughing.
"I was born with it. Magic isn't a thing you can learn. But I learned how to control it at Hogwarts. It's a school for witchcraft and wizardry. It's from ages eleven to seventeen, seven years. But it's an amazing school. Or it would be if I wasn't constantly getting attacked."
It was silent for a bit while the two walked. Right outside Harry's door, Merlin spoke.
"Yes, Master Scorpius?" The lady in the wall said.
It was quiet.
"Okay, okay," Harry put his hand over the scars and started mumbling the spell, "
"Best alcohol in all of the Wizarding World."
Bruce was the one who responded. "Draco? What are you doing here?"
"I will." Guinevere offered.
Him and the squire walked to the Great Hall. He was mesmerized at the reminder of Hogwarts. By how much it was reminding him of the school, he would've thought that either the Camelot castle was Hogwarts or that Hogwarts was so behind regarding modern times that it looked like a castle from the Medieval era.
"I was going to say that Sirius was excellent in charms and transfiguration, so he could help there. As for the wand, we don't know yet. I could give them my Holly wand, if it works for them. Other than that, I think we might have a book on wand making and could possibly make one, but that's way in the future. When they're eleven, they can get their wand, like the rest of us did."
Pietro ran around Thanos to throw him off and Mantis jumped onto him and subdued him.
They were dead! What else could she do?
Along with him, there were two other recruits. Sam Wilson, aka Falcon, who Steve and Natasha met on their run from Barnes and HYDRA. And James Rhodes, or Rhodey. He was War Machine and Tony's best friend. He was a superhero before he joined the Avengers, so joining was just an extra thing.
"Um, Teddy was an amazing person. He was a metamorphous, which I don't know if you know what that means, but he can change his appearance to however he wants it. His parents were Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin, both who were friends of Sirius and Harry's parents."
He turned back to the Knights and Merlin. "Thank you. Maybe we'll see each other again in the future." He smiled before carving the same runes he did on Titan with the exception with the year and the Earth. Earth-616 and year 2020.
"Professor?"
Pietro wiped the tears that had fallen down his cheeks on his sleeve before carrying the limp body of Teddy Lupin to a ship and sinking into a seat he found.
"Oh..." Tony laughed. "Just wait 'til you see what he can do. Wait 'til you see what all the Potters can do, they're all super powerful little wizards, one of them who saved a whole land floating city just with his raw power. And that one saved the little blonde over there, took a shower of bullets for him."
Harry smiled a bit before sitting down. "Great! Now that we all know he has magic, can I please change out of these clothes? I don't know how you survive in these," He gestured at the tunic and trousers he had on.
The Knights all sat up straighter.
Weasley's head snapped up, eyes wide, "Oh, I'm so sorry! I completely forgot that they're your godfather and cousin!"
When Hermione made her way back to her office after stopping by to say hello to Neville, she got to work on the runes.
George seemed confused but went along with it.
"Thank you, Merlin." Hermione smiled gently, before starting to walk away.
They seemed shocked at the sight of Bruce but once they had gotten over the shock they smiled and got back to work.
Then Fury left, leaving Potter to his thoughts.
"Ted, you have to go. They'll think you helped us escape," Draco tried, looking out for any Aurors.
"See, if there's one thing you learn coming from a pureblood family and having three idiots as friends, it's the best alcohol choices." Sirius said, jumping over to the other side of the bar. Sirius may have been dead and supposed to have been 94 in the wizarding world, after what he'd been through, he was still a 39 year old here. Literally. For him, it was only three years ago when he fell through the Veil for the first time.
Griphook pulled out a sheet of parchment and began writing.
The rock man (was he made of rock? Draco didn't know) went quiet after that.
No more was the scrawny, abused, lonely child that first arrived on the train to Hogwarts. Now, there was a man who had lived through too much, but in the end, always survived, though always scarred.
"Who is that?"
"Cute, but no."
"We need dittany," Harry mumbled, already getting up to grab it when Draco tugged on his shirt.
"He fulfilled the prophecy the dragon gave him." Natasha explained.
Harry cursed. Why did that always happen?
Chapter 11: Civil War
"Surprise...?"
Overall, it was a pretty decent day for Harry and confusing for the Avengers.
"Where'd you go?"
"Yes! What other Ted's do you know?" Draco let out an exasperated sigh.
"Excuse me. I need to visit a vault." George said to the open Goblin.
But now with his family, he didn't have much of a choice.
Scorpius laughed. He stayed in his dad's lap and held onto him as if he would go away again. "Daddy. Please don't go again."
"It's dry blood. The wound patched up in a second. The only perk of being Master of Death." Harry explained.
Contrary to popular belief, Hermione knew that the Veil of Death was actually a portal between worlds. The hardest part was finding out where someone landed or how to get to a specific world. Or, at least that's what Hermione thought, not having knowing Harry had already figured it out in the other world.
"They were both arrested for something they didn't do. Plus, Harry is my godfather and Draco is my cousin." Teddy said before walking off, motioning the rest to join him.
Hugo Granger-Weasley.
"Right." Morgana was still a sore subject for both Merlin and Arthur. Merlin because he had poisoned her in order to save Camelot and Arthur because he couldn't do anything to help her.
Sirius choked on his lemonade. He quickly turned red, as did Severus.
"Well, maybe if you weren't working with Voldemort your whole life you would know more healing spells!"
"We can assume they're heading to where the ship was headed, and knowing Thanos' children, it's probably Titan, Thanos' home planet. It wouldn't be best to send anyone else there, just prepare for battle here."
Harry smiled a bit before willing the invisibility cloak to come out of the circlet-bracelet. Once he had it, he wrapped it around his shoulders, "Let's go."
"What?"
Civil War. Draco and Harry Fluff. Severus helping Bucky. An announcement. Dinner. Teddy and Peter interaction. Hope.
Draco rushed over and hugged Harry while sobbing.
"What happened to your little student run club thing?"
"Good job, you mutt. You can do simple math. Would you like a gold star?" Snape mumbled.
"Why?" Pietro asked softly, his eyes watering a bit.
"Okay. Now can you please calm down?" Tony said.
The first time he realized it was broken was right after the snap. It didn't break anymore up until the moment he started caring about his life again. After that, it didn't move until he got to Camelot. He noticed it while he was using magic on himself to change his clothes. But now, he just wanted to know. Did Death want him as its master still? Was he terrible at everything? Or was it just because of the imbalance between life and death?
Quill spoke quietly but he was crying, "No, you didn't… ! No, you didn't… !" He started to hit Thanos which caused Mantis to lose her hold on Thanos. "
"What are you doing by the Lake of Avalon?" Merlin asked.
"What are you talking about?"
When Harry first heard his sons cry, he thought his world stopped. He never thought they would have another baby after Carina, but he was so happy now. Harry cut the umbilical cord and wrapped his son in a baby blue blanket. He was cleaning him up while Severus was still working on Draco. Draco had been anesthetized from the neck down so Harry brought their son to him.
It turned out to be a group of criminals? A human, a rock dude and a bug chick.
Bruce's eyes widened.
"Yes?" The director turned to the Agent.
It felt weird. After being in a coma for a while, you wake up and suddenly realize everything changed, but at the same time, nothing changed.
Bruce looked at Draco in confusion as he saw the baby.
"I would be King, if my adopted father hadn't demolished my kind." Loki said, glaring at Thor from the corner of his eye.
"I told her about Carina."
"I'd like to see you try." Tony smirked.
"Any other children I need to know about?"
Bucky took the potion and drank it.
George turned around and smiled at Hermione.
Harry turned to the Avengers and crossed his arms over his chest.
"Of course, my love." Harry said, leaning for a kiss.
FRIDAY started to play some footage from before the snap on the wall across from the room.
He looked up at everyone else who was watching him. "Anything else?" When no one answered, he put the quill down.
Draco smiled and sat next to Harry. When they pulled away from the hug, Scorpius took the chain off his neck and gave it back to his dad. "You came back."
"Well, maybe it was a bit more than that." Merlin said, "Can I test something?"
Nick Fury let the agents go work on their other cases and started searching through the databases. He searched through old files (even the paper ones that still hadn't been transferred to the online version), all the databases he had access to and all the archives. Then the idea hit him like a truck when he remembered the blood found 10 years before it should've even existed.
Hermione looked taken aback, "Uh, sure. Send me an owl, I suppose." She said before walking away.
"To the other place."
Teddy watched as a green lady, presumably Gamora, was fighting Thanos while he dragged her over to a cliff. He watched as the Titan threw Gamora over the edge and heard her scream, "
Teddy let out a small laugh, "Yes, Draco. I think we all know that by now."
Weasley stared at him for a bit before looking back down at the papers he had on his desk.
Everyone nodded.
"Morgana and Mordred are here." Merlin blurted out.
"A friend." Merlin said.
"Damn right you will. I'm not letting you or your adorable arse go anywhere." Harry smirked, lowering one hand to rest on Draco's arse.
Scottish Gaelic translations:
Draco smiled and leaned into Harry, wrapping his arms around his waist. Harry pulled Draco closer and held him close, watching the magical dragons play around next to them.
Loki laughed a bit before wincing from the pain. "I see you found the Avengers just fine."
"Hi, Teddy. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. Just hold on and we'll get you back to Harry and Draco and they can heal you. Okay? Just hold on for me." Pietro said, picking him up and running away from all the chaos. He thought he heard Strange telling Thanos to spare Tony's life in exchange for the stone.
They had shots lined up for everyone. Once they had drunk 7 shots, they were out.
Draco gasped. "He's already four?"
"How come Fury never noticed it?" Barton asked, both to Harry and to Romanoff.
"Sleeping." Leon said. "He was tired so I put him to sleep in his room."
When he was done he looked at Arthur and smiled. "I don't believe we've been properly introduced. Draco Potter." He stuck his hand out.
"I don't have one. I was recently informed that Harry Potter left me a vault? My name is George Weasley."
"And you being sentenced to Azkaban?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony and Pepper moved into their own little home with their daughter Morgan Stark. Rhodey, Steve and Natasha still lived in the Compound. Natasha was basically running the Avengers now since no one else wanted to. She was doing an excellent job at it too.
"Seems like we both have messed up families."
"Draco?"
The only one who was treating him the same was Scorpius and he was a child.
"I have something to tell you."
Draco just laughed from his place in Harry's arms.
"You? A child?"
Draco spoke up. "She's dead. Died two years after the war."
When Scorpius was fourteen months old, he said his first word. The Avengers were out on a mission in Chile after hearing reports that there was a HYDRA base there. Severus was in the nursery in the Compound with Scorpius just like he always in when they're on missions. Severus had been telling the baby about what Draco was like as a child when Scorpius said "papa". It didn't process in Severus' mind at first, but after a few seconds, he told FRIDAY to call Draco. He stood up and held Scorp in his arms while watching the video chat showed up on a hologram. It looked like the mission was over and they were on their way back.
Merlin walked into the common room where all the Avengers were (plus Maria Hill and Nick Fury, for some reason). Even the ones who were normally in space were there. They were called by Tony but no one knew what it was about besides Merlin, Gwaine, Draco and Peter.
"Well..." Draco trailed off, "That's the shortened version, the nicer version I would say."
His eyes went gold, but nothing happened. There was no change.
"How are we going to close the Veil?" Teddy asked.
Before Harry could stop himself, he found himself spilling his whole life story to the group of people. "Yes. Me and my husband were caught in a bad place at the anniversary of the war and were forced to go into hiding. Before you ask, yes, we were in a war, I was the supposed hero of the war, having died. But the
"Yes. In a way. Prophecies. You never get enough of them, am I right, Merlin?"
"Merlin can take you. He's the physicians assistant." Arthur said.
"Oh, bravo, Hermione! Truly the smartest witch of her generation." Harry applauded, faking being impressed.
"We have blood to spare." Proxima Midnight lifted her sword which turned out to be a signal for some weird animal creature things to get off the ships and start running into the shield.
"What do you want us to do?" Draco asked. He didn't like where this was going. Mordred reminded him of a mix between Harry and himself. Not having a choice, being raised in a bad way, not knowing what was happening.
"I am Groot..." Groot said before he also turned to dust in front of Rocket.
When Neville didn’t see anyone come through, he knew it was Harry. "Harry?" He tried again.
"I'll come back and report in a bit."
"And what did he say again?"
Teddy was the first to start clapping, followed by Draco, Hermione, Ron, George, Neville, Luna and everyone else. Harry got off stage. He smiled at everyone who looked at him and made his way back to his seat.
"This is actual bullshit, people do realize that, right?" Draco scoffed as he threw an old copy Daily Prophet down onto the floor of the forest they were currently camping out in.
Arthur shook his hand, "Arthur Pendragon. King of Camelot. What do you mean by 'rightful King'?"
"I could say the same about you, Snivellus." He growled.
When Draco was called up to make his speech, everyone went quiet. He looked out at everyone sitting at the tables. He briefly made eye contact with Harry, who gave him an encouraging smile, and Teddy before he spoke up.
Merlin just death glared them before blurting out, "I have magic! I'm a sorcerer!"
"Well, I think this calls for a celebration! Dinner tonight. Meet here in fancy attire and we'll go to dinner. Tell Ted, Sirius and Severus, too." Tony said.
"Daddy said that to bring you back he had to go away. Is he here?"
"Never have I ever watched someone die." Pepper said.
In 2014, many things happened. Steve found out that his best friend (and crush, not that he'd admit it), Bucky Barnes, was alive and working for HYDRA, a secret Russian organization whose one of many goals is to to destroy SHIELD. Which they partially succeeded in. Barnes now had a metal arm and had no clue who Steve was. It was sad for Steve. Harry tried to help him through it, but he couldn't truly understand since he'd never been through it himself. All the SHIELD files were leaked into the public. Harry was out of a job until he finally accepted Nick Fury's offer for joining the Avengers.
Merlin stayed silent. "You feel them all the time?"
Everyone was gathered in the common room. They were spread out around the place, some on the couches, some on the floor, on the armchairs of the couches, everywhere. Merlin and Harry stood in front of the giant flatscreen television.
"Scorpius Leandro Potter. He's adorable. He has the same love for books that Draco did as a child. He loves hearing about them. About Draco and Sirius and Teddy. He knows they're gonna come back. He loves magic and the idea of it. He says he wants to teach magic when he's older. His favorite animal is a snake, which isn't surprising, seeing as we decorated his room with the four animals of Hogwarts. Severus, one of his godfathers, keeps telling him stories about when Draco was a kid, seeing as he's also Draco's godfather."
Outside, the Patrnous' had destroyed a large part of the Dementors, but there were still so many.
"Severus, we both know that the Potters are one of the richest wizarding families. And he inherited the Black money from Sirius. Plus what he made as Head Auror."
Sirius thought for a bit, "Yeah. He had on a gold helmet too. It had like horns on it."
"Yes, my husband."
Harry was curled up into a ball. He heard banging on the door and some unintelligible yelling.
Sirius got up next and joined the hug. Even Severus, though reluctantly, joined the hug. Draco started crying a bit. Once everyone pulled away, Draco wiped his tears and stood up straight. "I'm about 9 weeks pregnant right now. We're telling the Avengers soon, I think in a week or two. But," Draco pulled a couple photos from his pockets and gave them to the other three, "It's the first ultrasound Harry did. They seem healthy and it's little heart is beating normally. It's still to small to tell the gender but I want a baby boy, Harry wants a girl."
"2052. Granger was Minister. One of her and the Weasel's kids was an Auror. The she-weasel married a man but got divorced three months later, everyone claimed her to be 'devastated after the death of the childhood love'. Personally, I think she was just a gold digger." Draco snickered. "The Malfoy reputation was never fully restored after the War, though me and my mother tried. I'm pretty sure McGonagall is immortal. She was still around by the time we left. Just not as Headmistress. She retired, Teddy was Headmaster and now I don't know who is. Maybe Longbottom. He was Head of Gryffindor and Herbology professor. The Weasley twin left runs the joke shop. The one they both set up during our fifth year. He named his son after his twin. And my favorite part. Theodore Nott was Head of Slytherin! He taught Potions. No one liked him. The professors dealt with him but the students... he's just as bad as Moody slash Barty Crouch Jr."
"Yeah. You can put it on the Hallows bracelet, it never comes off and it can't be destroyed. Okay?"
"He… he…
Getting into Azkaban was easier then expected. Really, the Aurors needed to do a better job. Or maybe he just said that because he knew how they worked.
"No, sir. Actually, those were all Harry. Occasionally a bit of help from Draco. But they were mostly found by Harry. In the first ten years we were here it's all Harry did. Draco would be reading and Harry would be studying the physical and chemical aspects of some of the most common Potion ingredients and tried finding replacements for them." Teddy said.
"Because I grew up with Severus as a godfather," Draco pressed a quick kiss to Harry's lips before standing back up, "Now finish your potion before it explodes in your face and I have to clean you up again."
The battle, as hard as it was to fight, only lasted ten minutes.
He heard battle cries and one comforting voice telling him it was going to be okay. He recognized that voice as Pietro. Once again, his hair was shifting between blue and his natural brown. He then remembered that he had never told Pietro how he felt.
By the time he got off the stage, he received many pats on the backs, nods of approvals and the sort. He went back to his seat in between Teddy and Harry. He had been really surprised when he had been invited by Hermione Granger to sit with them but had suspected it only had to do with the fact that he was Teddy's guardian for the night.
"You made a spell?"
Harry laughed a bit and showed the stag, mutt and wolf on his hipbone.
When the door opened, Draco and Scorpius were standing there. Scorpius ran over jumped onto the bed.
"It's actually worse, but fine. Go ahead, call me whatever you want," He sighed.
"Tea, Potter? Really? Are you really that British?" Tony sighed.
"Well, I meant to land back in my timeline, instead, I landed here. But, where better to ask for help to where magic started? Or, not where it started, but when the most powerful magic user was alive. Merlin!"
Tony was ready to fire when Draco gasped. He turned to Draco and saw his wide eyes and watering eyes. He turned to Sirius who had his jaw on the floor but with a scowl on his face.
The one thing he wasn't expecting was a present from Harry.
"Oh, that was nice of you."
"If you wouldn't mind, that would be lovely."
At this point, Harry found no point in hiding about his past. If he did, he would probably be confined to a cell for the rest of his life. But since these were the people he was most likely going to work with from now on, he thought it would just be easier to tell them.
"Okay, someone wanna fill me in?!" Tony yelled.
"They were Death Eaters who were sent down the Veil to be killed. I only finished the job, seeing as the Veil didn't. Don't worry, I didn't use the Killing curse on any of them."
Clint started piloting the ship and quickly made his way into the air. He was trying to make the flight faster than the original trip to get Merlin to Draco.
"You should have seen Harry when Draco had been... killed. He was so madly in love with his husband, he didn't know how to function without him. For two years, he had to rework his life because some idiot screwed everything up. Draco was dead, for lack of a better word, and Harry still spoke so highly of him, you would think he worshiped him." Merlin said, voice getting more serious and threatening as he spoke, "You may have turned your back against Harry all those years ago, but Draco never did. He stood by him. Through heaven and hell. They lost a child because of an order your predecesor put out. Aurors killed their daughter. Draco was so torn up about it, he shut down. Losing a loved one is one thing, losing a child before even having met them, is the end of the world."
"I became Head Auror. And don't say James would be proud of you. I was sentenced to Azkaban with three murder charges. Two of which were idiotic."
"Show me. Let's see Snuffles, then."
"We need help! He was stabbed!" A dark skinned man while short dark hair said.
"What does Thanos want with these stones?" Natasha asked.
"Where's Gamora?!" She demanded.
Snape laughed.
Chapter 17: post-Endgame (and possibly the tie between this story and the sequel)
"Giant snake."
"Gamora." The blue lady said.
Hermione nodded, "Yes, let's do that."
Merlin was back in the kitchen cooking, helping Draco and Severus with their potions, throwing pillows at Arthur, talking with Lancelot, making Gwaine (and now Tony and Sirius) drinks and hangover potions. The norm for Merlin.
Harry closed his eyes and focused on the magic around him. He could tell Pietro and Teddy were together in their room (since when did they share a room?). Tony, Pepper, Morgan, Wanda, Clint, Peter and Bruce were in the main common room. Rhodey, Sam, Bucky, Steve, Natasha and Carol were in the kitchen. The Guardians, Valkyrie, Thor, Loki, Scott and Hope were in one of the smaller common rooms just talking. Sirius, Severus and the Arthurians were in the Camelot Wing. That meant...
"But Gwen and Lancelot are getting married. Arthur is even happy for them."
"Make what ineffective?" Harry asked, watching as Draco reached into his pocket and got down on one knee, "Draco..."
Around ten minutes later, Severus opened the door and walked out. Harry stood up with his sleeping baby and everyone else looked up. Draco was wheeled out of the room in a wheelchair (and based on Draco's face, he didn't want to use the wheelchair) that was being pushed by Teddy. Harry walked over to him and kneeled next to him. He handed Draco the baby and watched as he held him.
"Hey, buddy." Harry said, kneeling down and holding his son. "I need to talk to you for a bit."
"Ted? As in my godson?"
do me the honor of being my husband?
"Gwen." Scorpius said, getting used to her name.
"It'll be in spring. It's my favorite season."
The two worked together to pick up their stuff, putting all into their trunks and then shrinking those to fit in their pockets. By the time they left, the small clearing they were in, was as it was before they left. They didn't even leave a single reminder that they were there before.
Harry looked around, "There. Next to... Bruce Banner in the black suit."
"No, no, no, no." Arthur laughed, "I don't care if he has magic. I've already known he's had magic."
"Well, you know us. Always doing pulling off the unexpected surprises." Harry laughed, Steve joining in, "So yes?"
"We have some books we brought from our world. It's not much but it's a start." Draco suggested.
"Are there going to be attempts to see where Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy and Teddy Lupin ended up?"
"Here's the thing. I am from here, but from 2053. I was a criminal for crimes I didn't commit. After that year, Draco, my husband, Teddy, my godson, and I hopped through the Veil, a portal between lands. We landed in 1970 in London. Then blah blah blah, saved the world a bit, had a son, the usual. Then out of nowhere this giant purple man uses these things called the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the universe, including Draco, Sirius, Teddy, and a bunch of my friends. After a couple years, I decide to undo what he did. So now I'm here."
The first one was Draco's reaction to the nursery Tony had made him. Then it was the baby shower. Then when Harry and Draco asked Teddy, Sirius, Severus, Tony and Steve to be his godfathers. When Scorpius was born. His first birthday. One that really caught his eye was when they were deciding on the names.
"Hello, Draco. Your son just decided to say his first word."
." He whispered, his hand on Harry's chest.
"I know right. After all these years I'm still amazed by what magic can do."
"Yes it is." Draco went over to Harry's room, entered, picked his son up then came back out. "Scorpius, these are some of Daddy's friends."
Draco sighed, running a hand through his long hair, "Fine. Fine. Come with us. But no way in hell am I letting you make a Horcrux."
Draco smiled, grabbing a glass, setting it on the table and grabbed some whiskey and poured it in the glass, "Enjoy, Sir Knight."
"Witch?"
"I have a last name." Arthur said.
"I love you too, Teddy. And so do your parents, remember that. Tell your Gran to tell you more stories. Or Hermione, Ron or even McGonagall once you go to Hogwarts. I love you so, so, so much." Harry placed a kiss on his forehead before switching places with Draco.
Or where Harry should've been.
On Merlin's first day in Camelot, he witnessed a man get murdered because there were signs of him being a sorcerer.
"I suppose."
Once they arrived at the Lake of Avalon, Harry hopped off his broom and shoved it back into his trunk. He stood at the edge of the lake and just stared at it for a bit.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled a shrunken trunk from his pockets. He put it on the round and resized it. Then he opened it and looked at Tony.
Fury pulled out the small version of Potter's file and placed it on top of the case file he was working on.
"Date of birth?"
Arthur nodded and slowly put Merlin on the ground so Severus could help him.
"A sword. It was forged in dragons breath." Arthur said.
"Great! We need to catch you guys up on what happened while you were who knows where." Tony started. "Well, I'm assuming we all remember the fight against Thanos, so Steve you start since I got everyone here."
"Yes, but it says Teddy's Hogwarts Headmaster."
"Kumkani?!" She said in a shocked manner as she watched her king turn to dust.
"Who's going to watch Scorpius?" Severus asked. Normally, he would be the one to stay behind to watch the kid, but seeing as they were Dementors, he had to go.
"I found out I was the Master of Death. Which is how I can't die. I became this, the night of the Battle. To become the Master of Death, you had to collect all three Deathly Hallows, which are my worlds most powerful objects. Which I did. The Invisibility Cloak which I got from Dumbledore as it belonged to my father. The Elder Wand, which I got from disarming Draco who disarmed Dumbledore who had the wand. I became it's owner and master, you could say. And the Resurrection Stone that I got before I died. So I can't die. I can't age, which is why I'm stuck looking like a 17 year old.
"How are you so bloody good with potions?" Harry pouted, crossing his arms over his chest.
On the other side of the Compound, Pietro got on one knee and pulled out the ring, "Will you marry me?"
Harry sat and thought for a moment before he answered, "We obviously wouldn't have had this amazing family. In all honesty, life wouldn't have been the same. Without chasing wild villains and trying to get Tony, Sirius and Gwaine to stop drinking, it would just be boring. I think we both would've gotten bored of each other eventually and just give up. You, in a spur of the moment decision, would destroy your Horcrux and let yourself age so you could see your mother again. I… most likely would've left England. At least for a while. Get a new identity, after all, the Savior died during the ten year anniversary. Probably give myself the weirdest name like… Harper Torty and no one would suspect a thing. Maybe I would come back to England after a century or two. Hopefully when things are different. But, it's the Wizarding World for a reason, we live ancient times."
Loki let go of Harry after the teleportation was over. They were on the remains Titan, where the Veil was located.
In the seventh month, Draco could feel his baby moving a lot. Another thing about his pregnancy was that he was always tired now. Sure, he was tired earlier, but now he was wanting to sleep every second of the day. It was supposedly normal for pregnancies, but Draco wasn't so sure considering he was a man and the thing that let him have a baby was magic. Severus went into their library a lot to see if he could find anything about male pregnancies. So far the most he had found was about delivering the baby, what spell to use, how to set up, etc. Harry was a worried wreck at that point. Tony had brought up the fact that their baby could be born prematurely, which caused Harry to worry even more even after the fact that Tony added quickly that after seven months, the baby would be fine if born prematurely.
