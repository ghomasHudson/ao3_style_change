Harry’s eyes flew open, unsure if the dream had actually ended, since he was still enthralled in darkness. But it was the darkness of his own bedroom—he recognized the feel of his own bedsheets under sweaty palms, and the scent of the room was familiar, though it still felt tinged with the fragrance of roses, of something almost citrusy.
Draco took Harry’s chin in one hand, tilting his face up for another kiss, so consuming that Harry nearly dropped the floo powder in his hand, but Draco ended it much too quickly.
Harry quirked his lips, looking up into Draco’s bewildered face and nodding. “That’s how we found you,” he said quietly. “Timsy used my wand to get traces of your magic from my head, and he followed it with his elf magic. He found me that way, broke into Ron’s with your mother and Pansy, but he said your magic was… ‘quiet, delicate,’ not ‘loud’ like mine, or something.”
“But you’ve caught plenty of snitches in your day,” Draco remarked. “I know that was the first, and probably the only one you’ve ever swallowed,” he smirked, “but why do you think that particular one was so formative to you?”
Dudley swung open the door before they were even fully off the bike, and Draco froze, his jaw dropping open. Harry’s cousin sauntered over happily, greeting them in his booming voice.
And then Harry’s lips were on his, so much softer than Draco had ever imagined they’d be, and he gasped and tried not to cry out softly with the twisting, stabbing pain that exploded in his core, but he couldn’t help it, just as he couldn’t help tightening his arms around Harry’s waist and kissing him back like it was the most important thing he would ever do.
“You’ll never guess who came in this morning,” Ron declared, with a face that suggested he wanted Harry to guess anyway.
That effectively snapped Draco out of his daze, and he blinked, trying not to drop Harry’s hand too quickly. He could feel a traitorous blush on his cheeks, spreading down his neck.
Harry didn’t know why it had to be such a secret, but he’d signed the contract anyway, and was therefore magically forbidden to speak of anything he did for the Department of Mysteries.
“Wand, please,” the young, sleepy looking wizard at the desk held out his hand mechanically as Draco approached, not even looking up. Draco handed over his wand with only minute hesitation.
what your work entails, how could you let yourself into that position with him? But of course you did, you fucking
“Close your mouth,” Ron muttered under his breath. Harry’s jaw clicked shut. He swallowed nervously.
And that was terrifying. Trusting Draco Malfoy was terrifying. But Harry had been so curious about him all these years, had made sure the Minister was there to back him up. He’d wanted to see what Malfoy could do, uninhibited by his father or Voldemort or the Ministry. He’d wanted him to be successful, now that he was free to create his own life, and this was Harry’s chance to see who Malfoy had become, the man he’d grown into.
The air around him felt charged, and it smelled different, like something outside. He felt Draco sway slightly, and Harry’s shoulders were tensing with the effort of moving his magic like this. Yes, Draco might pass out, but he’d be fine, Harry was
“Rose, this is Draco Malfoy,” Hermione said, petting the girl’s head. “He’s, erm… an old schoolmate of ours. He’s a friend.”
The children were simply laughing, playing. Teddy was dashing through the air on his new toy broom, much stronger than the last one,
He stayed there with his hand on the doorknob until he felt the wobble of the wards, then released a long breath, the work of the day finally catching up with him. He felt drained, emotionally, physically, magically.
“Why’ve you come to fetch me?” Malfoy asked, changing the subject. “Have the house elves joined the portraits’ crusade against Gryffindors and barred you both access?”
Harry paused, pushing himself up to see Draco properly under the warm glow of his floating lights. His face was flushed and open, vulnerable and aroused. His bright hair fanned around his head, tangling in tufts of sea thrifts. His full lips were shiny and pink from kissing, and Harry could already see the start of small bruises on his neck from Harry’s mouth.
“This room, my study, is a sanctuary. There is no judgement, or hatred, or violence in here. Nothing that happens in here leaves this room, not even for your friends, without both of our consent. My wards here are stronger than the centuries-old blood wards at the Manor. My floo is normally locked to everyone except my mother, Pansy, and the Minister, but while you are here, it is locked and warded completely. While you are here, this space is only for you, me, and sometimes Timsy—who is the most loyal being I’ve ever known, and I consider him family.” Draco put his arms on the armrests, forcing himself out of his defensive posture. “You are safe, here.”
Harry brought the tip of his wand to his temple, and pulled out a memory of wandering the Manor, one long and interesting enough to give him at least two minutes. He dropped it into the mouth of the vial, surprised that his hand didn’t shake.
He ran his thumb over the blooming roses, watching Draco smile and laugh, over and over, with a happiness Narcissa had provided.
Draco’s lips were an incredible shade of dark pink, his sharp, pale face flushed. His jumper was disheveled from Harry’s wandering hands, and his brilliant smile reached his eyes, the grey of his irises nearly glowing against his face—like drops of morning dew on new, spring grass, refracting the light around them. Harry was utterly mesmerized, torn between the desire to stand there and continue staring at him like an idiot, and the urge to close the distance between them and kiss him again.
“You keep saying that,” he said. “You can’t find her when you’re stuck here with me. You haven’t wondered if that’s intentional?”
“Most assuredly,” Narcissa replied, her smirk widening into a full smile as she took his arm. “I’m sorry to have surprised you like that, I must have lost track of time.”
“I’m er…” how could he phrase this without sounding like a nutter? “I’m returning to my body, per se,” he tried. “The lines can blur, sometimes, of where I end and the other person begins, and it’s very important to maintain those boundaries as much as possible. I do that every time I leave someone’s head, I take inventory of the things I know about my own body, and reaffirm those boundaries.” Harry listened intently, eyes moving around Draco’s body where it was seated in the chair, taking an inventory of his own.
an Unspeakable who doesn’t ask questions, then I can only imagine that they prefer it that way—perhaps the Department of Mysteries required an Unspeakable whose sole job it was to acquire knowledge, as usual, but without any of that pesky curiosity.”
Ron glared at each person in the room until they either nodded or looked away. He turned back to the board.
“Enough, Smith. Tell us how to help you remove the bonds from Healer Malfoy’s license, or pack your desk and don’t come back,” Kingsley said seriously, and Harry was a little bit relieved to hear him using the full reach of his authority, for once. Smith scoffed at him.
When he looked up, Malfoy’s face was unreadable, frowning slightly as he pushed himself off the door frame.
“Hi, Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, shaking herself out of the moment and smiling at her friend, who was glaring suspiciously at her. “Don’t look at me like that—we just had a little disagreement, Draco here was quite determined to protect your privilege as his patient—we tried to tell him you tell us everything anyway, but here we are. So, does Draco have consent to discuss your condition and your healing with us, now?”
Later that night, after a relaxing evening spent with Timsy and an obligatory letter to his mother, Draco fell into a deep and contented sleep, cradled by his luxurious bed. He dreamed of tiny footprints walking on parchment, the light of a wand keeping careful vigilance.
Harry swallowed hard. The words echoed around his head, disruptive and riotous. Draco stared at him a moment more, then shrugged.
He rooted around in his extended pocket, Timsy always made sure he had extra floo powder when he went out—
“It smells like that, too, like a thunderstorm on summer grass, like ozone in the air, and erm…” he huffed an embarrassed laugh, eyes closed. “Like treacle, if I’m honest—syrupy and sweet. It’s warm, and thick, like…” He paused and bit his lip, choosing not to disclose how comforting it could be, how it felt like curling in front of the fire at home after a long day, or putting on his fuzzy green slippers. He moved on, opening his eyes and looking closely at the edges of Harry’s body, his hands.
“You’re a menace,” Harry declared, sitting up and grabbing for Draco, who darted away. Still laughing, Harry’s eyes scrunched up so much they were nearly closed. “Come here, let me hold you.”
Harry continued staring silently at Draco, petrified, while Draco continued checking him over as a Healer, pulling out his wand and casting multiple diagnostic charms, which of course showed Harry to be in perfect health, but with a very elevated heart rate. A lock of his sleek hair fell into his face as he worked, and Harry fixated on it, to avoid staring at anything else.
Last chapter, I hope you loved it. This is the longest thing I've ever written - probably longer than everything I've ever written, combined, tbh.
Harry was shaking his head firmly, that incredulous grin still on his face, as if Draco had just told him to put on lederhosen and perform a Schuhplattler. Draco narrowed his eyes at him.
with his own voice this time, but how could he not, when Draco was clearly the eloquent one? Harry caught a glimpse of those perfect lips turning up in a lopsided grin, before Draco tilted his head down and closed the distance between them,
“I’ll be surprised if Kingsley doesn’t personally supervise every Ministry employee with an iron fist, after
“I hate doing this,” he admitted. It was somehow easier to admit it to Potter. “But it’s an integral part of my work. You’re undoubtedly going to feel extremely vulnerable. I’m going to enter your mind, four times a week, and I have to see everything, Potter. I don’t know if you ever learned Occlumency after Severus tried to teach you—” Potter snorted at this, “—but you can’t hide anything from me, while I’m in your head. I’ll see embarrassing things, personal things, grief and joy and pain and all the rest. Someone forced you to hide your own voice away inside your mind, which means we’ll have to look for it, and leave no stone unturned.”
Before he knew it, his two hours were up. He got to his feet with a sigh, deciding to be helpful, and carried his cold, empty mug and the pristine tea over to the counter. He breathed in that oddly soothing fragrance as he went, almost tempted to take the cup with him and dash.
It was one thing to know Harry’s parents died trying to save him, and quite another to witness it. Draco’s fingers itched to reach out and touch Harry, to comfort him, but he couldn’t. He rubbed his left forearm instead, reminding himself of who he was. His hands were shaking.
Draco tried to steer the conversation back to the matter at hand. “Anyway, I asked if you frequent that pub because you seemed very… comfortable there, even if you were uncomfortable at the time.”
The heavy wingback chairs in front of the fireplace looked inviting, but he walked over to his wide mahogany desk instead, rounding it to sit in his own cozy leather chair behind it. Draco set his coffee cup down, removed his notebook from his locked desk drawer with a complicated wand movement, and began reviewing yesterday’s events.
Draco slid his reading glasses off his nose and folded them primly on the table before pressing a hand to his mouth, keeping Harry’s kiss there just a moment longer. He was entirely convinced Harry’s life would fall apart over a single day without Draco, but Draco didn’t mind being organized enough for the both of them; relished it, in fact, since he was currently jobless and judging by the size of his vaults he’d be remaining that way. After a childhood of expectations, it was rather nice to have the choice to simply keep Harry’s head on straight and spend the rest of the day however he pleased. Speaking of—with a flick of his wrist, Draco folded the paper and placed it on the table before hunting around in his pajama bottom pocket for his prize. His fingers closed on silky fabric, and he bit back a pleased smile.
Draco turned around as the music started, something upbeat that felt like a breath of fresh air, and moved to the other side of the shed, sitting on the stool next to his brooms and rolling up his sleeves.
tied low at his nape with a silk ribbon when he was at work, and piled high in a messy bun on the top of his head when he wasn’t.
In the third week of May, Harry decided to pack a bag. He stopped by Grimmauld Place after depositing a boring false memory and being short with his boss, and in a large wooden trunk he hadn’t touched in years, he found the old rucksack he’d used while on the run.
“What do you want, Harry?” he asked, brushing his thumb over the scars on the back of Harry’s hand. Harry looked up at him cautiously.
Draco didn’t even wait after closing the door this time; he simply locked the front door with a flick of his wand, turned around, and walked straight to his bed, unbuttoning his shirt as he went. He got his trousers off just in time to fall into his nest of pillows, pulling the fluffy duvet up to his eyes. He brought his hands up close to his face, his nose next to his wrists, and fell asleep instantly, breathing in the faint scent of treacle and warm grass after rain.
“It’s alright, Harry,” he soothed in his low voice, feeling Harry’s grief and panic surge. “I know this is a nightmare. Look at the walls, see how they’re a bit hazy? Look for your hands—you won’t be able to count your fingers, in a dream.” He let the nightmare pass him.
of times. He even did it when he was reaffirming himself in his own body, because the scars Harry had made, the pain he’d caused, were apparently an
The fire crackled quietly in the grate. Harry bit his lip again, his brow creased in thought as he watched Draco label the new dot on the board: “Adult distrust - Stone.”
He burst through the trees and skidded to a stop at the edge of the cliff, taking a deep breath, the bright, uninhibited sunlight landing warm on his face. The corralled winds whipped up his hair as he stared out over the magnificent fjord, all sheer, dark cliffsides and deep blue waters, brilliant sunlight and endless trees and
“And,” Potter added, “I was pretty sure that was the only way you’d ever kiss me.” He grinned again, like he’d
Harry’s peaceful mood seemed to have evaporated. He set down his teacup, breathing harshly through his nose, his fingers flexing against the armrest of the chair. His eyes were darting from Draco to the door.
He focused on the movement of Draco’s breaths, the warm puffs of air that cooled the sweat on the back of Harry’s neck. Draco lifted their hands from the counter, hooking his chin over Harry’s shoulder as he brought them up to cross over Harry’s chest, holding him there, surrounding him with his warmth. He breathed deeply, and Harry did his best to emulate it, held together solely by strong, pale arms.
“I want to stop this interrogation, because it feels like the Aurors, again. I want to sleep off the Veritaserum. I want to drink Timsy’s hot chocolate.”
“Yes, Master Draco,” Timsy replied, before looking up at Draco with wide, innocent eyes, which immediately made Draco suspicious. “Is Master Draco requiring his slippers as well?”
It took weeks for Harry to gather enough magic for a tap, and those weeks were filled with forcing his weary, burning muscles to move through Paris, sweating in his hotel bed, bickering with nothing and everything, and masochistically checking his journal.
Outside of the Pensieve, Draco removed his hand from his wand and took in the scene. Harry and Hermione hadn’t moved, but they were glaring at each other in silence. Hermione’s hand was raised in a vague gesture, and Harry’s arms were crossed over his chest, looking petulant. They had clearly interrupted something.
“Yes, yes, oh how pureblood training has benefited me. It’s not hard, you know. It’s like learning to fly, or dueling—without all the antagonism or danger.”
“Okay, point is, Healer Malfoy is our best bet,” Weasley interrupted, “since there’s nothing wrong with you physically, the Healers agree this is a problem for the specialist in Mind Curses and Afflictions, and he’s agreed to help regardless of your history, and Harry, you’re just going to have to trust us on this,” he implored, as Potter began to deflate more and more onto the bed in defeat.
“A crush, you are so dense, I told you, you’re only an idiot about things you don’t try to know, Draco! You were never able to stay away from him at school, you did
“Fair,” Ron muttered, sighing again. “We were definitely being arseholes to you back then. But what, then, Draco was pissed that you’d sicced the Minister on him?”
The bird had no message. It only stared, intent and full of love, silently calling him home. Harry felt its gentle, pleading pull, he felt the emotion that fueled it. His ribs fell apart under its gaze, exposing the hole where his heart had been. His hand reached before he realized it and went right through the osprey’s immaterial body.
Draco nodded again in acknowledgement. It was a small comfort knowing he wouldn’t get any awkward conversation from Potter today. Two-thirds of the Golden Trio thanking him was quite enough for one day.
but his throat felt too dry. He cleared it awkwardly, taking another deep breath before opening his eyes again.
Harry slipped off his jacket as he entered, floating it wandlessly to a hook on the wall, not stopping at all as he followed Draco and his many flowers into the kitchen.
“He was a wonderful elf,” Draco said, laughter fading. “I was upset when you freed him, but I’m glad he could get away from the Manor, from my father. I’m glad he was happy.”
face, up close. He hadn’t realized there were flecks of blue in those grey eyes, a light freckle on his cheekbone, next to his eye. He tucked a stray lock of white-blond hair behind Draco’s ear, because he wanted to try it, so bloody
“Yes, we had the wrong rune translation, in an alternate interpretation this one, here, is actually a
More silence. Draco decided he couldn’t continue holding his own body up—he’d have to move to the wall.
When he’d finally acquired the conciliatory bubble tea, full bag of scrunchies in hand, he steeled himself and apparated home.
It wasn’t as though he had purposefully set out to steal Harry’s scrunchies and then hoard them in a way that certainly did not befit a gentleman, but perhaps befit a gentleman who was sometimes, of his
Harry couldn’t help himself—he lifted his chin and kissed Draco again, one more time. “Just seems like a good way to get to know you, s’all,” he mumbled against Draco’s warm, grinning lips. Draco chuckled again and kissed him back softly, his thumb gently brushing along the stubble on Harry’s jaw.
“Ah,” Draco said, giving a sly smile. “You think you’ll be beating me on my own school broom, don’t you? We’ll see.” He picked up his Comet
Harry did not hesitate before walking over to the corner and crouching down on one knee in front of Timsy’s small figure, his eyes level with Timsy’s wrinkled, anxious face. Timsy was clutching nervously at the sleeves of his green jumper, clearly uncomfortable. Harry pulled his wand out of its thigh holster and held it out for Timsy, hilt first. Timsy’s already huge eyes were nearly bulging with anxiety and disbelief.
But Harry swerved and dived through the air without a care for the early spring chill. There was a wide smile on his face, carefree and jubilant, something Draco hadn’t seen since Hogwarts, probably since the last time he had seen Harry on a broom, grabbing the Snitch out from under the nose of an opposing Seeker.
The flames flared green, and Shacklebolt stepped out, dusting nonexistent soot off of his deep violet robes.
“Now, we figure out how to Conjure a human being,” Hermione said, her lips pressed in a grim line. “And continue on with the investigation, until we can’t anymore.” She brought her book over to the table, squeezing Ron’s shoulder. “And then, probably take on the Ministry, as we are wont to do.”
and having his mind invaded. Voluntarily. He couldn’t help the spark of excitement in his gut, making itself known through the nervousness. Fate was cruel, and Harry was indeed an unlucky bastard, but maybe this was supposed to happen, after all.
“This is why I sent the Minister, and not myself,” Harry whispered, after a long, suspended moment. “I didn’t know how to be around you without hurting you.”
though I doubt that was their intention. How many times since then have you done something because you felt like you had to, like you owed it to the world? How many times in these last few weeks were you finally able to do things you
Draco stared at him for one full second, then two, before he burst out laughing, a full belly laugh that had tears leaking out of his eyes. When he was finally able to look at Harry again, Harry’s smile was nearly blinding, his eyes twinkling and shoulders shaking with his own silent laughter.
They might have been on a quest to try every cafe in England. Draco would bring his notebooks (Hermione had shown him the wonder of her parchment notebooks) and the pen he’d gotten from Harry, and set up at a table near a window. Harry would order the weirdest thing on the menu and Draco would order tea, and Harry would sit there and watch Draco write. Sometimes, he brought a book (one of Draco’s novels disguised as a classic). Sometimes, he wrote in his own journal: ideas he had, or things he wanted to tell Draco but couldn’t at the moment.
Harry held his breath as Malfoy slowly woke, grey eyes gradually focusing on Harry’s face, he tensed for the inevitable explosion—
Harry’s faded Weird Sisters t-shirt was a little short on him. It rode up any time Draco lifted his arms over his head, exposing a smooth, pale stomach. An enticing trail of dark blond hair led down from his navel, disappearing under the cinched waistband of low-slung joggers, too big for Draco’s narrow hips.
“I won’t. Serves him right.” Smith inhaled sharply as the wand began to singe his neck. “I couldn’t, even if I wanted to, Potter. It’d require multiple Licensers, and I’m obviously the only one in today.”
“Not final,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Commencing, actually. I ought to be telling you every day, how grateful I am.” Draco smirked, releasing his hand to pull Harry in by his scarf.
completely confident in his ability—that was definitely a formative memory, to Draco. His own mind would have definitely chosen it as a breadcrumb.
“Well done, Harry,” Draco said, enjoying that pleased feeling coming from Harry again. “You’re getting better at this.”
Harry squinted at the two seals adorning the bottom right corner of the parchment, just after the dates and witnesses. There was nothing there about the Veritaserum Harry knew they had used on Draco—which meant it hadn’t been necessary to the license at all. The Licensers had simply wanted to make Draco hurt, to humiliate him, while they held something he wanted and needed over his head.
That was the word. Malfoy took another step, standing close enough that Harry could feel the warmth of him, could witness the difference in the air around him.
The memory ended, and Draco withdrew carefully, not yet letting his Occlumency walls down. He had work to do first. He pointed his wand at the board, made another dot, and frowned, not sure what to label it.
at me like that. Or wreak havoc in the Department of Mysteries, absorb five cities’ worth of magic, get struck by lightning
“You know,” Scorpius said, as if Harry were being dense, “when you’re trying to read, but the letters keep jumping around. It’s
“Draco received a letter this morning, full of death threats and the usual nastiness about ‘Death Eater scum,’ you know,” he said. “He said he gets letters like that sometimes, but nothing this…
Narcissa, so why is his name written here?” Harry’s voice was ice, and Narcissa winced, her expression filled with utter misery.
Harry’s lips quirked. He wondered if Draco actually remembered that, or if the potion had provided the truth.
He looked up and saw a man and woman in plum Wizengamot robes, sitting in the mahogany chairs in front of Kingsley’s desk, staring at him in shock, while Kingsley himself looked somewhere between annoyed and bemused. Harry stood up straight, glaring at the Wizengamot members and radiating as much authority as he could.
for you, then he will be coming to your rescue, right about now. He did the same thing last time, the Dark Lord knew he would, the Dark Lord
Draco sighed and tossed the parchment onto his desk, adjusting his glasses. He grabbed a sheet of fresh stationery and clicked open a biro to pen a delicate, disappointing letter to his mother.
“But other than that, Harry didn’t go very deep into conversations. Anyone that showed interest gave up after enough of Harry’s evasions and rejections, and those people always had more people around to talk to. The only link I could find with any of them was that he was stared at, pretty frequently, by one person alone somewhere in the bar. But, it was always a different person. We think it may have been polyjuice, but there’s nothing else to suggest they were all the same person—just the uncomfortable staring.” Ron shuddered.
“—so you’ll be magically compromised and overloaded, and once you’ve gathered enough magic, which could take
“Hang on, Harry,” Draco murmured, his voice wavering. He could feel their hands still gripping each other tightly, he could hear Harry’s hoarse breaths. “We’re almost there, you’re doing great, here it is—” he latched on to the silvery glow, another group of smaller memories, tainted and hazy with grief.
“I miss her,” Draco said, ignoring him. “But I can feel her. Can you feel her?” He speared Harry with wide, wild eyes. It still felt like Harry was talking to a statue, one that simply moved from one expression to the next. He looked around at the beautiful, snow-covered gardens Narcissa had tended, back to the beautiful, complicated son she had raised.
Draco grabbed his notebook and walked towards the chairs by the fire, motioning for Harry to join him. He gave Harry the chair that faced the door, like last time. Harry had a feeling he’d done that on purpose, to make Harry more comfortable.
“Enjoy your time at the Ministry, Mr. Malfoy,” the wizard mumbled, face still slack with shock. Draco decided to test his new theory by looking him in the eye and giving the man a charming, lopsided grin, saying, “Thank you, Mr. ...Collins,” as he read the man’s badge. The young wizard swallowed and
you’ve got those macaroon things again,” Harry exclaimed quietly, throwing himself into the chair in front of Hermione’s desk.
He’d been here two days. He’d downed the potion as soon as he arrived and checked into a cheap muggle bed and breakfast. But that first day, he hadn’t left the bed.
Teddy came up then to chat eagerly about Harry’s daring rescue mission, not forgetting to remind Draco that he had said they’d have a Seeker’s game, and that he better not think he can get out of it just because he was ill. Camila climbed off to go talk with Rose, bringing Draco’s Grouch stuffie with her.
He turned to Draco after his inspection and brought his index and thumb together on one hand, separating them by about an inch, before making a quick grabbing motion with the same hand.
He had made the ultimate sacrifice for them all—because he had to. Because he always did, because no one else could, or would. And then he
“Potter,” Draco greeted, standing from his comfy chair and shutting the notebook. Potter looked at him, meeting his eyes for a moment and giving him a quick nod, before his gaze continued its wandering journey, taking in the details of Draco’s study. Draco bristled at the scrutiny, feeling protective of his home, but he tried to rein it in. He recognized what Potter was doing, other than familiarizing himself with Draco’s study—walking to the window and looking outside before looking back, and hurriedly inspecting every corner of the room with his eyes. He was taking inventory of exits and escape routes, vulnerabilities for potential threats. He was putting his back against the wall so he could see everything, and every way in or out. Draco did the same thing in unfamiliar places. He still did it at the Manor. He never felt truly safe unless he was behind his own painstakingly-crafted wards, in his very own home.
“I’ve already had two cups this morning,” Draco offered. Conversation had to start somewhere, he figured, even if it was doomed to be one-sided, what with Potter being mute. “As much as I want to—Timsy’s coffee is incredible—having any more than that would make me a very twitchy, ineffective Healer.”
“Harry,” Draco said, more firmly, his brows doing that concerned thing again. Harry smiled at him; it seemed Draco couldn’t help mirroring it, like Harry’s smile was connected to his own. “Tell me.”
Draco’s attention was elsewhere, though, his light eyes darting nervously toward the group of raucous children. Harry couldn’t figure out why. The children were the least threatening of everyone here—Bill kept glaring over at him, muttering with Arthur. George looked like he was contemplating his most dangerous pranks. Ginny looked like she wanted to arm wrestle him. She was currently practicing with Charlie, sending threatening looks Draco’s way.
Draco took a risk, and inched his right foot forward on the carpet, until the tip of his shoe touched Harry’s. It was much less scary than surprise handholding—they could pretend it wasn’t happening, if they wanted to, or they could take comfort from the modest contact. To each his own.
“Yes,” he said softly, his tone resigned. “We have time.” He sighed, blowing warm air over Harry’s neck. He rubbed his hands up and down Harry’s sides. Harry leaned back into his warmth.
After an indeterminate amount of time, the rush in his head slowed as Timsy gathered several potent memories. Draco with his silver lime wand at Harry’s face, the muted trace of candlesmoke, Draco’s carefree joy flying barefoot over the sea, Draco’s elbow brushing his in a forest. The smell of broompolish as he hands Harry a Firebolt, the intensity of grey eyes locking onto his, Draco’s low, quiet voice by the fire,
“Yes, it’s highly likely that was the attacker’s goal, but I’m stumped as to why. I don’t see how this—” Draco gestured between himself and Harry, “—could be beneficial to any sort of agenda, other than getting Harry out of the way for a bit. But there are much simpler ways of getting him out of the way—Harry was pretty much defenseless, at the time. They could have done anything to him, but they did
“Now, how did that particular scene shape you, other than stirring up desires heretofore undiscovered?” Draco pressed his lips together, but couldn’t hold back his giddy laughter. His own cheeks felt hot—he’d had the same thoughts, seeing Cedric Diggory sweaty and covered in dirt and blood after battling a dragon—confused and bitter and aroused and excited, all at once. It was a classic.
. I’m so bloody angry with you. You left, in the middle of the night, without a word. No one heard from you or spoke of you for
Harry stood up on numb legs and left the office. He rushed out of the Department of Mysteries, and did not stop until he reached Ron’s messy cubicle in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
When he finally felt he had some control over himself, he released Harry’s hands and sat back in his chair, pulling away from the warmth of the being in front of him. Only then did he decide to open his eyes.
Draco’s voice drawled in his head. Harry huffed a weak laugh, the sound drowned out by the whipping wind and rain. He thought of Draco, curled under his duvet, his hair fanned out on the pillow, his hand empty and reaching for Harry in his sleep.
Lucius’ voice was like ice, and Draco could feel sweat forming on his brow. He said nothing, keeping his face carefully blank. Lucius raised his wand again, and Draco felt him grabbing hold of the strings, like picking up a puppet.
“Well Draco kind of, vaguely, indirectly told us not to tell you,” she said, uncomfortable. “He generally said he would tell you, himself, if you asked, but he didn’t want us telling you, knowing you’d probably take it up as a cause, something to save him from, which would distract from your healing—“
He looked back down at the room, where everyone had identical frowns of deep thought on their faces. Draco almost laughed. Ron opened his eyes, looking at Draco, and said simply, “I think you should see for yourself.”
“She must have made you do that quite often, for it to scar like that,” Draco said, finally. Harry nodded, his hand back in his lap, fidgeting awkwardly. Draco saw his own blush mirrored on Harry’s face, and felt a little better.
Draco gave an embarrassed grin. “Yes, Bubo. I was stuck on what to name him, so I ended up researching as much about eagle owls as I could—the taxonomic name of the eagle owl is literally
charming, and a little dangerous—those grey eyes sparkling softer than the first snow, with a wicked, blinding grin, sharper than cut crystal.
Harry hesitated for a moment, looking back and forth between them. They were not going to like this—just like they hadn’t liked him testifying for Draco, in the first place.
“Potter, who do you think put it there?” he said. Harry felt something awful, something cold tightening around his chest, weighing on his shoulders. It felt like guilt, like
As if he knew they were talking about him, Boran’s eyes slowly opened, landing first on his mother. He stared at her in disbelief, as if he was worried he was dreaming, that none of it was real. She smiled gently at him, reaching out and taking his hand.
He could feel Harry’s careful breathing on his jaw, and Draco tipped his head down, only a little, which just barely brushed his nose against Harry’s hair, just above his ear. He smelled some sort of spicy, woody scent from his shampoo, and it was hurting him, now, but he still wouldn’t stop.
Harry’s eyes darted back to his for a moment, before looking back down at their hands. “You already knew me, Draco,” he replied softly. “You knew why every one of those memories was important, you knew how they made me who I am. You didn’t need me to tell you anything. You knew me better than I did, and I attacked you for it, and abandoned you and the case, putting your life in danger.”
“Yeah? This is what friends do?” Harry’s hands landed automatically on Draco’s thighs. Draco bit his lip again; Harry’s eyes darted down. “Anything else friends do that I should know about? Now that we’re friends?”
Harry sniffled as he set the note aside and picked up the scroll, examining the ruined, ink-splattered heading:
Harry smiled; he couldn’t help it. His cheeks heated, his fingers toyed with the leather binding of the journal.
Harry sat up as well and mirrored Draco’s position. “You don’t have to mirror me exactly, as long as you’re comfortable, but aware. Now, close your eyes…”
“Master Draco is being here,” he finally croaked, and Harry’s heart leapt, then dropped again at what that meant.
He knew Lucius wouldn’t be able to see it, but he would certainly feel it, all that power. Draco concentrated, studying the waves, working backwards to find its incantations, to hear them hidden among the light—
He didn’t know how to tell him that Death was nothing to be afraid of. That he’d died and come back to life thousands of times, that Harry had witnessed every reincarnation of him, and had loved him all the more for it. He wasn’t sure how to say that not even Death could separate them, that he’d crawl out of the earth for him, they never were able to stay away from each other. That Draco would search relentlessly for him in the next life, and the next. They were inevitable, a force of nature more powerful than Death.
So he let his annoying snake body hang limp in the bird’s firm hold, and waited, wondering how long it’d take him to get back to the school from wherever this creature was taking him.
But it didn’t matter. He was a Healer, and he had work to do. He took a moment in the sitting room to gather himself, breathing deeply, calming the shaking of his muscles, resetting his priorities, before he made his way back to the study, confident that the colour had subsided in his cheeks, at least, if not his lips.
“We haven’t been back down there since, erm, fifth year…” Ron muttered, with a quick glance at the others. “We’re not exactly… welcome? We caused quite a bit of damage…”
How was he supposed to explain himself? His eyes darted nervously around the garden, lingering on Draco’s magnolia tree. He shifted uncomfortably on his feet, feeling incredibly small.
Draco, inexplicably, smiled at him. Harry’s heart stopped, then kickstarted again, pumping all of his blood to his cheeks.
“Trust me, Pansy,” Harry said quietly, standing in front of her to make her look at him, “you don’t want to.”
“I am,” Harry croaked, his feet rooted to the floor as Draco’s hands raised, timidly, hesitating just over Harry’s arms—then lowered again as he warred with himself.
“Thank you, Timsy,” Draco said fondly as he slipped it on, enjoying its warmth. The elf walked away, muttering under his breath, something about “Master has too many clothes, he is never knowing where anything is, never learning, he is filling the whole house…”
“Well, I’m sure you would be, too, if your mum went missing,” Harry mumbled, oddly defensive. Ron gave another grave nod.
“The protection of his mother’s love,” Draco’s voice came out of his own mouth, sounding foreign and monotone without his control over it, but he smirked anyway, asserting himself the only way he was able to. Lucius frowned.
it—” a sob tore itself from his chest, the pain of the last six months finally breaking through. Draco moved closer, surrounding him with the soothing scent of eucalyptus, containing him.
“Sounds right up your alley, Potter,” he grumbled. “You always excelled at being useless and creepy.”
“I learned how to buy the baklava, after watching another muggle do it, with two of the blue paper money they use. I went to Gringotts and told them to convert a sum into the blue muggle papers, with the ‘5’ on them, so now I have a stash of them. The first time, I handed over the requisite two blue papers, and the muggle at the counter tried to hand me change, but I don’t know what to do with the other colours or the different coins, so I told him to keep it, and he liked that. Now we have a routine, where I go in, and they know I want the baklava, and I give them the two blue papers, and I always tell them to keep the change, and they smile at me.” What an odd thing for the potion to insist on explaining, Draco thought as he gasped for air, again.
Harry did know that. Maybe. He took a deep breath, counting it in and out, the way Draco taught him.
Harry had imagined the garden at Malfoy’s “place” to look like something prim and proper and precise, like the Dursley’s garden, but much more expensive. He’d expected white peacocks and those unnerving shrubs trimmed to look like majestic creatures. And probably a koi pond with a cherubic fountain and ornately carved marble benches, where one could sit leisurely and read their pureblood genealogies in the sunshine.
The water was a little choppy, but the boat’s path was surprisingly smooth, even as storm clouds gathered overhead. Harry wondered if they were Narcissa’s doing or his own.
One drink, his jokes get a little more self-deprecating. Two, he gets quiet, tapping his fingers impatiently against his glass. After three, he’s staring at Potter, speaking only when spoken to. Four, he’s drowning under the weight of everything he can’t have, smothered by his own inadequacies.
“Then we’ll finish with one more meditation, which is meant to help you reaffirm your control over your mind, and your autonomy over your body, like I just did. I’ll guide you through this one, but after today, you’ll do the ending meditation on your own. It’s important for me not to have sway in how you return to yourself, understand?” Draco paused briefly, before adding, “Plus, you’ll be quite sick of my voice in your head after a while. You’ll want to do this part on your own.”
But Harry only put down his notebook, and held his hands up, then held out one finger, pointed up, to Timsy. Harry Potter was telling Draco’s house elf,
It felt like long hair tickling his face and a gentle hand on his chest, and a life-affirming question.
Harry shuffled to the lift and rode it all the way to the top floor. He eventually found a hatch that opened to the roof and dragged himself up.
“Let us begin with something easy,” Lucius muttered, sitting down on a stool in front of him. “Tell me how Harry Potter survived two Killing Curses.”
Harry huffed a laugh at Draco’s shocked expression as the Patronus dissipated, looking back down at him with one eyebrow raised.
“Was that the first time your friends died, while protecting you?” Draco asked softly, and Harry grimaced, closing his eyes and nodding slowly.
“We can’t help who we love, Mother,” he said, eyes darting to Pansy’s raised eyebrow before returning to Narcissa. “You’ve done nothing wrong. I know he Imperiused you.”
Draco moved in for a closer look, and saw a small scroll of parchment tied to the handle on the top of it. He didn’t touch it, but took out his wand and unrolled it with magic. He couldn’t be too careful—he still got hate mail, occasionally, and some of it was cursed or covered in bubotuber pus—
Potter scrubbed his hand through his hair, causing it to curl back from his forehead in what should not be an attractive way. How could anyone look that good with such illogical, untameable hair? His hand came down to rub over his jaw as he turned his calculating gaze to his friends. They were quiet, recognizing that he was in the process of making a decision. The room was silent but for the soft sound of Potter’s calloused fingers absently rubbing over his stubble.
were you able to steal a vial of Veritaserum from an Auror?” She asked, and Draco scowled at her. She would have made an excellent Slytherin. Harry was looking at her with pride, and thoughtfulness.
This chapter includes Veritaserum and some flashbacks/memories/references to past abuse. Just a warning!
It’d still felt like standing on the edge of a cliff, having Harry Potter on his lap, throwing down a gauntlet, waiting for his yes. But maybe that was alright. Draco was terrified, but maybe he could jump anyway. It might not even be a fall, or a gruesome collision with rocky earth—he might fly, he might float. He might dive, and relish in the freedom and thrill of it. He wouldn’t know unless he tried, and even though it frightened him half to death, he knew he wouldn’t forgive himself if he didn’t.
Harry thought for a moment, and shook his head, no. Draco sat back, contemplating the memory, twirling another lock of hair through his fingers with his elbow propped on the armrest. Harry watched his hand, again.
Draco whispered, a not-quite-Legilimency spell to enter the mind. Draco could see Potter’s mind now as more of an apparatus, or an organism. He wasn’t intruding, not yet. Just looking. It looked like a glowing, writhing, living, web—always a bit disconcerting, but always breathtakingly beautiful. It reminded Draco of a fully transformed Veela, without the allure, all light and magic and near-violent energy. Potter’s mind glowed gold, red, and green, twisting and whirring and sparkling with his magic. Draco admired it for a moment, breathing in the indulgent scent of treacle and a garden after rain, before setting to work.
Harry opened his mouth to ask more, but Ron and Hermione chose that moment to walk in with takeaway.
Draco jumped a little when he finally noticed him, then rolled his eyes, grabbing a glass of wine from the counter.
Finally, he let out a huff, and closed his eyes as he nodded his assent to the room. The other occupants let out a collective breath, and Draco moved forward to grab Potter’s chart from the foot of the bed. He sat in the chair on the other side of the bed, crossed one long leg over the other, and pulled his tortoiseshell reading glasses from his jacket pocket, putting them carefully on his face. He started to read over the file, familiarizing himself with its contents, until he realized the silence of the room was heavy with something he hadn’t expected.
But Harry had at least believed him, and trusted him. And Draco trusted Harry, too, after being taken care of like that, and having Harry prove that he was safe, in their agreed sanctuary, even when he was terrified. Draco felt the trust almost as a physical thing, between them, an imaginary rope being braided with more strands of experience every time they interacted, growing stronger with each addition.
Draco. Completely exploded on him. Ron had to hold me back from punching him, though it looked like he wanted to, too. I threw my badge at him and left. In front of everyone. Which means it’s going to be in the papers tomorrow, and I’m so sorry—” Harry’s eyes flew open, taking Draco’s trembling hand in both of his. “Draco. Darling, you’re shaking.”
Her eyes were wide and anxious, her grip firm where she held Harry’s shoulders. Harry was sweating from the effort of forcing himself to find a way around his contract, which must have been tightened recently. That, or he’d never needed to test it like this before. He could practically hear Hermione’s brain whirring behind her eyes, and begged internally that she would understand.
Weasley had grown up, definitely—his shoulders and chest had broadened significantly to fill his tall frame, effectively moving him from lanky, gawky teenager to intimidating Auror. Draco was irritated to note Weasley had at least a couple inches on him, which was no small feat. The fabric of his navy Auror uniform was perfectly tailored, but still straining over the muscles of his shoulders, arms, and thighs, and honestly, when did wet-shoelace-Ronald-Weasley get so stupidly
Harry looked torn between anxious and impressed, staring up at Draco with wide eyes behind the round frames of his glasses. Draco’s eyes were glued to his face, watching and even hoping for a denial, a debate. For some reason, it didn’t feel good, confirming how deeply entrenched Harry was in the role of hero—yes, he felt he had to, but did he actually
“Timsy,” Kingsley mumbled in what may have been a greeting, or an observation. His eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed shrewdly at Parkinson. “Aren’t you the one who—“
Draco stared at him incredulously, shaking his head. Harry had made him wear Harry’s own clothes, for this excursion, because the git couldn’t dress down to save his life, and had packed nothing but button downs and light trousers (“this
out of those descriptions. Maybe they only did for Harry—Ron had certainly gotten it out of them, the git.
Before Harry could form any words, the door of the cottage flung open, and Draco Malfoy stepped out, looking wary and disgruntled and—
Draco’s breathing was shallow, uneven, difficult through the painful lump in his throat. With shaking arms, he brought the strong hands he held to his face, holding the backs of the fingers to his forehead and cheek, feeling the warmth beneath the skin.
Her presence was constant, but hesitant. He could feel her every emotion, now, twice as strong as before. He felt her like he felt the island, like magic long dormant being drawn to Harry’s positive charge. She watched over him, and he felt her guilt, her care, as she became
Soon, the garden began to smell like perfectly roasted coffee. Draco could hear the hissing and crackling of the beans on the cooling tray. He sat up with a sigh, giving the constellations one last glance, and made his way inside, vanishing the blanket with a lazy swish of his wand.
Draco finally caught up, panting, and froze, taking in the incredible view. Harry looked back at him with an irrepressible grin, and it seemed to pull one out of Draco, too, regardless of his complaints. Draco ran a slender hand through his sweaty hair, sighing contentedly at the cool winds on his skin. He leaned back against a tree trunk—Harry knew he wasn’t a huge fan of heights.
Another tally mark scratched onto the cold, stone wall. Draco wasn't sure if it was accurate—the cell was windowless, but for the single peephole of unbreakable rectangular glass on the heavy door, locked and warded. He measured days with his sleep cycle, staying awake as long as he could, then succumbing to exhaustion. One day.
do you keep asking, Potter?” Draco growled. It was hard to take him seriously with the puffy blue duvet around his shoulders. Harry shrugged, rotating his mug of tea on the table between his restless hands.
Draco nodded again, eyes wide. “Sounds like something Old Voldy would do,” he said, surprising himself at the slip of the silly nickname. Harry’s lips quirked at it.
“I’m a Falcons fan, myself,” Draco said. “They’re not doing too well, this season, but we know they’ll turn it around.” He gave Teddy a private grin.
Unless… Draco frowned harder. Hiding Harry’s voice did limit his healing options quite a bit. It was really something only a Healer Legilimens should handle, and Legilimency was indeed a very fast and intense way to get to know someone. But Legilimency shouldn’t be used to just get to know somebody, it was horribly invasive, not to mention dangerous if done incorrectly. Draco certainly wouldn’t trust a Legilimens who cast on him
“Tell Ron Draco wants tikka masala,” Harry told it, before glancing back at Draco. “What do you think Timsy wants?”
“Malfoy,” she replied coolly. Then, apparently mustering the strength for something, “Thank you for coming.”
Harry laughed, leading the way up the hillside. He could nearly smell it, nearly hear the rush of the tunneled wind. They were
Soon enough, Potter put his pen down, and after a great hesitation, handed his notebook to Draco. It only had a couple sentences on it.
“He somehow found out I was working with you, and basically wanted to tell me to hurry it up,” Draco explained. “He told me—in so many words—that he can’t afford to not have you available as a political tool, otherwise the Wizengamot will fall to the control of blood purists and traditionalists.” He gave Harry a sharp look, raising one disapproving eyebrow, hoping that conveyed all of his distaste.
It felt like the strength and resilience of pulling a family through a war, like a soft hand over his beating heart and
—and pulled out his wand, slowly, aiming it at his feet, concentrating hard on the thought of his favourite slippers as he transfigured his shoes.
Could this be the last straw? The moment Harry realized Draco wasn’t actually the competent man he’d eloped with, but instead a mess who wasn't strong enough to resist his own strange, ferrety urges?
“I have a feeling you hated that kind of power, even when you were thirteen,” Draco muttered, and Harry frowned, nodding. “Do you understand how unique that is?”
The island had powerful magic, but it was dark, and built on centuries of despair. It was not anything he wanted to expose himself to, even with the Dementors evicted.
The kettle started whistling, and Draco reluctantly pulled away to finish making their tea, hiding his face in the curtain of his hair.
Draco tilted his head down in response. “Understandable,” he said, “I wear glamours or transfigure my face when I have to go out shopping or dining in Wizarding districts.” He paused, remembering the spit on his face the one time he tried to restock his potions ingredients in person, as himself—and the violence and jeers of the approaching mob as he walked down Diagon Alley toward Gringotts, at nineteen. He had fled in disapparition before he ever arrived. “Pansy doesn’t allow it, says I have to ‘face them head on,’ or something, but she’s scary enough that people don’t bother us when we’re together.”
When seven o’ clock finally came around that evening, Draco was standing in his sitting room, perfectly still, dressed informally—he was going to a
Boran inhaled sharply as his head snapped up, eyes wide with fear. “I’m sorry,” he said quickly, “I didn’t mean to!”
He pulled the small pouch hurriedly out of his pocket, and accidentally elbowed someone else in line for the floo.
Teddy and Andromeda might enjoy a visit from him. Teddy could talk enough for three people, he wouldn’t mind Harry’s silence.
Hermione hesitated uncomfortably before answering. “It’s not a very nice story. They sort of fall prey to a cannibalistic old witch with a house made of sweets, who fattens them up like pigs for slaughter. They end up murdering her with her own oven, and barely escaping with their lives.” She shuddered. “Gave me nightmares as a child. Not a good bedtime story.” She thought for a moment. “Also a terrible portrayal of magical people, but not entirely atypical for the muggle world, especially at the time it was written, in the middle ages.”
Draco rolled his eyes. They both shared dramatic tendencies, it was how they got along so well, after all this time. Their interactions would do well on a stage. He loved her for it, even when it was annoying as shit.
Harry wasn’t even bothering with his own meal anymore. He narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing him, growing more annoyed with each moment his revenge wasn’t fulfilled.
“Is that Oscar the Grouch?” Draco asked, with a small gesture towards the fuzzy green creature. She looked up at him in surprise, both of her brown eyes now visible, little face framed by the full head of wild, curly hair. She nodded vigorously.
So Harry cleaned his house; he plaited and replaited his hair. He tried to cook, but it felt wrong to cook for just one. He ran laps around the neighbourhood, and worked out in the library, and argued with the supercilious portraits of Blacks long gone.
If everyone could have stopped asking him questions and let him ride this sodding panic out, that would have been great. Harry forced himself to think, to remember that inconceivable person, the ease with which they’d caught him off guard, lowered his defenses, and given him an order. He felt sick, his hands were sweaty and shaking, but he shook his head in answer.
“And that is the difference between owning or rejecting your name, my son. You are leashed by the Ministry, while the Ministry is leashed by
Harry tore himself away and threw up a hefty shield charm around Draco's prone body, just as the transformation began, the sickening crack of shifting bone and flesh tearing and twisting itself into a massive body covered with inky black fur, piercing Draco with glowing, bloodthirsty green-gold eyes, and one word snarled and spat through a lengthening throat:
of the reasons why, but that’s not enough to make a formative memory, that’s not enough to shape who you are. Doing the right thing isn’t new, for you.”
He thought hard for a moment, trying to think of what else he wanted to know. Was there anything he was curious about that might also make Draco feel better right now?
the idiot, for trusting the Unspeakables, and for volunteering to get herself Vanished, and for believing that
Draco furrowed his brows as he opened the tin of broom polish, breathing in the scent, grabbing a couple of rags and his Firebolt from the rack on the wall. He laid a rag on his knee and leaned the broom against it, dipping the other rag into the polish.
how you’ve always been. You’re the Chosen One and the Saviour, the same way you were the protector of the Sorcerer’s Stone when you were eleven. You had to take up the role, own the scar and all it represented, because no one else would...”
“Are you referring to eleven-year-old me? If I could go back?” Draco asked, and Harry gave a quick nod, chewing his lip again. Draco looked at him for a moment, formulating his honest reply, however scary it was.
With a jolt of panic, Harry raised his wand, made several rapid circular movements in the air, casting nonverbal Bubble-Head Charms on everyone in the room.
Harry thought distantly, before beating it away and focusing on the task at hand. At least he was using it for something good, this time, right?
Draco nodded, as Weasley stared, open-mouthed, at his muggleborn wife. It was a creepy story, and unrealistic—that witch must have been truly senile to be overpowered and outwitted by two muggle children, but she was obviously barmy if she was trying to eat them anyway.
Harry looked at him warily, and let out a long, exhaustive breath. Draco waited for a moment, watching him.
“Also it’s rather strange,” Draco said. “A bit too much, even—even for you.” His voice was smaller than he intended, and Harry ducked his head around until he met Draco’s gaze. He was smiling softly, his eyes bright with naked adoration, and Draco’s anxiety unraveled infinitesimally at the sight of his husband’s dear face.
“I am impressed you managed to catch one, Teddy,” Narcissa commented, smiling fondly and snapping her fingers to summon one of the house elves. “They’re always too quick for me.”
He was fucking exhausted. Prague felt like molten brass in his veins, shiny and bright, inflating and inflamed. He could feel the links he had to Paris and the Isle of Man, but in the background, dulled like his memories used to be, blurred by the instability of his core and the fiery whip of his footsteps on the streets of Prague.
there. He looked up at Draco suddenly, through his glasses, too-bright green eyes piercing Draco from under thick, dark lashes, and Draco inhaled sharply, feeling a jolt of heat run up his spine.
Because he is. He is definitely staring. He always ends up like this, on pub night. He arrives as a delightful friend to have around, and leaves as a miserable fuck.
“Timsy!” he called, setting down his food and standing as Timsy apparated in. Timsy sighed as he heard what was playing.
“Such a Gryffindor,” he chastised, flustered. “We won’t go barging back in just like that. Finish your chocolate, we’ll do some more breathing first, then you can show me whatever you want to show me.”
“Er… Healer Hannah Abbott, Spell Damage Specialist, Hufflepuff, former member of Dumbledore’s Army. I know you kissed Cho Chang under a mistletoe in fifth year in the Room of Requirement. She described it as ‘fine.’ When you returned to Hogwarts before the Battle, you said you had to find something hidden in the castle that had to do with Ravenclaw—”
—before sweeping the room with his eyes, just once. Draco’s study was sort of familiar, now. He no longer felt like an enemy could be lurking around any corner.
Yes, this was bad. Very bad. Timsy’s glare kickstarted something in Harry’s brain, and now he remembered: an overdose like this would last for hours, and Draco would soon go into more painful convulsions, and there was nothing either of them could do about it.
Harry takes a deep breath of warm air full of sugar and citrus, but his lungs can’t quite manage it; there’s not enough room, with everything else he’s holding in.
“Stupid—Gryffindor—” she panted, rolling off of Harry as he tried desperately to draw breath. Not his finest landing, but he had Draco’s bloody
“... it was like they were moving on, becoming adults, without you. You may have thought that you’d never have something like they had, that you’d be stuck where you were, unable to move forward with them.”
Harry hadn’t wanted to risk hurting the magical folk of Copenhagen, but his potion supply was dwindling rapidly, and he wouldn’t be able to acquire them on the island of Azkaban. He’d needed to bribe the brewer with a sizable chunk of his Gringotts vault, but it had to be done.
“Then I think we’ll be alright. We’ve got no other option.” Ron moved to the center of the room, raising his wand and aiming it at one of the doors. “Three teams: Harrison, Bones, Stanley, take a door. Shacklebolt, Jeffries, you’re with me, and Harry, you’ve got those two, as you’ve
to back down, when you know full well I’ll never stop looking for her. So I can only assume this is where I become obsolete, where you
Draco’s traitorous brain supplied again, but he ignored it, determined to prove his point. The song that started playing was nice and slow, anyway, an easy one. He sat up and stood with a swift, graceful movement, and held out his hand.
Harry entered the house, and Draco noticed he hadn’t worn his leather jacket, deciding a thin green jumper was all the layering he required. Draco only missed it a little bit—the jumper brought out his eyes, which made up for it, and he smiled at Draco, which made his breath catch and caused him to choke, a bit, effectively wiping away all other preoccupations.
“You got the important part,” Narcissa whispered when he brought it up again. The words sounded unnatural, as if she was relying on a muscle memory she’d only just made.
“I will,” Draco replied, though he knew the chances were less than slim. If Lucius wouldn’t speak to his devoted wife, he
He opened his eyes and looked at Harry, who was watching him with a wary face, as if he had just been reminded of who Draco really was, which he had been. Draco continued rubbing his thighs, but the energy wouldn’t leave him. He stood up and began pacing back and forth in front of the window, occasionally shaking out his hands. Harry continued to watch.
He realized, then, as he pushed his magic through Draco’s arteries and felt it flowing like warm wind throughout his entire body, that this was actually really, shockingly intimate. He was
“Who is ‘we’? And why can’t you ask him?” Draco sipped his coffee in an attempt to soothe his frayed temper. He closed his eyes to breathe in the rich aroma. Damn, Timsy made the
When it slowed, it was a jumble, a bit hazy, which was expected of early memories like this. He took a moment to look around, not stopping on anything for long enough to interpret, looking for anything that stood out.
He felt Harry’s shocked, furious breaths on his face for two seconds more, and then the burning wand left his skin. He heard Harry’s footsteps moving away from him, opening the door, then running down the hall to the sitting room. He heard the floo flare, he heard Harry call out, “Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place!”, he heard the
“Feel ready for one more?” he asked, raising his wand. Harry hesitated, one hand out, and quickly started writing again.
Camila nodded, her hair falling into her face. “I’ll go get her,” she said seriously. She loved being given important tasks. She dashed out of the room on her errand.
He walked to the window, drawing open the curtains to reveal a grey, misty day. As he felt the wards wobble with Harry’s arrival, he smoothed out wrinkles in his dark blue shirt. Nothing was ever simple with Harry Potter involved, he shouldn’t be surprised that it could turn on his head at any moment.
to discuss.” He held up his still shaking hand in emphasis. “But you are vulnerable to me, in here, so I allow myself to be vulnerable with you, in here, too. Any question you ask of me will be answered honestly, and without judgement. I am taking a risk, as well, you understand—you will learn things about me that I’d rather keep to myself, and if you wanted to, you could run to the Daily Prophet and tell them everything. You could even
“He told me something else, too,” Draco continued, trying very hard not to sound too accusatory. “He told me that
There was one light on in the window of Draco’s sitting room; a bright, singular beacon in a world of darkness. It called him home like nothing else could.
He found a ball-point pen in the nightstand and brought it to the page. He knew that Draco wouldn’t see whatever he wrote, but this one-sided connection was his only comfort at the moment. It could very well be his last words, he thought morbidly—tomorrow, he would get himself struck by lightning in the middle of an ancient rock circle.
“Please, tell me I’m wrong, Draco,” she said, enunciating every word. “Tell me you did not take on the fucking
“Creep,” Malfoy murmured fondly, one pale hand leaving his book to land on Harry’s cheek. Harry was too shocked to move. “You’re always doing that. Can’t you just get in bed with me like a normal person?”
“Thanks, Timsy,” Harry said as he crouched down to the low shelf, reading the tag he was pointing to.
But right now, he only wanted a new pack of scrunchies, because his hair had been falling in his face all day—all morning, it wasn’t even noon—and then to pick up bubble tea from the place nearby that Draco liked, and maybe that would help cushion the blow that Harry was a big, messy, hotheaded disappointment who couldn’t provide for his husband. Well, he still had his inheritance—plenty of money in the vault. But he’d been hoping to, perhaps, save it, for a possible potential future maybe child—anyway, it was the principle of the thing—
Potter,” Draco grumbled, swatting at him. Harry’s enthusiasm skewed Draco’s gold-framed reading glasses, which now sat crookedly on his scrunched, pointy nose. Harry chuckled, kissing him again, full of fondness. Draco smiled into it, despite his complaints, despite his exaggerated spitting noises as Harry’s long, untamed curls intruded upon his face.
“I think we have time for best two out of three, yeah?” Draco yelled, flying in tight circles to warm up his muscles. Harry smiled at him from across the garden, coming out of a Sloth Grip Roll, and released the Snitch.
Harry grinned at him, sitting up comfortably, putting his hands on his knees and closing his eyes. His breathing slowed, and Draco could tell he was counting through them, inhaling for four, holding for two, exhaling for four, over and over.
“Yes,” he answered hoarsely, unable to articulate anything more intelligent. It didn’t matter, anyway, because this was still probably a dream.
The spell lit up him and Parkinson, but not Timsy. Harry frowned, thinking quickly, trying to remember the other spells—
with it, now that you’re free? You never learned how to do what you wanted, so you just keep doing what you
Potter’s face was pure shock, once he got past the angry narrowing of his eyes at the thought of Legilimency. Draco couldn’t identify which part of his last sentences had caused him to be so appalled. Maybe the use of Voldemort’s name?
The little cottage he appeared in front of was homely, and quite charming. They were closer to the Channel, here, than Draco’s home was—he could feel it in the cool breeze, smell the faint hint of sea air. As he began his walk up the stone path towards the front door, his nerves returned in full force. What was he doing here? Did he really think he was going to be welcome at the home of
He always did. Draco seemed to hate himself for it, every evening. Harry hated himself, too, for being useless and creepy, for putting Draco through this, for the things he was forbidden to speak of. But it all went away the second their lips met, consuming and igniting, killing and reviving, over and over.
His hair was loose, today, long and wavy and almost as white as the snow, falling over his shoulders like a veil. A few strands lifted in the breeze, swaying around his striking face, carrying weightless snowflakes. Harry could have stared at him for ages, especially if he wasn’t going to be acknowledged, but it looked like Malfoy’s lips were turning blue, so he draped the warmed cloak over Malfoy’s shoulders, instead.
“...but the scar was yours, before it was theirs,” Draco mumbled, frowning, pieces clicking together in his own mind. “And when it became a symbol of the Boy Who Lived, followed by the Chosen One, followed by the Saviour… you still took up the mantle, each time, even when it was thrust upon you. Because you had to—that’s just
He curled his palms over the inside of Draco’s wrists, directly over the veins. His fingers wrapped around Draco’s forearm, slipping inside his shirt cuffs. Harry felt the tip of his finger graze the edge of what he knew was the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm. His skin was so soft, and so
“Harry,” Malfoy murmured, shocking him. Had he ever said Harry’s name like that before? “I know you have no reason to trust me. But I won’t ply you with empty words, I won’t grovel at your feet. The only way you’ll know I’m not the same boy I was is if you see it for yourself, but I won’t waste my time if you won’t bother giving me a chance.”
Potter shot up in his bed at the mention of Legilimency, looking from Weasley to Granger and back with wild, betrayed eyes. He couldn’t speak, but Draco could read that, too:
until the glow appeared, covering another hefty chunk of memories, similar to the breadcrumb of Harry’s eleventh birthday—but these looked dark, painful. Draco took a deep breath, and seized them with his magic.
In his best effort at Occlumency, he imagined himself carefully tucking it away—walking out of the library, grabbing his cloak, draping it over Draco’s shoulders—Draco’s blue lips, his freezing hands, the snowflakes in his eyelashes—“
Draco choked as pain exploded in his core, and he cried out with it as his body doubled over, this was
Kramer chuckled and nodded. “Yes, how witty,” he replied dryly, informing Harry that he did indeed watch the memories as soon as Harry deposited them, and so far thought nothing was amiss.
“Yes,” Harry answered, turning his glare back to the Minister, holding his hand out towards the door. “After you.”
He padded quietly over to the table and crouched down next to Draco’s chair. He laid a careful hand on Draco’s arm, giving it a light squeeze.
Draco huffed a laugh, shaking his head in wonder. He wanted to snog the living daylights out of him, he wanted to take Harry apart right there in the garden, he wanted to climb on top of him and make him come undone.
to those around him. Who would take on the roles thrust upon him because he believed he had to, because he always did, because apparently, no one else would. You gave the Wizarding World
“She was Vanished,” he said in a rush, “as an Unspeakable experiment. I managed to re-Conjure her… I had to go a few places. I may have… done it wrong—”
Harry gasped as the child’s strained, monotone voice echoed around his skull, but when it was over, he clutched the sphere tight in his fist. What utter
but Kramer only gave him an annoyed, reproachful look, as if Harry had failed him in the simplest task.
“I want to make sure you know I’m telling you the truth.” He handed the bottle to Harry. “Check it,” he ordered. “It’s Auror-grade Veritaserum, straight from the Ministry.”
His mind raced. That was definitely Malfoy, Harry would recognize him anywhere, though it had been a few years since he’d last seen him—he clearly wasn’t much of a threat, half-dressed in pyjamas, asleep. Malfoy had too much pride to fight him like
“Doubtful,” Draco said, turning in his arms. “I was forced to watch that performance at the Yule Ball, with the rest of the bloody school.”
“Tell me why you joined the Unspeakables, and what you did for them,” Draco demanded softly. Harry propped himself up on his elbow, smiling down at Draco’s pout. He took his hand, lacing their fingers between their bodies.
“Anyway,” Ron cleared his throat. “How do you know she hasn’t just decided to take a spontaneous holiday?”
Unfortunately, Hermione Granger, brightest witch of her age, had picked up on this fact, and had caught on to Draco’s methods much too quickly, darting her eyes back and forth between him, Ron and Harry. She was obviously thinking of what Draco had told them about honesty in front of his patients, but only when they asked, and possibly remembering the situation he had been in at eighteen. She looked at him shrewdly, and Draco thought he could see a little light of victory in her eyes, as she continued to solve the puzzle of Draco Malfoy in her head.
Harry flicked the knight on the chess board and pointed to the square he wanted him to move to. The horse huffed at him, severely offended.
Harry’s mouth twisted in a grimace, and Draco didn’t know which part of his answer was the most distasteful. The War memories? The ones after? The amount of work they had ahead of them?
Harry sagged with relief, tugging Hermione into his arms. She squeezed him back, her face in the shoulder of his Unspeakable robes.
“Yeah, I know,” Ron said with a tired smirk. “Alright, fine. Keeping an eye on Malfoy was always your area of expertise, anyway.”
He felt Harry’s hands tighten on his wrists, he heard Harry’s own voice in Harry’s head, for the first time.
He Conjured an empty glass vial, placed his wand to his temple, and pulled out the memory of his day—Malfoy’s cottage, Malfoy’s hair, Malfoy’s tea, Malfoy’s hands—Malfoy’s voice, his anxiety over his mother, his conviction that she was alive—the looming fortress of Malfoy Manor, the dark vines that climbed its sides, the house elves in their clean clothes. He dropped it carefully into the thin glass mouth of the bottle.
Hermione looked away. “They, erm… they’re a bit embarrassed, I think. They were quite disturbed to find out you were magically bound to Healer’s Ethics—they just thought you were a stickler, or something. I doubt they would have allowed it to continue if they’d known, to be honest.”
These were the kind of sights Harry had been hoping to see when he agreed to become an Observer. When he ignored the constant pain and burning sensations of his potions, and the feeling of having the magic of an entire city clawing at his fragile magical core, and the absence of Draco or his friends, this was an experience he’d have loved.
” Kingsley scoffed. “But it is beyond the limit of my power. The DoM is practically its own entity. They keep to themselves, they hide in their books and their mysteries of life, they bother no one. I simply sign off a budget approval for Level Nine, every year, and leave them to their studies.”
Draco let out a whimper of mixed fear and relief as Harry's hot, trembling body covered him. "I waited—"
The wind and sun was invigorating against Draco’s face. He felt like a part of the air, swerving and diving and drifting with the currents. It was exhilarating, competing against Harry again, even casually, in the way they both loved best. By the joyful, carefree look on Harry’s face, and the way he kept careful watch on Draco in the air, eyes alight with competition, he was feeling the same, and Draco didn’t want it to end. He wanted to stay up there, where he and Harry were friends who loved flying together, but eventually Harry caught the Snitch for the second time, effectively winning and ending their little contest, and they made their way to the ground.
romantic. I bet all the muggles gift it to their lovers. I’m simply impressed you finally found the guts to leave your home and your job and go
“He decided to act on that prophecy, remember? He set it in motion, he’s making it come true. You remember it, yeah?” Draco’s voice was low and hushed, and he kept his eyes on the boy’s face, willing him to understand, to take Draco’s reassurance. Boran nodded faintly.
Draco rolled his eyes as his temper flared. “You’re really making me glad I let you in, Weasel. Timsy was freed as soon as the war ended, but he’s lived with Malfoys for generations and he wanted to stay with me, so I pay him, and he gets time off, and whatever else Granger wanted from that PUKE business she was making noise about in school. Happy?” He figured adding ‘and he’s a cherished part of my family’ would be a bit much this early in the morning.
It was when Willem agreed that something was terribly wrong that Harry caved and sent a Patronus to Ron.
, and you alone. Accept or deny these terms, but let me know now, if I need to get the Obliviation over with.”
Draco watched him for a moment. “I’ll admit I was surprised to see him and Andromeda at the Manor,” he said, trying to convey the rest of his thoughts nonverbally, hoping that he wouldn’t have to say
Harry was breathing hard, his nostrils were flaring. He looked angry, but it was widening into fear, then pleading, and Draco knew he understood, even if he didn’t want to admit it.
Maybe Malfoy was here to finish Harry off, avenge his imprisoned father or something—Harry nearly laughed. Malfoy couldn’t kill. Harry had seen that himself, right here in this wide open room, at the top of this formidable tower.
He hadn’t been allowed to find where it began or ended, he was forbidden to go beyond the property lines—there were
into Gryffindor, as I recall.” More soft huffs, more amusement. Draco found the sorting memory with ease; it still had its silvery glow around it.
“Do you wanna see my new scrunchies?” Harry asked, his voice muffled in Draco’s shirt. Draco shivered—
“It was a dressing-down for the history books, Draco,” Pansy teased. “Wish you were there. Throwing chairs with accidental magic and everything.”
“Where’s Draco?” Harry asked, poking his head into the library. He’d looked all over the Manor, with no luck.
Draco concentrated hard, connecting himself back to his body outside of the Pensieve, making himself put his hand on his wand in his pocket. Ron watched him curiously.
“Her,” Willem said, waving his hand to the air above them, “who is following you. You know she is, yes?”
Draco’s shadow covered the light again, and the door swung open to reveal him, lean and ruffled and maddeningly beautiful. Draco looked exhausted, agitated, almost frenzied, his hand clenched on the doorknob like it was the only thing tethering him to the earth. His eyes landed directly on Harry’s own.
“Harry,” Draco said, standing from his chair. He set down his book on the table and started walking slowly towards Harry, his sharp, pale face transforming gradually from joy to concern as he approached. He looked like a dream, and Harry’s heart raced wildly, his feet rooted to the spot.
“We’re sure, Harrison, and if you or anyone else is going to doubt us, you can leave right now. We have no time to debate this, and I have no patience to deal with any prejudice while lives are in danger.”
“Why do you think I had such good marks in school?” Draco said. “Second-best, of course,” he added in another grumble behind his hand. Harry smirked—he could
“Agreed, Granger, not a fun story. But the breadcrumbs are the best analogy here. Sometimes, I have to find all of the breadcrumbs and connect the dots, which together make a countercurse,” Malfoy explained, pulling Harry back to the present. “Sometimes the patient has been thrown into their unconscious mind, and has to be guided along a trail to find their way back.”
the Department, I have friends, allies, all over the country—” Draco doubted that very much, “—this only affects
As soon as he finished reading, words were coming out of Draco’s mouth, beyond his control. “Because I don’t want to take any chances that you won’t believe me,” Draco heard, and yes, that was true, but the potion demanded more, so he finished with, “and because that’s how much they normally used on me, so I assumed you would want me to use that much, too.”
Draco sighed, and caught a glimpse of the thin, jagged scars on Harry’s hand. He motioned toward them with his head, and met Harry’s eyes. “May I?”
I will return, when I return to society, I have already studied everything they have here, most of which is
“Yes, exactly,” Harry chuckled, and Draco’s lips twitched—he’d heard that one from Draco, too. “I’ll show you. Hermione taught me this spell a long time ago.”
“Draco, you look like you’re about to explode,” Harry said worriedly, because even though Draco was now grinning a little manically, he was still shaking so hard Harry could hear the old box spring rattling. Draco giggled, then slapped a hand over his mouth.
because every curse had a purpose, and this arsehole had to have some sort of motive, other than inconveniencing Harry with muteness. It certainly sounded that way, with their prophetic rambling. This section was filled with half-thought-out scribbles, like
“Quite,” Lucius replied vaguely. He turned around, walking towards a long bench on the side of the room, picking up a small, glass vial from a shelf. It was empty.
Weasley’s hands quickly rose again in that surrendering gesture. “Mate, it’s not like that. He won’t be assaulting your mind and asking you to defend it with no real instruction. He’s a Healer, he’s a professional. People wouldn’t be raving about his work if it was torture, alright?”
three-piece suit. Draco was just going to pretend the staring was because he looked fantastic, and not because of—all the rest, the things that were making his stomach churn. Thank Merlin for the confidence of an excellent, snug-fitting suit.
He walked Draco over to a large, metal chair, with chains dangling from the back and arms. It looked exactly like the chair on the floor of Courtroom Ten, and he shut his eyes against the image, bracing himself against the chains that bound him the moment he was sat down. It wasn’t necessary, with Lucius’ wand aimed resolutely at Draco’s head. Lucius was pulling the strings, and Draco was powerless to do anything but go along with it.
Once past the front gate, Draco turned around, raised his hand and wand, and proceeded to cast some of the most beautiful wards Harry had ever seen, chanting softly in Latin, his eyes closed in concentration.
Draco watched him for several minutes, studying him, memorizing every detail, in case this was some sort of trick his mind was playing on him. Harry’s wide, black curls were sticking up wildly, as if he’d been running his hands through them incessantly. He was still wearing his navy Auror uniform, which was cleaner than Draco would have expected, perhaps Timsy’s doing, and the top three gold buttons at his throat were left undone. When Harry tilted his head a little, eyes fixed on Draco’s hand, Draco could see the harsh, deep purple bruises, in a ring around his neck, the horrific impressions of Draco’s fingers on his copper skin. Draco’s vision blurred, and he unconsciously squeezed Harry’s wandering fingers in his hand.
hard to continue pretending that he had started this nonsense just to prove a point, but it was becoming clearer he’d only been looking for an excuse to touch Harry, as Harry was moving closer to him, held near by Draco’s hand on his waist, by Harry’s grip on his shoulder. They were so close that their chests were nearly touching, and Draco could feel Harry’s hair tickling his cheek, and he was so
Harry stared back at him for a moment, gripping his mug tightly, before looking away, lifting his shoulders in a tiny shrug.
He looked in the shabby mirror in the loo of his Prague bed and breakfast, at his sunken eyes and shadowy stubble. He looked angry, dangerous. Violent.
“Do you like falafel?” Draco asks, surprising himself with how clear his words are. He almost sounds sober
Harry beckoned to Parkinson and Timsy, once they’d been given the secret. He was glad that no one was questioning their presence anymore. He knew he shouldn’t be bringing them into danger, endangering more of Draco’s family—but he also knew what they were feeling. He wouldn’t have been able to stop them from coming to Draco’s aid, just as no one would have been able to stop
“Anyway,” Draco said firmly, “point is, you can move past your suspicion of me. I had nothing to do with it, which Harry himself can vouch for. It’s even likely that someone wanted to frame me for it, knowing that no one would refute the accusation. It would be so easy.”
“I think, erm… well, it’s just that…” Ron began, his lips twitching as well as Harry turned to grin at him, watching him suppress a giggle. “You used to tease Harry relentlessly about his glasses…”
the Death Eaters had called him, leering and snickering at him. No wonder Harry had begged the Hat to sort him anywhere but Slytherin.
“I know you’re wondering, and yes, Draco, you did look just like that when you were showing off your manners at that age,” she smirked at him.
you do?” Draco raised an eyebrow at him. His tea was going to get cold, if he kept ignoring it, Harry thought to himself. He opened his mouth to answer, and choked, a little—he’d forgotten about his contract. Of course, he was magically forbidden to answer that question. He physically couldn’t.
Are you on a binge rn? It's three am and you don't know how so much time has passed and you have work in the morning? This is a good place to take a break, fam, get some water, sleep, food, whatever. <3
“I need the prophecy concerning Harry Potter,” Harry said aloud, feeling like an idiot, but the shelves did respond, and everyone jolted backward in alarm, braced to run. The adrenaline and movement was only spurring on more flashbacks, flashes of curses and the voices of hundreds of Seers, shards of shelving and glass thundering down on them—
Harry couldn’t tell if Narcissa was uncomfortable being at Willem’s, or uncomfortable because of her out-of-practice physical existence, but something wasn’t right. He kept asking her, every day, “
He wanted to know what Draco wrote about, what he dreamed about; he wanted to know everything about him. He wanted to kiss Draco whenever he wanted, and he wanted Draco to be happy, but he didn’t
They landed outside the imposing gates of the Manor, under another bright, snowy sky. Draco waved his wand to open the gates; the shimmering wards wavered to let them through.
The closer he got to his destination, the friendlier—or at least less hateful—the staff became. The Curse Damage and Dark Arts Reversal wards were the most familiar with him, and had seen for themselves the extent of his skill. It was a breath of fresh air, being around people who at least trusted him not to hurt them. He hoped that wouldn’t change once he reached Potter’s room.
He spun slowly, taking it all in once again. He didn’t think he’d ever been assigned to observe something so
‘Mione,” Ron replied vehemently. Hermione searched his face, as if that would provide a better answer.
“That’s not the face I imagined you making while listening to your secret lover’s mixtape, I’ll be honest,” Pansy said suddenly from the open doorway, and Draco started violently, nearly dropping the broom in his lap.
Harry gaped at the shimmering, glowing bird for ages, imagining that he could smell the sea salt, the cool eucalyptus. He pretended he could feel the sea breeze it brought on its wings, its silvery glow that of sunlit clouds, of Draco’s eyes.
Harry listened intently, his face caught somewhere between rage and determination. Draco recognized that look from school, and knew he wanted to fight someone, right now. Draco hoped it wasn’t him, that Harry would give him the chance to take the potion and tell the whole truth. But he’d understand if he didn’t. The trust between them was still so new, and so fragile, and it was already being tested.
Draco looked back at Lucius’ unconscious body, wondering if he’d be able to set him on fire wandlessly, when Lucius was suddenly wrapped up tightly with thick cords conjured from the air. Draco snapped his head around, causing a wave of dizziness, and saw Harry lowering his wand, still laying on the floor, gasping for breath beneath him, safe, alive,
filled the room, and Draco sighed, relaxing deeper into the couch, his legs crossed at the ankle. His soup was long finished. Harry held up an album of Doris Day’s Greatest Hits, another question in his eyes.
Harry gave him a quick nod and grabbed his notebook. Draco took inventory of himself, touching his thighs, his collarbone, his arm, his hair, over and over. Harry tried not to watch, but he was so bloody distracting.
Draco was able to sleep after that, but it was fitful and shallow, his dreams marred with flashes of green eyes pleading from a swollen face, of a warm body against his chest and fiendfyre at his back, of blood in the water on the floor of a flooded bathroom.
“I love him,” the truth flew out of Draco’s mouth, and he flinched with the abruptness of it, feeling like he’d been slapped. All those years of precious denial, all that work in shoving it away, gone in less than a second. He loved Harry, he’d loved him for way too long, and Pansy had been right, as always. A wash of sweet relief mixed with the painful loss of denial, conflicting him. He wanted to cry, but he wouldn’t.
in fact, were my biggest obstacle—that you were going to have something I did not, and with it, become more powerful than I ever was.”
He paused on entering, realizing the room was still in disarray from his fevered research the night before. He waved his wand in a slow arc in front of him, and the books and scrolls steadily put themselves away, leaving his study looking immaculate once more. He went to the windows and drew the curtains, letting in the bright morning sun. The walls were covered in bookshelves, holding a wide array of tomes and medical texts and curious—and relatively benign—magical artifacts. Plants stood in every corner and on the shelves that received the best sunlight.
Harry swallowed hard, turning his face into Draco’s palm. Draco set down his tea, sensing Harry’s unease. His expression was more open than it was for anyone else, tender and concerned; this expression was for Harry, alone. Harry’s heart clenched, holding on to Draco’s attention like a priceless treasure.
was happening. He knew his bonds had been removed, which his father had sneered at—with or without the bonds, Lucius still had complete control of him. But the bonds could only have been severed with Kingsley around, and Kingsley would only have done that under
“You know you’re safe here,” he reminded Harry. “I won’t pass judgement on you, and nothing in there can hurt you now. If it gets to be too much, if I feel your body responding in panic or shock or anything else dangerous, I pull us out. If you need me out before then, snap your fingers. I’ll hear it.”
He shook his head frantically, hoping the potion would accept that, but he could feel the words bubbling up his throat. “I dreamed I was in my bed, naked, with a man curled behind me. It was morning, we were waking up, he was stroking my sides, intertwining our fingers, pulling me closer to him. I could feel the warmth of his chest against my back and his erection against my arse—” Draco groaned, now, because he was reciting a fantasy to a patient, which was apparently quite unethical, according to the harsh, painful
“I’m going to fix it, Harry,” Kingsley said firmly, setting his jaw. “I’m going to take back my Ministry, and I won’t stop until Draco is safe, Lucius is locked up for good, and every single Unspeakable is accounted for.”
“So that’s apparently the only sound you can make from your mouth,” he chuckled quietly. “What will the papers say? ‘Chosen One Chooses New Calling: Professional Whistling Pantomime...’”
“Come along, then,” Malfoy said, affecting his voice with unnatural cheeriness as he reached the bottom of the stairs. He clasped his hands behind his back and walked leisurely through the foyer, not waiting for Harry to follow. “Malfoy Manor was built over ten centuries ago by Armand Malfoy, who arrived here from France with William the Conqueror…”
Draco expected more questions. He expected magical handcuffs for no reason other than Harry could. He even hoped Harry would just let him go sleep it off. He didn’t expect Harry to lean over and gently pull Draco’s hands away from his waist, curling his palms over the inside of Draco’s wrists, his index fingers pointing up his forearms, inside his shirt cuffs. Draco could feel Harry’s fingers grazing the bottom of the Mark on his left arm, and he was too shocked to do anything but stare. His body was sweating and twitching through the effects of the potion—he knew the convulsions would start soon, he’d probably be incapacitated for the rest of the day.
, though, of Draco’s slender fingers tense around the thick osprey feather, of his sleek, white-blond hair falling into his face, of his full bottom lip pulled between his teeth, of the small crease of concentration between his pale brows.
Harry is nearly bowled over by the strength of emotion in his chest, as the door to the Burrow swings shut behind him with a soft
would make Draco act so foolishly, throwing his self-preservation out the window. Draco would only have to move an inch, just an inch, he thought, as Harry’s hand on the back of his neck slowly slid up into his hair, Harry’s nose was gradually shifting against Draco’s cheek, Harry’s forehead eventually resting against his, and Draco’s gut was twisting horribly, and that pulling, tightening ache in his chest was making his breathing shallow, but he could feel the soft puffs of Harry’s breath against his mouth—
“Yes, someone cursed him, but it was quite bizarre, I was unable to figure out a motive… Might have been a fan that lost the plot. The person was… indecipherable. I could not make out a single defining feature at all, it was charm work like I’ve never seen.” Malfoy paused, eyes darting to Harry, and Harry hoped he’d leave out the depressing and embarrassing bits in his retelling. Thankfully, he did.
“Please tell the nearest mediwix we need chocolate in 306,” Malfoy said, and the small bird turned and sailed out of the room.
Harry closed his eyes, his body only partially relaxed, his pen flicking in his restless fingers. He leaned back in his chair, and slightly furrowed his brow. Draco had a moment of envy—how could Harry exude power and authority like that, just from
and Draco couldn’t let him have the last word before he left, though it felt like Harry had it, anyway, with that unexpected wink.
As he neared the entrance to the conservatory, he saw that the door was cracked open, and he could hear multiple voices beyond it. Draco inhaled sharply—he had
“Hmm,” Draco sighed, wondering how to explain this. He propped his chin in his hand, idly tapping his finger against his cheek.
He tried to get a lift by himself, but a couple people squeezed in at the last minute. It took them a few floors before they realized who they were riding a lift with, and one of them got out on the next floor—Draco had heard him talking about Level Eight, there was no need to get off on Four. But the other passenger remained, an older woman who kept her lips pursed tightly together in disapproval—at what? Draco himself, or his muggle attire? He’d never know. She kept her hand on her wand the whole time, and got off on Level Eight, looking back once in confusion and suspicion when she realized he was staying on to the last Level.
Hermione made an impatient sound as she rolled her eyes. She marched right over to the table and sat down, surveying their mess of notes and maps. She dropped her law school bag on the floor with a loud
“There’s got to be…” Draco mumbled, his own emotions carefully tucked away. “Aha.” This memory was small, almost irrelevant, but the glow was definitely there.
Draco’s face was flushed, full of wonder and awe and something else Harry couldn’t read, his shining grey eyes fixed intently on Harry.
“Seven pieces…” Draco mumbled aloud. He loosened his grip on his hair, looking up at Harry, who looked anxious and in pain. “He ripped his soul into seven pieces…?”
Harry looked at Ron, who was looking back at him as if he had come to the same conclusion. Ron lowered his wand and stepped back.
muggle shows? Rebelling against pureblood society was understandable, but resorting to children’s entertainment from the
The room was quiet as they digested the information. Harry was remembering Malfoy’s first spell, his quiet entrance into Harry’s head, that odd, calming, smoky scent. It was familiar, somehow, but he couldn’t quite place it. He continued watching Malfoy, taking in his features, hoping his recent—situation—gave him enough of an excuse to stare at him unabashedly. He was going to, anyway.
Draco refilled his coffee cup and stood up, stretching out his long limbs and trying to breathe life and energy into himself. He’d gone for a “casual elite” look today, with dark grey muggle trousers, warm brown Oxfords and a white button-up shirt, with the top button left undone. He was in his home, after all, and he knew for a fact that Potter wouldn’t be showing up in his finest, either. If he showed up at all.
And when he showed up three minutes late, no one would suspect he had been standing in his house, eyes glued to his watch, for the past half hour, determining the exact moment his arrival would be appropriate—not insultingly late, but not right on time as if he’d been itching to go, either (even though he definitely had been). He palmed his wand, and disapparated to the coordinates Weasley had given him.
This particular trick was his worst yet. Worse than dressing up as a Dementor. Worse than calling out of a game and driving Harry insane with suspicion
Draco glanced up from the file to find all three members of the Golden Trio staring at him in utter shock. This time, he could not suppress his eye roll as he clicked his tongue, annoyed. “What now?”
Draco’s eyebrows furrowed. “Is that what Severus did? That’s practically barbaric,” he muttered. It was what his dear psychotic Aunt Bellatrix did to teach
one, if I could help it.” He shot a fiery glare in Harry’s direction, which Harry thought was a little unfair. He hadn’t said a word. He thought he’d been rather polite, so far. He’d mostly just looked around and blushed.
“Of course,” Harry mumbled, “extra mayo and mustard, no tomatoes, as always.” It was actually the standard amount of mayo and mustard, and Harry had just plucked the tomatoes to insert into his own sandwich. As always. He hated bothering the canteen staff more than he had to, or being in there longer than he had to. Merlin, the
But Harry only intensified his eye contact, and started to breathe—in through his nose for four, hold for two, out through his mouth for four. Somewhere in Draco’s brain, that sounded like a good idea, so he tried to mirror it. His breaths were shaky and hard, and it felt unnatural, but he focused on the feeling of Harry’s hands on his arms, and breathed.
It wasn’t always easy, or comfortable. Some days, Draco withdrew, growing defensive and agitated. Harry knew it was with fear that Harry would leave again, and anger at himself for trusting again—which was an understandable consequence Harry had endless patience for.
“Let me explain my theory to you, first, and when I’m finished, I’ll take the Veritaserum and answer any questions you have. I told you I’ll always give you full honesty, and you should trust that, but in this case, I thought you might appreciate the extra failsafe.”
Draco felt like Harry was seeing right through him. With a jolt, Draco realized he had also just described his own experiences in sixth and seventh year—
Flick. On and on it went. Anyone who actually showed interest in Harry’s life was funneled efficiently out of his head and into the vial. Any repeating faces, as well, even though the attacker would probably have remained disguised. Anyone who mentioned anything about knowing him, or not knowing him, or how much he hid from them. He tried to listen for vocal inflections he might recognize from the attacker, but he figured they’d have masked their voice as well.
Draco sat at his kitchen table, eating Timsy’s perfectly cooked bacon and eggs and buttered toast, his mind practically vibrating with eagerness to get started on this particular puzzle.
“N—” The potion stopped him again, apparently he did know a prophecy about Harry. “Yes,” he tried. “I know there was a prophecy that named you as the one who could kill Voldemort, but I don’t know exactly what it said. I don’t know of any others.”
Draco came back to himself, performing his normal routine, rubbing his thighs, his hair, looking at his fingers, feeling the scar, touching his left arm. When he opened his eyes, Harry was already writing.
Draco unwrapped his arms to cradle Harry’s face in his hands. Harry was hit with his fierce gaze again, and he could see the hurt and resentment in it, still—but it looked more like protectiveness, this time.
It could have easily looked a mess, and led to a ramshackle hut that housed an eccentric old wizard who wore only animal skins. It
Draco looked up after a moment, seeing Harry’s notebook facing him. Harry delighted in the small, tired smile it produced on his face.
In actuality, Malfoy’s garden was modest and overgrown, the rich earth mostly left alone to bloom however it wished. And it wished
“Enough of that,” Harry grumbled, rolling onto the dry side of the bed. “Don’t watch if you’re going to feel bad about it.”
“Well, I’ve good news for you, lad,” Kramer replied with an easy grin. “We’re looking for someone who is eager to simply
“Irritating,” Draco supplied. He sat up further, rubbed his eyes, combed a hand through his hair. “Worrisome. Perplexing.”
That sounded pretty fucking ominous, but it also sounded like Harry catching a bit of a break, for once. The whole thing was so utterly vague, so incomplete, but someone had surmised
“Minister,” Draco greeted. Shacklebolt looked up from his desk, a barely concealed look of surprise on his face.
The curse was painless, yes, but he really did need it fixed, ASAP. He couldn’t work without a voice, and though he could do quite a bit of nonverbal magic, he wasn’t able to use the full strength of it without incantations. Kingsley needed him for endorsements, too, and the anniversary of the Battle was coming up, Harry was always forced to go to the Ministry Memorial event and make a stupid speech. So the Healers had insisted that it was a job for the Specialist in Mind Curses and Afflictions, who worked privately, and whom Ron had set out to recruit that morning while Harry slept, apparently.
Harry’s head snapped up to look at him, as if he had just remembered Draco was there. He shook his head hastily, removing his hand from his face.
“If mornings would stop being so horrible to endure, I might be happier to see them,” Draco retorted. He set down his coffee mug and started in on his breakfast.
“It’s alright,” Draco said, his own emotions tucked carefully away to deal with later. “Let them come, let them drift. I’m going to add more power, see if you can pick out my presence.” He concentrated, and felt more energy flow through his wrist. Harry gasped softly.
“You’re an idiot,” Draco snapped, glaring, because manners were a privilege Harry had once gained and had since lost. Weightless snowflakes sparkled in his plait of almost-white hair, glowing in the sconcelight of Harry’s doorstep.
Draco reached across the ornately wrought table, and carefully took his mother’s hand in his, holding it gently. Narcissa managed a soft smile, but her eyes were wet.
Malfoy shook his head, stepping a little closer. “I think the correct term is ‘unfinished business.’”
spell, to see the danger, but Harry was focused entirely on him, searching his face, eyes landing on the bruise on his cheek, the blood that had dripped onto his shirt. He lowered his wand, and inside his head, Draco was screaming.
Teddy’s birthday was the perfect excuse to guilt Draco into coming, since he’d met Teddy once before, and they were cousins. Draco cherished what little family he had left, more than anything.
Draco said nothing, of course. His bonds wouldn’t allow it, and she knew that. At his obvious silence, Pansy groaned in exasperation.
“Not now, Ron,” Hermione interrupted, horror transforming to determination on her face as she laid her hand on Ron’s forearm. “Did you know the last day was your last day?”
He watched the curls of his hair above his forehead, he watched the breath coming in and out of Harry’s straight nose. He watched Harry’s shoulders tense, barely, with the effort of moving his magic like this, he breathed the smell of rain and ozone in the air around them, until finally, Harry released his wrists, and opened his eyes.
“Yes, she’s a Slytherin, through and through. She knew that. She knew everything, apparently.” Draco took a step towards him. Harry took a step back, because Draco still looked angry, and Harry was confused, and he didn’t want to touch him if he didn’t want to be touched. “So she showed you the secret, and gave you what you’d need to fix it, and helped you traipse around Europe to fulfill her impossible plans.”
Draco was breathing heavily, carefully hiding his emotions with whatever Occlumency he could muster, which wasn’t much. Lucius’ eyes were still wide, at once fearful and gleeful, the tip of his wand inches from Draco’s throat.
“I’ve been thinking, and I’ve come up with a possible theory about your attacker, one that honestly frightens me, and that I’m pretty sure you’re not going to like,” Draco said, watching him anxiously. Harry tried to remain calm. Why would it frighten
Full prompt: Harry expects Draco to wuss out on spicy food. Draco just meditates his way through eating it. Harry thinks that's kind of messed up.
They stopped in front of Narcissa’s room, peering through the small window in the door. Draco’s breath hitched the moment he saw her, fragile and pale and unconscious in the hospital bed. He seemed frozen, his jaw clenched and tense, unable to move any further.
Draco growled with frustration, then sagged as more sobs broke from his chest. He tossed the journal onto the bed and balled his fist around his wand.
It couldn’t last, though. It was late, and Harry felt bad leaving Draco here alone, even though it was technically his house.
“Isn’t this against about a thousand protocols?” Draco asked, his lips curled in a sneer. Harry brightened at the sight of it, fully prepared to let it shove him back into
The cold, forceful winds disoriented him upon landing, the dark sky as heavy and grey as his Unspeakable robes. Frigid rain pelted his face, cutting a chill through his cloak, down to his very bones.
Draco was obviously losing blood flow to his brain, if he was spouting nonsense like this that made Harry’s stomach flip. They’d never even liked each other, and barely tolerated each other now. Harry had probably misheard him, or something.
Potter’s mouth was pressed in a thin line. He motioned for his notebook again, scribbling something with agitation before flipping it around to face Draco again.
“Agreed,” Ron replied. “That’s probably why he wrote 9. That may also mean Unspeakables are involved, as he’d also thought, which means Lucius has access to Level Nine.” He frowned at the paper in his hand. “Do you think he’s trying to say,
and she wasn’t sneering at him, or attacking him, or serving him up to the Dark Lord. He felt a little spark of hope in his chest.
Narcissa nodded shortly. “I know the chances of you hearing from him are slim, but if you do, will you…?” She trailed off, subtly wiping the corner of her eye, and Draco was slightly stunned by how disjointed she seemed, when she was normally so cool and collected.
“I just need the Hall of Prophecy,” he muttered, and the walls suddenly stopped, a door in front of him opening wide onto another dark room. Draco shrugged to himself. It made sense that the Department of Mysteries would keep their entryway as off-putting and dramatic as possible. Most people probably didn’t bother to just ask for what they needed.
He was mildly successful in that he only busted one hinge, but that was an easy fix. For someone else.
Draco stuck the index finger of his right hand inside the collar of his shirt and idly traced the scar there. He was determined to keep his wits about him, today—they were literally reliving a war, and he knew Harry had endured the absolute worst of it. He wanted to be strong, for Harry. He wanted to be something Harry could lean on. Draco refused to fall apart under his own emotions, this time.
Draco grabbed his own notebook off the table, squinted at it, then huffed and held out his hand, wandlessly summoning his reading glasses from where he’d left them on his desk. He placed them on his nose and picked up his pen, making his notes, allowing his emotions: victory at Harry’s attack on the Carrow brother, curiosity at the odd, magical map.
Their wand raised again, and Harry felt both himself and Malfoy thrown back into reality. He heard Malfoy’s gasp, and his vision returned to see him flexing his fingers, examining them, touching his hair, touching his legs. As if it was simply something he had to do, making sure he was all there. He pulled a silk handkerchief from his pocket and quickly wiped his forehead with it, then absently handed it to Harry, who took it without thinking. Harry clutched it in his fist, unable to comprehend anything through the building panic and shock.
Harry felt a deep, coiled rage building slowly within him. He had started training long after Draco had been freed, and there’d been so much going on in those weeks right after the War… He knew the Aurors had spoken of the Malfoys viciously, always talking up different ways to bring them all down, even after Draco and Narcissa had been fully acquitted. Ron had weeded out as many of the dirty Aurors as he could, when he climbed the ranks—he and Harry had thought they’d seen it all. But Harry wanted to make absolutely sure those arseholes had been dealt with. Dismembered, hopefully.
“Yep,” Harry sighed. “I just—he’s always running his mouth, always insulting and belittling me, telling me I can’t get away with anything just because I’m the Saviour or whatever, as if I haven’t been working my arse off with bloody sixty-hour weeks—I was late by
Draco leaned against the counter, his arms crossed over his chest, his plait coming apart on his shoulder. He stayed quiet, watching with a pensive frown as Harry moved around the kitchen. Harry regretted not having a wireless in his kitchen, but he didn’t mind the silence so much. Draco’s silence was still better than Draco’s absence.
“Wait here,” Draco said, throwing Harry a wicked grin as he picked himself up off the blanket on the grass and quickly made his way to the shed. He opened the door, stepped inside, and grabbed the boombox from the low countertop, where it had been sitting for over a week. Harry lifted his head as Draco returned to the blanket, groaning as he caught sight of the muggle machine.
“This is Istanbul, Turkey,” Draco notes, feeling Harry’s awe all around him, “on the Wizarding side of the Grand Bazaar. I apprenticed here for a few months, under Healer Ekrem. I learned from all of my mentors, but Ekrem is the one who made me practice vulnerability, and explained the necessity of a balance between the patient and Healer Legilimens. I worked the hardest, under him, but spent a lot of time here, wandering the Bazaar—it always felt amazing, to be among a crowd where no one knew my name.”
to hide your voice—whatever potion they slipped you may have made your subconscious more suggestible. Either way, they made the command, but I’m pretty sure your own mind did the hiding, and considering how they went on about you being known for yourself and not your image, I believe your mind marked a trail of your most formative memories—the ones that shaped who you really are.”
Harry wondered if that was what Jesus actually looked like, when he’d emerged from the grave. Harry certainly hadn’t looked that proud or strong, the day Wizarding Britain had dubbed him
if he was watching Draco because someone told him to, or just because he wanted to, because he couldn’t look away. He didn’t know when the switch had been made, if it had ever been a switch at all.
Harry waited until the church went dark, its only lights that of the ornate, gilded spire, the Christ Triumphant illuminated at its peak.
The narcissus flowers were blooming again, as well as several other varieties of flora, and Harry grinned at the memory of Draco awkwardly carrying a bundle of blooms, with dirt on the knees of his expensive, pressed trousers.
Teddy, who couldn’t have been more than eight years old, handed over his prize dejectedly. His turquoise hair fell in soft waves around his face—a face quite similar to Professor Lupin’s, Draco noticed. His knees and hands were covered in dirt.
Harry started to nod, but stopped himself, as if he had just remembered something. The colour drained from his face. He grabbed his notebook, writing again.
Malfoy floundered for a moment while Harry regarded the shrubs and flowers growing by the door, probably with magical assistance, considering the season. Roses, Harry thought, climbing a trestle against the house. They were dark and dormant, tangled amongst the wood and stone, patiently waiting for spring.
Draco snorted and rubbed the heels of his hands across his eyes, trying to push his tears back in by sheer force of willpower. There was a soft whisper of breath across his hair and then a kiss pressed to his forehead, impossibly tender.
Narcissa continued to follow him around, watching him drag up the magic of Copenhagen, pulling it like threads through the concrete—luring it along the Nyhavn River, scraping it off the sides of the pastel buildings.
“I need the Hall of Prophecy,” Ron said, because they had to start somewhere, but the doors did not move. Ron walked to the nearest one and pulled, but it was locked. He moved to the next, but that was locked too. He tried every door, but they were all locked, barring them entry. Harry guessed that was to be expected.
Memories of the War and the Battle hung heavily around Harry, as they always did on this day, seeming more real and more terrifying in the company of those who had been there with him. But whenever Harry felt himself starting to drift away, he’d feel a warm pressure against his leg—Draco’s hand, resting on his thigh, or his knee, pressing gently into Harry’s, bringing him back to the here and now. He never drew attention to himself, but Harry’s friends were shrewd, and caught the movement every time, shooting Harry knowing glances. Harry assumed they were going through the same thing—which is probably why they’d brought Rose, in the first place. Rose was their symbol of post-war peace, of moving on, their love and joy made manifest. It was impossible for them to get stuck in the past with her around.
“Because I wanted to,” the words flew out of Draco’s mouth. “Because I knew I should, as a Healer, because I owe you a life debt, because I was curious, because I wanted the challenge, because I wanted the opportunity to really get to know you, after I mucked up so many chances, and for you to see me as the man I’ve become.” Draco gasped for breath. That was exactly what he had said previously, when Harry had asked. He’d actually told Harry the full truth, the first time.
He grabbed his black silk dressing gown from the bedpost as he stomped out to the hall to make his way to his front door, forgoing his suede house slippers for the sake of efficiency, muttering obscenities the entire time. Timsy, his house elf, watched warily from behind the doorway to the kitchen, clutching nervously at the sleeves of his little green jumper. Timsy knew not to disturb Draco before nine in the morning on weekends, unless it was life or death.
Harry closed his eyes. He wanted to scream, he wanted to tell Ron everything Kramer had told him. He opened his mouth to try, even to say
The memory slid away, the silvery glow following it. Draco retreated out of Harry’s head, pointed his wand at the chalkboard, and labeled a new dot “Gossipy Hufflepuffs”, trying not to wrinkle his nose at it. The anti-Hufflepuff prejudice was a hard one to shake, and he never really knew why.
Harry berated himself for ever thinking this curse was easy. He was really going to have to endure Malfoy’s Legilimency for six bloody weeks.
Ron put his hands up in that appeasing gesture again. “Mate, it’s not like that. He won’t be assaulting your mind and asking you to defend it with no real instruction. He’s a Healer, he’s a professional. People wouldn’t be raving about his work if it was torture, alright?”
“Harry knows you’re here,” Ron muttered, eyebrows furrowed in confusion. “He’s been keeping us updated, as much as he can—which isn’t much, you must know he’s not much of a writer. But he told us to go ahead and get started, to not wait for him, since these are his own memories. He’s obviously seen them already, and is still clueless as to who cursed him.”
“Stop worrying, Harry,” Draco mumbled, his grin widening as Harry clearly snapped out of it. Harry had no idea how Draco knew him so well. “Yes, I’ll go on a bloody date with you, you complete idiot.”
Shacklebolt grabbed a small handful of floo powder out of a pouch in his pocket, stepped into the flames, called out “Minister Shacklebolt’s Office,” and was gone in a
That was unexpected. Didn’t Draco say he didn’t talk to muggles, because he was afraid of messing it up and getting arrested or something?
Harry huffed a weak laugh at him. When, exactly, had Draco’s insults started feeling more like endearments?
“Why was he angry the first time?” Hermione asked, nonchalantly taking a sip of her tea, and this was starting to feel more like an interrogation.
Not quite physically, but perhaps in every other way: the air shifted and charged, the memories began to glow even brighter with an overload of magic. The shelves started vibrating, filling the room with the noisy clattering of glass, while Kramer remained unaware, his head still submerged in the Pensieve.
Harry nodded, sitting forward in his chair. Draco wanted to look away from his eyes, sitting this close, but couldn’t, considering the eye contact was necessary for the work. Harry made him feel like he could do it wandlessly, if he wanted, with those bright green eyes piercing him so intently—all Draco would have to do is tip forward, just a little, and fall.
Draco shot him another unimpressed look. “Yes, six weeks, and that’s on the shorter end of the timeline. The mind is absolutely gargantuan, and we have to pay attention to every detail. If we’re keeping the analogy, we’re literally scouring the forest floor for breadcrumbs. You can’t rush through it, as missing a crumb or taking a wrong turn could set us back even farther. Plus, we have to recover any lost memories first.”
Full prompt: either Draco or Harry starts baking to cope after the war and it leads to them meeting again.
this, which only made Harry angrier. He shoved him again, harder, interrupting Malfoy’s cruel laugh.
Draco said nothing, his lips pressed together, his silver eyes shining and furious and heartbroken. Harry saw his chin quiver, his ink-smudged hand shake. He took another step forward; Draco’s face twisted with pain.
pair of slippers: some obnoxious fuzzy green monstrosities with a cartoonish face on them that Pansy had found at a muggle shop. The tag said “Oscar the Grouch”, which Draco had assumed was some muggle thing. Pansy had laughed and said the character on them was “fitting” for him, because he was grouchy and reclusive and “loved trash” which Draco took as the pointed barb it was on his taste in men. Apparently, her five-year-old daughter had seen the character on the “telly” and immediately thought of her godfather. Charming girl got her viciousness from her mother, clearly.
pocket, deliberately, with zero fanfare, as if it were just something that belonged in Harry’s pocket.
Harry dropped his wand and stepped back, glaring pointedly at Smith, gesturing towards the door to the tiny office. Smith glared back, rubbing the welt on his neck.
The other two Unspeakables had fled, and those were the two the Aurors were still tracking down. Harry didn’t think those two were any real threat—they’d seemed meek and uncomfortable in the memory he’d seen. But he still wanted them dragged before the Wizengamot and thrown in Azkaban for even entertaining the
give up the one boy who truly saw him, would not be able to survive if it was by his own hands, even though Lucius was pulling the strings.
“That is information I cannot provide, not because you don’t have clearance—which you don’t, by the way—but because I don’t know, myself. The Department of Mysteries is not under my jurisdiction. No one knows what those swots get up to except themselves. I’ve only been there once, in ‘96, with the Order, fighting Death Eaters. I didn’t understand a whit of what I saw, and we certainly didn’t run into any Unspeakables.”
The door closed behind them, throwing the empty common room into a tense silence. It took about seven seconds for Draco to break.
He was dressed impeccably, as per usual (the exception being this morning). He’d decided on his muggle charcoal three piece suit, because it was neutral, he’d thought, even though it didn’t look nearly as striking as the cobalt blue suit or the forest green robes, and he wore a pale blue shirt underneath his waistcoat. He couldn’t wear black, of course, that would seem ominous, and camel was far too relaxed, obviously, and the burgundy would seem
Weasley had his hands in his hair again, but seemed to heed the clear direction as he looked at Draco with blue eyes that Draco could only describe as pleading.
“Pansy Parkinson!” Draco yelled into Pansy’s sitting room from where his head floated in the fire. It was always uncomfortable, floo calling like this, on his knees in one place with his head halfway across the country. But he didn’t have time to properly visit her, and he had questions.
Draco turned around and started walking towards his bedroom, removing his jumper as he went. He caught a glimpse of the scars on his chest in the firelight before entering the darkened hallway—the chest that Harry had pulled against him, that had pressed Harry’s body into the tree.
“Don’t worry, Rose. I’ll investigate, and make sure that wherever Camila got them, they have them in your size.” Draco wiggled his feet goofily, but his tone was serious, as if this was a life or death mission. It was true—he would absolutely tear down the city of London to find this little witch some Oscar the Grouch slippers. Because he was a pathetically tender-hearted fool around children, and they always made him want to spend all of his money on silly things to make them happy. Maybe he was just excited that they weren’t growing up during a war, or that they weren’t being bred to carry on a mantle of political and social power, or that they didn’t lead angry mobs against him when he was still a teenager, or that they weren’t like him at all… kids these days were
and yet, here it was, Draco’s and his father’s names were on the tag, and his brain was working so fast he could hardly keep up. If his name was on the tag, that meant that action had been taken, events already set in motion, just like with the prophecy of the ‘Chosen One’, the tag had been edited after Voldemort had targeted
“I just don’t want to lose it,” Harry said. “I want to keep this. I never understood why anyone would want to live forever, but now—” he paused, looking up at Draco again, biting his lip. A bad habit of his. “—I think I get it.”
“Mine, then?” Draco clarified, and Potter nodded. Draco reached into his jacket pocket again and pulled out a card with his apparition coordinates, handing it over.
Draco might prefer the quill, still. But his birthday was in two days, and Harry liked the idea of Draco having something pretty and nice to remember him by.
“They’ll just have to be disappointed, this year,” Harry said, in that low, rough voice Draco was quickly reacquainting himself with. The corners of Harry’s lips turned up slightly as he watched Draco’s face, which was trying and failing to stifle a grin.
“I know,” Harry croaked. He pulled Draco in and wrapped his arms over his shoulders, pressing Draco’s face into his neck. Draco trembled violently in his hold. “I’ll find her, Draco.” He caught himself, and quickly corrected it. “We’ll find her. I promise.”
“He” sounded like a friend, or someone this person knew. If Harry believed his attacker knew Draco personally, Draco probably had a one-way ticket to Azkaban in the near future.
One of the hands released him, but returned shortly, tentatively, to his face, a rough palm on Draco’s cheek, careful fingers in Draco’s hair.
Draco sighed, and rubbed the tops of his thighs with his palms. “You’re right,” he said. “I wouldn’t’ve.”
“Let’s get you home,” Harry said, standing and pulling Draco up with him. Draco huffed, but didn’t protest, and let Harry lead him out of his own childhood home, out to the imposing front gates to apparate.
He hadn’t looked at Harry since—he held on tight, keeping his face carefully blank, but unable to hide the fierceness in his eyes.
for the first time: it had pulled Draco’s full, pink lips, seemingly without his knowledge, into something
“A few years ago, I asked Kingsley for a favour—a pretty big, long-term favour,” Harry said. “I offered him a favour in return. I, erm—“ he huffed in frustration, how was he supposed to say this? “—I became ‘political,’ for him, in return for that favour.”
so different from the first two, but Draco still loved it. He could definitely see why it was called a boombox now.
Harry grinned at him again, crossing his ankle over his knee. He looked so relaxed, here in Draco’s study, and Draco felt another moment of incredulity, at the surreality of that fact. His life had changed so drastically over the past couple of weeks, even though he was only doing his job—but he was doing that job with
Draco tried not to scoff. Easy for him to say, he wasn’t trained to save the day himself since he was
He approached the door and knocked twice. He felt a moment of envy, that Malfoy’s black front door looked anything but grim and ominous. The black door of Grimmauld Place looked actively unwelcoming, as if its purpose was to turn people away. Another black door haunted Harry’s nightmares, occasionally, a foreboding destination at the end of a long, tiled corridor, that Harry avoided in real life as much as he could.
Harry—because I’m familiar with your magic, I’ve known you for a long time, and because I’ve never known anyone with as much magical power as you. It’s quite intense,” Draco commented. “A bit intoxicating, if I don’t control my perceptivity—which I do, constantly.”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked softly. Harry blinked a few times, apparently coming out of a daze, and nodded, his hand lowering back down to his side. His face was still full of fear and concern—not a look Draco ever wanted him to have, in their sanctuary. Had Draco made him feel unsafe?
Draco huffed a weak laugh, trying to keep his face from looking too shocked. “Alright, Ron, Hermione,” he said, out loud, and this was so fucking weird, “please, call me Draco.”
Harry rolled his eyes, and simply pointed at Draco, apparently tired of writing for the moment, or unsure of the words.
Separate, smooth, over, then under, left, then right. Harry would chatter about his day, and Draco would listen, humming occasionally. He would corral the wild curls between his hands, gentling them, containing them in a gradually narrowing braid, letting the water droplets fall between his slender fingers. In perfect routine, Harry would hand him a thin elastic from his own wrist, and Draco would blink when he realized he was staring again, lost in the natural movement and flow of Harry’s hair, the phantom sensation of cold water rushing around his feet.
Hannah’s eyes widened in shock. Harry smiled weakly, his stomach fluttering with nerves, and left the room.
Patricia gave him a perfunctory smile from the secretary desk as he approached, signaling to Harry that Ron wasn’t busy.
Harry opened the door to find Narcissa and Hermione in deep intellectual discussion. They both smiled at the sight of them, hand in hand. Harry approached the bed with a sheepish grin.
be an assault on his mind? He turned to Ron, remembered he couldn’t bloody speak, and reached over to grab the blank parchment and quill a Healer had left there for him, quickly writing out his anger and shoving the parchment in Malfoy’s face.
“No matter what you see,” Harry said, raising his voice to be heard over the wind and waves, “you’re safe, alright? We won’t let you get hurt.”
Draco’s fingers tightened, and this time, Harry knew they could tie him down. He would happily be tethered to Draco like this, for the rest of their days.
Malfoy scribbled some more notes in his notebook. Right on cue, Hermione spoke up. It had only been a matter of time.
“Damn it, fuck off, would you?” Draco spat. He continued his incessant pacing. Harry took a step toward him.
Draco looked back at Potter, who seemed to be having trouble keeping up with his surroundings. He was still breathing too quickly, too shallow. “Potter, lie back down. Are you dizzy?” Potter just obeyed absently, his eyes still glassy, fixated on Draco. Draco adjusted the bed with a gentle flick of his wand, so that he wasn’t completely horizontal, and his feet were raised slightly. The mediwitch finally knocked twice, and came in holding a bar of Honeyduke’s Finest.
Harry leapt up and ran towards the door, hearing the quick footsteps of Parkinson and Timsy behind him. He yanked at the door, but it was locked.
But he would follow it, as far as he could. It was wider on the west end, the waters stronger and deeper and more chaotic, tumbling and careening down the hillside. He’d walk along the edge, his toes digging into the soft earth, crickets leaping out of his way, all the way to the east end. The creek narrowed gradually, the current gentling as it was corralled between smooth boulders and over the tempering bed of soft earth and small, round stones.
He reached the third floor landing and paused, seeing a soft, gold light coming from his bedroom, the door left partially open. He instantly pulled out his wand—he
When he finally reached Harry, he lay his hands hesitantly on Harry’s chest. Harry froze, his heart pounding against his ribs, as if trying to reach that simple touch.
Malfoy huffed. “Yes, yes, I was a prick, karma’s a bitch, and now I have to wear reading glasses at age twenty-five. Anything else we need to get out of the way before I can start working?” He asked, exasperated.
that got stuck with being Voldemort’s target… it gave you only one path forward, a grim one, at that…” Draco trailed off, frowning to himself as he looked back at Harry.
There was plenty of work left to do, plenty of danger left to confront, but Harry had never felt more hopeful about the future as he did in that moment. He couldn’t help thinking that this is what he hadn’t dared to hope for, when he decided to come back from Death: to be able to live in peace, to experience being loved, being known, without any of the fear and constant danger.
then, how do you think this will go?” Draco argued. “‘Welcome, people whom I used to bully relentlessly. Please, come sit in my garden, let us reminisce about the
Harry was shaking his head in that odd, almost-fond way of his, and his smile was growing. He scoffed and rolled his eyes, but the smile remained, as did the colour on his cheeks.
“If that’s all, Unspeakable Potter…” Kramer raised an eyebrow, dismissing him with a wave and a smile.
“In the moments after you killed Voldemort, sitting in the Great Hall, before the Aurors came for us.”
Timsy reappeared with a tray laden with coffee, fixings, biscuits, and chocolate, and laid it on the side table between them. It looked heavenly, even though Draco had just eaten and had already had two cups of Timsy’s delectable coffee. He restrained himself to a glass of water, knowing if he had more coffee now his hands would start to shake.
“Healer Draco Malfoy, gathering information.” Yes, that was good. Vague enough. Definitely suspicious, but not enough to be arrested on site. Probably.
“Aurors. Licensers. Wizengamot. Harry, this isn’t—” —important, he wanted to say, but apparently that wasn’t true, and he couldn’t force the word from his lips. Harry continued writing, and at this point, the notebook was always faced where Draco could read it, as Harry wrote, sitting awkwardly crooked on his chair.
Harry closed his fist over the key and put it back in his pocket. He’d have to find a safer way to hold on to it. He marched to the Pensieve Room, filled with renewed determination.
The breeze ended, and Harry swayed in his own body. He could hear Malfoy’s laboured breathing, and assumed he was enduring the same thing. He felt a disconnect now, something had changed. Memory-Harry’s mouth opened to say something, but no noise came forth. Harry’s panic was rising. The figure continued to gaze at Harry with their ever-changing features, and Harry wanted to just hit them or something, or at least figure out who the hell they were, but the charm work on them was insane. They were completely imperceptible.
Draco jerked, wrinkling his nose with an unfortunately adorable sniff. Harry watched the crease of confusion and annoyance form on his brow, his sleepy eyes opening to squint at Harry. Draco lifted his head, and Harry pressed his lips together to control his expression at seeing impressions of ink script on his cheek.
He grabbed Parkinson’s arm to stop her from moving forward. The temptation to listen, to follow those whispers, to see the people he’d loved, was almost overwhelming, but he’d been through this before.
The figure spoke with conviction, and Harry felt a breeze pass through his head. Wait, was that an incantation? Did he just
The haze in his brain was clearing as the pain slowly subsided, and he realized he could not remember who had kissed who first, who had started that at all. Draco had started it with the dancing, which was unethical in the first place, but they had moved closer simultaneously, Harry’s hand had definitely moved to his hair, Draco’s nose had moved to Harry’s ear—
Camila eventually became restless, making her way to the sofa to crawl all over her godfather’s lap. He effortlessly flipped and rolled her around, playfully shouting, “Is this comfortable for you, love? I only want you to be comfortable!” as she shrieked with laughter. This was enough to tire her out for a nap, even though she begged “Again, Uncle Draco!” over and over until her head hit the pillow. It filled Draco with a quiet joy, as Camila always did.
Draco shook his head frantically, futilely trying to fight back the words. “I dreamed I was in my bed, naked, with a man curled behind me. It was morning, we were waking up, he was stroking my sides, intertwining our fingers, pulling me closer to him. I could feel the warmth of his chest against my back and his erection against my arse—” Draco groaned and doubled over, clutching his abdomen, his face twisted in pain. Was this a side effect of an overdose? Harry didn’t quite remember, but watching Draco, he thought he could now recall something about painful convulsions. “—but we weren’t fucking. We were just laying together, and his nose was in my hair and he was whispering something against my ear, and I don’t know who he was, but I knew that I loved him, and that he loved me. It’s not real. But the happiness I felt was, and it was enough to conjure a corporeal Patronus.”
He stood up from his desk, stuffing the last of the cold sandwich in his mouth and adjusting the leather wand holster on his thigh. He’d gotten used to carrying his wand in his pocket, again, and now the holster just felt constricting, uncomfortable. He walked down the long row of cubicles, towards the heavy, ornate wooden door of the Head Auror’s office.
Pansy eventually showed up, hair tied messily on the top of her head, clad in a fluffy dressing gown. “You interrupted my bath, you pillock,” she scowled at him. “What do you want?”
The soft, familiar scritching sound filled the room, only slightly different with the sharper, more expensive nib. Harry watched the words appear in Draco’s wake, in his favourite dark blue ink.
Harry looked at him as they approached the meeting place, smirking in amusement, and pursed his lips to whistle Celestina Warbeck’s
heard a prisoner of Azkaban referred to like that, especially from the people whose job it was to keep them in there.
Harry’s hands shook violently as they fumbled with the kettle. Water sloshed in the metal belly, and he winced as it made a clattering, clanking noise upon landing on the hob. Thankfully, he managed to ignite the flame on the first try.
Draco looked up, and sure enough, Bubo the eagle owl had silently appeared on a branch several feet above them, Draco’s whistling having alerted him to impending snacks. Bubo was watching them, patiently waiting for his turn, as always. He was a patient bird, but the one time Draco had forgotten to look up after feeding Hera, Bubo had dived down and landed violently on his shoulder, clearly enraged. He still had the scars. Draco never forgot again.
“My hands fall on my thighs frequently, so my legs are very familiar to me,” Draco explained, rubbing the tops of his thighs again. “I know inherently what my own hair feels like, that it is my own. I have a scar, on my collarbone, here,” he stuck his finger in his shirt again, but didn’t move the fabric, “and on my left arm is what’s left of the Dark Mark, something that’s very unlikely to be on anyone I’m healing, so I know I am me.”
“What are you writing?” Harry asked, for the fiftieth time. Draco looked up from his parchment at the kitchen table, his grey eyes dull with annoyance and fatigue.
There was a small clattering noise as the booth spit out a nametag in the coin return slot. Draco took it out and examined it as the floor of the booth lurched, and started descending into the ground.
“Aurors. Licensers. Wizengamot. Harry, this isn’t—” Draco’s voice was cut off. Whatever he’d been about to say was apparently untrue.
Potter’s eyes widened. His lips pressed together, his face turned grave. He nodded his head yes. Draco vaguely recalled something about the Hall of Prophecy being mentioned at the end of his fifth year, when his father was arrested, after apparently battling Potter and his friends in the Department of Mysteries. Draco shuddered at the thought of Lucius and Bellatrix, grown adult wizard and witch, side by side, pointing their wands at children for the favour of a bloodthirsty megalomaniac.
Draco’s hand shook as he tried to portion the tea, spilling a few leaves onto the counter. He dropped the spoon into the container with a frustrated huff.
When they got back to the study, Draco decided to be proactive and ask for hot chocolates in preparation for the work. Sixth year had been a shitshow, for him, and he knew it probably would have been for Harry, too. They’d probably need the extra comfort.
know the process of Conjuring a human being, and if they did, Harry almost couldn’t blame them for deciding against it. He couldn’t imagine anyone willingly going through this just for the sake of knowledge and experience. No one would do this except out of fierce, unstoppable love. Or a life debt. Or both.
Harry took a deep breath, long and slow, still embroiled in the staring contest. He nodded once, and Draco raised his wand, falling once more into Harry’s head.
“In the moments after you killed Voldemort, sitting in the Great Hall, before the Aurors came for us.”
“Harry, Dumbledore also said Love was the source of your strength, it was that power that defeated Voldemort multiple times. Has Love ever
Memory-Harry hummed, eyes half closed. Why wasn’t he cursing the shit out of this creep right now? What was he
“Retrieve Draco Malfoy’s Healer License, and remove the magical bonds from it,” Harry ordered, still trying to hold himself together. The more time that passed, the antsier he became. Draco was in danger, and he needed
Draco’s Occlumency barriers crashed, and he withdrew so quickly it probably left a vacuum in Harry’s head. He let out a harsh, shaky breath, and rubbed his face with his hands. His glasses immediately fell forwards; he ripped them off, tossing them carelessly onto the side table and closing his eyes. His emotions were storming again—fear, regret, anger, loss, pain—he tried his best to keep up.
“Nothing,” Harry replied, groaning in satisfaction as he bit into the purple macaron. Lavender and lemon, with a bit of… honey, maybe?
“S’alright, we’re so close.” Ron squeezed him hard, patting his back. “We have ‘em running, I just wanted to be absolutely sure—”
He closed his eyes, ignoring the rose that had appeared on the floor next to him. He felt the soothing sensation of a soft hand in his, and allowed her immaterial comfort, for both of their sakes.
Harry didn’t even know how to finish that, too stunned to think clearly. His little human brain was empty except for
He fell over in shock as the silence of the cliff was broken by loud, exuberant laughter. He hit the ground again, this time with an
to kiss Draco, just to see… he’d have probably kept going, pushed himself through the pain, it had been a
After a couple of minutes the heat was beginning to diminish, but Draco hadn’t taken his eyes off of Harry’s face. He just watched him, watched Harry frown in concentration, watched Harry use his outrageously powerful magic to
“Don’t worry, she made sure I knew just how boorish my attempts were,” Harry replied, mimicking Pansy’s posh, irritated tone, his cheeks flaming with embarrassment as Draco pressed play.
“Shit,” he muttered, running back to the door. Parkinson was pounding and yelling on the other side. He tried to push it open again, but it wouldn’t budge, even with another unlocking charm. He was torn—help them get through to follow him into danger, or go find Draco as soon as bloody possible?
Apparently satisfied with his checks, he handed the bottle back to Draco, who quickly went ahead and broke the wax seal, uncorked it, and dumped the entirety of its contents down his throat. It felt like viscous, lukewarm water in his mouth, and Draco could feel it taking effect immediately. He squeezed his eyes shut, hopelessly trying to stop it, but he felt high, now, and it only made him feel more sick, and more panicked. Merlin, he had never planned on using that potion on himself, he’d only thought it would be helpful for a cursed patient someday. He was astonished at himself, at the lengths he would go to for this
good kiss. That was Harry’s M.O., evidently, martyring himself like that, but never for something—or someone—he’d
Harry’s wand was in his hand and aimed before he could think about it. He couldn’t see a thing, but he could hear Kramer shifting on the floor, the tinkling sound of glass being brushed aside.
Draco flicked his left hand lazily, wandlessly dousing the candle on his bedside table, throwing the room into darkness, and filling it with the faint scent of candlesmoke.
Granger hesitated, darting glances around the room, before she gathered herself again, clearing her throat. “It’s not a very nice story. They sort of fall prey to a cannibalistic old witch with a house made of sweets, who fattens them up like pigs for slaughter. They end up murdering her with her own oven, and barely escaping with their lives.” She shuddered. “Gave me nightmares as a child. Not a good bedtime story.” She thought for a moment. “Also a terrible portrayal of magical people, but not entirely atypical for the muggle world, especially at the time it was written, in the middle ages.”
“Italy,” Draco smiled. “A small fishing village on The Amalfi Coast. My apprenticeship here was short, but I
He kissed his way up the column of Draco’s throat, over the scar that ran up to his jaw, feeling the vibrations of his own name in Draco’s voice under his lips. Draco clawed at his back, pulling him desperately closer, writhing beneath him. Harry peeled off Draco’s soft pyjamas in a hurry, his hands shaking violently. The sound Draco made when Harry finally put his mouth on him seared straight to Harry’s core.
“Harry,” Draco said, because he didn’t know what else to say, but he had to say something, to try to bring Harry back to the present, alleviate his hurt. Harry let out a shaky breath, still gripping Draco’s fingers tightly with his right hand, eyes intent on Draco’s face. His left hand reached into the back pocket of his jeans, pulled out a silk handkerchief, and handed it to Draco.
“Oh, fucking hell,” Harry breathed. He felt dread fill his stomach, tinged with someone else’s pride. He swallowed hard, wiped the tear tracks off his cheeks, and tried to steady his shaking hands.
“How’d you know it was me?” he asked, and she clicked her tongue as she glanced back at him, drawing her perfectly shaped brows together.
He didn’t protest when Harry offered to cook. Harry miraculously managed to keep himself from doing a gleeful little dance.
at you to see what I’d been hiding from them, and then they’d hide you, too. I don’t know any of them, any of what goes on down there. Neither of us wanted to risk your safety.”
particular memory—he pointed his wand at the chalkboard, and labeled the fresh dot “Dumbledore & Grindelwald” before turning back to check on Harry.
“Ready for one more?” he asked, raising his wand. He took a moment to build up his Occlumency defenses—he knew Lucius would make an appearance this year, and he refused to allow his own emotional turmoil to taint Harry’s already-too-intense memories.
This effectively snapped Draco back to the present, and he narrowed his eyes. “Not without a warrant, you may not.”
“Not too hard on the eyes, either,” Hermione chimed in softly, sending Harry a shrewd, mischievous look. Ron snapped his head around as Harry rolled his eyes, but he could feel himself blushing traitorously.
the figure probed, and Draco honestly could not figure out what their aim was. To understand Harry? To get him out of the way? To belittle him?
He woke a few hours later to a faint glow behind his eyelids, and opened them to find a Patronus at his bedside, watching him.

Weasley at least had the decency to look embarrassed. He cleared his throat awkwardly. “Erm… no, I suppose you can start in the afternoon, if that works. I just had to get to you early, the Healers said you were in very high demand, and probably booked, and this is obviously urgent…” He trailed off again, and Draco decided to put him out of his misery. It was true, he was booked, but that was irrelevant. He stood up, setting down his coffee cup and adjusting the belt of his dressing gown.
and led the way out of the shed, mounting the broom swiftly and kicking off into the air, Harry close behind.
The breeze ended, and Harry and Draco both swayed. He felt a disconnect now, something had changed. Harry’s mouth opened to say something, but no noise came forth. Harry’s panic was rising. The figure continued to gaze at Harry with their ever-changing features, and Draco had never seen someone so inconceivable. Were they even human?
“Just like old times, isn’t it?” Malfoy chuckled as Harry fisted the front of his robes and shoved him into the wall again. “Except for the part where I won, of course.”
Harry left for the Ministry once they’d all gathered back in the library of Malfoy Manor. Hermione sent him a worried look, but Draco wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“I’ll hang back,” Hermione said, “I’ve seen them all already.” She darted a glance at Harry. “Harry has too, obviously.”
Lucius whirled around, snarling, pointing the wand at Draco again, causing his muscles to seize up painfully with the force of it. “I have
“He’s bound… to the Licensers?” Harry clarified, to Hermione’s nod. Harry’s brain was suddenly whirring with activity, flashes of memory and conversation filling his head. His eyes widened. “He’s bound to the
It was still worth it, he thought, even if they never spoke to him again. He’d done the right thing, though it was the hardest fucking thing.
On the back, Draco found a list of songs with different artists he hadn’t heard of. He grinned widely, his face brightening with excitement as he looked back at Harry, who seemed pleased and abashed.
“So, I’ll be seeing you twice weekly for the next six weeks—Mondays and Thursdays, and full eight hour appointments. It’s not Legilimency the entire time—” Draco added, seeing Potter’s comically wide eyes, “—it’s a session in the morning, followed by rest and mapping out the progress, then another session in the afternoon. It’s irresponsible to do anything more frequent than that.”
Malfoy. This curse had been too easy to begin with, something had to give. Cruel fate took the form of a tall, lean,
“Yes. Friends can do this, too.” He climbed over Harry’s thighs, straddling him. Harry gasped a little and opened his eyes, staring at him in wonder. Draco’s heart was pounding. He was being reckless,
Draco settled himself in his chair, twirling his wand in his fingers, breathing deeply as he watched Harry meditate. He thought privately that the gentle, repetitive rise and fall of Harry’s shoulders was calming enough for him to forgo his own meditation. Instead, he brought up his Occlumency shields again, stuffing his emotions and reactions behind the big, wooden door in his mind, preparing himself for the work ahead.
