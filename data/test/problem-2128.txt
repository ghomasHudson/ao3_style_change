From the corner of his eyes, he peaks at others to realize that they think so too. Ron and Sirius are literally gaping at her, their mouth wide open.
"Draco." She whispered and the man finally noticed her presence. His eyes were dead when he looked at her.
Harry watches them apparate right in front of him and smiles at Draco and the Weasleys. He avoids Sirius's eyes entirely.
"You can't." This voice was much smaller. It belonged to William, her little brother. She turned around and he ran towards her. Jameson followed him with gritted teeth and angry eyes.
He glares at her. But Blaise bursts out laughing and Pansy's lips upturn into a mischievous smiles so he must look funny instead of terrifying.
Where Narcissa seems relieved, Lucius seems furious. Severus is quite unreadable and Albus is lost in his thoughts.
Harry listened to Draco's rant quietly. Draco was right. In the past, he might have shouted back at Draco but he did not say anything, choosing to accept his mistake instead.
He tried to open his eyes but they burned and his eye lids felt heavy so he closed them and then tried to open them slowly.
"I thought she would end up as a potions mistress Harry. I was totally stunned when she just left and married and that was that. We barely see her you know. She is there at the ministry balls with Nott and she smiles and all but it seems fake. She won't mock me, no matter how much I insult her and believe me, I tried."
"I will leave for Hogwarts." Narcissa murmurs, her voice blank as she gazes out of the window. Harry looks back at Snape and Sirius and murmurs, "Let's leave."
"You won't understand, would you. You have never gone through what I - we did so do not-" she was cut off Scorpius who muttered politely, "she won't want you to carry hatred in your heart."
"Password," the gargoyles said in a robotic voice, making Harriet wonder if they were just robots in disguise. Harriet removed her cloak.
He glared at her and said coldly "What do you need?" His voice must really have been cold because she literally staggered and stared at him "I just ne- need to talk to you about Harry."
"Lucius, tell him. He needs to know." It was Remus who said this. Lucius had been quiet for the past five minutes and Lucius looked at Remus, his eyes stunned.
Harry looked at him with eyes that were so soft that Draco had to avert his own from them. Harry had changed so much. He did not push Draco for anything and Draco was worried that Harry was burying his own emotions inside himself. He would have to find an opportunity to talk to harry about it.
The boy's parents - those filthy blood-traitors were just about to come to pick him up and he had decided to finally kill the boy today when no-one would expect it. When he saw the gate of the Dursley house open just a little, he started walking towards it. He was fortunate that the boy had decided to come outside before his parents had arrived. It would literally be so easy. An Avada Kedavra and that's it. The boy peaked outside, his entire body inside. Only his face was out. Expecting the kid to close the door and wait inside until his parents arrived, he sighed and leaned against the wall of another house, his wand in his right hand, ready to cast.
"This... as in?" He asks and she replies, "Helping me. Why are you helping me? I have never been civil to you. I have always mocked you."
Were they blind that they never saw the denial in eyes or deaf that they never heard his cries of pain and pleas of mercy?
Harry shakes his head. He can't say it. Telling them the truth would mean that he has accepted it. It would make it real. Harry doesn't want it to be real. It can't be real. How can Draco do this? Why should Harry be the one to live through this on the top of everything else. Everything else like being hated by his only living relatives and being hunted by Voldemort every year. It's not fair.
Draco turned his head to look at his thirteen year old son. Scorpius was trying hard not to stare at Ariana, Potter's middle daughter. Scorpius had proposed her a few months ago. Draco had chuckled inwardly when he was told about it. He wondered if Scorpius even knew the meaning of love. Nevertheless, he had sat both of them on front of him and had given them the talk. It was quite funny to watch them turn red and stutter that they did not want to talk about this. It was his responsibility, though because Ariana couldn't tell her parents and Astoria had given up on Scorpius when he was just a year old. Both Ariana and Scorpius were good at keeping secrets.
. As if having her family disappear and being pushed into marriage at the age of seventeen wasn't quite enough. Things were already complicated. This would only complicate them further. Knowing that she had nothing to say, Harriet only huffed in response and headed towards the door of the great hall. She walked slowly but made sure that she wasn't walking beside any of them. Maybe, she would not have to sit with those wretched Weasleys today.
"You're the boss. Whatever you say." Potter said blankly, "I'm an auror. You're supposed to give us orders, not ask for our opinions."
She can't forget anything but she can try to heal. She had thought that no-body cared enough but it turns out that Potter does and so do his best friends. It was a surprise really, the way Granger kept on owling muggle story books to her and Weasley tried to contact her via floo. She heard that Severus has not stepped out of his lab for the past week, not even to meet Sirius, his new best friend.
Harry must have because apparently it seemed that Harry was utterly mad for him. But there had to be other ways to express love. Why did Harry always have to be so reckless?
"May I know why you need to get out?" He asked and Harriet's face snapped to his. His face literally gave nothing away. She wished it would. She wished Snape was here so that at least he would tell something to her.
"What do you want, Draco?" Harry asked and Draco did not answer, so he pushed his fingers inside his pyjamas, waiting for the blonde to snap at him. The reaction that he got was opposite. Draco's trembling stopped.
"Harry, why are you not hugging me properly?" He whined and Harry slipped his hands inside Draco's shirt and rested them on his stomach, hugging him close to his body and Draco sighed in relief.
He stops mid-speech when Dudley comes running inside. He has reduced around twenty kgs since that incident with those ghastly dementors but he is still very fat. Where an year ago, it had not mattered to Vernon, it terrifies him now, especially when he looks at Harry.
"No, I will not tell anything to you." Draco snapped at him and Harry stayed quiet for a bit. They just looked at each other. Draco's eyes were angry and tortured and Harry's were soft. In the past, he might have gotten angry at Draco's tone but he could clearly see the torture Draco was undergoing.
"Mr. Potter." Draco says and Albus's eyes shoot at him. There is something in his voice that alarms Albus. He didn't see anything, did he? He couldn't have entered without letting Albus know. Maybe Albus is just very transparent because Draco's silver eyes are frozen on his face. They are unreadable and Albus can not understand them, no matter how much he wants to.
Finally, Harry looked at his chest and his chest had scars but Draco knew that Harry loved him, scars and all. Harry trailed his fingers from his neck to his chest and then traced his fingers over Draco's nipples. His fingers traced his belly and Draco couldn't control his face from sweating and his body from trembling all over. Harry's eyes jerked up to look into his and his fingers did not stop. They were mapping his chest and belly as if trying to remember them again. Draco was feeling uncomfortable but he did not want Harry to stop so when Harry asked him softly, tracing his nipples "Shall I stop?" Draco shook his head in denial.
Harry stands up and schools his features. He'll have to call Snape to heal Malfoy and take him away. The man's scent is enough to bring Harry to brink of loosing control and Harry knows that Malfoy will either drive him mad or be the reason of his own early demise. He leans against the wall and his fangs come out. He'll have to feed after Snape takes the man away although he had fed just day before yesterday. Damn Malfoy for coming out of nowhere and disturbing his life. Maybe he can convince Snape to let him feed.
"I WON'T SIGN THEM." Harry was losing his patience. He wanted to snatch the bloody papers and tear them into bits and pieces.
Hermione hugs him and Ron squeezes his shoulder before turning towards James and Lily. Harry's throat feels tight. He misses them as much.
Draco crossed his arms and glared at him defiantly "Ask her to leave. She has no right to interfere. Or maybe you still think that she does. You always did let them have a say in our matters."
A knock interrupted them and Draco wondered who would visit them. They had no visitors at all. It had to be Granger or weasley.
Potter casts sonorus on his throat and booms, "Lord Voldemort has been defeated. All the aurors and DA and the order members are requested to gather in the outer room."
Harry stopped and stared at Draco. His eyes watered and a sob wracked his whole body. A lone tear slid down his left cheek and he wondered why was it so hard to see Draco like this. Why did it feel that Harry was burning? Why did it seem so unbearable when he was not the one who had stepped under boiling water.
Harry walked beside Draco. Perhaps he was being over protective but Draco was not complaining and he needed to take care that Draco was not ignoring his own comfort so he asked "We could have taken appointment of another healer. I know that you are uncomfortable."
"I don't deserve you." His husband whispered and Harry snapped at him "Don't say this again. I love you and I can't live without you. That's that."
He had not been normal ever since. Draco had left with Granger and had not returned even once. News of his attempted suicide had reached his ears and the fact that Potter has rescued him also reached him.
The trick worked and Draco's embarrassed cleared. Draco nodded and they returned to their forgotten breakfast.
"No rush." This time it was Wealsey and Draco trembled "Take your time." Draco did not reply to that.
"Yes, Master Harry." The elf replied and he spoke "Help me on this wheel chair and take me to Draco's room.
"Hey, mister, can you give me some money?" Malfoy said suddenly and brought a hat from somewhere behind him and placed at Harry's feet before continuing politely, "Scorpius is hungry. He hasn't eaten anything for two days now and he has fever. I need medicines. Can you also tell me what medicines should I get him? I do not remember anything."
"I don't know Harry. One mind says that I must seek revenge and another says that I do not want any kind of disturbance ever. I can't live with the feeling that I was demeaned, that I was manipulated to satisfy someone's personal motives. I can't accept it but I do not want to confront my own sins. I simply- simply do not know what to do." Draco whispered and as it happened, fate decided for him.
"I- I wasn't-" Draco's voice broke and his complete body trembled. "I was not- raped. Please Harry."
Just before Scorpius leaves, the boy stops at the entryway and looks at him for a few moments. He doesn't say anything but his eyes speak a lot. Unlike Malfoy, who said many things and meant none of them, Scorpius is a man of few words.
Finally, finally he took a long breath and Harry's arms loosened around him. he noticed that his shirt was wet and looked up. Yes Harry's eyes were wet but he stood strongly in front of Draco. He was Draco's pillar of strength and when he looked into Draco's eyes and spoke "Are you all right Draco?" Draco nodded .
"Stay away from her Lucius. I warned you." Potter murmurs and Lucius backs off, his face drenched with crocodile tears. She stares at Severus who is looking at her with haunted eyes. He is not crying. He never does. Draco doesn't think he has cried ever since Lily Potter died.
"Noooo." The scream startled her so much that she shot up in her bed. Her right hand went underneath her pillow to get her wand and left went towards her scabbard that hung on the side of her bed to grab her sword.
They looked at each other, Draco looking angry and Harry looking sheepish. The silence was broken by Harry "So will you sleep in my room? I won't take any advantage-"
"Why are you doing this?" She asks because it's important for her to know it. She has to know his intentions.
He did not look at her while he replied, "No. But I had a feeling. He is still obsessed. I saw something flash in his eyes when I rejected him. He did not say anything but his eyes revealed many things."
"I know and I sympathize but that does not mean that Harry should waste his life over Malfoy. Ginny was good for him and she has married but there are lots of women who would want to marry him. He slapped me the other day and he is always shouting at me. You don't care at all that he slapped."
Finally, she stopped crying and pulled back a bit. She held his cheeks softly and kissed his forehead and Harry stared at her with wide eyes. He had never felt this-their was no name for the emotions he was going through. Aunt Petunia had never looked at him with love in her eyes. Never had he imagined that it would feel so good.
Harry with his red cheeks and sparkling green eyes and polite voice has this stern man wrapped around his little finger.
He sniffed and strong smell of medicines attacked him which led to the realisation that he was at St. Mungos. The voice of a throat being cleared attracted his attention and he twisted his head a little. His confusion transformed into shock when he came face to face with Hermione who was now wearing her gloves and coming towards him with a very blank face. Ron and Hermione had given up on him and vowed to never meet him again. He was jealous and had missed Draco and had lashed out on them. It was truly a surprise to see his old friend again and a very pleasant one at that. He had missed Ron and Hermione terribly.
"Let me speak. I was always jealous of your mum and a little angry as well. I love her and have always loved her. She was my small sister but then she was a witch and I wasn't and so I was jealous and I took it on you. It feels like Dudley and Tessa are paying for my sins. Mother had always said that children pay for their parents's sins and I am sorry Harry. I would like it if you stay in touch with me. Dudley told me that you had married some one named Draco. I would like to meet him as well. We are your family and I am not saying this so that you save Tessa. No. Please believe me when I tell you that I am sorry. I need you to know that I regret for not loving you when you were small and just wanted me to love you and be proud of you. I feel rotten and everything inside burns with shame. If I could, I will go back and murder Vernon in cold blood, but I can't and I am so sorry that you had such a rotten childhood because of me."
Petunia slumps on the couch, her eyes terrified as they fall on Vernon, "We haven't even thanked him properly yet. I - I will never be able to forgive myself if something happens to him."
"Please, stop drinking now." She said and sat on a chair beside his bed with her head in her hands. "I've sent so many letters to Draco. He doesn't reply. Even Ron tried to talk to him. He simply ignores us. "
"No- Not sex. But he was living in the manor. He was saving it for the last I guess. Maybe he knew what you felt for me." She completes her sentence.
Potter couldn't know. He couldn't. Not that he cares. Potter loves him. He would anyways protect Draco. Draco doesn't care. It doesn't matter. Except that it did matter and Draco did care. If only because he was a little afraid that Potter would refuse to protect him if he knew that Draco had been betraying him all along, that Draco had never loved him.
"Draco." It's her mother who is standing at the door quietly, her face dull and her eyes puffy and red-rimmed. It seems that mother didn't sleep at all last night.
Suddenly, she can't take it anymore. She wants him finished. So she does what comes to her mind. She whirls around and takes Potter's sword in her hands and cuts the bastard's head off.
"Yes. I am confused too. It doesn't make sense." Harry says, "Albus said that she is in trouble and she doesn't want to talk about it. She is afraid of something."
How does one react when the only person you have ever loved is naked and burning in front of you? What do you do when he is bleeding all over and screaming and crying and is covered with burns all over? What do you do when you are falling apart because his skin is peeling off from several places? You know that your life partner is in agony and still you can't do anything but wait. You want to howl in pain and scream and moan but you can't because you have to be strong.
His heart aches for many reasons. She loves him unconditionally. Harry wants Draco to love him like this.
Harry sighed after remaining silent for a couple of moments, his hands grazing Draco's stomach lightly "We do not have to find them if you do not want to. We can live here peacefully and happily." Harry spoke and Draco placed his head on the window sadly.
"It's okay. Do you understand? It's okay to lose your control in front of me. I want you to tell me everything about you. You can take your time but I want to know and it's completely okay. You have gone through a lot. I love you. I love
"You are a broken man, Draco. Poor little Draco. Always needing to die to run from his problems. You are not the person I loved. He was not a defeatist. He fought with his circumstances. He became a spy for our side against his father's wishes. After the trials I was shocked, shocked that you would accept the sentence. I had expected you to fight, no matter who was the minister of magic or the wizengamot judge."
His words give her the strength she needs to confront everything. Right from the starting, everyone saw her as a spoiled girl. She was the only child of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. She was the only one who would inherit his vast empire. According to them, Lucius Malfoy doted on his daughter. They believed that Lucius would do absolutely anything to keep his daughter safe. They believed that amongst her parents, her father loved her the most.
He closes his eyes. Sweat trickles down his cheeks and mingles with his blood, some of which trickles inside his mouth. The coppery taste urges him to spit it out but he can barely move as it is. His heart is literally pounding. It's dark and cloudy and he's sure it will start raining soon. It's quite chilly and he is so cold that he has to literally bite his index finger to prevent them from chartering.
He continues, "But, I want to date you. I want to try if we can work it out. I trust you. Trusting Draco was a wrong decision and the one I am going to regret for my entire life."
"But Harry, it could be a mistake." Hermione whispered, his voice trembling and Draco sympathised with them. He was wondering how Harry could stay so controlled. It was difficult for Draco to digest the truth because Sirius was a Black and technically is his extended family. Harry should be devastated. Sirius was his godfather after all and most likely, there suspicions were correct.
Harry took his time to look at the scars and tried to study his own feelings towards the same. All he found was sadness for Draco and black fury at those bastards.
"None of us knew Draco. Lucius acted upon his own. He didn't tell anyone at all." Severus murmurs, his eyes pooled regret and pain.
"I don't. Believe me Draco. I want to fuck your tight arse and you don't know exactly how much I want that. I want you, actually no, I need you but I need you to want it too. " Harry replied nipping Draco's neck a bit and Draco moaned. But when Harry inserted his little finger inside the hem of his pants, Draco's face shined with sweat. Harry hugged Draco tightly and apparated them to their bedroom. He placed Draco very gently on their bed and turned around to lock the door.
"They must be so ashamed of me. I am a disgrace and I am- am dirty." Draco whispered in a low voice and Harry trembled all over. This was the first time, Draco had used this word.
coat that was quite eye-popping. As for Hal, he pulled on a green hoodie that just looked Slytherin and
“Hal, calm down.” She told him. “That was upsetting, we all understand that, but it’s not Ron’s fault.”
Hal was pleased to hear that, having already made up his mind months ago to try and be part of the team the next year, and having at some point in the course of this game decided he would probably be trying out for Seeker. Lee was right, he would know – so hearing him say so made him think he might have a chance to make the team.
and had left him terrified and looking for synonyms for years after that – until Luna spoke out of the blue.
leather satchel that had a permanent feather-light charm integrated to it, unlike Hal’s current book bag, which he had to charm every time he wanted to spare his back, sometimes with limited success. His shrinking spells were a tad more successful, but somehow did not remove the weight, which was a little inconvenient when going for unfettered. Ron complained that it was definitely out of the budget they had set, but Draco argued they hadn’t actually set a budget this year, they’d only agreed to not be outrageous.
“I hate you, you Gryffindor heathen.” Anthony said dramatically. “How dare you rob us of this victory!”
So instead, he dived, and sure enough, Draco followed. Then, at the last moment, Hal pulled sharply on the tip of his broomstick to make a hairpin turn back upwards. He heard Draco swear and crash into the soft grass behind him, as he flew right back up, and caught the Snitch just left of where he’d spotted it a minute ago.
, and you know what will make you feel like you’re living a lie, you know you’ll be miserable if you stay a girl. Well, I know I’ll be miserable if I have to
It only got worse when Hermione whispered ‘Oh, Ginny…’, having more of a chance than Hal did to look at their surroundings and guessing who the most mortified of onlookers looked to be. Hal only turned his head – away from staring in frozen horror at the creature pinning him to the floor – in time to see her red hair bounce behind her as she fled the scene.
Draco blinked, quill hovering above the page, unsettled by this turn of events. He’d heard of spelled books that would hide your notes, for confidentiality, privacy or secrecy – he should have thought of it really, not that he would have been able to reveal them had it been the case – but one that wrote back? That was a whole different plane of magic.
Another smile flashed at the photographer. As he reached Hal, he flung an arm around his shoulder, and more photos were taken.
“Absolutely.” Lupin smiled at him. “So that’s what we’ll be aiming for, and we’ll build up from there, alright?”
because Hermione kicked the back of his chair and whispered “Just go!” and he thought maybe she had a point, and it was best to just get this over with.
“I was so scared.” The wretched-looking man whimpered. “So scared… I had to protect myself. Sirius, he-”
After a few minutes of sitting tensely – though none of the others seem to notice anything, but Draco had an
Hal laughed, and said goodbye to his aunt – he’d spoken to Ley earlier too, but he still told her to tell him Little John Silver said hi. Ron walked into the dorm just as he was putting the phone down.

“Also…” George hesitated. “We think you probably wouldn’t have failed Ron the way we did on this one.”
?” With the emphasis on the last word, he gave him another shove. “Are you going to go crying to your godfather like the cry-baby you are?”
“It does feel like it’s probably not the most efficient way to protect something valuable.” Anthony mused.
Nobody appeared. Instead, Quirrell raised trembling hands to his head, and started unravelling his turban. When he was done, he turned around, and Hal’s body seized in horror, because there was
The first theory was that Hal was the Heir of Slytherin – the dark power of his powerful lineage had protected him against the Killing Curse as a baby, and after defeating another dark wizard at the end of last year, he was continuing on his way to take the Wizarding world by storm and show everyone that he was a force to be reckoned with.
“First one in your family to go to Hogwarts then?” Draco asked, once he figured this would probably be the least judgmental way of finding out. It had taken him years of unlearning his father’s ways to stop looking down on Muggleborns. He was getting better at it.
in your Transfiguration essay”), and Hermione was happy with herself on the whole, though critical of some minute detail she could remember not getting quite perfect enough.
“Not to worry!” Lockhart flapped his sleeves around. “I have seen my share of injuries! This spell will stop the bleeding!”
made the front page, but he was sharing it with one Sirius Black, who hadn’t been off it since he’d broken out, seeing as the Ministry was still nowhere nearer catching him, and Hal’s eyes latched onto it as soon as it landed in front of him. He put a finger on it, just as Draco’s hand twitched to snatch it out of his sight – it was too late.
Of course, nothing Hal did or didn’t do the next day made any difference. People were whispering behind his back with renewed energy, regardless of if they thought he was or wasn’t the Heir – and his little animal language performance at the Duelling Club seemed to have swayed the balance for the former.
His friends from Hogwarts had pooled together as they had for Draco in June (and Neville – they’d gotten him a book of gardening spells), deciding it was a nice way of doing things as they could buy larger, nicer presents this way. For Hal, they had found some “Translatoffee”, which were sweets that would apparently allow him to understand any language spoken around him – handy for a holiday in France. Hal and Ley shared one to test out if it worked on cats, which it didn’t, which didn’t stop them from making up an entire conversation with Little John Silver that left them crying with laughter.
“You are and will always be our little girl.” He’d said. “And it’s our job to protect you. While we think it’s
He was pulled out of his thoughts as the key turned in the lock again, and he saw the blurred form of the woman in the doorway.
“I had to learn it.” Pan answered. “My father was of the belief that politics for women was knowing all the connections and knowing when and how to play them. As opposed to a more power-driven approach for men. Sword versus poison and all that, figuratively.” He shrugged again. “But actually, I found that I quite like genealogy.”
“Does everyone know about me?” He asked very quietly, almost hoping Draco wouldn’t hear him, and offer no answer.
As it turned out, she hadn’t been that far off. Hal himself has suspected whatever he’d have to do would be Lockhart-centric, but he hadn’t imagined it’d go so far as helping him answer bloody fan mail. What was this man doing being a teacher? What had Dumbledore been on when he’d thought that was a good idea? Surely, with one magic school in the whole of Great Britain, there were other candidates for the post. Surely not
“Hermione…” He started, not knowing if he should apologise, of even talk about the revelation he’d just had. Wouldn’t it make him look even more oblivious?
“Come on, Hal.” He nudged him. “Let’s go sit down somewhere, and wait for news.” He looked up to his professor. “You’ll let us know right away, right?”
He didn’t wait for an answer, and he would have just walked away like a boss had Snape not swooped down on the scene and ask to see them both in his office.
“And you could have decided not to testify at the trial to spare yourself having to live through it all again.” She continued. “I know it brought back some of the nightmares. It was very brave. So I wanted to say well done.”
“Yeah, it’s Saturday.” Anthony said, looking a little dazed. When Pan just frowned, he pointed to his head, where Pan just then spotted the kippah. His father was wearing a similar one. “Synagogue.” Anthony specified.
“But don’t let that take anything away from what a feat that was.” Fred added. “You’re a natural, Harry, that was truly great.”
He got up to open the window and let Draco’s owl in. She landed on Hal’s desk with a happy chirp, dropping a small parcel on the surface, and Ley went to pet her. She had become very familiar with both boys over the course of the last week – Draco sent her with a letter or a trinket every day, sometimes twice a day. He also got a daily call from Hermione, usually with everyone else loudly gathered around her, though he didn’t think that would carry on into the holiday as they weren’t all staying at Hogwarts over the break. He’d almost expected some of them to be on his doorstep the minute school broke, actually, but in the end they’d arranged various visits the following week in a more civilised manner.
“I’ve got a bit of money saved up.” Pan said. “I was thinking of maybe getting a room at the Leaky Cauldron, or-”
Neville seemed to fare decently well throughout the day, but Hal felt like he was sleepwalking into each hour. By the time their last class rolled around, he was all but dozing off at his desk.
“We are so grateful to you.” Sarah squeezed Hal’s hand when they were done, and it was clear she didn’t just mean for the picture. “Things would have been so different if you hadn’t put an end to the war.”
back) and they decided to spent the rest of the afternoon flying it off – Draco had two broomsticks, and they improvised a game of chase with an enchanted goblet.
“Yeah, sorry.” Hal snorted. “It was random. But, hum, I was wondering, are they like other dogs, like, some are friendly, some are bity…”
Hal knew it was something adults said, although he had noticed he’d grown a fair bit in the past few months – his jeans felt a bit short on the ankles. Hermione had also mentioned something about being connected to his magical core, but he’d stopped listening in favour of watching Ron try to teach his rat a trick, unsuccessfully for about the 10th time.
circumstances, what just happened is, to say the least, not going to do you any favours, Potter. Although there is no evidence that it is linked to anything nefarious, the ability to speak to snakes is not perceived in a good light, for one considerable reason, which is that the only known Parselmouth in the last century was He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”
Just the six of them – to everyone unspoken and slightly guilt-tinged relief, all the Slytherins were sticking to their own quarters. They were getting along better, truly, but they still weren’t exactly thick as thieves, and having Pan hang out with them, let alone Blaise and occasionally Daphne, Vince and Greg, still felt like a bit of an intrusion.
They’d found him underneath the slide in the playground, half frozen to death, and even though it looked pathetic, Hal had fallen in love with it as soon as he’d picked it up, and the little claws had feebly dug into the skin of his fingers. Ley had decided right alongside him that they needed to take it home and nurse it back to health.
After they’d dropped him off again, Hal went straight into the kitchen to check on the cat – though his aunt sternly asked him to go put his things in his room instead of leaving them in the middle of the corridor, so he had to make a quick run back and forth. The little creature looked healthier already, and it trotted up to Hal on the table to nibble at his fingers as he tried to pet him.
They had an agreement for the Easter holiday: no magic, no owls, no talk of wizardry, nothing else but the three of them as a family, like the good old days. Ley was the one who had suggested that, because he was worried about The Divide (as he always called it dramatically) that could be growing between them, but Hal was more than happy to comply. He loved his new life, but he missed his old one too. He missed Ley.
“Hermione is right.” He said when Hal had left the library. “Yeah, I heard everything you said.” He added with a look at their worried looks. “I don’t think Hal did. But, yeah, he’s got to figure that one out on his own. Give him some space.”
“I really love it.” Hal confessed. “It sucks that I won’t be able to practice over the summer though.”
. We know it’s not true, mate. I told Hal maybe we should wait for you to be ready to tell us, but if this is getting worse…”
I do like the idea of Harry with darker skin, but I’m not sure that’s how I picture him here. I’ve not found my perfect cast!
“Colin had been working on it before he…” One of the girls carried on, and looked a little too overwhelmed to continue, so the third one took over.
“Oh, no.” Petunia answered, though she probably should have said yes, what did it matter, she needed to go in five minutes. But she went on and explained anyway. “The one with lighter hair is my son, the one with the darker hair is my nephew. But I’ve raised him since he was one.”
“You’re not.” Hermione assured kindly. “But that’s not what I meant – I meant the fact they became Animagi. That is really difficult magic, and it takes a lot of dedication.”
Hal also seemed more freely fascinated with magic when they were outdoors. He loved practicing spells, having the space to do so, and though he had originally started learning a few basic things to ‘catch himself up’, he’d said, compared to Wizard-born children who would naturally acquire them at home, he’d just carried on, and Draco suspected he now knew about as much, if not more, as a third-year would.
But in spite of what he’d told his friends, he didn’t think it had been a ghost. And, and that was probably the most upsetting thing about it all, Hal couldn’t help but recall the last time he’d heard a hissing voice, a slithering tone that made a chill creep up his spine. He had never told his friends, or even his family, but he’d been having nightmares since the previous year’s encounter. More than once, he’d dreamt of trying to escape black hands that would harm him if they touched him, while a hissing voice ordered
“I don’t want to eat, and I’m not staying here.” Hal insisted, and he tried to make for the door, but she interposed herself.
“Yes, sir.” She obeyed in a small voice, and followed when he headed out again. The incantation Minerva had shared with him caused the chess pieces to stand down, and whatever Quirrell had done to the troll (Severus did not think it had been the kids, though it wouldn’t bloody surprise him at this point) had been efficient, because it was still out cold. As for the potions, they were a nice touch if he did say so himself, but again, a simple spell of his own devise could undo the effect of the flames.
She gave him a haughty look. “You think I do? Not particularly liking the part where I’m expected to act like the perfect
He’d thought it was a parrot of some kind, but now he was closer up, he could see it looked nothing like. It wasn’t like any bird he’d ever seen, actual, and Hal had no idea if it was even one of those tropical birds you might see on those nature documentaries that looked so odd and colourful, or if it was a magical bird that Muggles wouldn’t even be aware of.
“That’s what friends do.” Anthony shrugged. “You’d have gone to him if he hadn’t been in another country.”
They both made a valiant effort to get to their feet, dragging deep into whatever small reserves of energy they had left. Severus helped them up, even Hal who was clearly too tired to be proud about it and refuse his arm, in spite of the still rocky relationship between them (Sev had agreed to stop the barbs for Draco’s sake, but it didn’t mean he had to like the boy – and Hal certainly didn’t hide the fact that Snape wasn’t his favourite Professor).
“Anyway.” Fred waved a hand. “We didn’t realise Pettigrew was an actual person who was really there the whole time. And we think you would have known better.”
“I’ll take us directly.” Dumbledore said as the bird perched on his shoulder. “Minerva, if you and Mister Potter would join us there? Oh, and send for a dose of Veritaserum from Severus.”
“For fuck’s sake.” Anthony sighed on his behalf. “Really? Still? Can’t people drop this stupid Heir theory already?”
“I can be committed.” Pan said determinedly. “This isn’t… I’ve thought a lot about it already. I know I want it. I
Draco had a dilemma on his hands. With three days to go to the Easter holidays, he had received a letter from his mother that morning, informing him that she had been invited to visit her dear friend Michelle in her villa in the south of France, and would he therefore mind terribly staying at Hogwarts over the break. Yes, Draco minded, but what choice did that leave him with?
The debate that ensued touched on whether Shakespeare had been a wizard (unlikely) or had known some actual witches (less unlikely) and ended with Pan and Hermione almost shouting at each other about how realistic Prospero was, but Draco knew they would probably be fast friends after that. Ron was just looking at them in mild panic the whole time, and Draco didn’t think he learnt all that much about Shakespeare.
– but there was no proof Flint had ordered the hit, so to speak, and Bole had already lost his House fifty points and would be serving a month of detention. And they had, reluctantly on Draco’s part, mentioned the bullying, but there as well, apparently, revenge wasn’t the answer and Hal shouldn’t have taken it upon himself to go settle the score.
“Aw, I wish I could go with you.” Ley moaned, for the umpteenth time since the outing had been decided.
“Being stuck in an arranged marriage, forced to have kids, I suppose.” Pan said dismissively, though they could all tell he was uncomfortable. He had a dry chuckle. “Basically becoming my mother.”
Hal felt himself bristle. “I don’t think Draco needs me to be a good influence on him.” He snapped, his voice cracking and painful, but it needed to be said. “Or anyone else, for that matter.”
“Harry-” Dora started, and Draco could tell she was about to launch into something like apologising, or talking about how Black had ended up in Azkaban in the first place, and no, just no,
“They can’t let it go on anyway.” Ron nodded thoughtfully. “I know there’s already some folks who’ve considered pulling their kids out. My mom’s freaking out, for one. Purebloods or not.” He added with a defiant look towards Blaise.
“Wow. Okay.” Draco decided to shelf this disturbing new insight into the rumour mill, and refused to let himself be distracted from the more pressing matter. “Whose foot?”
One of the newly-sorted Gryffindors was Thomas Lowe, the kid Hal had met with his family in Windermere the previous spring, and after saying hello to him (very much like an over-enthusiastic puppy) he immediately latched on to Colin Creevey, who seemed quite happy to take on the role of big brother at Hogwarts a year early – his own brother would be starting the following year.
“I’ve been thinking about that.” Draco confessed. “Things might get a bit… reckless, around here, but there still must be a reason why that thing is inside the school.”
century.” Hermione tried to moderate, though she winced at Hal’s comment. “That’s plenty of time for a lot of branches. Very distant branches.”
“Harry.” Someone spoke his name, in a soft breath of surprise, as he emerged onto the space between two carriages, where he knew – thought – nobody would be.
“He was gone eleven years ago.” Hal spat back. “He was gone last year after Quirrell died. He keeps, coming, back.”
Draco nodded, and his mother stepped into the fire, followed by Petunia, Hal and Ley together, then Draco himself as he took a final, deep breath before going through.
He did find his friend sat at a study table, three books open in front of her and a pile of another five by her right elbow. She didn’t look up until he sat down next to her and nudged her foot.
“The first meeting! Yes!” Lockhart cried out. “Your first duel! Do you want your first real duel to be your last!?”
He pushed into the shop ahead of Draco, and kept up a constant chatter, pointing at the various items, the whole time it took for Draco to make his choice – a delicate ebony flute that could play itself if you used a specific spell. It had ten recorded tunes and then you could teach it more, which he thought his mother would enjoy too.
The celebration itself got a little overwhelming, though, and Hal found himself withdrawing to sit in a quieter corner of the common room when everyone got on to another loud round of Butterbeer-Quidditch. Hermione dropped on the other half of the love-seat a minute later.
Hal went to the sink to splash some water on his face. It was pointless thinking like that. Whether Draco was interested in boys, girls, both or neither, Hal wouldn’t know until he actually talked to him about it. Plus, they were thirteen. Things had time to change.
Hal looked like he was concentrating for a moment, brow furrowed and his lips pursed in a thin line. He remained silent, clearly coming to some conclusions in his head, for long enough that Draco had to ask.
Draco personally thought it was ludicrous, and as the twins insisted it was so far the most likely scenario to happen out of all of the ones they’ve been given, he dissolved into helpless laughter.
, which was gross and in a lot of people’s opinions, highly inappropriate to unleash among minors – deliver valentines. Cards, notes, chocolates, flowers, bloody
“You can understand it?” Rolf stated like he was talking to a small child. “I assume that’s how you guys reached the conclusion it could be a snake.”
Hal allowed himself to raise an unimpressed eyebrow. “I’m pretty sure he wasn’t just saying a word, on account of finding ourselves suddenly bound and gagged.” He retorted.
The two sisters had been exchanging owls ever since Narcissa had reached out. Andromeda had been wary at first, but when it had become clear her sister was sincere, she had been more than eager to make up for lost time.
Millie startled at the mention of her name, and tried to act like she hadn’t. She opened her mouth like she was trying to find a way to answer in the same fashion as Pan and Draco had just been speaking, but she didn’t have the pedigree, if Draco could allow himself that titbit of snobbery.
The moved on to lighter topics as they finished enjoying their ice-creams (Chocolate Frog flavour for Sirius and Fizzing Whizzbees for Hal), and by the time they headed out of the shop, it had actually stopped raining. They decided to walk around for a bit, talking about Quidditch, before Hal had to head back to school.
And Hal could swear, like several other people that day, that he’d looked straight at the corner of his forehead where, underneath his thick hair, the skin was marred by his scar.
“WHAT!” A shriek prevented Draco from answering – if he even had been about to, in his state – and made Hal jump a foot in the air.
“How do we do this?” Anthony asked, a pile of haphazardly wrapped parcels in his arms. “By receiver, by giver, or total chaos?”
Thankfully, that resulted in Draco snorting, then trying to pretend that he hadn’t made such an undignified noise, but still looking amused. Which was better than the frown and pout, as far as Hal was concerned. He hadn’t meant to upset him with his indelicate questions.
“I was ill for the past few days.” Lupin answered easily. It could explain how worn out he looked. “I had to delay my arrival by a bit, but rest assured that this will not affect your education.”
“Draco.” She said reverently, joy still in her eyes, and so much love, more than she had shown in years, though Draco had always known it was there. “Mon trésor.”
“You’ll be fine.” He told her reassuringly, and he saw her trying to smile through her puffed up face.
They fell backwards in a tangle, rushed to their feet as the door mercifully clicked shut, and ran – though there would have been no way the massive heads could come through the door, let alone the body – and only stopped when they reached the six-fingered suit of armour, and the edge of the staircase. The bannister was up, but they could see a flight of stairs lazily spinning towards them.
“We weren’t trying to break in.” Draco spoke, and Hal felt grateful, because he was in all likelihood the only one who would be able to appease the man, if anyone could at all. “It was a call for help.”
Severus decided not to grace that with an answer, and he stormed off instead. He caught the first portrait he saw, and told it to inform Minerva in the Gryffindor common room – he had no doubt this would be where she’d have taken the kids – that the children were safe, and on their way to the hospital wing. For his part, in spite of what he had told Miss Granger, he felt like he had seen, heard and thought enough of Potter for the rest of the year, and he retreated to the dungeons.
At some point in the evening, presumable shortly after the Hogwarts Express had reached Scotland and Hermione had been able to speak to McGonagall, Hal received an owl (luckily they had just made it back from the hospital, where Ley was going to spend another night, and didn’t have to deal with a massive bird of prey bursting through the Gastroenterology department) instructing him to be at the Leaky Cauldron at 8:30am the next day, where a member of the faculty would pick him up.
“I’m not happy he died, obviously.” Draco continued, speaking as if the words were fragile things that might shatter. “But I’m happy we do have this.”
Hal grunted at the call. They didn’t need to tell Hermione! She would probably try to talk them out of it – and fair enough, part of Hal did kind of want to be talked out of it, but it was the right thing to do.
Hal had enthusiastically agreed, before remembering he was one of the ones with a big fortune. Draco found it endearing, how he forgot about that. He supposed he’d only just found out about it, and he’d not yet had time to get used to the idea. He also guessed Hal did not actually quite know just how rich he was. But the Potter line was a very old one, its members had been clever wizards and good businessmen for centuries, and that was even before Hal’s grandfather invented the wizarding world’s best-selling hair potion. Hal was set for life, whether he realised it or not.
“Harry Potter!” He boomed again. “What a delight! What a pleasant coincidence! For two famous wizards such as ourselves to meet!”
“Hey, you get to take care of the kitten.” Hal pointed out. He turned to inform Draco. “We found a kitten in the park.” And back to Ley. “Don’t let your mom get rid of him before I get back.”
He came to stand right in front of the frame, and with a jolt that ran right through his bones, he suddenly recognised the two figures standing closest to him in the mirror. His mom and dad. They looked so real he turned around again, but the room behind him was empty.
Three hours in – because they had decided either not to accept failure, or not to rest on their laurels, or both, and to have another crack at savoury – they had actually fallen into some kind of rhythm, perusing the recipes they had chosen and sharing out the tasks. At that point, it had become clear that Hal was a natural, and Ley was a disaster, so the division of labour was mostly Ley chopping and lining things up ready to be used, and Hal doing everything else.
“I don’t think so.” Petunia said softly, looking up and taking Hal’s hand. “Your father was an only child and his parents passed...”
Ley, naturally, just scoffed. Petunia pushed his hair off his forehead – it sprung right back – with a smile.
Hal hadn’t planned to tell his aunt about the potential curse, but his talk with Dumbledore had left him feeling confused and insecure – the man was just plain weird and cryptic, if you asked him – and in the end everything spilled out of him when he was on the phone to her.
It did happen, however. Once, as Dora had gone off to meet friends and Draco, Hal and Ley were sat enjoying some ice cream at a place that had quickly become a regular spot ever since the first day, when Dora had introduced them to it. The
do worse to him than punch him in the face (and he would, too, if he threatened or approached Draco in any way again) or because he thought there was a chance Hal was either the Heir or some dark and powerful wizard regardless of that particular legend – while the whole ‘attacking students’ accusation was more or less fading, Hal had not shaken the fact that he
“Okay.” He shrugged. “But you know, I’m twelve. I feel like things have time to get serious. I don’t worry about it too much.”
“That would explain the Parseltongue.” Anthony interrupted, coming to that conclusion quicker than him.
He only seemed slightly out of breath from his run and subsequent spellcasting, while Draco felt just about ready to cough up a lung. He really needed to work on his cardio.
Pan’s mouth snapped shut at the word. Clearly he hadn’t been expecting Draco to actually capitulate, or at least not this quickly.
Hagrid nodded, his eyes filled with tears again, and waved at them – with the hand that was no longer holding the dog – as they walked away.
“Yeah, I must admit, it was rather magnificent. Just wanted to check you didn’t see it as a sign that you two are soulmates and I wouldn’t have to have this argument with you?”
Then of course, Hal started running towards it, leaving Draco to once again realise his utter lack of fitness as he went after him. By the time he caught up and reached the gamekeeper’s cottage, Hal was casting
He backed him up a bit, until Hal’s spine was pressing against the tree, and Nils was pressing against him. He was taller and wider than him, and Hal suddenly felt scared. Where exactly was this going? Kissing was exhilarating, it was a novel experience and it had been completely unexpected, but as incredible as it was that Nils – and Fran! – could be up for it, exploring this further right there and then seemed to be going a little to far.
Hal tuned out to the rest of the discussion about which team was more deserving, since his friends they would end up agreeing exactly never, and caught himself thinking he’d have loved for someone to be filming all this, so he could show his aunt and Ley back at home. Maybe next year, he should try to find someone who owned a video camera – surely some of the Muggleborns in Hogwarts did – and ask them if he could borrow it. Petunia would be horrified and find it extremely dangerous, no doubt, but Ley would love it.
“The Aurors are looking into it, but they think he had help.” Sirius reported gravely. “From inside the Ministry.”
Now Draco understood why they had never made him the target of public humiliation – word that he was Snape’s godson had clearly gotten out, and apparently even Flint wasn’t stupid enough to risk this getting back to him. He was clearly counting on the fact that nobody likes a snitch, and that Draco wouldn’t say anything to anyone. Ruefully, Draco had to admit he was probably right. He didn’t see himself going to Sev with this, it seemed entirely petty. He could handle it.
?” Ley asked with glee, holding out a handful of thick gold coins out of the standard-issue thin leather pouch Hal had been given at the bank. He hadn’t had the heart to ask Petunia to go into another shop, after the wand and the books and the cauldron and the robes, to look for a nicer one. “Is that real money?”
as the dwarf sat on his legs and started singing what was essentially a love song, except a truly awful one, written by someone who was either determined to make his life miserable, or who really had an awful taste in rhymes and simile. Not to mention
“Hey, you started it.” Hal nudged him with his bare foot. “Without you I’d probably still be freaking out.”
“Hey.” He said enthusiastically when he’d grabbed one, waving it in the animal’s face. “Look at the nice stick. Go fetch!”
Never mind that he’d read each of Hal’s letters about six times. Never mind that he didn’t know what to do with himself, waiting for the day he’d see Hal again. He wasn’t going to think too long and hard about what it said about him, or the loneliness of his life.
“And my cousin.” The other boy smiled. “But really, he’s like my twin. We’re born a month apart and we always did everything together.”
That seemed contradictory to Hal, but then this was a magical household – Hal didn’t know any summoning spells, but maybe Draco had ways to-
“Er, no, I can’t say I did.” Said Hal, who did not have the faintest what glowlice were, but they sounded disgusting.
When Hal woke up next, his throat and chest were tight and painful, but his head felt lighter. He had to blink blearily and confusedly a few times for things to come into focus when he opened his eyes, even after readjusting his glasses that had slipped off his nose, because he didn’t see why the headmaster would be sat by his bedside, but there he was.
But as they went through the rooms, she had become angered for a whole different reason. Although she doubted anyone else had understood the reference, she thought Hal hadn’t be far off when he’d mentioned Crackerjack. A big bad dog tricked with music, a – admittedly murderous – plant you learnt about in first year Herbology, ‘catch the key’ with a broomstick conveniently supplied, chess? It was like being in a game show for children. The only thing that was half a threat was the mountain troll, and even then, even if it had been awake, Hal, Anthony and Draco had already faced one before and had come out unscathed. Nothing about those “trials” would stop a grown wizard, let alone a dark one, if that was what Quirrell turned out to be.
“Of course, my dear Harry, you would like to share your story!” Lockhart said enthusiastically. “Tell them how thrilled you are at the prospect of your Defence classes this year.”
Somehow, the words still had the old magic they had held since they were four years old, and they stopped fighting in favour of jumping up and down, both beaming, talking excitedly over each other in a jumble of questions and anecdotes that definitely would need the rest of the holiday to unravel properly.
, but if you were… maybe somehow, when he tried to kill you, his magic recognised his kin and… refused?”
“As such, in view of the events of the past two days.” The Headmaster continued with a glint in his eyes. “There are some last-minute points to award.”
There were gasps and murmurs in the audience – as if the whole story hadn’t been public knowledge already; the rumours had been running wild all summer after they’d spilled out of the Hogwarts student, to the point where it had become so ridiculous Dumbledore had had to make a statement towards the end of July to set the record straight.
“Myrtle!” He spun around, facing the ghost, suspecting his face was just about the same hue as hers at this point. “Get someone – Dumbledore, anyone.”
Hal almost asked Ron to come with him to McGonagall, but he did not want to raise any suspicion in the rat – or man posing as rat, God, if that was true, it was just too weird to think about, especially looking at the creature curled up next to Ron’s read on his pillow – and dragging Ron out of bed before 8 am on a Sunday morning would definitely be a suspicious thing to do.
“So you killed a giant snake with a sword from a hat.” Anthony summarised. “Another day in the life of Harry Potter.”
He flew down to the ground in a bit of a haze, legs shaking, hands burning and head throbbing, and he was immediately surrounded by his teammates, half cheering and congratulating him, half worriedly checking and asking if he was okay.
“AH!” Seamus screamed a second later, just as the room filled with several other cries and gasps. “Feck, bloody hell, mate, why would you do that? Scared the shite outa me, you did!”
Draco opened his from largest to smallest: a large box of tea bags containing different sorts from Neville, paperback copies of the three
We went up one chapter in the total count! The last one was running away with me so I split it. Things have not left me with a lot of time to write IRL but I'm almost done with this book - then on to the next one! No rest for the wicked.
Nonetheless, he honestly didn’t feel he was being completely reckless. Well, he was being mostly reckless, but there were a few things that made him confident he wasn’t just walking to his certain death. It wasn’t that he was underestimating Quirrell, even though he didn’t seem very threatening, but Hal had an inkling the helpless stuttering professor act was, well, an act. But he had brought this to Dumbledore, and while he didn’t trust the man as far as he could throw him, he was still in charge of hundreds of children, and one of the greatest wizards alive, and Hal thought maybe, somehow, he was keeping an eye on him. He certainly had shown an interest.
“I’m dead serious.” Pan replied levelly. “I’ve changed my name to Eitan Parkinson, you’ll hear it in class, and I’ll be staying in the boys’ dorms.”
It occurred to him then that maybe there laid an alternative solution to his problem. If he made more of an effort to rekindle his ready-made friendships with the other Pureblood kids he’d spent part of his childhood with, maybe the older Slytherin boys would leave him alone. He’d have guest privileges, unspoken protection from the other students, which would certainly be more than what little shielding being related to their head of House offered. At least he hopped so.
“That was on her eighteenth birthday.” Sirius told them, as they stared at the picture – Hal and Ley having gathered round Petunia to look it over with her.
Everyone at the table was roaring – no pun intended – when he sat down, clearly very pleased to have scored the famous Harry Potter. Hal thought at least he would be able to write to Ley telling him he could stop worrying about whether he’d be popular.
before he managed to get past the shock enough to officially proclaimed Gryffindor as the winner of the game, and of the cup, to a deafening roar from the supporters.
Draco froze again, on instinct, but he relaxed minutely when he saw nothing but amusement, understanding and curiosity on the other boy’s features.
“Peter Pettigrew is alive, he’s an Animagus and he’s been hiding as a rat this whole time?” She summarised.
He really wanted to just go, now. This conversation hadn’t done much in way of making him feel better. But Dumbledore did not seem to be in a rush to let him out.
Draco could tell the other boy in the shop had not been to Diagon Alley before – unlike himself who was there on any given Saturday. His mother shopped a lot. She called it socialising.
There was an insert from a bank, with information and exchange rates to change pounds for things called galleons and sickles (five pounds to a galleon, that sounded like a fairly strong currency).
James had ambushed her – It was the only way to think of it – right at the end of the wake, after all the guests had left the venue, and Petunia herself had only popped to the loo before the drive home.
So, whatever the mirror was or did, it was changeable. Personal, maybe, showing people their parallel realities?
“Anytime between November and March is bad timing.” Anthony piped up. “Everyone gets sick when it’s cold.” He paused thoughtfully. “Except Edmund. He gets stronger instead.”
Anthony was generally a really funny guy, and he had the most ridiculous imagination, always coming up with the wildest things. In one of those occasions, they stopped paying attention to the stairs because Anthony was retelling a story about Newt Scamander from the point of view of the Erumpent and they were all in tears, and they got hopelessly lost somewhere between the second and third floor.
“No, I mean, I get it.” Pan shook his head. “Not everyone can be as accepting as you guys. I’ll always be grateful to you for that, and I know I can’t expect it of everyone.”
of being personally after you – because let me remind you, you felt the same about Professor Snape-”
Hal turned back once, probably to check they’d put enough distance between them and the hut to be out of earshot, and shook his head with a short laugh.
Gryffindor had won the House cup again, courtesy of the 200 points Dumbledore had awarded Hal for that little deed of besting Voldermort, again, saving Draco’s life and potentially countless others that would have been on the line if Tommy the Teenage Dark Lord hadn’t been stopped. After the award, Hal thought it was all a bit over the top to grant him that huge amount of points as well, but he wasn’t going to complain when everyone was so happy celebrating.
Severus did not miss the slight inflection the older wizard put on Lily’s name, and he hated him for it. He did not need reminding of the power that name held over him, he did not need reminding that he, too, was a puppet. Only at least, he was a grown man, and he had chosen it.
“Okay, so let’s go check.” Hal replied, undeterred. “Then we can decide who goes after him and who goes to get teachers.”
“I know, sorry.” Hal sighed. “It’s not that I was trying to hide it from you or anything, it’s just, I wasn’t… well I’m still not sure, really.”
Narcissa Malfoy was looking around her in clear disdain, but Hal knew it was a testament in itself that she had agreed to set foot in a Muggle home. Draco seemed excited, although he startled slightly when the whirlwind that were Hal and Ley together erupted in the room.
“As you know, the House Cup rankings are not final until the very end of the year, and every student can still earn or lose points until they have alighted the train in King’s Cross.”
As she approached, Hal was alarmed to find he wasn’t feeling any more energetic than when he’d first woken up. He tried to bat her away, his arm moving slowly and only meeting air in a pathetic attempt at anything defensive. He couldn’t do anything when she reached him and helped him up onto unsteady feet.
Then everything went blurry, and they emerged onto the hidden platform for the Hogwarts Express – Hal realised they’d gone right through the barrier as they’d kept walking. He took a moment to gape at the gleaming red steam train.
Dumbledore looked a little started, only for a split second, as if he hadn’t been expecting Hal to question him on that straight off the bat.
“Hello, Mrs Dursley.” He smiled at her politely, then more widely at Ley, though he still felt a little awkward around the other boy, having only crossed path briefly in the past. “Hi, Ley.”
“Yeah.” Sirius laughed. He had a fond, wistful look on his face a second later as he added: “We called ourselves the Marauders.”
He sat up in bed screaming, holding his head with both hands, genuinely terrified for a few seconds while his brain shook off the nightmare, that it was going to split open. Madam Pomfrey came rushing in, and sagged in relief when she could see there wasn’t actually any blood, boils or broken bones visible. She put a hand on Hal’s forehead.
“So here’s the thing.” Anthony whispered. “We came to get you because there’s a troll on the loose. We didn’t want you to run into it unknowingly.”
? By an evil dark wizard who’d tried to murder him too? Making him somehow the person who ended a war? What the hell?
Out of sight, presumably casually peering from the kitchen to check nothing (and no-one) was on fire, Mrs Weasley held back her son.
There was the spiteful Snape Hal recognised. For a moment there, he’d been caught thinking Snape was really good at this, and he’d make a great DADA instructor.
Draco would even say Hal had become too quiet, often withdrawn and almost gloomy. He found him outside one Saturday only a couple of days to the end of the month, on the banks of the Black Lake, and he sat down beside him in spite of the cold, pulling his scarf tight around his neck.
than the rest of the grand mansion, but then Draco had pushed open the double doors at the other end, and Hal’s jaw had dropped.
Draco volunteered to go and find Hermione, who hadn’t had a chance to join them at the stadium, but then she’d probably have expected them to be down there for a good few hours. He ran into her on his way to the library.
“Draco.” Draco adopted his best haughty air even as he extended a hand for Nils to shake. “I’ve heard about you.”
“He’s not strong enough.” Hermione said softly, patting his back. “Hal, he was a force to be reckoned with during the war, but now he’s nothing. A ghost, a memory.”
Rather unfortunately, that was exactly the moment Ley popped back into the room to tell them lunch was ready, and they both could see the startled look on his face before it morphed into a smile.
The room was larger than any of the previous ones, and empty but for a large mirror, so Hal’s gaze could only be drawn to it. He recognised it instantly, and his heart did a little summersault as he couldn’t help but think
“Oooolll…” The sound started to become distinguishable words as Professor Quirrell barged into the Great Hall, waving his arms around. “There’s a troll! THERE’S A TROLL!” Students stumbled out of his way as he kept shouting. “THERE IS A MOUNTAIN TROLL IN THE DUNGEONS!”
“Not nearly enough.” The captain said as he pocketed it all. “I expect you to repay the rest of your debt at school.” He bent over him. “So I’ll be seeing you, birdie.”
Either way, however much money Hal would have to his name, it was a helpful start in life. She suddenly felt newfound respect for James Potter. It was morbid to prepare for your possible death to the extent he had, but it was clear it had been with actual grounds, and it left his son with something for the future.
, but he supposed he had to take the victory of none of them being in trouble, and earning their Houses points instead. It did say a lot however, in this opinion, about this school’s take on health and safety and child endangerment.
Neville had picked up and read the note, and gave Hal a look that seemed to ask how he felt about that. Hal shrugged, a little helplessly. He hadn’t figured that out yet. Oblivious to their silent exchange, Ron was watching his hand disappear inside and out of the folds of the cloak with absolute fascination. Silver started playing with the hem, and Hal picked him up so he wouldn’t rip it to shreds.
There must have been something threatening enough in her eyes, because he didn’t need telling twice. Petunia kept hold of Hal, grabbed Ley with her free hand, smiled at the little girl who wasn’t crying anymore but looking at them with adoration, and dragged both her wayward children outside.
Doing his best to look chastised and remorseful, though it couldn’t be further to how he truly felt, and focusing on what the professor was saying so as not to get himself into more trouble, Hal did not hear the faint hiss moving through the corridor.
Hermione let out a heavy sigh. “Magic sometimes is just frustrating.” She asserted. “There’s a lack of
“Draco.” Hermione interrupted him gently. “It’s not like he made an Unbreakable Vow of it. Let’s go find him, and see if anything happened that upset him, or something, alright?”
“At any rate.” Another look at the ledger. “The total income is, at present, somewhere between 300 and 400 galleons a year. This fluctuates with sales and usage of the various inventions, products or spells attributed to the Potter line. Last year, your vault balance increased by 321 galleons, 12 sickles and 5 knuts.”
“Weird.” Hal chuckled. “I’m not sure I’m quite ready to go ask him for stories about my mom when she was younger, though.”
“I could ask my friend if I can go with them?” Hal suggested, remembering Draco had mentioned he would traditionally be going shopping with his mother. “Travel is… easier, for wizards. They could pick me up and drop me back off, I’m sure.”
“I am not sure, Harry.” He told him. “But rest assured we are doing everything we can to keep the students safe.”
“No, it’s fine.” Draco mumbled. “I don’t mind. I never… Nobody’s ever given me a nickname, is all. It’s odd. I suppose you’re used to it.”
Once again not a whole lot happened there, but I am quite fond of that scene in the Slytherin common room. Go Draco!
he really didn’t want to stay in the castle without the protection of his friends, classmates, and general crowds of students. There would be a few people left, of course, but not enough to make it hard work for Flint hounding him down. It was never going beyond a few shoves, slurs, creepy grins and racking the few coins he had in his pockets at the time, but they also didn’t really seem to be getting bored with picking on him.
Hal frowned. He could almost her Hermione’s voice telling him to stop riling up dangerous murderous people who had already announced they wanted to kill him, but on the other hand, how could it possibly make it worse?
They bumped into Hermione on their dash from the Ravenclaw common room (on her way to the library) and Anthony did not even pause, he grabbed her hand and told her to come with them. She started a few questions but in the end seemed to decide to save her breath, and went along with it. Draco felt a surge of love and gratefulness for his friends, but in that moment, it didn’t quite overpower the mad worry that threatened to overwhelm him when he thought about the other three in the gamekeeper’s hut.
“Oh.” Hermione breathed out excitedly, like she did when she knew an interesting fact. Which was always. “I read about that actually.”
He missed as Quirrell diverted the spell with a slash of his wand, and raised it towards him – but he hesitated as his parasite hissed at him to
He started really paying attention to the sorting when they got to the letter G. He was a little surprised to see Granger, Hermione go to Gryffindor, not surprised at all when just before her Goyle and Greengrass were sent to Slytherin. A few more students went through – the name
“They’ve been telling me how busy things have been with the dental practice.” Hermione added. “It’s so… normal. But then I look around, and everyone’s doing magic, and that’s normal too, you know? Sometimes I feel like… my life is so different now. Like there’s a part of me they’ll never really see, never understand.”
“Yes, it seems you have.” A mysterious smile, again, like he knew something Hal didn’t. Which, let’s face it, was probably a whole lot of things.
“I’m sure you’ve got what matters in here.” Hal shrugged. “Don’t feel bad because of this.” He waved his own letter. “I’m writing to two people so it’s bound to be longer.”
From the look on Percy’s face, he didn’t know whether he was joking or not. From the snorts from his three brothers sitting nearby, they did.
“He can’t do things half-way, that boy.” Hal’s aunt added, sounding a little amused, though Draco could hear the strain of her voice.
They played with him until it was time to go back home to help Petunia, and get ready to face Aunt Marge.
“Yeah.” Neville shrugged. “I guess he just wanted to make sure a student hadn’t died on his watch. He didn’t say much, he was here like two minutes, but I heard the Mediwitches talk about how he cast a spell that meant I didn’t bleed out on the spot.”
“I want to know what’s going on.” Hal said, and it didn’t sound like a rash, spur-of-the-moment decision. He’d clearly thought about it. “I know I might be pushing my luck, but…” He shook his head with a frown. “My magic has protected me so far. I want to know what’s going on.” He repeated.
They went back to the dorm, and Hal didn’t cast another spell to tell the time, but by the time he finally to go back to sleep, he reckoned it must have been gone three AM.
Still, he supposed it could be worse, since Flint wasn’t there this time, nor any of the older kids (Draco longed for the day he’d also be old enough to get out of these gatherings). It was just Pansy, Daphne, Blaise, Vince and Greg.
“Alright.” He sighed. “If you say so. I’m not going to force you to talk about it. But if this happens again, I’m not going to ignore it, okay? I don’t want you to think you’re alone in this, whatever
When they went back to the pitch, the difference was so palpable Hal could feel it in the air. Maybe the Ravenclaw were feeling a bit too confidence with their advance, and their game got sloppier. Maybe the Gryffindor players figured Oliver might
Ley sagged in disappointment, but it didn’t last very long, as he snatched the letter from Harry’s hands to read it for himself. “This sounds ridiculous.” He commented. “I get why these people don’t want the rest of the world to know about them.”
Skeeter's smiling widely. The woman's fond of Harry. Actually, everyone is fond of Harry, everyone except Draco Malfoy of course. The small boy loses no opportunity to tease Harry. It's absolutely hilarious, particularly when Lucius brings his son over, stating that Draco interrupted his meeting to rant about Harry.
Draco looked stunning, his eyes blazing with fury and his whole body alert as he shouted "I WANT A DIVORCE. YOU ARE A CHEAT." Harry wanted to grab him and kiss him but he shouted "I AM NOT A BLOODY CHEAT AND I WON'T SIGN THE DAMN PAPERS."
For a moment, Harry was stunned because something was definitely wrong. Draco would not break down in front of him, not if he can help it and Harry was alarmed so he knelt down in front of him. Draco was sitting on his knees, his hands clenched into fists on his thighs as he stared at Harry, his eyes shining.
"You know I hate being held suddenly. You know that." Draco said bitterly and paused before continuing "Once again, you were too engrossed to remember what I need. As usual."
After what felt like hours but were only a few minutes, Draco stopped sobbing and pulled back to look at Harry. Their eyes met and held. Draco's eyes were red rimmed and his lips were trembling a bit and their were a few scars of burn here and there but he was still the most the most beautiful and important man of Harry's life and before he knew, he was leaning forwards to kiss Draco.
But there was no other alternative. He couldn't let them be burnt. He couldn't take it on his conscience. It was a few seconds later that he heard a knock on the door.
"Harry, we must talk about this." Finally Draco spoke and Harry shrugged "There is nothing to talk about. I had a difficult childhood. So what. They did not love me. At least I was not forced to –" Harry stopped to breathe before continuing " You are more important Draco. We must go to this event."
"Come on. Get up." Ron says and forces Harry to get up. Ron takes out his clothes and helps him inside the bathroom. Harry heaves a mental sigh. Atleast, he has his friends.
Draco's eyes narrowed. What was Black trying to tell him. Potter shouldn't be told about this. He should be asked whether he wanted to work with Draco. He most certainly would throw a tantrum on finding out that Draco was his new partner. But Draco didn't say any of this.
“Oh, and I love these.” He turned to a shelf in his bookcase, where Draco almost blushed to see his silly little wooden figures lined up.
After the third time of almost reaching for the diary, and forcing himself to remember his promises, he grabbed a quill and parchment and started a letter to his mother.
“Heard that's how you made the team.” He sounded proud, and Hal regretted even more not having been able to show him a bit more of what he was indeed capable of.
Draco briefly wondered if he’d find his parents in these rankings, and immediately decided he didn’t want to know either way. He gave Hermione a little pout.
She shrugged. “I don’t know.” Those weren’t words you’d often hear Hermione say, but she did not try to pretend she could have known. “I wouldn’t presume to know what the greatest wizard of our time gets up to, or what artefacts he may have use for.”
After confronting Hagrid, they had talked to Pan and Blaise about what they knew from their parents’ about the Chamber of Secrets, first edition, and Blaise had confirmed that it was known, in Pureblood circles, that Hagrid had been deemed responsible at the time, and it was also thought to be utterly ridiculous. Notwithstanding the fact that, albeit after spending some time in Azkaban, no proof had really been found against Hagrid, and Dumbledore giving him a job in a
intelligent objects were usually to be approached with caution, and Draco did almost put down the quill, but… he had nobody to talk to about this. His mother wouldn’t understand.
Hal huffed, unimpressed at himself. “I didn’t do it consciously. I froze.” He admitted. “My wand was like a useless stick in my hand, I had no idea what to do, I just thought… I just thought we needed protection, I guess.”
“What kind of monster petrifies people?” Anthony frowned, looking like he was going over a list of creatures he’d heard of in his head.
“And you believe him.” Hermione said at the end, less a question than an observation, but with something between sceptical and slightly judgmental in the tone of her voice.
“Before you go.” His Head of House held him back. “I wanted to check if you’d had any other issues, not strictly related to the potions’ effect which we have discussed.”
Hal and Hermione changed out of their school robes shortly before they arrived, and there was something weird about seeing them wearing colours that weren’t red and gold. Hermione’s outfit wasn’t that outrageous in itself, a grey pinafore dress and black tights, but she covered it with a
They carried on towards the Great Hall for dinner, and Hal pretended that had been nothing and he’d forgotten about it already, but he was unsettled. Because he was sure he’d heard the words, and they weren’t good words. He didn’t think any of the ghosts in the castle were particularly murderous – Bloody Baron aside, maybe, but even in his case his slaughtering spree days seemed to be over, since a few centuries ago. Hal had certainly never heard of him being a real threat, even if he scared the hell out of a lot of younger students, and being the only one able to knock some sense into Peeves certainly meant he had
He broke eye contact, looking down and shuffling some dried bird droppings and feathers with his foot.
After a short walk, they ended up by the lakeshore transfiguring pebbles into beetles – it wasn’t working that well, the spell would hold for about two minutes before you were looking at walking rocks, which stopped altogether shortly after that. They looked up as they heard footsteps, and came face to face with McGonagall, out on a walk, some epic tartanwear going on that they had to try very hard not to laugh at.
Flipping through the notebook, Draco was disappointed to see it was completely empty. Its dark leather cover did not bear any inscription other than the embossed name and address of the store it had been purchased in, and apart from a very faded name inside (T or J… M… Pridle? Rifle?), there were no notes at all on the yellowed paper.
“For telling me all this, I suppose. For putting things into perspective. It did make me feel better. I was this close to feeling sorry for myself.”
Draco froze mid laugh when Flint and two of his mates entered the common room. He tried to make himself smaller under the green blanket Blaise had thrown over his shoulders at some point (because the dungeons were bloody
“You’ve not been yourself.” Hal completed for him. “And Ron says it’s because you’ve been hanging out with Slytherins, and I
The Gryffindors dashed their way – McGonagall had already taken care of packing a bag for Hal, and a carrier for Little John Silver, but Hermione wanted to check she had included his phone so they could at least call him. Ron still had some of the stack of treats his mother had traditionally sent for his birthday and wanted to include some of that, and Neville as usual had some plant or herb he could think of with properties suiting the situation.
by the prospect of his physical proximity. Whether that was true of Ollie or not, it certainly didn’t help that Katie, Angelina and Alicia had all but swooned when they’d cross pass one day in and out of the changing rooms, when the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor team practice had followed one another.
“You’ve been dead for twelve years.” He threw back, breathless and starting to feel dizzy. “Swings and roundabouts.”
“Just getting it all out before I see Sirius.” Hal grinned back. “I don’t really know the details, but I know they hate each other.”
Over the next few days of finding the diary, he had had long conversations with Tom. It was liberating, thrilling and addictive to have someone (or at least an illusion of someone) he could tell absolutely everything to, with no fear of revealing too much, of offending or of being judged.
Hal did not miss the way he glanced briefly at him. Right. Black was supposedly after him. It would make sense for him to try to get to Hogwarts.
Christmas actually came around a lot quicker than expected – before they knew it, they were packing to go home for the holidays. It had been snowing for three days, and there was an air of excitement about. Draco did his best to pretend he was as wired up as the rest of them; in truth, he dreaded going back to his great empty home, he dreaded having to rack his brain to try and make conversation to his disinterested mother, he dreaded the ball, and he was going to miss his friends.
“They tend to be pretty fierce.” Rolf informed. “But they can be tamed, some magizoologists have knacks, you know? A bit like Muggles with lions.”
She shrugged. “Maybe not. I’m just saying, it wouldn’t surprise me, for Harry. He’s clearly got a good gene pool going for him.”
“I do, but then I went to badger Sev until he told me everything.” Draco had a bashful smile. “The version that is going around is that the ghost of You-Know-Who infiltrated the castle, possessed Quirrell, and kidnapped you to steal a weapon that was hidden on the third floor, but you disintegrated him.”
“No, I can’t, not casually if it’s to ask for his opinions as a Potion Master about how to go about a sex change.”
“Your family are Muggles, aren’t they?” Her disdain of that fact was still clear, but she was getting better at toning down her prejudice. “The only way they’ll get any idea what you can do here, is pictures. So get your fanboy to give them to you.”
So first here is a small prologue as a teaser, with some notes of what to expect in this fic further down.
The rest of January was… uneventful, compared to the first term. As the time since the last attack got longer, the pressure seemed to ease, people breathing a little more easily, walking a little less warily, eyeing Hal with a little less suspicion. Only Fred and George seemed to think that joke wasn’t getting old, and kept curtseying when they saw Hal and heralding him through the corridors if semi-hostile crowds still formed. It actually did wonders to defuse the tension, efficiently highlighting how ridiculous the whole idea was that little Hal, flanked by the goofy gangly twins, could in any way be a purveyor of great evil and petrification.
Still, in spite of the mounting pressure, Hal was enjoying practice. He loved flying, that wasn’t going away, and the competitive aspect challenged him in a good way. He really got along with the team as well – in spite of being by a minimum of two years the youngest, he didn’t feel like they were babying him.
Hal followed him in, feeling stupidly relieved when the man did not close the door on them. He went to his desk and picked up a book, which he handed him.
“It wasn’t your fault.” Hal shook his head. He paused, and sighed. There was no way around it. “I’m Harry Potter.”
Hal looked up, to the previously asleep man – Lupin – handing him a large chunk of chocolate. Reaching for it in a trembling hand and looking around, he saw that all his friends had a piece. They looked pale and shaken, though none of them was on the floor. Hal struggled to his feet, enough to drop himself back onto a seat.
“Oh, hey.” Dora suddenly said in a tone that was much lighter, albeit a little forced. “You also got a letter, Draco.”
She gathered her books and, true to her word, actually got up and left. Neville watched her go somewhat anxiously, while the remaining boys were pressing their lips together and trying not to laugh until she was well out of sight and earshot.
“Why the two of you?” Neville asked, as Ron’s jaw was hanging too low for him to voice the question.
A woman joined her, her mother in all likelihood, and the child started shaking her arm frenetically.
and could not find a better method of transport than rail. Hal shoved him playfully, and that was probably about as emotional as it would get.
“Hal, don’t be ridiculous!” She whispered furiously. “We have no idea what’s going on, you’re not going to just go after him!”
She had a shocked look on her face, her hand stretched out as if she’d been holding something in front of her face. Anthony spotted a round pocket mirror on the bedside table, and when he tried, it fit perfectly between her frozen fingers.
He fully opened his eyes, helped in the process by someone – Neville, once he could see – placing his glasses on his face. Ron was indeed at the foot of the bed, peering at him anxiously. On each of his sides were the rest of this friends, Hermione holding one of his hands, and Draco the other. A few feet away, Mrs Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall were standing talking quietly, and they stopped and came nearer as they heard the others make happy noises.
. He knew it wasn’t that surprising to miss his friends, the first true friends he’d ever really had, after spending nine months seeing them every day, but if he was honest with himself, he didn’t miss Anthony, or Hermione, or Ron or Neville, half as much as he missed Hal.
Pan had a shaky laugh, but when he looked up to Mr Goldstein, it was with the full confidence of his education.
Hal briefly wondered what it said about him that he saw a big, loving family, with his parents still alive. He guessed at least it said something better than if he had seen himself covered in fame and riches. Which, come to think of it, he already was. Didn’t feel so desirable. Dumbledore continued, stopping his thoughts from spiralling.
“Yeah.” Hal nodded calmly, showing more perceptiveness than she had given him credit for. “I got that impression too.”
me, Hermione. I know you can see it too. You told me as much last year. Most brilliant wizard of his age and he wants to pretend he had no idea how to sort any of this mess? Come off it. Then I just
“I think so.” Draco admitted. “Pretty early, anyway. I think I already knew, part of me at least, when my father was still alive.”
“It’ll take some people more time to get used to it.” Anthony commented. “Or they might even never get it. Ignore them, mate.”
“Nobody really said much.” Harry sighed. “They just seem to know who I am, and several people have told me how much I look like my father.”
By lunchtime, Hal was officially the new Gryffindor Seeker, and the youngest Quidditch player in a century.
Hermione stopped dead in her tracks. “Rolf, your cousin?” They had seen him around a few times, as Anthony greeted and talked to him. “His grandfather is Newton Scamander?”
Oliver gave him a look, and Hal was pretty sure Fred and George snorted behind them, but nothing else was said as Lee announced the team and they flew out to the pitch.
“Yes.” A young man said with determination, and the tone alone told Draco this was Pansy. “Let’s go.”
“Quite.” Nick smiled somewhat smugly. “Would you like to come to my party? I must say, a lot of us ghosts are rather intrigued by you, Harry Potter. I have some friends, in particular, who have succumbed to the Killing Curse, and would very much like to meet you. The esteemed members of the Headless Hunt are bound to be most impressed.”
“As far as I can tell.” Dumbledore’s voice piped up. “The troll attacked and Mister Potter did a remarkable job with a shielding spell for him and Mister Malfoy, while Mister Goldstein – quite bravely I may say – fired a number of stinging hexes at its back. Then you arrived, Severus, and…”
This one hit home, and Quirrell danced uncontrollably for, sadly, only a few seconds before he cast something to end the spell, and with an angry snarl, barked
“Mister Potter.” She seemed surprised to see him, but smiled as he pushed the door open. “What can I do for you?”
, and he’s not bothered Draco since. So.” His lips set in a determined pout, daring her to argue with that.
Hermione presented Neville with a pocket watch, which he looked rather discomfited with until she turned it over for him, and it revealed itself to be essentially the wizard version of a Swiss army knife. Apart from genuinely telling the time on one of its faces, it had a compass, a magically “bigger on the inside” flask compartment that could contain up to 500 ml of water or potion, an emergency wand repair kit, a small knife and a shrinkable blanket. It seemed a little too adventurous for Neville, until your remembered his passion for Herbology had, several times before, seen him trek up into the forest behind his house at midnight to collect this or other plant that only grew under the moonlight in its ascending phase, or something. The only reason he didn’t do the same at Hogwarts was the rather terrifying nature of the forest, and the fact that sneaking out of the castle in the middle of the night was rather frowned upon.
“Yeah.” Hal smiled, opening his eyes again to look at him. They were very green, Draco through stupidly. “Just tired.”
A garden party was a little too casual for full dress robes, but nicely tailored suits certainly made an appearance, as did bespoke dresses on the ladies. The thought of parading in yet another new dress made Pan slightly nauseous, but the idea of a new
Madam Pomfrey rushed to his side to examine his arm, casting a few other charms over it – cleaning and diagnosis, Draco guessed – and turning it this way and other.
“I know that.” Hal sighed. “If nothing else, we’ve seen Peeves mess up with enough shit to know that.” He shook his head. “But I’ve never heard of any ghost going around petrifying cats.”
She vaguely remembered one of Lily’s letters mentioning something like that – she’d honeymooned with James around the Mediterranean. Marge made a derogatory
It came again, and Hal knew for sure he hadn’t imagined it the first time. It was chilling, a barely human whisper, but the words themselves could turn out to be a good thing. If he had a use, he wouldn’t be disposed of as quickly as possible.
“How’s Hal?” Hermione asked Draco as she took a seat at the Ravenclaw table for lunch, completely ignoring the way Mandy was glaring at her like she wanted her to drop dead, and starting to help herself to food.
“Hal.” He supposed he didn’t mind people calling him that, and something told him after his experience in Diagon Alley that giving his full name would not necessarily be his best move, until he knew what exactly his parents had been famous for in this world. “Three brothers, hey?” He diverted the attention back to the other boy, for now. “You must know what to expect a lot better than us. Well, than me.” He amended honestly. “Hermione has read the
“I should probably go.” Petunia said. “Ley is threatening to cook if I don’t want to do it, and we both know it wouldn’t end well.”
, but he decided to let that go to focus instead on the ridiculous cartoonish simplification of a lightning bolt Ron clearly had in mind.
“Did you ever see actual lightning?” He tried not to sound too condescending. “If so, yeah, I suppose it does.”
Him and Hermione proceeded in trying to get neared the front of the queue, Lockhart’s works under their arm for signing – at least, Hal thought, they weren’t buying them just for the sake of an autograph, since they were indeed on their school supply list. In doing so, they created a movement in the crowd so that, for a moment, their line of sight to the book signing table was completely free.
Flint hadn’t done or said anything to that, though that probably had been because the rest of the Slytherin teams had started filling the corridor and Draco had skedaddled as fast as his legs could carry him while maintaining dignity. He’d had the mad hope that that would be it, for a couple of hours. He was able to enjoy the game, cheer the Gryffindors on, watch them get well on their way to winning. He didn’t think much of it when Slytherins multiplied fouls, because that was they always did, Flint wasn’t the first captain to encourage that. They only got nastier as the game went on – it wasn’t unusual.
Hermione turned to Hal like she’d proven a point. “We wouldn’t know, would we? Side by side worlds, you’d think a whole war would be noticed, but no. I was fascinated to read about it.”
“And I thought you and Draco might have something.” Ley carried on. “Though I thought it must be the whole ‘Oh we almost died together’ disaster.”
Fred and George, in fact, found Hal enjoying the silent emptiness of the Trophy Room, the first place he’d found to be away from people. They still had a subdued look about them, which, Hal had to agree with Ron, did not suit them.
Obviously, it was in that exact moment that Gilderoy Lockhart looked up, and his brilliant smile froze on his lips as his eyes fell upon Hal.
“Exactly why you should talk it through with your brilliant and knowledgable cousin.” Ley nodded solemnly.
“Ew, no, shut up. It’s Fred and George’s birthday on the first, and they’re having a party at home at the start of the holiday. They wanted to invite the whole Quidditch team.”
The hardest part about exams had probably been managing Hermione’s stress, and the fallout of comments such as “it’s only exams”; although if the boys were honest with themselves, her intensity had probably helped kick them into gear a little, and they all most likely did a little better than they would have had without her inflexibility.
When Hal looked slightly sheepish, she knew she’d guessed right, but it was only fleeting before he looked furious again.
“We can’t start running around.” Draco immediately said. “I know it’s Lupin and he's a great teacher and we like him, but right now he’s a wild beast, Hal, you know that.”
“I was interested to notice you were friends with Mister Malfoy.” He mused. “It could be a very good influence on him.”
“It has been brought to my attention.” He said. “That I may have treated you with… unfair prejudice.”
On the other side, his mom seemed to be laughing with her sister, and Hal’s breath was taken away at how beautiful she was, how beautiful they both were. Petunia looked younger, carefree, her blond hair a halo around her head, and Hal’s other grandparents were standing in the background too, looking proud and kind. Vernon was conspicuously absent
She didn’t brush it off his forehead like Draco’s mother had done for him; Draco suspected that was a habit she’d had to force herself not to get into, in order not to expose Hal’s scar.
It slipped through his lips. He had not called her that in years, but then neither had she called him
“Hal, look.” Hermione suddenly waved something in his face, clearly having reached the limit of containing herself while the others talked, and jumping into the breach left in the conversation by everyone laughing.
“You pick on him constantly.” Draco argued. “Maybe he would do better in class if he wasn’t spending it in a constant state of terror.”
Petunia nodded defeatedly. Marge never went anyway without one of the beasts – and really, Petunia didn’t have anything against bulldogs at large, but Marge always seemed to bread the nastiest creatures. She always made some excuse regarding why she just couldn’t have left this or that one with her neighbour with the others.
It made sense; apart from shopping in Diagon Alley, they probably hadn’t had a chance to visit many magical places before. Draco had never been to Hogsmead itself, but he could imagine it based on trips with his mother to other towns and villages that were a hundred percent Wizard (Narcissa had opened up recently, but she was still a Pureblood, and she had standards regarding her leisure and shopping environment, and what she exposed her son to, at least when Draco was growing up).
Now he had to laugh. Whatever the odds were, whoever won, he very much doubted it would get Pan an amount that would make a difference to Draco. It wasn’t like he wanted for anything.
In the first theory, Hal had picked Colin because he was annoyed at the constant harassment. In the second, Flint had picked Colin in retaliation after his altercation with Hal, to show him that he’d target the ‘followers’ of whoever challenged him.
That was, if there was a later – Lockhart was babbling something about not being able to let them go now. Monologuing (about how he had grown to be an expert in memory charms from years of taking the credit for other people’s exploits) like one of those great villains in the plays Draco’s mother would take him to see as a kid. Didn’t usually end well for them, though.
Pan looked at him for a long few minutes, a little frown on her face as if she was considering trying to talk him out of this nonsense. In the end, she shook her head slowly, and spoke almost kindly, almost sadly.
“Your aunt…” Draco trailed off, realising he knew nothing else about Harry’s current family situation.
“Homosexuality is a weird thing among Purebloods.” Hermione said. “What?” She adopted an innocent stance when everyone started at her. “I read about it. I guess it’s a bit like… royalty for Muggles, maybe? Maintaining the bloodline is crucial. Bastards are unacceptable. So on the one hand, I think some young Purebloods are advised to, well, relieve their urges with someone of the same sex to avoid inconvenient pregnancies. On the other hand, a same-sex
Going by the way Anthony turned his nose up at the sight, he was thinking the same. “We are getting you a red one.” He resolved.
“I’m aware.” Draco snorted. “If you’re worried he wouldn’t get his arse handed to him, trust me, I won’t be the one doing him any favours.”
“I can’t say I’m pleased to see you back here, Mister Potter.” Pomfrey told him, her tone not quite managing to be scolding. “But I am glad to see you awake. Can you tell me what happened, so I can give you the best possible treatment?”
Draco snapped back to his present gasping for air, the vision of Hagrid and the horrifying creature he thought would make a good pet still swimming beneath his eyelids. He barely managed to read as new words appeared on the page, Tom explaining that the events caused by Hagrid were terribly unfortunate, and that a group of Slytherins had dug up the Chamber of Secrets legend, having heard it all their lives from their families, and had superimposed the spooky messages and rumours to events they actually had no control over.
He didn’t care right now who the boy was or how he knew his name. He wanted Draco to be alright and he wanted to hell out of here – in any order.
“Auntie, you okay?” Harry broke her out of her reverie. He was a very intuitive kid, Petunia had noticed. Not the most academic, going by his school grades (though a lot of that could be due to his and Ley’s constant goofing around) but he was perceptive and quick to react. She thought he’d probably make a good policeman, or detective. She wondered if the magical world had an equivalent.
Hal stopped listening again as Lockhart went on about the many times he’d had to use one spell or other to save himself (and, probably, a damsel in distress, ten orphans and a puppy. Either that or an entire village). A duelling club was actually a good idea, surprisingly, given its provenance.
Hal just shrugged, and ran back out to play with Ley and the dog. As soon as he joined them, the dog crowded back to him, and as Petunia watched them play, she noticed he stuck to Hal a lot more than he did Ley. She had noticed the same trend with Little Silver, and thought it was mostly because Hal took the cat to school and it was more familiar with his presence than with Ley’s and hers, but maybe Hal was also just good with animals. He had mentioned picking
Since she’d been there, she had kept exchanging looks with Draco, opening her mouth and them seemingly deciding otherwise. They all turned to her, and even Hal raised his head from within his folded arms and looked at her expectantly.
“Chaser.” Sirius confirmed. “I tried out for Keeper in fourth year, but I actually wasn't very good.” He added with a chuckle.
“No, sir.” Neville replied, chastised but with still the hint of a smile. It certainly was the most bravado he’d ever shown in front of the Potions Master. “It’s just… fitting.”
It was dinner time. Draco pleaded with Hal the entire way to the Great Hall, but he charged on like an Erumpent, and only stopped at the Slytherin table.
“Hey, my cousin is up there.” Anthony chastised. After a short pause, he added. “He’ll be fine, though. Bet he’s loving it. Channelling his grandfather’s energy or something.”
He wasn’t exactly accustomed to spending time with Half-Bloods, let alone Muggles, and had no idea what the etiquette really was there. Certainly not
“Maybe it seems like the best solution sometimes.” She conceded. In fact, the way Hal life was turning out, a little voice in the back of her head told her it was probably a good thing that he could fend for himself. “But promise me this will never be a habit, or your
“Oh, there you are. We were wondering where you’d gone off to.” He only then seemed to notice how pale and shaky Draco looked. “You alright?”
“If you can stand sitting with Ravenclaws, a Muggleborn and people I’m sure your father would call blood traitors.” Draco told her drily.
“Okay, we both go, we can cover each other’s back. Sorry, mate.” He added, turning to Ron. “But if we want to stay under the cloak...”
“With all due respect, Albus.” Fudge replied drily. “Your school is warded, and it hasn’t been most secure, of late. The governors have been writing me! The public!”
With an apologetic sigh, Ron also announced his mom had insisted to knit them each a sweater, and they found themselves laughing till their stomachs hurt once they’d all put them on and were proudly displaying their respective initial – Hal and Hermione had debated which was meant to be whose, and Ron hadn’t known, or cared, and in the end it didn’t really matter as they were all the same size, and neither of them was an offending pink or anything like that.
“How did you know I wouldn’t miss?” Angelina asked Fred when Oliver let them go to hug and sob on other players.
“Oh. No, I hadn’t even thought of that. I don’t think what happened then has anything to do with Harry’s power, I doubt any one year-old would have that kind of magic either way. No, because his parents were really talented.”
Some of the flavours were the same, and others were local and met more or less of a success – fresh baguette, croissant and macaron and most of the pâtisserie flavours among the best rated by all three boys, “oil paint” and “cigarette butt” among the worst, while savoury flavours like onion soup, snails in garlic butter and boeuf bourgignon divided them (Draco thought they were lovely, Hal and Ley thought they were just weird). All three of them were more intrigued than delighted by the cheese and wine flavours, figuring they were maybe more adult tastes. They did not even discuss “French kiss”.
“I mean hurting myself.” She told him reassuringly. “Sometimes I honestly just fall. My father’s been teaching me about first aid since I was just a little girl. He always says you practically have to be a Healer before you can reasonably become a Magizoologist.”
"I was your best friend. I have always been. You never told me." Severus muttered, his voice devoid of any emotion and Lucius replied curtly, "He did not want anyone to know. He wanted to keep it a secret. Though I did not care about him-" Lucius stopped speaking and Harry realized that Lucius was lying through his teeth, "-I didn't want my parents to know."
"Of course," Draco gave a harsh, derisive laugh, "Why would he come on time? He probably thinks that he's the only one whose time is important."
What does he want? Harry wondered and knew that he won't get any answer from Draco even if he asked.
"Thank you." She murmurs. Harry stares at Draco's frozen form. What's he doing? This's not fair to Ginny.
"Do you love him enough to go against your own godfather, to trust him over everyone else, no matter who they are?" Came the question and Harry's eyebrows rose in surprise.
"I was in the middle of something, Percy. I need to leave," said Potter. Creevy pleaded, "Please, this is the last one."
With these words, he was gone and Harry closed his eyes. He had known that Severus had always seen mum in him and had missed her.
" Draco I am not angry at you. But you need to trust me. I am not going to leave - " Harry broke off because Draco was not sitting in front of him. He was behind Harry, his hands inside Harry's shirt and his lips on Harry's neck. Though Harry did not want to stop Draco, he knew that he must.
"Narcissa please calm down. Death eaters are swarming outside." He murmurs, knelt on his knees in front of her. She doesn't stop screaming.
All of a sudden, Draco's eyes shot open and his silver eyes fell on his hands. Harry was confused when Draco sat up and looked all around him, as if expecting something else. Then Draco did the most astonishing and alarming thing. He hugged himself and closed his eyes. A sob escaped his mouth and Harry finally asked "What's the matter. Draco? It did not seem that you had a nightmare."
For instance, when he entered the kitchen, Draco's crestfallen face appeared to the forefront of his mind ...
Scorpius looks at him with eyes that are like his father, except that they are warm and pure, unlike Malfoy's deceptive ones. Scorpius picks Harry's hand and presses a kiss on the back before placing it back on the table.
Harry smiled a bit and opened his arms wide "Come." He whispered and Draco simply stared at him for a couple of seconds. Their eyes met and though the helplessness was still there, the panic had gone away and Draco got up to fall in his arms desperately.
His eyes were burning but he ignored it. When he peaked at the Weasley twins and Longbottom from the corner of his eyes, he found them frozen on their places, wearing identical expressions on their faces.
Resisting the urge to slam his head in the wall because how was he supposed to live in this castle with Potter for an indefinite future without going utterly mad. She was utterly infuriating. He washed his hands and walked out of the bathroom and found himself standing in front of a bespectacled man with a scar on his forehead and brilliant green eyes. It was so obvious that he was a Potter but that was impossible because Potters had a daughter and she had replaced her glasses with contacts just before her marriage.
"DRACO." DRACO. What's the matter?" But Draco was not moving. His eyes were closed. "God damnit Draco. Wake up." He shouted and shook Draco's chest wildly.
All of a sudden, Harry felt all the fight leaving his body. He did not want to fight with Draco. He had been protecting himself against Vernon ever since he had been capable. But he had been a defenceless baby once and Vernon had attempted to violate him. Had he not had magic to defend himself, the monster would have succeeded. Many a time, Vernon's words haunted him.
Draco stayed quiet. Harry turned a bit to check if he was listening. Draco was looking outside silently. But he kissed Harry's neck and Harry realized that Draco was listening to everything.
"You are my world. Where will I go without you? I love you so much Draco." He whispered and Draco studied his face for some deception. Once upon a time, it might have frustrated Harry but it did not annoy him anymore.
For a moment Draco wondered if his scars disgusted Harry and would have asked that question. But he caught himself when he noticed that Harry's eyes were narrowing as if he could read Draco's thoughts very clearly.
No. Was he interfering in her life. No. He was minding his own business. He was being decent and leaving her to own devices and had expected her to do the same. He whirled around and stopped, crossing his arms on his chest. The sound of her footsteps stopped.
"FUCK. TWISTED BASTARD." Harry cursed and Draco said resolutely "We have to go Harry and quickly at that. We don't have time. She is only ten."
His eyes were burning fiercely and he shook his eyes to prevent the tears from falling. He was not raped.
When Harry was done with both nipples, they were hard and tight and Draco was looking at him with lust in his eyes. There was a silent plea in those silver eyes too, a plea to reduce the pain, the pain that only Harry saw in those eyes, that he saw daily and couldn't do anything to reduce it.
"But it's my birthday." Harry whined and reached for the glass. It was Saturday night and the club was packed and it was his birthday. He was fortunate that at least Blaise had stuck with him. Hermione and Ron had quit a year ago.
"She might be pregnant Harry, pregnant with Lord Voldemort's child." She says after a couple of minutes pass and Harry stares at her, his eyes wide.
He hadn't thought that he would get attached to this little child and he hadn't wanted to get attached. He can't afford it. Of course, fate had something else in store for him. Severus will never understand why Harry's not afraid of him. Weasley's children tremble and hide whenever they come across Severus. Only Draco isn't afraid of him and that's because Draco's not afraid of anyone.
It had been out of question really. Harry would never let what happened to him happen to another child. He would never be so cruel. Tessa had been quite matured till now but her body was trembling when he hugged her. He wondered why and so still at the entryway, he pulled back, asking softly "What happened? Why are you crying?" Tears were streaming down her eyes and she shook her head quietly.
"After we are done over here, I will tell you all the options you have Dudley." He spoke and as if on cue, the door was knocked again and Draco entered in, his face red with fury. Tessa was in his arms, her face streaked with tears on Draco's shoulders and Harry was alarmed because Draco's eyes had never been so bloody murderous.
"Lord Potter was in the royal garden when he was captured by Lord Malfoy's men." They said in a monotone. She stared at them and her heart started racing. It dawned upon her very suddenly Lucius would take this opportunity to take over their empire. On one hand, she wanted to go and rescue father and on the other hand, she knew that she would have to stay and take some decisions, decisions that should have been taken when she had first noticed the signs of father's downfall.
"Harry what's the matter?" Hermione repeats and Harry backs off after a muttered, "Come over. We need to talk."
"Just touch it with your hand say 'Godric's hollow' and it will take you there. Once you reach there, it will turn into a normal bracelet. Please make yourself at home over there. I-" He stops and gets up before taking off his robe and placing it on her back. She holds her arm on either side and helps him put it on her. He buttons it up and then takes out something from his pocket. He flicks his fingers and it enlarges into a cloak.
Someone knocks his door and he presses the quill a bit too hard on the parchment. The nib breaks and Severus drawls, "Enter."
Harry wonders what the matter really is. There is no dark lord and Lucius is anyway not dark now. He is running many orphanages and hospitals. He burned the manor down and built it from scratch. Harry has never been inside but it's rumored to be the most beautiful house in Britain. It's rumored to have innumerable windows and paid house elves. Harry doesn't understand why Scorpia and Malfoy are not happy. Nott was a git but he wasn't evil.
"I love him sir. I know that you are his godfather and that you still despise me for what dad did though I am not completely sure what he really did. But I really do love Draco and I will defeat Voldemort. If Draco gets marked, where will that lead him. He is too talented to waste his life in Azkaban. I might be able to pull the strings and get him released but his career will be ruined and he will have to waste many years in redeeming himself. I can't have that happen because I want to spend my life with him once all this is over." The girl mutters in a single breath and Severus's eyes widen. She is so confident that she will defeat the most powerful and dakest wizard of all time and apparently, she has decided that he will spend his life with his-
As usual, he reached Gremmauld completely pissed. He moved towards the stairs, stumbling along the way. He should have known better then trusting himself on the stairs when he was completely drunk.
Draco's trousers tightened uncomfortably when he heard the desire in Harry's voice. He moaned when Harry teased his nipple with the tip of his tongue.
Harry knelt in front of Draco and held his shoulders. "Draco. It's fine. We will take one step at a time."
Their faces wear similar expressions - Weasley is looking very white and Granger's eyes are bright. Black is glaring at father whereas mother's eyes are damp. Severus- he is difficult to read. He is gazing out of the window. One part of my mind wonders if he is even listening but the other part can read signs of rage in his posture, the way his hands are clenched in tight fists, the way his teeth are gritted, the way his eyes are twin pools of simmering rage.
The main door of his house was open and his alarm increased. When he entered and looked around, he found the kitchen door closed, which was odd. So he decided to look into the kitchen first.
Draco wondered if Harry's decision would change once he realizes who was actually responsible, rather, who were responsible for Draco's fate.
"I am not a virgin anymore. No bloody sheets in the morning." She mutters bluntly, her body still turned away from him. He closes his eyes to control his temper. It won't do to lose his temper in front of her. She isn't well and will take it otherwise.
"Harry." Draco said and Harry did not look at him. He had no strength left now to quarrel with him. But when hands grasped his cheeks, he had to turn to look into his husband's eyes.
"NO, GET OUT. OUT. GET OUT YOU BASTARD." Draco's eyes shot open when he heard these words. He turned his head and saw Harry shouting on the top of his voice, beads of perspiration trickling down his cheeks.
Draco returned a few minutes later and scent of his shampoo was all around Harry. The urge to take him in his arms and breath in his neck was so strong that Harry had turn his back towards Draco and clench his hands into fists.
Draco's eyes were soft and Harry had just opened his mouth but Draco beat him to it "I know that you do not want to talk about Dursleys and that you are hiding some things from me about your childhood. You are not exactly very forgiving Harry. I don't think that you forgave your uncle easily for what he did." Harry could prevent his eyes from flashing angrily. He had never forgiven Vernon for what he had attempted to do. He had vowed vengeance against the bastard after having defeating Voldemort but then he had started searching for Draco and it had been postponed. Draco continued "I want to know everything and you can ask me anything you wish."
"They led you to that hotel and you were raped. I want to punish them. " Harry whispered and it was like there was no one except them. Draco sat looking on his lap and whispered very softly "I was not raped. I wasn't" His throat burned and his eyes burned and now the twins and Longbottom were sitting in front of him but he vehemently denied "I was not raped. I provided them a service and they paid."
"I would never fight with you again. I hate fighting with you. I would rather make love with you." Harry spoke softly and Draco averted his face away from the git, red.
He did not answer. Draco waited for the rant or lashing out that always escaped Harry's mouth when Draco accused him but it never came.
Hermione glares at him and he glares right back and Harry knows that they will keep on bickering if Harry doesn't speak out.
" Okay " Harry said and Draco placed his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry could clearly see that Draco was upset and something was stopping him from revealing everything to Harry. He would try again and again and he will keep on trying until Draco told him.
Harry smiles as he relives his son's red ears and nervous green eyes. He still has a couple of hours. Kids have gone to visit Molly so the elves have enough time. Harry stands under a shed and looks at the rain. It's beautiful and soothing.
He had expected Draco to sneer or shout at him. He had not expected what happened next. Draco cast a cleaning charm and cleaned the floor and then shoved Harry hard. Harry fell down on the floor and Draco straddled him, placing his legs on either side of Harry's hips.
So he spent the day sleeping in his room which seemed so big and empty. Actually, the whole house seemed empty and it was difficult to stay alone in it with Draco's parting words haunting his mind.
Scorpius chuckles, amused and his eyes sparkle again, "I know that you will. Take care, Mr. Potter. Goodbye."
. I can't believe it," Harry Potter snorted and then laughed loudly, "What are you - five? I am not going to let you live it down."
Why were his eyes shining with unshed tears as his aunt sobbed on his shirt mumbling "I am sorry. So very sorry. I should have loved you. I punished a child. Lily will never forgive me."
Harry was slightly surprised. Had it always been so easy to cool Draco down? Why had he never accepted his mistake?
Harry stares at the man knelt in front of him in complete shock. It's like Harry's mind is collapsing. How could Lucius have done this. Draco is his daughter. Harry is not in a position to speak anything. His heart is thundering inside his chest and he is sweating in terror because there is only one thing that the dark lord might need from her.
"If I didn't love dad and you so much, I would have left this house when I was five. I would have run away and lived Mr Dumbledore or hell, Mr Snape. Please do not remind me of that day," Dudley said and his voice was just so pained that Petunia fell silent.
Sweet Merlin, mum was breaking and now he could hear sobbing. His mother was crying openly. How could he bear it? His parents had held him when he had cried and now it was his responsibility of caring for them.
He shrugs in response and Harriet's sudden arrival prevents him from saying anything. She has an art file in her hands and pencil and crayons too.
Harry keeps his eyes glued on his book. He doesn't look at the blonde, not even when he sits down besides Harry.
"But I was with you in the initial years of our marriage, Draco." Harry frowned and Draco looked away "But you did not know about my problems. Now you know and support me." His stiffened back loosened when he felt Harry's hand on his lower back. "That I do. Try this. It is delicious."
Draco decides to answer honestly, "Father kicked me out when I refused to marry. I was studying for my potions mastery."
Sirius shook his head and his smile faltered, "I'll tell him today. Don't worry about him, Draco. He won't make a fuss."
She eats it quietly. Potter serves something for himself after a few minutes. She doesn't look at him.
"You're looking like your mother," he says and is not surprised that his voice is hoarse, "she was a veela."
They had had sex in the initial years of their marriage and Harry had never seen the scars of a knife penetration. This meant that Draco had hidden them. He could have removed Draco's pants himself but Draco was simply not ready for any sexual intimacy and after watching those photos, Harry thought that Draco needed to interact with more people. They had remained cooped for very long and Harry had been irresponsible. He should have asked Draco. Of course he was still in trauma. Of course he had not healed. He had been abused and manipulated.
"You're always a very good boy, Harry." Severus mutters honestly and the child's lips stretch in a wide smile.
"I wish I could. I wanted it but still I didn't want it." Draco whispered and Harry closed his eyes, regretting his stupid words.
Finally Draco breathes deeply and looks at him, searching his eyes for a trace of lie. On finding none, he replies, "Okay." and embraces Harry. Harry sighs in relief, his hands wrapping around Draco's waist. He places his head on Draco's head and murmurs, "Today is going to a hard day Draco and I want you to trust me. I want you to believe it when I say that I love you and won't leave you, no matter what. it will give you strength to fight whosoever you have to. After that we have to visit Neville and then we have search for an appropriate building for the academy as well. I have been receiving owls inquiring as to when will I open it. How will I go through today if you don't trust me. It's high time you resumed the potion making business as well Draco. You have worked so hard."
"Just go. I don't wish to talk about it anymore." Severus murmurs adamantly and averts his eyes. Potter leaves and closes the door behind her, her long and curly hair flowing behind her.
Something had been nagging Harry. Something was compelling him to return to Draco. Four hours had passed and he had been wanting to see Draco for the last half an hour.
Many a time, when Draco over worked at night, Harry had brought his breakfast in bed the next morning. He shared his achievements , his dreams with Draco and Draco was so happy with him. But the fact that he could not even give kids to him was eating him from inside. The longing that he saw on Harry's face to make love to him was killing him.
"Draco." A soft voice reached him. It was entirely different from other voices that haunted him. "Draco. Please listen to me."
Tears trickled down his cheeks when Draco still did not open his eyes. He stopped shaking the man's chest and just stared at him.
Draco had barely spoken to Harry at all. Two days had passed and Harry had tried to talk to him but he had not found the strength in him to talk. He had not hurt himself and had stayed away from any sharp object. He had cast cleaning charms on him so that he won't subject his body to boiling water.
"I was frightened and my accidental magic came to my aid, blasting him to the opposite wall. He ran away and - and then he tried again after a couple of days. This time I was sleeping and it was early morning. He entered and removed my blanket and then removed my pajamas. I was fast asleep. His cold hands woke me up and I tried to struggle but he was stronger and pinned me and spanked my hips hard before biting my left hip and trying to insert fingers inside by anus again but I blasted him apart again. That is why I used to lock my bath room and bed room. One night he tried to mix something in my juice so that I lose consciousness but I did not drink it. That is why I always check when offered anything from anyone. He tried many times and then I came to Hogwarts and he was afraid after that. Once I was preparing breakfast in the kitchen and he spanked by bottom hard before squeezing my hips. I glared at him and he backed off, scared of my magic. I -" Draco was not lying on the bed anymore. He had sat up straight and hugged Harry tightly "Why did you never tell me? Sweet Merlin. Did he ever, ummm do that?"
The desire to catch Ginny and Sirius and whosoever was responsible for what happened to Draco was so strong that he wanted to get up and strangle his own godfather in his sleep. He was only a bit away from getting up and running towards Sirius to torture the information out of him.
"You are like Lily." Aunt said and his eyes focussed and blurred as he looked at her. "I will tell you about her. I have her albums, you know. I hid them years ago so that no one finds them. I will give them to you. I found her journals as well though I never peaked inside until Dudley told me about Vernon. You are like her because she wrote that she forgave me for everything I said and that she loved me even if I was angry with her. Of course she did not use the word jealous. I am sorry Harry because I hurt you just because you were a wizard. I paid for my sins though. Dudley never got to visit Hogwarts. Lily wrote that it is beautiful and Tessa has been living in fear."
"I have realized my mistake. Forgive me." Draco spoke and Harry looked at him, really looked into his eyes this time and spoke "But you do not trust me."
"Stop. Please stop Draco." It was Harry who was not sitting behind him now. His cheeks were streaked with tears. He had somehow shifted in front of him and was wiping Draco's eyes. Draco wondered why because he was not crying, was he?
Harry lays back down on the grass and stares up at the dark sky. He loves Draco. He loves Draco so much that it's frankly terrifying and right now he is very worried for his boyfriend. He wonders why he was summoned by his parents on such a short notice. The stars are hidden somewhere behind the black cloud that is stretched above. Harry closes his eyes and tries to imagine that Draco is beside him, playing with his hair or grumbling about mundane things. Harry could spend a lifetime gazing into his intoxicating eyes.
Draco stared at him for a few moments. Weasley didn't say anything. Draco waited for the man to say that he was just joking but he didn't.
He yawned again and removed the blanket to get up. That was the moment when his eyes fell upon the tray containing his breakfast. It had a warming charm on it. His heart swelled for Harry. Harry had not been so thoughtful in the initial years of their marriage.
"I don't care about Pansy and Tessa is a little girl and we need to protect her." Draco lied because he did care. She was his friend.
"Let's go." James murmurs and Scorpius smiles at the nervous man. James runs a hand through his hair and messes them even more than they already were.
Albus Dumbledore is sitting rigidly on a chair, staring at her with horror. He has joined all the dots. Of course he has. Draco doesn't remember a single instance when she saw Dumbledore so horrified. Maybe he didn't know then, after all.
"Goo- Goodbye Draco." Harry whispered and moaned before falling hard on the floor. By the time Draco came out of his stupor, Harry had already fallen unconscious.
They approached the dais and stood in front of it. Draco finally looked at Lucius and Narcissa. Narcissa's eyes were wet with tears, though her face was determined. Lucius was looking sad. He continued when his eyes met Draco's "I am sorry for failing you. My single wrong decision destroyed your past and I am so proud that you did not let it affect your future Draco. You are a strong man and I just- your mother and I am so proud of you. I wish that you would visit your old man and mum. And that's all. I won't take further time of yours. Please enjoy your night."
"Why?" Harry asked "Why would I be angry? I had just thought that it would be good for the advancement of your potions career too. You would be able to increase your customer base this way but its ok."
Harry looked to see the sender's name and Draco saw the faint tremble in Harry's hands and he felt rage emanating from his body.
Severus stares at the child. Harry does this sometimes. He calls him 'father' and Sirius 'dad' and never ceases to amaze him. How did he end up as a father of Potter's five year old, naughty, adorable and intelligent son. Being a father or having a family was never in the cards for him.
"MADNESS. You are calling this madness, Draco." His voice was soft but no less dangerous. "THIS IS NOT FUCKING MADNESS." Draco was jumped in surprise when Harry shouted abruptly. "You don't even stop to think what your death will do to me. Just return and kill yourself, eh? The end. Harry can go to ruddy hell. It does not matter that I can not live without you. It does not matter that I will go insane, INSANE WITHOUT YOU. IT DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER THAT I, HARRY POTTER-" Harry slapped his own chest so hard that Draco swallowed and tried to speak but Harry beat him to it "-WILL NOT LOVE ANYONE EXCEPT YOU, NO MATTER WHAT. NO, WHAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU THINK THAT-" Draco jerked when Harry poked his chest with his finger, tears streaming down his eyes " -THAT I WILL BE HAPPY WITH YOU GONE, THAT I WILL BE HAPPIER WITH ANOTHER MAN. IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT YOU ARE MY LIFE, MY STRENGTH, MY EVERYTHING, THAT YOU ARE IRREPLACEABLE, THAT NO ONE CAN EVER TAKE YOUR PLACE IN MY LIFE OR MY HEART. WHAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU WANT ME TO BLOODY MOVE ON."
"He won't." The voice is soft but panicked, "We should - we should break it off. It's getting out of hand."
Fred backed off, raising his hands in surrender, murmuring, "Sorry. Sorry. It was a friendly kiss only, dear sis-in-law."
But then the door opens and reveals Potter. She is so shocked and relieved that she shoots up. The blanket pools on her lap.
Without giving aunt Sierra and uncle Severus any opportunity to say anything, she said, "I know that this is too much to ask of both of you but we don't have any other alternative. Uncle Severus can only ascend the throne if he's family and he'll be family if he marries you."
"I understand that you reacted wrongly in the heat of the moment. You had plenty of time to assault me if you wanted it but you didn't. So I forgive you. Just forget it." Draco whispered and moved forward, embracing him tightly.
"Happy now. You can turn around if you want and become my teddy bear." Harry said before yawning again and Draco turned around to glare at him "I am not a teddy bear."
Draco dismissed him "It's okay. I will call Kreacher and take his help. You must take rest." And started cleaning his room.
"You must talk about it." Harry spoke cautiously and very softly. He did not want to scare Draco off. The response that he received from Draco was surprising and completely opposite of what he had thought. Draco glared at him "I will not talk about anything at all."
"Up Up" The tiny girl mumbles and Lucius stares at her. Never in his life has any child except Draco asked him to pick them up.
Draco just swallowed because he couldn't speak. His heart was racing. Harry was too close to him. Their lips were touching and Harry's eyes were so soft. "I was just startled by the sudden moment." Draco lied and Harry caressed Draco's cheeks. Then Harry sucked his lower lip and Draco couldn't prevent a soft moan from slipping his lips. Harry's teeth dug in his lower lip and Draco slumped in Harry's arms, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist.
She had hurriedly prescribed the medicines and tried to gather as many things as she could get. The scene that greeted her as soon as she apparated inside Harry and Draco's kitchen will haunt her forever. Draco was sitting with Harry's head in his lap, just staring at the her best friend. They were sitting in the pool of blood which was streaming from Harry's wrist. It was apparent that Draco was in shock because he did not look at her when she appeared. He just continued staring at Harry's face. The cuts that were on Draco's wrist did not escape her attention.
Harry opened one eye and kissed his nose "You are my sweet teddy bear. Now, please go to sleep. We have a long day tomorrow. You have to visit that shop owner tomorrow who wanted to sell your potions. He is near my academy and would be convenient for you."
Harry had his own demons, still has and Draco was in depression. They needed time to get to know each other and they ran into marriage without even trusting each other with their respective pasts.
He entered the room and looked around. It was appropriately decorated. The minister of France walked towards him and extended his hand murmuring "Welcome Lord Malfoy and Mrs Malfoy. I hope that your son arrives as well. Their are many people I want him to meet."
His eyes were watering. Draco had carried this secret for the past ten years. He was so hurt that he was still denying the truth after so many years.
"Shall I stop?" Harry asked again and Draco opened his eyes to look at him. As expected the adamant blonde shook his head and replied "Only if you wish to."
He will wait inside if that's the case. But when he opens the door and meets crazed eyes of Draco Malfoy, his feet freeze.
She went on, nevertheless "I had a look at the effected area. It is apparent that you had whipped him with a stick." She turned towards him and smiled weakly "Relax, Draco. It will take a few minutes." Draco was so mesmerized by her behaviour that he opened his mouth and closed it. She walked towards him slowly and he relaxed. Harry stood their, still staring in shock. He came out of his stupor and walked towards Draco and sat down. Draco wondered why Harry did not defend himself. Harry had never lifted a hand on him.
He stands up, having already given up. Black has rubbed off on her. She has suddenly made it her goal to annoy Severus as much as possible for her.
Draco was not comfortable with either Weasley or Granger but she was better then an unknown healer who would lead Draco to a panic attack so he sighed wearily and spoke "Then, I think Granger will be best. She is professional and does not hurt any of her patients. I have heard that she is devoted to healing." Draco whispered and Harry nodded. He turned to pick his boxers but Harry stopped him "Wait. Just put on your trousers. Boxers will burn your hips."
"We know that you can not face us yet but know that your parents love you and will stand by you, no matter what happens. You are not alone Draco. Your family is with you and so is Potter. Potter loves you Draco. We heard that you tried to commit suicide. Why do you wish to-" Draco was horrified because his father's voice broke. His father who never, never broke down, in no circumstance, his voice broke. Mother continued for father "Why do you wish to leave your old parents alone Draco? We miss you and we are sorry to be the reason of your sufferings. Please forgive us. If you don't wish to see us for a while, it's okay. Write to us. Meet us when you are comfortable but do not try to- to-"
"Are you sure?" Severus asks because mother can't. Mother is crying openly in front of Draco, tears streaming down her cheeks. Draco doesn't feel the urge to comfort her. She is not well herself.
In a blur of motion, Draco stood up and wrapped his hand around his throat to shut him up. For a very long time, he had wanted to do this and would have but this man never came again back.
"May I, please?" A pretty girl stood up and walked towards him cautiously. She reached him and looked at his neck. It was plain that she wanted to drink from him and was controlling herself with much difficulty.
"You are punishing me and I am sorry." Draco replies. It's strange. Harry's words are going over his head.
After leaving Draco's office, he left for Gremmauld and decided to read books in the vast library that Blacks had. They had all kinds of books. No matter what he did, he couldn't concentrate on any book he read. So he decided to cook something.
Harry read the letter carefully behind Draco's shoulders. He had a hunch as to who the writer was but he could be wrong. It could be a trap. So he stayed quiet and waited for Draco to speak. Of course, he knew the words that would escape Draco's mouth.
"Please, Draco. Don't leave." Harry pled and his chest and nose ached but merlin, it was good to have Draco back and he did not want him gone. "Please."
"When I was small, I dreamt of having someone to share my sorrows and happiness and I also dreamt that that person would tell me his sorrows and joys. I dreamt of having someone who would need my care and love, who would share everything with me. I promised that I would never let that person go." Harry muttered and Draco was looking at him silently, frozen in time. His eyes did not blink. They were blank and his face was pale but then it could be because he had not been sleeping at all for the past couple of days.
"Ah!" said Dumbledore, "Since we do not know how long we will have to stay inside the castle, I would like to start classes. We have teachers and students and time," smiling pleasantly.
"I overreacted Draco. I didn't mean it. I love you and will wait as long as you want. I know the wounds might take years to heal that is why I suggested visiting Neville." Harry whispered. Draco had still not removed Harry's hand but he was not looking at Harry at all.
"Why didn't you give proper clothes to her?" He asks. Draco's mouth is opening and closing and her eyes are clenched tightly. Her arms are wrapped around her frame and he is so so sad for her.
"I will tell everything to you tomorrow evening." Draco whined and Harry returned his attention to Draco's lips, kissing him passionately and hungrily, mumbling softly "I love you so much."
"He's right, Draco. You must compel him to confide in you. You're the brain behind the time turner. Too much is at stake now. You can't back off." Hermione sighs.
"Harry. Mate." He heard a voice and did not turn around. It was Ron. "Harry. What happened? Kreacher did not say anything." It was Hermione. Harry still did not turn around. He just stared at Draco. Draco would never laugh again. He would never give him goodnight kisses or scold him for being too messy and irresponsible. Harry's throat was closing and his mind was spinning.
Harry was so glad that Lucius had taken this step. He was astonished because it must have taken a lot of strength to do this. He dragged Draco, murmuring "You still have your parents Draco and they love you. You must not waste this opportunity. They want to help you and you must take their help."
Severus never had any say in his godson's upbringing and he would be damned if he let the blonde corrupt Harriet's mind.
He had not realized that he was crying until the bitter tears slipped inside his mouth. Was this what he had needed? A closure. An acceptance from the only blood relatives he had.
" Harry, you have made us late. Must you be so lazy all the time. " He heard his son snap at Potter in the voice he had often used at Hogwarts with the greed eyed boy and he felt his lips upturn in a smile. He did not seem as haunted as he was earlier.  "I am sorry, you great git. But it was you who wanted me to look perfect. " " You always look perfect. "
"Harry, say something." Hermione whispered, clearly anxious and Ron just shook his head, "I don't believe this mate. I mean, Sirius?"
He kneels down in front of her and looks into her glowing eyes. He had been so mistaken. She is not even close to what he had expected.
Lord Burbage this. Lord Burbage that. It's nauseating and slightly terrifying to hear someone being addressed as 'lord' yet again after decades. He has half a mind to go and shake the red-headed man's shoulders.
She turns and stares at the occupants. Severus is looking at her. His eyes are cold. Draco doesn't remember him looking so cold like ever.
The anger that had left with Voldemort's defeat returned and he felt the urge to return to Britain and destroy this person and others who had hurt Draco.
Draco buried his face in Harry's chest. Harry hug him tightly as he sobbed, trying to hide him from everyone.
"Okay. We'll leave then and we'll take James and Lily with us tonight. Talk to her and then tell us. We will figure something out." She says and Harry lets himself smile a little.
Ten minutes later when their food has come and Scorpius takes a sip of water, James says casually, "Aunt Hermione said that the time turner is ready."
It took four days to wind everything up. Four days which they spent peacefully. Draco was smiling and talking to others and Harry had thought that Draco was finally healing, that perhaps everything would finally be fine and he they would be able to live happily.
"It's okay. I don't mind." He murmurs, "Just go to sleep. Close your eyes and sleep. Stop thinking. I am here. I will wake you up if you have nightmares. Whatever you suffered is over now. No-one is going to ever harm you."
The desperation that he often went through reared its head again and Draco's eyes must have been transparent because Harry’s intense eyes bore into his. His hair was wet and water droplets slid down his body. Draco wanted to lick them and Merlin he wanted something that was completely impossible because how could Harry cleanse him.
"Why haven't you woken that boy yet? Harry knows what Vernon eats in the morning," she asked quietly, grimacing.
"You are still hurt. I don't want to hurt you." Harry murmured, his hands outside and around Draco's waist now. Draco's hands stayed inside Harry's trousers though and squeezed his hips before Draco looked at him softly and whispered, "Later then. I will be healed in no time at all."
She got up and turned to get out of this house. It seemed haunted. She started running because suddenly the house seemed like a maze and she couldn't find the door. It felt that hours had passed when she finally saw the door and then she ran to her bedroom and slipped inside the blanket. She closed her eyes and tried so hard to sleep. However, when she woke up and looked at the calendar, she found that she had still not gone back. She had slept for two hours. The smell was there - present and intolerable. Not knowing what to do, she decided to meet Dumbledore. He would certainly know what was happening.
"You are, Draco." She whispered softly and Draco snarled at her sitting up "I am not in a bloody trauma. you have no right to judge me. You don't know what I went through. You were happy in your life. It was me who suffered through everything."
Quietly, he walks inside and heads straight towards the lab. Teddy and Rose are seated, their noses buried in some papers as they discuss something. Draco is leant against the window. He is waiting for Albus.
"You will clean the bathrooms and bring groceries. I trust there are other elves in the Manor to serve father and mother." The elves replied in unison "Yes. Master Draco."
Harry's heart was thundering and he saw red when he thought of the person who had probably written this letter. All he wanted was to confront that vile, bastard, bloody swine. But he would wait for Draco to come around because that's what Draco needed.
"I think you should ask Lucius about the rest of the tale. He's the right person." Sirius mutters and presses his lips together to suppress his grin. He'll never forget that day.
"Ron, open the blue trunk and bring me the red and blue vial quickly. Quick Ron. He is in pain. Harry stop pouring the water now."
Draco opened his mouth to say something but Harry dismissed him before sighing and unbuttoning his shirt. Draco just stood there watching him undress and his cock twitched.
"Go away. You're a freak like your mother. Go away!" She hisses. Of course Snape comes to the child rescue. His eyes flash and he takes a step towards her.
Thank god for small mercies that Ron is snoring. He heads towards his bed and sits on the edge, staring at the floor. A couple of minutes later, he lays down it and places his hands behind his head. Unable to sleep, he stares at the ceiling unseeingly. He shouldn't want to protect Draco after what he just saw. He shouldn't care. He shouldn't love him except that he does. He can't help it.
." Blaise hisses beside him and Draco grits his teeth in annoyance. Why can't Blaise stay out of it? Potter still doesn't say anything. What's up with him today?
But as Harry stares at the smirking face, the face morphs and right in front of him, he changes into one of those Lestrange brothers. Harry stares before whirling around. He almost stumbles in shock when he finds the other brother standing in front of him with Bellatrix.
"Tell me. You don't have to scared of anyone. We will punish him and take you away. But if you keep quiet, then we won't be able to punish him."
"You don' trust me at all." Harry replied as a matter of fact and Draco just stared, wondering where all this was coming from. "What do you mean? Of course I trust you."
He hears Lily's and James's dramatic gasps of surprise and feels proud of them. He hears Albus squeak when they tease him relentlessly. He was unable to get rid of Voldemort on time which cost people their loved ones. But atleast he raised his children well.
Draco shakes his head, "No. We were good yesterday evening. I told him that I had to meet father and so we won't meet yesterday night. He said that he needed to catch up on his sleep."
"HOW COULD YOU, YOU – YOU BLOODY COWARD? HOW COULD YOU JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?" He shouted hoarsely, to no avail. Draco lay there on the bed, still with eyes closed.
Draco's eyes trailed from his neck to his legs and Draco shivered and Harry could read desire and panic in his eyes in equal proportions.
"She refused to wear anything else... asked me to go away and just let her sleep once I was done checking her."
"How dare you just enter our house as if it belongs to you?" He shouted and glared murderously, strangling the redhead with all his might. Weasley was struggling but Draco growled and pressed his hands harder.
The moment, Harry feels the wards shudder, he jumps up. This means that Sirius has taken Draco and Harry has to alert the aurors now. They had planned this in the middle of the night. They had sent Kreacher with letters for Kingsley and Ron. Ron and Hermione had somehow involved their entire family in the plan and so they had a lot of help now. It was almost too easy. Almost because he really did want to know who was waiting for Draco. He hopes it is Ron and one of his brothers. They are the only ones Harry trusts.
"I am sorry." Harry repeated and as expected Draco did not reply again. Draco used to sing for him in the early days of their marriage and had stopped when Harry had stopped appreciating him. Harry felt like hearing Draco again and so he requested "Will you please sing for me? I want to sleep and my leg hurts."
"Now, Harry.. Just close your eyes and try to sleep." Dudley says and Harry breathes which sends another jolt of pain through his body.
"Ma-l-foys." Sirius says. Harry still makes the error sometimes and Malfoy would be offended if Harry were to make this error in front of the blonde. Not that Sirius's going to take Harry to visit the manor.
Severus's dark eyes widen in alarm before they meet Sirius's and then the man kneels in front of a five year old Harry Potter.
She shook her head and continued "No, magic helped me. Sometimes when I bathed, he would try to enter, attempting to catch me off-guard. I lived in constant fear that once day I won't be able to protect myself and that he would-"
Draco woke up with a jerk and looked around him wildly. He was still in his own house on his own bed. Blindly, he got up and started scrubbing himself all over. When that did not work, he hurried inside the bathroom and jumped inside his tub and turned on the faucet, thereafter increasing the temperature of the water. Draco sat huddled, his knees on his chest and his face on his knees, sobbing.
Harry said that his godfather should have been free to take care of him instead of getting himself imprisoned.
Maybe, this was all a nightmare. That could be the only sane explanation of all this. Yes! Maybe he would wake up and realise that the blast had not even occurred in the first place.
"Who did this?" It's oddly comforting and also very astonishing, "Are you putting him to sleep Dudley? We have to talk to someone about this, someone who is not Albus Dumbledore. But first things first. Take him in his bedroom. I will bring warm water and a towel and my first aid kit. Vernon is trying to contact Dumbledore and Snape and Black too. I will try to heal his wounds. You-"
Draco wonders and lays down on the bed, trying to calm himself down. He doesn't want to sleep but it seems that Severus gave him a sleeping potion. he wants to think about what he saw. But just a few seconds later, his eyes close and he doesn't even realize when he falls asleep.
"I know that I am asking too much but there is no other option. Lucius would take over and we can't let that happen. In fact, maybe it's time that you overthrow him." Harriet murmured.
An invitation had arrived for him and Narcissa to a ministry party because they were the Great Potions Master Draco Malfoy's parents and his heart swelled with pride.
"I didn't know you were still here. We are not used to having anyone around you see." Draco murmured, appearing abashed and Harry mumbled, his hand on his hair, his cheeks faking a blush as well.
Draco did not answer and Harry felt him wrap his arms and legs tightly around Harry, as if trying to feel Harry all around him.
The same brown eyes that had first looked softly at him and then had mocked him stared at him with panic. His hands tried to pry Draco's hands off his neck. Draco growled and tightened his hold on the neck.
"What have they done?" Harry asked and Draco looked into his eyes, his eyes widening with absolute fury.
Harry did not speak. He just placed his head on Draco's shoulder and breathed in and out a few times, trying to control himself "No. The last time he tried- I was cleaning his house and you know I wore my cousin's clothes so they were loose. All of a sudden, he came and pulled my pajamas. He tried to grab my hips but I was so angry that I burned his finger. After that he never tried anything again. I have not told this to anyone till date. "
"Ah! That would explain why she did not answer me." Harry whispered, continuing "Perhaps she thinks that I would not help her."
"But, what about you?" Severus asks in a low voice, trying to make her understand the consequences of what she was doing, "After he rejects you, you will-"
He can feel Draco's eyes burn at the back of his skull as if urging him to look at him. However, he doesn't. He doesn't as much as peak at the blonde.
No-body answered her that is no-body except Dumbledore who only muttered, "I wonder if you're right Mrs Longbottom."
"Potter." Draco insists because he is already too late. When Potter doesn't reply, Draco pushes the girl hard enough that her feet stumble and she falls down on her ass, her elbows resting on the floor to prevent her head from hitting.
"What happened, Ron?" She asked worriedly as he sat on the chair and she stood beside him but he stayed quiet, just staring at the parchment in front him blankly. She tried again, gently this time "Ron. What happened?" and settled in his lap, stroking his cheeks and making him look into her eyes.
He would have to die. He needed to die so that Harry would move on. He had no right to destroy Harry's life along with his. Harry would be happier with someone who was not so insecure, who could embrace happiness and keep Harry happy as well.
"I would like to bury the hatchet and move on. I am visiting my parents this weekend and I am inviting Harry and Draco as well. We will be having dinner. I would like to invite you." The man's cheeks tinged pink and father looked bewildered. Mother mirrored his reaction. Mother recovered from her shock quicker though and replied, "Of course. Mr. Weasley. Thank You."
"I shouldn't have returned home late. I shouldn't have broken your trust in the first place, But trust me Draco. I never cheated. I loved you and I have always loved you. I never even looked at another man or woman. I was just being rebellious. My relatives did not let me go out. They used to lock me inside the cupboard and later on in my room. I was given food through the cat flap. I was coming late because I could not because I wanted to ignore you." Here Harry stopped and looked at him, his face white and then red. Draco looked at him, completely stunned and realized that Harry had said all that by mistake. Harry was embarrassed and Draco knew that he had to handle the situation carefully because this meant that Harry had just been ignoring his own past demons.
"Our son isn't a freak." Petunia insists firmly. Being a freak was what took her sister's death and he won't lose her Dudley too.
"Um, hello Mr. Malfoy. Could I, perhaps, talk to you for a moment?" The cautious voice took Draco down the memory lane that he always avoided and he couldn't prevent the sudden onslaught of memories ...
He had not even realized when his eyes had closed and he had covered his head with both of his hands, whimpering as if he was in pain.
"You do realize that you'll have to return if you decide to help Malfoy get out of whatever trouble she has landed herself in
But that is not acceptable because it's not just rescuing that Harry wants because as long as Voldemort is alive, he will not stop hurting people Harry loves. Earlier it was his parents and then he tried to kill Sirius and now he has Draco and Harry knows that while they are talking that bastard is... it's unspeakable. He can't bear to think of it.
"Does it burn?" Harry asked and Draco whimpered. Harry could swear he did. A minute later, a soft reply came "Yes. Sometimes, it does." And Harry kissed it softly.
Severus's mouth open in utter shock. Firstly, how does she even remember Black telling anything to her. Does she remember anything else and secondly why will Black find him cute. She is always making fun of his nose. Earlier it was his hair so he started paying monthly visits to a magical saloon and now she won't stop about his nose.
Draco opens the door and walks out and turns around to look at Harry. The green eyed man has kept his emotions in control till now but now his face is quite transparent and all the terror is clear on it. He doesn't want Draco to go. Harry has waited long enough for this day but now Draco can see that Harry doesn't want any of this.
"You won't be able to believe the truth and I don't want to lie." He murmurs and she looks at him. He is right. She won't trust him yet. She doesn't think that she can ever trust anyone again.
"Why would you do that if you don't want to?" He asks sharply. He is not himself right now. His emotions are out of his control. He wants to understand.
"He is my best friend and we have a right to interfere." Hermione started and Draco looked so murderous that Harry was pretty alarmed.
While Draco is busy getting over his shock, Harry takes a moment to look at Draco's handsome face. He has soft blonde hair. He has silver eyes and a pointed chin. His lips are red and his face is flawless. Snape has arrived but Harry doesn't look away from Draco.
"Harry." Draco murmured softly and Harry stared at him, his eyes furious and his hands clenched into fists.
They reached Harry's room and opened the door. Hermione entered and so did they and Harry locked the door.
It was amusing to see how predictable Albus' passwords were or maybe, she just knew him better than the others which was why she was wondering if this was some kind of plan of Albus. It won't surprise her if it was. She walked past the gargoyles and went up the stairs.
He had been fidgeting ever since he had left home and so he decided to leave early today. He had just completed furnishing his academy. It was ready now. He could start the classes. His mind was too upset to be happy, though. So he hurried home, having decided to design the pamphlets at home itself.
Finally Harry started sucking his nipples almost viciously. His hands reached the hem of Draco's trousers when Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably.
He continued, his voice and eyes disgusted, "He's dead. Today is his tenth death anniversary or have you forgotten, Petunia. I don't understand how you can when his dead body is still trapped inside that damned cupboard under the stairs. After all, you were the one who trapped him there."
"I want to kill him, Draco." He finally spoke, looking into his husband's eyes. Draco looked at him and finally let his hand go. Harry walked towards the window and looked outside. Draco walked towards him and held his waist before placing his head on Harry's shoulder.
"Never reached him. I don't know what happened of them. But they did not reach him and he is still my husband. The fact that I have stayed away from him for the past four years does not change the reality of my relationship with him. You were one of the major reasons of our quarrels." He replied angrily and this time Harry moved between them because it seemed that Draco would slap her again and Harry wanted to avoid it.
Draco swivelled around to storm inside Black's office but found him leant against the wall beside his open door.
Were Harriet not determined to pursue Malfoy, she would either have given up entirely or sunk into depression. As it was, she couldn't just let this go. Malfoy is the only one she has ever wanted. She will not give up so easily.
Even as he took the plates to Harry's room and asked Kreacher to clean his old potions lab, the though did not leave his mind.
"Do you ever listen to yourself? You would never be a burden on me." Draco snapped at him and Harry did not have to look up to know that he was being glared at. It would have been better if Draco had called him a burden because he had mocked Draco all those years ago and he couldn't help but be ashamed at his own words.
Dad doesn't say anything. Nor does Albus. So it's mom who continues with a sigh, "You knew that this would happen eventually."
Weasley sighed and continued "We can convince him to stay with us if you cannot stay with him because of your busy schedule or anything else."
"Okay." she said and tears slipped down her cheeks as she traced random patterns on the table with her first finger. Her shoulders shook as she sobbed and Draco's heart went out to her. He got up and gathered her in his arms. She wrapped her arms around his neck and he stroked her hair. He sighed deeply to control his fury before he apparated in front of the Dursley house.
Draco's eyes were so transparent. As Harry reached him and unbuttoned his shirt, Draco stood wordlessly, looking at him. He could have entered naked of course but Harry knew that Draco was not ready for sex yet.
Finally, Ron sighs and whispers, his worried eyes on Harry, "Everything will be all over the prophet tomorrow. She won't take it nicely. Not to mention the prejudice that she will face once she joins Hogwarts."
Tonight though, tonight- something is different. Something is totally off. A week and a half has passed and it's almost midnight. Unable to sleep, Harry is reading.
Lucius stares at the two five year olds playing in his garden. That the dark lord could come back and destroy this terrifies him. That he could turn Lucius and Narcissa into his puppets and hurt Draco and Harry makes him tremble although he doesn't allow anyone to witness it, anyone except his oldest friend Severus and new friend Sirius of course. Lucius would like to claim that he's allowing Potter's brat inside his manor because it'll eventually help him. He would also like to say that he hates enigmatic little Harry Potter but it would be a white lie.
Harry cuts Ron off with a forced, "Please leave me be. As far as I am concerned, your world can go to hell. I have had enough of it.
Whatever George and Neville were about to say was interrupted by Draco's return. He came inside and stood beside Harry. There was no evidence of tears or a breakdown on his face now. His brave husband was back and Harry was proud of Draco.
Sirius stares at Draco with terrified eyes all the while, not even uttering a single word, not even attempting to move, his gaze steady and terrified on Draco, trying to breathe. Finally Draco drops his hands and Sirius heaves a huge breathe before Wealseys pull him up.
Ginny is sitting inside, a picture of insanity, pacing back and forth. Her brothers are there and so are her parents. They look apologetically at Draco. Draco shakes his head at them before Ginny finally looks at him, her face twisted in an ugly smirk.
Draco tries to nudge Harry but he won't move. He is glaring daggers at Black and if looks could kill, Black would drop dead.
Draco looked at Harry and hugged his stomach. Harry hugged him back. A few minutes later he felt his shirt become wet with tears and he hugged Draco tightly but silently.
Harry's angry eyes shot up to him and he nodded, his eyes flashing "I might burn it if you do not take it from my hands immediately."
"So do you." Draco smirked and slumped in Harry's arms muttering "You have exhausted me now. I am sleeping."
"I thought you had called Kreacher for this purpose." Harry asked and Draco turned towards him "I like cooking so I will cook when I can and ask Kreacher to prepare meals if I am in some meeting or my lab."
"Yes, though you do not need my permission." Draco replied and Harry closed his eyes. Unconsciously, Draco started humming and Harry said "I love your voice."
"He will not even realize that it's me. He will think that I am just a lost child." Potter murmurs. She is sitting on a chair across him.
As she walks under the cloak, she watches several pairs dueling each other and she helps by casting minor hexes wandlessly. It's amusing to see their confused eyes when they trip or get slapped but she doesn't laugh. She is still in pain and she is tempted to use the portkey but she wants to see him die. He ruined everything and so she follows Potter with hurried steps.
The gate opens after Albus touches it with his wand. Albus walks inside. Draco is an expert legilimens. He is an unrelenting, intimidating, attractive older man and Albus is afraid that his eyes might let on the desperation he is feeling.
"Good bye Weasley. Have a nice life. You too Pans and Black." Draco sneers at them and Pansy flinches on hear her nick name from his mouth. Black looks at the floor in defeat.
Meanwhile, Draco was shaking with his head on Harry's chest. With soft hands, he hugged Draco and felt Draco burrow in his chest, still shaking.
"YOU HAVE NO BLOODY RIGHT TO RUIN WHAT I HAVE BUILT WITH HARD WORK, YOU ASSHOLE." Draco had never been so furious in his entire life.
Draco was at the door when he spoke those words. He kept his eyes deliberately closed and Draco whispered curtly "You said that it was just like other treacle tarts, nothing special."
Draco woke with a jerk and saw Harry looking at him, puzzled, his eyebrows raised in confusion. His hands searched for his kids and he did not find them. He got up and looked around himself. He was in their room and they did not have kids. It was a dream and he looked at his empty hands, craving for their kids.
"I always lived in a fear. Could never let my guard down. Could never sleep in peace. Could not even bathe in peace. Even at the dining table, he eyed me disturbingly. I want to punish him so much Draco. I hate him. He tried to violate me when I was a baby. Had I been a muggle, he would have succeeded. "
"May I have your attention please?" Father's voice boomed throughout the hall and Draco turned away from the voice. Harry looked at him with warm eyes and murmured "It's not healthy to stay away from everyone at the party. You must interact with everyone and you should talk to your parents. They must have missed you." Draco was about to speak but his father beat him to it.
"What happened to you?" Albus asks, alarmed. Why Scorpius decided to become an auror instead of a potions master is beyond him. He was always very brilliant in potions.
He would have pondered over it but Draco's words did not leave any space for any other thought at all.
She looks at him with a tiny smile and sad eyes, "I'll live. The Dursleys couldn't kill me. Nor could Voldemort. Rejection surely won't. I have made my mind. Nothing will change it now. You saw what happened to Tracie today. I know that Ariana is a veela. I can't risk her getting closer to Scorpius. You know that family. How can I do this to my daughter? I must save her. I must do anything to save her."
He realized that he had fallen in love with Draco all over again. He had fallen in love with Draco's little smile, his bright eyes, his humour, his softness, his understanding, his kindness, his everything. He realized that he couldn't bear to live without Draco ever again. He had not taken their relationship to a higher level. It was too soon and he wanted Draco to set the pace.
She places her hands on his and pushes him away forcibly right before the door opens. She swirls around, her eyes wide with terror and fists clenched tightly as she stares right into bright green eyes of Harry Potter.
Four hours had elapsed and Draco had written his last letter to Harry. He had given all his money and assets to Harry and was now sitting in his room. It was seven and he had tied the rope to the ceiling. He had also placed the chair on his bed.
