“No? [...] learned it all?”
Draco grins and then Pansy beams up, “I’ve got an idea!”
I stick my tongue out at him but I know he was right. Our mother called me ‘princess’ a few times but it never really stuck. Pansy is nudging at me to look back at the screen to look at this muggle contraption, a car. Those things look dangerous to me. A large box on wheels. Pansy was quite fascinated with them, especially the ones muggles deemed expensive but to me they sounded stupid.
The way Potter stutters over his words I can tell he is generally scared. If he’s scared that means this man has done bad things to him in the past. There’s part of me that wants to see what happens because it might help me understand him better but there’s another part that doesn’t want to see more because if I don’t see anymore than I can pretend that nothing else bad happens. But with Potter’s luck, more bad stuff is bound to happen. And this is only the beginning.
Draco glares at them and Daphne yells, “They’re not even that cute.”
“But we were friends for a year before that.” Blaise adds in.
“Where’s your sister now?” Hannah asks Grace.
Theo lets out a groan, “Ugh, your stupid rivalry. I can’t believe we have to watch it again. Why can’t you just kiss and make up already.”
Weasley glares at me, ready to probably say an insult about my heritage but Granger stops him and replies for Potter, “He hasn’t told us anything except that Dumbledore has assigned the three of you to do a task for him.”
Cassiopeia switched back to French, their mother tongue. It was a comfort speaking in the language.
A first year with brownish, ginger hair and bangs looked her way, “Hey Cass, whatcha need?”
Before I could respond and tell her that, yes I was cheating but not like that, Draco stood up, “I was not hiding money!”
I smile at the cake. Though it doesn't look like much, compared to the dirt cake Potter drew on the floor earlier, it’s much better and edible. The only thing the dirt one had was candles and ‘Happy Birthday’ spelt correctly.
She guessed Pansy had been right then, Harry Potter was on the train. Cass wondered how Blaise knew this was the compartment but she didn’t get to ask because Blaise tapped her on the shoulder and said, “I’m gonna go now Cass, Pansy’s probably getting frustrated alone with the others.”
I FIXED THE PROBLEM ABOUT THE COPYRIGHT. you will see in the next chapter that I have to use only a small part of the dialogue. I also can't describe what happens so I'm sorry if you can't understand it in the next chapter.
Weasley stutters, “Uncle?”
Draco and Cass headed off to talk with Severus while the other three worked their way up to the owlery to send a letter to The Apothecary in Diagon Ally since that was the closest potion ingredient shop that they knew of. Professor Snape was most likely in his office but just to make sure, Draco cast a ‘point me’ spell to find him. They didn’t want to waste any time and Mother had taught them that spell before they had left the Manor as she said it was quite useful during unexpected times.
“I apologize for my lack of action, Mister Malfoy. It was a critical lapse of judgment on my end.” Draco rolled his eyes. McGonagall’s lips pursed and she sat in silence for a moment. “As you know, some… high profile students have their post screened before being delivered in the morning.”
He didn’t even care that his silk pajama top had shifted upward with his movement and the ice cold floor burned at his back, nor that the tip of his quill was digging into one of his dimples of Venus. Early morning light seeped in from the windows and began blinding Draco as he willed the floor to swallow him whole.  If Hogwarts was truly as sentient as legend claimed, now was the fucking time to prove it.
A booming “Oi! Harry!” jolted both men. Draco clenched his eyes shut and sighed.  He momentarily forgot that Gryffindors traveled in packs.  It was truly impressive how quickly the golden retriever-like joy in Weasley’s face diminished the second he laid eyes on him. “Malfoy.”
With the last bit of bravery he had, Draco lifted his cup and gave Harry a cordial nod of his head.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Draco’s shoulders slumped at the Scottish lilt of Headmistress McGonagall’s voice, “a word.”
Draco couldn’t hold back a scoff.  Bitterness and the snide drawl of his younger self bled into his tone.   “With all due respect Headmistress, were you going to address this anytime soon or did having a certain Gryffindor student of yours mentioned as well send you into action? Or were you, perhaps, waiting to see if the harassment would go away on its own before you had to intervene?”
McGonagall folded her hands on the antique desk.  “I know breakfast has just ended, but would you like a biscuit?” She motioned towards a delicate crystal dish on the corner of her desk.
For the first time in centuries, a Malfoy agreed with a Weasley.  Maybe Potter truly was the Saviour after all.
He whipped his head up at his mother’s aghast tone.
He was going to be back at Hogwarts with Potter and the War Heroes as a Death Eater, a war criminal.  No matter his pardon nor Harry’s confusing attempts of acquaintanceship, the court of public opinion deemed him guilty.
“Malfoy,” the women answered in unison.
Perhaps Draco should have felt pleased at Potter taking his direction but overall he felt only disconcertment.
His fate laid waiting between the talons of the tawny post owl’s feet.  Draco traded a half-eaten sandwich for the letter and gave the bird a small pat on the head before letting it go on its way.
Draco exhaled a long sharp breath out of his nose.  “No. No I don’t.”
Draco turned quickly and went in search of an empty compartment.  He drew out his wand and silently cast a Colloportus charm on the door before melting into the cushioned bench.  He ran his hands down his face while exhaling a long deep breath.  The journey to Hogwarts had barely begun and he was already exhausted.
However, fate was a cruel mistress. Bleeding the family dry of their wealth and their dignity wasn’t enough.  Not even being pardoned thanks to the testimony from the bloody Saviour of the Wizarding World was enough to return to a place that he only aimed to return to for self-preservation.  No, he had to get two letters of recommendations: one from Headmistress McGonagall, and of course Harry fucking Potter.
He nearly choked on his sip of juice when the little girl who thought he was evil incarnate on the train was sorted into Slytherin.  Her skin paled and her lip trembled as she made her way to the table.  She gasped in fright as she accidentally made eye contact with him.
His blood trickled cold as his mind wandered to how Dumbledore might have responded.  He shook back his nausea at the hazy memory of the ailing wizard’s sympathetic gaze moments before Professor Snape took over, his wand coming to life with the vivid green sparks of Avada Kedavra.
Potter ran nervous fingers through his hair and sighed.  “Dra-“
Of course Potter—Harry, ever the saviour, rushed in to save him once more, the prick.  “Yeah, peachy.”
Draco blinked rapidly in an effort to bring back his stony shield of indifference.  He caught eyes with Zacharias Smith.  He gripped his wand tightly beneath the table.  It took every fibre in his being to not hex the self-righteous prick’s sneer off his grubby little face.
Draco forced down a small sip of tea as he felt his mother’s worried gaze try to reach him through the porcelain of his teacup.
The firm clearing of Headmistress McGonagall’s throat brought order back to the Great Hall.
Draco’s fork was back at his lips when an exceptionally vicious howler bellowed “HARRY POTTER SHOULD’VE FINISHED THE JOB AND GOT RID OF YOU SIXTH YEAR!”
Grey eyes met green.
He counted the rhythm between steps in his head so it looked like he was striding away with purpose instead of starting to sprint towards the nearest open door.
H—Potter looked like how he felt.  The normally warm brown skin of his face was becoming a pallid shade of beige.  Even from such a distance Draco could see his body tremor.  Nanoseconds later, there was a loud bang as Potter shot out of the Great Hall with all the power and speed of the level of seeker he was.  A deathly worried Granger and an intense looking Weasley rushed out soon after.
Draco’s eyes shot open and he coughed as something bony dug into his sternum and squeezed the remaining air out of his body.  His body went rigid as he registered the feeling of Harry’s arms wrapped painfully tight around him.  Merlin’s tits. The bastard was
Draco’s voice felt like sandpaper.  “No thank you, Headmistress.”
Harry stood frozen in place, his fingers digging into the sofa as Draco continued undeterred. His chest heaved in anger and he gestured wildly to his left.  “Oh, what a lovely corner of castle.  Here’s where I tortured students!” He aggressively swung his body towards the opposite corner, “and here’s where
Potter was jogging towards him, his merry band of Gryffindors running after him.  In any other situation, Draco would collapse from laughter at the various levels of shock and disgust displayed on their faces.  However, he had to fight to keep his face neutral at the painful twist in his gut. Potter was suddenly too close. He rushed out, “would you like to sit with m—um, us?” Draco lost the battle as his eye widened in shock.
Weasley was well, Weasley.  If his shoulders tensed any higher, he’d look like a gargoyle.  He heard the brute’s raised voice as he reentered the room.  It seemed like he was attempting to whisper but didn’t know the actual definition of the word.  “Look, I trust you but I’m not sure I trust
Harry’s brow was set in a deep furrow, his jaw tense.  At some point during Draco’s monologue, he’d pried his hands off the sofa and placed them at his side.  Draco closed his eyes and waited for the familiar feeling of fist against chest and he clenched his stomach in preparation as the shorter man took determined steps forward.
Being asked to adopt the cat of such a renowned potions mistress felt like a great honour, even though he had never thought of keeping any pet. His father’s peafowl had been horrible, and Draco had been glad when he had found a buyer for them.
Draco stood outside the Manor’s chapel and braced himself for another seven years of having to be untrue to himself. But the compulsion of the ring was keeping him in place. He tried his best to wear his Malfoy Mask, repeating in his mind
It reminded Draco a little of sitting behind Harry on the broom and fleeing from the Fiendfyre, but while then they had narrowly escaped from death, now they were happily flying into their life together.
“Sorry, Greg. We have an emergency here.” Pansy replied.
But Pansy knew him too well for that. “Don’t you dare put on the Malfoy Mask. I know you hide your hands when they shake. And I know that they shake when you’re really afraid of something. I won’t let you isolate yourself like during the war. Do you think the Ministry suspects you of something, or do you think it’s neo-Death Eaters?”
“Harry, could you please cast a strengthening charm on the bed and a silencing charm on our room; I think we shouldn’t have taken so much of the Love pastries,“ Hermione said under her breath.
When he washed out the hair potion, he didn’t cast any charms, and he used a shampoo that didn’t contain any straightening potions. Turns out, I have never seen my natural hair structure. At least not after my third birthday, when hair potions can be used on a child’s hair.
I’m glad that he is such a good friend and takes care of you.
Harry couldn’t really complain about Meowfoy preventing those two from getting drunk, they both could get obnoxious under the influence of firewhiskey. After his last New Year's party, Harry had to replace two rugs, one because of a burnt-in hole and the other because even Molly’s best cleaning charms couldn’t completely remove an unknown vomit stain.
Regardless, the matter still interested him.
Narcissa sat in her place in the first row on the groom’s side. She looked back and watched the people filing in, those who knew little about Draco full of happy excitement, the select few who knew that Draco and Astoria weren’t willingly getting married to each other with the sombre air of parting with someone who was just sentenced to house arrest or a year in Azkaban.
“I think I’d like to accept but we live in Liverpool.” Dudley shrugged.
Although, again, Potter loved driving Muggle vehicles, too. On nice summer days, he would usually come to work with a big motorbike, and he was known to also drive a Patronus blue Sharan with at least one child booster seat inside, even though he didn’t have kids of his own, or even a wife.
“Potter and Weasley aren’t around. I’ll call Auror Smith, and you can tell him.” Smith was one of the worst from the DMLE crowd.
They felt like a little kid so often. Trying things that their father had considered uncouth, learning new ways of living their life, learning to trust, learning to accept forgiveness. It had been a big step to accept to visit Luna, on August 27th, for the first time, after she had announced that she invited people because of Draco.
“I have nowhere else to go.” Draco mumbled in a low voice.
A happy giggle shook Harry and Draco. It was something Harry had never thought possible, coming and laughing at the same time. Life was beautiful, and Draco made it so.
“Yes.”
by Queen
Draco finally crossed the distance and sat down beside Harry and took his hand into his.

Antoni put the rice paper as well as glass noodles into water to soften them, then told Draco to cut carrots into julienne strips. They put some carrot strips, glass noodles, a sliver of tofu and some “cilantro,” as Antoni called the coriander, on a lettuce leaf and wrapped it into the rice paper. Antoni showed them how to make a dip sauce from Hoisin sauce, lime juice, soy sauce and coriander. “If your guests aren’t allergic, you can also add peanuts.”
“Then he gets married to Astoria, and you all will move on as if you had never tried to prevent it. The Armiger ring is only a D 1.” Narcissa said. “I know it would be hard emotionally, but I believe it won’t come to that.”
The elf appeared with a pop. “Yes, Matthew. How can Kreacher help, Mr. Draco?”
“I get that whenever I show my face on Diagon Alley. One of the perks of transitioning, they no longer spit at you for being a descendant of Cantankerous Nott. The disadvantage is that I was disowned. I’m glad you made sure Draco’s old man wound up in Azkaban while he and his mom are free. His mom helped the two of us learn hairdressing and invested most of her remaining money in this salon. She spent two years behind a cash desk at Primark before our salon brought in enough money to finance employing her as a hair potioneer.”
The man wanked faster and faster, thinking loudly about his imaginary partner’s blond hair and posh attitude, and Draco felt it as if he was touching himself simultaneously, even though his hand was still where he could see it.
“No problem. Have fun.”
“Godric’s sake, come to mine with Paw. We don’t bite. Merlin, one could think you mistake us for nifflers. Have you had breakfast yet? I’d like Meow to calm down as soon as possible.”
Draco gasped for breath. His fear of the situation mingled with Potter’s angry thoughts, and they were very similar: “Will I never be able to live in peace?” was a very dominant thought in both their minds. Draco feared having to live in some dodgy kind of safehouse for the foreseeable future.
“And I’m proud of you for planning to go to that wedding with your head lifted high and a date for the occasion and not letting that Finch-Fletchley bring you down.”
“What’s Ms. Parkinson’s opinion on him living here? I can’t imagine that she wants him to live here.” Harry needed allies to get Malfoy out of here, even if they were one Pansy Parkinson.
“I became an Animagus to escape the pressure to be heroic at all times after the war. It helped me to stop drinking and regain control over my life. Also, I can be there for the kids during full moon nights.” Harry paused, then continued. “I founded the orphanage when I heard that a child from Teddy’s nursery school had to go to a ministry cell to transform at the age of three years. I looked into it and found out that there are four kids in that situation. So, that was how I dropped out of the Auror program and turned Grimmauld Place into the Padfoot Foundation Orphanage. I’m sorry that I wrote that I’m a teacher, but everyone knows the Padfoot Foundation Orphanage, You would have found out who I am within seconds.”
“My son may not discuss his sexual preference with me, but I’ve never heard him talk about any woman’s attractivity.” Narcissa put a hand on Harry’s arm. “About your physical features, on the other hand… Let me just sum it up. He has talked about your emerald eyes since even before Hogwarts.”
“Draco, I don’t mean that type of special occasion. I mean occasions like dates, pub nights, or if you don’t have people to date or go to the pub with, St. Mungo’s Christmas Party.” Tan’s voice sounded exasperated but not unfriendly.
“Can you ask a friend who would be credible as a fake significant other?” Malfoy turned on the water at a perfect temperature.
Harry sat down beside him and tried to pat his shoulder, forgetting that Malfoy would not have anything touchable.
“Please. Too many clothes!” He let Harry unbutton his shirt, then pulled up Harry’s t-shirt. Harry slipped out of it, then they stumbled into Harry’s room.
Draco summoned all his courage. “It’s me, Weasley, Harry is sleeping, and I wanted to get a glass of water and something for us to eat.”
While Harry was right-handed, he had also often smudged the ink at Hogwarts, and now that he was grown, he only wrote with a quill on parchment if he was forced to. And that meant, only whenever he had to sign a contract with the Ministry.
A closing door somewhere woke Harry up. The familiar sound of footsteps on the stairs revealed to him that Draco was on his way downstairs. Harry went to the en-suite, considered having a wank, but decided that it would be highly inappropriate to wank in Draco’s personal rooms, and opted to take an icy shower instead. Then, he got dressed and headed out.
“Could I have something to read that isn’t a schoolbook. Maybe a novel?” Draco asked.
The hand returned to his cock while the other hand seemed to stroke across firm abs, firmer than his own while his blood rushed south at an incredible speed.
At that moment, Cupid the gnome appeared from the kitchen, this time not flying, his wings were long gone, carrying a fortune cookie on a minuscule tray.
“We went to school together. Of course, we have acquaintances in common.” Draco tried his best not to sound snarky.
Draco looked at the floor. “Three years.”
Also, I tend to sidealong others, but not to ask for a sidealong. It’s so much harder if my friends are parts of couples, or have real siblings, doting parents, helpful kids, and only I’m alone. Yes, I was unofficially adopted into one of my best friends’ family, but my adopted siblings have spouses and kids, my adoptive parents raised seven kids and now help raising lots of grandkids. And my only adoptive brother who doesn’t have a family of his own lives abroad and is married to his job. If I were to live my needy side, I would become a liability. And they deserve better than that.
“Please, Mrs. Ashford, we have important information for them. What can we do here, we left our wands at the welcome desk? We’re no match for them.” Greg begged.
Before Draco could ask what summer rolls were, he felt the wards letting somebody through. Two sets of steps walked through the corridor, and before they were there, he recognized the clacking of his mother’s court shoes and the barely audible tap tap of Luna’s favourite ballet slippers.
The liquid Cupid had poured on his head was no Thames water, but some kind of bonding potion, and he was now bonded to a bloke who worked at the Ministry, most likely to an Auror.
A deep husky voice came from a portrait on the wall. “He’s not a Gryffindor like you and me, Harry. His pureblood education wouldn’t let him show you that you mean something to him if he believes he can’t win your real friendship. He thinks you just pity him, and a Malfoy accepts no pity. The Black family used to think so as well, at least those who remained  on the tapestry did.”
“That’s their deadname. And I think you can show them that you are fine with them being nonbinary. I rely on you.” She put her hand on Draco’s shoulder.
But I know from the few details you let me know that I’m proud of you. Some of my students have lycanthropy, and you make their lives so much easier.
At that one, Harry had been at the premiere, and had invited Draco over after the show to catch up.
“That’s where you’re wrong.” Narcissa said softly. “He had to court a Pureblood woman, and propose to her. And she was forced to say yes. The Malfoy heir ring is a Q 3 artifact bound to a D 1 artifact, the Malfoy Armiger ring, and he can only take it off when he’s married. Before his trial, when he was still allowed to wear the Armiger, Lucius managed to give Draco a binding order to propose to a Pureblood witch, and cursed the heir ring to force him. The heir ring can only be taken off after getting married, when Draco will also be able to wear the Armiger ring.”
“You wanted to talk to me, Mrs. Malfoy?” Harry slipped into the seat opposite Narcissa. “I’m sorry, I don’t think I can get your husband out of Azkaban before he served his time. And at the last time he was asked if he felt safe, he said he did. Has anything changed?”
(See the end of the chapter for
And even though he felt a little closer to Pansy, he was glad she was free to live the life of her choice, being out and proud in a relationship with Hermione and Ron, an amazing power throuple.
“I was 16.” Draco pressed the words past the lump in his throat.
“What’s your name?” He smiled reassuringly at the gnome. No matter what the gnome had done, Draco couldn’t figure out why someone had told a gnome with wings to pour Thames water-- if his sense of smell didn’t deceive him-- on his head without gaining the gnome’s trust.
“I didn’t like your attitude towards my friends, but to be honest, you still were part of my bisexual awakening, although I was quite in denial of it.” Potter confessed, fidgeting with the napkin.
“You’re kidding me, aren’t you? The Boy Who Lived Twice can’t miss a vile Deatheater. Piss off, Potter.” Malfoy’s voice sounded weak and sardonic.
Ron looked to and fro between Harry and Malfoy. He may normally pretend to be oblivious of people’s love stories, because they were none of his business. But this was Harry, and if someone hurt Harry he and Hermione were the ones to pick up the pieces and help him survive. And for some reason, Harry clung to the idea of helping Malfoy.
“Aren’t you in the Sub-Department of Statistics? Why do you run the tests?” Draco stared at her.
Draco summoned all his courage. “You put on a show for me, didn’t you? I only realized it after you finished. And, before that, I thought you might be sleepwanking. So, I had to assume that you would not want me around. If I had known you wanted me to be there…”
“Delivery for Malfoy” he called out excitedly.
Forcing himself to breathe calmly and evenly, Harry gradually drifted back into a deep slumber.
“How dare you make demands? Either you talk to the Auror who is here, or…”
“I promise that if they insult you in my house, I will tell them to leave and come back only when they have learned to respect my flatmate. And anyway, how long ago was the last time you’ve had contact with anybody from the Weasley family?”
“No, I would never, unless you wish to work somewhere else, you are free elves. I just needed to do something less risky than brewing,” he reassured them.
“You bet about us at Hogwarts?” Harry almost shouted.
“Well, each of us spends enough time with their mindhealers to be able to channel that when need arises.” Hermione gave Ron a soft look. “Did Malfoy tell you when and how he died?”
“My charm to make my bed appropriate for sharing with Harry wore off. And if he had noticed, it would have been creepy for him. Thank Merlin I was the first to get up. I was really a dick not to offer Pansy my bed and sleep on the sofa but make Harry share the bed with me too?. I’d better just find a different place to stay. Let the fucking Manor crumble and live where I don’t take advantage of Harry’s kindness.”
Then another spotlight illuminated the stairs on the other side of the stage, where Harry was standing, and Draco heard Freddie Mercury’s voice from the loudspeakers.
“That’s not that much, a Weasley Christmas is bigger. I can handle that. But I hope they don’t all want to stay overnight here.”
On screen, Draco was standing in his bathroom, wearing a bathrobe and spraying saltwater spray into his hair.
Draco was stunned by the fact that this perfect man was interested in him.
With a flick of his wand, he started his magic-compatible CD player, and Freddie Mercury’s voice filled the room, he lowered the volume, but when Malfoy didn’t speak or do anything else encouraging a conversation, he hummed along under his breath to Delilah, and moved to the music while flipping the pancakes.
The one cup of tea to wind down had somehow become a sleepover in the guestroom of Grimmauld Place. That first renewal of their acquaintance had rapidly evolved into them  seeing each other every single day. It had not even taken them until the premiere of
Thoughts of his day, of elves trying to persuade him to start dating and obliviated gnomes starting potion attacks swirled around in his head, as he fell asleep.
How are you, darling? I haven’t heard from you for a while now? And I worry about you, it’s not good to be all alone.
“Yes, I’ve attended mindhealing sessions on a regular basis, my therapist helped me accept that I’m gay and have spent all my youth fancying someone my father wanted me to hate. Also, he taught me skills I can apply if I get an anxiety attack.” Draco thought about how difficult it was to get a mindhealer at all. Mr. Cole always changed the topic when Draco mentioned the war. From what Luna told him about her mindhealing sessions, he supposed his own were rather substandard, but it had taken him three years to get a mindhealer who was ready to treat him at all after his return to Britain.
Draco had finished applying make-up, both sets. They were going to change their looks during the show with a quick charm they had developed specifically for the purpose of changing outfits and makeup within an instant.
Harry put his arms around Draco and sidealonged him to the Burrow.
The voice in his head still sang the same song. Draco wondered if Can’t Get You Out of My Head was caught in the man’s mind. The song was definitely catchy.
“Want me to move to the Manor with you?” Potter looked him in the eyes.
“Potter,” Draco said, “this cheap wool you want to buy will only make you feel and look as if you had the hippogriff pox. And it would look better on a fucking scarecrow than on you. The colour is like that of support stockings. I presume you have the Potter vault and the Black vault. And you earn money every time you refurnish someone’s house. Why again do you think you can’t afford to buy dressrobes that look good and are comfortable?”
“You were so beautiful, Draco. I was fascinated by you from that first moment at Madam Malkins, but then you called Hagrid an oaf and before the Sorting you insulted Ron. I couldn’t love your attitude at Hogwarts. But when I saw you with Paw, and in general, when I saw the man you had become, I was in love. I love you. You are worthy of love, Draco, but I’m not half what people make me out to be.” Harry moved his free hand towards his hair, but Draco caught it in midair.
Suddenly, just as he was thinking of his arms feeling comfortably heavy, he felt the sensation of his hand lifting, while simultaneously lying still. The ghost touch feeling seemed to move to his crotch and rub across his cock through his pyjama bottoms. Okay, maybe when Harry was asleep, the connection was wider open. It didn’t necessarily mean anything.
“That’s enough, Malfoy. Firstly, Paw needs you. You’re his human, he might lose hope if you abandon him because you won’t get help. Secondly, I’m being selfish about watching QI with you.” He tried to focus his magic at Malfoy, to strengthen and support him against the dark residue draining life.
“We never did have a chance,” Draco stared back down at him with bloodshot eyes.
“Rough day?” a voice to Harry’s left spoke up. Harry scoffed to himself and turned to look at the man.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded. “Your ‘magic’ tricks.”
“You should eat, mate,” Blaise nudged him again. Pansy nodded in agreement, though she wasn’t eating either. She’d proudly announced on the train that she was on some sort of Muggle cleanse - juicing, or something. All she at was juice, or juiced food. Draco didn’t understand it.
He already felt them stare at him in the halls and during classes. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner especially - when he was trapped at a long dining table, unable to hide behind his Invisible Cloak. He'd often tried to have Ron and Hermione smuggle him back food, but Hermione insisted he eat with everyone else.
“At least have some stew or something,” Blaise pressed, nodding toward the beef stew. “You’re rather pale, and awfully skinny. Skinner than usual.”
“Pretending I’m a bat,” he said simply. Draco frowned, hanging lazily on his broom.
He almost turned around to say something to stop the sound of Harry's retreating footsteps, but his pride wouldn't let him. Instead, he closed his eyes and tried to get that feeling back. If he could feel just a little bit of it - a little bit of love - he'd be okay.
"Harry," Madam Pomfrey smiled warmly, sitting up. She nodded goodbye to both of them before walking away.
“Potter,” Draco grabbed onto his arm tightly; so tightly Harry thought he might lose blood flow. “How in Merlin’s name do you suggest we get out of here?”
“You want him to come live with me? Like, I’ll be in charge of him and stuff?”
And then their lips were meeting in the middle, moving against each other like they were meant to from the moment they were born. Their hands gripped at each others's clothes, hips, hair, shoulders - anywhere their fingers could find purchase. It was like nothing Draco had ever experienced before.
Something translucent slid down Draco’s cheek and Harry realized that he was crying. His bottom lip quivered and Harry threw his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling his lips down to his.
“What?” Snape shook his head. Harry could see Draco’s hand moving in his pocket; he was getting a hold of the coin.
"Did what?" Ron dropped his fork. Harry sat up on the floor and shook his head.
“Harry James Potter,” Hermione was the first to break the silence. “How could you not tell us that you two were-”
Brilliant, Draco. Really brilliant.
“Shove off,” Draco tried to sound strong but he was sure his grip on Harry’s shirt was going to rip the fabric. His knuckles burned with the pressure of it. “At least I’ve chosen something worth fighting for.”
Malfoy? Do I even know you anymore? Are you using me too? What about Hermione?” his eyes widened. “
“If you please,” she said, a soft smile on her face. “We must all return to breakfast. Breakfast and a show is a novel idea, I must admit, but the house elves didn’t prepare all of this food for it to go to waste. Congratulations, you two. I’m hoping this means I’ll see more of you two together at dinner, and less time together in detention?”
The Slytherin team groaned as Harry’s teammates shook their heads. Everyone mounted their brooms and began to set up a mock game in order to fine tune the teams. They’d work the Chasers and Keepers first, then the Beaters. And, finally, Draco and Harry would square off in a race to find the Snitch just for kicks.
"You always look good," he replied without thinking. He stopped and snapped his eyes to Harry's face. They shared similar expressions: expressions of surprise, shock, and mild embarrassment.
All of a sudden, Harry felt himself being shoved into the floor. His body hit the stone tiles and a sharp pain rocketed up his elbow.
“Who are you? My mum?” Draco snapped. As soon as the words were out of his mouth he felt awful about them. His expression softened and he sighed deeply. “I’m sorry, mate. I’m just a little on edge. I’m fine, I promise.”
Harry wasn't sure what Draco meant by that, and the look on Draco's face told him that whatever it was, it was sure to cause a great deal of pain. But none of that mattered to Harry. All that mattered was that he knew what it felt like to touch Draco's skin, and to cradle Draco against his chest.
Within minutes the entire corridor was completely empty, save for Harry and Draco. Draco couldn’t find the words to speak, so he waited for Harry to make the first move.
“And what’s that? Love?” the man howled, his eyes flashing wildly. Draco’s blood ran cold as he lifted his wand. “We’ll see how far love gets you tonight.”
“What?” Snape frowned, reaching up to his hair.
“My tricks?” Harry stared at him warily. He looked around the hall to make sure they were truly alone.
“You... stupid... selfish... bastard...” Harry said in between kisses, moving from Draco’s lips to his jawline. “Why... didn’t... you... write... me...”
"If I was there would you be able to do it?" Harry repeated. "Like, if I was modeling for you."
“Bit of a shock, isn’t it, Potter?” he chuckled, but Harry didn’t think he’d meant to be funny. Draco set the glass down. “Fancy seeing you around. Didn’t think you’d ever want to come back to a place like this. Now it all makes sense, why you tried so hard to leave.”
Draco looked up and immediately froze, his expression neutral and slightly defensive. The green sparks dissipated slowly until the two were left in only the light of the torches on the walls.
“Let’s go, Blaise,” she said. “Now.”
“I always had a choice,” Draco’s eyes were empty, his face hollow. He seemed even more pale than he ever had before. “I could have died. I could have stood up to him -
"I needed to get away from everything. I needed to stop breaking things, and screaming into a pillow, and I needed to just... escape. When I sat down on that rooftop, I did want to fall. I wanted to shatter into a thousand little pieces and forget that my life had ever happened. I didn't mean to fall. I hadn't even realized I'd fallen asleep."
“Draco I do not have time for-”
What Harry didn’t expect, however, was to see Draco step quietly into the Potions classroom like he owned the place.
Something surged through his veins that he’d never felt before. Draco was
I am not changing my mind about the double tryouts. Place nicely!
The thought alone was enough to make Draco almost freeze. He forced himself to keep his lips moving, much as he often had to do with Pansy late at night. He acted out his part while his mind raced.
As soon as the door closed behind him, Draco felt himself being pushed against it. Harry’s hands were on either side of his face and his lips were urgent, as if Harry would die if he didn’t kiss Draco immediately.
“We’re not getting out of here,” Harry turned to look at him. His glasses were cracked and dust covered the lenses. It was hard to make out Draco’s features, but he was sure he looked just as scared as Harry felt. His heart pounded away in his chest and he could feel blood on his temple. Whether it was his or someone else’s he didn’t know. “We have to fight.”
The thought hit Harry like a train. He still would have gone out. Looking at Draco in the moonlight was
you thinking?"
“You’ll always have a home with us, dear,” she told him after it was all over. “and I mean it. Holidays, weekdays, every day - it’s all yours.”
Someone let out an awkward cough, the kind that people force to get someone's attention. Madam Pomfrey and Draco looked up to see Harry standing there in front of them, awkwardly scratching the back of his neck.
“She left us one specifically for you,” Hermione added, handing him another note. Harry broke off the toast from what was in his mouth and chewed.
“What the hell are you doing?” Blaise whispered in his ear. Draco clenched his fists at his sides.
, this person catches you and takes you dancing through poppyseed fields.
Quickly, he nearly dragged Draco to the front door of the castle.
“I know what will cheer you up,” Ron pointed his fork at Harry. “Why don’t we go play some quidditch? I heard Slytherin was having an extra practice this afternoon, but as long as we’re off the pitch before it starts, Malfoy shouldn’t have a problem with it.”
“A thing?” Ron finished for her, his cheeks flushed red. He hated confrontation in any form, but especially the
“She’s right, mate,” Neville spoke up. He reached out his hand and high fived Blaise. “We could have been bad asses, mate.”
“Everyone, please, return to your dormitories,” Harry spoke calmly. Everyone hesitated, but soon they began to make their ways toward their common rooms. Draco was amazed at how much control Harry had as not only Head Boy, but as the Boy Who Lived - the Chosen One.
"Potter," he shot back on instinct. He never meant to be short and bristly when it came to Harry, but it was a reflex. Harry was a charming, handsome, good-for-nothing boy who had the world literally eating out of the palm of his hand. He didn't know what it meant to pretend to be something that you aren't; he didn't know what it was like to live a lie.
. His mouth was slightly open, shallow breaths parting his lips ever so slightly. So he was breathing. Harry noticed for the first time how long Draco's neck was, or how defined his adam's apple was. Harry's mouth was suddenly dry, his own breathing starting to quicken.
Harry didn’t know why he followed Draco back down to the dungeons that night. Perhaps he was simply curious about where exactly the Slytherin Common Room was, or maybe he wanted to see if Draco would test out his newest trick on a stray sixth year who was too polite to say no (were Slytherins polite to each other or did their distaste for everyone apply to those in their own house as well?).
thinking?"
The corners of Draco's lips tugged up into the softest of smiles as Draco briefly dropped his eyes. When the rose back up to meet Harry's, they were warm. Harry reached out to pull Draco closer to him, close enough that he could press his lips to Draco's and feel like he was falling.
The sun rose gently over the pitch, bathing the players in a warm and golden glow. Everyone laughed and joked about while they played, keeping the mood light. Harry found himself growing bored. Draco was taking his role as Captain seriously; so seriously that Harry found himself wanting Draco’s attention.
“Let’s meet back here in an hour, yeah?” he moved his lips to hover them over Draco’s. “Then we can work on your homework and I can show you how much I missed you.”
“Honestly, it’s a miracle you’ve made it this far,” he said. Harry laughed and then froze when he felt his broom jerk suddenly. He gripped onto it as it teetered out of control. Draco attempted to get out of the way as Harry sped toward him but it was too late; the two of them went crashing to the ground.
"I wasn't thinking I was going to pass out on a rooftop and fall, if that's what you're accusing me of," Draco snapped back. "And, in case you'd like to know, it would have been better if you would have just let me fall. Honestly, what were
Draco looked around the library, which was empty save for the two of them. He frowned.
. I have no future.
“You’re a silly little child,” the Death Eater responded. Draco shook his head.
“Would you get off me!” Draco moaned from beneath him. He squirmed until Harry sat up, his arm shooting up in the air. In his hand were Harry’s glasses.
Paw quickly jumped from Malfoy’s arms and greeted Meowfoy with a cat kiss and loud purrs. The two cats cuddled up where they were and started grooming each other.
After the ceremony, George ushered them to a table close but not too close to the head table. All Weasley siblings except for Percy and Bill, who had been guilt tripped to be Percy’s best man, sat there and Fleur told Harry and Draco that Bill wasn’t happy about sitting with the Finch-Fletchleys and the bigwigs.
“I – What if Prongs sees me and decides that he doesn’t even want to sit at a table with me. Prongs was on the Light side. He deserves someone better than me.” By now, tears streamed down Draco’s face.
He silently cast a charm that could guide the girl’s closest family member or guardian to her.
“May I suggest a fake date with a good-looking bloke who is currently negotiating with WWN Visual for the Magical British franchise of Queer Eye? You’d love him.” Emily rested one hand on Harry’s shoulder. Malfoy seemed to choke on air. Maybe Malfoy fancied the bloke.
“I didn’t ask you to meet me here because of my husband. He deserves what he gets, and the way he spoke to Draco last time Draco visited him, I’m not inclined to visit him any time soon. We are still waiting for Pansy, and we have something to discuss with you. What would you like to order? Oh, and Mr. Potter, I think it’s about time you started calling me Narcissa.” Her smile had something tentative in it.
“I’m happy,I can finally be myself, and work with cats and kneazles. And I’m looking forward to getting married.” Mick looked for a second as if they wondered whether they had said too much.
“Not really. But I also don’t feel as not at home as in most other places.” Draco sighed. “And I’m not quite sure if I should want to feel at home anywhere. All the things that made me feel at home in my parents’ house are forever associated with Voldemort for me. And with my guilt.”
They faked a cough, went to the table that was hidden behind the piano, drank a sip of water and reminded themself that the show had to go on. If there was one good thing they had learned as a child it was to look perfectly normal while something scared the shit out of them. And this time they would fucking use that skill against their father.
“Okay, thank you so much for your patience, Potter.” Mick gave him a grateful smile.
“I can afford either the decontamination or the rent of an apartment with a potions lab. You know, with the things I brew for a living, I need more lab safety than for brewing Pepperup. My vault isn’t quite as large these days.” Draco said admittedly, lowering his head.
“Sorry, Malfoy. Er, I just wanted to comfort you.”
That was the voice in his head again. Talking about Quidditch? That feeling in his hand and his nipple, was it a result of that weird bond, too?
Draco forced himself to start running, if he headed for the same castle as the Granger-Weasleys, he could avoid Harry.
“Nope. My cousin isn’t that silly,” Teddy yelled at her.
The twins have it, too. I think I told you about them, too. Marlene, who wants to be a healer when she’s grown up, and Leo, who made the opaleye bookmark for you. Four out of seven kids in my class are infected, Marvin is from an abusive family, and Leyla’s parents were deported without her. And then, there is my godson. His parents died in the war, and I’m raising him with his grandma. I didn’t mention their history for a long time, but by now, I trust you enough to tell you.
“Rule number two. Distribution of rooms. We’ll come to that when you are back on your feet, but your elves get proper rooms here, too. We have enough guest rooms to give every elf a proper bed.”
Draco carefully carried the gnome into the kitchen and sat down, holding him—as he saw now—carefully as not to hurt him, but at the same time tightly enough, so the gnome could not escape. He cast an Ennervate and waited for the gnome to look coherent again.
Meanwhile, Antoni had started looking at the kitchen. There was a Muggle fridge, an oven and stove with a kettle on top, and a microwave.
“Sorry, mate, but as long as we don’t know what we’re dealing with, it seems the best solution. And even if it’s Malfoy, I know you’re better at laying low with somebody around than all alone.” Weasley put a hand on Potter’s shoulder.
“I–I can’t go there. He’ll hate me,” Draco mumbled.
“She told me about your ring problem. She asked me to meet her at the Blue Rose last month to tell me that you're gay and are only marring Astoria because you were compelled to propose to her.” Harry looked worried.
“Don’t be stupid. Then they are gay and can get married. Mum and Dad’s friend Clarissa is going to get married to a woman. Two women can get married and two men can get married. Just like a man and a woman. And I will be the flower girl at their wedding. I’m getting a beautiful dress for it.” Mary sang as she grinned smugly at the thought of the dress.
He took an icy shower, drank a triple espresso, and dressed up. The worry about the date still made him want to claw off his skin, but he had to pull himself together. His mind went a mile a minute thinking about how he could avoid the disaster that was bound to happen when Prongs would see him. After all no restyling could delete his past.
“Guess this is as close to accepting our engagement as Father could get.” Draco noticed that they didn’t feel sad or angry. They simply didn’t care about Father’s opinion. But the mental image of themself and Harry being parents, was something different. “And he might even have a point about kids, but I’d rather give them your family name and a Potter family history to grow up identifying with.” Draco said pensively. “There is so much toxicity in the Malfoy family.”
Meanwhile, Harry was pacing the floor of Blaise’s office. He had just changed into the suit that Pansy had designed for him; he checked his pocket again and again. Yes, the ring was there. Yes, he was going to propose to Draco tonight. And he was going to propose on the stage at the end of Draco’s show.
“Harry, he managed to delay our getting together, but now we’re here, and I … You made me think of things last night, I want...” Draco expressed his feelings. They would have to talk about all of it, but they had time for that, didn’t they?
“Did you try to spy on him?” Weasley’s face was a mask of anger.
“You are not angry?” Mick smiled at him as if they had just been given 500 galleons in a gift wrap.
Maybe you could visit us in Grasse? You haven’t been to France in a long time. And there is someone I want to introduce to you. I accept that you don’t want to live in France, but I would like to hear your opinion about Constantine, the man who started courting me. He is very different from your father, he is patient, a humorous storyteller and a good listener. Originally, he is from Wales, but he has lived in France since his teenage years.
“Sirius, sorry, but what sexual favours Remus promised you is too much information.” Harry interrupted him.
A soft touch on his shoulder interrupted his thoughts. He noticed that it felt different from the touches he was used to from Astoria, as if the hand was bigger, but probably that was just some weird effect of having the heirloom wedding bands in his pocket.
The decidedly public move was to once and for all end the Prophet’s speculations on if he would ever get back together with Ginny - regardless of the fact that Ginny was engaged to Luna already. The Prophet pounced on the idea every time he was seen somewhere in Ginny’s company, which wasn’t so rare, because Ginny advertised for the Padfoot Foundation. Harry had started the charity as a children’s home for war orphans, but it soon expanded into a safe home for kids who came from abusive households.
As soon as Harry was home, he left his car in the garage and Flooed to Hermione and Ron. By now the exhilaration at Draco’s scaring the horrible couple away had ceased to a more appropriate feeling upon learning about the death of a former school acquaintance. Although, did everyone think of missing the sparkle of some acquaintance’s eyes? Now as a ghost, Malfoy’s eyes weren’t sparkling, they just looked hazy.
“Er, Draco’s mother wants to marry your cousin, Conrad.” Harry started.
“Harry, mate, what’s wrong with you? You look like somebody died.” Ron got up from the sofa and pulled Harry into a hug.
And she is terrified of travelling by air kraft, who wouldn’t be? Flying where one can’t breathe properly and just protected by a metal box that is powered by fire?
The evening wore on with pleasant dancing and talking, but Draco longed more and more to be alone with Harry. Astoria and Dennis had left already. They didn’t get the unwanted attention Harry Potter got.
Draco moaned. “Harry, please, more.”
“Only one? You helped every lycanthropy patient. You should put a lot of Legos on the pan for the improved potion. And also for moonshining to be able to donate more to the Padfoot Foundation Orphanage.” Karamo took handfuls of Legos and piled them on the pan. “Luna told me that when she was a captive in Malfoy Manor, you would sometimes sneak into the dungeons at night and bring them food and heal the most painful injuries. She thinks, both she and Dean Thomas would have bled to death internally if you hadn’t healed their injuries, leaving only exterior bruises.”
He knew that his father would insist on not allowing his pet to share a room, but he didn’t want to be like his father. “Only if they get along well. Paw was saved from horrible people when he was small. I don’t want him to ever suffer again.”
“I don’t know.” The gnome’s voice was high-pitched, but lower than an elf’s and very nasal. “I did what the big female told me.” He looked sort of sheepish—
Some of the elves befriending him was a great mercy, and he was grateful, especially to Ninty, a dignified elf, who had taken Draco under her wing.
by Queen.
Dempy stopped in her tracks. “Mr. Draco Malfoy ought to leave this house for two years and have it decontaminated, but he can’t afford the rent of an apartment and the decontamination bills, but only one of them.”
“Gamp’s law doesn’t say that a Potter might not be attracted to a Malfoy. And it’s a very well-known fact that you are one of the most handsome wizards, Merlin knows, even I notice that although I’m not attracted to blokes at all.” Pansy’s voice sounded exasperated.
Draco deepened the kiss. Harry’s mouth tasted of coffee with cinnamon. As they came up for air, Draco asked: “Can we find a more comfortable place to take this to?”
“I mean the elves. They told me a lot about you during the sessions of the Elvish Trade Union.” She smiled.
Draco tried and failed miserably to think of something that could counteract his arousal. Harry was surely asleep. His hands simply must be moving across his body without his knowledge. Why did nothing offputting come to Draco’s mind?
A shadow fell over the table, and Pansy sat down on the third chair. “Sorry, I had to Apparate in from Paris. France is deciding on a pilot project that allows underage magic at home with school-provided exercise wands. It will be tomorrow’s coverstory.”

“And is styling my hair what you imagined it to be?” Harry felt kind of nervous at the question.
“Storey will be happy to hear it. And I guess you can look forward to receiving a  wedding invitation soon. Would you like to get your cat settled to rest after their journey today? I'm sure when they wake up, they'll want to explore the grounds a bit"
Many other things had changed in the meantime. After the house bonding, Harry had moved into Grimmauld Place permanently, as well as Andromeda and Teddy, who had a whole floor of their own, while Cupid had found a life partner in Grimmauld Place’s only resident gnome. Draco was in the process of giving up his old flat, after having lived there only on paper for a long time now.
Yours, Harry.
Draco cringed. Why had he written it like that? He might as well have written that he had never stopped fancying Harry. If he hadn’t weirded Harry out back then, he was doing so today.
“I was the last magical Black by name. And Harry is my heir. In past times before Cantankerous Nott and his toxic ideas, Harry’s name would have been Potter-Black from then on and he would have been the head of the House of Black and passed the name Black on to one of his heirs and Potter to the other one. Only that our ancestors were the first to be so stupid and follow the ideas of Cantankerous Nott, even before the Nott family themselves. What I want to say is: This is your home too if Harry says so. And you heard him say that you can stay here. I’ve stayed out of your sight so far, but I have watched you. And I agree with Harry that you are worthy of his friendship. Welcome to your maternal family home Draco.” He took a deep breath. “And now stop being stubborn, I hate talking like a fucking Pureblood patriarch. I only did so because Remus promised to ri…”
Yours,
“I didn’t want to take it, but I knew if I were to say no, Voldemort would kill me. If I were to run away, he would kill my mother. She was not able to run away with me; my father had cursed her so that if she were to leave the Malfoy properties for longer than three days without my father, she would die under extreme pain.” Draco’s voice sounded wobbly, and he felt his hands tremble.
Harry opened the window, and the owl glided past him onto the bed. It lifted its leg, and Draco retrieved the letter. Harry gave it a treat, and it immediately flew off.
“Karen, what’s going on?” A rich, smooth voice interrupted her.
“There’s eight of us, five working elves, two small children and Grandad Yoffy.”
The waitress interrupted them to bring their drinks and ask if they had decided.
My Draco,
Both Draco and Harry were wearing glamours. She could only tell because she knew what to look for. Harry kept touching Draco’s arm reassuringly.
“I’m glad Mother gets to have a love match in her life now. With my father, it was a match due to potions and magical artifacts.” Harry was good at reading  Malfoy’s expression and believed that he was happy for his mother, but there was a tremendous sense of melancholy behind it. Was Malfoy sad with his life?
The pop of Apparition came from the corridor, followed by a knock at the kitchen door.
Draco looked at them. The pan with the colourful Legos was far heavier than the one with the grey Legos. “But - but people will never see the good things I can do with my life now as half as important as my Dark Mark. And I think when Prongs sees me, he will immediately walk out on me. I’d rather not see that. I think I can’t go to that date.”
Dempy beckoned to a door now. Harry knocked and called out: “Malfoy, please, let me in. Paw is missing you, fuck it, I’m missing you, too. It’s more fun to watch QI with you.”
“Come on, we’ll drive to your home. We’ve already arranged that with your boss,” Karamo said as the commotion slowed down a bit. Draco still felt overwhelmed. As many people had hugged him within five minutes than in all his life before. (His mother, Pansy, that one-night-stand in Muggle Bordeaux, Luna and Greg when he cried on his shoulder at Vince’s funeral – end of the list.)
“Yes! I will.”
He felt something like a gust of wind around his shoulder, and as he looked, Malfoy’s hand hovered there. “I’m hardly worth going to Azkaban for.”
It sounded relieved. But it was well-known that Harry was kind of oblivious. He had never realized immediately when someone had a crush on him. What would happen when he realized it?
“House arrest and community service, between six months and two years,” Ron replied. “Depending on how severe the Wizengamot considers her crime.”
“Can you transfigure the Legos to grey?” Karamo asked.
“Good designer dressrobes do that, Potter, not that you would know. The designers weave in a charm to make them as comfortable as jogger bottoms while making you look your best.”
The sign read
Only at the last moment, Lucius remembered that Miss Greengrass was sitting here with him. “Please, excuse me for a moment.”
But being bonded with Potter was completely unlikely, even though Draco felt something weird in his stomach at the thought.
“You might be away from home for a while, do you need anything important, like potions you take regularly, or something like that?” Weasley inquired.
“No, I never did.” Why did Potter believe that?
“Please, we have to talk to Potter and Weasley. It’s a very important matter.” Greg pleaded.
Passing by his room, he saw the door wide open and noticed with surprise that the bed looked untouched. He cast an indicating spell that showed him that nobody had slept there at all in the last night. “Pansy Parkinson, are you fucking kidding me?” he mumbled under his breath.
“Your mother and Luna love you the way a mother and a close friend love someone. And Luna wants you to go on the date with Prongs because she thinks he might love you in a different way. I’ve brought you something to look at.” Karamo lifted a tool case onto the garden table. He got up, opened it and brought out a balance scale.
“You do remember that Harry likes blokes? Because from the drama you make, it looks as if you assumed, he was scared to death of a bloke fancying him.” Sirius gave Draco a concerned look.
If he was honest, the House of Black was just minimally better than the Malfoys. And the few good people, like Sirius, Andromeda and Regulus were just proof of what a coward Draco was. After all, they were the proof it was possible to be better than he had been.
“You should wait ten minutes before you kiss, or the antidote will make Harry dizzy, because he didn’t take the Veritas toffee before.”
Harry burst into laughter. “If her plan had worked out, she wouldn’t have found out about any love life. I finally convinced Seamus that I don’t want to be set up on any blind dates ever again. She brought me together with Draco, but will hear it from the news the day we are ready to share it with the public.”
“I need clothes to ...” Draco started, but Matthew the Mirror interrupted him.
Draco thought that there was nothing better in life than to be gross with Harry Potter.
“What do you expect me to do? Go to Potter and tell him, we’ve never been friends, I was a Death Eater, but you’re also my wank fantasy, let’s shag, our cats want us to be friends, yes?” Draco said sardonically.
“You would do that for me?” Potter’s smile was so beautiful!
“I’m single, godfather of two godchildren, and I have a very posh cat. I often have to look after my godson, because his parents passed away and his grandmother is often in hospital. Teddy has a higher priority than dating for me, even though he doesn’t live with me often.”
Draco cut up vegetables all morning, then spent lunch time cleaning tables and avoiding most groups of people. The only people he was sure he didn’t need to avoid were Potter, the Weasleys, and Granger. Not because he had any illusion that they might have a better opinion of him, he was fully aware they had the same reasons to hate him as everyone else here.
“Harry, Malfoy,” Weasley’s voice rang out from the other side of the room. “It’s time to Apparate to the Hippogriff’s nest. Cat will come later and bring food and have a talk with the both of you. Malfoy, do you have any allergies or other dietary regulations?”
“House elf heads, that’s barbaric. I’ve only seen that in the house of my mad… We don’t happen to be in the old Black house, do we?” Draco exclaimed.
“Hello.” Potter’s voice sounded a little shaky.
“Good morning. All this breakfast food, but you don’t have a plate?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
Additionally, I was informed by my ride home that even if you marry a man, you can
“Rule number three. Potions are to be brewed only in the Lab. I’ll vanish any potion brewing utensils I find in the kitchen.” Draco had never seen Po… Harry look so stern.
“Or worse, he might hex or curse me. I know how often people on the street do that, or they spit at me. I can live with the correspondence ending, but I can’t live with seeing hate in his face.”
“Is is Zacharias Smith?” Harry asked.
Maybe despite the fact the cat would probably meow at the top of their voice at any time and eat stinky fish and liver, they might bring him a little bit of comfort, as all his friends were now paired off with him the only single in the group, especially since he had no way of dating anyone. After all, nobody wanted
They were just preparing the drawing room with the tapestry for the bonding itself when Ron’s Animagus appeared. “Harry, there’s been an attempted attack. Quinn got the perp. Send me a message if your present state is safe for work.”
“What sentence is she likely to get?” Draco inquired when Harry had calmed down.
“Er, you think we have to lay low? I hate laying low.” Potter replied in a somewhat petulant voice.
“Sort of, but we gave the Ministry the right to use it as they deem fit for twenty years as reparations. My father was in Voldemort’s Inner circle, and I was marked as a Deatheater, too.” Draco felt the tears well up in his eyes thinking of all the evil things he had done. As every time, when he let the memories get close to him, it seemed to lodge in his throat making it hard to breathe.
“Definitely not; Mother and Conrad will, but the others will Floo out as soon as Mother and Conrad have left the party.”
“Amazing.” Granger wrote something down in a Muggle notepad.
Lucius had waited patiently at the entrance of Diagon Alley. It was humiliating to not just go in, but with the state of health, using even the little magic it took to just open the access to Diagon Alley could kill him. That was the reason they had released him from Azkaban in the first place. He was practically a Squib.
“Oh, Merlin and Morgana, this is perfect for you,” the mirror in the corner exclaimed, and Draco felt a pang of jealousy. He should be the one to praise Potter’s looks.
With a visible cringe, Jonathan replied: “That’s like drying with sandpaper. Cast a Siccatio diffusa.”
“Good morning, love.” Harry’s voice sounded a little husky.
“It was not a good deed, it was only reducing the damage I had done,” he whispered.
Draco felt a very distinct twitch against the zipper of his trousers. Fuck! Potter had always been attractive with his emerald eyes, his black hair and his Seeker’s build, and as a grown man, his baritone voice. “You were my gay awakening.” Draco blurted out.
He looked into Harry’s eyes and felt like a flower that had been in the dark for too long but had finally been brought out into a sunny spot.
“Don’t tell my son how weak I am.” Lucius said, doing his best not to cry.
“Yes, Draco.”
Lucius Abraxas Malfoy
“Harry's a Gryffindor. They don’t beat about the bush. So, Harry how do you feel about being Draco’s best man?” She seemed to consider herself an expert of Gryffindors, since she was dating two of them.
“I hope you have some proper tea, not just that stuff in teabags.”
“Mary, this is your Uncle Harry,” Dudley declared, stroking his daughter’s cheek.
He rang the doorbell, and after a minute the door opened for him, with a melodic chime of Mozart’s Serenade No. 13. As he stepped in, he saw a chubby, androgynous person with short rainbow-coloured hair sitting at a reception desk.

Harry went to the bathroom, and Draco watched the cats grooming each other on the side of the bed-sofa where Harry had been before. Pawter was sprawled on his back, and Meow was licking the black cat’s belly and purring loudly. Draco wondered if this intimacy between these two exceeded the normal sibling-like relationship. He knew that kneazles mated for life, and that gay kneazles weren’t unusual. Pawter and Meow both had kneazle ancestors.

I’m so proud of you.
Opaleye
But Harry wasn’t ready for prank stories. “What are you insinuating? Should I give my cat away to Malfoy of all people?”
“Let’s tell them gradually. For now, it’s enough if our friends and family know. The public can know about our engagement when the wedding date is set.” Draco grinned.
And Draco had sat down at the piano and started belting out this song giving his father defiant glares, clearly calling him a clown.
“Fucking Hippogriffshit!” Draco finally exclaimed. “How am I going to get home with my cat if he doesn’t want to tell your cat goodbye!”
During a walk through Habitat and Selfridges, Draco found that it was not so easy to allow himself to accept his liking for accessories that people would perhaps associate with femininity. There was  a cushion with peacocks that reminded him of how his mother had admonished him never to let his father hear that he pitied the peafowl for not having the splendid green, blue and gold feathers he had seen in a picture.
“That’s our sign. They will be busy looking at it and let us leave.” Harry took his arm and led him out to the front door while everyone else streamed to the back gardens. He picked up two heavy round Muggle contraptions as big as Bubble Head Charms.
sounded through Draco’s head in a smooth, rich baritone voice. Draco didn’t know if he shivered from the voice, or from it coming from the inside of his head. It sounded good, even though he usually found the song obnoxiously upbeat. But then, he had a thing for beautiful men’s singing voices.
“We’ll try out a few different ways of keeping it out of your face and your work, but first things first: Such gorgeous, silky blond curls need tender care. You need a lightweight shampoo and conditioner, and whenever possible, take the time to air dry your hair. What drying charm do you use?” Jonathan sprayed something at Draco’s hair.
“Tesfay. Do you love Harry?”
“Mr. Harry Potter is knowing Mr. Draco Malfoy very well.” Dempy looked into Harry’s eyes in a mixture of hope and worry. Harry gently squeezed the elf’s shoulder in a reassuring manner.
“We have an empty guest room as our second daughter Abbie is too small to want a room of her own. Do you have a family of your own, too?” Dudley looked shy, as he asked.
“Draco, good morning. I have something for you.” Pansy came in and walked up to him.
“I like the Earl Grey better, but I usually prefer Chai latte.” He thought of drinking Chai latte with Sirius and hearing his godfather tell him stories about his parents and grandparents. Sirius had also taught him the three Indian recipes he had learned from Harry’s grandfather, Fleamont.
“Uncle Harry, what’s wrong with Meowfoy? Is he sick?” Teddy looked at Harry with big curious eyes, his head sporting turquoise cat ears.

“Okay, perhaps I’ll think of how to invite them over,” Harry promised, but at the same time, his stomach made a strange flip at the mere thought. How could he handle inviting the man who looked and sounded so much like his favourite wank fantasy but hated Harry with every fiber of his being?
Dear Prongs,
“Because of the way I want to whisk you away to our honeymoon. I’ve planned something, but we can only do that if we're both sober. Also, how can our sex life be safe, sane, and consensual if we start it off drunk?” Harry’s voice took on a timbre that made Draco hope for time to pass fast, so they could get to that soon.
Unlike what Draco had expected, the house rules were quite what he would have set as rules if it had been in his own house – with the one difference of equally dividing up housework. At home, he would do a sixth of the work and the other five sixths were done by the house-elves, but only if there were no guests around, because the elves wouldn’t let him once there were guests. But then, they were not in their employer’s house now.
“Harryyy, you are aware that Draco is my best friend.” Harry nodded, and Pansy continued. “I assure you, that if you were to ask him for cuddles, he would give his
While the act itself had been good, it had scared him off pulling Muggles and convinced him that he was doomed to never have a significant other. A cat would at least be someone with a pulse and a less subservient attitude than Kreacher’s to live in his house. If he was lucky, the cat might even enjoy cuddling.
Narcissa had the vague feeling that the headmistress had been told what Lucius had done to Draco. But could that be? Would she forget her manners for a moment from hearing that someone did something atrocious to Draco Malfoy? Yes, she had allowed him to come back for eighth year, but did she care that much about the fate of a boy who had let Death Eaters into Hogwarts?
Dear Opaleye,
“I would have asked you what it means to you. And then I would have decided what to do. I only want to do this with you if it has the potential of meaning something. Because I don’t want to be the flavour of the day.” Draco fidgeted.

Draco discussed the latest legislation on Animagus registration. He wondered if he were ever able to be allowed, he would like to be an Animagus. But why would they allow him?
“Did I bond myself to Draco?” Harry replied.
“I have seen to it, they are in our account already.”
After a long afternoon of cleaning, baking for the next day with the elves and giving the gnome snacks, carrot pieces from the carrot cake, fruit slices and a little bit of crumble, Draco felt mentally exhausted. Whoever he was bonded to constantly thought very loud.
“Er, excuse me, Emily, but where do we know each other from? Sorry that I forgot that.” Harry needed a lot of courage to ask. Usually he had a better memory of faces.
“I think so, but I’ll only know for sure if you try it on.”
“It’s not an option. Harry’s friends might pop in any time, and I have no idea if they warn us first.” Draco blushed.
Lucius had not told Narcissa and her Mudblood man that he no longer could use magic. It was not something one could tell one’s ex-wife. Even if they had still been married, it was too humiliating a thing to say.
“I’ve written to you for three months fully aware that it’s you, Draco.” Potter looked down shyly. “Hermione told me that you were the expert witness instrumental in repealing the Werewolf Wand Act because it’s incompatible with the Anti-Discrimination Act of 2000. Around the same time, you wrote about borrowing dressrobes to testify before the Wizengamot. I asked Luna if you are Opaleye, and she said yes. I was afraid to reveal my identity because I thought I would lose your friendship if you knew that it’s me. You always detested me.”
“Uncle Harry? I have an uncle here, not in Ghana? We have relatives here?” Mary smiled at Harry, and suddenly flowers appeared in the air.
We are happy to inform you that Queer Eye Wizarding Britain will come to your house in the two weeks from May 4th to May 19th. Due to a scheduling necessity, the recording of the episode will take two weeks of part-time filming instead of one week full-time.
Draco scowled. “He’s not sick. But Bulstrode had to put him into one room with Potter’s Meow. Yes, the Boy Who Lived to be Asinine really named his cat after the sound it makes.”
you have done a lot to save the Malfoy name.
“Lucky sod. With Oliver on the national team, the World Quidditch League determines when we’re allowed to shag.  He had to sign in his contract that bottoming is only allowed off-season. That’s what you get from being out and proud. Now that’s nitpicking.” Percy had rolled his eyes at the thought.
“Grey,” Draco breathed.
“Just don’t let Harry get nervous. He’ll need every bit of his eloquence later.” Theo called out from across the table.
Draco remembered Theophanu Macmillan vaguely. She had been in sixth year and the Hufflepuff prefect during his first year and then took a Potions apprenticeship at Beauxbatons, as he found out during his own apprenticeship under Jean Beauvoir. She had developed an improvement to the Wolfsbane Potion, that could be injected into the body every three months with a charm that reminded the patient of the next due injection. It was a great breakthrough in the treatment of lycanthropy.
“I agree,” Mother’s voice from behind his back startled Draco. “We have wasted too much precious time of our lives caring about houses and names instead of our mental health. Give your life priority over the Malfoy name or the Manor. If you get a chance, move, find someone, find a boyfriend, Draco, even if he’s a Muggle.”
Potter touched their hands with the tip of his wand.
Draco stepped out of the salon, and Harry was overwhelmed by the thought that this beautiful man would spend the day with him. He had always known that Malfoy was good-looking, but today he was looking his very best.
Harry didn’t know why the Muggle job he took was that of a real estate agent. Why had he listened to that divination-obsessed bint? Four years ago, Parvati had told him to; she had insisted that he would find something he had lost by working in that business; and he had just known he needed a Muggle job if he wanted to avoid the unwelcome attention of the wizarding press on a daily basis. He couldn’t just go converting Sirius’ Galleons to Pounds all the time.
The pull from the drain got stronger, Harry felt that he ran out of time. “Let’s discuss this later. You need to get out of here post-haste, or I’ll call Parkinson.”
Pansy left the room where Draco got dressed a little upset. Draco was so determined to go through with the wedding. But there had to be a solution. She had obeyed the blood purist rules of her father through the war, and had harmed others and herself. She wasn’t going to let the blood purists take her best friend’s chance for happiness away from him.
The car stopped at a traffic light, and Karamo narrated: “Draco was nominated by his cousin Luna. He is a potions master and microbiologist at St. Mungo’s, and lives alone, Luna says. Apart from occasionally visiting her and his Saturday lunch with his mother, Draco only moves between the hospital and home. He wears clothes that used to be very posh, but are beginning to get threadbare, because the only new things he bought in the last ten years are labcoats. He doesn’t want to be like his father, who is a bigoted racist obsessed with the most expensive outfits.”
“Would you feel better if you write to him and tell him you are Draco Malfoy? So, if he hates you he won’t come there at all? He won’t come there to hex you or spit at you in front of a camera, and the camera will be there, as he is well aware of.” Karamo suggested.
He was just about to cast a Notice-me-not when Dudley did notice him. “Harry! What a surprise. Can I invite you for a cup of coffee?”
“Yes, that’s me.”
“Sorry, Draco,” George grinned in that way that revealed to Harry that he was not sorry but smug about a successful prank. “I can’t let you both keep believing this thing between you isn’t real, so I smuggled a Veritas toffee on your cake.” He handed Draco a candy “This is the antidote. Take it now, before someone from the Finch-Fletchleys asks what you thought of Mr. Binns-Fletchley’s speech.”
If he had said that aloud in the presence of Ninty, she would have told him: “Draco is having a thing for men, especially if they are having black hair and a pert behind. When is Draco going to be introducing his mate?” She kept telling him to find a “mate” on a regular basis, and on the same regular basis he kept reminding her that he was neither a Veela nor a werewolf, and therefore didn’t “mate.”
“Oh, shit!” Ron exclaimed and subtly pointed at Lucius Malfoy. “Seamus, look who’s there. Why of all nights, does he have to be here tonight?”
Salazar’s saggy balls! He should have been at Pansy’s an hour ago! “Sorry, Pans, I was kind of preoccupied with some... weird things that happened yesterday.”
“You bet your sweet magic it’s better.” Before he knew Malfoy and he were riling each other up again over the pancakes. Although Harry couldn’t really concentrate on the food. Merlin, what was wrong with him, that he got aroused by Malfoy’s bitching at him?
Draco tied the letter to his owl Hekate’s leg, gave her an owl treat and sent her off to Prongs. As far as he knew, everybody who had been a decent person in his family had been disowned. And some were even killed by their own relatives. How could Prongs ever consider him worthy of a friendship if Prongs knew that Opaleye was Draco Malfoy?
“No potions, but what about my clothes? And who will help me when I lose my job?” Draco felt anger rise. He would be sent to Azkaban if he lost his job, his probation was 15 draconic years.
“Pans, I’m the one of us who has the least problems with the Aurors. We’ll stop the bakery for today, and you put a sign out that we’re closing early for family reasons. And then, I’ll go with Draco.” Greg’s bass voice rang with confidence. Draco thought of what a great development his friend had made from the boy who was always in the shadow of Vince, forced to play a part that wasn’t him at all. Draco often wondered, if Vince had tried to be more like Greg, would he still be alive?
She thought about
TW: At the end of this chapter, Draco has an anxiety attack. If that triggers you, you can avoid reading it by stopping after the second letter and skipping to the next chapter. Take good care of yourselves.
“He’s healthy, but unfortunately he’s become friends with the cat of someone who’s always hated me. And I don’t know how to help him. I’m considering asking that man to sell his cat to me.” Harry said in a tired voice.
The Patronus memory calmed them enough to remember that Father would not be able to cast any more difficult spells anymore. All he could do to them was sit there and glare daggers. And Draco noticed something else. Seamus and his Auror partner Morag MacDougal, sitting in their Auror robes with Father in their field of vision; their wands at the ready. They showed Father how ready to protect Draco they were.
“So, you and Draco didn’t shag? What a waste of a perfectly good night.” Pansy gave him a discerning look as if he was very slow on the uptake.
your voice like velvet...FUCK IT! Sorry Draco, I can’t sing and I’m pants at rapping.”
“Rude!” Malfoy yelled after them.
“A lot of it is pretty nice actually. We like the same music and his comments turn a stupid movie into comedic gold. The house smells of his cologne, and we planned to try out things we missed in our fucked-up childhoods.” Harry grinned thinking of the list he had taken from the fridge and hidden in the drawer lest Parkinson or Zabini find it.
Please, make sure to be available for our team during that time. An arrangement for working times will be made directly with your employer.
“I’m Astoria Greengrass,” she helped him out. “Are you going to see Draco’s show?”
But Harry just gave him a wide smile and replied in a soft voice. “We’ll take it as slow as you want. I’ll take care of you, darling.”
“Nonsense. You’ll stay here and either have the Manor decontaminated or forget it exists at all.” Potter said sternly.
They finally did weave around their owners’ but when Meow weaved around Harry, Paw followed, and then Meow followed Paw around Draco’s legs.
As the second wave of Ministry employees came to eat, and Draco cleaned tables close to the people queuing for their food, suddenly, he heard someone yell. “Eww, what’s that? Ouch!”
Although Luna was the kind of person who rarely cast a Tempus, she seemed to have a rather good sense of timing. As usual, Draco was surprised how precisely on time she arrived at the Manor. And he was grateful that she visited him at all, having been imprisoned in the dungeons during the war. “You changed the magic of every single room after your father’s imprisonment. And I am only in the Winter Garden, which was least affected because the dittany your mother grew here actively unravelled dark magic.” She would always tell him when he brought up his gratitude.
When they had finished cooking, Karamo sat down with Draco outside the hut. “How has it been to have five men walk into your life and shake it up?”
- the second programme - to end up in each other’s arms. It happened in Blaise’s guest bedroom at Neville’s birthday party. They both had been in no fit state to Apparate home, and Neville had shooed them into the same room with a weirdly smug grin.
“Do I know the lucky witch or wizard?” Draco asked while sitting down at the table.
“Luna, who nominated you for Queer Eye, told me you’ll have a date at the end of the two weeks. You will meet your pen pal Prongs in person.” The expression on Tan’s face suddenly reminded Draco of Professor McGonagall--not the looks he had seen on her face when he used to parrot his father, the look when she told him that he would come back to take his NEWTs at Hogwarts. Unflinching, stern, but reassuring.
Draco stared at the scales. Was limiting the damage a good deed? He had not even thought much except not wanting to get caught by anybody.
“It’s true. I’m not only gay, I’ve wanted you ever since I knew what sex is. And I can’t imagine anything better than the thought of waking up beside you every morning for the rest of my life. Yet, I can’t.” Tears streamed across Draco’s face. “The ring curse my mother overheard wasn’t the first one. I must marry a descendant of the Greengrass family. Father cursed me with the ring before. All I can offer you is that if you are single and willing in seven years from now, then I’m allowed to have someone on the side, but, Harry, you really could do better than be an illegitimate affair.”
Draco had a hard time keeping his composure when the cat looked at him. The eyes were a similar emerald tone as Potter’s, and the scar, though it had a different shape than Potter’s was also reminiscent of the Golden Boy’s.
“I hope it isn’t an inconvenience, would you mind Paw sharing his room with another cat if they get along well? We have to put two cats into the same room due to some unforeseeable circumstances at the moment.” Mick gave him a convincing look.
The question had only been how to propose in a way that showed his love for Draco appropriately. Harry had secretly taken singing and dancing lessons for this proposal. And he fervently hoped that his voice would sound better than drunk karaoke. He had found out that learning to sing well, might take longer than he wanted to wait. But Blaise had given him some good advice, and today was the day. Harry was nervous because of the public. But very giddy when he imagined the ring on Draco’s finger.
He still didn’t know how he could have saved his mother, but he was sure he had done everything wrong.
He scolded himself in his thoughts for his paranoia. He might cast an Animagum Revelio later, but definitely not in Luna’s presence. That would be rude. He did, however, look into her eyes, and was greatly relieved that there was no sign of her being under the Imperius. Damn, Harry, if Muggles see Mother Theresa or Elvis Presley on a cornflake, and it’s by coincidence, then a resemblance between a cat and Malfoy can be a coincidence, too.
“Because of all the things you did after that. And, Draco, I see you as someone who could easily be more than a friend.” Harry took Draco’s hand.
Potter laughed - a full belly laugh, like he would usually laugh with his friends. No, he must be laughing at him. “Malfoy, they have a nice house already, they are here to help me figure out how to help you.”
It was fun, but now I feel self-conscious, because of the way I’m living, having my room full of stuff, but only two trunks full of stuff are my own. It’s like everyone else inhabits my life more than me.
Draco felt numb. Forgiving oneself - wasn’t that something for small sins, for things like smoking gillyweed and splinching yourself or stealing candies for three Galleons at Honeyduke’s? Draco didn’t think it was for letting the Deatheaters into Hogwarts or trying to kill Dumbledore.
And then they catch you. That person catches you, and their arms are the strongest things that you've ever felt. Not even the foundation of your childhood home could support you - and yet these arms come out of nowhere and they hold you up, as if you're something to be appreciated. And even though you aren't, even though you're
“Look at what we have here,” the man drawled. He sounded bored and amused at the same time; like a cat toying with a mouse. “Malfoy’s boy and the Chosen One. How cute. Does Daddy know?”
Harry leaned forward on his broomstick, the weight of his body propelling it
Draco chewed on his bottom lip and thought about it. The painting was coming along well, better than he thought it would have. The jawline was nearly perfect, the chin just the right amount of boyish fat giving way to rugged structure. His torso flowed elegantly to his abdomen and lower to his hips, where amber skin gave way to the dark grey of Harry's pants. A few weeks prior they had decided that Harry shouldn't wear shoes; his bare feet were placed against the fabric of the seat with grace.
“I’m so sorry too,” Harry kissed him again. “I’m so sorry.”
, he promised with every ounce of his tormented soul.
Draco knew going in that the Ministry had sent he and Harry on a suicide mission. “Find the last of the Death Eaters,” they said. “It’ll be fine,” they said. “Just bring them in or kill them,” they said.
"What are you suggesting?" Draco asked slowly, speaking as if he was conversing with a three year old.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Harry quipped, turning around to face him. He was shuffling a deck of playing cards casually in his hands, his eyebrow raised. Draco breathed out in defeat and his chest deflated right along with his ego.
“What can I get for ya, handsome?” she asked, her red lips tilting up at the one side in a small smirk. He racked his brain trying to think of what to get; obviously a butterbeer was out of the question.
"Why do you even try?" Ron mumbled, glaring at his fellow Gryffindor across the table. "Honestly. You're rubbish."
“Just a rum and Coke, please,” he replied, remembering the few times he and Hermione had gone out for a drink. She’d always ordered for him (and drank most of it too). It sounded about right.
He stopped half-way through getting up, his arm extended toward Harry in a futile attempt to get the book back. He sighed and plopped down on the stone step, defeated. By the end of the hour the entire school would know about it. Harry would surely tell everyone. Draco began to mentally prepare a list of insults and threats to attack Harry with.
Draco pulled back, his eyes wide. But, he didn't point his wand, and he didn't shove Harry away. His eyes were curious and guarded, sizing up Harry and his intentions.
The words hung between the two men and the air was thick with tension. Something flickered in Draco’s grey eyes but was gone just as soon as it had appeared.
The words hung in the air between them, settling into the stonework and their bones as dust settles on old memories.
"I can never get it right," he found himself saying, "it gets on my nerves."
- didn’t get scared.
"How do you want me to draw you?" Draco asked, standing up a little bit straighter. While he was more than slightly confused he was also extremely excited; he had Harry fucking Potter, alone, in the Room of Requirement, who was willing to lounge somewhere and let Draco draw him.
Harry spun upside down on his broom and looked over at him.
To be frank it was a miracle he hadn’t ended up at Godrick’s Hollow, given what day it was. Halloween; a night of tricks, treats, and the death of his parents. He hadn’t known why the holiday had rubbed him the wrong way for as long as he could remember. His earliest childhood memories of Halloween included Dudley strutting about in whatever “cute” costume Aunt Petunia brought home and the family going out to parties while he stayed with Ms. Figg.
