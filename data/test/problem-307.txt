HALEY
She couldn't eat the cupcake! Then her whole plan would be ruined. Her whole clever plan of waiting in the dungeons at nine o'clock when she should be up in her own tower, doing her homework or getting ready for bed. But no, she was down here in the cold, waiting for that prat of a Slytherin because her naive little brother had given her the idea that sweets solve everything. And apparently, she was stupid enough to actually give it a try.
"Pansy! Are you daft? My tea!" Draco exclaimed, barely keeping the hot fluid from spilling all over them.
He rubbed the back of his neck. “No, I meant… I wanted to ask… is it – is it true? That you’re… going out with Malfoy?”
"Haley, is something bothering you? You keep frowning and stabbing at your food."
"What...?" The boy asked, seeming dazed and confused. There was a slight crease between his brows and his lower lip was jutting out, almost pouting. How cute he looked. Haley wanted to
"What? Now it's my fault? She said she wasn't sick, okay? She said it herself!"
Draco wanted to yell.
"I – Did Pansy–"
She nodded. "Apparently owls dream, too."
"I think so?"
"But," George continued, raising his pointer finger. "Before we go on to realize our talents elsewhere, we're planning to give Hogwarts one last present."
", he exclaimed, once he'd spotted the blonde girl, that was currently sitting at
"Yes." The girl nodded to emphasize her point. "See? Why would he help me if he was plotting against me? And that was even before Voldemort returned."
"Shall I pay him a visit tomorrow night?"
you say?" She asked.
She frowned. First?
What was the use of feelings anyway?
It wouldn't budge. His head was stuck inside the blasted thing. A manic laugh left his throat. Then another. Then another. Then it was completely quiet again. He really hated Haley Potter. Why did she always have to turn his life into a complicated mess?
Haley glared at him.
"That he's in lo- that he has feelings for me. Non-platonic feelings," I whisper, trying to make it sound as meaningless as possible.
"Wait," he called, suddenly remembering something.
Haley raised the cup to her lips and let the rich taste of peppermint calm her nerves.
"My godfather," she said quietly. "It's Sirius' handwriting."
It's so weird seeing her like this. She looks no older than me.
The boy only grunted, which could have meant anything. But Haley was sure he'd be more responsive once they weren't in the vicinity of the quidditch field any more.
"No, no, no, that can't be. That can't-" Haley's throat began to tighten up. She looked up in search of one face in particular. Malfoy was packing up his things. The git had surely handed in his potion already. There was a disgustingly amused grin on his face that made Haley growl in anger. He wasn't even looking at her, which made it all the more evident. It had been him. All of it. She knew it. But she couldn't prove it.
And just when I thought it couldn't get even worse Malfoy does something that makes me doubt my state of sanity.
"Rook to A4." He said, instead of answering her question. Simon cursed.
His ears were turning a fiery red. "I said we should go there, right? I mean, people go there when they're on a date, don't they? But then Hermione said… she said '
Then she took a deep breath and opened her eyes. They were red-rimmed, as if she had been crying.
! Do you think I won't hurt you just because I can't use my wand?" He grabbed one of the ice cream bowls from the table and hurled it against the wall. It was the strawberry one, leaving sad pink streaks of ice cream on the wood.
"So, um… are you going to stay at Hogwarts over the holidays?" Draco asked in a casual tone. He hadn't meant to ask that directly but perhaps it was for the best. There was no room for misunderstandings at least.
"Let's just go down, all right?" Her friend walked toward the portrait door, leaving her to follow him.
She stood from her seat and rushed off toward her room for the second time that night.
"You should have seen it! That Malfoy may be a slimy brat and all that but man, the emotion in his eyes almost made
"But Haley," Hermione placed her arms on the table, staring at her friend even more intensely. "Do you even have an idea what you're doing? You might be seriously harming him!" She whispered this, so no one at the table besides them was able to overhear.
She glared at the boy. "Oh, yeah? All you ever do is worry! You're worried about our relationship, you're worried the time's not right, you're worried we're too young, you're worried I'm a monster!" She stopped herself, glaring at him angrily. "But I'm not the monster here! I would never do something like this to another person!"
"But how…? So, are you playing after all?" Emily asked in confusion.
"A world?" That really was the last thing she'd expected.
"I'm not admitting anything! You tricked me!"
Now what the heck was
They stopped in front of a green patch of grass that was surrounded by tall trees. Around them the red, orange and yellow leafs were dancing, caught in the light autumn breeze that was blowing softly.
Haley nodded. "I didn't mean to. It just…" She exhaled shakily. "He got suspicious because of the handkerchief and then – and then… I hated lying to him and it just… it slipped out…" She bit her lips, hesitantly looking at him. "I'm sorry. I know I should have talked to you about it first. It's not only my secret."
!" He said with a frown, "I gave you that note, remember? I was the one who told you to meet me in front of the kitchens that night. I gave the gillyweed to Dobby and asked him to give it to you! That was all
, she'd convinced herself. But maybe it had been more. Maybe he'd been telling her something entirely different all along. Even Snape had seen it right away. That was why he had sent her away…
him to stop with his drumming and give her all of the details. Only then he would graciously save her from dying of curiosity.
.There was movement behind the shelf opposite his. Long, flowing blond locks. It was the girl from the other night! The Ravenclaw that had helped get him out of the helmet. When had she arrived? She was watching him; shaking her head slightly.
"Dumbledore will be here soon. Tell him Haley is in danger. She's gone to the Ministry and the Order is on their way."
"Our doors resemble our inner selves," mum answers, "I was surprised, too when I first saw your door."
"That was something," he commented, sounding impressed. "But it's not the right tune."
For a moment Malfoy had seemed elated at the recognition in her voice. Now
"Here's the form."
Their coats which were much too thick for the warm September air were dropped to the ground, forming a makeshift blanket.
"Obviously I wasn't," Draco stated with a sigh, "Why is your hair red?"
"Potter," Parkinson sneered derisively. It was pathetic how she seemed to be imitating Malfoy's usual tone. "Get lost. This is none of your business."
"What are you… How…?" Haley blinked at him absently.
Draco wanted to follow him but on top of everything the door was locked. Ridiculous.
He kept dying again and again and again.
I hesitantly sit on the edge of the bed. "I…" My voice is too high! I need to make it sound deeper. I clear my throat. "So…" That's better. "why are you not supposed to leave your room?" I ask, going in straight for the kill.
Hugs and butterfly kisses to yall,
." The boy spat disdainfully. How had the professor even got the idea that there was something between him and Potter? The girl hadn't told him, had she? Or worse, he hadn't forced her to tell him by torturing her or something like this? He couldn't think straight. All he knew was he had to protect his secret. He had to protect
She watched him in a curious way. Oh right, she had asked him a question.
," he drawled with an eye-roll. "I feel like I could fight a dragon."
. "Why?" She squeezed his hand, not quite ready to meet his gaze yet.
"All of my concerts?" He seemed to like the sound of that. Then his brows furrowed. "Even if I can't make any spells work? Even if people call me a… squib? You'll still stay by my side?" His voice dripped with bitterness.
She had stepped right into a heap of dried leaves that were making crinkling sounds underneath her shoes.
to be cruel to you? Why would I do that?"
know? Pick one."
way, causing her gaze to fall to the ground dejectedly. It simply wasn't right. Potter never looked like this. She was strong and fierce and proud! Not… not…
She was so lovely when she was riled up like this. Full of life and passion. How could he ever abandon her?
The Occlumency session that night didn't start out as a disaster. Haley was determined to keep her cool and not show that she was upset in any way. She tried to think of anything that did not relate to Draco, focusing on good memories instead, like getting her Hogwarts letter or finding out, she could leave the Dursleys and live at Hogwarts instead…
Something is different about the dream corridor. Before, mum's door was to the right and Simon's left of my own. On the opposite side was a door surrounded by snitches and broomsticks with a lion's head as a door knob. Dad's door, pretty sure. I've come up with a theory: Doors close to your own door mirror how close you are to the person dreaming behind it. Dad's door has moved further right, so now it's exactly opposite mum's door. And the free space opposite my own door… is now occupied by a door with a Myron Wagtail poster. Draco Malfoy's door. It used to be further down the hall somewhere far beyond Simon's door. But I've noticed it coming closer and closer during the last weeks. I wonder what it means that it has moved directly opposite mine now.
“Right.” He seemed uncomfortable for some reason. “What about Ron?”
Although she was only a fourth year, there obviously was a reason why Luna was in Ravenclaw. She'd given him her research notes weeks ago hoping to get his opinion or something but he had been too stressed about exams to spare a look on them. He found them inside his History of Magic book of all things. But what was more important was in how much detail his friend had explained and listed how she thought the golem magic worked and what to be careful of. It seemed she'd been especially fascinated by this branch of magic. In childish scrawly letters it said:
That decided it. The horrifying image of being picked to oblivion by that terrifying long and sharp beak. She had made her bed now she had to lie in it. It wasn't like she was agreeing to get married. This was harmless really. She rummaged around for a quill and some ink in her drawer and quickly scribbled an answer on the back of the note.
"Like Malfoy's a saint!" Haley fired back in anger.
"Sometimes people need time to get used to something new. Especially when they have been thinking of it in a different way for a long time." She tilted her head to the side. "I'm sure she'll come to to think of you as 'Draco' eventually."
"I don't remember the last time I played." He admits, gazing out of the window longingly.
Malfoy scoffed at that. "Who said my intentions were honest?"
"We're not done with that conversation!" Her friend called, as she turned to follow her captain out of the Great Hall. Haley waved at her over her shoulder but didn't reply. If she was lucky Hermione would be too busy with one of their many assignments to even notice her and Ron returning.
That's interesting. I can't wait to really explore all the doors in the dream corridor.
It was silent for a moment. Was Potter really taking her clothes off? Nobody would know if he had a little peek… Slowly, his hand wandered to the doorknob…
"I see. You will go there and then… fight against your own father?"
The beginning of the end. The final exam had finally come. History of Magic. This whole torture was finally coming to an end. There were so many things he planned to do afterwards. Like looking more into the connection between Snape and Lily Evans. And coaxing that secret out of Haley. After the exams. That was what she had promised. And one good thing about Gryffindors was that they always kept their promises.
"Well," she sighed. "At first we thought it was Luna who you were secretly meeting like Ron said but… the more I thought about it, things didn't quite match up." Hermione's brow were scrunched up slightly in what Haley liked to call her Sherlock Holmes face. Her mind was off pondering the facts, leaving the emotions for later. She didn't know whether to be glad about the reprieve or whether to be anxious for the delayed reaction.
." He hissed in annoyance. He might have a soft spot for the blonde Ravenclaw but she was seriously getting on his nerves in that moment.
It was enough to make her give up the battle and let her body sink to the ground completely.
"That's right," she pouted. "You should definitely appreciate me more."
She doesn't answer right away. And when she does, her tone is hesitant… thoughtful. "I think… you should… confirm your assumption first."
With a flick of his wand, he lifted the spell, and half-caught her, before she hit the floor.
"I…" he bites his lips, looking at his fingers where he's playing with a green gobstone that looks eerily familiar. It's the one my sleeping body is wearing as a bracelet in that exact moment. In the next second the gobstone is gone.
"It's nothing," she whispered, suddenly aware of how close their faces were. It seemed like Malfoy noticed it as well. His eyes were wandering over her face like he was trying to commit each little detail to memory.
"What are you going to do about it?" Malfoy asked condescendingly, "Throw a geranium at me?"
"Hm?"
The potion master folded his hands on the table, eyeing him with something similar to sympathy. "If you want to protect her," he paused. "You need to let her go."
The first steps were an easy routine. Heating up the water. Adding ingredients. Stirring the liquid. He'd done that a thousand times. He didn't know how much time had gone by when the potion was ready and it was time to sprinkle the golem with it. He filled up a small flask with the light blue liquid, ready to pour it over the golem.
"Dobby – what happened? Is Haley alright?" She asked, still out of breath from hurrying up the stairs. Dobby turned around too quickly. The many pairs of socks made him slip and fall to the ground. Reflexively, Hermione offered her hand to help him up. But as soon as she touched him, he disappeared, swiftly taking her along with him.
She crossed that out, too. It was all wrong. How was she supposed to put into words how she felt?
Draco nodded, still with that smug grin dancing on his lips. Which was peculiar, seeing as this seemed like an ordinary guitar pick made out of polished wood. Spinning around itself like mad. She had a dozen of those at home. So why-?
"Welcome to Godric's Hollow!" She said, smiling at Draco and pulling him down the street toward the small green fence that surrounded their garden. In that moment she would have loved nothing more than showing him around and telling him about all her favourite places and her childhood adventures but she felt that the time wasn't right. He probably wanted to get everything over with quickly and then… well, what happened then would depend on whether their plan succeeded or not.
He was watching her as if he was expecting a certain reaction. She returned the gaze just as expectantly.
"Like a photograph? Or a memory?" Haley asked, still wondering where this was going.
Hermione frowned. "What do you mean by 'mistake'?"
Haley groaned. She wanted these stupid pre-exams to be over already.
"What happens if you break the code?" He asked.
I can't help it. The mental image makes me chuckle. "Simon. Why would you run away? I'm sure it would have been fine-"
"I should really go now." She said defiantly. "But thank you for… you know… this." She didn't know how to put it into words properly. But she knew that Ron wasn't someone who easily talked about feelings.
"Of course," Haley made sure to convey that she really meant what she said, "Good luck with your assignments!"
Haley sighed. Then she scooted over to Draco and looped one of her arms around his. "Oh, don't mind him. He won't hurt you. He's as soft as a teddy bear, really."
Haley shook her head. But then she sighed, sitting up against the headboard.
"I guess my body needed it." She snorted disbelievingly.
But he wasn't in potions either.
What a sly fox. I shouldn't have underestimated him.
A loud plop made her jerk backwards and the sleeping boy almost fall out of his chair. Had the sound come from the dormitories?
She looked at him curiously.
"You… and me." She said it like it was something obvious. It
Draco seems confused.
"Have you been counting hippogriffs?" Mum asks, as she enters the room. I pout. I was just going to leave.
"Potter, you're crushing my fingers! Are you mad?" He exclaimed and tore his hand and eyes away from her. He didn't look flustered or seem affected by her at all.
"Still, that doesn't give you the right to tamper with his memories!" Hermione seemed to be in full morality mode. It really was a good thing she hadn't told her what she had
The words startled Haley. She frantically looked around the Great Hall. But she couldn't find anyone that was staring at her. Not even at the Slytherin table.
HALEY
"If you say so," he drawled, grinning smugly. It was less annoying somehow. His grin. It seemed almost… cheerful. But… no. That wasn't right.
"What was that?" He asked, eyeing something behind her warily. Before she could turn around or wonder what that strange squeaking sound might belong to, Draco was already rushing past her to check.
"You're right of course. But you know, sometimes you actually need to hear something spelled out in order to believe it. And I can tell you there's nothing a girl likes more than hearing the guy she likes say '
been doing.
They continued along the path leading them toward a low wooden fence, that had a sign saying "Editor of the Quibbler" nailed to it. It looked like they had found the right house. Just as Ron was opening the gate, a girl with long blonde hair came bouncing toward them from behind the house.
For a moment, she allowed herself to really look at the sleeping boy. He looked so innocent that you might think he had never done a bad deed in his life. Well… Haley knew better. She could do anything she wanted to him now. Get revenge for all the times he had treated her badly. Nothing was there to stop her. Nothing except the tiny fact that Malfoy clearly trusted her not to harm him. Otherwise he wouldn't have been able to just fall asleep like that. No matter how tired he was. But maybe this was only a test. Maybe he wanted to know what she would do with such an opportunity. But that was stupid. It didn't make sense. Hadn't he said earlier that he had barely slept the night before? Or had that been a lie? Well, it couldn't hurt to let him sleep for a bit. Maybe she could try and sort out her feelings in the mean time.
"And?" It's probably the most stupid thing I could have asked. But there is this weird electric tension in the air that makes me almost doubt that this is a dream. It feels too real. Too intimate. The dark night… the fireflies… the music… the dancing…
"Would I have told you about this in the first place if I didn't trust you to be responsible enough?"
Draco turned around. Luna Lovegood was sitting on the windowsill, lit up by the starlight that fell into the hall through the window behind her.
"B-but-" Haley started.
"Why not? This is a dream. I could also turn into a dragon, if I wanted." Strangely enough this makes sense. But why would she –
"That's too bad," I reply, feigning disappointment, "I guess I won't be able to get in after all."
watching that dragon spit fireballs at you. I didn't understand why…" He shook his head. "Shouldn't the sight of you fighting for your life make me happy?" For a second he looked at her as if the issue still confused him. "But instead I started to have nightmares. In which
"Merlin, Haley. Stop playing dumb. Can't you see what's going on here?" She asked in exasperation, throwing her hands up in the air. She sighed. "You have to tell him before he makes even more of a fool of himself!" She bit her lips, her eyes glistening wet. Were those angry tears?
"W-wait, shouldn't you
"Night, Potter," he drawled. Then he turned around and vanished in the direction of the dungeons.
"But-"
him. Or shower him with kisses. There was a strange pull in her chest that left her feeling slightly feverish and brought a fresh wave of affection with it. All those new feelings were threatening to burst out of her. What was she supposed to do with them? Her heart was beating madly, as if it was trying to remind her that she was alive. She squeezed her eyes shut and lay back on her coat, trying to calm her racing heart. Perhaps she was going to die.
"No."
While Malfoy sputters, "I – you weren't supposed – It's not – I didn't want–" I take in the picture in front of me.
"Yes, luckily for you, your class mate was clever enough to inform me of your incredibly reckless endeavour."
"What's that?" Haley asked, frowning at the charm hanging from the chain. "Is that a pick?"
"Who does he think he is?" She whispered to herself once her breathing was somewhat normal again. This was insane! Couldn't the git once and for all decide what he wanted from her? Fighting one another with words she could handle. Being ignored was bearable as well. But if he decided to be a jerk then he should just bloody well stick to his decision. What was she supposed to think when one day he behaved like an utter git only to act like he cared the next?
"Yeah, of course." Haley replied hoarsely. She didn't feel too bad. She felt lighter somehow. Like when you stood in the middle of a storm and realised the wind wasn't going to hurt you but instead let it breeze through your insides, removing everything that weighed you down.
Haley wanted to leap over and do something. Stop them. Break them apart. Make them
"Don't worry," she said. "I'll-" Haley stopped. His eyes were closed. He hadn't fallen asleep, had he? "Draco?"
"Why should I? I'm talking to this lot!" Ginny argued but she simply couldn't win against her mother's stubbornness. When it was just Hermione, Ron and Haley again, Haley couldn't bear the heavy looks from her friends any more and excused herself by taking her half-eaten breakfast down to the kitchen. Haley felt their worried eyes on her for the rest of the day. It was obvious that Hermione was itching to ask her at least a thousand questions. But for whatever reason she seemed to hesitate. Haley didn't complain.
"Professor Umbridge," He started. "I think some of the squad should come with you to look after–"
So instead, she took his hand and squeezed it.
"One day, I'll show them to you," she whispered. "My dreams." She touched the shadows beneath his eyes as if to wipe them away.
"But we haven't heard the rest of the story yet!" Haley protested, raising her arm and almost upsetting her plate. "Or have we?"
"All right. You go and have fun!" Haley wished, feeling only slightly guilty for lying to her.
"You're bloody cheating!" He burst out indignantly. He'd never been good with losing. "I saw it first!"
"You… you…what?" Angelina echoed.
The words make something happen inside me. I should be angry that he resents one of my closest friends – or former closest friends – but instead my insides fill with warmth and a feeling of light giddiness. I want to
. Haley had made them for
"I've been looking for you." She added, wondering how long this strange calmness of him would last. It was so different from the rage.
"Fine," he agreed, "What shall I write?" He looked at the Ravenclaw expectantly. But to his immense disappointment she gave him a look that clearly said, '
“Told you, you’re protective,” Draco whispers close to my ear. I roll my eyes.
Hey everyone! I might have went a little wild with the braiding scene. I was aiming for something cute. Well... it was less strange in my mind xD Thanks for reading and leave me your thoughts :)
"I'm parched," he complains, walking toward a little cabinet in the corner and pulling out two caramel coloured bottles. "Butterbeer?" He asks, holding one of the bottles out to me.
"Mum used to tell me all about it when I was younger," there was a faraway look on the girl's face, "But she never got to tell me where it was."
"And you know that how?"
"Oh that?" Haley said, trying to sound surprised. She balanced the pile of books against her hip and fished out the note with her free hand. At least it was folded. With slightly shaking fingers she opened the note and let her eyes flick over it quickly. She recognised the writing at once. But there was no time to go over the meaning now. First she needed to convince her friends that it wasn't anything important.
"It doesn't matter." It was more important to get to the others now. Hopefully everyone was okay –
"I – what? What are you-" Neville looked to Haley sheepishly. She shook her head, chuckling,
He was locked. In this infernal bathroom. He didn't know for how long he had been sitting here. Worrying. It might have been hours. The waiting was the worst. Making his imagination run wild, painting scenarios of Haley being tortured or dying in all kinds of brutal ways.
Well, then. I asked. If he doesn't want to tell me, it's not my problem. I sigh. "Hey Simon?" I ask after a while.
he would see her again.
"What were you doing then?" She asked playfully, one corner of her mouth was tilting upwards slowly.
"And what?" Sirius repeated, in a suspiciously calm tone.
"How about… Neville?" Mum suggests with a sly smirk.
"For Merlin's sake, what do you want then?" Haley sat up and finally opened her eyes, which didn't help much. Where were her glasses?
"No promises," she replied with a grin. Then she waved at him one last time and walked out of the kitchen.
"Er… just be a darling and get me one of those avocado sandwiches?" She fluttered her eyelashes sweetly. "I'll tell you what this is about later." She probably wouldn't but that didn't matter at that moment.
"That reminds me," Haley remembered, the talk of the Great Lake had triggered her memory, "How did you get Dobby to help you out with the gillyweed? I mean, I know he used to 'work' for your family but… I didn't get the impression he was your biggest fan… so to speak."
Haley raised her eyebrows in a doubtful way.
coming from the open door.
"I could help if you want," he suggested, surprising himself, "It's not like there's much else for me to do anyway. We don't want your grades to suffer after all," he added with a smirk. It was kind of hypocritical of him, seeing as he hadn't cared much for his own studies lately. He found his mind occupied with other things more and more frequently, making it hard to concentrate. Well, he was sure Snape wouldn't mind too much if he didn't hand in
"Fine. How about… um… how about…" He trailed off, never finishing his sentence. A faint blush was littering his pale face, making Haley wonder what he had been thinking about.
He shook his head. "Not just that. It's also rela-"
It didn't make her heart pound faster or make her feel butterflies in her stomach.
Until Lucius Malfoy lunged after
She blinked at him, as if she'd just woken from a dream. "He's dead." She chuckled darkly. "Yes… and whose fault is that?"
Luna tilted her head to the side. "Maybe you're right. But at least she knows now."
Dennis shrugged again. "It was his fault, you missed one hour of training today, wasn't it?" He mumbled irritably.
"But… but that was Dobby! I got the gillyweed from Dobby!"
"You will?" He sounded like a little boy. It was too cute.
He wasn't. Still, no sign of him either. The whole of lunch break she spent looking for him, forgetting to eat her pumpkin pie. She was on her third cup of coffee. During Care for Magical Creatures, she even considered asking Pansy Parkinson for help! Luckily, she came to her senses before actually going through with it. To dispel the idea and do something more productive, Haley sneaked off toward the tree house after Hagrid's lesson. Maybe she'd find him there.
"That's my quill," she said accusingly. She was standing in front of him now.
She was right. He'd heard it, too. He would recognize her voice everywhere. Potter was talking to someone. And it sounded like she was really close.
Haley was very tempted to say "Duh!". But she overcame the urge. She was already starting to like Luna. The Ravenclaw was surprisingly… refreshing.
"It'll be fine." He says and pulls the face-thief into his arms. "I'm here," he soothes, rubbing her back gently. Does he believe he can heal her with his mere presence? How can he be so gentle with her? How can he be so caring when he dreams and be a nightmare in real life?
"So stubborn," he tsked, "just admit it already." He was on his side next to her now, slightly leaning over her with one hand still holding hers and the other resting next to her face. His face only inches above her own.
"We need a password," Malfoy informed her, gesturing toward the umbrella.
"What's wrong?" Hermione asked gently.
"I don't like you," she offered instead. "Not one bit."
Draco frowned. "Does she miss you that much? Won't she see you in three weeks anyway?"
It was nice somehow. Simply sitting next to each other and having lunch together. Haley almost forgot that this wasn’t her friend but – well… someone she had to be wary of at all times.
He leaned his head against the door, so he could hear the sounds of steps that slowly retreated again until it was completely quiet once more. Draco sighed in relief, turning around to face his girlfriend. Haley was staring at her feet forlornly. The high towering shelves surrounding her, stocked with dull dusty jars made her look incredibly small.
"Why did you come here to ask me, then?"
Giving him a soft smile.
"Of course," he purred. "Are you still doubting my charms?"
"You're leading her right to Haley."
From the way Longbottom swallowed nervously, he could tell it was indeed his.
Draco shot her a dark look.
"Hm, that's not how he phrased it but… I guess you could say that."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Where's Ron?" Haley asked as soon as she'd reached the girls.
Snape lifted an eyebrow. Silently asking for an explanation. Why was he even telling the man all of this? Sometimes, it felt as if he was pulling his thoughts right out of his head.
He frowned. "I wasn't – hey! Why is he purring now? Why is he letting that git
"I… I don't really know where to start…" Haley admitted, pulling her knees up to her chest.
"Oh, this? We were just wondering what kind of letter this could be. It's obviously a

Her glare was pure fire. Burning. Scorching. Destroying.
“Oh.” He sounds honestly surprised.
"Why?" My voice comes out calmer than I feel. "Why?" I place the butterbeer beside me with a

"Er… Haley?" Well, hugging wasn't exactly the boy's speciality. He seemed unsure what to do with his arms. Haley chuckled and hugged him tighter.
Her godfather's brows furrowed. "What is it then? You're scaring me, here," he whispered, reaching out his hand and brushing a lone tear from her cheek.
"Because it
instead.
Should he tell her? Did she really need to know about this? Or would it only worry her? Draco balled up the anonymous letter in his fist, throwing it into the air and catching it again as he wondered what to do about it.
I going to say? Where should I start?
"Well, you know Malfoy… You might as well try to get answers from Snape."
He shook his head. That seemed terribly cynical. What kind of a person was her dad? Well, if he was the chief editor of
"And then?" He asked in a hoarse voice.
"Sirius!" She cried, sinking to the sandy ground. "Sirius come back! Sirius!"
She couldn't imagine living like that. Always assuming others were trying to use you. Constantly mistrusting everyone. Maybe that explained why Malfoy was so messed up? Maybe he had simply never learned… how to be nice to others?
He had to pay close attention now. The dark-haired one – Conners? Corns? – was marching to a nearby table with more Ravenclaws. This was getting more boring by the second!
"There is a DA team?" Luna asked curiously.

She rolled her eyes and skipped over to his other side. She cleared her throat pointedly, curling her fingers outward invitingly.
Nothing. Without her permission the colour of the boy's hair in her imagination changed from dark brown to white blond. It should have been a telling sign how her treacherous heart stopped for a second as she imagined herself in the arms of the boy that had come so close to actually kissing her this afternoon. But she couldn't allow herself to listen to it. Or to lose herself in such a ridiculous fantasy. What she did let herself remember however was the way he had looked at her before he had started to lean in closer. For a tiny moment his eyes had held so much emotion…
I'm pretty sure my heart just stopped. He can't be serious, right? He can't be…
"Charms?" Draco completed.
Haley shrugged, sitting down at the table with her book clutched to her chest. "It's a brilliant book."
"Hermione, are you coming?" Haley asked, suddenly afraid her friend had noticed Luna slipping her the note.
"But Draco's not," she said quietly, almost silently, her voice delicate like a snowflake. It touched her in a surprising way. "He actually helped me with the Triwizard Tournament."
"Anyway," Hermione continued, "Are you coming, Haley?"
"I didn't know." He whispered. "I only found out through that blasted interview. I wish you would have told me."
"I got them," he repeated. "The letters you wrote."
On the way out of their Defence class, someone almost knocked her over from behind.
"A chocolate dragon." She murmured. How unexpected.
He chuckled lightly. "No. It's fine. It just… feels as if a thunderstorm has wreaked havoc inside of me."
… about that Malfoy prat after all.
"So..." he urged her.
"We went to Hogsmeade together, right? The two of us." The way he was talking now, made Haley think he had only been waiting to spill his thoughts to someone. "We were getting along just fine. Properly talking, you know? We weren't arguing or anything. It – I don't know – it was all going well – I really thought she-" He broke off, frowning. "So, we walked around for a bit and then around noon I got hungry and said we should find a place to eat or something. Hermione agreed. And… you know, we were just walking past that café that Puddifoot's…"
"Okay," she agreed with a sigh, silently hoping it wouldn't ever come to this.
"The curse." Draco spat. "Against true evil."
… Right. This was the perfect chance. What had she said again? She should hold his hand? Just as Malfoy was removing his hand from her face, Haley caught it in mid-air and almost slammed it against the table. Her sudden movement caused him to jerk backwards in surprise.
"It wasn't meant to be flattering," she informed him.
Luckily she didn't have to walk all that far. There was a corner at the end of the hall. She only had to turn that corner, walk down another hall and then she would reach the library. If she walked fast she would be back in the Great Hall in less than five minutes.
"But I thought-"
"I thought I told you to return to your tower at once." Although the man's voice was quiet, it was as cutting as a cold winter breeze. It was clear that he was not in the mood to argue.
An eery silence followed these ominous words.
"Can I have my note back now?" She asked trying to make her voice sound as innocent as possible.
"Um… what?" I need a moment to switch from the green streaks incident to the owl – turned little girl.
"Go now," Ron said, nodding at the door behind him. There wasn't anything left to do or say, so she gave a nod and walked toward the door.
He had his back to her, when he finally stopped examining his wand and slowly raised it, aiming at the door. Then he aimed it at the bed. Then at the window behind Haley.
As Haley almost ran around the corner she didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. If there had been a student leaning against the wall, she would have run past without taking notice of them. She would have run past if that person hadn't been clearing their throat importantly. Even then, she wouldn't have looked back.
"It's true," Malfoy admitted, "Lately… I haven't really done a lot to make you trust me but… don't you remember last year?"
It couldn't be.
"I know that. What I meant is I don't remember you actually asking me to go or anything."
Ron grinned at her, obviously believing her story. She grinned back in relief. Then Ron took a closer look at the package.
Then Haley realised another blatantly obvious thing. "Malfoy has it."
There wasn't much for her to do except for cleaning and attempting to turn the house into something that was sort of inhabitable. Today they were cleaning out the salon on the first floor. It was tedious work that took almost all morning and when it was time for a lunch break everyone was gladly munching on Mrs Weasley's delicious sandwiches. Everyone except for Haley Potter and Sirius Black who were standing in front of a huge tapestry.
. He was trying to send her a message. Through that book. And now Hermione had noticed, too! Why hadn't she noticed the book sooner?
was? Somehow?
Haley shook her head. "No, it's not his fault, it's me. It's me who… who…"
"Uh – it's just," Haley started, rubbing a hand over her face, "Ever since I started detention with Umbridge – or no wait – since the second day of detention it felt like someone was watching me.
"I knew it." Professor Snape mumbled quietly.
"Fine," Haley spat, getting up from the table, "I might as well start packing then. In case I don't survive the rest of the term, don't blame
Potter stared at him incredulously. Nevertheless, she seemed strangely determined. "Great," she said with a sarcastic undertone, "You want to talk about the weather, then?"
He'd been ready to fight. But what was he supposed to fight for now?
They'd never hugged before. Not like this. Not when it didn't involve kissing. Somehow it seemed more intimate. Meaningful. Like something that belonged into a dream…
The moment, she arrived in the owlery, she realised that she didn't even bring a quill or something to write on. How intelligent of her. But fortunately, it didn't take her long to spot a lost pen in one of the corners, almost hidden by old feathers and dust. Seemed like someone had forgotten it. She picked it up, trying not to wonder where the dark stains stemmed from and scanned the place for a piece of paper. There was none. Her eyes wandered to the book in her hand. She could rip out one of the pages or… Beneath the letter was another piece of paper. There were strange symbols all over it but the backside was blank. It didn't seem like someone would miss it. She started to fill the blank page with sentences that reflected how furious and betrayed she felt.
Haley stared at him in disbelief
"Why didn't he just give it back?" Asked Simon as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
How nice would it be to have one of those soft and cuddly armchairs from the Gryffindor common room right here. As soon as I think it an armchair appears in front of me! This dream thing is awesome!
"Um..." Haley didn't really know what to say. But it was okay because Hermione had enough to say for the both of them.
"I suppose," she replied, sitting up straighter. She still remembered the joyful expression on Cedric's face, right before they touched the portkey. She had to do it for him. People deserved to know the truth about his death. Haley nodded once to encourage herself. Hermione squeezed her arm.
DRACO
"I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?" The witch interrupted him. "In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these escape."
Over Christmas, when she had opened her heart to him, it had been evident that she cared about that boy. So, it was better for her to get over this nonsense before her feelings got any deeper. What did she even see in that bastard? It was a mystery to him. Just as it had been with Lily and Snivelus. How could she have been friends with someone who was so busy with worshipping dark magic that he couldn't even be bothered to wash his hair? But Lily had seen the light in the end. And so would her daughter.
It was like all of her senses were filled with him. She honestly couldn't say for how long they had been kissing. Or when they had relocated their snogging session to the floor. At some point Haley opened her eyes and the boy was just there, kneeling close to her and staring at her. His fingers were gently cupping her face and he kept kissing her lips as if they had become his sole focus of existing. Surely, they had to be bruised by now. With every peck his kisses grew softer, sweeter. Less feverish. As his thumb stroked over her cheek soothingly, his lips just lingered there, softly brushing against her own.
I want to ask… I want to know about her mistakes. But the sad crease of her left brow makes me hesitate. I wonder if those mistakes are related to dad. But then why would she be sad about that still? Could they be related to someone else? But who would that be? I'm not sure I want to know.
He laughed at that, pulling her hand inside his coat pocket and making her walk closer to him.
"Hm?" She hadn't expected something that
That was too much. "But she's the one who turned away from us first! She's the one who acts like a completely different person!"
"I know. Just talk to her. I'm sure she'll understand. If you like her so much she has to be somewhat kind at the least, am I wrong?"
Haley stumbled forward, dropping to her knees in front of the wall, that opened up into the night sky like a glassless window. She let her head sink onto it, cushioned somewhat by her arms.
"Um, actually it's not from a bird," Haley explained, "It...belonged to a hippogriff." To be exact it was one of Buckbeak's feathers. A present from Sirius.
"Are you mad at me now?" Luna asked, more curious than anything.
"I made her sad." He says after a while.
beneath it.
She didn't know what to say. Should she say anything to begin with? Now that she found him she started to wonder if maybe she shouldn't have come. He probably didn't even want to
He shook it off. It was much too early to have these kinds of thoughts! Or was it?
"Yes," he whispered absently, reaching for a long strand of red hair and freeing it from one of the buttons on her jacket it had caught on.
"Here," he said, holding the mirror up right in front of her face. Haley reached for it reflexively and took a look at her reflection. She looked exactly the way she always did. Which was weird because she had done her hair up in a bun this morning. But now it was all over her face like she'd walked out of a hurricane.
"The Malfoys have always been exceptionally good actors. Actually, this can be said about all the pureblood families. Well, most of them. What I mean to say is… There's a reason why the Malfoys are still walking around unpunished even though Lucius Malfoy has been one of Voldemort's most loyal followers. He knows what to say to make people
Draco cursed his fair complexion as he felt heat rush to his face. Was she implying what he thought she was? But the girl always seemed so innocent, almost childishly so.
"Hello Haley," the blonde greeted her cheerfully.
"But… Haley," Hermione said slowly, almost as if she was talking to a small child that was especially slow to understand. "Haven't you seen… what can happen when you take your dreams too seriously?"
Had Malfoy really looked at her like that? Haley knew this wasn't the moment to think about that but the way George described it it sounded like Malfoy was madly in love with her. The thought made a familiar fluttery feeling rise up in her stomach.
Again she shook her head, feeling her eyes start to burn. "No," she breathed.
Haley grinned. It looked incredibly silly. But it was a thousand times better than his lifeless eyes from yesterday.
The article was located somewhere in the middle of the magazine, between hair styling tips and rules about what not to do on the first date. It was a tiny article that hardly justified an announcement on the front page. Draco glanced around left and right, making sure there was no student lurking behind one of the numerous bookshelves. He didn't want anyone to catch him reading
She sniffed, feeling the tears start to pool in her eyes. Merlin, she hated crying. Her friend made a gesture as if he wanted to touch her arm but stopped himself in the last second. He gazed away, a trace of something akin to sympathy or perhaps regret in his features.
Haley snorted at that. She finally looked up at him, laughing.
"Ah, no. It's blond I think."
"What are you doing here?" She whispered in a choked voice.
Quickly Haley hid her hand behind her back. She didn't want him to see it. She didn't want anyone to see it. But… he'd already seen it, hadn't he? His hands were balled to fists and he made a sound that sounded like a mix between a sigh and a … growl?
"What? I could never have anything in common with a prat like–"
Weird. There's nobody in the hall! The door closes again but something about the door attracts my attention. It's the handle. The handle looks different from what it normally looks like.
Haley turned to the sky again, her pain-filled eyes releasing him. "You don't have to say anything. It's not like it would make a difference." She shook her head. "You don't know how it feels… Nobody does." She pulled up her legs and hugged them to her chest.
song Malfoy had played for her in his dream. Maybe this was the answer. If she really managed to get to him in his dreams, then… Then what? Then everything would magically work out? She wasn't naive enough to believe that. But she had to try. If this was going to be her final chance, she at least needed to take it. That's what a true Gryffindor would do anyway.
, she thought angrily.
Haley didn't feel like wasting her breath on an answer to
"When? Today? Yesterday?"
When they were about to enter the Great Hall, she remembered she was supposed to meet up with Draco for lunch. He'd said he was going to wait for her at the tree house.
Hedwig ignores me. I think I like her much more as an owl. She opens the door, causing the little bell above it to chime and pulls me into Simon's dream.
"Professor Snape?"
"It's not poisoned, I swear," Malfoy informed her, chuckling.
Something clicked on her friend's face. She tensed, narrowing her eyes slightly.
He frowned, as if to think about it. Then he shook his head. "No. I feel… weird, though."
"You're jealous of him." She blurted.
"That's because – because he is surely terribly busy at the moment! And – and it doesn't matter much anyway – hey, look, isn't that the place we were looking for?"
The boy sighed and carefully stepped over the root toward the tree with the face. He leaned in close and whispered something she couldn't hear. Then, all of a sudden the vines came loose around her limbs.
"You know," Malfoy said slowly, "about that massage you promised me last time..."
The girl felt herself nod against his chest, where the alluring scent of him was even more intense. "I'll try." She said quietly, wondering if that was something she could actually do. She could try either way.
I don't know where these last two questions have come from. Honestly. I shove these confusing thoughts to the back of my mind and instead resolve to play
"So, did you find anything?"
The intensity in his eyes nearly takes my breath away. Maybe that's why I'm not shrugging his hand off mine.
He seemed a little confused. Or perhaps he was
He grinned. "You could say it like this." His eyes were shining. They looked like tiny fragments of stars. "It was a nice… distraction, I guess. The kissing especially." He added with a wink. "But that's not all." He let go of her face and picked up her hand instead, lifting it to his mouth and kissing her knuckles tenderly. It killed her a little bit. "You being there… believing in me… fighting for me… not letting me give up… No one has ever done that before. I think you saved me in a way. Even if I hadn't gotten my magic back."
It was then that Haley realised something.
"Stay here," she instructed and ran after the noise in true Gryffindor fashion.
"That's a silly game," he drawls arrogantly.
"That I am... not messing with you. That I have been... telling the truth."
"There really is no need," Luna said chuckling. "It's just a few lemons."
"What?" She still couldn't believe it. "But why? What gave you that idea?" And why was he that protective of her?
Mum gently takes my hand in hers, stopping me from hurting myself further. The fun thing is, I didn't even feel anything. The pain in my chest, tearing at my heart is so much more intense.
It's a sight that warms my heart. I wonder if he believes it now. That this is a dream. I don't want to tell him. Not when he looks that happy.
"It's not… based on a lie," she argued. "And I'm going to tell him. When… the moment's right."
DRACO
She pulled the covers back up around herself and tried to calm her heart. She didn't dare close her eyes, fearing the remnants of the dream would come back to haunt her. After a while, she felt calmer and tried to fall asleep again.
"Sh," she shushed him, pressing two fingers against his quivering lips. They were warm and soft against her skin just as they had felt on her lips yesterday… "Everyone makes mistakes. But perhaps… you would like to make it up to me?" She didn't even know what it was that she was suggesting.
The girl's eyes widened and she tilted her head to the side curiously. Then she chuckled softly. "Veelas are magical creatures," she said like that explained anything. Before he could ask her what that was supposed to mean, she sent him a mysterious little smile and continued walking toward the castle. To be frank, Ron didn't know what any of this meant. But he had the feeling that some of the disappointments that had been weighing him down were slowly beginning to disappear.
If there was only a sign… he'd change his mind and–
It was the second week at the Burrow and Hermione and her had just won one of their quidditch games against Ginny and Ron. It was late afternoon and they were lounging in the garden around a huge campfire. Mrs Weasley who'd suggested they eat outside because the weather was actually pleasant for a change, sat at the table with Fleur and Bill close by and prepared some strawberries and other fruits for dessert.
"I didn't know he offered extra lessons." Luna replied.
"What would happen otherwise?"
… No… She tried to ignore that voice, chase it away, silence it…Then there was another voice. A boy's voice.
"What? Why would she do that?"
She couldn't even begin to think up a clever reply to that because her vision was filled with nothing but his grey eyes. The emotion in them was so intense that for a second she thought he was going to attack her. But to her surprise the attack turned out to be incredibly soft. It came in the form of a kiss.
"Then this must be… " I begin to say but I'm stunned into silence by the sight that is in front of me.
Haley froze. She hadn't even heard the door opening. Without wanting to, she turned her head, taking as much time as she could before she would have to face him.
Haley shook her head. "No, I'm not," she insisted, "How did you even know about this?"
"I'm going to tell him that everything's fine. He's worrying enough as it is." She didn't want him to do anything rash. There was no need for it. Unless Snape had told Dumbledore…
"I – Haley – what…?" He sputtered, not quite following her. "You're back already? I thought there was an emergency at home–"
The ball bounced back and Simon easily caught it with one hand. "That's for bullying my sister!" He declared, sticking out his tongue.
"Oh, don't tell me you haven't noticed the way he watches her with those dreamy eyes whenever she tells one of her insane stories? It's
Haley raised her eyebrows in an unimpressed way. Sirius stared a her, sternly, crossing his arms to make his point.
Haley held her breath, as she slowly soundlessly tip-toed over to the door. Her heart started beating faster. Maybe he was really in there…
What would Haley have done if she'd noticed him? Glare? Yell? Cry some more?
late it is but – but – they'll know I lied – and – and what do I tell them?"
"Those are the options?"
"Wait, where are you-?"
“And still you’re here,” he said with an amused grin. And still she was here. With a sigh, the girl took a seat beside him, letting her feet dangle above the castle grounds. The empty feeling in her stomach made her already regret ditching lunch.
"Hm. Maybe." She commented. "Are you doing this, so Professor Snape won't tell anyone about you and Haley?"
"What?" His eyes widened in surprise.
He frowned, opening his mouth to argue. Then he looked around the big dark Charms class room sceptically. He wasn't afraid of the dark, was he?
. Now, that I think about it, I really should have thought of this sooner. Maybe it's too obvious? I don't really know how to play the chorus, so I imagine the strings to play the notes that would be right, while keeping up at least the correct rhythm. I'm amazed when it actually works.
It was strange. She was starting to get used to spending her nights like this. But still, she wasn't getting closer to solving her problem. She was only getting closer to dying of sleep deprivation. When it got to the point that even coffee didn't keep her awake for more than a few hours any more, she decided she needed to take a break.
Draco needed a moment to take all of that in. If this was true… Haley had to be devastated. If that was true…
“Leave me alone,” Haley groaned, pressing her eyes tighter together and willing herself to return to her dream.
. The embroidered letter looked different from the rest of the cloth. And there were also a few flowers that seemed like they were a different kind of fabric.
"I mean it," she added quietly. "There are so many undiscovered creatures out there. Just waiting to be found." Her voice had become an excited whisper. "I want to see all of them!"
As always, thank you for reading! Till next time, Feather :)
He raised an eyebrow. "Are you actually asking for permission to stalk me, right now?"
"What?"
"I heard… he was killed by one of the Death Eaters."
Something glistened below his eye. Like a tiny translucent gobstone. Haley wanted to reach out and wipe the tear drop away.
"And… how… how is he?" She asked, feeling even more anxious.
Haley gave it a thought. Apart from the fact that Neville was one of the kindest people she knew, she also remembered the last conversation between them. He had felt so guilty about Draco's current situation that he had broken up with her. Because he had somehow thought staying with her wasn't fair to Draco. Although that wasn't true. Although none of it had been Neville's fault. On the contrary. Draco had been the one who had cursed
"No, I just thought–"
Haley looked up into his face and saw something akin to nervousness. What an unusual sight. But it was also a tiny bit cute.
"Yes. My dad runs it," Luna replied, sounding slightly defensive. "Are you headed for the castle?" She asked, pointing in the general direction of the main building and starting to walk down the path leading to it.
. So much, for her quiet retreat.
He scoffed. "You're not intimidating at all," he told the cat that was much calmer now that he wasn't holding it in a death grip and trying to send it flying any more. It was sitting in his lap its tail flicking back and forth and yellow eyes glaring at him. "I've once fought a hippogriff. That creature was much scarier than you." He smirked, raising a hand, as if to touch the animal. It lifted its furry head to sniff his fingers. Then it meowed and rubbed its face along his hand. It was just like he had written in the letter. He did have a hand for animals, it seemed.
She nodded. "Yes, yes. Now go to bed." She shooed him into her room and then turned around and slid into his.
The snowy owl rolled her eyes but accepted the treat anyway.
"Do I have to choose now?" He asked quietly.
"He'd probably think you were under a spell if nothing else," he scoffed.
"Haley?" Malfoy asks, as he looks confusedly back and forth between me and my doppelgänger. That's when I notice my hair is back to its original colour. Damn. I look like myself again.
I walk through the door and find myself inside a café. My brother sits at one of the tables and eats scones. With lots of butter. I run over to him and attack him with a bone-crushing hug.
Something was clearly wrong here. Why wouldn't he tell her? And what had he been looking at with such intensity just now? He hadn't been looking back at Malfoy, had he? But then, he had no reason to watch the Slytherin, right? It didn't make any sense. None of it.
And George is officially my new favourite character. Hehe.
Peculiar were the fruits hanging between the twigs and leaves. They were red with yellow stripes and shaped like little spirals.
"Don't worry," Luna whispered. "You can just try again. I'm sure Mr Dobby doesn't mind helping us."
She got up and leaped toward the door. "My map! You were the one who took it!"
"There," Ron repeated, pointing toward the suspicious book. Why was he this observant today? What was wrong with him?
Haley bit her lips. "So?" She was probably too eager. There was no way he was going to tell her… But then… he didn't seem all that angry any more. More than anything he seemed dejected and sad.
"Wait! Where are you going?" Draco called but Haley was already running down the hall toward the staircase. It felt only a little bit like running away from her feelings.
," he pointed at Haley, "keep out of trouble."
"So Zabini," Malfoy turns to the other boy. He seems to have forgotten about me. "Who else shall we invite? Besides Fleur Dela-what-do-I-care."
"The way you care about people." She could feel his fingers in her hair, running them through the strands slowly. "Your childishness… your stupid arrogance… the stupid face you make whenever I prank you."
In the right hand corner there was a small sitting area, secluded from the rest of the room by shelves filled with literature on potions.
"For five years… I have... had this picture of you in my mind... That won't magically change over night," Haley heard herself whisper almost soundlessly.
Simon nodded. "I mean… look at him. Same black hair… And he's just as vicious."
she thought
"Maybe you should ask Haley."
"Here."
Haley nodded, stealing herself, when the man raised his wand once more.
"Actually, Haley's the one who-" Hermione began to explain but Haley interrupted her.
." She added that last word with a smirk, causing him to spin around in less than a second.
"No! I'd never–"
help?" She pouted. Not intentionally of course.
"Probably the girl's bathroom on the second floor. Nobody uses it. Ever. Because of that insufferable ghost."
. It seemed to only make her more nervous.
"What are you doing here?" He asked in annoyance. He hadn't even noticed when she'd arrived.
Haley chuckled. "Well, it's not like we can actually walk down the path to Hogsmeade together. Everyone would see us."
She sent her an encouraging smile, before turning and making her way over toward the exit where Ron and Hermione were waiting.
"Hm?"
"Sorry," she mumbled, fumbling for her wand to clean up the sticky mess. But someone – probably Hermione – had already whispered the incantation to make the juice magically disappear.
"Right. Because you were looking for me."
The whiny girl kept babbling on and on about Cedric Diggory and how
Frowning irritably, he raked his hand through his light hair, making it stand up vertically. "Fine, you've had a laugh. Now, tell me something about you."
"You're awake?" Hermione asked, appearing in front of her in no less than a second. Haley nodded.
"It's a
After everything she had had to endure?
Luna Lovegood held the magazine in front of her face sceptically.
," she tested, the first thing that came to her mind.
Simon swallowed forcibly. It looked like a small catastrophe. "But… I'm eating?" He replied in confusion.
As I get closer to the scene I can actually hear what they're saying.
"No!" Ginny exclaimed looking up for the first time, "It's fine… you can stay."
George Weasley reached for something above the girl's headless body and suddenly her friend's face reappeared. Haley's heart started beating again.
He scowled. "So? That doesn't mean you stole it. I'd never let a Gryffindor steal something from me. Maybe I…" He looked away with a sneer. "let you have it."
"It all happened so fast and I seriously never thought – I mean I knew you liked him and you even went to the ball with him. But he told me you were – he – at the ball he said you were with someone else and he just seemed kind of down and – we only talked that night. Really nothing more. You have to believe me! I never meant for this to happen! And I know I should have checked with you first. I should have told you – I… I'm really sorry, Haley. You shouldn't have found out like this..."
To my immense relief it's only mum.
The boy shook his head and crossed his arms in front of his chest. Interesting. Hadn't she heard something crinkle, when his left hand had touched the insides of his pocket? Was he hiding something there?
"Potter, where are you going?" He sounded slightly annoyed. Or impatient maybe. Haley spun around.
, she wondered for a second. Then she remembered the more important matter at hand.
"On Valentine's Day? She planned this?"
Aw. That was almost sweet. She'd wanted to make sure, she didn't skip any meals.
Freedom wasn't a gift. One had to fight for it.
, Haley panicked.
"No. I mean I do like listening to it but… I like… how it can reach people. Connect them." Did that make sense? It was really hard to explain.
"He's staring at you."
Hermione put an arm around her and with Neville in tow they made their way toward the carriages where Ron was already waiting.
"I…" She shook her head, still overwhelmed by the new conflict in her head.
Draco hadn't known that kissing someone could feel like dying. He didn't exactly think much about dying to begin with. But never would he have imagined that death was such a sweet thing.
"Yeah but not – I didn't mean – it can be – I – I can't accept this!" She stammered at a loss for words.
"She's here! I told you, she was in the library!" That was Ron.
"I…" She started, trying to recollect something interesting from his dreams. "I know… your favourite drink."
Ron shook his head, like he was trying to get rid of a thought. "Anyway. How was your trip to Sweden? Did you manage to catch your Snorkack?" He asked curiously. He only sounded a little bit mocking.
"As it seems… Lucius is more or less safe for the moment in Azkaban but-"
"In any case," she whispered. "I think, I've made a huge mistake."
"Isn't that Luna?" Ron asked, obviously having spotted the girl as well, "We can go over and tell her about the meeting!"
He had drawn his wand.
. You didn't even give me a chance." It almost sounded as if it still pained him. "Ultimately, I thought that it was your fault what happened to me."
"Hold on a second," I interrupt him. "You've got a crush on this girl?"
"You know what? Forget it." She hissed, cursing herself for expecting any decency from the boy.
," she said to no one in particular and let go of the button. There was a flash of light, reminiscent of a camera flash and then the umbrella folded itself up. The only thing that was shielding them from the rain now was the tree they were standing underneath.
Had Emily done that? No… the girl was hiding behind the closed door again. Then who…?
Otherwise I'd wake up before I even found Malfoy's door. I turn around and try to trace my steps back. I only took right turns, so it shouldn't be too hard to find my way back.
"Too?"
"I don't have a moustache!" He shudders visibly at the image. I scrawl the word
"You can open it," he grumbled impatiently. "It's not dangerous or toxic or anything." He didn't mean to be this grouchy but he was so anxious to see whether she liked the present.
"There's no reason for that." He argued.
here, looking for McGonnagall. Where was she now? In her common room? But he had no way of checking there. Well, it was better than standing here, twiddling his thumbs. He left the Infirmary and stormed up the stairs toward Gryffindor tower. A handful of students were gathered in front of that Fat Lady's portrait. Haley wasn't among them. If only they talked about something useful. But all they were blabbering about was some party. He was wasting his time. But where else could he look? The Gryffindors started eyeing him suspiciously. He sneered at them. Then started climbing down the stairs…
Ah, there it was. Next thing she knew, she was going to call her paranoid. Or compare her to Moody.
Neville turned back to her at once. "Malfoy? Did he do something to you again?"
thing.
Hello! My dear readers. It's been a while, right? Well, I'll have you know that I'm doing an internship at the moment and it's super time consuming! Some advice: Never do an internship at a theatre if you're not passionate about theatre. And don't do it just before a premiere!
"Draco." Professor Snape acknowledged him with a quick nod. He didn't say anything more. Draco wasn't sure what to say either.
"See what?" Draco asked in annoyance.
eyes that were trying to suck all of the secrets out of his head.
"I'm sure, he doesn't mean it like that," she said sympathetically, her fingers covering Haley's gently. "He's just hurt."
There was some kind of white object resting on her blanket. She found her glasses and lit up her wand. Then she picked up the object and inspected it. It was a feather. One of Hedwig's. But she was nowhere to be found. The window was slightly open though. Could she have been here? Had she come and woken her up on purpose? Had she… somehow known about the dream? But that wasn't possible, was it?
With a grim smile Sirius dipped his quill into the bottle of ink to his right, when a noise interrupted him. Someone was downstairs. But there was no meeting planned for tonight, was there?
"Just…
your friend!" She balled her hands to fists in frustration.
She raised an eyebrow, trying not to grin. "Yeah?"
! Nothing was more important than that. But when a whole group of thestrals arrived, she didn't have any strength left to argue.
Although his whole world had turned orange, Draco could see vague contours of his surroundings. It looked as though Weasley had made a run for it, Pansy following behind, firing hexes at him.
too good for him. "See? Still alive," she informed him with a grin.
remember.
"Fair enough," she whispered. She had her own share of secrets. It was only fair to leave him his. The ones he still had left, anyway.
Would he be able to unlock it with an Alohomora? There was only one way to find out.
"Do you remember our first date?" She asked in return. "When we used your mirror?"
"You know, Simon would be so jealous, if he knew about this."
Mum hums, silently urging me to go on. I love how she's just letting me talk without interrupting me. Usually her judgement comes at the end.
"Knew you couldn't be trusted." Weasley spat.
The two Gryffindors stared each other down for an explosive moment. Neither of them ready to back down first.
Haley put the gobstone into her chest pocket, next to her wand, close to her heart. It calmed her somewhat.
a big deal! A huge deal!
She snorted, slapping his shoulder lightly. "Git." She hissed. But then she looped her arms around his neck, got up on her tip-toes and kissed him in a way she'd never had before. There was passion, yes. But it was less prominent than usual. Less destructive. Instead of smouldering hot and threatening to incinerate everything that stood in its way, it was simmering quietly under the surface now. With each kiss, she was pressing against the boy's lips, she could feel him smile. Instead of gripping her too tightly, his fingers were now stroking across her back softly. Caressing instead of clawing at her. She felt giddy and light. So light. As if she was about to fly away any moment. She was a galaxy. A galaxy of joy.
"Let me go!" Haley hissed. Her arms were pressed to the wall and she was furiously trying to free her wrists from Malfoy's too tight grip.
happy?"
. This was too
Wish you all an amazing start into the new year :)
It didn't hurt too much. The eagle owl was holding out one leg expectantly.
He gasped, releasing her lips momentarily. She used that opportunity to find his neck with her mouth, kissed it and sucked at it until the pale skin turned deliciously red.
"Why did you ask me about this curse? How did you get involved with it? You didn't use it, did you? Or did someone use it on you?" Mum suddenly grabs my hands and then cups my face, angling it from side to side, as if she's looking for something.
now to have a little friendly fun with an old...acquaintance?"
"I was going to obliviate you," he admitted defiantly.
okay! Okay?" He sits up as well, his chin is wobbling slightly. "Is that what you think I should do to Baz? Revealing one of his secrets because he blabbed one of mine? I don't even know anything useful about him!"
"It's right there. Can't you see?" He calls, pointing above us. I glance upwards, following his finger.
week of detention with Umbridge? Don't you see that's just what she wants? She wants you to lose your temper. Make you look like an angry, little child that nobody will take seriously. Can't you see? And you're playing right into her game! Is it really this hard to lay low for once? How can a person be this stupid? Seriously!"
Right. She had put on a pair of jeans. And a hint of mascara that she'd sneaked from Parvati. But surely Ron of all people hadn't noticed that?
"One day, I'll find it," she mumbled almost to herself.
"One, two," he counted, barely giving her any time to prepare himself. Sneaky prat. "Three."
As I play the new guitar solo, Myron observes me suspiciously, like he thinks I'm familiar but can't quite put his finger on who I am. That's promising. When I'm done, the singer still frowns at me but the door opens nevertheless and I walk into another dream, feeling excited and uncertain at the same time.
"It's gone," he whispers frantically. "It's gone, I can't find it. I lost it!"
"We have yet to see if it actually works." Professor Snape replied.
Haley shook her head. "Well… that beard… that's really weird. Don't ever grow a beard, okay?"
"Hey!" She exclaimed, "I'm talking to you. I thought we were over the whole ignoring thing?"
Lovegood didn't seem offended by his barb in the slightest. She only grinned as if she knew something he didn't and replied, "I simply thought, since she's going to come over here anyway-"
Clucking her tongue impatiently, Hermione handed them to her. The world remained dark but at least it was starting to get into focus somewhat.
"So, do you like one of your friends more than the others?" He asked casually.
Black watched him suspiciously. "What now? Finally bored of torturing innocent children?"
"I know that!" Draco said impatiently. "After that I mean. She said she had to go rescue her godfather!"
DRACO
HALEY
"Careful Potter," Malfoy said in an amused tone, picking up the mirror swiftly, "Breaking mirrors is bad luck."
morality
"Right! I was stupid for trying to help you!" She shot back. "I was stupid to think you'd actually want your magic back!" For a second her own outburst surprised her. A few months ago she would never have talked back like that.
How was she this calm? How was she this calm, when Draco felt so restless?
Wasn't that enough? As she looked at him once more, he caught her gaze and smiled gently.
"He smiled at me," she continued with a glint in her eyes, "He has a really cute smile. There is a dimple on his right cheek." Hermione whispered fondly. Haley smiled at her friend. She got the feeling Hermione had been wanting to share those memories with her for some time.
"Neville, what…?" She shook her head in confusion. "What's going on?"
The man shook his head.
don't want to see." She could go on like this forever. Teasing, touching, kissing in an endless loop of bliss. If only there wasn't Hermione's voice in her head, telling her she'd fail all her classes if she didn't return to the castle now.
Haley whirled to the boy. "What? How'd you know?"
"Who is that one for?" He wanted to know, as the girl poured the brown liquid into the mould.
"Maybe he did." Lily chimed in. She had been silent the whole time. Contemplating. "Maybe there simply was no way."
One look at the fading colours tells me that my time is up. He is about to wake up.
The first thing I see is an explosion of colours. Green mostly. My door looks like a massive painting. But there are no actual shapes recognizable. It's just an abstract splutter of different colours that run into one another. The painting itself is mostly concealed by thick tendrils that wind their way all around the picture. I can spot thorns all over them. It almost seems like the tendrils are embracing the painting in a protective way, as if they're keeping everything that is potentially harmful away. But at the same time it's impossible to see the whole painting like this.
Leave me your thoughts?
"Are you going to tell us about your plan now?" Hermione asked. She was sitting opposite Haley and had quietly listened.
"Tell him, I'll wait by the willow."
"Ahhhh!" Still screaming.
"So you're saying," Draco urged in frustration. Why couldn't she speak in certain terms? He had to fight the urge to shake her until the answer tumbled out of her.
Draco read the contents of the letter again and again.
"It might," she offered thoughtfully. "Or it might not. I can't predict the future with complete accuracy."
"Great! Now that we've established what chocolate tastes like let's move on to our main topic. I'm sure you're already bursting with curiosity."
She was walking away from him again. He hated watching her go. So, he decided he wouldn't. Not this time. With no more than three steps he had reached the girl and stopped in front of her.
"No, no, no," she muttered, waving her hands in front of her uselessly. "Merlin, what should I…?" She felt so stupid. And terribly helpless. "Open your eyes." She urged.
Hermione doubted that the Slytherin had actually
But wait. Had he just referred to Luna Lovegood as a
Haley was just about to follow him, when she was reminded of the boy that still had his arm around her shoulders.
"So what did Malfoy want?" Hermione asked, the moment Haley stepped into the common room. Were those… sandwiches on the table? In a matter of seconds she had thrown herself onto the couch next to Ron, who seemed to be working on an assignment.
I look around the corridor. But nobody's there beside me.
He rolled his eyes. "Besides, you don't have to know everything about someone to be able to feel something."
"Here, would you take those to mum and Baz? For the icing?" Simon tells me, while handing me a baking tray full of biscuits shaped like snitches. Reflexively, I take the tray and look around, searching for the two in question. At the other end of the room I spot a dark-haired boy sitting at our kitchen table and decorating cookies.
What was wrong? (Beside the obvious anyway.)
"Did you just pinch my arm?" He asked the girl in front of him in puzzlement.
"Me?"
"What's wrong?" She asked in confusion. Why was he reacting like that?
He closed his eyes. As if he thought reopening them would solve all their problems. "Still… I should be with you… I
"Um – no. Must have seen it somewhere else," he replied hastily. Amazing. That strategy always worked.
Haley blinked, trying to read the rest of the information on the page. But she could barely keep her eyes open. It was a good thing that she was sitting down. Otherwise she might have collapsed on the spot. For a moment she let her head sink onto her arms that were resting on the table. In front of her was her prank book and as it seemed she was the only person in the library. Beside Madame Pince anyway.
Before she could make up her mind though her wand landed on the ground, rolling slowly out of her reach. Damn. Malfoy had opened his eyes and was holding her now empty hand in a tight grip.
"Is that you're new thing now? Pulling faces?" Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
He sounded positively defeated as he said that. Haley realised with a start that she didn't like the tone of his voice at all. She wanted to contradict him, to assure him that it wasn't true. That she did trust him. But she also didn't want to lie to him.
All at once her sense for adventure kicked in. She would certainly not try that out now but… she filed away the information for later. She turned toward Malfoy, unsure what was supposed to happen now. His eyes were already trained on her. Had he been watching her the whole time? The moment seemed fragile. Intimate.
"Really?" Emily asked, her voice full of hope. She looked as if she was close to tears.
He gave a shrug. "It's fine. I never got why we need to know how to turn buttons into beetles anyway."
but… old habits die hard, I guess."
Haley laughed. Not out of amusement but more over the sheer absurdity of the situation.
Haley pouted. Defence Against the Dark Arts was her best subject!
Haley sighed, wondering how on earth she'd get him to believe her. Then she reached into her hair and pulled off her hair tie. "Here." She said, rolling it over his wrist. "You can walk into my dreams with it. Figure out if I'm lying or not." It was like giving him permission into her mind. Into her subconscious. To sift through her deepest secrets. Now, she was the one feeling vulnerable.
"No!" Haley protested too quickly. "I mean. Let's wait one more day. If he isn't back by tomorrow I'll go tell Madame Pomfrey."
Ginny had the decency to look at least a bit ashamed.
But after a second I quickly shake off the feeling. This is Malfoy. Who has been tormenting and harassing me and other students for years. If anyone deserves a taste of humiliation than it's certainly him. Besides, this is only a dream, right? He won't even remember most of it, tomorrow.
"I – What do you mean? I don't understand-"
Madame Pomfrey poured him another spoonful. "Well, there are different kinds of magic in the world, aren't there?" The woman said kindly, glancing at their clasped hands. So, she did know about his magic.
"To be expected?" Haley hissed, placing a soft pillow behind Draco's head and protectively wrapping an arm around him. "How about a small heads up next time? When will he wake up?"
Narrowing his eyes slightly, he took it from Snape's hand in order to get a closer look at it.
. He bit his lips, not wanting the words to slip out accidentally. "So, stop worrying all right?" He raised his hand to her face and brushed his fingers over the shadows under her eyes briefly. She didn't answer. But she also didn't slap away his hand, which he counted as a success.
"Well, you know…
Draco was already restlessly twirling his own between his fingers.
"I'm saying that observant people would surely notice it, if they had a reason for being suspicious and would be actively looking for it. I don't think you've been found out though. Not yet. In fact I think Haley Potter is convinced that you actually despise her."
"I'll break his bloody bones. I-" He got up, straightening his shoulders as if he was getting ready for a fight.
it!" He emphasizes. "I'll never get it back. Don't you understand? He took it from me. He's taken
Sirius stopped, turning around to face her. "No, you're not. That's m–"
"Then we're both lucky you're not me." He replied lightly.
Hang in there!
"Never!" Haley growled, shoving away the man's hands that had started to search her robe pockets. "Neville, catch it!"
Before I can see anything more than two green dots and something reddish, Malfoy steps in front of his work, shielding it from me. He grins secretively, and gestures for me to return to my own creations. I roll my eyes. Is he trying to paint me? That gives me an idea…
"Hey!" Haley exclaimed, reaching for the note but her godfather was holding it out of her reach and reading hastily.
"How is it not cheating when that sodding Firebolt is twice as fast as any regular broom?" He scowled. He had forgotten how mad he got whenever they lost a match against Gryffindor. Potter rolled her eyes. "Fine. Let's switch brooms. I could take you on with a Cleansweep Seven." Draco should have been offended but that confident look and the arrogant tone of her voice did
She tried to remove his hands from her stomach but he was holding her so tightly that it was useless.
A familiar beautiful brown owl was sailing over toward her, landing next to her still empty plate.
Huh? He had opened his eyes again and it seemed that had been enough time to make the tables disappear. Potter and the Hufflepuff were making their way back toward the castle it seemed.
"No!" I almost yell. I'd probably be able to pull it off, since I know his face so well. But… I'd rather not use his appearance for this.

. But that made sense, since she hadn't actually
my sister – no that he likes
He shakes his head. "No. Brooms are like wands, he said. They are like channels or something? To direct your magic? Anyway, you can't ride a broom or use a wand if you're not a wizard." He finishes his explanation.
"Neville." Haley pressed, kneeling down beside him. "You can tell me," she urged him, willing the boy to at least look at her.
It was still warm outside. Everywhere the beginnings of summer where noticeable.
"Approval?" Haley asked.
"I..." The truth was she didn't know. And she didn't want to lie either. "That's… what I'm trying to figure out," she admitted quietly.
"But you know…" Malfoy's eyes flick to the side in a way that seems almost shy. "She gave me a present today. A blueberry cupcake." He says it like it's a secret and nervously chews his lips. "I think she might like me," he whispers and his whole face starts to glow with a childlike happiness that makes me think of my little brother. It's adora–
There was so much uncertainty and conflict in Haley's eyes. Honestly, that admission made so much sense – from a Gryffindor perspective. But what was much more important was that her words warmed him, melting away the last remnants of uncertainty and hurt that had settled in his chest.
"He knew your secret," Haley guessed. "You were afraid he'd tell everyone."
Okay, this it. 11k words. I don't even know what to say. No, actually I have a lot to say. First of all, I want to thank everyone who went on this journey with me and encouraged me to keep writing. I honestly didn't think this would get so long. But here we are, 180 k words later.
It had indeed been a good idea. She had to admit that. She snatched the mirror from the boy's hands and took another look at herself. Maybe she should try different glasses? Or was it possible to get rid of them completely? The girl in the mirror looked back at Haley without glasses. It was a strange sight. And it was even stranger that she was able to see her reflection clearly. If she could make her glasses disappear, perhaps it was also possible to…
at him. She turned around stumbling over tables and benches until she reached the portrait.
"Then how…?" He didn't understand. Was she lying to him?
"I know… you're… you're having a hard time at the moment." Draco continued. "But I really need to talk to you. It's important."
It was a good thing it was already Friday, so maybe she could catch up on some sleep over the weekend. If only to get her friends to stop asking whether she was okay all the time.
," he asked mockingly, just to see how the elf would react.
"I may be repeating myself, but I don't like your jokes," he grumbled.
Ginny glared back defiantly. Nobody dared get between the two siblings.
"Just answer the question, Haley!" He interrupted, his grip on her fingers becoming uncomfortably tight. "If it had been me, would you have betrayed me, too?"
The boy shook his head and released her hair, his fingers finding her cheek instead. "Now, I'd like to get a taste of that treacle muffin, you wouldn't share with me." And with that he closed the remaining distance between them and kissed her.
"He – I mean, I – I went into his dream… I… I wanted to find out why… why he always picks on me. Or at least… find a way to stop him." And I've accomplished none of that. How disappointing.
Haley was saved from answering these questions by Angelina Johnson who appeared behind her and urged her to finish up because she wanted to start practising.
"No." Haley shook her head and frowned sceptically. That couldn't be right. Her mum would have told her if the dreaming thing was that dangerous.
The Slytherin slid down from the table and took a step toward her until he was the one standing in front of her.
He frowned. Should he have approached her more gently? "It's me, what are you tal-?"
Hermione's hazel eyes were flitting back and forth between the gobstone bracelet and Haley in suspicion.
Haley froze. Since when did Crookshanks' fur feel this smooth? Just like… human skin.
He shrugged, looking away. "I found out by accident." Contemplatively he tilted his head to the side. "Though… maybe it wasn't an accident after all. I found it… a few nights after I realized my magic was really… g-gone. I must have wandered across the grounds aimlessly for hours, asking someone – anyone for help." His voice sounded so so far away. "Until finally someone answered. And the tree house appeared. Like a safe haven waiting for anyone who's desperate enough."
"She was talking to
"Yeti wool?" Ron echoed.
"That's all right. You can go and join Loony Lovegood then."
"No, I'm going to look for it myself," she said. It wasn't just any quill. It had been a present from Sirius so she was definitely not going to risk losing it.
When he caught her watching him, he nodded his head toward the castle. "I thought there was an important class you don't want to miss?"
"Potter." He said, as she and her friends passed him. "A word?" He asked in a neutral tone, lifting a questioning eyebrow.
Unsurprisingly, she was the only one in the owlery. In record time, Haley penned a short urgent letter, found Hedwig and sent her off to Godric's Hollow. If there was anyone who could help her with this, it was her mum.
"Later!" She called back, realizing too late that she'd forgotten to pick up her books. Well, Hermione was going to take them back for her for sure.
"Right." If he remembered correctly her father was the chief editor of
"Don't tell me you… you've got a crush on him?" She asked hesitantly.
wanted to take revenge. His own father had stood there and laughed while his girlfriend had been tortured. For all he knew. The mere knowledge was practically unbearable. Could it really be true? Well, at leat he hadn't been the one doing the torturing.
"What did you do to my girlfriend?" He asked with a snort, while taking the mirror back.
"I'll count to three." Malfoy said, mounting his Nimbus 2001. Haley quickly straddled her Firebolt, as the Slytherin fetched something shiny from his pocket. A snitch.
"Awesome," Ron beamed, happily scooping up a spoonful of peas. When Haley turned to Hermione she noticed her friend's brows were furrowed like she was deep in thought. Her gaze was fixed on the card, lying next to Ginny's glass. Then she looked up at her, meeting her eyes. Unspoken questions were swirling behind her brown orbs. But with a shock Haley realised that it was almost too easy to guess what made Hermione this suspicious.
"Dobby," he called, wondering why calling him like this still worked even though he technically wasn't his master any more. Maybe it worked for all Hogwarts students? Or perhaps it was because he used to be Draco's house elf? Well, it didn't really matter.
"Okay, okay. I get it. Just relax, alright?" She took his other hand as well and pulled lightly, making him step a little closer. "It'll be fine, you'll see. My mum is easy to charm. She even likes the neighbour kid that always steals our greengages in summer."
"Uh..." Damn, I'm really bad with words today. Almost as bad as my idiot brother. That's when I get the most amazing idea. "You probably know my sister," I say, rubbing the back of my neck, and attempting to make my voice sound deeper.
"It's not for m-" He bit his lips, before he could say too much. It wasn't usual for him. This lack of control.
He shakes his head. "It's just – you're really good at this. Where did you learn it?"
Ah, there they were. Now, all he had to do was find a convenient shelf where he could see and hear them. Or at least hear them.
I blink at him in surprise. It's Malfoy. But he looks so young. About ten I would guess.
"You don't know my dad." I chuckle, raising my head to look at him. "If I had not become a Gryffindor or even worse if I had been put into
Haley listened intently. This sounded vaguely familiar.
"Look, I shouldn't take it out on you. I'm sorry, it's just–" She stopped, glaring at the two figures in the distance who seemed to be holding hands for some reason.
"You broke your word. That wasn't a real kiss," he finally says with a glare.
They passed a few students on the staircase, all of whom were sending them curious glances. But when she bestowed her best threatening death glare on them, they hastily hurried away. She had copied that glare from her mum.
She removed her head from his chest and looked into his grey eyes. "I…" she started to say, trying to put her feelings into words. Wondering if he was feeling this, too.
That seemed… a bit anticlimactic.
But he wasn't leaving. Instead he was walking toward the bowl, that was lying in the middle of the hall. With his back to her, he knelt down in front of it and took something out of his robe pocket.
"I wasn't – I…" Haley ran a hand over her face, clawing at her hair. "I – you're not being fair! I did it because… I told you why! But I'm not doing it any more, okay? I stopped because I want to give this a chance!"
"What?" His covers drop back to the bed. My eyes are magically drawn to his hair that's sticking up in every direction imaginable.
"Really? You're going to sit with us?" Denis squeaked eagerly. He looked like he was going to explode out of joy.
. What was she supposed to make of all this?
Hermione had walked halfway into the compartment, effectively blocking Ron's vision.
"What?" She stared at him in surprise, feeling oddly exposed. After all, he'd seen…
. I try to stifle a laugh but I can't manage it. Malfoy turns his head toward me, his eyes are like two moons and they're full of suspicion.
"You promised to come back to me!" He called angrily. "You wanted to tell me something after the exams, remember? You promised to build a world for me! Does all of that mean nothing to you?"
"Hermione," Ron said cautiously as if to remind her of her words.
So… not in the kitchens… But somewhere else…
He didn't want to let her go. Something terrible was going to happen if he did. He could feel it.
Haley got up as well, a sudden anger filling her, stirred by the fact that he was treating her like a child. "I said it's not a joke. I'm serious!"
“What?” I sigh in annoyance. “Am I going to die tomorrow?” I’ve already been through this with Trelawney.
"Wait. Are you saying that the mu – muggleborn knows we're on a date?"
"What were you even doing in the hospital wing?" Haley asked, trying to subtly change the topic.
and second"
I close my eyes, imagining my broomstick in my hand and open them again. The merits of dreaming. On my broom, I follow the two figures and watch them from above. The girl has reached the beginning of the woods now.
"What happened yesterday? What did Snape say to you? Does he know? Is he going to tell anyone? Has he already told anyone? What did he say?" She was shooting the questions at him like spells.
"Tom Riddle?" Haley asked. She couldn't quite place the name, although she felt like she'd heard it somewhere before.
resting! And I'm gonna be on the train most of the day anyway."
"Come on, if I don't get any sandwiches because of you I think I'll have to kill someone."
A dull
me to hex him?"
"Why do you think I called you here tonight?" His voice was calm. Patient. But his gaze was focused on something on the shelf in front of him. He wasn't even looking at Draco.
"Could you hold this for a moment?" She asked, holding out two thick books for Haley.
"Why?" She asked after a quiet moment.
The boy opened his mouth but instead of speaking, he closed it again. Then he reached out a hand toward her. A silent invitation. Haley was surprised how easy it was to take it. He gave her hand a slight pull, making her step closer.
"Seriously though," she whispered, "Are you happy?"
"Let's go again… on the count of three." No! She wasn't ready! "One – two – three –
"Thank you for trusting me," she said, reaching for Haley's hand and squeezing her fingers gently.
"Well, we're heading to the library, of course. We can't come up with a plan when Hermione's right there and Malfoy watching from across the hall."
Oh, this sounded amazing. This sounded-
(See the end of the chapter for
Haley had to be strong for both of them. So, she made an effort to smile and make it look encouraging.
"And you must be Draco, then?" Lily asked, turning to the nervous boy. "It's a pleasure to meet you." There was nothing but warmth in her voice. It seemed to settle Draco's nerves somewhat.
"Mum said to bring you some cake." He explained, slowly approaching the sitting area. He eyed the table questioningly, as if he wondered, whether his company was wanted or not.
"Done?" Draco asked, when she lowered the mirror.
Draco's eyes widened until they were almost as big as the girl's offending blue orbs.
She cleared her throat and looked at her hands that were still holding onto his arms.
It sounded just like Hermione and Ron were arguing about something again.
Malfoy scoffed, rolling his eyes. "I'm not a bloody invalid, Potter." He got up in one swift move and stood there in triumph for a split second. Then his legs betrayed him, sending him tumbling to the ground. If Haley hadn't jumped to her feet and caught him in time, that was.
"I..." she shook her head. As much as she wanted to she couldn't tell Hermione about the thing that kept her thoughts occupied. She had gone on a date with Draco Malfoy! She had kissed him! Well, technically
"I still don't see how that makes it a time machine though," the Gryffindor dead-panned.
"No tricks this time," I mutter as I close my eyes once more. It takes a bit longer before she tells me to open my eyes again. When she finally does I'm in for a surprise.
Haley shook her head dejectedly. If Hermione only knew how ironic this was.
"Not by centaurs. I find dragons much more effective." He replied dryly. Snarky little git.
"Ah, no, that's for our other guest." Lily explained, pushing the plate out of Simon's reach as a precaution.
There was more than wariness in his eyes when he turned his head to look at her again. "How would you know?"
"These? Oh, they are just gloves," the blonde replied.
It had been more than slightly awkward. But at least she had got it over with. And from the looks of it Justin didn't seem to be bitter about it at all. If he was he didn't show it.
"Oh, please call me Lily, dear. Mrs Potter makes me feel like an old lady." Lily replied, seeming slightly flustered by his antics. "I've heard a lot about you," She told him, before turning to her daughter. "But how come you never told me, he was such a charmer? Whenever you mentioned him I kept imagining some brute who threw around ice cream all day."
"His feelings?" Ron echoed in confusion.
"Let's try them later in the common room, yeah?" She suggested, already looking forward to it.
With drooping eyes Haley trudged down the hall. Was that a bench to her right? She didn't know if she'd be able to make it all the way up to the tower. But after a little break… she'd surely be able to go on.
"I – I wasn't – Sirius-" I turn to my godfather for help but the seat that I could swear he'd sat in just a moment ago is empty.
Had Malfoy noticed something? No. He was too busy rubbing his elbow in annoyance.
"Well… he's a Slytherin… he's a Malfoy. Evil pureblood and all that."
Haley laughed. "You're such a goof."
"It's harder than it looks," she says, "try to remember the taste."
, her mum had said.
"Thank you, Neville." Haley smiled back, hoping he wasn't going to tell the others the two of them were alone inside the boys dormitory. She didn't need those kind of rumours on top of everything.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Beryll!" She exclaimed happily. It was her family's owl. Beryll held out his leg that had a letter tied to it and hooted softly. She gently stroked the owl's feathers before untying the letter.
"He shouldn't have become one of them, then." She didn't know what else to say. Was too scared to look at the boy directly, fearing the expression on his face. What could she say to make it better? How could she bridge the chasm that was separating their two worlds from one another?
Draco was sure he was slowly going insane. How else could it be explained that he was telling his deepest secrets to a stranger? Maybe it was the fact, that considering the girl's reputation it was unlikely anyone would believe her, should she ever tell someone about this. But perhaps it was also because he had carried this secret with him for such a long time that it felt liberating to finally be able to talk to someone about it. Even if it was Loony Lovegood. Said girl seemed to think about her answer for a moment.
Draco nodded. Then he froze. "Wait. How do you know, he knows? I'm quite sure I never mentioned that."
"As if I'd tell
"Are you still with me?"
But Haley didn't seem mad at all. She simply nodded, as if his reaction didn't bother her at all. Perhaps she didn't get along with her uncle. Or maybe he really was horrible. After all, there had to be a reason, why she usually stayed at Hogwarts during Christmas break.
The office was blurring around them and there were all these images flashing in front of her eyes.
What? Ron thought Luna was a veela? She blinked at Hermione, hoping her friend could make sense of the boy's words. But Hermione seemed to be bothered in a different way. She looked angry. And like she was questioning someone's sanity. Her own? Or Ron's? But there was another thing. She looked hurt.
"I wish I remembered the dreams… like you do." He whispered against her lips. It tickled. It made her insides do somersaults. It made her want to kiss him senseless.
for real. Because there was a part of her inside her that opposed to all of this. Her sneaking into his dreams and stealing his deepest secrets from underneath his nose without him even knowing or being able to defend himself. That was why she had been hesitating. Even after everything he had done to her. She didn't want to sink this low. If she was going to find out about his secret, shouldn't he be aware of it at least? Shouldn't he get the chance to stop her?
Absently, she noticed Luna bending down to pick them up and pulling Ron away mumbling something about getting started on the lemonade.
Hi everyone! It's been a while, sorry. My only excuse is that I'm terribly stressed at the moment. Hopefully, things will calm down soon... Anyway, look at all these feelings that are starting to make things complicated. I'm super excited for the next chapter when we'll finally go back to dreamland again :) Btw, Ron and Hermione are idiots :D Wonder when they'll get it together. Leave me your thoughts! Thanks for reading!
"Here, have some of that pumpkin soup. it's delicious," he said, smiling at her and placing a bowl of steaming, hot soup in front of her.
"I think that might be enough for the start," I interrupt him. If he lists every single prank he ever played on me, we'll never finish this.
"Sneaky," he said then. "If I didn't know any better, I'd think a Slytherin came up with it."
your daughter. You're supposed to say that to
Haley shook her head, slowly. Seemingly taken aback at the sudden proximity. Draco noticed her licking her lips and it took all of his self-control not to grab her face and press his own against them. He leaned backwards, creating a safe distance between them again. He had a point to make here. He couldn't let himself get distracted. There was a flicker of surprise flashing across the girl's face. Or perhaps it was disappointment. Draco told himself it was disappointment. Back to the point, Draco!
As the girl slowly sat down, he cleared his throat once more and looked at his hands.

"I can tell you're not taking this seriously," she remarks. I sigh.
He didn't stop. Supper rolled around and Haley was just about to tuck into her lasagna – which she could finally enjoy in the Great Hall again – when suddenly it was replaced by a massive bowl of steaming noodle soup. Just the way she liked it. With carrots, sprouts, bok choy and eggs. It smelled heavenly. There was a line of sesame spread on top of it, spelling a single word.
"I figured." He sighs but the smile is still there on his lips, if only a little wistful now. "Still a pretty brilliant dream." He winks.
"Watch someone dream? I've never heard of that before… Is that what you did? How you know all of these things about me? You spied on me? While I was sleeping?" He visibly became angrier with every question he asked.
Sirius hands me a bottle that looks suspiciously like it's filled with firewhisky. I'm not really old enough for firewhiskey yet but it's not like mum is around with her eagle eyes.
"Why do you think it might be Malfoy?"
Although it was unlikely that he'd be able to make out the gobstone from all the way across the Great Hall, she didn't want to risk it.
"There should be something in the cupboard beside you," he pointed toward the cupboard she had noticed earlier. He watched her expectantly.
"She won't." Haley cut him off. "Right, Emily?"
, she thought on their way out.
"Well, who are you then?" I ask, crossing my arms in front of my chest. I'm not about to let a child talk to me like that!
"What's that?" She asked, gesturing toward the single word that was engraved into the fairy's back, almost too small to be seen. She couldn't decipher it.
"What about you? Don't you want to make up?"
them.
"There's a letter for you." Mrs Weasley announced the following morning. For a frightened second, Haley wondered if it was for her. If it was from
. You know that, right?"
"Look, you don't have to answer now. Just… think about it, okay?"
She was right. Surprisingly but completely right.
"Which is why," I pause, it's really hard to stay serious and not full out laugh at him, "Why I've come up with a suitable task to make up for your behaviour which is far from commendable."
Something hit the door with a thump. Poor plush dragon. Poor door.
"Well, not anymore," Haley mumbled, glancing over at Neville Longbottom sheepishly.
"Shh. We have a plan, don't we?" She said softly, moving her hand to his cheek and caressing it gently. "And even if it doesn't work out… you're not completely useless. You have a decent voice. You could even become the next Myron Wagtail."
"Even if she found someone else who she wants to spend time with… that doesn't mean Haley abandoned you." Her blue eyes bored into his uncomfortably. "I'm sure, she still considers you as her friend and would like you to do the same."
"Me? Nah, why d'you ask that?"
"Someone like you… You're so pathetic," he spits. "You can't even deny it! She doesn't like cowards like you. You're weak and useless and–"
Haley could have kissed him. If he hadn't used that silly nickname. If his hair was blond instead of red. If his eyes were a mysterious grey instead of clear blue. But then, this was hardly the important detail.
she wanted to protest but he was already wrapping her up in that Slytherin green scarf that was so much softer than it looked. And comfortably warm. And the way it
! I don't know if you remember but I am in fifth year now! Do you know how much homework we get every day? I barely made it to Christmas break without going insane!"
"I'm too tired to concentrate anyway," Haley interrupted her. "Thanks. I owe you." She didn't want to lose any more time. Ever since Care for Magical Creatures she felt unsettled. Something was going on between Neville and Malfoy. They were fighting for some reason. Was it because of her? But that was stupid. And it made her incredibly mad because Neville was
She should have known it wouldn't last. It started when her, Ron and Hermione made their way down the hall toward the Charms class room.
"He didn't hurt you, did he?" Mum says, inspecting my face closely, the amusement gone from her eyes.
"We only just started walking," Ginny replied. "Ten more minutes maybe?"
"Of course. I understand," Hermione said in an understanding tone, "but… you know… hypothetically speaking, if there was something else on your mind that you wanted to talk about, but you weren't sure who to turn to... you could
"So, does that mean, the curse hit me because it 'thought' I was more evil than Longbottom?" Draco grimaced, smashing his cake under the fork. "What kind of dumb curse is that?"
"Well, won't you get us a refreshment?"
For another indefinable while, Haley lost herself in his touch, his scent, the taste of his lips until –
so. I don't care for false promises and empty words." He glared at her warily. Maybe it hadn't been the most clever way of putting it.
"Hey!" George complained, rubbing his side, "It's not like that was a secret, right?"
"So, what'd you get this year?" Ron asked, plopping down at the end of Haley's bed, barely missing her presents.
"Hermione, breathe. Seriously. I'm all right. And I'm not mad. Just… needed to catch up on sleep."
"Yeah Potter, how'd it go?" He continued on without waiting for a reply, "Michael Corner? Interesting choice, Potter. I'm a little disappointed it wasn't Longbottom, here, though. I have been seriously rooting for him."
Draco gasped. "Are you blaming
Hermione didn't argue with that. She didn't have to. She knew Haley was right.
' I didn't understand at first but then it hit me. What she was really trying to say." He sighed, rubbing his hand over his face. "I'd been wrong. She only sees me as a friend. I had been stupidly thinking we were on a date, when it had been nothing but a normal trip the whole time."
Luna nodded earnestly.

"I think you should at least finish the Transfiguration assignment. It wasn't too difficult."
"You dropped something," Luna informed him politely.
"I dreamed about them once and after I woke up I spent an hour trying to remember the exact shade of green they had."
"Gotta say, he's not really my type, no. You can keep him."
Haley sighed. She'd almost expected this kind of answer from her.
"You know it." Draco said, chuckling darkly. "You know, don't you?" Suddenly, there were tears in his eyes. His lower lip started to tremble and it reminded Haley so much of her little brother that she wanted to lunge forward and hug him.
"Right," Ron agreed, sounding relieved. "I'll see you for Care of magical Creatures!"
Haley spun around. She wasn't going to let him off this easily. She had been so close…
"Wait. How did you know it's me?" As far as I can see I still have the appearance of Gregory Goyle.
Haley chuckled. "Sorry to disappoint you. I've just escaped from Hermione's revision obsession. If I didn't know any better I'd say, she enjoys torturing her friends."
He honestly couldn't believe what was happening. The way she had
Draco felt the urge to laugh at all these cheesy thoughts. How had it come to this? How could a girl make him feel this vulnerable? Like a pathetic fool. He felt so
." He was shuddering in disgust. But beneath that, it was obvious that a part of him didn't worry about the Hufflepuff part too much.
Haley raised her eyebrows. "I'm not stupid. And I do own a mirror."
