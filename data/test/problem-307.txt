This was the second time Draco apologised to Harry, and really meant it. For Harry, it was such a big deal. He cleared his throat.
He and Ron walked through the store and then Harry found a pullover he hadn't seen before. Just when Harry turned around to show it to Ron, Ron grabbed a coat Harry immediately loved.
"Well, Ron..." Harry started "After you and Hermione had left the library, Neville and I talked to the guy she was with."
"Your owl?", he asked and Harry nodded, but then he realised that Malfoy couldn't see him through the dark.
After he packed his clothes and took a shower, he went down to the kitchens. On his way there, a few Gryffindors stood in groups in the corridor, so did a lot of Slytherins.
The Entrance Hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o'clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open.
He jumped on his bed, crossed his legs and looked at Potter. Draco didn't say anything. Potter didn't say anything. They just looked at each other. Draco was looking at Potters shining green eyes behind those stupid round glasses. And Potter was looking at Draco's grey eyes. Potter licked his lips.
been there. "And if Harry chooses to trust you, we trust you too." Granger said and smiled, Draco smiled too.
Harry raised a cocky eyebrow and chuckled. He looked Malfoy in the eyes - those glistening grey eyes. But Malfoy turned away and looked at his still slightly shaking hands instead.
in watching him- by the way what was that all about, he's not a child- but Harry had thought that maybe he was important enough to Malfoy that he would at least
Horrible. Just horrible. A lot of people that walked past Draco looked at him funny when they saw him reading the article about himself. He felt like he could sink into the ground. Horrible, that was all he could think of. Why did this stupid little pathetic excuse of a journalist think this was important to be mentioned?
Harry definitely hadn't been prepared for this one. Malfoy put his hands on Harry's butt and pulled him closer again so that Harry could feel Malfoy's groin pressing against him and he was pretty sure Malfoy could feel his. Harry rolled his closed eyes inside their sockets and he tried not to moan himself, what was pretty hard considering how hard Malfoy made him. MALFOY! This was so weird.
"Yeah I don't know. I mean I like them but it's really complicated. I don't know exactly. Things have been so bad the whole time in the past and I don't know if I can just swallow the old feelings and even if I do maybe they don't and it would be really weird and awkward all the time."
"Guess he got away for good." Harry said and Hermione shot him an outraged look. "What? I'm just saying if you're over forty and get locked up for twenty years-"
Malfoy didn't answer, he only grinned widely. There was a sparkle in his eyes. Harry stepped closer and grabbed Draco's left wrist. He turned his inner arm upwards and looked at it intensely.
"What the-", but Malfoy followed Harry's gaze and realization dawned on him. "Oh." He said, his face getting paler than it already was.
Draco laughed and took Harry's hand. They followed Miss Malfoy through the hallway to the dining room.
Harry didn't know what to say. He took Draco's hand. How had he never thought of the fact that this relationship affected Draco as well as Harry?
"Even though we don't need it." Harry added quietly as he followed Hermione and the floating pot to the table.
Hermione and Ginny looked impressed while Ron looked like he was figuring out whether this was a joke or not. Harry smiled gently and nodded. If Malfoy thought he needed to do this, here and now, Harry didn't want to stop him because maybe this would be the only time Draco would have the strength.
The black haired idiot smiled and Draco's heart actually fluttered. It fluttered! Why? It wasn't supposed to
The minister narrowed his eyes again. Draco's heart was beating fast. He looked from Potter to the minister to his father to the Wizengamot and back to Potter. There was a moment of silence in the courtroom while the minister glared at Potter, who stood there with his usual smile and looked back at the minister. Then the jury started whispering and the minister took his gavel and knocked on his table.
The sleeping arrangements issue has been resolved as Harry and Draco had fallen asleep in his bed while Harry had told him all about amusement parks, but Harry hadn't told Draco what he and his mother had talked about even though Draco had asked about ten times. Harry had just said she seemed to be feeling a lot better. That turned out to be true the next morning as Harry and Draco went downstairs, both dressed in their very different pyjamas. Narcissa sat in the winter garden while people that looked like servants rushed in and out, carrying plates and plates of food. Harry smiled. Since they had lost their house elf Dobby, the Malfoy family must have hired a whole staff of servants. When she spotted the boys, she got up and Harry's eyes fell on her impressive velvet robe. She wore a lipstick in a dark red, a strong contrast to her pale skin and her hair was pulled back into a tight bun. That Draco was safe must have been really good to hear.
Harry sighed again and shuffled towards the sofa, where he squeezed in next to Luna, Neville and Ron. The others continued their talk, and since Harry didn't know what it was about, he just sat there and stared into the fire.
When Draco woke up he found himself lying next to the Gryffindor boy, who was still asleep. There was a half-foot safety distance between the two boys. Draco warmed his hands under the blanket, then slowly brushed the black hair off Potter's forehead. The lighting-shaped scar became visible. Draco sighed.
Harry dropped the soap as the thought ran thought his head. Malfoy had been into it just as much as Harry was. Maybe Malfoy had enjoyed kissing Harry, but just freaked out. That would seem reasonable for Harry, considering how Malfoy had been raised like Hermione had said. Harry shook his head and stepped out of the shower. Harry shouldn't be thinking about this right now, he should focus on his birthday. Ron and Hermione have rented a pub and invited Harry's friends, the rest was a surprise. He wrapped himself into a towel, hurried through the corridor to his room and dressed himself.
Harry thought he must be dreaming. Malfoy looked... hot. His pale skin looked even paler and his hair looked even shinier in the light that came out of the bathroom. Malfoy had wrapped a towel around his waist and wore nothing else. A strand of wet hair fell into his face. His arms were as skinny as they were muscular. It was kind of weird. Malfoy's arms and his body looked like he was working out but at the same time he was still slim. Harry thought he noticed a slight sixpack on his belly, but it must have been the light. But what Harry definitely noticed was the V-line. These damn hot muscles Malfoy had on his lower abs that were visible over his towel. In a soft movement Malfoy brushed the strand of hair out of his face with his long fingers. Harry thought he was going to faint.
"Ron, let me explain.", Harry said nervously. Draco stepped closer to him again and Harry felt brave again.
"I meant to drink." He said loudly and realised that it must have been too loud, because she looked stunned and let go of him.
Malfoy sat down on the wall and stared straight ahead. Harry slowly walked over to him and sat down next to him, not thinking about the pouring rain. He didn't know what to say or if he even was supposed to say anything. But after all, Malfoy
The fire in the common room was slowly going out and the lights were dim. Neville enjoyed the silence when everyone else was asleep and he could just focus on his book about plants. Ron was usually already asleep very early and he was snoring so loudly, Neville couldn't possibly read in their room. Since he couldn't go to Luna's room and he wouldn't be able to concentrate there anyways, he figured he'd stay awake for as long as it took the others to go to bed. Today, it was around eleven when the last group split up and left for their dorms.
"I will write you a lot of letters," Ron said as Hermione looked at them with sad eyes, "and we'll send you boxes of pictures."
After kissing Hermione on the forehead, Ron followed Harry and made their way through the crowd. A lot of people came up to them not to talk, but only to touch Harry, to shake his hand and then run off again.
Not this too, Draco thought. He hoped his name wouldn't be mentioned in the article. His father would be furious if he would read that Draco walked around school blowing people up and causing trouble. Instead of driving himself crazy, Draco decided to open page nine and read the article while walking to class.
Now many people were joining the dance, so the champions weren't the centre of attention anymore. Draco was steering and Harry trod on his foot.
Harry took a sip of water, closed the door to his dead godfather's room and opened the door to his own. It was one of the few rooms in this house Harry had actually renovated. It now had shining white walls and a black stone fireplace, a Gryffindor banner hung on one wall and on another were pictures of Harry and his friends and family. His bed was red and Harry loved it. He put his glass of water on the bedside table and carefully lay down, he didn't want to upset his stomach. Harry just hoped everything would end as soon as possible.
"Um... you all know Potter?", he asked and furrowed his brow, confused about why he just asked that stupid question.
As Malfoy didn't answer to that, Harry figured he should just keep talking. He had to lay it all out on the open once and for all.
"Anyways, I was thinking about it since I got the letter and I reckon Malfoy wants an answer, but I just can't decide if I want to go. Or if I should."
Harry had already known about the trial before the Prophet had reported about it, because Narcissa Malfoy told him in a letter about it. They have been writing letters for a short time, but given the time they both stopped. Now they only wrote to each other when something exciting had happened, in this case it was Lucius' trials. Narcissa was very afraid of it even though she, Harry and everyone else already knew what was going to happen. Harry had promised her he would come and give a good word for Lucius.
"You only need to use pesticide on her and she'll shrink.", Draco explained and Potter started laughing.
Draco opened his arms, sighed and drank his lemonade. He watched Blaise and the bartender in deep conversation and wondered how Blaise managed to get every girl's undivided attention within minutes.
Harry wished he could kiss Malfoy right now, but Harry didn't want to throw salt in the wound Malfoy had just opened for him. First, Harry had to be sure Malfoy wanted it. It didn't take long for Harry to figure it out because Malfoy slowly leaned forward and closed his lips around Harry's.
Harry sighed. He didn't feel like he had to apologise to Ron for taking Draco to the ball, because that was absolutely ridiculous.
Even after the war, Harry was surprised to see people flinching at the name. But Malcolm shook his head wordlessly.
To Draco's - or Pansy's - luck Theo cleared his throat and slightly shook his head at Pansy. She understood and dropped it. Draco would never tell anyone about this. Never. Anyone.
The air inside was warm and smelled of spilled alcohol and sweat. Draco wrinkled his nose as they walked through the crowd to the bar.
Harry couldn't finish the sentence because the words got stuck in his throat. The crowd opened and the blonde boy pushed his way through towards Harry. Harry looked at Hermione with wide eyes and she smiled at him. The music of the band filled the room again and the people were talking again, apart from those watching Harry and Malfoy with fascinated looks - they probably expected a fight. But there wasn't one. Hermione patted Harry on the back once again and then left him standing alone. Well not alone, with Malfoy.
Before Harry could answer, Malfoy ordered another round. The tired bartender filled their glasses with firewhiskey again and slurped back over to talk to her colleague.
"Yeah, she was really angry. Said the next time you do this you'll get detention. She was in no good mood today.", Ron added.
"You're not cooking with magic?" Malfoy asked surprised when Harry didn't leave the stove immediately.
Draco hadn't visited Harry until the weekend came around and with it the sun came back out. Harry was glad to see that Malfoy still showed up happily. They spent the weekend together with Ron and Teddy and even though Malfoy didn't like children, he made a real effort to get along with Harry's godson.
Malfoy pulled his head back and their lips separated, but Malfoy's hands didn't let go of Harry's hair so Harry wasn't worried Malfoy was freaking out. In fact, he was just stopping to catch his breath and look at Harry and Harry looked at him. Now not only Malfoy's rosy cheeks were colourful, but his lips were also puffy and red. Harry grinned and Malfoy rolled his eyes, but immediately went back for another kiss.
"Do what you want, Potter. I don't care and you don't have to tell me every fucking time.", Malfoy answered and rolled his eyes.
like them?" He asked and Harry shrugged. He thought it was really cool of Neville that he didn't immediately jump to say "her" but "them".
"Yes, Ron, so should have you. The NEWTs are very important for our on-going careers," Hermione said sternly as if jobs at the Ministry weren't already secured for them.
Harry's insides rumbled and his heart skipped a beat as he finally closed the distance between himself and Draco. Draco gasped quietly and Harry giggled. His senses were overfilled, Draco's hands grabbed Harry's ass and Harry's hands found their way into Draco's soft hair. The kiss didn't last long, because someone behind them slammed a bag to the floor. Harry was startled and pulled away from Draco.
Harry woke up and looked around. His room was dark but he knew by heart where everything was, so Harry got up and slowly manoeuvred his way between his potions table and bike towards the door. He sneaked over to the room down the hall, opened the door and stepped inside. Harry got in bed next to his godfather and slipped under the blanket.
Malfoy was now more like a little boy than ever. Even in first year he had been like grownup - bossy and moody and a bitch. Now he was lying in bed - he didn't think he
"I'm not going home over summer. No chance.", answered Draco, taking out a piece of parchment and a quill.
Harry had never been in a store like this. It was clean and open and bright. And everywhere shone the name of the store. Ron looked around curiously and Harry and Seamus watched him with a grin. He looked like a little child with bright eyes, wanting to touch everything. An employee came towards them, a beautiful tall and slender man with short brown hair, who moved his body elegantly. He eyed the three young men standing in front of him.
Harry looked from Malfoy to Teddy and back to Malfoy, thinking hard for a moment. Then Harry smiled. "I love you too."
"And I remember that I was so uninterested about the whole thing." Malfoy answered "To be completely honest, I wasn't interested until I spotted you."
Draco thought about telling him, he really did. But then Draco remembered that Blaise wasn't talking to him these days and Draco was afraid of telling Blaise something that Blaise would tell his new friends.
Harry rolled his eyes. They couldn't leave him alone, could they? He didn't want to tell them about meeting Malfoy because after all Harry didn't know if Malfoy wanted them to know.
Malfoy had spent dinner in the kitchens again. After the meal, Harry said goodbye to his friends and walked back to his room, where Malfoy was already lying in his bed.
"Where are the other two sleeping?" Malfoy asked as Harry levitated the dirty dishes into the dishwasher.
Kissing Harry again, Malfoy moved backwards, guiding Harry - unexpectedly - towards his bed. Before they reached it, Harry stopped.
"Actually... you've missed almost two weeks," Malfoy said carefully, "But don't worry, I wrote everything down we did in the classes we have together, and I'm sure your friends have notes for you as well," Malfoy friend to calm him down.
Draco wasn't bad at giving hand jobs. No, not at all. In fact, on a scale from one to ten, he would make a good ten. Last night, for example, was incredible. Harry smiled. Draco could always manage to make him happy, no matter in what damn idiot situation he was.
Harry felt really uncomfortable. He wanted to do something with Malfoy but Ron and Hermione wouldn't understand if he would let them down. To Harry's luck, Malfoy had an excuse at the ready.
Harry realized he and Malfoy had never talked about any of this, they never even closely approached the topic of the last two years since Dumbledore's death. Has the time finally come when they would open up? When Draco would open up?
Harry always found these robes ugly, but Draco somehow managed it to look strangely good in them. Or only Harry thought he was looking good in them, he wasn't sure about that.
Had Draco really offered it now? Had he given Harry really a chance? An actual chance? Harry breathed out.
He wasn't angry. Well maybe he was, but mostly he was just frustrated because he was suddenly feeling all these things and he didn't know what they were. Draco realized that all he wanted was for Potter to understand how he felt even though he didn't know it himself.
He put all his strength into his body and sat up. Draco grabbed his father's walking stick, leaned on it and limped out of his room. Walking was close to painless now, but Potter wouldn't allow Draco to leave the bed without some support, so Draco took the walking stick with him. Theo was already awake- joined by Blaise since Pansy was at Hogwarts. They were in deep conversation about the upcoming party when Draco entered the living room.
"Why don’t you take these off?", he asked. Harry's hands shook like mad as he pulled down his trousers. Draco breathed right next to Harry.
"Oh, for Heaven's sake, Potter. Pull yourself together." Malfoy spat but couldn't hold back a smile himself.
Even though it seemed frightening at first, the Manor was actually very impressive with it's high ceilings and big windows. Malfoy stopped in front of a room almost at the end of the hallway and Harry figured there must be his room behind it.
"We are here for the trial of Lucius Malfoy." The minister spoke and his loud voice echoed in the courtroom.
After breakfast, Harry and Draco changed into their clothes, in separate rooms of course, and went back outside with their brooms in their hands. Draco still had his Nimbus 2001, the one his father had bought for the whole Slytherin Quidditch team in second year, after Harry had gotten the older model in first year. Harry was proud and a bit melancholic as he held on to his Firebolt, a gift by Sirius. Harry didn't want to get a new broom - it was still one of the best ones in the world and one of the few things he still had from Sirius.
He got dressed and walked downstairs, where his mother was already waiting, wearing her wonderful dark blue gowns.
Ginny entered the common room and sat down on the armchair next to Hermione. Crookshanks jumped from Hermione next to Ginny and Ginny smiled. Hermione turned away from Harry and talked to Ginny.
Harry smiled too. He didn't know whether he should be was relieved or not, if the wise woman in front of him just knew about him and Malfoy or if she knew about
The lessons flew by and Draco made his way back to the kitchens to have dinner. He sighed and stepped in.
"Stand up.", he ordered. Malfoy looked at his hand with obvious disgust and stood up without Harry's help.
Harry was really happy for them, but he couldn't fight the feeling of jealousy. There were so many things Harry knew he couldn't do with Malfoy, because Malfoy was raised differently, he had a completely different view on the world and Harry didn't know if he could change that.
Draco was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour's sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep.
He eyed the professor admiring and she smiled at him friendly. Professor Sprout was Neville's absolute favourite teacher and herbology was Neville's absolute favourite class and this was the class he was best in.
"Welcome home." She said smiling and greeted Ron as well, "So nice to have you back here without being responsible for your misbehavior."
Almost at the end of the movie, not two hours after Harry had sent the letter, Malfoy's owl was back. Hermione and Ron jumped up from the couch and looked curiously at Harry as he let the owl inside and took the letter. He read it himself, his eyes rushing over the words, then looked up at Ron and Hermione, who watched him with wide eyes.
Draco didn't hesitate, but leaned forwards and reached for Potter, letting his hand run along his waist, feeling for the shape of his body through the thick folds of his cloak. Potter's lips parted, and Draco held his breath.
His cheeks were getting hot and Ron snickered, until, again, Hermione slapped him. Dean left the common room, so Ginny sat down on the armchair. And then, there was a small awkward moment. Okay, it was not small, but
"Fine, but I'm not wearing your clothes. Go to Theo's apartment and ask him for some clothes for me. He'll know what to pick."
"Then look me in the eyes and tell me that you don't want this. And I'll leave you alone and everything will be as it was."
Harry and Seamus followed them and sat down as Ron put the pot in the centre of the table. They ate and laughed and Harry's eye fell on the clock. He had an hour until he had to be at the party. Harry felt his heartbeat fasten with the ticking of the clock. Why was he so excited?
Draco hated it to be alone. Potter was right, Draco really had no one. His friends were not on his school anymore, his mother was at home, his father... Draco didn't even want to
"No," Harry said very softly and kneeled next to Malfoy on the floor, " I won't leave you. Not this time."
Reaching the bar, Harry ordered drinks for everyone and as he fumbled for money in his pocket the blonde bartender grabbed his hand.
Potter grabbed the letter and handed it to Granger and she handed it to Draco. Draco looked at the handwriting and immediately knew who the letter was from. His life was now officially over.
"Harry what-" Hermione shrieked when she saw Harry out of bed, but Harry shushed her down. "What are you doing?" She whispered outraged.
Seamus sang "If I was a sculptor..." when he stepped out from behind another tent and joined the others around the bonfire.
"Tomorrow? For dinner?", Draco asked and Potter nodded. He threw the letter to the couch and walked close to Draco.
"I don't know. Maybe I'll wait for you in front of the Great Hall?", Harry suggested and Draco nodded.
Ron looked between the two of them with a confused look, but Harry just shrugged and slapped Draco on his leg under the table.
When Harry woke up, the bed was empty. Before Malfoy had left, he had wrapped Harry into the blanket. Harry smiled. He felt a lot better now, his headache was almost gone. But when Harry got up, he ran to the toilet to throw up. He rolled his eyes and washed his face. Getting downstairs, Harry heard Ron, Draco and Seamus talk. Seamus was here?
"How long have you been here?" Harry asked Hermione as they went inside, but before he got an answer, Mrs Weasley came out of the kitchen and greeted Ron and Harry with a hug and a kiss on the cheek.
They nodded and sat down at a table, watching the two boys at the bar closely. Harry sat down on the stool next to Malfoy and when Malfoy didn't want to look at him, Harry grabbed the seat of Malfoy's stool and turned it in his direction.
He grabbed his bag and quickly left the dungeons. He had missed Transfiguration, so Harry hurried to greenhouse two, where his class already waited. Professor Sprout came just right after him.
Draco was woken up by the smell of cooking sausages. He rubbed his eyes and flung himself out of bed.
Malfoy chuckled quietly, but not too quietly for Harry to hear. He cut into his steak, shoved the piece into his mouth and washed it down with some lemonade.
Draco stood up angrily. His temples hurt and his fist was itching to grab his wand and hex this whole family, especially the stupid uncle of Potter's.
Next thing he knew, Harry stood on the familiar gravel driveway between large hedges. He felt a cold shiver going down his spine and somehow couldn't make his feet move. Harry gulped and looked at the wrought-iron gates that he had already stood in front of. What was he doing here? He couldn't be here - why did he think he could? Harry wanted to turn around, but Bond hooted in his cage. Harry looked upwards and saw Malfoy's eagle owl descending from a window and rose high into the air. Harry figured the window must belong to Draco's room.
Seamus came over the next day on December first, with only two days left for the party. His flawless outfit made Harry confident in his choice of company, though Ron wanted to come as well. The three of them knew a lot about Muggles and their stores - Harry being raised by them, Seamus having a Muggle dad and Ron having a father who was very interested in them. Therefore they had no problem finding the stores Harry wanted to go to in the centre of London. Harry knew if he wanted to impress Malfoy and his friends, he had to go all out. Fist stop: Louis Vuitton.
hate you, I dont know." He continued and Harry felt his heart beating hardly, "But now - I don't know. I don't think I hate you anymore."
"Don't you dare, you loser!", Draco told himself. A house elf gave him a tissue and smiled friendly.
"Would you- please, let me finish." Draco said and the redhead fell silent. "I know it's normal to ask the parents, but you are his only family and I know he loves you just as much."
"Really?", he asked and Draco saw something in his eyes he couldn't identify. He nodded and shrugged.
"And he's really trying, you know." Harry continued even though he felt like Malfoy wouldn't want to be defended.
This wiped the smile off Lydia's face. "Oh." She said and kept swiping the groceries over the cash desk. Harry stepped from one foot to another uncomfortably. Luckily, when they were ready to go, Lydia smiled at him again and wished him a nice week - Draco was ignored.
"Well for Malfoy's mother, I think your concern is justified. She was a follower of Voldemort, you know that." Ron said.
"I think you're going to like that." Malfoy said before opening the door with a proud smile on his lips.
Harry shrugged wordlessly and took another step towards Draco. Draco looked at Harry with his intense grey eyes and Harry smirked. He had never felt this brave before and especially not when it came to kissing someone he liked.
"Oh, he's doing great, thanks. He's such a sweet guy, I love him so much." Harry answered and smiled.
They put on their dress robes, what felt to Harry like the most beautiful feeling in the world. He was very excited to come back - back home.
Draco turned his head to look at him. Potter was still looking at the ceiling, but eventually also looked at Draco and smiled a bit. Draco smiled too, putting his hand on Potter's face.
As Ron fumbled at the collar of Harry's shirt, Harry took a deep breath and nodded slowly. He felt dizzy, but in a good way - a really good way. Ron straightened Harry's black tie and took a step back to look at him. Ron looked very neat today - his hair was cut and he wore a nice dark blue suit. Harry turned around to look at himself in the mirror. He himself wore a white suit, complementing his tanned skin and black hair. He didn't know what Malfoy was going to wear, but he had a strong suspicion it was going to be a black suit - it made Malfoy look very hot after all. Harry put on his shining black dress shoes and struggled with the shoelaces as his fingers were trembling.
Harry laughed and blushed. "I'm flattered." He said, "But I think Goyle really improved his figure over the last months."
They lay in the dim light of their wands for a while before either one of them spoke again. Harry had the feeling Malfoy was about to fall asleep, but he wanted to know something.
Draco smiled nervously and pulled down his boxer shorts. Harry couldn't move. This was Draco Malfoy like God made him. Fully undressed in front of Harry. And he was fucking beautiful!
Ron nodded slowly and Harry guessed he too saw how stupid and pathetic this fight was. Harry noticed that they'd never just once used Malfoy's name. Hermione smiled gladly.
"You know, his mother likes me and as much as I know, Parkinson tries to like me as well. So if Lucius should attack me or something, there will be at least three people who will hold him back.", he answered. Ron nodded slowly.
"I am so sorry," Harry said, "I didn't think. This bloke, Matt, I came across him when I left McGonnagal's office and he was lost. So, being the friendly person I am, I asked him if I could help him. And he was really freaked out about appearing too late to his first lesson. So I offered to talk to Slughorn, given the history I share with him. And because Matt was really nervous, I just held out my hand and wanted to lead the way. But Malfoy, you have to believe me, I didn't mean
Potter had been there with Theo earlier when Draco had been released from St. Mungo's. He and Theo had had a short talk outside of Draco's room while a healer helped Draco get dressed out of the robe and into his regular clothes. Draco wasn't going to stay with Potter for the coming week, he would be at home with Theo but Potter had said he would visit. What Potter didn't know, and what Draco wouldn't tell him, was where he and Theo were going.
Harry and Ron said goodbye to Hermione, Neville and Dean, who joined the rest of the students in the Entrance Hall. Professor Sprout was already waiting for the first-years. Harry and Ron went to Headmistress McGonagall's office.
In the kitchens, he sunk down on the chair and lay his head in his hands. He sniffed, but tried to prevent his already wet eyes from crying.
A branch being blown against the window woke Harry up again. The room was dark now, only the moon shining through the windows illuminated the edges of the furniture. Harry yawned and stretched. When he tried to sit up, his back ached and his tummy turned upside down. He hoped not to vomit again. He realised he had left Hogwarts just like that - without telling McGonnagal, without asking for permission. He hoped Hermione and Ron would do good in covering for him, he relied on them.
Draco rolled his eyes. The two of them were so... Draco doesn't even have a word for it. They just make him sick. Weasel and Granger. Professor Sprout clapped in her hands and smiled to the class.
Draco reached with his hand over the table and grabbed Harry's hand, that lay next to his plate on the table. Potter looked at Draco, who smiled sadly and Potter smiled too. He even bent over and kissed Draco.
They could have used some lube, or something to ease the movements of their bodies, but Draco found it too trivial to worry about that. He rather worried about thrusting upward, trying to make Potter move faster, but Potter distracted him by slipping his tongue into Draco's mouth and then rudely pulling away. Draco's tongue followed it, demanding a proper kiss. They met halfway, sliding their tongues together, not even touching each other's lips.
"Not really, I like cooking. Some things I don't really have time or lust for, I simply do with magic." Harry shrugged.
The room was quite cosy. The two beds were opposite of each other, next to each of them was a shelf for their books and a closet. The bathroom was small, compared to the bathroom Harry had used the six years before. There was a shower, a sink and a toilet, that was it. Harry liked their room pretty much, apart from sharing it with Draco sodding Malfoy.
Draco didn't hesitate a second. He punched Blaise in his face with his fist. Blaise's nose bleeded and Draco's knuckles hurt. Potter looked at Draco with a confused and shocked look.
Much later, Hermione was shocked when she checked her watch and realised they have go to class before their professors got angry. So Harry's friends said goodbye to the two boys. Harry looked at Malfoy.
Harry nodded. He, too, had been up to vomit three times. They slowly drank their tea and enjoyed the sound of the rain pounding against the windows, both closing their eyes again for a while. Harry dozed off, but only for a minute, because then Hermione came into the room. Her hair was bushier than usually, but she didn't look as hungover as the two boys.
Draco grunted again and before he realized it, Theo grabbed the letter, jumped up and opened it. Draco protested at first, but he was too interested in what the letter said, so he stopped. After a quick scan of the page, Theo grinned and Draco immediately recognized the grin as the one Theo would give Blaise when he successfully picked up a girl.
Harry closed his ears. Tears streamed into his eyes. The last two sentences had hurt the most. Now he could hear Hermione's voice saying:
He couldn't stop staring up at Potter, eyes raking over his features hungrily, feasting on the jet-black hair that fell over his sweaty forehead, the green eyes darkened by dilated pupils, and lips parted and wet from Draco's kisses. Potter's expression was, for once, difficult to read. He looked partly smug, and partly amazed, as though his eyes saw something in Draco's that could cause awe.
"Good. Now leave me alone," Draco answered and grabbed his pyjama before vanishing back in the bathroom.
Ron followed Harry back to the dressing rooms, where they walked past Seamus who just wrote down his telephone number. Harry saw Ron rolling his eyes before he closed the curtain. Trying the outfit on, Harry could imagine the very look Malfoy would give him: the same impressed look Harry himself had right now.
Not when Draco felt like his insides were falling apart. Potter couldn't leave him alone with his troubling thoughts and his so uncomfortable room- maybe the room was just uncomfortable when Draco was alone and reminded of all these horrible things he had heard in this room. And maybe... But Draco was thinking too much again. It was easier to think of other things when Potter was around.
Harry tried to think of good memories, of things that made him happy. And funnily enough, Malfoy came to mind again. His smile that was way too rare, his grey eyes, his excited look when he watched Harry dance and his stupid favorite ice cream flavor.
. You go to classes because of your N.E.W.T.s and because the teachers wouldn't like it if you don't come.", he said.
"Okay then I'll tell you when to get up," Potter said and he sounded so understating and sweet it made Draco's heart jump. Draco didn't even want to know what it felt - let alone tasted like.
Malfoy did it again and this time, it was unmistakably a very quiet moan of pleasure. Harry looked up. He felt his cheeks burning.
Harry's heart was racing and he shoved Draco away. "Be quiet. You won't remember what you're saying tomorrow anyway."
They walked out on the street get some breakfast. Draco grabbed Potter's hand and they apparated. After they arrived in front of a wizarding coffee shop, Draco felt sick. He will never get used to apparating.
"I did and I've seen little improvement. I'm not going to ask anymore. When I see him eating alone, even when it makes me sad, I'm not going to ask. Why should I if all I get is a 'Fuck off'?"
They strolled around the Christmas market. Ron and Hermione were holding hands, while Harry and Draco walked next to them, keeping a safe distance to each other.
like this? I have never been nice to people, not even to my own friends, and especially not to Harry Potter. So if I say something like this and then to
"So, what were you really talking about this morning?" Neville asked as soon as they were out of earshot from the rest of their friends."
Now, everyone looked after them as they left the shop and shortly before the door closed, violent whisper started. Potter hugged him tightly.
Malfoy smiled. He smiled! And then, he flushed. His pale cheeks reddened and he looked more than adorable. Harry's heart skipped a beat. "You're so cheesy" Malfoy said and Harry laughed. His laugh made Malfoy's smile even bigger.
"Yeah. He told me about his relationship to his parents and his friends and about his childhood and Voldemort."
"This is nonsense." Harry said, "Hermione saw us and all she did was smile and say she was going to the store. And you weren't even awake, she could have said anything she wanted without you hearing about it."
Harry grinned. Seamus and Sam turned around to look at him as well. Seamus whistled loudly and Harry laughed. He found it. Malfoy would be so blown away.
"I expect your father to write a letter as well. I for one, am shocked and surprised. This morning I read the article, I am sure you know which one I am talking about, and I don't know what to think. This is a surprise. Since when have you had contact with Potter? Why haven't you ever mentioned something? Why didn't you tell me? I understand why you didn't want to tell your father, but me?! I also have sporadical contact with Potter, so I thought you would trust me with this information."
"Don't worry about me. I'll just go and pretend that I don't exist so you can talk shit about me." Draco said and left in his room.
Harry's eyes darted from Malfoy's eyes to his lips, to his shaking hands in his lap and back to his eyes that were now closed. Harry couldn't imagine what was going on in Malfoy's head right now, but he wished Malfoy would tell him. Malfoy sighed exhausted and Harry got the feeling that he could go right back to sleep.
Draco opened the door and stepped into the office. Professor McGonnagal sat on her desk and read over the rim of her small glasses. She looked up and smiled at Draco.
Just when he put on a fresh shirt, the doorbell rang. Harry was startled but immediately gathered himself again and hurried downstairs towards the door. He couldn't quite explain the weird feeling in his stomach, but somehow Harry felt like he might throw up. Slowly opening the door Harry peeked outside. Malfoy stood there on the doorstep, broom in his one hand and a pack of cigarettes in the other. Malfoy quickly stuffed them away and looked at Harry, who suddenly forgot how to talk. This was just so weird.
He lay there, feeling full of more emotions than he had words for, until he heard the rustle of skirts and opened his eyes slowly. He suddenly remembered that they were still in the hospital and froze.
Now it was Draco's turn to redden. He took his hand off of Potter's cheek and bushed away his hair. Suddenly, Potter closed his eyes. Draco watched him with a smile until Potter opened his eyes again and Draco saw they were filled with tears.
"Look, I know that Potter tells you stuff and I know you know about the fight we had, but I want you to know that's not who I am. I don't want you to be worried."
In the hallway, they passed a little cupboard under the stairs and Draco felt Potter's hand twitching.
Harry was obsessed with Draco's hair. It was so wonderfully soft and felt so good gliding though Harry's fingers.
Draco was astonished how quickly he revealed it without being scared of Lucius' reaction. Draco nodded and watched his father.
Harry grappled at the collar of Draco's shirt, and he was on his tip-toes, angling his head into it.
"But we have to go shopping for clothes first, I don't want you to show up in that hideous sweater of yours." Malfoy added before he left.
Draco slapped himself and stood up. He took a deep breath. He was no baby. He could do this. What was he so afraid of anyways?
Harry concentrated on Draco's tongue doing incredible things and Draco's hands holding Harry's wrists. Before anything more happened, Draco pulled away quickly. Harry acted to ask what was wrong, but Draco lay a finger to his lips.
Draco found himself so ridiculous and he was ashamed of what he felt for the Chosen One. Draco hated it when people called Potter like that. He was a lot more than the Chosen One. He was a saviour, he was a noble knight, he was a dream, he was... Draco stared into the darkness. Not the darkness of the tunnel, that was just a metaphor. He stared into the darkness of his room at Malfoy Manor.
Theo hadn't answered, he'd just rolled his eyes and grabbed a girl's butt. She had looked at him outraged, but he'd whispered something in her ear and she went with him. That was when Draco had ordered his first whiskey. That was an hour ago. Since then he hadn't seen any of his friends.
So Draco told her everything about their talks at night and their kiss and his Patronus lesson. And the powerful memory. Narcissa smiled at that point.
"Let me do it.", Potter offered and looked at the big bruise with a worried look. He held out his hand, but Draco slipped away, so that his back hit the wall.
They all made their way up to the tower as the sun set behind the castle. It got dark outside and the many candles in the hallways lit up. The fire in the common room made the room glow in an orangey light and Harry loved how cozy it looked. The few students in there played wizards chess and Ron asked to join. Luna and Neville immediately cuddled up in the armchair and Dean sat down and wrote a letter to Seamus who hasn't returned for his eight year.
Potter's panting breath brushed against Draco's neck and Draco increased the suction, making Potter shudder harder. Parting with the delicious skin reluctantly, Draco looked at the darkening bruise on Potter's neck.
"DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO SAY ABOUT THIS! IT IS AN OUTRAGE! YOU BESMIRCH OUR NAME WITH THIS SCUM! YOU ARE FRATERNIZING WITH THE ENEMY, MY DEAR SON. I HOPE THIS WILL BE A GOOD LESSON TO YOU! I REALLY HAVE NO WORDS!", Lucius Malfoy's voice bellowed through the room.
Arousal shot through Harry like wildfire, sending blood to his spent cock, he was trapped in Draco's arms with Draco's scowling face in front of him and nothing about it seemed perilous or wrong. He was surprised to realise that if Draco decided to pull him back down beneath the covers, Harry would have let him do whatever he wished.
His room felt so cold and empty. Just as Draco felt himself. He decided that he wouldn't sleep anymore and stood up. With a flick of his wand, he put on a dim light in his room. Draco walked over to his shelf, where a small box was standing. He took it, sat back down on his bed and opened it. The box was filled with old newspapers. He pulled out the first one and Draco smiled a bit. He read the article that told nothing but Potter being a hero and the Chosen One. Draco nearly knew the article by heart.
Harry told him to sit down and he did. They talked a long time and Harry tasted these delicious cookies.
And what was most exhausting was that Draco couldn't even talk to anyone about it. He could most definitely
Harry and Draco snapped apart and looked up. Harry only now realized they weren't even in his room - they lay in the middle of the living room, on the carpet, in their underwear. Ron stood there and covered his eyes.
Harry laughed at the pathetic sight and slammed the door behind himself. Back in the living room, he found that Teddy had started to cry and Harry took him off Ginny's arms. Cradling the tiny boy in his arms, Harry sat down on the couch. He hummed a melody and watched Teddy's eyes slowly falling shut.
Hermione's bushy hair waved in the wind as she walked across the schoolyard. Harry noticed Malfoy's friend Zabini sitting on a bench with Zacharias Smith. Zabini looked up at Harry while he was talking and immediately seemed to understand Harry's questioning look and shrugged.
Draco blinked and a blue light shot towards him. The girl had conjured a wordless charm, but nothing hit him.
His silk pyjama felt cold in the light breeze of the corridors at Hogwarts. Draco hoped that Peeves wouldn't cross his way, because that would be his end.
Harry rolled his eyes. Why did he have to go against Ginny now? "No, she didn't. I think she just - you know - woke me up."
When they arrived at Hogwarts, they were happy to see Hagrid back in his usual position when he gathered the first-years to sail with them across the Black Lake to the castle. They couldn't talk to him properly, but Hagrid promised they would meet later. Normally, people assumed the carriages pulled themselves up to the castle, but this year a large portion of the students knew better - they were being pulled by the spooky-looking Thestrals. There were only a few Hogwarts students that have been able to see these creatures before the war because only they have seen people die, but now after the war there were, naturally, a lot more.
"Yes, Potter. My mother." Draco answered harshly, "Told me the Manor wasn't a place for me anymore. As if it had been a place for me before. It stopped being a place for me when my father invited...
Harry shrugged. "She asked me what my relationship to you was and I didn't want to be kicked out, so I said the first good and plausible thing that came to mind."
She flipped the page. In the next picture was Narcissa herself, Draco in her arm. They both smiled, so did Harry. Draco was so cute when he was a child.
Harry felt dizzy and he had to sit down. He looked up at the healer that still stood there, her clipboard clutched to her chest.
"I dare you to ruin another year for me! Hogwarts is the only thing I have left and I bloody dare you!" Harry said angrily.
Seamus came running into the kitchen, where Ron and Harry cooked dinner. Harry turned around and furrowed his brow. Seamus had his ringing cellphone in his right hand.
As the night went on, Harry and Draco had thrown back several glasses of liquor.With every shot they drank, Harry felt dizzier and Malfoy's words got more slurred. They made it to the coatroom two more times, each time taking longer than the one before. Harry looked into Malfoy's grey eyes as he bent over him. Then, Malfoy rolled his eyes back and Harry grabbed his bare ass. The moans and groans got louder, too. Harry grinned every time and Malfoy bit his lip to hard, it felt like it was about to bleed.
He got dressed with an unimpressed flick of his wand. Harry was not motivated today. He shuffled out and up to the headmistress' office.
Draco froze. Harry could've slapped himself. He was so stupid! Why did he say this now? He ruined everything! Harry hated himself, Draco must hate Harry and-
The door swung open and Potter stepped inside. As a reflex, Draco threw the Prophet back into the box and closed it. Potter didn't bother to ask. He didn't even bother to look. Draco rolled his eyes and watched Potter throw his bag to the floor and sitting down at the desk. With Potter in the room Draco couldn't put the box back to its original place. So he just pushed it under his bed and hoped Potter would leave before Draco forgot the box there.
Malfoy shortly hesitated, then got up and sat down next to Harry on the couch. "I'm sorry I wrote this to my father. I just figured since he is.. you know... I might as well tell him what he wants to hear," Malfoy said.
Ron asked them about their summer and Neville started to tell them every little detail he had done in the holidays. Luna only smiled. She looked very pale and Harry knew it was because of the war. The war had left scars on people, scars on the outside and on the inside.
"Nope.", Draco laughed, "I'm your treasure! I'm your treasure!", he kept singing and Harry blushed, while Ron laughed loudly.
So he sat awake and tired on the floor, his eyes red and burning. He didn't know what to do, how to make things right. He didn't even know where Potter went. He didn't know how to get in touch with Potter, he didn't know if he was at Weasley's house or if he was somewhere else. Draco remembered that Potter's godson or something was at the Weasley's. So maybe Potter was there too. But how was Draco supposed to know? He knew nothing.
He walked back to their room, where he spent most of the time, now that Hermione and Ron were together and happy and now that Harry had broken up with Ginny. Why did he break up with her anyways? Harry closed the door behind himself.
Harry rolled his eyes and ate the rest of his cookie. Malfoy copied him. Harry tried to figure out if Malfoy liked it, because his face didn't give anything away.
interest in her. And Draco had always thought some of his Quidditch teammates were quite alright to look at. Now it all made sense: the details Draco had noticed about Potter, Potter's muscles, the fact that Potter's smile made him weak in the knees, the feeling he'd had when they had kissed... Draco felt dizzy and couldn't get his fingers to move anymore, his gaze fixed on them resting on the keyboard.
"Is really everything alright?" She asked and Harry nodded, "You would tell us if it weren't, would you?"
"You sound so fucking hot when you're in pain," he whispered and licked Potter's earlobe, what made the boy wince.
And with that, the food was done. Harry whipped his wand and two plates and two sets of silverware flew to the couch table. Harry grabbed the pot and carried it to the table as well. He and Malfoy sat back down on the couch and Harry put food on each of their plates. When Malfoy took a bite, he looked at Harry with such satisfaction that Harry just had to laugh.
"Um, actually you can," Harry said, "Maybe you could check if Hermione is in her room and if she is you could send her to me? I would like to talk to her."
Draco asked for a bottle of fire whiskey, two elves brought him one each and Draco thanked them surprised.
Harry thought it was wonderful to stand in the Great Hall again. Student's voices filled the Hall and everyone sat down at their old tables. Harry, Ron and Hermione sat down at the Gryffindor table and started talking. Harry's eye caught silver hair shining on the other side of the Hall and he noticed that Malfoy sat next to Blaise Zabini. Harry looked around. He couldn't find any of Malfoy's other friends and he somehow felt a little sad. He had thought all of Malfoy's friends would return if they would have known that Malfoy would come back as well, but it seems like no one did. Only Zabini.
They gathered around the table, Harry sitting next to Teddy's high chair. Harry fed Teddy mashed carrots and simultaneously ate something himself. The atmosphere was less tense than Harry had expected but he knew that not everything was fine. Draco must have felt this as well, because he opened his mouth to say something.
Harry held his elbow out to Malfoy, but he just rolled his eyes. Harry furrowed his brow, unsure of what was going on.
Pressing silence filled the room. Mrs Weasley clapped a hand in front of her mouth and looked at her food. Draco looked around confused, but didn't say anything. In mere seconds, the whole atmosphere fell apart. George got up and left the table, Angelina hurrying after him. Mr Weasley rubbed his hand on his wife's back when she started to sob. Fleur went into the kitchen and brought Mrs Weasley a cup of tea. Bill, Percy and Charlie got up and consoled their mother as well, but Ginny and Ron watched the scene helplessly. Hermione took Ron's hand and Ron took Ginny's hand. Harry put his hand over theirs while Draco and Teddy watched them.
"You change too." Grunting annoyed, Malfoy closed the door to the library behind himself and Harry grabbed parchment and quill.
"Shit.", Draco cursed to himself. If he could see Potter's dreams, could potter see his? What happened here? Draco closed his eyes again and drifted off to sleep.
Harry kicked off his shoes and scrambled into his bed. Closing his eyes, he flinched the bridge of his nose. "Hermione is driving me crazy. She thinks everything and everyone is trying to kill me. Including you."
"He's at the hospital.", Draco said and suddenly many elves came stormed towards him and wanted to know if "Mister Harry Potter" would die and if he was alright and what happened to him and who they should curse, but Draco only smiled vaguely and said:
It was not completely true, because Harry's body felt like it was falling apart and he missed Draco and he had no idea what day they had.
He groaned against the mattress. Tomorrow he was going to be alone. All his friends were going home and Harry and Draco were going to stay. And Draco was angry at Harry, even though Harry had no idea why and-
I was given a five-minute break before she was bringing a dress in and forcing me in it. The dress was nude with silver. It was a long sleeve and off the shoulders and according to her it was conservative but still showed off my neck where a mating bit will one day be. She struggled to zip it which isn't surprising since she most likely had it made a size too small. When she deemed me ready I was being pulled out of my room downstairs to where my father was waiting.
Its been five months since the trial and three months since Draco finished school. He recently took over his father's business and now Narcissa and Lucius are happily in France. Draco and I live in Malfoy Manor and have been happy. I have been thinking recently that it was finally time to take the next step in our relationship.
"Yes well we need to do better," my mother shrieked, "We'll need to put more makeup on him. He will also need some more black dresses to hide all the fat he has."
"I promise," he said and brought his lips back to mine. While he kissed me a felt a finger circling my hole and soon it was dipping inside my body. It felt odd and the slick kept the pain away. Draco touched all over my body as he made sure I was ready to take his manhood. He slipped off his boxers and I saw the size of his cock for the first time. The thought of it entering my body was terrifying.
"I just needed to go for a walk," he sobbed. He slid down the wall and hugged his knees like a pathetic little baby.
"Draco," I said softly to get his attention as I walked towards him after closing the door behind me.
I covered my face in embarrassment as my parents sighed at the results. This whole thing is awful and I will tell Draco. I just wish he could take me away and keep me safe. I'm scared to fully trust him, but I feel so alone and want to leave. I really hope he proves himself to be different because I can feel myself slowly falling for him.
He was shocked to find a barely developed baby now dead in his lover's womb. This realization snapped him out of the rage and caused him to break down in tears. Feeling the guilt of killing his baby hurt him so bad that he slit his own throat and collapsed onto his brainwashed creature. The person he changed from an exciting adventuresome Omega to a submissive bitch. It seems Draco and Harry didn't get a happily ever after.
"You ready baby?" Draco asked me lovingly calming me slightly. I just nobbed and he lined himself up. He slowly began to enter and it felt like my body was being split in half.  The pain of it made me scream as he sunk all the way in and brought tears to my eyes.
People seem to ignore my existence and the horrible things he's done to me. Everything has been taken from me and no one cares. They act like I'm not human, like I don't have feelings, and I don't feel pain but I do. I feel everything he does to me and it hurts so bad. I know that someday he will get too angry and go to far and kill me. I'm just hoping that maybe if I write my side of the story someone will find it when I'm gone and miss me.
"He is not he has chub all over him," Lily said defensively as if defending her own body and not her sons.
"I think you will," I said looking up at him. "I want to trust you, but I'm scared. My own family can't be trusted and I barely know you."
They spent half the day in the common room. Hermione and Ron had had a little fight and everyone else stared at each other awkwardly, but then they had figured it all out and everything was fine. Hermione was studying for the next exam, that was over a week from then. But she said it would be very important to start a week beforehand. Ron didn't agree and Hermione made a snappy comment and then they started fighting again.
Without noticing the spy, Granger opened one of the books, but didn't even take a look on the page. The guy just started talking and she burst out giggling. "How come you are so funny?" She asked.
"Potter.", Draco said, "I don't care what you sound like, at least you tell me. Or are you afraid of the answer."
He was pretty sure that Malfoy wasn't going to come. The party was going on for about two hours already and if Malfoy wasn't here yet, he wasn't going to be here anymore.
"How long have you been awake last night?", he asked. Harry swallowed his juice and answered shortly:
They didn't eat dinner downstairs, Draco didn't want them to sit with his mother even though that was what he was here for - being with his mother. Harry hadn't spoken much since the shower earlier, he still didn't know if he should talk to Draco about his concerns. In the evening, when the entire Manor was quiet and Harry figured everyone was asleep, Harry and Draco sat in the small library and ate pudding.
Malfoy seemed like in a trance. He followed Harry with an empty look in his eyes and almost stumbled into two healers on their way, so Harry grabbed him by the shoulders and moved him forward until they reached Narcissa's room. Harry let go of Malfoy and looked at him with a worried look.
What did Potter care where he was going? Draco shook his head and left. In the library he sat down and continued reading the book in silence. After two hours, he knew that Muggles used things called
Harry swung his feet to the floor. His knees felt weak and Harry thought he might collapse. The room was cold and Harry didn't know what to do when he stood in front of Draco's bed.
Harry woke back up just at the break of dawn. He was glad to find Malfoy still lying next to him, already awake. Harry closed his eyes again and grinned.
"Narcissa Malfoy, his wife, is a wonderful woman. She told me so much." Potter pulled out a piece of paper and read out loud:
Harry couldn't help but look around curiously. Malfoy's bed was really big - there must fit three people in it. It was black wood, same as the giant closet, the desk, the small cupboard on which the cage stood and the door. Even though Harry didn't know why, he couldn't hold back a smile. The room was very tidy and neat and
"You do?" Draco breathed out in relief, "Oh, good. Well and I guess I'm sorry for treating you like this for all those years. And I'm really, really sorry for your godfather."
Hermione shook her head. "Nonsense. Ron's not doing anything either. I'm just glad I can do something for you."
"I just thought I'd be important enough for you to tell me who you're in love with, but it's alright.", she said and stormed away.
Malfoy opened his eyes again and nodded, but Harry wasn't convinced. He remembered a time when Malfoy wouldn't show his emotions to anyone even when he was at his personal limit, but now he sat here next to Harry and showed almost everything he was feeling.
It was easier said than done, but after half an hour or more, Harry felt his eyelids getting heavy. He yawned widely as he put away the album and closed his eyes, clearing his mind.
"Yes?" Malfoy said and stopped with a worried look on his face that made Harry want to hold him and tell him everything was going to be okay.
"Charming fella, isn't he?" Ron would always say and Lydia would always nod and smile at Harry. And when they left the store, Ron would always laugh about how big her crush on Harry is and Harry would roll his eyes but laugh too.
He caught speed and ran up the tower, ignored the confused people in the common room and stormed into his dorm. It was empty. But Harry heard the shower and banged against the bathroom door.
Potter laughed as well and shoved him away. When Teddy yawned and rubbed his eye, Fleur offered to pit him to bed. Potter and Draco said goodnight to him.
Hours and hours passed, the sun slowly set behind the Manor and coloured the sky in a beautiful pink. Harry still couldn't quite believe that he was actually here at Malfoy Manor, talking with Draco Malfoy about life. It was really nice and Harry could feel that Malfoy, too, thought so.
Harry nodded, but still wasn't quite listening. "This is crazy, isn't it? Don't you think it's crazy?"
"Be nice," Potter mouthed silently. Draco rolled his eyes, but he made an effort to be as nice as he could.
Harry placed a oft smile on his lips when Malfoy looked up at him. Harry felt a warm and strange feeling in his chest. The two boys looked at each other for a long time and
"GET! OUT!" Malfoy shouted even louder, so loud that Harry thought his friends in the common room must have heard it.
If the situation would have been different, Harry would have thought this was a beautiful scene to look at. Malfoy, the beautiful boy, his hair as silver as the glistening snow around them, walking around Hogwarts, his robe flying behing him in the wind. But this wasn't a good situation, and especially not one Harry wanted to remember.
The feeling was glorious and Draco moaned too loudly. Potter moaned in response, then pressed his lips to Draco's, not kissing him, just holding them against Draco's mouth, puffing hot breaths over it with each twitch of his hips.
When Draco stepped into the classroom, he found Granger looking at him with big eyes. Draco supposed Potter had told her.
Harry hurried out of the Hall, ignoring Malfoy and the others. As soon as he reached the first deserted corridor, he leaned against a wall, closed his eyes and breathed out. He wished that Malfoy would simply take Harry's hands from his face and look at him with his grey- STOP! Harry opened his eyes again, no Malfoy in sight, and he ran up to Gryffindor tower. He named the password and climbed inside. The common room was empty, no single person in here. Harry hurried upstairs and slammed the door behind him. He didn't even bother to undress, he just threw himself - face forward - onto his bed and breathed heavily. After a second or so, Harry screamed into his pillow, louder and longer than he had ever before. What was wrong with him?
Christmas holidays were about to begin tomorrow. Harry had not kissed Draco, nor did they wank off each other in the last one and a half week.
Narcissa nodded and turned her attention back to the pudding in front of her. Harry had already talked to Mrs Weasley and he wasn't going to change his mind. He didn't know Narcissa too well to trust her with Teddy, who was Harry's everything.
Harry lay his hand on Ron's shoulder and looked at him. "You two belong together. I am sure you will work something out. I'll go and talk to Hermione. Perhaps she's the same opinion and you just need to talk," Harry offered and Ron smiled.
Malfoy was acting even stranger than the rest of them. When Harry let him in that evening, Malfoy didn't look directly at him. He also dodged Harry's kiss and pretended he had to untie his shoe. Harry had a strange feeling in his gut, but he decided to ignore it - for now. When the sun set, the four took the Floo Network to the Burrow. There were five hours left until midnight.
Harry looked at the Slyhterin and suddenly realised that this was his first ever contact with Muggle technology. Harry grinned.
"So I decided for our honeymoon we would go to France, visit Paris and stop on Hawaii." Harry couldn't hold back a laugh.
"I have already borrowed the book and I'm going to read it this evening," Hermione told Harry while she put some potatoes on her plate and started eating them.
"Well we've been to Hogsmeade a few times and we did our homework together in the Great Hall and stuff. You know, we did all kinds of crap," Blaise told him and suddenly started laughing.
Harry smiled back and Malfoy vanished into the bathroom. As soon as the door closed, Harry jumped out of bed, took a deep breath to stop the pain, and walked over to the bedside table. Harry knew now not to touch it. Instead, he took out his wand and tried every spell that came into his mind. Nothing worked. Maybe Hermione would know what to do. Harry sent his patronus and hoped it would reach her in time before Malfoy would get out of the shower.
The other three wizards Draco didn't know greeted Potter as well and every one of them gave Draco and his mother dirty looks.
"I'm proud of you, Harry." Hagrid said just before the door opened and everyone in the Hall turned their faces to look at them.
. Harry gently touched down on the ground in front of Malfoy, who stepped on his cigarette to put it out.
Harry couldn't hold back a laugh as he put on his trousers, that lay three feet away from him. Malfoy looked like he wanted to vanish into thin air right at that moment. They both didn't feel like eating breakfast right now, so after checking with Ron, they went to bed. Harry opened the window in his room to let in some cold, fresh air. They cuddled up next to each other and pulled the blanket up to their chins. Harry breathed in the crisp air and smiled. He was sort of glad he could experience
"We sat together and he told me his ideas and I told him mine and that's what came out of it." George said with a wide grin.
"He should be fine, but we need him to stay here for one more day and then he needs to be on at least a week of bedrest. The rest will be discussed when he will be released tomorrow." The first healer Harry stumbled across told him.
Madame Pince stood on a shelf and checked a book. One table, far in the back, was filled with three students. Draco was relieved. He sneaked closer, hoping not to be noticed.
Harry didn't want to see or hear Draco and his father arguing, but if he would go between them, one of the three would get hurt.
Potter stopped moving and opened his eyes widely while their lips were still attached to each other. "Slower, please." Draco said and gasped for air. Potter raised his eyebrow mockingly and grinned.
Hermione sighed. "You know, Fynn seemed so nice and he was funny and smart and I really enjoyed studying with him. That was all. We never met to do anything else but study. And I never even imagined doing
When Harry took his hands away from his ears Malfoy lay quietly in his bed. That bastard. Harry shivered. He thought about all the hexes he could use on Malfoy until he drifted off to sleep.
"Then we went to the dance floor." He said "You had asked me and I was bloody amazed by the way you danced. So smooth and elegant but cool and free at the same time."
Malfoy looked annoyed. He rolled his eyes, but finally gave in and put his arms into the sleeves of the jacket. Harry was stunned. Malfoy looked- he looked- good? His pale hand holding the cigarette stuck between his pale pink lips, a strand of his silver hair was loose and falling over his eye, and the leather jacket...
Draco moaned loudly and came into Potter's mouth. Potter sucked and licked until Draco whimpered from the stimulation on his over-sensitive cock.
"Really good. I'm actually thinking about inviting her to spend Christmas with me and my grandmother," Neville told him proudly.
Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Theo arrived at around eight p.m. at the pub. Out on the street Draco could already hear the music and he knew he didn't want to go in there. He figured he didn't have much of a choice when Blaise pushed him towards the entrance.
Neville looked between the two of them with a questioning look. Harry shrugged. The door banged open and Malfoy stepped in.
After a second, he came back, pressed a kiss onto Harry's lips and smiled. Then, he left. Harry lay there and couldn't stop himself from grinning.
They didn't talk for the rest of their lunch. Harry was annoyed about himself that he didn't knew what was going on inside him.
Harry felt horrible. He was way too tired to argue right now and didn't want to upset Hermione. He stared into his coffee mug and avoided eye contact with Hermione, but Harry could still feel her and Ron looking at him. They sat on a bench in their garden and enjoyed the morning sun.
They all held their newspapers under Harry's nose, open was the article about him defeating Voldemort. He smiled, but secretly wished Hermione was here to shoo them all away. He took the pen that another witch gave him and signed all four Daily Prophets.
"There was this archway and Bellatix had hit him with a curse and Sirius fell and he fell behind the curtains and he vanished out if sight and..." Potter's eyes were filled with tears.
"You should probably know that being with me means you would have to deal with stuff like that a lot more often. I mean I'm in a damn lot of articles in the /Daily Prophet/ and they are going to talk to you too. Or watch you. Or take pictures. You'll never be safe of them when you're with me." Harry said.
"I wanted- God, it sounds so stupid, but I was wondering why-", Harry swallowed, "Why you kissed so good. I mean, you must have practised..."
"I don't get what you're so upset about," Harry said, but immediately realized what a stupid thing this was to say.
Harry felt a tear escaping his eye and wiped it away with his free hand, not letting go of Malfoy's. McGonagall took a deep breath before she spoke her next sentence.
It was now a day before Potter's birthday and Draco hadn't written him since the incident. Draco just had no idea what to say and it seemed neither did Potter, because Draco hadn't heard from him either. He rolled around in his bed, burying his face into his pillow and sighed. How did it come to this? Why was he being so whiny? Draco took a vague guess that maybe he cherished Potter's friendship more than he'd thought. But was it a friendship? They met a few times, that was it. But on the other hand they'd talked for hours in the diner and Draco didn't even think about being bored. Draco had decided he would stay in his room until he found what bothered him so much.
Hermione's partner was as much a secret as Harry's was. At seven o'clock, they abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. Harry, Seamus, Neville and Ron dressed into their robes. Harry wore black ones and a bow tie. His hair was still a mess, but not as much as usual. They walked downstairs. The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colours instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Ron at the foot of the stairs.
He jumped out of bed and got dressed as fast as he could. He didn't look in the mirror, all that mattered was to get to Potter in time.
"Do you even listen to yourself? The door is locked. That means something. You can't just waltz into someone's
"Well that has never happened before," Potter said and laughed. Draco couldn't help himself and he joined in.
"I know it's not the best smell but I've done the potion right so you can drink it.", he assured him.
Harry raised his eyebrows. Nott had left with three girls at once and Malfoy didn't even want to make out with one that threw herself at him? Curious. He looked at Malfoy and saw that he wanted to say something, but held himself back. So Harry smiled and tried to encourage him.
"I want to say it, I really do, but I'm drunk, so I won't. I don't want you to think I said it just because of the alcohol." He whispered into Harry's ear.
Draco sighed happily as he woke up, finding Potter's hair tickling his nose and Potter's head on Draco's chest.
When the bell rung midnight, Draco sobbed and tried to sleep, but every time he closed his eyes all he could see was Potter. He had looked so hurt and betrayed. Draco had used to love seeing Potter hurt, Draco had always used to wish he was the one to hurt Potter. He didn't know what had changed, but he knew
He too didn't think it was possible, but being here, away from the drawing room and the dungeon, it was actually pretty alright. Harry finished his food and got up to look at all of the books Malfoy had in here. There were a lot of books by Gilderoy Lockhart, but of course Harry knew none of them were actually about his own experience. There were also a lot of books about magical creatures, some of which Harry had already heard of and some of which Harry had no idea about.
He has been lying in his bed for merely two minutes when the door opened and Potter stepped into their dorm. Draco ignored him and kept reading his magazine.
"Neville asked me if we wanted to join them all and come to this new pub that opened somewhere in London. Why don't we go there and maybe at the end of the night you can decide if you think it's a good idea to invite her."
"Well, Hermione, I go to see Draco. I haven't seen him since he escaped this morning.", Harry said and smiled.
Draco rolled his eyes again and lit a cigarette before he started to talk. "It was fine. I got there, everyone stared, Potter was happy that I came, I smoked almost a pack of cigarettes, we left the pub at three, I fell asleep on his couch and then I had breakfast with his idiot friends."
So Theo and Blaise left after lunch and told Draco not to do anything stupid. He only rolled his eyes and shut the door. Draco bewitched the walking stick to stand in one place and went to his room to pick out some clothes. Luckily, Draco's wardrobe was big enough to have several outfits, but his really good clothes were at Malfoy Manor. Draco thought for a second, then limped back to the living room and took the Floo Network to his mother's.
"No problem, I love doing this. He's awesome." Ron replied and Harry laughed, what made Teddy laugh, what made Ron laugh.
After dinner, Malfoy even whipped his wand to put the pizza boxes into the trash. He and Harry went upstairs and got to bed, so did Ron. He was still a little uncomfortable with the situation, but Harry was glad he did everything to hide it and keep a smile on his face.
"So..." Draco broke the silence between them, but didn't know what to say. At least he got Potter's attention. "How's life going?"
The night went on and the more often Harry and Malfoy went outside for Malfoy to have a cigarette, the colder and darker the night got. A lot of Harry's friends had planned something fun for the night. Seamus and Dean thought it would be fun to play "Truth or Drink". And of course, Harry had to be the first one to get on stage for this stupid game, but luckily he should bring another friend to play with him. So Harry took Ron.
Draco nodded and grabbed the prick, moved his hand up and down and sucked the tip of the enormous penis that could barely fit in his hand.
He watched Malfoy closely as the waitress reached their table and set the steak in front of Malfoy, clearly showing her cleavage.
After a short while, the train started to roll and Harry leaded back. He was heading home. "I haven't slept all night because I was thinking of Teddy." Harry told Hermione, Ron was already asleep.
"But, I mean- Do you... do you like me?", Harry asked and blushed even harder, but Draco only smiled.
Back in his dorm room, Harry found that Malfoy was in the shower. He had locked the door carefully and took his pyjamas with him. Harry smirked and shook his head. Obviously Malfoy didn't want to happen again that he had to walk out naked because she forgot his pyjama or a towel. But why? After what they have done today...
"It's just-" Draco swallowed thickly, "I've been raised differently. I learned things differently. But I don't want to put all the blame on my upbringing, I know I myself am responsible for most of it."
"Yes. You didn't expect Ron to cry? Well me neither, but he did. He just sat here five minutes ago and talked to me," Harry told Hermione.
"I love you more, Draco Malfoy.", Harry whispered and rolled to his side as well and looked Draco in the eyes.
Then, he had an idea. Draco grabbed a quill and a piece of parchment that lay on a shelf and he sat down on the floor and started writing.
"You know, Hermione, Harry loves him and I think you should respect that. And besides, Malfoy doesn't seem this bad when he had someone he loves.", Ron said and shrugged.
Harry, Hermione and Ron met at Platform 9 ¾ and brought their stuff on the train right away. They sat down in their compartment and started telling each other everything they had done during the holidays. Okay, maybe not
Potter answered him by sliding his hands over Draco's back, lower and lower until they reached bare skin.
"Haven't I already told you that you shouldn't be sorry for every shit?", Draco asked and winked. Potter rolled his eyes.
"I'll stay here and help you." Luna said to Ron with a soft smile on her face. She then turned to Harry. "Let us know if we can do anything. Now hurry."
"Okay Harry, your birthday is one week from now." Hermione stated at breakfast as if Harry didn't know it himself.
"Why did you take Dreamless Sleep?", Potter asked after they lay there for a long time, not talking. Draco looked at him. He didn't think he was ready to tell Potter this.
Harry dragged himself into the living room where Ron and Hermione sat and ate their breakfast. Even though Harry had already said that he wasn't hungry, a slice of toast was waiting for him. They were hoping he would at least have a bite. But he didn't. Only looking at the food made Harry's stomach clench. He swallowed thickly and opened the door to the terrace because the smell of sausage and egg was starting to make him feel nauseous.
It was an amazing evening. The whole Weasley family and their spouses were together and their friends joined as well - Seamus, Dean, Neville and Luna. Malfoy's friends came over as well, two hours before midnight. Draco vanished with them into his and Harry's tent and Harry was happy they were feeling welcomed here. Hermione showed Pansy around and introduced her to the people she didn't already know. Harry noticed a slight scowl here and there, but he grinned at the suppression. Draco, Theo and Blaise walked through the dark grounds and talked about something Harry didn't know about. He was too busy with the others to be bothered by that.
Or at least he thought he had said it. The people around him didn't seem to understand him. Someone picked him up and looked him deep in the eyes. Harry started crying.
"He is hoping to help the children that have the horror of growing up without parents, and wants them to find a family that loves them no matter what, just like he found one in his friends at Hogwarts."
When the three entered the Hall, everyone stared at them. Draco cleared his throat, but Longbottom and Weasley didn't seem to care. They kept walking and made their way to the Gryffindor table. As soon as Draco started walking again, the rest of the students turned their attention back to their food and own conversations. Longbottom and Weasley sat down with their friends at the Gryffindor table.
"You can try to hate me as long as you wish, but Malfoy, I promise you one thing: I will always be there, as your enemy or as your friend. I will be there," Harry said quietly and now Malfoy started to cry. He really cried. In front of Harry! Harry felt this was the beginning of the wall Malfoy had built around himself slowly breaking down.
Harry chuckled. Ron got up and looked at Harry with a big smile. Harry flushed. He was ready. Hermione came dashing through the doors, her beautiful violet dress flowing behind her.
"And Pansy", Nott smiled, "Don't worry about her. She's just jealous because now she's sure that Draco could never like her, now that he has you."
She didn't say anything else, instead she brought a stool and the Sorting Hat and the Sorting began. Draco didn't pay any attention. He asked himself how they were going to do it with the rooms for all of the eight years. There were not enough Slytherin eighth years to give them their own common room. Were they going to sleep with the others in their old common room? But that would leave the other houses way too crowded. After the sorting, Draco noticed that house Slytherin was extended by only two children. He sighed.
"No, Draco, I do." Harry stopped him, took another deep breath and continued. "I lost Sirius in fifth year. I was too small to remember when I lost my parents, but I was fifteen when I lost my godfather. I will never forget that. I will never forget his face when he got hit by that spell and fell through the Veil."
"Get out!", Draco said annoyed. Potter snickered, kissed Draco on his neck and left the room, closing the door behind him quietly.
When Harry arrived, it seemed like the three have just fought, because they fell silent immediately. He decided to ignore it. The whole Weasley family stormed into the living room and hugged Harry, Ron and Hermione. Draco was greeted by a handshake from most of them, only Mrs Weasley hugged him. Harry smiled.
Draco did so and smiled. There was a picture of the woman and the man dancing together. It seemed like it was Autumn. The woman laughed happily and the man kissed her.
His lips opened against Potter's, his tongue sliding like honey, and Potter tried to hold on, to make it last, but his body was already flooding with pleasure. He groaned into Draco's mouth, coming and coming until he was shaking with it, and Draco kissed him all through it and then pushed him down onto the pillows to kiss him some more.
Ron looked at Neville with wide eyes. He was just as overwhelmed with the situation as Neville himself was.
"Malfoy! Open the door!" Harry said loudly and knocked at the door. There was no answer so Harry shouted again.
It was a crazy feeling for Harry to go to bed with Draco Malfoy while his godson slept in the crib next to them. And when Teddy woke up in the middle of the night, Draco stopped Harry from getting up and took care of Teddy himself. Harry watched Malfoy sitting down on the bed and rocking Teddy back and forth until he fell asleep again. An even crazier feeling was waking up and getting downstairs to find Ron and Draco in the kitchen making breakfast while Teddy played in his high chair.
"You two already go, I need to check something.", Harry said. Hermione and Ron looked at each other.
"I don't know how often. He brought you up here, you know.", Hermione answered and pulled a strand of bushy hair behind her ear.
He lay awake for a while, thinking about how he got here. Not physically, but mentally. Draco thought about how he smiled at Potter, how he fell asleep next to Potter, how he missed Potter when he wasn't around, how he loved Potter's laugh and how he couldn't stand not talking to Potter. Then Draco realized that tomorrow was the day Potter was allowed to get back to their dorm, what meant that all of his friends were going to come and pick him up. Draco supposed they would get him when they left, but he thought they wouldn't be too happy to find him already being there, sleeping next to their best friend. After all, they weren't too happy when Potter had only
"She denies it. Everything. Tells me she didn't want anything to happen with him but his arm wrapped around her she couldn't explain," Ron answered.
They went outside again and sat down in the sun. They put cooling and sun blocking charms on themselves and leaned back. Hermione opened one of the books she'd bought at Flourish and Blotts, she was already halfway through. Ron closed his eyes and enjoyed the sun. Harry put on headphones, listened to music and also closed his eyes.
"I know what this is." She started whining again and Ron rolled his eyes. "It's a brand new edition from
, his eyes widened. His beautiful, big, shining green eyes looked at Draco. And that was the moment when Draco discovered a whole different side of himself. A side he had never even dared to approach. Draco leaned down to Potter's ear.
"Of course, we had been here for one and a half hours, I don't get drunk that quickly." Malfoy said.
"That seems about right." Malfoy said, looking at the men again. "Like James Bond." He added under his breath and Harry smiled.
Harry only nodded and smiled. He was glad that Hermione was so understanding and supportive. Harry didn't want to hide anything from Ron and he guessed Hermione knew that, but Harry also just wanted Malfoy to be comfortable. Hermione broke the spell and quietly left the room. She closed the living room door so Harry and Malfoy wouldn't hear her putting on her shoes and leaving the house.
"What's wrong with you? Just because you have a crush on me, I'm not responsible for you being a bitch!", Draco shouted back.
"Don't worry about me. I'll just go and pretend that I don't exist so you can talk shit about me," he said and left for his room.
Harry nodded even though he was very far from alright. Luckily, Draco didn't buy it and he took Harry's hands and kissed them. Harry smiled tiredly. He loved it when Malfoy called him
But Potter grabbed Draco's shoulder. In one movement, Draco grabbed Potter's hand, pulled it off his shoulder, turned around and held his wand at Potter's throat.
Harry had even suggested that they could tell his friends first and the Malfoy family later. Malfoy had then said, "I just don't know what exactly to say. I don't want to tell your friends just now and I don't want to tell my parents
"Harry, I want you to know that you are the first person Draco ever brought here.", Narcissa said and looked at him.
Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonnagal told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs, and follow her. She stopped in mid-sentence, as her eyes fell on Draco.
Draco sighed and stared at the letter he had gotten yesterday. He had decided to stay in his room until he figured out what to do. And that could take a long time.
Now, Draco looked at them with an even colder look than any of these girls could ever have managed. Year-long exercise. But before Draco could answer, he heard a familiar voice from behind him and breathed out relieved.
A low moan rumbled in Potter's chest the chest Draco could feel pressed snugly to his own, and Draco's toes curled, his limbs liquefying and head spinning.
"Because... Potter, you can't-", before Draco had ended the sentence, the door swung open and Parkinson stood in the door.
tell Ron. It wasn't that Malfoy cared so much that he wanted Ron to know so Hermione didn't get the chance to cheat. Suddenly Harry figured something out. Malfoy had a crush on Hermione! Harry looked around. He couldn't find Malfoy anywhere, he must have eaten before Harry and the others came into the hall.
"Potter, you don't want to be seen with this scum.", the brown haired girl said and the others laughed mean.
But before anything else could be said from any of them, the first girl pulled out her wand and pointed it at Draco's chest.
"Morning mother." Draco said as he walked in. His mother looked up, tried to smile and nodded. Draco sat down and started eating while his mother got dressed. After breakfast, they left the house and Draco blew a whistle. His owl flew right towards him and gently sat down on his shoulder. And they left.
Draco heard a shriek from the girls and they ran away. He was confused and everything had happened so fast, but Draco now realised what had happened.
"Come to the lake. Midnight.", Malfoy said and without waiting for Harry to say another word, he left.
His enjoyment was given a cruel edge by the unwelcome thought of Potter being like this with anybody but him.
Harry furrowed his brow. What was going on in there? Did they know he was awake and wanted to fool him? Were they really getting along? If they were - and Harry hoped so - it would be best they didn't know Harry knew about this. Smiling, he sneaked back upstairs and crawled back into bed.
"She was murdered by a death eater.", Harry told him. Malfoy didn't answer. The room was quiet again.
"HOW DARE YOU? HOW CAN YOU FALL INTO MY BACK JUST LIKE THIS? DON'T YOU UNDERTAND WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE? DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY, YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS!"
On the second picture were two girls and a man. The man was around twenty years old and had black hair. The younger one of the girls was around five years old. She had blonde hair and was as pale as a vampire. And the other one was around ten, had blackhair and the same pale skin. Draco smiled.
Malfoy's eyes hushed over Harry's face and Harry nodded slowly to reinforce his statement. Malfoy nodded understanding. Harry turned around and noticed that this was not a good idea because now their chests were touching. Harry wanted to take a step back but hit the sink with his coccyx. Malfoy smirked.
Draco fixed his hair. When he opened the door Potter said, "Remember when I told you you should learn to get dressed in the bathroom or I will see your dick hanging around? Well now you-"
"You are one of the strongest people I know." Harry said, "And you have proven that more than enough."
"I'm afraid Arthur will run a little late", She informed Harry when he asked where Mr Weasley was, "There's still a lot to do at the ministry."
"Stop looking at me like this," Draco said and shook his head. Potter just smiled even more and started laughing. It was really catchy, so Draco smiled as well. Potter stopped and pointed at Draco with a surprised expression.
And then Ron came downstairs. Harry and Malfoy were in the kitchen and magically put the food on a tray, while Hermione was still on the terrace. Harry paid close attention to Ron's reaction. Ron's eyes widened and his jaw dropped before he could bring himself to say a word. Harry saw that Malfoy looked more angry than scared - more than Harry had thought he would be. So hidden behind the counter, Harry grabbed Malfoy's hand. Malfoy looked at Harry with a surprised look, but Harry just smiled lightly and looked back at Ron.
Harry leaned back and Draco sat up and pulled him down so Harry sat in his lap. Harry breathed heavily. When he felt Draco touching his hand, he felt calmness rushing from his fingertips through his whole body. Harry opened his eyes again and everything was blurry, he wiped the tears out of his eyes. Draco looked at him with hurt grey eyes.
Draco did as he was told and carefully lay Potter down. Madame Pomfrey came hurried to them and gave Potter a strange looking potion. Draco didn't want to ask what potion this was.
He ignored Draco completely, what was totally in his liking. Potter piled his books on the table and started doing his homework. Draco sat down on his bed and read a Quidditch magazine. It was strange that the two boys could be in one room without fighting, insulting or something.
So Harry dragged Draco upstairs and shoved him into his bedroom. This was not how he had imagined Draco to land in his bed.
The Hall was filled with chatting and laughing people when the newly weds came inside. The light was dim, the music loud and the atmosphere amazing. Malfoy and Harry were hugged and congratulated by a lot of people. The Weasley's were over the moon about everything and everyone. The groomsmen looked dashing in their suits and the girls- wow. Hermione, Luna and Pansy looked fantastic - the dresses caught everyone's eye.
Draco rolled onto his back and Harry lay down upon him. Harry lay his head on Draco's chest and smiled.
Neville and Luna came by their place at around six p.m. They sat outside for a bit until it got rather chilly and Luna and Hermione wanted to go back inside. They talked for quite a while. After the boys had finished their beer, they set off to the pub where they would meet the rest of the group. Ginny, Dean and Seamus were already waiting.
"You two are ridiculous." Hermione said, shaking her head. "I mean it. Can't you just pull yourself together and do it?"
Everyone raised their glasses and clapped something against it, signaling they want Harry and Draco to kiss. Harry shrugged with a grin and pressed a kiss on Draco's lips. The crowd cheered and Draco smiled widely.
The lift came and they stepped inside. Teddy pressed the button again and the witch pressed another one. Harry watched her out of the corner of his eye, but didn't say anything or even turned her head a bit in her direction. Unfortunately, she didn't get the hint and asked why Teddy was
"Harry Potter, our saviour, was in a tragic accident two weeks ago. We waited for the results of his injuries until we published the article. Being the hero he is, Harry Potter is also a centre of spite and jealousy, two reasons for the accident. It happened on a Tuesday during a fight between two fellow students. Potter wanted to end the fight, got hit by a spell and had to stay in the Hogwarts hospital wing for two weeks. When Harry Potter was released from the hospital wing, we hired a student to interview Potter on his health and following process of getting better. Something that was not expected, was one person carrying Potter out of the hospital wing."
Draco laughed. Pansy was his best friend and he could tell her everything, but telling her about him and Potter was not the best idea.
He found his room deserted, but the shower was running. Harry smirked and slipped out of his clothes. Naked, he opened the door to the bathroom and stepped in.
Harry looked at the owls in the cages and suddenly missed Hedwig a lot. No owl could ever replace her and Harry somehow wanted her to know that. He finally decided to go with a light brown owl with kind eyes. Ron seemed rather jealous when Harry paid for it.
Before Harry could answer to this, Seamus, Dean and Neville fell down next to Harry and Ron. Seamus dropped his notebook on the table and looked at Harry.
Harry didn't answer. Was Malfoy being jealous? He couldn't stop his grin from widening. This was so amazing! Harry couldn't yet figure out why, but it just was.
"I was a big fan of the Chudley Cannons years ago, but currently I'm more of a fan of Wimbourne Wasps."
"How did you find out?", Hermione asked. Ron looked at Harry, who gave him with one look the permission to tell Hermione.
closer. Harry heard Malfoy moan quietly into his mouth and it was such an incredible sound that made Harry feel all kinds of things and he desperately wanted to hear it again. So Harry started to move his body against Malfoy's, slowly moving Malfoy's hips in the same rhythm. Malfoy's moan was louder this time and Harry's heart skipped a beat. Malfoy put his hands into Harry's hair and tugged at it a little, what resulted in a moan slipping out of Harry's mouth.
Draco opened his eyes widely. He looked at Blaise who looked just as horrified as Draco must have looked himself.
Harry and Ron laughed. They joined the rest of the staff and went into the Great Hall. This year, since McGonagall was headmistress now, it was Professor Rubeus Hagrid who was Head of Gryffindor, Professor Slughorn was pronounced Head of Slytherin after Snape's death. The Headmistress sat down in the middle of the long table and Harry was told to sit next to her, Ron next to him. Harry felt weird but honoured to sit at the staff table, facing the pupils. He and Ron couldn't stop grinning as the doors to the Great Hall opened and the students came inside, a lot of whom gasped when they saw Harry and Ron. The ghosts of Hogwarts flew through the Hall and Sir Nicholas -
Harry was glad that Ron and Hermione consciously avoided asking about what had happened at Hogsmeade. Instead they talked about upcoming exams and lessons. But Harry couldn't get his mind off Malfoy. What was going on?
As though aware of Potter looks, Draco's cock twitched a little and began to thicken. Potter bit his lip and Draco noticed Potter and himself blushing even more. Potter didn't move, he licked his lips and stared at Draco's prick. He seemed paralysed.
Harry walked over there. The blankets smelled like honey and cinnamon. Harry wondered where the smell was coming from... from Malfoy obviously not, given the fact that the git smelled like mint and citrus.
Harry smiled sadly. He knew there were many things Malfoy and Harry's friends had to clear up, but Harry couldn't expect Malfoy to do this right now.
Harry rolled his eyes and shoved Malfoy's shoulder. As they reached the foot of the steps they stopped and simultaneously pulled out their wands to cast drying spells, for the second time that day, but it helped little to nothing. Their clothes were too wet now to be dried by a simple spell. Malfoy groaned annoyed and cast another spell that did just as little as the one before.
They had reached the common room. The floor was covered with a carpet that showed the blazon of Hogwarts. Some pictures were hanging on the walls, but there were mostly empty frames for pictures the students themselves wanted to hang up from their time at Hogwarts so that the common room was getting filled with their own memories. Harry loved the idea a lot.
. I understand that you don't want to keep a secret from them, but I wish we could give it a bit more time. Just a tiny little bit more."
"How do you plan on spending the next weeks?" Another question was asked. The "interviewer" asked next question as if Draco wasn't right there to hear everything, "What is Malfoy doing here?"
He wanted to like them at least for Potter - Alright, Draco admitted it, it was ridiculous to still call him Potter, but it was a habit.
When Harry woke up, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. When he raised himself to look around, the pain increased and his eyes started watering. Harry found himself in the hospital wing. In the distance, he could hear voices. He wasn't sure if it was Madame Pomfrey or someone else, but when they got closer, Harry knew it wasn't Madame Pomfrey.
He slightly shook his head to make these thoughts go away. Everyone of Potter's group was already busy with their own things. Except for Granger who was talking to Potter. Draco walked past them, slightly touched Potter's hand and left the common room, hoping Potter would follow. And he did. Before they reached the door, Potter grabbed Draco's shoulders and followed Draco inside.
Of course, he could understand that Malfoy wasn't comfortable with being around Harry's friends, especially when they
"But, you know", Malfoy said quietly and looked down at his hands, "I don't even remotely stand a chance."
Potter tasted like sweets, and his tongue slid so sensually against Draco's, it was impossible not to melt into the kiss. Draco's hands flew to Potter's waist, desperate for support, because he was beginning to feel dizzy. He tilted his head sideways, pressing his cheek into Potter's warm palm, and opened his mouth fully, welcoming Potter's intrusion by sucking gently on his tongue.
Draco nodded desperately and Potter's fingers slid down immediately, wrapping themselves around Draco's cock, their touch cool.
Harry pulled his both hands in Draco's soft blonde hair and messed them up, just like he did it with his.
Then the bell rang once again. Harry looked at the clock and figured this had to be Molly. He opened the door and indeed found Molly with Teddy in her arms. She hugged Harry and when she did, over his shoulder she saw Malfoy standing at the end of the hallway.
After looking around and adjusting to the atmosphere in the room, Harry opened the closet doors and found that everything inside was dark as well. Black or nearly black shirts and socks, black suits, black robes. Harry guessed he didn't have to search long for something to wear. He pulled out a dark green longsleeve and black trousers. Harry grabbed socks in the same shade as the top, but he didn't dare look inside the underwear drawer.
Harry grinned and winked at her. She knew what she was doing. Just when Harry wanted to ask if they should go downstairs again, Ron came into the room.
"Minister, Mr Lucius Malfoy had been a Death Eater, but he didn't have a choice. He was scared and remains until this day." Potter said.
It turned out Draco didn't even need Harry's clothes after all. They had sneaked back to Harry's room after the quick shower, that has been more kissing than actual showering, and undressed immediately after the door was locked. They did what they hadn't done with each other before, what made Harry feel exhilarated and amazed. Now they lay in Harry's bed, wearing only boxershorts and socks, legs intertwined. Malfoy traced his fingers over Harry's scars.
Harry watched Draco with curiosity, but he seemed more relaxed than Harry felt, though his hand was gripping the silver head of the snake tightly. Harry was sure of this, but he couldn't hold back his excitement. Neither did Hagrid, because after McGonagall's first sentence, he started weeping.
Harry stared at him. Draco's hair shone in the light of the fire and his grey eyes sparkled. Harry couldn't believe this was happening. And if that hadn't been enough, Draco went down on one knee and pulled out a tiny box from his coat pocket. Harry clapped a hand in front of his mouth.
Harry figured her question was appropriate, considering Harry and Malfoy's history and Harry sitting there with red eyes and weeping. Harry shook his head even though Malfoy
"Shut up, Potter. Just because we were it doesn't mean everyone has to know it.", Draco had answered and had left Potter standing in the middle of the corridor.
"I LOVE HIM!", Harry heard Draco shout, before he and Narcissa rounded a corner and were out of earshot. Harry followed her upstairs. She led him into a neat room.
Harry started to laugh and Malfoy joined in. They sat on the bed, both naked, and laughed for quite a while. Draco pulled out some of Harry's clothes from the closet and put them on, making sure he looked good. Whem he had his final outfit (Harry had finished way earlier), Harry handed him his leather jacket.
"She was crazy! She hurt Hermione and all of us and you didn't do anything! You didn't have the guts to do anything! They held us here, Luna, Ron and myself!" Harry felt his cheeks heating up and his hands were trembling with fury.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I'll take him upstairs and as soon as he's asleep I'll bring Teddy back downstairs."
"Well..." Harry didn't want to tell her about Malfoy, "It's going really well, too. I even made friends with someone very unlikely."
"Why?" Ron asked with a confused look, what changed into a horrified one very quickly, "Is it some kind of anniversary today? Did I forget about something?"
"Tomorrow." He told himself and closed his eyes. He could see the silhouette of Hogwarts in front of him and fell asleep.
!" He clapped a hand on his mouth the second he realised what he'd just said. Potter froze in mid-action.
The year was over, the Tournament was over, Cedric was... And Voldemort was back. When the Hogwarts express arrived at platform 9 3/4, Harry and Draco took their trunks, Harry took Hedwig's cage and they left the train.
Draco looked out of the window. The sky was already dark and snow was falling. He decided to write his parents back before Potter's pack was leaving. So he grabbed quill and paper from the shelf, sat down at the table and started writing.
And after he fought with Potter, he ran up here and broke together on the floor crying. Draco sighed. Why did Potter make him so sad but so happy as well?
Dean clapped into his hands and Seamus groaned and passed him a galleon. And now, Harry knew why they were asking questions.
"Wouldn't he? And you know that from...?", Draco asked with two raised eyebrows. Granger narrowed her eyes.
Draco turned his head back to Theo, but before he could say anything, he was pulled into the dancing and sweating crowd.
They had decided to go flying because the weather that day was astonishingly good. The Malfoys' garden was huge and as Harry and Draco had reached the point from where they could kick off perfectly, Harry was a bit out of breath already.
Draco took his hand, what made a few in the common room gasp and whisper, and the two if them walked down into the dungeons. Harry already knew the way to the Slytherin common room. Draco named the password and dragged Harry inside. The common room looked just like it did two years ago when, Harry and Ron went in there incognito. Draco led Harry to the dormitories and opened a black wooden door. His dorm room was empty.
"See, I told you it will be alright." Hermione interrupted Harry smiling, but fell silent again as Ron shushed her because he wanted to hear the rest of the letter.
look better than when they last saw each other. Of course, Harry suspected, during the war everyone had looked horrible - it had been a war after all. Harry remembered Malfoy's pale frightened face and his shaking scrawny hands. Malfoy had always been pale and thin, but back then it was a whole other level. He had looked like he hadn't slept or eaten in months.
Harry swallowed and his heart beat faster. Blood was running into his head. The three of them stood there frozen. Ron was about to faint, Draco was about to faint and Harry could faint twice.
In the evening, they visited the Weasley family and enjoyed Mrs Weasley's homemade dinner. I was delicious - as always - and made Harry not miss the food at Hogwarts, though it was really tasteful as well.
"Love me tender, love me sweet. Never let me go. You have made my life complete. And I love you so. Love me tender, love me true. All my dreams fulfilled. For my darling I love you. And I always will."
" Hermione asked and unlike Pansy, Hermione wasn't really happy to hear that and Harry knew exactly why.
They stepped in the dining room. Mrs Malfoy and Draco's friends looked at them. Mr Malfoy, on the other hand, glared at Draco.
"I know he is my son! Stop telling me this like I am a child! Narcissa, if you are not on my side, you can leave. Get out of my sight! Right now!", Mr Malfoy shouted angrily.
Harry put Teddy back in his crib and sat back down on the bed. "They know. But they also know what happened yesterday."
"No. No, he didn't.", Harry said and watched Professor Sprout, who stood in front of the class. She smiled and began with her lesson.
When the tea was ready, Harry sat on the opposite of Malfoy at the table and they started sipping their drinks.
Harry and Draco lay in Harry's bed, facing each other and waiting for the bells to stop. As they did, Harry looked into the wonderful grey eyes of Draco.
The pleasure built steadily, spreading from his crotch down to his toes and up to his chest, pulling Draco upward with one long spasm. It held him in a tight grip for a long moment, then released him with a force that left him breathless.
"Thanks, idiot." Malfoy said and before Harry could answer, Malfoy pressed his lips against Harry's.
Maybe he shouldn't have done it, he thought on his way back home. He didn't want anything from Lydia, even though she was rather pretty and not quite as old as Harry. And as Hermione couldn't say enough, Harry should really consider having a girlfriend now that Voldemort was gone and he had more time.
Harry looked at him with a confused look, but got up too and followed Malfoy who still held on to Harry's wrist and pulled the terrace doors open and pulled Harry outside where it has started to rain even more now. The air was chilly and refreshing and Harry took a deep breath. To his surprise, Malfoy pulled him even further, away from the sunblind shielding the terrace and out into the rain.
She was going through the channels as Harry's mind drifted away. He thought of Malfoy how he'd stood there looking nervous and flustered.
"Yes, Harry, they're right. Is everything okay?", Hermione asked. Harry felt anger rising up inside him.
The cupboard was smaller than Draco had expected. It was waist-high and even when Potter was eleven, he didn't perfectly fit inside. Anger rose up inside Draco.
The familiar voice made Harry look up at the cashier. It was Lydia. Harry tried to remember the last time he had seen her, he had been so busy with Malfoy.
Malfoy didn't say anything. Harry wasn't sure about it, but he thought he saw a light smile on Malfoy's lips but even if it had been there, it had vanished just as quickly. Harry nervously fumbled with the hem of his shirt. He didn't know what to do or say - everything he would say would come out wrong. So they sat in silence, but maybe it was at least better than arguing. After a while Harry found it almost relaxing - the silence, the warmth in the room, the comfortable cushions, the feeling of slight intoxication, the presence of Malfoy. And eventually Harry couldn't wipe the smile off his face. Malfoy noticed and stared at Harry with a confused look. Harry just shrugged in return.
Draco opened the door to their room carefully. He looked inside and stepped in. Potter lay on his side, his back to Draco.
Narcissa hated him and he wasn't so fond of her either, so Harry too thought it would be best if he didn't enter the room. Malfoy grabbed the door handle, pushed it down and opened the door. Harry peeked inside and saw Narcissa lying in the hospital bed, her eyes closed and her chest rising and falling beneath the light blanket on her stiff body. Malfoy closed the door behind himself.
Harry shook his head laughing. The crowd in the stands made a great deal of noise. Draco didn't let go of Harry, even though Harry was quite sure, Draco could swim, but he didn't want Draco to let go. Harry liked to have Draco that close to him. They swam back towards the bank where the judges stood watching.
Harry shoved the cauldron to Malfoy. He looked in again, pulled a face and drunk. He tried to talk, but his face went even more pale than it already was and he held his throat.
"He looks horrible. He's been unconscious the whole time I've been here. He has several broken ribs and stuff." Harry said.
Without saying another word Draco turned around, showing Potter his well-formed butt and hung up his trousers and shirt. Draco whipped around, just quick enough to catch Potter staring at him and then looking at his hands embarrassed.
Back at the cash desk Lydia smiled at Harry and batted her eyelashes. Ron always told her stories about Harry, none of them mentioning wizards.
Harry and Teddy reached the lift again and while they waited, a witch in a dark purple robe stepped next to them. She eyed Harry from head to toe, back to his scar and then looked at Teddy through narrowed eyes. Teddy's hair had turned black again.
"Mine is a stag.", Potter said. Draco furrowed his brows. Why did the idiot tell him this? Draco knew that already. But then-
Hermione rolled her eyes and pulled out her wand. Two spells later the drawer opened. Harry smiled and hugged Hermione.
Somehow, Harry got so distracted by thinking of Draco practising with someone, he completely forgot, he was kissing Draco
He didn't know exactly when, how or why it had happened, but he knew one thing: he was in love with this bloody git.
"Are you kidding me? I'm not going to spend money on this ugly table.", Draco answered with a disgusted look. Harry laughed.
"How is your little godson doing?" Mrs Malfoy asked while they were eating their desserts. As soon as she had asked the question, Malfoy's eyes shot up and he looked at Harry curiously.
Harry laughed and rolled his eyes, but Malfoy didn't seem to think it was that funny. He grunted and followed Harry. No matter how much Draco wanted Harry's friends to like him, Harry knew that it took Draco a lot to like them back.
Potter looked at him astounded and Draco smiled awkwardly. "Have you?" He asked. Potter nodded. "Well I had two girlfriends but with Cho it was just kissing and with Ginny we only came to the oral part. But I had sex with a guy before. A few times."
"Because I'd much rather stay here and read." He finally answered and hoped Pansy would just drop it.
"See you.", he said, but didn't walk away, because Draco grabbed his waist, and because he didn't want to.
Harry did know that. He remembered how she had lied in the Forbidden Forest to keep Draco safe. Harry guessed she really did love her family, maybe that's where her devotion to Voldemort came from.
Draco shook his head. "My parents are very strict about that and I have been raised that strictly. I haven't touched anyone ever."
"Yes. Yessss!" it felt almost as good as when Draco had touched Harry. Harry breathed heavily and Draco's cock jerked powerfully in Harry's hand, spunk spattering on his fist and even up onto Harry's stomach where the pyjama top was pulled askew.
Luna and Neville were also holding hands as they walked down to Hogsmeade. So were Ron and Hermione. Harry glanced over to Ginny. He was sure she was looking at him just seconds before, but the second he looked at her, her head turned away immediately. Harry rolled his eyes.
Mrs Weasley laughed and went back to the stove. As usual, Harry and Ron had to set the table, but this time they had help from Malfoy. All thirteen of them gathered around the large table and started to eat. The boys pulled a few crackers during lunch, until Mrs Weasley whipped her wand and banned them from the table. Harry laughed. After lunch, Hermione took Harry upstairs because she wanted to show him something. Harry looked at Ron, but he only shrugged.
"Patronuses complement each other with their loved ones'.", Potter spoke finally. Draco's mouth fell open.
Everyone in the Hall seemed to think the same thing - Harry Potter the saviour, and Draco Malfoy a Deatheater in one room?  What a tragedy! The hall was filled with loud whispers. How the hell did McGonnagal come up with crap like this? And why did she even trust Draco enough? What was going on???
Even Hermione was astounded by Ron's idea. Harry nodded approving and smiled. Ron ate his sausage with a satisfied smile, closed his eyes and breathed in the summer air. The back of Harry's head felt hot from the sun when they finished breakfast and levitated the dishes back inside. His eyes needed time to readjust to the darkness inside the house, but not for long.
He handed Neville a picture of Harry in third year. Neville gave it to Ron and Ron gave it back to Malfoy.
"You know what? I hate you. I hate you for everything you have done to this wonderful boy! Harry Potter is amazing! You may don't see it, but I do. His friends do. His teachers did. And I'm proud of him. His friends are. His teachers are. Even the wizards and witches who don't like him thank him their lifes! You may don't know, but Harry here saved the Wizarding World! But not only because of this, he is my hero, no. He's my hero because now I know with what people he had to grow up and I have a lot of respect for this. I would've killed myself rather than living with you people for fifteen years! I just know you for a good hour, but I already hate you more than anything in the galaxy! You are horrible, awful, nasty people, you are! How can you live with yourselves?"
"We are gathered here today to celebrate the special love that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy share." The headmistress said.
Neville had been worried all day since Ron and Hermione had told him and the others what had happened yesterday with Harry. Neville still couldn't understand what the bloody hell Malfoy had been thinking. And Neville really thought he had been serious about Harry. How could anyone be so gross and mean to someone that loved them this much? Neville knew Harry really loved Malfoy and he couldn't imagine what pain Harry must go through right now. But Ron and Hermione were right to let him go, he had to get away from Malfoy.
"I didn't think you would, have you looked at yourself?" One elve said, staring at Draco with big eyes.
Draco hated them for pretending that it was easy to hold hands with the person they love when it was not for him and Potter.
Draco didn't like his hair like that. He liked it geled back. His father had shown him this when he was only four years old and Draco won't change it today. He would gel his hair back until he dies.
"And I will kill everyone who tries to year us apart. I will kill the man who tries to hurt you.", Potter replied and Draco smiled.
They just sort of fell to kissing again. Draco couldn't complain. Having Potter's hand on his cock, his own wrapped securely around Potter's, and then Potter's tongue in his mouth, was about the best combination of
It started to rain and Draco laughed hysterically. "Thanks!" He shouted angrily at the clouds and cursed under his breath. And immediately, Draco again hated it to be here.
But what Harry really couldn't wrap his head around was the way he thought to describe Malfoy afterwards - looking healthy and not at all ugly. Of course, he had never been ugly, there were a lot of people less appealing. Not that Malfoy was appealing - at least not to Harry. He furrowed his brow. What was going on? He was all weird and strangely accurate.
He heard his roommate getting up and opening his own suitcase. Then, Potter passed him barefoot and closed the bathroom door. A minute later, he came back out, wearing a horrible red sweater and blue jeans.
!", Ron said as he, Harry and Hermione left the classroom in the middle of fifteen other laughing students.
"Draco Lucius Potter," Harry started, "almost exactly eight months ago, just days after our first encounter at Diagon Alley, we sat in a diner and talked. You told me you would like to go to France someday, visit Paris."
"I promise I will keep him safe whenever you can't. And I promise I won't let anyone hurt him in any way." Harry said.
Draco lay on his bed in the Room of Requirement the whole day. He groaned every few minutes and sighed. This was the worst day EVER! Draco groaned again.
"Not much, I still remember this." Harry answered "You were standing at the bar, a drink in your hand and you were looking so elegant and your eyes darted from one face to another."
Half an hour after Harry found out about Ron and Hermione's stupid invitation, he still found himself looking through the room, searching for the flash of blonde hair.
On top of everything, Potter did something brilliant- he pushed forward, rolling Draco onto his back, his hands sliding beneath Draco's shoulders and his weight settling between Draco's thighs.
As Harry woke up, he flipped his blankets so fast, that he rolled over his mattress and fell to the floor. He heard Mal...
The girls didn't stop dancing as they turned to look at Theo and Draco a few feet behind him. They waved and smiled.
- and Draco wanted to join them, but as he saw this girl leaning over the table to Potter and she had been laughing and they had been happy and without Draco they were even more happy, so Draco just left.
"Don't do anything stupid." She called before the door closed and Harry found himself standing alone in the hallway.
Draco stood there and smiled. Potter breathed in and out peacefully and Draco could cry right away again. He missed him so much!
he was sulking. So Draco grabbed his wand, smelled the air and cast a spell. A second later steak, plate and knife and fork floated through his opened window right onto his table. Draco smiled satisfied and sat down to eat when someone knocked on his door.
