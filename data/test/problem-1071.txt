Draco was aching for a hit. Jonesing- that's what a muggle had called it once when Draco was searching for real heroin. He had gotten it, too. It only cost half a galleon. Merlin, it was heavenly. He wished he had some.
Harry nodded, answering yes, he was real. Draco pulled him into the room, mumbling about not letting anyone see as he shut and locked the door.
"Killing you would be bad for my job, so I'm just gonna let you believe that, honey." Malfoy's saccharine words made Harry gag, he really disliked how many pet names were in Malfoy's arsenal now.
"They hate muggles, thought you all thought they weren't even worth an attack." Harry searched around for a cigarette, wincing as the glass moved deeper into him with every step.
Draco thanked every ancient wizard he knew of he didn't have to invent a response to the abhorrent question of 'are you okay.' Pansy was kind for that.
Draco made his journey down to the Great Hall, thankful the corridors were empty as he failed to contain his laughter. He almost believed Potter saw him. How preposterous.
"Calm down, Potter. Wouldn't me to be the one you lose your virginity to, now would we?" Draco circled his finger in the excess liquid of the saucer and shattered to suck it off his finger. Potter stared, he could feel it. Potter also groaned. It was already getting exhausting. He used his off hand to put everything back neatly in the box while he sucked the rest of the residue off his finger. Potter was still staring.
"The first one's supposed to last longer, Goldie." Malfoy's voice was soft, it vibrated against his skin. His hands were in Harry's hair, gentle. "If you start to feel like you got stomped on by a hoard of centaurs, then it's out."
That was the truth. Draco was incredibly worn down. Potter was surprisingly resigned, Draco decided he was more respectful sober. He was thankful for it, if Potter had insisted Draco would have obliged.
He didn't do much that day; a glass of firewhiskey, a film he paid no attention to, some muggle medications- stronger pain pills from when he broke his collarbone in the New York tube before getting to a healer. He fell asleep after a few hours, ignoring the owls he got.
"You want me to eat a bee hive? Like what the insect makes?" Draco asked in disbelief, it sounded absolutely vile.
"You're real." His voice was hoarse, like he hadn't spoken in years. It hurt Harry to hear it. Didn't he talk to anyone?
The potion needed a memory to work properly, Draco didn't get to choose it but they always ended up a phantom of sixth year.
Malfoy was stood outside, smoking a cigarette. Harry didn't know he smoked. Most purebloods don't. He looked incredible. A leather jacket to rival those old gangster films he'd been watching and ripped jeans.
Harry wanted to dance. He wanted to come up behind Malfoy, take his waist in between his hands, lick up from his collarbone to his ear and whisper something alluring. But he couldn't think of anything alluring, and he couldn't bring himself to move. His body was a cage, keeping him anchored to the side of the bar only allowed to watch as Malfoy let his lips drag across strange men. Their hands all over him, his hands all over them. It was just like Malfoy, to be the center of attention and be completely unbothered.
Harry rounded the corner. There was a door where the staircase used to be. A simple door. It looked like the cupboard under the stairs. Maybe they had turned it into storage room. He checked the map again, just to make sure Malfoy was in there. Ink footsteps paced just behind that door.
Harry had already smoked half of his fag, he stared at Malfoy for a long while as he let himself relax against the wall,  hot sparks of his magic hitting his neck but he couldn't be bothered to stop the burning. It was always a surprise to see Malfoy, he looked entirely different than his teenage self. His hair fell loose on his face, tattoos snaked up from his collarbones and his auror training had given him such a muscular build. Harry had only seen him a handful of times since he testified at his post-war trials, he couldn't get used to how much Malfoy had grown.
Harry smiled dumbly, barring his unnerving joy with no sense of shame. His voice matched the shamelessness of his expression, sounding almost in awe at the sight of Draco. "You are awake."
Harry lit another cigarette, coughing as the smoke mingled with the Ritalin dripping down his sinuses.
"I'm having a piss," Harry announced, waiting for Draco to turn away before spelling the pill bottle quickly to him. He can't take enough to cause another nose bleed, Merlin forbid he has to kiss Draco again.
"It would mean something to me, too." Harry felt the words fall out of him, they didn't let him think. "It's all meant something to me, actually."
The patronus he'd been summoning turned red, started running towards Draco with it's tail pointed forward. Draco waved it away before it could sting him. Scorpions weren't kind. They were actually kind of scary. Makes sense fate would make his patronus a devilish little bug. He was in the same range of evil.
"I want to try some." Harry's voice responded to Malfoy's expectant look before he could think of what to say.
"I ha-" Draco let out a sigh, avoiding Harry's eyes as he inhaled a shaky breath, "I think I'm in love with you, too."
Draco laughed, the first time he'd felt it in a long while, "Merlin, Potter. You didn't think they actually put bee hive in it?"
"Potter," Harry looked up, Draco's voice always commanded attention, even if it was as soft as it was now, "You burned yourself, you git."
Finally, the third night Malfoy was back. Already dancing with some guy when Harry had come in. He was wearing all black, a lovely contrast against his pale skin. Harry was determined to talk to him this time. But his body failed him again, only allowing him prolonged stares.
His voice got a bit too breathy as his veins filled. Potter noticed, those moans were purely sexual. Draco knew this wasn't a hallucination, but how could it possibly be real.
"Ask me when you're sober." Draco didn't know if Harry heard him, he was intensely focused on kicking his blankets into submission. It was cute. At least it would have been, if Draco didn't know it would fade away again. Harry would sober up and hate him again- or worse, pity him. But Harry wouldn't be sweet. He wouldn't be cute. He wouldn't think of Draco. He wouldn't.
"How do you not know what a crunchie is? Stupid wizards, this is a delicious- a delicacy." Harry sent haphazard surges of magic out to light up Draco's room, Draco was convinced he had just invented the spell.
I nod in agreement, fighting another yawn, “So, you said you had something you wanted to talk to me about. What is it?”
The small creature leads me further through the gloomy Manor and I have to fight the urge to just turn around and leave straight away. Have they ever heard of windows and sunlight in this house? The walls are covered in old tapestries, paintings of landscapes and portraits of Malfoys from earlier generations (judging by the platinum hair). The old people are staring down at me with disdain. Dear god, how can you let a child grow up in such a glum, pressing atmosphere? Finally Tilly stops in front of a door right at the end of a corridor.
“But shouldn’t we be keeping an eye on Draco and Teddy. You said he still has the mind of a child. Are you sure it’s safe to leave them running around the house on their own?”
Draco settled again, my face turns into a mask of anger. I grip my wand tighter and stomp to my front door. Whoever that stupid ministry employee is, is going to hear the rant of his life. After days of emotional torment watching Draco go forward in small steps and now to might have torn it down in just a few minutes because he couldn’t wait a few fucking moments for me to answer the door. Especially because I noticed that while Draco only takes tiny steps forward, reverting back to worse is idiotically easy and a small incident can turn weeks of work obsolete. With that in mind I rip the door open violently and throw my magic (already starting to get out of control again) at the jerk. At least he does a step back.
“Yes, during the time my friends and I spent running, we made the mistake of saying Voldemort’s name. That alerted some of his goons to us. They found us, caught us and brought us to Malfoy Manor. There they pushed Draco forward to identify whether it’s actually me since Hermione had used a curse on me. If he had told them that it was me, because I’m sure he recognised me, then they would have called Voldemort and he would have killed us all. It would have been over,” I pause for a moment, dots connecting in my mind, “Now that I think about it, the war would have been over if he had correctly identified me at that point. But he didn’t. He said he couldn’t be sure. I’m certain he didn’t get off lightly when we escaped later on and all of them saw clearly that it was indeed me.”
The hall is about the size of a quarter of a soccer field. One side is covered in mirrors, but they have blinds over them to not unsettle the patients. A horse is waiting patiently in the middle of the hall, head held only half high, but lifting when it hears the door opening. The mare’s back is about as high as my shoulders and her coat is goldenish, reminding me of the colour of Draco’s hair from our first school years. Her mane and tail are white just like her legs. It’s a beautiful horse with intelligent dark eyes. Draco’s gaze immediately fixes on the horse. He seems uncertain whether he is allowed forward to it so I give him the needed freedom. He actually leaves my hold, takes two steps on his own before he catches himself against the mare’s side. Andrea smiles.
After Dumbledore’s death another handwriting continues the reports. It seems vaguely familiar to me but I can’t place it. I haven’t even gotten until the time of my 17th birthday when a look out of the window suddenly makes me realise how late it already is. Cursing under my breath I jump up. I have been so immersed in this report that I completely forgot the time. And I am supposed to be at the Burrow for dinner tonight. Hastily I disfigure some empty sheets into a folder and try to get all the material about Spy A into it since I haven’t finished reading it yet. But a summoning charm doesn’t work, so I have to sort them out between the sweets bills, most likely there to hide the reports, by hand and stuff them into the folder one by one. It takes me longer than expected and has me bolting out of the door in haste once I finished.
Unfortunately that’s Draco’s only clear moment for the rest of the week. He spends most of the time in his childish haze. At least his panic attacks have eased a bit, even though only little. But every additional hour without one means more peace for Draco and some sleep for me.
He only huffs before seeming to drop into deeper sleep. I sigh and let my head fall onto the pillow behind Draco. Well, he’s not letting me go anytime soon. It’s nothing new that he tends to be clingy after a nightmare, but usually I can just detach his hand and go back to my room until the next alarm rips me out of sleep again. However today he is not letting me go and wants me to sleep here instead. I guess a bed is a bed. It will work, my tired brain supplies, already half on my way to sleep. I barely register how I wrap an arm around the body in front of me before completely dropping off.
“My archenemies are all suddenly calling me by my first name and it became a habit. What did I wake up for?” he snorts downwards, but before I can say anything about that, he straightens back up, “Granger,” he says in a hesitant tone, “I am not sure why you are here, but…” he takes another deep breath, “From what I understood from Potter’s mumblings, you did a lot for me,” his eyes are flitting around the room, hands white-knuckling on the chair he is holding onto to steady himself, “I do not understand why any of you would do that with what I did to all of you, but politeness demands that I say, well,” he has trouble keeping his gaze still, but for a moment he manages to lock on Hermione, “Thank you,” he says with determination.
“Most things, yes. But maybe you can find something in those boxes I brought you?” Hermione suggests, “Or you could maybe get a cat.”
Immediately silver eyes fix on me. Slight surprise is visible on his face but nothing more and he covers it up fast. Instead he stares straight ahead again. I smile at the back of his head and get down from my seat into the witness stand. This is my best try to spare Draco worse punishment.
Only his worst fucking enemy. Or former enemy. He isn’t strictly sure where they stand, but some part of him knows what will happen before Marsh even gets the words out.
“I’ve sent him a patronus already, he’ll likely be here any moment.” Harry is surprised to hear Pomfrey chime in, but his confusion is set aside as the sound of the floo activating in Pomfrey’s office alerts them to an incoming visitor.
He walks forward without thinking and reaches his arms out, and maybe he should be surprised when Harry immediately hands the child over, but he isn’t, because he knows in his soul that this little boy is his family. It feels like something bigger than him, big enough to fill the whole room.
Okay, so maybe there was a time, between divorcing Ginny and taking up the Defense post at Hogwarts, that he’d done quite a bit of...casual dating. It was good for him, really. After all of the distractions he’d dealt with as a teenager, then marriage straight away...there hadn’t been time for him to explore.
The moments that follow are tense and quiet, broken only by the crackle of Pomfrey’s magic and the thankfully fading whimpers from Scorpius, each of which seem to set his father further and further on edge.
It’s Draco’s intention to corner Potter for an interrogation as soon as class is over, but the slippery bastard is out the door with only a glance and an infuriatingly casual wave in Draco’s direction.
Harry laughs too, shaking his head and marveling at her confidence. The way she carries herself is worlds away from the 11 year old girl he once knew, and his heart warms to think he’s had a hand in it. He claps her on the shoulder. “Give ‘em hell, I’ll be there to cheer you on.”
“Not this time. Just can’t seem to shut her gob. Told a bunch of muggles all about her daddies being wizards. That’s what we get for sending her to muggle primary school.”
Harry’s cock is dark and thick and achingly hard and every little slide of flesh draws a tiny sigh from Harry’s lips. With a quick wandless charm, Draco conjures up a spot of lube and drags it over the length of Harry’s cock. The answering moan is nearly enough to send Draco over the edge, and his own hips buck against Harry’s thigh, seemingly prompting him to follow suit, because a moment later he has Draco’s cock in hand and is setting a torturously slow pace that Draco can’t help but follow.
Harry nods thoughtfully, “Though that doesn’t really explain why you feel it so strongly,” he glances back at the book page, “There’s only the two of you left.”
much attention in school, but with the exception of bloody Slughorn’s year, he was quite sure that the Savior hadn’t scored higher than Troll on a single Potions assignment.
There’s a foreign childlike interest in Potter’s eyes and Draco gives his best incredulous look, “Of course I do.” What kind of question was that? Then, “...have you never heard a fairy tale?”
He doesn’t know if it hurts more that Harry has somewhere else more important to be, or that he doesn’t seem interested in
Potter makes the space feel smaller than it is, but he’s always been larger than life. Even Draco can admit that.
Harry smiles against his shoulder and pushes him down into the bed, slotting their hips together and rocking slowly against him, “I don’t intend to.”
“So much light?” The question isn’t really a question. It’s a refrain, one that makes Draco think that somehow Potter
Monday brings yet another Advanced Magical Interactions class and for the first time, Draco arrives before Potter. In fact, Potter only walks in a moment before Marsh does, giving Draco only a moment to watch him cast his
belong, Scorpius. You have magic in you, and that’s all it takes to belong here. I think if you give the Gryffindors a chance, you might find that they think so too.”
Of course, if he can mimic Potter, Potter can mimic him, and he only just makes it out of the building before he’s being pulled gently off the sidewalk and he spins around to find Potter’s face looking wounded.
Their exchange is cut short as a stern looking woman strides to the front of the room, garnering the attention of the class with her presence alone. She reminds Draco of McGonagall, even with her brown skin and closely cropped black curls.
expect exactly what he’s seeing. Is Draco so transparent? There’s something of a smile on Potter’s face, but then it falls to curiosity and he leans in, getting a better look at the top of Draco’s core, “What’s this blue?”
When he directs the impression of Potter’s magic to the wall, what Draco expects to see is gold, gold and more gold, but he’s surprised to see something entirely different.
than anywhere Draco has ever been. “I think you’ve proven well enough that family doesn’t have to share blood to be, well, family.” He bounces Teddy on his hip and wins a giggle for his efforts, “And I might be his favourite now, but you’re not missing out on much,” he adds with a grin, moving to settle on the floor with Teddy and his toys.
Potter makes a noise of interest and jots down another note. Draco turns back to look at him as the projection fades entirely, leaving them back in the relative darkness of Draco’s rooms.
And Draco is left alone with a sense of unease, trying not to wonder if he’s made a mistake, or if Harry thinks so.
“He’s going to be okay.” Pomfrey’s voice is soft, a combination of the atmosphere in the room and her own fatigue from fighting the curse. “I’ve seen this particular curse before, he’ll sleep for a time, and when he wakes he will be sore and weak. I’d like to keep him here until he recovers fully.”
Draco is quiet for a moment, weighing his response. His curiosity and a mild scornfulness get the better of him. “Are you
“She did,” Potter answers, and it’s only then that Draco realizes he’s spoken his ruminations aloud. “She’d have burned everything to the ground for you.”
Potter is even more confused now, and Draco decides to be kind and merciful, so he shrugs, adding, “I did, however, learn the
The unyielding squeeze of apparition gives way to a quiet beachside cottage, laundry on the line outside, and soft music from a wireless streaming out of what must be the kitchen window.
He doesn’t leave, though Draco can sense the underlying urgency in his voice. “Then I’ll see you Saturday?”
Then his trousers are gone and it's them both in their underwear, pressed together against the side of Draco’s bed, and Draco finds that he wants Harry right here, like this, so he dips a hand beneath the waistband of his boxers and pulls out his cock, tugging the offending garment down to his thighs at the same time. And then he’s holding Harry Potter’s dick in his hand, and as strange as that thought is, his own jumps a little in his briefs at the knowledge.
“One time, in this very bathroom, we brewed a Polyjuice potion - well, Hermione brewed it, Ron and I rather just got in her way, probably - anyway, we did it to turn into a couple of our Slytherin classmates and sneak into their common room. Stuff tasted terrible, and felt even worse. Don’t recommend it, Polyjuice. Especially not at twelve.”
“I’m all he’s got. He lives here with me, and his caretaker watches him while I’m in classes. She usually leaves at 6.” There’s careful meaning in the last part, and Draco suddenly feels like a monster.
Of course, when Draco arrives on the beach, the flames of the bonfire roar and dance in a way that makes his skin crawl with memories he’s trying to suppress, and while witches and wizards mill about in the sand, chattering in this language and that, none of them are the one he’s looking for.
“Ah yes, the elusive evening plans. Wouldn’t want you to keep your fans waiting, or whatever it is.”
A soft grin lights up the Charms teacher’s face, and Harry gazes into the fire as Dean finishes the letter.
Harry expects Malfoy to fight back, to argue, anything. Anything other than narrow his eyes and take a step back, tucking his wand away. His left hand still balled into a tight fist is the only sign of resistance to the matron’s words.
“Not interested in the Quidditch match?” He asks quietly, not particularly expecting an answer. Scorpius shakes his head, and Harry takes that as a sign to continue trying to talk to him. “It’s not for everyone, gets a little too loud and crazy in the stands, I think. Can be a stressful sport to watch.”
Perhaps they are no longer rivals, or enemies, maybe now they are just a teacher and a parent. Men who have changed enough from when they knew one another that their history is irrelevant. Right now, this young boy in a hospital bed, he is what is relevant.
“Wandmaking? Really?” Draco weighs that information against what he’s learned about Harry this year, and begins to nod thoughtfully, the interest in earth magic, the enthusiasm about wands being a conduit, it makes sense. “I can see that, actually. Especially with the whole elder wand thing...you’ll be a hit, won’t be able to keep a wand on your shelves.”
Now he’s sat with his legs crossed in front of him, wearing a ridiculous hat - the muggle kind with the plastic snaps on the back - over his unruly hair, and his eyes are carefully trained on Draco’s meticulous penmanship. He’d look utterly muggle, were it not for the parchment in his hands and the wand at his side, (it’s still out from the sun protection charm he’d wordlessly cast over their heads, muttering something about
Harry approached Teddy, his smile growing with each step. He held out his hand to Teddy so they could tour the tree house together.
Sputtering out a weak apology, Harry handed the newspaper roughly to Draco and then swiftly backed away, his eyes scanning for the car he had requested earlier.
Draco walked up to Harry and slapped him in the face. He hauled Harry by his shirt until he was inches from Draco's face. His white skin had turned red and the sneer was back in all its glory.
George tilted his head in thought for a moment before replying. “Naw, Dudley's last name was Dursley. Unfortunate name, really.”
after the war. Your family lawyers can request a copy of the statement of ownership from the Department of Magical Law.'
Finally Harry felt a blunt press on his hole and took a deep breath, enjoying the slight burn of being filled with the added new sensation of the full skirt fluttering around his cock.
A woman. A woman with a fixation on theft and destruction. Sounded like a bad combination to Harry. He took another drag of his fag before revving his engine and heading toward Surrey.
“There is obviously something going on from the looks the two of you just shared.” She pointed to the back door. “What I’m trying to figure out is why you felt like you had to keep it hidden.”
"I really want to change the graduation requirements from the Ministry and include a new class to be taught here. There really should be a class on pure-blood traditions."
Draco continued to swim, diving under the water periodically and coming up with big gasps. The rest of the crew flew to the edge of the lake and were stuck watching Draco desperately search the watery depths.
Written for the 2008 hd_inspired fest. This story will be in two parts. The first part is very plot heavy. Draco, and the relationship, will be mostly featured in part two. Enjoy!
Harry's smile could have lit up London. He leaned forward, giving Draco a peck on the lips, and then Apparated away.
“My mother told me, but I didn’t want to believe it. I didn’t want to believe that family just turned their backs on each other, but they do. She doesn’t care, my mother doesn’t care, so why should I care, right?”
“I had a few things left over from the manor that had no place to go in our own tree house. So, I brought them over tonight. You still need a few things, like a bed for Teddy’s room and a dining room table, but if you like, I can help you pick out some things. I know a guy who makes furniture out of tree trunks. Might go with the décor.”
'I wasn’t sure if you were in town.' What Harry said was a lie, and Dean clearly knew it, but he kept his mouth shut, most likely due to Draco’s presence.
Draco pulled on his hair. “But, weren't you angry? You trusted Dumbledore! You said so a few days ago that you considered him to be a father figure. But what kind of father sets things in motion so that his son has to knowingly walk into death?”
Draco turned towards the walls. 'My name is Draco Malfoy and I come in search of the Magical Cauldron. I am the last descendant of the Malfoy family line. It is my duty to find the Magical Cauldron, and I implore you to help me.'
The wedding continued and soon Matholwch took Branwen back to his own kingdom where they lived a happy life, for a while. After a few years Matholwch's evilness began to come out and he abused Branwen and kept her locked in the attic. But, training an injured bird, Branwen was able to send word to Bran.
As he prepared for bed, Harry heard an insistent tapping on his window. A large pure-black eagle owl stood proud, and as soon as Harry opened the window the bird flew directly to his shoulder and nipped his ear.
Suddenly there was a large groan and Draco began to shift underneath Fawkes, his head turning from side to side.
Malfoy did seem to enjoy Harry’s cooking, making sure to arrive right before breakfast in the morning, being the first one at the table for lunch, and staying for dinner each night. Malfoy would never admit his fondness for anything to do with Harry, but he knew Malfoy wasn’t staying for the dinner company. Andromeda was still uneasy about Malfoy’s presence, and his snarky comments didn’t lead to a feeling of good will. And poor Teddy. Teddy just didn’t understand why his favorite play partner was spending all day outside with someone that wasn’t Teddy. Teddy had been giving both Harry and Malfoy the silent treatment during the meals, which seemed like a great idea to Malfoy, who prattled on and on, but Harry missed Teddy’s stories and easy laughter.
“But I was a virgin too, you know. I wouldn’t have laughed at you. I had the same thing happen to me. Everyone assumes I slept with Ginny, but with all her brothers around I never dared touch her. You could have told me.”
The goblin smiled a very wide and toothy smile. But then she frowned again, pulling on Draco's tunic harshly until he knelt on the ground so she could speak directly to his face. 'I know what you are planning, boy.'
“Yeah, I’ve disarmed plenty of other people and their wands never worked for me. I’ve had a lot of time to think, and the best theory that I came up with is that you and I aren’t as different as I thought before. Actually, we’re quite similar. So it would only make sense that our magic would be similar too.”
“Harry, you cannot put it off any longer. You must make a wand. I'm not sure how long we can keep this a secret.”
Harry sat forward. “What other choice did I have? It was either him or me. Either I went and confronted Voldemort, or we all died. It was a simple decision. I was the only one that could have done that.”
Harry took a deep breath and crumpled the paper. It was just another one of Ron's crazy rumours. Luna flew off of Harry's shoulder and transformed back to her normal self.
Harry smiled, imagining a small Draco reciting this very same poem. “Did it help to understand the poem, memorizing it?”
It was Fawkes, flying toward them, his beautiful red and gold plumage a lovely contrast to the brown and greens of the forest floor.
Harry let the guilt wash over him. He knew he was letting people down, but he had stopped blaming himself long ago.
As his word rang out around the ship, Padma and Luna suspiciously chose that moment to come above deck, Padma with a firm hold on Luna's arm. Harry raised his eyebrow to Luna, who just shrugged in response.

"We must come out. We must come forward and be visible. No more secret meetings and newsletters in code. Our group will be open and our agenda clear. It is time, and I believe we are ready."
'Harry.' Padma placed and arm on his shoulder. 'He didn't mean he brought reinforcements. He meant he had Voldemort's body with him.'
I grip the door jam and open my mouth to spill everything to my dad, to warn him, when Mr. Potter shuffles behind me, poking his head into the kitchen.
I'm a thirteen-year-old boy, of course I know what that smells like. My best friend Brian wore the same flip-flops during the entire summer. Come August, I could recognize Brian from his foot odor alone.
There was a pause and then Draco chuckled. “I had no idea you had a sense of humour, Potter.  That might come in handy.”
Dean laughed on the other side of the door. Then there was silence. Harry moved closer to the door to hear if Dean had left. He could hear Dean breathing on the other side, and yet he wasn't speaking.
“Harry, can you help me cut the cake? These kids are going to be hungry when they come down from there.”
“It went directly to my solicitor. I told him to expect it today or tomorrow and to process it right away. My guess is by tomorrow afternoon everything will be settled.”
Draco threw the blanket back over his legs. “Figured that out have you, Potter?  "This happened two nights ago and it's just gotten worse. By Severus's calculations my legs will turn into wood completely by the end of this week, then the rest of my body will go. And then my mind."  He turned his gaze out the window again.  "That part we hope to hold onto for as long as possible.”
"Mr. Parkinson, I do appreciate your effort and I truly admire your ability to take the text and apply it to other incidents in history. Truly remarkable. We all make mistakes in our learning, but our mistakes can be turned into triumphs. Remember that."
Harry stared down at the cave floor, unsure why the motto affected him so much. There was something in those words, something greater than just a fancy tying together of sentences. To Harry, the saying meant that in order to truly hold onto anything, one had to seek it out for themselves, journeying to any length to achieve it, suffering trials and tribulations to attain their heart’s desire. And only then would the object of their desire truly be theirs.
Once close, Luna reached out a hand to pet the body of the squid. Harry could see the damp moisture on the smooth rubbery skin and imagined what Luna was touching could not be pleasant.
After a few minutes, Harry lay back down on the bed only to realize he wasn’t going to be able to sleep any more that night. Grunting, he gathered himself up and headed toward his closet. He threw on pants, trousers, a shirt that didn’t smell too awful, and his leather jacket and headed toward his garage.
You see, the Muggles have it all wrong, for Twelfth Night has nothing to do with exaggerated punishments for lazy Muggle decorators, and rather is a celebration of the ending of the twelve day Grindylow Infestation of 1212. There is caroling and children playing with their new brooms outside their homes, and plenty of scrumptious desserts and cookies suspiciously shaped like green underwater creatures.
"I like men and women both, but I definitely have been leaning towards men lately. They get me harder faster and my orgasms are always bigger."
The visits then increased to once every two weeks. Like an appetizer before a meal; the sex was just enough to wet the stomach, but not enough to fill it. Soon, Harry was hearing the bell once a week, on Friday nights at two in the morning. Harry could smell the scent of smoke and alcohol and know that Draco had been out dancing, but Harry didn’t care, so had he. And then the visits were every night. Harry thought it a perfectly natural that Draco would share his bed each night and leave in the morning. If Draco was anything like Harry, he needed a good orgasm to sleep and it was becoming more and more difficult to produce one without that damn bell sound and the feel of Draco’s arse around his cock. And humans needed their sleep. It was a scientific fact.
Harry felt frozen. His body refused to move, refused to turn away from Draco as he approached his bed. Harry did nothing when Draco slowly lifted Harry’s sheets and he did nothing when Draco lay on top of him, his long hair blocking Harry’s peripheral vision so all he could see was Draco’s face.
Harry felt his whole body flame. “What? No!”  Harry ducked his head. “I just thought we could talk, catch up.”
The bird smartly remained on Harry's shoulder, allowing him the illusion of privacy while still silently supporting him.
Another band of gold wrapped around the joined hands. There was a force attempting to pull them apart, but Harry held on tight.
Draco’s prick was even hotter to the touch without the clothing barrier. It was hot and hard, and yet soft and smooth, all at the same time. He began to stroke, the way he liked to be stroked himself, and watched for cues in Draco’s facial expressions to see if he was going it right.
Now he was getting somewhere. Hopefully this boy would say his name. His father was probably in Azkaban right now.
Draco realized that Harry had continued to hold his sleeve during the silence, waiting for a response.
“They still have you on?” Detective Jerry said, his fat belly waving as he spoke. “I thought they fired you a long time ago.”
Draco ignored his question and instead approached the woman, holding onto her shoulders and attempting to steer her back inside the house. “Come on, dear. No need for the neighbours to see the goods.”
It was only Dean and Luna who stayed until the end. Luna loved the open air and the exploration of new and exciting places. Because of her form, she often was able to fly back home at any time to pick up post or just say hello. So Harry understood why Luna felt no inclination to leave the pirate life.
The next page in the file looks more promising. It's a piece of parchment with an official seal on the bottom. It's an order for Mr Potter, to begin an investigation on my father for use of Magic in front of Muggles.
Dora took her hand and squeezed. She then kissed Draco on the cheek and headed upstairs. Narcissa walked out the door, leaving Draco and Harry alone in the foyer.
My father smiles at me, his eyes clear and soft. I'd been creeping up ever so slowly to his height, but today I realize we're finally at the same eye level. He lifts his eyebrow, I lift my eyebrow, he pulls his hair behind his right ear, I pull my hair behind my left. But then my father surprises me by sticking out his tongue so I use my finger to lift up my nose.
"So First Years, step up one at a time. Headmistress McGonagall has asked that I sort you this year. The houses are eagerly awaiting your arrival."
Harry then Apparated to the quarterdeck, behind the captain's wheel and shouted. 'Raise the gangplank and set sail!'
My father kicks me in the shins and gives me a look that threatens to turn into a lecture if I don’t keep quiet. I sigh and stab a piece of carrot with my fork, imagining it to be Mr Potter’s arm.
Harry had no idea that he had stood, or that his Cloak had fallen off, but when he heard that his godson, his only family would take the fall for the kidnapping, most likely to be expelled from the school, he had to react. The room, which had burst into chaos at Teddy's announcement, grew quiet again, but this time instead of staring at Teddy all eyes were on Harry.
Teddy was coloring in a large coloring book of Hogwarts, focusing hard on the picture of Hagrid. He had used bright purple for the beard and orange for the skin.
Harry and Draco would then make their way to the quarterdeck, Harry greeting Dean and his lover Sam, who had joined them after their last mission, before taking over the captain's wheel.
Harry roared. “Oh course I was angry! But not for what you said! I didn't care about my life at that point. Who am I? I'm the Boy-Who-Lived. Facing Voldemort is the only thing I was raised to do! There was no other reason for my existence, so when my time came I went and fulfilled my destiny, but they didn't hold up their end of the bargain! I was supposed to die, supposed to follow my parents and finally be with them. All my family was on the other side, every single one of them. Of course they told me to walk into death. They wanted me to join them! That's where I belong! Not here, on the earth, with absolutely nothing in front of me except endless days of being alone.”
He’s back in his emerald green swim shorts and is happily admiring the way his own skin has tanned from afternoons out on this very beach while Potter spreads his towel out over the sand, nearly touching Draco’s.
“It makes sense to look to the future.” The words are sure and comforting, and Draco doesn’t know which one of them they’re for, but he appreciates Potter for saying them either way. He picks up Potter’s notes and sets back to reading, conjuring up a quill to make an additional note here and there.
“You look like shite.” He says, by way of announcing himself. Potter’s answering glare makes a childish pride flare in his chest. “You didn’t take the weekend to sleep in, I see.” He adds, settling into the surprisingly comfortable blue chair across from Potter and blatantly staring at the dark circles that linger under Potter’s eyes.
Meanwhile, Harry’s managed to get Draco’s shirt unbuttoned and is pushing it off his shoulders, stopping to stare at Draco’s chest, flawless and lightly tanned from the sun. Draco takes his moment of inaction to tug Harry’s shirt up over his head, but stops when he sees the sadness creeping in on Harry’s face. “Don’t, please…”
“Harry what’s going on?” He breathes after a moment of taking in the genuine comfort of holding this child in his arms, hardly able to tear his eyes away from the cheerfully babbling baby to look at Harry.
A tearful sniffle, a nod. “Malfoys are supposed to be Slytherins. Grandfather says that every Malfoy there’s ever been has been a Slytherin. An- and Grandmother says that I need to be friends with the other pureblood kids, and they’re all Slytherins too.”
A young woman in the front row raises her hand and speaks in Korean that quickly shifts to English in Draco’s ears, “What about other types of magic? Do they change our cores?”
The slide of his cock against Harry’s is what does it for Draco, and a moment later, he’s spilling his climax in bursts over Harry’s stomach and both of their cocks. Harry follows soon after, the slide of Draco’s release helping him along.
By the time Monday arrives again, Draco has had the time to decide that he’ll pretend nothing happened at all. It’s not a full class anyway, they’re just turning their projects in and then they’re free to go, a lucky morning off as a reward for the effort they’ve put into their work for the first half of the term.
Draco makes a mental note to research the long term effects of portkey travel on the body...later, after this blasted meeting is done.
Fall term moves along, just like any other year. The weather cools, and the students settle into a routine. Very little out of the ordinary occurs at Hogwarts these days - ordinary being a relative term.
Draco can feel Harry watching him as he reads through the last few paragraphs that Harry wrote about Draco’s core. It’s mostly academic, with a hint of flattery, which is probably unnecessary for the assignment, but Draco can’t bring himself to complain. They’d agreed to each cover the write-up of the other’s core, allowing a less biased assessment, but these words in Harry’s cramped scrawl are more biased than anticipated
This is the house Teddy grew up in. Grimmauld finally served as the stage for a good childhood to play out, one full of love, and comfort, and reassurance. Echoes of the past, memories of pain and fear were outshone by the sound of Teddy’s footsteps as he ran through the halls, the smell of biscuits baking in the kitchen as Harry tried to learn one of Molly’s recipes, the echo of laughter when Teddy learned to transform himself into a replica of Kreature, much to the elf’s distaste.
“Yes, yes, we get it, you’ve made a miraculous recovery.” Malfoy’s sarcasm is laced with fondness. “Alas, your healer wants you to stay a few more days.”
“The what?!” Potter looks 20% eager and 80% annoyed. Draco laughs and it’s only 20% mocking...okay, 30%.
He isn’t talking to Draco so much as himself, and Draco feels like an intruder as Potter’s eyes follow the duelling ribbons of colour in his core. He thinks to take a few notes for their project, but quickly finds that he doesn’t know what to say. Potter’s core is neutral, shockingly enough, but the chaos of alternating colours, vines growing together, trying to strangle one another all the while, it’s jarring.
They’d nearly kissed. Draco was certain of that. And maybe....maybe after spending weeks together, maybe after seeing into his soul and realizing that Potter isn’t the person Draco thought he was....
looking at him with those wide eyes, Harry, his university classmate, Harry, who he grudgingly enjoys spending time with, Harry, who isn’t at all the person Draco made him out to be.
Draco sets his bag neatly on the floor and turns to greet his new classmate, stopping short as wide green eyes mimic the surprise in his own.
He lets his eyes trail back up to Harry’s, wanting to see the proof of just how this affects him on his face, and he finds that Harry’s already looking at him. They meet each other’s eyes and Harry grins and leans in to kiss him, hot and open mouthed, as he speeds up his hand.
He’s at the wall, an ink-stained finger tracing a line of red, “She died to save me, it’s ancient magic, but it was there...all along, fighting him. He was there too, powerful, but helpless against her love.”
Draco cradles the little boy in his arms, that warm draw only growing as tiny fingers close in a fist around the fabric at his shoulder. He hardly notices the kindly older woman that waves cheerfully to Harry and sees herself out.
Potter seems to think about that for a moment and then grins, “No, not bad enough for that. They were still nastily exhausting, after all. And I’m not using them to get a job, just to get into school, so I can go do more school, and
Dean and Seamus got married several years back, and Harry attended the wedding along with a handful of their other classmates. It was the kind of thing that made sense to all of them, even if they never would have predicted it back in school. Harry supposes that the two of them finding a way to be honest about how they felt for one another is one of the more wonderful things to come out of the war.
The gold is there, vast spatterings of it throughout, from the base to the top, and the same silver-white of Draco’s forms the background, but what is surprising is the riot of colour in the very base of Potter’s core.
It feels like a nice little ‘fuck you’ to Draco’s murky history to stroll down the street, past a muggle girl with her eyes trained on her...cell phone? And think nothing of it as she turns the corner and he strides through the doors of the university, ducking away from the coming storm and into his brand new life.
Draco raises an eyebrow but moves forward to where the projection on the wall is just beginning to ripple and fade away. He sees that there are a few dots of blue near the very edge, “Alchemy.” he says with a soft wonder, “My mastery classes for potions have dabbled just a little…”
He can feel Potter’s eyes on him for a long time before he follows suit and they lapse into a busy silence once again.
Mid-December finds Harry in his office more often than not. It’s one of the rare times that the assignments he’s set for his assorted classes pile up and overwhelm him - every year it happens, and every year he keeps his schedule the same.
They’re both quiet for a few moments, listening to the waves roll in and the soothing drone of the surf. It’s only when Draco begins to wonder if this was a mistake that Potter speaks.
“Not sooner than six hours, I’m aware.” Malfoy’s friendly tone with the matron is nearly as shocking as the fact that she allows him to interrupt her without scolding. “Please rest, Poppy. Thank you for looking out for him.”
He’s saved, of course, by Potter reaching out across the minimal space between them and tilting Draco’s head down by his jaw, then kissing him, a quick press of lips against lips. It’s over in a second, but Draco’s hand has reached out of its own accord and dug it’s fingers into the soft fabric of Harry’s shirt to pull him closer. The second time it’s not so quick, it’s a slow slide of fragile skin, and Harry’s lips are chapped and Draco’s catch against them and he doesn’t care, he doesn’t care at all because he’s on
There are students sprinkled here and there at the tables, and what looks like a small coffee bar in the far corner. Rows and rows of books line the walls, and most of them actually appear to have been bound this century. But the biggest difference, of course, is the chatter. Students speak amongst themselves, debating their subject of study or laughing at the antics of their friends.
“So, what have you learned?” he asks lightly, nodding his head to Potter’s notes as he retakes his seat.
Harry reflexively ducks away from her hand as she reaches out to him. “I’ve been a little busy Myrtle, sorry about that.” He does feel bad for the ghost, knowing her story and what Voldemort did to her because of her muggle parents. He tries to keep her company now and then, with the added benefit of relieving unsuspecting students of her antics, and ensuring she doesn’t turn up uninvited in the shower in his quarters...again.
Dean nods, that soft smile on his face again, “I’ve missed them more than I could have imagined, fires and all,” a fond chuckle fills the quiet room. “You going back to London for the hols, then?”
“She was fighting for your soul all along.” Draco murmurs, wondering if even his own mother had loved him that much.
“How is earth magic dark and light at the same time?” Draco nearly jumps at the sound of Potter’s voice and has to drag his eyes from the man’s throat to his eyes, which don’t hold the slightest hint of accusation, they’re just earnest and interested, like they always seem to be these days.
With a curt nod, Minerva sweeps out of the room, leaving Harry in the quiet with Malfoy, who is clinging tightly to Scorpuis’s hand, but looking warily up at his old rival. They regard each other with a tired tension, one that feels worn and outdated. Years have passed - decades, even - is there really any benefit to clinging to a drama that has long played out?
And then it’s over and Harry is smiling sheepishly at him, “I’ve really got to go, I have another class.”
“Your core is dark, but only barely. It’s on the cusp of a transition, like it’s lightening by the day.” Potter looks pleased to announce this, and Draco can’t say he’s not pleased to hear it. It’s better than he could have hoped for. Perhaps living in the depths of the darkness didn’t leech as much nefarious magic into him as he’d thought.
They sit in a peaceful moment of quiet, and then Potter is moving, getting to his feet and tossing that bloody hat down on his towel, “Come on then, I didn’t get to go swimming the last time.” He reaches a hand out to Draco, who takes it and allows himself to be pulled to his feet and into the cool clear water.
Potter frowns minutely, but pushes himself back from the table and extends his arms as Draco had, reversing their positions as Draco casts the spell.
“Go on then, do it.” He draws his arms out to the sides, feeling very vulnerable as he presents his chest, adorned with a very light grey jumper, to Potter who, to his credit, doesn’t sit around gawking, but hastens to draw his wand and cast.
Draco laughs, his head falling back and then dropping to Harry’s shoulder, “hmm, I think we could probably arrange that. Although….”
Potter looks around curiously for a moment, then drops his bag by the leg of the dining table and pulls out one of the two chairs, settling himself down. The bags and circles under his eyes look even worse than usual, and Draco wonders if he’s slept this week at all. Maybe he’s been as nervous about this section of the assignment as Draco has. There’s something reassuring about the idea that Draco isn’t alone in the nearly crippling anxiety that such self-scrutiny brings him.
Potter’s eyes are wide and alarmed, and only soften slightly when he realizes it’s Draco stopping him. He flushes minutely and a very evil voice in the back of Draco’s head points out that his embarrassment is actually lovely. “What, Malfoy? We don’t meet again until Saturday.” He tries and fails for a casual tone, and Draco can’t help pinning him with a look that shows he’s not falling for it.
The room has seating for about twenty, the chairs are nearly full, and he only gives himself a few moments to size up his classmates - a handful of people he’ll get to know quite well, he assumes - before he swans down the rows of desks to claim one of very few open seats. It’s near the middle of the room, and next to a rather scruffy looking dark-haired man.
And that's where we leave our boys <3 Thanks again for sticking through it to the end. I have got more Drarry in the works for the future, so don't be a stranger! Feel free to poke me on tumblr, where I am also rinnwrites.
Scorpius Malfoy lay on the bed, his back arched in pain, and his eyes squeezed closed. The air leaves his lungs like a punch to the gut, and Harry turns to Minerva, “What happened?”
“I thought it would scar...all this time, but that first day at the beach I saw…” Harry looks up at him and Draco tries to ignore the arousal in his groin and give this moment, well, a moment.
Draco absolutely doesn’t speed up at the idea that Potter may be there with answers to why he’s turned up here, of all places.
Harry smiles, bright and white and a little too much, “That shifty old bat!” He says, laughing and clearly fonder than the words would lead one to believe. “She did the same to me,” he admits, “Told me she always thought I could be successful in school, given a proper opportunity.” He shakes his head, “I wonder how many of our year she tracked down and pulled strings for.”
Potter isn’t following the same path. Obviously. That would be laughable. Not that Draco paid him all
“You’ll tell the Headmistress that I am quite alright, thank you. I’m off to rest now, and the young Mr. Malfoy is in the best care possible.”
Myrtle looks positively smitten with this idea, nodding and giggling as she floats right through him and then the wall, leaving Harry alone with Scorpius.
Letting it slide, Draco sets the paper aside and looks up to where Harry is perched on the edge of his bed and smiles, “I think we’ve finished.”
Soft lips move against his, then Draco nips roughly at his bottom lip, sending a wave of arousal through him. Harry groans and presses a hand to Draco’s lower back, straining to bring them closer, despite the awkward angle where they’re seated on the bench.
Draco steps into his assigned classroom and feels simultaneously like the adult that he is and the 11-year-old boy that once walked through the doors of the Hogwarts Express for the first time. He’s not sure what to make of it.
It makes him all the more nervous to see his own, to have Potter draw this projection from him, and analyse the particles of his soul.
ALSO: Thank you thank you to the GWB Discord server for being endlessly supportive and just all around wonderful people <3
strategy against him and arrives just a moment before Marsh does, his half of the project in his grasp. He listens to Marsh congratulate them, and give them a quick runthrough of her grading process before presenting a box in which they are to place their finished projects. He turns to Potter only long enough to take the other half of their papers, then orders them as he walks up to Marsh’s desk. He thanks her politely, and proceeds out the door, without even glancing back to the desk he’s shared with Potter all term. Maybe he’ll switch it up and make a new acquaintance when they resume next week.
bathroom don’t want to talk to me,” she glares at Scorpius, who is still staring at them both like a deer in wandlight.
A soft chime rings out from the clock on the wall and Potter jumps, eyes widening frantically as he realizes that it’s just turned six in the evening. “I have to go,” he gasps, stepping away and breaking the strange spell they’d both fallen under. “Fuck, I’m late. I’m sorry, we’ll finish…” he gestures to the notes and essays spread across Draco’s table, “later.”
The trend has become much more common among muggleborn and half-blood parents in recent years: sending their children to school where they can learn to understand their muggle heritage before attending Hogwarts. It’s unsurprising that Dean and Seamus elected to do so, since both of them were raised with muggle influences as children. Harry wonders sometimes if he should have sent Teddy, but his separation anxiety in those early years after the war was too intense, particularly when he was still hunting Death Eaters every day at work.
Of course, if Potter is bothered, he doesn’t show it. “I enjoy learning, actually. I’m no Hermione but…” he shrugs, looking out to the ocean with a hint of melancholy before looking back to Draco, green eyes still alight with excitement.
“Light, dark, earth, and love.” Potter looks up for confirmation, and Draco is oddly satisfied by how simple it is to take the lead with him. Had he expected a power struggle? He isn’t sure. He nods, and watches raven hair fall back over green eyes as Potter’s attention returns again to his reading. He stares for a moment, then another, then he opens his book on fundamentals of alchemy and slips into his own world.
“No. Earth magic is more of…a source, a base for other magic. Like...you know the standard potion base, it gives substance to a brew but doesn’t have any interaction with the other ingredients.” Potter nods as though in understanding, and Draco continues, “The earth is older than dark and light. It’s the standard base for almost all magic we know. It’s the other influences we pull into it, the ways we and other magical creatures twist it that make the light and dark. It’s the source of our cores, but also the source of many of the spells we cast, that’s why our wands-”
it, necessarily...but he’s intrigued. And annoyed that Potter and his shifty 5:30 obligations had stopped whatever
“Mr. Malfoy,” Minerva addresses her former student, stepping closer to the bed, “I assure you that we will get to the bottom of this. An investigation will be conducted at once, and the perpetrators will see consequences commensurate with the gravity of their actions.”
He’s expecting a snappy retort, something witty he can work with when Potter looks at him as though he’s said nothing and asks, “Did you know about fairy magic?”
Draco loses count, though he’s sure they don’t quite make it to ten - even with magic helping them along - before they fall asleep, pressed together in the dorm bed that is clearly meant for just one person.
He partially retracts that thought, however, as he turns to see Potter hastily jotting down notes, just barely making out the words “dark” and “conditioned” and “turning-point.” The reality that so much of him can be seen by someone else, by this specific someone else comes crashing back and he feels cold. He carefully watches Potter’s face for some sort of emotion, but sees only an academic focus there. He’s not sure if Potter’s hiding his emotions on purpose, but the man’s not been known to be subtle in the past…
as if realizing who he’s speaking to and shakes his head, “Sorry, it’s been a while since I’ve been around anyone who...
Draco offers him a thoughtful look and glances between him and Teddy, then meaningfully at the home around them, because it’s definitely more of a
“It’s alright. I...me too.” Draco admits, looking out to sea rather than at Potter’s face. “I came here to be away from all of that. To be normal, for a fresh start. After my parents....” he trails off, still gazing at the sparkling water. He doesn't need to explain, Potter surely knows how his father was killed in Azkaban, how a fellow disciple of the Dark Lord had taken out his anger about Lucius’s short sentence with his own bare hands, how Draco’s mother had faded away from a broken heart.
When class draws to a close, Draco carefully suggests that this more sensitive part of their project be completed in private. At least he can shield himself from prying eyes, unlike in the library or at the beach, even if there’s no stopping Potter from a free peek at his truest self.
“No one knows. It was on purpose. Some radical anti-death-eater-movement purposely set fire to the building,” she gasps out.
“It’s fine, I know,” I answer as I step through the door, “I need to speak with a house elf anyway.”
I sigh again, still glaring angrily at my innocent coffee, “I guess, that’s the best we can hope for.”
I smile back at her. We proceed to the living room in silence after that. Eventually I come to stand in front of the well-known door. It’s slightly ajar which allows me to watch Draco through the open space. I can’t help but smile at the picture he presents.
“It’s certainly a big part of it,” I give him a wry smile, “A lot of things would have been different if we would have become friends back then.”
“Well, you are going to sleep now. Draco is sleeping too for now and I will try my best to keep him calm should he wake up. You need sleep more than he does right now,” when I open my mouth to protest, the woman glares at me, “Don’t make me put you under with a spell.”
The same goes for any mistakes in HP lore. It's been some time since I last watched one of the movies and several years since I read the books.
About two days before this appointment I am interrupted by another rude ministry employee. Luckily this one has enough common sense to wait at the door until I open it. The moment I see the ministry standard clothing, I feel the urge to close the door in his face. Knowing that it will only anger the ministry further, I give an audible sigh and lean against the doorframe with crossed arms.
“Don’t. If you make a sound or approach him, you will startle him and he will certainly fall. You trusted him this far, you have to trust him now. That thing is not supposed to be used to get on a horse’s back but the steps are next to us and he didn’t want to go near us as long as he could help it,” she insists.
“Potter,” he glares at me, the animal behind him giving him a confidence boost, “Do you know where her care box is? I am perfectly capable of preparing her on my own.”
“I guess so. Usually he at least turns the head towards you when you try to speak to him. Do you want to get him out or should I?” he asks finally, not seeing any use of further calling anymore.
“I know and I told them that he’s not healthy enough for such a thing. They hardly listened however. They only said that if we can’t present a statement soon, the case would be closed.”
She scrutinises Draco for a moment then nods, “I agree,” her eyes fix on the nervous grey gaze, as she bows her head lightly, “Thank you for the answers. Let’s continue this some other time.”
“There is no punishment awaiting you if you give me my answer. I promise. Draco won’t be angry at you either. I only want to get him out of prison,” I urge, pleading with her, “Please Tilly. I want to help him, but I can’t if I don’t get any proof that he was the one who helped the prisoners. Please.”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” I whisper, pointing my wand at the shaking figure, “But you have to calm down. You’re hyperventilating and if I let this continue you will seriously hurt yourself. I’m sorry,” with a deep breath, I say the spell to force him to sleep.
Liar! Why didn’t you just tell me? I had to hear it from Orion happily telling his classmates that he finally got his mommy officially. That Lou finally married his father. He loves her to bits and she’s good for him. I hate her sometimes. But in all honesty I know I have no right to do so. I could have chosen to act differently. You could have too, but it’s all in the past now. There is no use in thinking about it now. And she seems like a nice woman as far as I could see. As long as you can be happy I will be content.
“From here we still need to search by hand,” Hermione gives me a smile before we separate and I hurry off into the night in search for Draco.
“I’m more surprised you don’t. That you still keep to your idealised views,” he shrugs, seeming nonchalant, despite the fact that he hasn’t relaxed in the least.
And if I walk past several pet shops on my way home to stare at their display of cats and kittens, Hermione doesn’t have to know. To be honest I am looking forward to getting a little furball as well. But it’s true that it’s still too early for Draco, so true to my friend’s advice I leave it at the stuffed dragon for now.
I startle as I was so focused on the animals that I didn’t notice someone approaching. When I whirl around I am confronted with a woman who looks to be in her early thirties. Soft gold blonde hair falls in easy curls over her shoulders. Her blue eyes are looking at me with a curious expression, but open and relaxed. She is wearing an apron with the name of the store printed across it, so I assume she is working here.
He cautiously peers over the small white cat in his hand and his eyes flit past me. He motions towards the fire still cackling green. He shakes his head nervously.
“No, he normally only does as we urge him to. He loves our cat but all in all he wavers mostly between extremely jumpy and half apathetic. I have never seen him as relaxed and active as he is right now,” I can’t avert my eyes from the other man’s form.
“He was there before the battle. Whether he fought, I can’t say, but I doubt it since I stole his wand and he lost his mother’s.”
“He really takes well to the horses,” she nods, “That’s Shenan. She’s a twelve year old palomino mare. She should fit your description well.”
isn’t the proper word for it….I met her myself just here, when I was in my second year. She flooded the corridor all the time back then. I think my visiting with her has helped her moods a little bit. She’s a nice girl, if you talk to her - just lonely. Everyone wants to have friends.”
“Nah. Never do.” Since Teddy’s first year, Harry has made a habit of signing on to stay in the castle over Christmas. The students that stay need some supervision, and there's little that Harry has ever loved more than Christmas at Hogwarts - particularly compared to returning to Grimmauld. “I’ve taken to hosting the Christmas feast for all the students that stay. Lot of them don’t have great homes to go to, better they can celebrate here, where they feel wanted.” Harry knows a little too intimately how that feels, the least he can do is help offer his students something that meant so much to him when he was in their place.
Monday brings the most interesting lesson they’ve had in Marsh’s class. She shows them - with herself as the example - how to create a projection of a magical core, and spends the rest of the class teaching them to dissect the different colours, their placement and what they mean. They’re surprised - or Draco is, at least - to see the vast section of deep blue pooled at the base of her core, indicating her extensive practice in alchemy, borderline dark magic. The rest of it is essentially light and neutral, silvery-white dotted with gold, red, green.
“Commonly used spells are just earth magic shaped and formed for a specific purpose, honed and repeated across centuries for the benefit...or sometimes the detriment of our kind.”
When he arrives at the hospital wing, it’s nearly empty, with just one girl sleeping soundly in a bed by the door, and a flurry of activity at the far end, a white privacy partition blocking his view.
Hearing those sentiments, Harry can imagine them coming from Lucius and Narcissa’s mouths, the pair of them lecturing this boy on how to live his life, even as just a child.
Even before the kiss Harry spent nearly all of his mealtimes with Draco, and that doesn’t change, except it does.  Lunch in the great hall filled with polite conversation about work and the weather, becomes lunch in Harry’s office, or dinner in Draco’s rooms, and discussions about their days, their students, their likes and their dislikes, their hopes and fears, and everything in between.
One day I’ll actually write a fic where Harry is a wand maker because I’m obsessed with that concept *dreamy sigh*
It’s strange to see Malfoy so open and genuine, Harry feels as though he’s imposing on something private. “Madam Pomfrey, the Headmist-”
Concern clouds his features as the patronus fades, and he’s on his feet in an instant, “Duty calls, then,” he murmurs to Dean before heading from the room, willing himself to tamp down the panic brewing in his chest until he knows the situation.
He strolls along the street as the sun sets, a riot of colour in a now clear sky. There’s a bonfire on the wizarding beach closest to campus, a welcome from the University for the newest students.
He finds Potter already waiting in the university library, which is as opposite to the Hogwarts library as anything Draco could imagine. It’s spacious, modern, full of square tables surrounded by chairs on casters with seat cushions of bright blue, green, and orange, and despite the wall of glass illuminating the space, there’s not a fleck of dust in the air to be seen.
“You’ll be very good at that,” comes Potter’s honest reply, and it’s like a breath of fresh air. Acceptance that yes, he has things to make up for, and yes, he’s perfectly capable of doing it.
Escape from years of his life spiralling out of his control, the war that changed everything, the trials where his parents, his only family, slipped through his fingers. From his father’s quick death in Azkaban to his mother’s slow descent into depression, caged in a home that leeched joy from her soul more than any dementor ever could. From the fact that his own miraculous freedom was bought by Potter’s own words of defense…
Draco doesn’t understand Potter’s position exactly, but by all accounts, while they knew about the war here, it was something distant, foreign, something that happened somewhere else. That was the draw of it for Draco, no one to know his face or his name and judge him before he had a chance to change their minds.
Harry has a way of making him feel like the world isn’t quite as finished with him as Draco would like to think.
Shortly after the first time, Harry excused himself, hot and cold and fit to burst with excitement and newness and joy.
“Thankfully, they’re not,” Draco stage whispers cheerfully to Teddy, who grins and babbles some nonsense in response.
Draco groans into Harry’s mouth, opening up to his tongue and their kiss turns fast and frantic, and all he can think is more, more, as he drags his mouth down Harry’s neck and finally gets his lips on that chest, dropping to his knees and kissing a path down to toned abs, the muscles fluttering against his lips as Draco’s hands follow suit and fiddle with the buckle of his belt, the button on his jeans… He thinks he hears a soft whimper as he finally pulls the jeans away, tugging them down tan thighs and leaving Harry in only his white cotton boxers.
Harry tilts his head, and he must see something in Draco’s face because the corner of his mouth turns up in the tiniest smile and he tentatively steps forward, “You’re not upset about the notes?” he asks, almost teasingly, and Draco shakes his head and swallows thickly because now Potter is
Draco finds that he very much likes this idea, and follows Potter’s lead, pushing the hem of his shirt up to his armpits, hands wandering over planes of solid abs and pectorals and salivating with his desire to put his mouth on them.
Harry barks out a laugh, “Oh, don’t worry, she’d have my hide if I didn’t turn up for lunch with the family. We’ve worked out a routine over the years.”
He strolls over to the table where Potter is slouched over a text, his feet flat on the floor, his nervous energy only showing itself in the way he rolls the wheels of his shockingly orange chair back a few centimetres then forward again, all without breaking his concentration on his reading.
Draco snorts again, “I don’t speak a word of Spanish,” he states, feeling the amusement stretch his features, “well, that’s not strictly true, I know a few phrases.”
They work up to a routine, spending Saturdays in the library mining the texts there for data and information, occasionally trading comments on the content of their notes, all shuffling paper and nearly companionable silence until Potter suddenly has to leave at 5:30 each day for what Draco assumes is the same mysterious obligation. They build up a repository that is more than enough to begin executing their essays on each type of magic and the way it affects a human core.
Harry gasps softly, his eyes going a little distant, ”I think I might have an idea,” He strides over to a bookshelf on the wall and pulls out an old-looking tome, “I found this after we saw our cores...I wanted to know more about that magic, not just love but, you know, family.”
“Your...oh.” Draco looks between them, and the dark circles under Harry’s eyes make sense now. “You’re doing this on your own?”
Dean smiles, “That’s lovely, Harry. I’m surprised Molly Weasley lets you get away with missing Christmas, though.”
Draco ponders this for a moment, pushing his embarrassment at being caught in his discomfort aside to consider. He might as well get it over with. The pure gold of Potter’s core will be too hard to follow.
Sanctum, of course, is a loose term. Draco’s university housing is small and plain, but he can’t complain too much. He has a small kitchen area, a dining table that can fit two almost comfortably, and a bed with his trunk at the end and a wardrobe to one side. It reminds him the slightest bit of his wedge of the Slytherin boys’ dormitory, but not enough to be painful.
“It’s not what I was looking for, really, but there’s a kind of family magic that grows in the oldest of bloodlines…” he trails off as his eyes dance across a page of the book then shiftback up at Draco and Teddy. “The more witches and wizards in a family, the more powerful the familial bond. You’ve got blood from one of the largest magical families on record, Teddy does too.”
The headmistress turns pained eyes on him, “A cursed stone. Slipped into his bag, we believe. It has been secured in my office for now. I would like you to examine it later, call in any ministry contacts you need.”
Draco didn’t point out that wizards don’t get cancer.) and Draco finds it difficult to stop looking at him, for some reason. Maybe because even Potter is easier to read than his handwriting, or because it’s foreign to see unprotected green eyes drag across a page with such interest, or maybe because a droplet of sweat rolls from just behind his ear down his neck, leaving an easily traceable path down dark skin pulled taut over tendons that flex as he swallows.
Harry grins back. “Good luck today. You’ll do great. Your team is behind you, you’ve built a good one, you’ve practised like crazy.”
With a soft sigh, Harry makes his way over to the boy, whose gaze has fallen back to his shoes, shiny and black and perfectly polished. Harry presses his back to the wall and slides down to sit on the bathroom floor next to his student.
Minerva, for her part, hasn’t mentioned the Deputy Headmaster position again, to Harry’s great relief. She has, however, been giving him a certain look when they pass in the hallway. A look that says, ‘
The stormy sky is not a good omen on this, his first day of university classes. Didn’t he elect to attend school on the balmy coast of Spain because the weather was supposed to improve his mood? No dreary English summer for him, not this year.
Potter doesn’t seem to mind it either, after getting over his apparent surprise at Draco’s suggestion. He’d arrived with a towel of his own, in swim trunks and a “t-shirt” for what Draco guesses to be some muggle band, and had easily taken Draco’s stack of notes when the blonde suggested that they read up on each other’s findings.
” He’d noticed, of course, that Potter wasn’t using the wand he’d disarmed from the Dark Lord, but he just thought that was part of laying low. The elder wand drew attention.
He keeps pace with Harry, twisting his hand this way and that, just how he does when he’s alone - and it’s appreciated if the way Harry’s hand stutters and a moan rumbles in his chest is anything to go by. All too soon, Draco is close, their kisses turn into panting against one another’s mouths, and Harry shifts them, his free hand leaving crescent moon marks from his fingernails in the skin of Draco’s bicep as it trails down to pull Draco’s hips closer, to align their cocks and lace their fingers and stroke both of them together.
That is what brings them to the beach this Saturday, Draco sprawled on his stomach on a towel, trying to make sense of Potter’s very tiny scrawl in between pondering the possibility of
She gestures to Draco who looks shocked and then immediately smug, “Who am I to deny a bride on her wedding day?” he asks, taking her hand and spinning her away. Harry watches them for a moment, chuckling, before Teddy appears at his side, a conspiratorial grin on his face.
“Is it different from what you expected?” The question is reasonable, though Draco hadn’t expected it. He opens and closes his mouth once or twice before sighing and shaking his head.
Her eyes narrow and her gaze shifts back to Harry. He’s never been very good at keeping secrets from Hermione, or Ron and Ginny, for that matter. He opens and closes his mouth, bracing himself for this unplanned reveal.
Draco grudgingly makes plans to meet with Potter on the weekend. The bloody prat insisted that evenings didn’t suit his schedule.
Class proceeds with the rest of last week’s lecture on types of magic, each of which they’ll explore further as the term moves along. Draco furiously scribbles notes, and he notices that today, Potter is too. He likes to think he can take credit for seriously saving Potter’s education.
Professor Marsh makes her grand entrance at exactly the right moment, announcing that she’ll be assigning their first major project today. She’s speaking in rapid Spanish, but what Draco hears is English with an accent distinct to the translation magic in his ears. Potter is hearing the same, if the way his jaw has dropped open minutely is any indication.
“Right, well, we can get this over with, then.” He says flatly, doing his best to conceal how he very much does not want to get it over with, simply because he’d rather not do it at all. Of course, he’s not going to fail the assignment, so he has to make himself participate despite the way his chest tightens, as though his ribs are curling protectively around his core.
