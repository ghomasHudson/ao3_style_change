my wand, Malfoy," Harry smirked. "And shut up.”
“You,” he scowled, narrowing his eyes to gimlet slits and mentally trying to fry Harry’s stupidly long eyelashes off, “really are a massive pain in my bum, Potter. Believe me when I tell you that I am exercising every polite muscle in my body to restrain myself from kicking you out of my bed. I am not so much ‘ticked off’ as ‘mortally offended’. There's a difference, you know.”
Draco waved a languid hand, as if this entire occasion had really been only accidental and not something he'd felt far too driven to make happen. A sour feeling filled his gut, and for no good reason at all. Potter meant nothing by his unasked for confession; it was merely unfortunate small talk, that was all. Best to not think upon it, really. Perhaps he was being unreasonable. He turned himself about, ready to bid Harry adieu, focusing as best as he could manage on his friend's familiar features, his top-notch suit, his air of inexplicably filling a space he was always meant to be. It was fine. All of it. Typical of them, really, given that they'd always had the habit of telling each other the blunt, hard truth.
Silly git, Draco thought fondly, to be so worked up over a mere walk to the local watering hole.
“Of course I am, darling,” his mother tinkled sweetly, shaking her sun-kissed head. “My 'bird' is highly vouched for. He's most definitely in Town, even if you've not heard official word of it yet. Strange, that. I'd have thought--"
"Argh!"
“Shut
"How can I?" he'd asked of his old friend—no, demanded. "He's not interested, alright? Not in me, at least."
"Ummm…" Harry hummed, all obvious, as if entirely unaware Draco was nearing a dangerous state of implosion, flinging his jangling keys towards the bowl by the Floo pot table. Draco refrained from glaring holes in the clumsy git when they missed it completely and skittered nosily across the floor, as he so wished to do.
“Because?” Draco prodded. “What, Potter.”
haunted, you tosser! That was Professor Lupin, I tell you—he's a werewolf!"
Harry grimaced, darkly, thumping a fist against the sprawled open book. "Bloody hell," he grimaced. "Take a whole five minutes to say so, why don't you? Was just a simple question, Draco. So…she is gone, right? It's too late?"
It really was rather nice effect, Harry decided. Weasleyish, yes, weirdly enough, but also..also
"Jera
“What?”
"Love!"

He’d never felt that…unsure before, had he? Over…Potter?
"Shut up," Draco snapped in his ear. "I did not bawl, Potter. I did no such thing."
Harry had become rather adept at counting, although that was only a side benefit. He'd become far more facile at puzzling out meanings from what, to an untrained eye, all too often appeared like the scratchings of enormous viciously taloned birds. But that was generally the ones on the Stones, standing. There were plenty of other sorts of runes, some to be found scribed in ancient reed or skin parchments, some to be found on tomb or cavern walls (those two ofttimes one and the same) and some which were only but fair copies of long-lost runes, meticulously transcribed, culled from scholarly Wizarding writings, grimoires and journals.
“I know you want to know,” Malfoy says, mellow. Harry barely even notes that it’s happened again—Malfoy guessing his thoughts. “And I get it. If you’d disappeared and come back after five years, I’d want to know, too.” He laughs. “In fact, I’d be pestering you about it constantly.”
Chandra dismisses him with a flick of her wrist. “Anyway, it’s a bit of a leap, so we can’t quite narrow down our list of suspects just yet. But it’s something to keep in mind.”
Harry sips his wine. “Pinot gris?” he asks.
“You see, Harry,” Mr Diggory says in a light, contemplative tone that instantly sends chills down Harry’s spine, “I asked you nicely. Many times. But you kept ignoring me.”
Chandra sighs. “I’m not saying you’re necessarily wrong. I just—you guys have history, and I’m trying to go about this as rationally as I can. Understand?”
“Drink up.”
And that’s what finally makes Narcissa’s expression shift, although only slightly; she sighs and closes her eyes briefly. “I suppose you could say that, yes. He’s out. He has been for the better part of four years.”
Harry shakes his head. Malfoy nods. “I don’t think so either. But... people were kind to me. Not everyone. But it was the default, rather than the odd one out. Which—yeah.” He laughs a little, shakes his head, “I guess that’s why I used to despise you so much. I think. You caught me off guard, and I wasn’t equipped against it. I wasn’t at all.”
“And you,” says Harry. He stares at Malfoy’s door long after it’s closed.
They’re complete opposites—Harry doesn’t at all feel connected to how he looks, unless he wants to impress someone. Most of his clothes he’s owned for years. Half of Malfoy’s
“Hold your horses, Potter.” Malfoy dries his hands on the cloth hanging from the oven door handle. “If I’m to make my grand return, you can bet your ass I’m going to be looking breathtaking.” He starts towards his room. “Give me thirty, yes?” he asks, then closes the door without waiting for an answer.
“If he told you anything about the future, don’t tell me. This… this is unprecedented. We have no idea of the magnitude of the damage he’s done to the timeline by coming back to the past and killing those people. The folks over at Mysteries are handling it, but they told me flat out that they can’t tell us anything other than the fact that Diggory is confined and that he’s not going anywhere. And you both have to take a Vow of Secrecy. Tomorrow. I told them you were both exhausted and needed to sleep now.”
“Wine.” Malfoy smiles. A slow, crooked one. A devastating one.
Harry nods and scowls at Malfoy’s perfect pronunciation. He stands rigidly against the thrumming that grows under his skin at Malfoy’s newfound friendliness, his physical closeness.
“Alright,” Chandra says, rolling her eyes. “Let’s start with the obvious. Someone could be playing a prank on you.”
Malfoy nods, relief relaxing some of the tension in his mouth. Harry tries to think of what to say; it has to be something of equal value to Malfoy’s thing, something he’s not comfortable saying.
With each reverberating sound, Harry’s heart beats just a bit stronger and faster. He takes a deep breath. He feels hyper-aware of his every move, and although Draco is not looking at him, Harry is afraid he’ll somehow figure out what’s happening. That Harry is trembling with the sound of Draco’s voice, the movement of his fingers on the guitar. That he’s so in love with him it makes him dizzy.
Unsurprisingly, the emphasis of the article is on the heinous acts of
, he hopes his nod conveys that Malfoy has nothing to worry about.
“I think it’s high time.” Malfoy smiles into his wine glass, his eyes still on Harry. “Don’t you?”
“Are you out of your mind?” is what Malfoy asks him.
“Fuck off, Malfoy.” Harry rolls his eyes. But he can’t deny the weakness of his voice, or how his cheeks heat instantly at having been caught staring, or how forced he feels his own eyeroll to be.
He thinks of the one thing that makes sense, really; the one thing that has settled over his chest post-war like a hauberk.
Harry’s heart skips. “Yeah?”
He waves an arm in front of him, like he doesn’t want to say more on it, like he knows Harry will understand anyway. And he does. “But I’d never let myself dwell on them before. You know? There was no time for it, no space for anything. Just hatred, at first. Then fear.”
Draco throws his hands in the air. “But
“Where are we apparating from?” Malfoy asks instead of answering.
Harry tries to think of a way to discreetly confirm it is Malfoy they are both talking about, but he can’t think of one that wouldn’t add to this girl’s—Katie, the postbox says—suspicions about him, so he decides against it.
to. And Harry is perfectly fine with that, he really is.
Malfoy makes tea without a word, Harry sets the table, and then Malfoy does a tiny, happy little dance when he bites into his first crêpe, and Harry’s chest floods with warmth so quickly he gets shivers from it. And he knows, with a sudden clarity that makes his breath hitch, that Malfoy is letting his guard down for him.
Harry doesn’t know when Draco started going through his vinyl collection, only that the second bottle of wine is almost empty now, and they’re both sitting on the floor in front of the sofa.
He smiles a little, flicking his eyes up at Harry before looking away again. “She preferred Muggle music, too. I don’t think she ever thought anything of it, though. For her, that was just coincidental. Most people would stop and think—wonder if that means Muggles weren’t so bad after all. She didn’t.” His face twists. “Clearly,
“I don’t need protection from the bloody Auror Department, Potter,” Malfoy interrupts.
Harry exhales. “Yes,” he says. “Okay.”
With increasing panic and horror, Harry looks on as Draco rises from the ground, a bright orange beam of light pulling him away.
They talk about the case; Malfoy tells him a little bit about his life in London, but never France. They laugh, sometimes. All in all, it’s not strained, but it’s also not something better or warmer than that.
And so they get to work.
Chandra volunteered herself on Friday to interview some people today, and that comes in incredibly handy for Harry right now, because he doesn’t think he’s capable of leaving his flat today. They order pizza and settle on the couch and watch Ice Age. It’s Draco’s favourite film, apparently, and Harry has to physically fight the fondness that overcomes him when he tells him that.
“Harry, no!”
Harry’s heart stutters. “Used to?”
They’re in the graveyard in Little Hangleton. In the exact same spot Cedric died all those years ago.
So while Harry and Chandra work on the case, he sits by the window in the little meeting room, reading a book. Under the light of the unusually sunny sky, the white in his hair is more apparent.
Draco gasps dramatically. “Red Hot Chili Peppers!”
The bloke turns to him. “What can I get you?”
They eat dinner in silence. Harry did his best to cook something good that is vegetarian but that also isn’t his Arrabbiata, because playing that card twice would be lame. Draco goes to smoke on the balcony after dinner. His words keep echoing in Harry’s head.
“It’s how I like it,” Malfoy says, still quiet. He’s sitting with his feet up on the chair, knees bent, both hands wrapped around his mug. He’s looking at the table.
“Utter shite? So does that mean you regret it?”
They sit quietly for a while. They look at each other sometimes, but mostly at the table. Malfoy rests his chin on his knees. Harry pinches his bottom lip, rolling it between his thumb and forefinger.
“My aunt and uncle kept it from me,” Harry says, and thinks,
“Besides,” Malfoy says, “it’d be a sin to go back home without anyone seeing me, after I’ve put all this effort into looking stunning.”
“Why didn’t you just come after me? Why did those people have to die?”
So they do, Harry sitting in one corner of the U-shaped sofa by the window, Draco with his back against the other armrest, legs outstretched towards Harry.
“When I was a kid, the thing that kept me going was that my life wouldn’t have to be that way forever. I wouldn’t have to live the way I did, with those particular people. That one day, I could choose my own family, my own home, my own everything.”
Then he remembers Narcissa’s desperation all those years ago—how she forced Snape to take an Unbreakable Vow to protect him. And her only ambition during the Battle of Hogwarts—finding her son, overshadowing fear and loyalty. Her pleading letter, and her hysterical shout when she thought Harry would leave without taking on the case. He has to admit to himself that if anyone would notice if Malfoy wasn’t being himself, it would be her.
“Unusual floor plan for an old English flat,” Malfoy says.
lead anywhere.
He was wrong. So wrong. Making breakfast for Malfoy, sitting together at Harry’s small kitchen table, does not feel like the start of whatever the fuck he thought it would be the start of. It just feels weird and uncomfortable and out of place. Well, Malfoy does, specifically.
He finds himself thinking about that every time he wakes up, in that very moment. Like he was already dreaming about it before he awoke. He feels strange, out of place. He doesn’t know what quality to assign to Malfoy’s presence; to his job to protect him. He doesn’t know how he feels about it all, the morality of it, their history, Malfoy’s strangeness and what that means, everything. But around three a.m., when he’s drifting off again for the umpteeth time, the thought occurs to him that it doesn’t really matter if he doesn’t know what to think, as long as he knows what he needs to do.
“Crêpes?” he asks, excited.
Harry doesn’t want to imagine it, Malfoy waking up face-down, pillow squishing his cheeks rosy, but he does, because he’s an idiot who makes the worst decisions. Decisions like letting the very person into his home who’s been splitting his brain in half since he was a teenager—dancing on the sidelines of his desire and lurking among the dark shadows he never wants to remember at the same time.
And as the ugliness spreads from his torso to his limbs, and the hand keeps ripping away at his wounds, he knows that they never were forgotten. They never were tended to. They were hidden, terrified, waiting for something to come along and expose them for their vulnerability.
“No, it’s—it’s not that,” Draco whispers, “No, it’s—Harry... do you not...
Malfoy sighs, deep and long-suffering. “You know, it—it doesn’t seem fair in the least that you get to interrogate me like I’m a suspect here or something, whilst not returning the favour.”
He thinks,
“All I know is that you’ve been acting like you’re another person entirely since the War.” They both flinch; but Harry propels on, fuelled by the whiskey in his blood. “But I haven’t the slightest clue why. I know you’ve developed a sense for Muggle fashion, apparently. That you live in Muggle London and haven’t set foot in the wizarding world for quite some time. That you sing in a dingy Muggle pub—”
“Oh, but Harry, that’s all I’ve been thinking about. That’s all I’ve been thinking about for years. And I tried, I really tried to go about it the nice way. I came to you, I asked for your help, but you refused. Pretended like you had nothing to do with the fact that my son was dead. That you had no responsibility to help me bring him back. But it’s all your fault, Harry. And you’re getting what you deserve.”
“No,” is all Harry says. He can’t bring himself to explain it further than that; he doesn’t have the energy to not bring his feelings into it, and he doesn’t want Chandra’s face to turn all knowing and pitying.
Some distant part of his brain registers that Draco is laughing at him, and it tells him, with a defeated little sigh, that Draco must know now how Harry feels about him. There are quiet little questions there that he pays little attention to, like
"It is." Draco cut him off firmly, and put every effort into keeping his features rigidly under control. "And yes, I meant tomorrow, Potter. Naturally. When else would I mean, git?"
How odd?
And because of that—and a whole host of other related items, such as no one wanting to dwell too much on what—
Harry elbowed Ron a second time, irritation growing. “Seamus, too, Ron. You heard him.”
For there was nothing worse, as Draco was actively discovering, that being a nineteen year old man forcibly thrust into the act of confessing the details of his suddenly rather torrid love life to his own mother. Well, not by any means all the details—Draco flushed a deeper shade of rose pink, blinking hurriedly—but enough. It was literally worse even than Draco's enforced cowering before a hideous Dark Lord or his suffering the torments of an unrequited passion for Potter all these years; it was more ludicrously unsettling than his horrible awkwardness over the feathery appendages his unfortunate paternal ancestry had thrust upon him.
Nor heart, either. Draco was long past pulling Harry's chain in other ways; hadn't mentioned his Mum in ages. Likely never would again, after what his own Mum had done, either. That was alright, then.
“No, no,” Millie giggled, dumping everything down upon Harry’s blotter. Being as deft as she was sharp, not a drop spilt nor a missive was lost to the updraft from the small fire crackling away merrily  in Harry’s hearth. “Arse. I meant that it’s the topic of the day, apparently, going by what I’m seeing coming though the post from Antwerp. I rather think your gentleman friend over there has a bit of a pash for you. He’s certainly eager to consult on the slightest of prevarications.”
“You can also ask me,” Draco says into the silence.
Despite his inner voice of increasing volume the closer he gets to actually doing what he’s about to, he still does it: he Apparates to Malfoy Manor after a final gulp of lukewarm coffee, and he can’t say he’s surprised when the black gates, all chipped paint and rusty hinges, sluggishly creak open in front of him without a word. He takes a deep breath before stepping onto the gravel path leading to the Manor.
Subtly enough that Harry isn’t sure it’s not his imagination, Malfoy rolls his eyes. Then he clears his throat and asks, “Where am I to sleep, then?”
“I—I don’t—” is all he manages, and his voice shakes. His hands shake, too, when he tries to lift them. This is quite possibly the most nervous he’s ever been in his entire life.
The song Draco sings is Landslide by Fleetwood Mac!
“Chandra,” Harry says, embarrassed. “Where’s Diggory now? Do we—do we know what he wanted? Why he did this?”
like chicken. I said it’s used as a less carbon-intensive
An understanding that his oddness about the murders has nothing to do with him being involved; just him growing, and his growth being stuck on the idea that he deserves to be punished.
Quote at the beginning of the chapter—from Demian by Hermann Hesse
But Narcissa is right. He is the Harry Potter who, despite it all, turns the other cheek. And he is too exhausted, too hurt to dwell on whether that is because he’s irredeemably good or because he’s irredeemably vain.
Slowly, Malfoy turns around. “What?” he breathes.
“Yeah,” Draco breathes. He rises off his knees again. Harry meets him halfway, reaching his hand out and grasping the back of Draco’s neck. His hair is soft. His lips are soft, too—Harry brushes his own against them, just for a second, then pulls back to look at him, and his stomach flips at the sight. Draco is tilting his face towards him, eyes closed and mouth slightly open.
“That’s going to be a bloody long list,” Harry says, sighing.
Malfoy just keeps looking at him with that aloof expression. “I’m not going to lie to you, Malfoy. There are certainly people out there who are overjoyed about these murders.”
Malfoy looks up, slightly annoyed, like he’s been expecting the reaction but still didn’t want to see it. Harry can’t help the little puff of laughter that escapes him. He holds his hands up apologetically.
While they are waiting for a full list of the victims’ associates, Chandra builds the psychological profile, and Harry tries to compile a list of people who might be in danger. Robards made sure to emphasise that their first priority was to send owls to all of them, warning them to be careful.
Draco seems to consider that before saying, looking at the table in front of him, “Well, maybe—maybe you are. Chasing a ghost, I mean.”
“But you did,” Harry’s mouth blurts without his own permission. Malfoy looks at him, carefully intrigued. He propels on. “Malfoy, you were ten years old. How were you supposed to realise such a thing? Did you even know it was Muggle music she was playing you?”
Harry raises his eyebrows. “What’s this?”
“Absolutely not,” Malfoy cuts in. He has calmed down, now looking oddly reserved; his face is carefully neutral, his words unfaltering but emotionless. “Now, if you’ll excuse me,” he says, and with that, he turns towards the door, apparently deeming the discussion over.
“Anything else?”
”Hi Draco. Lovely to see you again.” The younger of the two women says. She has long, light brown hair, partially pinned back, and eyes that match Scorp’s. She’s not much shorter than Draco, and appears to be the same age as him. Despite this, she looks beautiful, make up perfectly applied to her heart shaped face and an outfit that accentuates her subtle curves.
As we made our way into the lounge, I nervously pulled at my sleeves.
When Ron saw me, he looked heartbroken.
"So I left. When you were sing-songing about the dress you were going to wear, I left. I turned into a cat and ran. Ran as far as I could when I reached Draco's café. Maybe it was some twist of fate that led me here exactly, I'm not sure. But the months that I've spent here have been exceedingly better than the years I spent with you."
Harry doesn’t know what Malfoy is trying to prove. If he’s even trying to prove something. So he just nods, and they Apparate.
Malfoy is in Harry’s kitchen, his flat, his safe haven; he doesn’t allow anyone but Ron and Hermione  to be here, because they’re the only ones he trusts to be careful enough not to flood his safe space with memories of loss and bereavement.
She grins that lopsided grin of hers; the one that had Harry tripping over his own words in the beginning of their partnership, in that initial phase when you don’t yet quite know if you’ll grow attracted to a person or not. “Don’t worry, Potter, you didn’t fail at being Best And Most Conscientious Auror Ever Who Knows About Everything. The investigation was undercover. I was called in to consult.”
Harry looks away, staring at his distorted reflection in the metal railing on the lift wall, jaw clenched.
Malfoy.
He doesn’t talk to Chandra or Robards or anyone else about what happened; he wouldn’t know what to say without sounding unreasonable. Instead, he gathers himself the next morning and Apparates to Lewisham, deciding to wing it, like he does many things in life. He tried for years to be more prepared and less spontaneous, but he’d realised after a while that it almost never made the outcome better—only made him feel worse and strained and not himself.
Maybe Malfoy doesn’t think so much about it, Harry can’t tell, and he doesn’t want to make it weird by bringing it up. But he can’t help the feeling that they share in this, the strangeness of it all.
he adds in his head. “Talk, Malfoy. Otherwise this isn’t going to work.”
When they are back home and eating dinner, Harry thinks about the growing greediness he feels for knowing things about Malfoy. He wants to fill the silence with more details, wants to uncrack the mystery sitting in front of him in a Muggle hoodie.
, do you understand what—” He buries his face in his hands.
Chandra nods.
Harry sighs. “Do you like lowering your head whenever you walk past the only person who’s going to be in your immediate vicinity for the foreseeable future? Spending most of your time awkwardly trying to avoid interactions with them?”
Harry puts his tea down. “I don’t think you have anything to do with the murders,” he says slowly. “I might have—I did, for a while. Or rather, I thought you might be hiding something. If you haven’t noticed, you’ve changed your tune quite a bit since I last saw you. And as a matter of fact, yes, Malfoy, I actually expect you to believe I’m trying my best to keep you safe.”
“Did you make me a copy?”
“Yeah?” Harry whispers back. Draco’s hands come down from around his neck and grab his belt buckle.
“When have I ever,” Malfoy says, quiet. He doesn’t address anything else that Harry said, and honestly, Harry is getting more than used to it; he expects it, now.
Malfoy wordlessly crosses over to him and holds his arm out. Harry looks at him for a long second, and even if he feels like putting it into words would go against
“So... your mother played you Muggle music? That’s… surprising.”
Draco laughs. “At the shop earlier. Once again, your observational skills have proven stellar. You might have been too busy comparing two nearly identical brands of treacle tart, though.” He smiles sweetly, and Harry is still not used to that—the soft-edged way Draco has taken to teasing him, lacking venom and malice. And Harry supposes they’re getting there—when he won’t think about how they used to hurt each other every time it happens.
“And from then, it really was just pure luck. I came here to check on you, and you weren’t here. Then I saw the letter. It was right there on the floor by the window. I cast a revealing charm on it, and it was a Portkey. Unlike the other Portkeys we found, this one was one-way. The others were used to lure the victims to a secluded spot, then to transport their bodies back with the same Portkey. The letter was a one-way Portkey that was charmed to return to its original location after it was used.”
“Malfoy,” Harry says slowly, stunned. “How long have you been a vegetarian for?”
, his mind echoes—Malfoy looks soft. Like the hard, deliberate lines of him, the way he guards himself and polices his every move have been washed more candid, more tender by the Firewhiskey.
“When did you even get that?”
“You knew him.”
—Harry’s eyebrows rise when he gets to the middle of the second page.
But on some level, he knows that Malfoy knows this, and on a whole different level, his own promise occurs to him: that he will stop this train of tender thoughts and focus on his job. This is definitely outside of the bounds of that. So instead, he just smiles. He smiles normally, not too bright and not too intimate, just friendly, exuding professionalism.
And it still hits Harry like a freight train sometimes, especially in moments like this. Because despite the clothes and the attitude, Draco looks more himself now than he has this entire past week, and that makes Harry think of that dramatic contrast all the more.
Shocked, Harry just stands there for a few moments, unmoving, before he realises that a shard of ceramic from the shattered mug is wedged between the door and the doorstep, so it’s not fully closed. He pushes it in, acting on instinct.
of happiness have been robbed from you, the one person—”
As Malfoy absentmindedly reaches up to tuck a lock of hair behind his ears, Harry realises that his hands are shaking.
“I think, you know, I experienced the world like most people do. For the first time. I never knew... I never thought about how odd my life was, in the—the grand scheme of things. Compared to how most people live. How they experience life. How I had experienced it until that... I never
“I’m so angry,” he says, and it comes out so awkward and out of place that he can feel the back of his neck tingle with a flush. But Malfoy doesn’t laugh or sneer, just nods slightly, encouraging him to go on. “Like… all the time. My entire life, I have been waiting for... a catharsis of sorts, I guess. And it just… it just hasn’t happened.” He swallows, unsure how to continue. He stares at the wooden knife holder on the countertop behind Malfoy.
”I’ve got a surprise for you later, daddy.” I say, before softly pressing my lips to his. “You could call it a thank you for this evening.”
Harry was waiting to ask the question again once Draco left his bedroom, once again as he left the apartment for work. When Draco came home for his lunch break, Harry was eager and waiting to ask once more. Then again when Draco returned home that evening, when they were having dinner, and when they were watching a muggle TV show.
Harry pulled his coat around him, shivering as he trudged in through the snow as it surrounded him in flurries, lost on a street he only vaguely recognised. The car had broken down some way back and no recovery vehicle could get out in the snow. His only option was walking.
"If you say so." Draco shrugged off Harry's strange atmosphere, getting changed as Harry tentatively clambered into the bed, careful not to look at Draco.
Harry did as told and soon found the bathroom at the end of the hallway. He entered, seeing Draco had left already, and was hit by a wall of the scent of lavender and lemongrass. The steam in the room was quick to fog up his glasses and he stepped into the piping hot bath, sighing loudly in content.
He picked up a book from his small collection, laying on the sofa with the kitten curled in his lap as he read through the evening.
”Teeth, baby. Watch out for your teeth.” I return to my ministrations, and reach a hand to play with his balls. “Fuck,” he moans, dragging out the word. “I’m close, baby.” He doesn’t give me much warning before grabbing my head and pulling my down on him until my nose is buried in his pubes. I splutter but can’t move back as I feel him release down my throat. He moans loudly, slowly pulling me off him as he cums. I taste him on my tongue, a bitterly, salty taste and I swallow quickly. I give his dick a few licks, cleaning off some cum from the tip. He leans down, grabbing arm and making me stand before pulling my onto his lap. I straddle him awkwardly, my cheeks flushed.
"You've never mentioned this before."
”Hey Scorp. You good?” A slight pause. “I’m fine. Look, you think you’d be able to stay at your mother’s tonight? Need to bring Harry back for a day or so.” His lips purse in thought and he spares a glance to me. He mouths ‘stay quiet’ to me, before seamlessly sliding a hand down my trousers, where he immediately begins to rub my clit. “Stay for a couple nights if you want, you know she loves having you over.” A short pause before he lets out a laugh. The rubbing on my crotch doesn’t stop and I begin to let out short pants of breath. “Thanks Scorp. You know I wouldn’t unless it was an emergency.” Emergency? “Love you.” He hangs up and I let out a small moan. I feel the heat building inside of me.
"Yes. Yes you are."
"Of course, babe. Actually, you mind if I come in for a second?"
ko-fi.com/grayginger2020
He hadn’t heard from the Granger-Weasleys again, nor from the She-Weasel, but he had been in touch with Millie.
Harry was silent for a minute and Draco watched him collect his thoughts.
”Just yours, daddy.” I whimper, lost in a haze of pleasure. By some will of the Gods, I climax as he does, pleasure shooting through my body as he covers my insides with ropes of cum.
When I walked into the station after my days off, I noticed an odd atmosphere about the place. The officers around me were quieter than usual, people making odd glances at each other.
"Don't. He's- a runner found me and called the police. They got DNA from... me. I went to a line-up this morning and he's in holding now. They're just waiting for the DNA match."
”Wow, baby. So turned on for me. I bet you’d love to be filled with my cock, wouldn’t you?”
Draco spun on his heel and headed to his room, with Harry quickly gathering his thoughts and scrambling to catch up with the blond.
”Can you do one thing for me?” He asks as I’m about to leave. I turn to face him. “You and Draco need to make it official.” He winks, before turning to unpack.
As Draco Malfoy of all people opened the door, Harry realised he would have been safer if he'd carried on walking home.
"Of course I'll have you, daddy." I wink. "At least now I can tell Teddy it's official." I laugh.
Harry shrugged, "gut instinct. Got me through life, really. I finished late at work anyway and no one's at home waiting for me so," he shrugged again.
”It’s my T injections. I’m a couple days late because I got so wrapped up in... us. Sorry for not saying anything.” A sneeze escaped, making Draco smile at me.
”My badass bottom, huh?” I sigh contently as he begins to press kisses on each scar on my chest, even the two that were supposed to be there. He deftly slips my belt off, making quick work of pulling my trousers down so I’m left in just my boxers. He sees the lump in my boxers and cocks an eyebrow at me.
I sat. My trousers at my knees, my boxers bundled amongst them. Tear tracks on my face. Bruises all along my arms and legs and hips and waist. No voice left. No motive left.
"My perfect little princess."
Also Goyle getting kicked in the nuts.
"That was amazing baby. You're amazing." He whispers queitly. I reply by pressing my lips to his. He pulls the covers over us and pulls me close to his chest, wrapping an arm around me. "Get some rest, baby. I'll be here when you wake."
I raised an eyebrow at him. "What's that supposed to mean?"
Another update! And some smut today. Hope you enjoy loves x
"Draco, he... he touched me. I understand if you don't want me." My heart broke and tears flooded my eyes.
Harry took a couple seconds to get his stature back before apologising profusely.
“Hi Harry.” He stammers out. “They said all the paper work has been signed. We can go now, if you like.” I’m about to reply when I feel someone spin me around. Officer Malfoy hands me the duffel bag from earlier.
"Because every time someone touches me where... where he did, I get scared. I want to run and hide. All my mind can think of is him and it makes me want to throw up. At the Weasleys' yesterday, Charlie put his hand in my leg for a second and I ran. I locked myself in the bathroom. I can't even be around my friends anymore. I don't know how I'm supposed to be with you if I get scared when people touch me."
“That’s ok. If you take me from behind you practically won’t see my itty bitty penis.” Seamus scoots up close to the dark skinned boy, and I mean
”Says the guy who practically jizzes his pants when I call him daddy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"You know, as a police captain, I suppose it's in my blood to enjoy seeing justice get served. It's just a shame you went so easy on him." I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "Perhaps take the day off and see your boyfriend." He added, before heading back to his office. I stood for a second, everyone else in the bullpen unsure of what they had just witnessed.
Malfoy, in the Muggle world? Who turned the world upside down and called it a day?
“Draco isn’t here, Mr Potter,” she replies calmly.
But Harry does know who he is supposed to be, he does know what his job makes him. So, without a word or a searching look, or anything else he so wants to do to convey to Malfoy his utter confusion, he grabs Malfoy’s forearm and apparates them to Diagon.
He listens for an answer; for seconds, nothing. Then, ever so quiet from the leftmost cubicle, “I’m in here.”
If possible, Malfoy goes a shade paler than he already is.
As he gets closer and closer, Harry can make out some of his features in the faint moonlight, and his breath catches. No way—
Malfoy nods, the same expression overtaking his face that Harry interpreted as shyness yesterday morning, when Harry asked him if he was hungry.
He thinks maybe it’s about becoming overly aware of yourself. A state where every miniscule movement of muscle in your face, every word that passes through the filter of your brain is controlled—calculated.
Draco takes the letter out of his hands, scanning it quickly.
He glances at the body again—at the inconspicuous shoe next to her that a quick tracking spell from Chandra revealed to be a used Portkey. He chews on his lips. “Do you reckon—”
All of him, down to the last string of attention connecting his brain to his awareness, is zoomed in on Draco, and he’s got no fuel left to spare to think about how he should react, or what to say, or not to look at Draco too intensely, too honestly.
“Aliyah Pittman. Hammond and Moore have been tracking her these past months. American. Suspected to have come to the UK under the pretence of an internship with the International Magical Cooperation Department. Her real intentions were more along the lines of a blood purity movement of her own in the US, for which she most probably hoped to gain inspiration from sealed Ministry War files. A Death Eater revivalist, if you will.”
Draco just sits there for a bit. Then he starts playing a song Harry doesn’t recognise. He sings, and the sound of it, his soft, silvery voice makes Harry shiver.
Robards has never cared to make small talk, to share details about his or ask any questions about his subordinates’ personal lives. Perhaps, Harry thinks, it isn’t so much that he doesn’t care to, rather than takes care
Why in God’s name did he think it was a good idea to bring the person who reminds him of nothing but the War into his home, his sacred space, and spike that with the sad smoke of Firewhiskey, so heavy—
There are a few tables behind him, and there’s a waitress standing by one of them, jotting down orders. He scans the area, looking for another waiter in a black apron, trying to locate a blond head, a scrawny figure and a pointed face, and—oh.
“Why not?” Harry presses on.
“Why do you know this, Chandra?”
It’s true—that’s one of the many reasons they work so well. Chandra moved to England from Pakistan after the War, but she knows criminal theory, can build a profile like no one else in the entire Department. Harry is all instinct in comparison, all practical knowledge through his proximity to the War.
Chandra grins at him. It’s her knowing grin. The one Harry hates. “Alright. Well—after you went home, Patil found a trace of magical signature on the letter. Something that might have been enough for tracking. I tried to Firecall you, but you didn’t answer, so I became worried, obviously.”
“Mr Potter, I’m sorry,” she says, frantic and choked up. “I don’t have the right words, and maybe I don’t have the right feelings, either. Maybe I don’t know what repentance feels like. I don’t know what you or anyone else suffering under the reign of the Dark Lord have gone through. I may never know. But I do know this: I love my son more than anything in this world. And it is eating me alive that I can’t help him. You are the only one who can. And I do know that you care. You always have. Please... do not leave.”
“Well,” Chandra starts, looking slightly amused, “there’s a serial killer on the loose.”
It’s unfortunately almost nine, which is one of the busiest Apparition times in the Ministry. The Atrium is full of witches and wizards whose attention is naturally drawn to Malfoy’s tall figure and bright hair, but mostly his odd choice of Muggle clothing.
He does look directly at Harry once, after he takes his first bite of the pasta Harry made, and an immediate sense of pride fills Harry at his surprised expression. It never fails to shock people that he can cook. He prays every time that they don’t ask why or how he learned, and he has to try hard to focus on the pride that comes with it instead of the bitterness. But it’s worth it.
Chandra looks away, a faint flush of shame colouring the highs of her cheeks. A rare sight, and Harry detests being the cause of it, even if he didn’t say anything he shouldn’t have. Many cases of injustice were left unaddressed after the War, and Harry could never entirely stop being bitter about it.
“Accio Harry Potter’s wand!”
Draco’s wine glass freezes in his hand. Then, slowly, he smiles at Harry, lifting one corner of his mouth, like a cat that knows he’s got you, can do whatever to you, and you’ll still like them. “Why thank you, Harry,” he says, airy and pretentious. It’s nonsensical, how much joy Harry feels at that, at Draco finding these little windows in time when he can be himself.
Harry frowns. Something is well and truly off, and if Malfoy has anything to do with the case, it’s all the better that he stays with Harry. But first, he needs to convince him it’s for the best.
He looks into his face—it’s him, there’s no doubt about it. It’s Amos Diggory. He’s older than Harry remembers. Older than he could have become during the years Harry hasn’t seen him. The expression on his face, the dull light in his eyes speak of a man who has nothing to lose.
“But the other Portkeys were wiped for a signature,” Harry says. “How did you trace it back to the cemetery?”
“We’ll drop your stuff off at mine. Then I’ll have to pop into the Ministry for a bit. I took the day off, but I need to sign the custodianship form saying that you’re staying under my protection, and I need you there for that.”
As Harry stares at the body, stilettoed feet hanging stiffly out of the gaping mouth of a filthy dumpster in an alley near the Ministry, he can’t help but feel that he should already know this.
Malfoy sighs, long-suffering as if he’s decided to walk straight into his death. “I’ll pack a bag.” And with that, he turns around and disappears in the house in his green bathrobe.
Harry wakes up feeling the worst he’s felt for a very long time. He’s disoriented, doesn’t know where he is for a moment, which way his head is. He lies on his back and tries to figure out why this is happening to him right now.
“Why don’t you sing something?”
“Anyway, she liked music. Not enough to fight my father on it, but enough to want to share it with me—the only other person in her life she loved. Perhaps it was also a way for her to compensate for my father’s hardness. A silent resistance to his rule. Our little secret.”
“Yeah,” Harry nods. “We’re Apparating.”
And if Draco is nervous, he’s good at hiding it, or maybe Harry simply doesn’t have the right mind to notice anything other than his own violent heartbeat.
“He isn’t. He came back just after the first anniversary of the War, but… not here. He returned only to pack a suitcase and left again. Something happened to him in France. He has never talked about it, but it’s the only explanation for why he became so—” Her mouth twists into a sneer as she cuts herself off, and Harry notes that Malfoy gets it from her, his signature look of contempt, not his father, “—different,” she finishes.
Harry searches Malfoy’s face, looking for a sign—of anger, maybe. Irritation at the very least. But there’s nothing. So Harry carries on.
“Yeah.” Harry nods. “I mean, we didn’t find a letter like this with any of the victims. But the wording, it’s—it just—”
Harry clears his throat. “You sing, right? So—well, you haven’t played the guitar or sang anything since you’ve been here.”
No, Harry is just angry. Who the
So they stand on the balcony and Malfoy smokes. Harry keeps tracing the movement of the cigarette from his fingertips to his mouth. The way his lips form a little ‘o’ as he exhales the smoke. Harry isn’t drunk, but he’s tipsy enough to not want to mess around anymore. He just wants to know. “So,” he starts, “what the fuck is wrong with you?”
Malfoy stares at him, frown deepening. “Why?”
“They know you’re here,” Harry says. “The killer—they know you’re here.”
Chandra lets out a breath. “It’s someone who knows what they’re doing. Patil is the best at what she does.”
As Malfoy shuts the door after muttering something about unpacking, Harry is hit with the absurdity of having
“No,” Malfoy says, quick and sharp, and the edge of despair in his voice doesn’t escape Harry. Malfoy clears his throat. “Under no circumstances is that going to happen.” He lets out a deep breath—of reluctance, Harry thinks. “What’s my other option?”
Chandra pushes a stapled stack of papers his way. “You know I didn’t. You can use mine.”
Harry stares. “What?”
up to something! Doesn’t that just prove my point?” Harry exclaims.
Maybe it’s not about that; maybe it’s about becoming aware of your faults, your mistakes—and with that, coming to possess the ability to feel bad about them.
—has always been an invisible source of fuel for his anger. The other side of the same coin.
No, neither of those have anything to do with the
“Not yet. Not to you just yet. Look at me, Harry. Tell me you don’t understand. You’re not the sharpest tool in the shed, I know—after all, the only reason you even stood a chance next to my Cedric was because you were given help every step of the way. But you’re not that stupid.”
Narcissa nods and sits, all the gratitude she is capable of showing etched into the twist of her mouth and the intensity of her dark eyes. But Harry isn’t vain or cruel enough to question her again.
Her mouth twists again, this time more sad than spiteful. “Suffice to say, he won’t listen. He says he is fine. Safe.” Her eyes cut to Harry, the lines between her eyebrows deepening. “But how could he be fine? How could he be safe out there, Mr Potter?”
“Sit down, gentlemen,” Robards says when they enter, gesturing towards the uncomfortable chairs in front of his table. When they do, his gaze zeroes in on Malfoy. “Welcome back to the wizarding world, Mr Malfoy.”
his silly, giddy brain adds unhelpfully.
“Well,” Chandra says slowly, “didn’t you say he’s been disconnected from the wizarding world for years? It’s not really—”
Malfoy sits, mutters an awkward
Nighttime finds Harry restless. He wakes up every few hours, like he’s sleeping in someone else’s house for the first time. Come to think of it, no one has ever used his guest room other than Hermione and Ron; he doesn’t like the idea of sharing his space. And it’s beyond bizarre that the one exception he’s made—was forced to, really—was for Draco Malfoy, of all people.
Malfoy echoes in Harry’s head as he jogs toward the nearest alley to Apparate from.
Malfoy is the bloke Harry didn’t spare a second glance when he entered, sitting on a small stool in the corner by the window, singing and playing the guitar. Harry’s ears register the music. His eyes verify the face, the scrawny figure. But his mind is unwilling to connect it to
He takes a deep breath. His room smells like rotten fruit. He makes a face; this is why he rarely drinks. It’s not enough that it makes him feel like shit, no; his body has to mock him with perspiring alcohol through each and every one of his pores.
Draco’s hand has a slight tremor to it when he raises his wine glass to his mouth.
The more Harry hears, the more confused he becomes. “So… where is he now, then?”
So, he tells himself again, half-asleep but abuzz with strange nerves at the same time, it doesn’t matter if he doesn’t quite know how he feels about this, as long as what he does feels right.
He’s tired, and he doesn’t know how much longer he can have Malfoy around him before he does something he regrets. Something stupid and dangerous, like reaching out and tucking that goddamn lock of hair that always falls across Malfoy’s cheekbone and curves as if he was a delicately shaped Greek sculpture.
Harry looks at him. Looks at the slight, nervous tilt of his mouth, his averted eyes. Wonders if being shy is something you can learn. If it can be a thing to pick up, even for someone arrogant. Like when you become self-aware, or break a little. It occurs to him that he’s not even sure he knows what being self-aware means.
“Don’t even think about it, Potter,” Malfoy says, sharp and real with something like frustration and a little bit of fear. “You’ve dragged me all the way out here. We’re staying. And do you honestly think anyone would be stupid enough to attack me while you’re here? In public?”
“Thank you,” Harry says. Sometimes, he’s hit with the realisation that Chandra is the best thing that’s happened to him at the Aurors.
Harry is so incredibly glad to have him as his boss. Even if his questions are nerve-wracking sometimes, and Harry often has no idea what he wants or if he thinks Harry is a good Auror at all, his professionalism is evident. Even if he’s not fond of Malfoy, he doesn’t show it, tone neutral and matter-of-fact.
He is, however, also excellent at distracting himself from things he doesn’t want to look at, so he throws everything he has into looking over the case, making sure there isn’t a single clue or sign left outside his line of vision.
for chicken.” She shrugs and takes a bite. “I like it. I think it would do both you and Ronald some good if you reined in your food prejudices and tried some new things from time to time.”
“Does the name Heidi Goudier ring a bell to either of you?”
“Fuck,” Draco breathes into his mouth.
“So, did you have a big reunion last night? I was asleep before you got home, I meant to ask,” she says to Malfoy. Then she turns to Harry. “Did you spend the night?”
Malfoy is pouring them both a glass when Harry tunes back in, and Harry looks at the inside of his wrist, the tendons in the middle crafted and silky-looking.
Harry looks at him, surprised. “I had it refurbished. How do you even know about old English flats?”
“From the alley just down the road.” He wants to, he
Malfoy doesn’t say anything back, just nods his head and follows when Harry starts walking. When he stops in front of the flats above the quidditch shop, Malfoy snorts, and mutters something Harry is almost sure is “figures.”
Harry smiled at him, instantly appeased; a lovely sweet grin that erased all the leftover lines of tension from his jaw. "Yeah, alright. Keep my side of the bed warm, will you?"
His unrepentant lover only squirmed closer—and the Weasel and his bloody know-it-all of a main squeeze choose that exact moment to cum
“Right; you asked. One,” Hermione grinned. She raised a slim hand and began to tick off items in a business-like fashion. “You both possess and dwell in quite elderly Wizarding homes of substance. Wizarding homes which are especially accustomed to housing fairly large families, judging by the sheer mass of them. Two, you’re both absolutely brilliant with children, all ages, and you know it.” She gave them both very stern looks, taking her time about it. “You both adore Teddy. And Rosie, and Pansy’s two, and Bill and Fleur’s, and--tell me, need I go on? No? No, I didn’t think so. Perfect candidates.”
one, Draco? Oh, Merlin!"
, Harry. Please come home. Please?"
Giving it up as a bad job and far too fatigued to really even care, Draco settled, eyelids drifting down, heavier and heavier with every breath. In the hall the sconces burned low of their own accord and Harry had managed to fiddle the duvet about so it lay approximately in the right fashion. It was peaceful at last and Harry was toasty-warm, laying next to him, still latched on to Draco with lax hands and knobby ankles. Oddly easy to accustom himself to, Draco reflected sleepily, those tickling toes aside. Especially at nearly three o'clock in the morning.
Finally, finally the nitwit wrenched his head round and lowered his wondering gaze, meeting Draco's earnest eyes. Draco reached out to grasp Harry's hips—he needed something solid to cling to, now it was time—and opened his mouth.
"Nymphadora, yes. I wouldn't know, sadly."
His mother tittered at him. "Well, darling, you're not exactly self-aware, are you?"
had clearly been paged through. Not that he minded the lack, because of course he didn’t. He was quite accustomed, really. They'd quietly fallen asleep the previous night, backs to each other, and that had been the end of that row. No more to be said about it.
He regarded his emptied cup with dismay; he'd have to be more careful, wouldn't he? Play it cool. A collected composed Malfoy front was key for handling emotional moments such as these…and besides, such control would stand him in good stead with Harry. No one cared for a clingy lover, did they?
Draco manfully squared his already square shoulders and assumed his best meditatively composed expression, radiating waves of calm all about him. Non-homicidal calm, though he, too, was miffed in a Malfoy sort of way. However, his object of irritation (though the same as his father's) was also his objet d'amour. And that was a sticky sort of wicket indeed. One could not pull an Othello on Harry Potter—it just wasn't done.
.  Grimmauld’s not exactly spit-spot, top of the nines, is it? All that red velvet swagging, Potty. Still. Go ahead and open the damn door, will you? The bloody suspense is killing me here.”
"Unspeakable. Yes, yes, I know," Draco sighed, draining his glass and setting it down. "Too, too well. Right. Carry on, then. So, how are your other two thirds doing? I swear, I've not been out of my damned manor for a month or more, Harry. I've no idea what's been happening in the world."
life. Draco's.
“Oh, er…alright,” Potter blinked up at him, “Um, whe—“
“Potter," he said, firming his chin. "Look. I am here, right beside you, and I am asking you a question, yes? Tell me you didn’t eat when you got home and I’ll hex you,” he went on equably enough, striving for a reasonable, rational tone, one that might finally penetrate. “No, better than that. Tell me you
Another few inches, backing off in the middle to make sure he was spreading the lube properly within, and then an abruptly impatient Draco rammed home, rattling Potter's teeth in his head.
Hermione was laughing, soundlessly. Or at least her shoulders were shaking and her face was pink. Neville and Seamus, their nearest neighbors, only stared, as gobsmacked as Harry. They’d not, however had the advantage of the truly volcanic surge of anger that was building up in his gut.
"Wait—what?" Harry gasped, scrambling up on his knees in a flurry. He stuck a hand out and grabbed at Malfoy's open robes, unthinking. Hermione stopped her search abruptly and went into a great peal of loud girly laughter, gasping and giggling and generally making a fuss. "Odd?" he howled. "Since when am
Draco, Harry's NEWTS Potions lab partner, edged his seat two inches closer to Harry's, shoving aside the volume Harry was examining and replacing it with a dusty maroon-jacketed text from Restricted.
“I—am—
Potter had long since vanished into their midst. Draco had a free period next, one of the very few instructional periods he didn’t share with Potter.
They humped atop the mount of their small kingdom; the scruffy little islet Harry had introduced his paramour to but a few weeks before. A fine and private place, he'd said to Draco that day, unconsciously quoting someone Mugglish and famous, but there it was—his special place and he'd wanted to share. His retreat, his sanctuary. Theirs, now.
"Oh, I do," Draco's eyes glittered, the melt stayed for a moment. Suddenly the noise of the café seemed much heightened; Harry noticed it, just as he noticed the death grip Draco had on his collar. "I do know, but—"
"Er?" Draco boggled, jaw dropping. "They would, would they?"
came home.”
“Well.” Harry sat back down with a thump, watching the door shut smartly on its well-oiled hinges behind her. “Fuck, then. Be that way. I shall have to cast the divination by myself, I suppose.” He glanced at his unfinished breakfast and cooling coffee, then over the nearest heap of correspondence and sighed. “But not yet, clearly. Damn!”
"Remember Perkowski Plotpopkin from Durmstrang?" Ron wanted to know. "He's looking—and he's a great chap, Nev. Very shaggable chap. Just what you like."
"Idiot," Draco twinkled fondly, grabbing at Harry's crooked elbow. He tugged at it, familiarly. "Of course it is. I don't know what I was so worried about, even—
"I say, Potter, I said 'let's play a game'," Draco drawled again, with a tad more emphasis, and Harry Potter, ere long the acknowledged rival of the House of Malfoy, at last bothered to glance up from his Ogden's. "Now, please. This is stultifying. I shall expire shortly. Save me."
Draco hesitated, swallowing back a surge of anxiety. Perhaps…perhaps maybe Grandme're's engagement ring was not such a good idea after all? There seemed to be a great deal more to it than a simple band of diamond-encrusted platinum and he'd no wish to take even the slightest risk with Harry, offering him a Magical Item with invested Veela powers…but then, it was Grandme're's, wasn't it? And Draco's Grandme're had been one of the most joyful people he'd ever had the pleasure of knowing, however briefly. If the ring could in some way impart that sense of joie de vivre to Draco's Harry—if it carried with it a cargo of fond memories and good fortune, then Draco would be more than happy to present it.
"Yes, love—yes, there!" And his Harry cheerily obliged him, never looking away from the sultry picture the firelight painted of one Draco Malfoy, starched white shirttails flapping about his thighs, blushing arse-cheeks spread wide, hole pierced and indubitably owned by his favourite—
Still…Potter must be quite chilled, as it was brisk. Very blustery, even with the abundant sunshine, glittering off the hoops and the player’s buckles and latches. Draco could see the little prick shuddering—and sparkling, too—as he took himself into a hair-raising spin, hand outstretched for the nimble Snitch. Which was, of course, very brightly golden.
“Fine, you wanker, be that way about it. Don’t mind me. Helping myself.”
Weaselbee, Draco noted as he rose obediently, looked simply to be gobsmacked; his cheeks had flamed a brilliant scarlet, his jaw was resting lax upon his chest. And Granger—that swot—she was much the same, excepting that she was licking her lips in a very odd manner, quick and hungry-like. In, out; in and out went the tip of her little pink tongue, just as Harry would soon be sawing in-out of Draco's willing arsehole.
He would
“O…kay. Ummm. Draco?”
"Um…" Harry slumped back, flummoxed. "Ah, I. You're serious? I-I don't know quite what to say, Draco—I mean—I didn't expect you to…well. Well."
He’d been startled into saying something in return. Something a little dirty, something a little risqué. Unthinkable, therefore to. And then Malfoy had said something clever back at him and Harry replied in kind, and it was banter. And three more paragraphs along of Slytherin-esque talk Harry had clued in they were flirting.
"Yes, indeed. I'm Potter, Draco. And soon to be Malfoy. Isn't it super?"
Exactly
Sniffing, Draco stalked out, fuming hotly and making sure he slammed shut behind him not only the living room door behind him but also his bedroom door for good measure. Really, he couldn’t make the message loud enough for that utter dolt Potter.
Ron didn't react to that, much; certainly he was still mumchance and uncannily silent, not crowing aloud over Draco's failure, his loss, his stupidity. Well, excepting that his fists loosened up finally and his eyes narrowed, assessing. No, Weasley sat very still instead, like a coil, compressed under pressure, dangerously inert. Hermione, of course, reacted differently.
But it was grueling, facing down his house day after day, and feeling stymied perpetually. For there seemed to be nothing the done about it; his Manor had made up its incorporeal mind.
And here it was clear the other two were approaching their mutual culmination, judging by the growls, howls and high-pitched giggles they were making.
He grinned, which was promptly interrupted by yet another yawn.
, the voice reassured itself.
"I am
"Do you—um, are you even sure…does your Mum know?" Harry was honestly at sea, Draco realized. Harry was clueless.
"What?" he gulped hard and forced himself to look up, finally. Only to see a pale Draco Malfoy, eyes brilliant, smiling giddily. "What, Draco? Don't you like it?"
“Yes? What?” Potter’s dark ironic eyebrows had flown well up and away, arched inquisitively at Draco. His eyes were squinty-suspicious, true, but he wasn’t actively bridling, in readiness to spit insults, nor preparing to bolt off to hither and yon. Draco took that curt businesslike tones as a positive cue to continue on in his chosen direction of introduction. “To what, Malfoy?”
Derived from the Latin word for "club-shaped", a standard claviform is defined as a vertical "P-sign", and is sometimes described by archeologists as a stylized female figure. See the oldest claviforms in the Altamira Cave paintings (c.34,000 BCE).
He was in
"Hmm?" Draco raised his brows enquiringly. "What?"
"I wasn't!"
enemies.
Draco gritted his back teeth, settling his heels more firmly onto the pavers. He wasn't going, no matter what Harry said. It made no nevermind. This was real as it got. This was his life, his and Harry's. He glared down at Harry—
“What?”
, git," he admitted hastily. "Of course, yours. Obviously—not that you need to make so much of it. Come along, then—we're leaving. I'm a frigging mess, Harry, and it's all your fault. I want to be clean again, if that's not too much to ask."
"Nrrr-Nrrr-Nrrr!" Draco shrieked, whizzing. "Nrphhhhff!"
Desperate for relief, he addressed the four solidly bland walls of the Room. "Hush, twat. Now!
“Yeah, please,” Nott grumbled. “Please, please, please, you mental patient. I’m fucking freezing my bits off. Two warming Charms, mate, and some cocoa.”
over, and Harry knowing Draco as Draco knowing Harry—it wouldn't be, couldn't be—not ever. And this was a damned fine thing, all 'round, as likely next time it would be him, Harry, storming out stiff-rumped and Draco trotting after, bleating 'Harry! Harry!' and looking a bit too bereft for even maybe Ron to bear watching.
been a vastly pleasant shocker!
see Pansy!" Draco stepped blindly back towards the hearth, eyes never leaving the face of his one-time enemy. "Right now, this instant. Pansy is sane and she fucking had kids because she wanted to, not because she's an all too easily influenced saphead, Potter!”
"Any—every—ple—just—more!" Harry was departed; was here and yet not here; he'd say anything, anything Draco Malfoy demanded of him. "I've—I've wanted—you," he gasped, the burn resolving into a smooth, rapid motion within him, Malfoy's hot breath ghosting over his nostrils, "for—so—long!"
Two years of zero contact was a rather long time, really. All things considered. It felt a bit awkward. Just popping his head through the hearth as if it were nothing.
"We're wasting valuable time, you know. Right now. Class will start soon, so, er—why don't you put that babbling mouth of yours to a better use, eh?"
"Hmm." Draco gazed at him, his eyes so close they were a blur of darkest midnight pupil and a dazzle of tinsel. They glittered as he blinked, very slowly. "And then, Harry?" he prompted, after a longish pause. "What?"
"Well!" he huffed, settling down leisurely and shifting his bum about on the cushiony surface, his face twitching itself into a reluctant grin. "Fine, thanks for asking. And I suppose you really
”Keep it down, kid.” I shout. Knowing Neville, he’s a blushing idiot right now. If Draco is at work, that means that Zabini is with him on patrol. So Longbottom must Ben having one hell of a solo session, unless Zabini managed to get a phone call with him. Sneaky bastard.
Ginerva's acting, while enjoyable, was starting to irritate Draco.
“Griffin?” He checks and I nod a reply. He chucks the bag on the floor by my feet, and I throw my identical one to him. He looks inside, counting the money. “Perfect.” He says before leaving and I head back to my car. I check the bag, seeing a couple bags of marijuana and a small, clear bag with a dozen or so small pills in. I open the boot, placing the bag in the empty spare wheel slot and cover it smoothly with the carpet before getting in and driving off.
After spending most of Monday under cars in the garage, I arrive at Andromeda’s house in the evening thanks to Luna’s scheduling. I knock the door a couple times, and don’t wait long before I hear commotion inside, before a boy a few years younger than me opens the door.
I couldn't even be with friends anymore. I was ruined. Charlie was basically family, but the way I had acted, it was as if he were some grotesque monster. I couldn't even handle a bit of physical banter because all I could imagine were those hands on me.
"You can stay up here if you want, but I'm getting breakfast." Draco chuckled as the cat chirped in reply, quickly jumping off the bed and rushing to his feet.
”What else?”
"Ok. Noted." She smiled, but pulled out her phone anyway. I made to grab it but she gave me a stern look. Her puppy nuzzled itself against my outreached hand, distracting me from the call. "I'm with a young man here, he's been attacked. Can I request a female police officer, please? Yes. Uh huh. I'm not sure, he doesn't seem to know. Shock, yeah. Thank you."
