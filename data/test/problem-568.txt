of the Philosopher’s Stone. It’s the Azoth that turns it into the Magnum Opus.”
Their pops of Apparition left the forest feeling even emptier than before. Harry took the opportunity to see what he could find on the internet. He pulled his laptop from his bag and opened it, fixing up the spell that would let him leech someone else’s WiFi miles away.
“Can we talk about something more interesting?” said Rosie. “Like what you got us for Christmas?”
By unspoken agreement, Lee got the master bedroom on the top floor. He’d brought his entire home studio of audio equipment, after all. Despite a successful career in public relations—that Harry was taking him from—he still spent his weekends volunteer commentating for the Chudley Cannons, whose budget didn’t allow for much.
on. Either sex only or sex and
Harry was in turn introduced to Atlas, Nero, Claudius, Finian, Quill, Martin, Harry Henry (Harry’s life: more mortifying by the moment), Phoenix, Socorro, Felix, Byron, Gregorious, Jesse, Titus, Raul, Gardner, Jake, and Heathcliff. By the grace of Merlin, there was only one contender left to arrive. Harry stared up at the bridge, waiting for the wizard to remove his Disillusionment charm and fly his arse down so they could all get inside, Harry could throw back several beers, and they would be that much closer to the end.
“Something you’d like to share, Apprentice Malfoy?” McGonagall said.
“Dudley, why are you still here?” Draco asked.
“You do it anyway,” says Malfoy, still circling the head of his cock around Harry’s hole. “
Hermione nodded, taking all of this down in her notebook. “So,” she said, looking up again. “Have you thought about a theme?”
“I could warm it for you, Mrs Dursley,” said Millicent.
Padma kicked him discreetly. Bubbles exploded from the movement.
“There’s something I wanted to tell you,” Hermione said quietly, as they watched the Prime Minister continue to warm up the crowd.
“Harry, Hermione, you remember my good friend Millicent Bulstrode,” said Draco to the both of them. “She’s recently divorced her wife of four years and finds herself at loose ends this holiday season.”
Harry sighed. “You’re right. I don’t want to think that. But maybe we should. Maybe we shouldn’t write the guilt off just because time’s passed.”
If Malfoy could do it, so could he.
Draco snorted. Then they were to the front of the line, and Theo’s face broke into, if possible, an even wider grin. “Draco!” he said, hugging him. “I’m getting married in seven months!”
“We discussed the flash mob aspect…”
“We came from
Neville scooted in, his mouth stretched with a grin. “Do you think Professor Sprout’d take me on?”
Harry writes again.
He might as well. He gathered all his magic to him, let his consciousness retreat from everything but the here-and-now of his first transformation. Draco became a distant, forgotten attendance as he pushed himself over that final hurdle. He told himself to shrink, told his body to change. For many minutes, nothing happened.
“Of course it’d be me,” Harry muttered.
“Miss?” he called.
He felt Draco shift beside him, and then their sides were touching, warm and perfectly fitting.
The advisors themselves did not acknowledge this or the group in any way. They simply sat and watched.
In Harry’s opinion, anyway. Which was worth very little, given he was about to spend his first night practically exiled from his own country ‘until or unless’ he could fix a problem he didn’t cause.
“Can you get a message to the Queen?”
“I’ve seen bigger,” said Hermione. She squeaked and covered her mouth. Miles scampered in closer and Hermione’s eyes widened as she saw the camera on her. “In Dorset! The chalk painting, I mean. Not
“Hermione?” said Weasley, half standing.
Rosie started whimpering. “We will talk about this later,” Hermione said sternly, turning to Rosie.
The walk to the staff room was quiet. Now that his Ravenclaws and Slytherins were home, the castle was drowsy, as it always got in the month before the school year began. As if its alarm had gone off, but Hogwarts kept hitting snooze.
“Not here,” says the vendor.
“Yeah,” Harry said.
Harry smirked. “But Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes are. And plenty of those pack a seriously powerful magical punch.”
. What do you think?”
“I know.” Harry shrugged.
Harry sighs, crossing his arms over his chest and staring at the polite mouse trap again. “But why would anyone want to leave Britain?”
And that means… it means maybe he and Draco, maybe they can—
Draco thought for a moment. “Quincy, I think. She comes from a good family—the Addamses of upstate New York. Weird family, but old and solid. I can’t believe she married someone named Kyle.”
“Draco,” Harry said, laughing. Draco’s face was so close to his, his breath soft against Harry’s mouth. They were terribly close. Closer than they’d ever been before. “Please tell me you aren’t serious.”
“What’s got your knickers so knotted then?” Draco said through a gasp.
She squealed, dropped her things, and ran to hug him. Neither of the Slytherins seemed to find this at all tasteful, judging by their expressions.
Petunia frowned at him for a long moment, then shook her head, smiled. “All right. Finish your tea and I’ll pop you all over.”
“Bloody swimming,” he said. “These charms are going up by about 1 joule per, right? They look so wobbly to me.”
“Yeah, but Atlantis is an island with roughly the same surface area as Greenland,” Harry said. “Hardly representative of the
“Hmm?”
The professors heading to the meeting gathered in the staff room for their departure, but Harry was the first one in. He poured himself a cup of coffee from the carafe the house-elves kept in there and sat at the table, nursing it lovingly. Goldstein came in next without a word—he never spoke before two cups of tea and a large coffee with extra cream, Harry knew from experience, so he just gave him a nod and went back to his own cup of delicious life-giving nectar.
He kissed all down Draco’s throat, and Draco threw his head back to let him. “Come…” he painted. “Come back with me.”
“Master calls?” Kreacher croaked.
Harry asks again.
“Yeah,” Harry says. He had said that. What a fucking idiot he is. “Well, I don’t know where to start.”
The downside of this was that he had no outlet for his sarcastic commentary except Harry; the upside was that Snape was indeed incredibly bored and had a lot of commentary to offer, thus leading to Harry finally—
“But there might be an antidote after we study it…”
Severus smirked. “Draco, you are an expert in complex ancient magic. With Millicent’s determination and Potter’s proven record, how could you fail?”
“What?!” said Potter.
fantasy fiction series. You sure you don’t prefer Drake?”
“Who’d drink from a lead cup anyway?”
The next Monday, his last NEWT came. The Potions examiner let them in at exactly ten a.m. and Harry took up his usual seat with the emotional burner. At least it wasn’t a Wednesday.
?” said Professor Sinistra and Snape’s portrait at the same time. They shared a speaking look.
Though, come to think of it, he hadn’t had any reason to lodge a complaint against Malfoy in twelve years—and he’d rather hoped to keep it that way.
“Do you know, Potter, how long I’ve wanted you, you stupid, annoying fuck?”
“Good morning, Potter,” Malfoy said, rather ungraciously if Harry were asked.
The traitorous thought that maybe this could have had something to do with Draco’s reluctance entered his mind and wouldn’t leave.
Harry was abruptly reminded of Hermione’s story about pure-bloods and the visceral fear of losing the Statute.
Harry wandered over to the amphitheatre where Luna and the contenders were gathering, collected clues in hand. Luna waved at Harry when he arrived.
“Yes sir,” said Harry. “Flask 1 is the human Polyjuice.”
Except help her leave.
“Ravenclaws are definitely cowards if their Arithmancy shows a low probability for survival,” Potter agreed absently, but his face was white and his eyes flicked around the cabin in agitation.
The man reads and then nods. “I went to school in London. I know you,” he says, with only a slight accent. His eyes flick to Harry’s forehead before he adds, “You used to be able to talk. I downloaded your victory speech from MagiUpload before it was shut down.”
“What are you doing?” Draco whispers. His eyes are unusually bright behind the lenses of his glasses.
this morning,” said Professor Sprout quietly as she passed. They all straightened immediately, and she hummed in approval. “Good,” she said. “It wouldn’t do to be tired today."
“Why’d you bring your whole house?” asked Draco.
“Calcination,” Harry said, watching intently. He bit his lip, waiting for the wards to change colours with the process. “There are minerals in there that act like flux. I figured it out when Draco said the stone had reverted to mica instead of feldspar. It’s not just metamorphic. It’s polymorphic. All the gneiss around here, in Scotland, it’s like...it’s like it
His translator rushed through a translation, and then man’s eyebrows went up, settled. He nodded once to Harry and held it out.
Draco’s slick fingers slid inside, and Harry watched, mesmerised. He had three fingers in before Harry had fully comprehended what was happening, and by then, he was nearly coming all over himself. He took three quick steps forward and gently tugged at Draco’s wrist until his fingers slipped out. They immediately found Harry’s prick and wrapped around it instead.
“Happy birthday,” Harry says, unthinking. His voice catches, as it often does these days, and the words come out dry and brittle, not unlike Harry himself.
They were near to nuclear war, which even Malfoy seemed to understand was bad. They were near to the Statute falling to shit. They were near to a fucking alien invasion. And Harry would take Voldemort over this any day of any week.
Hermione’s face turned as red as her pantsuit. “It was my fault,” she admitted, uncharacteristically quiet.
In the end, Harry always did what was expected of him, and so therefore wrapped his hand around the string of anal beads, and let himself be whisked away to Australia.
As one, they turned and began picking their way back through the Forbidden Forest to the grounds. Harry’s heart was hammering, and for the first time, it wasn’t due to Draco’s presence. Everything was still and silent all around him, but a flash of blue caught his eye as he stepped over a fallen tree trunk, and he gasped.
Merlin, he could come from this, probably. Hands shaking, he raised the burner to high. Draco’s fingers continued ghosting over his ribs, barely touching, leaving Harry in shambles. His wand buzzed, and even the tiny vibrations it made against his thigh set his skin afire, as
Harry jumped, slowly turned around. Malfoy was right there, staring over his shoulder into town, against the candle’s glare, even though there were three other windows in Harry’s sitting room with the same view.
Harry shook his head. “Are you serious? You wouldn’t even look at me that whole week. Are you saying you were… sort of still interested?”
Harry let out a heavy breath, gave Malfoy a small smile. He felt woozy, drunk, and—odd. Like the magic had changed something in him he didn’t even know was there. It was almost like he could still feel the magic sloshing back and forth between them, like Harry was still sharing his magic with Malfoy—but also that Malfoy was somehow sharing his with Harry.
“My name is Draco Malfoy. I am from Wiltshire, England, and come from a pedigreed line of over three-hundred generations of magic users—wizards and witches. Currently, I am Professor of Ancient Magical Cultures and Spellcasting at a school for magical children in Scotland. My colleague, Harry Potter, is also from a long line of magic users, though his mother was the first in her family to display magic. Magic is something that can crop up among families without it, but it’s quite rare without at least one magical parent. Harry teaches a course called Non-Magical Immersion—”
“Do you believe me, Mr Koetsu?” Harry asked him, still standing only inches apart.
when we need fresh water.”
He’s never thought he was the kind of person to just blow his whole life over a relationship, and yet here he is. Giving up on his own work for a man. Losing sleep over his own misery. Hiding himself from his friends. Denying his own heart for a job. Just a regular cunt. He deserves this, he really does.
Behind them, someone snorted, and they both turned. Malfoy was dressed similarly to Harry, right down to the khaki shorts. His legs, however, were blindingly pale. “One can, I assure you, Mr Faungrazer.”
“You are making me ill,” Snape declared, turning away in overdramatic disgust.
His body relaxed with an ache he’d never felt before in his life. Ms Danger was panting hard, little whimpering sounds coming from her as her body shrank back down to its normal size, and she rushed him, jumping in his arms and licking his neck and face everywhere she could reach. He grabbed her and bolted from the bed, his whole body trembling with fear.
“We were discussing what Harry and Dudley saw in the sky this morning,” Hermione said.
“Let’s go see Mummy then, shall we?” Draco said brightly.
“Fuuuck,” Harry said, yawning. “Wow.” He pulled himself up on his hands and turned to find Draco still slumped beside him. He got his wand out and tapped him on the head, softly whispering, “Ennervate."
This, Harry could handle. “ICW task force business. Could we use your office to talk to Snape?”
Hermione chatted about her caseload as they took the lift down to Level Eight, and the canteen directly beyond the Atrium. She was arguing against Padma Patil again, and the working relationship those two had was one that still baffled Harry. Padma was one of the DMLE’s top prosecutors, and Hermione was DMLE’s Jr Lead Public Defense. Somehow, they managed to be very good friends outside of work while being completely vicious in the courtroom.
When Snape was gone, Harry’s rooms suddenly felt a lot emptier. He knew Ms Danger was still around, probably draped over some book, trying to predict what the ending would be. She tended to hide from strangers, and had gone invisible as soon as Ginny arrived, although she would reveal herself to Luna every now and again, and was very happy to be visible around Albus.
Draco smirked at him. “No questions,” he said. “You’ll see."
Draco pursed his lips. “We’ll outsource.”
"Could we speak in private, please?" She leaned forward while nervously shifting her feet.
"Bloodworth," He finished for her smiling.
Harry woke up to a metal pan slamming against her cupboard's door.
"I think they are nice," Harriet pouted and looked down at her broom. Merry tried not to laugh at Malfoy continuously getting struck out with Harriet.
The Sorting Hat can't see,
"The one who does wands?" Harriet asked surprised.
"I'm going to take a shower," Harriet mumbled and grabbed some pyjamas and Beetlejuice. The girls all watched her go until Merry realized what she was doing and went to shower herself. Merry locked the door behind them.
"Then why else are you here?" Albus folded his hands and smiled at the glaring man.
Harriet was sitting up in bed just listening to the wind outside, the snow was falling heavily. There was a thud outside, Harriet also jumped out of her skin. She was very close to waking up Draco right next to her in fear. She saw the reflection of shoes stop at Draco's door, her heart seemed to stop all of a sudden. She held her breath and tried to hid under the covers but still watching the outline of feet. The feet soon left and Harriet's heart was still frozen as well as her face. She heard Riley's voice right after the feet left and she let out a held breath. Riley's voice seemed to calm her, it must have been Severus checking to make sure they were asleep and not being loud. She put her hand on her chest to calm down her heart rate, she cuddled into Draco's warm figure to try and calm herself down more. He shifted more closer to her also, still asleep, mostly wanting more warm contact.
"Heir Malfoy, it is a pleasure to meet you. I am Harriet Potter," She shook his hand. He puffed out his chest proudly at her calling him Heir. Zabini snorted while Nott snickered.
------------------------------------------
Harry walked downstairs with a smirk on her face. Her Aunt was still attempting to get her Uncle's attention.
"Are you looking for a pet?" The woman turned to Harry.
"How many people will be there?" Harriet's eyes filled with fear.
"On second thought I better go," Harriet said.
"So then-"
"You just don't want to make a fool of yourself by not knowing where to go for classes," Merry snorted.
"Oh Harriet, it's just for fun," Merry laughed.
To achieve their ends."
(I am going to switch between Harry and Harriet at random moments just a heads up)
----- End Of Flashback -----
"Probably 500" Draco sneered. It was very obvious that they all hated him. Why though? Maybe because of their parents. Most of theirs are known to be Dark.
"That's good," Harriet nodded, was her Uncle and Aunt wrong then?
"Harriet," Someone behind her whispered. She turned around to see Blaise looking at her with his eyes wide and sighing while shaking his head. She held back a giggle when she found out why he was acting the way he was. Draco was ranting on and on about how his father taught him everything to know about transfiguration.
2 years ago...
"Where would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?" He asked her another question, trying to stump her. Hermione again raised her hand
"I get them after classes."
"These several years are going to be very interesting with you, aren't they?" She laughed. Harry just laughed back.
"EWW!" Harry and Merry laughed. Both of the adults blushed and separated quickly.
--------------------------------
-----Flashback-----
"Sweet Merlin," Harriet joked while made the other two laugh.
"I was just so excited you were here, that's why we ran up here like toddlers right away," Merry laughed. They were smiling brightly as they shrunk their trunks, Harriet grabbed a blanket she got from Merry's mother for an early Christmas. Merry told her mother that Harriet likes soft things and she loves cuddling with anything. Harriet cried when she got her first Christmas present and it was a meaningful present, it even had a Slytherin crest on it which she loved. They walked downstairs, Harriet almost tripped on her fluffy blanket that she was carrying. Beetlejuice, her snake, was around her torso which hides him due to her large Slytherin sweatshirt. Harriet didn't know how to dress up to meet Malfoy's parents.
headmistress,” Ron muttered sourly.
“Twenty minutes.”
“I said I did
“Yeah, maybe… no!” Justin said, his excitement returning. “I’ve another idea. It’ll be nearly as good as an explosion. We can blow the fuse. It might cause a power outage, but they’ll fix that up no problem, and in the meantime, the redirected electricity will occupy the magic trap while we work.”
“Oh, I think we’ll get on
“Hermione said Minister Shacklebolt is punishing the Americans,” Harry offered. It was a new year, so technically Britain had a fresh quota of 600 Obliviations they could use, but the Ministry reported that they were electing to use none of them, in ‘deference to the wishes of the MUS.’ What a load of bollocks that was.
He pecked him sharply, and finally—finally—Draco seemed to understand. He took a few more steps forward, and kneeled down next to himself, watching Hermione perform CPR with a macabre sort of curiosity. He still hadn’t touched, though, and Harry had just about had enough of this. He took off from Draco’s shoulders and flew several dozen metres up in the air. Then he turned and swooped down as fast as he could, like when he was doing a Wronski Feint, and at the last minute, turned his body and let it slam into Draco’s half-there back. The force of the impact knocked him forward, and his translucent spirit sprawled onto his physical body, and sunk inside it.
Harry frowned. The kitten was grey with round black spots encircling its green eyes. “I should get new glasses,” he decided.
He didn’t want that to die. It was more than just his own magic he was mourning; he began to mourn also the magic of the world, all these things that could not be replicated without it.
And then there’s Beirut Malfoy. Beirut Draco, really. He looks a lot like Harry’s Malfoy, the one no one else sees but him. Or at least, the one no one else
Draco nodded once. “We need to maintain a delicate balance.”
“We were

to. It doesn’t feel…natural.”
“I didn’t realize you were so into biology,” he said. She shrugged, smiling proudly at the sculpture.
It ignored her, still baring its teeth.
“I’m just so happy to be a man. Even when I don’t have an erection, thus why I made the penis soft.”
He tapped some more. “Here we go.”
“What passed?” asked Harry.
Draco shuddered, and retreated to the corner of the classroom.
Draco shrugged, ran the tip of this finger around his glass and made the crystal sing. Harry’s skin tingled deliciously. “Do you support their policies, the way they govern?”
He chanced a glance at Draco, and found him regarding Harry with a carefully blank expression. “There are also hands,” said Draco. “Single, attractive people don’t engage in affairs with one another just because they’re of compatible sexual orientations and states of freedom.”
Harry swallowed heavily. “Know what?”
They sat down across from Harry with their own cups and a plate of biscuits between them. They each took a biscuit, their hands carefully maneuvering around without bumping, as if they did it every day, and they probably did, knowing Ron’s love of biscuits.
“That’s where it’s getting pulled out,” Draco told him. “You need to focus on blockading that spot so your magic can’t get by.”
looking at other men.”
All eyes and dozens of video cameras were on Draco. A number of reporters held tape recorders out with one hand and scribbled notes on their pads with the other. Draco scanned the crowd and then nodded, apparently satisfied.
Malfoy grinned devilishly and Harry wondered why he had ever bothered with wanking to Malfoy when he could’ve had this so much sooner. The past few weeks were a blur of anxiety and exuberance, of being scared witless and finally feeling like he was in the right place.
Andromeda remained unimpressed. Teddy finished his Niffler Nuggets and pushed his bowl aside, trading it for his homework from day school. Andromeda flicked her wand and sent the bowl to the sink, not taking her eyes from Harry or Draco.
Immediately, he felt guilty. Teddy was only seven himself, and doing a fine job with multiplication on the whole. Harry was just upset, and mentally lashing out.
They passed through more of the city. Draco squinted; further to the south, beyond the aqueduct and row of windmills, he would swear he saw destroyed buildings, scorch marks and broken walls. There was a shipyard in the far harbour, though several of the ships looked worse for wear.
“That’s Draco,” said Draco. His voice was scratchy, as if he’d been strangled. Harry winced. “You can see its tail just there, between Ursa Major and Minor. It’s a circumpolar constellation. It never goes away, but it’s never very noticeable. It’s subtle.”
“From my discussions with Her Majesty,” Severus spoke up, “we believe we’ve determined they’re from the…
Harry writes, which, okay, it’s melodramatic, but in case no one’s noticed yet, he’s a jobless, partnerless, voiceless, sanityless bloke who’s been dead at least once before. He’s entitled at this point.
But Draco was disappointed in himself that it had taken his mother sending a news clipping for him to piece it together.
Well, actually, now that Draco thought of it—and adding the students from all his classes so far—pretty much everyone, even Potter, seemed to accept his presence by now. Maybe he was being prematurely paranoid. Which, he thought, was pretty fair given the situation his family was in. He had a son to protect, after all.
“Malfoy?” said Harry.
“What?” Petunia said. “Why?”
. “Maybe it will give them some perspective.”
The hall was sullenly silent. Even the Hufflepuffs looked resentful.
Draco snarls at him and throws the formerly white (now orange) shirt at Harry. It hits his face and flops to the floor. “Orange is a derivative of red, you fuckwit!”
Luna hmms in response. “You’re referring to Draco? And the fact that he moved to Beirut four weeks ago?”
“But you won’t now,” said Eloise, brushing her auburn hair back from her face. “To know a problem is to half-defeat it.”
On his fifth caipirinha, which Harry suspected was stronger than a typical firewhiskey and ice water, the world was spinning pleasantly and the blaring noise of the parade fuzzed into a dull, gently rolling hum in his head. Zeph was currently snogging a very fetching parade performer that he’d somehow coaxed from the parade itself. Harry didn’t think that this was how his dating show was supposed to go, but he was too warm and drunk to care. All of the cameramen ran over to film Zeph and Harry took the opportunity to sidle up to Malfoy. He stumbled into him and Malfoy fell against the barrier.
“Yeah, you did. Your voice is healing?” Draco asks. He takes a few steps closer, eyes cutting to the orange and red folders in Harry’s hand before flicking back to Harry’s face.
Harry manfully didn’t give him the pleasure of a response. “Have you heard anything from Murdoch?” he asked instead. “Ron sent me a text… seems like something’s weird over there.”
He was already half out of the bed and through the sitting room by the time Malfoy snapped out a
Severia shifted in her sleep, stretching out as if she owned the place—the place being Harry’s arms—which she probably did. But Harry had a feeling they were both trying to pull the wool over, so he set her down on the floor. She blinked sleepily at him for a moment, and then, with whatever the cat-equivalent was to a shrug, she pressed her front paw to the portrait. The gentleman in the Botticelli reached down and scratched at his canvas by her cheek. She obligingly rubbed against it, mrewed once, and the portrait swung open.
“Use the Keurig,” Hermione said from the breakfast bar, not looking up from her iPad, upon which she was reading the
Hermione snorted, but shook her head. The cat was long gone by now, probably in Slytherin territory. “I hate that bloody cat. He leaves white fur all over my robes and he’s afraid of
Harry takes the folder from him, and their fingers touch briefly. It’s happened thousands of times before when they were passing cases back and forth, when they drank together, when they crammed onto Harry’s tiny couch for two-player games. It shouldn’t feel electric now—and it doesn’t; it feels like his blood has been set alight and it’s pounding through the tiny vessels at his wrists, sending an agonising ache reverberating up his arm, pulsing with each of his heavy heartbeats.
Draco turns and calls over his shoulder. “Don’t need to. Had someone else do it for me last night.”
Millicent frowned, didn’t bother continuing on with that argument. “So how are we going to get Dudley back from these
Harry hesitated only a moment. “Yeah.”
“You really should’ve taken me up on those Nargle scouting expeditions I invited you to after Hogwarts,” Luna says. “Do you know which countries border Ireland?”
right now!”
Narcissa wrote Draco on Sunday. Harry watched the big, grey eagle owl land daintily in front of the coffee carafe in the staff room, where McGonagall was debriefing the first year apprentices on the end of their Yule term. Severia and Peep jumped up, batting at its tail, and Harry was embarrassed that his kneazle had picked up such annoying habits from such an annoying cat. He swept her up, sending McGonagall a guilty look, and settled her in his lap for vigourous petting.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I can be good at more than one thing. Just like you can be average at more than one thing.”
Harry glanced back at the Zwei lying on the bedside table next to the uncapped bottle of lube. “It’s not really a good time.”
“I intend to meet a nice congressman and have him put forward legislation I compose in my own favour,” Narcissa explained, unconcerned. “Or perhaps draft some myself. One makes the best of any situation, doesn’t one?”
“Mate, it’s fine,” said Lee.
going to go there. “Draco and I can work on our project while you sit over there in your linseed oil and try to dry.”
Kyle frowned. “That’s gonna be tough. The NoMajes over here don’t like being told what to do. Even when it would help them out.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m a field chemist, stupid. I spent most of the last five years actually swimming around in the stuff.”
The day of his trial came, and Potter had shown up. Potter had testified for him. Draco had walked that day just like in the dream—not free, certainly, but at least not to Azkaban. He’d been escorted to his home and locked within the grounds for the next five years.
, Harry thought in resignation.
By Hermione’s snort, Harry guessed she’d suspected as much all along.
Draco got the cauldron fire going while Harry and Snape flicked through copies of various Alchemical texts and personal notes.
“I did not!” Harry says, striding forward. “Let me see.”
Harry fluttered around in the air, pleased but clumsy with his wings. He half-glided, half-fell back to the ground, closed his eyes, and focused on transforming back into himself.
Harry bit his lip, nodding. Malfoy nipped at his earlobe and then continued down. He kissed down Harry’s chest, pausing only long enough to suck each of his nipples and soon he was dropping to the floor, his knees thumping against the wood. He laved at Harry’s hipbones as his fingers worked open the buttons of Harry’s jeans. He tugged them sharply down and off Harry’s legs and Harry gasped, biting his lip to keep from making a sound. He could feel Malfoy’s hot breath panting against his prick through the fabric of his pants.
So he just held Potter’s hand as they walked, replaying that stupid dream over and over again and feeling a strange, detached sort of calm.
There were even sects of ancient magical people who only performed wandless magic—a feat Draco found both impressive and unnecessary. He remembered how hard controlling those first few spells was as a first year with a wand, and also the first wandless spell he ever learned in sixth year. Both had been exhausting both mentally and magically. He couldn’t imagine spending years upon years learning just a half-dozen spells when one could learn hundreds instead.
For all his determination, he was sort of terrified of actually approaching Malfoy. But he’d Sorted well, and by the end of the week, he’d convinced himself to get it over with. It was a nightmare about being an Auror that finally settled matters. Anything was better than that. Even Potions. Even three years as Snape’s apprentice.
Harry had no intention whatsoever of doing that.
Although, he’d let Malfoy control
Harry turns to him, knowing he looks like a hot mess of anxiety and bad hair.
“The way you say it…” said Draco. His voice caught, and he shook himself.
Here Harry was, possibly staring down at the end of his world as he knew it. With only
“At least one of us could then,” muttered Harry. Then, “Look, I just wanted to talk about the thing…the Statute, and Atlantis, and I figured you’d know a lot about it, and also that you’d be equally disturbed by the Statute being threatened and, you know, what that might mean. After the ICW ruined our chances of working with Atlantis. I’m going to go mad thinking about this alone in my quarters. Can we just, I don’t know, talk?”
Draco shrugged. “I like to weigh my options.”
“Hi, Draco,” said Teddy.
Draco pushes him away and spins around, pacing back and forth with his hands pulling at his hair. Harry hasn’t seen him like this in years. He’s always had a stronger control over manic episodes than Ron. Or maybe Ron’s just
They both blush. Harry resolutely continues his polite smile.
, Harry writes.
“I have one—very invasive—idea,” Malfoy said quietly. It was meant for just the two of them, but no doubt at least some of the video cameras’ microphones picked it up.
Addolgar Rees caught him outside of Transfigurations. “Walk with me, Harry,” he said. “I’ve been reading that book you ordered, the one on Muggle chemicals.”
“Oh!” said Hermione, standing up and running to her room.
Harry shivered as he got up from his bed, hopping across the frigid fucking floor to grab his tartan dressing gown from the back of his door. He shrugged it on, practically vibrating with cold and cursed his lack of forethought into built-in Warming Charms on the floor. He’d been putting it off, rationalising that it wasn’t quite cold enough to bother with yet.
“Yes.”
Harry nodded. “No one’s ever made me come before.”
So that was what he was seeing McGonagall about. “I’ll pay you.”
They strolled into Defence a few minutes before class started. Malfoy was there they arrived, which was not unusual. Next to him sat Neville, which was. It wasn’t until that moment that Harry realised Neville hadn’t answered his question about where he was last night. Were he and Malfoy…?
“Do you have a pet?”
“I’ve got loads of them,” Draco said, still staring intently at the mica in the middle. “McGonagall’s had me on mineral transfigurations for a month.
Ron threw himself back on the bed as if living were too much to bear. “Please tell me you’re having me on.”
Draco lifted his hips. Harry’s eyes rolled back. He gasped, rolled his own slowly forward, but Draco grabbed his hips and dragged him in, hard, and it was all over from there. It was too much to hold back and Harry was not a man built on a foundation of patience to begin with. Draco encouraged him, hooking his legs around Harry’s waist and rocking up into him with a talent Harry
“A wardrobe.”
“Hello, Mr Malfoy,” said the man. “I usually don’t see you in so late.”
“Anyway,” said Zach Smith. “This is heart-warming and whatever, but can we get back to the important things? Potter was onto something before he started sucking face with his partner in Seven Years of Unresolved Sexual Tension.”
“You… love me,” Draco says yet again, suspicious and bewildered.”
The Muggles saw all of this, and some reacted. It could be seen in the photographs – their wide eyes tracking the swish of a wand or the glow of a healer’s hands on a chest. But others noticed and kept working, kept pulling people from beneath roofs and bricks, kept pumping chests in helpless cases. And the Obliviators just watched.
Ron would never let him live it down if he didn’t.
Hermione returned with their basket of ingredients and he set to work finely slicing the herbs per the book’s directions, and chopping the animal bits with less finesse to save time. On his NEWTs, he’d only get a set amount of time to brew his potion. He knew now that he could save time on the fatty bits because of the way fat reacted with other ingredients.
“No problem,” said Dudley. “I saw it in Waterstones and it seemed just the thing.”
“Muggles don’t have banishing spells for rubbish,” Harry said. “When they need to toss something out, it has to be picked up and taken away. It usually gets taken to a landfill – a spot that’s set aside for burying rubbish.”
Harry made a small sound in the back of his throat, a sound he wouldn’t have been able to prevent if he tried. He took three steps forward and pressed his mouth to Malfoy’s. Malfoy arched into him, his mouth falling open, and the heat of his body soaking into Harry’s own.
Thick, white ropes of spunk hit Malfoy’s chest and Harry, absurdly, gets a brief flash of inspiration for next year’s summer line. Abstracted white stripes. Very nautical. He doesn’t have time to consider it in further detail before Malfoy’s throwing his head back screaming as he empties his cock inside Harry.
Is Ron?
“Please tell me about your plan,” Petunia said, taking a seat.
“You’re winding up for a fight,” Snape murmured. “Despite his insouciant tone, Draco just shared something deeply personal with you. He’s been enamoured of Atlantis since he was four and Narcissa first told him the story. This…development will be both distressing and thrilling to him. I daresay he was trying to make a…connection—” Harry could hear the sneer in Snape’s voice, “—with you, suspecting you might feel the same.”
Malfoy shrugged. “How should I know? I’m not a fucking caterpillar healer.”
“Oh for god’s sake,” Hermione muttered, pushing around Harry to exit the alcove. “It’s not mysterious.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “No, obviously I have a thing for you…and blondes.” He tried for a saucy wink but rather suspected it came out like he had dirt in his eye. “I just wanna see how the other half lives.”
“I suppose,” said Teddy. He gathered his things into a tidy little pile, shuffling to make sure his maths worksheet was on top. Harry supposed he could see the banker in him already. Remus would probably be delighted, he thought with a sigh.
Harry glared at him, then spun on his heel and stomped upstairs. He’d hardly unpacked. There wasn’t much to pack away. The bed was still unslept-in. He tossed his laundry into the Grimmauld Place attic and collected Mrs Black’s portrait.
That doesn’t mean that he actually expected it to happen, though. When it starts to feel amazing again, it catches him by surprise, so the loud, slutty whine he makes can’t be held against him.
In November, the door to Harry’s rooms opened quite without his permission, and he turned from his reclined reading position on the rug to find Millicent Bulstrode holding a very irate-looking Dark Lady, who, if Harry was not mistaken, had died the previous September.
“Neither am I,” said Anthony. “I’d find it very fascinating if I were, so don’t even try to give me that boring Shakespeare stuff. The only gay people in this room are you and Harry, and Harry hasn’t even figured it out yet.”
Harry goes. He’s been doing a lot of that lately. Luna would be proud. Probably.
“So, Malfoy wasn’t arrested at Customs,” Ron says. “Or if he was, they chose not to extradite him. We didn’t get any calls from the Lebanese Ministry complaining about annoying blond ferrets, so I guess he hasn’t pissed anyone off yet.”
“How about your bonding research?” Harry asks.
“You love me,” he said, pressing close to Draco’s mouth.
She stared at him for several more minutes, each one more agonising than the last. Draco said nothing. Finally, she sighed, and said, “But you saved him. At great personal risk, as I understand it. Severus tells me that you remained inside the same lethal fumes with no regard for your own person, trying to get Draco to safety.”
“No worries there,” said Ron, his hand coming down to pat Harry’s back. “I’ve no interest in visiting the United States.”
“Sure, yeah,” said Harry. “Now they put a liner down at the bottom so the nasty stuff can’t leak out, but they used to just dig a hole. The place my sample came from is one of the old ones, without a liner.”
He wanted to be there for Draco, but that was selfish. So, he turned away, fiddled with the egg beater on the workbench, and reminded himself that Draco didn’t want him around anymore, especially not at a time like this.
“You can tell you don’t really like Potions that much,” Malfoy added, and Harry hated him all the more for being able to read him so well. Merlin fuck, he was
He sighed. This was what defeat felt like. If he was honest with himself, Harry had known before he ever came up the spiral stairs that there was no getting rid of Malfoy. Not now that he’d signed the teaching contract.
Malfoy was like Fiendfyre, probably. It was not good to be near him, even if he did warm Harry up.
“When are they coming home?”
Only three of his students managed to send their mouse’s soul back in time to reattach to its earthly body and live again, but Draco was pleased anyway.
“I’m serious,” she said. As one, they turned to look at the Slytherin table. Harry saw Blaise Zabini chatting Ginny up yet again, but otherwise, nothing looked out of the ordinary.
“I just see…me. Right now. Like looking in a normal mirror.”
Draco had snuggled up close to Harry and that was basically the most amazing thing that could’ve happened, and so Harry’s night was made.
“Of course, numbnuts,” Draco said. “I loved you then, too.”
: (n) an uncontrollable, obsessive need to think.]
“Mother,” said Malfoy, and took her in his arms for a fierce hug. He pulled back, studied her face, and said nothing before turning to Lucius. “Father. You look well.”
Harry scowls some more. The truth is that he’s been so busy trying to think of subtle ways to keep Malfoy here that he completely forgot that he was, in fact, leaving tomorrow morning. Like a bad memory, he’s blocked it out.
“Surely morning,” said Draco, though he couldn’t be certain without a
“14 new and exciting ways to please your wizard,” Dawlish drawls as he takes the seat next to Harry’s bed. “A holiday away from my bratty teenaged kids would be new and exciting; was that on the list?”
Draco snorted. “Please, spare me, Albus Dumbledore. You may enjoy flinging yourself from cliffs, eating sweets from Weasley twins, and interacting with muggles, but I have common sense, and my common sense says it’s stupid to start out with the most dangerous option when we could test others first.”
“Oh, dude, I could’ve told you that you want to convert your currency at Primer Banco Mágico in San Diego. Something about the time zones. The goblins there always give a better rate. Not worth the hassle for a few Euro, but if you’re bringing over a bunch, it’s worth it. Plus the airport vendors always shift you.”
Harry watched his face contorting as he spoke to the hat and the hat spoke back. Ron wasn’t budging. After several minutes – certainly longer than anyone else’s sorting – the Hat called out, “Gryffindor!”
Potter yawned, pushed himself up to sitting. He snapped his fingers, illuminated by the blue light of Draco’s time charm, and his wand sailed into his hand. “
“Not like the
It didn’t take more than a couple of weeks before Narcissa was able to give them news about the rubbish osmosis ward for the shoreline. An ambitious project, but they were an ambitious group. It was heading into autumn now, and the leaves were beginning to colour and fall in the city. The mornings and nights were chilly, but the days still remained warm.
Hermione lifted her head and hmm’d. “You’re right,” she said. “As am I. Well, then… not a product. A service. We’re both great at lots of things. We could surely adapt our talents to a new service for magical people.”
“Mm,” Luna agrees. “The grey beneath the diffusers. It’ll refract so enigmatically.”
"Never that,” Harry promised, smiling.
“I love that we did this together,” Harry adds, his heart swelling. “I wouldn’t want it with anyone else.”
They returned to DC feeling invigorated and energised. One part of the problem was on its way to being solved: getting the physical rubbish out of the water so the Mers and other creatures wouldn’t choke on it.
Harry suddenly couldn’t breathe. It wasn’t funny anymore. “Match what?” he said.
The Queen sat, then gave them a smile. “Please sit.”
– no doubt what Snape made all his potions out of
“Oh for Ceridwen’s sake,” Draco muttered. He slammed his wardrobe shut, and turned to face them. “I’ve had enough. Could the two of you be more Hufflepuff?”
She eyes him. Not suspiciously, because he’s been an Auror for seven years and he knows how to not look guilty by now. “You bored, Potter?”
Harry thought this over some. “Slytherins are groupy, too. Aren’t you accustomed to being around a lot of people?” Harry sure as hell wasn’t, but he was feeling a little looser from the wine, so it was all fine.
He shrugged, smiling. “Annoying Weasley without having to actually do anything.” He paused, gave Hermione a look. “And I would
Mr Weasley lifted his eyebrows at that, as if to say, ‘better you than me,’ and slipped out of the room. Harry rolled out of bed and pulled on a shirt. It was Ron’s, but that never stopped him before.
“Darling, how are
Harry, Hermione, and Lee did not end up reaching their liaison's office on Pennsylvania Avenue until after five. She gave them a very flat look when they opened the door and stepped inside, pushing her glasses on top of her greying head and setting a ballpoint pen down on the blotter with decisive movement.
“Gudreegza, Grigget,” she said to Teddy. “Ag Griphook…” and then a lot more Harry couldn’t catch. She gave him a small bow and disappeared through the doors leading to the back of the bank.
“Fuck,
“Huh ,” Draco said, taking a sip from his coffee canteen. “I suppose I see the resemblance. But she’s so skinny—decent enough face, I suppose.”
Harry shrugged. He was fine with a brisk pace. “I didn’t want to say ‘Slytherins’ because I’m thirty years old, but I meant Slytherins.”
Well, he’s sure that Draco really isn’t feeling very sad about the loss of Harry because he literally
"Cedric!" Harriet gasped as she ran head first into his chest.
"I knew you were, that is why I wrote them," Harriet opened her mouth in effect. Merry pushed her elbow softly into her forearm and clicked her tongue. Soon all of the Gryffindors piled in a few seconds before the bell rang. The students sat there for a few moments but the teacher came in, a ghost.
Harriet frowned a bit at that, "But Merry and Pansy also do that?"
"Nice, you excited?" Pansy asked.
"I have a lot of these families in my blood," Harriet thought back to her visit with the Goblins that showed her bloodline, she was starting to realize how intertwined Purebloods truly are.
"I heard that you were going to try out for seeker next year and I don't want you to think that I am stealing your spot. I don't want you to be mad at me," She pouted which made Draco's heart melt.
"We can do it next year!" Merry rubbed her back comfortingly. "Promise!"
"Yep!" Merry giggled while Harriet smiled into her blanket. Cara unlatched the fireplace so they could use the floo, Merry and Harriet went first. Harriet held onto her blanket tightly and Beetlejuice tightly squeezed her torso, he really hates the Floo so they try to use it as little as possible. Harriet closed her eyes while Merry grips her arm so make sure they aren't separated.
"Let's go flying!"
"That's the best part of it, you don't have to say anything to bond. You can get to know others by listening to them," Merry explained.
Merry chuckled, "Are you better now sweetie?" Harriet nodded, which made her unruly hair go everywhere. Harriet gave up on making it straight then curly, too much work in the morning. Plus she liked it when it was messy, it annoyed Pansy a lot. Her contacts were also itchy lately so she has been wearing glasses lately, they were big rimmed glasses with a black frame and some gold on the side for details. Merry refused for Harriet to wear her old ones, saying they looked horrid on her. Her glasses also annoyed Pansy, saying the glasses distracted people from her vibrant green eyes.
"No," Harry frowned.
"Wait!" Harry shouted and held up her hands. The cat stared at her still mid step but then went back into her sitting position. Harriet stumbled into the kitchen and grabbed a few biscuits that she made and a bowl full of milk. The cat was still sitting patiently waiting, flicking her tail every once and awhile. Harry sat down on the steps and placed the plate and bowl next to her. The cat walked over towards her and sat down in front of her. Harriet awkwardly picked the cat up and laid her down on her lap. She pet her softly, knowing how to pet cats from being babysat from Ms. Figgs. The cat stretched and purred from her gentle pets. She fed the cat ripped off pieces of biscuits and let her drink the milk on her own.
"I would love to sit by you," She giggled which made him blush harder. She sat down and looked behind her to see the rest of the Slytherins making dramatic faces at her sitting by the Gryffindors. She tried not to laugh at their faces. She looked at Hermione who was staring at her, probably wondering what she was thinking.
"Afternoon," She said dumbly, not knowing what to say. He just grunted in reply and turned to Riley.
"Is there something you want to tell me?" Merry asked.
"Holy shite!" Cedric swore, "That was amazing!"
She looked up at Riley who smiled, "Only Professors and Advanced Healers can get ahold of those books, even those books are quite rare for Professors. Snape and I know a few people," Riley smirked.
"Anyways I'm Seamus Finnigan," He smiled and stuck out his hand for her to shake. She shook it which she noticed he had a very firm grip.
Gryffindor didn't sound that bad to Harry but she was more brains than brawn definitely.
"Yeah I remember that some older girls helped us find our classes on our first day so I thought we could help you guys," She smiled.
Charms: -
"You will do perfectly fine in Hogwarts," He smiled. She finished the last bite of her egg roll and gave a piece chicken to Beetlejuice. He hissed at the feeling of a full stomach, he hasn't been full in a month. Harry was afraid to let him slip out of her cupboard to eat in case he never came back. She drank the other two vials which would make her gain weight easier in the future and not be lacking vitamins.
After they got up, what seemed to be 5 sets of stairs, Draco informed Harriet about his house, "Be careful in this house, it's very easy to get lost. Sometimes every I can get turned around here."
"Now Cedric can you bring Ms. Granger and Mr. Longbottom to their common room while Ms. Potter," Riley winked at her, " And Ms. Baxter can go back however they came here."
"I don't want to take his position though, maybe I can get out of this," Harriet really didn't want to ruin his dreams.
"Oh come on, you aren't really wanting to wait 2 weeks before we can properly fly," Merry gave her a look.
"Is that a Black Strangler?" Millicent gasped.
"She will shop with me and my mother, do you have a problem with that Terri?" Merry snapped back and put her hand on her hip. The lady just hung her head which made Merry smirk.
"I mean my uncle has his clients over for dinner but that's it," Harriet shrugged.
---------------------------
"What?" Harriet's voice was obviously shaky and high.
"No Lanson is the hottest," Harry shouted back.
"Yeah looks about the same as mine," Merry replied.
"Any class to be specific?"
"I. Don't. Know."
"You're not denying it!" The boys both shouted and ran after him. The girls didn't stop laughing until Merry opened a compartment that was not empty.
"Hey Harriet!" Pansy yelled, ruining the moment which made Draco sneer. "What movie do you want to watch?" She was flipping through Netflix, not even looking at them.
"Maybe just wear a nice sweatshirt and some nice pants," Merry offered while she applied some lipstick. Harriet got up and went back to into Draco's room to see him laying down blankets and pillows. There were a lot of snacks in the room now, Merry came out and grabbed a cupcake from the tray Draco was setting down. She ate it while Draco was running around trying to sort everything. Harriet just stood out of the way trying to understand what was happening. Harriet grabbed a sweatshirt and a pair of jeans to go change into. After she changed, Merry changed into a plain purple dress with black shoes. Draco then changed into emerald robes which made his silver hair stand out.
"Where were you? Sucking off a professor to get good grades?" Piers taunted.
"Do you have any shampoo or body wash?" Merry took some bottles out of her trunk. Harry blushed and shook her head. She forgot to buy some in Diagon Alley. "I figured, I brought you some," She tossed a pink bottle and a clear blue bottle at her. Harry caught both easily, she had good reflexes from dodging Dudley's punches or throwing things at her.
"Harriet doesn't feel good," Merry told the others.
"What did she say?" Draco asked as everyone was holding their breath.
"Well done, 5 points to Slytherin for actually caring to open up a book before class," He nodded and began to start the lesson. Harriet feel the pride run through her veins.
"I really don't think it is anything," She said honestly.
"It feels weird!" Harriet groaned. Merry was putting her hair up in a really tight ponytail. It felt so weird because Harriet always had it down to hide her scar. She had only ever tied it back when she was doing chores.
"Well I guess I am surprising," She shrugged. He chuckled deeply.
Harriet showed them to Draco who seemed quite excited, "Thank you, both of you." Riley's smiled widely at her while the edge of Severus's mouth twitched and he nodded at her.
"Gemma, none of the first year boys can be found," A 5th year girl informed Gemma.
"I will go get Riley," Millicent offered.
"It's a girl? Cool," Merry said while playing with the lock.
"So, are you two going to explain yourselves?" Riley tapped his foot waitingly.
"You're welcome Harriet, it was no problem. I've known all of that since I was like 4 years old," Draco shrugged but smiled regardless.
"Baxter, Merry." She walked up to the stool and sat down unfazed from anything. Merry didn't seem scared when the hat went on her head. The only thing Merry was worried about was that Harry and she would not get into the same house.
( Years Back )
"I studied most of the courses for 7 years and I have probably read half of the books in the Wizarding World," She giggled.
Before he could ask if she was alright, she said, "You owe me one, I don't quite like getting random goop all over me." Harriet glared at Ron and Seamus snickering at her word chose.
"We are only going away for like a few weeks," Merry laughed.
"He was going to try out next year for seeker," Tracey explained.
Draco was the first to break the silence, "I guess... that makes sense."
(See the end of the chapter for
"That doesn't answer anything!" Merry growled and scratched her head frustratedly.
"First years and second years are forbidden to be out after 9:00 pm, except for emergencies and classes. Trust me if you break these rules, you will regret it," His voice deepened and glared at each first year student. He seemed to glare at her the most, she just smiled at him kindly. From a young age, Harry was always told that her smile could make even the most brutal winters turn into the most beautiful, blossoming spring. His glare and frown altered at her bright, innocent smile which made Harry smirk. He snarled at her and said, "Trust me, I will know if you break any of these rules," He said to the room but did not make his glare leave her. Harry did not let her innocent act falter at his glare, she stared straight into his black eyes that could make anyone fall into fear caused by them and smiled at him. She smiled straight into someone who was trying to make her scared and submissive. She has spent so many years being scared and submissive, she refused to let herself continue that way here. This was her chance to really be someone.
"Alright, amazing job students!" Professor Hooch clapped her hands together. They got off the brooms and put them back in the shed. As Harriet walked back to the castle she could see someone watching her from a window on the 4th floor, Flint.
"Are these some first years?" A different girl asked.
"This is the entrance to the common room, it has a password that changes every new moon phase. The passwords will always be posted inside by the door. If you ever get locked out just knock on the door or wait for an older year who knows the password," Gemma explained. "Professor Snape is inside waiting to explain the rules, I hope you will find the Slytherins as a family and Hogwarts to be your home," Jason growled but it seemed in a nicer more comforting tone.
"I usually drank warm milk or hot chocolate to tire me out. I had a lot of sleeping problems after I was pregnant with Draco, he was-" She sighed and shook her head lightly while smiling lovingly at the memory, "Restless for his young age."
Merry walked the halls alone, feeling a bit lost without Harriet. They had become very close in only a few months, they just got along so good. They helped each other with everything from homework to more personal things. Merry knows about Harriet's constant nightmares and she knows about Merry's personal problems like self-image and confidence.
"I have insomnia so I can drink this and sleep for only 10 minutes and get 10 hours of sleep," Harry explained and downed the potion. It tastes like water but slightly orange. Mr. Feose always makes sure that the potions she takes never tastes bad. Merry slowly took the potion still weary. They climbed into the bed and quickly feel asleep. Harry slept for 10 minutes while Merry slept for 12. Harry woke up stretching, feeling completely refreshed. Merry woke up the same way and looked over at her.
"Really?" She gasped hopefully, she clutched the book in excitement.
"But nothing," The house elf flinched in fear at the elder wizards tone, "Since her guardians said no such thing, she has the ability to spend the Holidays who she chooses best. Good day." His robes swished as he left and his cane clicked satisfiedly, the house elf was whimpering in fear of being hit. Dumbledore stared at nothing in particular for a while after the dark wizard left. Potter let someone else do the arguing, maybe she wasn't as cunning as he thought?
That night Harriet was the last to fall asleep, Merry and Draco fell asleep as soon as their heads hit their pillows. Merry seemed to take up most of the room in Draco's large bed.  After Harriet got up to calm herself some more, Draco just curled up against another pillow and slept quietly. Harriet was sitting near a window, looking at Marcus's gift to her. She undid the red ribbon slowly, she was curious to see what he got her. She slid off the cover and gasped when she saw the necklace, it was a simple chained necklace with the Slytherin crest on it. For some reason, holding the Slytherin crest in her hands made her eyes start to tear up. She rubbed away her tears, not wanting to cry over a gift. But seeing that crest, knowing that she truly does belong in Slytherin where this necklace proves how much she belongs there, it creates a overwhelming sense of pride and happiness. Even more than when she got her Hogwarts letter or when she caught the first snitch, this was her very own symbol that she belongs. That was more than she ever could ask for.
Will always find their kind;"
"Oh yeah, Accio toad," Harry stood and swished her wand that she got a week ago that was shipped to her. Ollivander said it was the hardest wand he has ever made but he was very proud of himself.
"Because of the law that passed like 10 years ago." Harry finished for Merry. Merry's mother nodded as if remembering the day it happened. They all finished their ice cream and went to a shop which was filled with Muggle stuff. Merry went to the smart phones and started to show Harry which ones were the best. In the end, Harry got an iPhone 6 which was gold, two Muggle cameras, one Polaroid and the other digital, a laptop where she could draw on a little slab and it would be on the computer, and a phone case where you can use the slab to draw on to design the phone case. Both Harry and Merry bought a lot of earbuds because Merry always broke them and Harry knew she was going to lose them. Merry gave Harry her number right away. Harry was ecstatic, she had her first friend! Merry's mother left to buy the girls their main school supplies.
"Climb in," He said while climbing in a metal cart. She did while making sure not to slip and fall because it seemed like something she would do. As soon as she sat on a seat, the cart shot of like a rocket which made Harry scream a little bit. The cart went through a series of turns and ups and downs. Harry closed her eyes, not wanting to vomit on the goblin. The cart finally stopped which made Harry sigh in relieve. The goblin looked unfazed by the ride, probably from doing it so much. He got up to the vault and asked for the key. She got up out of the cart, swaying a bit and handed him her key. Griphook opened the vault which was her parents. Harry gasped when she saw the vault filled to the brim with coins. She slowly walked in, she couldn't believe she has so much money! To be honest, it kind of disgusted her to see she had this much money. Other people are poor and homeless while she is the richest person in the Wizarding World and doing nothing with her money. She was afraid before this that she would not have enough for her school supplies and couldn't go to Hogwarts because she would not have the supplies. Harry got frustrated and angry when she remembered all of the times she was in her cupboard starving and wished for death to greet her just to get out of that place. She could have had a normal childhood where she was loved and not hungry but no she had to be with the Dursleys'. She kicked a few coins on the floor and turned to the goblin.
"He is trying to impress you, you know," Merry whispered into her ear.
"And could the Ministry interfere with my guardian changing?"
"Maybe it's because the wand hasn't been made yet," Harry suggested.
"You think it is right for them to kill the troll!" Harriet whispered harshly while putting on pants and a jacket.
She sneered at her shaking niece, "Freak." She slammed the door of the cupboard in her face, that day she was the first day she didn't eat at all. All she could do was cry softly in her shirt and play with the little spiders who seemed confused by her presence. She still would squeal when one brushed up against her leg. The dark scared her so much, but after a while, she got used to it. She found it comforting, she found the unknown exciting, thrilling. The dark hid her, protected her from harm while the light only
"Yes, sorry Professor. We got lost on our way here," The redhead spoke up.
"I'm good," She smiled brightly.
"Wow really?" He whistled at her impressed, it worked!
"I think he is really nice," Harriet frowned. Draco's eyes widen, he regretted his comment as soon as he saw the hurt look on her face.
"Okay, you promise that you will take extra care of her," She pouted and swung the cat around a bit.
"Harriet?" She turned towards Merry confused. "I just want to warn you a bit before the party, so-" Merry patted next to her, Harriet slowly walked over and sat tensely. "You know how Slytherin's tend to be self-preserved. Well, that's mostly because people have betrayed them or hurt them, and they begin to value themselves over people because they know no one else will help them. This causes most Slytherin to become isolated, which can cause bitterness and steer them in the wrong way. A lot of the families, all most all of them, are these type of people. People have hurt them and they turned the wrong way in life. And they tend to spread their negativity to their future generations, so a lot of the people you will meet have very different opinions than you. Their opinions are less," Merry struggled for the right words, to her this was her family she was talking about, "humane and civil. The people that you will meet, to them it's their only happy event in their year. They come from very bad homes and Christmas will others that know their pain, it's very special to them. Slytherin's stick close to those who are similar." Merry had tears dripping down her face, Harriet wiped them away as soon as they fell.
The hat chuckled, "Don't fear me young one, now let's see. Hmm... you are brave but you are more wits and have more of a ready mind. It would be sickening to not put you in a house that wouldn't build on that mind of yours. Ravenclaw would do you good, you would gain tremendous amounts of knowledge. Hufflepuff would let you keep your values of peace and fairness but nothing else good will come your way. Slytherin would be the best for you, you would become very quick thinking and cunning which you already are, to be honest."
"I did it!" She giggled.
(Btw we hit over 200 kudos which is so amazing, thank you guys so much <3 <3 <3 )
"Yeah, I guess I really didn't think of it till now," She chuckled softly, trying not to cry.
"He is so good looking!" Daphne giggled.
-------------------------------------
"What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?"
"Merry, I'm so scared!" Harriet whined, they were getting ready for the Christmas party at Malfoy's. They were arriving a day earlier to hang out with Draco and help Harriet get more acquainted with the manor.
"Have you eaten yet?" He asked after she was done rubbing.
"You have not introduced yourself, professor," Flint grunted.
Harriet shifted awkwardly and looked down at her feet, "I was wondering where Draco and Merry were, I was looking for them. Sorry for bothering you." Her face was warmed from embarrassment.
"I'm in."
"What do you want?" She hissed at her frightened niece only the age of 3.
"Why?"
"He said that because she is a know-it-all, she has no friends," Merry sneered at the memory.
Keys: 2
"Yeah, Merry invited me."
"Will you two be quiet I'm sure the old bimbo of a headmaster can hear you?!" Millicent whispered harshly.
"What do you want to do Harry?" Pansy asked, having also seen her excitement.
"He is a very beautiful bird," She cooed and petted the bird when it flicked its head towards her. It cooed and seemed to like being pet.
"Yes, they both have keys to all of your vaults. Your parents wanted Riley to keep your keys and the Ministry doesn't really trust him so Dumbledore also keeps your keys," He explained.
"Oh sure, you can ask me anything," Merry ran her fingers through her hair.
Sorry for any typos, kudos and comments are appreciated!
"Yes we can," She giggled. Merry picked out a light purple ribbon and tied it around her neck. The kitten kept gnawing on Merry's fingers as she tied the ribbon. The two girls left to see Merry's mother outside.
"You will do fine and if you don't," Derek shrugged, "It's your first game, no one will blame you. They will probably blame Marcus for teaching you."
"That was very nice of them," Merry said as she slung her book bag over her shoulder.
Harry walked slowly to Mr. Feose's shop, wanting to disappear. She always has wanted to disappear but the want to prove the Dursleys' wrong overrode that want. She is very determined to prove to them that yes, she is a freak but she is so much more than that. Do you ever have thoughts that go like, 'I could kill that person and it would be like nothing happened'? Well, Harry had those thoughts a lot, they mostly came after one of the Dursleys' would hurt her. After her Uncle or her Aunt beat her, and after Dudley and his friends would make fun of her or beat her. Even though Harry has these thoughts, you have to understand, she is completely innocent. She would never want to hurt a fly. It is funny that people say that phrase, they are so innocent that they wouldn't even hurt a fly. Honestly, to truly be innocent the phrase should be they are so innocent they wouldn't hurt the person holding a gun to their head. That way it shows true innocence, not wanting to hurt anyone even the one planning your death. The definition of innocent is to not hurt or harm even though the definition changes in different mouths. It takes a lot of will power to not harm the one planning your death. So that is what Harry is, innocent. She does not wish for them to die, in her eyes, every single life is worth living, even the Dursleys'.
"Draco you brought me pumpkin juice?" She cooed and walked over to him which made him blush even more. She kissed his cheek lightly and smiled at him. He didn't really know what to do so he just smiled back.

"Sort of, I substitute classes at Hogwarts if needed and also help students tremendously with planning for life after Hogwarts. I teach in another wizarding school that is more old fashioned like Druids or Sorcerers/Sorceresses. It also is available to highly advanced Hogwarts students who want to take some extra classes. I teach Majoring in the Art of Caring For and Training Dragons and Multiple Other Beasts or as my students like to call it 'Dragons Class'," He chuckled.
"That was so nerve racking, so much peer pressure!" Harry giggled.
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Merry turned to her, "We need to leave but we will be right back I promise."
"Who were they?" Merry whispered loudly.
"Harriet!" Both Cedric and Merry yelled and followed her. Hermione was on the floor under the sinks, or what was sinks, dodging the troll's stick which was accidentally smashing things. Cedric jumped in front of Harriet and held up his wand. The troll looked at him confused.
Harriet Lillian Potter
"She just seemed tired Draco, she just needs rest," Pansy hissed at him for thinking she is on the verge of death.
"She is fine, Riley said she just needs a few days rest," Merry explained. "Her eyes hurt, she has a sore throat and a low-grade fever but she just really needed the sleep." Merry was then bombarded by a bunch of 'tell her I said I hope she feels better' and 'Hopefully she isn't coming down with anything serious'. Even the older students seemed worried.
"Professor, what is this about?" She asked nervously.
"Only guardians are allowed to say if their young can stay at Hogwarts. Did they say such a thing?"
'There will be a threat that we will be dark and divided,
"Excellent job," McGonagall complimented her.
The man laughed which sounded like... well Harry didn't know how to explain his laugh. His laugh was beautiful like the rest of him.
"How is this fun?"
The goblin sighed, "Well you can technically pick whoever you want to take you in."
Harriet stumbled out of her little room, her feet tripping in her big pajama pants. She had a nightmare about some lady with red hair and a really loud noise which scared her awake. Dudley and her were starting daycare the next day, she was really excited to meet all the new kids. Maybe they would be nicer to her than Dudley who always tends to push her. But she likes looking at his teddy bear with different colored eyes so she doesn't mind.
"I'm Harriet Potter but everyone calls me Harry," Harry blushed and covered her scar more with her hair. The three Hufflepuffs gasped but said nothing.
"Thank you," Blaise whispered to her because she freed him from Draco's long rants. Blaise quickly left to escape Draco.
"Look at this precious kitten!" She cooed at a small gray kitten with one green eye and one brown eye. The kitten could fit in one hand and it meowed at the two girls. The kitten clawed at the cage and meowed sadly.
Dumbledore was humming lightly and sucking on a lemon drop while messing with papers on his desk. There was a knock on his fireplace. He called in and waited for the visitor to come to his desk. The clicks of shoes, the patter of small bare feet, and the swishing of robes told him immediately who was in his office.
"When will everyone get-" Harriet started off but saw a pair of twins enter behind Draco. They were scary identical and they were quite willowly with long black hair and a tall frame.
"What you talking to the kitten?"
"My parents will also be nice to you, they will honestly love you as their own. Their political views will not affect that. Don't worry about it, I have a plan."
"Chinese please," He nods and dials the phone number. Over the years the Wizarding World has become more open to muggle technology, not all wizards but most.
Malfoy remained his posture hard and strong, "Ms. Potter-"
"Alright?" Harriet didn't see where this was heading.
"I'm Riley Woods." Harry gasped softly, not loud enough to gain any attention. This was the other man who had her keys and was very close to her parents. He knew her parents, he grew up with them.
Where they are just and loyal,
"I am getting one later," Harry explained. Mr. Feose promised to get Harry a snake for her birthday. Merry was still getting licked by her kitten and giggling.
"Who are you?" Merry asked.
"It's not going to hurt you!"
So teach us things worth knowing,
"Harriet," Merry whispered at her sleeping figure.
"Would you like me to give you the keys and erase the others?" He asked. She nodded her head.
"A gift from me to both of you girls," She smiled.
"The stomach of a goat, pregnant female goats are the best for the most powerful and most useful bezoar," She giggled because he was getting so frustrated but was also very proud of her.
"You good?" Merry clutched her stomach while tears filled her eyes.
Merry shrugged her shaking shoulders, "I want to make it a tradition."
"Technically yes, but not truly." Merry nodded.
"I'm glad. I prepared some potions for you," He went into the back while Harry sat in a chair by the fireplace trying to calm herself. He came back with several full vials. She grabbed the 4 she knew she needed to drink right away. She downed all of them and immediately felt them take effect. They filled out her body and made her face have more color. She sighed when she could not feel her ribs and her lips and cheeks were warm again. She lost a lot of weight in the last month but these potions would reverse the last month of not eating. Mr. Feose set the other 2 down by her on the table, they had to be taken with food.
"It was good, he really just wanted to see what I could do," Harriet sighed and threw herself on her fluffy bed.
"Oh I know him," Riley laughed, "He is an excellent teacher, I also went to school with him."
Harriet gasped loudly, how did she do that?! She just saw their entire conversation and felt every emotion. Lucius Malfoy was calm and angry at the same time while Dumbledore was... well it felt cold and nervous. She definitely has to make note that she should never mess with either of them, especially Draco's father because he seemed quite scary. She just thought about how their conversation will go and then she suddenly could see it and feel it. It was kind of like those weird dreams where your body wasn't there but your mind was. Harriet wondered how else she could use this newly found power.
Anyways, sorry for any typos <3

I expect you to get at least average grades and not make your house look like Hopefully, you will learn how Slytherin's properly act quickly by looking up to the older years," His voice was very sharp and direct. Nobody dared to interrupt him.
