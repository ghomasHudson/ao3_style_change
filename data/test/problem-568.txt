Draco turned on the lamp as he sat down on the edge of Harry's bed, curling his toes into his socks and further into the carpet below him as he waited.
, daddy, daddy—" he began wiggling underneath Harry, trying to arch his back and push his ass up further and there was a chuckle, a little dark, that reached his ears and made him whine even louder.
Draco never felt as good as he felt when he was with Harry, and it was after days like today, that Harry just kept proving to him
It kept him floating and sweet and once they were finally done, Harry cleared everything away and made sure that Draco had more water to drink, before gathering him into his arms and making Draco feel so small and protected that everything that happened this morning just completely slipped away, as though it had happened in a whole other month.
"So perfect for daddy, hm?" Harry couldn't help how low his voice came out, and his wrist snapped without even really thinking about it, slapping down hard against Draco's ass, making the blonde yelp and surge forward, nearly face planting the pillows again before he caught himself, palms shoving into the mattress. Harry did it again, twice more, and then once on the other ass cheek and he loved the way that the red was already rising against the skin. "So pretty," he hummed out, leaning forward and kissing the warm skin, Draco making a choked sound, his arms wobbling as they tried to hold him steady, elbows feeling as though they were going to give out.
!" Draco cried out, high pitched and whiny and Harry made a huffing noise under his breath, his head dropped down between Draco's shoulder blades as he began jerking Draco off quickly, easily, the excessive precome making it so easy, and then—"
pretty baby, right?" Harry licked at his collarbone before his teeth were pressing against the bone.
It wasn't much, but it was enough for his breathing to start coming under control, gulping down a few lungful's of air, the first proper mouthfuls that he had gotten since he had left his aunts apartment, her sympathetic gaze and his fathers critical eyes glued to his back as he had walked away from them.
," Draco cringed and shook his head. "I shouldn't—I haven't gone to the gym much this week and I—" he cut off as soon as he realized his mistake and Harry arched an eyebrow.
us to be more?" Harry asked after a moment. Draco blinked as he turned his head to look at Harry, but the brunette wasn't looking at him, he was looking ahead and his eyebrows were furrowed. "Because...I mean, what happened that night between us...What we shared—you said you were scared. What were you scared of?" There was something there that Harry had cut himself off saying and Draco wanted to know but Harry wasn't looking back at him, so he knew that it was his turn to speak again.
There was a double bed to one side of the room, and there were dark curtains, but they weren't black, maybe a navy colour if the main lights were turned on, a painting hanging on the wall that was a mix of black and grey and then bright purple mediums, two sets of drawers, and a desk in the corner of the room with lots of papers and both reading and writing books, with pens and pencils spilling all over the place, probably the most untidy spot in the room, but there was still obviously some order to it, and there was a little weed plant in the corner in a ceramic pot that was painted garish shades of yellow and blue and purple.
, when he felt gentle pressure to his lower lip, which made him automatically part his lips as he hazily opened his eyes and tipped back his head to look at up at his daddy.
"Can you open the drinks for me while I get our food?" Harry said and Draco nodded without a verbal response, happy to just stay quiet and do what would make his daddy happy. Harry went to the door and unlocked it, opening it and speaking quietly with the person on the other side, paying for their food and exchanging pleasantries with whoever was delivering the food and Draco felt his skin buzzing happily at the soft murmur of his daddy's voice. There was no way that he would have been able to hold a conversation right now, even though he was actually desperately hungry—his stomach was beginning to gurgle, he didn't even know if he would have been able to
It was actually working, calming him down, until he remembered that while he had been at his aunts for brunch, and then at his boyfriends sleeping...Harry had been working, and then probably looking for him and worrying when he couldn't find him, and now he was looking after him first, before even showering off the work grime, and Draco could feel the tension all beginning to return to his shoulders.
"You don't have to do this," Draco began to mumble, trying to force his shoulders and tug away from Harry's touch, but Harry just easily followed after him with his sturdy hands and kept massaging him. "I'm—I'm sorry that I—that I didn't come and meet you like—like we planned—" guilt was beginning to clog up his throat and he could feel panic coming back, his body tensing and his eyes blurring over with tears. "You don't have to do this," he repeated, because really, if anyone was looking after anyone here, it should be him looking after Harry, since he was the one who had been working today.
"Yeah, my baby?" Harry was snapping his hips faster again, a bruising pace, and Draco's cock was being rubbed almost painfully into the bed covers, his teeth still painfully—
It was almost half an hour later, when Draco's eyelids were heavy and his mind was completely wrapped up in
," Harry hissed out before he was lunging forward and they were kissing, Harry's hands burning over Draco's body. They felt as though they were never moving, squeezing his hips, groping his ass, pulling his hair, scratching his thighs, and his
"I'm sorry, I just..." Draco trailed off and swallowed hard, fingers tightening around his glass, pressing in through the condensation. "I just—" he cut off again, and then there was movement and Harry was a bit closer on the couch, reaching out to take the smoothie glass from him and rest both of them on the coffee table and then put his hand gently on Draco's lower back.
Harry's fingers pulled out of him and Draco whined, forcing his eyes open again, and he saw Harry picking up the lube again—the lube that Draco hadn't even realized that Harry had grabbed—and poured it over his fingers, and then the tips of his fingers were pressing back at Draco's hole, gentle but persistent, and it was more than two, and his toes curled as he realized that Harry was beginning to work
pretty, Draco," Harry ground out as he pulled back, his own cheeks flushed, eyes glinting, the low light of the lamp making them glow as he stared down at Draco as though he was the most gorgeous person on the planet. "Please, don't
"And you promise you're going to be here in the morning when I wake up? You're not going to run away again?" Harry wasn't smiling, even though his tone was calm, and his eyes were serious.
"Are you hungry?" Harry asked as he pulled on a shirt and then moved to stand in front of Draco. Draco shook his head and then paused as he felt a rumble in his stomach. Harry just smiled. "Alright, how about I order us something to eat—we will get an early dinner, and while we wait, you kneel for me?"
He hated that he got so anxious and panicky and it was as though he could feel the walls closing in on him, flashing back to when he was just a kid and he had nowhere to escape to and no way to get away from his father other than when he was due back at boarding school, no support other than from Pansy Parkinson and the empathetic looks from his silent mother—
There was no rush when it came to eating, and Harry made that very clear given the way he kept feeding Draco over feeding himself, reaching over to wipe Draco's chin whenever he spilt any sauce or food, and he kept whispering in Draco's ear and brushing his tattooed fingers through blonde hair.
When Harry started moving, slowly thrusting inside Draco, not pulling out fully, but grinding his hips in rotating circles when he was pushed all the way back in, Draco's noises turned to whines, and his thighs clenched on either side of Harry's torso, trying to arch off the mattress, fingers scrabbling at Harry's back, probably leaving possessive, red marks but that wasn't something he was thinking about right now.
"No," Harry responded with a smirk over his shoulder as they reached the shop and Harry reached past him to open the door, holding it open for the blonde to pass by him, something that felt natural now.
He stepped forward, holding out his hand toward Draco, and Draco's eyes widened slightly before taking Harry's hand, letting the other man help him to his feet.
It was something else, giving over control to someone that he trusted completely, and he'd only properly experienced it one other time, and that had been with Harry as well.
Smoking helped, it was why he had started smoking in the first place and why he still picked up the habit when he was particularly stressed, because it forced him to breathe deep, hold, and then exhale slowly, even though he wasn't really thinking about it.
"Yes, daddy," Draco's voice was breathy now, and not just from the position that he was propped up in that made it slightly harder to breathe, practically folded in two.
"Same as last time, okay, baby?" Harry murmured, nosing just under his ear. "You tell me if there's anything you don't like?" Draco stuttered out an affirmative sound. "We're going to need a safe word later on, but you don't need to think about that right now." Draco's eyes nearly rolled back into his head at the idea of
"Daddy," he corrected himself, his own voice quiet, waiting for Harry's acknowledgment, and when Harry's smile spread back across his face, eyes sparkling from the light in the lamp, and his whole body just relaxed back into the duvet cover and pillows underneath him. He realized that the tension that had tightened in his shoulders wasn't anything like what was usually there, it wasn't the panicked anxiety that he got so often when he was at work, or at a big event with his parents, or just facing off against his father across the dinner table that he used to have to sit at growing up. It hadn't been completely overwhelming, just a slight jolt, and Harry's smile and the clear happiness and arousal on his face instantly soothed it away. "Daddy," he repeated again softly, more to himself, but when he focused his eyes back on Harry, crouched between his legs, he felt even softer, fuzzier, floatier, because
, but he was babbling and he couldn't stop and he felt as though he was going to ascend to some higher plane as Harry cooed and pressed a wet kiss to the tip of his cock. Calling Harry '
"Did you wear these wanting some boy to see you in them, baby?" Harry asked, voice dark and low, and it made Draco shiver. "You wear these for the boy that kissed you?"
"Hey," he said with an awkward smile, his cheeks red, his blonde hair adorably fluffy from sleep, and his body swamped in one of Harry's sweatshirts.
There was this donut shop just around the corner from Harry's apartment that was open twenty-four hours, and they made the most amazing donuts—it had become a bit of a habit of theirs to go there when they were high and Harry laughed when he noticed Draco's longing expression and started pulling on Draco's arm.
He could hear music playing inside—not obnoxiously loud so that the neighbours would be bothered, but just loud enough that Draco could hear because he was paying attention, so it was probably a little loud inside the apartment and maybe Harry Potter was dancing around a bit and—
"Dray baby!" Came a shout and Draco could already hear the slight slur in her voice, which explained why his best friend was late, as he smiled and turned to the side to see Pansy approaching, with Hermione and Ron behind her. "I'm so sorry I was late! You'll never believe who I ran into!" She exclaimed as she reached them, looking at Harry briefly, scrunching her nose and giving him a quick once over. "Looking completely under dressed as usual, Potter," she said in a fond voice.
!" He cried out, tears leaking from the corners of his eyes and dripping down his cheeks, joining the mess of spit smeared across his chin and jawline.
Harry didn't try and take off his panties, he left them on, but Draco felt them being pulled to the side and fingers slipping underneath them, brushing between his cheeks, and heat was just curling so tightly around his stomach that it felt as though he was only seconds away from an orgasm, like an inexperienced teenager.
"Draco?" Harry's voice was a little confused, but it was still kind and even and that made Draco's eyes sting. "Are you okay?"
Even now, he didn't shuffle Draco out from under the spray entirely, so he had to rotate to wash himself properly, but he made no sound of complaint, and he kept leaning in to kiss Draco's cheeks lightly in a way that had him blushing so hard he could feel the heat spreading down to his chest.
," Draco's voice shook slightly. "Well, yes—I just—" he broke off, breathing out and dropping his eyes before groaning and pulling one of his hands away from Harry's so that he could rub his fist at his teary eye. "
"He was still watching you when we walked away," Harry said and Draco's brain tried to grasp at the words, trying to remember who 'he' was because the only people who were important right now were him and Harry. "And I saw him watching you later, when you were dancing with Pansy, looking so fucking pretty I just wanted to come into the middle of the dance floor and fuck you right there."
Harry only had one ring on tonight, the silver one on his pinky with a greenish-blue stone, which was a change from the usual, since he always seemed to have enough silver on his hands to weigh down a small horse.
He felt as Harry was about to come, he knew the changes in his breathing and the way his thighs tensed up, and then Harry tightened the hand at the back of Draco's head, keeping him in place as he began to come, groaning as he pumped into Draco's mouth and his baby swallowed as much as he could, tears beginning to stream down his face as he choked slightly, feeling spit and come leaking out from the corners of his mouth.
And as soon as he thought that, he was reminded of why he was here, and what had happened the last time he and Harry had been alone together, and his heart started thundering and his bottom lip quivered and he had to put down the smoothie glass, his hand feeling a little a shaky as he dropped it back to his lap, twisting the gold family heirloom ring around his middle finger.
—were nipping at his ear, and that possessive term again made all the feeling in Draco's legs and arms officially disappear, going weightless.
Twice he'd shyly asked for Harry to take photos of the bruises that had been pressed into his skin, and there had been some other times when Harry had caught him looking at marks left behind in glimpses in the mirror.
"Here you go," Harry murmured as he pushed one of the smoothie glasses across the bench toward Draco, and then started putting things away and cleaning up before he touched his own glass.
Draco let out a shaky breath as he stepped into the apartment, eyes flicking from side to side as Harry closed the door behind him and then lead the way across the open lounge, over to the kitchen.
"What can I get you?" The bartender finally reached Draco, and he opened his mouth to place his order when a hand was suddenly falling on his hip.
toward subspace, knowing that his daddy had him, that even though it felt so good, and he could feel him losing himself in grunts and sighs, his cock so deep inside Draco's ass that he could feel it in his throat, but that unlike Draco, he kept his head, looking after Draco, looking after his baby. "You can hold it until daddy's done, right?" Draco's bleary eyes attempted to widen, but he struggled just to open his sticky eyelids. "You can be a good boy for daddy, right?" He whispered directly in Draco's ear before pulling his fingers out of Draco's mouth so he could brace both hands on the mattress and begin driving into Draco.
Draco felt tears flood to his eyes, and he sniffed in a way that was incredibly unattractive, but Harry didn't pull back.
"What's your colour, love?" He asked, cupping Draco's face with damp fingers, neither of them caring about the spit that was amusing across Draco's cheek.
"You can give my number to your Aunt Bella, that sounds great," Harry continued and he sort of hustled Draco up against the bathroom cabinet with his ass resting on the counter, as he began to dry himself. "Pansy told me that your dad came over and started yelling about the Christmas event that you invited me to," Harry continued, getting back to what he was saying before, and Draco's toes curled a little but he didn't feel anywhere near as anxious as he expected. "She didn't get any other details from your aunt, but I can guess the general core of it," Harry sighed as he slung the towel around his neck and leaned in close, damp locks of hair hanging down over his forehead as he touched his to Draco's. "I want whatever you want here. I'll do whatever you need, okay? And I'm not going to be upset either way." Another tear fell, clumping together a few delicate eyelashes. "If you just want to smooth things over and just do what they want to make it as easy as possible, then I can be with you while you get ready, and then be there when you're done with the event. If you want me to come with you, even if you know it might stir up some trouble, I will be right there with you." Draco took in a shaky breath, unsure how to respond even though Harry was saying all the right words—
The tears stopped falling slowly and he took in a shaky breath, lifting his chin slowly so that he could peek at Harry through his fringe, and Harry's eyes were already on him, soft and non-confrontational, and one of his hands left Draco's, reaching up to brush his hair back from his forehead, fingertips calming and Draco could feel the tension beginning to bleed out of his shoulders.
and it was instantly making him feel better, like he could just tell Harry everything and he would tell him that it was all okay, and that the weight would be lifted off his shoulders.
Harry nuzzled at his stomach, pushing up the hem of the borrowed shirt and exposing his pale stomach, dipping his tongue into his belly button and making Draco huff out a giggle before mouthing at the bone of his hip.
"Teddy," Harry grinned as he realized where Draco was staring at the pot plant. "He's going through a painting phase at the moment, and it's not like I'm growing any flowers in here." Teddy Lupin was the Harry's godson, almost four years old, and Draco didn't even want to
," Harry carried on quickly, his eyes closed and his fingers tightening in Draco's hair as though he was scared that Draco was going to pull away. "It's just you always seemed really—shy? Or sometimes just
"Open up for me, love," Harry said quietly as he touched the top of the water bottle to Draco's lower lip, and Draco opened his mouth automatically, his eyes still closed with his head pressed into Harry's hand as Harry tipped the water bottle up and poured some into Draco's mouth. "That a bit better?"
"Can we get two Heineken, a Cosmo and a pineapple juice?" Harry Potter requested and Draco's body relaxed.
, I was so pissed. I was going to camp out in your apartment all day until you came back," he broke off, to nose at Draco's cheek before his lips were skimming Draco's jaw and Draco shivered, one of his hands gripping at Harry's shoulder. "But I thought that maybe it was just a one off thing for you—" he sucked at the skin underneath Draco's ear and Draco's back arched, his breathing stuttering. "And I didn't want to crowd you, so I left." Draco really wished he hadn't left. He wished that by the time Pansy had convinced him to go back to his apartment, Harry was still naked and tangled in his sheets like he had been when Draco had snuck out like a coward. "But I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad, baby," Harry's head pulled back so he could look Draco in the eye and they were both breathing hard, their lips red and their iris' blown and Harry shook his head minutely. "My room. Bed."
"Stop," Harry's voice was stern but not sharp, but it still made Draco's shoulders jerk, the change in tone making goosebumps break out across his skin. "Stop doubting yourself, okay? Wherever your head is going right now, let it go. There's no problems, there's no issues, there's nothing wrong. You're here with me, and I've got you, okay?"
"G-green, daddy," Draco managed with a hoarse voice and Harry smiled and kissed his cheek before pressing his fingers back in, smoothly filling Draco's mouth right until his knuckles were pressing up against his teeth, and he could see ink lines of the lilies and crabs tattooed over his daddy's hand when he looked down his nose.
His limbs felt like noodles, but Harry had him, completely taking his weight, easily shifting him into the position he wanted, and the way that he
!" Draco cried out, his eyes snapping open again, reacting to the pain, although Harry didn't miss the way Draco's cock twitched at the bite.
clothes, and he already felt overwhelmed with emotions, tears spilling out the corners of his eyes. "
—and yet he still didn't know how to reply. "And you don't need to answer right now," Harry's big hand squeezed at Draco's hip. "You don't need to answer until right up until the day it's happening, and even then, you can change your mind."
Conversation had to be shouted, but that was okay because they weren't really there to talk all that much.
"Yes, daddy," he murmured and he felt the way Harry's fingers tightened at his first use of the word for the evening.
"That's right, baby," Harry's messy brown hair was tickling Draco's neck and his ear as he nuzzled his face into the curve of Draco's neck. "Mine."
because Harry was still up on two knees between his thighs as he took the condom out of the wrapper.
, and Draco loved the way the weight of the world just seemed to slip off his shoulders as the familiar scents of incense, Harry's cologne and faint weed surrounded him, and he fumbled with the buttons of his jacket as he let out a deep breath he hadn't realized he had been holding.
, and he nodded silently. "So perfect, baby," Harry murmured, and suddenly Draco felt warm breath over his cheeks before he nuzzled his nose against Draco's, and Draco's eyelids tried to open, tried to lift so he could see how close Harry was to his face, but then Harry was pressing gentle, chaste kisses against Draco's mouth, his chin, his jaw, and his head just felt s
"You going to come?" Harry asked softly, eyes watching Draco carefully, affectionately. "Going to come for daddy?"
"Come for me, sweet baby," Harry whispered and Draco's mind went blank as he finally came, streaking the covers beneath them and undoubtedly making a mess all over Harry's hand.
him, collapsing over him, mouth crushing down against his, nose smushed against his, and Draco cried out at the pressure almost directly against his cock, only kept apart now by the flimsy, silky material of his panties.
He let out a squeak and then a long sigh as a third finger was pressed inside, his body not offering much resistance as Harry's fingers sunk inside.
in regards to being nervous about his weight or appearance, Harry made a point to assure him that he adored Draco's body just the way it was, and how
He fell asleep feeling warm, his ruined panties gone, the blankets around him and his daddy's body warm and soft behind him.
Draco followed after him, trailing after him like a puppy on a lead with wide eyes and slumped shoulders, already feeling himself let go even more than he had before, everything in his mind falling away and just focusing on Harry, zeroing in on how he was going to be
have a chance, and he'd blown it, and then he just decided to show up a month later and expected Harry to comfort him and let him call him daddy and take care of him?
Draco managed to struggle out of his skinny jeans, leaving him only in pale yellow panties with a tiny bow at the back, sliding between the sheets of Harry's bed and tugging the pillows closer around him, smothering him in their combined scents and comfort immediately calming him down, even though his tears were still steadily spilling down his cheeks and now wetting the pillow beneath him.
"Are...Are these some of Luna's?" Draco asked haltingly as he ran his finger along the seam of one of the black pillows with neon green writing stating, '
"Yes, please, daddy," Draco whispered, and Harry smiled, giving him a nod before leading him out of the room.
Harry just smiled as he sat down right next to Draco, so that their thighs were pressed firmly together, reaching out with one hand to absently stroking his fingers through Draco's hair, and it made Draco close his eyes as Harry's other hand was reaching out for one of the water bottles.
Harry lit the end of Draco's joint first, then his own, and then pulled a water bottle out of his hoodie pocket that it had been half shoved in, resting it between them, before they sat in quiet to smoke.
"I d-didn't—" Draco wasn't even sure he was hearing everything properly. Every word coming from Harry was making him feel as though he was ascending further and further into the clouds. "I didn't know t-that...You felt the same way."
Harry was looking up at him from where he was crouched by his feet, and there were wrinkles at the corners of his eyes from the way he was smiling up at Draco and Draco chewed down on his bottom lip, feeling a little flustered at Harry's expression.
of Draco's slim fingers inside himself, and he shuddered, eyes rolling back as Harry began to move, sliding the fingers back and forth, in and out, twisting and scissoring them.
There were more tears, beginning to spill out the corners of Draco's eyes, and Harry pressed a soft kiss to Draco's inner thigh before his fingers pressed inside Draco's tight heat, not pausing, just slowly working them inside and stretching Draco as he went, and Draco's chest fluttered and clenched.
, the first time that Harry stretched him open with his cock always received a full body response—a guttural moan and tremors running under his skin, his fingers grabbing at the covers and trying to steady himself.
!" Draco gasped out, body jolting forward, thighs beginning to shake and knees feeling as though they were going to skid out from underneath him and have his body collapse completely.
, because he knew what that meant and it was exactly what he wanted, but it wasn't something he had ever trusted someone with before. He would with Harry.
"Go to the bedroom, hm?" Harry prompted him with a pat on his ass before the brunette was walking toward the kitchen with the bag of donuts in hand. Draco watched him go, eyes flicking between looking at Harry's
It felt as though the only parts of him that he could focus on were where his body was connected with Harry's, and his neglected cock, and even then, his head felt as though it had been wrapped in cotton wool that was slowly enveloping him body.
"H-Harry?" Draco's voice sounded dry and he instantly heard Harry's breathing change and his grip tighten around his hip.
"He was," Harry responded instantly, hands still moving, groping at Draco's sides, squeezing the back of his neck and making Draco's cock jerk upward and begin to leak. "He couldn't take his eyes off you," Harry's hands both trailed down to Draco's hips, gripping him there firmly for a moment before his thumbs were gripping at his ass. "I don't blame him," he continued quietly, tanned fingers pressing into the pale skin as he pulled Draco's cheeks apart so that he had an unobstructed view of the pink gem at the end of the plug and the slightly shiny skin around it. "The only times I
Pansy had had a crush on the girl who had been on the opposing girls soccer team all through their high school, years, but the other girl was practically the opposite of Pansy, quiet, gentle,
," Draco whined out, and the way that Harry was so easily manhandling him, Draco's body almost completely fallen to the bed now, his thighs so weak from the way that Harry was fucking him that they had slid out from underneath him. His elbows completely slid out from underneath him and he turned his face before he completely face-planted the covers, his cock getting trapped between his body and the bed covers. "D-
It was strange the way as soon as he opened the front door and greedily sucked in a breath of air from inside Harry Potter's apartment that he immediately felt himself calm down, just a little.
"I...I want you..." Draco licked his lips quickly, eyelashes flickering under the mascara applied, and he wondered if Harry was looking at the glitter applied at the corners of his eyelids, given how close they were. It wasn't a lot, but he'd felt like looking pretty going out tonight, and he was
"That's it, sweetheart," Harry whispered, and Draco could hear the tension in his voice, even if Harry sounded faraway, and he could feel the way his movements were getting slightly more erratic, losing the pace as he got close to his orgasm, and then he was pressing kisses to Draco's cheeks and foreheads. "You're safe, baby, let go," his daddy continued, and his voice was
"It's nearly four o'clock," Harry said with a smile as he went to his drawers, taking out two sets of sweatpants and pulling his pair on first, not bothering with briefs, and then kneeling again in front of Draco and holding open the sweatpants, as though helping him dress was second nature, something that they did commonly and not just when Harry was helping him when he was cold or too fucked out to manage to coordinate his limbs. "I got home a while ago, but you were clearly tired, I wanted you to sleep, baby."
There was steam starting to gather in the small room, because Harry didn't have great ventilation like Draco's place did, and the shower was
," Draco tried to shake his head, tried to open his eyes, tried to look at Harry, but everything was
"Good," Harry sounded pleased as he scratched Draco's scalp gently before putting down the water bottle.
. He didn't sound mad, and Draco opened his eyes that he hadn't realized he had closed. "It's okay. Whatever you're feeling, it's okay. Just take a breath, and talk when you're ready, yeah?" Draco blinked at him because there was something in his voice and his eyes that managed to make his mind slow down again. "Did you want something to smoke?" Harry asked suddenly.
"Yes," Draco sounded almost breathless as he rolled over on the bed and struggled to push himself up on his elbows and knees despite how shaky he felt. "I did!" He tried to get one hand underneath him to struggle with the buttons of his tight jeans, but he was barely able to hold himself up as it was, and he almost lurched forward and face planted the pillows and covers.
"So," Harry said, and his voice wasn't heavy, and Draco didn't feel trapped even though he knew what was coming. "Are you okay, Draco?" He didn't like that so much, he preferred when Harry had been calling him baby, or sweetheart, but he knew Harry had just been calming him down before. He knew that wasn't something he just...Had a right to. "What's going on?"
—" Draco's words were slurred and muffled and he could see the proud smile on Harry's face as he sent Draco closer to the edge.
Draco's clutched Harry tightly as he came, harder than he had in a long time, and that was saying something given the way Harry had made him come just a few weeks ago when they had fooled around for the first time.
"Sure thing," the bartender moved away to get their order and Draco turned his head toward Harry, completely ignoring the man who had been there before.
They promptly flew back open when Harry tapped a finger against the plug and he jolted forward at the way the plug shifted inside him, letting out a low moan as Harry's hands slid up his back, over his skin, the contrast between Harry's roughened palms over his smooth skin always made him shake and his eyes roll back and he could feel his mind going fuzzy and clear in the best way.
were—Draco's were filled with coconut water, avocado, pine nuts, protein powder, spinach, almond milk, and sometimes there were dried cranberries when he was feeling extra generous toward himself, whereas Harry had a bag of mixed berries, honey, ice cream, full cream milk, yoghurt and some M&M's on the bench next to the smoothie maker.
"Can I—" Draco swallowed hard, looking to the side and rubbing a hand over the arm of his silk blouse, noticing the music was a lot quieter now. "Can I come in?" He asked softly.
"Hey, sweet baby," Harry's voice gently broke through the haze in Draco's head as Harry whispered in his ear, nibbling softly on the shell of his ear. "How about you get on your knees for me now, yeah? Let me use your mouth properly?" And Draco wanted to nod his head enthusiastically a hundred times
"That's good," Harry whispered and he leaned forward and gave him a kiss on the forehead. "I'm going to have a quick shower. Did you want to have one with me, or you want to stay in bed?"
"I've got you, Dray," Harry said, and his tone had changed momentarily, lighter for a few beats as they pulled back and Draco was tempted to turn over and pull at his skin tight pants, but Harry took over. He pressed a hand into his lower back, quietly easing him back to facing forward, before his fingers were hooking under the tight denim and working them slowly down Draco's hips, taking his socks off with the jeans, leaving him in just his panties. There was a hitch as Harry's breath caught in this throat, because no matter how many times he had seen the wide variety of panties his lover owned, they would always catch him off guard. "Fuck, sweetheart," Harry's voice got rougher as Draco shifted his knees a little to help with his jeans, and while he would usually appreciated the lace panties some more, something else was calling to Harry this time. He began tugging his panties down, over Draco's round, pale ass, and...There it was.
Draco didn't even feel it as the new tear welled, it was only when it escaped from the corner of his eye and fell that he realized it was there.
Harry didn't give him any warning before he was pulling out the plug, disposing of it somewhere, and Draco let out a squeak, pushing up on his hands weakly so that he could properly present to Harry, knees a little further apart this time, although he still hadn't felt a dip in the mattress to indicate that his lover had climbed up behind him and he couldn't help but wiggle his ass a little, trying to entice him closer.
Draco jolted as he remembered who Harry was talking about, and the possessive tone in Harry's voice was still right there, present at the surface.
Sometimes, even though he was with Harry, he still didn't totally feel himself relax until they were safely tucked away from the world.
again, and this time, his elbows gave out and his lower body stumbled forward, lower to the bed, propping himself only on them, his ass further in the air. "Hm, baby? Could you feel it then?" There was a possessive tone in Harry's voice and Draco
He kept himself in shape and he had good stamina, and Draco was lucky enough to reap the benefits of that.
the warm come beginning to trickle out before Harry shoved himself back inside with a wet squelch "Up on your knees, my baby," Harry whispered, pulling him back by his hips, Draco completely powerless to stop him, even if he wanted to.
He was still wearing the tight leather pants that Pansy Parkinson had chosen out for him that night, but wearing the sleeping shirt and jersey made him feel instantly more comfortable, especially...Especially since it smelt like the cologne that Harry wore and faintly like the apple shampoo that he used and just a bit like weed.
, he would with Harry. "How far do you wanna go tonight?" His fingers were playing with the hem of the jersey, pushing it up around Draco's waist, because Draco could feel the warmth from his fingers even closer to his skin, only separated by the thin material of the shirt he was wearing, rather than through the knitted material now. "We'll do as much or as little as you want, whatever you want, love," Harry pulled back, hands moving to rest back on his hips which...Draco appreciated because he knew that Harry had asked him an important question and he
He didn't even know how Lucius had known that he was going to be at Bellatrix LeStrange's, from his aunts surprised expression when the housekeeper had come in to announce him just moments before he had strode into the room, to her horrified, tight-lipped expression when he begun speaking, Draco knew that she wouldn't have intentionally had told him that Draco was going to be there.
," Draco nodded his head rapidly, and he could feel drool beginning to gather in the corners of his lips, mouth open and eyes lolled back.
"So good, baby," Harry cooed, his voice a little shaky, and Draco blinked up at him through bleary eyes. "You did so good for me." Draco couldn't talk, even as Harry slid his cock out of his mouth with a slight hiss of sensitivity as Draco kept suckling at the head, and Harry pressed his baby's mouth shut with his finger. "Swallow, baby," he murmured and Draco did as he was told with big eyes trained on Harry. "Good boy," he murmured and Draco couldn't help his whimper, especially as Harry's expression shifted slightly and he moved his foot, lifting it and pressing his foot against Draco's groin, over where he was hard and leaking in his borrowed sweatpants and Draco let out a squeak as his body instinctively tried to curl forward. "You want to get off, baby?" Harry asked sweetly as he stroked Draco's hair, and Draco managed a shaky nod. "That's right, love, you've been so good for me," he applied more pressure against Draco's groin and Draco whined as he blinked up at Harry with watery eyes. "Go on, baby, get off against daddy's foot," Harry murmured and Draco's body
If it wasn't for the simultaneous sensations that were flooding over him, it would definitely have been Harry whispering '
He stumbled into Harry's bedroom, and it smelt strongly like Harry, as usual, but it made Draco's aching chest feel slightly warmed by the fact that his Chanel perfume also tinged the air, and there was a pair of his socks on top of the cluttered desk, one of his shirts, a book that he was reading on and off and had just decided to leave at Harry's for when he was there.
"Sit on my lap, baby," Harry whispered, and Draco stumbled forward the half step so that he could lift one of his knees and rest it on the bed beside Harry's hip, and Harry's hands gripped his hips firmly, holding him carefully, taking his weight and lifting him up until he was straddling Harry's lap and then sitting down and—
Letting them take him apart so often, and believing that they would put back the pieces, even when it was times like this, something rather rushed and into the early hours of the morning.
!" Draco wailed out, feeling his balls pull up painfully as his toes curled, trying to stop himself from coming, even though it felt his cock hadn't been touched in
The smoothie machine was loud, and Draco flinched when it started even though he had been expecting it, but once he was done, Harry still softly apologized, even though it wasn't
"Someone...Kissed me tonight—just before I came here," Draco blurted out, and Harry stilled for a moment, before his thumb started rubbing against the back of Draco's hand again and his fingertips on Draco's cheeks softly brushed his jaw.
"Baby…" there were soft fingers stroking through Draco's hair and he was completely disorientated in the best way as he woke up slowly, a smile already pulling up his lips at the familiar voice. But as he turned over, there were wrinkles of concern on Harry's face as he stretched over him, and Draco suddenly remembered that he wasn't really supposed to be here. Not like Harry had ever said he couldn't be in his
!" He gasped as Harry's fingers pressed down firmly over where Draco's cock was hard and pressing against his zipper, which was prominent and straining again the confines of his pants.
"I can feel you clenching around me, baby," Harry was whispering, and it just made Draco clench harder, his cock blatantly leaking onto the covers below them. "You feeling worked up? Was it the plug inside you that's been making you all needy?" Draco let out a whimper, it passed through his lips without even really thinking, and he absently heard a huff of laughter behind him. "Or was it the man in the suit at the club who couldn't keep his eyes off you?"
"I wanna—" Draco almost got the words out, but Harry spread his fingers apart over Draco's tongue, forcing his mouth open wider and spit to spread down his chin. "Da-
"No," Draco shook his head, not even really thinking about the fact that he kind of had, but it wasn't Harry's fault. Technically he was meant to be meeting Pansy, he'd said he would look out for her, and Harry had just said that he would see him there since he was going to be arriving with Hermione and Ron, who would usually come a bit later. "Not too long."
Draco's body stiffened, pissed off although not entirely surprised that the guy had decided to actually move in and touch him, and was prickling up to tell him that there was no way in hell he would go home with a man like him, when a deeper voice spoke.
He just felt overwhelmed in the best way, his cheeks hot and tears behind his eyelids and his fingers were curling and unfurling into the duvet cover underneath him, and he let out a gasp as the third finger was slipped inside, the pinch making his spine twinge slightly, but then Harry leaned forward and his mouth was enveloping the head of Draco's cock.
"Yeah...Uh—I've kinda—I've already had some shots," Draco face dropped slightly, but he found that when Harry was looking at him in the way he was, and the fact he was still holding his face and his hand and hadn't pulled back even though Draco had admitted that he had been kissed just before he had come over. "Um, I don't think I want anything more to drink, but yeah, let's have something to smoke."
For a long time, it had just been Draco and Pansy, stuck together in a rich, cold world by themselves, and they both counted themselves lucky to find Harry, Hermione, Ron and their friends, and sometimes he still couldn't believe that they'd gotten so lucky.
," Draco breathed out as he felt the knuckles of Harry's fingers press against his ass, indicating that he had buried three fingers inside his ass, but suddenly, they weren't twisting anymore, and then Harry was leaning forward and biting down
"I told you the next time we were doing this, it was going to be with the light on," Harry words were quiet as he moved to sit on the bed so that he could look up at Draco and purposefully take in a deep breath. Draco stared down at him with wide eyes, his heart thundering in his chest, and seeing Harry take in a few breaths and close his eyes for a moment, as though he needed to calm himself down, it made him feel better. It made everything
," he whimpered, hips still try to buck upwards as Harry's fingers spread open inside him and his tongue worked over the head of his cock, wet and a little sloppy.
"You can hold it, baby," Harry whispered, and it was the way he still sounded so steady despite Draco's clearly needy state. It sent Draco bustling
"We're meeting tomorrow with Ginny and Luna, right?" Pansy mentioned to Hermione on one of her trips back to the table to pick up another drink and Hermione nodded and pushed back her brunette curls to talk to Pansy, and Draco watched them for a moment, even though he couldn't quite hear what they were talking about.
Draco's body shuddered at the contact, the first time his cock had been touched by someone else in a week, since he and Harry had both been busy, and his teeth sunk down hard into his bottom lip as he turned his head to the side, cheek pressing into the duvet cover.
, but his body wasn't quite responding the way it usually did, and he only managed to dip his head once, Harry drawing his fingers out with a smirk at the lewd sound they made. Draco's face was burning because he knew he was a mess, spit smeared down his chin and he looked down, at the pillow that Harry's foot reached out and moved slightly so it was in a better position. "Go on, baby," Harry gave Draco a nudge, and that was all it took for him to slide down moving to kneel between Harry's legs and rest his hands against his thighs. "Good boy," Harry smiled at him, almost indulgently, reaching out and stroking his hair as he took himself out of his sweatpants with the other hand. He guided Draco's face forward, his mouth falling open instinctively and a moment later, Harry was pressing his cock between Draco's lips, firmly and smoothly, until it hit the back of his throat. "There we go," his voice was slightly strained but still very much in control. "Does that feel good, baby?" His voice was just a little bit mean, because he knew that Draco liked that, but god, also so,
"Alright, pretty baby," Harry's voice got a little rougher, and Draco felt a shiver go through him, because he really,
," Draco managed to say, even though his mouth was literally watering and he just wanted to bite Harry's neck and suck or maybe put his mouth to better use somewhere else.
Over the past few months, getting to know each other and letting himself open up a lot more, and actually
"You're doing so good for me, baby, you're such a good boy," Harry whispered, his voice husky as he pulled off Draco's cock, Draco clenching and whining at the words of praise. "Do you think you're ready for me now?"
"I've been thinking about you all week, baby. Been missing you," Harry murmured before slick fingers were suddenly pressed at his hole, prodding gently to test how stretched he was before pressing inside together, and Draco couldn't stop his guttural moan. "Sound so, so pretty, baby…" Harry rubbed one hand up and down Draco's spine in a soothing motion as his fingers began to move faster inside Draco, steadily pushing inside him. "And you open for me so easily."
, that he let his eyes fall shut again. "Such a pretty baby..." Harry was pressing the words into Draco's neck, tugging the jersey down so that the hollow of his throat and his collarbones were exposed and then he was sucking at the bared skin, sucking marks against the pale skin and Draco couldn't help the way he was wiggling and bucking underneath Harry. "
His mind started to fuzz over a little in the corners, the way he loved it happening but had rarely ever allowed before Harry, and he just let it happen, knowing that Harry would take care of him.
Draco nodded and tried not to think about how unfair it was that Harry had such a close relationship with his ex-girlfriend, even though Ginny Weasley was great and treated his cousin like a goddess on earth.
"Yeah...Thanks," he mumbled and Harry nodded, tugging Draco's hand to the side, to a door that was generally partially shut when Draco had been there and he'd never actually looked inside, and then he let go of Draco's hand and pushed open the door, flipping on the light.
He knew that his daddy came, he absently felt it and he could still feel his daddy kissing him and it was sweet and calming, and the fog in his mind made him feel as though he was floating, and the way that daddy was speaking to him—even though he didn't quite understand the words, he couldn't quite hear exactly what daddy was saying—but it was nice, it was all so nice.
It didn't take long, with how fuzzy Draco's head was, and how hard he had been for so long, and Harry pressed his toes against Draco's cock and rotated his foot slightly and Draco whimpered and shuddered and Harry patted his hair.
"What are you doing here, Dray?" Harry asked softly and Draco's whole body tensed up, and he instantly felt pressure behind his eyes, staring resolutely down at the pink concoction in his smoothie glass so that Harry wouldn't see that his eyes were already starting to blur a little from tears as he felt the sting of rejection that he knew was going to come.
"Yeah?" It sounded as though there was a tint of amusement to Harry's voice, but Draco knew that it would have been in the best possible way, and so Draco didn't open his eyes, he just enjoyed the fuzzy mindset that was slowly washing over him. "You're going to let me take care of you?" Draco knew he must have been smiling
Draco didn't really follow what he was doing, letting his eyes drift closed and his mind begin to float as Harry turned something on the TV, turning the volume down low and flipping open his sketching pad and then going quiet.
"I should probably give her your number," Draco croaked out, his first time speaking in a while and his words coming out softly in the small, steamy room. "You know...In case…" he drifted off, because he didn't like thinking about the idea of having another situation like this, where he was on the verge of a panic attack and pretty much ran like a child from his problems, and his family and friends were left cleaning up after him like a toddler.
His whole body just melted into Harry's side, and Harry moved him so easily, as though he weighed nothing, onto his lap with his hand pressed against Draco's head, so that he laid it down against Harry's shoulder.
"Uh-uh, baby, we've talked about this," Harry's voice sounded closer, hovering over him. "Daddy wants to hear all of your pretty sounds." They had, Harry had told him almost every time they had slept together, although it was hard to break automatic habits that had been enforced a
"Hi," Draco said for a third time, and Harry's smile just got wider before he gave Draco's hip a squeeze and let his arm fall to take his wallet out of his back pocket. "Oh, no, I've got it—"
," he whistled through his teeth as he spread open the front of Draco's jeans, not asking Draco yet to lift his hips and ass so that he could properly take off the jeans just yet, appreciating the tiny scrap of blush-pink silk that he could see through the teeth of the zipper. "These are gorgeous."
Harry's face was proud as he stared down at Draco, still cupping Draco's face as he finished in his mouth before brushing his thumbs over the apples of Draco's cheeks before swiping down through the mess that was dripping down his chin.
It was only when he felt Harry's thumb pressing into the side of his neck gently and shift behind him that Draco swayed slightly, feeling the slight ache in his thighs, and then there was warm breath on his shoulder before there were lips against his ear.
just kept on moving, rolling up, against Draco's body, in this fluid way that Draco had practically drooled over
Draco couldn't help the smile on his face, a little bit dopey as he let Harry shift him around, gently move him under the spray of the water to rinse off any last soapy suds before he turned off the shower and reached out for a towel.
at Harry a lot more rather than just darting quick looks over at him, he realized that got a special smile from Harry.
"You've done so well for me, Draco...The food is almost here, baby," Harry murmured, the words all settling over Draco nicely. "You want to sit on the couch or the floor as you eat?" Draco made a humming noise as he considered, not quite ready to open his eyes just yet, but he could feel that his knees and thighs were beginning to ache slightly, and he wasn't sure what Harry would have planned for later, so he didn't want to be too sore. "Up on the couch?" Harry asked and Draco nodded and Harry kissed his jaw before leaning back and then getting up off the couch before moving to stand in front of Draco. "Let me help you, baby," he said and Draco opened his eyes slowly, to Harry holding out his hands.
Every second that went by, felt like a full minute, and his skin was prickling in anticipation, before suddenly, Harry's hand reached out and smoothed over his ass again, touching the heated skin that made Draco let out a hiss before his eyelids drooped closed.
"Let it go, baby," Harry whispered and Draco's eyes drifted closed without a second thought. "Just let daddy look after you, yeah? I've got you."
"Yeah, I—" Draco cut off, swallowing down and hoping that his words weren't going to ruin the happy buzz that they were sharing. "You're my daddy, right?" He asked quietly and Harry was silent for a moment before he was pulling away, and Draco's stomach dropped for a second and his entire body clenched until Harry was leaning over him, getting in close so that their noses were touching and Draco could make out his glittering eyes in the pale light that was coming through the thin curtains.
"Aw, baby," Harry's movements didn't stop, his hips snapping forward even as he somehow managed to adjust himself over Draco's body, with one knee pressed deep into the bed beside Draco's hip to give himself better leverage. "You already sound so pretty for me…" his voice rasped, his voice already sounding so much deeper than it had just a few moments ago. "You already sound so needy, baby."
There had never been someone that Draco trusted to look after him like this, so carefully and thoroughly, and someone that he was so unabashed with, because he could feel dazedly feel Harry wiping him down between his legs, spreading apart his cheeks in a very different way from before that made his cheeks heat a little but not make any noise of argument against.
Draco's stomach swooped and clenched as Harry's tongue came out and flicked over his tattoo, the ink that Harry had stained there himself, and he tried to relax, to settle, just like Harry had said, but it was fucking
Draco felt tears fall from the corners of his eyes once Harry was inside him, and thankfully Harry didn't comment, just pulled back from his lips enough that their noses were still brushing, and the thumb that was resting on his cheek moved to brush away one of his tears.
didn't feel right, and he wished Harry was here, but Harry had work and Draco didn't want to be needy and drag him away from that and so he just had to be patient and
It was a bit strange, the way a tear spilled out of the corner of one eye, falling down his cheek and drawing Harry's sharp eye, tilting his head to the side as he slowly pulled his fingers from Draco's mouth despite the whine of protest.
"I-I'm sorry that I fucked things up w-with us," Draco stammered out. "I-I'm sorry I just d-disappeared." Harry's body stilled next to him and Draco felt even
"What happened tonight, sweetheart?" Harry asked softly, fingertips sliding down gently his cheek before cupping his jaw. "What's going on in your head?"
He could feel himself sinking, only really focused on the slight strain of his knees, where they were bent and resting on the pillow, and on Harry's hand when it went to his hair, stroking absently every now and then before gripping the back of Draco's neck in a way that made Draco's stomach squeeze every time, resting it there.
, baby, you—you always feel amazing, baby," Harry babbled sometimes when he came, but he usually managed to pull himself together pretty quickly, especially if he was drawing out Draco's orgasm. "God, baby…" Harry drew in a sharp breath through his teeth before he was pulling back, settling back on his knees and pulling Draco's cheeks apart, exposing him completely and Draco could
it just made Draco's mind short, even in the hazy state he was in now, and his cock instantly began to fill more from the barely half-hard state that he had been in most of the evening.
!" Draco cried out, back snapping into an arch and his eyes opened wide even though his vision was completely whited out. "
Almost as soon as they got in the shower, Harry's hands were turning Draco around, making him face the warm spray and step underneath it, reaching down to pick up one of the body washes and poured some of the lotion his hand before straightening up and his hands were suddenly sliding up Draco's back and a moan was sliding from the blondes lips before he could even think about, his cheeks heating up straight away.
It felt as though cold water had been dumped over Draco's head and was sinking through the warmth of the jersey and the shirt and his pants and his shoes and his socks and his skin was cold and—
. Draco's breathing came out shakily and his hips jerked upwards before Harry's big, sure hands were pressing down firmly on both sides of his body, guiding him back down against the mattress. "Da-
Harry didn't let go of Draco's hand as he jerked the window back up and then almost fell inside, tugging Draco in after them, and when Draco was on his feet, before he had even pulled the window properly back down, Harry shoved his Draco against the wall and was kissing him again, crowding him up beside the sink and mirror, and Draco's breath felt as though it had been completely shoved out of his lungs, in
Draco licked at Harry's fingers with his tongue, hollowing out his cheeks, darting looks up at Harry who was looking back at the TV, with the hand that wasn't being sucked off by his baby cradling the back of his head, holding it quite firmly in a way that was making Draco shake, because it wasn't too obvious, it wasn't too over the top, but it was a definite, firm hold and Draco was trapped between Harry's hands and wouldn't be able to get out even if he wanted to.
There was music playing in one of the apartments nearby, something by Khalid, and Draco felt warmer in Harry's knitted jersey than he had been in his blazer and sitting next to him on the fire escape in the autumn breeze than he had felt sitting in the back of a cab, shaking with how nervous he had been driven from uptown where the party was to Harry's apartment building.
Tears dripped down Draco's cheeks unbidden, but they were of relief, as his body sagged again, Harry straightening up and easily taking his weight.
Even though it had only been a few months, Draco had lost count of the many times that he had gone down on Harry.
"That feel good, baby?" Harry whispered, and he leaned forward to press a soft kiss to the inside of Draco's thigh. "Your hole is so tight around my finger." Draco whimpered at that. "Don't know how my cock's supposed to fit in there, baby...Too tight, pretty baby," Harry kissed his thigh again, as his thick finger buried deep inside Draco, the single digit making him gasp. "Going to feel fucking perfect around me, just like I always knew you would."
"When you were taking your expensive town car across the city to the club, sitting in the back seat with your prim and proper driver, could you feel it inside you?" Harry asked, and Draco's eyes widened as he stared unseeingly ahead at Harry's words. "When that prick was trying to talk to you at the bar...He could barely take his eyes off you, baby." Draco
And Draco was so appreciative of that, because right now, sex wasn't something that was at the forefront of his mind, even though a buzz of arousal was still generated almost automatically when around Harry, and especially when he looked at him like
Draco's breathing began to pick up again and his body suddenly felt a flash of heat before feeling sweat-sticky under his arms and at his lower back and he began pulling at his clothes as he kicked off his shoes, just wanting to get free from the restrictive bonds.
Draco knew that Harry was at work, he had known that he wouldn't be here, and he purposefully hadn't text him to tell him that his father had shown up at his aunts place completely unannounced, and that he had triggered Draco's anxiety.
"Gonna let me take care of you?" Harry whispered in his ear and Draco shivered again, almost violently and he heard a low laugh from Harry, the light puffs of air against the curve of his neck, more goosebumps breaking out. "Gonna be good for me, baby?"
it came out slurred and muffled around Harry's fingers, and just around Draco's thick tongue in general, words beginning to escape him. "I wan—
"Yes," Harry didn't give him any chance to second guess the question as happiness spread like a fire in Draco's chest before smushing his lips against his in a close-mouthed but passionate kiss.
"I got scared, you know?" Draco said quickly, through puffs of smoke escaping the corners of his mouth, and he resolutely stared ahead, at the apartment building opposite Harry's that had a fading poster of the Marvel movie that came out last year, edges all frayed and peeling and dirt streaking it. "I wanted it so bad and I just—" he hissed through his teeth and dug his manicured nails into his knees. "And I was just scared that I was going to fuck things up, because I just—I'm
There was a chuckle behind him and then one of the hands on his ass moved briefly, before Draco heard the familiar sound of the lube cap being snapped open, and his body buzzed in excitement.
," Harry's voice was suddenly smooth and soothing like a salve, and his hand was moving up and down Draco's back, warm through the Balenciaga blazer and the silk shirt that he was wearing underneath. "Take a few breaths—it's okay, it's okay," Harry whispered and his voice was just so deep and nice and it made Draco feel even
It was one of Harry, Hermione, Pansy and Draco, and it had been taken about four months ago when they had gone bowling, and they had all been in the ugly striped shoes, and Luna had taken the photo and insisted that the shoes be in the photos, so they had all been trying to balance against each other and stick their feet in the ear but Draco had been laughing so much he kept overbalancing, and Luna had snapped a couple of photos, one of them with Harry reaching out and gripping Draco's elbow to help him balance on one leg with both of their other in the air and their ugly shoes showing and Draco was full on
"Hi," Draco breathed, a little confronted by, well, Harry. "H-hi," he repeated, swallowing hard, and a knowing smile spread across Harry's face, but it was nothing like the smug-ass smirk that had been on Mr Fake Gucci's face.
"That's right, sweetheart," Harry's fingers suddenly slid out of Draco and the blonde whined and wiggled his hips from side to side subconsciously, trying to lift his head and look over his shoulder, but it felt too heavy and he gave up and just let it hang down, between his shoulders. "It's okay, baby, let daddy take care of you," Harry whispered, and he was pulling Draco's cheeks further apart with lube-sticky fingers, his body shifting on the bed behind him, the mattress dipping and his thighs being shoved further apart almost carelessly, even though Draco knew that Harry would never let him faceplant into the mattress when he was feeling this shaky. "You ready for me, baby?"
"That's a...Big question," Draco huffed out a laugh as he blew out a cloud of smoke and Harry smiled with him, although his smile was less sarcastic, but didn't say anything, leaving it up to Draco to fill the space between them when he was ready. Draco took a steadying breath, fiddling with the joint and tapping off the ash from the end. "I'm sorry I ran out," Draco began, and his words came out a little more squeaky than he intended, and he plucked the lighter from where Harry had rested it on the step between them so that he could get another lungful of smoke, because he
They got up to the counter, and it was a grumpy teenager working, who had obviously pulled the graveyard, weekend shift, and Harry ordered a dozen donuts for them to take home, flipped his wallet out of his back pocket and slid out his card with just one hand, the other arm still tightly around Draco's waist, and he was smiling easily at the grumpy teenager who was
"Yeah, baby, you feel so good," Harry murmured, thrusts getting harder, cock warm and hard and unrelenting as he got harder although not much faster, and Draco's eyes rolled back, all words gone, only able to whimper out '
"Hey, baby," Harry replied easily, although a little louder than usual, which told Draco that the other guy was still there.
"You ready?" He whispered, and Draco's thighs quivered, he felt the muscles clenching and releasing as the lace of his panties was tugged against his sensitive skin and the the head of Harry's cock bumped against his hole, before sliding down between his cheeks.
"So..." Draco was here, he might as well get everything out. He had already said enough, he might as well just get everything out there, the things that had been hanging between them for the past two weeks, the worries that had literally been keeping him up at night. "We're just friends?" His voice sounded a little broken, and it definitely gave away how much he was hanging out for the answer.
," Draco's hands grabbed at Harry's shoulders, nails digging tiny crescents into the tanned skin. "So good."
Harry didn't have to tell Draco that, reassure him that he wasn't going to be far and that he was going to return quickly, but he knew that those reassurances—just those few words from him—they helped him keep floating, knowing that his daddy wasn't going to be far.
"And I'm yours, baby, okay? Just me and you," Harry whispered, and Draco liked that, liked that Harry was just as genuine, was promising him that same exclusivity. "Let's go inside—come on."
"You got dinner the other week," Harry replied, conveniently forgetting that there had been two lots of pizza ordered since then that Harry had covered, plus the snacks, food and weed that he constantly supplied Draco with and refused to take any money for no matter how much Draco tried. But Draco knew better than to argue, and he felt this warm feeling bloom inside him whenever Harry insisted on taking care of things like this for him. "Great, thanks, mate," Harry nodded at the bartender as he handed over his card, and then smiled as he looked back at Draco, very pointedly ignoring Mr Fake Gucci. "You been waiting long?"
With his eyes shut, it made his other senses flare, hyper aware of the scritching sound of Harry's pencil on his paper as he sketched tattoo ideas, and the heat of Harry's hand on the back of his neck, although not so much the background noise of the TV.
"Aw, sweetheart," Harry crooned, and then there were fingers being shoved into his mouth, not hard enough that he was choking, but enough that his eyes fully rolled back and his body jerked under Harry, attempted to arch even harder, his cock undoubtedly creating a large, wide-spread wet patch on the covers underneath from the way that he was wiggling. "You just can't seem to keep still, can you?" Harry's thrusts were deeper—slower, but deeper, and Draco couldn't help the way his hips urgently were jerking under Harry while his lips and tongue were trying to desperately work over the fingers that Harry was shoving into his mouth, keeping him full and stimulated at both ends. "If only that bastard could see you know," Harry's voice was suddenly darker and hissed and it made Draco's eyes jerk open as he whimpered. "He'd be so jealous of my pretty baby, wouldn't he?"
He held out a hand to Draco as he unfolded himself from under the sheet and duvet and as it was exposed that Draco was just in panties—Harry's eyes widened slightly and he gave Draco a slightly lewd once over that made Draco's skin heat, but that was as far as it went as he left the room to turn on the shower.
"Did you want some weed? Or a shot? Maybe that'll be better than a smoothie," he gave Draco his crooked smile and the horrible knots in Draco's stomach relaxed just a little.
"She's working at this office that's only about a block down from that coffee shop I like, actually, so…I might just have to go by there even more often," Pansy wiggled her eyebrows before looking up happily at the drinks that were being pushed across the counter. "Okay, you guys have a head start. Get us a table and me and Dray will be there soon!"
"Be good for me, pretty boy, and settle back," Harry said softly and Draco's eyelids fluttered before he took in a deep breath and just relaxed, letting Harry take back over completely.
His heart was squeezing in his chest, his stomach felt as though it was going to fall to his feet and he was barely able to keep back the tears that were hot behind his eyes.
If he was with anyone else, he would be embarrassed about the noises that he was making and the way his body was jerking and almost flopping bonelessly under Harry's grip, but he didn't have to worry about that.
Winking and pink between Draco's pretty, pale cheeks, was the glittery plug that Draco had worked into himself in one of the private bathrooms before he had left to go to the bar that evening.
"Yeah?" Harry breathed, his nose rubbing against his again, his hands rubbing up and down against Draco's sides. "You feeling good, baby? You ready?"
Walking into Harry's apartment now felt more like coming home than walking into his own apartment, even though it had only been a few months.
It might have been his mother though, he had mentioned to her at their weekly lunch the other day that he was going to be having brunch with Bellatrix today.
Draco's eyes were rolling back and drool was gathering in the corners of his mouth, not even realizing the way his attention was
"You paid at the club!" Draco attempted to sound firm, but Harry was still just smirking as he wrapped an arm around Draco's waist and pulled him in close, kissing the side of his temple and husking in his ear,
Draco was in the kitchen, ingredients out of the cupboard and a sheepish expression on his face from where he was kneeling, having accidentally tugged out about four plastic bowls and they'd tumbled out onto the ground.
"Come, baby," Harry murmured, applying more pressure and Draco's hips began to snap forward faster, even though his movements still felt sluggish and absently he knew that really, he wasn't moving that quickly at all. "Come for your daddy, love."
"This...morning?" Draco frowned towards the window, but the weather had been murky all week, and the clouds were all grey and heavy outside, he wasn't sure what time it was.
—" was all Draco managed before Harry was pressing inside and Draco's eyes rolled back into his head, the garbled moan just turning into a gurgle in his throat as his mouth hung open.
Harry didn't say much to him; he changed what was on the TV although left the volume low, and only stroked his fingers through Draco's hair, occasionally giving him a kiss and saying he was a 'good boy', which just made Draco's heart
, but he was meant to meet Harry at his and Hermione Grangers parlor after he left Bellatrix's, because Harry was only working until one. But...He had come here, because brunch obviously hadn't gone in the way he had expected. Instead of asking any questions that might suddenly put Draco on the spot, Harry tilted his head to the side and brushed his fingers over Draco's forehead. "How was your sleep, hm?"
—" Draco's cheeks burned scarlet at the admission, but he kept going. "I just wanted to feel happy, and good, and it really didn't," his voice was barely audible, teeth clenched. "And...And so I came here, because, uh,
Now he had somewhere to go, somewhere he felt safe, where he felt loved, and instead of listening to his father and whatever he had to say after storming in and beginning with, 'Your mother has informed me that you're planning on bringing this
"Thank you," Draco said softly as he followed Harry into the kitchen area, his toes curling into the bottom of his Chelsea boots, trying to ground himself as he pressed his fingernails into the palms of his hands.
Harry seemed slightly caught off guard but he caught up quickly, and he returned the pressure and Draco sighed into his mouth.
"Let's shower, yeah?" Harry murmured against his hair and Draco just nodded, glad that Harry wasn't pushing it, wasn't expecting him to open up, something that Pansy frequently did, even after all these years of friendship. He knew that was just her love language and the way she operated and it was something that he was used to after all this time, but it was nice to have someone who adapted to what
, and Draco's stomach tightened because he wondered if Harry had brought it at the Leeds concert that they'd all gone to last year.
he was getting onto the bed behind Draco. Draco shuffled his legs wider, knees further apart, trying to be as open for Harry as possible, but obviously he wasn't quite in the position that Harry wanted, because the shorter, stockier man took over, easily manhandling Draco further forward on the bed, his chest pressed down against the bed with his ass pushed up in the air. "That's better, baby," Harry sounded as though he was smiling as he ran a few fingers down the cleft of Draco's ass, through the lube, and further down over his perineum until he was able to fondle his sac lightly before finally wrapping a hand around his cock.
, baby," Harry sounded reverent as he peeled the jersey over Draco's head, careful as he went, one hand cupping the back of his head and lifting it off the pillow, taking his time with Draco's arms before he was laying on the bed in just the pink panties and the black, oversized shirt with the pink writing splashed across the front. "You have no idea how much 'Mione and Ron have heard me talk about you, how bad I just wanted to make you feel better when you looked sad after getting off a call with your boss or your asshole father, how bad I just wanted to kiss you when
an order right now. "Good boy, Dray," Harry said as he came back over to the couch and saw that Draco had twisted off the lids of their water bottles. "Thank you."
"Yes, daddy," Draco murmured, mouth feeling better than it had before even if his head was still pleasantly heavy with clouds.
"Y-yeah—yeah!" Draco couldn't help but grin, stumbling forward a bit as Harry shuffled out onto the fire escape outside and reached a hand back inside to help Draco out as well.
Maybe he shouldn't have, because Harry's eyes were suddenly so dark that Draco was instantly hard in his pants.
"You're perfect," Harry whispered, nose softly bumping his, and Draco opened his watery eyes, meeting Harry's, and there was such adoration showing there that more tears began falling. Harry's expression was so soft, and he just smiled gently, giving Draco another close mouthed kiss before he began to move with more earnest. Draco's eyes widened in surprise and Harry's smile turned to something just a little darker. "That good, baby?"
his eyes, he couldn't close them now—he couldn't take them off Harry between his legs as he shuffled back a little to pull his pants off, glad for the heater in the hallway that was spilling heat into the bedroom as well as the hallway. "I think you're
"That's right, baby," Harry kissed the other inner thigh, and then pressed the two fingers firmly back inside Draco, making him keen and want to arch his back off the bed. "Don't worry," he whispered. "I'll tell you when you can move...I'll be inside you soon, okay?" There were colours bursting behind Draco's eyelids and he could
"Oh, fuck!" Draco's hands came up, grabbing at Harry's leather jacket, manicured nails digging into the material, trying to find purchase.
When Harry woke up, he smacked his lips, winced at the fact that he had dry mouth and remembered what had happened last night.
"Did it feel good, sweetheart?" Harry asked as he pulled the jeans and panties the rest of the way down Draco's smooth legs and then straightened up, standing over Draco's naked and stretched out body, still dressed other than his shoes, despite Draco being naked in front of him. A shiver ran visibly down Draco's spine and it made Harry smile as he took off his jacket and threw it to the side. "Have you been feeling it stretch you through the night?"
