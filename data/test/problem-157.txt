He looks at you with astonishment as you hand him the metal ring along with the kindling, he’s too surprised to even say thank you.
Draco fixes him with a glare, and all playfulness is gone. “Oh there won’t be anything casual about this, Potter,” he growls, and Harry shivers in anticipation.
“Your secret is safe with me,” Neville said as he ambled out. “Although, I should mention that this won’t come as a shock to anyone except the two of you.”
Harry grabbed one plate along with one set of cutlery, because he’d rather have his arm hexed off than wash up any more of Malfoy’s dishes than strictly necessary.
Harry separated himself and began to climb off Draco, but was stopped by a sharp grip on his biceps. His dejected look immediately switched to confusion. Draco was panting harshly and it was hard to think with the lingering feeling of Harry’s teeth in his tendons, but he had to get this out.
“Some people, unlike yourself,” Draco started, “can handle smaller portion sizes and have other things to do besides stuffing themselves at an overpriced dinner.”
He was so busy trying to figure out where the suspect was, Draco didn’t notice Harry come over to his side of the bed.
You look down, trying to swallow around the lump in your throat. “That’s… that’s not something for me to have.”
Draco stills, turning his head slightly so his cheek is visible. “That—That’s what you’re focusing on?”
“I said, is Professor Potter as annoying at home as he is at school?” the girl repeated, and now the entire class was laughing openly, including Harry.
It’s tentative, chaste, not at all at par with how your entire body sets on fire at the touch. Your first instinct is to draw back, to beg his forgiveness and say that it was a mistake, but his mouth is so soft, it fits so well against yours, sliding perfectly in sync with you, and you can’t ever imagine not kissing him, and finally everything feels
If you recall correctly, it’s not far away, and huddling against the rain, you run together through the bushes and leaves, shielding your eyes against the pounding rain with your hands, Harry holding you so tightly it almost makes your arm go numb.
“No, there’s nothing you can do about it, Potter,” Draco spits, suddenly regaining some of his vigour and using it to stand up. He buttons his blood stained shirt with short angry motions. “I know it must be extremely difficult for you not being the hero for once, but in this case you’ll just have to take your fucking saviour complex and shove it.”
There were a couple of awkward rounds. Finnigan made Granger kiss Ginny, and Weasley was forced to tell them about the time between third and fourth year when he walked in on his parents shagging in the garden shed. Apparently, he still had trouble raking leaves because of the memories.
Harry didn’t need to be told twice and he shoved Draco unceremoniously onto the bed, draping himself over him, kissing and nipping everywhere he could. Sparks of pleasure rippled through Harry’s entire body as he mapped out every inch of Draco, opening him slowly with his fingers and tongue. He could feel Draco’s arousal reverberating inside himself, heightening his senses. It was like the last time they had sex, only a million times better.
“Well, whoever it is, it looks like they have a pretty grim fate ahead of them,” Ron says behind Harry, leaning over the table and pointing to a drawing of someone with tulips and carnations growing out of their mouth. Harry stares at it until his eyes go blurry, tiny dots filling his line of vision.
that Draco hadn’t meant to hurt him, but his mind was on edge, he felt frayed from the work resisting the false bond took. The way it had tugged at the edges of his emotions and clawed its way into the inmost parts of him leaving him raw.
“Well,” Draco said, thinking that answering one little innocent question that had nothing to do with his purpose today couldn’t hurt, “not as annoying as he was when we were in school together, but still quite irritating.”
Harry blinks up at her, his eyes foggy with sleep and he looks disoriented. Draco needs to restrain himself from kissing the adorable fool. “Wha? W’s going on?”
You swallow, trying not to think about how that sentence was about to end. “I’ll get you something to drink,” you say to avoid asking him.
He wants to tell her it won’t, it won’t be fine, because he’s finally admitting to himself what he’s tried to block from his consciousness for weeks now: that he’s not worthy of love, not from Potter at least. And no matter how hard he’s tried to keep himself safe from being hurt, he’s been dragged kicking and screaming into this mess, into this chaos of emotions. And he’s finally admitting that he’s nearing the end, and there’s still so much he wants to do. And there’s still so much he wants to see. And he still has this awful,
“Right,” she said, fixing Harry and Draco (such a strange name) with a stare each, “we’re going to do a group challenge on this slope. You’re all going to be starting at the same time, when the first of you has reached the peak, everyone turns and jogs back down. The one who got to the top first has to catch up with the rest of the group so you’ll all return at the same time. Then we’ll repeat it until I say you’re done. Any questions?” She looked around at them all, noticing that Draco and Harry seemed to have some sort of silent argument going on: Draco was smirking, his eyebrow drawn up, and Harry was scowling. “Well then! Get set!” she said, clapping her hands. Both Harry and Draco startled, but followed the others and taking their places. “And go!” Sheila shouted, watching as the group of 14 people set off.
doesn’t deserve you, because if they did they’d be here, right? Who in their right mind could know you, know the real you, and
Potter was trying to change the music as Thomas and Finnigan’s dancing was getting more and more filthy. Ginny was jumping around them in some sort of attempt at dancing, and even though she looked like she was having some sort of seizure, it was still charming somehow. But it only took one very meaningful look from Granger to make her stroll up to Potter and lower the volume.
You feel your face heat at his words, embarrassment at showing him something private lodging itself in your throat. “I do. It’s like watching the circle of life up close. Almost like giving birth to these plants.”
He didn’t get any further, because right then, Harry decided that he needed to do what he did best: use his gut. And his gut told him that he was pants with words, especially compared to Draco. And he wanted to make Draco stop talking, so he did the first thing that came to mind. He stepped closer and pressed his lips to Draco’s. It was probably the most chaste kiss he’d ever experienced, and yet it gave his stomach that funny swooping feeling again. Draco made a funny sound, like a mix of a squeak and a sharp inhale, and Harry realised that maybe this wasn’t what Draco wanted and started to pull back. But then he was thoroughly proven wrong when Draco grabbed him by the collar and pushed him backwards until they hit the opposite wall. Harry gasped when his head thumped against it, and then again when Draco opened his mouth and
I kind of want to do it again, but I don’t know how Draco feels about it, if he’d even be willing to do it again, and I don’t know how to bring it up without sounding like… I don’t know, without coming on too strong. Or making him think I’m attracted to him or something.
Okay, I don’t really know what’s going on right now. With Draco I mean. This… sex thing we do has become sort of normal now? Or, well, we do it from time to time and… it’s always so good. It feels amazing. Strange but amazing. Sometimes I think it’s the best sex I’ve ever had because it’s like Draco knows what I want, but I guess that’s just because we know each other so well by now. I don’t know. I’m really confused and I don’t know what we’re doing. I mean we’re both straight, but every time we have sex it’s like… it’s exhillarating in a way I haven’t felt in a long time. If ever. Whenever I’m in my room I think about sucking him off, or him doing it to me, and I get so unbelievably hard that I have to work myself off to relieve the pressure.
Draco didn’t know how it felt. He didn’t know how invasive it was for someone to just stay inside your head without an end in sight, and how suddenly Harry had felt nothing. He had fought Voldemort in his head countless times, pushed away Imperio over and over again, it always left a void. He had been standing three feet away from Draco and Harry hadn’t been able to do a thing—
“Oh Merlin, spare me,” Potter muttered, which made Draco giggle, before Potter’s look of utter surprise at his behaviour made him realise what he was doing.
I know Draco has had more trouble sleeping lately. I think this being forced to stay inside triggers memories from when he used to have Voldemort in his home, even if it’s not the same now at all.
“Oh don’t worry about him. Did I mention those little love potions we provided you with prior to your visit have a bit of a backdoor built into them? Sort of an insurance policy of sorts if something goes wrong and the wizard who brings them in can’t pay or tries to change their mind. With the right spell and a little of the legilimency we use here, we can switch their allegiance to whatever witch or wizard we choose.”
Thinking that he’s okay with having to wait a while until he’ll get to suck Draco off, Harry drags his gaze from Draco’s twitching cock to his face. “I really want you to fuck me,” he says before he pulls the soft fabric down. Draco’s erection springs free and bumps against his stomach while Harry lodges the elastic just under his balls and his buttocks. “Like this.”
“He…” Draco falters. The truth is unbearable to speak aloud, but she deserves it, she deserves to know it all. “We had an… agreement. Only something casual, naturally. But he broke it off.” He hangs his head, unable to look at her, but he keeps going, forcing the words out of his mouth the way those awful plants do. “Our quote unquote agreement stated that we’d keep fucking each other as long as no one caught feelings. And when he realised I had, because I was fucking coughing up flowers fucking everywhere, he broke it off.”
Okay, so about the cuddles. I didn’t mention them before because I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but the more I think about it, the more I realise Draco has been acting weird ever since. Even his talking about Astoria has increased since then. I guess I’ll write it down to sort through my mind.
“Did you… did you hurt yourself?” he asks in a low voice, his breath sending shivers down your spine, and you can’t help but let out a gasp at the sensation of his chest pressed against your back.
He sighs, dropping his hands. “All my life, I used to think I was a sinner, Draco, that I was weak for having these… urges. That if I just punished myself enough, they would go away. And then I met you. And I know now, that… this isn't a choice. This is how I was made, this is how the Lord created me. This is how He created you, too.”
it grow bigger and bigger and it was another thing entirely, seeing it up close than watching it from above, like I do when I look down at myself. And then I just… stuck my tongue out and started licking his cock.
Now that Harry looks at him properly he does seem rather pale, his hand now grasping around his throat instead.
“Wait, what happened —?” he begins, looking up to see what remains of them lying on the bed beside them.
“I don’t usually share my clothes, but I’ll make an exception if it’ll increase my chances of getting this room to myself.”
You both laugh as you scramble to sit up properly, Harry’s breath warm against the side of your neck, and you feel goosebumps all over your body. You place your hands on his shoulders, pushing yourself up, and when you see his face it’s like that time in the garden shed, his eyes dark and his breathing coming in shallow bursts. You can’t seem to move. He licks his lips, and your eyes follow the motion, the quick flash of pink so tantalising. You should get up, you should get away from him, but instead you lean in closer, his green eyes getting blurry, your mouth hovering just above his.
The whole thing was actually kind of nice. I mean it’s always nice to have someone else touch you, and Draco was really good at wanking me off. It was so obvious that he knew exactly how to hold a cock, but he did the wanking a bit different than I usually do, but it was in a good way. We were a little awkward afterwards, but we managed to laugh it off and agree that it was nice, and that it was just two good straight friends helping each other out, and… that was it. Draco spelled the mess away, and we got dressed and then we watched another episode of One Tree Hill before we went to our respective rooms and went to sleep.
Pansy looks utterly confused for a moment, but then her eyes widen and she straightens up a bit. “Wait, are you talking about that old curse where if you have penetrative sex before marriage, the guy gets stuck inside you?”
“Wanker,” Potter says before he catches Draco’s lips with his own. Draco chuckles, enjoying the soft slide of Potter’s mouth.
He’s recently got his glasses and his enjoyment at being able to see properly again makes you pleased as well.
“Because,” he sighs, letting his hands fall into his lap. It hurts. “Because I knew you’d be worried, and that you’d try to convince me to seek help, and… I didn’t want that. I know what’s to come, I know the cure and I know I won’t get it.”
fucking him, to have his cock sliding into him again and again, and he doesn’t want to wait anymore.
“Potter! Malfoy! My office, NOW!” Robards' voice rang through the bullpen startling several people. Draco and Harry were not particularly excited about explaining everything.
. I wish he’d stop talking about her all the damn time, I don’t need to be reminded of how amazing she is
Harry stirs in his sleep, sighing and pressing himself closer to you, and you can’t find it in yourself to think about it anymore, not when you have this. You decide to let it go for now, to dwell on the consequences of your actions tomorrow.
“Professor Malfoy, this is highly unprofessional,” Harry had panted into Draco’s ear as he’d pressed himself closer, running his hands along Draco’s back.
Draco handed Harry the map back and then shoved him none too kindly on his way to the bathroom. Ignoring the blaring sign in his head that said not to, he threw a cleaning Charm over himself.  They had a job to do. Throwing off the invasive scrubbed feeling all over him, Draco threw his uniform on.
You smile again, careful not to make it into a grin at the thought of it being a punishment, having Harry as your only company. “Yes, well, one could say we’re helping each other stay away from the temptation of women, when it gets too overwhelming.”
“And now, you relax,” Draco murmurs and manoeuvers Harry into the living room, kissing him all the while.
Jane chuckles and starts with the coffee, banging her tools. “One quadruple shot espresso, coming right up!”
“I was… There was this man, in my village. We used to… I used to help him take care of his animals, feed the chickens and the sheep and so on. And we became friends.”
It’s such a ridiculous thought that Potter would ever say something like this to him, he still expects to be on the receiving end of Potter’s contempt, not his praise. Draco has to laugh, he’s still a little bit out of breath, and that’s probably what the tickling in his chest comes from, a subtle scratching deep down. “Yeah, I know.”
were the one who definitely wanted to keep it casual. I just happened to have some other casual sex with another person.”
“Well, consider it an early birthday present from me to you. Did you record it? Or are you going to show everyone later in a Pensieve?”
He finally reaches their landing and, with trembling fingers and a pounding heart, he turns the door knob.
He sounds oddly formal, oddly nervous. Could this be…? Draco’s heart flutters, but is held back by its confinements. He doesn’t want to hope, it’s too dangerous, and yet he can’t help it.
He’s so tired, exhausted really, all his energy is focused on not falling into a heap on the floor, and he still has to use it to explain this very simple thing to her. “It doesn’t work like that, he can’t just tell me and it’ll disappear. I need to believe it. Or, I guess my heart needs to be convinced that he loves me. So if I tell him, I’ll never know if he does it to be honourable or because he really feels it. Ergo: it won’t work.”
After the prayer, he quickly disappears, and you can’t catch up with him because you need to walk slowly and solemnly. He’s not there for supper, and you miss saying goodnight to him more than you can say.
“I mean, yeah I can get that it’s annoying to find hair in the drain, or that I leave toothpaste on the sink, or that I forget to wipe down the kitchen counter. But he’s constantly throwing parties, going on dates, having… you know… people over. To… do stuff.”
Malfoy was obviously trying to sound surprised, but Harry knew better than that. He glared at the tosser to show his dislike, and not at all because he couldn’t take his eyes off Malfoy’s infuriatingly well muscled shoulders, or how his chest showed through the lowly cut armholes of his top, or how those joggers must be held up by magic, or by the grace of some deity, because they certainly looked like they could come off enticingly easily. If one just tugged gently at them, they’d probably fall all the way down at once, and from what Harry could see, he realised with a funny feeling spreading to his crotch, Malfoy wasn’t wearing anything underneath.
You nod, allowing yourself to snuggle in closer to him, listening to the steady rhythm of his beating heart, and eventually you fall asleep.
“Honestly, Pansy, the only reason why I called you was because you should have some knowledge on this,” Draco snaps. “The
You fail miserably when you hear a wolf howling in the distance, and you start running wildly into the forest, twigs and pine needles scratching at your face. But you hardly feel them, you need to keep running, need to find the cabin.
Sure enough, that was crossing the line. “I thought I made myself clear that the first time we did this was an exception. I don’t do sleepovers.”
Harry laughed softly, his mouth so close to Draco’s now, and he tilted his head, and if Draco just leaned a little bit forward—
Draco swallows drily. He wants to stand up and run away from here, cover his ears and scream at the top of his lungs, but he needs answers.
Harry scrambled up to standing, stammering his apologies, but Malfoy merely leaned back, supporting himself on his hands, a satisfied smile on his lips. “I’m terribly sorry, Ms Allen, we’ll try to keep it private from now on.”
So we kissed and we laughed and we kissed some more and laughed at the same time, and thankfully, somehow I got the presence of mind to turn off the stove which was lucky because the food would’ve burned when Draco backed me up against the sink and then he
“Well obviously it was hard to miss how your eyes lit up as soon as you saw him when you came in. I’m surprised no one else noticed,” Luna says in her airy but matter of fact kind of way. “But I guess most people aren’t very observant of their surroundings, they’re too focused on themselves.”
“As you wish,” Draco says, his voice not quite as nonchalant as he’s apparently trying to make it sound. “Lie back, then.”
That night you lie awake, staring out into the darkness, Brother Matthew’s words playing over and over in your head.
Still, you can’t erase an upbringing of learning that what you’ve done with Harry is wrong, so every day you pray for strength to keep away from him, to treat him as a friend. But every time you come near him, it all crumbles and you can’t help yourself, you need to feel him again, and every second spent in his presence without touching him is a waste of time.
Harry moaned and grabbed Draco’s hips, flipping them swiftly surprising Draco into a squeak again. Harry climbed up to straddle Draco’s face and tangle one hand in his hair; the other braced against the headboard.
Potter rubbed his neck awkwardly. “Yeah, I know. Ginny told me to cut it out because it’d give you the wrong impression, but I guess… she’s safe, you know? We don’t have anything going on and we never will. But with you…”
you six months ago not to tell me how it felt to have Malfoy fuck you. But did you listen?” Ron answers his own question by shuddering.
“Shut up, Ron, my arse is nice looking. And it’s not as if you haven’t seen it before, we shared a dorm for six years and slept in the same tent for months!” Harry snaps over his shoulder.
Draco kept staring at me, and when I started doing the squats he even left the room, even though the episode hadn’t ended yet. That was a bit weird, wasn’t it?
A deep sob leaves you at his words, you’re gulping for air but choke on it. This can’t be happening.
“Oh, Potter, didn’t see you there,” he said with an air of innocence. “But I’m happy you’re here so I can ask for your opinion. Do you think I’m dressed more appropriately now?”
The thought had crossed Harry’s mind almost immediately after Draco had returned from the Legilimency session. His face must have said as much, because Draco bent down to look at his menu with a roll of his eyes, muttering, “Why do I even bother.”
Harry squirmed a bit at the teasing smile Ebba directed at him, and he glanced over at Draco, who seemed to be listening with rapt attention.
“All things considered,” Harry stretched while shifting over to the side of the bed, “probably not. I’m thinking about it as well.”
“Even though the plants are receding, the disease is still somewhat active inside you. Your body will be fragile in these early stages, since it was so widespread and had been dormant for so many years, and you will feel unstable initially. But the more you have him around, and the more affection he shows, the more your heart will know that his love is true and that will help you recover faster.”
“Mmm, I love yoga, don’t you, Malfoy?” Harry said, folding his hands and stretching them up above his head with a reverent sigh. “I think it really helps your - ah - blood flow,” he added with a glance down at Malfoy’s crotch, where a bulge was visible through the thin fabric. Harry rose gracefully from the floor and was pleased to see Malfoy’s pale cheeks turn a flattering shade of pink as he looked down at his mat. “Need any help there, Malfoy? I mean with getting up,” Harry said, and when Malfoy’s eyes flitted to his with a slightly panicked look, he smirked, “from the floor.”
. And it was so freeing to have someone I didn’t have to explain everything to. I mean sure, Ginny could understand well enough when we were together, but compared to Draco and I she was so protected during the war, she didn’t
“Oh fuck me, that’s so hot,” he whispers, and then his lips are on Harry’s, nipping, biting, coaxing them open to slip his tongue inside Harry’s mouth, knocking Harry’s glasses ascew, and Harry’s spent cock twitches at the intensity with which Draco kisses him, his hand in Harry’s hair and his chest pressed flush against Harry’s.
I started strumming the guitar today and it took Draco ten seconds to stand in my doorway, asking me if I was about to learn how to play Wonderwall. He said it like it was a bad thing. Also, how does he even know that song? When I asked him he just rolled his eyes and muttered something about Blaise Zabini learning to play it in sixth year to get girls.
But the most common are roses. Red roses with velvety thick, dark crimson petals. Something a lovesick teenager would give their crush for Valentine’s Day.
“Draco? What are you —?” he starts, but is cut off by a wolf howling in the distance. “Come on, we must get inside,” he says, grabbing your hand to help you get up.
Even though Harry loves the command in Draco’s voice, he’s just about to say something about how he couldn’t care less if his floors get ruined. But the way Draco looks at him, like he wants to devour him, leaves no room for objection, so he obediently toes off his shoes, kicking them to the side.
“—to think about this clearly. We plan. We let the team back home know, and we tackle this in the morning the way Kingsley would want us to.”
“I must say that surprises me, I assumed you’d miss my perfect arse and my unprecedented blow job skills.”
“Draco,” he says, his voice raspy and guttural in his throat, and it’s all that’s needed for you to succumb.
Chuckling to himself, Harry gets up and gets his coffee, flashing Jane a bright smile as he hands her the money. “Sorry for being an arse, it’s just been a rough day.”
“Yeah, well, you know how it is. I’ve been here for so long I’ve seen most of it. I mean the lad’s been through enough, he could do with letting off some steam.”
“Ha, that’s cute. Who do you think stands a better chance, the Chosen One, or the former Death Eater? Now, take this.”
Well, all except one, he thought. Draco hadn’t been able to get out of his work shift, and Harry refused to admit how disappointed he’d been when he’d found out about that, because it wasn’t reasonable for him to be. It wasn’t as if he expected Draco to be around all the time now just because they were sort of friends, or at least hung out in the same friend circles. But still, it wasn’t every day you turned 25 and wanted to celebrate with the people you cared most about.
Made some brownies today. Draco had five while complaining loudly that I’ll ruin his physique if I’m going to keep this up, though he refuses to join the fitness challenge. Not that he has anything to worry about, he’s as slim as ever.
It takes a moment where Harry is just staring at Draco, trying to process the words, but it’s hard, he can’t fit them into place. But then it’s like his body is finally kicking into gear, operating on its own, and he gets up from his chair so quickly that it topples over as he all but flings himself towards Draco, setting off every alarm set up around the bed as he clumsily climbs onto it, shoes and all.
“I’m sorry, Draco, Luna was the one who told me to contact Ebba about going to a genuine Swedish midsummer celebration. I had no idea this was what was in store.”
Draco runs a hand through Harry’s hair, lets it rest at the nape of his neck. He smiles at the memory of Harry’s stubbornness, but then he’s almost overcome with horror at what could’ve happened, at how he almost let his pride and fear of being rejected kill him. There are a lot of things to unpack here he realises, but for now he decides to focus on just enjoying being alive and well.
“Draco,” he sighs between kisses, his voice reverent as he lets his hands run along the sides of your abdomen. “Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?”
“Obviously,” Harry gritted out, pressing his oranges a little too hard, making him reach the pith. Great. Fucking Malfoy. Now the juice would taste bitter.
Frowning, Harry watched her skip away through the high grass, her white dress billowing around her legs, in stark contrast to her wellies.
Harry’s at a loss for words. They haven’t really talked about their past other than what they covered when Ginny and Pansy started dating, but since they got together, Draco’s told Harry enough for him to understand that he fancied Harry, if grudgingly, even when they went to school. He wants to say the same, but it wouldn’t be true because he was too busy hating Draco and then feeling sorry for him, not realising what his constant obsession with Draco was until years later.
“It’s bad enough to be trapped in your own mind under these circumstances. But to be trapped in plain sight, it’s no wonder this wasn’t uncovered sooner.”
fight each other at school (and that got me thinking about how I used to think about Sirius, though I’ve never told her that).
, but I can’t. I can’t change who I am. And I don’t want to.” You watch his throat work as he swallows. “I used to think I was a sinner, that I was weak, but I’m not Draco. And neither are you.”
It’s warm inside, the fire crackling merrily, a stark contrast to the cold panic you left behind. You’re both panting heavily, and Harry is so close, his body a reassurance that you’re still alive, that you’re safe now, finally reunited with him. Your body reacts instantly, turning to him almost unconsciously.
“Oh, come on, remember when Draco went to Healer school and he fell in love with Keith Hendricks and bought him that ridiculously expensive non-spatter cauldron?” Ron chortled on Harry’s other side.
Burying his nose between Draco’s shoulder blades, Harry snorts. “Well, at least nothing else is stiff right now.” Luckily he has the presence of mind to move his leg before Draco manages to kick his shin again.
You follow the Prior through the cloister into the infirmary. Of the hurt pilgrims and other wanderers that pass through here, you’re only assigned the most complicated cases. When you see the poor man on the bed, your heart clenches. He’s in a bad state: his clothes are torn and through the gashes you can see that his skin is severely hurt. You’re not even sure you’ll be able to save him, but you set to work at once.
“I’m acting like a man under a love potion, inhibitions and protestations suppressed and replaced with the need to please.”
The plan had been to trick one of the resort workers into thinking we were distracted and then track them down when they were unaware. For someone who often jumped the gun and said fuck it to the Ministry more times than he could count, Draco thought Harry was being evasive. In fact, if Draco had to guess, Harry would have generally strayed from the plan—
Shit, I’m getting hard just thinking about this. I should stop. I can’t even say how it felt to have
“It was. So if I’m not mistaken we’re about to consummate it now.” He looked up at Harry, his eyes guarded. “This would be your chance to back out.”
“Which is why,” Harry said, with a dreading realization, “this is the perfect place to kidnap someone and hold them hostage.”
“Well as nice as that sounds, I still have to go to work,” Harry pipes up, and immediately hides his face between Draco’s shoulder blades at Pansy’s withering stare.
. My hips started bucking against him of their own accord, and I buried my face in the crook of his neck and I moaned so loudly I was practically screaming. It was embarrassing, except that it wasn’t, or I didn’t care, because it felt so
“My, my, manners, dear. What would your mother say? Not even a hello and a kind word for your fiance?”
“Yeah, I’ll… I’ll think about it, Luna.” He drains the last remnants of his espresso and stands up. “Sorry, but I need to head home and take a nap or… something.”
Harry puts a hand on the small of Malfoy’s back, lets his fingers slip under his waistband to brush the soft skin there, and has to bite down on a smile at the shiver he gets in response.
When he pushes the door open the music outside turns into a deafening roar: there’s a cacophony of voices mixed with the pounding bassline, but time seems to stop when Harry sees Malfoy standing in front of him, one foot propped up against the wall, an easy smile playing on his lips. And just like that, the music fades and the chattering dies and all Harry can hear is his own heartbeat and air drawn down inside his chest and out again. And all of it underlined with all consuming thoughts about how he desperately needs to find out how Malfoy tastes. His mouth, his cock, his arse, Harry wants to know it all, wants to learn in intimate detail. He doesn’t even need to say anything, he knows that Malfoy knows, knows that he wants the same, and wordlessly they gravitate towards each other, Malfoy’s hand on his hip and his breath tickling Harry’s ear as he whispers, “Your place or mine?”
Last time we were doing it, he grabbed both of our cocks in one hand, and then he spelled some lube on them, and he wanked us both off at the same time. It was… like everything else we’ve done it felt so good. But that must be because it’s so new. I mean, I’ve never felt an erection against my own, the feeling of it was so… it was so smooth. I couldn’t look away, the way his hand was pumping us, and the way his cock twitched beside mine, it was mesmerising, and I just wanted
Harry blushed while Draco waxed poetic about their date week. He knew he was in over his head with Draco as his betrothed at the marriage retreat. He had tried many times to bury his feelings for his sometimes partner, but it was going to be difficult with the new close proximity at all times.
“Oh! Well, yes, it’s like a Muggle psychiatrist,” Draco said, relieved to have a reasonable explanation for the word. “And like a Muggle psychiatrist, I help patients by going through difficult things that have happened to them and then giving them tools to cope with these traumas in a healthy way.”
He laughs. It’s a terrible sound, it’s not his usual joyous burst of happiness, it’s short, entirely mirthless. “Oh, I know that, trust me. So before we had the chance to go any further, do anything worse, I left. I left him and I went to atone for my sins.”
“I thought, what we did before, I wasn’t sure if you were under the influence, if I was taking advantage,” Draco said quietly, eyes cast down.
“Potter!” he wheezed in a very dignified manner. “Has no one ever told you it’s impolite to sneak up on people like that?”
Draco, however, has trouble sitting up at all. He’s dizzy from the lack of oxygen, his breathing coming in short painful bursts, and the twigs inside his bloodstream are making it hard to keep his posture with how they’re weighing him down.
In a way it’s been a lot calmer now that we’re huddled inside avoiding exposure to the disease, even if it gets tedious and I sometimes want to scream from boredom.
Draco tilted his head and looked sweetly at Harry. “And why would I want a rougher texture to my hair?”
A warm feeling which has nothing to do with the searing pain in his side fills Harry’s chest. It’s still strange to think that he and Draco, despite their shared history, actually ended up here.
“And go!” Ms Allen shouted behind them, and the entire group took off, Malfoy getting a fraction of a second’s head start on Harry. This wouldn’t do.
He’s able to hide it from his friends by excusing himself to the bathroom every time he feels an attack approaching, but it’s always worse during or after he’s seen Potter. He often manages to hide it from him as well, but since Potter doesn’t have the boundaries a normal person has, he’s managed to walk in on Draco right after an attack to find blood and flowers in the basin before Draco has had time to vanish them. With time, Potter’s initial amusement turns into obvious horror, and Draco suspects that it’s only a matter of time before he figures out what’s going on.
Harry whispered his answer against Draco’s exposed skin as he kissed down his chest. “Locking spell, slight sound enhancing for our lurkers, and a detection spell on the hallway that is linked to our enchanted parchment. All movement will be recorded. We need to give them a show so they don’t notice our tracking spell.”
“My cousin here has taken a fancy to him, and since he has been so instrumental in helping me get this little rehabilitation clinic running, I thought he deserved a reward.”
“If it doesn’t help, I also have pain relief remedies, but I only make those in small quantities and distribute them one dose at a time since they are highly dangerous if taken in too large amounts. But if you want any I can send one dose with you now.”
Harry felt bad, because Draco’s anger had now been replaced with an air of bitter resignation: his shoulders were slumped and when he turned to go back into the shower, he didn’t have his usual swagger.
. This is literally a place to hook up. If one of us, or both even, get lucky tonight, maybe neither of us will spend the night here.”
Hermione waved faintly. “We wanted to see how Harry was settling in, since it’s his first time looking after himself.”
“That’s your idea of comfort?” Harry rolled his eyes. Draco let his eyes fall to Harry’s chest. His breathing returned to normal and Draco lowered his eyes even farther, Harry’s fists were unclenching and rising up to meet Draco’s arms. “Please,” Harry said, his voice pleading. “Tell me that we’re going to get these fuckers?”
When he couldn’t see the house anymore he walked down to the beach. During their stay here, he’d found the ever moving waves rolling in over the sand soothing for his mind, and for the first time in a few hours he felt his shoulders drop and he could breathe freely. He stopped when he reached the water, stooping down to roll up his linen trousers to let the waves lap at his ankles. Letting his head fall back, he drew a deep breath, flexing his fingers.
“I’m… I’m not sure. They just… come. Sometimes. From here,” Draco says, wheezes, pointing to his chest.
But okay, back to Draco. Like I said, Hermione said I’ve had a thing for him for ages, and we both agreed that whatever those feelings were, I’m now probably (most definitely) in love with him. Hermione even thinks he might be in love with me as well, based on his behaviour (and she mentioned something about how he acted at school too), but I’m not so sure.
“I… When I arrived I saw your name on the guest list and I… paid the crew to put us in the same room.”
You notice there’s a bitterness to his voice, and you want to say something to make it go away, but your mind has stopped working upon seeing the hairs forming a path from his navel and disappearing under the sheet you’ve draped over him for privacy. His stomach is moving up and down as he breathes and speaks, and you’re hypnotised by it, and a part of you wishes that the fabric would slip down further. You have to shake yourself.
A week later, Harry was brushing his teeth when Malfoy ran into the bathroom and opened the toilet lid completely unabashed.
Draco gasps softly, and Harry regrets the words even before they leave his mouth, but he’s too angry, too stubborn to take them back, and he turns on the spot to Disapparate, vaguely registering Draco rubbing at his chest.
“Yeah, I guess I’m going soft… I’ll give them 15 more minutes before I’m summoning the security team. He may be the Saviour, but he’s
Pansy bites her lip, looking almost fond, which is a strange thing to see on her face, Harry thinks. And then the truth of it all sinks in. He tenses up at the realisation, and he notices Draco does as well a second later.
“Harry.” Draco’s voice is firm but kind. “If you really want me to fuck you, you need to stop doing that or I’ll come before I get the chance.”
Hermione gives Ron a significant look, but neither of them say anything more. Thankfully, Rose has managed to grab Ron’s spatula and is apparently tired of the lack of attention, so she flips it across the room, making them all snap out of it. Harry takes advantage of the commotion to slink away to the bathroom, where he stands in front of the mirror and tries to regain his equilibrium.
After the cleaning, you put St. John’s wort ointments and wrappings of lavender on the wounds. He flinches in pain, even though he’s still in a deep sleep, and you try to be even more gentle so as not to disturb him.
The door in front of them opens and Draco’s healer, Sadie Goodwin, a woman about his own age, steps out.
Draco gasps at Harry’s words but tries to hide it with a moan as Harry grabs one of his arse cheeks to sling his leg around Harry’s waist. “Tell me.”
Harry blinked, extremely confused by this change in Draco’s behaviour. Sure, they were good friends, and relaxed around each other, but the physical contact Draco had graced Harry with so far had consisted of accidental brushes of hands when he’d given Harry a cup of tea, or a friendly shove now and then. Nothing more. And now he was pressing himself as close to Harry as he could without actually sitting on his lap.
It had been a chaste, soft kiss at first, until Harry had involuntarily made a sound almost like a moan, which had made Draco yank Harry by the front of his robes, turn them around, and press Harry up against the wall.
“Oh, well that explains why my hair feels so soft,” Harry said, bringing a hand up to ruffle his unusually smooth and tameable hair.
But a few weeks later, he gets slowly but steadily worse. Every morning he wakes up with a new itching in his chest and an overwhelming need to cough. It’s like that first flower was an early sign, and now the rest of the plants have bloomed in silence inside him.
“Yeah, sorry. It was just Luna being Luna.” Harry leans in, brushing his lips over that spot underneath Draco’s ear that always makes him shiver whenever Harry touches it. Today is not an exception and Harry flicks out his tongue, chuckling softly when Draco lets out a gasp. “Let’s get away from here, yeah?”
“Let’s go to sleep now, my love,” Harry says, interrupting your thoughts. “We have a long day ahead of us.”
It’s a beautiful day. May is almost here and this early there’s still a chill in the air, making the colours seem crisp and fresh, and as soon as you step out of the gates you feel like you can breathe more freely, like you can shrug a thick layer of dust off your shoulders. The sky is clear and the sun is warming your face.
, I was referring to… that... thing,” Harry said, indicating the luscious bed facing the double glass doors leading out to the patio.
? He scowled at Pansy, the absolute traitor, but she merely shrugged and put her arm around Luna’s waist, whispering something in her ear to make her blush and giggle.
voice made Harry wince as he sat cross-legged in his favourite squishy armchair. A belly full of birthday cake and the comfort of  his friends surrounding him made Harry sleepy; but as he watched them all scramble to get seated as close to him as possible, a warmth rose in his chest. Ron had, of course, already sat down on the sofa closest to Harry before he made the announcement, but at Harry’s single raised eyebrow he shrugged with a crooked grin.
“I know what a fucking date is,” Harry muttered, suddenly feeling very much annoyed for no apparent reason.
“Draco, for a Mindhealer who teaches others how to improve their self image, you’re very bad at forgiving yourself for what you did during the war,” Harry said softly, resting his forehead against Draco’s. “You’ve done enough to redeem yourself: you’re helping people work through their trauma, you’ve used your family fortune to start funds for war victims, you volunteer at the orphanage, what else do you think you have to do to earn forgiveness?”
He starts to tear up, but he presses it back and shrugs one shoulder. “Yeah. Or maybe it was just complicated, I’m not really sure.”
“I’m sorry,” he mumbles. “I had a really nice time, but I— I’m not looking for anything right now, I have someone I need to get over.”
“Not necessarily in love, but it’s someone you’ve had strong feelings towards, and with time, they’ve developed into romantic ones.”
But you can’t deny that he very much interests you, and you realise you want to learn everything there is to know about him.
“Honestly. I paid a fair amount for this trip, and now I have to share a room with the man with the biggest head in Britain.”
with Draco, when he already had someone? Unless it was some other reason. Unless it was… Unless he’d figured out how gone Draco was for him.
“I suppose it’s not my place to enquire about your relationship with our Lord,” you say in an attempt to smooth things over, and you decide to leave it be. For now. You’ve met enough pilgrims in your time here to know that this kind of reaction means he did something he needs to atone for. You want to tell him that whatever he did, he’s forgiven, but that’s not your place.
“No, I—” he starts, but then coughs, and when he continues his voice sounds strained. “I’m not really in the mood. Or I— I remembered I have someplace to be, I need to—”
“Well what if I want you to?” Harry says, and it sounds sincere even if Draco knows they’re only joking around. Or at least he thinks they are.
Draco shifts on the bed, prodding Potter’s shoulder. “Hey, don’t fall asleep, I have to get back to work five minutes ago.”
Unfortunately for Draco, this meant that it was his job to transfigure something and/or move them aside so they could get to whatever hellish trapdoor awaited them.
“You did the whole looking at her from under your fringe, while giving her that dazzling smile, you know, the one that makes your eyes light up and… er…”
“Yeah, yeah of course. Um, I’m going to head out. Thank you for this week, Draco, I had a great time. See you Sunday.” Harry dropped a kiss on Draco’s cheek and swiftly left the club before he could protest. He could feel tears forming behind his eyes. This assignment was going to be the death of him, he just knew it.
To anyone else her words might seem harsh and cruel, but Draco sees the trembling of her lips, the subtle crease between her eyebrows, and he knows that she’s worried about him, knows that this is her way of coping. It makes everything worse, these feelings, clogging everything, sticking to him like gum underneath his shoe.
Harry shrugged. “It’ll be fine, Ron, don’t worry about it,” he said, not mentioning that he felt like he’d jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire.
“Yeah,” Ron snorted, “I thought we’d have a third wizarding war when Hermione suggested you take Parkinson’s old room, but —”
“I’m trying to eat some dinner, and I’d like to have it on a plate, you know, like a civilised person.”
I actually started knitting. Mostly to keep my hands from fidgeting out of nervousness, but also because I was hoping that if Draco saw it he’d laugh at me and we could start from there. But he’s still keeping to his room a lot of the time.
And then he bumps into Cho. Or rather, a few weeks after Harry called it off with Draco, she walks into his shop, wanting to repair her broom. He’s been following her career distantly over the years, not least since Ginny’s been complaining loudly every time she’s had to meet Cho in a match. Apparently she’s still an excellent Seeker, and she’s still very pretty, Harry thinks when she greets him with a warm smile.
“Oh my, Potter, I’m so sorry, did I distract you again?” he said, putting a hand over his heart, and Harry realised he’d been standing completely still for an entire minute by now, still holding a hollowed out half of an orange. His face heated at the realisation and he quickly turned away with the pretense of throwing the orange rind away.
Harry lay down behind him, throwing one arm around Draco and pulling him closer. “I know,” he said, kissing the nape of Dracos’ neck, the soft hair tickling his nose. “Like never finding out you want me as much as I want you.” He slid his hand over Draco’s side, over his hip, letting it rest there. “I don’t want to back out,” he said. “I want this. I want you.”
Potter worries his bottom lip between his teeth, his hair messier than usual and Draco realises he must’ve been running his hand through it multiple times while he waited for Draco to answer the door.
,” Draco groans, and his cock gives a little twitch against Harry’s hip, noticable through the thin fabric of his designer pants. “Fuck, Harry, do you have any idea what you do to me?”
After what feels like a lifetime, Draco’s breathing evens out and arduously he starts to sit up, like he’s old and fragile, finally leaning back against Harry’s vacated armchair.
Harry startled at Ebba’s voice, and when he turned to her, he realised she must’ve been trying to get his attention for some time.
He turns his back towards the counter and immediately searches out Draco again, who is sitting with his head tilted, watching him silently. Draco covertly cocks one eyebrow, his eyes darting quickly towards the door, and heat rushes through Harry’s body. He answers with a tiny nod before sitting down beside Luna, slowly drinking the rest of his coffee.
He slips out of you and you mourn the loss of him, but he turns you both on your sides, entwining his hand with yours and pressing his chest to your back, both of your hands resting over your heart, his breaths tickling your neck, and you feel entirely content.
“You don’t have to say the same, Harry, I know it wasn’t like that for you. I’m just— I’m happy we got here eventually.”
“Fuck, Harry, I was so scared when I came to and you were gone,” Draco said between kisses as he yanked Harry’s trousers down. “Seeing you with that buffoon, looking all smitten, was just…”
Harry could only stare at him, at the way his hair fell into his eyes and how he had to constantly flick his head to keep it away. The flush on his cheeks from apparently having rushed from the hospital, just to be able to celebrate Harry’s birthday because he knew how important it was to him. Or maybe because he’d seen how disappointed Harry’d been when Draco’d told him he wouldn’t be able to make it and now he‘d wanted to make it up to him. The care with which he had selected a present for Harry just to make him happy. There was a swooping sensation in Harry’s stomach, and suddenly his mouth started speaking before he could stop himself.
I was planning on talking to Draco, but the opportunity just never showed. So. I guess there’s a new day tomorrow.
to be a virgin!” Blaise snorts at this, but Draco keeps going. “And to be quite honest, I think my parents would be the
Malfoy chuckled self satisfactorily. “Oh I’m ‘seeded’ alright.” At Harry’s disbelievingly raised eyebrow he took on a more serious expression. “I would have thought you’d be aware by now, that with the right amount of money, and the knowledge of who to use it on, you can get almost anything you want.”
You don’t talk about anything other than the plants for the rest of the day, but you think that he understands now, that he knows what you can’t explain. You hope he does, as he gives you a tentative smile across the table at supper. You make sure to walk out of the refectory at the same time as he, grabbing his hand and squeezing it quickly before you go to Compline. He’s finally standing beside you again for prayer, and in the general shuffling about afterwards, when everyone leaves, you lean forwards to whisper to him.
Nüwa had stopped listening to Potter’s rambling, she was now fully observing the other man, and suddenly, there it was. She was surprised she hadn’t noticed it before, but somewhere in the back of her mind she must’ve registered that every time Potter spoke to her, there was a tiny shift in the other man’s posture. Like he was…
Of course. Of bloody course. Not only was he supposed to hang around Draco all the time in public and be fondled by him, for show mind you, not for real, but he also had to endure sleeping in the same bed as him, again, just for show. This assignment was turning into a nightmare.
“Yeah you’re right about that,” Harry scoffs. “And I assume that’s why you always want to keep this on your home turf, to be able to set the rules, keep the control. Why don’t you try coming over to mine next time and see how fun it is to have to leave in the middle of the night when you just want to fucking relax?”
The pristine white of the lily of the valley. The hopeful yellow of the narcissus. The innocent pink of the honeysuckle.
Harry stood next to the couch and reached out for Draco’s hand; the remaining clothes dropping as they moved into the bedroom. Draco manhandled Harry down onto the bed, climbing on top and pressing him into the mattress with his body.
“Could be because I put an obliviation spell on the place to make everyone coming here forget what they were looking for,” Malfoy said, appearing in the doorway, with those joggers hanging on his hips. Those joggers that Harry knew the texture of by heart now. Those joggers that Harry had ripped off more times than he could count these last two days since Malfoy had apparated them here after their wrestling match had developed into a kissing match.
And yet, there’s something there. That weird pull they’ve always had towards each other has been growing steadily, and tonight it feels like something needs to happen. Maybe it’s a need to satisfy his curiosity. Harry doesn’t know, and he’s not really sure he wants to find out, but it’s like an itch that he can’t keep from scratching.
Draco can’t sleep. It’s somewhere around midnight, and he’s thoroughly exhausted from the extended time without oxygen and nutrition, and yet his mind feels clear and bright. Perhaps having escaped the claws of death does things to you, he thinks as he flexes his fingers slowly, just because he’s able to. You start to appreciate how easy it is to breathe suddenly, how the blood flows unhindered through your veins, how light your body feels.
Harry’s breath hitched, but he decided not to take the bait, instead snatching his toilet bag from his suitcase and marching into the bathroom. He desperately needed to wash himself off, and if that included a break from Draco, well, all the better.
Harry tried his best to not look at the way Draco’s waist was accentuated by the navy blue double breasted waistcoat he was wearing, or how his breeches drew attention to his crotch area. “What did I do now?”
Harry swallowed, but shrugged in an attempt at casualness. “I couldn’t find my own, and yours smelled really nice.” He firmly closed his mouth to stop himself from adding that he’d thought it smelled like Draco and that he quite liked that.
Draco’s definitely avoiding me. And when he’s not, he’s acting really weird. Like, he’s fidgety and he won’t look at me when he’s talking to me, but I get the feeling that he’s watching me when he thinks I don’t notice.
It was nearing midnight and they were out in a field, surrounded by trees. Despite the late hour and the fact that the sun had set an hour ago, it was still rather light, but there was a chill in the air. Harry noticed Draco shivering a bit, since he had long ago changed into his Muggle linen trousers and cotton shirt (with regular sleeves).
“No,” Draco sighs. He tries to remind himself that while he himself has had time to get used to the idea of his impending death, this is all new to Pansy and she’s still in the “Trying To Fix This” stage. “Because you’d want to know who, and then try to make him love me. And it doesn’t matter because I know he doesn’t and I know he never will.”
” He pointed back and forth in the space between them. “You were the one just lecturing me about what we’re supposed to be doing here. You know, the fucking job we were sent to do?”
Robards growled. “Are we done with the pleasantries now because we are running out of time. Boys, explain yourselves.” A collective sigh went around the room and Harry and Draco began their story.
When Ron and Hermione kept looking at him with their mouths hanging open, he scoffed and turned around, and this time he
Hands on her hips, she watched the two idiots take their places on opposite sides of the circle of runners. If she’d known how much toil it would be to have them both here, she’d never have accepted Blondie’s (Draco!) late application for this training camp. No matter how much extra he’d paid, this simply wasn’t worth it.
“Mr Potter,” Goodwin sighs, “I realise that you were able to intimidate the rest of the staff here yesterday, and I’ll admit that you had a very valid reason for breaking hospital procedures. They probably let you get away with it only because they were certain that Draco wasn’t in any danger. However, I will not be contradicted in my own workplace, not even by the Saviour himself, so if you want what’s best for Draco, a patient under my care I’d like to add, I’d suggest you get up and let me do my work.”
Harry laughed again, deciding not to bring up all the things Draco did that annoyed the living hell out of him.
“You know, I’ve never understood art or cultural stuff like that,” Potter said tentatively. “And especially not Luna’s art, to be honest.”
The door opens and Healer Goodwin peeks around it. When she notices that he’s awake she walks to him in quick but quiet strides, positively beaming at him. But when she looks at Harry lying beside him she rolls her eyes.
When you go to Lauds in the early morning sun, you wish he was well enough to join you. You take all the meals you can by the side of his bed, and talk about his life before he started his pilgrimage, but never touch the subject of what happened for him to set out on it. And you find that you don’t care what he did, that you’re happy fate led him to you, made you able to see him every day. Like a flower, you seek the warmth and light of the sun that is him.
You look around you wildly, trying to see anything through the thick curtain of rain, and then you hear a faint “Draco” coming from a tiny gathering of bushes in front of you. You sprint through the undergrowth and crouch down beside him. He’s sitting on the ground, curled around himself, shivering. You run a hand through his damp hair and he looks at you with wide eyes.
Alex walked around and into Draco’s view, casually leaning on a cabinet. “Yes, darling, it’s me. It’s been far too long. I saw you a few weeks ago at that club, but you were,” he gave Draco a dark look, “Otherwise engaged at the time.”
“But Potter, if you think for even a second that this will give you a free pass to continue your disgusting habits, you are sorely mistaken.”
“Oh, are we trying to be civilised now?” Malfoy said. “I distinctly remember someone failing to do the
“I’m sorry Harry, I just,” she said, but covered her mouth with her hand as she started giggling again. Harry looked at her in utter bewilderment, then at Ron, who had the appearance of someone who was going to be sick.
“Merlin’s fucking ballsack, Draco, it’s not a marriage proposal! I’m just asking to stay the fucking night because sometimes it’s nice not having to sneak off like a thief in the dark, or because it’s nice to just drift off after amazing sex, however bloody
Harry barely heard the jibe about his social life (or lack thereof), he had more pressing matters on his mind. “Are you — Are you going to be wearing those? Those things? I mean, underneath?”
Harry doesn’t look at you, his eyes are still fixed on the swirling water. “You go. I need some time alone.”
Harry chuckles and leans closer to start trailing kisses along Draco’s neck, which makes him arch his back towards Harry.
Draco hummed, squinting with one eye as he pretended to think hard, which had the added benefit of allowing him to look properly at Harry. When he finally spoke, his lips brushed against Harry’s, sending sparks of happiness through him. “Yeah? Well Pansy can fucking wait.”
Harry’s eyes are wild, his lips swollen and shiny, and he’s panting, his chest heaving, and you remember how you used to refrain from playing with the hairs on it when you were taking care of his wounds. It dawns on you that you’ve been wanting to do that ever since, and you reached the end of your rope: you can’t go another minute without touching him.
“Okay, Harry, your coffee’s ready!” Jane calls, snapping Harry out of his musings. “Don’t make me come out and bring it to you, your highness. And also you need to pay.”
“What do you mean? We have to get married or we’re stuck like this. Merlin knows how long it’ll take before Pansy or Granger find another solution to this.”
Harry makes a strangled sound, like a sob slipping out unbidden, and then it happens, the thing you’ve been dreading, the thing you’ve wanted for so long: you lean in, and you kiss him. You kiss him, because you can’t stand not kissing him anymore. You kiss him, and you can’t remember why you haven’t done this before. You kiss him, and it’s all you imagined it to be, and more, because it’s
“Come here.” Draco has that smug smile on his face, the one that only a few months ago would have made Harry furious, but now combined with his hooded eyes, makes Harry even crazier with want.
Harry at least had the grace to look a bit sheepish as he shuffled over to them. Apparently, he’d won a marathon the previous year, but Sheila had never heard of either him or that particular marathon. And apparently, Blondie (Drogo?) was going to compete against him this year, and was obviously doing everything in his power to rile Harry up. Sheila had gathered that they knew each other when they went to school, and that they’d been at each other’s throats back then as well. She’d never heard of the school either, but from what Harry had told her, it sounded like it was some sort of boarding school somewhere in Scotland.
Pansy stands behind him, still in the doorway. It’s the first thing she’s said to him since they left St Mungo’s. She didn’t even tell him off when he was almost run over by a bus and she had to pull him away to save him. Draco closes his eyes, tears stinging behind the lids.
In an effort to clear his mind, and also because he desperately needs to pee, Harry leaves the edge of the dance floor and heads for the loos. Locked inside one of the cubicles he rests his forehead against the tiles (after a perfunctory
“You need to calm down. Your emotions are all over the place. Projecting feelings worse than you did in school like that is going to end the investigation far faster than any argument we’d have.”
I don’t know what’s going on. I think Draco is avoiding me and I don’t know why. This morning when I came into the kitchen to make us breakfast, he was already there, putting his dishes away. I mean it was nice that he made me breakfast as well since it’s usually me who does all the cooking, but instead of sitting with me while I ate it, he went to his room to read or something.
Harry was so scandalized that he didn’t even object as Malfoy bumped his hip so he could get to the sink, but as he watched Malfoy flounce out of the room, he thought they definitely needed to set up some boundaries for this to work.
You give him an encouraging nod and try not to dwell too much on how your heart leaps in your chest at the pleased smile he gives you and how it makes his beautiful eyes light up. He’s well enough to accompany you in the garden, and he’s thoroughly enjoying it. You try to explain away the fluttering in your chest as joy of having a helping hand, of sharing something with him that’s so important to you. But you know, deep down, that if you allowed yourself to think about it, you’d see that it’s more profound than that.
I told him I was so grateful he’s always around to help me, and he said “You know I’d do anything for you, don’t you Harry?” He sounded so sincere, but also nervous, so I sort of got up on one arm
Harry tries to understand, but his mind is reeling. It’s like he’s missing some vital pieces of the puzzle. He looks at the leaves again, the thickness and the roughness of them, the sharp angles. He can’t even imagine how painful it must be to have them come up from the chest through one’s throat.
“Oh shite. The spell works so well.” Draco’s breathy whisper didn’t travel much, but he felt Harry smirk around his shaft. His back arched when Harry gave his dick a long hard suck all the way to the top and let go of the head with a lewd pop.
“If anything, you should be thankful for him,” Harry continues. “He… What we did was the reason I left to expiate my sins by going on a pilgrimage. And if I hadn’t done that I never would have met you.”
Harry groans. He knows he’s pushing too far, but Draco is being fucking ridiculous, and maybe it’s out of habit that Harry has to prod him. “But I could stay the night?”
Blaise’s smirk is instantly wiped off his face. “What? Why do I get to constantly walk in on them like… this?”
“Oh, you mean this?” Malfoy gestured over his bare chest, making Harry, quite involuntarily, look at it again. Malfoy’s grin grew even wider, but then he quickly schooled his features to a look of innocence. “I’m so sorry, Potter, is this distracting to you?”
“Good.” Draco said, “From what I’ve learned this won’t be fun. That potion will counteract most known love potions and spells, I think. I’m sorry, but you’ll have to continue to pretend obviously.”
“Oh,” said Hermione softly in his ear, making him realise how close she was. “I remember these! Never had one myself but I sometimes played on my friend’s.”
“So here is the mugworth foot ointment for your husband, Mrs Baxter. I do apologise for the pungent smell, I’m afraid it’s unavoidable, but if you wrap his feet in cloth it should lessen the foulness a bit.” You smile at the woman in front of you, ignoring how one of her six children is kicking you in the shin. “And here is dried rosemary to put under his pillow to ward off nightmares,” you continue, handing over the tiny bag of dried leaves.
Yeah, no, I can’t write that. I feel like I’m a lovesick thirteen year old girl. Sorry, diary, the greeting has to go. Maybe I could call you something instead? Or I guess I’m writing to myself, so maybe no greeting is needed? I should’ve asked Hermione how one does this.
It’s a beautiful spring day when your life is turned upside down. The March sun is peeking up over the monastery walls, thawing the patches of snow still covering parts of the ground, and you’re in the greenhouse, sowing the early crop of herbs, when the Prior comes looking for you. He tells you a new pilgrim has just arrived, he’s dehydrated and has cuts and injuries that need to be tended to.
“What are you harping on about?” he drawled, idly turning a page and dangling his foot nonchalantly.
Harry laughs softly, shaking his head in disbelief. “I don’t know. I couldn’t fall asleep tonight, something kept me up. And then I heard you. As if your voice was magnified, because when I went out to look for you you were quite far away.”
He doesn’t bother putting on his coat when he leaves, only picks it up in a bundle and trots through Harry’s door. And if Harry spends the next ten minutes dealing with his frustration by slamming his fist against the wall until his knuckles are sore? Well, no one needs to hear about that, since he’s worked exceedingly well on his silencing charms.
You used to think that the Heavenly Father is the only one who really sees you, the only one who loves you. But thinking about Harry fills you with warmth, and you realise he’s the only one on this earth who knows you inside and out and still wants to be with you.
It was as if there was a collective intake of breath before the entire room went still, and it felt as if every eye had turned to Draco. While every atom of Draco’s body was focused on Potter and his reaction, his eyes were locked with Pansy’s. He thought he could see the tiniest flicker of remorse, of insecurity in them, but it did nothing to ease the betrayal. How fucking could she?
“I’m very happy that you like your present so much, but trust me, Harry,” Draco murmured into his ear, “there won’t be time for any video games when I get you alone.”
“N-nothing, it’s just.. your eyes look ever greener without the glasses, or maybe it’s because you’re so close. I mean— ”
“Yes, well, if you had more friends, you could throw a fun party as well.” Malfoy turned yet another page, even though Harry was convinced he wasn’t even reading.
“See, that’s the odd thing about this. Usually there’s a quicker process with this disease, it develops inside your body about one or two months before the flowers start to come out, but once they do start to come, they do so more and more often, much faster than what you’ve been telling us. Which often means that the roots are shallow.”
Finally, they were all sitting in the lotus position, palms together and their instructor bowed them off with a Namaste. Harry turned to Malfoy with a serene smile firmly in place.
Things really start to go to shit after Potter’s rejection. Draco feels like he’s been thrown off a cliff, free falling towards the inevitable end. Thoughts about how people will react keep coming, along with shame when he thinks about what they’ll say about him for being this weak.
to the imagination. And he couldn’t very well look at the expanse of smooth, pale skin that seemed so inviting, like it was practically calling Harry to come and feel it, taste it.
on you, and remember how last time it was a little bit too strong and half of you ended up not being able to take your oral exam the lesson after?”
“Hmmm… I did book this cabin to be able to impress a potential conquest, but… I guess desperate times call for desperate measures.”
Harry let Draco order for him, hand flexing under his as he squeezed it in front of the waiter, a flashy smile and cheesy line thrown for cover. He ignored the worried glances from Draco and took stock of their surroundings.
Harry took the opportunity to continue searching for his wand, and after he located it, he started summoning his clothes.
Harry blinks, unsure what to say. “Sorry, but I don’t think… That’s not what he wants from me,” he says, lowering his voice.
There are too many emotions chasing around inside him: fear for Draco, horror at the way he’ll perish, suffocated by flowers. But most prevalently, there’s an undercurrent of loss, betrayal. Because now he knows, with no uncertainty, that Draco actually does love. It’s just that he doesn’t do it with Harry. Because if he did, he wouldn’t be dying from unrequited love, since Harry somehow, somewhere along the line, has developed feelings for him. No, Draco is in love with someone else, so much so that it chokes him, quite literally.
And yet, there’s the problem of what he did, what he and that other man did. You can’t stop thinking about it, thinking about a faceless man with his lips to Harry’s, his hands in Harry’s hair, their bodies pressed tightly together. You try to block out the mental image by praying, by working harder than strictly necessary out in the garden, digging up the dirt until your hands are blistered and your back hurts, and still, when you go to bed at night, you see it again. And again. And
And yet, when you think about it, it strikes you as strange how quickly the weather changed, just when you were asking the Lord for a sign.
“Informal? You mean I’m failing to follow the appropriate dress code for being recently out of the shower?”
“Partly. It’s—You should know these things as well, Weasley! In the olden days you weren’t supposed to…
When Hermione returns, she has a thick book in her arms, already opened and she’s flipping through the pages as she walks.
). Draco’s hands around his wrists, pinning him to the bed while he fucks him in deep, quick strokes, Harry’s back arching of its own will to get a better angle, Draco’s stuttering hips as he’s nearing his orgasm, his whispers turning into incoherent moans as he comes deep inside Harry, and there’s the ever present heat, heat,
He exhales shakily, kissing you slowly, tenderly. “Wait here,” he says, rising from the bed and walking over to the table to get something. You stay on the bed, missing the warmth of his body but enjoying the view he offers you. When he returns he’s holding a little bottle of oil.
Hermione’s eyes flick to Ron and back to Harry. They obviously don't believe him, but they let him be.
“What's he going to do? Beat up the Savior of the Wizarding world? Uhn, stop that, it tickles.” Harry still had his mouth next to Draco’s ear, puffing warm breaths against it every time he spoke. Harry chuckled and backed away just enough to keep an eye on Draco’s ex, who seemed to still be watching them very intently with a tight grip on his pint. Harry barely registered the whine that left Draco’s lips before he gripped the back of his head and brought him in for a kiss. Draco squeaked and gripped Harry’s shoulders in surprise before giving in and melting into the touch. The kiss deepened, tongues intertwined and the ex was forgotten; at least until they heard a crash and broke apart to see where it came from. They watched the ex throw a couple of coins on the bar and stalk off. They turned towards each other and the tension ratcheted up instantly. Harry blushed and Draco huffed out an awkward laugh.
The rest of the session went by in this fashion, with Harry trying his best to accentuate his arse and chest, as well as “accidentally” brush Malfoy’s skin when he was reaching his arms out. Every time, Malfoy would flinch almost imperceptibly, and try to move away from Harry, but their mats were so close together that it was hard to do so without making too much of a fuss.
Pansy, Luna and Granger were all quick to agree. A little too quick in Draco’s opinion. He narrowed his eyes at Pansy, who still refused to look at him. Thomas and Finnigan shrugged but nodded and sat down. Potter, however, frowned at Ginny.
Sheila watched with eyebrows drawn down as the group left, bags slung over their shoulders. Harry and Draco were jostling each other as they went and she was happy to see the back of them. Thank goodness this week was finally coming to an end, she couldn’t stand a minute longer in the presence of those damn idiots and their fucking bullshit.
You dress in silence, everything so raw and fragile between you. You don’t know what to tell him. You don’t even know what to tell yourself.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Draco thought that Harry had just rejected him. Which meant that… he’d been serious with that cheesy come on.
The words fall from his mouth without him planning to, like they've been hiding in there and taken the opportunity to slink out when Harry’s defences were down. Draco freezes and his eyes widen, and Harry realises his slip, that he’s crossed the line.
Much like the tracking spells the Ministry set on his family some time ago, this one created a hazy image of where the subject might be, as well as highlighting the route that they took. On several prior cases, Draco recalled trainees being divided into two teams—one to follow the detectives directly to where the suspect was, another to collect evidence surrounding the case. Circe did Draco miss the days where he actually
“You were being driven up the wall by Professor Potter,” a boy said behind his hand and the class dissolved once more.
“Correct. I remember Mother told me years ago, when I started seeing my first boyfriend. I waved it off as an attempt to try to scare me, but… I guess I’ve always had that thought in the back of my head and I’ve… taken measures to avoid it happening.”
And apparently, that’s all it takes for Draco to actually lose control, to let instinct take over, and with a growl he starts pounding into Harry mercilessly, his cock slamming into him again and again, and Harry wraps his legs around Draco’s hips to free his hands, letting them slide down to Draco’s arse to spur him on, get him in deeper. His head hits the headboard with the force of Draco’s thrusts but he doesn’t care, it’s too good to care about such mundane things, Harry could get a concussion for all he cares, as long as gets to have Draco fuck him like this, with this raw yet tender passion.
There, that was better, making them invested by including them in conversation. Good one, Draco. A few hands were already raised, and he pointed to a girl in the front left. “Yes, let’s start with you,” he said with a more genuine smile, “miss…?”
I decided to owl Hermione and she agreed to meet with me and take a walk and talk about things. I hope she can help me sort this out.
Draco turned to Harry “I sent the message to my contact that we’d arrived, but I didn’t think it would be so soon. Are you ready?”
There was a collective snickering all around the classroom, and beside Draco, Harry gave short surprised snort. Draco stared at the girl, who smiled back at him with an air of serenity. “I’m… sorry?” he stuttered, completely taken aback.
If he could, he would cry right now, but apparently the plants inside him are using the tears as nutrition, so nothing comes out, and there’s an increasing pressure around his lungs, the stems thickening and squeezing hard. His vision starts to go blurry, there’s a high pitched sound in his ears almost blocking out Pansy’s panicked voice calling his name, until suddenly, everything goes eerily quiet as he realises that this will be over soon.
And without any further word, he leaves you crouching on the ground, your head spinning with everything he just told you.
You wave her off. “No problem, Mrs Baxter, there’s no payment needed. I hope you’ll get some sleep.”
His vision turns blurry as he dry heaves for the second time, his entire body shaking with the effort of breathing, of coughing, of gasping for air. Sweat starts to break out on his forehead, and then his body convulses again as the content of his lungs spills out from his mouth into the clean basin. Gossamer white leaves, their veining a deep red, resembling thin blood vessels running criss crossed over the surface.
The praise goes straight to Harry’s cock and he whimpers as Draco continues to quickly but thoroughly work him open with fingers and tongue. It feels so good, Harry is so unbelievably turned on and he starts rocking back to meet Draco as he’s pumping his fingers into him.
“Well, I don’t want to intrude, and if you’re not comfortable having me here for longer than necessary I don’t want to force you.”
Pansy turns to him. “I’ve managed to Floo call Narcissa and she’s on her way, but it’ll take her a while to arrange for an international Portkey.”
“Ginny!” he shouted, dropping everything and running towards her, lifting her up and spinning her around. Draco’s heart fell. She shrieked with laughter, but when she noticed how Draco was staring at them, she whispered something to Potter and he set her down, blushing slightly.
I started looking through my photographs today but I almost fell asleep just thinking about sorting through them. Anyway, this lockdown seems to be going on for quite some time so I’ll have the opportunity later.
Harry felt heat creeping up his neck, as usual when he was scrutinised by Draco. He cleared his throat.
The truth was, Potter was the reason Draco had stayed for so long. He knew it was futile, knew that Potter was already taken, but looking had never hurt anyone, had it? Not that it would help him get over his stupid crush that he’d harboured since at least their eighth year at Hogwarts, but it wasn’t as if he had any other options. And he needed to be a good friend to Pansy. And if being a good friend included being around Potter a lot more, well, that was just an inevitability.
Malfoy sauntered up to Harry, and Harry almost dropped the orange he was trying to squeeze juice from as Malfoy came to stand not even an inch from him, his body heat radiating towards Harry.
But flexing and extending his fingers has become some sort of strangely comforting habit. And right now he’s face to face with a vase on the coffee table in front of him. A vase filled with red carnations. Fucking red carnations. They’re almost the exact shade as the one he spewed out this morning, except that these are clean. The fucking irony. It feels like they’re staring at him, and it makes the itching in his wrists more profound.
Anyway, Draco cleaned up the mess I had made and I managed to finish making the food, so we got to have lunch, even though the prospects of it seemed doomed there for a while.
(Also apparently he and Astoria weren’t about to get back together, he was talking to her so much because he needed to talk to someone about me. Go figure. I was jealous of someone without reason to be.)
Draco shivered and turned his head so that his nose was brushing Harry’s, his breath ghosting over Harry’s face as he spoke. “I never behave like a prick, you take that back, Potter.”
“Well, I had to bribe Healer Merriweather by taking all her night shifts for a month, but at least I managed to get here,” said Draco as he stepped inside, impeccably dressed as ever. “Please tell me I haven’t missed the cake.” He paused in front of the doorway, looking around the room, all eyes turned on him. “What? What happened? Is there something on my shirt?” He started patting himself all over, looking for a non-existing stain.
Harry ends up staying for hours, sitting bent over on that uncomfortable chair and talking, talking, talking. Pansy sticks her head in occasionally, but Draco just waves her off, which makes her give him very stern looks, which in turn only prompts him to glower at her, all of it making Harry very confused. Harry’s voice becomes hoarse as they switch from sarcastic barbs to topics deep as trenches, and Draco only has the energy to whisper from time to time, his voice brittle and dry. And it’s both comforting and heartbreaking, getting to know each other for real. It’s the first time they’ve bothered to really talk about themselves, and it’s so ironic that Draco lying on his deathbed is what made them drop their masks. For the first time Harry realises how much he’ll lose and what he could’ve had if just one thing in this mess was different.
“There’s no need to take that tone with me, Draco. I’m here to help. But if you’d rather have Potter stuck inside you forever…”
Harry props himself up on one elbow, and you open your eyes to look at him. He’s so unfairly beautiful in the scarce morning light, with his wild hair and deeply green eyes. You bite your lip to keep from kissing him, and his eyes drop to your mouth.
“Are the two of you quite done philosophising over the English language? We do have a situation here.”
“I think this could be good motivation to keep me on the right track,” Harry said, shifting on the bed to let Draco know he was ready for another round. “And if I fail, I give you the right to punish me as you see fit.”
Defeated, you collapse on the ground, your legs unable to carry you anymore. So this is the end, then, you think as you slowly push yourself up to a sitting position. This is how you will meet your destiny: leaving your old life behind, seeking out a new truth, a new path, but without being reunited with Harry. It hurts more than you can admit even to yourself that he’ll never know you tried to come for him, that he was worth more to you than any reward in heaven. You draw your knees up to your chin as  tears start spilling from your eyes, a loud sob escaping you.
It’s not fair, he thinks. It’s not fair that he survived having Lord fucking Voldemort living in his home, that he survived defying him, survived a room filled with Fiendfyre that killed one of his friends, survived the final battle of Hogwarts, and now
Harry hisses in pleasure as Draco strokes a hand over his bulge, cupping him through his trousers. Then his knees give way as they hit one of his armchairs, and he falls down on it, his head thumping back against the headrest. Draco smirks at him, his bottom lip disappearing between his teeth, and then he kneels, letting himself be bracketed by Harry’s spread legs. Nimble hands work Harry’s flies open and then pull his trousers and pants down in one swift motion, making his cock spring free and bounce on his stomach. Draco looks at it, head tilted, his eyes bright and assessive, and Harry wants to squirm under the scrutiny, but Draco’s gaze feels like a warm beam, making him feel… safe. Seen. And incredibly aroused.
Harry slumped. “Yeah. Yeah I know. Gross,” he mumbled. He distinctly thought that Hermione was looking at him, but when he glanced over at her, she seemed to be deep in concentration with her notes.
It’s raining the day that Harry leaves. You’re both huddling under one of the archways, away from prying eyes. It’s not big enough to give you both complete shelter, and your salty tears blend with the water dripping down in your hair, sliding along your cheek.
Ron and Hermione had dropped increasingly unsubtle hints about how they wanted to have some more privacy, now that they wanted to start a family, and when Pansy had moved in with Ginny, leaving an empty room for Harry to live in, it had only seemed like the right thing to do. Also, he was tired of walking in on them in various compromising situations, so the prospect of living with Malfoy had seemed more agreeable than having to see Ron’s naked arse for the umpteenth time when he got home from Healer Training.
He gets up, his legs rigid when he tries to extend them. He can almost hear something snap inside them, like thin twigs bent the wrong way.
It was quiet in the room for a long time and Draco didn’t have the nerve to turn around and see what Harry was doing if he had somehow worked himself up again. Draco didn’t know how he’d be able to reign in Harry’s anger, and a part of him wished he didn’t have to. Harry was right. But being right wouldn’t bring all the victims justice.
“Sorry,” he says after collecting himself a bit, ”you said there was a high risk of not surviving the procedure? How high?”
Harry tasted his chanterelle risotto with a groan of satisfaction. He loved to experiment while cooking, and this time he had added finely chopped celery along with the onions early in the process, and it had really elevated the flavour. That, and the healthy splash of white wine and the ridiculous amount of grated parmesan cheese he had added.
When he steps out onto the pavement the air is crisp and he inhales deeply, closing his eyes. He’ll be fine, he thinks, turning his face upwards. He’ll get over this, he always does, one way or the other. The only thing gnawing on him is Draco and his illness, and he wishes that he was able to do something to help him. He should try to find out who it is that Draco loves and bring them to him, make them see what their ignorance is doing to him.
Goodwin stares at him for a moment before she turns to Draco with a look that clearly says “really?”, but he just shrugs one shoulder unapologetically. He wants to snort at Harry for being so ridiculous, but apparently, life changing events such as almost dying has had some effect on him and he only finds it incredibly endearing.
He doesn’t speak to anyone about it, but deep down he knows what’s wrong. When he was a child he heard stories about the Hanahaki Disease, but the tales were so old and seemed so unrealistic that he always regarded them as myths. However, it all adds up, and as much as he wants to deny it, he realises what’s growing inside him and why, and he knows how it’s going to end if he doesn’t get the cure. But as long as he doesn’t say it out loud, as long as he doesn’t seek help for it, a part of him (a very,
“Better. Not entirely back to normal but it’s nice to be able to draw deep breaths without having something blocking it. Or spewing petals everywhere.”
“Fuck work, I’m sleepy,” Potter mumbles, his lips tickling Draco’s chest. “I’m so comfortable here.”
In the few weeks that Harry is under your care, you realise you’ve come to appreciate his company more and more. There’s something about him that speaks to you, and he feels more like an equal than any of the other inhabitants of this monastery, even though you’ve known them for much longer than you’ve known him. Even when you both disagree on something, you feel a connection to him, as if he understands you on a far more profound level than anyone has ever understood you, and you soon notice a constant longing to be near him.
in the direction of Malfoy’s ensuite bathroom. “They’re still looking for us, and no one has thought about coming here to search.”
Harry flops down, the sheets cool against his back. Draco positions himself between his legs, silently studying him, like he’s planning exactly how to take him apart, and Harry can’t wait. Draco reaches his arms out, his fingers grazing the sides of Harry’s arse cheeks, feather light and almost tickling. Then, he trails them along the back of Harry’s thighs, resting them on the backs of his knees, pressing his index and middle fingers up in a silent command. Breath held, Harry obliges, lifting his knees to hook either hand under them, spreading himself open under Draco’s approving gaze, waiting, wanting. But nothing happens, and Harry’s is just about to tell Draco to get on with it when there's that same light touch along the curve of his calves, down to his heels and back up. He looks at Draco and is surprised at the smile he gets.
“So cabbage pottage for supper today? Are you very hungry, or do you think it could wait?” Harry asks, leaving tiny kisses along your neck.
Dinner was nice, but the amount of raw fish made Harry shudder slightly. He quickly decided to stick to the food that their hosts called “the kid’s menu”, with Swedish meatballs and tiny sausages called “prince sausage” for some reason. Draco, however, was really enjoying all the food, especially the cinnamon and clove pickled herring served with sour cream and chopped chives.
“Gentlemen!” she barked out, pleased that she managed to pronounce the word so it sounded like the reprimand it was. Both men turned towards her, looking like they had only just now realised that she and the rest of the group were there. The dark haired one, Harry, blushed faintly, while the blond one with the odd name (Dragan?) merely raised an eyebrow at her, the absolute tosser. “Will the two of you please stop fucking about and come and join us?”
“Well, obviously you didn’t learn anything, because it’s happening again, isn’t it?” you say, surprised to feel tears prickling in your eyes.
So he still refuses to tell anyone. He avoids meeting his friends during the day, opting for the more dimly lit pubs and nightclubs they frequent. He evades their concerned questions about his health with white lies about how he barely sleeps because he’s so busy with work and having fun, and that must be why he’s so pale. The thing is, he’s exhausted because he needs to get up so early every morning since everything takes so much longer. Because not only does he have to account for throwing up flowers all the time, they seem to be taking their energy from his magical core, and he’s noticing how even the simplest spells are harder for him to perform.
, from the base and slowly up to the tip. I mean I’ve never done it before so I tried to do it like I like someone doing it on me, and then I tried to just… follow Draco’s reactions and do the things he seemed most enthusiastic about (which was honestly almost everything I did).
He finally managed to get all the tape off and unwrapped the gift slowly. The sight of the box made him let out a gush of air, unable to believe that this was really real. Had Draco actually bought him—?
He wipes his mouth, the blood smearing his cheek, but he doesn’t bother to wash it off or clean his hands, because suddenly he has a strong urge to get out. There’s not enough air, not enough room, and he feels the fear seeping into every fibre of him. He needs help.
Harry squeezes his hand placed on Draco’s thigh and brushes his lips to Draco’s forehead. “I am too.”
think that it was something more than just friendly touching. I mean I know he’s straight. And I know he’s probably going to get back with Astoria once we’re clear to go outside freely again.
“Yeah. Apparently, the ship is overbooked, and they don’t have any extra space or extra beds anywhere.”
The restaurant was slowly filling as per the schedule they’d seen over the last few days. One couple would make their way in and chat loudly, enjoying the privacy of an empty restaurant for as long as possible. Then a few more would come in, some bathers from the pool heading directly for the bar attached to the outside veranda, shielding them from the blast of the air conditioning. More would flow in and out in a variety of ways that made Harry’s head hurt from trying to keep tabs on everyone. His neck would send him to St. Mungo’s after this for sure.
Your press yourself nearer to him, whispering his name. He looks at you with foggy eyes, pupils blown wide with lust. And yet you can’t look at him as the words tumble out of you in a rush.
, Draco thinks for a split second before he stomps that thought out of his mind. That’s not what they have, he does
He threw Draco off and turned on him, hand thrown out angrily. “We don’t know how deep this goes. They could be doing anything tonight, they could be moving them—we need—
“At least the company was good,” Potter murmured, and now he was coming nearer, his breath ghosting over Draco’s cheek.
She lets go of him and turns to lean back against the chair, slumping a bit. “Okay, fine, be like that. I just wish you would’ve told me sooner so they could’ve operated on you.”
He stops and looks at you, the green leaves around you reflecting in his eyes and making them look more intense, more innocent. “For what?”
A week later, Harry was once again sitting on the sofa studying, pretending not to be aware of Malfoy being in the shower. The only reason he was sitting here was because it was more comfortable than sitting on his bed, and anyway, he had just sort of ended up here when he got home and noticed the bathroom was occupied.
“I may not be your direct supervisor, but I am in charge of this investigation. Watch your language.”
Wordlessly, Draco bends over, leaning in closer to kiss the inside of Harry’s thighs, from his knee and then slowly up towards his crotch, dragging his bottom lip over the sensitive skin. Harry lets his head fall back with a sigh, his hand coming to tangle in Draco’s hair, letting it glide between his fingers. A moment ago he felt impatient, but now, he feels entirely content, relaxed, enjoying Draco taking his time with him. He had no idea this was what he needed when he decided to go to the café, but it seems like Draco did, like he instinctively knew that Harry needed to be taken care of, to just sit back and relax and have Draco work his magic on him.
“Right. Well, I guess there’s nothing more to say except a warm welcome to Mr Malfoy,” Harry said, taking a seat behind his desk and sending Draco an encouraging nod and a wink.
Potter had come closer than Draco had anticipated, and even though he spoke softly it made Draco jump, almost losing his balance. He flung out his arm to steady himself, and it landed on Potter’s shoulder.
Potter rolls his eyes at him, sighing. “You know what I mean, don’t make such a big deal out of it.”
Harry’s known for quite some time that he’s bisexual, but as it turns out, dating in general, and exploring your sexuality in particular, isn’t the easiest to do when you’re extremely famous. He’d had to resort to casual hook ups with men at Muggle bars, which admittedly had helped him find out that he really does enjoy sex with men as well, but left him feeling empty afterwards, craving more, something deeper, more meaningful. But Draco is his first
Harry sits in Ron and Hermione’s kitchen. Ron is standing by the sink peeling potatoes and Hermione’s trying to put a bib onto a struggling Rose, sitting in her high chair.
Harry gulped down the water, “NO! I’m not okay!” Harry shouted, launching Draco magically away from him. “Innocent people are being forced into unwanted bonds here!” Draco held up his hands in an obvious show of submission, waiting for Harry to calm down.
“I’m happy to hear it,” she says, and she sounds like she genuinely cares. But her gentle face turns serious as she goes on. “We’ve also analysed the contents of your lungs, and… I’m very sorry to say, but… the Hanahaki Disease is obviously in its final stages. Some of the flowers we see now are asters and orpines. Autumn flowers. Which is a sign that there’s not much time left.”
“Strutty, your ostrich?” Harry asked, remembering he was still basically naked when Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow and Neville gave him an amused smile even though he was clearly distressed by his pet’s disappearance. “I, er… Draco, do you have something I could…?”
“I…” Harry halts, closing his eyes again. It’s hard for him to state what he wants, to be so open with someone, to ask for something just for his own pleasure. But he’s thought about this a lot lately and he’s more than ready, and during the time they’ve been together Draco hasn’t made him feel anything but safe, seen, taken care of. He swallows.
“Alright settle down, Potter. You do realize we have to act like a married couple at the retreat, right?” Harry’s laughter petered out and he sat down heavily at his desk while Draco perched on the corner. “You don’t think we can do it?”
And this has continued throughout the day. When I suggested we watch One Tree Hill, he said he didn’t feel like it, and he went to clean the bathroom. He only cleans the bathroom when he’s upset about something. Which is, well it’s not surprising considering the times we live in, with an extremely contagious disease wreaking havoc, and people dying throughout the wizarding world from an enemy we don’t know how to fight. I just wish he’d talk to me about it, we
Potter looks both relieved and morose when he finally meets Draco’s gaze, and Draco will never know how a rejection can be so casual, when Potter apparently knows what the outcome is. There’s no remorse in Potter’s voice, only pity, and Draco realises this is what he’d been expecting if he ever were to let Potter close. This is exactly why he’s kept his distance, this is exactly why he doesn’t do feelings, and then his cursed body had to go and betray him like this.
It feels strange to have Potter in his home without there being some sort of agreement beforehand on what they’re about to do. They usually come here in an urgent frenzy, practically wrestling their clothes off, or after a late night Floo call or owl. And on the few occasions that Potter has showed up unannounced, he’s always had that sly crooked smile that has let Draco know exactly what he’s come for. But this time, Potter just steps in and carefully closes the door, keeping his distance, avoiding eye contact.
Harry nods, swallowing thickly, and watches his own hands as they slide underneath Draco’s unbuttoned shirt, pulling it apart to reveal the silky white top with ruby red roses on it. He lets out a rush of air at the sight, at Draco’s pale skin still in sharp contrast to the pearly white of the top, his chest heaving with each deliberate breath. Slowly, Harry rubs his hands along Draco’s sides, his thumbs gliding over the fabric of Draco’s lingerie top to brush over his nipples, smiling in delight as they both turn into hardened buds at his ministrations.
Oh I forgot to write that the first sourdough base went bad so I started a new one. It’ll be ready to bake with tomorrow and I’m pretty excited about it.
Draco shook his head. “Can you imagine?” he said through bursts of laughter, “Can you imagine Robards face when we tell him what happened?”
“Hello everyone. My name is Mr Malfoy, and as Har— Professor Potter told you, I’m here today to tell you about what it’s like working as a Mindhealer,” he started, inwardly cursing himself for only repeating what Harry had said. They must be bored out of their minds already. “I thought I’d tell you how I came into this line of work, but first I’d like to ask if any of you know what a Mindhealer does?”
There was a rustling and bustling as over twenty students chattered away, whispering to each other and casting not-so-subtle glances at Draco, neither of them paying any attention to their professor who stood in front of his desk.
Draco was standing in front of him again, and this time both of his arms were on Harry, holding onto him firmly.
He shakes himself off with a sigh and goes to wash his hands with water so cold it’s almost painful. There’s no use in trying to figure out these kinds of things now, he decides, not in a crowded nightclub and with alcohol fogging his mind. Better to let it all rest. He should probably go home.
“I’m sure you know why I wanted to see you, Brother Draco,” he says, folding his hands carefully in his lap.
hand around my cock, that was… different. In a good way, I think. His was a bit longer than mine but mine is bigger in girth I think.
But he doesn’t push in immediately like Harry thinks he will. Instead he takes a long time preparing Harry, kissing around his rim, teasing him with tiny flicks of his tongue until Harry is a babbling mess of need, begging for Draco to please please
Draco’s looking at himself pumping inside Harry, trembling, and Harry realises he’s still restraining himself to make it easier on Harry, but he doesn’t want him to hold back, and he wants him nearer, so he brings one foot to nudge Draco’s arse.
Then Draco finally pulls away and pushes Harry down onto his bed, and when Harry looks up at him, his breath leaves him in a rush at the sight. Draco’s eyes are a stormy grey, there’s no mistaking his arousal, his want for Harry.
“Don’t give me that speech on how I’m worthy of love despite my efforts, it’s not what I need right now.”
“‘The weasel’ is here because Harry sent his patronus to Hermione, but since she’s too heavily pregnant and has too severe pelvic girdle pain to be moving around, she sent me here to take notes,” Ron says matter-of-factly. “So you could say that I’m here to try to literally save your arse.”
Harry notices with satisfaction how Draco tries but fails to suppress a shaky exhale, shivering under Harry'sf palm.
Harry doesn't return for several hours, and you have to prepare the flowers for drying by yourself, the usually so comforting task of monotony now just feeling tiresome. You’re in the church for Vespers when the door opens and he shuffles in, his head bowed. He doesn’t look at you when you try to catch his eye.
But it’s nice that he can hang out with his ex like that, kind of like I can with Ginny. It seems like Draco and Astoria have had more interaction during this lockdown than me and Ginny though. Probably because Astoria lives alone and Ginny lives with Luna, but still.
I had to do an interview today. Fuck I hate being this person. I know that if I say something it’ll give people comfort, somehow. But I just want to be regular Harry, going about my business by myself, unnoticed, without the press or admirers hounding me.
Something painful twinges in his chest, and if he had the courage right now, he’d dare to examine this closer, he’d acknowledge that he’s felt this pain on several other occasions. But he doesn’t want to look deeper, he wants to shut his eyes and cover his ears and concentrate on hoping with all he’s got that this is not what he suspects it is.
“Do you know how many times I wished that I could shut you up like this at school?” he’d murmured before he’d crashed their lips together again.
Goodwin nods again, checking that the Dicta-Quill gets it all down. “That would be the plants leaving your system. You might experience some more of it, but it will lessen soon if that’s the case.” She smiles gently at him. “How about your joints?”
Draco sighed exaggeratedly and cast a cushioning charm for Potter’s bum. He was rewarded with an endearing little squeak, followed by a soft laugh. Draco kept his gaze out over the water, but in his mind’s eye he could vividly see the way Potter looked anyway: unruly hair falling into his face, bottom lip caught between his teeth in uncertainty. Draco sighed again.
Suddenly that subtle stirring feeling inside Draco’s chest turns into a sharp stab of pain, like something sick is taking root, and he has to gasp. He clears his throat, putting a hand over his sternum, and the pain subsides to a dull ache, but still lingers ominously.
“Yeah,” Draco whispers, staring unseeingly in front of him and barely wincing when there’s a twang of pain in his chest as another plant takes root. “See you around, Potter.”
He washed his face and began to dress for dinner. If he happened to pick out his most alluring trousers and the jumper he always caught Draco staring at him in, he didn’t think about why.
You stare at him blankly, your mind whirring in every direction at once, but you can’t seem to gather your thoughts properly.
“Oh, forgive me, Potter,” he said, with the same familiar surprised tone as he’d used everytime he uttered those words, “is this place taken?”
“Well, the other week I woke up in the night and I realised it was because… there were… sounds.” He felt his face heat at the memory of that particular night. He’d tried to block it out by pressing his pillow against his ears but Malfoy was really
Slowly, oh so slowly, he pulls himself out a bit before he rocks back into you, and the feeling is too much, not enough, the best sensation you’ve ever had, and it makes you throw your head back as you draw a sharp breath.
A few days prior, Draco had been provided potions by the wizards running the bonding program. Apparently, he was supposed to slip them to his  “future partner” to make them amenable to coming to the retreat. Everything about this was repulsive, and yet, his traitorous body reacted to the act he and Harry were playing.
Draco hummed, snuggling in close and preening like a cat at Harry’s fingertips on his back. “Can’t say I would, but consider yourself lucky I was willing to try this despite your abominable hygiene.
“Well well, aren’t you the cunning Slytherin?” Harry said, folding the paper and setting it aside and uncrossing his legs. He noticed how Malfoy’s gaze followed the action, noticed his eyes widening at the sight of Harry’s erection. Harry smirked and got off the bed, walking up to Malfoy and standing so close that he could feel the hairs of Malfoy’s chest brushing his own, without touching his skin. “Now, do you want to show me you have some stamina? Will you be able to hold out longer than me?” he murmured, leaning close to Malfoy’s ear.
“I wasn’t aware that we were exclusively casual, but I’m fine with that if you want us to be. I mean, Daphne is alright, but there are some things she lacks, anatomically speaking,” Harry says, swirling his tongue around Draco’s cock again. He deliberately leaves out how having sex with Daphne couldn’t compare to having sex with Draco in a million years, that she didn’t leave him entirely breathless like Draco does. He doesn’t need to be more smug than he already is.
“Well well, Potter. Enjoying the view?” Malfoy said, taking a swig from his bottle before he tipped his head back and poured some of the water over his face. He raked through his hair with one hand, his bicep and deltoid flexing, and was it really Harry’s fault that he couldn’t stop staring? A nice body was a nice body, even if it happened to belong to one of magical Britain’s most obnoxious people.
The flat is quiet, but Draco is usually home at this time, so Harry wastes no time in kicking off his shoes and trotting in. He’s painfully hard, has been for at least half an hour now. Or, if he’s truly honest, all day. It didn’t even help that he had a desperate wank after lunch, because five minutes later he was hard again, only able to think about Draco wearing those pants with the matching top, and he’s been entirely unfit to concentrate on anything any of his teachers or classmates have said to him all day. He was supposed to participate in a group assignment but he had to feign nausea so he could finally go home. Never in a million years would he have thought that he’d be crazy about Draco fucking Malfoy, but here he is, unable to stop thinking about the git and what he has planned to do.
, Ronald, since we’re talking about the gayest wizard in the entirety of Britain, and his boyfriend. It’s an expression.”
So, it’s been a few days since I wrote. I’ve been… busy, sort of. I can hardly write this without grinning like a loon, but I’ll try to describe it from the beginning.
He knows he should’ve, knows he’s hurt her by not being honest, because they usually tell each other everything. Or, well, almost everything. She still doesn’t know about him and Potter and their agreement. At least he doesn’t think she does.
You know he’s teasing, but you cringe at his words, sharp like needles against you. His face softens when he notices your reaction, even though he’s taken off his glasses, and he steps closer, and you can see that his eyes have gone a little wider, his breathing a little shallower. You swallow, but you don’t break the eye contact, and neither does he. He steps closer still, reaching out a hand, and you hold your breath. He’s so close that you can see all the tiny details of his face: the fine lines around his eyes, the flecks of gold in his green eyes, framed by thick dark lashes. Your entire body is tense like a harp string, and you’re entranced by those eyes, his presence, the sound of the rain against the roof. He’s still looking at you as he opens your belt and drops it on the floor. He’s still looking at you as he grabs the hem of your tunic, and he doesn’t even need to ask you, you lift your arms in invitation, helping him drag your clothes over your head. He’s still looking at you when you’re finally standing in front of him, as naked as the day you were born, shivering slightly in the damp air that isn’t fully heated by the fire yet.
I asked him if he wanted to sing that song he played me that one time, or maybe something else, but he just mumbled something about the book club and left.
would be too quick and merciful a way to murder someone in her opinion. But before she’s able to retort, or commit manslaughter, Draco interrupts them.
“Why is the weasel here?” Draco drawls, and even though Harry can’t see his face he knows he’s got that extremely haughty expression only he can muster.
Malfoy gave him an arched eyebrow in answer, shaking his cock a little before he reached over to take a wad of toilet paper. “What the fuck does it look like I’m doing?”
“Draco!” Pansy calls after him, but he ignores her as he stumbles towards her bathroom and locks the door, squinting against the shining clean tiles. Panting, he clutches the basin and tries to breathe through the pain as best he can.
Draco’s present!” With a spark of satisfaction he heard Blaise mutter “Ow!” when the box undoubtedly smacked into his head as it zoomed towards Harry’s outstretched hand.
He looks to be about your own age, and his handsome features do not escape you. Neither does how untamed his hair looks, wild and unruly, in sharp contrast to your own sleek straight strands, and you get a sudden urge to run your hands through it, but refrain. You have more important things to do, and it would look highly suspicious for you to perform such an act.
Draco mentioned at one of those midnight tea parties of ours that it was the same way with Astoria. I don’t think that’s why they broke up (same as it wasn’t the reason Ginny and I broke up), but it was wearing on him that she knew some of it but couldn’t
The tiles of Pansy’s bathroom are too fucking clean. They’re shining impossibly bright, hurting his eyes and practically blinding him. Really, when did she become such a cleaning maniac, Draco thinks as he clutches the sink so forcefully that his knuckles go white.
In her own humble opinion, she was a very intelligent snake, and even though she couldn’t understand those gibberish sounds the humans used to communicate with each other, she had gathered enough information by lying pressed to the wall of her terrarium, observing the activities in the warehouse (well, at least as long as Medusa didn’t hog the best spot like she was wont to do, simply because that particular expanse of the glass was apparently “the most comfortable”).
“Am I wrong to guess that you gave away remedies for free again?” he murmurs, letting his lips slide against your neck the way he knows you love.
I didn’t bring it up. I didn’t know how to put it into words without sounding weird. And Draco is too valuable as a friend to complicate things with sex that won’t lead anywhere. But he did mention that he slept exceptionally well that night, and I couldn’t help but feel a little proud of that. I know he’s been having trouble sleeping lately, so it felt nice to be able to help him out with that.
I was shaking so much, and I could barely look at him while I spoke to him (I’m also surprised he even heard what I was saying because I was talking super fast and super quiet). But when I finally did look at him, his cheeks had gone pink (shit I love it when he goes pink, he looks so adorable) and he kept staring at the table. But then he looked up at me, and he smiled so brightly, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him smile like that ever the entire time I’ve known him. And he was sort of biting his lip a bit and he came up to me and he whispered that he’s in love with me too. And then he kissed me. Or rather, he leaned in, and we were both so giddy that we started giggling, so we kind of paused, but then he put a hand on my chest and angled his head and I swear I almost fainted, I’ve never wanted to kiss anyone so badly.
Taking a knife and a cutting board, Potter started showing Draco, but it was difficult concentrating on that stupid vegetable with the warmth of Potter’s body so close, his scent filling Draco’s nostrils. The memories of that night, the ones he’d fought so much to block out of his head, started resurfacing.
You sigh, closing your eyes to fully enjoy the peace and quiet, only broken by the rustling of the wind outside and eventually the clank of the shovel as Harry puts it against the wall. You stay still, enjoying the moment, enjoying the sound of your loved one moving closer to you, enjoying the warmth of his body as he comes to stand tightly against you, his chest to you back, his nose pressing in just below your ear like it did in a tool shed so many months ago.
“Oh, Harry, hi!” Neville said, a little more cheerfully than before. “Thought I’d find you here when you weren’t in your own room.”
Draco could barely hear what Potter was saying, his heart pounding in his ears. He’d been such an idiot, so immersed in his own self pity that he’d missed this vital fact. And suddenly Draco saw his behaviour from Potter’s perspective. His constant snipes, his reserved manner, his unwillingness to give the tiniest bit of himself away. He licked his lips despite the fact that his mouth was as dry as the sand on the beach.
“Fair enough,” Harry sighed, leaning in closer. “But if I didn’t try to kiss you to mock you, maybe I tried because I wanted to?”
He hiked up his trousers to his  knees and waded to his left, out to a little lonely rock situated in the water. It wasn’t comfortable, but he’d always been skilled at cushioning charms, and he could still have his feet down to feel the water, while looking out over the waves. He could pretend that he was all alone in the world. Pretend that he hadn’t just made a fool out of himself in front of everyone.
She sighed. She knew humans could be thick, but this one really seemed to be the thickest of them all. “
I just walked into the kitchen and Draco was standing by the sink and I got this urge, so strong that it felt like being under the Imperius curse, to go up to him and put my arms around him and kiss him on the neck. But that must be because I’m a bit touch starved, right? I mean even before this quarantine I’ve been single for a while, because no one ever feels right for me. I need someone who will treat me like an equal, and not put me on a pedestal. I need someone to challenge me, kind of like Ginny did.
“Okay everyone, great work!” Ms Allen clapped her hands to get the group’s attention. “Let’s head back to the house.” As she walked past Harry she gave him a disapproving look. “Don’t forget to stretch when we get back.”
Malfoy shivered, but his voice was as firm as his hand on Harry’s cock was when he said, “Oh don’t worry, Potter. This time,
to the human and understand him, she’d felt important, useful. She loved being able to help nail the perpetrators that had held her and her family in captivity.
Suddenly, Malfoy said something to Potter, sounding like he was wondering what was happening. Nüwa shook her head, Malfoy’s voice throwing her out of the feeling of being aroused by Potter, and suddenly, she noticed the way Potter looked at Malfoy.
The other man spoke, “Thanks for bringing him here.” he smiled. “I don’t know how you managed to slip ‘The Great Harry Potter’ potions, but I’d never have been able to manage it... God,” he said looking down at Harry and trailing his fingers down the side of his face. “He’s just so bloody perfect, aren’t you, sweetheart?”
You don’t say anything, don’t try to tell him he’s wrong, because he’s not. He’s the only one who knows you better than you know yourself.
“Yes,” Harry whispers, eyes still closed, while Draco starts to tug at his clothes, yanking his shirt up to caress Harry’s stomach up to his chest.
Harry immediately tenses and now he’s wide awake. “No,” he says firmly, hugging Draco tighter to him.
, that was the cheesiest line I’ve ever heard. I’m surprised I agreed to take you home that first time.”
kept it a secret that he had a crush on Potter back at Hogw—” she said, but interrupted herself. “Er, nevermind.”
“Aw, you’re no fun!” Ginny said and unceremoniously grabbed Potter’s hand to drag him down beside her on the floor. He sat down but not without protesting. She merely laughed at him and beckoned the others to join them in a circle.
Draco choked back a swell of emotion that threatened to surface and met Harry halfway for a sweet, slow kiss that built-in urgency. The tension and heat from earlier roared back into the room, threatening to strangle the occupants with need. Draco slid down the back of the couch to lie on his back, Harry following and straddling his hips. Harry sat up, grinding down on Draco’s lap, wrenching a strained moan out of him. He placed a hand on Draco's chest to keep him in place and pulled his wand out of his pocket. He muttered a few spells then threw it on the coffee table before attacking the buttons of Draco's shirt.
“So, Harry,” you say to distract yourself from how badly you want to stroke your fingers against him, “what made you decide to go on a pilgrimage then?”
Draco looked up at Harry, but Harry quickly returned to his task of rinsing the strawberries, pretending he hadn’t seen anything. But he had. And he hadn’t missed the adorable way Draco had flushed after his blunder. Harry bit his lip to keep from smiling like the besotted fool he was.
“Only by two months!” Draco said, folding his arms across his chest and giving Harry the infamous Malfoy arched brow, feeling like he could breathe freely again. He knew Harry was only indulging him with the banter, but he was grateful for it.
The rest of the day we just hung around and watched Muggle telly (thank goodness we have Muggle telly!) and goofed around. Nothing out of the ordinary.
Potter bends down, but he needs to put his knee on the bed to reach Draco, and Draco refuses to make things easier for him by moving closer. He smirks when Potter has to brace himself on the headboard to reach him.
“Have you done this before?” you ask, because surely he must have some experience? This cannot feel this good if it’s his first time.
You sigh, closing your eyes, taking in the sound of the stream, seeing the little white flowers all around you in your mind’s eye. You want to save this moment, wrap it up and lock it away from prying eyes, and only take it out when you need to remember how good it can feel to be alive.
Potter shook his head. “What? No! Why would I—?” He sighed. “Okay, let’s take this from the beginning, shall we? First off, Ginny and I aren’t together. We haven’t been for at least a year.”
And you know that it’s not going to be easy, having to hide who you are from the rest of the world, having to hide how much you love Harry. And perhaps you will be punished in the afterlife for this, for loving another person so much you can hardly breathe sometimes, simply because you were both born as men.
“Because you care, even if you don’t like saying it,” Harry whispered back, tapping the top of his menu pointedly, “and lay off the drinks tonight, we need to be in top form.”
Blaise smirked and Harry whipped his head around to the stack of gifts next to him, wanting to occupy his mind with something other than the writhing bodies on the cover of the book currently taking up all the space in his head. “Who’s this from?” He picked up a big box wrapped in black paper with little golden snitches on it and a big golden bow on top.
He cuts himself off as Draco’s cleaning charm washes over him, leaving a tingling sensation in its wake. It makes him lean back to look at Draco properly, makes him see that Draco has collected himself, even if his breathing is a little quicker and shallower, his mask of smug certainty is once again in place. He smiles crookedly at Harry.
make sure Draco got his share of credit for bringing these bastards down. He unhooked the magical scanning device that tracked his levels and recorded all spells and potions he’d been subjected to and unclipped the muggle wire he had strapped to his chest. Wizards, they always scanned for magical traps but never thought to just pat a bloke down.
Draco is quiet for a few long seconds, and Harry is almost beginning to worry that he’ll tell him it’s the stupidest idea he’s ever heard.
But Draco remains on the bed long after his Floo has died down, work completely forgotten. He stays entirely still, his body going cold after the warmth of Potter’s body, and the only thing he manages to do is stare at the hellebore flower in front of him for what feels like hours. He recognises it from his childhood—it’s a flower his mother loved to have in their garden because it’s one of the first flowers to bloom, even when it’s snowing outside. He’s always associated it with the first signs of spring, new beginnings. But this one feels like a sign of something sinister.
