“That is not happening.”
I love you, Harry told him.
The white faded as it approached the end of the land, and blended with the nebulous edge of the North Sea, smudged with faint blue. Open, to a wider world beyond.
“And don’t forget to prepare it before the wedding,” Hermione chimes in.
“It’s just a game. It’s just for fun.” Harry laughed, too. “C’mon. What do you think my flower is?”
Does he sit by the window and watch the droplets race each other down in thin rivers?
“Okay,” Draco finally said. “Spit it out.”
He wondered what Harry was doing now. He’d probably returned back to the cottage already. Reading, perhaps, like he often did lately. It would be one of the thick books with loose spines—a novel? A record of a sort? Draco thought he’d glimpsed pictures on some pages, though he couldn’t be certain—or a thin booklet, the corners rumpled and smoothed. Lounged in the armchair, his legs folded, thin socks peeping out from underneath. The warm yellow hue of the small lamp caught on the pages, on the strands of his hair. His glasses would slide down from his nose, sitting low. He’d nudge it up every now and then, unaware of the gesture.
Harry made a soft noise, then he kissed back—deeply, tenderly, as though Draco was something to be handled with care. Soft lips, hot breaths. His fingers trembled by Draco’s face, as though he was terrified—as though he was afraid to touch, as though he couldn’t be anything but delicate, the kiss slow with everything he poured in and laid bare.
Just like that, Draco’s eyes welled again.
“You’re pretty,” Harry said.
The embroidered patterns on the duvet was rough against his back. The air cool, heat tumbling off his own body in waves. He gasped, nails digging into Harry’s back—then everything was pleasure, sending him high up the clouds and hot everywhere. He cried Harry’s name like a prayer. Harry cradled him through it all, his head close to his chest, murmuring—panting by his ear. Broken words, stumbling phrases, asking if he was alright, if he needed, if he wanted—
“But your gallery. Isn’t it a world—”
Back in his flat, he pushed the windows wide open and stepped out to the balcony. The dusk had just settled, a bruising skyline. Down on the road dotted scattered lights of cars, of illuminated windows. A drunk sang, notes dragged on and out of tune, tinny in the warm air.
“I didn’t help,” Draco said softly, as if to himself. “I didn’t—”
Draco took a sip of warm cider. He’d never really noticed, but it tasted different from the ones he was used to, the ones back in London: tangier, sourer. Tasted closer to apples.
Potter kissed him.
“Oh.” Potter looked taken aback. “How come you cook, then?”
—then brought up the incident to Isla Allen, who agreed that it indeed was quality artwork, and did Draco draw it himself? Must have taken a lot of time, what was the inspiration behind it? Did he have more drawings at home? They could possibly arrange an exhibition if he’d like, if there were enough drawings. Where to set it up? Could be the lounging room. No, too many people use the space during lunch. How about the garden in the back? They could set up temperature charms since it was outdoors, and humidity charms if necessary, surely Briony would be happy to help… In the end it was decided that the lobby would be the best choice, and that it would probably take them a week to clear the space, but setting it up could be done in no time. Could Draco bring the artwork here himself? Were special preservation charms to be cast during the transportation? If it was a bother they could arrange, too, for a team of five or six to help…
Harry doesn’t turn it off.
“I am not. I’ve had practice.”
“Oh, no. They’re all ewes, all ladies. I only keep rams for mating season.” Potter fed another sheep. Saw Draco’s expression, and explained, “Neville doesn’t mind, of course. He’d wanted a sheep named after him for so long that he was quite on the top of the world when he heard about it. I don’t think he actually heard her gender.”
“Any progress?” Potter called from afar, walking close. Draco groaned.
Beside him, Draco turns a page of his book.
Harry smiles and shakes his head. Ron and Hermione have been worried about him, he knows, ever since they moved in together at the beginning of the year. Worried that he’d feel left out, worried that he’s quit the Aurors, worried that he isn’t seeing anyone, though they say it takes time, yes, no hurries—though they know what’s happened between him and Draco, whole-heartedly one-sided, though Hermione always looks a little sad whenever he asks after him. They don’t point it out, though, so he doesn’t, either. He is secretly grateful for that.
Somewhere in the distance, a crow screeched.
The cold lips of a vial pressed gently against his chapped own. Draco parted them. Cool liquid slid through in a steady flow and he swallowed, choking on the last bits, coughing. The hangover potion worked through his rigid muscles in a warm tingle and dulled his headache into a distant hum. Mouth a mixture of the sweet aftertaste of the potion and the foul aftertaste of alcoholic sleep, Draco pushed himself up.
“Do you garden?”
“Make one up, then. This is depressing.”
“Wha—but why not?”
It took a second for Draco to register. “What?”
They stayed like this, Harry swaying them gently. Draco loosened the clutch on his shirt and wrapped his arms loosely around Harry’s back. Buried his face into his neck. He hadn’t seen him since Christmas, and that was nearly six months ago. A soft ache tugged at his sternum. Was the rest of his life going to be like this, he wondered. Missing Harry like an endless stream until the next time they met again.
He pushes himself off the couch and heads to the kitchen for coffee. They never seem to be strong enough these days. He slowly gulps down the bitter thing and grimaces after he finishes. Rinses the mug, sets it aside upside down to dry. Goes back to the couch. Sits there, stares into midair. From the corner of his eye, the kitten is a soft, white ball curled up against his thigh.
A long pause, as if he was lost in his own memory.
“Yes.”
Harry shrugs. The kettle whistles from the kitchen. Luna unplugs her wand from her hair and waves it as Harry pushes the empty plates with crumbs to one side, a bag of sunflower seeds and a half-empty mug to the other. The kettle settles into the space and quiets, humming.
And he didn’t want anything from Draco. Just for him to accept his gift.
“Okay, okay.” Harry cuts her off again. “A list of specialists. Yes?”
“Potter.”
“But…but the Brussels Sprouts, they will have spoiled by tomorrow,” Draco spluttered, “And the butter, I’d left it out for—”
He stayed for a while longer—perhaps five minutes, or perhaps thirty, forty minutes—before slipping out of bed, and padded towards the living room. The morning air was cold, chilled overnight with early spring. He stopped at the end of the short corridor, under the joined arch that led to the living room.
Then came another
Draco meant to say no. He meant to say he didn’t need hot chocolate, that Potter should go take a shower, should go sleep. That Potter had it worse than he did, that he was even more exhausted and still had a full day ahead of him, that he shouldn’t spend his time fussing over Draco—but his voice was a dull thing that wouldn’t cooperate with his thoughts, and before he could say anything Potter was already back with two mugs of hot chocolate. He handed one to Draco. It was piled with a tiny floating hill of marshmallows.
But it did. At the beginning.
Astoria, when she turned and looked at him, was basked in the soft, red glow of dusk. The city, too, was basked in it. Her cheeks caught the rosy glint like a blush, her eyes the color of an array of a sunset.
To always be alone.
“No?”
Perhaps everything is done in vain, he thought, as the train started and slowly slid away.
In the dark, the kitten stares back at him with gleaming eyes.
Just then, another thunder rumbles. The kitten screams again and tries to burrow deeper. Harry winces at the ill timing as he strokes the kitten’s back, scratches its ears. Murmurs, trying to soothe it. The rain patters against the window, a dull, lulling rhythm.
Lucius’s son, after all.
“It would have been more clever,” Draco insisted. “You could have caught a cold, sweating and taking off your jacket like that. It’s April.”
“Merlin, Potter, are you tenacious.”
Draco smiled. “Like a bedtime story? Shall I make sure you’re tucked in and kiss you goodnight?”
“Yes. Is there anything special he will need? Any precautions, anything we should look out for?” Khatri picks up her quill again. “You can
Potter let out a laugh. “Sure. Tell me all your jokes.”
“You didn’t tell me—”
Later Potter found him, again, this time by a protruded rock on the edge of the fell side. A piece of parchment in the cradle of his rigid fingers—blank.
“Oh.”
“Neville? He’s a ram?”
Draco will be furious about it all after he is transformed back.
Draco tried to be witty, his throat thick. He dropped his head and managed a wet laugh.
“I can stay,” Draco suddenly whispered. Turned to Harry. Harry looked slightly bewildered.
“Right, right. Show off.” Potter chuckled, brought the mug of wine to his lips. “You can’t be taller than me by more than one inch.”
Harry grins. Draco, as always when they watch talent shows, huffs and stomps to the kitchen to make tea.
They seemed so small on the rooftop—the hills stretched boundless underneath them, rolling and fading into the horizon. The countryside was awash in silver: the bare branches of the trees, the meadows, the miniature farmhouses down the hills. Their beehives, tiny boxes on the far side of their garden. They were still buzzing faintly with activity inside, but in the silence of the night they seemed completely still, as though asleep, too, in the cradle of the moonlight.
Draco paced his room when he couldn’t sleep.
The tea smelt of roses. Narcissa had probably picked them herself by hand just this morning, when the petals were still dewy and the bushes bathed in mist, the grass dampening the hem of her dress. Had made the tea herself over the stove, the kettle humming quietly as the rose petals floated, rolling about in the boiling water.
“It’s nothing.”
“I didn’t.”
“Either way. The most important thing is that you are not allowed to write a weepy speech. Ever.”
The kitten meows loudly in protest. In protest of what, Harry does not know, but he chuckles all the same. On impulse, he bends down and kisses the top of the kitten’s head.
The charcoal in his hand had covered his fingertips in soot, had left a tiny line where it pressed against the parchment on his lap.
“I wish I could kiss you right now,” Draco said. “I wish I could see you right now, you and your snotty face. I’d take it all.”
“I can’t take it,” Draco said. He loved it. His fingers couldn’t seem to leave the wool.
Draco said, “You found me.”
So Draco folded his legs and continued with his portraits, charcoal in hand. The fire crackled in the hearth, cast golden lights over the now empty living room. He’d started with the lambs and wanted to capture each and every one of them. The mug of hot cider steamed on the table, the chipped corner smoothed in the warm hue.
flashing before it galloped away. Cho had lain down at a corner layered with thick hay, was breathing heavily, gritting her teeth and throwing her head back. Draco tried to calm her down, tried to shush her, tried to hold her head or scratch her ear—wouldn’t do. Eventually Potter had to call the Muggle vet, who spent two hours on the road before arrival. She diagnosed her with hypocalcemia and administered calcium directly to her abdomen before leaving.
“This is all very different from what I imagined.”
Draco clutched his coat and lifted his eyes to look at Harry. His voice was small when he said, “You like me.”
“I’ve always imagined, well.” Potter laughed, a soft chuckle. “Purebloods lounging on velvet couches and eating grapes while the house elves serve them. Things of the sort.”
Draco glanced at him and smiled.
“Of course you weren’t, Ronald.”
Draco gulped the thing in one go. The familiar bitter taste left him grimacing as he opened his eyes. Potter was crouching in front of the couch, looking almost sympathetic.
The air feels warm after the shower, quiet. Harry drapes a towel over his shoulder as he pads around, barefoot and just the tiniest bit hopeful, first to his bedroom and then to the kitchen. Finally, he gives in and checks the living room. Stands on his tiptoes and peers into the back of the bookshelf—
“Where did I get this?” Draco mocked. “From Mother Nature, from the vast land and rivers, from the almighty Circe who—”
They turn to the kitten at the same time. The kitten meows at the sudden attention and jumps onto the table, pawing at the bag of sunflower seeds. Luna cracks one open, and starts popping a tiny hill of seeds while the kitten munches on it.
On the bed, crumpled slightly around him, was a duvet as ugly as the quilt in the living room.
Harry hums on.
“Ah,” Draco said. “See, I’ve changed, too. And now I don’t want you anymore.”
Harry laughs dryly. “How am I supposed to steal the thunder from you when I am currently very single?”
And saw Astoria.
What is this?”
Draco echoes, closing his eyes.
Harry lets out a soft sigh. He shifts, kisses the kitten’s head, and falls asleep.
“What was that?”
Then Harry was walking towards him. Casually, not especially fast or strong or slow, but to Draco it felt like a thousand years as he took the steps. A thousand years, his hands stuffed in his pockets, glasses catching the light of the lobby. He wore a cornflower blue shirt, had left his collar unbuttoned, and it looked exceptionally smart on him. How unfair, that he looked so at ease as he took the steps that would end the distance between them? Seconds before Harry reached him, when Harry had opened his mouth to speak, his lips parted—Draco grabbed his arm and dragged him all the way back to his office.
The kitten nips Harry’s hand.
He was hinting to Draco at what he wanted for Christmas by dropping Draco gifts.
“Would you like to see my sheep?”
The music is slow, a river running and parting by rocks every now and then—gentle, almost, the tune curling at the edges. Harry only vaguely recognizes a couple lines from what music he happens to scrape every now and then and, surprisingly, discovers they are Muggle. Old, but still.
“Check on Fred for me if you see him,” Potter called. “He looked a little tired yesterday.”
Then Draco happened, and he couldn’t sleep in Harry’s flat. And Harry couldn’t sleep in Draco’s flat because the silence was too empty, too deafening, Draco’s bedroom engulfed in the middle of the night amidst the endless rolling hills of Wiltshire—Harry’s flat too loud, too human. And when Draco couldn’t sleep Harry couldn’t sleep, either, drifting in and out of consciousness as Draco stirred and sighed and shifted and sighed again, a small movement of the shoulder. A turn of his head, the cotton pillowcase rustled against his soft cheek.
Potter looked exasperated. Draco continued his melodrama just to keep Potter’s small smile at his lips. It was awfully sad, Potter all by himself on Christmas. Potter seemed to understand this and did little else to stop him. Draco thought he could go on forever, right then and there: sitting beside Potter, waving his arms about in the snow.
“You’ve got more...experience—in the field than I do—”
Then he caught a glimpse of blossoming calendulas—a bush of lovely, tiny, bright yellow, flowering crowns—at the bottom of a rock, sprouting with green, hearty leaves.
“I bet you thought this was a grand plan, didn’t you? Come back and Draco Malfoy will leap right back into your arms like the slut he was. Bet you thought you were going to get a good fuck afterwards, didn’t you?” Draco smiled icily. “Do you still remember? Do you need a reminder, hmm? Near the end you always lost yourself.
The sun was setting. Draco remembered this, too. The sky spilled in yellow and orange, coloring the underside of clouds a tender pink. Down below, the hubbub of pedestrians was distant. The honking of cars, the gliding away of trains—distant. A couple buildings had already lit up, tiny windows bright in the falling dusk. The sun, large and glowing red like a lantern, caught on the jagged tips of the edge of the city at the skyline.
It swelled, then quickly dissipated into the cold.
The cascade beats him on his shoulder.
“Do you have stubble?”
“Mm,” Harry agreed. “Let me in.”
Draco paused. “Abbot?”
“Wait, you—you made it yourself?”
“Ah, never mind.”
“I was trying to find something, I guess. And avoid the press. I thought I was bound to live a certain way, you see, and I hated it. Couldn’t stand it anymore, so I left, and…and really, without the frame I thought that caged me, I was lost. I don’t know what else I’m supposed to do. There are so many options, so many…possibilities. I had nowhere to start. Who am I if I’m not who the world thought I was—who my friends thought I was? What could I do except to work at a B&B?”
“Every guest should be cackling by the time you finish,” Ron declares. “No exceptions. If you write a weepy speech I will hex you out of my wedding.”
“No.”
Warmth settled over him like a soft blanket, warmth like wood smoke and cider. Draco snapped his head up. Potter’s silhouette didn’t stop, didn’t look over his shoulder. Hands stuffed in pockets, his body swaying with each footstep.
Potter laughed and squeezed his arm. Draco sighed.
Until Harry tries to clean its bum.
Quite early on, just after they bought the house in preparation for retirement, they had decided that the armchairs were to sit side by side by the large windows in the living room. And this is where they sit now. Sunlight streams in from the glass panes, baking the overstuffed cushions so warm that, almost too easily, one drifts off without even realizing.
Draco pulled open another drawer. Tiny tea spoons. He pushed it back, annoyed. “The Great Harry Potter apologizing. What a sight to behold.”
The exhibition was to last four weeks. Afterwards it would depart to Belgium, to the Netherlands, make a loop around Europe and then head towards Asia.
Draco trudged after Potter as he counted the sheep, still muttering. Potter finished and found a flat surface of rock, wiped the snow off. Sat down. Draco stood with his arms crossed.
Throat dry, he asked, “Do you want me out of the house?”
Draco retorted that it obviously meant he’d gotten enough rest already, he wasn’t in need of more, he knew how to take care of himself, thank you very much—Potter got up in the middle of their quarrel, muttering about stubbornness, muttering about the one thing that hadn’t changed since eleven, muttering about Draco acting like a child, it was for his own good for Merlin’s sake, couldn’t even stay back for five minutes—
Draco looked out of the window again. There was only darkness. Not vague shadows, or nebulous contours of their surroundings; just darkness. Engulfed them as if they were a lighthouse at sea, as if they existed among nothingness. It still frightened him a little even after all these months.
The temperature dropped as autumn seeped in, and they moved the potted orange trees indoors. They placed them by the French windows in the living room. It was a bright, chilly day; sunlight flooded through the large glass panes, bathed the orange trees in honey-gold—the crisp white petals dusted golden, hints of bright orange amidst dark, waxy leaves.
“Traitor,” Harry mutters.
“Aren’t you cold?” he asked.
“Well…I mean, no—”
“No.” Draco’s lids dropped as he tilted his head, leaned in. “I can’t…pull it off.”
“No, no—stop. Wait, Draco.” Potter laughed, made to grab his arm—paused, and reeled himself into the kitchen instead. He fetched a hand towel and ran it under the tap water. Smiling faintly, he walked over, the heavy towel dripping in his hands. Crouched, gently grabbed Draco’s hand and moved it away from his face. Touched the towel to his cheek.
“Demands all the best food.”
Outside, the night had fallen, the dark sky clear.
The kitten lies down between his elbows and, looking at the foreign letters, simply listens.
Potter nodded.
yes.” Draco looks away, cheeks tinging pink. “It means
he’d say.
“Malfoy.”
“Ah.” Potter’s voice came from above. “The beauty awakens.”
Neville had tumbled to the others, scurrying up powders of snow until it slowed, blending into the flock. Potter watched with his hands stuffed in his pocket. Somehow, standing right beside him, he felt a universe away.
The sleep, however, was uneasy, filled with dreams half-baked with memories. Astoria stood at the balustrade in the violet dress, saying
Halloween is harder than it has ever been.
“He has really nice fur as a kitten,” Luna comments.
Breathing heavily, he stared at the ceiling. His surroundings came to him slowly, bit by bit: the winter light, casting the furniture in a cold hue. The short table beside the couch. The empty hearth, cinders piled haphazardly in ashes.
“It’s still November.”
Harry grinned warmly, foolishly, at the word
Harry has always been a little afraid to kiss him, then. Like afraid to poke a dream awake.
Draco, muzzy and half-asleep still, looked over. Potter was sleeping on the other side, his back against the foot of the armchair, head lolling on the mattress. His mouth had fallen open, slanted. The soft, vague marks of sleep imprinted on his cheeks.
It took up the whole wall in front of him. A young man, walking along the British coast. He was half in turning, his face hidden, but still there was a hint of a smile in what little visage he showed. His blond hair was bright against the gloomy sky. There was something about the way he held himself, the way his one foot, submerged in the shallow waves, lifted slightly in the motion of turning, that said he was completely at home. That said he was content, perhaps even happy.
“I’ve just come back.” Harry shook his head, turning back to the photograph. “I’m not leaving for a long while.”
He sat down on the edge of the roof and dangled his feet midair. The chilly air stung his cheeks. He let out a breath; mist in the cold night, quickly dissipated.
The stars blinked, lost.
Soft, Harry thinks. He can imagine Draco being soft.
“You did,” Draco pointed out, quiet. “People don’t say things they don’t mean without thinking. It works the other way around.”
“Shh,” Draco murmured. Groggily, he reached for Harry’s face, cupped it in his hands. Pulled him close. He’d seen this before, too, one too many nights to finally understand why Harry thought to live was not to be adventurous, but to find peace. Draco held his nape as Harry burrowed his face into Draco’s neck, breath still harsh. Rounded his arms around Draco’s body, clutch tight. Draco carded through his hair and stroked, mumbled. “Shh, it’s alright…c’mere. It’s alright…”
But there is no malice. There is only banter, witty and fast and sending a rush down Harry’s spine.
“Killjoy,” Potter said. He was smiling, looking somewhere afar. Draco absentmindedly wiped his sooty hands into the snow, then thought of something.
Draco preferred not to remember her that way.
“This should be enough,” Potter said, wrecked, looking away. Pushed himself up with a deep breath. “It’s not deep, so it should heal quick. Just tell me if anything doesn’t look right, if it’s still bleeding, or…”
An owl hooted deep inside the forest. Above them the stars moved—just a fraction of an angle. Potter stuffed a thermos into his arms. Draco unscrewed the bottle; the tea was still hot and it burnt his tongue. He hastily retreated, caught the tail end of Potter’s scattered laugh. Tentatively, he tried again. The tea warmed him. Between his teeth lingered the faint taste of figs.
“Not lethal ones, no.”
Cho baaed at him, mouth still moving as she chewed on grass.
There wasn’t a manual for the hammock.
He chuckles wetly when the kitten places a tiny paw onto the thin line of his mouth. He squeezes it, notices a patch of black fur just above. A little dot.
Malfoy?”
Beside him, Draco has flushed down his neck.
Harry laughed and rambled as he took Draco gently by the elbow and led him to the couch. Squeezed Draco’s wrist, then rummaged through his fridge and took out a jar of cider and two mugs—
“I know you,” Draco echoed. More in question than in statement. Astoria sensed the shift in his mood and reached a hand back, covering his on her shoulder.
Harry sinks into the stiff, mint-green chairs again. The clock on the wall ticks by slowly, the handles moving only a fraction of an inch at once. He peels the prickled paint off. Bites his nails. Remembers he should not bite his nails and stops, then resumes. Counts the cracks in the walls. Debates over whether he should count the branched lines as one crack or several, decides to count them as separate ones. Gets to two hundred and twenty-seven and loses track. Counts again. Gets to three hundred and five when the doors open again and the Healer emerges from behind.
The kitten jumps onto the table and, carefully avoiding the burning kettle, sniffs at the sunflower seeds that have spilled out of the bag. Luna cracks one open and feeds it to the kitten. The kitten accepts it and, once again, settles comfortably on Luna’s lap.
Draco laughed. “And did she get the fish back into the bowl?”
“You can pet them, you know,” Potter said. Draco shot his head up. Potter looked amused—definitely too amused. “They don’t bite. Ah, I mean…yeah, they bite, but only under extreme circumstances. They’re usually really gentle. Not Lettuce though, she definitely bites.”
Draco, rushing out from the kitchen, stopped dead in his tracks.
That night, the cherries taste sweeter than usual.
They were so close. The faint puff of Potter’s breath caught on Draco’s cheeks. Potter’s eyes dropped to his mouth, his own lips parting. Just the slightest. Soft pink. Chapped.
Draco fetched the ugly quilt, the one he’d been using every night, and covered his lap with it. “Why are there no marshmallows in the hot chocolate?”
“Do you have any idea how it is to see the face of every single person who died because of you whenever someone casts a spell? I don’t care about traveling, or meeting new people, or all the potential and experiences. I just want peace. I just want to be able to sleep at night without screaming into the white of a void. Is that too much to ask?”
The kitten tilts its head as if reading the words. Turns its head and meows at Harry.
“Is it?” Potter asked again, voice hoarse. “Is it what you want?”
“To appease the ladies,” Potter explained with a quick smile, “so they don’t scream the whole time.”
Draco sagged. He walked over, pulled the French doors open, and stepped into the cold morning air. Harry was in only cotton pajama pants. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s warm, bare torso, dropped his head to the crook of his neck. Now that the crisis was over, he wanted to sleep again.
It was a card. An invitation, Harry had said.
“Enough,” Draco said, briefly shutting his eyes. Seven years and he was still as pathetic. He started gathering his belongings. “Excuse me, I have to leave.”
The wedding is small; only friends and family members are invited. Harry delivers a speech in his best robes. He’s practised it, yes, at Hermione’s insistence; it is weepy, yes, but perhaps under the influence of sparkling wine it has become weepier than he’d intended. Hermione’s eyes are glistening by the time he finishes. And then it is Ron’s turn, and he tells Harry to sod off because
“The sheep don’t. They’re rather well mannered and I intend to keep them that way.”
Harry was going to punch him, he could see it in his eyes. Draco raised his chin and braced himself. Instead he was tugged down, violently, which caught him by surprise—and fell back onto the chair with a hard
“Yes.” Harry wants to kiss that smile. “I have clumsy feet.”
“No, probably not. Save the busy streets.”
“I’m going to wait until you come out,” he warns, defeated. “I’m going to stay right here until you eat your dinner or drink water. I will. I won’t move an inch. I really won’t.”
Which then turned into chastising Potter in his lack of ability to cook for himself, then turned into a complaint for Potter’s inadequate sense of fashion in clothes. Potter turned him towards the bathroom, exasperated, as Draco persisted with
Draco pushed himself out of the booth. “Oh, shut your—”
“Yes,” Harry laughed, “and I am going to be a gentleman about it. I will offer you mine, and you will take a bite, and you will say,
“Yes,” Harry whispered. “Still the same, just different.”
“Going to the village?” Draco asked, skeptical. “Isn’t it a bit too late?”
“Stop dodging the question! Why didn’t you say you have to go back?”
Draco steals his armchair every two days. And then he complains loudly when Harry in turn settles on his, scurrying back to his own and muttering under his breath.
From the kitchen come the sounds of making tea: kettle clanking, cabinet doors opening and closing, tap running. Harry turns off the television and turns on the wireless instead. Screws the buttons this way and that, looking for the station Draco listens to; finds it, hugs it to his belly. The song comes out muffled. Harry laughs.
“Oh no, no. If the operation is successful, as it usually is, the victim will feel extremely nauseous, disoriented, and will require lots of rest both magically and physically—which just means they will be sleeping a lot. They may also show memory loss or gaps for the first week or two, but there are no known lasting symptoms.” Khatri remembers something and frowns a little. “How long has it been since the victim transformed? To your knowledge, of course.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Are you sure you didn’t charm it? Transfigure a toothpick? Steal it from someone else?”
Ron smiles and shakes his head. Shuts the fridge. “You might need to feed three mouths in the future. Better stack up your food.”
“You’ll fall!” Harry shouts, frustrated, even though he knows that it will land on its paws.
His door creaks open, a faint noise amidst the pattering rain. Harry startles and turns.
It is so unexpectedly intimate that Harry doesn’t quite know what to do with it. He grows clumsy, working in the kitchen: his elbows bump into the pots when he stirs, he chops the carrots slightly canted, his hand slips from the cabinet door when he reaches for the spices. Draco’s voice floats through the corridors, dampened by the shower and the walls. Soft, vague, a blend of notes.
His emotions stumbling over one another, Draco was gripped by an ache to brew again. Right then, right there. To immerse himself in the aroma of shaved barks and dried leaves, to feel the thrumming flow at his fingertips as he adjusted his hold on the knife handle to chop, to mix, to stir. To coax the potions to shimmer and gleam in the color he wanted them to. To create from broken pieces of nothing, knowing, by heart, that they still held value.
“Something more for your wardrobe,” Potter grinned, abashed. Proud and awkward in his shrug, trying to brush it off. “You know, so you don’t have to always wear mine. They’re new so they don’t stink of sheep.”
“Is it the one you talked about before? The one about the painting of a bird?”
“No,” Pansy agreed, “I’m sure you don’t fancy him.” She squeezed his crumb-covered fingers and pushed herself up from the booth. “Finish your lunch, dear. I’m going to the loo, and then we’re leaving.”
“No,” Draco says. Then, “I’m sorry.”
Of course he knows Draco used to speak French. He knows that Draco still speaks it, too, sometimes, even though he’s spoken English ever since Hogwarts—like an afterthought, a slipped music note. Just a mumbling, or when he stubs his toe into the corner of a table leg—a string of curses flowing out of his mouth like a poem. Or during sleep. When he stirs, sleep marks tender on his cheek, his face half-buried into the pillows—hair tousled. Lips parted, as if the syllables were still on the tip of his tongue, still floating through his dreams.
It was a strange comfort, feeding her. To cradle her chin in his palm, tilting the head up; to listen to her suckle, the squelching of milk through rubber teat. She was strong, and hungry. Vigorous in her suckling, as though every mouthful of milk were a victory. The milk always disappeared rather quickly from the bottle, occasionally dribbling down her chin. Her belly warm afterwards, she followed Draco around in the cottage, bleating for attention. Folded her legs and cuddled against the puddle of clothes Potter had made for her as a makeshift bed by the hearth. Tilted her chin up and poised herself gracefully whenever she sensed that Draco was drawing her, no matter how discreet Draco thought he’d been.
It was a comfort, too, to watch her sleep. To watch her fold in on herself, her belly rising and falling with each breath. Her eyes closed, her ears spread out like two tiny wings. One night Draco pillowed his head on his folded arms, was dozing in and out of sleep when a loud bleat woke him. Cissy had stumbled out of her bed, was staring unblinkingly at him. She bleated again.
Harry considers it. “What are they this time?”
it said.
“Do you like it?”
Harry wonders if Draco knows the walls are not sound-proof. He’s had half a mind to tell him about it, if only to be fair.
The grasses were tall, rolling pass them as they drove. They swayed in the wind, a rippling sea of green: timothy, common bent, meadow grasses. The stone wall he once followed was now buried underneath the yellow rattle, its scattered flowers. Draco closed his eyes and let the wind caress his cheeks, let it comb through and rumple his hair. Beside him, Potter’s hair was wildly flipped back. His unbuttoned flannel shirt flapped on both sides of his white t-shirt, two wings of scarlet red. He turned the wheel with ease, a faint smile at his lips, the other hand resting on the gear between them.
“Malfoy—”
“Did you know Cho once head-butted me into the river?” Potter suddenly asked. “Scottish Blackface are usually pretty gentle, but…it was a summer, I think, and I got too close to her lamb. I’d just started, then, foolish—didn’t know anything. So she charged. I didn’t even see her coming. Just like that, she shoved me into the river. I didn’t even know what happened. Just scrambled up, gasping and coughing on water like a fool, massaging my buttocks—”
Harry wakes up to strange white lights playing across the ceiling. He blinks groggily, and it takes him a second to remember that he is in the guest room.
Harry feels like crying. He pulls Ron into a huge embrace instead, squeezing him hard. Ron squeezes him back, laughing.
Here was the thing: Draco’s tattoo bloomed. Two nights ago, but it had been slow all year long: sprouting, leaves spreading, pulling tall, the buds growing heavier and heavier. Then it bloomed and Draco wanted to laugh, because of course. Of course it was lemon flowers.
The words wouldn’t leave his mind. He sat in a meeting with colleagues whose faces he couldn’t name, lukewarm coffee in hand. Reread a passage on test results of a burn-treating potion three times before registering the words. Unconsciously tapped his feet against the floor until the woman next to him, in her mid-thirties with square-framed glasses and a tight bun, whispered fiercely for him to please stop. He apologized and went back to his paper. He was supposed to take notes. There were still four more to go. He had been on this one for an hour already.
“That is your constellation, darling. That is
Harry holds Draco tighter. Far down, a corgi barks, Rose and Hugo’s laughter echoing across the fields.
Potter was taken aback. “What?”
“Bacon again?” Joe asks, dusting his hands off his apron as he pushes himself up from a stool. They have known each other since Harry moved into this flat. He even knows Harry’s carbonara recipe.
“You know, I thought you’d be pretty used to rain,” Potter quipped. “Living in London and all.”
Harry watches with a dopey smile and yawns. His pajamas are much too comfortable, and so is his bed, his pillows. He feels as though he will fall asleep at any time. Just slip into unconsciousness without noticing.
“Listen,” Potter said, “I’ll see if I can get you an owl tomorrow, or…yeah, an owl. Maybe you can write home, or to your job, or…”
How long since he’s seen those eyes. How long since he’s seen Draco.
The sheep did look starved, though, impatient in their seeking for food. Potter laughed lightly as he nudged some away with his knee, looked at Draco.
Draco opened his mouth. The answer choked him like the pit of a fruit. He could see nothing other than the green of Potter’s eyes.
Potter’s clothes were, true to Draco’s complaints, all bland except for the socks, which were maroon and dotted with tiny snitches. Draco pulled his limbs into the sweater, leaned against the door of the tiny bathroom as he stepped into the trousers. Snorted as he pulled on the socks but pulled them on nonetheless. Snorted again when he ambled back into the living room and discovered, on Potter’s feet, the ridiculous cream socks with broomsticks.
Draco did, explaining his list in the cool, green flames. Words tumbled out of his mouth and looped all around, and Draco realised he was talking in circles.
“I’m not leaving.”
“That’s not what you said yesterday.”
“Still. I want to know.”
Slowly, on the other side of the phone, Harry quieted down. Draco stroked the smooth metallic surface of the telephone. After the mess of a confession he felt numb and fuzzy, a little tired.
Draco had indeed been wearing Potter’s clothes. But he had stopped remembering. Had stopped putting his mind to it, had grown used to the gentle and loose hug of jumpers, the patches of fuzz balls where the wool was rubbed rough. Had grown used to the faint smell of sheep. He himself smelt of sheep when he showered, the steam amplifying it tenfold.
“I’m alright,” Harry murmured into the kiss. Roamed his hands down Draco’s slippery back. “I’m alright. You know that, right?”
“Ginny loves this spot,” Potter suddenly said.
“For being an unregistered
“She’s great at it. She can go model professionally some day.”
The rain didn’t let up. Draco waited, absentminded, sitting on the ground and watching Cissy fuss about the beetle. A while later Potter came back, letting in the sound of falling rain as he pushed the barn doors open. Soaked from head to toe, he smoothed his fringe back and shook the water off his face like a dog. Draco wanted to laugh. But he didn’t, and instead only watched with warmth spreading over his chest.
undignified! How did they even let it happen, Cho and—oh no, there’s a Weasel in here, isn’t it? And a Granger? Merlin’s tits, and—”
Potter raised the towel—didn’t know what to do with it—dropped his hands back. Then he disappeared into the corridor.
“Above Hercules, the four stars…yes, that’s it. Then follow the tail…it winds up through Ursa Major and…yes, Ursa Minor…”
“I don’t—I don’t fancy him anymore.”
Around them the hills parted ways—around them, but not for them. Draco suddenly felt tiny. This land, every rise and dip of it, was the result of centuries and centuries of icebergs forming and melting, forging and retreating. Of earth pushing up and wind eroding, rocks crumbling; of oceans lapping relentlessly at the bay, day after day and never once stopping. All around them was the great flow of time, something bigger than them, something they had not seen the beginning of and would not see the end of either. Something they are part of but not in the center of, merely passersby—who don’t matter, really, in this grand, endless river rushing forward.
Autumn has arrived. The air cools with each passing day whenever he takes walks; in the mornings, in the evenings, his coat billowing in the wind. But here, inside their house, it is still warm. The wooden beams harbor the lingering warmth of summer, exhaling softly, a cocoon of warmth.
Slowly, gently, in a low voice, Draco says, “I love you.”
“That sounds nice,” Potter said. Then, as if remembering, he laughed. “You sure hated Magical Creatures for someone who’s fascinated by animals.”
And then, when all was finished—when every tin of tea was arranged side by side in the cupboard, every package of biscuit piled in the cabinet, everything, everything—when all was finished, Potter crouched in front of him, careful.
They owned, together: the chipped teapot in the kitchen, the small, antique table lamp in the living room, the gramophone—which Harry brought from Grimmauld place, but said it belonged to the both of them. Harry was good with the bees. He walked among the beehives with simply a head veil; the bees climbed on and off his bare hands, let him gently brush them off. His hands were sure; his arms steady. His fingers held still as the bees crawled over his palms, his knuckles, the back of his hands.
“Yes, I realised.”
“I thought it was obvious.”
Harry takes a deep breath. On his lap, the kitten meows loudly.
Perhaps it was all about Draco himself.
Draco stirs. Harry wants to pull him close, but Draco blinks himself awake.
He followed her to the café. She pulled her chair out, smoothing down her beige green dress as she sat; Draco ordered Earl Grey. It was a cloudy day, the heavy sky looking as though it would rain any second.
The card was smooth, the wide expense of blue softer than the London sky.
Draco is smiling. Faintly, his cheeks folding along the lines carved into soft skin. He is no longer the man he used to look when he was thirty. His hair thin and silvery, no longer the buttery blond it used to be—
“It’s going to be alright,” he says again, now standing in the gardens of the Burrow. He traces the shell of Draco’s ear, touch light. “I promise.”
Potter whistled. “I should bring you to the groceries with me next time.”
Draco, an inevitable pull at the center of his chest, followed. Bent, and pressed his mouth to the crook of her neck. Brushed his lips along her bare shoulder. The skin was warm, sweet like honey.
How could he start? Everything that happened in the past two months stumbled over one another all at once, rushing to the clog of his voice. He could not start, but amidst the toppling of emotions, words fell out before he could even comprehend them—a simple truth. “I ran out of cider.”
Draco let out a laugh, unable to control himself. Potter grinned, and started to introduce the sheep around them.
“Also, I guess I always thought you pureblood families would have some…I don’t know, ponies? Horses?”
He stared helplessly at the tangle of ropes and the piece of cloth, flattened onto the ground and creasing at the edges. It didn’t help much. The band of beige folded compliantly along the bumps of the ground, a little hill of its own, an angle too sharp at the corners.
He looks at the cracks in the walls but doesn’t see them, not really. His head is a distant haze from the world.
ahead of time he’d have taken twenty minutes to pick up something fresh at the market, but no, instead they had to make do with fish—
“Ah,” Draco said flatly. Attempted to retrieve his dignity with a turned head, a short, “of course.”
Draco started at the chill. Potter shushed him, amused, wiped at his face. Retraced the wet track.
“They are, aren’t they?”
“Come, come.”
Except they had a fancy dinner tonight—alfresco, candle light floating in the air, bubbled champagne for adults and bubbled cider for kids, which got Rose and Huge screaming and flapping their arms about in delight. Hermione tried to calm them, Ron wasn’t helping, and at last the children and the dogs were let loose into the vast hills expanding all the way from behind the cottage to the sea—corgis barfing, children screeching, Hermione yelling at them to keep down the noise and Ron howling with laughter, somehow louder than them all.
“Ah.” Potter nodded, squeezed a smile that quickly fell. Then abruptly, he pushed himself up. “I should go change.”
“Did you know I didn’t come to Scotland right away when I left London?” Potter asked.
Harry shrugs. “There are pictures in it.”
The fire crackled. Potter had been talking. Something about the sheep, about Lettuce chasing Hannah too far over the hills until she panicked, until Potter commanded Lettuce back. Draco listened, distant. A mug of hot chocolate cradled loosely in his hands, tiny marshmallows floating on top. Potter looked at the hearth then back at Draco—his eyes catching the golden light of the fire. Holding the mug in his hands. Draco traced Potter’s nails at the back of his head. Blunt, the center tinting with the soft pink of a seashell.
Firelight bathed him in gold, traced the curled tips of his hair, glinted off the thin frame of his glasses, which had slid down his nose. Potter cradled his mug close, and with the reflected golden light it was difficult to tell if he’d closed his eyes or was simply gazing at the fire. Draco wondered if this was how an evening had looked like, too, before he stumbled in months ago. If Potter had also sat by the fire, had also relaxed in the armchair with his mug on his lap. If he’d also looked so simply content he was falling asleep.
He closes his eyes again.
“Well, I didn’t know if—I don’t know how…how…” Draco flushed. He’d never dated, was what he was trying to say. “I don’t know how couples deal with this thing.”
Draco laughed. Narcissa smiled, too.
“God.” Harry shut his eyes. “I missed you calling my name.”
“Malfoy.”
Pathetic. It’s a new low even for him.
“Alright, alright.” Potter ate another spoonful, unbothered. “Such impatience.”
She’d turned to him, then, the wine sparkling in her glass. It was the first time Draco ever wanted to punch a woman.
Harry came back on an ordinary August evening. Dusk had settled, purples and pinks blooming along the skyline; Draco had opened the windows, and the wind billowed past the pulled curtains and into the house, balmy air tinted with the sweetness of meadow grasses. He had rolled his sleeves up to his elbows, had buried his nose in the notes spilling all over the table. Was chewing the end of his quill, ink smeared on his wrist, trying to decide which heather field to bring their bees to when the door opened and Harry stepped in, wind-swept and tousled.
“Draco.” He swallowed. “Stay.”
“Hey,” Harry laughed, “Teddy likes sweets, too.”
“It’s odd,” Harry says, tipsy. “You know what Luna said the other day?”
Draco looks pained. “Not just that.”
Harry looks away. Hermione looks at him sadly. Ron sighs.
“No. These are the ones that need…err, extra care.” Potter knelt down again, and began to examine the mouth of a sheep. Seemed to be satisfied, tuned and grabbed the horns of another. “The rest are in the fells, though I guess…yeah, in the fells. We might need to bring them to lower shelter, though. It’s going to snow again, and if…”
The kitchen, too, was empty. On the side of the sink sat an illegible note which probably said something about helping himself to breakfast, so he found the small, cranky fridge that sat under a cupboard and pulled it open. Bottles of milk clinked, and in the middle sat half a stick of butter—nothing else. Irritated, he rummaged through the cupboards, through a strongly smelt ham and tins of tea until he found a dry, hard country boule in a basket, which he munched on and swallowed the best he could. All the while trying not to think about the fresh, hot coffee he could have had in his flat in London, toast, thick-cut orange marmalade. Tried not to think about his flat, his balcony that overlooked the city and stood beyond all busy traffic and bustling crowd, the rapid flow of movement. In the morning when the fog was still heavy, only the tips of buildings would be peeking out from the thick mist, the vague sharpness of grey. The sky translucent, the first of dawn radiating through the empty canvas, shining through with the first faint streak of blue—
Draco tried to look away. “I’m not upset.”
“It’s still here,” Ron says, surprised. The litter of kittens have all left for their new homes already.
Potter grinned.
The sun warmed the grounds. The fell side an embroidery, dotted with melting snow and patches of purple flowers. Buttery clouds piled at the far hills, softening everything in sight—as if dipped in milk. Draco inhaled, filled his lungs with the warm air. Closed his eyes. His hand resting on the short gate, in the middle of pushing it open. Late spring nestled close to his thin shirt, intimate.
“Maybe I just don’t like cooking.”
He spent hours staring at them. They were so real. Stared at them laughing, running, ruffling each other’s hair. Dancing in front of a marble fountain, hold sure and gentle, twirling so slowly as if they see only each other.
“What were you saying just then?” Harry mumbles into the nook behind Draco’s ears.
Potter smiled and shook his head, continued. “It’s high enough up here to feel like flying. There are higher grounds, you know, but I guess you can’t really get that high into the sky on brooms. So it doesn’t really feel like it. Flying, I mean.”
Draco retrieved the coffee. A tin of instant, looking untouched for months. He bit back a bitter insult and started looking for the kettle.
“Slow down, now,” he says, scratching behind the kitten’s ears. “No one’s rushing you.”
He turns on the tap with difficulty, using only one hand as the other has a handful of kitten. The kitten manages to squeeze itself loose and falls onto the ground, but before Harry can even shout out, it finds Harry’s most expensive shampoo—gifted by Ginny as a joke after one of her international games—and drapes itself all over the bottle. Harry’s loud protest dies on his tongue. He cannot believe what he is seeing.
They fell into comfortable silence. Draco looked out of the window, stretching his legs out in the nook. It was dusk, the sky bruised with a streak of yellow.
The words, so unapologetic coming from Draco’s lips. So bare, so simple.
“Oh my—” Harry’s eyes burn as the kitten splashes soapy water onto his face. “What’s the problem with you? Everything was just fine!”
Draco sighs and momentarily closes his eyes.
“No…tractor,” Potter said through heavy breaths. “Didn’t think you’d…get this far, you…bastard.”
Potter laughed. Draco followed and climbed onto the tractor as Potter nudged her on, and was still incredulous about it all when Potter started the engine.
“And we?”
“Yes,” Draco repeated. “I’d like to see your sheep. Do they stink?”
Back at home, Harry holds the sleeping kitten on his lap, stroking its head. He is ready to murmur a
There was something about watching Potter bottle-feed Cissy. Something about his mug-clad boots, about his water-proof jacket glinting off the warm lights with a faint hue, about his smile, just a barely-there curve—as if he didn’t notice he was smiling himself. Cissy, standing inside the ring of Potter’s folded legs, angled her head further and further as she suckled. Potter laughed and guided her back. She rapidly drained the milk from the bottle, the muscles at her stomach rippling. Potter’s hand was gentle but firm around her chin, keeping her head tilted and in place. Draco remembered the time he woke up to a hand at the back of his head, lifting. The palm fitting to the shape of it. He thought he understood, now, where the tenderness had come from.
Draco was reeled back. In his frightened silence, he had forgotten Potter’s presence. Now he couldn’t speak.
Draco stared at the spot long after he was gone.
Ah. London charms weren’t enough in Scotland, then.
“I want to hear you say it.”
“What’s making you so happy?” Draco asks, coming out of the kitchen with two piping mugs of tea. He sighs when he sees the wireless smothered against Harry’s belly. “You are a child.”
The half-day was spent in refining the last details of his latest portrait of Cho. Potter came back hours later and seemed surprised that Draco had woken himself up, as if he’d expected him to sleep well into the night. Before dinner he disappeared into his bedroom again and reappeared with, like he once had, a package. It looked like a box, and was wrapped neatly in cotton paper the color of jade and knotted with twine. In the center sat a grand, graceful bow-tie, its two wings like a butterfly.
The last bouquet Harry would ever make for him. He wants to say goodbye, in a way however small: a hug, a handshake, a squeeze on the shoulder. Some proof that all these mornings weren’t nothing, hadn’t simply existed in his half-baked dreams—that Draco had enjoyed them, too, had enjoyed his little shop and the flowers and, perhaps, his company.
“You can cook then, if you’re so good at it.”
“You need to eat something. At least drink water. I know you’re exhausted, but you can’t—”
Draco laughs again and turns Harry around. Three years later Harry still does not tire of it, watching Draco smile, the lines at the corner of his eyes crinkling as his cheeks fold—his face blossoming into the happiness. His pale eyes glint in the dusk. In the quietness of the moments before night there is only the sea, waves crashing ashore and breaking into thin foams.
“Oh!” Hermione exclaims. “Are you keeping it?”
He stopped by a violin displayed inside a glass case. The carvings were exquisite on the tailpiece and the pegs, the varnished wood amber underneath the lights.
The kitten is wrung out by the time Harry finally finishes. It lets Harry place it onto a towel without argument, lets Harry rub it dry. Faces Harry with its back as he looks for the hairdryer, won’t look at him as he plugs it in.
turned his head and looked outside the window. The lights were always smudged, as though they were voices and dampened, somehow. Soft by the edges, like halos. The last warmth of a fallen star.
Afterwards, Harry seemed ridiculously happy. They walked along the Thames, the back of their hands brushing. The air was warm. Pink clouds piled along the edge of the sky, above the running river reflecting the last of sunlight. At some point it was just them: no one else on the nearby bridge, no one else riding bikes down the pavement. Draco held Harry’s hand, then, and realized that it had softened. He stopped them, surprised, and brought Harry’s hands to his face. They smelt like rosemary.
“It’s okay,” he murmurs. He shifts down and curls himself around the kitten, so it is nestled at his belly. Rests his head on his folded arm. “It’s okay. It’s over now, see?”
“May I?” Harry jests, holding out a hand. Draco takes it and hauls himself up. They slot against each other like intricate machinery inside a grandfather clock: arms wrapped around each other, hands placed on the dip above their hips. Harry holds him carefully, lightly, because Draco could never stand a touch on night like these, but Draco simply leans his weight against Harry, like a sigh.
Now he was afraid.
Draco nodded even though he didn’t believe a word, opening his mouth up again.
, he’d told Draco then, wanting to punch them all.
Beside him, Draco turns another page. His reading glasses, which he got after a year and a half of stubborn protesting, sit at the bottom of his nose. The thin silver frame catches the sunlight and twinkles.
“Oh.” Potter laughed. “Lettuce is my sheepdog. The one sitting at the door? The Border Collie?”
He cannot stop thinking about his parents.
Dopily, Harry nestled closer. Under the covers Draco found his hand and linked their fingers together, tips to tips.
He remembered the words, spoke them without thinking. His voice hoarse, throat thick. “I’m…” Their lips brushed with every syllable, every faint puff of air. “I’m not trying to copy your looks.”
He’d washed his face in the bathroom. Potter noticed his red-rimmed eyes but said nothing. Now all that was left on his face was a clean grief, which was quickly forgotten after two mugs of wine. The living room was warm. Potter dug out an old wireless and turned it on, looping the same twelve Christmas carols over and over, old-fashioned and high-pitched. A small sapling of a pine tree was decorated and placed in the corner next to the hearth, flashing its golden lights to an imaginary rhythm. Draco, just for the sake of it, charmed the large and glittery baubles tiny and draped them over the rosemary. The tiny plant bent slightly underneath the weight but seemed rather happy about the ordeal.
Though sometimes he thinks he hears Draco tossing and turning in bed, mumbling. Frowning faintly, the way one would in a dream, as if uncertain whether it is reality. Harry tries to stop himself, but his hands reach out of their own accord, smoothing Draco’s furrowed brows. Draco relaxes a little and sinks deeper into the pillows, letting out a sigh.
“Which is cheating.”
said the silver plate underneath.
“Is this alright?” Harry whispered.
He didn’t even plant them. They were just there when he bought the terrace, all thin trunks and dark, waxy leaves. If he leaned out of the second floor balcony, he could touch the tips of the branches; if he looked down from the third floor balcony he could see the treetops, round and layered with thick leaves.
Harry picks up his copy of
Harry complained. Draco laughed and ruffled Harry’s hair.
Draco had seen it halfway up the hill. It was wondrous how his heart still pounded even in exhaustion, how he still worried his bottom lip before remembering, and stopped. Everything so familiar, coming back slowly but all at once. He pushed open the short gate—it had been fixed, the loose joint secured so it didn’t crook—and made his way to the front door. Standing under the patio, he took a deep breath. Knocked, then stood on the tip of his toes as he waited.
“Breathe, darling. I’m just joking.” Pansy took a sip of her martini and leaned forward. Her gaze was sharp, but kind. “Draco. Consider this: maybe Harry is a nice person, and he just wants to give you gifts.”
“I mean—”
Harry wants to trace his closed lids.
Potter was woken by the noise and, half-asleep, reached out and fetched the letter. They were mostly for him. Probably from Weasley and Granger, accompanied with a photograph of a sleepy Hugo, a crying Hugo, or a toothless laughing Hugo. Or from Dean Thomas, who kept Potter updated on his and Finnigan’s new two-story townhouse. They were going to paint the living room this week, had a skirmish about the colors and eventually compromised to paint two walls each with their color of choice.
Draco laughed shakily this time, looked away. “Merlin, Astoria.”
“No tractor?” he asked, hesitant and embarrassed.
“I didn’t say goodbye to her,” Draco whispered hollowly, as if to himself.
Then the stag, too, disappeared at last.
—quickly regains its balance and pretends nothing has happened.
levitate her—”
Draco blinked.
He fell in love with the lemon trees after that winter. The tiny suns, shining amid thick green leaves; the trees heavy with them, thin branches bending under their weight. He flipped through cook books borrowed from the library, looking for recipes with lemons: lemon soufflé, lemon shortbread cookies, lemon bars, lemon pudding. The terrace smelled of butter and lemons, warm with the humming oven. Harry tasted each of them, made noises as he closed his eyes and tilted his head back for prolonged periods of time, as though he was going to die from Draco’s desserts. It made Draco embarrassed and proud.
“I know it sounds scary. But we actually do have a high chance to succeed.” Khatri leans back and unfolds her hands. “How about this: go home, take a nap, and think about it. Owl me your response tomorrow. No matter what your choice is, we will find a solution and take care of him. Don’t worry.”
“But it all depends on what you want,” Luna continues, “Don’t you think?”
Draco chuckled. “That was a long time ago.”
Draco laughs. “That was totally on you.”
The bucket of sifted honey poured itself into the glass jars and filled them to the brim. Draco uncapped another heavy frame. Time did not exist in the warm, little shed, and when he lifted his head and noticed Harry standing by the doorframe—only then, did he notice the sun already setting.
Harry shakes his head.
Harry smiles at her, too. From the kitchen, Ron is humming a song Harry has heard on the wireless but cannot name. The kettle whistles. The tins of tea clink against one another as Ron rummages through them, the sound muffled.
The kitten doesn’t spare him a glance. It does, however, finally relax under the steady flow of air, under Harry’s gentle fingers combing through its fur. The white coat looks thicker now that it is cleaned, fluffier. This is a very beautiful kitten indeed.
“When you were six,” he mumbled, a reminder.
They washed each other and ended up kissing, rocking slowly, Harry pressed against the cold tiles. The spray down Draco’s side burned his skin red. His hands buried in Harry’s thick hair, finally tamed once under the cascading water. Harry’s mouth was hot, the sounds of their kissing dampened by the shower.
Draco’s breath held.
And there it was again. The soft ache, tugging at his sternum. Demanding.
Draco stares at a spot on the pillow. The bedroom is dark; shadows overlap and orchestrate over the corners, the walls, over Draco’s face. Harry cannot see him very clearly. Just the soft touches of lines, an idea, a stroke of a charcoal art. The sharp angles of his face smudged.
“Matching, Potter?” he asked, wiggling his toes. Potter winked.
“Baking?” Draco murmured. Buried the words to the soft skin of her neck.
Young logs crackled in the hearth, sending golden sparks flying.
Thomas had complained,
Draco’s lips parted.
The rosemary curled its tip around his finger. He stroked it, absent-minded.
“—nothing except for running water. Listen, I don’t want to be here, either. So can we just pretend we don’t know each other and make it through the next six months?” Draco trembled with rage, his fingers shaking as he pushed his plate away. “This stew is horrible.”
“See if I care.”
“I don’t pine, Ron.”
“We should travel together to some place,” Harry said.
Harry ruffles through the buckets of flowers in the cooler. “What are you looking for?”
“This is not how it is done,” Draco says, amused, “At all.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake!”
“I thought they were the same,” Harry interrupts, all honesty. Ron makes a horrified face as Hermione’s eyes widen before she launches into an incredulous speech on the differences between the
Potter huffed a laugh. “I don’t know why I even ask.”
Harry doesn’t get it. Turns over, is ready to ask what Ron means when suddenly it clicks—Ron’s tinged cheeks, looking away—and his mouth drops.
“Potter, drop it.” Draco straightened up. “I was being dramatic last night. It was nothing, I wasn’t offended, alright?”
Draco smiled. Harry’s laughter was warm and familiar, even through the messy statics over the wire. He clutched the phone closer to his chin and let out a soft breath.
“Is it some kind of pureblood tradition to not talk about it? It’s alright, you know. Ron and Hermione are married, too. Have a kid already. And Hermione’s pregnant again.”
Draco nodded. He put the wedge of orange into his mouth; the fruit burst into juice on the tip of his tongue, bright and sweet and sour. The dull, swelling ache in his stomach began to soften, as though soothed.
“And you?” Harry asked, voice low and quiet.
“How’s everything going?”
“Tell me about it,” Draco said, quiet and frantic and desperate. He could barely breathe. “Harry—”
“No, you dolt—” Harry yelps again—“Apparently it’s on the back of my head!”
Draco blinked.
The stew tasted better than everything he’d eaten in the past week combined. Potter teased him for cooking stew wholly out of spite. Draco solemnly denied. The wine was corked and spilled a little before it was poured into the mugs, and Draco had to refrain from cringing at drinking wine straight from mugs—albeit a cheap one—but eventually the world blurred and lost focus, like an old camera.
Draco huffed. “It would have been exhilarating.”
The kitten looks at him unblinkingly. There is something in its gaze, something in its unwavering blue and grey eyes—then, slowly, it presses a paw to Harry’s mouth.
The soft ache intensified into a blooming demand. Draco tried to make light of it, tried to laugh. “For inadequate techniques?”
Potter smiled, exasperated. Draco swirled his mug. The wine glinted off the firelight like amber.
He turns and pops open his last resort. It is salmon and his most expensive brand, usually saved only for the last meal before his fostering kittens have to leave for their new, permanent homes. It is now this kitten’s first meal in this household. What a bad message that gives, but Harry’s head hurts too much for him to think.
He doesn’t stay
Walking the streets made his head hurt.
“Dance with me?” Harry teases, taking the wineglass from his hands. Draco smiles and lets himself be pulled to the corner, where Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s waist and begins to sway them to the music.
“It’s a hammock,” Harry said. Sweating, panting from the effort of climbing the steep, winding roads that curved through the hills, the heavy bundle relentlessly slipping from underneath his arm. He was so hot he had to take off his jacket, even though the April air was still chilly—then the jacket wouldn’t stop slipping, either, taking turns with the hammock.
“Christmas gift,” Draco said flatly, but was unable to hide the blush creeping along his neck. The guilt. “I cannot take it. I did not…I didn’t get you—”
“Err, me? And you just did, too.”
Draco squeezed his wrist.
Blushing fiercely, Draco covered Harry’s hand with his—looked away in abashment only to throw a quick glance at Harry, whose smile widened. Draco looked away, but traced the rough edges of Harry’s fingers, his blunt nails. His large hand, underneath his.
“I’m fine.”
Weak, but alive.
The sheep.
would have enjoyed it immensely.”
“60 dollars,” Draco says. “What can I get?”
Tiny marshmallows, too, floated on top of Potter’s hot chocolate.
Draco thought he saw stars.
“She said I wasn’t happy,” Draco spoke, quiet. “Sometimes, it still sounds like an excuse to me.”
Panic was a distant thing, rising through thick fog as he watched himself destroy everything he’d worked for for the past decade. He wanted to scream but couldn’t. Wanted to hang on but couldn’t. So he walked laps at night until he couldn’t feel anything through his frozen cheeks, couldn’t even speak without slurring. Arrived at the office last minute next morning with coffee and heavy bags under his eyes. He’d survive. He just needed to make it through today. It was going to be okay. He watched his feet take one step after another in the cold night, wondering, wondering. This seemed to be the only thing still going on in his life. His feet, lifting and falling forward. Again, and again, and again.
“Alright, fine!” Harry snaps, the tension of waiting at St. Mungo’s for a whole afternoon finally wearing him down. “Stay there if you want to so much!”
“Harry. Please.”
“What is it?”
She placed a light hand on his arm.
Draco let himself be pulled close, his warm body flush against Harry’s. It didn’t feel as cold, then, standing against the wind.
It’s frightening, how he holds his breath at the sight of this man. How his heart pounds in his ribcage, wild and at peace all the same. Frightening, how much Draco looks like he belongs here: right here on Harry’s bed, cheek pressed into the pillows, blanketed in the early morning light. Strange, too, how Harry feels like he knows so much about him yet at the same time, he knows nothing at all. How he falls back into breathless astonishment the instant he sees him again after two and a half months.
“It’s okay,” Harry says, ignoring the quick beats of his heart. “It’s not like you’re actually Draco or something. It’s nothing. I’ve been here so many times and nothing’s ever gone wrong.”
“Draco.”
“You’re happy,” she said when Draco came to a pause. “I’m glad.”
“I am! I know I am.” Draco took a shaky breath. “I know I am. Stop pretending it’s nothing, stop lying to yourself—”
Around them, the baubles of light danced to a meandering waltz. Hovered above and away from Potter, softening the lines of his face in a golden glow.
“Alright, alright.” Potter lay back onto his folded arms. “Err, let me see…ah. Okay, so. A centaur walks into a bar…”
“Yes, I mean, sure.”
“No. They…they always made me cook. I always burn one thing or another, and that’s what I get to eat.” Potter let out a laugh. “Once it was when…when one of Uncle Vernon’s managers visited, I think. I burnt the peas. For a whole month all I had to eat was canned tomato soup. I wanted to vomit whenever I smelt tomatoes at school for the rest of the year.”
“Did you knit your socks yourself?”
“Ugh, fine,” Harry grumbles. He picks the kitten up and places it onto his shoulder. The kitten forcefully balances itself by claws and sheer will, but it isn’t any less encouraged as Harry steps out into the open street. It takes everything in as they go: the sunlight spilling through leaves, dancing on the pavement of the quiet alley. The birds chirping, the clouds floating, a man in a varsity jacket walking on the other side of the street with a handful of grocery bags. The edges of the thick foliage of trees, turning red and orange with the first hint of autumn as if dipped in paint, a half-finished artwork. The kitten climbs onto Harry’s head to meow loudly at the birds jumping through branches. Harry laughs.
Because he didn’t want to. It was a stupid question to ask, even stupider to answer. Potter saw through it; the hard lines of his face softened. “Draco. You can’t hide here forever.”
Potter didn’t follow.
“That doesn’t even make sense.”
Harry sighed and walked into the house for the telephone.
Draco swallowed and tried to smile, even though Harry couldn’t see him. It fell. “It’s alright. I started another book.”
Draco refused to believe it was for him.
“It was worse than I thought it would be,” he said quickly, now wrapping his scarf, “I need to bring them to the shelter on the backside of the fell. Go back to sleep, eh?”
Astoria tilted her head. Then, deciding to let it go, she placed her cup down and leaned forward. “Tell me about Scotland. I’ve always wanted to visit.”
“No it really isn’t.”
The roast was slightly burnt. After dinner they repeated what they’d done the previous night, the Christmas spirit jolly in the air with mulled wine, falling asleep an hour earlier. The blizzard loomed at the corner and finally decided to hit two days later. It raged overnight, rattling the windows against their frames and startling Draco from his shallow sleep on the couch. Draco, bleary-eyed, caught only fractions of it: of chilliness seeping in through the windows, of the fire swaying and dimming before burning ablaze once again.
“How can you do this?” Draco asked, trembling.
“Prove it, then.” He tears the beer mat into its last shreds, loosens his fingers. The pieces land softly on the table. He looks up. “Prove that what you say is true.”
Potter sighed softly, an understanding. Draco hated this, too, hated that he saw through him like an open book. Hated that he understood, that he wasn’t just pretending to.
“Yes. Okay.”
Draco touched his cheek self-consciously. Potter just continued to smile at him with faint amusement, shook his head. “Let’s go, shall we?”
“Sits only on the best cushions.”
“Are you doing this because we have dated? Because you feel sorry for me if we talk about it? Guilty?”
The kitten meows loudly and calls Harry back to reality. He picks it up and unloads it onto his old, battered hoodie. It has become the kitten’s permanent bed now.
Draco’s lips parted. Then he registered that it was, in fact, on the other side of the stream.
He and Harry had been exchanging letters for nearly a year now. Every now and then he wondered what it would have been like if he’d stayed in Scotland and not returned. No art exhibition, that was for sure. But perhaps he wouldn’t have minded that much.
Harry blinks.
Potter sank back into the armchair. “Quite, yeah.”
you by trying to make up for everything with mere words, but—” Draco is talking, his voice trembling— “I’m sorry. And I do not expect you to forgive me, or wait for me, but if you are…no, if you will still take me, I—”
“That’s taking advantage of the knowledge I have.”
Harry swallows. “It will damage their magical core?”
Draco laughed. This, this was as he remembered. “It probably is. I’ve been back for a little more than two weeks, I think.”
Harry tossed a small box to Draco, who caught it reflexively.
“Thirty to twelve.”
Harry strokes the small of his back.
“Well, Draco, obviously.”
“But were you?”
—Harry, leaning against the door frame in the setting sun, in the golden amber of the little shed, in the reflected glow of the honey, walking close, his face warm with a smile—
Harry looked at him with a faint smile.
He was making up for not giving Draco birthday gifts for the first twenty years of their lives.
“London. Why do you stay here if you miss them that much?” Draco couldn’t understand. “Why don’t you go back?”
“I want to.”
He brought them home. Cast heating charms, rubbed them dry, tried to warm them up and tubed them milk. The kittens recovered after several hours. Their eyes not even opened yet, they crawled with tiny legs over the blankets, searching. Their meows so thin he would’ve missed it if he’d spoken a word, if he’d whispered.
“But—”
He falls asleep with a ball of steady warmth against his chest.
He blindly reaches for his glasses, puts them on. Opens his eyes again.
He turned, and Harry was gone.
He felt Potter’s gaze before he heard his boots crunching in the snow. Draco chose not to say anything. He heard Potter shooing the sheep away, could imagine Potter nudging them away with his knee. Then, tentative, Potter sat down next to him.
Draco said, “You were courting me.”
“What—” Harry cuts her rambling voice off— “What?”
They took their time on bed. Both half-naked, Draco sat on the edge of the bed as Harry, knelt between his legs, tucked his trousers off inch by inch. He kissed Draco’s inner thigh, trailed his way up—his beard scratching the warm and tender skin. Draco gasped, hands clutched tight in Harry’s hair. Gasped as he was pinned into the soft bed, underneath the hot weight of Harry’s body. His chest was so full he could combust. His limbs singing, his own body expiring as he wondered, through a haze, if he would ever not lose himself in this. If this would ever not fill him to the brim.
“No. The sheep.”
“Morning,” Harry murmured into his mouth. His hand in Draco’s hair, slow and light.
Harry smooths his fingers down the kitten’s back following the warm flow of air as it falls asleep.
Hermione’s face morphs into sadness. She squeezes Harry’s arm. “No, not really. Why?”
Harry replied after this recent news, no doubt smug.
A part of him, locked deep where sunlight couldn’t penetrate, screamed desperately at being back in the same place all over again. Drowning in sorrow, in memories he couldn’t touch if he reached out. At having spent so long, so long, trying—trying to move on, only to turn his head and find himself in the same place still.
“I’ve missed you, too,” Harry whispered, then kissed him.
Potter laughed again, bright and open. From afar emerged the tiny cottage. It was only a grey dot among the vast white, but closer he could see the stone walls, the roof. The jagged, thin line of surrounding wooden fences, the crooked gate. Potter turned the wheel, spilling up snow from under the tires.
“I cook you dinner,” Draco argued. Potter’s eyes had already drifted to the mulled wine.
In his dreams, the sunflowers are always vivid.
“But you’ll move on,” Potter said. He was looking at him again. “Trust me. It might not feel possible right now, and healing might not…healing isn’t what you picture it is. You know about it. It’s not a happy forever and thinking back occasionally with a—a wistful expression. It’s living with it, and…and someday, loving someone again.”
His fingers had trembled by Draco’s jaw the night he kissed him.
“Of course she did.” Harry laughed, too, a sound full of statics on the other side of the telephone. “But Teddy was frightened, I think. His ears are now goldfish fins and they wouldn’t turn back. He’s been hiding in his room.”
“Maybe he has too much money and wants to throw them around,” Pansy said.
The next week, spring arrived. Pear blossoms covered every tree and sidewalk like a layer of snow, the last of the season.
Two days later, they died.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said, wrecked. Reached back until he grabbed the door handle and pushed, stormed in. Slammed the door back.
“So,” he coughs, “you’re leaving.”
“Did it cost you three hundred Galleons this time?”
“Three days?”
Draco started, turned. Potter leaned against the door frame. Shook his head when he saw Draco ready to apologize, smile faint.
“You’ll see.”
“Come on. Dress up.”
Harry asked, voice thick with sleep, “What cookies are you baking?”
“It’s for you. So you can contact your family, your job, or…your friends, I don’t know. You’re going to be here for a long time.”
Spoons clinked in the silence.
“Luna made the quilt,” Potter said, with the hint of a smile.
Potter laughed. The corner of his eyes crinkled with his smile. “The first thing you say when you finally can talk again is to criticize my bed?”
Potter waved his wand and, one by one, sent his coats and layers of shirts and vests to the railing by the burning hearth, where they hung themselves by the fire. Potter sat down beside Draco with a huff, grabbed the jar of cider from the short table in front of them—which sat on a ragged rug, each wooden leg scraped or chipped—and poured some into a mug. Handed it to Draco.
“No,” Draco said. The strange smile tugging at his lips a moment ago slipped away, and all that came out was a choked sound. Draco closed his eyes, tired. “I want to go back.”
The short grass, sprouted in patches and still wet from the rain, dampened the rim of their trousers. On the ground still lay snow that hadn’t melted. Lettuce jumped by Potter’s side, jogging in small steps as they headed back to the cottage. The air tingled with a trace of chilliness, still clinging onto the last of winter.
Draco’s smile softens. Reaching up, he touches Harry’s cheek. “So many more.”
They owned fourteen hives, a handful of potted orange trees, and a little house on the rolling hills of Derbyshire. In the little house they each owned their separate bedrooms, which they each had decorated separately.
Harry laughs, empty. “Too late.” He picks up a beer mat and starts tearing it into pieces. He is beginning to regret not ordering liquor when he had the chance. “You should have said that two months ago.”
“I can feel your smiles here,” Draco whispered.
Beside him, Draco bit his lip. His fingers trembled slightly. Harry wanted to kiss him, wanted to pull him close and wrap him in his arm. Draco, who wanted to hold the bees barehand even though he was scared, even though it was perfectly fine to don a full bee suit. Draco, who came to Harry and said, quiet and terrified and determined, that he wanted to try.
“Oh.” Harry focuses on cutting the paper so he doesn’t have to meet Draco’s eyes. “So the bouquet. It’s a question.”
“Indulge me,” Harry said again. He was smiling, looking into Draco’s eyes. “Please?”
Draco shakes his head, still dazed. Lips still parted.
The kitten blinks slowly. Harry smoothes a hand down its face, flattening its ears to its head. He laughs softly at the kitten’s round face. The kitten makes a noise and tries to escape. Licks his fingers, tongue rough against his fingertips.
“It’s totally not,” Ron argues, knocking thrice on the wooden coffee table. “Stop cursing our wedding, Hermione.”
Harry reaches out, then, and cups Draco’s face. Strokes his cheek with his thumb. Draco exhales, closes his eyes, and leans into the touch.
Draco’s cheeks burned. Harry laughed and pulled him in, as Draco burrowed his face into Harry’s neck. Harry curled his fingers into the short hair at his nape, stroked.
“This is Luna,” Potter said as one of the sheep munched away a cake from his palm. Her horns curled twice around her head. “She’s one of the oldest. She must’ve led them here, they would’ve starved otherwise.”
Cho baaed at him, then morphed into Lettuce who charged, leapt, fangs bared—Draco stumbled back, fell into the snow, found himself at the edge of a forest. A fox burst from powdered snow. Draco followed it into the forest when suddenly Potter stood in front of him, so close he could see the tiny scratches on his glasses. His face dirty, his Muggle jacket loose, telling him to stay here, just go back to sleep, eh? He’d be back, he’d be back right away—the bright green of an
“If you think coming back will change anything,” Draco continued, “you’re wrong. I’ve moved on.”
“They bite you is what happens!” Draco stared at Potter incredulously. “Hurts like hell, let me tell you. Half of the healing spells cast on me was because I got bit.”
It was Harry Potter.
“Alright,” he said.
By the door stands Malfoy, who shuffles in.
“You never told me.”
“Look,” Draco said.
Potter sent a
“Ah. There is a lot you don’t know.”
“Marshmallows, Potter.”
Only after dinner did Potter emerge from his bedroom with a parcel in hand. He stuffed it into Draco’s hands with a shallow smile. “Go on.”
Cho’s labor came to a standstill. Potter couldn’t get his hands in and help with the three centimeter dilation. They waited in the barn, but when the afternoon dwindled towards its end and Cho stood, frantic and panting and still unable to move things along, Potter called the vet. The vet wouldn’t be persuaded to come. Potter sent one
He gives up on the letter and picks the kitten up, flopping them both onto the bed. The kitten lets out a startled
“Skipping the party, Potter?”
“Are there a lot of foxes out here?” Draco asked once Potter picked him up on the tractor. Potter turned the wheel with the hint of a smile.
Cissy bleated loudly at the intruder. Potter, nonplussed, walked over.
Maybe that is where the sunflowers stemmed from. The dreams. Ever since the war ended, sometimes he thinks he recalls a vague memory: of sunflower fields, of a woman with bright copper hair grinning at him. He doesn’t know why, or how, but he can taste the sea in the air. The faint tinge of salt, sharper than all the blocks of colours combined.
“They’re insane,” Draco mutters.
“Nope.”
“Hey, hey. Sh. What’s up?” He blearily scratched her ears and checked the time. She had just been fed, so she shouldn’t be hungry—he pressed a hand to her belly. It was, as expected, warm from milk.
“Rose. A darling babe.” Potter smiled, as if to himself. It made Draco lost for a moment. Then Potter turned his attention back to Draco, and it was gone. “Well? Information exchange. What about Astoria?”
Thin, bony—as he always has been, as Harry always has known him—yet in his arms, he is warmer than Harry has ever realized. Harry’s throat dries. His mouth opens—
He’d started cooking just to prove a point—
“Well,” Harry says, turning around. His face burns in the cool, moist air of the cooler. “The cleomes just came in today. I’ll pair them with some baby’s-breaths, if you’d like.”
“Do you miss them?” Draco asked. Potter tilted his head. “Your friends, I mean. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you apart in Hogwarts.”
Harry’s was chewing, voice muffled through a mouthful of bread. “What?”
—pointed vivaciously to something on the board with his wand. Draco couldn’t hear a word. It piled and piled and piled until it spilled—
Harry bites his bottom lip and, one by one, he pries the kitten’s tiny paws off. It screams and kicks wildly as the Healer struggles to hold it in her gloved hands.
Draco felt like he should say something.
“A prestigious kitten.”
“No. No, this is
“Yeah, well.” Harry shrugs. “I haven’t put it up for adoption. Yet.”
Then he saw the photograph.
“Draco.”
The rest of the flock could only be reached after a long, bumpy ride on Potter’s tractor. The hills rolled back on both sides, a sea of white. Draco could not register a single turn, and would not have recognized his way back had he been left here, but Potter seemed to know his way around and turned the steering wheel with ease. Potter cursed when they arrived at a wooden gate half buried in snow, collapsed underneath the weight, jumped off the tractor—trudged over with difficulty. He pulled the crooked gate straight, tightened the knot on top, and settled for the temporary solution.
“You sure have a lot of pureblood stereotypes.” Draco paused. “Take away the grapes and insert wine. That would be more apt.”
“No,” Harry sobbed. “No, I’m not crying.”
“I didn’t know whether you wanted me to.”
Harry couldn’t say
The walk was brisk, the morning air crisp. Harry cannot keep up with Draco’s long legs. Draco walks rapidly, as though he has an appointment, the heels of his shoes clicking against the pavement as he rattles on without losing his breath. Harry stumbles along, bumps into Draco when he turns a corner—and there they were, in front of the doors of Draco’s flat.
“I’m not trying to copy your looks,” Draco said. The words strung at an odd angle, forcibly pushed out of his mouth. The empty shell of a joke.
“What is tradition, anyway?”
Draco scowls. He now loathes any mentioning of age; the growing wrinkles on his face are reminders enough. They are swaying, gently, lightly, as if they are not swaying at all. From inside the cottage floats soft music, wafting in the warm air, dipping between meadow grasses.
How he missed hearing his own name from Harry’s mouth.
“I don’t have to go back. It’s meaningless, anyway. I can stay here with you. I don’t have to…” Draco took a shuddery breath and looked away. “It’s nonsense. Never mind.”
“What,” Potter kept asking, amused. “What?”
“Potter,” Draco swallowed, “I…I don’t have my gallons with me, I can’t—”
He woke up an hour before dawn, muzzy and confused. The bed was much more comfortable than what he was used to. Disoriented, to find himself not facing the quiet hearth but stained walls instead, with its bookshelf and thin booklets, the thick books barely held together at their spines. He closed his eyes again. The morning was quiet, needless for thoughts. Minutes later, it landed like a feather: ah. Potter’s room.
Evidence: he kept giving Draco presents.
Draco woke in cold sweat.
Joe grins as he slices the bacon with practiced ease. He finishes, wipes his hands on his apron, and hands the brown paper bag to Harry—
“I’m sorry.”
Then he cooked dinner.
its own face clean—after Harry laughed at its chubby belly and it grumpily nipped at Harry’s hand—Harry brings it to the bathroom for a bath. The kitten clearly knows what Harry has in mind, because it starts screaming the moment they enter the bathroom. Harry tries to grab hold of it as it kicks him, claws unsheathed, and tries to climb over Harry’s shoulder.
Draco smears a streak of flour across his cheeks, brows furrowed.
Harry shut him up with a kiss, like Draco meant for him to. A slow drag of lips, as if making up for lost time. And how much time they had lost to his own foolishness, to his own pride, his cowardice. He wanted to pull away and apologize. Tell Harry how much of a fool he was. The soft ache tugged at his chest again, the very center of him, a thin thread. Draco wanted to tell him everything. How much he’d longed for him, all those months wasted—
is proper posture?”
They are still the same eyes Harry had looked into thirty, fifty, seventy years ago: the grey of the soft feathers of a dove, of a sky moments before dawn. An eternity of its own in this brief, capricious world. In the sunlight they melt into pools of silver, twinkling with mirth.
“My socks?” Potter wiggled his toes, a slow movement. “So what if I did?”
me, this is entirely your fault!”
. The silver stag galloped from across the fell with wisps of glittering light. Slowed, taking small steps until it reached Draco.
The rain had stopped. The dampness, though, lingered like a temptation for another downpour. The air dropped cool with a bone-seeping chilliness. Draco shivered. In his hurry, he had forgotten his coat at the barn. He tried to cast wordless warming charms as they walked to the tractor, as the muddy ground clung to his boots, but none of them worked. He was never good at wordless. Draco tried again and again, the tingling warmth of his magic slipping into the cold air with every incantation—
Looking at Draco, Harry wants to go home. Now. His flat is no longer empty, no longer silent. Their mugs sit alongside each other in the cupboards, and on the couch Harry can close his eyes and find the indent where he always pushes his feet underneath Draco’s thighs, where Draco always tilts his head against the edge when he sits on the floor and lets Harry comb his hair. He no longer counts the cracks in the ceiling. Every morning he wakes to a soft snore beside him and occasionally, an insistent paw kneading his cheek. Every time a thunderstorm hits, he wraps them both in a blanket and Draco in his arms, and murmurs into Draco’s hair until the storm passes and they fall asleep to the lingering, pattering rain.
know, and he gives up on the idea.
Murmurs, “What are you looking at?”
Harry’s neck was warm, smooth, a lovely nook. Draco buried his nose deeper. The city slowly woke under daylight, the street lamps extinguishing. Down the park, the earliest of birds chirped.
“He can turn back into a human,” Harry says, watching the kitten munch on another kernel. “That’s probably why.”
“You poor soul.” Harry laughed, too. “Indulge me?”
“Do you want to read it together?” He chuckles. “Can you even read a book?”
“No—”
Draco licked his lips.
Draco stared blankly at him. He hadn’t even noticed it was New Year’s Eve.
“Wait, specialists?” Harry says, dumbfounded.
“I haven’t tidied it,” Draco says, working the keys, flushed. “But I don’t think you need to close your eyes—”
Draco himself had received several letters from work, hinting at his supposed return and not so subtly threatening about consequences, mentioning his Death Eater past as if it were an afterthought, an ugly smile baring fangs. Draco ignored all of them.
Potter laughed. “They were horrible. I think I burnt my arm at least twice a week.”
“That’s not how it works!”
He still cannot quite put it together. Is he still allowed to touch the kitten? To stroke its back, to scratch its ears, to cuddle it? Certainly Draco would never allow him to if he were a human. Is he still allowed to do all that when Draco is a kitten?
“You’re welcome.”
“Nope.”
Harry found him, sometimes, when he paced about in the dead of the night.
“Yes,” Harry said, warm. He kissed Draco on the cheek. “I love it here.”
“A potioneer or a gardener?” The old man asked.
Draco stared into his eyes.
The shop owner died in the Battle of Hogwarts.
“Oh, no. That’s not what I meant.” Khatri laughs and folds her hands together. “He is quite extraordinary. Not a kitten at all, in fact. He is a wizard stuck in his
Suddenly, without taking his eyes off the book, Draco mutters, “Focus, Potter.”
Potter took a heartfelt swig. “Wonders never cease, Malfoy.”
He wanted liquor. Potter wouldn’t give it to him and stuffed him with cider and hot chocolate instead, but still, every night after Potter had gone to bed, Draco rummaged through the kitchen. He couldn’t fall asleep sober. Could only stare at the empty ceiling, at the faded yellow stains spreading out like petals until dawn crept its way in. Just a little wine. Potter hid the bottles under concealment charms and, after the third night, brought them to his room for good measure.
Harry pulled Draco’s knotted fingers apart and spread them, took each hand into his own. Folded, the way a knight would a maiden’s before he kissed her knuckles.
“Well. It has never exactly come up in conversations, has it?”
“Hey.”
“Lily-in-the-valley?”
Harry took him to the kitchen, had him sit down, and heated milk for him. Draco picked his thumb, head hung low. Harry stirred spoons of honey into the warm milk and handed the mug to Draco.
“Yeah, I’m sure he does.”
Embarrassed, Draco tried to hide his blush by turning his head back to the pens, seeking. “Which one is Lettuce?”
“Something special. It is a note.”
“We can grow tomatoes.” Harry pulled Draco close by the waist. “We can grow strawberries. Don’t you like strawberries?”
In the end Draco won, and he had Harry make them two cups of hot chocolate with floating marshmallow snowmen. Harry grumbled. Draco made up to Harry by making the mulled wine. They lounged by the hearth, baked themselves warm by the crackling fire, drinking the spiced wine in mugs. Draco’s cheeks were warm and fuzzy. His toes tingled. The firelight lapped on Harry’s face and messy hair and bathed his skin in warm gold.
“Are you planning to resume anytime soon?”
“Who drinks hot chocolate without marshmallows?”
“Do you have anything to do this moment?”
Draco, head muzzy, tried to find a comeback. Instead a warm hand threaded through his hair and lifted his head, palm fitting to the shape of it. Draco panicked.
“It is a snowman!” Cheeky. Then, “Hey, why is it only
“Chocolates!” Delighted. Then, his face paling, “Grands Crus from Pierre Marcolini.”
“Whu’…” Draco yawned, tried to check the time. “Whu’ time is it?”
“Come on!” he yelled, slipping out of the seat. “The last one to the front door is a baby mandrake root!”
It was with the same dream-like quality that he stood among his work, watching his colleagues disappear and reappear through the partitions. Dream-like, too, when he saw Harry standing in front of one portrait, head tilted. For a moment he thought that it must really be a dream, for it was impossible for Harry to be here. He wanted it to last, though. So he watched, silently willing the dream not to end, until Harry glimpsed him and grinned.
Draco stormed off. His boots were too heavy to run through the snow so he trudged, dragged himself as he wiped at his cheeks. He didn’t even feel the tears, his mind numbed with fury. The cold wind bit his cheeks, bit frozen the wet traces of tears.
“Where did you get this?”
“Is that so?” Harry whispered back. Turned, fit his mouth to the inside of Draco’s wrist, murmured. “I’m old, then.”
“What?” Harry asks, bewildered. “What do you want?”
Something flapped at the window. Potter went over and pushed the windows open—a barn owl. It landed on the table and flapped its wings, thin eyes blinking.
Potter recounted his journey on his fingers, one by one. His hand was bigger than Draco’s, rougher. The back of it covered in hair. The hints of healed cuts slit messily through the firm of his palm.
Then, softly, Draco kisses him.
“It’s a goldfinch,” Draco said, twisting the telephone cord between his fingers. “No, it’s another one. It’s about a detective.”
The kitten is apparently confused. It sniffs suspiciously at the can before it violently nudges it away, almost sending it to the floor. Harry stumbles as he catches the can. “Hey!”
The market bustled with people and Christmas carols. Men bargained in turkey shops, kids marveled at floating magical trinkets. Cinnamon buns gleamed underneath warm lights, candied almonds gleamed in glass tins, and in people’s hands steamed hot pies, sausages and hot chocolate. Shops packed tight alongside one another, selling a house of Christmas decorations, handmade dolls, wooden crafts… Potter bought a stuffed pie and chewed, asking Draco whether he wanted one with a mouthful.
Draco remembered every insult he’d thrown during his teenage years and cried even more. Potter swayed them slowly, slightly, from side to side. Draco felt it like a distant lullaby until he tired out. Potter led him to bed, sat himself on the edge as Draco climbed onto the duvets, curling into a ball against the headboard.
Draco did not particularly like lemons, then, or the flavor of lemons or the scent of lemons or even the color yellow. That winter, the harvest was bounteous: the garden full of lemons, bright like jewels hidden amidst thick foliage, a hint of yellow as the leaves rustled with the wind. They glowed in the cold rain when it poured. The fruit were heavy in his hands when he picked them, the faint scent of citrus lingering at his fingertips long after. A basket of tiny suns sitting on his kitchen table amid the months of incessant grey.
“Anyway,” Ron cuts her off when she pauses to take a breath, “As I was saying, you’re best man. As such, you are allowed to bring a date.” Ron winks. “Just don’t steal the thunder from us.”
Harry is over the stage of aching madness. Now he just wants Draco to leave. Draco has no right showing up in front of him two months later, acting as though nothing happened and they can just go back to fucking.
“It has a garden.”
A sheep suddenly wrenched the hay off his hands. Draco started. The sheep was unimpressed and chewed slowly as she stared at him.
he says, surprised.
“How can you say this,” he asked, touching a finger to the silver plate, “when you are the one who left?”
“Harry. Harry.”
Draco swallowed the mouthful of toast.
“Yeah,” Harry said, a smile in his voice. “I am going to take you to Wales, just like the first time we went out together. Remember? I’ll take you to that ice cream shop again, and I’ll order raspberry-flavor for you. It’s going to be such a nice day, the sky is going to be so clear. The air is going to be so fresh. It’s going to be such a beautiful day.”
Potter chuckled as he scribbled something down. “Aren’t there blizzards in London, too? Don’t tell me they discriminate between nations.”
“Then what are you doing?”
“And you have the audacity to joke!” Draco bristled. “Not again! Never again! Circe forbid I ever fall asleep before you do again, I will make sure you get to bed—
“Yes. All of them. It was quite breathtaking, really. Especially when they flaunt.” Draco swirled the cider, drank a little. “Such a pity you’ve never seen them. They don’t look like they belong to this world at all, what with their tails all out…like ghosts. Do you know peacocks fly? Not so high but, still. When you have a tree of white peacocks staring you down with their red eyes, and they take off…it’s magnificent. They look like they are all royals and they know it. The grace and intimidation…all come so naturally. Like it’s in their blood to expect others to bow to them, knowing they—they will.”
“Just come.”
The following silence was dense. Potter sensed it, and smiled faintly at Draco—but Draco saw it now, the tension in it. The tension in his shoulders. Potter downed the rest of his wine, head tilted back, Adam’s apple bobbing. He seemed to want to slam the mug but didn’t know where to. Dropped his arm to the floor instead.
Harry blinks.
Draco looked at him, then back at the hills of heather. For a couple minutes they simply sat. Hands joined loosely on the gear, beside each other. Then Harry slipped out of his seat with a huff. Draco followed.
“Oh, I won’t. I’ll be proper. I’ll follow all the etiquette.”
“Hey,” Potter said again. “It happens. It happens, I’m…I’m sorry.”
“You alright?” Potter asked. He didn’t look particularly concerned as he shrugged his coat off. “Do you remember anything? Getting lost in this hell of a blizzard, maybe? You were barely conscious when I found you. Brought you back and told you to drink some cider...I think you fell right asleep, though. Did you hear that part?”
It was bizarre, too, that for all their discussion about finding themselves and not wasting their lives it was Harry who insisted he come back. Draco remembered the day; it was hard to forget. Second morning, waking up slightly disoriented on Harry’s bed. His heart warming as he noticed Harry looking at him already, his green eyes clear in the morning lights. A kiss, clumsy with sleep but still had his heart speeding, a little doe bumping against his ribcage. Everything was new and giddy. Every time Harry reached for his hand he grinned helplessly.
The exhibition had started as an accident. A joke, almost, or so Draco thought. His colleague two doors down glimpsed the tiny portrait of Cho he’d kept in his wallet, marveled at how good it was, to which Draco nodded awkwardly in response. The colleague—Michael
The kitten finds his face and, as if discovering new territory, tentatively touches a paw onto his chin. Harry chuckles. He rolls over, cages the kitten between his two arms, and reaches for the stack of letters Draco has written him since their endeavour started. He’s kept them all on his nightstand. It is reassuring, in a way, for them to be the last thing he sees before closing his eyes every night.
decision since she will be the one walking the isle?
“Hey,” Potter warned. “Watch it—”
“Draco?”
They were so close.
“Don’t you need a new sweater?” Harry asked.
“I miss her, too,” Draco whispered as Potter tightened his arms, pulled him closer. Draco swallowed. Shut his welling eyes. Held Potter tighter. “I miss her, too.”
The sky had darkened into a deep purple, clear. Here at the countryside where the Manor was located, they had the whole night sky to themselves.
The kitten protests loudly and clings onto the bottle. Harry pries its tiny paws off, and has to use a charm to muffle his ears before the kitten deafens him with its screams. It relaxes, however, once it is placed under the thin, steady stream of warm water. Under Harry’s fingers as he rubs soap down its neck, down its back and thin body, working through the knots and loosening the fur.
Draco said, eyes still closed, “The bees like it here, I think.”
Two days before Christmas found Potter standing excitedly at the door, buttoning up his coat. He’d come back later than usual, and Draco, having come back for some time and was stealing biscuits from the kitchen, came out to inspect. Potter had on a different coat: the black wool neat and firm, collar folded up at the back and flattening down the front into a deep V. Lining down the middle were buttons the color of fine ivory. Potter’s usual one, smudged and dirtied and wet with the now-melted snow, was hung up on the rail at its usual place.
The faint crunching of snow under boots. Draco clutched his arms.
“I know, darling.”
Seconds later, he feels the bed dip. Feels tiny footsteps tumbling along the length of his legs, pressing down on the duvet. Harry counts to ten before opening his eyes.
“It’s for you,” Potter said, and slid it over the still empty table. They were waiting for the roast to finish. “Christmas gift.”
“And I do not care what you think.” Draco shook his head, trying to clear it. And, with no other choice, “Water, please.”
“They sound beautiful,” Potter said softly. Draco caught his eyes. They reflected the firelight, golden in the center of green like a candle, like a firefly.
“He will need to stay here for three days,” she says, looking up after she checks something off her thick, leather-bound notebook. “We’ll have to wait for the results after we run the tests. It’s nothing dangerous.” She looks down at her notebook once again, puts down her quill, and smiles at Harry. “It will be over in no time.”
Harry. Now he was here, walking alongside him in London. The moment struck Draco with the finest details: Harry’s messy hair, the curled strands against the pink clouds. His brown skin, the faint, white lighting zigzagging down his forehead and cutting through his brow. His eyes behind the glasses. Green, so green Draco thought he lost himself in them. His heart flooded with warmth, like the early summer air around them.
Draco blushed without reason and blamed it on the warm living room. In the hearth, the fire crackled. Draco drank cider from his mug—he’d come to think of it as his mug now—and finished the last bits of his drawing, the strokes of charcoal rough under the golden light. He chose a sheep each day to hustle and annoy by trailing closely behind for hours like a fly, and drew their portraits. Today it was Hannah. She had flicked her ears, displeased, but stayed rather still.
Draco smiles faintly. “Yes.”
He secured the ropes with a couple spells, pulled at the knots—then wiped off the sweat on his face and headed back. The wind was soft, caressing his cheeks. His sweat dried in the cool breeze. He closed his eyes for just a brief moment, searching for the tint of salt in the air, the wind brushing through the damp tips of his hair.
“No you’re not.”
“Proper posture, Potter —oh, oh wait I have an idea.” He pulls Harry closer, urges Harry to step onto his feet and, after Harry bewilderingly wraps his arms around him, does the same in return. “Good.”
“No.” Harry doesn’t look at Draco. He sets his jaw again to hide the tremble. “I know what you’re here for, and I don’t care. You can fuck right off. I don’t—”
“Aren’t we all?”
How Draco had blushed when he first called him by his name that Harry never thought to change any other wise. Such intimacy in two syllables that every time he says it, it sounds like a poem in itself. A lock none other than the both of them can decipher, like whispering love.
“I woke you up,” Draco said.
And, in the no-man’s land between touching and not touching, between having and unable to, Draco leaned in and kissed him.
“Sleep,” Harry commands. “You’re going to wake me up at five again tomorrow morning. And you’re going to unsheathe your claws on purpose. Just a little, but it still hurts, you know. And I need my sleep.”
“They will have by tomorrow.”
The kitten meows and crawls onto Harry’s lap. Settles there, and rubs its head to Harry’s chin, thin eyes blinking slowly. Harry laughs and presses a kiss to the kitten’s head.
Ron looks thoughtful. He slowly twirls his wine glass, the liquor gleaming like amber. “What if it
“Totally irrelevant,” Harry mutters.
Potter tugged at him to sit on the ground and pulled out two thermos of hot tea. They smelt of chamomile and figs, like the early breaths of spring.
“So, where do you say?” Harry pressed a sloppy kiss to the top of his head. “Paris? The States? Somewhere farther…Hokkaido?”
“It’s not too bad,” he said, eyes anxious. “I have cream.”
Silence, the question echoing between them.
“There is nothing for us to talk about.”
“Adequate amount of marshmallows,” Draco answered. The warmth soaked through his fingers.
Harry laughed. Then he looked at Draco, a little anxious.
He’d only started cooking because Astoria cooked. Baked, more like. Macaroons, Battenberg cake, chocolate truffles, crème brûlée…she served all the desserts they’d have with their tea, arranged them carefully on tiny porcelain plates accompanied with tiny forks. Because of this, she only allowed the use of the fine china tea set gifted by Narcissa on Saturdays, and started working in the kitchen as soon as the clock struck two in the afternoon. She’d cover herself in flour with her hair tied loosely into a bun, her wand tucked behind her ear. Draco made it his mission to steal one from her and had never once succeeded, always batted away and once hexed as soon as he laid a finger on a madeleine.
“No wasting food, yeah?”
“—waving your arms about, like an old prophet, yelling—”
“Are you not hungry? You haven’t eaten dinner.” Harry takes a deep breath. “Or water? Are you thirsty?”
“Hey!”
Draco laughs, shaky. “You’re being contrary.”
“Draco?”
Malfoy laughs. And Harry does not quite know what to do with this Malfoy, either, cheeks folding in soft lines and the corners of his eyes crinkling. He fidgets with the corner of the page and forces himself to dig back in.
He feeds the kittens and cleans the litter. Some are still asleep, but the ones that are already awake greet him with enthusiastic meows and paws—with just a hint of claws—as they squirm among each other, trying to climb onto Harry’s legs. Harry smiles faintly, and then—
The kitten meows loudly and tries to cover its bum with its paws. Harry, however, insists on cleaning it thoroughly and ends up using a muffling charm for his ears for the rest of the shower.
transformations, and—”
Cissy quickly finished the bottle and was, once again, languid in her fullness. She let Potter pick her up and place her back into the pen, ambled around.
Forget-me-not’s?
An owl hooted, glided, then disappeared into the woods.
Their shared flat is a lot of things. Bets are one; watching the television barefoot on the couch is another. Bit by bit, Harry learns they are both creatures of habit. Draco buys the same brand of orange marmalade, cuts his toast in halves, makes his coffee a little burnt because he always pushes the buttons too early. Wears dark green if it is cloudy. Takes his showers in the evenings as Harry cooks dinner.
Harry remembers Draco’s eyes. Grey. He has always known them: the piercing look, the narrowed lines as Draco sneered at him from across the Great Hall, the condescending glances. Now, though, they hold none of the sharpness. Defeated at times, yes, but softer. How Harry hated those eyes then, how his heart skips a beat every time he catches them from across the bustling Ministry now.
Potter walked behind Cho and a few seconds later, Cho was moving. Potter grinned as he followed behind, shifting between left and right to keep her on the correct track.
“Ah, it just…seemed like a kids’ sport, I guess.” Draco laughed softly. “I mean, when have you ever really seen an adult ride a broom? In leisure?”
He woke to a splitting headache. Groaned, the sound cutting through his sandpaper of a throat.
Hours later, they each had a stomach full of sausages and pies and hot chocolate, and a handful of bags filled with jars of marmalade, tins of tea, packages of biscuits (
“Draco—”
He Firecalled Pansy.
Draco wanted to laugh. Wanted to cry.
This was foreign to him. The warm tingle in his chest—foreign. This wasn’t about favors, wasn’t about bribes. Potter didn’t want anything from him. He had thought of Draco for Christmas, had put his mind to it and probably thought it over and over—had noticed Draco drawing, even though Draco still never explicitly allowed him to watch. Had paid attention to what he liked, had taken a guess, and had acted on it. Had paid heavy gallons for it and hid it in his room until tonight. Had even thought of an excuse, knowing Draco wouldn’t just accept it.
He had long learned to ignore the voices if he wanted to carve out a life of his own. He was good, no one could deny that. They could use his past against him, shun him, throw him out again and again—but no one could take away what he really was.
Harry laughs. Leans his head on Draco’s shoulder, closes his eyes with a smile.
“I won’t.” Harry sniffed, inhaled and exhaled deeply. His voice was thick and wet even through the statics. “I won’t. I’m not crying now.”
“Do you like the gardens?”
“The gardens are flourishing,” Draco said one day. Narcissa smiled and opened her eyes. Looked at the gardens as if she hadn’t seen them in a long time.
Harry’s cheeks burn. “Yes,” he says.
The timer tinkled. Draco took out the warm, freshly-baked cookies, let them sit for a while, and stored them into glass jars. He hovered by the living room, chewing his lip. Then he fetched his own duvet and pillow from his bedroom, curled on the couch, and fell asleep beside Harry.
Beside him, Draco is soundly asleep. His fingers loosely curled around Harry’s pajamas, the fabric bunched up in the cage of his long fingers. His hair fanned out on the pillows. Dawn catches on his pale lashes and bounces off, like stardust.
“Come here,” Harry whispers, reaching out.
“You like it,” Harry echoed.
What do you think I am, a—”
And Draco pushed himself off the bed and never came back.
Harry doesn’t sleep at night. Stares at the ceiling in the guest room and memorises a new map of cracks and shadows.
Down the middle of the photograph was a thin, jagged line, as if the photo had once been torn and mended.
“I didn’t say anything—”
It was like turning a memory over and over until it faded at the edges, like a camera losing focus. It was replaying it again and again until the soft glint of it was all you could see in mind, every ragged edge smoothed and every color a gentle smudge—then seeing the memory in front of you again. Her nose was sharper than he remembered, her cheekbones highlighted under the display lights. She had braided her hair; it curled around her nape and down one side of her neck, down her shoulder. He had never seen her braid her hair before. It made her seem younger, somehow, as if she was a young woman who’d only left her teens, who’d only started her twenties—then Draco remembered, stunned, that she was.
“I’ve a present for you,” Harry said. Draco laughed.
“I think you like it here.”
Harry looks away. The kitten nudges Harry’s finger with its soft, tiny nose, rubs its cheek against his knuckles.
“Wha—wait, you can’t go first, you cheater! You—” Draco fumbled with the door handle and jumped out, stumbling as Potter turned back and laughed, loud and clear. He was thoroughly soaked. It was difficult to see with his fringe clinging to his eyes, but at that moment he wanted to laugh, too, wanted to use all his strength to do so. His lungs wanted him to, needed him to, pushed the sound through his chest and up his sternum—so Draco did. Potter turned his head and grinned, then stumbled. Draco only laughed louder. They dashed under the patio, panting, Draco’s chest so full it could combust.
But then Harry never mentioned his own tattoo, so Draco never asked—though he wanted to, wishing it would slide yet desperately curious of Harry’s. He tried to guess, sometimes, sitting on the couch and watching Harry do whatever it was he was doing, his messy hair falling in front of his eyes.
“Yes. No. I mean…” Potter laughed, helpless. Draco laughed, too. The air was relieved of its weight, light again. “I mean, Ginny and I, it just became so…different. We didn’t see each other for a whole year, and when I came back, everything changed. We tried but we both knew it wasn’t going to work. But still, I was…yeah,” Potter said softly, as if to a memory, “Yeah. It hurt.”
“Or perhaps he wants you out of the house.”
Potter looked horrible, too. His eyes bloodshot, hair wild, jumper clogged in dried dirt and loose stalks of hay. He looked as though he hadn’t shaved for weeks. There was a bone-deep tiredness in his eyes, in the way he crouched, in the way his shoulders hunched as he leaned his weight onto his own knees. He still hadn’t showered, and smelt strongly of afterbirth and blood. Of sheep. He placed a gentle hand by Draco’s socked feet. Not touching, but close enough to.
“So I left London. For years, just the thought of going back was nauseating, and then…and then this is it.” Potter spread out his hands a little. “I’ve never been back.”
“We’re just going to run a few standard tests,” she explains, grabbing the kitten back into place as it tries to claw at her and escape. “Nothing to worry about. You can wait in the lobby if you’d like, it will be over in a couple of hours. Would you like us to perform a sedation charm on him?”
Work ended at five thirty in the evening with a disapproving eye from his department manager, as though he expected him to stay late and work extra hours for the months he’d missed. Draco supposed it was reasonable. He didn’t care enough, though. Once in every few days he walked home instead of taking the Floo so he passed the market. Then he cooked dinner. The chopping was loud in the silent flat, the stirring as spoons clinked against pot, the water boiling—loud. He couldn’t help but feel as though something was missing, the way you still glanced at your empty wrist even if you forgot your watch. A phantom weight leaned against the counter of the sink, arms crossed and teasing. A glint in the eyes, a faint smile warm on the lips. He stared determinedly at the pot of mashed potatoes, stabbing and stirring with a fork. Glimpsed the cider sitting in the fridge when he opened it in search of butter. Paused, then poured himself a mug-full and downed it all.
The silence was labored with building tension. Finally Draco snapped. “It’s been seven years. I’m not—I’m not effected anymore.”
Draco let out a breath. His mother was jesting, of course. But there was, for once, no need to remember his life outside of the gardens. No need to remember the charity balls he still had to attend, the hands he still had to shake, the stack of papers he still had to look over. No need to remember the sneers passersby threw and the condescending glances. Just a summer evening with his mother, having tea in the gardens. He let out another breath, and closed his eyes, too. Bathed himself in the faint scent of roses and the warm air. Sank himself deeper into the chair.
It wasn’t bad. Harry owned a flat just off downtown, the crowd pulsing with each passing hour: surging into the roads at noon, thinning by three, surging again at five, struggling to squeeze into the Underground, and then thinning again by dusk. Friday nights were wild with Happy Hour and drunken teenagers, jeans too skinny and singing and screeching with laughter as the cars surged through the streets, headlights gliding pass the ceiling in Harry’s bedroom, a patch of light. He’d learned to shut the windows. The pinching voices were muffled, dulled, still waded through and lingered between the folds of the curtains, between the dust motes.
“Hungry, yes?” He slaps his legs and takes a deep breath, pushing himself up. “Wait a minute. Breakfast is coming.”
The kitten’s ears twitch. It is too busy eating and has no time for Harry.
Harry huffs and, after a moment, shakes his head. Draco gently cradles his head, tilts it a little sideways, and tugs off a strand of hair. It is undoubtedly silver. Harry huffs again.
“That’s what this one’s doing now.” Harry nudges his chin towards the kitten, who is now peering at them from the bookshelf. “Sleeping in the middle of my bed. At least it’s not kicking me to the couch.”
The gallery was spacious, a whole floor cleared out for the photographs, partitions stationed in the center of halls, between tall walls and wide corridors. The afternoon light streamed in from the floor-to-ceiling windows and flooded the grey walls. Aside from the natural brightness, only small exhibition lights were illuminated, a warm, golden hue reflected off the glass encasing the photographs.
There was only silence. Dawn had inched its way through, casting tilted triangles of light onto the corner of the short table. The foot of the empty hearth. A small section of the pot in which sat the rosemary, standing by the half-drawn curtains.
Draco let out a laugh. “That’s cheating.”
Harry hummed. Dipped his bread into the soup and scooped up onions, an echo of Draco’s movements.
“Merlin, no. That’s cheating.”
A thousand shades of pink, of purple—a thousand different shades of a single color, laid bare. Not for them, but in front of them all the same. They swayed slightly in the wind, rippling, stretching until the hills faded out of sight, until it coalesced with the soft blue of the North Sea.
“Don’t
“It’ll bribe you, is who it’ll bribe.”
“Okay, fine.” Potter sighed. His feet were bare on the armchair, and now he dropped them to the thin rug. “Maybe I did. But that doesn’t make you a coward, not…not breaking up. Not unable to let go, not grieving. It doesn’t…” he sounded distant, “it doesn’t make you any less of a person.”
Harry has always been stubborn in trying, though.
The name still made him flinch, even though once it had been all he’d admired. He walked close to her and slit open the cupboard box with mugs.
The world whirled to a singular focus, the rest a blur. He couldn’t think. Couldn’t move, a million things reeling and blending into one another. Legs like steel. Opened his mouth. Lost his voice.
You have...so much that people envy. And I’m not talking about the fame. You have people who love you and people to love. You have the chances, the potential, hell, the gallons—to travel, to change to any job you’d like. You have so much you can do, so much to do, experiences people would die to have—and instead you waste it away.” A sharp pang of jealousy shot through his chest. “Do you have any idea how lucky you are? Do you have any idea how precious all that you have is?”
“Shall we play it out, hmm? Parts reserved? Do you want to beg me the way I begged you? I’ll make it more theatric, I promise. This time I’ll leave right in front of your eyes instead of sneaking away in the middle of the night like a coward. Then again, maybe you enjoyed it, watching me get more and more pathetic until you can kick me off like a stray pup.”
Draco smiled, something hollow in the center of his chest. “You sound like a grandma.”
In a way, it was as if nothing had happened. The kiss floated between them like a bubble, gleaming like a jewel under sunlight but otherwise unnoticeable.
And it is harder and harder to fool himself every day, to tell himself that they’ve had history, that Draco already belongs to someone else—to watch Draco come in every day with a faint smile, the bell tinkling as he greets Harry good morning with two cups of coffee. His hair is soft in the morning light, white-gold amidst the exuberant flowers as he looks around—Harry wrapping his bouquet, trying to steal a glance or two—footsteps slow, bending as he sniffs at the buckets of flowers from the lower shelves. A laugh escapes and Harry pretends it is a cough when Draco turns, narrowing his eyes.
The kitten suspiciously eyes the can of food, sniffs at it, and
“It’s okay,” Harry murmurs, and falls asleep like that.
“Oh. Oh, I’m…I’m sorry.”
Lightning strikes, followed by rumbling thunder. The kitten jumps and screams as it puffs up and dashes to Harry’s bed, head-butting him in his belly. Harry grunts before he gently covers the kitten with his palm, smoothing down its back.
“Food?” he asks, gently pushing the can forward.
The train whistled, the station steaming up. Astoria pressed a quick kiss to his cheek, gave him a small smile, then disappeared into the crowded compartment. The air was cool, still lingering with the last traces of warmth from August. Draco thought he saw a glimpse of Astoria’s purple beret, but it might have been anything. Around him people were hugging goodbyes from compartment windows, waving, laughing, couples kissing. Someone forgot their handkerchief and a middle-aged man waved it violently, yelling and running towards the train from the other side of the platform.
Chaste, a tentative press of lips. Yet the seconds were hours, were days, were years—and when Potter pulled back, Draco couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t sense anything save for the wild warmth of his heart.
Draco opened his mouth, closed it. His stomach churned with dull fear.
In the end, partly so she would quiet down—so not to awaken Potter—and partly because he himself also yearned to sleep, he dragged a kerosene lamp low and settled on the floor, Cissy snuggled close to his chest. He covered them both under the quilt. She, too, was warm, like a tiny burner. He stroked the curly wool on her head, stroked her lithe ear, and dozed off. Sometime during sleep he climbed back awake to the hem of cotton pajama pants and bare feet, the heavy settle of something over his back.
The steam had already fogged up the shower doors, the air warm and humid. Draco stripped. Harry’s silhouette was a blur behind the glass. He grinned when Draco pushed the door open, stubbornly refusing to look straight at him naked.
“If I will still take you?” Harry laughs again. It tugs at the gaping hole in his chest. “I don’t have to fuck you, Malfoy. There are other people.”
Lilies?—then promptly remembered his own mother was named after a flower, hoped his own was not narcissi. How embarrassing that would be.
“Hokkaido.”
“You almost killed both of us,” Draco said, laughing. Harry pretended to tackle him and Draco squeaked, squirmed, laughed some more—the ropes squealing—let Harry wrap his arms around him and maneuver them both to face the sea. Draco smelt faintly of strawberries, sweet and warm in the dancing sunlight.
“Oh, love,” Draco whispers. “We’re so old.”
Draco headed to the bathroom and came out to Potter in the kitchen. His socks were ridiculous: buttery white and dotted with tiny broomsticks, pulled up to different lengths at his shin. Draco snorted until he saw Potter trying to pick up at a large piece of bloody meat, then all amusement dissipated.
“You know he’s busy these days. The Ministry’s going crazy, what with the coming school year. They’re reviving the curriculum, you know, rewriting the werewolf section and adding the House Elves into the category of Magical Creatures—it’s not ideal, but it’s a good start, and…” Hermione starts rambling but catches herself last minute and blushes, grinning apologetically at Harry. “Ah, you know what I mean. Draco’s probably just waiting for when he has time to write back.”
Draco gave a soft
“No,” Draco said sulkily. “No you won’t.”
Just a couple minutes after Harry extinguished the lights and climbed into bed, Draco peeked into his bedroom.
The sadness rose around him like waves, like the gentle embrace of an old friend.
“You don’t even know how to dance!”
The tractor tumbled. Their arms bumped.
“You like me.”
“No idea,” Harry said. “I appreciate it, though.”
The moon, round and full and bright, hung low on the clear night sky.
The oranges ripened and grew heavy; the branches dipped under their weight. They picked some for breakfast every morning: Harry twisting the fruit off with a snap, Draco carefully tugging each one off.
Harry turns to face him. Draco looks away, flushed, shifting back and forth on his feet.
“You’re unbelievable. Levitating! Imagine if you were a sheep and suddenly you’re floating in the air!”
He couldn’t feel his fingers anymore, he didn’t think. Coldness seeped through his sweater and nestled against his skin, drained warmth from his body. He was crouching in a corner of their garden near the beehives. The hives were quiet, now, covered under heavy snow. If Draco listened, he thought he could hear the faint buzzing of activity inside: the worker bees fanning their wings together in a cluster to keep their queen warm, the center of the hive maintained at a steady 32 degree Celsius.
“Would you like to hear a joke?” Draco asked.
“Just focus on our feet, love.”
“Will your friends be visiting?” His mind was reeling now. To think he was going to see the bunch of Gryffindors again. Weasely would probably punch him in the face. He wouldn’t be able to face Longbottom, or Finnigan, or…dear Circe, Lovegood. He would have to stay out of it all, but where could he go? There was no room save for the barn and Potter’s bedroom. Maybe if—
“The giant squid would have suffocated had it come to the surface for air. No wonder I never saw it that year.”
A warm hand grabbed his wrist. Draco, shocked into silence, stopped. Harry tightened his grasp, firm enough to keep Draco from leaving but gentle enough not to hurt.
He watches with drooping eyelids as the kitten finishes the can of salmon. Then, just as sleepy, he heads back to his bedroom. The kitten trails behind with footsteps so soft that the only thing he hears is his own bare feet padding against the floor. Once in the bedroom, the kitten jumps onto the bed and curls against Harry’s chest as Harry covers them both underneath the duvet.
“It’s just you said you had nothing to do, and I, well. Thought maybe you’d…you know, they’re pretty gentle, so—some change in scenery, maybe. It’s all snow out there, not to say it’s not beautiful but it could get quite…oh, Merlin. What I mean is—”
He remembers the first kittens he saved. Not assigned from the shelter, no, but saved—from the streets, behind a filthy alley. It was winter. The mother had apparently abandoned the litter of kittens, but the rest was nowhere to be found: all that was left were two tiny kittens, and they couldn’t have been more than a day old. Dirtied with afterbirth and cold from the inside, left underneath a flaky oil painting.
Draco took a sharp breath. From the phone came only silent, swarming statics.
The couch dipped, and then Potter was beside him, pulling him close. Draco, again, let him—like he had for the whole night. Tucked his head to the dip of Potter’s shoulder, curled himself into a ball—pulled his knees to his chest. Closed his eyes, inhaled a shaky breath. Potter’s thumb traced nonsensical patterns into the turn of his shoulder.
“I saw your boot tracks. Did you follow that wall?”
Another lightning strikes; thunder rumbles. Draco flinches. His silhouette is illuminated for a fraction of a second, pale like a ghost, knuckles white.
Draco shot his eyes to Potter. Everything snapped back into focus—the black iron of the kerosene lamps, the pear yellow and the brick red of the quilt. The rain falling against the window. Potter, sitting on the other side of the room, his eyes soft. Kind. His fingers stilling again on the letters, the blunt tips smudged with ink. Suddenly he couldn’t take it. Potter sitting there and regarding Draco with such kind eyes when Draco couldn’t return anything he wanted, when Draco only took, and took, and took—his comfort, his presence. Draco had averted his gaze again and again, had shut his eyes and leaned onto him whenever he needed to, had pretended not to see what was between them—had pushed him away whenever he felt as though it was too much, the soft ache in his chest was too much, whenever he was
Harry covers Draco under the duvet. Hesitates, and then pulls Draco closer by the small of his back. Draco exhales and grabs Harry closer still.
He was shaken awake in the middle of sleep. Potter was crouching by the couch, his hat and coat already on. He whispered something.
Draco sighed. “Morning.”
“Would you like a cookie, Harry?” Luna asks, placing the bundles of books onto the floor and pushing a half-knitted blanket aside to make space on the couch so she can sit. “They’ve just come out of the oven.”
Draco sighs faintly, shoulders loosening.
“Perhaps. But I am.” She clasped her hands together. “Tell me, how is Potter?”
“Just open it.”
Astoria regarded him for a moment longer. Then her smile widened as she looked down, brought tea to her lips again. “You think you are good at masking yourself, Draco. But you never have been.”
“My what?”
Potter was smiling at him, the towel sooty in his hands.
Draco sat on the couch. Soon the tap started running, the plumbs humming through the walls. He wrought his hands on his lap and looked around, the edge of his mind still nagged. Worried his bottom lip and then, in a rush, pushed himself up and marched straight to the bathroom.
Harry can’t help but touch Draco’s face. Hesitatingly, almost gingerly he strokes, cups his cheek. Draco lets out a shuddery breath.
“Hand cream,” Draco replied. Carefully shaded the side of the lamb’s face on the parchment. Added, dumbly, like an afterthought, “For your hands.”
“I don’t dislike lemons.”
He bought groceries and cooked dinner. It always pleased him to fill up his fridge, and he thought the fridge was pleased, too. He set up the table on one side—placing the fork on the left, the knife and spoon on the right—lifted his head and caught sight of the empty space across, and decided the bring dinner to the couch instead. Facing the hearth, he laid the shallow bowl on his folded lap and ate the poached fish and tomatoes in silence. It was odd to be eating in his flat again. Everything was as he remembered, but with a distance; like meeting with an old friend you hadn’t met for years, trying to know him again with the intimacy once shared. His inky green couch lounged like a shadow in the falling night, the Persian rug stretched in front of him foreign. The white marbled tea table, the brown maple double bookshelf, the wine glasses shining in the cabinets in the kitchen—odd pieces of a puzzle that somehow fit and, in a long-lost way, comforted him.
Pride and Prejudice
“He, um.” Harry swallows. It sounds foolish now. “He didn’t reply to my letter. Forget about it, I just thought—”
It snowed on Christmas Eve. Draco wore the warm, mustard-yellow sweater and was in the kitchen, trying to make a floating snowman on hot chocolate with marshmallows and cinnamon sticks. Harry wore a baggy, old jumper and ambled around, playing ridiculous Christmas carols on the gramophone. George Weasley had given Harry a collection of those as Christmas presents as a joke three years ago. Draco secretly swore ever since to hex him every time he ran into him.
“It’s alright. She was happy with it.” Draco shook his head, words soft. “It was…nice, she said. To leave on a summer day. She just fell asleep with the windows open. She never left the windows open when she slept before, not after—well, not after the war. You could see the garden from her room. It was June and the flowers were blossoming. They’re something, those flowers. Some bloomed overnight and withered the next morning. Just like that. You could smell them from her room. The windows faced the wind, and they wafted…”
Draco had a retort in mind, a fragment of a sentence. It flowed through his mind, came out as a hum of acknowledgment.
Draco wondered, sometimes, how she grew to be graceful while he grew to have trembling hands.
Harry blinks hard and tries to focus on the book.
Four cans later, Harry does not feel as fine about the issue as he initially did. The kitten has refused all of them with a single sniff, has—if a kitten can actually do so—glanced condescendingly first at the food and then at Harry, and has proceeded to push two of the cans off the table, spilling wet mush everywhere. Has attempted to escape while Harry cleaned up the mess, only to be stopped at the last minute and retorted by screaming and kicking as Harry picked it up.
“Did they?” Harry shucked off his trainers and walked towards the kitchen. “I wouldn’t know. I’m not one of them.”
family.
He rubbed his eyes, tired of it all. Six months. Six months, and he was still dreaming about it.
Sings in the shower.
Harry doesn’t know since when visiting Luna has become a habit. It is simply nice, he supposes, to have someone who sees through him but doesn’t say anything. To pretend he isn’t a little insane after the war. He thinks they all are, sometimes. But next to Luna, it feels like nothing at all.
“You said you love me.”
“Why am I so useless?” Draco asked him, slow and slurred. His breath stank of alcohol.
Harry lets out a laugh. “I didn’t know we were a couple.”
“Potioneer,” Draco replied, only to be knocked over by a sudden grief.
Draco buried his face into her coarse fleece and cried. Quiet sobs wrenching their way from his lungs as he gasped, as he felt the wetness on his cheeks. Warmth emitted from Cho’s body. He clutched his hands in fistfuls of wool as he sobbed, shoulders shaking. Something bled out of him: sadness, grief, something akin to life. For the first time after the war he felt completely broken.
Draco nodded, not knowing how to tell Potter to stay. Desperate, but all that came out was, “I’ll make dinner, then.”
“I haven’t even started.”
Draco’s mouth dropped. Apparently most of the sheep were pregnant,
“It’s going to be okay,” Draco whispered. He swallowed, blinking hard. When he spoke again, his voice was a rasp. “You’re strong. You’re strong, aren’t you, young lady? Hang in there. Hang in there, okay? I promise you it will be alright. Everything will be alright…”
Draco sighed. “Coffee, please. If you have any.”
“It’s going to be alright,” Harry murmurs, bending down and burying his nose into the softness of the kitten’s belly. His voice is muffled in the white fur. He takes another deep breath, throat wet, and presses the kitten’s ears flat to its head and he smoothes a hand over them. The kitten looks at him with unblinking eyes. Harry chuckles wetly. “It’s going to be alright,” he says again. “I love you. It will be okay.”
They were so close Draco could feel the heat rumbling off Potter, hot in the cold air. Still panting, their breaths mingled together like waves crashing against one another in a stormy sea. Potter never took his eyes off him, as if he was helpless to do so. Something laid bare between them, raw and vulnerable in its pulsing.
Draco turned. Beside him stood Astoria, who was smiling faintly at the violin.
Harry closes his mouth. He remembers the way Draco stood whenever they talked in the Ministry, shoulders tense, as if ready to jump at any time. Remembers the passersby throwing glances at them, some sneering almost like Draco used to. Whispers and stares, hushed or blatant in the background.
“I think you should sleep it off.”
“Don’t be silly,” Harry said. Then, smiling, “Take a guess.”
unearths a wireless. He turns the buttons this way and that, gives it a good shake, bats it around until finally, amidst a vague, grazing noise, soft music starts flowing out. Malfoy places it on the nightstand and, tilting it towards him, catches Harry’s eyes.
They ate, the house warm and bright in the cold night. Half-way through the meal, Harry fetched a parcel from his bedroom.
“The weather’s nice here,” Potter said, returning to his letters. “I like it here.”
“You smell sweet.”
Harry drops his head.
Draco was stunned frozen.
“Relax, gee.” Potter sounded amused. “I’m not going to dislodge it.”
“Calm down, gee. You’re making the sheep anxious,” Potter said, nonplussed, as he cut open a bale of hay. The thick smell spilled, immersed both of them in a lost summer. Potter’s face softened. “Hey, it’s not a big deal, alright? You were tired, so I let you rest. It’s nothing, I’ve slept worse. I’ll wake you up next time if it bothers you that much.”
Cho turned her head back to nudge at him. He let out a laugh. Cho was warm beneath her coarse coat, so warm Draco thought he could fall asleep right there. Right there in the cold night, his knees in the snow.
It was suddenly too painful. Draco drew a sharp breath.
They read it together nonetheless, Harry turning the pages a pace slower than he usually does. The kitten doesn’t seem to pay attention, though, insistent in its rubbing against Harry’s cheek.
They sway. Feet lifting, crossing between the lines parting shadow and light—dancing across a kaleidoscope, a hundred shades of grey. Harry hums along, broken and off-key. Draco rests his cheek against Harry’s and then buries his face into Harry’s hair altogether.
Draco grins. “You have to do laundry for a month.”
“Draco,” Potter said patiently, leaning forward, “if you can cook us dinner every day, then I can get you a present.”
“Yeah. Friends visiting tonight.”
The kitten meows loudly at a piece of layered meat.
A cavernous ache ate him alive.
The sound of his chewing was loud in his ears.
“They were dying to. Didn’t get any news, though.” Draco sunk his spoon into the plate of stew. “You should have seen all the guesses. Merlin, were they wild. I think I saw stripper in the states. And leader of backstage Ministry overthrow. I cannot decide which is worst.”
Astoria listened, eyes intent. Laughed when she heard about the sheep and Potter’s beard.
Harry nuzzled. Draco shifted, pulling the covers up his bare shoulder. “Mother had tea with Aunt Andromeda every afternoon, and I would steal the…the raspberries, making sure no one was watching. They were so plump and huge, the size of my hands—a child’s hands, the raspberries growing all over the fences. I ate and ate and they stained all my shirts pink. I ate so much that I felt sick, so much that for the next year I couldn’t eat raspberries at all.” A small huff of laughter. “Mother knew, I think. She always had that look about her. Like she didn’t know whether to be mad or exasperated.”
“No,” Harry said immediately, straightening. “No, why do you think so?”
Draco gasped. Cold air filled his lungs to the brim. The world snapped back into focus, moving again, its noise slowly seeping through, the hubbub flowing around them. Draco breathed heavily, barely registering Potter’s shoulders slumping in relief as he stumbled, looked over—
Harry leans over and touches Draco’s hand. Draco is already smiling. Harry brings his hand close to his lips, kisses his knuckles.
“Draco is…nice,” he says. The words have formed and arrayed themselves at the back of his mind ever since the war ended, and now they grab the chance to finally flow freely. “He’s nice. Not to everyone, just…to some of them. And he doesn’t know it himself. Yet.” He lets out a soft sigh. “He only hears what everyone else says. But people can be wrong.”
Draco smiled. “I didn’t know you liked the peacocks.”
“Want to feed them?”
Harry cupped his hands and brought them to his nose, closed his eyes. Draco was always embarrassed when he did that.
“Yes you do.”
“Ah. This is weird.” Potter laughed, trying to lighten the air. “I’ve never told anyone else about it before. Seems fitting for this to be what finally made you speechless, eh?”
Harry rubs his face and digs the heel of his palms into his eyes.
“If you’d found time for a levitation charm I’m sure you could have Apparated.”
“Are you busy?” Draco asks.
“You’re using it,” Draco said, soft with disbelief. The hand cream. The memories rushed back to him: the bright calendulas, the falling into a river, gasping. Cho. Scraping his hands and face, sitting in front of a fire, Harry spreading salve over his forehead. They seemed so faraway, coming back bright and blurred with a warm halo, with a whirl of intensity. How foolish they were, then, sitting so close yet so faraway. How young they had seemed when it was merely a year ago.
They reached the tractor and climbed into the seats. The engine started, the whole vehicle rumbling. Draco didn’t know where to settle his eyes. He dropped them to his lap, stared towards the empty path on the front, and glanced, in an accident, at Potter’s hand resting on the gear between them. A loose hold like an afterthought. Draco quickly looked away and for the rest of the journey, turned his head stubbornly to the scattered trees rolling back with the endless hills.
He didn’t know what he wanted. He wanted Potter to go back to how he was before, easy grins and teasing jokes. He wanted last night to just be a dream. He wanted Potter to tell him it was nothing, to tell him to forget it. He wanted Potter to kiss him again, hard, like he meant it. Potter finished checking about Neville’s hooves, stood up. Let out a long breath. The sky was murky today, glooming.
“Where am I?” Draco finally asked.
Harry blushes crimson. Silly, because Draco is not saying the words to him—but to his lover, for whom he has come and visited Harry’s shop for days on end, arriving early to avoid the morning rush and bring them the flowers before the day starts. The flowers are always the freshest, the leaves still wet with dew, and Harry picks the best of them for Draco because Draco’s lover deserves the best. Because Draco deserves the best.
“So, what did you do today?”
The thing was, he drew. Oil paint, charcoal, watercolor, pastel; he could work with a single quill. He used to paint in the gardens of the Manor: the peonies, the primroses, the willows and the oaks. Bathed himself in their Latin names as he carefully captured the patterns of leaves with thin quills, as he stood back and brushed thick colors for their petals on canvases. The day he turned fourteen he slipped to Diagon Alley and bought, with the gallons he’d half bribed from his mother, a pair of paint brushes he’d wanted since the start of term: made with sable hair, the thin wooden handle varnished. The shop owner, a middle-aged man who had tiny eyes and a round belly—always covered underneath a painting apron splashed in dried pastel—recognized him and gifted him a box of paint. Not as Lucius Malfoy’s son, but as
“Half of it, anyway. The other half was…” Potter trailed off. “I just thought it’d be nice. You know, to see them…like this. I never really had anything when I was a child, and it felt…”
Draco snorts. “Just an excuse to step on my feet, then.”
“The owl is arriving today.”
“Want to sleep it off?” he asked.
It took Draco moments to recall, then widen his eyes. “Are we not going to finish dinner before we go?”
“What,” he said flatly.
Harry’s face burns. Ron looks sympathetically at him.
Draco slipped out nonetheless, swinging his bare feet to the floor and wincing at the chilly floor as he padded to the living room. He collected his charcoal and parchment, greeted the pot of rosemary. It seemed to have settled well—sitting happily on the windowsill, stretching in the sunlight. Draco let it curl its tips around his finger as he murmured to it, like he used to with the plants in the gardens of the Manor, nonsensical.
Strange, how after all that they’d done this was what made him warm all over his chest. Giddy and intimate, wanting to laugh out of pure happiness. He turned, only to find Harry already looking at him with a faint smile at his lips. It was still odd to see him without his glasses, the openness on his face. It must’ve tumbled off the bed, must’ve dropped to the floor, perhaps with a thud, like their shirts and trousers did. Like their belts and their socks.
“It’s a time-lapse curse,” Khatri explains, “which, as you know, prolongs the effect of any spell, potion, or transformation. The victim has likely transformed without the knowledge that they are under a curse and is unable to transform back. It does wear off on its own, but the problem in this case is that we cannot determine how long it will take.” She takes a deep breath. “Judging by the fact that there have been no symptoms or signs of unusual behaviors for the past week, I think it wouldn’t wear off for quite a while.”
“Alright.”
He watched Harry blink himself awake in the dark, still bleary. Watched Harry’s eyes settle on him, register, and recognise.
Ron squeezes his shoulder before they leave. Hermione, who’s been glancing anxiously at him all afternoon, hugs him tightly by the door. Wants to say something, opens her mouth—closes it again.
Draco sighed dramatically as he ran the vegetables under the tap. Sliced them, diced them, heated the pan; cut the meat. It flowed through his fingers like a revisit, like climbing onto a bike for the first time in years and finding balance after a heartbeat. The pan sizzled, and soon the robust aroma of fresh tomatoes and lamb filled the warm air. Waiting for it to simmer, Draco turned to wash his hands. Caught Potter’s eyes. He’d been watching in silence the whole time.
Ron shrugs again and sighs. “Gryffindor up, mate.”
Draco turned, dizzy. Harry walked close, closer, and at last stood beside him, looking at the young man in the photograph.
“Isn’t Scotland in the same time zone as London?”
Harry leans down and kisses him.
The air was light and charged with chilliness. The sky, tenderly blue, saw only faint blankets of clouds over the top of faraway hills. He found Cho huddled with two other sheep by scattered pines and sat down, starting again on his half-finished portrait of her. Now that he knew she was pregnant, he felt the need to include her belly in it to show that she was, in all seriousness, a proper mother.
Draco didn’t know where to start.
Draco laughed. The tears fell, sliding down his cheek, and then he was crying again. Potter pulled him close, tucking his chin on top of his head. His arms tight around his shoulder, as if he, too, was holding on.
the house. Are you—are you thinking of…do
Harry pushed himself up with a groan, kicking off the duvets. “What time is it?”
It was near dusk when Potter came back. Draco, curled against the foot of the couch, hunched over the small piece of parchment on the table—his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, the soft side of his palm smeared in charcoal soot—acknowledged him with a soft
doing in Scotland?”
Draco let himself be persuaded and led back to their little house, their kitchen. Harry made tea, placed some chocolate chip cookies on the plate. In the middle of eating, Harry took out an earring: small and intricate, an emerald with a golden frieze, baroque-style. Draco flushed. He let Harry fix it to his ear. When he leant back, Harry was flushed, too, cheeks ruddy in the honey-gold of the setting sun.
The barn descended into chaos as Lettuce barked by Potter’s side, chasing the sheep in. The mothers usually weren’t the ones in need of help but the lambs, having fallen into the freezing river and struggled until it lost strength, or lost their body heat under the heavy rain—cold, lifeless. Draco helped with what he could: rub the lambs with a dry towel, lower the lamps and intensify the warming charms; tube, carefully, warm and creamy colostrum into the lambs’ stomach. Potter took over whenever he deemed necessary, taking Draco’s place with a grim face and without words. Then he’d leave for a second round of checkups, for the mothers in labor that needed help, for the lambs that have gotten lost…
“Does it, now?”
“Do you think the bees appreciate the scenery?” Draco asked.
“That’s Cho.”
Harry quickly heads towards the Fourth Floor before she spots him. The kitten on his shoulder squirms, meowing uncertainly.
“It’s like Christmas,” Draco whispers. “Remember?”
Harry handed him another wedge of orange. Draco took it.
he’d cried, gritting his teeth through the bitter taste of bile.
“And sweat.”
She teased him for loving his flat. For loving to stand on the balcony and look down as though looking at the world below. But there was more to it. It was what he’d fought for and earned with dignity. Not with the Malfoy name, not with bribes; he’d earned this, had carved out a place of his own in this unforgiving world. Had suffered the consequences of his wrongdoings and now, for the first time, he could lift his chin and breathe.
He met with Astoria at Ashmolean Museum. He arrived with thirty minutes to spare, so he wandered through the corridors, the sculptures, and looked at oil paintings, the landscapes and still-life. Passed a man shooting a deer, the arrow flying across the quiet valley. Paused in front of blood red flowers lying on an ochre ground. Spent eight minutes in front of Ennui by Walter Sickert, staring at the chubby woman looking at a glass case of stuffed birds over folded arms. Chin rested in one hand. The rich, yellow, patterned wallpaper crowded behind her, quiet. On a chair, a plump, middle-aged man with a golden mustache smoked his cigar.
“Well—no, of course not. It’s something I’ve seen from the movies, the Muggle ones, where the couple dances in their messy garage or living room or barn or…or whatever. Is it not?”
Harry huffed a laugh. It was as if nothing had happened between that cold, drunken night and the present. A mere continuing, loose threads joined once again. “Are you not, now?”
Draco’s face heated. “Wake me up, that’s what you’re supposed to do! It’s your room, for Merlin’s sake! What did you expect me to think, finding you on the couch and myself in the bed? I was not brought up like this, what—what place do you think it puts me in? What do you think—”
“Guanciale?” Joe seems surprised. “Oh. Italians use it to make…carbonara.”
Hazel hair, dark navy coat. Bent slightly forward, talking to a shop owner.
He was again pulled out of sleep when Potter, in the soft lights of the hour before dawn, crashed into the coat rack as he was pulling on his boots. Draco pushed himself up, eyelids still heavy. Potter whispered an apology as he fastened his coat.
Ron and Hermione visit and insist he needs to catch up on their preparation for the wedding and give advice on their choice of flowers, because Ron thinks they should use white roses but Hermione wants buttercups, and shouldn’t it be
“Scottish Blackface,” Potter informed him as he stood up again and headed to the other corner. Came back with a large bale of golden hay—fixed it between his legs and, swiftly, slit it open. The thick smell of summer made Draco dizzy. Timothy seeds, meadow grasses, common bent. He recognized each and every faint trace of them; had once spent day and night immersed in the rich smell of them. Of wild summer fields, of the sweet scent of baked sun. Potter cut the large bale into thick slices and stuffed them into a wire net fixed on the fences. The sheep started to tug at it, chewed and quieted.
Harry touched a finger to his shoulder and then bent down to kiss his cheek. Draco turned, making a soft noise—pleased, humming. His skin was warm from the June air.
“And now?” Draco turned, looking at Harry as though for the first time. It hurt to see him, hurt to think that for seven years Harry had laughed and cried and grown into the man standing in front of him, and that he had missed that, that he had not been by his side. “When are you leaving again?”
The truck jostled over a dent in the road. Draco clutched the handle, his knuckles white.
Potter’s smile was faint but amused. It was difficult to see it on him, these days. Not in their conversations, not after a whole day of intensity, not after dinner in Potter’s sleepy exhaustion. Draco wanted to keep it there. Kept waving his hands dramatically, kept going on about his lecture, over-enunciating each word.
“Don’t be silly,” Luna says, smoothing her hand along the kitten’s back again, all the way down its tail. “He likes you, of course.”
“Drink your cider, Malfoy. It’s hot.”
“My heart,” Draco whispers.
Draco stared forward. Dusk was settling, veiling everything in mauve shadows. The sky spilled in an array of rose, of sorbet, fading into lilac and dainty blue. He’d seen sunsets countless times before, but never from this angle. It looked different, somehow, as if the tilted skyline behind the rolling hills stretched thinner, as if the clouds were closer and farther away all at once. Crooked branches of oaks clawed against the sky down the hills, dark like coal; farther away lit the village of tiny houses like scattered fireflies. The tip of pines fogged the edge of the sky, a mesh of thin matches.
“Uh-uh.” Draco shook his fingers, leaned forward. “Come on, Potter. How come?”
Harry gave him a small, exquisite box. Draco unwrapped the paper, lifted the lid.
“Alright, alright.” Potter’s expression softened with a small smile. “I’ll buy marshmallows next time.”
Then later, lying in bed alone in the dark, thinking, quietly: it would be nice, actually, for it to be narcissi. Inked into his chest, right where his heart beat.
