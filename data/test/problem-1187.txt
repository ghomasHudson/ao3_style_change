“I’ll feel bad if I hold onto it,” Potter continued, shifting his weight restlessly.
This was a little more of a lie. It had been used to kill the Dark Lord, true, but it was also
"Why did you really come out here?" Harry asked, once they reached the far side of the lake.
“Good morning,” Draco answered warily. He’d left Baddock and Khan to deal with the aftermath of the pensieve, having bitten out enough answers to questions he didn’t want to think about too deeply. In retrospect, that may have been more than a little tactless. Baddock also gave a memory, one arguably worse than Draco’s, and had remained to listen to his housemates argue about the truth of his humanity, about the reality of his experience, possibly for hours. People had still been awake and talking in low voices, scattered amongst the armchairs and window seats in clusters of twos and threes, when Draco returned in the dark hours of the late-evening-early-morning.
Just like that, the Slytherin dormitories were reopened. Harry wasn’t sure what to do about the whole Malfoy situation; they hadn't seen each other except for class, and Harry was certain he didn't want to figure out their situation with all their classmates watching.
“You—” Greg started, voice brittle and unexpected, pinning Draco in place.
Myrtle made a ‘hmph’ sound. “I don’t see why you have to listen to her. You’re an
“Nothing,” Draco said, breaking his eyes away. “We should eat.”
“Oh,” Potter said. His shoulders relaxed. Potter’s face was upturned. He was still sitting in the grass, which seemed incorrect.
“Why are
“Why the pitch?”
Potter’s mouth tightened. “There are spells to keep students from crossing into the areas affected by the spell damage.”
, expected to kill Dumbledore or die trying, and his home is filled with Voldemort’s forces, and Harry is just—just a teenager, same as Malfoy, with not nearly enough power to keep one fucking person safe. Forget the world, that wide, faceless expanse. The world won’t die. But the person, living and breathing and beautiful? The person
By the time he heard the sounds of his housemates returning, Draco had only three lines for all his thoughts:
Draco inhaled, and it seemed to happen to a body that didn’t belong to him. In the pause between his inhale and exhale, he imagined the events unfurling: Potter, called into the Headmistress’ office; Officers Abbott-Jones and Evergreen, inquiring after Draco; the explanation Potter must have given about the circumstances around giving Draco his hawthorn wand back, blithely answering any questions they might have had about Draco.
Then the implications and its horror rushes in, eclipsing this thought entirely. Harry abruptly abhors the fact that he can’t see Malfoy’s face. He leans forward to tug at Malfoy’s shoulders until they’re face to face. Malfoy slaps Harry’s hands down, but doesn’t look away. The little color in him has abandoned him completely. He doesn’t look like a living boy anymore.
The words fell like so many shards of glass between them.
“What do you suppose
“Are you tired?” Potter asked, nudging away the teapot that someone had charmed to refill empty cups. It instead rammed repeatedly into Draco’s shoulder until he stole Potter’s mug from his hand and lifted it to be filled. Draco took an overlarge mouthful, not bothering with milk or sugar, and grimaced at the taste. But warmth spread through him, though it did nothing for the tired headache pulsing at his temple.
“Malfoy,” Potter started, sounding—Draco didn’t know. He didn’t know what to call that specific tone in Potter’s voice, or why it made him feel as if he’d been caught out doing something horrific.
Potter didn’t move. Draco went back to his runes. Potter said, impatiently, “Malfoy.”
Draco said, “No. But I don’t think that I have to be.”
Potter asked again, “Did you?” He, too, looked as if he suffered a night of broken sleep, the delicate skin under his eyes dark and lined. Draco wondered what Potter did instead. Wondered if he stared out at the forest from the high spire of Gryffindor tower.
“Don’t
Malfoy’s arms settle low on Harry’s back. “Tell me.”
"Yes, because nothing bonds quite as well as misery," Malfoy said snidely, before asking the final question with a brisk, "Who is paired with whom, then?"
Draco inhaled sharply, more out of irritation than anything. It figured, he thought with undeserved vitriol, that Potter would be the first to bring up his truancy. Even the Headmistress had been circumspect about it.
But it was only Potter, staring at Draco with so intent a look that Draco thought he might have stopped breathing. At his shoulder, Weasley and Granger were stopped as well, a look of studied blankness of both of their faces.
out?”
Malfoy flinches, just the tiniest bit, at the touch of the paste to his skin. Harry’s fingers freeze. The light filtering through the window is orange-tinged, turning Malfoy’s eyes and hair a brief, dazzling gold. After a moment, Malfoy closes his eyes, leaning into the touch. Harry continues, rubbing the paste into his skin with tiny, uncertain circles. The post-coital langour is fizzling, leaving Harry to deal again with his heavy, awkward hands and the wrongness of his skin.
They even skimmed the edges of the Forbidden Forest, which led to Malfoy walking off in a huff and Harry trying very hard not to laugh at him.
Draco was sitting on the ledge of one of the great big windows, daringly dropping owl treats between his dangling legs and watching them plunge dispassionately towards the grass below, when he heard someone stomp up the stairwell. Draco tensed.
done, when Potter found Draco on his way out of the dungeons and pried the answer of what he was doing today out of him, was lament whatever fleeting, misguided emotion inspired this insipid desire to help ensure the continued survival of an ancient, decidedly uninteresting game. By the time he’d run out of words, they were already at the ground level hall, which once held such exciting things as a dueling club and now settled for teenagers lobbing stones at each other. Potter, looking cheered, had said,
Malfoy is operating under the assumption that he will be returning to the Manor for Yule break. Harry is operating under the assumption that he can talk Malfoy into staying at Hogwarts. Facts at issue include: the increasingly worrying letters from Malfoy’s mother; the vanishing cabinet, still broken; the trustworthiness of Andromeda; the sense of reality crashing heavily around them and forcing them to make sense of the dust.
Draco awoke with the thought that he’d had a very vivid dream until he rolled onto his side and crumpled old parchment under the heel of his hand. Potter’s map was still charmed to show the castle, little black dots beginning to move about the corridors; when Draco looked up, through the gap in his curtains, he saw that the robes he’d worn the previous evening were conspicuously missing from where he usually hung them.
“It was Potter, wasn’t it?” Draco had figured it out some indeterminable time ago, but it didn’t feel right to bring up until now, face to face with the worry lines on his mother’s forehead. “That you lied about to the Dark Lord.”
Harry burrows deeper into Malfoy’s cloak, his fingers so tight on the fabric that they ache. “Does it bother you?”
“Oh,” said Potter, and looked over his shoulder to where Granger and Weasley were standing near the doors. Draco watched as Weasley raised a single eyebrow in Potter’s direction and Potter’s expression grew sheepish.
, he’d said, and Draco remembered, hazy, a childhood memory of his father saying in Borgin and Burkes that perhaps that was all that Draco would be good for: thievery. Petty crimes.
It’s a stupid thought, but Harry can’t get rid of it.
Yet Draco was certain he could feel the track of Potter’s eyes when he headed out of the library; and a glance upwards and to the side would find Potter there, at a nearby table with Granger and Weasley’s bowed heads across from him. When he left the Hospital Wing, his hours of service for Madam Pomfrey finished for the day, Potter would be passing by, the dawdling point of the triangle of
“Malfoy—” Harry starts, and that’s the exact moment Ron mentally tunes out of the conversation. Harry can see it in the glaze of his eyes. He could probably finish by saying
to. What was he doing?
“Oh,” Greg said, for a third time. His expression closed off. “Because you’d tell them to let me join.”
He felt like a localised Tarantallegra was dancing across the top of his skin the whole walk back to the common room. He stood outside the familiar stretch of wall for several long minutes, mind curiously blank for the first time in his entire life.
“But who else am I supposed to go with?” she asked, with a tragic tilt of her head.
Greg had his arms crossed, face gone tight. Before Greg could ask, Draco led him to the pale stone that read
But that was not the route she took today. Today, she said, “Mr. Malfoy, I cannot allow you to continue disregarding your classes like this. It is now November. No other student would be allowed to continue at Hogwarts without attending their classes, much less one preparing to sit his N.E.W.T.s this year.”
There was no greeting and no signature, the ink smeared at the end as if Potter hadn’t wanted to waste time casting a drying charm before sending it off. It put Draco off-kilter, his blood rushing through his heart like a waterfall, and then Draco made it worse by responding, and Potter made it appalling by responding back.
Harry starts to smile and promptly finds himself landing heavily on the stone floor, the transfiguration on the desks undoing itself and dropping both of them unceremoniously to the ground.
Creevey and Granger were immediately interested in Draco’s explanation of the way the castle worked with him during his repairs, though Granger in particular seemed unconvinced that simply
. But Draco had experienced nightmares since before he was Marked, and surely his mother, living in their unguarded Manor in the middle of Wiltshire, had many more than he did. It felt petty and childish to complain of even the smallest of ills—the scorn from the other students, the lingering aches in his bones, the fact that the sight of the ground from the highest towers still seemed too short a fall—when Draco should call himself lucky for every continued inhale and exhale.
, Harry wants to confess. But he’s not an expert in these matters.
“Is it?” Potter asked, very quietly. His face was too vulnerable tilted up like this, to look Draco full in the face.

Draco grabbed his wand from his bedside and muttered
“But that was
Harry crosses his ankles and pulls his knees to his chest. He knows there are, even if he can’t see the ones Malfoy left near his shoulder blades. He
"Well, there
,” Potter said harshly, then seemed briefly furious at his own admission. He placed Draco’s stupid letter right there on the table, the creases so neat it was practically another accusation, then began haphazardly pulling his things out of his bad, gaze darting back to Draco every so often, as if Potter thought Draco would Apparate the moment Potter stopped looking at him.
“I don’t know,” Malfoy says stiffly, dropping his gaze. “I’ll do what I have to.”
Harry spreads out the Marauder’s Map the moment he gets back to his dormitory, his shoulders tense as he scans for Malfoy’s dot. If Malfoy isn’t on the map, Harry’s just going to have to head to the Room of Hidden Things and drag him away from the cabinet or the pensieve or the stack of letters from his mother, with their entreaties for him to report some progress,
It was worse those days Draco was a little too reactionary and Potter a little too sharp-tongued, when neither of them had slept well and the draw of the sky or forest felt large, looming. They argued more in the first two weeks back from break than the entire term before it, prodding at the war and the years before it like a festering sore, and each time Draco was certain they’d realize that there was no point to trying to learn differently.
, and proffer them, graded and commented upon by her colleagues.
“There was one in Gryffindor, too,” Potter said. He leant against the edge of Draco’s desk in an empty classroom on the second floor, which Potter had “accidentally” wandered into. Draco was beginning to revisit the theory he’d had in sixth year, about Potter having a tracking spell on him. He’d have to douse his belongings in a reveal-all potion this evening. “Did you sign?”
To Draco’s surprise, she sounded disappointed and hurt that he’d not been there. Without consciously deciding to, he admitted, “My probation officer stopped by yesterday.”
Draco wasn’t sure how Astoria knew he was the one to do it. But then, the Greengrasses also had their own ancestral home. Perhaps Astoria, too, would spare her parents the pain of breaking it themselves if it meant getting one thing right, even if it was far, far too late for it to begin to matter.
"I'll be in my common room again starting tomorrow," Malfoy said in a rush. Like he was forcing himself to breach a topic that would otherwise be Not Worth Speaking About.
It ended up being exactly what they decided, after the vehemence with which both groups refused to sleep in the common room.
noise, her bag falling off of her shoulder. Draco did not slow down, nor did he look back to check on her.
Something briefly mischievous crossed Potter’s face, his eyes lighting up. “Mischief managed,” he said instead of answering, and Draco’s indignation was distracted by the accompanying tap of Potter’s wand against the parchment. The ink faded away, leaving just a worn piece of parchment in Draco’s hands.
“You wouldn’t,” Astoria said, giving him a funny look. “She’s hosting it in Slytherin.”
Malfoy frowns right back and Harry takes a moment to properly look at him, to properly
a student before.”
“A bit, yeah,” Potter admitted. He blinked at Draco, slowly, as if he’d been on the verge of falling asleep. But not in the manner that suggested he was bored. He’d pulled his knees up to his chest, pillowing his cheek on his knees to watch Draco pace. His expression was almost peaceful. “Ollivander tried to explain it to me, but I think he was making it up, honestly. You’re asking better questions about it than I did.”
Malfoy inhales, holding the breath for one second. Two. Harry finds himself imitating the act.
Draco was unable to respond; he had the sense that if he opened his mouth, he would simply burst into tears, or worse, undignified laughter.
Granger was just looking at him, her large eyes boring uncomfortably into his.
horrid. The classroom was filled already, more students than Draco expected sitting on any surface available and all facing the front of the room, which meant Draco was directly in their sightline. That roar of noise quieted, briefly, though Draco felt its loss the way he might lose air.
Their list of things Not Worth Speaking About seemed to grow longer every night, and Harry, unnerved by the sudden numbers of secrets he held, worried at the thought of this.
Malfoy led him through the corridors by the hand, and Harry felt a ridiculous sort of laugh rise up in him: Draco Malfoy, holding his hand and leading him to the Gryffindor common room.
often up to something, though until sixth year, it hardly counted as nefarious. The point being: it wasn’t wrong for Draco to be suspected. He had brought that upon himself.
,” Baddock hissed. He sounded alarmed. “He’s… and you’re...”
In short order, Draco had stiffly instructed her on the spells to detect and undo the dark magic lingering in the castle’s structure. Potter seemed perfectly content to stand at Draco’s side and add needless commentary like,
Without meaning to, Harry smiled. And Malfoy smiled back, and suddenly that gnawing feeling in his chest felt a lot less likely to drown him.
to leave. “I don’t want—you should speak to Lovegood and Thomas. I’m not—I don’t need anything.”
The Headmistress was still staring hard at him. “I watched the memory before doing so,” she continued, and Draco inadvertently sucked in a breath.
Astoria had told him, her dark eyes piercing and intelligent,
Potter, with more thoughtfulness than Draco anticipated, said, “I think I do forget, sometimes, Hermione does, too—” but Draco was already halfway down the stairs, no longer listening, the heavy door wedged open with a sticking charm and his school robes transfiguring into a heavy cloak between one step and the next, when Draco said, “Your existence is very sad, did you know?”
," Professor McGonagall said sternly, "that you will all behave yourselves, and that you understand the necessity of these measures."
Astoria hummed and didn’t explain further. After several tedious seconds, Draco said, “Astoria.”
“Why not? Because you said so?”
At first Draco thought he was mistaken, because he was so high up and the figure so far below. But Draco spent six years learning Potter’s slouch and the tumble of his curls, the way he wore his robes and the scuffing of his trainers. It was Potter, of course it was; Draco knew Potter intuitively, with death at his spine and glory under his heel. Of course it was Potter.
For a moment—just one—he considered dropping himself from the window, too, to save the other person the trouble of conflict. The student body was torn between pretending Draco did not exist at all and wanting to punch him in the face, or perhaps something worse, something vindictive that would ease the open, oozing sore the war left.
Heads craned in his direction again, the whole common room crackling with magic and anxious, angry energy.
“Is there a problem?” Draco asked, with every ounce of condescension he was capable of. He fairly towered over her, but the nasty expression on her face didn’t so much as falter at his presence.
Draco did like, even though he gave Potter a faintly suspicious look at the suggestion. But he laid down and was woken too soon after, having curled towards Potter’s warmth when he slipped into sleep.
Harry pulls away just long enough to say, “We should—” before he’s cut off by Malfoy’s searing, insistent kiss. A shiver that has nothing to do with the cold has Harry pressing closer, running his hands along Malfoy’s jaw and through his hair.
Myrtle twisted again, floating a bit upwards. “See? Humans haven’t been talking much to her anymore. I’m sure if you asked very nicely, she’d find a room to hide you in even if Minnie
“You don’t
"I will smother you in your sleep," he whispered, as if weighing the merits of the thought aloud.
“We should contact my aunt,” Malfoy says suddenly. They were sitting on the classroom floor with Harry still half in Malfoy’s lap, dinner long past and curfew creeping up on them.
With a flick—of her wrist, not a wand—a stoneware tea service floated over, along with a tin of digestives. “And our house is precisely what I wish to speak with you about,” she started, voice back to a familiar tone from her lectures.
“Nevertheless,” McGonagall continues, bringing Harry abruptly out of his musings, “There is no reason a sixteen year old boy would be involved with You-Know-Who. I would think you’d know better than to make allegations like that, Mr. Potter.”
The shattering of those illusions made up the next transgressions: the memory of every person who looked him in the eye before the torture began. A year lost to planning a murder, and nearly becoming the murdered, the murderer. The sting of dark magic funneling through his wand. A properly cast crucio. Lovegood and Thomas, who never flinched away from him, who always held his gaze through the cellar bars. The floors—flagstones and polished wood and ornate carpet—bloodied and destroyed, where corpses were left with their mouths still frozen mid-scream, mid-plea.
Thoughts were coming together in the corner of Draco’s mind not consumed with ringing. He said, with slow certainty, “You haven’t asked everyone.”
“It is patently absurd,” Draco was saying not ten minutes later, having stalked all the way to the Great Hall for the sole purpose of finding Astoria and venting about it. “No ward is
For one breathless minute, Draco thought that he was hallucinating. But then he crouched and pressed a palm to the stone and found that it was real. His fingers followed the carved letters with trembling reverence.
Potter looked pleased at this answer. “Yes,” he said, planting one hand on the stone ledge and tugging at Draco’s collar with the other, pulling him closer. Draco went, easily, resting one hand on Potter’s knee to keep himself balanced when they kissed. His letter crumpled under his palm, but Draco hardly noticed. He pressed himself closer, shivered at the swipe of Potter’s tongue against the seam of his lips and the hot dampness of his mouth.
If not before, it is now. A different kind of fight, a real one, with wars and prejudices and legacies echoing in the hot, stuffy air of the closed confines of the Hogwarts Express.
“Right,” Draco said, once it was clear that Potter was done speaking. “Only I don’t want it.”
Malfoy holds his gaze. Everything is softer in the wintry morning light, even the angles of his face. He says, “I’m fine.”
There was something thrumming under his words, something that put Draco on edge the same way he’d felt when he first saw Potter standing at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It wasn’t fear, exactly; just this gnawing sense of unease, as if Draco was missing something very vital.
“Old magic?” Harry repeated, lifting a hand towards the nearest bulb of color, the gold with a bright yellow core. It was wispy and faint, but pulsed like something living; he couldn’t touch it, but he could
The question douses them both in frigid lake water. Harry finds himself blinking stupidly, shocked at his own voice. Malfoy blinks back at him.
, exactly?”
“I suppose they wouldn’t have insisted on matching father-son tattoos, then,” Draco said finally, forcing himself to meet Potter’s gaze. “Really, you got lucky.”
. I’ll bet you have that sodding map on you, too.” He meant it to be mostly lighthearted, but a part of him, small but undeniable, worried that Potter thought he was up to something. Sometimes Draco was dubious in his belief that he and Potter had really started anew.
was never the one spending his evenings spying on boys who wanted nothing to do with him.”
Draco gave her a blank look. “No,” he added, when Astoria just blinked at him. There had been a very short period in third year, when Astoria first came to Hogwarts, where he and everyone else tried to call her Greengrass, but with her and Daphne being so close, it soon became impossible. Thus: “Astoria, don’t give me that look.”
the non-magical world, and the non-magical world is our world.”
It was almost midnight when Draco gave up on distractions and got into bed, drawing the curtains around him.
Draco’s breath came out in a wheeze. The Headmistress looked at him steadily, mouth downturned. After a time, she said, “You do have the option of doing your N.E.W.T.s by owl, if you will not attend classes like the other students.”
, Theo had said, but clearly nobody had said the same to Potter. He smiled, a quirk of his lips that Draco had to look away from. Not enough time had passed since Halloween, and so Draco continued to be jarred by the ease with which Potter levelled such genuine expressions at him.
It had been worse, in person. To slip past the rudimentary spells that kept students away and approach the gaping hole that had once been the old sixth- and seventh-year electives wing. The ruin slid down the wall, the first floor completely exposed and the ground floor bearing spell damage that Draco could feel biting at his flesh when he ran his hands along the crumbling stone.
As there was little of interest that could follow that initial
Potter stood with the wind tugging his curls roughly upwards, his robes undone and flapping like a black and crimson flag. From this angle, Draco couldn’t see his expression, but something about the line of Potter’s shoulders suggested that perhaps this was a good thing, that perhaps some expressions were meant to be hidden for the protection of others.
went by myself to the first meeting, you know. It was horrid.”
It was funny. Draco would stand at the place Headmaster Dumbledore’s body toppled out of the tower, and think about how truly funny it was. How funny, that Dumbledore had offered his help while he was dying, while the school was being invaded; how funny, that Draco thought for a moment that he would be saved, that he
Professor Sinistra held up a hand, and Draco’s words dried up in his throat. She was quiet for several long seconds; her face remained impassive. Eventually she asked more questions—which memory, who watched, what discussion was had after—and Draco answered, quickly, guiltily, until Professor Sinistra finally sighed and said, “There needs to be more structure in order for a method of sharing like that to be properly effective, Mr. Malfoy.”
It must seem funny, Draco thought darkly. He had the bright, blinding certainty that Potter, too, must find it so now; that perhaps his reason for not asking Draco anything since that morning after Halloween was because he no longer felt anything.
"You can't," Malfoy said, twice as irritated as before. "Have you ever even looked at
She sounded curious. Most people had seen Draco and Potter together in the library or in classes, and perhaps at Hogsmeade station before break. But there was a level of remove to it all; as much as people were still trying to get Potter’s attention, there was a hushed nature to it now. Like they’d forgotten, until they saw Draco at his side, that Potter, too, had done terrible things in the course of the war. When they were spotted together, people seemed reluctant to get close, as if they both held something contagious.
sent the letter. You tell me.”
“And Thomas’ and Lovegood’s. It could have been mine. That’s the point.” Baddock’s cheeks had spots of high color, the most animated Draco had seen him since the gobstones tournament. “It’s—perspective. Some people still don’t want to see it, even when it’s right there in front of them, but it
Potter reached out without looking, startling when his fingers knocked into the stack of books and sent them wobbling. He stared at them, face slack with surprise. His fingers curled into his palm, very slowly. His throat bobbed and Draco watched its movement with rapt fascination.
, the one who wanted another option and ended up choosing Harry’s trainwreck of a destiny to hinge his own life on. This is the Malfoy that infuriates him.
“I couldn’t get in at all,” Potter continued, with lingering resentment. “But during the Battle, you got in with Crabbe and Goyle after us. How?"
Officer Abbott-Jones noticed. So did the other officer.
Draco’s head jerked upwards, his face flushing. He had a wild thought that perhaps Officer Abbott-Jones was a Legilimens, and that all his Potter-related thoughts had been blaring like a Sonorous Charm to the throat. But she was smiling, looking a little amused, and—
“You didn’t
His cheeks a pleased pink, Malfoy says, "Don't bother with flattery," and unceremoniously plucks the tin from Harry’s hand. He takes a bit of the paste to rub at a spot high on Harry’s neck.
She turned towards him, mouth pulled into a vicious little smirk. As if she’d been waiting for a chance to confront Draco directly. Perhaps she had been. Draco kept walking, eating up the space between them with that cold anger spurring him forward.
The breath Harry huffs out hangs in the air, accusing. “Well, Malfoy,” he says, caustic, “what else am I supposed to call the bastard that’s been buggering me stupid for the past four months?”
Potter didn’t acknowledge this; his jaw was still tight when Draco drew level with him. While Potter stared stubbornly out of the window, Draco pulled the folded map out of his bag along with the stack of Potter’s novels. It had been those that made him decide to find Potter despite the way his heart contorted at the thought; the excuse of returned items was much simpler to parse than the fact that Draco was suspended between persistent disbelief and deep, unabiding fear.
“You asked,” Draco snapped, going pink in his anger. “I’m telling you. You don’t have to like the answer.”
“Well,” Draco said, at length, “I suppose. If there will be sweets.”
And because Malfoy is nothing if not the bane of Harry’s entire, woebegotten existence, he says, “I am Marked, actually,” and lifts his fucking sleeve.

Potter laughed, short and startled. Draco could feel his mouth pulling into a smile, unwillingly, in answer. It had been a long time since he made anyone laugh. And he’d
“Neither have you,” Harry counters, though he doesn’t know if it’s true.
The first problem, part two: some people you will kiss, and it won’t change you. When Harry kissed Cho, all he’d felt afterwards was discomfort, the kiss eventually fading and forgotten in the back of his brain. Even now, he averts his eyes when he sees her.
“Well only a little,” Astoria said, her nose tilted upwards. Her face was very cool as well, her dark eyes haughty as they fell on the crowd in front of them. The crowd that was watching them intently, blues and yellows and reds against their twin green and silver. There were so few Slytherins back this year. Astoria’s grip was still tight around Draco’s arm.
But Draco couldn’t possibly begin to explain the multitude of convoluted reasons that ran through him when he’d written the letter; couldn’t describe his conversation with Greg, or reveal how often he revisited the memory of seeing Potter off on Halloween, the flutter of a pulse under his knuckles. How he wanted to learn the words that would make it possible for him to become someone who would not be so wracked with guilt, who could be gracious, how he was terrified that he would never be that person. Weakly, Draco said, “
“Malfoy?” he asked, thick and slow with lingering sleep. He put out a hand and touched Draco’s cheek, then blinked a few times and pulled his hand away. He suddenly looked a lot more awake, and significantly paler.
And when Potter noticed his stare, he only knocked their knees together again, softer, before turning his attention towards the front.
Draco opened his eyes. He said, “You do realize it’s Halloween tomorrow?”
She said this with the same pride that once swelled in Draco’s chest, tinged with a nostalgic fondness. Draco felt a rush of gratitude towards her, dispelling the apprehensive ache in his shoulders.
“You aren’t a Legilimens, are you?” Draco asked, once, dubious at the idea but worried nonetheless. He had a vague notion that he would prefer walking into the lake with stones attached to his ankles than let Potter catch a glimpse of the thoughts in his head.
“Too bad we don’t have our brooms,” Malfoy said thoughtfully, as they walked.
That startling feeling from Halloween blossomed and choked Draco’s airways. He pulled away as if burned, crossing his arms over his chest. He swallowed thickly, uncertainty turning his hands clammy.
Draco’s chest twisted up again. He told Astoria, “We wrote to each other during break.”
“It’s not—” Potter huffed, dragging a hand through his curls and turning his head away. Abruptly, he asked, “Have you worked on the towers at all?”
“He won’t find out,” Malfoy says, the edges of his anger beginning to show through his control. Harry knows that Malfoy’s occlumency shields have been sharpened to a killing point by Bellatrix, but that won’t be enough, can’t
He remembers, mouth dry, months late, that some things are inevitable, and Malfoy has always been one of them.
“No, that’s not—why would I go to Hufflepuff’s common room?”
One could still call what they’d been doing
“Merlin,” Draco said, off-kilter. He wanted to laugh, but didn’t have enough air to do so. “Yes.”
if he finds out what you’re planning on doing with your memories, Malfoy!” Harry shouts. “And that’s
a trap, and it was right after the Battle—”
“No.” Baddock was beginning to look annoyed. “It’s not
But he walked up to read it himself anyways, nudging Queensbury aside. If he were to be dreadfully honest about it, Draco had expected a denial. He knew perfectly well that for all the post-war talks of reconciliation—some that he was certain were lifted straight from literature following the first war—most people in the wizarding world, especially those whose knees Draco sat upon when he was growing up, were unnerved at best by the idea of integrating the worlds any minute amount.
“I—understand,” Draco said, because it seemed like the right thing to say into the expectant silence.
"She didn't," Dean—
He runs like Dudley is after him, when he was seven and breakable; like he’s one faltering step from finding his head in a toilet or his throat in a chokehold. Runs like he’s escaping the graveyard, like he’s escaping the Death Eaters at the Ministry, like if he runs fast enough and long enough, there will no longer be any bodies at his back.
The Headmistress’ mouth pressed into a fine line. “Today, Mr. Malfoy.”
, perhaps, invented a sprawling tale as he used to as a child, and an illusionary version of himself who was friends with Potter, who Potter could come to care about—who Potter might already care about, who Draco cared about in turn. But then, who would believe it?
“I don’t hate you,” Draco said automatically. He was almost certain he wasn’t allowed to hate people anymore.
, and Malfoy says,

doesn’t wrestle the situation back to the start.
Harry’s half-convinced Malfoy doesn’t eat anymore. It’s going on a full week that he hasn’t seen Malfoy across the Great Hall during lunch
“Of course not,” Draco scoffed, feeling a smug grin tug at his mouth. He curled his fingers into the parchment, exhilaration thrumming belatedly through him. For a moment he forgot about Potter’s possible suspicions, his own burrowing worries; for a moment, Draco felt perfectly untouchable, eighteen and unhurt. “You’ll have to work harder than that, Potter.”
the members show up and play a match, so…”
Malfoy's eyes narrowed at him. "I'll sleep on the floor then, will I?"
The next person who spoke was not Professor Applesnap, but the student who’d been locked in a battle with Queensbury. Her spectacles were silver and rectangular, and she sniped, “But you’re a Slytherin. The Slytherins all fought with You-Know-Who. Everyone knows that.”
Draco was more than a little surprised to find Baddock stopping him the next morning, his face screwed up in something that was not-quite friendly. It was the same expression he’d been wearing any time he looked at Draco recently.
Potter turned his head, towards the owl perches, and said, “Everyone else seems like they wanted to be.”
made Potter laugh before. It was a good, uncomplicated feeling that settled warm and comfortable over his chest, like a duvet first thing in the morning. Safe as the crawl of sunlight against his thighs and the feel of his magic in his hands. Draco had so few things that felt safe these days. Fewer that he could hold onto.
emotions that had been so transparent.
Ron throws a companionable arm around Harry’s shoulder and drags him inside the compartment, where the rest of their friends are already lounging. Harry waits for the discomfort to come, but it’s distant and ignorable for the moment. His shoulders stay relaxed under Ron’s lanky arm.
Instead, the words brought a ball of something thick and confused to the base of Draco’s throat. It was about Potter, a little, for the memory of a broom ride in a burning room; about Vince, too, who Draco missed with a fierceness that seemed impossible; but mostly it was about his mother, who loved him so uniformly above all else.
Harry, hands twisted into the crisp fabric of Malfoy’s button up, holds himself very still. Like a plaster wall.
at him, as if Draco had handed him a puzzle piece he hadn’t realized he was searching for, his brows furrowed. His eyes were so green. It was as infuriating now as it had been when Draco was eleven and fourteen and sixteen.
Start a war or end one. Harry is tired of decisions that are earth-shattering.
“Right,” Potter said, his chest heaving. He’d gone a horrible, mottled color, like he was caught between throwing up and passing out. He stood, nearly upsetting the table with the abrupt movement. Draco heard the harsh pant of his breath from across the table. “Attempted murder was a far more fulfilling way to spend your nights, I’m sure.”
still doing his classwork. Since one of the terms of his probation was to complete his N.E.W.T.s and graduate from Hogwarts, he could not afford to let it go as he had his attendance. Keeping track of assignments was what syllabi were for.
Draco, who had not anticipated any gifts this year, given the drain of the Malfoy vaults and the conspicuous lack of friends who may have once provided such gifts, immediately pulled it against his chest. He narrowed his eyes. “I didn’t say I wouldn’t take it.”
Draco had never once thought about it. Next to him, Granger was nodding, as if she’d heard this before, or perhaps made the list herself.
is about?” the Gryffindor prefect stage-whispered, in a manner that suggested that she had her suspicions, none of which were kind.
“Nothing,” Harry responds, feeling flustered. Guilt is a living thing in his throat, growing thicker and darker with every passing day that he doesn’t muster up the courage to tell his best friends about Malfoy. He’s been practicing this part, if only in the space of his own head, since McGonagall’s office: Malfoy is a Death Eater. I saw his Dark Mark. He told me everything.
It was the wrong thing to ask. Draco knew it was even before it came out of his mouth. He’d watched Potter's dot on the map for the long minutes that it lingered on the steps outside the Entrance Hall in the dead of night before finally getting inside and heading up to the Gryffindor Tower.
“Will you be committing an atrocity?” Draco asked, into the pillow of his arms. His eyelids drooped without his permission.
“Certainly,” Draco said. But he knew a graveyard when he saw one.
“About what?” Draco demanded, a wild curl of fear taking residence in his chest. The shape of the Owlery and the pitch grew and melded, equal terrors, equal threats, in the back of his mind. “About your nightly sojourns into the fucking forest?”
,” Draco said, still outraged, still confused, still staring at the map that was quickly explaining some of the most embarrassing moments of his Hogwarts career. “What the

with him. And for what part? There were too many for Draco to parse through: their faces tilted towards each other, and Potter’s blithe statement for Draco to let him back into the castle, and the way Draco had stayed up bleary-eyed and anxious instead.
The thought of sitting by a low fire, listening to the water move against the curved windows on either side of the mantle, was so enticing that Draco was halfway across the darkened room before he realized that someone was already there.
“I won’t deny that Mr. Malfoy has been acting differently this year,” she says. There’s an emphasis on the word
Harry didn't particularly want to talk about it. Talking about it meant he'd have to think about the warmth coursing through him, and how he'd always been attuned, really, to Malfoy's presence. This was somehow no different, even though Harry knew that it
know,” she said, conspiratorially. Draco just looked at her blankly.
It was unfair. Harry was the one who should be hacked off, really. "You can head back, if you'd like," Harry said, with mock-sweetness.
Potter set his jaw a little more tightly. “No. But it also wasn’t, wasn’t fair of me to try to force you to talk about—when you didn’t, uh, want to—”
Baddock gave a little twist of a smile. “I don’t know. It’s hard to tell what helps, sometimes. But I don’t think it hurts.”
a fucking git?” asks Ron, who enjoys covering for the way Harry sometimes goes tongue-tied when he’s supposed to be fighting with Draco by loudly insulting Draco in Harry's stead. At some point, Harry will have to tell him off for it; he's beginning to enjoy it
Potter looked a bit guilty, which only made Draco more mistrustful. “I just wanted to—”
heading this way, walking right up to the Slytherin table, managing to look concerned and uncomfortable at the same time. Draco watched his advance with the sudden recollection of the voice that had called out to him when he got out of the Headmistress’ office yesterday. Draco had forgotten about Office Abbott-Jones’ comment, and the subsequent humiliation it caused; and it occurred to him that perhaps it hadn’t been
Draco spent the next few days with knots in his stomach, equally certain that nothing of note had transpired and that something momentous had. He jolted every time he heard footsteps near his spot in the library, or coming behind him in the corridors. It got to the point that Draco accidentally startled Baddock very badly, pacing furiously as he was in the common room on one of his sleepless nights.
“Did you?” Harry repeats. The bald accusation speaks for itself; the chance that the answer will change anything between them is less clear. “Think it was an honor?”
, he thinks of telling his eleven-year-old self,
He was still looking at the bookshelf when he said, “Do you think McGonagall would let me leave campus tomorrow?”
“Potter,” Draco returned. It was strange to say it so evenly, so easily, but not stranger than the Owlery, not stranger than the feeling of Potter’s eyes at the back of Draco’s head. Not so strange that Draco didn’t venture a remarkably steady, “Good afternoon.”
Something in Greg seemed to loosen. He looked up, towards Draco. His emotions were usually so easy to decipher, but Draco couldn’t for the life of him name the one that flitted over his face when their gazes met. “Yeah,” Greg said, voice breaking with something deeper than sadness. “I thought maybe I was the only one.”
have to sleep next to Draco Malfoy? Surely that was too much bad for a single person to have to carry?
But even that unpleasant thought was pale in comparison to the sweet pain lifting Draco’s chest as he observed the castle and its inhabitants. Every class was smaller this year—so many people could not return, or would not, and yet the castle was still brimming with little black dots: clustered in common rooms or Prefects beginning their rounds or stray couples and loners wandering classrooms, towers, stairwells.
Draco flinched despite himself. Greg was close now. Even without the girth that he’d had all his life, he was a threatening figure, radiating violence that Draco knew he could follow through on. His fists vibrated at his sides. “You always acted like—but you were
the same, too,” she explained, “which is why it’s such a rare magic!
So he said nothing, and the shadows lengthened along the ground as Draco conjured birds and charmed the grass improbable colors and sent a shower of sparks, silver, into the air.
Malfoy sat up, too, his eyes wide and mouth parted open in surprise. “Old magic,” he said, wonder in his voice.
that,” Harry hisses. Narcissa Malfoy must love her son, but all he can see when he thinks of her is the distasteful look on her face back in the summer before fourth year. The day it feels like the war properly started, even if they didn’t know it then.
up here? You weren’t in class today, and I just—just wondered—”
From behind him, heavy steps came up the stairwell. Potter’s voice followed a moment later. “Hey. I thought you wanted to see if Dennis’ dad could get in?”
They haven’t talked about this, the touching. A war and its machinations are easier to talk about than the tiny secrets of each other’s skin.
Hermione frowned in thought, clearly trying to remember some passage in a book. "That magic only shows itself when two or more people share the same intense wish. It has to be
“Oh, I
The game is this: find where it hurts. Stick a fingernail into it until the skin breaks, until it burrows through the flesh to strike bone. Harry doesn’t know how to win this game. He doesn’t know how to lose it, either. Since the beginning, he and Malfoy have been making up the rules as they go.
Past Potter’s head, the sun was red against the horizon, staining the sky gold and pink. Like something out of a dream.
Creevey continued, his eyes flickering towards Draco and away again, “Even though we lived with him, magic wasn’t something he saw, or understood. I mean, we weren’t even
nice.” His voice cracked slightly.
The grounds shook violently around them, startling them apart. The middle of the room went ominously quiet.
.” Then, more than a little interested, “Right now? Here?”
“She thinks it would help to send some to the Prophet, to garner public support,” Astoria explained, which was not the bit that Draco was confused about.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Madam Pomfrey greeted, her eyebrows going up. “You’re early today.”
Draco shifted under his covers, half-awake, and felt his mother settle at the other end of his mattress. Her eyes were particularly luminous, her skin unusually pale.
It felt like the crux of it all:
“You’re gonna tell me anyway,” Harry says. He sits up and scoots forward a little, until there’s only a palmful of space between them. “Don’t bother pretending you won’t.”
next to her plate, looked up from the page and asked, “Draco, how did you take down the wards at Malfoy Manor?”
It also ended up being the quietest night Harry had ever experienced. Ron, Harry, and Neville took their turn in the bathroom first, each looking more gloomy than the last.
With a final, pointed look at the Gryffindor prefects, Professor McGonagall exited. The chilliness of the room plunged straight into ice, broken only when the Slytherin prefect cleared her throat and said, “We’ll need to be directed to the dorms.”
“I assumed that’s how you wanted it,” Draco said, feeling a scowl pull at his mouth.
Draco felt that same curl of fear as before and made a sharp, halting sound, but Potter kept talking, his voice having fallen quieter: “And anyways I shouldn’t have gotten mad, I was just—I don’t like, uh, talking about it, the forest, and you always—you’ve always pissed me off, and I—”
, and Draco did just that. He was two weeks ahead in his classes, but was suddenly unsure if that counted for anything when Office Abbott-Jones and her list of prohibitions were sat right there with a blank face and the power to put him in Azkaban if he’d forgotten one.
“I shouldn’t have,” he said, at the end, his voice rushing in that pathetic way it tended to when he was uneasy. “It was—I acted rashly.”
Lived knowledge.
It was not about how he felt about Potter, in particular, though perhaps it had always been about how he felt about Potter. It was about the fact that he'd seen Potter at eleven, eyes covered by the sorting hat; and he'd seen Potter at seventeen, a stinging hex to the face. He’d seen Potter flying against him on the quidditch pitch, and he’d seen Potter making faces at him from across the Great Hall, but perhaps most pressingly, he’d seen the way the Dark Lord spoke of Potter, of the honest, vitriolic hatred that made Draco’s own animosity seem so laughably, painfully childish.
“I don’t,” Draco interrupted loudly. He wanted to leave. He
Instead, a feeling that was nearly rage in its potency lit Draco’s chest when he heard a semi-shouted, “Malfoy!” as he and Astoria walked to the castle after disembarking from the carriages.
Potter just looked at him. He looked at Draco for an unnervingly long time, and Draco looked back, an old contrariness rising in him. He simply wouldn’t look away until Potter did first. It was the principle of the thing.
After a pause, Greg said, “Well, okay then.”
Harry wants to incinerate the lot of them.
It never came. Or at least, not in the way it had once, when the world was much simpler, at least for Draco. Potter sort of—grimaced, a weird twist of his mouth, like he had no idea how to respond to Draco but was unable to ignore his presence.
"...shouldn't even be heading outside. Or did you forget that you have a sodding murderer after you? I should have stayed in that horrendous common room instead." He sounded supremely hacked off.
, Draco wanted to tell Potter, earnestly,
“Ignoring his summons would ensure a death sentence for my mother,” Malfoy says, voice icy, icy calm. The red in his face betrays his mounting anger.
Potter, who was oscillating between working on the ruined remains of the curved wall and the crumbling staircase, looked vastly amused at Draco’s tirade.
Harry shrugs an insufficient shoulder.
“It worked well?”
wound, from the time before magic; when Harry was small and thin, and thought that help would come if he only explained what the monster was.
been staring. He wanted to
Draco had envied the quiet of those children. He was unable to train himself into silence, even during the war; he’d just kept it all bottled in his head, an endless babbling stream that worked as a neat trick of making it seem like he had no occlumency shields, though he did.
is evident in how he stiffens when someone touches the back of his neck, and how his skin prickles when he gets a hug he doesn’t expect, and how he wants to crawl out of his skin when he’s stuck shoulder-to-shoulder in a crowd for too long. Those touches are inexplicable things. Harry is continually braced for the blowback.
Another shudder ran through the castle, a stronger one. Draco’s hand, which had been at Potter’s shoulder, fell to clutch at the stone wall, Potter doing the same opposite him. They shared a bewildered glance.
true that Draco had never given up the chance at using another person’s secret for his own benefit.
“I don’t,” Draco agreed, his voice equally low, but quite a bit sweeter. His heartbeat was roaring in his ears, though it was distant compared to the swell of silence pressing down on him from the others in the room. “You’re right. But as I said: here I am.”
This, too, was a world Draco could take part in. If he was willing to take the steps, and open the door, and see where it led.
“Didn’t you—” he starts, then realizes that no, they probably
Draco curled his free hand around his wrist, still warm from Potter’s touch. “The library,” he said, taking a step back.
He half expected that he wouldn't sleep. But eventually the sound of Ron's familiar and newly comforting snoring—so Zabini
“Well,” Draco said, hesitating. “I was a bit of a Death Eater.”
Harry catches himself first, then spins and hurries out of the room; hurries until his feet trip over each other, until he’s running down, down, down the staircases and through the corridors, dodging clanging armor and startled ghosts and ignoring the shouts of the portraits he passes.
He won’t. Obviously. But when he gets back to the castle, he still captures an irate Malfoy—sporting the beginnings of a black eye from their earlier fight, after Harry stormed out of McGonagall’s classroom and right into an already frazzled Malfoy—and drags him into the nearest classroom to make up for the injury. The confrontation had been short and explosive, and now, in the falling twilight, Harry can’t figure out why it happened at all when
Madam Pomfrey had pressed another cup of floral tea into his palms when he jerkily nodded his need for one, and when she asked, with that that briskness with which she asked everything else, if he wanted to continue speaking with someone else about his experiences, Draco surprised—well, only himself, probably, when he’d said yes.
The sky was right there, and the long drop to the ground, and the dark press of the forest, but Draco looked at Potter and found Potter already looking at him. Lyra crooned once, then took off with a grand flap of her wings.
“Shut up,” Harry whispers, just as he gets the cloak open. He pulls Malfoy close, spinning them so Harry’s back is to the wall. He holds the ends of the cloak above his head, hiding them both from view so he can frown at Malfoy.
Draco met with Headmistress McGonagall two days later, the morning bleak with noisy rain. She always treated these meetings as if they held actual meaning, but Draco understood that they were really more of a formality, possibly enacted because he was a dangerous parolee who now inhabited the very same school he had allowed Death Eaters to attack.
It wasn’t as if he chose the worst memory, of which there were many; he’d only wanted to show a glimpse of what the Dark Lord had been like, to put actual action in place of the abstract thoughts that his classmates had been spouting. Hardly even three minutes altogether: the Dark Lord’s monologues about impure blood, his unnaturally long fingers at the back of Draco’s neck, curving over his pulse; the short walk down to the dungeon that kept the prisoners; the flash of Lovegood’s dirty blond hair, of Thomas’ blazing glare; the sound of Bellatrix’s laughter as she reached the cell at the end, where the Muggles were held.
Harry made an appropriately sympathetic noise and added nothing further to the conversation, because it was Not Worth Speaking About.
The realization left him oddly numb, body very rigid. He’d always assumed that when he got thrown back into Azkaban, he would feel ill and horrified and furious. But there was nothing. Just the singular, ceaseless thought:
“Oh, good,” Khan said, beckoning him over with an impatient gesture. Draco, who half-expected a reminder by proxy of the upcoming gobstones tournament because of the frequency with which Baddock pestered him about it in the common room, walked over with a sigh.
It was true, and so Draco went. Walking the familiar path to the Slytherin table sent a wave of nostalgia through Draco’s chest; it had been two months since he was properly inside the Great Hall. His eyes swept across the tables and snagged, predictably, on where Potter had just settled into a seat next to Weasley.
be saved. How funny, that Headmaster Dumbledore sent the man Draco knew as a Death Eater, who had stood emotionless while Draco was branded the summer before, as his envoy of safety. How funny, that the Headmaster would not speak to Draco himself because he thought the Dark Lord would break into Draco’s mind while he was absconded in the confines of Hogwarts stone walls.
Draco made an odd, hitching noise. He was so incurably overwhelmed that he had to leave the flat and do terse laps around the grimy, slippery block until he could blame his heart rate on the exertion.
They were climbing the staircase nearest the Great Hall at the same time that Granger, Potter, and Weasley crossed the corridor ahead of them. Draco and Baddock stopped at the top of the stairs in silent agreement; across from them, the trio’s steps faltered, but only for a moment. Granger’s eyes swept determinedly past them, and she resumed walking immediately, a curl of pale blue yarn spilling out of her bag; Weasley locked eyes with Draco, but with a weary look followed after Granger without saying a word.
Malfoy’s glare falters, his mouth falling open slightly in surprise. It’s the first time Harry’s rendered him speechless without being on his knees.
“I can’t
There’s a joke there, Harry is certain of it. The punchline is that they’re both drowning. It’s very funny if he refuses to think about why it makes him want to shatter the windows and bring down the walls.
. Greg was still standing on the staircase and frowning down at Draco and he wanted to know
Draco said, “You weren’t forthright in your letter, Mother.”
Draco had a hundred horrors crowding his brain, and each morning began with a new one, a memory uncovered only in the stark light of the dormitory’s bathroom in the early morning. And with it, a new affirmation of the truth of his character, held in hands that trembled under the cold spray of water that always, for a second, seemed the color of rust.
Something about that answer releases the tight coil residing in Harry’s gut. “Okay,” Harry says, and struggles into a seated position while Malfoy folds himself stiffly next to him. He tosses something heavy and warm Harry’s way without looking at him.
“Right,” Draco agreed, though he wasn’t sure a statement had been made. And then he did look at Potter, he had to; and Potter had the strangest look on his face, guarded but bright, impossible to look at and impossible to look away from. Draco felt his throat bob with anxiety and a wild sort of hope, constricting his airflow in equal measure. Draco hurried past Potter to get out of the classroom, to get somewhere he thought he might be able to breathe.
had grown even more insular. Their hands were always reaching for each other, heads always bent close, names always in each other’s mouth. Draco was still jealous of it, of them, but it was fitting that they had each other while Draco had hexes to block and solitary sojourns to suffer.
to render the parchment blank, then stared at it so hard that his eyes crossed. His head was beginning to pulse with a headache.
“Well if
Draco gave her a suspicious look. “Who?”
Draco looked at her. He narrowed his eyes. “You think he got fit.”
Potter was just

to talk about it. Not just the sex—though that was good, that was
And then Draco reminded himself that he was nothing, actually, and in fact Potter might yet want to kill him and may want to do so even more if Draco were to say something so clearly callous about his regard for the well-being of their classmates. So Draco shut his mouth with a click and turned his head away and said nothing.
Harry can’t decide how he feels about this. He thinks he would admire it, if he learned about this relentless determination in an ordinary context. It’s awful and intoxicating, how desperately Malfoy clings to life.
Worse, Potter was staring right back. For a prolonged second, it was just that: the two of them staring blankly at the other. Draco, already wound to painful attention, braced himself further as he waited for Potter’s reaction with shallow breaths.
. If only to wrench the control back for a moment longer, if only to savor one more breath.
. But that was not the right word, if he had done it all to himself. Surely that negated it, if he did it to himself?
“That’s good, isn’t it?” Potter shifted, his legs stretched out in front of him so that the toes of his trainers bumped Draco’s thigh. The touch sent a shockwave reverberating into his gut, his chest.
Harry didn't answer; he was already sitting up and shoving his glasses back onto his face. It was a better idea the longer he thought about it. By the time he got back, Malfoy would be asleep, right? And if Harry never fell asleep, they wouldn't wake up all—all tangled together and confused.
Draco speared bacon from the serving plate with perhaps too much vigor. “Unpleasantness?” he offered, when the silence threatened to spread down the rest of the table.
“Harry Potter?” scoffed Officer Evergreen, the officer that had been by the floo. Officer Abbott-Jones watched from the other side of the small room, and only raised her eyebrows when Officer Evergreen looked at her.
A flash of white blond has Harry pausing before he steps inside the compartment Hermione and Ginny have already claimed. Draco is making his way through the throngs of students, face set into his default haughtiness. It flickers, briefly, when he spots Harry.
“That’s what happened when I got my wand,” Potter said, face lit by the glowing bubbles, a suspended Lumos, bobbing over their heads. It was nearly dark, now; Draco had lost all track of the hours, hadn’t even spared a thought to the continued oddity of the situation, or the fact that Potter had remained sitting with him the whole while. “The sparks.”
Astoria squeezed his arm. “And yet none quite so terrifying.”
The meeting would progress thusly: the Headmistress would open with a cordial greeting and an insistent demand that Draco take tea and biscuits; Draco would oblige. The Headmistress would make noise about how Hogwarts was an educational institution, that Draco was once a good, consistent student and prefect, that his classmates would be his future colleagues and that it was important for him to interact with them; Draco would sit attentive and contrite, because he understood that he had fallen rather spectacularly from ill-begotten grace and would remain as such, given that his name was as good as counterfeit galleons and that his classmates would never respect him again.
, the shocking heat of his hand over Draco’s. The distance between them seemed to dwindle daily, hourly; and Draco was still no closer to being sure of anything, let alone whatever it was that he and Potter were heading unerringly towards.
—and so he barely noticed when he was being led to the Slytherin table in the Great Hall until Zeller and her shockingly bright yellow tie and crest sat across from him. The sight shook him from his musings, half out of an instinctive surprise at seeing someone forego the house tables.
Draco was beyond tired of his nightmares—the ghosts of Cruciatus damage in his nerves, the open-eyed slackness of the dead, the immovable stain of blood smeared along his palms. Half his nights he woke with Professor Burbage’s voice ringing in his ears—
Malfoy’s scowl darkens. Even quieter, like the hiss of dead leaves across stiff grass, he says, “I’m upset that he didn’t.”
Greg gave a mocking laugh that Draco had never before heard aimed at
“Properly?” Potter asked. He was almost accusatory. “You properly fancy me?”
Draco ran through these things now, quickly, as a manner of humbling himself before he did something stupid, like mock Potter for his continued inability to string a fucking sentence together.
“I’m tired,” Harry starts, haltingly, because Malfoy’s stare is so intent that it doesn’t cross his mind to not answer, “of not being listened to.”
They weren't friends. Right? They barely spoke to each other in the daylight now, and when they did it was different from before, as there were fewer insults and arguments. Mainly, they avoided each other and pretended that they didn't notice anything weird about their nightly excursions.
looking at it, and he couldn't remember the last time the sheets had been washed—surely the house elves did it with some regularity?
Harry wasn't sure if that was a
Draco tore his eyes from their backs. “What part?”
Draco did not realize he was waiting for Greg until he saw him coming down the staircase. Greg and Vince had always been among the last to leave meals, and that was clearly still true now, the lunch block having whittled away into nothingness while Draco walked the castle halls and then stood, unmoving, at the base of the stairs.
After a moment, Myrtle seemed to realize he didn’t understand. She floated forward, giving Draco an unpleasant shock of cold when she cupped a hand around his ear and said, “Hogwarts, of course.”
Draco was ensuring that the support charms would hold while the rest of them ate when Potter materialized at his side with half a sandwich and the statement, “We’re going to need brooms to deal with the damage on the top half of the tower. Hermione said it’s too unsteady to use the stairs any further up.”
Draco watched his struggle with satisfaction. “What are you doing with all of those, anyways?” he asked.
“You could sleep,” Potter said, very casually. He reached across Draco to steal the mug back, then stayed there, turned towards him. “If you like.”
The first problem: Harry’s skin has never fit right. He doesn’t know what to do with his hands, or why his body wants things he’s never known how to get. He has a thing about it, probably, one he’s not sure even Ron and Hermione know about. His
, she had said, and Draco hadn’t realized how young she was until then, until terror had stripped her completely—and those were still the good nights.
In the nightmare, he never can.
But of course, where else would he be? Vince had suffered a most complete cremation, and as far as Draco knew, Vince’s father hadn’t been able to hold any sort of ceremony in Vince’s memory before his sentencing. For the first time, Draco allowed himself to wonder what had happened to the Crabbe estate in the moors of North Yorkshire, whether it had been ransacked as the Manor had been, left dusty and unprotected; and wondered what happened to Vince’s possessions, his room.
. Harry shakes his head, leans forward again with a faint, “You’re right.”
of the word
Draco offered his hands, palms up, to Potter. Potter’s hands were warm and strong; not slippery with sweat, or burning from the proximity of flames. Draco pulled Potter up to standing. He’d grown taller when Draco hadn’t been around to notice, but so had Draco. He felt that height keenly now. It had been a very long time since he’d used it.
Harry keeps his gaze on the silhouette of the Forbidden Forest, to save himself from seeing whatever expression is on Malfoy’s face. “Does he?” Harry asks, heart beating nearly in his tongue.
, she had said,
But still. Draco hadn’t imagined the twist of Potter’s mouth, or the flex of his hand. He’d watched Potter too long to be mistaken about something like that.
, this morning) and how he deserved relatively less that he currently had, before concluding with the particularly important reminder that he had never managed to be all that important to anyone, for any reason, aside from his mother and father, and even then, only conditionally.
How dare he, Draco thought with a clarity that was nearly peaceful, nearly of the level that leaning out of the Astronomy Tower window invoked. How
And if they woke the next day, in the same position as the first day, well. That was also Not Worth Speaking About.
Draco sat, unnerved. He kept one hand at the edge of the window; the other held his wand, though he had no idea what he meant to do with it. He’d spent an afternoon in the Malfoy family vault until he landed upon his grandmother’s wand, for all the good it did. It was not nearly as steady as his own; his magic felt strangely charged whenever he used it, at once too strong and spluttering out of power in the same instance. But he held onto it, just in case.
how rude it is to cast spells on other people without warning, or does she just not care?” Malfoy shifts, the transfigured bed dipping as he sits up. When Harry doesn’t answer, he asks, “Are you feeling alright?”
, and the tip of his wand lit like a beacon.
“Yes,” Draco said, squinting at the figures flying around the tower, dipping in and out of the broken roof.
“You haven’t even done your O.W.L.s,” Draco said, standing with his arms folded in front of them. He’d re-erected the barrier at their approach, though everyone who was already on the other side was unaffected.
God, but it isn’t. He’d spent the evening before proving just how filthy his mouth could be, and this morning showcasing its sweetness. Harry digs his fingers into the door of the compartment, to distract from the way his stomach is knotting itself.
The Battle crashed forward in the way Khan, her prefect badge glinting in the low lights of the dungeon, abandoned her wary hold of the line dividing the room to spin towards Harper and snarl,
"Whereas I," Draco's voice caught, his very ribs feeling on the verge of shaking right apart, "I just wanted to find you."
Draco swallowed, sitting up slowly. Discomfort thrummed in his blood, quickening his pulse. “Potter,” he said, equally slowly, trying for a tact that he had never learned, “You understand that Godric’s Hollow will be very—
"Fine," Harry said, biting on the bait Malfoy so clearly wanted him to take. "What's this old magic do?"
, Malfoy had said, once, anxious and unhappy, and Malfoy isn’t stupid, so Harry had kept his tongue rather than point out the obvious. For nearly an entire minute.
"Merlin, you'll wake the whole castle." Malfoy strode past him, heading towards the Great Lake, likely having realized that Harry wasn't serious about the Forbidden Forest bit.
Draco was out of anti-nausea potions. His hands were still shaking. When he turned to retrieve a new batch, Madam Pomfrey was watching him the way she had when Draco, choking on blood replenishing potion, woke and realized with a crushing, consuming sort of despair that Potter had not managed to kill him at all.
“Why did you come back, then?” Draco asked. It should have shattered the silence, but in fact slipped neat and unobtrusively into the air.
Malfoy makes a small noise, like a frightened animal, because Bellatrix Lestrange is walking up the Hogsmeade street, easy as you please.
“That isn’t—that’s not—” Harry slants a look at him, stunned by the force of Malfoy’s vitriol. Malfoy’s tone is always more telling than anything he ever says. “I don’t want a fucking dildo, Malfoy. I didn’t mean—”
Potter rubbed at his eyes, pressing his glasses up into his curls, and sat up. “Skipping,” he answered, a yawn cracking the word.
They walked in silence for a while longer, broken only when Astoria said she needed to get to Herbology. They adjusted their path, and Draco watched her out of the corner of his eye. Astoria was polite and charming, and, in all the time Draco had known her, he’d only seen her speak to someone who wasn’t a pureblood once, classes notwithstanding. Last year, her voice shaking as she hurried a thin-faced Ravenclaw out of a corridor the Carrows had been patrolling. They’d flinched at the sight of Draco, and he’d pretended not to see them or their flinch.
“He’ll kill you
got more points than you. You’re
Harry swallowed the crushing disappointment back. He didn’t want it to be. He’d do nearly anything, to make it not be the last time.
wants me t’be on his stupid team?”
For one reckless moment, watching their classmates part with ease, with awe, as Potter strode forward, Draco wanted to take Potter by the shoulders and holler
Draco laughed. It was a good laugh, unfettered. Astoria’s expression shifted into a small, conspiring smile, before she turned her attention back to her book while Khan, who rumor said had been responsible for warding the Slytherin common room against intruders during the Battle of Hogwarts, demanded that Draco explain what he meant. Several other students looked equally invested in the story, though perhaps less out of the academic interest of Khan.
And before Draco could think to ask what
of a swooping gut and immediate recognition, his heart turning in his chest.
“I just grabbed whatever was interesting on these shelves,” Potter explained, still paging through his book with a little frown. Draco craned his neck to read the page as Potter stopped flipping through it; there was an illustrated picture on one side, completely unmoving, and large, child-friendly text on the other. Muggle children’s tales, then.
It’s quiet out here, blissfully so, which is why Harry hears the soft crunch of footsteps long before they come to a stop next to him. Malfoy leans over him and blots out the moon, his hair loose and swaying slightly in the breeze, his nose and cheeks red with cold. His winter cloak makes his body one long, dark line against the bitterly blue sky, in sharp contrast to the pale glow of his face and hair. He’s beautiful, which Harry already knew. It’s only that he never lets himself think that, normally.
“Baddock,” Draco greeted with stiff politeness, taking the empty seat across from him. As revenge, he waved a hand towards Astoria and said, “You know Astoria, of course.”
Harry snarls, as Ron and Hermione watch warily from their perch on the plush couch. They have become invested in helping hatch their madcap plan, if only because Harry is one half of the equation, but they seem to have a moment of regret in coming to meet them in the Room of Requirement again.
Just as suddenly, the shuddering stopped. Hogwarts’ magic flared over them again, a softer caress, before flickering and fading completely. Slowly, Draco lowered his arm; at his side, Potter was doing the same thing. It couldn’t have lasted more than a handful of minutes, but by the dazed looks of everyone else, some having fallen to the floor in the commotion, it might well have been hours.
Draco jolted. Potter looked at him as if that wasn’t a loaded fucking question, casually asking about Draco’s bigoted, Dark Lord-supporting parents, one of whom was in Azkaban. And anyway—
Just as he was heading back towards the dormitories’ wing, Greg called out, gruff and quiet, “Draco?”
As soon as he felt their attention shift to him, Draco began instructing the group on the necessary spells to scour the dark magic and repair the damage. He wanted to be done quickly, acutely aware that a group this big would be very difficult to miss if any prefects or professors were to walk nearby during their rounds.
Draco swallowed heavily, a tight knot in his throat.
Draco blinked his eyes open. “Then probably. Why?”
in a school uniform?
Malfoy promised to tell Harry everything and, to his surprise, Malfoy
seemed wholly insufficient. “I’m—I could—I was a bad friend. To both of you.”
They stole an empty section of the blanket not occupied by food or students laid out to nap, watching as Ginny, Creevey, and two other students—Hufflepuffs, from their yellow scarves—took to the skies.
“I’m quite alright without it,” Draco half-lied. He also took a step back, because he remembered the last time Potter pointed a wand at him. And in any case, it had been used to
This made something that was nearly misery twist and settle in Draco’s gut. “It was my memory.”
Potter was watching him. His hand was shaking where it gripped Draco’s wrist. “You didn’t like me, then.”
, then left Draco to return to Hogwarts with a promise that she would be back in a few weeks. Draco wasn’t sure what to call the expression on her curved, gentle face, and thinking about it only resulted in the worst possibilities: disgust, scorn; pity, which was the result that had Draco climbing the steps to the Owlery in the first place, heart beating almost angrily between his ears.
He pushed the covers away and did not look at Malfoy. He could feel his gaze, though, heavy and considering on his back.
“Fine,” Harry bites out, the word coming up his throat like bile. Something flickers in Malfoy’s expression. “
“It is!” This was ridiculous. It was like they were kids again, Draco reflected while tamping down on the urge to stamp his foot against the ground.
he expected to hear; more diatribes in the vein of the Malfoy who taunted him on the train at the end of last year, maybe. Or that puffed up bragging from when the compartment was filled with Slytherins, before Harry was uncovered and the accusations of stalking started up. Certainly more of that snarling he did right at the beginning, when Harry first caught sight of the Mark.
“What I don’t understand,” Hermione says, when they’re gathered in a room created by the Room of Requirement, simple and sparse in walnut browns and creams, “is why you didn’t go to Dumbledore first thing.”
It was so desperately strange. Draco tried to imagine his mother cooking and couldn’t. There was a side table with the Black family crest carved into the dark wooden top next to what appeared to be a plywood bookcase. For some inexplicable reason, seeing Narcissa absently place a teacup on its edge made a lump from in Draco’s throat.
Harry has to swallow a bunch of flippant responses to answer, “I am.”
Haltingly, Draco tried to describe the stand-off in the common room, and how he thought it might—do something, to share the reality of what transpired, and not the spin that the most conservative members of the public have already taken to heart, that so many were already parroting.
“Don’t you?” Potter asked, which was nonsensical. Of course Draco didn’t like gobstones. It reminded him of Greg, and of Vince, and of other broken things of childhood. Draco didn’t like gobstones. Draco wasn’t allowed to do the things he liked. He always liked the wrong things in any case.
or at the least, appeal to Snape for assistance.
“To join the gobstones team,” Draco said, because it was obvious.
His irises blown are wide and there are teeth marks trailing the length of his flushed neck, sweat glistening along all his bare skin; he says that, in an unsteady mocking lilt, and he’s the prettiest thing Harry’s ever seen and Harry wants to leave another mark on him to see if that will help.
Something about her tone set residual anxiety fluttering through Draco’s gut. “I have check-ins with her,” he said, feeling a flush run across his face and down his neck.
Which: of course he did. Draco had never done anything right in his life. Maybe even his promise to himself, about not making his mother pay for his funeral, was the wrong choice. Maybe she’d have preferred it.
Malfoy’s lip curls, creeping fracture points along delicate glass. And more than the name-taking, more than the closed fists, Harry absolutely
“Does she
, Draco tried to remember, but it was a faraway thought with Potter watching him quietly in the dead of night.
Baddock’s eyes widened in alarm and then, just as quickly, hardened into something more solemn. “Did someone do something after viewing the pensieve? Khan said she didn’t see you come back when she left for bed, but—”
Professor Applesnap’s nostrils flared. Behind her, her students stared at Draco with either fear or disgust or both.
“Mm,” Harry responds indistinctly, stealing his glasses back and shoving them onto his face before making it all moot by dropping head against Malfoy’s shoulder. The wind blows crisp, orange leaves into the open arches of the tower, the last stubborn vestiges of autumn.
“But why don’t you want it back?” Potter sounded genuinely aggravated by this. “Is it the Elder wand thing?”
Draco wanted to say something pithy to diffuse the charged atmosphere that rose between them, but a ball of worry and confusion was lodged in his throat. “Then—then why even bother—”
. The sounds rose, a cacophony that sent Draco’s pulse to dizzying heights.
“Malfoy,” Potter said. It felt like it had been a very long time since Draco had heard his name, and longer still since he heard it in Potter’s voice. It strummed a forgotten chord in Draco’s chest, vibrating along his bones.
It’s not what Harry expects to hear. He isn’t sure
“What?” Draco said, nonplussed. He felt almost as if he should be offended.
“Maybe she plans on taking us somewhere else to talk?” Harry drags the toe of his trainers through slushy snow, leaning against Malfoy and wondering vaguely if the cloak will hide them both enough to sneak a snog in—they've gotten very good at quick snogs and handjobs in inadvisable places—when he spots a figure that turns his breath to ice.
After a time, Baddock said, “It’s weird, isn’t it?”
It was unsurprising that the fall of the Malfoy Manor wards was common knowledge. It was part and parcel of that lovely gift of good publicity that Lucius had given the ineffectual Ministry in the immediate aftermath of the battle, the illusion of adults being competent enough to clean up the war that children starred in, and part of the reason Lucius had anything to bargain about Draco’s sentence over. No one had to know that it had not been the Aurors’ wiles or the strength of the Ministry that led to the capture of so many Death Eaters and sympathizers behind wards that had been in place since the tenth century.
. The thought makes Harry want to laugh, which makes his nose twinge. Hermione’s brisk
“I know,” Draco said after an excruciating pause. He felt awful and idiotic, someone that couldn’t trust what he was seeing and hearing and feeling. “I—the map.”
They get dressed quickly, walking out of the classroom and into an uncomfortable and tense stare-down. Hermione is vibrating with self-righteousness. Malfoy drips with unwarranted self-satisfaction. Possibly Harry should have said he
Harry closed his eyes. When he did, he could hear various whispered arguments being carried out around the room, which didn't help his rising temper. He opened his eyes to find Malfoy glaring at him. "Then I'll just transfigure the bed—"
“I know,” Malfoy says, equally soft. But he can’t possibly.
do without Saint Potter? The
Draco wanted to sink into the stonework, but instead he said, “Yes.”
“You can break the skin,” Malfoy continues, in that same voice. “But the Mark will always look the same.”
Draco tried to breathe through the vice in his chest. Oh, he was so
The facts were these, shared by a tight-lipped Professor McGonagall as she stood imposingly at the front of the Gryffindor common room in the middle of the night: by some great mystery, the Slytherin common room had gone completely up in flames, sending large amounts of smoke into the dormitories and decimating most of the common room. The dungeon, being a dungeon, was structurally sound, but the castle was working its magic to fix the other damage done by the fire. Ergo, every student in Slytherin had to be moved, spread across the other three houses until the damage was repaired.
. Harry’s mind couldn’t get past this.
“No,” Potter said, too quickly.
Malfoy looks away first, turning his whole body so that Harry mostly has a view of him in three-quarters. His body is a long, tense line when he speaks.
“Your advisor should have released the roster,” she said, no longer shouting. “I would
He said that last part accusingly, as if Draco knew Potter was on this strange quest and had intentionally forestalled him.
Draco comes to a stop, and with a slow, deliberate sneer, says, “Potter,” like it’s the foulest thing to have ever come out of his mouth.
"Huh," Harry said, thinking hard. He thought about the past week, and the feeling of Malfoy's hand in his the whole way back to the dorms, and all the other things Not Worth Speaking About.
Draco was revising his Herbology essay when Malcolm Baddock walked up to him, discomfort rolling off of him in waves. Draco didn’t look up, though he knew half the house was watching. Draco’s presence was a source of deep fissure in the house, and most seemed perfectly happy to ignore his existence entirely when he did linger in shared spaces.
So he visited one of the damaged wings.
, and—and he woke up next to Malfoy. It’s a sappy sentiment that he will not divulge.
the parties have to be in close proximity, to trigger it. For you to have seen it affect such a large space..." Hermione trailed off, sounding intrigued the way she always did when presented with a curiosity. "Either a
“He said it wasn’t my concern,” Harry says, interrupting the fit Malfoy is working himself into. Harry stares at his hands, says, “He—I don’t know. I don’t think he believed me.”
Narcissa apparated them to the Manor, directly into the deceptively bright courtyard. Faintly, through the gaping doorway, came pops of apparition and crashing glass, swearing and, horribly, screaming.
, he whispered to himself; and he couldn’t recall how he’d once said the word as if it was something to laugh about. It wasn’t. But Draco always learned those sorts of things too late.
Heart pounding, Draco stepped towards it, trepidation crawling up and down his spine. But of course nothing happened when he reached it. The memorial remained as it was, a curved sculpture aiming upwards, set into a stone slab which held the date of the battle and the words
All said, it was the least sexy come on Harry had ever heard, which Harry decided to point out to Malfoy as he tucked himself under the covers and tried very, very hard not to brush up against the other boy.
They took to the repairs in groups, focusing on different areas of the tower as clouds wisped across the sky, the moon impossibly bright. The tip of Draco’s nose grew red and chilled as he moved through the tower. The air coming through the open, jagged wound in the tower wall and the holes at the top of the tower were still winter-crisp, and Thomas—who had exchanged one very terse nod with Draco before being whisked away by Lovegood—performed an artful bit of spellwork to keep the atmosphere in the tower warm despite the occasional gust of cold air.
Malfoy’s hands abruptly tighten. Harry jolts, a brief flash of panic overtaking him for no reason at all, until he looks at Malfoy’s face. He’s scowling at a spot on Harry’s shoulder, but he doesn’t seem mad at Harry.
They were nearly at the entrance hall now, and the corridors were beginning to fill with students leaving breakfast. There were already more people than Draco had seen in weeks turning and staring at him and Astoria, then turning back to whisper to each other. Claustrophobia encroached on Draco, a stifling need to escape crawling up his spine.
Draco startled at the coldness of his voice. “Why not?”
Zeller’s eyebrows shot up and Baddock jerked to wakefulness. Both of them stared at Draco, and he wondered if perhaps they really
“Yes,” Draco answered stiffly, just as Officer Abbott-Jones stepped through, wiping soot from her rust-red robes, black piped.
Draco dragged his face towards his mother, who was looking at his father. The curiousity surrounding this statement was dim, unimportant; Draco was reveling in the curl of his fingers; Draco was reliving the sounds of Vince’s death.
Draco often searched for some small, innocuous thing to write about—the grounds, the assignment he was working on—and ended up with less than half a page for his efforts.
He, at least, had some experience with it.
good, and Harry kept saying so, liked he was awed by it all over again, until Ron had started making exaggerated gagging noise at him—but the tiny truths that had emerged since September: the curl of Malfoy’s sweaty hair, and the rumble of his laugh, and the way his voice changes when he needs to be talked out of the closed loop of his brain, and the infuriating circles he talks when they’re arguing, and the nightmares they swap when they’re curled around each other like ivy, boneless and defenseless and secret.
It was objectively horrifying for Draco to know he’d sat in the Hospital Wing and cried all over Madam Pomfrey. He woke this morning with that lingering, wrung out feeling that accompanied a long overdue sob, but—as with any good cry—a bud of relief settled at the bottom of his ribcage as well.
The nights that Harry doesn’t sleep, he scripts letters he won’t send. Sometimes he composes them in his head; other nights, he writes them out in a furious, endless scrawl, his hand cramping with the force of all the things he has nobody to ask about.
Draco stared at the smooth stone columns that held the covered walkway up. There was a dissonance. There was a dissonance ringing high and clear through Draco’s skull, but he couldn’t understand it. It was just out of reach.
made it past his lips, and shame coalesces into a tight ball at the bottom of his stomach. It shouldn’t be what he’s focused on, anyways. There’s a more pressing problem to deal with.
In the small space between their heads, Malfoy laughed. Harry found he rather liked the sound. "Good night, Potter."
“Maybe not,” Potter agreed, grabbing a stack and raising an eyebrow.
he’d asked, in a different sort of voice, if Harry and Malfoy have
“Fuck,” he breathes, before remembering that Malfoy was doing this specifically to distract him from the conversation they need to have about the Manor and what it means for their conversation with Andromeda. He curls a reluctant hand around Malfoy’s wrist. “Wait, wait. I was trying to say something, Malfoy.”
“Why are you
Harry grimaces, the dream fading. It was half memory, the feeling of Malfoy’s fingers twisting in his hair, the pink flush rushing up his neck. Harry knows that much. He
Harry stalked to the door, and heard a very faint snicker at his back. When he turned around, Malfoy was pulling the Weasley jumper over his head. His pale hair was tousled by it, and he looked amused as he got fully out of bed and padded across the room to Harry.
Voldemort finding out that you’ve been
“Then why’re
Draco opened his mouth to say
The cold stone was a mercy compared to the other horrors Draco had seen. It was a horror he could remedy, which he had never been able to do for the flesh and blood. And it was a sight he could spare his classmates from stumbling across, as he’d spared his mother and the younger, not-Hogwarts age children that huddled in the Manor wings while their parents bloodied the world in their name.
“You don’t—” Draco had to clear his suddenly dry throat, lightheaded with incredulity. “You don’t have to explain anything. I shouldn’t—
“Here,” Potter said, at the door. He shoved an old piece of parchment into Draco’s hands while Draco was distracted by his internal seething.
Faster than Harry could ever remember, they were at the doors of the Entrance Hall. He pushed it open, a gust of warm, end-of-season wind lifting the edges of the cloak up.
Enough, also, to tell that something is—off. Wrong. Malfoy’s hands have gone odd and ill-fitting, trying to recapture movements it doesn’t know anymore.
Draco turned his head to glare at him, wavering at the expression on Potter’s face. It wasn’t anger, as he’d suspected he would find. But he didn’t know what it
“Okay?” Draco wanted to point out that Potter was an aggressively average flier that could nevertheless help, but had a feeling that Potter was in fact going to propose something much worse.
, he’d said,
“And you came up with folklore?” Draco asked dubiously, leaning forward to pull a volume at random towards him. It wasn’t a book of children’s tales, like Draco expected; it was titled
“Maybe we should write to her,” Greg said, haltingly. His hands were fisted at his sides, face folded into one of his big frowns. He hadn’t looked away from Vince’s stone.
“Oh,” said Potter, as if he’d just realized the same. Draco’s irritation flared higher; he pushed away from the table, feeling himself go pink as he shouldered his bag and snatched up his wand. He’d always been so stupid about Potter. A little attention and he just—just went and got so desperately ahead of himself, without even
So Draco sent off an owl order for a gobstones set and stood with a hand on either side of the wide, open windows of the Owlery, the breeze lifting his hair, the sky a blameless blue, and he looked down, which was the only reason he saw Potter at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
“Sit,” Draco said, surprising himself and half the table. Astoria only gave him a closed-mouth smile, quick and serene.
Maybe Harry just isn’t the sort of person help is meant to come to.

What is it about Malfoy? What
“Malfoy,” said Potter, voice still rough and underused. He had his school bag thrown over one shoulder, eyes wide but, somehow, not surprised. “Hi.”
going to do that.”
“I,” Malfoy says, his voice quiet and petulant, “thought he would believe you.”
doing here, anyway?” Potter asked, still sounding angry.
“He still hates you.” It was good to say aloud, staring at his wan face in the bathroom; grounding. A way to stop Draco’s brain from extrapolating wildly, illogically; a tendency held over from a solitary childhood as a means of making the world more interesting, and so Draco had to kill the delusions before he began to indulge in them.
This was said much in the same way Potter had mentioned about his family, which was the only reason Draco frowned, but was not the reason Draco said, “Well don’t be a kicked crup about it. I’ll owl you something.”
It was a brilliant plan, except for the fact that as soon as Harry shoved his trainers on, Malfoy was up in a flash. Harry had a brief, shining hope that Malfoy was off to the loo or something equally inane, but then he started to pull a robe—a dressing robe, snatched out of the genuine air—over his pyjamas.
This is how the game ends: Harry asks
“A glamour,” Potter repeated, as if he’d never heard the term before. He blinked, lethargically. “I had to do that the first time I visited their grave, you know. Hermione and I used Polyjuice.”
When the silence persisted into a discomfiting length, Draco gave Baddock a firm nod and headed towards the entrance hole. To his surprise, Baddock followed, pausing only to grab his bag from the table.
Most importantly, of course, Draco would remember that Headmaster Dumbledore had known about his task. That Headmaster Dumbledore had known Draco was not a killer, because the Headmaster knew that Draco had been trying, in his ineffectual way, to kill him. That the Headmaster knew that Draco was Marked. That the Headmaster knew that Draco would fail in his task. That the Headmaster knew no one had expected Draco to live. No one expected Draco to live.
An heir going back to the home he was trying to escape had never crossed Harry’s mind. It should have. Malfoy has never questioned Harry's will to fight in the war, but Harry never asked what role
that Malfoy thinks of him first and foremost as
He had to swallow it back to be able to speak. “I went for a walk after dropping off my trunk.”
Potter began showing up out of nowhere, just like those lost years before the war: catching Draco’s eye as they hurried down the halls in opposite directions, happening upon Draco as he left the Owlery, sitting in places Draco had meant to be, looking up with that strangely intent gaze he’d developed since that night on the pitch.
Draco sniffed and turned his head away. His heart was thudding loud and clear through his ears, as it had been since he and Potter made up that day in Charms. Draco caught Potter staring at him sometimes, these pressing, knowing looks that made Draco scowl and flush in turn; and since Draco was attending classes again, it wasn’t uncommon to find Potter shuffling over to sit at his side in their shared classes, then leave with Draco to head to the library. The easy nature of it had Draco feeling on edge, emotions churning heavily in his gut whenever he remembered the way Potter said
“Yeah, well,” Harry will say, legs still loose around Malfoy's hips and fingers worrying the fabric of Malfoy's shirt. “We need to trust
, Ron had said, with a strange note in his voice,
“Right,” Malfoy says, flat. His hands are resting at Harry’s hips, no longer trembling. Not clumsy or terrified, either. Just hands. Harry doesn’t know why he thought he could divine something from them.
Malfoy tugs on Harry’s hand until Harry lifts his head and looks at him. Malfoy’s eyes are very grey. They are locked unerringly onto Harry’s. “Because if I go, he’ll think I’m still afraid.”
This is the reason for the abandoned classrooms, and the soft ground behind greenhouse number 2, and the hidden alcoves scattered through the castle. For Malfoy’s mouth, and Malfoy’s hands, and Malfoy’s—
"Well?" Harry said, his voice coming out with a little wobble. He realized, quite abruptly, that he
Malfoy's eyes are a distant, overcast sky. Harry brushes his fingers along the side of Malfoy’s neck, to prove to himself that there’s a person there, someone more boy than ghost.
At this point, it shouldn’t even be surprising. Harry would only need one hand to count all the times he’s been in danger and an adult has actually believed him.
After barely a minute, Potter knocked their knees together. Instinctively, Draco knocked back, and Potter huffed out a small laugh that had Granger’s head snapping towards them like a hunting crup catching scent.
Draco, feeling very calm, said, “I’ve just had a panic attack.”
“I’m going now,” Potter interrupted, scowling. He shoved the wide oak doors open with more force than necessary. “Bye.”
Draco made a vague gesture, then, as disbelieving as he’d felt when the Headmistress said it to him, “To update my community service hours.”
Harry swallowed, thinking they were veering quite quickly into Not Worth Speaking About territory. "Just wondering if you'd look so smug if you knew that sweater was made by Mrs. Weasley."
Zeller’s eyes went wide. “Your probation officer was
Harry magnanimously decides the conversation can wait.
Malfoy shifted slightly, clearly also wide awake. A pity, that.
you the fucking thing—”
"Cheers, Blaise," Malfoy said, his eyes narrowed as he took in the sparkling silver dictating
Malfoy’s voice cools so immediately, it’s a wonder ice doesn’t fall straight from his mouth. “I’ve heard a dildo will do much the same, if you’re so eager to clear up the misunderstanding. I certainly won’t care.”
Baddock eyed him critically. Draco looked back down the hall, where
Draco did not ask, because he did not wish to court disaster. In his defense—and Draco was drafting these often, these frenzied attempts at justification, in case it should be required at any moment’s notice—he tried to exist in the same space as Greg for longer than a minute. It was a lukewarm attempt at bravery. Greg could not seem to bear being in the same room as Draco for that long, but then, neither could Draco; it was as if they both felt the Vince-shaped tear at their sides, but only while in each other’s vicinity, and so avoided being alone together entirely.
“No,” Malfoy says, very quickly. There’s something at the edges of his mouth, softer and more uncertain than the almost-grin from earlier. More boy than ghost, more Draco than Malfoy. Harry has to avert his eyes, otherwise he might do something idiotic like kiss him softly, without any teeth.
Potter’s face had been tilted towards him, and he’d been wearing Draco’s transfigured cloak, and whenever Draco tried to play out the rest of it, the
The Headmistress stopped speaking. The chatter swelled into a crashing wall of low-voiced gossip. Draco blinked enough to realize that he’d been staring sightlessly across the hall, and with the realization came the disquieting awareness that he’d been staring right at Harry Potter without noticing for what seemed, suddenly, to be several excruciating hours rather than a handful of equally excruciating minutes.
Possibly he was beginning to recognize the heft of guilt as it pressed against his body. He looked to Greg, a slumped blob of black in front of the fireplace, his comforter pooled on the floor underneath him.
With creeping dread, Draco realized that Potter did not think of Halloween as Draco himself did, as most of the British Wizarding world did. It was not a dedicated chapter in a history book or bedtime story told in whispers:
Their gazes slid over to Draco, very quickly, like they’d had the same thought; Draco kept his own gaze on the platter of bacon, which he was no longer hungry for. He took a piece of toast from the stack. He thought about open air. He said, “Perhaps I should leave.”
He said it very simply, with the same easy knowledge as saying his name. There was a certain tightness, maybe, to the shape of his mouth, the set of his shoulders, in the silence that followed his statement. It was a look that sent Draco back to being eleven years old and bullying Potter for not going home for the holidays; he’d taunted Potter for being unwanted, and Potter had tensed up just this same way before spinning and yelling at him. Potter always looked like this when Draco had figured out a good way to hurt him.
, because Harry is certain that Uncle Vernon never once thought of Harry as
After a moment, Potter said, “I think you should try it, at least.”
Malfoy’s shrug is careless and practiced. “You already know mine.”
Malfoy’s mouth, the familiar shape and feel of it; he knows it colliding against his in the spare minutes between classes or warm against his collarbones or soft at the small of his back, and it still somehow feels like he’s going to learn something new, this time, when Malfoy’s mouth opens under his.
“That’s enough,” Draco snapped, some thin, buried thread stretched taut in his chest. His voice, as crisp and commanding as it used to be, crashed over the noise, stifling it for a brief, surprising moment. His chest heaved with the force of his voice.
Draco turned his head away, staring hard at the small print on the page of his novel. A sliver of guilt coiled in his gut.
Potter went still. Perfectly so, as if he’d been replaced with a stone in his likeness. He said, very slowly, “What?”
“I want to go to Godric’s Hollow,” Potter said, mildly, and Draco awoke immediately. He was confident that he was not meant to actually have this conversation with Potter, but before Draco could point this out, Potter continued, “I’d never been before last year.”
Draco Malfoy manages to be both.
This, talking about something that felt important and impactful without much care for the attention he was or was not getting from the neighboring tables, was better. It was better even though it was painful, and sad, and there was much less laughter.
And, just as clearly, Draco understood that Creevey’s petition had never just been about Hogwarts, or its students. “You want to bring down the veils.”
“Was it about getting your cock in my mouth? Personally, I’m in favor.”
Draco let out a weird noise, nearly scandalized. “It can’t be that easy.”
Draco opened his mouth to say it wasn’t, but his voice snagged in his throat.
All three of them turned to assess the state of Draco’s hair, which was still limp and damp from that awful smelling gobstones liquid. Draco bared his teeth at Potter, who had nearly laughed himself sick when Draco lost his first point and now bit his lip in an effort to suppress his laughter.
A month into the school year, Officer Abbott-Jones came to Hogwarts for Draco’s first parole check-in. Draco’s pulse, which had been stuttering nervously since he received the Headmistress’ summons that morning, rocked abruptly upwards at the sight of Officer Abbott-Jones already sitting in one of the foreboding chairs opposite the Headmistress’ desk.
, the day before;
Harry tries—and probably fails—to keep his expression neutral.
“Oh, is that what we ask about?”
He was still half-submersed in the memories, of Madam Pomfrey’s easy instructions—
Draco didn’t, because his set—an admittedly beautifully crafted collection of white orbs with blue cores—came in the week before and sat untouched beyond that first curious look after he’d ripped off the packaging spells. But fetching it to prove the same to Baddock was enough to put Draco’s growing mortification momentarily to rest. It turned out that Baddock had not suffered a night of broken sleep—though given the way Baddock rubbed at his eyes Draco was disinclined to believe this assertion—but in fact regularly woke up nigh five in the morning to review gobstones literature and practice on his own.
, he thinks.
“Yes,” Draco answered, wondering if it would be a horrible idea. Wondering if it would be an amazing idea. “Let’s do that.”
tomorrow, yes?”
friends,” he whispers angrily, shifting so they’re not so tangled up in each other. He starts to get up, appears to have the same realization Harry had, and pauses. He throws a cold look over his shoulder and says, just this side of vicious, “Some privacy, if you don’t mind?”
“Alright,” Draco said, when he was done, “If it’s that important to you, then I—”
“McGonagall told us to stay away from the unrepaired parts of the castle,” Potter was saying, in a quiet, frustrated voice. They’d migrated to one of the more open spots in the library, with impractical armchairs and tiny tables that Draco transfigured into a proper size, so he could obstinately spill all the books Potter had yet to read across its top.
"They could," Ron said darkly. Harry agreed; he couldn't see how sharing a bed with Malfoy would end in anything other than a trip to the hospital wing.
Once, during the most unforgivably early hours of the night, Narcissa had eased open the door to Draco’s bedroom. She used to do this when Draco was very young, though when Draco was very young, he never woke to the soft sound of the knob turning. Back then, Draco had simply known she’d been by through the pillows carefully placed back at the edge of his bed, away from his flailing limbs.
going to see if Creevey’s father could get inside?”
It was not a question, but Draco responded as if it was, remembering the promise he’d made to Baddock at the beginning of the year. “Yes, you should—you should talk to him.”
They walked over in a surprisingly easy silence and found the memorial as empty as Draco left it; only the different slant of sunlight marked the change in the day.
“I don’t know why I bother with you,” Potter said, rolling his eyes, and made to take the meticulously wrapped gift back.
“I understand,” he said, mouth dry. He needed to be out of this claustrophobic office, under the Headmistress’ claustrophobic gaze. He needed to be high up. He needed to see the sky. “I’ll attend classes.”
Draco’s mouth twisted in wry amusement. “And you think it would somehow be better if I came along?”
Harry turned back to Ron and Hermione as well, deciding he didn't really need to examine the slight thrum of disappointment running through him.
It took him several seconds longer to realize that Zeller was asking him, nearly glaring now, where he’d been the night before.
Baddock didn’t appear to need a response. His silence was almost thoughtful, though Draco wasn’t inclined to ask what he was thinking. He just kept silent as they continued to walk, feeling tentatively peaceful.
?” Harry hisses, pinning Malfoy with a glare. Malfoy lifts his chin with as much dignity as he can muster when he’s still sleep-mussed and half-buried in his pillow, which is a distressing amount.
Harry had been
Baddock made another very faint noise, this one more confused. “That was Potter.”
it about Malfoy? He’s a collision course and a synchronous orbit; everything Harry has ever hated and the only thing Harry has ever wanted. He’s the third constant in Harry’s life—death and hunger and Malfoy; Ron and Hermione and Malfoy—and the only one of them Harry doesn’t understand. If fate is real, it’s cruel, because even if they found themselves at opposite sides of this war, Harry Potter would still be defining his life with Draco Malfoy as an axis.
Draco leaned against the open doorway, amused and maybe something else, something he didn’t want to examine too closely, and said, “Surely you own a cloak,” because Potter was only in his uniform sweater and trousers as he fairly ran down the steps, his bag hitting his hip.
“Nothing,” Potter mumbled, then, “I still have your stupid robes,” and Draco made another equally embarrassing sound. Everything was warmth; even the curl of Potter’s voice added another layer of it, tenderly sweeping aside Draco’s worries to find more space to fill with buoyancy. It bubbled in Draco’s blood, making his mouth stretch into a smile Potter couldn’t properly kiss. It was, he thought, happiness. Stunned and growing, growing, growing.
His feet are light and flawless, his thighs burning and his chest tight, as he races out of the west exit, closest to the greenhouses, and keeps going. On and on, through the powdery snow and low hills until he’s at the quidditch pitch, serene and white under the moonlight.
It was this last one that burned, though Draco hadn’t figured out the reason why. He had no aspirations to become a Healer, and never had. Any draw he had towards it during the war had been pure survival instinct: he needed to know how to treat his nerve damage following the Dark Lord’s displeasure, how to stop the bleeding after Bellatrix conjured knives, how to splint a bone.
Greg’s words hit Draco hard, hollowing him out until he felt about two feet tall. Just as quickly, a vitriolic response welled within him, scalding his tongue, waiting to spill over,
“Viv and Verity,” Greg said, the names pulled painfully from him. Vivian and Verity Crabbe; Vince’s cousin and aunt, the only ones left with the Crabbe name. Or at least, the only ones still out in the world.
Draco, feeling heat rise into his cheeks, said, “I hope the vines get you next, Potter.”
Draco, rather unwilling, thought of the Room of Hidden Things. The idea soured immediately. “Perhaps not. Wait—Minnie?”
Malfoy stopped, his hands deep in the pocket of his dressing robes. He was frowning as he stared over the sparkling water. "Couldn't sleep," he answered shortly.
Officer Abbott-Jones closed the door behind her and let out an overly large breath. “Sorry about this,” she said, and sounded it. She even undid the binding charm, the lavender chord dissipating like mist. “But we still need to get your check-in done.”
think this way. Our world
He placed them on the seat next to Potter, then took a step back, his arms suddenly overly large and awkward at his side. He pulled them tight against his chest, as if it would settle his stomach, his heart; convince them to stay where they were meant to, and not jump from his insides as they wished to.
Draco had stood at the edges of their sprawling estate and spent three days peeling apart centuries of wards, because his parents couldn’t bear to, because he knew he must; he unveiled them like a gift, an offering to the ambivalent aurors he sent word to on the third day.
Behind her, looking very much like they’d rather be anywhere else, were Queensbury and the Gryffindor prefect. Draco felt a stab of sympathy towards them, as they both looked deeply apologetic.
“Well, yeah, I mean—they reported some of it in the Prophet,” Potter explained, defensive. “A lot of it wasn’t true, I don’t think anyone but Voldemort actually heard all of what I was saying—”
. Go get yourself killed then. If you never come back, I won’t
Draco searched for his own reaction to this and was presented with the memory of fear spiking up and down his throat when faced with a bound and injured Potter tucked between Granger and Weasley on the Manor floor. There was more emotion beyond that, but in the cavernous Great Hall, whose floors seemed permanently imprinted with where dead bodies had been laid on it barely four months prior and with its barely full house tables, Draco found that this was all that he could think of. Cold corpses and disappeared students and the glitter of Potter’s green eyes under the swelling, the dirty tangle of his curls, the sound of Draco’s own voice, deflecting, deflecting, deflecting.
“Hey,” Potter said, when he reached their part of the table. There was a chorus of greetings, but the force of Potter’s attention was centered on Draco, concern creasing his features.
He kept thinking about their two dots,
“Can’t you leave him alone this year?” Hermione demands in the aftermath, herding Harry towards the hospital wing. Her disapproving internal monologue is written across her face:
“They’re
“Surely,” Astoria agreed, hip knocked against the edge of Draco’s table. “But I volunteered you.”
, Hermione had said; Ron calls it that, too. Harry thinks about the word later, when the sounds of sleep have settled inside the sixth-year boy’s dormitory. Wonders if that word explains why he’d woken with the sudden, visceral need to figure out what Malfoy’s cock would feel like in his mouth.
, even though Draco himself hadn’t. Or, perhaps, couldn’t.
“That was very good of you,” Astoria Greengrass told him, when he was done. She’d wandered over while he’d been working on the parchment, her pretty face cold and then softening as Draco finished up the charm.
. Or maybe,
"The Forbidden Forest, of course," Harry said, just to see Malfoy's reaction. He laughed at the look on Malfoy's face, the sound too loud in the night air. It made them both jump, a guilty sort of feeling stealing over Harry. As he had never once felt guilty about breaking school rules, Harry assumed it must be because he was breaking those rules with Malfoy.
“Well,” his mother said, turning away. But Draco saw the edge of a smile over the rim of her teacup when she said, “It’s enough.”
She will ask this question again, much later; with the fire low in the grate in the Gryffindor common room and Malfoy off in the dungeons where he can’t begin his spiel on the cabinet and the pensieve and Andromeda Tonks, who might just be the elusive one-third needed to make their plan worth something. When it’s late enough that it’s only Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the common room, like a hundred times before, she will ask again, “What are you
“You’re the one who said you didn’t think there would be enough time to do the repairs,” Baddock said. “More people means it will go by quicker, right?”
Potter shrugged a shoulder, looking a little awkward. “I’ve always talked about you,” he said, and pulled away, turned his head. The back of his neck grew red. “We should get everyone out while Ginny gets the brooms.”
, Draco remembered. His breathing began to settle, though it remained shallow, lending a rasp to his voice. “Has it? Helped, I mean?”
“You can do whatever you like.”
She pulled her hand away. The serenity of her words quieted the panic that had been building in Draco’s chest but didn’t blow it away completely.
“I was kind of,” Draco repeated, heart pounding. He should have taken the memory back. His brain provided a plethora of possible endings to Queensbury’s statement: cowardly, pathetic, weak, useless, fucking disgraceful; and with each word was the panicked, helpless thought that Draco didn’t even know who had watched it, didn’t know how many of his classmates carried this hateful image in their heads because of his stupidity.
Malfoy asks, and Harry says
notice the Mark on Malfoy’s bare arm, caught up as they were in the incredulity of the entire situation.
“Excuse me,” he said stiffly, and fled. He walked fast, blindly; his chest was tight, and his face felt the same frenetic red it had when he’d been arrested.
The letter stared at Draco from its spot on the desktop and Draco, still feeling embarrassed by its existence, darted his hand forward to crush it and possibly burn it. Potter, clearly noticing, immediately lunged for it.
“You’re
, echoed in the silence after his words. Not an accusation, but a fact. For two years, they’d been everything but students: soldiers, and fugitives, and villains. Heroes, maybe, but Draco had grown up on fantastical children’s tales and was certain heroes never lived long enough to deal with the aftermath of their heroism.
Draco ignored the tea for long enough that it had grown cold when he finally picked it up. He reheated it carefully, cradling it in his palms for a long moment, just staring at the pinkish liquid.
The spectators had already made their hasty exits, as if they hadn’t even noticed the adult shouting at a
Of course, once Draco noticed, he couldn’t stop noticing. He’d always been like that, brain catching on a detail and spinning madly, and Potter had always been a mindless manifestation of that. So Draco noticed Potter’s behaviour; noticed, too, that the tight unit of
“It wouldn’t hurt to ask him, then,” Draco said, realizing that he was going to do something very foolish solely because he had the inkling that Astoria did not wish to be left alone.
“Okay,” Draco echoed, wondering if maybe one had.
Something tense and expectant loomed between them. That shocking, heady feeling from last night rose in Draco’s throat, amplified by the walls on either side of them and the sunlight reflecting off of the frames of Potter’s glasses when he lifted his gaze.
“You’re late,” complained Shardlow, who should be in
It had not gotten better with time, or distance. It seemed like it should have. It seemed like Draco should have been able to return from break having rationalized his way out of this feeling, finally triumphing over his incapability to regard Potter with any normal amount of emotion.
Draco turned his attention back to his supplies, mouth a grim line. The thumping of his heart seemed to echo right out of his chest and into the rest of the room, a panicked, vigilant sound that he was certain everyone could hear and judge. Trying to keep it contained, Draco ducked his head low just as the last few students came hurriedly into the classroom. There was a noticeable pause in their footsteps, one that commanded as much of a hush as Draco’s entry had. Draco forced his spine to lengthen, unwilling to be shouted down while in class by whatever Gryffindor—and it had to be a Gryffindor, the N.E.W.T.-level Slytherins were all accounted for—decided to stop at the end of his table. He turned his head with his eyes narrowed.
“Shouldn’t what?”
A peremptory pain wrung Draco’s chest when he concluded, “Then it probably doesn’t work for me anymore.”
“Malfoy, Draco?” the closest guard asked, looking at the list in his hand and not at Draco. “Under the care of Officer Abbott-Jones?”
Draco stayed where he was, too warm and too close. His grip on the gift tightened, that warmth spreading through his chest and staying there, overfull. “Happy Christmas, Potter.”
Maybe there was something worth speaking about, after all.
Harry holds a version of Malfoy in the palm of either hand. The first is the boy who, up until very recently, held Voldemort in actual esteem. This is the Malfoy that Harry ends up in shouting matches and fist fights with, who Harry tells to
“I don’t know,” he admitted, slowly. His gaze flicked up towards Potter. “Would you want your relatives to come?”
Draco took a few steps back, until he was leaning against one of the curved walls of the tower, newly restored and pebbled with intermittent white stones. The conversation drew the rest of the gathered students, but one pulled away and settled at Draco's side, their shoulders touching.
sixteen. It’s only everyone else that seems to think that war has an unpassable age line.
