Draco swallowed thickly and nodded. He forced himself to walk back to the statue. How long would he have after grabbing the dagger before the statue moved? He was wagering that it wouldn't be long at all.

"Please, be careful out there, you two," Susan said, turning to them as soon as she had Apparated them to stand in the shadow of the Sphinx. Her eyes were full of worry. "I know you can do this."
"N-nothing. Go away, Potter." He was struggling against his tears again, which felt physically painful to withhold. His throat was burning from the effort, and talking only made it worse.
"Yes," the skeleton said as it crawled across the floor to gather its bones. It used its elbows to prod the fallen ulnas and radiuses until they snapped back into place as if by magnets. "I am the Priest Akil. Sworn protector of Salazar Slytherin's body." The skeleton pushed itself up onto its knees and huffed. "Do you boys mind helping?" He nodded to the scattered wrist and finger bones that had slid and bounced several feet out of his reach. Harry just now noticed that the priest had been sitting in a chair in the back corner, effectively trapped by the cauldron and a table.
Hopefully, he would notice when Malfoy started to awake so he could move him to lean against the window. If Harry was going to avoid acting on his stirring feelings for the man, he definitely didn't want Malfoy to wake up and turn into a beautiful blushing mess at their position.
Potter's eyebrows scrunched together as he pushed himself up to sit as well. "And why do you think that?"
"I'll make him promise to behave," Harry said, but he knew from her pursed lips that she was doubtful either that such a promise could be procured or kept. "So...may I go?"
Draco felt an insane prick of jealousy at this revelation, and he immediately scolded himself silently for it. He had no reason to be jealous, especially not of a dead boy. He swallowed. "Well...fine. So, you're bi. That doesn't mean your feelings for me are real. It's absurd. We hate each other."
Potter laughed. "You look about as relieved as I feel. Just kind of too tired to express it. And starved." He looked sideways to Draco. "Did we eat today at all?"
Draco hastily withdrew his hand and fixed his sleeve back in place to hide the old scars. They weren't worth talking about. That was all behind him, though he fought the urge sometimes.
"I was sending a letter," Potter answered. He set his chilled and frothy butterbeer down on the table. "And McGonagall insisted I have lunch before I left. I will still have to go back and pack. I didn't have time."
Malfoy's tell-tale smirk appeared on his face. "You were the first enemy I thought of. And, you're a Gryffindor. It seemed...ironic enough to be poetic." At Harry's eye roll, his smirk disappeared, and he became more serious. "I consulted some books on prophecy too. The lines 'blood to blood, find one another' are a staple of many prophecies, it seems. It's how the people of prophecies can locate each other."
Harry closed his eyes and listened as Malfoy muttered an incantation to vanish his clothes and then laid his wand down on the vanity counter. Then he was being tugged gently in the direction of the shower until his feet hit the side of the tub and he stopped. The curtain shut with a swoosh.
Draco felt like he had a sunburn on every inch of his body. They were going to share a bed?!
"This is weird," Potter said, slowly turning to look in every direction. It was no use. What landmarks had been there only moments ago had now vanished. There wasn't even a tree or bush in the distance.
Malfoy nodded, but was seemingly distracted by another thought. "But that only takes care of half of it. 'What is seen will perish by the jackal.' There's...maybe it's referencing another Egyptian god like Thoth back there. I think Anubis was the god of death, and he was depicted with a head of a dog or a jackal, I think."
Harry followed Malfoy to the bikers. Some had already disappeared inside by the time they reached them. Now, all that was left was a large muscly man that looked to be about thirty and a girl who still had her helmet on. A long blonde braid fell down her back.
But Draco was pulled from these thoughts as the smoke began to congeal. It took on a solid form, condensing and curving itself to form the features of an old man that was undoubtedly Salazar Slytherin.
Finally, there were no more steps, and they both stopped on the landing. Just as they began shining their lights around them to search for where to go next, two braziers burst to life with fierce green fire. They stood on either side of a curved stone archway. Above the arch was another silver serpent head.
"Silencio!" Malfoy shouted. His spell his the banshee square in the chest, but her scream didn't even waver.
Draco rolled his eyes. "That's easy for a Gryffindor to say. Bravery is what you're all about."
Draco carefully tipped a few drops of the blood mixture onto Russia and recorked the bottle. Both he and Potter leaned forward to examine the drops of blood as they congealed themselves into a larger drop. Just as Draco's blood had done the night previous in Potter's office, the drop of blood now began to move across the map. It was headed southwest, definitely ruling out Europe as it bypassed the continent entirely. When it finally stopped and soaked into the parchment, it was not a dot. Rather, it colored in a whole country and labeled itself with two words - Salazar Slytherin.
Malfoy was busy wrapping cloth around his hand. "Yours can do the same to find me. And if we combine our blood, I think it will show us where to go to find these tombs."
Malfoy huffed out a breath that sounded like something between relief and resignation.
Potter shrugged a shoulder. "I'm surprised Slytherin is making a task without magic. But, if using cunning is the idea, then it makes sense."
Resolved to get to bed within the next few minutes, he crouched down and began to gather the fallen papers.
Beside him, Potter blew out a long breath and ran his hand through his hair, making it look deliciously ruffled. Draco shook himself and turned back to Susan instantly, though he knew his cheeks were the tiniest bit pink.
"I will, professor. Thank you."
Potter pulled off his pajama shirt casually. Draco's face flushed, and he had to hastily turn back to his bag and make a show of putting his things away while he waited for Potter to change.
Harry nodded. That was a good enough answer for him. It at least gave both of them something to think about on the second half of their journey. "Ok. I understand. Well, seriously, let me know if you think of a way I can help." He turned to walk back over to where he had left his book, but Malfoy suddenly grabbed his hand. He turned back to him, one eyebrow raised. "What?" he asked, because Malfoy looked perhaps even more startled than he was by Malfoy having taken hold of his wrist.
Potter was sitting on the floor in the middle of the room. He held a ladle in one hand and half of a hawawshi in the other. A small cauldron sat bubbling in front of him. He took another bite of the meat and vegetable stuffed pita bread and leaned over the cauldron to inspect the surface.
Both men suddenly grinned at that statement, sharing in the amusement since Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs were absolutely full of snakes and it would not be nearly as easy to locate the tomb as Potter had insinuated. But their shared moment was gone just as quickly as it had come as both adverted their eyes.
Draco threw up his hands. "But you just said-"
Draco rolled his eyes. "So, you didn't decide it was worth making up with Gryffindor until he was on his death bed?"
Potter nodded once he had relayed the message. "Should we take down the tent? Do you think we have everything we need?"
"I know. I don't want to, believe me," he said. "And that's partially why attachment and heartbreak scares me. I'm scared of feeling so low again. It was a scary time in my life that I barely made it through. I was always scared I would cut too deep or something and that would be it. Despite how low I felt, I never wanted to actually die." He swallowed and rubbed at his eyes with his free hand. He sniffed and pulled his hand from Harry's. "Anyway...I think I'm going to make some hot chocolate. Would you like any?"
"Well, I don't know that I'm willing to risk it," Malfoy said.
They both stopped just outside the tent. A gigantic brilliant green and black pyramid was now standing a mere thirty feet from their tent and blocking out the rising sun.
Susan nodded. "Right. Do you want me to take you back to your hotel?"
Cold swept through Harry as he jumped to his feet and drew his wand. His hip rammed into the desk in his haste to stand up, and the stack of ungraded essays fell to the floor with a thud and a hiss as sheets of parchment spread out over the stone floor.
A sudden banging made them both turn to look behind them. An archway had opened to reveal a final staircase leading upward. And from this doorway was coming the sounds of loud banging and shuffling. It sounded very much like something was trying to get out.
Malfoy nodded stiffly. "Then I still expect you to meet me in The Three Broomsticks tomorrow. Noon. Don't be late." He retrieved his mother's memory from the pensieve's basin, snatched up the world map, and was gone.
Harry ran another hand through his hair and then finally looked straight at Malfoy, stopping his pacing. "How did you know it was me that's the prodigy of Gryffindor?"
Draco was vaguely aware of the sound of a door closing as he magicked his pajamas and day clothes to switch places so he was now wearing cargo shorts and a t-shirt and the pajamas were folded neatly on the bed beside his bag.
The chamber glistened with stacks and stacks of gold galleons, silver sickles, and bronze knuts. An elaborate green velvet and platinum rimmed crown sat atop a marble bust that Harry recognized as Slytherin since it so resembled the statue he had seen years ago in the Chamber of Secrets. Beside this was an erect scepter set with an emerald the size of Harry's first as the top stone where tendrils of platinum wound around it. A shelf of scrolls and large tomes was next to a table with a crystal ball and a deck of tarot cards.
Potter raised an eyebrow. "No?" He shrugged and ate the bite of bun himself. "You need to relax," he said through the mouthful.
"Egypt," Potter said, finishing the sentence for him. He turned to stare at him and then finally blinked. "I've been so stupid. Bill Weasley used to work for Gringotts bank as a curse-breaker. Here. In Egypt. He took the whole Weasley family on a tour of the pyramids before."
written across the body in slanted black calligraphy. "Derek, tell River I've found the next set of prodigies and you all should meet me back at headquarters after you've finished lunch."
Emblazoned on the back of every jacket was a large black badger, its claws being drawn through a tall letter 'H'.
"Lumos," Draco murmured, and the tip of his wand lit up. The narrow beam of light stretched across the floor in front of them where it revealed the bottom few steps of an obsidian staircase leading up into more darkness.
Harry set the vial on his desk and turned away. He moved to a cabinet crammed into the corner of his room and opened it. When he returned to the desk, he was holding the pensieve. "McGonagall gave it to me when I started teaching here." Two years of teaching at Hogwarts, and he still refused to call her Minerva.
"Malfoy-" Harry began, looking over to his companion to see how he was reacting to this new pain and state of their mark. But, Malfoy didn't seem to be examining his mark or aware of the predicament at all. Rather, he was crying. Or...no. He wasn't crying, but his breathing was coming so fast and hard that it was plain to Harry why he had mistaken it for sobbing.
"Sorry!" Harry said, trying to push himself up. He was on top of the blond, and it was harder than he would have thought to get up when the bus was moving and bumping so ferociously.
Potter pulled back enough so that they were now staring into each other's eyes. Potter cupped his cheek in his hand and stroked his thumb across his cheekbone. He gave a nod. "Things are terrifying sometimes. They may even seem impossible. But, that shouldn't stop you from living. Instead, let yourself be scared and then do what ever the so-called impossible, terrifying thing is anyway."
we go searching for Gryffindor."
Harry grunted, his head bowed to the floor in thought, one hand still in his hair. "So, this prophecy...it's saying...Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin were
"Are you ok?" Harry asked, stopping in front of him.
Draco took a step back from the statue and looked around the room. Lying in the shadows cast by the braziers, he could see what appeared to be a few skulls and rib cages. Smaller bones were scattered around his feet. No, he didn't like this at all.
"They're almost, I don't know, four times faster than a Firebolt. It'll get us there much faster." Harry didn't know why he was pushing for them to go on a plane exactly. He had never been on one either. He just knew that Uncle Vernon had taken a few business trips abroad and had always seemed to be in a better mood when he returned, congratulating no one in particular on such a feat of engineering. Harry suspected he did this to try to impress upon Harry how wonderful practical things like Muggle science were compared to the "silly magic tricks" wizards used.
"I don't see where either of us have a choice." McGonagall sighed and then softened her gaze to convey something of concern. "Do be careful, Potter. I fear that even when you find these tombs, they will have powerful enchantments keeping them from being accessed. This rain of fire and venom will by no means be the only thing to worry about."
Draco barely gave the pyramid a two-second glance before darting back inside the tent. He seized both their bags and was back outside before Potter had even moved. He shoved Potter's bag into his stomach. "Here," he grunted as he shouldered his own bag of supplies. He magicked on his day clothes and shoes before he noticed Potter wasn't moving. He was just standing there clutching his bag and frowning at him. "What?"
"Well done," Slytherin said, but though what he said should have been praise, he sounded almost bored. "I trust your journey was satisfactory."
"Not tonight," Harry said. "It's late, and I want to sleep."
"Because you can't trust magic
Merlin, why hadn't he suggested they take a shower together to save time and water? Malfoy wouldn't have gone for it, but it would have made it exceedingly clear what he wanted. Which...right, he couldn't have. They absolutely had to make the mark change to ensure their freedom sooner rather than later. And that meant working together, which Harry was sure also meant trust. If Malfoy suspected him of having seen him naked, those walls would go right back up and hostility would resume.
Harry nodded. This was understandable. But, that didn't fix their immediate problem. Without the ability to Apparate - which Harry wasn't sure was even possible from a moving vehicle anyhow - they were stuck. "I can't make the plane bigger without needing to modify a lot of memories."
Malfoy gave a sigh of relief even as he frowned at Harry. "Good choice, Potter." He straightened and clenched and unclenched his hand as if to work the tension from the muscle of his forearm. "We need to make a plan. Do this as fast as possible to get out of each other's hair."
"Potter, are you alright?" Malfoy asked in a tone that suggested he had asked this same question already. Harry was only then aware of what was happening. Malfoy was sitting on the edge of the bed near Harry's hip, and he was grasping both of Harry's arms. Whether to shake him awake or to hold him down from thrashing, Harry wasn't sure which.
"We checked out of the room there when we left since we weren't sure when or if we'd be back." He turned his attention to Draco. "Do you want to stay at a different hotel for any reason?"
Harry nodded, fighting to keep his expression blank for both of their sakes. Talking dirty to Malfoy while he touched himself was extremely enticing. It would give him an excuse to let his own mind wander and imagine what he would like to do to the blond if given the chance. Granted, it would also be torture. He might succeed in turning Malfoy on for the task, but he was definitely going to arouse himself and not being able to do anything about it or touch Malfoy would be excruciating.
"So...maybe another statue coming to life?"
Draco frowned, but he supposed he couldn't argue with that. Death of loved ones often had a way of making people reflect and realize things they should have done or said while that person was still alive. After all, he had had many moments like that when reflecting on his parents' deaths. "Fine. So, will you make things right with Gryffindor now?"
"We need to talk," Potter said, and Draco felt the man's breath fan over his shoulder. He was far too close.
"Why didn't it work?!" Malfoy yelled, his hands over his own ears. He was mere inches from Harry, but the volume of the banshee's wails made it seem like he was on the other side of a Quidditch stadium.
But, Harry of all people should have realized that magical marks could not be ignored, and neither would Malfoy be ignored. After burning the letter, more pain had erupted in his arm. Upon inspection, the lion's paw had moved and was now scraping the serpent's face with its claws. And when Malfoy sent another letter every day, becoming more and more persistent about their meeting, and Harry burned them too, the mark and the pain got worse.
"You came here to show me a memory?" Harry asked.
"Laugh if you want. But think about it. The words of the prophecy itself make it clear that we can choose our own fates. It is not influencing me in my feelings toward you. Don't you think that if the purpose of the prophecy was to force the prodigies to love each other that the very first pair of prodigies would have succeeded? You said this is a journey prophecy. That also means it's a choice prophecy. And maybe you think Slytherin is forcing me to tell you how I feel. No. It's me choosing life over death by starvation in the desert. It's me choosing to take a risk that your secret to tell is not of the same nature and my feelings go unrequited. Now it's your turn to make the same choice. But don't, not for a single second, think my feelings aren't legitimate."
"Did I wake you?" Harry asked. He propped himself up on his elbows as he tried to push the last foggy tendrils of sleep from his mind.
Draco stood suddenly, which was quite difficult on a picnic table bench. He stumbled as he climbed out over the bench. He swiped his bangs back out of his face. "I did no such thing."
"Whoa, wait," Draco said, and she looked back at him with a worried crease in her forehead. "Do you know something about all this?" He motioned to the mark on his own arm. He didn't exactly want to go around telling anyone and everyone about their prophecy task, but it was obvious Susan was already privy to the information somehow.
Draco's eyes went wide, and he shook his head instantly in warning. His eyes darted to Potter and back to her. "I don't know what you're-" he started to say.
He did, however, pack much more than he would have for a simple trip abroad. Soon after the war had ended, he had asked Hermione to make him a backpack with the same hidden storage capabilities that she had bestowed upon her beaded bag. Now was the perfect time to put it to use. He packed his Firebolt, his broomstick servicing kit, the invisibility cloak, the sword of Gryffindor, a small travel cauldron, vials of ingredients to make basic healing and calming potions, and a book about the basics of Ancient Runes from Hermione that he had never read but assumed he would need if he was to search for an ancient tomb. He used a spare change of robes to cradle the potion vials, making sure they wouldn't shatter during the journey. He also packed some Muggle clothes, but he would need more when they went shopping that night. Most of his were for cold weather and were, therefore, definitely not suitable for Egypt during the day. But the jumpers and jeans would come in handy for the cold desert nights. He hoped they would not have to endure many, but he knew from experience it was best to be over-prepared.
Carefully, Harry brought Malfoy back into his seat and buckled him in. His head lolled to the side at what Harry assumed was a very uncomfortable angle. He sighed and shifted both of their bodies until he successfully had Malfoy's head lying on his shoulder.
Harry ignored this for now, deciding he could only handle one problem at a time. He looked at him tiredly and sighed. "You didn't make me do anything. I would have acted on those thoughts and wants eventually if you allowed, no,
"So," Malfoy said. "How are we handling all...this?" He motioned to the room.
He had spent many hours in the Headmistress's office, pacing and talking aloud with McGonagall about what it could mean. The portraits of past Heads, of course, had their own opinions, and more than once, Harry had shouted to silence them.
much," she said. "Back then, they were making up all the rules as they went. They didn't have textbooks and years of scholarly research to learn from. I'm sure Slytherin wasn't sure his enchantments would hold after his death and he might have suspected loopholes in the concealment spells. I'm not sure. I'm just telling you what you need to know to be prepared. Hufflepuff was told that only a Slytherin prodigy would be able to find and open it. It should reveal itself to you if you both work together. But...I have to warn you. Once you set out to look for it, you either find it and free his spirit or you don't come back. Years ago, one of our group tried to accompany the pair on the journey. He made it a mile with them before he was suddenly transported fifty miles south and the prodigies were nowhere in sight. On his way back, he claimed to see them as a mirage on the horizon. And the best we can figure out is that there's an enchantment in the desert that takes the prodigies and puts them into an in-between realm of mirage as well. They only reappear fully when they've died, which means they were trapped, not able to find their way out of the desert no matter what."
"What do you think I'm trying to do?!"
"So, you've been here all this time waiting?" Harry asked. He bent to pick up a bone.
Harry turned his head just a bit to look at him. He was staring pointedly out the window, and while Harry couldn't see his face, he noticed the man's ears were pink.
"Well, what would help?" Harry asked seriously, because Malfoy looked more stressed and overwhelmed than he had ever seen him. "Can I do anything?"
"Fine," Malfoy grumbled. "If you want to take a bloody airplane..."
"I found it in the Lestranges' vault."
"Maybe we can maneuver our arms so one of us sleeps on the edge of the bed and the other on the floor?" Harry suggested. At the same time, something in the back of his mind grumbled at the prospect of this sleeping arrangement. They were both adults, and it was getting harder for Harry to ignore his feelings for the other man. If he was right about Malfoy's mutual feelings, which he became more and more sure of every time he blushed, then they could share a bed. Or...maybe that was the exact reason Malfoy didn't want to. It was clear that regardless of how either of them felt, neither of them was ready to admit it to the other.
Malfoy ignored Harry's outstretched hand and put his bag up in the compartment himself. Then, as if they had agreed on it prior, he slipped into the row of seats to take the one by the window. They had bought tickets in a two seat wide row so as to not have to deal with a third random passenger possibly overhearing them talk about magic. Though, they would have to keep their voices down anyways since the plane was packed full of Muggles.
Draco gasped, imagining that. He almost had the urge to bend over himself to help the image have a firmer, more vivid grip. Part of him wanted Potter to stop, because an urge to speak was clawing at his own lips and he was both fearful and excited about what he might say.
"No, as I said, we have permission to be here. We work with the Ministry. We're more like police than anything, though we do have the appearance of, I suppose, what Muggles would think is a gang. But we control crime, not make it."
"Ok," he said. "Right." He turned to Potter. They needed to reason this out before they triggered any sort of attack from the statue. And, he figured they needed to be on the same page. In the middle of a battle wouldn't be the best time to communicate. "So, we've got to stab the dagger into the hole in its chest. But, it's going to attack us when we try. No spells will work on it. What did the snake mean by 'attention undivided' though? From what I've read, this looks like it's the Egyptian god Thoth. He was a god of writing, wisdom, learning, and stuff like that, so that makes sense for Slytherin. But why a physical fight then? Why not a riddle or something?"
Potter had made it clear that he would never want to see Draco naked. This should have made Draco feel relieved to know nothing could ever happen between him and the other man. But instead, he had become upset, saddened by this news. Had he wanted Potter to want to see him? Not that it mattered. He didn't need or want a relationship, an attachment. And Potter clearly didn't either. Again, he reminded himself, Potter was straight. Right? The way he had caught him around the waist in the street...no, that was just reflexes, of course.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "I'm not going to argue with you on that, you know."
Harry wanted to say something as Malfoy rummaged in his bag and pulled out a pair of pajamas. But, what would he say? If he apologized like he wanted to, it could lead them on a path of even more awkwardness and annoyance. That wouldn't help change the mark so Susan would free them. So, he kept quiet even though inside he was raging at himself for having upset Malfoy.
Draco nodded, and he knew that somehow they were completely in sync about what had to happen next. He took another few steps back, drawing out more distance between him and the statue as Potter moved to stand in its path. When the statue was a mere foot from Potter and its eyes were still wholly focused on Draco, the blond tossed the dagger up into the air. It arched downward, Potter caught it, and before the statue could shift its attention to the new wielder, he had rammed it into the slot in its chest.
"I can't believe you did that," Potter whispered.
Harry gave another tug on the man's arm when he didn't respond to the first one.
"No, but I don't see how that would make a difference."
"You can open your eyes," came Malfoy's cool voice.
Malfoy focused on a spot on the floor some feet from them as he said, "You could...talk to me."
Draco stopped walking only once he had reached the bar counter inside the Leaky Cauldron. He ordered a shot of fire whiskey from the barman and downed it a few seconds later just as Potter stopped behind him.
Draco slumped back against him and barely refrained from whining when Potter withdrew his hand from his cock. A quick glance back down revealed that Potter's knuckles had been painted in a strip of his cum. Before Draco could think to offer to perform a Scouring Charm, the hand had disappeared out of sight. Then he heard what was unmistakably Potter licking his fingers clean.
"And again, we need to know about this thing of us not being the first ones to attempt this prophecy," Potter said, and Draco was happy to see the raven-haired man looking as irritated as he felt.
"So," Harry said and cleared his throat, trying to wipe any trace of amusement from his face. He didn't want a fight. Not here, and not at this late hour. Maybe tomorrow once he had slept. "Why was your mother's memory in the Lestrange vault and not the Malfoy vault?"
Ten minutes later, Malfoy walked out of the bathroom in pajamas, his hair still a bit damp. Harry couldn't help but think this freshly-showered and tousled look made the blond look even sexier than usual. As it was, Harry had barely restrained himself from looking over Malfoy's entire body while in the shower with him. But he had known it would have been inappropriate and much unwelcome in that moment.
Then everything went dark as if someone had snuffed out multiple lamps. Looking around and finally up, Draco saw a huge shape looming above their tent. He sprung up from the bed and ran outside, Potter at his heels.
Our job is to control magical crime in Cairo because the Egyptian Ministry of Magic doesn't have the best auror program. And frankly, our group has been here much longer than any Ministry of Magic has."
Malfoy rubbed his freshly healed forearm as he looked around the still chamber. "Yeah, well, thanks."
"We used to. Do you honestly think this is still hate? I think we've been pretty civil, almost friends, during this whole prophecy thing."
Harry opened his eyes to find himself staring at the plastic blue-patterned shower curtain. The chain leading from his cuff to Malfoy's disappeared around the edge of the curtain, keeping it open a few inches. He sat on the closed lid of the toilet just as the water was turned on in the shower.
Harry woke before Malfoy the next morning, which was lucky because if he hadn't, he would have never seen the beautiful sight before him.
"It does look like you two have made significant progress," Susan said as she peered at the mark on Potter's forearm.
Harry winced but neither moved nor said anything. Malfoy's eyes were shut, and he was shaking. Struck by a sudden idea, call it an urge or something else, Harry laid his free hand over the blond's that was clasped so tightly onto him. "Breathe, Draco," he whispered.
But, as much as Harry was focused on Malfoy, his attention was suddenly pulled to the walls of the chamber. Whereas the previous two chambers had had smooth and blank obsidian stone walls, this one was etched and painted from floor to ceiling with Egyptian-style images. All of them depicted pairs of males in various states of undress and sexual positions. Clearly, Slytherin had wanted his prodigy to have no excuse or lack of inspiration for this task.
"The wind...it was a voice." But from the quizzical look Potter shot him, Draco knew he wasn't feigning the ignorance. Which meant...well, of course it was a sign from Slytherin. But that also must have meant it had been spoken in Parseltongue. He scooted a bit closer to the fire so he could see Potter's face. "It was Slytherin, I'm sure of it."
"A sabbatical, Potter?" McGonagall said in a clipped manner. The Headmistress stood behind her desk, one hand laid on the edge of it as if supporting herself to keep standing as she took in this news. "You have not worked here long enough for a sabbatical. And in the middle of the term. I cannot allow you to...finding a replacement on such short notice, I-"
Yes, as much as Harry wanted to witness and/or listen to Malfoy's self pleasure, he knew it wouldn't speed things along. Malfoy would undoubtedly be uncomfortable with the thought of Harry watching or even listening. Besides, just as Harry hadn't wanted to see Malfoy naked in the shower without his permission, he definitely didn't want this without Malfoy's consent either. It would be much better and more worth the wait if he let things pan out and see if the blond ever reached a place where he wanted to act on his feelings for Harry.
Hurriedly, Harry stood and pulled up his pants, his attention focused solely on the doorway in case anything came running down the stairs at them. Malfoy was soon at his shoulder, a bit pink-faced and still out of breath as he fastened his trousers.
"Malfoy! Catch!"
"Apparently."
Harry softened a bit. "I know. And that's what you need to decide. I want you to make a decision you feel good about. I'm just worried you're making rash decisions based on two men who died thousands of years ago."
Harry felt a smile tug at the corner of his mouth, but he quickly hid it by looking around to the beds as if giving more thought to the problem. If Malfoy saw him grinning again at his discomfort, he was sure the man would just elect to chop off his arm rather than remain in the cuffs one second longer.
It was infuriating how unconvinced Potter looked at that moment. Because he needed the man to believe it so he, in turn, could convince himself. Draco didn't honestly think that was how the prophecy worked, but it had to be influencing them somehow, right?
Potter looked like he was about to argue but thought better of it. "Fine," he said after a moment. "But I want to talk about it when we get back to Cairo.
The man stood and withdrew a square of parchment from his pocket. He unfolded it, shifted the pensieve back a few inches, and laid out the parchment on the desk.
to fulfill this prophecy now that we've heard it either. Granted, our choices are fulfill it or die, but death is still a choice."
A stray thought crossed Harry's mind as his body finally gave way to sleep. Malfoy had blushed a lot that day, turning from pale white to a dusty or even bright pink when Harry had been close to him on two occasions. Did Malfoy have real feelings for him?
A vague answer had come a few nights ago via a large eagle owl that had rapped on his windowpane at two in the morning until he awoke and let it in. Bleary-eyed, he had untied the letter from its leg. It had gone out the window before he could even unroll the scroll of parchment. It had read:
"This isn't going to work," he grumbled and got to his feet. He seized the pillows from the floor and tossed them onto the opposite side of the bed. "I know you're not happy about it, but move over."
"Don't you want to talk about what just happened?" Potter asked with a raised eyebrow.
"Yeah, that's us just working together so we don't die," Draco argued. "Or have you forgotten that line of the prophecy?"
Draco looked to where Potter was pointing at the statue in the center of the room. For a moment, he wasn't sure what he was looking at either. There was something shimmery floating in front of the statue. Warily, and keeping his eyes open for any signs of sudden movements in the shadows, he walked toward the statue.
"Hmm, ok." She sat back down and looked between them. "The animals look wary, untrusting of each other. I can't let you two attempt to find the tomb until I know you trust each other more."
Malfoy was nibbling on a mushroom from his own kebab. "Honestly, me too." He sighed as they walked down the street, still headed deeper into the heart of Cairo.
Draco nearly upended the entire vial in his shock. "A
Draco turned to stare at Potter, who hadn't said a single word yet. He was thoroughly annoyed to see the man laughing behind his hand. "Do you think this is funny, Potter?"
Banshees were malevolent spirits regarded as omens of death in the wizarding world. Their main characteristic was also a high-pitched scream that never ended until the hearer met an untimely end.
"I think I liked it better when we were enemies," Draco finally said after several long minutes had passed. He felt Potter tense at his words.
As Harry read, he occasionally cast a glance in Malfoy's direction over the top of his book. For a while, Malfoy just sat there staring at the floor. Then he shifted to examining all the pictures on the walls. Maybe he was trying to arouse himself with the ancient pornography. Eventually though, after maybe an hour, Malfoy got up to pace again, this time walking circles around the dais.
Potter nodded and dropped his own bag beside Draco's. "I'll stay out of the way." Something in his expression softened like it had back in the tent when he was confessing his feelings for Draco. "Be careful."
Malfoy stood from the bed. "I think I want breakfast," he said quickly and ducked out of the tent.
"This is insane," Malfoy hissed, glancing around the plane like something was going to jump out and bite him.
"She stored it how long ago?" Harry asked, obviously stalling. For what, he didn't know. But he was tired and didn't want to hear about prophecies and marks on his arm.
Harry swallowed thickly and forced himself to pull the curtain back shut, effectively making Malfoy disappear from sight. His pants were suddenly tight with a growing erection, which made him silently curse himself. That wasn't how he had wanted to see Malfoy naked, not when the man didn't know and clearly didn't want it either. He wanted it to be consensual, and he wanted to be naked with him.
After the battle, he had disappeared. He had lost his parents, his godparents, an admired teacher and mentor, and several close friends all in one night. He felt like he could not bear any more hurt, and he had sworn from that moment on to never allow anyone to become close to him again. Having attachments was just a set up for heartbreak.
Why was Malfoy suddenly a mess around him? Hell, why had he Harry suddenly started acting differently around Malfoy?
Once they had boarded the plane and it was turning onto the runway for takeoff, Harry handed Malfoy the small vial of Sleeping Draught he had brewed in a janitorial closet at the airport. "Remember, just take a little for now."
The single door at the top of the stairs was solid silver. Another silver serpent head was mounted on the door, immobile but presumably awaiting to be spoken to. The shuffling and banging from the other side of the door was louder now, and Harry thought it sounded oddly like the creature within was trying to move heavy furniture.
Irritatingly, Potter raised an eyebrow and smirked. "Why? I rather like it this way."
Two weeks ago, a strange mark had appeared on Harry's right inner forearm. Since one mark on his body had already dictated the first almost eighteen years of his life, he was sure another one showing up randomly was not a good sign. And, he was definitely sure he hadn't been drunk and gotten a tattoo without remembering. Tattoos did not suddenly make themselves known in the middle of a teaching demonstration and shoot bright pain through the inner elbow as if shot by a centaur's arrow.
Harry gave a choked laugh. How was that possible that two of the most famous wizards in history had had a secret love affair? For, of course, it must have been secret. If it had been known or even suspected, it surely would have been written about. And Hermione had never mentioned a Gryffindor-Slytherin love affair cropping up in
Potter gave a hesitant nod. "Susan said to get lost and have the tomb find us. And you've said before this prophecy is categorized as a quest or journey or whatever according to the text. I think walking and waiting is our only choice."

Malfoy’s eyes search his face for a moment, and then get stopped in their search somewhere around Harry’s mouth. Talk about mixed signals. “Yeah…” Malfoy says vaguely, “What? Yes. Fine. Take your hands off of me, Potter.”

The top half of Harry’s lightning scar comes into view.
“If you peeked at my paper half as much as I peek at yours, you’d know.” Harry passes the butter back. “Have you gotten enough practice yet?”
“I’m not—” Draco splutters. “You’re throwing me off. This is just how it is.”
Which he can only do if he can stop thinking about Malfoy’s pretty face long enough to save the guy.
“What a coward, here’s your damn tissue, Malfoy.”
“It’s

“I’m grabbing Hermione,” Ron announces, already standing up.
Harry stares.
But Pansy’s gone through already. She seems to like doing that.
Or maybe Harry’s just trying to justify his crush to himself.
Harry’s expression twists. He shoves his way out of the office door. “Oh, fuck you, Malfoy.”
“What is
“A tissue? It’ll just disappear in the shower.”
Harry toys with the blanket and clears his throat a couple times but doesn’t say anything. At long last, he turns on the light, and Pansy puts her Lumos out, setting her wand down and fixing her hair.

never wanted to be a better person?”
“Do you consider yourself to have a strong moral compass?”
“Well. You’re not a Death Eater now, and that counts for a lot,” Harry says, and he means it. The pain in Malfoy’s eyes feels like his own chest is being ripped open; he knew Malfoy was sorry, but he didn’t know he was
“What?” Malfoy looks to Harry, and then to Pansy, who isn’t protesting Harry’s words—probably a novel experience for Malfoy. His eyes have this burning determination in them that Harry finds enchanting at absolutely the wrong time. “No, we leave the letter. Potter… what, are you trying to say you
, you are insulting me.” He groans. He’s probably going to get a headache. They’re fucking time over
“How far, how long,” Hermione demands again. She looks ready to shove the tip of her wand against the underside of Pansy’s chin and demand answers; Harry suspects she isn’t any more happy about being woken up in the middle of the night than he is.
“A transcript… for the ‘Boyfriend Check’...” Harry repeats. “Hmm… yeah, okay. Yeah, sure.”
“A scented candle shop.”
“Yes Professor Malfoy. Whatever you say, Professor Malfoy.” Harry’s tipped his chair backwards, balancing on its two back legs. None of Draco’s kids are like this, and Harry knows it—he teases Draco all the time about how he terrifies the children half to death.
“Um,” says Harry.
He doesn’t look. Which means he shoots several looks—it’s not like Harry’s trying to hide anything, or like there’s any reason why Harry would want to hide anything (Salazar save Draco)—but he pulls his eyes away quickly enough that he doesn’t get caught and he can absolutely call it self-control.
Pansy’s expression goes soft for a moment, an expression Harry gets from Hermione sometimes, although he’s never quite sure what about. “No,” she says. She laughs a little, not entirely kindly. “I promise, he has

They have this conversation over and over. They go in circles, but they always end up here.
“I’m Quidditch Captain this year.”
“Draco, please.” Harry’s eyes flicker with something Draco’s never seen before when he’s talking about any of his boyfriends: Flustered. Urgent. In… love. “How do you feel about Harry Potter?”
Harry doesn’t look like he can talk either, so they stand there. And they stand there.
“I’m friends with Hermione,” Harry returns, which earns him a blank look. “She always reminds us,” he explains.
Draco stares down at his textbook, not reading a single word, not looking up. Salazar, fuck, this is going to be catastrophic.
Draco thinks for a moment she’s talking about sex, and he’s about to say, again,

“I think…” he starts quietly, “I think—listen, you can’t laugh at me, okay?”

Draco thinks.
He’s honestly confused. He
He’s got a plate for each of them.
Finally, Malfoy sits up just a little and pushes up his sleeve. “Still there,” he says dully, shoving his arm Harry’s way. The Dark Mark is indeed still there, gleaming darkly under the moon, looking admittedly very sinister and dislikable.
And then he catches sight of her expression. She’s already pale-ish in the blue-white light of the Lumos charm she’s got in one hand—the other is still digging its nails into his bicep—but she seems even paler than the Lumos charm warrants. She looks wild-eyed and sleepless.

“Pass the butter,” Harry says.
He abandons the textbook. When has he ever managed to read anything when Harry Potter was existing in the same space? Never. He pushes the textbook aside, and now Draco’s facing Harry straight on, Harry sitting on the floor and Draco lying on his stomach on his bed. Harry’s not the least bit sweaty, and his expression is breathtakingly earnest and open.
He’s turned towards Draco now, in nothing but his boxers, walking over to look at Draco’s textbook again. Draco looks back down at his textbook, too, ignoring Harry’s thighs and the shape between his legs. “Always studying.”
She’d said.
“He’s your new boyfriend,” Draco says defensively. “I have to make sure… I have to make sure he’s alright.”
On the mouth!
“That’s the Boyfriend Check,” Harry says. “How do you feel about—”
How fucking
Harry shoves him, feeling himself go red. He puts his arm around Malfoy’s waist and steers them back on course towards the Slytherin Common Room. “A

tired after you put me through all that crap, you wanker.”
“Dated his girl the one time,” Michael says, and then considers. “Actually, also dated his ex-girlfriend. We traded spots. But it doesn’t seem like he holds it against me, if you know what I mean.”
. He’s not even sure that he’s going to say it until he says it: “You have a soulmark.”
Harry feels rather stupid.
“You’re terrible at explaining,” Malfoy says eventually, “But despite this, I’m bright enough to gather what you mean. I mean, you’re really shit.” He turns to Pansy, pointing to Harry. “What possessed you to bring this idiot?”
Harry reaches out to him with the hand that isn’t holding the broom, first to Malfoy’s hand, and then to Malfoy’s shoulder because that feels less awkward, and gives him a gentle squeeze. “No,” he says firmly, as gently as he can muster. Malfoy’s still not looking at him, so he steps closer, resting the Firebolt against the fireplace and putting his other hand on Malfoy’s other shoulder, seeking out Malfoy’s eyes. “Look, it doesn’t matter, alright? It’s fine; I’m fine with a little walking. We are not going to fly.”
That, more than anything, breaks Harry out of it. “Okay, okay, whatever,” he grumbles, and grabs Malfoy again, this time by the hand, receiving a noise of surprise from Malfoy that has him looking quickly up to make sure Malfoy hasn’t, like, died standing up or anything. This seems to make Pansy laugh harder. Harry casts a pointed Silencing Charm. “Let’s go, let’s move.”
The first line of defense.
“No,” Pansy says, and then to drive the point home, repeats, “Ew,” and sends the time-turner spinning.
“I know the day.” Pansy pulls out the time-turner by the chain, watching it spin slowly in the air, the metal gleaming. Her brow is creased, and the corners of her mouth pull down. “He never let me forget it. We probably need to go earlier in the day, before it happens—he’ll be in the Manor. August third.”
As far as Harry Potter knows, he’s special because he’s the only person in history to not die after getting hit by the killing curse. Twice. Draco got

“Jacob Jacobs.” Straight brown hair that falls into his brown eyes, tan skin and freckles, looks completely out of place in this coffee shop, his knees spread wide and his large hands fiddling with the sugar. He doesn’t seem to be drinking his tea.

He hates the way Harry says it as if it’s normal. Just something you live through.
he had it figured out, but now Malfoy has, predictably, opened his mouth and said some shitty things to Harry, and it’s like—what? Truly, what is going on? It’s like the kiss didn’t even happen, except Harry’s mouth is still tingling, so there’s that.

“Which side do you think? Didn’t you know all the Death Eaters your age, Malfoy?”
“It’s like you practiced that speech or something.” Malfoy pulls his sleeve down and takes his arm back abruptly and sits back. Perhaps Malfoy caught Harry’s expression when he saw the Dark Mark before he could get it under control. “Whatever. You wouldn’t understand, Potter.”
“Have you ever harmed Harry Potter emotionally in the past?”
“Someday,” Harry amends quickly. “I mean, definitely not now. Obviously.”
“So we have no way of knowing without taking a risk.”
Harry’s raising his eyebrows at Draco, mouth tipped up in bemusement.
“Draco, please—” Pansy lays a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, which Malfoy shrugs off, albeit not violently. “He’s here to—”

“Or something,” Pansy says, still being cryptic.
Harry turns. His expression is so hurt, so pained, it stamps any last pieces of Draco’s heart to dust. “Didn’t want me, yeah—
“We can’t just let the fire go out. There
“Dunno. Not that I remember.” Michael Corner is grinning now. “Are you practicing to be an Auror? I hate to break it to you, but Muggle-Wizard university is not where you want to be, mate.”
“Some things are awkward,” he says through the door, “it’s a hard fact of life, Potter. But it’s a good thing. An important thing.”
Draco fights to keep his expression in control. He wants to smile at Harry. He
Draco aches and he aches and he aches.

one,” Harry says.
Hermione hands the Time-Turner back. “Well.” She seems a bit at a loss. “Thank you. And, I guess, you’re welcome. Really there’s no need to thank us. But you’re welcome. And thank you.”
Draco sucks in a breath to speak, but nothing comes out.
Harry Potter’s soulmark is on his forehead.
It’s not good.
Draco thinks.
“No shit,” Harry says, but without any bite. He scuffs the grass beneath their feet and thinks about walking that whole way. They approach the edge of the water together and peer over at the dark castle, just a few lights flickering in a few windows. “Rowing would be hell, though.”
Unspeakably, horrifically, impossibly selfish.
“Oh, please,” Harry waves a theatrical hand, overly-gracious. “Be my guest.”
sorry. Harry wants to put his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder and absorb his pain. “You went back in time because you wanted to do right.”
Harry laughs, a short, gasping sound. “Yeah, thanks, Malfoy.”
He follows Harry into the bathroom as Harry drops his boxers.
“Possibly because I’ve been working while you have been wasting your time attempting to start a conversation with me.” Draco dips his pen in ink again, willing himself not to look up. It’s exceedingly hard when he knows if he does, Harry’s eyes will be so,
He’s pretending like he doesn’t hurt, and Merlin, that makes it even worse—he smiles and shrugs it off and teases Draco, and sometimes he’s really good at it, throwing Draco off track, so much so that it’s not until Draco’s alone in his bed that he realizes they never actually finished their soulmates conversation. For two people who hate talking about soulmates, they talk about soulmates kind of a lot. It’s a subject they circle back to over and over and over, as if drawn in by some magnetic force.
Harry doesn’t miss the way Malfoy flinches, his cheeks paling and his eyes darting towards Harry, so he takes a step back to give them space and almost trips over a pile of boxes, sending papers tumbling.
Because Draco does. Merlin’s fucking tits, Draco does.
“I will worr—” Harry starts, but Pansy isn’t listening; she’s moved on to Malfoy.
Now they just pull their clothes off around each other all the time.
Harry thinks he makes some sort of sound as Hermione opens the trunk.
“Anyway, he turned back time, and he’s in the past now, so however that happened, it happened,” Pansy’s saying, as Harry pulls on a shirt and buttons it up. “And I believe you and Granger have experience with time travel.”
Carefully putting the pinch of Floo powder back and offering Harry the jar so that Harry can do the same, Malfoy stares into the jar with an unhappy, sort of resigned expression. “We’ll just… fly back.”
Harry’s throat bobs, his chair screeches, his face gets closer. Unfathomably close. “Draco.” He says it again. “I love you.”
a question. Just with the shouting it kind of sounds like a statement, which makes Harry feel foolish when Malfoy turns to him and just raises his eyebrows.

Michael Corner, dark-haired, bright-eyed, fit as a fiddle—puts his cup of tea down. “You already know my name,” he says. He points to them each in turn: “Draco Malfoy. Michael Corner. We went to Hogwarts together.”
, and it’s really the most efficient way to go about things anyway.
Harry’s stomach drops. “Oh,” he says, feeling stupid and shitty, “Right, yeah. Right. Yeah.”
That’s—” Harry frowns, and Draco feels a spike of something black and unfriendly towards Butcher. “That’s rude. He’s just—he’s nice when you get to know him.”
The cold feeling in Draco’s gut comes back full force, clawing icily up his spine, closing fingers around Draco’s heart.
He’s as sweaty as he looks, and that should be really gross, but it really isn’t.
It’s one of Draco’s favorite parts of the day. The

Everett Butcher: Zero strikes.
Harry takes off after her. The water on his skin makes the air feel very cold when he moves, and his shoes squelch a little when he sets his feet down.
There’s no other word for Harry’s expression.
Harry laughs. “Prat,” he says fondly, settling on Draco’s bed. “What are you studying for?”
they’re getting somewhere. “I have questions.”
“Ooh—yes.” Jacobs turns his neck to the side and taps it, right where his neck meets his shoulder. “Did you see it this morning?”
“He told me,” Harry agrees, squeezing Malfoy’s waist a little.
Draco wonders if Harry can see his nipples—probably yes—and his Dark Mark—probably yes. He’s been around Harry naked before, but he’s never been in a basically shirtless state without the proper emotional preparation. Emotional preparation mostly consists of the internal speech:
“Mmm.” Draco can’t make his throat do anything else.
“You’re his best friend!” objects another kid. Apparently, Draco’s intimidation does not apply where Harry Potter is being discussed. “Wouldn’t you know?”
And when Ron emerges, Pansy looks ready to blow her top.
bad, like water pressure getting higher and higher behind a dam. Draco’s drowning in it.
Harry. Is. Hurting.
“I’m not going to,” Harry swears, and Draco can see in Harry’s eyes that Harry means it. And he knows, he hopes, he prays that that will change. He’ll wait. However long it takes, he’ll wait.
"You didn't eat anything?"
Potter nodded and gave her a hug while Draco muttered a quiet thanks. Susan gave a final nod and slipped through the solid side of the Sphinx into the den Draco knew was beyond.
Draco forgot just how quickly a dose that large would act, and he lunged forward to take the mug from the man's hand before he dropped it. Potter's eyes were rolling back, but before he was dragged into a deep sleep, Draco could have sworn he saw a look of utter betrayal flash across the man's features.
"I say I quite agree!" piped up Phineas Nigellus Black from his portrait somewhere behind Harry. "Their lives have been analyzed and dissected by some of the greatest historians of the age. No, no, there was no relationship between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I say."
No he was not.
It makes his heart ache to think that Malfoy doesn’t feel the same way about himself.
He’s a little bit relieved and more than a little bit surprised that Malfoy kisses him back, no less eagerly than last time.

They make their ways quietly through long, grand hallways and large, grand rooms, and steep, grand staircases.
“No,” Harry says, “Let’s do it. Lead the way.”
“It’s too hot; why would we have a fire going?”
“Romantic,” Harry jokes, hoping to catch a reaction from Malfoy.
“Someone got carried away,” Pansy snickers, leaning in through the doorway and gesturing to them. “Come on, come on, it’s still three-thirty, and we’ve got to get back to Hogwarts before anyone notices we’re missing. Granger and Weasley can only cover for so long.”
Harry backtracks immediately. “I mean, he already went.”
“Have you ever harmed Harry Potter physically in the past?”
It’s just that…
Draco does a really good job of not thinking too hard about Harry having sex. He thinks:
“I’ll show you bite,” Draco mutters. He shoots off a quick Cleaning Charm pointedly and gives his lesson plan one last glance before he folds it neatly into the pocket of his robes. He expects Harry to shoot something back in return, but Harry’s looking at him with flushed cheeks, uncharacteristically unresponsive.
He realizes this the moment he starts teaching—Harry was right. Dammit. Preparation does not account for what’s actually going to happen in class, which was unforeseen and unprepared for.

despite Draco’s constant jabs about it, so that he can scoot over and look at Draco’s work whenever he feels like it.
Pansy gapes for about two minutes, at which point she seems moderately acclimated to it. “How long, do you think,” she demands, an edge to her voice.
Harry laughs more. He hasn’t stepped back from Draco. “Yeah, I was going to.”

Harry makes a noncommittal noise.
He looks away from Harry again and does not elaborate.
He’s made a habit of not looking over the years, both Hogwarts Eighth Year and now college.

Pansy’s looking at him with her eyebrows halfway up her forehead and her mouth in this perfect
“Ah…” Draco doesn’t know what else to say. His brain has stopped working. His stomach is a wild mass of butterflies. “That’s… good.”
If there’s one thing Harry thought he’d never see, it’s Pansy Parkinson standing over him, shaking him awake at three AM.
Yes, that’s it, it’s all Malfoy’s fault.
“No you’re not,” Draco says. Before he thinks.
Then they got back to their usual schedule of Malfoy making fun of Harry and Pansy not
“I think he will listen to you,” she says while his back is turned, over the clomping of her feet and the sound of clothes coming off and on. “Oh Saviour of the Wizarding World, Chosen One, Golden Boy, oh Saint Potter of the bisexuals—”
“You’re welcome,” Draco says, careful not to let his heart out into his voice. “I’m the best.”
“Eh.” Harry brings his feet down, grinning back unabashedly. “You’re all bark no bite, Malfoy.”
“I am, yeah.” Harry looks over at Draco, gaze questioning. “Have you heard of any other magical person born without a soulmark?”
, exactly. He doesn’t think—and maybe he’s completely wrong here—that Malfoy looks fondly on the day he got the Dark Mark at all; he’s always wearing long sleeves, even in the hot, hot midday sun, sweat glistening on his skin.

you let me take those wands. And you know what I think? I think you’re brave.”
It’s even easier because all of his answers were so infuriating.
Harry drops Malfoy’s gaze and follows Malfoy up the stairs when Malfoy finally goes. “Who’s fault is that, you ungrateful idiot? Didn’t you even check the time frame for time travel?”
, Draco thinks fiercely.
That also qualifies as an answer. Or, rather, the look he’s giving Draco—one of horror—is an answer.
“Azkaban,” Ron says, which sums up Harry’s argument quite well.
quietly and pulls him in, closing the door behind them and throwing up Silencing Charms. It’s a much smaller room than Harry has seen here before, one with the sort of disorder he wouldn’t expect to find in the Malfoy Manor. There are lots of papers, photographs sitting on top of boxes, rolled up tapestries, portraits. There aren’t any tables or chairs, and there are only a few sconces, which aren’t lit.
He doesn’t like Malfoy. Malfoy is an arse…. But
wants to smile at Harry. “Behave yourself.
Dark Magic? While the Second War with Voldemort was happening all around me?”
Malfoy nods. “I don’t think we’re actually ready to fly anyway,” he says. “And…” he doesn’t seem to have anything else to say. They’re both just stalling.
“You’ve made so much progress.”
That should’ve kind of been a hint, probably.
They land hard, tumbling to the ground—in opposite directions, thank god—and Pansy immediately stands up, dusting off the grass that clings to her and pulling up the time-turner again. Harry stashes the Firebolt in a bush and joins her, grabbing her hand tight.
“And if you can’t do this… “ Here she gives Malfoy a very significant look. “There is no hope for you.
, Harry thinks, and brings his hands to Malfoy’s hair.
to that sentence.
“We’re Romantic soulmates,” Harry says, no small amount of pleasure in his words. “You were right—I’m not special. We’re a dime a dozen.”
“What does me behind bisexual have to do with anything?” Harry interrupts, panicking.
It gives him a funny feeling in his stomach, being in Malfoy’s room.
“Do you consider yourself to have a strong moral compass?”
And he has waited and waited and waited.
“Don’t come any closer, you’re all sweaty,” Draco orders, putting out a hand to stop Harry from taking any more steps closer—he won’t be able to
“Have you ever looked in a mirror?” he elects to say instead, aiming for… well he’s not sure what he’s aiming for. He sounds sort of resigned, even to himself. “I still think you’re an arse.”
have a soulmark.
Harry swallows. If you’d told him three hours ago he’d be consoling Malfoy over being a Death Eater, he’d have sent you to St. Mungos, but now he wants nothing more than for Malfoy to stop feeling so damn miserable about himself. What’s there to hate?

, but he shoves that voice down.
“I can’t believe I fucked him,” Harry’s mutter comes, just over the sound of the water. “Christ.”
he squawks, drawing his blanket up sharply over his bare chest. It’s the beginning of the year, and the summer heat seems determined on staying the night, especially up in Gryffindor Tower. Heat rises, and all that. “What are you—why are you—” He doesn’t even know what question to ask. How did she get up here? Why is she hovering over his bed like the grim reaper, shaking him awake five minutes after he’d
And Malfoy kisses him…
“And then you started going to Hogwarts,” Draco says.
“His two strikes,” Draco hurries to say, before Harry can insist on talking about it. “For
“Hey Malfoy?” Harry says, as he disobeys Malfoy and slides his hand down, grabbing Malfoy’s elbow tightly and his Firebolt in the other, “Why’d you kiss me?”
Malfoy considers the entrance for a moment, frowning, shoving his hand in his pocket where Harry knows he has the Time-Turner. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“I’m not that stupid, Potter, no, of course not.” Pansy and Harry let out a heavy breath at the same time, and Malfoy turns on Pansy. “Oh, for Salazar’s sake, you didn’t think I was that stupid, too? Not you.”
“Bit of an asshole, but he’s not wrong,” Draco says lightly.
” They’re lucky it’s late at night, and most of the teachers are probably asleep. Draco is a loud crier.
But Malfoy doesn’t continue.
“Not… in a dangerous way.”

Not Dissonant.
The answer is always no. No, of fucking course they don’t deserve Harry Potter.
You can never be saintly enough, is that right?” Malfoy looks off across the Great Lake, his voice quieting again. “I don’t need to be the best person in the whole fucking world like you. I just want to be good.”
Harry grits his teeth. “We are not
Except for now.
Pansy waves her on, not really seeming to pay attention to the trunk at all. “So it’s possible we could pull him out with no consequences?”
“We can’t Apparate,” Malfoy says, as if he expects Harry to suggest it.
date Harry Potter.
It’s not that he’s scared for Malfoy. Malfoy’s an arse and a bully.
But up they were, at eleven at night, both of them done with their work.
Draco still doesn’t look up from his paper, but he knows from the creak of Harry’s chair and the ceasing of the tapping that Harry has abandoned his paper all together and is leaning forward to peer at Draco. Their desks are on opposite sides of the room, facing each other, but Harry always sits on the
“Get your feet off of my desk.” Draco raises an eyebrow and waits. “Detention, Potter.”
So Draco hands it over—success! Distraction successful!—and beats a hasty retreat. “I’m going to shower,” he says.
“Not for another month at least,” Harry jokes, gesturing for Malfoy to get on.
“Mister Malfoy and his scary, scary interrogation? I could never.”
Now Michael Corner looks less proud, more confused. “What kind of ‘best mate talk’ is this? I don’t think so, Malfoy. I dunno. Didn’t like me too much when I was dating the Weasley girl back in Hogwarts.”
“Thanks, you know, for offering.” Malfoy’s face scrunches like
“To protect me from a big, bad boyfriend?”
Deserve was never on the table.
” Draco’s shouting now, too, his voice shrill, fighting to be heard over what Harry’s saying.
Harry should not find this feat of Malfoy’s as attractive as he does.
a soulmate, and he wants Draco to go find him and fall in love and get married and grow old. Because he wants Draco to be happy, he says, and Draco can tell he means it. There’s no possible way in the entire world that you can be more firmly friendzoned. “They’ve asked a lot?”
The door opens and closes, and then, even though the door to the shower is steamed up too much for Draco to see, Draco knows Harry’s standing in the bathroom—especially when all the warm steam rushes out of the bathroom, clearing the air by at least 50%.
Harry takes the chance and turns to find Hermione with her wand already out and her hair tied up and Pansy—thankfully—dressed in the normal shirt, tie, and robes, as if it’s the middle of the school day. Only Ron’s still in his pajamas; he sheepishly disappears behind his curtains, and there are some more shoes-shuffling noises.
“What?” Pansy’s still grinning and chuckling like she’s just won the lottery. “You’ve wanted to ride Harry Potter’s broomstick for ages—”
“Go,” Malfoy says, making a shooing gesture at Pansy. There’s no edge to his voice. “Go, go.”
Malfoy will just open his mouth and say something shitty. He’s been saying shitty things to Harry all year, so it’s to be expected—even if maybe a little bit of Harry hoped they’d let this rivalry go after he spoke at Malfoy’s trial and everything—so Harry can count on that.
Harry frowned but didn't decide to the pursue the matter. Their flight to Paris was short, and hopefully by then, Malfoy would have relaxed enough to realize the plane wasn't that bad. He just needed time.
"If," Draco said softly. "If you fuck me." He wouldn't have Potter assuming they were going to have sex right there in the middle of a tomb.
Draco sighed and picked up his messenger bag and his own hawawshi from the take-away bag they had gotten from the restaurant next door to the hotel. He sat across from Potter on the floor and took out the world map and the vial of blood. He handed both to Potter before unwrapping the foil on his food. He began eating the spicy dish. He probably should have gotten his without the chilis.
Reveal your secrets. What a terribly annoying Slytherin thing to say, Harry thought.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "What exactly?"
it. But, it had been nice not waking up alone. And that was also odd, because he had slept alone ever since he was a child, so he was used to it and had no reason to not like waking up alone.
"But you admitted to seeing my point about how letting people in might be good."
Harry was already shaking his head by the time Malfoy finished speaking. "No. There is no way we're doing this. It's mental."
Harry was sure he knew what she was thinking. She had successfully survived all seven Weasleys and seen them out of Hogwarts only to now face the possibility of inviting one of them back. She and Filch would have their work cut out for them with a Weasley on staff.
It was Draco's turn to frown. "While being unconscious on the plane sounds great, are you sure I'll wake up in time?" He couldn't imagine the embarrassment he would feel if he woke up off the plane and discovered Potter had had to carry him off or something else equally humiliating.
The statue went rigid and moved no more.
Harry made a face at this. He had grown to distrust Floo powder when Umbridge had used it to try to catch Sirius in the Gryffindor common room fireplace and even more so when the Ministry was taken over. In general, he just hated the thought of being tracked at all. He didn't need the people at the Ministry's Floo Network to raise questions about him going to Egypt suddenly. Besides, Floo powder wasn't the most precise. He had gotten lost in Knockturn Alley when he was twelve. What would happen if he and Malfoy got separated cities or countries apart while they couldn't Apparate? He explained this to Malfoy.
Draco huffed out a breath. "Ok, so, that's all fine. But what the hell is going on?"
"I didn't want to give you time to come up with some excuse to weasel your way out of it," Malfoy said. He stood across from Harry, the desk between them. Though there was a chair meant for students to sit while Harry discussed their grades or work ethic with them, Malfoy did not sit. Neither did Harry.
"Both of you have your wand hand free," Susan said calmly as if this was his chief worry at the moment, which it most certainly was not. "You two will go back to your hotel in town and spend the next few days gathering the food supplies and whatever else you'll need for the trip to the pyramid. I'll check in every night and see if the mark has changed favorably. Only then will I remove the cuffs."
"Where are we?" Potter asked, letting go of Susan's hand as he surveyed the room.
"Not just a memory," Malfoy said, and his expression pulled taut in displeasure. "It is a memory of my mother's. A memory of a prophecy made to her."
"Yeah, well," Draco said and cast a glance around for anything to focus on besides Potter's face. "I didn't need all that money. Nobody needs that much money. It was just sitting in the vault being useless anyway."
Harry raised an eyebrow at the same time that his stomach churned into a tight knot. Prophecies, he hated prophecies. In the summer that had followed his fifth year, while mourning the death of his godfather, he had found some tiny solace in knowing that since the entire Hall of Prophecy had been obliterated and all the records destroyed, he had maybe saved some people from hearing prophecies about themselves and becoming trapped like he had felt after hearing his own. But, of course, memories of prophecies still existed. He just hadn't anticipated another about him.
But Potter was staring at him, his face one of total shock. "Is that true?"
A hurried knock came on the door of the bathroom. "Malfoy? Are you ok?" came Potter's voice.
"I didn't know what it was. If you found a memory with your mother's name on it, you would have watched it in a heartbeat too."
"I thought for sure that bloke with the 'flying carpets' would be a good lead," Harry said before plucking the topmost square of lamb from the skewer with his teeth.
Having been raised by Muggles, Potter knew what all the numbers and letters meant on the clothing. Draco had no clue at first because all of his clothes were tailored for him. There was no point to know his size when a seamstress hemmed all the clothes for him custom. It was embarrassing having Potter explain the sizing to him. At one point, he was pretty sure a teenage girl walking past them in the jeans section had giggled, thinking they were a couple when she saw Potter holding up jeans for Draco and Draco, his face as hot as the sun, had snatched the trousers away and hurried off.
"The third challenge," Draco said, and he hated that he blushed just bringing up the topic. He cleared his throat. "Look, why don't we talk about this when I'm not in the shower?"
Susan pressed her palms against the surface of the table and splayed her fingers as she sighed. "I'll explain it all. Let me start from the beginning. This group I'm a part of is called
Draco turned to face him, praying the other man would assume the fire whiskey was what was making his cheeks flame hot pink now. "I did not throw a tantrum. I like my personal space."
Now, to prevent himself from staring at Potter cooking their dinner, he focused his eyes on the setting sun. It had turned the horizon a gorgeous orange-red. And green.
After unzipping the jacket and tossing it onto the pile to be left behind, Draco gathered the items he was buying, slipped back into the mask of icy indifference he had perfected at Hogwarts, and walked out of the changing room.
Harry sighed. He couldn't deny that the blond had a point. What did this task really prove to Slytherin?
He couldn't help but want to touch the blond again though as a blush tinged the man's cheeks a dusty rose. But he refrained, reminding himself that pushing people into talking about things before they were ready often led to disastrous results. Instead, he bent and picked up his bag. "Should we go on?"
"You need to calm down," Harry whispered. He cast a glance around to make sure no one had noticed Malfoy's behavior. He didn't think prying questions from a Muggle stewardess was what they needed right then.
Draco wanted desperately to free himself from this situation. But his bed was positioned against the side of the tent, and the only way out meant crawling over Potter. And...and it wasn't like it felt terrible to be in Potter's arms, but, well, what the hell was happening?! "Fine, you go first."
Draco's eyebrows shot up. "Cedric. As in you had a crush on Cedric Diggory?"
Dumbledore's grin widened. "I think it positively perfect, Harry. Another prophecy where the power to overcome the darkness is love. Your greatest power once again, Harry. Love."
"W-what are you d-doing?" Draco said between shaky sobs. But even though his tone sounded a bit combative, he didn't fight Potter. Instead, he curled his fingers into the fabric of the man's t-shirt, clinging to it tightly.
"But...but..." Draco felt like the room was spinning. How were they supposed to function while chained together? Use the toilet? Take a shower? Sleep? Holy shit, he did not like the implications of this at all. He already wanted as much space from Potter as possible to keep his feelings for the man at bay.
Susan motioned to the nearest table, and they sat with Susan on one bench and he and Potter on the other across from her. "I know this is a lot to take in," she said slowly. "But, you're already here and have the marks and everything, which tells me you guys have figured out a bit of the prophecy."
Draco made it through most of the clothes, sorting them into stacks of what he wanted to buy and what he wanted to leave behind. But, he hit a problem with a zip-up jumper Potter had suggested. What the hell was wrong with it? As much as he tried, he couldn't get it to zip correctly. The teeth wouldn't catch, and the pull would simply slide up, connecting the two halves oddly as if he had simply pinned the fabric together with a brooch. Zippers on trousers were no problem since the bottom of them were sewn in place. But putting the pull into the bottom rest to properly connect the teeth was quickly frustrating him.
Harry's expression never wavered from incredulity. "Revenge on who? Us? The school?"
"I've been dissecting the lines," Malfoy said as Harry paced.
Potter looked at Draco and raised an eyebrow in question even as he rubbed absently at his wrist where the cuff had been. "I think we're ready?"
Potter glanced up and straightened up so he was no longer sitting over the potion. "Sorry. Anyways, you need to eat, and we need to discuss a plan. I think we should try the blood tracking thing again to see if it points anywhere more specific now that we're here."
Harry maneuvered Malfoy off of him gently so as not to wake him. Once the man was safely lying beside him in a position that Malfoy would be fine waking up in, Harry looked at the ceiling and blew out a slow breath. How much longer would they be tethered together? Less than a day had passed since Susan cuffed them, and Harry was already feeling much more for the man than he would have ever thought possible. If he had to endure another day of such close proximity, he wasn't sure he would be able to keep his mouth shut or his hands to himself.
to you."
Draco gave a noncommittal hum as he ladled the hot chocolate into two mugs he had conjured. "We'll see how I feel in the morning." He shifted so his back was blocking Potter's view of the cauldron and carefully poured the Sleeping Draught into one of the mugs. Then he slipped the empty vial out of sight in his pajama pocket. He walked back to the bed and handed Potter the spiked mug. "I make it the perfect temperature so it's ready to drink," he said as he sat down opposite him. He took a large gulp of his pointedly and indicated for Potter to try his own.
"Can't we use Floo powder?" Malfoy closed his eyes briefly as the bus took a sharp turn. His chair slid a bit, causing his knee to knock into Harry's.
"I'll write Ron," Harry told her. "He's said things are slower at the auror office now that they've finally tracked down the last of the Death Eaters. He'll probably be thrilled to sub in for a while."
Draco's hand nearly jerked too hard at these words. Now he was picturing it: Potter's lips wrapped around his base while he stared up at him searchingly with those gorgeous green eyes. His cock grew harder and larger in his hand as this image filled his mind.
"Yes. And, we know that's true, the 'mounting agony', from you refusing to meet me. The mark kept hurting worse and worse." Malfoy sat forward, gripping the arms of the chair. "Potter, I hate this as much as you. But, we will actually die if we don't do this."
every letter.
Potter actually had the audacity to grin at him. "Is that what you think? You think because I dated girls in school that I'm straight? I'm bi, actually. I figured it out in fourth year." At Draco's disbelieving look, he added, "Cedric."
He pushed back the sleeve of his cardigan and saw that the black tattoo had turned bright cherry red. Or, half of it had. Neither the lion nor the serpent had changed position or pose, but the lion was still tar black while the serpent glowed like embers.
The part Draco had been dreading most came last. Shopping for Muggle clothes. For one single second, as he stepped into the department store after Potter, Draco was glad his father was dead. He could only imagine the aneurysm Lucius Malfoy would have had if he could see his son picking out blue jeans and t-shirts to try on.
Potter laughed and climbed back out of the shower. Draco heard his shoes squelching with every step back into the main room.
"Might be sore for a bit," Harry said, releasing Malfoy's wrist and pocketing his wand. "I'm not Madame Pomfrey, after all."
"What are you doing?" Malfoy asked and opened his eyes fully to stare at him. His voice shook with an emotion Harry couldn't place. Was it still panic from the plane ride? Or was it fear of a different sort? Or something else entirely?
After they had both finished their lunch and as they were discussing where to head next, the roar of several motorbikes and the sight of people scurrying out of the street made both of them look around. Coming up the street toward them were half a dozen motorcycles, all bright canary yellow. Their riders wore matching yellow jackets that Harry thought must be sweltering in the sun.
Harry loosened his hold on his own chair as the bus settled into an easier pace. Or at least until it stopped for another passenger. "Planes are perfectly safe," he said before Malfoy could get out the protest he knew was coming.
"People approach me because I'm famous. But, the real friends I have are the ones that stuck around even once they realized I had no clue what I was doing half the time and still liked me for who I was underneath the fame." He reached out and stroked two fingers over the back of Malfoy's hand. "You could have some of the greatest experiences of your life if you let people in."
Draco swallowed with some difficulty as fresh nervousness thrummed through his veins. But, he did as Potter asked, or rather, commanded. And there was something so undeniably sexy about Potter's behavior that he didn't even feel any annoyance at taking demands from him. He tilted his head down and opened his eyes so he could see the man's hand moving rapidly up and down his cock. He shivered as the sight paired with the tactile sensation seemed to blend together wonderfully and make him even harder. The next time Potter's hand slid to his tip, he groaned loudly as he suddenly released, spilling cum onto the dais in several long stripes.
"Potter," he breathed after a few more moments. His mouth felt completely dry as the nerves and excitement from having Potter touch him warred in his stomach. But this feeling was quickly being overtaken by a growing tightness lower down. He tucked his face into Potter's neck and gave a little mewl when the raven-haired man gently squeezed his sac.
Whatever Harry had expected to be inside, it was not a half-clothed, walking and cursing skeleton that was trying to shift a silver cauldron out of its path only to have both its arms fall off at the elbow and clatter to pieces across the floor. "Fucking Ra," it grumbled, its jawbone clacking as it spoke.
To Harry's surprise, Malfoy just scoffed loudly and stormed off into the third task's chamber. Harry followed him inside, and the wall sealed behind him. He was briefly aware of Malfoy grumbling a string of curse words and bad names for Slytherin under his breath as the blond strode to the middle of the room where a short and wide dais sat.
"We should be able to get all our errands done by nightfall," Malfoy said as they took two seats at the back of the Knight Bus. He had summoned it there with his wand hand and a loud bang as soon as he had seen Harry headed down the main street in Hogsmeade.
"I just need a leave of absence," Harry cut in. He had known she would not receive his news well, but he had seen no other way to fulfill the prophecy. He couldn't juggle classes, curriculum planning, grading, and hunting who knew where for lost tombs all at the same time. Even devoting week days to Hogwarts and weekends to tomb hunting would stretch him too thin and keep him running back and forth. It was one or the other, and considering the latter would kill him if he put it off or refused, well...there was no option.
They fell back into silence, and Harry was somehow both content and bored as he simply listened to Malfoy shower. It was only the sound of rushing water and the opening and closing of bottles of body wash and shampoo, but it was relaxing.
"I don't know!" Harry said.
He tugged a hand through his hair and blew out a breath. This was not how this was supposed to be going. Barely one day into their journey and he could feel himself growing weak under a mere glance from Potter. And Potter didn't even know it! If he did, he would surely have heard about it by now.
try to hurt yourself again."
Draco's stomach plummeted. Five hundred years and no one had succeeded with the prophecy's tasks. How could they succeed where other witches and wizards had failed repeatedly?
Harry huffed. "I didn't mean you're doing it on purpose. But, you're going to hyperventilate if you don't stop." Not to mention, Harry's arm would probably fall off and become a singed stump.
As Harry set aside another graded essay, this one marked with a 'P', his gaze traveled to the open letter on the corner of his desk. It had arrived from Malfoy at breakfast that morning. It read:
His mind was churning too fast now and it was adding more blurred and anxious thoughts every minute. It was as if someone had set up a whirlpool in his head and decided to chuck wet-start fireworks, dragon dung, and a Howler in it. The most negative things he thought about himself, attachments, and recent events of the past few days swirled around in a fast, loud spiral that seemed to drag him deeper and deeper into despair that he couldn't entirely explain.
They went to Gringotts in silence, and they both withdrew gold from their vaults. They exchanged about half of it for Muggle money, including British pounds, French francs, and Egyptian pounds. Apparently, Potter somehow knew from the Muggles he had lived with that a lot of flights to Africa often had a connecting flight in Paris. Draco barely glanced at the Muggle money as he put it away in his bag. He had never handled Muggle currency, and it felt like a loss to have his heavy galleons changed to paper.
Harry laughed at this, but he quickly stopped when he saw Malfoy's expression darken. He shook his head. "I meant every word and action in that room."
No. Harry couldn't allow himself to think about Malfoy's body. He had already done that enough that day when he had nearly crushed the man's ribcage on the Knight Bus. That was the closest he had ever been to the man, and having been startled in the moment, he had found himself captivated by those grey eyes. Grey eyes with flecks of dusty blue around the irises. He had never noticed. But of course, he reminded himself, why would he have noticed that? Only a lover or a mother should be close enough to know those eyes were more than just grey. And he was definitely neither of those things. Nor did he want to be.
"Uh, yeah!" Draco said. Panic had gripped his chest at Susan's words to Derek, and it was evident from the look on Potter's face that he was experiencing something similar. "You said the 'next set of prodigies'. We aren't the first ones?"
Draco had already come to that conclusion. He knew he would have to think like Slytherin to make it through this pyramid of puzzles, but he hadn't expected to be asked to not use magic. What kind of tool would be provided?
Harry didn't argue. It was obvious that even given sound logic and reasoning, Malfoy would not be able to properly consider the information while in this distressed state. Instead, Harry just needed to focus on calming him down first. Once Malfoy was calm and the mark stopped burning, they could reconsider the plane or alternate travel options.
He took his glasses from the bedside table and put them on. He examined the mark on his arm, and his heart jolted with surprise. The lion and serpent no longer looked hostile or wary of the other. Rather, they looked curious about each other, and, in Harry's opinion, the serpent even seemed a bit bashful.
Draco's hands curled into fists, his face on fire now. He wasn't sure if it was anger or embarrassment because he was feeling plenty of both just then, most of it directed at himself for getting caught, not Susan.
"I am just trying to help!"
"What do you know about it?" Malfoy hissed, his eyes wide now. He made to stand up and push past Harry's legs, but Harry pulled him back down into his seat.
Could he possibly be attracted to Malfoy? That was absurd. Maybe...maybe it was a side effect of the prophecy. Since Gryffindor and Slytherin had been lovers, was the prophecy trying to make history repeat itself by bringing the two houses back together in a more intimate way? The original love affair brought into the present with fresh blood? But that didn't make sense either somehow.
"Huh? Oh. Yeah," Malfoy said, blinking and looking up. He made eye contact with him for the briefest of seconds before looking away toward the city. "I'm just tired. We should tell Susan we're alive and then head back to the hotel. We can use our blood on the map again and see where we're headed for Gryffindor now. Make a plan and stuff."
"Ok, I think we made a pretty good dent in the supplies we need," Malfoy was saying as he tucked a few cans of green beans and peaches out of sight in his bag. "Time for dinner?"
"You're taking forever," he explained and then frowned at Draco's predicament. A sudden grin broke across his face, and this only made Draco more furious.
Potter seemed to understand at once, and his gaze flitted to the dagger in Draco's hand. "It must follow the dagger."
Harry laughed hollowly. "I know. And I didn't want to argue for something I knew I was going to lose." He slowly got to his feet, giving Draco time to do the same without pulling on the chain.
He knew he was running out of options. He had no choice but to meet Malfoy the following day, but he'd be damned if he went willingly. And in some sort of weird rebellion, he didn't wish to give in to the sleep that was hounding him. Sleeping would mean surrendering to the next day where he would meet Malfoy. If he stayed up and did distracting work, like grading, it would slow the progress of the night.
They both looked up, and Harry frowned. That couldn't be right. There were still half a dozen passengers to go before them. Well, maybe one of them had been going to the Leaky Cauldron too.
He drank more of his water while he continued to people watch. It was rather unsettling how easily Muggles seemed to get along without magic. Granted, everything seemed more inconvenient and they didn't know they were missing out on so much.
Seemingly aware of being stared at, Malfoy growled, "Not a damn word, Potter."
Draco turned to Potter, who was waiting expectantly. "Right, so..." He explained the brief message the cobras had given him in Parseltongue.
Potter scrubbed a hand over his face, and Draco could practically feel the stress pouring off of him in waves. Or maybe that was his own, because the whole situation Susan was describing sounded like mostly guessing.
Draco nodded eagerly and laid his head back against Potter. "Yes. Make me cum."
"Yeah, so...dinner," Malfoy said quietly, not looking at Harry.
But barely a minute had passed when a distinct pain erupted in Harry's forearm, and he inhaled sharply. It was directly where the prophecy's mark was located and was burning fiercely. It was not like the stabbing pain he had experienced when he had refused to answer Malfoy's letters. Rather, this one was burning as if someone was pressing a white hot brand to his skin.
clippings. The entire bottom right drawer was bursting with letters he had received over the past two years. He kept every letter he received for either lifting up his spirits when he felt lonely or for documentation purposes.
"Not until you tell me what has you so upset." There was a pause. "Did I do something? Are you angry with me? If you feel like I'm pushing you into something you don't want or aren't ready for, that's not what I-"
"Alright," Potter said. "Last one. We got this."
"I currently can't Apparate," Draco explained, though he did so begrudgingly. The other man would discover it for himself soon enough. "And I don't think you can either."
Apprehensive and highly annoyed that Susan seemed to know a lot more about their life-threatening quest than they did, Draco growled as he took her hand. As soon as Potter grabbed her other hand, they turned on the spot and disappeared with a soft 'pop'.
Instantly, Harry felt like someone had just taken a beater's bat to his elbow and shattered all the bones there. He gasped, and so did Malfoy, both of them clutching at their arms.
"I think that you need to understand something about prophecies," Potter said, and his expression darkened slightly. "Something you probably didn't pick up from reading a book on prophecies by some witch or wizard who's never been the subject of one. Something Dumbledore told me when I first heard the prophecy about me and Voldemort." He exhaled and held his gaze. "We have full choice over how this plays out."
"After you then," Potter said, motioning with his own lit wand for Draco to ascend the staircase first.
They got dinner, which was surprisingly easy to eat given their current predicament. They sat across from each other, both their left arms laid casually on the table so the chain didn't pull at either of them. Harry kept watching Malfoy from the corner of his eye, but the man never spoke or made eye contact with Harry.
Potter nodded. "I was thinking the same," he said.
Infuriatingly, Potter held his hands up innocently. "Whatever. I'll be outside while you finish up."
It was obvious to him that the mark must refer to Gryffindor and Slytherin, but he had no clue beyond that of its significance. Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin, two of the Hogwarts founders, were known to have grown apart and become rivals after a series of disagreements on the running of the school. So, that must be why the lion and serpent were pictured fighting. But, why show up as a tattoo-like mark? Why on Harry? Why, period?
The Heads went back to murmuring among themselves, but Harry was more focused on Dumbledore. The man's portrait hadn't spoken yet and was still smiling like he knew a delicious secret.
The plane suddenly rocked, buffeted by turbulence. Though no one else seemed alarmed, Malfoy instantly seized the armrest again. But, this time, Harry's arm was there, so he latched onto the man's arm with a vice grip.
He and Potter exchanged a wary glance, and then Potter laid his right arm on the table, outstretched toward her.
Angry determination swept over Malfoy's features as he spun around, snatched up the scepter, and slammed the head of it down onto the glass coffin. The glass shattered, and the skeleton priest fell to the floor with a clatter as easily as if he had been a puppet whose strings had been cut.
Harry pursed his lips and just looked down at the mark. It hadn't changed much, or so he thought. Upon closer inspection, he could see the lion was now treading on the snake's tail. "Alright! Alright, I'll help!"
Malfoy waved a hand frantically, indicating for him to shut up. "Stop, just...stop. We shouldn't be thinking about each other in that way. Besides, even if you had those thoughts about me, you never would have actually acted on them if I hadn't made you." As he spoke, he rubbed his fingers over his inner left wrist, making this action seem like a nervous tic Harry hadn't noticed him do before.
Malfoy whirled around. "What do you mean '
Because Harry knew what they had to mean. It wasn't hard to figure that out when the first and largest secret that came to mind immediately was his feelings for Malfoy. He would have to verbally confess those feelings to Malfoy, and he was sure, Malfoy would have to admit his own feelings in return or the pyramid would never appear to them.
"It's a long story, but I'm honestly psyched to see you," Potter said.
Malfoy flushed scarlet once more and drew himself up straighter. "This isn't some big joke, Potter. Slytherin is forcing me to humiliate myself to avoid dying. And, honestly, the threat of impending death if I refuse is not the most arousing thing."
Harry stared at him. "Do you even realize how insane that sounds? We have to get their souls, ghosts, whatever to kiss and make up so they can move on to the afterlife?"
Draco nodded. "We just need to grab a few more things in town, but it won't take long."
"I suppose," Draco said, his own tone less than enthused. "I don't really like being threatened with death if I don't help you resolve things with your lover though."
"Maybe." Potter slid his hand down to Draco's neck and brushed his thumb over his jaw now. "But Slytherins are about determination and ambition, are they not? That's motivation for bravery too." When Draco turned his head away, he continued, "Is that what got you so upset? Thinking about how scary attachment to me could be?"
"The Chamber of Secrets was meant to be hidden so well that the other founders wouldn't be able to locate it," Draco pointed out. "But Slytherin had a flair for the dramatic and flashy. If there was ever a place to splurge on something, it was his tomb. It'll be hidden, sure, but it'll be obvious it's his. Maybe it's invisible. I can't imagine he
Just thinking of needing to get out of the street, Harry seized Malfoy around the waist and tugged him back to the curb just as the car whizzed past, followed by police sirens getting closer.
"I don't hate Andromeda or the Weasleys," Draco said waspishly. "If you had a father like mine, you would have hated anyone he told you to hate. I even came to believe that I hated them myself for my own reasons. It wasn't until sixth year that I started to see how I really felt. I didn't want to kill anyone. I started to see through the lies. And then I saw our classmates and teachers at the battle, completely ready to do what I could never do - lay down their lives for a cause they believed in. And I could never do that because I didn't know what I believed. Potter, I've done a lot of thinking these past two years. I still don't like Muggles or the Weasleys and I've never even met my aunt. But, no, I don't hate them."
Walking proved to be more difficult than he had anticipated too. As the sun rose higher, the air swelled with thick heat. The sand seemed to suck as his trainers with each step, and the scorching heat from the sand burned through their soles. They talked very little and only stopped periodically to refill their water bottles with simple murmurs of Aguamenti.
Harry stepped aside so Malfoy could ascend the last stair and speak in Parseltongue to the serpent. Instead of speaking back to him, it simply bowed its head in respect, and the door swung open.
"Potter, it's only paying attention to me," Draco said. "'Attention undivided.' It'll only pay attention to one of us."
Harry grinned and got to his feet. He walked over to him, deciding to take a chance while Malfoy was still laughing. "What is the reason that nothing can happen between us, Draco?" he asked softly.
"Because I care about you, and I care that you're unhappy, and I want to help if I can." Potter ran his fingers through Draco's hair, and though hot water was hitting his back and making him warm, Draco shivered.
Draco yawned for the third time since Susan had knocked on their door and Potter had practically dragged him out of bed. As much as he wanted to be freed from Potter, did it have to be dawn when it happened? He had been exhausted after staying up and brewing those potions, and Potter had the nerve to wake him up when the sky was still pink with the flush of the slowly emerging sun.
Potter seemed to suspect he had heard a repeat message and made to speak, but Draco jumped to his feet and stormed off to the bathroom to take a shower. When he returned, Potter was seemingly asleep.
Harry frowned. "We barely scratched the surface. All we did was talk about how you don't want attachments."
This was different than his panic attack on the plane. That had been a reaction to finding himself in a tight space, but this anxiety was more thought-driven. Thoughts ran circles in his head of how he wanted to give in, risk heartbreak with Potter. And then every time he saw himself smile in some fantasy future with the man, the floor seemed to disappear from under him as his mind brashly interjected with thoughts of death or a simple change of mind turning his happiness to abrupt devastation.
"What do we do?" Malfoy shouted in his ear. "How are we supposed to make it not see us? There's nowhere to hide. I was never good at Disillusionment Charms."
As soon as they were a few feet inside, the doors swung shut, enclosing them in total darkness.
Malfoy released him and sat up straighter, and now Harry could see the mark on the inside of the man's arm. The Gryffindor lion was burning bright red just like the serpent had on the plane.
"I don't know what to do," Harry admitted quietly. He desperately wished Hermione was there. She would have known what to do, would have thought of a spell or something else brilliant to calm Malfoy.
The use of the blond's first name seemed to wrench him back to sobriety, though he still seemed less tense than a few moments previous. He frowned, sighed, and then said, "I'm not into getting close to people anymore. I really never was, to tell the truth. But it only got worse when my parents and most of my friends died in the battle. And then the rest seemed to just vanish. People didn't write back after the war ended. I just can't take that kind of hurt again. Not death, not heartbreak, not anything. I like being in control of who has access to my emotions."
Harry and Malfoy looked at each other before both taking off up the street after the bikes. The crowd had closed back together as soon as the bikes had passed, so moving through the many people was like pushing through mud. But the bikes were still visible up ahead, slowly moving as they too were caught waiting for the crowd to let them through on the next corner.
She held up a hand. "Save it, Draco. We all know you wouldn't publicly donate the money under your name. You did it anonymously, helping to pay for funerals for Professor Snape, Nymphadora Tonks, Ted Tonks, Remus Lupin. You even sent flowers to the Weasleys for Fred's funeral after you had discovered George had already paid for everything else himself."
Snape's eyes slowly moved to him. "I think Phineas is suggesting we Slytherins cannot keep our personal and professional lives separate. That Salazar Slytherin himself was not so cunning as to keep a relationship secret regardless of who it was with." He sneered as if this were a personal insult, and Harry understood why since he had learned the truth about Snape's past during the Battle of Hogwarts.
They brewed late into the night, and Draco wondered if part of the reason for doing so was that they both wanted to avoid the rapidly approaching problem of their sleeping arrangement.
Harry's attention was drawn away from the vial at this statement. "What?"
Susan could have grown a second head right then, and Draco would have been less surprised. "Why would Hufflepuff want to protect Slytherin's tomb?"
Harry watched in amazement as the drops of blood quivered and drew together into a larger bubble. Then the large drop began moving up the map. It settled directly on top of the old drop of blood and was quickly absorbed into the parchment. The dot and label of Harry's own name was the same, except now brighter, newer.
"Not exactly what I had in mind, Potter."
Draco actually smiled at this. "Well, thanks to our dear prophecy, I can actually speak it now. I found out when I got home from the vault that day. I could suddenly understand my pet snake and talk to it. It was wild."
Susan shrugged, looking troubled. "We can't say for sure. There's very little documentation downstairs because the prodigies would arrive, learn what they needed from us, and head off into the desert. Sometimes, we'd find their bodies weeks later, somehow already reduced to skeletons. Other times, there was nothing to find. Probably some died from dehydration or hunger, and others probably made it to the tomb but couldn't get past the tests. Either way, yes, I think it was because they just couldn't work together how they were supposed to. That's not even to say how many pairs didn't even make it to Egypt."
Draco blinked and looked around. Potter was staring at him, though he could barely make the raven-haired man out in the darkness. The wind had all but extinguished their fire, and the embers were sparking feebly.
He felt incredibly small, incapable. If Muggle children were comfortable riding in airplanes, why wasn't he? Yes, he really was claustrophobic, and he hated it. But normally, it wasn't that bad of a reaction. Granted, in normal situations, he was usually able to remove himself from the tight space quickly and calm down. But feeling trapped and helpless, it had triggered a panic attack. He didn't like anyone seeing him in that state, but it was especially worse knowing Potter had witnessed it. At least he hadn't cried in front of Potter. That would have been a disaster. Though...he had almost cried, and likely would have if holding Potter's hand hadn't helped him calm down.
"They're Muggle-made, so you'll excuse me if I have very little faith in them," Malfoy said.
"Ok, so..." She began, sitting down across from them again. "I think, and they agree with me, that we can't let you guys just head out."
"I'm fine," Malfoy snapped, straightening and batting Harry's hands away as his face flushed a violent pink.
"How did Voldemort know about the tomb?" Potter asked. "It seems only Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and this priest knew about it."
They both fell to the floor over the back of Malfoy's chair in a mass of tangled limbs.
Draco took the vial back and pressed the cork into place. He gave it a few tips back and forth and a swirl for good measure. He set it aside and began to gather all the documents into a stack.
What was the matter with him? He had never found another man's eyes so alluring. He knew he was gay, of course. Well, bi. He had obviously very much enjoyed his time with Ginny. But they weren't together for other reasons. Wanting different things, different lifestyles, that sort of thing. He wanted out of the limelight; she enjoyed it, being on an international Quidditch team.
"I think Slytherin's having a right laugh about all of this," Draco grumbled after he had swallowed a few large gulps of water.
Malfoy whipped around to face him, his expression tight even as his eyes were wide with fear. "What?" he hissed between labored breaths.
Draco crossed his arms over his stomach. "That's not the issue right now."
Malfoy was still breathing erratically, his eyes shut again and a sheen of sweat shone on his forehead. "I have to get off this plane," he said. "I can't breathe."
Harry's thoughts strayed to Malfoy as he took down the tent with a few waves of his wand and then stuffed it back into his backpack. The blond had been uncharacteristically silent and extra broody since the encounter with Slytherin's spirit. Even now as Harry vanished the remains of their cooking fire from the previous night, Malfoy was staring dejectedly at the ground.
“You’d think if I fought in the war I would’ve engaged with some Dark Magic, wouldn’t you?” Jacobs’ incredulous expression eases, though, into something more solemn. “I should have, though. I was nineteen, and I… do you want me to say I fought beside Harry Potter? I didn’t.”
“I need your help!”
“Are you a wizard?”

him, I just—last night we just—and then we kind of… I didn’t even know him.”
If it was the other way around, if Draco’s was visible and Harry’s wasn’t, Harry would’ve told Draco. He has honor. He’s less selfish by leagues.
Harry, who literally chose to die for the chance that it would save everyone else? Harry, who buried Dobby with no magic to honor his memory, even in the shitstorm of the Second War? Harry, who fought a battle every single year of his Hogwarts years and managed to come out still in love with life instead of defeated and jaded, who never stopped fighting until stopping fighting was the only way to win—and then
It’s not like Harry’s going to see him and forget whatever plan they had because Malfoy’s eyes are just the right side of light grey. Definitely, definitely not!
Harry stares for a moment. He hasn’t seen Malfoy with his sleeves rolled up for what feels like a very long time, and he can’t stop his eyes from going to the Dark Mark that stands out against his skin. It sends something black and horrible tumbling in Harry’s gut, but he swallows that down. He looks up at Malfoy’s expression—absolute shock—and maybe a little bit at the way his white-blond hair looks yellow-er in daylight and how his lips look very chewed, but definitely not that much time.
Draco swallows. His whole body is tingling. “I don’t know.”
Pansy’s mouth tightens.
Harry itches to take his hands and
It’s worth it for the feeling of Harry’s soft, warm mouth on his, it’s worth it for the feeling of Harry’s firm, careful hand at his jaw, it’s worth it for the feeling of Harry’s fingers combing through Draco’s hair, it’s worth it for the sheer, simple knowledge that this is
Harry’s sitting in an armchair in his quarters, staring into the fire with this unhappy look on his face that breaks Draco in two. His shoes are up, and he’s brought his feet up on the armchair, his arms wrapped around his knees. He looks like a kid.
“Slut-shaming.” Harry’s pulling on boxers, and then trousers. “Do I have to? Is it not enough to enjoy the current moment?”
“Keep your voice down!” Parkinson shrieks.
Draco looks up as Harry takes his seat next at Draco’s side in the Great Hall for breakfast, his hair even wilder than it normally is—at night, Draco always swears Harry’s hair can’t get any messier, and then in the morning, it’s even more out of control. It curls every which way, and if Draco hadn’t seen Harry run a comb through his hair every morning when they roomed together, he’d be sure Harry had never met a comb in his life.

You’re a person. Just like everybody else.”
And yet, here she is.
“I’m going to bed,” Harry says abruptly, and he turns on his heel.
Draco thinks. “I don’t know.”
“Are you a wizard?”
“Oh,” says Draco. “But that’s obvious, isn’t it? They’re dating you.”
Harry suggests, “We could fly?” at the same time as Ron says, “Apparate,” at the same time as Hermione says, “You cannot Apparate on Hogwarts grounds.”
“Flexibility is important,” Harry says in a low voice. Or maybe Draco’s just imagining it’s lower than normal. Harry’s fingers trace the top of Draco’s paper absently, wide brown fingers with blunt nails cut short, more nimble than they look. “No matter how tightly you plan, you’re going to have to loosen up when the time comes.”
Harry says
. “Was it any good?”
“He’s a virgin in spirit,” Draco counters lamely, and changes the subject. “But I didn’t ask anyway. I don’t ask about their sexual history, that would be too awkward.”
irrelevant right now.
Malfoy makes a high noise in his throat, his hands hanging loosely at his sides, his eyes not leaving Harry’s face. Harry’s pretty sure he’s going to die. “I—what—why did you…
Harry shifts back and forth on his feet. The grass keeps ungrowing and then suddenly jumping back up before ungrowing again. “About what?”
Draco wrinkles his nose. He’s heard an excessive amount about “elementary school” from the Muggles here in college, as well as from a few Muggleborn wizards and wizards whose parents decided to send their children to Muggle school before Hogwarts. “Elementary school,” he says, as if it feels bitter in his mouth, “I can’t believe Muggles send
Quickly, Harry pulls the chain from around his neck and gives it back to Pansy. “We can’t get caught,” he whispers.
He draws in a breath. He can do this. He’s done bigger things than go back and get one guy he didn’t particularly like from the past. Even if that guy turned out to be kind of fit when they returned for Eighth Year, and recently that’s been making it a little hard for Harry to look at him. Even if sometimes he sees Malfoy and kind of loses his train of thought for a minute.
Draco.” He shoves Draco’s hands off of his face and pushes his curls off of his forehead again, and there it is, Draco’s soulmark. Harry’s scar. “That’s so fucking unfair.”
Of course. Draco has been an idiot.

“Malfoy,” he says eventually, “You’re not going to crash my broom. You’re—oh fucking hell—you’re a good flyer but I’m never going to say it again in my life. And it’s almost four AM. So…”
Is he? Is he fond of Harry?
“Shut your
eagerly!
It doesn’t matter, anyway, because the next second, Malfoy is yanking his hands away and hurrying down towards Hogwarts’ doors, muttering something about sleep that Harry doesn’t catch.
Malfoy feels very strong and solid against him.
They’re uncomfortably close together because they have to share the Time-Turner chain, and Harry has to look up if he wants to see Malfoy’s expression. He decides he rather doesn’t. A retort rises to Harry’s tongue, but right now is the absolute
Malfoy shakes his head, his hands tightening even more around Harry’s, hard enough now that it almost hurts a little. “I’m a little bit in love with you.”
Eventually, she stands abruptly and snatches her wand off Harry’s bed where she set it down to fix up her hair and Conjure some clothes. That makes sense. Her pajama top doesn’t exactly… and her pajama bottom doesn’t exactly…
” Pansy snorts, “Oh, yeah,
” Harry hisses. “Shush, Ron.” Not that he disagrees, really. Only, Malfoy could really be in danger right now. He’s all for talking shit about Malfoy, but they should wait until Malfoy’s safe, at least.
The water splashes gently around the sides of the boat, and the rhythmic sound of the oars in the water fills the silence between them. Malfoy sits with his elbows on his knees, head tipped down to watch his fingers slowly move about, doing nothing. His hair is still messy and loose and white-blond in the starlight.
There’s a very pregnant silence.
Draco agrees to stop. “I don’t…” he begins carefully.
Because people were bullied off of talking to him, but Harry doesn’t say it. Harry doesn’t really talk about bullying with Draco. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out why not.
Harry considers Pansy, who has dropped his arm in favor of gesturing sharply with pointing fingers and violent chopping motions. “Let me get dressed,” he says. Pansy rolls her eyes again, but waves her hand in the universal
“Oh, come on, Malfoy.”
,” Pansy snaps. She seems to not realize Harry was joking. “He wouldn’t.”
“Do you ever think,” Harry says, in this thoughtful, detached tone that makes Draco’s stomach go cold. He doesn’t answer Draco’s question—the answer is obvious. “When I came back the second time, maybe I wasn’t meant to. Maybe I wasn’t meant to match anybody. Because I was supposed to die.”
“But you can often feel like they matter to you an irrationally significant amount.”
have a fear of flying?”
“He’s changed since school,” Draco says, looking quickly back down. Harry’s stripping off his shirt. Draco can hear Harry wandering closer to where Draco is laying on his bed. “Do you like him?”
“I’m not. I tried to get rid of my Dark Mark,” Malfoy says, in a way that suggests he doesn’t really believe in his own side. His jaw works, and his eyes fly to his still-exposed wrist. He avoids Harry’s eyes as he unfolds his sleeve and drags it back down to cover up the Dark Mark. “But apparently, it’s irreversible.”
motion before dashing down the side of the house, the grass muffling her footsteps.
“I am…” Harry trails off. “Pissed to hell at you.”
Malfoy swallows again, and then he opens his eyes—looking down at the Firebolt and not at Harry—and pushes the Firebolt Harry’s way. “I don’t want to fly,” he says, his voice rough and quiet.
And he’s got a roommate who doesn’t mind Harry bringing boys or girls back, so long as they firmly magic up some curtains and cast all the important privacy charms.
Approximately 20% of the time.
Malfoy doesn’t rise to that bait, either. He just gets on the broom and waits for Harry to get on after him, holding the broom like it isn’t his. Which it isn’t, it’s just a strange thing to see, because Malfoy usually acts like
“There’s a common myth that soulmates are extra-special if their soulmarks are in the same place. False. There are no credible accounts of this ever happening—they are
And then, once Malfoy’s said something shitty, Harry will snap out of it!
He takes as long as he can soaping up, and as long as he can rinsing down.
Harry’s face is blank, completely, utterly devoid of expression, as if the message his eyes are sending him has simply not yet reached his brain.
Draco draws a breath. “Don’t ask me that.”
Harry laughs, loud and harsh and humorless, and steps back, heading toward the door with his papers in his bag. “It would’ve hurt less if you’d told me at the beginning you were my soulmate and you didn’t want me than to find out after all these years and
, I’m just saying you don’t have quite so much to lose.”
But the Boyfriend Check is
And the thing Harry sees is that they are on the other side of the Great Lake.
Pansy’s quiet for a moment. “I’m… Thank you for your help,” she says finally, “But I don’t think you two should come.” She points to Hermione and Ron. And then, hurriedly, she repeats, “But thank you, really.”
“Why would I be joking?” Harry’s not sure what’s going on. “What would be the punchline?”
Harry blinks some more. He’s feeling very hot under the covers in the summer heat, but he doesn’t want to lower them because Parkinson’s still staring. “What—ah—what
“Oh? You didn’t want to strip down to your boxers and get your sweaty body in my personal space just for the sake of it?” Since Draco’s hand is already sweaty, he sticks it in Harry’s sweaty curls and rumples his hair a bit, as if he’s trying to get revenge on Harry for dirtying up his hand. “I need to go wash my hands.”
. His knees are weak and his shirt—a long-sleeve button-down because
Harry feels his face heat. “Pansy,” he echoes weakly.
Harry’s breath rushes out. “
“Maybe when we’re playing? I’ve probably run into him a couple of times, but I’ve never
He and Malfoy both look at the Time-Turner between them. It is not still spinning.
Pansy takes off across the Malfoy grounds, probably in the direction of wherever they keep their brooms. “You were kissing a minute ago. I don’t see how this is my fault.”
“Should do that to me,” Draco blurts.
Jacobs raises his eyebrows at Draco. “Relax! Yes, my answer is no. It’s a joke.”
this is Harry kissing Draco, he
Malfoy turns and sneers some more. He probably doesn’t know how to
Harry thinks.
“Sure am,” Draco says. “Goodbye.”
“Do you want to hear the full list?” Draco asks. “Or—even better—would you like to read the transcript I made of my Boyfriend Check with Jacob Jacobs? The strikes are circled in red.”
Harry looks miserable. He has always looked miserable, every time Draco looks his way, and Draco has been boring holes into the back of Harry’s head for months.
“Has Harry Potter ever expressed a dislike of your company or your person?”
Draco’s heart aches again.
Malfoy just kissed him, for Merlin’s sake!
“We’re not taking a risk, are you out of your mind? If we lose that gamble we can fuck up all of reality as we know it!” Pansy runs a quick hand through her hair, and it falls back around her shoulders messily. She was just fixing it up, but Harry doesn’t point that out.
And then she’s gone again.
Nothing about what Draco’s saying makes logical sense.
“That’s even
“Eight strikes,” he says, bringing his eyes back down to the page. “I’m eight strikes, if you were wondering.”
“As if.” Draco fights to keep his voice from cracking. His soulmarks scream at him. It feels like the skin under his soulmarks is peeling off.
Draco can’t even think it.
Harry’s stuck on the Dark Mark part. The Dark Mark? Why would Malfoy want to go back in time to the day he got the Dark Mark? Immediately, his brain supplies him with
He doesn’t say
They couldn’t also expect him to have a verbal filter.
Pansy juts her chin out, her eyes flashing. “You went back
Underneath Draco’s robe, he’s wearing a crisp white button down and a pair of black trousers, every day, always. Harry teases him about them—and about how he won’t so much as take off his shirt to change in anyone’s presence.
“None of you is fractured,” Draco says quietly.
He’d said the same thing last night: they were in their shared office, tired and rubbing at their eyes. Draco didn’t want to go back to his room because he’d have to say goodnight to Harry and he
” He sounds… well, he sounds the way he always does when he talks about soulmates: wistful. The tiniest edge of pain. They’ve had this conversation so many times. “I just don’t understand. How can you just… sit here when there could be someone out there
Anyway. Harry doesn’t have the brain power to deal with that right now. He needs to solve
“Yeah.” Harry’s warm breath ghosts across Draco’s collarbone, sending a shiver down Draco’s spine, and Draco starts… well, he starts wishing he had a pillow in his lap.
Harry Potter is playing soccer when Draco gets back from the Boyfriend Check.
“We’ll Apparate close and walk the rest of the way,” Harry suggests. “I really don’t see any other option.”
Harry’s the brightest part of Draco’s life, but it’s fine. The feeling isn’t mutual and the thing is, Draco doesn’t even mind because he can’t begrudge Harry Ron or Hermione or Teddy or the students that Harry genuinely adores. He can’t begrudge Harry
“Draco,” Harry says, “What do you
Draco must look like a maniac to Harry: hair in disarray, hands scrambling to press against Harry’s warm cheeks, still wet, his breath coming in gasps.
It’s four in the morning.
Pansy makes another frustrated noise, but she pushes on, seeming to elect to ignore the fact that Ron has sat himself on the edge of Harry’s bed and is listening intently.
Harry can’t help but bristle at that. He leans back to dismiss Malfoy, but the boat sloshes, so he leans forward again. Once he’s safely leaning forward, he demands, “What’s that supposed to mean? Maybe I’ve never been a Death Eater, but you don’t think I’ve made mistakes too? I’d have killed for a Time-Turner when—when I got my godfather killed.”
“Mmm… no? I’ve won soccer games against him? I mean, I’ve played a hand in winning… but he’s a really good sport.” Butcher smiles to himself, sweet and pleased, looking down at his teacup.
“Perfect!” he says with joy he doesn’t have to fake, and he grabs Malfoy by the elbow and yanks him in, slamming the door behind them both.
“I know it was. Haha.” Draco takes a moment to refocus. He’s usually better at this, but then again, Harry’s taste is usually better. “Have you had any ill intentions towards Harry Potter in the past?”
“Everett Butcher?” Blonde and narrow and blue-eyed, someone from the soccer team; he’s got those shoes on with the nubs at the bottom—cleats. Hair up in a bun, nervous.
, he said when Draco asked. Entirely playfully, but still.
Just like he’s been doing in school.
Of Harry Potter, all muscles and sweat and bright eyes in the darkness… moving moving moving.
Harry pulls back just as gently as he leaned in, breathing deep and shaky. His forehead presses, warm, against Draco’s. “Why—” His voice is faint, barely a whisper. “Why do you think?”
He always does with his new boyfriends. Sort of… curious. Trying them on like trying on new shirts. Over the two years, they’ve been attending this college, Harry’s already garnered a reputation as being kind of a player—but the most genuine kind.
Harry’s eyes flicker over him, something hot stealing into them. He glances up at Draco. “Er. Thank you for your concern.”
“We shouldn’t kiss, just for that,” Harry says, staring after her.
Draco thinks.
ask?”
Anyone would want to date Harry Potter.
“You’re not studying!” he says, as if delighted, and walks over to Draco. Draco hastily folds the paper in half. “I wish I was here for that—I could’ve dragged you out into soccer.”
Draco does look.
But he keeps his mouth shut.
off to
Harry’s glad they’re going down from the Gryffindor dorms to the Slytherin dorms and not the other way around, because there are many stairs involved, and the air gets progressively cooler as they descend.
“Who’s
His lips brush Draco’s, and then they brush a little harder, and then he’s tilting his head, leaning closer, sliding his fingers into Draco’s hair.
The grin returns. Again. “Merlin’s fucking tits, Malfoy, I’m shagging him and dating him a bit, not getting married.”
Malfoy reaches for her before she goes out the door, his mouth very tight. “You told him,” he mutters, as if Harry can’t hear him from all the way over here, two feet away.
“Oh for—fine.” Pansy turns her back. “I’ll explain while you change.”
to trembling with want,
Harry blinks. “No.”
much easier.
Malfoy breaks away from Harry abruptly and stumbles away, putting a good distance between their bodies, which sends Harry one signal. His hand clutches at Harry’s arm, though, which sends another.
“No.” Michael seems very sure. “You know he’s too good of a fighter. Could
Harry gapes.
“Wait—” Pansy starts, but Harry’s already pulling open the door—
Pansy’s comically surprised when Harry turns back around, trying to focus definitely on business and definitely not on how Malfoy clearly has muscle under that shirt. “That worked out nicely,” she says eventually. “What did you do, Draco?”
Draco shrugs, smiling without thinking about it. The class twitters. “I was right,” he says. “I’m just… Happy. Really, really happy.”
“You’re obviously loved. Granger… Weasley… The girl Weasley, their whole family, really… What does it matter if there’s one more person somewhere out there who could love you too?”
Draco arches an eyebrow. “Did you get that from a therapy book on clearance?”
“I have hands-on experience.” Harry peers over his shoulder. Draco’s on the same page as he was fifteen minutes ago:
“Sharp teaching style,” Harry says quietly.
“Watch out, your head is getting even bigger.” Draco looks away from Harry. His whole life is looking at Harry or looking away from Harry.
The corridors are dark, only very dimly lit at long intervals, but Pansy doesn’t falter or slow as the rest of them hurry to catch up with her, muffling their footsteps hurriedly when Ron’s shoes clack noisily against the stone floor and Pansy hisses something his way.
as if somehow Draco is supposed to relate to this. No, he doesn’t know. He’s never been bullied in school. No matter how much he adored his father and wanted to impress him, how much pressure his father later put on him to do as he was told, he was never treated badly by his parents to the same degree that Harry was by his aunt and uncle.
Softly.
They fly across the country with what Harry hopes is a good Concealer Spell on Harry’s Firebolt, Pansy shouting at Harry to go faster and slower periodically. “You’re mad!” she eventually yells into his ear, and Harry just pushes them faster.
Pansy spreads her hands back, and then opens the room next door
“No—” Fuck, fuck, fuck. Draco chases after him, out the door, seizing the sleeve of Harry’s robe and holding onto it as if it’s a lifeline. It is. “I do.”

“I mean,” Hermione shifts uncomfortably. “Theoretically, yes—”
room precisely when Harry pulled open the door, which contrary to being very bad luck (as it would have been if it was younger Malfoy), this is about as good as their luck will get.
Harry falls silent. He doesn’t know what to say. He’s pretty sure Hermione once told him that most people—a very very large majority of people believe that they are Good, and that they are Right, most of the time. That they are the heroes of some story, even when they do bad things, because it’s just the way people are; they think they’re justified. Not that people believe that they’re perfect, but that most of them believe the sum of them is good.
It feels like he’s
“Wash it down the drain!”
Not a strike.
Draco, what do you
Draco grits his teeth. “Are you a wizard?”
“He’s
The water shuts off and Harry steps out.
“We have lesson plans to finish,” Draco says without looking up from his own scroll. The paper is about how to go about managing the now-mandatory Health Ed lesson given by
“Jacob Jacobs?”
Malfoy does not laugh. His face goes tomato red, and he looks like he’s going to die, and he splutters so hard Harry actually feels sorry for him. This is probably not the kind of flirting he gets in his stupidly proper, pureblood gatherings.
this and
You have to believe me—”
For the first time, the only time, in his five years of friendship with Harry, for the first time in his ten years of loving Harry, for the first time in his fourteen years of wanting Harry, for the first time in his twenty-four years alive.
“Sure, I do. I mean, I risked my life fighting…” Michael Corner’s eyes flick to Draco’s wrist. “I mean. Nevermind. Yeah, I think I do.”
Butcher flushes deep pink, shifting in his seat as if he can still feel it. “Isn’t that… why we’re talking? I mean, don’t you already know that?”
He also doesn’t go once Harry’s gotten on the back and awkwardly wrapped his hands around Malfoy’s waist, trying not to hold tight enough that Malfoy can feel him. Even though obviously when they take off he’ll have to hold Malfoy much tighter—that will be a strange experience.
“He’s definitely not a virgin,” Harry says, voice low and amused.
Harry looks at him. He hesitates.
This is a joke. The Manor is just as big and white and pretentious as Harry remembers it to be, though much less frightening. He can’t remember the last time he’d been here—to thank Narcissa?—but it was soon after the war and it still sort of felt like doom.
This Malfoy appears to have been leaving his bedroom and walking down the hallway right in front of
Pansy raises her eyebrows. “Draco didn’t mention it,” she murmurs.
“What should I say?” He looks to Harry.
It takes Draco a couple of seconds to rewind their conversation so he can figure out what Harry’s talking about.
“Shut

Harry Potter, who rescued Draco Malfoy from the Fiendfyre after Draco had gone there to attack Harry, after Draco had spent seven years preventing Harry’s happy place from being an actually happy place…

“Yeah. I’ll do that.”

Malfoy spins. “Doing what?”
“Jacob Jacobs.”
something? Do you have to see their soulmark to know?”
Harry’s restless tapping stops. He puts his quill down and—Merlin, dear Merlin—looks up with those electric green eyes of his. Draco can see the familiar shape of Harry’s scar peeking out from under his curls.  “I was… what did you say? Out of my mind in love with you.”
Super long chapter, guys! Sorry, I just couldn't find a good place to split it! Enjoy!
Slytherin narrowed his eyes. "You may learn in time that love is more motivating than even death, young Draco."
"I was right," Potter said huskily. "You do taste sweet."
"Any and all documents I could find on the last days of Gryffindor and Slytherin," he answered. He set the papers to the side of him in his bench seat so they were out of the way. Underneath all of the papers had been the world map, which now was the only paper still on the table. "Maddeningly unhelpful. I was up most of the night trying to glean something from it all. Rosmerta eventually made me go to bed though."
They set off again and only stopped for lunch and more water. Draco simultaneously felt like their wandering aimlessly was both futile and productive. The pyramid wouldn't appear until the time was right, but also walking helped keep up the illusion that they were going somewhere and had a destination.
"No, Muggles use them all the time. We can find something different." Seeing that Potter was about to argue with him, he quickly said, "Let's just find out where the first tomb is."
Malfoy's hand tightened on the vial, and for a moment, Harry was sure he might break it. But then the blond thrust the bottle into his hand. Upon examining it, Harry saw it had a label with Narcissa's name and a date that would have put Harry around three years old.
"We aren't talking about this, Potter."
Harry turned to glare at him. The other portraits of past Heads were murmuring to each other, except a few. Snape's was glaring sideways at Phineas, and Dumbledore's was nearly in a fit of giggles. "What?" he asked, not even sure himself whether he was addressing Snape or Dumbledore.
"What just hap-"
"Then why didn't you make up with Gryffindor before you died?" Potter asked.
Harry knew they had barely scraped the surface of Cairo. It was a huge city, and any amount of secret wizarding shops could be hidden practically anywhere. How long would it take them to find a lead? Earlier that morning when it had become apparent finding a wizard in Cairo was not as easy as they had hoped, they had discussed a plan of switching back and forth between scouring the city and exploring the tombs on different days. Eventually, they would find something promising. They had to.
Malfoy closed his eyes tightly again and breathed out hard through his nose. "I don't like small spaces," he ground out finally after a few more breaths.
Malfoy clenched his jaw, and his gaze flitted to their hands. Harry's fingers had went still but were still brushing against his hand. He looked back up at Harry. "I can't think about this right now, Potter." He pulled his hand away and crossed his arms over his abdomen. "I see your point, but I just can't right now."
The bus wasn't very busy that day, and Harry hoped this would mean they would get to London soon. His experience with riding the Knight Bus had not been the most pleasant. He didn't wish for his stomach to get even more twisted with the jerky movement of the bus. "We still have to figure out how we're getting to Egypt. We should do all our errands today, rest, and set out first thing in the morning. A plane would really be best."
It turned out that Draco was very grateful for Susan's presence on their shopping trip and return to the Sphinx. Having her around meant Potter had someone else to talk to besides him. This was lucky because Draco wasn't sure he could hold a normal conversation with the other man just yet. He was still processing the fact that they had slept in the same bed the previous night. And that Draco had liked it. Ok, maybe that was being too generous. He definitely couldn't
"Physical fights have a lot to do with outsmarting your opponent," Potter said.
Draco turned around from where he had been watching the barista make a smoothie and found Potter standing in front of him. "Oh, uh, yeah, I said I wasn't hungry."
Draco nodded. "I know. We'll just have to think of another option. Let's just figure out where we're headed first."
Potter sighed heavily, replaced the cork on the vial, and turned back to the potion. "So. That's not good."
His head still turned away from Malfoy, Harry smirked even as he felt heat rise in his own cheeks. Then he shifted his arm, and Malfoy's hand slid neatly into his so their fingers intertwined as easily and as comfortably as pulling on a glove.
Malfoy's eyebrows drew together. "Yes, Potter," he snapped. "My mother's. But, that's not the point. It-"
"Good," Potter murmured in his ear, though his heart was beating so loudly just then that he wasn't sure if Potter might have yelled it.
He knew what he wanted him to say, knew what it might be now that Potter's arm was wrapped around his waist. But, he wouldn't believe it. He wasn't sure he'd believe it if Potter said it a thousand times, because this prophecy was messing with both of their heads. Draco had had feelings for Potter before this all started, but Potter surely was under the influence of this great love prophecy that was trying to make them be together so they could heal the rift between the two founders.
Draco huffed and rested both arms on the table as he leaned forward and lowered his voice. "Certain prophecies," he ground out, and he was delighted to see Potter hanging on to his every word. Even though he himself wasn't a master of prophecy knowledge, he had learned enough in the past two weeks that he relished in the fact he knew that he knew much more than Potter, "are bound by different rules of magic. They're loosely put into a category of journey or quest prophecies where the time and actions to get to the destination are just as important as the end goal. Basically, it means we have to travel in ways that are less...instant."
Malfoy's cheeks turned a sharp pink. "Even the, uh, bit about the chastity cage?"
"Bellatrix and Rudolphus didn't have any children. I inherited everything from them when they died in the battle. I just hadn't gotten around to going through their vault until recently." Malfoy gave Harry a hard look, his eyes narrowed in annoyance. "I haven't felt like going through the mess you left."
Harry used magic to heal Malfoy's arm before going any deeper into the pyramid. As soon as the statue had frozen, a door at the other end of the room had appeared.
At some point, Malfoy had taken a seat too and had obviously been watching Harry closely. "You see the problem."
He was lying in bed, his dinner twisting unpleasantly in his stomach as he stared up at the canopy of the tent. On the other side of the tent, he imagined that Malfoy was feigning sleep as well. He couldn't see the blond through the darkness, but his side of tent had gone unnaturally still and silent. No rustling or steady breathing that told of deep sleep. They were likely doing the same thing: each lying awake, dreading what Slytherin's words meant.
"Yeah, but assuming it's like the first, magic can't be used on it. And nothing was said about another weapon to use. And...we can't let it see us. So, we have to silence the banshee before she can call it or activate it, maybe?"
Draco shook his head, and she looked momentarily crestfallen until he said, "I don't think I can handle that many people right now. It's been a long day. But we can get dinner, just the three of us. I'm sure they'll still love to hear the story from you later."
Malfoy sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face. "How do we defeat a banshee?"
"Look with me," Potter said. "I want both of us to watch me making you cum."
"And their souls can't rest because of the rift when Slytherin left the school?"
"You said to meet tomorrow," Harry said, very slowly lowering his wand to his side as the blond stepped into the office and shut the door.
Draco's face felt like a fire ball, and he was grateful that he was facing away from Potter. "Potter," he warned softly. His voice was steady despite the fact he felt like a python was constricting his airway.
The pain in his arm instantly lessened, and after a moment, it was gone. It was replaced by a gentle warmth, and as Harry watched, the mark changed yet again. The lion and serpent both closed their mouths, successfully hiding their dangerous fangs. The snake uncoiled itself from the lion's limbs, and the lion lowered its striking paw to the ground. Now, there was a sliver of space between them, the two animals staring warily at each other.
This was it, Draco thought. The statue was going to crush his skull with the next blow, and he couldn't even think where to move quickly enough with the blinding pain from the last strike having dazed him.
The plane filled quickly, and they took to the air. At the instant the plane lifted from the ground, Harry found his arm knocked roughly off the armrest his seat shared with Malfoy. He looked over to see blond's knuckles white under the strain of gripping the armrest so hard. His eyes were closed, and his breathing rate had increased.
"What's ironic?"
"No, he wouldn't have!" said a portrait of a Headmistress whom Harry didn't recognize. She wore a pin of the Ravenclaw eagle on her hat. "And the girls - that is to say Rowena and Helga - would have known everything. The four were close friends, and nothing would have escaped Rowena."
In this brief moment, however, Harry wasn't paying attention to the movement of the bus. He didn't think about or have time to brace himself as the bus took off from its last destination with both the sound and speed of a bullet. Harry's chair jolted, and his instinct to try to lean forward to compensate for the sudden movement only threw him further off balance. He was thrown from his chair and slammed into Malfoy.
Draco went to his bag and began taking out his travel cauldron and what he would need to make some quick hot chocolate. It was about the only thing he knew how to make himself, and he always found it comforting, which was why he had packed the ingredients with him.
Sensing that the skeleton priest meant them no harm, or at least was incapable of doing anything much more than throw a few bones at them, Harry stowed his wand away and began to search for the fallen bones. The tomb was so packed with treasure that it was no wonder why the priest was trapped. There was a path around the room only wide enough for both of Harry's feet if he pressed them together.
"I don't know," Harry said. "I've only seen one as a boggart in Lupin's classroom. Maybe a Silencing Charm will work?"
A mixture made of relief, annoyance, hope, and anxiety all at once swept through him as Potter outright ignored him and opened the door. The man's silhouette appeared on the other side of the curtain.
In his half-asleep state, Harry had thought Malfoy was referring to the Dark Mark, which clearly meant he was out of his mind to suggest Harry had one. He had gone back to bed, and in the morning, he reread the letter to realize exactly what Malfoy meant. So what if Malfoy had the same mark as him? Harry wanted nothing to do with strange marks or Malfoy.
"Actually, yeah, kind of," he said. He smirked. "Least this way I won't lose you in a crowd again."
Draco's eyebrows scrunched together. "Yes, Potter, pyramids. We're in-"
"So, maybe we should figure out where we're going tomorrow," Draco suggested, turning back to Potter. "The prophecy mentioned something about vines and a jungle. I hope that doesn't mean the Amazon in Brazil."
Harry felt a twinge of guilt with what he had said back at the cafe. He had acted like his actions on the previous plane had simply been the product of his desire to stop his own pain. And, though Harry tried now to convince himself that that was the truth, he knew it wasn't. When he had seen Malfoy's panic attack, he had started to worry for the man again. And in that moment when their hands came together for the first time, he had felt something else stir inside him, something he couldn't easily write off as nothing. He wasn't sure exactly what it was. Protectiveness? Vulnerability? Desire? Maybe all three. Whatever it was, he had felt it before. That same something had built in him all of sixth year when he had been falling for Ginny.
Malfoy gave an almost imperceptible nod and let go of Harry's hand. "Yeah. Maybe just turn away and...and just...say stuff that'll...help."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I know that fairy tale, Potter. Whatever you want to think, it worked, I guess." He started off for the other archway, Potter following a few paces behind. He tried not to pay any attention to the few skulls and femurs he stepped over on the way to the door. It seemed very few pairs had made it this far. Would there be more skeletons in the final task's chamber? Or would it be empty and untouched?
"Wait, in the room where it, what?" Draco asked, jumping forward as if to seize him. His hand closed on air where the man's sleeve had been.
"I can't believe it," Susan said as she hugged Potter. She pulled back and glanced at Draco. Thankfully, she made no move to hug him and simply shook his hand instead. "What are you guys doing here?"
Potter actually had the nerve to roll his eyes and laugh. Somehow, Draco knew Potter wasn't going to forget this revelation in a hurry. But, Potter had turned back to Susan. "So, that's why you believe we'll succeed."
Draco stared now, and from the combined heat and disbelief rising in him, he thought he could have punched the other man just then. "You're remembering this
"Did...did you not hear that?" Draco asked.
"I would fuck you," Potter said, and Draco heard him blow out a heavy passion-laced breath. "Just absolutely fuck the hell out of you. And, god...I'd love to tie you up, fit you with a chastity cage, and just ram you full of my cock until you're whimpering with pleasure."
"I know that," Malfoy growled through gritted teeth. "But, I don't have to be happy about it."
He could perform a Cheering Charm, but that was risky. Professor Flitwick had said they worked to reverse sadness temporarily but that some levels of extreme distress could not be affected by the spell. Besides, he hadn't practiced one since his exam at the end of third year. He wasn't about to try to both get it right and be discreet about it on a plane full of Muggles. If it went wrong, Malfoy's behavior could change so drastically that those around him think him mad or drunk. That was not a good idea.
Harry sighed, a tension in his body and mind that he hadn't felt since the days of Voldemort. He was once again tangled up in a prophecy that he wanted no part of. And this time, there was a guarantee he would die if he didn't even try to fulfill it.
Potter knelt behind him almost immediately, and Draco wondered if he had been gradually moving closer to him as he talked. But this anxious thought was driven from his mind as Potter pressed his torso against his back. A thick, very hard and very large erection pressed into the base of Draco's spine. From what he could tell, it seemed Potter had taken off his pants but graciously left his underwear on. Draco was aroused, but he wasn't sure he wanted to have penetrative sex with Potter. Not...well, not yet, anyway.
in that pyramid. It doesn't change the fact that I don't want any attachments. It was all just heat of the moment stuff. Nothing has changed."
Harry nodded and waited for Malfoy to collect his things before starting for the other end of the chamber where a dark archway awaited them. He understood Malfoy's rush to get through the pyramid whether it led to success or failure. It wasn't like they could leave. The only way was forward. And Harry really didn't want to have to spend the night on a hard stone floor surrounded by bones of past pairs that had attempted the same tasks.
They frowned at each other for a moment, and Harry knew they were thinking the same thing even before they both said at the same time, "Banshee."
His chest felt like it was constricting while a weight on his stomach felt very much like someone had implanted a brick there. This tension in his body had built during dinner, accompanied by whirring thoughts. That was a big reason why he had been quiet. He could feel the anxiety attack coming, building, rioting in the blood in his veins.
This statement seemed to break the spell of silence Harry had found cast upon himself. "The problem?" he spluttered. "I see lots of problems!" Suddenly, he was on his feet again, his hands running a familiar path through his hair that he typically reserved for stressful students or long letters from Hermione about politics.
Again, Potter nodded, though it was solemn as if Draco had just revealed a great burden to him. "So, I guess we're headed to Egypt and looking for some really old stuff with snakes on it."
"Ok," Draco said. "So, these other pairs of prodigies...did they just refuse to work together and keel over?"
"Yes!"
"Could you not get onions in my Calming Draught?" Draco snapped as Potter's hand holding the hawawshi hovered precariously over the rim of the cauldron in the man's apparent distraction. He knew he should have made the potion himself, but Potter had volunteered to do it for him again to simply have some on hand for emergencies. And since he didn't fancy potion brewing much himself, he hadn't argued the point.
Harry sighed. There was no point hiding it from her. He had asked for her help deciphering the meaning of the image on his arm. She might as well know what he had found out and what he had to do. He explained it to her, giving her as much information as he knew and finishing it by telling her Malfoy was in Hogsmeade as they spoke, waiting to meet him later that same day and make plans to fulfill the prophecy.
Thank you guys for waiting so patiently for this chapter. It was a bit tricky to write, which was partially why it took a bit longer than the others. But, I like how it turned out, and I hope you guys find it worth the wait!
"The thought crossed my mind," Malfoy said as he closed another loop of the dais. "But I'm not sure how much that would help."
It was a quick hiss in his ear and then both the voice and wind were gone.
"It was easy to hate you," Draco explained. "The possibility of...of loving you or anything like that...it's fucking terrifying."
Susan hardly touched her food as she listened to Potter talk. But, eventually, the story and her questions ran out, and she turned to other matters. "Are you heading out for Gryffindor's tomb immediately in the morning?"
"So," Harry said as Malfoy paced in front of the archway yet again. "You just have to cum on a dais in there?"
"Have you tried to since the mark appeared on your arm?"
"Calm down," Harry said. "This is not
Draco blinked away the spots from his eyes and he peered around. Susan had been right about the prodigies entering some sort of enchanted mirage realm. Around them was miles and miles of sand, only sand. No Sphinx. No pyramids of Giza. No Cairo.
But luckily, Potter didn't press the matter. Draco had absolutely no intentions of
The steaming water on his back seemed to loosen the tension just slightly, but it was enough to bring down a barrier. He began to sob, holding his hand over his mouth to stifle the sound and praying that the rushing water would be enough to cover any sound that escaped his fingers.
Susan huffed. "Look, I just know what's been told to me, which is what Hufflepuff herself was told. Slytherin couldn't tell her the pyramid's location because it's literally impossible to find unless you're meant to find it."
As the bikes passed them, headed further into the city, Harry gasped, and he felt Malfoy go rigid next to him.
Malfoy shook his head again, and tears formed quickly in his eyes. "It's not the topic exactly," he said softly. "It's my anxiety. It's just the stress and worry over everything that's happened in the past few days building up all at once. I feel the urge to cut sometimes when it gets this bad, but I've been good about not doing it for a few years now. I just put pressure on my wrist to do something with my hands and quell the urge."
"Anyways," Susan continued. "Every time the prophecy is retold, a record of it appears on a shelf we have downstairs. When the next pair of prodigies has been marked, meaning one of them has heard the prophecy to activate it, our orb record shatters. We've been on the lookout for you two since it shattered a few weeks ago, making frequent trips to town because we know you can't Apparate. We must have missed you at the airport earlier this week."
"I know," Potter moaned, covering his face with his hands. He sighed and looked up quickly. "We'll just...we just have to hope there's a wizarding post office in Cairo. We'll send an owl, and I'm sure he'll help."
Draco shrugged and turned back to the cauldron to stir their hot chocolate. Steam was starting to rise, so he knew it was almost ready. "Possibly," he said as he added a dash of cinnamon. "And it's possible Gryffindor was also obsessed with ancient civilizations. I think that's where the Mayan Empire was located. They were pretty revolutionary and did brave things, I'm guessing. Plus, their temples and such were built in the jungles there."
Harry Potter sat in his office, the torches in the room casting long shadows over his desk and burning low as it neared midnight. Still his quill scratched across the parchment before him. The essays from his second years on how to produce a proper Shield Charm had to be graded before the morning. He had already left them a week late as his stress had mounted in the previous fortnight.
He frowned and sat up a bit straighter. Even as he watched, the last sliver of the sun and its diluted rays suddenly shone a rich emerald green. It spread peridot fingers across the sky, quickly darkening to emerald too and then black. Then the sun was gone, and it was as dark as if it were midnight.
"The first two tests are the same for everyone, but the third test is self-aware. That chamber adjusts itself to test the prodigy by offering something the prodigy wants but adamantly denies himself or herself out of pride, fear, or another emotion."
He showered quickly, being extra careful not to tug on the chain and present an opportunity for Malfoy like he had had. Granted, Harry thought, maybe it wouldn't be such a terrible thing for Malfoy to see. But he didn't jerk on the chain and was soon stepping out of the shower with a towel wrapped around his waist.
When they stepped over the threshold, the archway sealed itself behind them and the banshee opened her mouth. The shriek that came from her was magnified by the chamber's stone walls.
Another pub patron walked by Draco on his way to the bathroom. His face twisted into a look of disgust, and he hurried on. Draco set the vial aside. The man had undoubtedly mistook him for a vampire, and with how thin and pale he was nowadays, he could hardly blame him. Playing with blood while in the middle of a dining establishment was only the tipping point for such an assumption.
Draco knew he was only delaying the inevitable. If the only way to find the pyramid and get them out of the desert alive was to confess his feelings for Potter, he would have to do it. That didn't mean he had to be happy about it. He still didn't want to form any attachments. And once again, he reminded himself that Potter. Was. Straight. But, so...what secret did Potter have to divulge to satisfy Slytherin? Because Slytherin had definitely said "secrets." Plural. And Draco couldn't think of another for himself that would mean anything to Slytherin or carry a similar weight.
Malfoy sneered. "Ha. Ha. You know, I hope Gryffindor has a personal task for you too when we get there. Maybe he'll have you throw yourself down a gorge and save me the trouble."
After amassing an armload of clothes to try on, he followed Potter to the changing rooms. Potter's stack of clothes was significantly smaller as he claimed he already had most of the Muggle clothes he would need for the trip and was just picking up extra t-shirts and some shorts.
"But-"
"Oh," he said. He shook himself mentally and nodded, trying to keep his expression blank. "Didn't know it could do that. That's a good thing to know, I guess." He took another drink of water. "So, you, uh, got the potion made?"
"Well...according to legend, this cloak was given to Ignotus Peverell by Death himself," Potter explained, buttoning his bag shut again. "He used it to escape Death for a long time until he finally took off the cloak to join Death. I guess the legend has something to it if we used it to fool a different version of Death."
me to. The challenge was just...a nudge, I guess, for both of us. But, if you feel ashamed of what we did or even hate that I touched you like that, I'm sorry. I'm especially sorry if you feel I took advantage of you."
Yes, they were sharing one room. According to the front desk clerk downstairs, tourist season was at its peak, and everyone wanted rooms with a view of Giza. So, the hotel was very limited on space. Much to Draco's great relief, the room had two beds. He flushed just to think about sharing a bed with Potter.
Potter's hand didn't even miss a beat, and he kissed his neck. "Yes, if. If you want that at a later time, I will look forward to drawing new sounds from you."
He knew it had been brought on by the accident on the bus. Or maybe it had started with the scars on Malfoy's wrist. He wasn't sure, but either way, it was infuriating. He found himself
like Devil's Snare."
The figure of Thoth stepped down from its short dais and stalked toward him. The beak of the ibis snapped - either in warning or challenge, Draco wasn't sure.
Malfoy pressed his lips together in a thin line and narrowed his eyes. The man's expression was wiped a moment later though as the bus gave a terrible lurch forward and he braced himself with a hand against the wall to keep his chair from tipping over.
Draco thought it was strange enough that apparently a group of past Hufflepuffs had formed something akin to a Muggle motorcycle gang right in the heart of Egypt. But, now, he was so taken aback by seeing one of his former classmates that he wasn't even paying attention to what Susan was saying at first.
Slytherin closed his eyes momentarily as if trying to compose himself before he lashed out. He slowly turned to Potter. "Godric and I had not spoken in years when he was fatally wounded in an act of heroism, or rather stupidity. By the time I learned of his condition, I was too late. I have regretted it ever since." He turned back to Draco. "But do not blame me for the trouble of the prophecy. I did not make it. No one intentionally writes prophecies. They come unbidden to seers."
Susan nodded and looked back up. "Right. That's what I need to explain. Voldemort knew about it because this prophecy has been retold, or reassigned, to different pairs of Gryffindors and Slytherins over the last five hundred or so years. Word gets around in certain circles, but it's largely still considered a legend or we'd have people banging down our front door all the time."
us?" Draco glared at her. "Last I checked, you guys were protectors, not-"
"Hear what?"
Draco spun back around to glare at him. "Don't compare me to Weasley."
Draco did not like this answer, though he had been prepared for it since their meeting with Susan. It just felt different now that he knew they were stuck in the desert, contained by an enchantment they could only escape by either finding Slytherin or dying.
The world re-materialized an instant later, and Draco found himself standing in what appeared to be a chamber hewn from beige stone. Nearly a dozen motorbikes identical to the ones in town were lined up against one wall. Picnic tables were set up around an empty fire pit in the center of the room. Along the back room were cabinets, cupboards, and a sink.
Harry's eyes snapped open as his heart gave a sharp jolt. He looked around wildly. Slowly, he came to realize he was safe, years and miles away from those images of Voldemort.
"Nope."
Thank you guys for all the lovely comments on this story so far. Also, did no one catch my tiny Hamilton reference in the last chapter?
"No," Draco snapped.
Susan's gaze fell to the table, and she gave a jerky nod. "I read that about the horcruxes in that tell-all book Hermione Granger wrote last year. Voldemort did come looking for more of Slytherin's possessions during the first war. That's...that's why my family was killed back then. They were all part of this group, and they refused to help him find the pyramid. He slaughtered everyone who was here, and the group only still exists because a few members were in hiding abroad. We're far smaller than we used to be. My whole family has been a part of this group for generations. I could only become a member after I was of age, so I came here right after the battle at Hogwarts."
Strong arms enveloped him and pulled him flush against Potter's chest. Potter had torn back the curtain and climbed fully clothed into the shower, sneakers and all.
Draco thought about it for a moment. "Maybe he chose to be buried somewhere he admired? I mean, the Ancient Egyptian wizards were known for their architecture, potion advancements, and, of course, clever spells put on tombs to prevent grave robbers." He paused and then closed his eyes in frustration. "I bet anything," he said, opening his eyes again to glare at Potter as if it was his fault for his revelation, "that Slytherin modeled his tomb after their example. It would be like him to devise a set of traps and puzzles you have to be cunning to get past."
But, he found himself give pause when he made to move some potion vials out of the way. They were from the night they had been handcuffed together and stayed up late brewing them for the trip into the desert. And one of them was a Sleeping Draught.
Draco locked the door behind the man and then slumped down to sit on the bench in the changing room. He could still feel Potter's hands near his waist and rising up to just under his chin. And then he could see that devilish smile that was a bit mocking of Draco's lack of Muggle knowledge and also a bit genuine.
Potter narrowed his eyes. "What do you mean? Of course, I can Apparate."
"You mean our chances of survival depend on a stone triangle deciding it wants to be seen?!" Draco hissed.
When he had figured out the prophecy had connected him to Potter, it had been a blow. He had done his best to cast aside those lingering schoolboy feelings. He thought they were long-buried. He was already wary that the contents of the prophecy and the fact he and Potter had been paired together was some type of strange twisted matchmaking. Of course, he wouldn't allow that to happen. Neither would Potter obviously. He knew he was reading too much into it and that his anxiety was likely unfounded. They were enemies now being forced to work together.
Draco suddenly found the emerald dagger sliding toward him across the floor from where Potter had kicked it. He grabbed it with his uninjured hand and staggered to his feet.
This question had the desired effect at first. Malfoy blushed scarlet and opened and closed his mouth several times, evidently at a loss for words. Then he swallowed, and Harry was disgusted with himself when he saw sadness cloud the blond's eyes. Malfoy gave a jerky nod. "Right. Well...right. Let's just get the showers over with."
"Why? This one isn't a riddle. It's straightforward with what you have to do."
Malfoy shook his head, and the color in his cheeks became even more pronounced. "The test was only passed because it was consensual like the snake said. I wanted you to touch me. I just..." He swallowed thickly and closed his eyes. He was now pressing his thumbnail hard into the skin of his wrist.
"Excuse me," Susan mumbled and left their table to join the group by the bikes. They all crowded around her, obviously eager for news about them.
Malfoy was shaking his head. "I can't do this again."
Right away, Harry knew this couldn't be the great Salazar Slytherin. Obviously, from the decorations in the burial chamber, which included many silver silk draperies that had been embroidered with hundreds of intricate emerald snakes, it was Slytherin's final resting place, but that stumbling structure of bones was not the founder. And then Harry recalled what Susan had told them about the tomb.
In the center of the room was a wide plinth just large enough to hold what Harry could only assume was a coffin. But, it didn't look like any coffin Harry had ever seen. It was made entirely of glass, and it was filled with white smoke. As the smoke swirled and shifted inside, it allowed for glimpses of a tightly bandaged body within.
"What else is hidden in Slytherin's tomb besides his body?" Potter asked sharply. "If someone wanted to rob it..." He swallowed. "Did Voldemort ever try to rob it? He was obsessed with the founders and their heirlooms. He made a horcrux from Slytherin's locket."
"Merlin's beard, you're worse than Ron when it comes to being stubborn."
Draco shivered and drew his hand down his cock from base to tip and back again. Was that true, he wondered. Or was Potter just making up things for the sake of this task?
Harry smiled, enjoying this picture of a completely relaxed Malfoy asleep in bed with him. He carefully reached up to brush some stray blond hairs away from the man's face. And then, caught by a sudden urge, he tipped his head a bit to plant a single soft kiss to Malfoy's forehead.
"I never could have imagined having these feelings for you," Potter continued. "But over the last few days, I've felt these feelings stirring, and I wasn't sure what to do about them. But Slytherin kind of took away my choice to remain quiet about them."
Potter frowned. "About the same amount of land to work with as we had with Slytherin's. Do you think Gryffindor's tomb migrates too?"
"I can't remember," Draco mumbled, though now that Potter brought it up, he was almost sure they hadn't since Draco had stormed off to the pyramid before giving them any time to eat breakfast.
But Potter's footsteps did not retreat out the flap of the tent to make the fire. Rather, they drew closer, and a prickling sensation ran down Draco's spine. Before he could turn over or say something to stop the other man from doing whatever it was he thought he was going to do, the covers were pulled away, exposing his back to the chilly morning air. It was short-lived though as Potter slid into the bed and tucked the covers back around them both.
"You look like you saw a ghost," Potter said, concern knitting his eyebrows together. Then he seemed to realize the state of the fire and began coaxing it back to life to resume cooking their sausages and potatoes.
"This." Harry pulled a length of silvery fabric from inside his bag, shook it out, and tossed it over them both. He pulled Malfoy down so they were both crouching by the wall, the Invisibility Cloak now successfully hiding their feet as well. As long as the Anubis statue wasn't enchanted with seeing powers akin to those of Mad-Eye Moody's magical eye, then he and Malfoy should have successfully vanished from the room.
"I drift through the other realm while the tomb is unoccupied and wake in this form whenever there are prodigies attempting the tests." The skeleton adjusted the white linen wrap around his waist as he stood again.
But what did it matter? If he had feelings for Malfoy, he would just ignore them. He was sure that if Malfoy was experiencing anything akin to his own thoughts and feelings, that they would actually agree on something for once: they could not act on such emotions. They had a job to do. Plus, there was too much bad blood between them from years of tormenting each other. They couldn't simply erase that.
"You don't have a point! This prophecy is trying to mend the past and the future. Don't you think it a little odd that you suddenly have feelings for me now that we're tied up in a prophecy about love between Gryffindor and Slytherin? We heal the rift between them to fix the past, and then the prophecy forces us to fall in love to bring the houses together for the future. Don't you get that?"
"Right," Draco said. "So, you need to pack? Can you meet me in one hour? We can take the Knight Bus to London. I think we should pick up some supplies and money before heading to Egypt."
He set the pensieve in the middle of the desk and picked up the vial. His heart was hammering. He didn't want to hear what the prophecy said, even though he knew from their matching marks that he was already tied tightly into the prophecy regardless of how much he resisted. But, in his experience, prophecies meant danger and running around the country trying to find horcruxes and almost dying more times than he could count. As he tipped Narcissa's memory into the pensieve, his own memory flared with warning as a flash of Trelawney's prophecy rung in his head from that day five years ago in Dumbledore's office.
