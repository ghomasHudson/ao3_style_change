"Why did you decide to become an Auror?" Malfoy asked when he had finished, genuine curiosity and interest shown on his face. Harry told his tale, too. About how he didn't know what else to be, what else to do with his life. About how he felt like he owed society a debt. About how he didn't think he had the skills or talent for anything else, and that it was what people expected of him. Malfoy listened the entire time, nodding and frowning at parts of the story, never taking his eyes off Harry. It felt so
By 2006, Draco was a best-selling author of muggle children’s fiction, living in Muggle France. In truth, he mostly wrote about magic, because he had learned that muggles loved the idea of magic even though many didn't believe in it. His novels were published under a different name.
"Please, don't stop on my account." Malfoy said, motioning gracefully to one of the chairs in front of McGonagall's desk. For reasons Harry could not even comprehend, he found himself moving to the chair like a child who had just been told to go and stand in the naughty corner.
"No chance." Harry murmured against the back of Draco's neck. "We didn't finish our conversation last night. You... distracted me."
Harry beamed. He and Hagrid made their way out into the field beyond Hagrid's house, and sure enough, a group of regular-sized, winged horses bucked and played. They were beautiful. Harry approached one and gained it's trust before climbing onto its back. "That ones named Mini," Hagrid said. "She's the smallest of the bunch."
“Can’t remember the last time I read a muggle book,” Neville admitted as the three of them slid into a booth at the Broomsticks. “What’s the one your students are reading, now?”
It was no longer just a threat. Draco really was losing Shea. He was losing him and there would be nothing left to lean on. Not with Harry still being so committed to his 'stable' life. The skipping of his heart accelerated. He felt like it would beat right out of his chest. Bracing himself for what was to come. Silent tears dangerously close to breaking past his eyelashes. "Do you want me to move out?" he whispered, unconfident in the stability of his full voice. Several fears clenched his stomach at once, ranging from losing his ability to see Scorpius whenever he wanted to the loneliness of truly having no one again. He felt like he was going to be sick.
Draco was sure that red stain upon his record was going to prevent him from winning the upcoming custody battle. He was terrified he would never be able to hold his own son again.
As terrified as he was, Harry couldn't help but to feel a momentary twinge of excitement for what the next week might bring.
Once Macmillan inevitably approached him, all Draco had to do was lay on some flirting and he was in.
Most people would argue that eleven months was more than enough time to process a relationship he had chosen to walk away from. And, rationally, Draco would be inclined to believe the same…if he had even bothered to try the processing bit.
"Never been more sure of something in my life," Theo whispered, almost afraid to say it any louder. Almost afraid if he did…he might wake up from this obvious dream. "There's a bar down in the parlor. What can I get for you?"
His alabaster cheeks filling with blood, Draco recoiled and scanned the words again. "You told me writing them down would help," he started, pulling in another long breath. The oxygen around him felt thin which was a sure sign he was on the edge of cracking. Minutes away from a breakdown or a panic attack or full, complete shutdown. "It hasn't helped. I write them down and then they're…they're
True to his word, Harry did eat a healthy helping of wontons — but only after Draco admitted he was stuffed and pushed them in his direction with a good-spirited smirk. Although he was close to bursting himself, Harry put them away like it was nothing to keep the joke alive.
He was moving on, and it was about damn time. He'd discovered Potter had already done so over five months ago, which had only set Draco backwards in his own recovery. However, the time for wallowing and moping about was over. It was time to try again.
For a moment, Malfoy regarded him in stale silence. He was far too adept at diminishing a person's confidence beneath a simple gaze. But when he did finally answer, he seemed to hold no contempt for the curiosity. "Technically, Father did nothing, since he was never convicted. But my aunt is very proud of…," he faltered, a comforting sign towards his own unease. He swallowed, betrayed by the bobbing of his Adam's apple, and rushed to say, "Of nearly killing an innocent young couple."
Potter did the same, waiting for the signal. "My boyfriend used to, all the time…." He winked, and Draco's heart dropped into his stomach, effectively sobering him up just enough. "But, I'll admit, it has been a while since anyone did."
"This isn't going to help anything," Harry hiss-whispered to Draco. For privacy's sake, they had decided to conduct the interview up in the Malfoys' residential space above. Seated in the same recliner he'd occupied almost a week before, Harry found a semblance of comfort in the familiar surroundings. Draco had set out a tray of tea — kept under stasis at the perfect drinkable temperature — and mini lemon tarts on the coffee table. The windows were open, allowing the gentle summer breeze to fill the sitting room. Draco had crafted a perfectly comfortable setting and promised to stay throughout the entire interview. Even still, Harry was in danger of sweating through his t-shirt both from nerves and agitation. "I can't do this."
"Plagued?" When Malfoy sat up, he looked weary even past the situation at hand or the muscle ache from their romp. The longer Harry assessed him, the worse off he appeared. There were bags beneath his eyes which couldn't possibly be fixed by just one night of sleep. Ill-fitting clothing aside, he wore his body like it was too heavy. And Harry had done this to him.
Except, as Harry walked (read: burst) through the front door to the Equality Centre, he found himself desperately holding out hope for that yes. For the confirmation of a when and not an if. For a resolution to this whole damn thing so he could stop feeling so damn anxious any time a thought a Draco flitted through his head. He wanted it over. He wanted to start over.
Narcissa walked away at that. She gave up with a frustrated shriek and Harry couldn't help but to feel like they might have won at least for the moment. He chuckled under his breath, sinking down cross-legged into the mattress.
Draco was nearly an exact clone of his father Lucius, the unforgiving man draped in a plush armchair. They had the same platinum shade of blond hair and both wore it long and tied back. Their faces were equally angled and equally set in a hybrid expression of smugness and the nose wrinkle of someone who might have stepped in dog shit. Most of all, however, they were both extremely attractive. In comparison, Narcissa looked almost bland, which should have been impossible.
The familiar weight of anxiety lingered heavily in Draco's limbs, but he was used to carrying it now. He was a master at hiding the nerves after years of practice. An outsider would never be able to see through the calm façade he'd crafted. They would see his impeccable set of dress robes, his confident stature, every single detail of him perfectly in its place.
"What are you doing?" Harry asked, sounding like he might very well faint any moment. Especially since all of the blood in his body seemed to have rushed right back towards his prick. There was no way Draco wasn't going to notice how affected he was with his tenting shorts and gaping mouth.
Obviously, he had known things were going to change. People were going to be looking at him differently, which was sort of the point. He had figured they paid him extra attention already, but he hadn't really thought about what this type of attention would feel like. But once he did, he just couldn't focus on anything else.
Even though it felt like an invisible clock was ticking in Draco's chest, he gave himself permission to enjoy this. It wasn't ever going to happen again, so he might as well get as much out of it as he could. He intended to map out every inch of this man's body with both fingertip and tongue. He intended to be able to remember every single centimeter during those lonely nights to come.
The look on Draco's face spoke louder than any explanation ever could. It broke Harry's heart clean in two, his thoughts instantly on the worst case scenario. "He's dead…," he whispered. Then shouted, without regard for who heard him, "He's dead, isn't he? What have you
What Harry wanted deep down in a part of himself he rarely acknowledged was to run away. He wanted to do what Draco did – run and never look back. He wanted to start over and remake himself away from expectant eyes. He wanted to live in a happy little blissful world surround by nothing but love. Doing a job he loved and living a life he could be satisfied in.
Harry was hastily pulling on a dress shirt, making a noise of frustration when he realized he'd mismatched his buttons. "Sounds nice," he muttered, thinking something entirely different. Thinking that he still wasn't sure that he trusted the Muggle man with his child. And also thinking that he really didn't have much of a choice otherwise. "Help him with whatever he needs today, okay? I'm going to give him your colored pencils. Every chore earns you back another one. Got it?"
"Thank you," Draco said gruffly, all but tearing his arm away. He needed to harden himself. He needed to be that image he presented to the world – cold and aloof. It was that personification that would get him through this harrowing process. It was that personification that could avenge Teddy's assault.
Not that he wasn't feeling proper guilty about it even still. His hand shook as he pulled the knocker, rapping it perhaps a little too roughly. Creating the absolute worst impression and setting himself off on the wrong foot entirely.
As much as Draco wanted to be upset, he just couldn't manage it. The boy missed him; that was for certain. But Draco had missed him, as well. Every time he was away, he came back desperately starved of this child's shining face. The face that was currently in the midst of a full, rashy breakout. "Oh, Scorpius, my sensitive prince…. Who's left you all on your own to play in the grass?"
wasn't certain about keeping it…. But after all this," she rushed to add, even though Harry hadn't made a move to interject, "family seems too important to give it up."
— Draco!" on a groan dripping with reckless abandon, matched so perfectly with the protest of the mattress springs and the slamming of the bedframe against the wall.
"Perfect!" Astoria pushed up on her toes to quickly kiss Malfoy on the cheek before making for the door. "Be back in a shake!"
Draco smiled softly and bit back yet another yawn. "Just for a bit, Mother." He cradled the back of her head as he kissed her cheek goodbye.
Still hesitant, Teddy gave the barest of smiles. He descended the stairs, rubbing at his eyes with a stream of soft yawns. Every bit of extra energy exerted only managed to exacerbate his exhaustion.
to do with this man. But all of it seemed so trivial. Dropping to his knees right there to show how he really felt definitely wasn't appropriate. Neither was making any sort of rash decision on their future without consulting Teddy first. They'd been through so much. They still had so much to go through. These unanswered questions hanging between them only added to the problem.
Draco froze, halting his steps towards the couch. He kept his eyes trained to the floor. There was a new scratch in the hard wood — or was it even new? Had he just never noticed it before? He dragged the toe of his boot along its jagged path and breathed in —
Malfoy nodded, as well, and quickly pulled his hand back to his chest. For just a moment, he cradled it tenderly in his other hand before he seemed to remember himself. "I've realized I should have warned you of all this before you agreed to our original contract." He cleared his throat, jutting his chin up into the air once more. Looking much more like himself — haughty and aloof. Harry felt mildly comforted for some reason at the sight. "If you stay through the rest of the week, I promise to double what I've offered for payment. Does this comfort you?"
With a shrug, Harry sunk further into the pillows. Despite their relaxing day of lazing and relaxing, he looked as if he was worn absolutely thin. "Try not to let the dogs loose, this time, will you? Last time I had to chase them halfway to the next village."
The brunt of his well-deserved punishment and discomfort floated through the open master bedroom window. The noises were…vivid, to say the least. Harry was moaning and groaning and swearing on half-breaths. There was a swiftly-growing pit of jealousy in Draco's stomach. Harry was muttering his thanks to the gods and begging for more. He was mewling and grunting his praise. His voice was as Draco had never heard it – so vulnerable and soft. So broken. A mess of pieces he had never witnessed.
Since overindulgence hadn't worked, Draco had settled instead for merely not sleeping. It was easier.
Draco snorted, secretly proud that they couldn't break him of this favorite phrase. "Fuck, yes. Daddy's tired. Daddy did…a lot of work this weekend…."
Not a single one of the Malfoys looked like they enjoyed fun. Nor was this likely their idea of fun, which was likely why Malfoy was doing this. He seemed the type to enjoy torturing people…. Even the ones he might love.
"Two," Harry said quickly and practically slammed himself back into his seat. "Only two. Are you going to tell me how many you've slept with? To quiet
Harry heard the furious clacking of heels long before the rapping on the bedroom door. He heard the fury in every move Narcissa made and every word she breathed. Every foul thing she called them. Every demand and every threat.
Neither of them spoke right away when Harry sat down. Beneath the table, his knee bounced up and down, and above the table, his hands rung together. He was nervous and he was out of his element. Finally, he had to break the silence, interrupting Draco's steady pour from the kettle mid-drip. "I was honestly just trying to help. I didn't know she would come out and tell me something like this."
Draco's pout softened into a nearly-shy smile, his fingers gently untangling from strands of Harry's hair. Below Harry, he shifted his position on the desk so their hips could take a reprieve from one another's proximity. The absence of Draco's obvious interest almost felt like a betrayal, but it really was for the best.
A bomb made of flour and icing sugar had detonated in their kitchen. Every surface was peppered with white and practically every dish was dirty. In the middle of it all stood pale, white Draco covered in that same carnage. He looked more spectral than usual. The first time Harry had witnessed this display? It was admittedly adorable. This time? The hundredth or thousandth time? Harry was rightfully scared. Or worried. Was there an emotion that fell somewhere in the middle?
A strangling silence overtook them for several long minutes. These were sensitive waters they were treading. It was dangerous and something thick like water was clogging their lungs and their windpipes. Filling their limbs and tongues with lead and making it nearly impossible to do or say anything.
In the dark, Draco couldn't be entirely certain but he thought he saw a blush take over Potter's olive complexion. This made him smile wider. Potter shuffled on his feet and turned to look around the club. Fully taking everything and everyone in. Unashamed. "It's a good place to lose yourself, isn't it?"
More than anything in the world, Harry had hoped this was going to be a good day. They happened occasionally. Very rarely did they happen when he was around, these days. It had, however, been quite some time since she forgot him completely. That stung. It brought a pain he couldn't quite keep from his face.
." Potter looked around him quickly before ducking down and spitting out a mouthful into a napkin. He surveyed once more to be sure no one had seen him, flushing just barely pink in the cheeks. "They really should be ashamed of themselves with that."
There was the barest hint of a smile – or maybe a smirk? – at the corner of Draco's lip. To his left was a porcelain cup, seemingly untouched. He pushed it just barely towards Harry, tapping at the rim with a shiny, manicured nail. "Dry cappuccinos should have no milk – only foam. A dry foam. Large, airy bubbles as opposed to the velvety ones you might find in a latte. They should be light as the only weight in the cup should come from the espresso. What you made me seven times that day was an extremely frothy latte. Honestly, do you even drink coffee?"
Deacon Bates had said the words "you see" thirty-seven times in the span of an hour. For this alone, Harry was certain he hated the man.
. No sex involved. Sounds like he just wants to piss off his parents or something. I suppose it's a bit insulting that I'm right for that job…but honestly, I thought we could really use the money."
But there was something else in his eyes Harry couldn't quite identify. Something that softened the judgement just a tinge.
at someone. "Yes…but I think you're taking it to an even more personal level than should be normal."
"I'll be gentle," Potter promised, taking the permission and running with it. He gently pushed Theo back towards the pillows. Theo followed the suggestion willingly, lying back and allowing Potter to tower over him. Allowing that weight over him and relaxing into the vulnerability it brought. "Do you have a preference on your position?"
of a daughter to. Honestly, I'm just…so comforted to know Draco and I are in this together. I can't imagine a life with someone else who might have been in line with my parents' way of thinking. I can't imagine how miserable a life like that might be.
Two totally different people somehow finding one another and falling madly in love. In other words, a fucking fairytale come true.
' to anyone who dared to come close. It was more of a blatantly obvious haunted house than anything out of even the most twisted Disney princess movie.
"You know, I think I made a mistake," Harry sighed while resolutely taking a step away. "You opened your mouth and ruined your entire appeal. It's just sad, really, how easily you fucked it all up."
Harry's guilt felt comfortable that morning. The puffiness around his eyes and the ache in his tired bones felt quite right. And he was rather determined to stay tucked between the covers for the duration of the day, lost in the memory of the insults he'd thrown.
. So he really couldn't be blamed for the giggle or the way he relaxed back into this man. Or…for the kiss. If they could call it that. It was easier than referring to it as 'the sloppy way Draco pressed his gin-soaked lips to the corner of Potter's unsuspecting mouth'.
There was a terrible fear clawing at them both. A terrible fear that this may be the end. This may be what killed them.
side of the bed for the next few nights. "Mind if I make a phone call?" he asked while making his way towards it.
He was sure he at least knew it began two years ago. The war had just ended and since fighting was all Harry knew, he found himself lost in a world which suddenly wanted him to finally be happy and normal. He was still with Ginny back then, mostly because she was all he knew. She felt safe and comfortable. But she wasn't the one and he was glad she had been the one to realise it for him. He never would have let her go otherwise.
What the Patrol officers found in their apartment, however, made it highly unlikely that he would be walking away.
Malfoy stopped beside his wife and Harry noted they were wearing matching pairs of loafers. "And it's my birthday. Thought that warranted a quieter evening."
Somewhere behind him in the yard came a heavy sigh. "He's not on his own, Draco. I'm watching him. Already noticed the hives. He's had some allergy medicine – he should be fine in a few minutes." Astoria shuffled through the grass, coming to rest right behind Draco's head. She leaned into his direct eye-line, the absolute definition of steamed. He was willing to bet she hadn't slept well since he left. "You don't have to pretend like he doesn't get properly parented while you're away."
"But…apparently Teddy has enough werewolf in him to put out a scent. And…apparently Bill found that he couldn't help himself…."
Clearing his throat, Draco finished more solemnly, "In short, my arrangement is a question, Potter." He lifted his chin, attempting to portray a far braver face than he felt. It took every ounce of his strength not to avert his eyes from that imploring sea of crystalline green. "A question which requires a very simple answer. I'll respect whichever one you give.
"No," Malfoy repeated, protest seeming to be his only logical response in the moment. "But keep explaining and maybe eventually it will."
On the surface, of course Harry was happy to have bumped into Draco Malfoy again. He felt giddy with anticipation for the next morning. He felt ready to move on.
something he just barely had and absolutely cherished. The anger undoubtedly coming from Harry once he heard the noise they were making and busted in. Losing Harry for real and for good if things went as badly as they could. And where would that leave Draco? The weight of death again heavy on his hands. Alone. Most assuredly isolating himself and making terrible choices. Again.
Compared to what they had just discussed, this other matter now seemed completely trivial. It was almost enough to make Harry laugh. If it weren't completely inappropriate, he may have even dared a small smile. "I've been asked to take a case."
"He's just some rich prick," Harry said, relaxing back and throwing his feet up in violent contrast to her ram-straight posture. "Draco Malfoy is his name." Hermione halted her steps abruptly. "
that was the root of it. Of all of it. Draco didn't need to fess up to Cheryl in order for her to tell him what he already knew. Not when he could feel those perfectly matched tumors nestled deep in his chest already. Not when he had already been carrying the weight of them since he was merely a boy.
With a sigh, Draco stopped outside of the Emergency Wing door. As much as he didn't want to obey that request, he knew he was in no place to deny Harry something like that. His world was shifting and changing around him and he was helpless to stop it. The most Draco could probably offer in support was to let him have a moment with his guilty husband. Maybe he could get at least a few answers to the millions of questions that must be plaguing his mind. "I'll wait here. He needs to come with us when you're done."
"That's not what I meant," Ron mumbled, almost tucking himself down into his dinner as he shoveled it into his mouth. The tips of his ears were bright red; Harry had surely embarrassed him. It was just too easy and too satisfying. "Just forget it…."
Harry flushed deep red down his neck and up to the tips of his ears. He found it difficult to meet Draco's eyes any longer and forced an amused noise from his throat. "N-no," Harry sputtered. "No. My maidenhood remains firmly intact; you have nothing to worry about."
After an hour's wait and several pressing memos, they were walking out with a name. It wasn't much, but it was something to go off of. It was much more than Harry had expected to get. And it was something they could definitely launch from.
There was the hint of a tell in Draco's eyes. He was holding Harry's gaze, but not quite meeting it. There was an unmistakable shadow over his vision. Like he was trying too hard to keep in a secret. It was a look Harry knew well. It was the face he had memorized right before the man had left him for good. And the same one he wore every single time he had left since. "You just don't want to see it," Harry said softly, carrying the notes of a revelation. "This is why you brought me in. Your past won't allow you to see this. It's too close to
For a long few minutes, the only sound came from Scorpius munching happily on his dinner. He was none the wiser to his family falling apart. What Draco wouldn't give to be the boy in that instant. Young and innocent and surrounded by nothing but pure warmth. Oblivious to any chaos.
As if reading his mind, Draco curled up into Harry's side and continued to whisper those sweet nothings. "You know, I've literally dreamt about doing all of this with you since I was thirteen." Harry could feel him grinning against his ribcage. "Back then, I suppose my imagination didn't quite include such vivid imagery as deep throating that thick cock of yours, but I did know I wanted you to scream my name like that. I wanted you to want me enough to…to want all of that. At the very least, I knew I wanted this." He gestured to the haphazard way they'd laid themselves out across the foot of the mattress, Harry more off than on and Draco cradling up to him like a child desperate for warmth. "I wanted someone who wanted me, no matter how messy I might be at that moment. And I wanted that someone to be you." He chuckled, sadness creeping in and tainting the warmth of it.
"We still haven't found his killer," Draco said softly, shoving his hands in his pockets. "We won't stop until we have. Shouldn't you want that?"
Guilt slid into Harry's belly before he was even sure what the feeling was meant to encompass. He opened his mouth to defend himself, but found that he simply didn't know how. He held so many secrets out of a desperate need to keep his pride at least partially intact, that he couldn't remember what he might have lied about. So, in the end, all he could do was lower his gaze shamefully to the table.
"Mine, too," Harry reluctantly admitted, the alcohol bringing about a courage he wasn't sure he still possessed.
"I have literally never said that!" Harry said brashly, rushing back into the bedroom. Behind him, the violently flung door crashed back into the wall and there was no hiding the situation. "That doesn't even sound like something I would say," he tittered nervously.
Harry laughed before he could catch it, which he quickly tried to turn into a cough. "That's not why I'm here..." Astoria raised an eyebrow. "Can I sit?" She pulled a face, looked him over, then rolled her eyes again before gesturing to a chair across from her. "Thanks." Harry sat as delicately as he could, just perched on the edge. "I just wanted to talk to you."
The only reason Theo had known that was because of that damn code. Draco wouldn't snitch even if he was caught. Despite the distance between them these last few years, Theo was still a friend and he would protect him for as long as necessary. Even if that meant going to prison for him. It didn't seem fair or right, but it was what it was.
Harry had been instructed to let Draco do the talking. To let him try and smooth things over. After all, Draco knew Deacon best. He knew what angle to play, if there was one needed. But he was itching to say something to defend himself. He was itching to tell Deacon off and let him know just where he could shove his 'mercy'.
"Draco wasn't always the person you ended up with. You know that better than anyone, I suppose..." Harry smiled faintly at this and nodded. He had witnessed the worst side of Draco Malfoy more times than anyone, he was sure. "Draco is filled with violence, Potter. And if you've not seen that in the years you two have been together..." She trailed off, throat bobbing as she swallowed hard. "Then I'm glad things have changed."
Once he gave himself permission, Draco found the words fumbling past his lips. All too eager to be heard. "You know that little trail you loved back in Chico? The one that's hidden in the trees in Bidwell Park? You called it your fairy path once…. You scratched our initials into the stone that hides it. It's your place…. It's
Harry nodded slowly, once again feeling dangerously close to breaking the rules. Feeling dangerously close to acting on the need to comfort. The need to cross the distance between them and kiss away Draco's frown. The need to make Draco forget his scars for just a moment. The need to make him feel worthy and
Draco doesn't move his gaze. "Really?" he asks, sounding disbelieving. "You seemed to think otherwise earlier."
Astoria studies him for a long moment. "I met Matthew in 2001," she says. "I was in a bookshop in Exeter, and we both reached for the same book at the same time." She looks away, a small smile gracing her face. "We had a coffee together and by the end of the week, I was hopelessly in love."
"You're getting rather defensive," Ron says, and Harry narrows his eyes. Ron grins. "All right," he says, "I'll stop winding you up. Got to go. See you at the Mad Alchemist later?"
And Draco, he lived. A miracle. A war. Him and Harry at the heart of it. Him in hiding, a coward; Harry brave, walking towards his death unarmed and unafraid.
"I am unable to comment on the matter. All I can say is that Mr Malfoy requested legal counsel regarding hindering prosecution, and agreed to an appointment. The appointment was not kept and I have had no further communication with Mr Malfoy." Zeisel neatly smoothes a crease in the sleeve of her robe and stands up. "I'm afraid I have an appointment with a client now, Mr Potter, but if you require any additional information please contact my secretary for an appointment."
. It seems strange to imagine. Of course his friends will be desperately worried and he'll have to visit them at once — a pang of guilt echoes in Harry's heart — and he'll have to explain his absence to his annoyed supervisors, and deal with curious colleagues —
"Past Truro. I wanted to see where the land ended. I drove to Helston and parked at the lighthouse."
“If they were too weak to fight, they were too weak to produce this spell. They would have been strong, healthy, their mind clear,” Harry said.
He wakes up as they're driving along some side road in the middle of nowhere. He blinks and slowly draws himself back to wakefulness, watching the fields rush past.
Harry looks down at the Double Decker in his hand and considers putting it back. Then again — if Draco's telling the truth — there's bits of insect in every chocolate.
He places his hands on the steering wheel — one hand on each of the faintly worn patches where Draco so often rested his own hands — and drives.
"Well, you haven't yet ruled out that he left of his own accord. Maybe he wanted to do something and didn't want to hurt his family."
"Hullo," he says. The girl studies him a moment, then takes a bite of strawberry before uttering a messy "ullo" in return and toddling out of sight.
Harry enters the memory again. This time — having gotten an outline of the entire incident — he focuses on tiny details instead. It feels strange to do so, but he walks straight up to Malfoy, eyes narrowed, checking for anything noticeable. He’s wearing a white button-up shirt beneath the robes, Harry notices, and neatly-pressed grey trousers. Was he expecting to go somewhere requiring formal business wear? The robes are good quality but ordinary; robes that any wealthy wizard might choose to wear to run errands.
"Oh, there's all sorts of charms. And if worst comes to worst, you can always Obliviate a Muggle if they've seen something they shouldn't," Astoria says, arriving with a bowl of roasted chestnuts.
"Ask me a question, then." Ron pauses. "Or maybe I should be asking you a question." He points the toffee wrapper at Harry. "You and Malfoy. You've got this weird thing going on."
”Here?” Harry asks with surprise, looking around. They’ve stopped along a dark, narrow road, lined with snow-touched fields. Harry glances at Draco uncertainly, then opens the door and steps out. The icy night air bites him hard, and he shivers. He doesn’t remember this place. Why would Draco choose here for their annual Christmas Eve trip?
Harry had conceded defeat and owled Narcissa, asking permission to fix the car and — once he received an affirmative — had booked the car for a mechanic.
He could always find him in the Great Hall. At the Ravenclaw table, Draco guessed, but no. Harry was at the Gryffindor table. He had been there for three days now. Draco wondered if he would stay there now, always. But that had been Before the war, and everything was different now. Time always seemed to be marked by that now. It was either Before or After.
"Is this...for work?" Hermione asks after a long moment. "Harry...you know the potion doesn't work like that. It doesn't miraculously give you all the answers, it just offers paths to the best possible outcome. And the side-effects can be very dangerous..."
He thanks Astoria for talking to him, telling him everything that happened. She offers tea; he declines.
That line had waited at the top of his parchment for several days now. He hated lying. He dipped his quill and wrote.
Astoria sets the cup of tea in front of Harry, then moves to sit opposite him. "You must have made quite an impression. Narcissa seems to trust you, and she does not trust readily."
And Merlin help him, he's so stuck in the memory that he repeats the first thing that comes to mind.
Harry doesn't respond. He accepts the plastic keycard from Narcissa and the car unlocks itself. Muggle technology is amazing, Harry thinks. 'Waste of money', indeed. No doubt Draco considered it one of his finest investments.
Ron stands up abruptly and starts pacing. "I don't like the sound of this. Malfoy's playing mind games with Harry?"
The apartment is cold. Now that September is truly underway, the last of the summer warmth is quickly dissipating. Harry unlocks the door and pauses before he steps into the apartment. White walls, floorboards, empty counters. A room stripped bare. There's nothing here. With a pang of sadness, Harry remembers the trailing roses of Astoria's garden, the smell of sugary pastries baking in the oven, the crackling music of the Wizarding Wireless. It's been a while since he visited Astoria and Matthew.
"It's not supposed to be. I have no idea what I'm doing, you have no idea what you're doing either." Harry shrugs. "Doesn't matter."
, he'd told Hermione. Not Draco, who was unbearably stubborn — he'd tried for an entire year to fix that damn Vanishing Cabinet, and even when the stupid prat had been pointing a wand at Dumbledore, hand shaking, a look of complete terror in his eyes, he still hadn't admitted he couldn't complete Voldemort's task. Harry remembers that split second before the Death Eaters arrived, when Draco began to lower his wand as Dumbledore offered a different path.
Later on, when they're leaving — Harry driving, Draco poring over the road atlas — Harry thanks him.
No doubt the errand Draco had planned to complete after purchasing the owl. Nevertheless, it might be worth asking the solicitor about the purpose of Draco's visit, if the solicitor can recall it.
Harry flushes guiltily, thinking how the argument had reminded him of their schoolyard rivalry. He'd been quick to feel defensive and take every remark as an insult. Now that he analyses the entire argument, he thinks that he would have interpreted Draco's comment about Neville as a harmless joke or even a playful jest had Ron or Hermione said it.
Harry tries to distract himself with his other cases. Two weeks after Draco woke and returned to the manor, Harry closes his ninth case, the Staffordshire witch. In just a few more weeks, his time with the Investigative Division will end.
Harry takes a long sip of the whiskey, savouring the sweet honeyed taste. No; this is what happened last time. Second-guessing himself — dismissing the dreams and memories — and believing Draco had committed suicide.
“Not who you were expecting, eh?” Ron glanced up at Draco's expression. “Listen, I'm sorry about Hermione. She just — she gets a little impatient sometimes.” Ron watched as Draco raked a hand through wild hair, the strands catching on his silver ring. The same ring Harry had given him so many years ago, a token of love and forgiveness. “I thought I should pop in and see if you were alright. Well, obviously you're not alright, but — ”
"Okay," Ron says, in tones that imply Harry's started ranting about Wrackspurts and Gnargles. "You do that."
He needs a memory from Narcissa, he knows it. He's been patient, but she's not telling. How do you extract a memory from someone who doesn't want to give it?
“Alright, Neville?” Harry moved over as Neville entered the compartment, having chatted to Professor McGonagall about his Head Boy duties.
“Don’t be silly, Ron, you need to practise the Imperturbable Charm, and that requires a lot of wandwork,” Hermione said, and Ron groaned. As he cautiously hinted about using his time to laze around and ‘recover’ instead (much to Hermione’s firm objecting), Harry walked along silently, listening.
The first day of December. London is still shrouded in morning fog when Harry arrives at the Ministry and goes to his office, unlocking the door and removing his mittens and scarf. Just as he sits down at the desk, a file comes flapping wildly into the office and nearly strikes him over the head. Harry frowns at it. Any files sent the previous day, after Harry's already left, tend to hang about in the hallways until he arrives in the morning.
Harry pulls a face at him, draws his wand, and mutters a navigation spell. “There. Near the goalpost.”
Draco knew he trembled all the time. He stared down at his fingers, at his wrist, trying to still them with his mind alone. As though his thoughts would course through his blood, spill into tissue, spread into muscle, soothing them.
"Yeah, well, that's why the Law Enforcement foot-soldiers gave it to us." Ron shrugs. "Pearson's working on a map at the moment, hopefully we'll see some patterns."
There was a long silence. Ron gave up trying to spoon her and lay on his back, staring at the ceiling. He glanced over at Hermione and saw her eyes open, catching the thin light of the moon through their curtains.
They reach the car and Harry takes the passenger side, Draco the driver's side. The engine thrums to life, the tyres crunch over the gravel.
They arrive in Brighton. Harry, sick of transfiguring items into toothbrushes and combs, goes to the nearest chemist. Draco, despite his familiarity with cars and petrol stations, seems fascinated with the many items available and Harry has to drag him away from the bottles of cough syrup.
This time, Astoria speaks. “How could you? I was worried sick! I was a complete mess when Draco disappeared, and you
The words are quickly crossed out. A draft of a letter, Harry realises, for just beneath it, Draco attempts a second approach.
Harry opens the driver's side door and gets in. Now that he's driven a car, he reacts automatically, his hands instinctively reaching to rest on the steering wheel, his feet finding the brake and accelerator, his eyes flicking to the rearview mirror.
She stares blankly at him. There’s a glazed look on her face and Harry recognises it instantly. He slowly sets his mug of tea aside and leans forward.
Harry opens the door to the underground parking. It's a bright and sunny afternoon, the weather delightfully mild, and most of the residents have already left, off to enjoy a lazy Saturday with family or friends. The car park is nearly empty.
"—I'll be out of town on a research expedition. But, yes, you're absolutely correct." Luna paused for a single second to pull in a quick breath of air. "I should leave you to do this on your own. How are you supposed to properly find yourself whilst stifled by someone else's set expectations? Not that I have those for you, Harry dearest. All I want is for you to love whoever it is you are deep down in that mushy little heart of yours." Luna squealed, practically in Harry's ear, and twirled out of his arms back towards the water.
"That's all you wanted?" Potter questioned. His head tilting to the side, he smiled softly. "From what? From this?" To accentuate what 'this' was, he plunged his hands up Theo's shirt. Caressing his flushed skin and teasing a light scrape of his nails over his nipples.
"I was hungry, so I went out for something to eat. Ran into an old friend…" Harry trailed off, desperately trying to hold back a small smile. "I didn't realise how late it was when I offered to walk him home. My Apparition License was suspended, so I had no choice but to try and make it on foot."
Yep, all feelings of intimacy were successfully gone. Harry rolled his eyes. "Just tell me what you want, Malfoy. Word for word. I can't both be creative and defensive towards your family and brainless and complicit with you. It's not something I can easily turn off."
"Oh, shit," she giggled, tripping over her own feet as she attempted to wrangle her heels off. She then proceeded to hush herself, falling back against the door.
But when he found that exact man nursing a forgotten pint at his own favorite pub…how was he supposed to resist trying?
After an embarrassing moment of fumbling, he finally managed to locate his round frames and mash them onto his face. With the clarity came understanding, accompanied by a wan smile.
"That is his name, Hermione," Harry chuckled, even while a weird sense of shame slid over him. After one last hesitant moment, he handed over the article.
"Time's up," Draco said just as Harry popped the last button on his shorts, letting them drape slackly across his hips. Draco grinned lasciviously, surging across the mattress and capturing Harry in a breath-stealing kiss. That feeling of wholeness returned, lingering between them as Draco teased Harry's shorts the rest of the way off his hips and put them in a matched state of undress.
Draco couldn't think of a more pathetic way to be spending Valentine's Day than suffering through a blind date. Okay, perhaps there were worse ways — spending it alone, fist-deep in a box of discount chocolates, for one — but for Draco, this was an all-time low. Especially after coming so close to having something real and permanent the year before.
Sitting as far across the table from Harry as possible, Draco reached into the center and poked the bubble covering one of the dishes. It dissipated with a flashy billow of smoke, filling the room with the butteriness of hot water crust pastry. "I'm not fighting. Not really. The only fighting I plan to do is for you, I suppose…." Again, if he had been sober, such corny words would never have come out of his mouth. "Pie and mash from Broadway Market."
"I figured as much," Harry sighed as he sat down on the edge of the stage. "Ron's advice was to ignore that you even said anything."
It took every ounce of concentration Draco had at that point not to sneer back at him. He calmly reached for his glass, sipped the last bit of liquid, and stood. Calm as those dangerous moments before a storm.
It was going to happen. It was bound to. The boundaries were only there to be broken. They were fooling themselves to think otherwise. But not like this.
The sensory overload brought him to a drinking overload. Which brought him to make a really terrible decision. Which ended up with him lying alone in a stranger's bed draped in nothing more than a stained sheet.
. He was perfect for Harry Potter right down to his squeezably thick center. But they never had the chance to try and be anything but new. They never had the chance to discover what a happy ending might be for the two of them.
Obeying the command, Harry took the seat across from Draco. He extended his hand with a shaky smile, once again feeling as if he'd just walked into a job interview. "Harry Potter," he stated, doing his best to smile through every other invading thought.
It just felt like everybody knew. The woman at the corner store who complimented his sunshiny yellow hair. The kid on the sidewalk who wouldn't stop staring. And now Harry who kept asking him questions about his life.
Even without being able to see it, Draco knew Potter was grinning. His smile had a way of charging a room. "What position?" he asked gently, pulling out all but one finger. With that one, he continued to push in and out, back and forth. Keeping him pliable and mapping his cavity.
"I should tell you what I'm going to do," he muttered to the happy couple in the photo. "You'd probably tell me not to go." They merely continued to smile, laughing at some secret joke. Between them, arms looped around their necks, was a man with an even bigger grin. The photo was taken on his parents' wedding day. Before he was even a thought in their minds. Back when they were young and carefree. Back before the man in the middle – their best man and Harry's godfather – started the chain of events that dismantled their good luck and easy lives. "Then again…I'm sure you'd tell me to go for it. You guys never were afraid of anything."
Nodding slowly, Harry stood from his chair. He was making his way to the door without even thinking about it. "Just…give me a minute, please. I need to speak with Draco before I fully agree. Excuse me." He blew a hasty puff of smoke, stubbing his cigarette out on the back of the door.
The Slytherins shared a look before shrugging in a way that very much said it was a risk they were willing to take.
." Groaning, Harry lifted his head to meet Ron's embarrassment full-on. "I know I've said you can tell me anything, but I lied. Okay? You've put enough filthy images of Malfoy in my head and I would like you to shut up now."
Sirius didn't give the appearance of believing him. There was that same skeptical look he gave every time Remus said he was fine. Which was why they were having breakfast outside this morning in the thick mist coming off the lake. James and Peter had Arithmacy class, making it just the two of them. Sirius said they could use some fresh air, but their clothes were soaked and Remus felt that might be doing more harm than good. "You're not eating," Sirius intoned gently, picking at his own toast.
Shea's response was shocked, at first. Like he was surprised Draco would trust him with such a task. But he quickly recovered and pulled a demure frown. "You want me to find out what's wrong with the boy?"
Potter shifted so his left hand now cradled the back of Draco's head and his right was fully free. He pressed his middle and pointer fingers to Draco's bottom lip, willing him to open further. Draco greedily accepted the digits onto his tongue, laving them in all the moisture he could spare. "
Unfazed, Malfoy turned with the newly refreshed tray and walked right past Harry. "We still have a lot to go over," he said in that hurried and impatient voice. "You have to learn how we met and what our inside jokes are." He sat back down, flipping through more pages of his legal pad. "Do you sleep in pyjamas or in the nude? I just want to be prepared…."
When Harry closed his eyes, all he could see was liquid silver boring into every part of him. Draco's eyes and the way they glazed when he was vulnerable. The small things that made him fall in love in the first place. The velvet of his voice when it was just them and they could be real with one another. The instant feeling of protection he had in the middle of who-knows-where just from the body securely wrapped around him.
"Do burglars usually announce they've arrived?" he chuckled awkwardly, looking again towards the empty kitchen. "It is Wednesday, isn't it?"
"Lily and James Potter…. My mother's name is Narcissa. You will also be meeting her sister, Bellatrix. She's married to Rodolphus Lestrange. There's another sister that we don't talk about. Therefore, I want us to try and bring her up in conversation as much as possible." Malfoy looked up at Harry, a flicker of some kind of warmness passing over his features. "Andromeda Tonks is her name."
"Uh…." He shook his head to clear it. "Why? Should I be scared? That someone might try to kill me? That someone might try to rob me? I assure you, there's nothing in this house I wouldn't mind losing. Myself included. The only thing someone could take from me that would bring me pain…is my freedom." Theo ambitiously followed his gut and carded fingers through Potter's unruly hair. "And no one can take that from me unless I let them."
The only thing stopping him was the still-lingering tingle of Draco's lips upon his own within the last hour.
This was written for a challenge in the DRARRY: fanfiction and fanart Facebook group - a less than 500 word piece based on the given picture. The picture is a bed with rumpled white sheets.
Draco was at his side, instantly proving himself the better person by rubbing Harry's back and ensuring that everything was alright. He had always been so skilled at consoling and comforting, at providing Harry with the warmth he couldn't remember feeling as a child. He'd never been anything but honest and good to Harry.
As far as first kisses went, it could have been more romantic. But Harry had made his decision and he had to live with it. A notion which certainly felt easier once Draco went noticeably less stiff beneath him, his hands settling just so on Harry's hips.
"It's a lot to handle," Draco supplied. That was the most massive understatement Harry had ever heard. It was almost enough to bring the giggles back around. "You're absolutely filthy, Potter, and not in the way I usually like you. Why don't you go have a bath. I'll put the kettle on so we can have tea and a chat when you've finished."
It wasn't a miracle but it certainly was a relief when Harry changed the subject to Cannons' stats. James stayed at the back of Teddy's mind for the rest of his visit. Rationally, he knew the boy was out shopping with Ginny as the Potter children always were on this day of the week during summer holiday, but he couldn't help but to check the doorway every few minutes. Hoping for a selfish glimpse. Dying to steal a secret kiss and withering away on the inside every single time he remembered how often he'd be lying about all this in the coming future.
to think otherwise. What he had in the past was just that. And it needed to stay there. As much as he had loved the last few days with Draco in his little escape world…. This was his home. And he couldn't leave that. He couldn't leave this man. Someone who cared about him and their child so unconditionally….
What he didn't love was how unsurprised she appeared to be at his bit of "news". Harry sighed heavily and pulled his knees up to his chest, resting his head upon his folded arms. "Right. Let me guess, you already knew I was gay? You knew it all along, just like everybody else apparently did. Am I really that much of a ponce? Like, do I have a lisp I was unaware of? Or do I walk…different?"
The black behind Harry's lids darkened further, if that were possible. Like all connection to the world was suddenly and violently severed. He had no idea what he stumbled back into, but it felt solid and he embraced that. Everything else was spinning and the reassurance of it was grounding.
The symbolism of that action wasn't lost on him. He was right back to where he had been a month ago — so ashamed and worrisome. Shutting everyone out because he was afraid. Hiding a part of himself away from the world because he couldn't handle the rejection. He hadn't changed one bit, not really. For a time, he had been able to handle it all because he had been able to control it. But, when it was once again out of his hands, he reverted back into the same shell of a person he had been before.
As much as he wanted to explode with all of the information he'd learned today, he couldn't. It was classified. He had signed a magical-binding contract stating as such.
A sly grin affixed to his lips, Theo settled onto the mattress. Potter looked down at him with a hard heat in his eyes. "I, uh…." He cleared his throat and suddenly the heat was gone. His eyes were fixed on the floor now and he looked shaky. A complete switch from the sure and heavy kissing just a moment ago. "I think…I need something more to drink... To be able to do this, I mean. If you want to do this, that is…."
Harry hadn't known. He had just assumed if a child had magic, they were considered a wizard. With a frown, he looked over at Draco. It was a perfectly valid reason. There would be no need to question his intentions there. Maybe they had the wrong man….
Deacon sat back in his chair, fingers steepled before him. Considering Harry's demand. More than likely considering shooting him down, if the rest of their afternoon was any indication. "You see, Mr. Potter-"
He could stay and explain himself. This would certainly be the most embarrassing option. Especially since he would have to be out with his whole plan to accost Draco at the door with a kiss…
The rest of the room was filled with Quidditch memorabilia, strewn clothing, used dishes, old textbooks, and empty Ogden's bottles. It was as if he had only allowed himself to exist in this one room for two years and never bothered to clean up after himself. It should have been revolting. Draco found it oddly charming.
"Good. Great. Proud of you, man," Ron babbled off, forcing a smile as the kids from the corner of the store made their way to the front. "Have a good day, boys!" Once the door closed behind them, he added, "Little sticky-fingered gits."
Biting back a grin, Harry took the same hint and swallowed the rest of his words. Storing them for finish later. "He does talk too much, doesn't he?"
Harry sighed heavily, watching Draco stomp up the stairs from the bottom landing. Shea, Teddy, and Scorpius were all standing behind him. Watching him with those same prying eyes as everyone at MACUSA. Watching him pine after Draco like some sort of lovesick teenager. Two of them were people he'd never want to see him like this. Not now. Not with the way things were. Snapping to for a brief moment, Harry put on a fake smile. "We just had a rough day," he explained, only giving a half-lie. A lie of omission.
which absolutely broke Harry into a thousand tiny pieces — all Harry could manage for a time was to sit on the edge of his bed. He lost track of how long he stayed there, staring at the spot where Draco used to lay, his mind churning everything over and over — every laugh, every touch, every strange word choice. Once he started, he found he couldn't make it stop. He dissected the last month with intense precision, trying to figure out the clues he'd missed.
". Seeing as Draco would have readily shagged Potter literally anywhere, he was sure it would do. He stepped along the forged path, pulling himself up onto the high bed with (he hoped) pure grace. This body was bulkier than his own and wasn't as used to careful, lithe gestures. Were he in his own skin, he would drape himself back across the pillows. He would poise himself in a gentle curve dripping with seduction. He would be irresistible, an invitation to be ravaged splayed across his silent lips.
Harry had been reluctant to do anything with the information he had obtained. He sat in his and Draco's destroyed apartment all night, too restless and conflicted to sleep. But by the time the morning rolled around, he saw no other way. This place felt empty without Draco. It always would. And the longer he dragged this out, the uglier that absence was going to feel.
Throughout the night, Harry found himself doing that a lot — cracking jokes or just acting silly in order to make Draco laugh. Every time he smiled, it felt like Harry was winning at some weird game. It felt like he was repaying the stillness Draco had granted him. Like something was healing, not just between them but also within each of them. Or at least within him.
But it still felt extremely off-kilter to know things were once so different between him and Draco. That he once would have been revolted at even the thought of consoling his once rival. But there they sat, and that was their reality.
In complete juxtaposition to the slow way he was now milking out his own orgasm, Potter grasped Draco's cock almost harshly. He stroked him quick and hard, his pinky skimming his bollocks at purposeful intervals. It was clear in the hungry look in his eyes that he wanted this man to come suddenly and violently. He drank in every moan, every lip bite, every filthy word like it gave him life. His hips moved so soft and slow, his fingers squeezed so tight and rough.
It didn't take much weighing for Harry to make his decision. Too self-aware of his shortcomings at the moment, he found his feet carrying him to the edge of the bed almost without a second thought. He pulled off his socks, using the few seconds it took to think over what he was about to do. What it could mean for his future or the future of the relationship he had built with Draco. It could mean nothing, after all they were just sleeping beside one another. Or it could mean everything, especially if Harry woke in the bright and sober morning with a desire for more — and most especially if he actually decided to finally take that more from Draco.
A hint of a smile crossed the woman's lips. "Number three," she said gently, even hazarding to reach over and gently squeeze Draco's arm. Showing that little bit of awkward support in the absence of really knowing what to say.
It had now been four years since that rushed fuck that changed everything. Four years since the collapse of Draco's life as he had come to know it. Four years since he'd confessed what had happened to Shea, tears and snot dripping down his face. Four years since he was sure that was the end. Four years since the man merely laughed and took him back home. Four years since the most understanding person his life tried (and unfortunately failed) to put Draco Malfoy back together again.
So slowly it was almost painful, Harry raised his eyes to meet Charlie's sea of calming blue. He couldn't help the smile pulling at his lips in response. He couldn't help but to feel safe and content. All of the warring fears and desires inside his head washing away like a receding tide.
For a brief instance, Harry felt Draco's hands nearly pull away from his. "What does that mean?" he snapped, that patience wearing thin enough to show his former self beneath it. Which satisfied Harry much more than he would ever admit to.
"Then I'm going to go ahead and clear up that erumpent in the room." Draco didn't drink from his own cup, he merely stirred it with a teaspoon. Every few seconds, the metal clinked against the side and jarred them back into the present. It was oddly grounding. "What all did Astoria tell you? I want to fill in the gaps."
As he did any morning, Draco cringed away from the shrill voice that insisted on the same damn greeting every single day. And always with the same, grating enthusiasm. "Ms. Shelton," he said through gritted teeth, stepping off the lift and into the office he'd come to think of as home. Of sorts.
The words sounded awkward on his tongue. James was still so young. There was no way he could have known what it was he really asked for the night before. And Teddy should have known better. Teddy was the adult, as much as he still felt like a teenager himself in times like these. With his palms sweating and his pulse racing. With the anxiety eating him from the inside out while his most basic desires demanded he simply take what he craved.
He didn't have to convey if Scorpius appreciated the present. His excited squeal did the job. The button could be heard being pressed again and again for five minutes straight. Each time the train whistled, the boy would shriek and laugh before yelling out the door, "Can you hear it, Harry?" Except 'Harry' always came out closer to 'Howie'. Draco said he had trouble with his r's.
"Draco's brought a guest," Narcissa explained as she lowered herself delicately onto a backless chaise. Never once had Harry thought a piece of furniture could be an accessory, but there was no way to deny the way this choice of seating accentuated her perfect poise and posture.
Sundays were Draco's days with Scorpius. They were his only days and he was only allowed to have them on his ex-wife's front step. Rain, snow, or shine.
go ahead and finish dressing. She shuffled off awkwardly with a gracious smile, promising again that she'd only take a minute. In her absence, Harry fell onto the edge of the sofa and puzzled over what she'd said. Sure, he'd missed a couple of their weekly dinners, first because of the Sparks meeting and the second for a rescheduled class at St Mungo's. Which he'd had to do because of another Equality Centre related event…. And, yes, they were the first dinners he'd cancelled on since they'd begun them a few years ago. But it still didn't make sense for his friends to assume he was done with them altogether. These nights still meant something special to him, even if he had been too busy for them recently.
Harry walked himself down to Charing Cross Road fully sure he was capable of handling the Sparks meeting alone. But the closer he came, the more dread started to weigh down his footsteps. He'd never considered himself to be a particularly brave person, even though he'd held the unofficial title as the Gryffindor Golden Boy. The way he saw it, that came down to reputation more than skill and was hardly something he had earned. Sure, he'd done some very bold things for the right side of the war. But he'd only been a child and, looking back at it all, he really hadn't been given much of a choice in most of his decisions. Recklessness and a sense of duty weren't exactly the same thing as unabashed courage.
"Shift up a bit," Charlie whispered in Harry's ear as he gave up and let his forehead collide with the man's collarbone. Eager to obey, Harry did just as he was told and settled more weight to his knees. A moment later the pressure agonizingly disappeared from his cock. He made to protest but found the thought strangled when a slick digit breached his hole. He mewled in response and slung his arms around Charlie's neck. He used this leverage to give his husband better access while practically begging him to continue without actually being able to find the words.
They were marching through the entrance, surrounded in plain daylight by hundreds of prying eyes. It felt like every single one of them was searing right through Harry. That mixed with the enervation made for one paranoid cocktail. Like he had no control over himself any longer, Harry's heart quickened again right along with his pace and his breath. "Since you asked me to come here, pissing off my husband, and putting my secure life on the rocks."
Finally, Harry sighed and planted himself squarely in front of Draco. With no idea what he was about to say, he opened his mouth and decided to let it just happen because he truly couldn't stall any longer under that pregnant expectancy. "You do want to, er…. You do want that, right? To…to
While she cleared her throat to fight back tears, Harry pointedly avoided meeting Hermione's gaze. One fucked up night brought them all of this. Life had become something none of them knew how to navigate any longer. Voldemort, Horcruxes, and killing curses all felt like small fires now. Everything before seemed easy in comparison to the way the world order felt now. It all sounded ridiculous running through Harry's head, but he couldn't quiet the invading thoughts. "Things will work themselves out," he tried to reassure, his tone not quite convincing to his own ears.
Just the mention of such a preposterous idea threw Malfoy back into full disbelief. He scoffed, occupying himself with finding his clothes amongst the mess of the floor. "This room is
The focus hopped around the circle to whomever wanted to speak next. And with each person, the crease between Harry's brows grew deeper. Their stories were more tragic than he could have ever imagined.
. Last and most importantly, he settled himself into a barstool at the pub Macmillan frequented with his friends when Potter was unavailable for one reason or another.
, I even find your sickening naïveté endearing. Which I suppose all makes sense…. You're the epitome of everything I wasn't supposed to want.
Harry wasn't proud of what he had done. The slump in his shoulders was absolute proof of that. But if it brought his boyfriend home, he knew he could find a way to live with it. He whispered a quiet 'thank you' to his friend and left her office. His stomach was in knots and there was deep guilt buried in his gut.
"I know." Harry was past angry and into numb. He was in denial and wished very much that he could stay there. He wished he didn't have to be the one to confront his husband about his role in hiding the abuse done to their son. He wished he could run. Take Draco with him and just…
And then Harry looked at him like this and he was vividly reminded of how fleeting of a privilege it was to even have had the time he did.
No longer afforded her blissful ignorance, Narcissa huffed a disgruntled breath and lay down her own cutlery. "This is hardly appropriate dinner conversation, Draco. I am absolutely disappointed in you."
This wasn't how Harry wanted to be seen throughout MACUSA Headquarters. Brittle, eyes rounded, and Draco Malfoy's hand in a potentially compromising position. But Draco wasn't actually leaving him much of a choice. And neither was the unsteady exhaustion hanging in every single one of his muscles. "You're fueling the wrong kind of attention," Harry warned, tempted by but not fully committed to pulling away. "I can manage. I'm not fragile. I won't break. You could let me go. I promise not to faint."
Draco poured all of his concern into Harry's wellbeing to keep himself from doing just that. He instructed the patrol officers with him to take Weasley in. Process him and stick him in an interrogation room until someone was ready to take his statement. Make the sick fuck as uncomfortable as legally possible. "Harry, I need you to take a deep breath," he warned, circling his arms around the man under the guise of side-along apparition. Trying to instill even an ounce of comfort into his shaking limbs.
"Right, yeah…of course," Harry said quickly and grabbed the entire telephone, cradle and all. "Thank you. I'll just…." For lack of a better place for privacy, he silently thanked the universe for the long cord and made for the toilet. With only a small wince of embarrassment, he shut and locked himself within and promptly set the phone down upon the counter.
By some miracle, Potter laughed. "Are you saying I'm the type of person to suck a bloke off in the bathroom without first learning his name?"
When she pushed the door open, it was the most grand and stunning gesture. Effortless but still dramatic enough to draw all attention to her entrance. Or perhaps that was just her natural pull and presence. (All the more reason to hate her….)
"The way the story goes, Andromeda was never comfortable with any of this borderline criminal activity. Mother has admitted — while quite intoxicated, mind you — that her sister had on more than one occasion broken down and pleaded with her to leave the '
How could he not listen when passion laced every breath Harry Potter ever spoke? How could he not want to train his eyes on those lips, memorizing every syllable that passed through them? Even when the words were nothing but drunken babble, they were still laced with everything Amortentia smelled like.
"Fiction novels?!" Ron cried incredulously as Harry recounted the story to him and Hermione over a floo call later that night. "like actual,
“You’ve got dirt on your face, mate.” Harry said as he sat beside the man. Neville grumbled and wiped at his forehead. The two of them ate together and compared notes about their respective houses before making their way to McGonagall’s office.
Harry tried to confront Malfoy that year but he was slippery – he always managed to dodge Harry at the last moment. While Harry’s anger festered, Malfoy had become cold and withdrawn and completely out of Harry’s reach. They had it out in the girls’ bathroom after months of silence and both did things they would regret for the rest of their lives.
The day of the war, Draco and his parents were taken into custody. They were held with the Carrows, who believed them to be cowards and treated them as blood traitors. They were underfed and subjected to dementor attacks.
When fifth year came around, it had been almost a year since he and Malfoy had had a proper conversation. Harry confronted him. They argued about it until Malfoy made Harry laugh, and all was forgotten. They started studying and owling again. That was when it started –
“I take personal offense to that comment, Longbottom.” Malfoy said, humour in his eyes. He sipped his firewhiskey prudently.
Harry held his breath as he moved towards the man, worried that a wrong step might send them both back to the Shrieking Shack, Draco's greying, limp body dying in Harry's arm. He stopped a foot away from the bed. He watched in earnest as Draco's chest rose and fell with steady breaths.
Two months later, Draco told his mother that he was renouncing magic. She wept. Draco returned to England via muggle transport. He put flowers on Vincent Crabbe's grave. He was punched in the face by a stranger at the cemetery who had called him Death Eater scum. Draco believed him – he didn’t fight back. He stayed with his best friend, Pansy Parkinson. He didn’t leave her house for a month.
"Honestly, I didn't sleep last night. Couldn't put it down. Would have probably finished the third one, too, if Quidditch wasn't on." Harry answered honestly. He could have sworn he heard Malfoy breathe a sigh of relief.
“Because I-“ Harry thought about it. “Honestly, I can’t imagine how anyone could really know you and
Robards stood. “Potter, we’ve kept you here all this time because we deemed you as a threat to yourself. The way you carried on. We deliberately kept Mr. Malfoy out of all of your interrogations because of how violently you reacted when the Aurors responded that night. We were unsure of your… relationship, with Mr. Malfoy. We needed to discern whether or not what happened was an accident.”
"It's been a fucking madhouse here since Rose turned three. Terrible twos my arse!" Ron groaned, heading into the kitchen. Harry followed and leant against the counter as Ron worked through a pile of dishes.
Pinky eventually grew impatient with them and shooed them from the kitchens, saying that the house elves needed to prepare for dinner. Malfoy looked at the watch on his wrist and cursed.
In third year, the after-hours Quidditch practiced continued. It wasn’t so secret anymore. They started owling sometimes, too, and Harry would complain about how bad he was at potions. Naturally, he and Malfoy started studying together. They often caught up in the restricted section of the library. Hermione came sometimes, too, and formed her own friendship with Malfoy. The two of them bonded over their mutual love of knowledge, and Harry had beamed.
“Professor, it’s a Saturday. And you aren’t the Slytherin Head of House, so…” A student said, looking at him with disdain.
Harry opened his mouth to scream, but Robards continued: “Mr. Malfoy wasn’t killed, I assure you. He’s… recovering, at St Mungo’s Hospital.”
“I’ve known you for seventeen years," Harry murmured against him, "if that’s not satisfactory, stop making it so fucking difficult for me to get to know you now.” Their lips met again and Harry kissed him until his mouth ached.
Harry incinerated the note on the spot. He was, evidently, very frustrated. It didn’t take long for every glass in the room to be obliterated. As soon as he had thrown the last empty potions vile hard against the floor, all the glasses mended themselves and floated back to the tables in the center of the room. Harry slumped against the wall, feeling defeated. He had checked for all the old secret passages to Hogsmeade the night before, but all the ones he knew of had been destroyed or converted when Hogwarts had been rebuilt. He thought, hard, for another option.
Back at Ron and Hermione's, Harry tucked Draco's unconscious form into the couch, transfigured into a bed, and then turned to face Hermione.
Harry finished that book, too, and was shocked to see the light of the early morning sun shining through his window. He cursed under his breath for having stayed up so late. It was a Saturday, at least, but Gryffindor was versing Ravenclaw today and Harry wouldn’t miss it.
Harry stumbled out of the Ministry, wand finally in hand, and blinked up against the bright sunlight. He apparated straight from the street, already feeling woozy, and was slightly surprised when he landed at the entrance to St Mungo's Hospital without any apparition-induced injury. Harry looked at his dishevelled appearance in the window before stepping inside. He looked like shit, he knew, and cast a quick cleaning spell.
each other. Harry was sure he had memorized every inch of Malfoy’s body, each corner of his mind. He felt like he had him figured out. He was going to tell him that he loved him.
“Not unless you can look me in the eye and tell me honestly that you don’t want your magic back.” Harry was defiant, serious now. He stood, too, facing Draco. Draco glared, and then turned to walk away. Without thinking, Harry reached out and grabbed his arm, stepping towards him. Draco didn’t resist – he turned, and he was so close to Harry that his breath hitched. For a moment, all Harry could do was stare up into his steely grey eyes.
"Writing." Malfoy said. "Since I've been banished from my third floor windowsill, I've been using this view as my inspiration instead." He motioned out across the lake.
“Actually, Potter, I don’t use magic, wand or otherwise.” He replied nonchalantly, as though this was a simple fact of no consequence.
“Mr. Malfoy was seriously injured that night. An old trap was tripped and he was hit with some very old, powerful magic. But I assure you, he isn’t dead.”
From above, Harry could see the glow of a candle against the twilight. Frowning, he used the reins to steer a reluctant Mini to a halt, approaching the flickering light. When he got closer, he saw unmistakeable, silvery hair, glowing in the moonlight.
Understanding seemed to settle across Robards face, his brow furrowing. “Is that what these ridiculous temper tantrums have been about?”
After the war was over, Harry had testified at the Malfoy trials. Malfoy was starved and chained and sobbing on the ground in the Department of Mysteries, and Harry wanted to die. Harry would have fought the Wizengamot if Malfoy hadn’t been pardoned. He was prepared, then, to take down the entire Ministry if it would keep Malfoy alive. He realized he’d never stopped loving him – not really, anyway.
? You can't possibly know that your soulmate will never love you. That's rubbish." Harry was frustrated. Why was Malfoy
"... And it is with great pleasure that I announce the new muggle studies professor." McGonagall said. Harry and Neville returned their attention to her as she continued. "This wizard has lived as a muggle in France for a number of years. Like you all, he attended Hogwarts as a child. He was unable to join us tonight but, regardless, I would like to announce his recruitment to Hogwarts’ excellent teaching team. Please give a round of applause for Professor Draco Malfoy, the new head of Slytherin house."
After that, Harry slept easily, feeling comforted by the warmth of the fire and the completion of Draco's books. He dreamt of dragons and blonde-haired schoolboys.
Harry spent the day in bed and skipped the festivities. Ron and Hermione sent him a wreath of Christmas roses, as they had every year since he and Hermione had first visited his parents' grave in Godrics Hollow. Attached was a picture that Rose had drawn of herself holding his hand, Ron and Hermione beside them, with a messy word that resembled 'family' scrawled on top. He stuck it on his fridge fondly. Ron and Hermione knew not to try to call him today, and he knew it was better that he didn't call them, either. He was a right prick on Halloween and he knew it.
And there he was. Harry almost fell to his knees at the sight of Draco. His pale, unconscious body was clad in a loose hospital gown, hovering slightly over a white bed in what looked like a preservation charm. The room was white and very bright with light, Draco's bed alone in the centre of the room. Everything smelled strongly of disinfectant and powerful healing magic that Harry recognised from his days as an Auror.
“No.” Harry gasped. He stepped forward almost instinctively. He didn’t feel the wire trip until it was too late. A jet of light shot across the room from the side and hit Draco. He crumbled to the ground.
“The Unspeakables warned me before the reversal process. They called it the magical core's last defence, I believe. It’s rare, but it’s powerful and compelling enough that people have changed their minds at the last minute.” He paused. “In those last moments, while the magical core is being taken from it's body, it shows you your soulmate. People have backed out, knowing that removing their core might ruin their chance of ever fulfilling that soul bound.”
Two months passed and Draco had almost forgotten what it felt like to be a human being. He was dragged to his trial, enchanted chains binding his body, and placed in a cage in the centre of the room. Harry Potter and Hermione Granger testified in his favour. The familiarity of their voices made Draco weep with relief.
A fifth year Ravenclaw girl that Harry had forgotten the name of shrugged. "He wasn't in Muggle Studies today. I think he's ill."
“Why’d you renounce magic?” Harry asked, cutting to the chase. The man’s eyes widened slightly, only for a second. He shrugged exaggeratedly and sighed, breaking eye contact.
Neville nudged Harry. He realised he’d been staring and hurriedly took the seat next to Malfoy, his cheeks heating. They waited for a few moments before Madam Hooch entered and took her seat as Ravenclaw Head of House, having replaced Flitwick who retired a while back. She was still in her referee robes – she'd given up on trying to impress McGonagall at these meetings years ago.
Harry stuttered awkwardly. Eventually, Malfoy sighed and opened the door wider, motioning for Harry to enter.
"I know this is hard, Harry, but you have to go." She said, looking between Harry and Draco. Harry felt raw, as though his body had been torn open, so he nodded. He let Hermione take him back to Hogwarts and sat with his back against the wall outside of McGonagall's office while Hermione explained everything to her. He drifted in and out of consciousness. He didn't even remember how he and Hermione had gotten to his quarters, and as soon as he hit the bed, he fell into a deep sleep.
It took two years. Two years without a word from Malfoy, then the man was standing on his doorstep. Malfoy told Harry that he had loved him since they were 15. Harry cried.
Draco stood and started moving away, crossing his arms over his chest. “Drop it.” His voice was growing colder, eyes distant. Harry knew he was hitting a nerve, here.
Back in his room, Harry read the note again and eyed the package suspiciously. He made the executive decision to avoid all things Malfoy to save himself from a repeat of sixth year. Hermione would be proud, honestly. He shoved the package into the bottom of his trunk and tried not to think about it in his struggle to fall asleep.
“How’d you know it was me?” Harry asked. He wasn’t sure if he should stay where he was or sit on the opposite end of the large windowsill. When Malfoy shuffled over slightly, Harry took it as an invitation, and awkwardly took a seat. He swung his legs so that they were dangling from the window and stared ahead.
"Here's all the books I have about magic reversal." She said, taking a seat beside him and cupping her mug.
Back at Hogwarts, Harry went straight to the quarters he knew to be Malfoy's and banged on the hardwood door.
“Look, all we have to do is find your soulmate and get them to put it back, or whatever. How hard can that be?”
Harry half listened to Peter ramble on about his thoughts about werewolves and half watched Malfoy coach Lena through the spell. Harry noticed for the first time that Malfoy wasn’t using a wand – he was demonstrating the motion by hand for Lena to copy.
“Malfoy, I don’t understand. Why put yourself through this? And why not try to fucking do something about it?”
The two of them sat and talked about Malfoy's books more openly than Harry had ever expected. Malfoy told Harry tales of his interactions with muggles at university and how fond he became of muggle literature. He explained that he rented a room for a while in a house with a muggle woman and her young son. He had babysat the boy some nights in exchange for cheaper rent, and the two of them read fiction tales together. He spoke about how he was worried he'd be breaching the Statute of Secrecy when he told tales of magic to the boy, but the Aurors never came, so he figured it was OK in the context of fiction. He'd started writing his series after that and it had gained a following. Harry listened intently, keen to learn as much as he could about the new Malfoy while the man was being so forthcoming.
Malfoy had sent him flowers. Who was this man? Harry found himself asking again. For reasons he couldn't really pinpoint, the gift from Malfoy lifted his spirits.
On Wednesday evening, Harry asked McGonagall for permission to pass through the Hogwarts apparition wards to visit Ron and Hermione. McGonagall had eyed him suspiciously and reluctantly agreed. Harry apparated three times to reach their cottage, not wanting to risk such a long haul in one go.
Harry switched rapidly between feeling numb, and feeling nothing but blinding, indiscriminate rage. He didn’t let himself feel hurt, yet. He needed someone to blame.
Harry hadn’t learned until much later that Malfoy had spent the summer after Fifth Year teach himself occlumency. Voldemort had moved into his house. Malfoy couldn’t risk Voldemort accessing his memories and using their relationship against Harry, so he’d learnt to keep those memories carefully hidden.
Harry started reading. In truth, he was unsure what to expect. The tale followed a boy and his life as a magical child in an ancient castle that was suspiciously like Malfoy Manor. The protagonist felt somewhat familiar to Harry.
Harry clenched his teeth. “How the fuck did you miss it? You swept all the old wizarding buildings in London after the war!”
He followed desperately after the welcome witch as she led him through what felt like a hundred corridors, pushing through doors and stopping at nurses stations to refer to charts.
When the sun was setting, Harry returned to his rooms to change into something warmer. He was surprised to see another package waiting for him in his living room. It was a bouquet of beautiful, elegant death lilies and a huge block of chocolate. There wasn't a note, just a small gift tag that read:
Harry, Ron and Hermione had been interrogated. They were held in different holding cells in the DMLE, and Harry couldn’t hear or see either of his friends throughout their incarceration. The surge of dark magic that night at the Shrieking Shack had triggered an Auror response. It was one of many old, magical buildings that was tracked for that sort of thing. When the Aurors had shown up ready for a fight, Ron and Hermione had tried to reason with them, and Harry had made everything worse. He cursed them, and screamed, and clutched Draco’s lifeless body as they tried to pry him away.
In fourth year, Harry and Malfoy’s friendship faltered for the first time since First Year. Malfoy was openly jealous and cruel about Harry being a Tri-Wizard champion and went out of his way to make Harry’s life miserable. The truth was that losing Malfoy’s friendship had made Harry miserable without the extra taunting. Once, late in the year, Harry had walked in on Malfoy making out with Blaise Zabini in the bathroom. He’d been overcome with a feeling that he later recognized as jealousy.
“That’s not what I’m doing.” Harry said incredulously. Draco turned to face him. His face was tentative, eyes cool.
When the room was quiet, Harry began his search. He cast all the revealing charms he knew to no avail, and everything was just taking
Harry fidgeted restlessly as he waited for the old, brick stairs to slide into place. He threw open the door without knocking – earning him some disgruntled murmurs from the unsuspecting portraits on the wall - and began marching through the office.
"Harry! Harry wake up!" Harry was torn from his slumber. Familiar hands were gripping his shoulders, shaking him awake. He opened his eyes and saw nothing but wiry curls, blinding his vision. He recognised them instantly.
"Didn't want to upset you," Malfoy said easily, humour gleaming in his eyes. "I know how fragile your ego is when it comes to people not accepting your help."
"Please, Harry, you need to trust us. We can't tell you anything about how you die - it's too risky. We know that you're safe at Hogwarts. Once you've gotten Malfoy's magic back, you have to go back there and stay there until we can work out a safe way to involve you." Hermione stood, too. They stared defiantly at each other. Hermione's fierce brown eyes were absolute.
“So am I.” Malfoy’s eyes locked on Harry’s and Harry took the challenge, not breaking the contact. Eventually, after a final glare, Malfoy stood and motioned to the door. “Please, Potter. Get your meddlesome, Gryffindor arse the fuck out of my rooms.”
ill, and Harry briefly forgot why he was there, standing awkwardly in the doorway staring at the man before him.
The Quidditch match was dismal. The air was cold and biting and rain fell sporadically throughout the event. Gryffindor lost to Ravenclaw by almost 200 points after the snitch was caught.
Swollen faced on the floor of Malfoy Manor, Harry searched Malfoy’s face for any trace of the man he thought he knew.
to stop your death from happening. As it turns out, we're soulmates. And-and it's all a bit fucked up, Harry, because if we don't do something, you're going to die. What you need to know is that I love you and I'm going to do everything I can to stop that from happening." His face was serious, resolved.
“That was close.” Malfoy said slyly. Harry raised a questioning eyebrow, but Malfoy only grinned and started heading back to Hogwarts.
On day eleven, Harry couldn't cry anymore. He showered for the first time in a long time. Hermione had been casting cleaning spells over him every morning, but he couldn’t remember the last time he bathed. He spent the rest of the day flying with George, who kept saying he was just going to go for a quick fly with Fred. Harry was worried George was slipping into madness.
When Rose was finally bathed and sitting happily on ground in the living room, reading a picture book, Ron and Hermione joined Harry at the kitchen table. Hermione dropped a stack of books in front of him.
Draco didn't look up but his cheeks heated markedly. His quill stopped writing. "What did you think?"
“I can’t-I can’t be sure.” Malfoy’s eyes were pleading with Harry to run. He’d risked everything. Harry thought for the first time that maybe Malfoy had loved him, too.
Harry awoke to sunlight streaming into his room. His head ached terribly. He cast a tempus charm and was shocked to see that he had been sleeping for 2 days. The memories of restoring Draco’s magic crept into his mind, hazy and distant. And then reality sunk in. Harry leapt to his feet. Hermione and Draco were out there somewhere, plotting to save his life without him, and they had a 48-hour head start. He had seen the Prophecy and he was sure that was enough for him to be helpful. He cast a cleaning spell over himself and dressed quickly in warm clothes. He grabbed the bug-out bag he’d kept since the war – it contained everything he might need if he was to find himself on the run again – and headed for McGonagall’s office.
The weather was better than expected, though, which was a silver lining. The air was bitingly cold and the ground was frosty, but the sun shone in the sky nonetheless. He walked circles around the grounds a few times and then found a place to settle, staring out over the horizon. He looked at the pictures he had of his parents, and of all those who he'd lost during the war. His mind healer had once suggested that he use the day as a day of general mourning, so he did.
“Ah, Professor Potter. If you aren’t too busy snooping behind bookshelves, join us - your expertise will surely be useful.” Malfoy called slyly. Harry heard some of the students’ snicker. He felt his cheeks heat traitorously.
"When I wrote it, I never suspected that an opportunity for you or Granger to read it would ever arise, so I figured my dignity was safe. Please, Potter, don't make this any worse for me than it already is. A great deal of pride was swallowed when I sent you those books." He motioned dramatically.
Harry thanked Hagrid for his candour and reluctantly took one of his rock cakes for the road. He tossed and caught it as he walked slowly back to the castle, thinking. Guilt rippled through his stomach – he’d been unnecessarily rude to Malfoy that first day when he started. The man had saved Harry’s life after all – twice, as Harry recalled. He’d call it even, except he figured the Sectumsempra incident cancelled out the fiendfyre thing. Harry shuddered at the thought. He tried to shake the memories.
“Yeah, but you didn’t have to take it.” Harry realised this was the wrong thing to say as soon as the words left his mouth. He wanted to kick himself as Malfoy slumped slightly, running a hand through his silvery hair.
This one wasn't a memory, Harry realised. It reminded him oddly of a Prophecy. He was standing in the centre of a small, dark room, with a single window. He watched himself stare out of the window. He felt love, like a fire burning in his chest. Over Prophecy Harry's shoulder, he could see his reflection in the glass. He was Draco. And then, Prophecy Harry turned to face him, opening his mouth to speak, and somewhere from the side, a jet of light hit him and he crumbles. Then, Prophecy Harry was in his arms, dying, and he was screaming.
“I met Sirius here for the first time.” Harry said honestly, staring up at the boarded windows of the second floor. Malfoy’s head snapped up.
The three of them talked and joked and drank for hours until Neville yawned and excused himself. Harry looked down at his half-finished drink and wondered whether he should leave, too.
The wait was excruciating, and Harry had nothing to distract himself. He ate three servings of lunch just to give himself something to do and wrote about a dozen angry letters to Ron and Hermione, all of which were ignored. He even managed to get through a stack of grading he’d been putting off. All attempts at socialising with Neville and Hagrid were a bust – apparently, Hagrid was still ‘gone campin’ and Neville was avoiding him like the plague. He played a game of solo wizards chest and watched the hours slip slowly by.
By the end of it, Harry was beaming. Malfoy had changed, but the parts of him that Harry had secretly admired in their schooldays had stayed the same. His ambition, his wit, his general prudency, his intelligence. They'd all passed the tests of time.
Harry had started hanging out with Malfoy in secret in second year. Malfoy was the only seeker at Hogwarts that was a challenge for Harry to beat, and Malfoy felt the same. They would meet at the Quidditch pitch after dark to fly and chase snitches, sometimes all night. They practiced duelling together, too, after Lockhart and Snape pit them against each other in Duelling Club. Looking back now, Harry couldn’t pinpoint the moment when they stopped being nemeses competing and started becoming friends that coached one another.
After some time, they stopped outside a heavy metal door labelled simply with 'The Core'. The small witch turned to them. "You'll have to wait here." The three of them shared a look and nodded, stepping back and allowing the witch to enter. She seemed to seep through the door.
That night, Harry gave up on trying to sleep. After catching up with his grading, he headed for the third-floor corridor – it wasn’t out-of-bounds anymore, of course, but it was seldom-used. He’d taken to it for late-night strolls back when he first started teaching. There was a window in the far corner with a view of the Black Lake and Hogwarts grounds. Sometimes, the moon reflected off the surface of the water, making lights dance around the lake. Harry often sat there when insomnia got the better of him.
"Mr. Malfoy," the witch spoke in a monotone voice, "I hear you wish to retrieve your magic." Harry felt Draco's body tense up beside him as he nodded slowly.
"Furthermore," Hermione continued, "the magical core needs to be held in a particular type of place, or else it fights to go back to the person it came from. Only, if it does make it's way back, it can't reenter them and eventually fizzles out. I've heard rumours that the Department of Mysteries stores them. Once a person has had their core removed, they have to go back for follow up treatments every six months."
Draco turned towards him, Harry's fear reflected on his face. Harry could see his reflection in the window behind Draco, and everything was the wrong way around. It should be Harry in that room by the window, and Draco should be where Harry is.
Over the summer, Malfoy didn’t owl. Harry didn’t either, but he thought about it often. On their first day of Sixth Year, Harry was going to tell him that he loved him. He received an owl:
Harry's spirits were lifted for the rest of the day. He took a nap, did some lesson planning, and ended up wondering to the kitchens at dinner time, too. He told himself that it was because he didn't feel like socialising in the Great Hall.
Two months had passed since the war, and the three of them were asked to testify at Death Eater trials. Shacklebolt had said that their testimonies would swing the verdict. The three of them testified in favour of life sentences in Azkaban at the Carrows, Dolohov, Rookwood and Macnair trials. Hermione and Harry testified in favour of an Azkaban life sentence for Lucius Malfoy, and against imprisonment for Narcissa and Draco Malfoy. Ron declined to speak at the Malfoy trials.
“Worse things have happened.” Malfoy turned his head to face Harry. Harry turned, too. Flecks of snow clung to Malfoy’s eyelashes. His lips were flushed pink from the cold. Harry wanted to reach out and touch them. He turned away, blushing, trying to shake those thoughts.
"I really ought to change my password." McGonagall grumbled, barely looking up at him from the large stack of parchments on her desk. "Professor Malfoy told me you might come asking after him. I'm afraid I can't disclose any confidential information about teaching staff. He's gone away on business. I expect he'll tell you himself if there is something he would like you to know."
And just like that, many many months have passed. My sincerest apologies for taking so long with this chapter. Writer's block and endless uni assignments did me dirty.
The following afternoon, after being berated by numerous second years for his tardiness on returning their essays to them, Harry trudged through the cold to Hagrid’s hut. He found the man sitting by the Black Lake while several thestrals drank from the water.
about Malfoy’s life as a muggle, why he ended up living that way in the first place, and what he’d been up to besides writing fucking books. Harry had tried owling Malfoy once, a few years after the war. The letter had been returned to him a week later – the owl hadn’t been able to find him. He knew the Malfoys had moved away from the Manor in the early days, but he had no idea where they went. He couldn’t imagine Narcissa Malfoy living amongst muggles. Had Malfoy moved out on his own, then?
Harry landed with a thud and Malfoy looked up in surprise. The man was clad in a Slythern scarf, beanie and gloves and a long, fur-lined coat with jeans and gumboots. He was sitting on a plaid picnic blanket, facing the Black Lake, using the light of a single candle and the setting sun to illuminate the parchment in his lap.
“Well, I’ve forgiven you, too. Not that there was really anything to forgive. We were kids and all, and you didn’t really have… Anyway, yeah. Thanks.”
Draco pulled back, only enough to better see into Potter's eyes. He was smiling and Draco could feel him softly chuckling. "I- No. No, I'm just…." He frowned. "What?"
In his irate state, Harry was clearly irrational. The moment he heard the door creak open, he nearly snapped. He nearly reached out to choke the person behind it. Or punch them. Or…hex them if he could manage the spellwork through his fury.
"Charlie…." There was absolutely no surprise in the direction the conversation was taking. Harry had anticipated the fight. It's why he hadn't asked for permission. Not that he should have to…. Despite being married and wanting to respect his husband's wishes, Charlie wasn't his keeper. Harry had his own free-will that he preferred to keep well maintained. "I can't speak about the case. I've signed a binding contract. I can, however, tell you that I did bear Teddy in mind when I made my decision. They do need help and I do seem to be the best candidate. I mean, they were desperate enough for Malfoy to come ask me himself…."
Draco's eyes shone with moisture under the lamplight when he met Harry's, and Harry found that he, too, was near tears. That his heart also felt that sentiment so deeply that he wanted to cry.
Harry let go of the rail, frowning down at his watch. According to the digital glow, they were over ten minutes early. He did roll his eyes this time, making a soft noise of laughter through his nose when he caught Malfoy doing the same.
Draco inhaled deeply before nodding again. "Welcome to the Equality Centre," he drawled, very likely mocking Harry. "How can I be of assistance to the so dearly revered, great and spectacular Harry Boy-and-Man-Who-Lived Potter?" Okay, not just likely — he
"It was sort of a last-minute trip," Harry said to his hands. The truth was right there, ready to come pouring out. After the events of that day, he was honestly ready to let it out and find some sort of comfort. "I, uh…. I came into some money yesterday and thought they could use some of it…."
"What do you know of my depth?" Draco snorted. Harry bit his tongue to keep from biting back his response. Which was certainly not appropriate for public declaration, no matter how boisterously loud their environment was.
"I don't think Bill has forgiven himself. He was in tears when he told me what happened…. He just kept saying he was sorry over and over and over again. And Teddy wouldn't move. He was in shock. So…I thought I would erase it all. I took care of it. I handled it so you would never have to see him like that, Harry. And Bill swore to me it would never happen again. Teddy shouldn't even remember any of it happened."
The only other notable thing Harry left in the small, cramped flat was the ghost of himself. Every crack and corner of Draco's home was filled with the memory of the man he had come to love more than anything he could remember even dreaming for his life. Memories of where he'd sat, where they'd shagged, where they'd sunk to the floor in the kitchen and just…talked about absolutely nothing and everything all at once. Draco couldn't even grab a mug from the cupboard without some wanton thought pushing its way into his mind.
Draco was hesitant to nod, only because he wished he could stay so full for the rest of his life. As cliché as it sounded, they were two puzzle pieces perfectly fitting together. Draco had an emptiness within him. It'd been there so long, he wasn't even sure if he knew what was missing or how to properly fill it now. This here, though? This fullness of Potter inside of him so deep? This was close. This was a substitution for whatever that missing piece might be and he could learn to live with it if given the chance.
But Charlie still didn't deny him then. He pressed a comforting kiss to Harry's temple and gave his answer wordlessly by drawing a fingertip over Harry's prostate. After the stars cleared from his eyes, Harry eagerly took what was his. He awkwardly shimmied Charlie's briefs down and lifted himself a bit higher. On cue, Charlie waved his wand one last time before setting it aside. His newly freed cock was now covered in cold lube. As he settled up against Harry's entrance, the contrast in sensations sent an excited shiver up Harry's spine.
He probably didn't even know his face looked like that. Smug. Angry. An 'I knew it' not all that far off.
Although he didn't appear to agree, Charlie nodded. But he did make sure to add his piece, just in case Harry didn't know. "I still think it was a mistake for you to have gone there in the first place."
James was patient, but there was definitely a sigh waiting just behind his lips when he asked, "Do I really have to come right out and demand to know where you got the money? Did you rob a bank or…or are you standing on dark street corners…? I know you love
Right. Back to business. Harry forced a smile. Unlike her ex-husband, Astoria always spoke with flare and intention. Always punctuating her words with staccatos and sighs. She wasn't making this easy for Harry…. "I was hoping we could talk?" he chanced, smiling in a way he hoped was gentle and not reminiscent of a wince.
The only hope he still had came from the fact that no one had told him Teddy was dead yet. He assumed someone would have said something by now, if that were the case. And healers kept coming and going from the room Harry and Charlie weren't allowed in. There had to be some sort of progress if everyone kept hustling about. That
Despite his best efforts, Harry must have been gawking. Lucius was seated at the head of the table, just to Draco's right. Hischair was even taller and grander than all the others and he wore a particularly satisfied curl to his sneer as he tracked Harry's actions. Figuring this was as good of time as ever to try out his lack of manners, Harry reached for his water glass. He tipped it to his lips, pulling one of the ice chucks into his mouth. Watching Lucius actually and physically wince as he crunched on that ice was one of the most satisfying feelings Harry could ever remember experiencing. It felt like he was crushing the solid idea of luxury to pieces on his molars.
me in my sleep for nearly six-hundred fucking days. This morning was the first time in close to two years that I haven't woken up to the harsh reality that I never had you. What we did…. It must have broken whatever spell Lovegood cast. Bravo for you and your magic
It's a very long hour. Harry tries to work but he can't. The words seems to trickle away like rain. He can't focus. He reads the fifteenth page of the file over and over.
and I," he paused, winking over at Harry and effectively stalling his progress of recovery, "were simply having a discussion, my dear wife. But I think we're settled for now, right?"
He sighed heavily, glancing back. Harry had been dead asleep since he had crept into bed beside him. It had been clear he was upset, too. Somehow he was able to live with what bothered him. Teddy chocked it up to practice.
magical." The words came on a broken sob. The tension in Graham's shoulders snapped as all composure was lost. Right there on the front porch, luckily surrounded by their privacy hedges, he sunk down to his knees and started gasping for air between each hard sob and difficult word. "Ricky doesn't know. I didn't know how to tell him," he sobbed, clutching at his chest. His nails dragging angry red lines into the skin not covered by the opened top buttons of his shirt. "He was mine. Echo was mine. We used
A blush darkened the boy's cheeks. He felt foolish. "I'm sorry….," he whispered. "I just…. I thought…."
The doorbell chimed before Charlie could get out a reply. He managed a soft kiss with an apologetic smile before running out to answer it. Even after these last few years – tough and trying as they were – that kiss still left him breathless.
. They were both laughing, the moving picture stuck in a loop of their happiness. Draco scanned the headline, too aware of the two leaning in for a kiss from the corner of his eye.
After some time, he realized the flaw in his strategy — he wasn't happy. All of his friends and schoolmates fell in and out of love around him, navigating the waters of their adulthood with happiness and heartbreak. And all Harry managed to feel was left out.
"He didn't know the difference between a latte and a cappuccino," Draco said coolly, gracefully falling into the chair behind his desk. His office was minimally decorated with both a Slytherin and a Falmouth Falcons pennant behind him and a few family photos scattered between his desk and the filing cabinet in the corner.
you and Uncle Draco back together?" Teddy asked, peeking over Harry's shoulder at the bold headline of the Evening Prophet from the night previous.
"By Godric, no one has ever made me feel any more deserving of that luxury." Potter took his permission and ran full speed with it. He must have grabbed a bottle of lubricant while Draco was spacing out as he now held it in the hand not currently spreading a bead of pre-cum over Draco's hypersensitive tip. "Just let me know if I'm going too slow or if you need more time to adjust. I just need you to talk to me. Okay?"
Almost like he was in a drunken haze, Harry stood up beside him. Draco's hand was on the small of his back, pinky finger pressing just so between the notches of his spine. Just a small burn of pressure to keep him grounded. Most likely unintentional.
, not 'lesbians', you prat." He practised that measured breathing once again. "I think he said he loved me. Well, he thought I was asleep at the time — and, I dunno, maybe I was — but I'm pretty sure he did actually use that word."
because they had both decided it reached the widest audience. But it had, indeed, been Draco who suggested he do it in the first place. He'd said Harry's celebrity status would help the centre best. Harry had been eager to impress Draco, but he hadn't needed that much convincing. He was
True to his word, Harry showed up at the Equality Centre bright and early the next morning. Even despite the ungodliness of the hour, Draco was already elbows-deep into preparation for the weekly brunch, grinning almost shyly up at Harry as he mixed a bowl of fruit. "Good morning," he said gently after a quick blushing look at where Astoria and two volunteers were prepping more food. "Erm…Harry, could you help me set up tables in the events room?"
He must have noticed Harry staring. Honestly, Ron was a bit more aware of his surroundings than Harry had initially given him credit for. From the outside, he appeared to be all muscle and little brain. A typical clueless guy. But he saw more than people probably realized and he had more heart than he might wish to let on, as he most often masked his genuine feelings with a joke or a jab. "Thanks," Harry muttered in reply, feeling the back of his neck heat up in an obvious show of embarrassment. "But I'm not really interested right now."
A sickening smile curled at McClain's lips, but he didn't meet Draco's eyes. Not out of shame, necessarily, but Draco couldn't quite place another reason why. Maybe he no longer saw them as equals? "That thing should be put down, just like all the others. All the Mudbloods and half-breeds and…." He breathed heavily, raising his hands like he wanted to rake his fingers through his hair in frustration, but found it impossible with the bindings. Slamming his arms back down on the table, he finally leveled his eyes so full of hate back on Draco. Boring into him. "That Guererra atrocity. There was an obvious deformity in that thing's genes. Barely functioning above a Squib's potential and
"I think I'm going to go back to bed," Teddy said slowly, pulling himself out of his chair. "Thanks for the ice cream, Uncle Draco. See you tomorrow."
A strange, unreadable expression flitted across Potter's face. "No. C'mon." He hitched his head towards the door and gave Draco only a second to decide if he was following before turning around and heading out.
boy?" Delphini snarked, looking up at Harry as if he were something gross upon her perfectly shined shoe.
As expected, the alarm tripped the instant he stepped across the threshold. Helpless to do anything but wait, he kicked the door shut to spare his neighbours from the gonging sound and leaned back against the wall in the entranceway.
"Drama, indeed. The boy is teething. Our new neighbors always seem to be at the house, asking questions and trying to make nice. Work has been…. This latest case is a lot to handle. I'm fucking exhausted…." He sighed heavily before letting loose with another deep, guttural noise. "That's it…."
. He took one look at the man watching him across the bar that night and knew there was something familiar within him. He just couldn't particularly match it up to who he was reminded of until he had the man's cock down his throat. Until his name fell out of that mouth like a dirty swear.
And Draco didn't doubt that he would. He was just worried as to how that would happen and where they would be left when it did.
Although he would be hard-pressed to admit it, Draco did actually end up enjoying himself (at least more than expected considering his let down at the beginning). Between himself and Teddy, they managed to effectively char three of their sausages. They were inedible, which left Harry tasked with fixing them something edible. A task he actually seemed slightly proud to take on, steadily holding his roasting stick at the perfect height above the flames.
Before he could process how to hold it back, a sharp noise of amusement blasted out from Harry's own throat. His eyes flicked back and forth between both of them like he was watching a tennis match. Waiting to see who broke first — calm, cool, collected Draco or Rita whose paled complexion now rivalled that of any alabaster Malfoy.
"Yes, Mashed Potato, too," Draco assented, patting the dog gently atop his head — which only further encouraged him to take liberties against his personal space by lunging up and gently nipping at Draco's chin. He did, on some unexpected level, like the dog…but certainly not that much.
For a fleeting moment, Harry considered leaving anyway. Of going to see Draco, even though he'd been avoiding him the last few days, only showing up at the centre when he knew the man would be preoccupied. Although Draco hadn't called any attention to it and it passed by with no consequence, that intimate moment in the office after his interview with Rita Skeeter hung heavy on Harry's heart, clouding his head with what-ifs.
But if this brought Draco home, he could live with that. He could learn to live with just about anything if they could only just be happy once again.
Their relationship had been full of those near-endings. It was inevitable that one of them would eventually stick.
His fingers had just begun to wrap around the base of Draco's cock, freeing him from the constraint of his pants, when he felt Draco's hand mimicking the motion on Harry's body. It was on a plane of euphoria so far beyond anything Harry had ever imagined that he had to stop and blink away stars before he could even think about continuing. "You'll come for me, won't you?" Draco whispered and Harry felt like he could very easily do as he asked right then without so much as a proper touch. He nodded feebly, slamming his forehead into Draco's shoulder, shivering at his sight below.
For only a brief second, Harry looked at Draco with a million more questions in his eyes. Draco would have to answer to every single one of them eventually. But both of them knew that now was not the time. He waved Charlie closer and the man, barely dressed in just a dressing gown, easily picked the boy up in his arms. Held him close to his chest and pressed his forehead to the top of his head. There was the threat of tears welling in his eyes, but he disapparated without a single break in his stone-faced composure.
Harry nodded slowly, but said nothing further. Every time he tried to open his mouth, the words stalled and died in his constricted throat. He felt like he could cry at any moment, but couldn't discern if they were tears of waiting relief or of irrational fear.
He had finally achieved the one thing he had pined after for too many months. But it was all wrong. It wasn't his face, wasn't his body, wasn't his pleasure to experience.
Malfoy merely scoffed and led them up the drive. The gate sat halfway up but by the time they reached it, it was already swinging open for them. The hedges never broke the entire way to the house and the chill down Harry's spine never dissipated. It became especially unbearable once they reached the front door – massive and reminiscent of the one the villagers ram down to attack the Beast – and Malfoy muttered in a hollow, haunting voice, "Welcome to Malfoy Manor…."
Malfoy led them to seats marked by their names embroidered upon the squarely folded black napkins. Someone on staff had worked extra fast to spell out Harry's name without a single flaw in shining emerald green thread. He ran his fingers over it, helpless but to be in awe. Next to him, Malfoy had already lowered himself into one of the high back chairs stained the richcolour of black cherries. Harry forced urgency into his limbs, settling down beside him and resisting the urge to trace the detailed etching of serpentine creatures on the crest rail.
"I had a meeting earlier outside of the Ministry; I saw him apparate in as I was headed out," Hermione said as soon as he was gone. She looked over her shoulder at him, brow raised. Like she was waiting for a ball to drop. "What did he want with you?"
The boy cleared his throat and very pointedly kept his gaze in the carton. "Staring at me…." The too-familiar slimy feeling crept into that pit in Teddy's belly. He knew it by heart now. He knew he
"Scorpius isn't here." Harry looked up at Astoria, gracefully sitting on the settee. How could someone appear so perfectly purposeful even when perfectly relaxed? But she wasn't relaxed...not fully. Her jaw was tensed. She was angry. Or was that, maybe, just her face? "So, if you're here
"Be gentle on her, Draco. She doesn't know any better," Harry said. He stated it loud and proud, his voice not the least bit shaky. Or…he was hoping it wasn't, because inside he was quaking. His hand was just as unsteady when he extended it to the woman, his other arm looping around her son's waist. Pulling him close and receiving a waft of his sweet cologne. A scent that could very easily be described as intoxicating, if the man behind it weren't so repugnant. Just for putting that contradiction into his head, Harry made sure to really sell his presence on this doorstep. "
After everything he'd gone through, all Harry wanted was to live a normal life. He didn't want there to be anything extraordinary about him, not one bit. He didn't want to make the papers anymore. He didn't want his name laced into anyone's rumours or gossip. All he wanted was to be at peace for once in his bloody miserable life.
Harry felt dirtier the longer he sat there. He felt like an unwelcome voyeur into the deepest parts of this man's soul. But he couldn't force himself to get up or look away. It was like watching someone enveloped in flames before his eyes; it was terrible and brought tears to his eyes but he was afraid to avert his gaze for fear of being haunted by the image left behind his eyelids.
"The Golden Sentinel, the American paper, did an article, too. You'll have a lot of murdering to do if that's the way you want to go," Draco whispered back, his face so damn close. His breath right in Harry's mouth. He could taste the pepperiness of his toothpaste.
Ron waved away Harry's concern, scanning the page where it lay between him and Hermione on the table. "Just rewrite it in your own handwriting; he'll never know the difference."
Astoria rolled her eyes and shoved at his shoulder. "Just yesterday you were walking around the flat in your pants while elbow deep in a pack of crisps."
Harry nodded, his heart seizing at what was to come. If Draco was pulling him away, this was bound to be a serious conversation. Was he going to profess his love now directly to Harry's face? His hands clenched into fists at the thought as he followed Draco across the hall. Draco resolutely closed the door behind them, but did indeed make for the storage cupboard with his wand held aloft.
Draco finished rearranging the tarts for the third time and stood up, moving to crouch in front of Harry's recliner. His hands were so gentle and so steady as he took Harry's own, momentarily easing the tremors. "She's already here," he pressed. "She's already aware of what type of organization this is. If you don't do the interview now…she'll use her assumptions to make things worse."
. And it was, coincidentally, then that one of the issues decided to solve itself. As he stood to try and stretch out even just a hint of the tension in his shoulders, the front door opened and Astoria came in literally stumbling.
Fast as a shifting gust of wind, Luna jumped to her feet. Harry startled, but laughed it off easily, the lightness of it feeling welcome upon the panicking pulse of his heartbeat. "I think I know what would help!" she exclaimed, doing a quick twirl before extending a hand down towards Harry.
Although he tried to pretend that his directionless life didn't faze him, Harry was actually starting to get a bit frustrated with himself. It was half of why he kept quitting jobs. Nothing felt…
Before he could process where he was going, Harry found himself crossing the threshold to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. It was close to the centre and the most comforting place in his subconscious. Once he saw Ron smiling warmly behind the checkout counter, he felt affirmed in his decision and shuffled over to him.
Harry frowned, that statement nestling itself into his mind like a sunken ship. Draco continued, reminding Harry of all the good things he'd done that he should be so proud of. Things that had nothing to do with a war he'd never had a choice in fighting. He spoke of Harry's selflessness and his ease at looking past the surface of a person, into their soul. He spoke of charity, but also of a true desire to actually help people. He didn't bring up Harry's brokenness nor his propensity for accidental violence. All he spoke of was love — all the beautiful things Draco could somehow see so clearly in Harry, even though Harry had a difficult time identifying them in himself.
"But it's still a great opportunity, Harry," Hermione whispered, like she was afraid of the words coming out of her mouth.
Harry's words came out harsher than he had intended. He could tell by the way Draco's breath hitched and his hand finally fell from Harry's back. But he didn't say a single word in reply until they had both apparated back to his backyard. And when he did…. "If your life and your marriage were so fucking secure,
But the part which had been difficult to handle was that Potter had seemingly been moving on. He had made himself perfectly at home in Longbottom's little cottage behind the shop, as evidenced by the scent of his cheap cologne lingering on its surfaces. Although he had denied that his current relationship was anything serious, Draco had heard enough about how sweet the couple were over the next few months to negate that statement. Especially after their supposedly romantic night out at the DMLE Holiday party a couple months back.
With a smile towards the doorway, Draco pushed a button on top of the train Harry had purchased for the boy. He'd seen it in a shop and didn't hesitate a second to buy it. Scorpius was obsessed with vehicles. This particular train, imbued with magic to bring it to life, sputtered and whistled before spewing a cloud of steam.
Scrambling up off the sofa, Hermione practically stomped over to the kitchen counter where Harry had left said note the night before. "'
"My thoughts exactly." Draco chuckled half-heartedly and threw down a handful of Muggle banknotes to cover his tab and then some. "Well, Potter," he began, using the excuse of buttoning up his coat to not meet the other's eyes, "it's been an interesting evening."
The man, an absolute fucking dream under his stoic composure, shook his head and made a few notes on his clipboard. "I have a latte out in the car, thanks. And call me Draco." He seemed confident. Harry had yet to determine if that was good or bad. "Everything does seem to be up to standard…."
And then Ron was gone, leaving Harry once again alone in a home filled with nothing but echoes of what had once been.
Harry scoffed and held Draco's imploring look. "Things are different now, Draco," he said softly. "As they should be. I can't continue to be the man I was before."
"Of course, in order to assuage my parents, I will need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement before any payment can be made. I feel they may be more comfortable if they knew anything you were to see during your stay was protected. Not that there will be anything
The relief he felt when he heard Potter's tentative footsteps back on the landing was incomparable. But he hid that wide grin and simply sat upright. Potter settled beside him, offering half a glass of scotch on the rocks. Theo accepted, eyeing the floating pieces of ice with caution. He was already feeling a bit drunk on just the feeling of what they were about to do. But it was only one drink…. And maybe if he drank it, the nervous knot at the back of his neck would be soothed.
On the subject of Christmas, it was quickly nearing on the six-month anniversary since that first, affirming kiss. Harry found himself resolute in remedying his inadequacy at least for one solitary and permanent moment. He was determined to give a grand gesture of a gift, even if he wasn't cut out for the creation of it.
Charlie's response was just as typical as it ever was. "Right now…I just want to lie here with you." A blatant try at steering them in the opposite direction.
"I know," Harry said softly, catching the boy before he was inevitably about to say the word 'rules' with that lispy 'r' sound he made. He needed to stay whole and vigilant; he couldn't afford for his heart to melt right there. "You've been told I'm not allowed inside. Your father, too, right?"
"Good." A flash of amusement crossed Draco's face. "Good. Because…if I ever shag you, Harry Potter…that's something I want to be able to remember."
He hadn't told Hermione yet. He simply stopped by the apartment for a brief moment to drop off every bit of his missed share of the rent from their time in London. She was at work all day and wouldn't see it until that night, which worked just fine. Harry wasn't looking forward to having to explain all of this mess to her. Especially when he still wasn't sure of the finer details himself.
sausage, instead?" He looked so damn proud of himself, brandishing that uncooked sausage with that pathetic wink. (Seriously, how had he ever grown to be an actual adult without learning to properly wink with only
At the behest of the bride and groom, most of the guests were soon on their feet, as well. Luna looked so perfectly at ease with her eyes closed and her long, blonde hair flowing behind her in a hapless curtain. She danced around the bonfire in a twirling circle like a witch of Muggle lore. Longbottom trailed behind her like a hapless puppy, grinning like a fool as he moved things out of her path with his wand. Draco had never seen a single person look so in love. His heart ached at the sight, stalling his own movement as he watched them pass by him.
Electing to stay here and play in this world had, with one simple sentence, become the dumbest mistake on his ever-long list.
Now, it wasn't as if Potter hadn't been dating at all since the end of the war. He had very openly been with the Weasley girl
Harry clenched his fists and resisted the urge to push up out of his own chair in barely bridled frustration. It was ridiculous that he was the only one who could have seen this. How was it that neither Draco nor Deacon could have come to this easy conclusion? "They're Muggleborns! The children who died…they're all Muggleborn wizards. How could you not see it?"
When Harry's hand fell heavy back to his side, the corner of Draco's lips pulled up into one of those barely-there smiles. Draco was fully aware that this particular smile drove him
"Oh." Nodding, Hermione sat up straighter and began to work her hair up into a ponytail. She looked deathly serious and Harry had never loved her more. "Well, let's start at the beginning, then, shall we?"
you will be relieved to hear we have resolved the issue with the staff!" Harry and Malfoy's feet had barely hit the bottom of the curved staircase before Narcissa sought them out. Harry nestled his fingers into the centre of the volute at the end of the banister, pushing his need to eyeroll out through his death grip on the solid wood. "No slaving away in the kitchen for you. Isn't that just a relief, my darling?"
Draco frowned and nodded. This had been his reason to come here. To lose himself. And…possibly even treat himself with some human contact for the night. But why should Harry Potter of all people need to do the same? "Come here often, then?" he asked, being nosy of course. This was a man who seemed to speak from experience. And the Prophet did run quite a few articles speculating on this Chosen One's long run of being single…. So he was curious. And had no inhibitions left.
As soon as he could manage it, Draco refocused his gaze, taking in the man's choice of date attire — a cardigan he might as well have stolen from his grandfather, a graphic t-shirt with a logo Draco didn't recognise, and cargo khakis, all paired with
Every single one of Harry's nerves were buzzing beneath his skin. His hands shook and his he couldn't straighten his head. "Can I…can I get you a drink, Mr. Malfoy?" he asked, a shake attached to his vocal chords.
"Whoa, Malfoy, look at you!" he heard someone — the Weasley girl, he was sure — exclaim. "Well done, mate."
for warmth. Gorging ourselves on food before it went bad. Arguing over a small flashlight once the sun went down. Telling secrets in the silence of the night. Just you and me…in our own little bubble away from the rest of the world. Away from the expectations the rest of the world has for us. It was just me and you…and after those two days I knew I loved you.
Even he knew this wasn't a likely outcome. Harry had been absent from the world for over two weeks and that wasn't bound to go unnoticed. If Draco had finally come to check on him, others would, too. But why did they have to start caring right
then disappearing…somehow they travelled? I'm sorry I don't know how to explain it better and I didn't honestly believe her until last week. All I knew was that I wasn't plagued by dreams of you any longer."
"Well…some people care…." Potter scuffed the toe of his trainer against the ground. "Not that I'd rather they didn't care, but there are people who do. I still get fan mail, you know."
"Oh, fuck off, Lipinski. The hardest you've worked in the last year was when you chased after that witness to get her name. I wouldn't call that amazing, in any respect."
Cheryl nodded slowly, her gaze trained on her paper as her quill worked furiously to capture the heavy weight of Draco's confession. "So…," she processed. Her eyes flicked quickly up to the clock on the wall above her client's head before settling back upon her quick scrawl. Draco's knee bounced even more vigorously as the seconds passed in that expectant silence. "Done, sorry," Cheryl said with that same, soft smile she always wore as she finally set down her notepad. "
. And he found he had no words in response to them. Nor did he have his next move ready and waiting.
Draco nodded, swallowing his retort as well as a heartbreaking goodbye. He'd learned long ago that soft kisses and whispered 'next time's only served to leave them in pieces.
"Just saw you checkin' out a bloke's ass last week," Ron agreed. "To be fair, he was well fit, even if he wasn't really type."
When Draco tried to pull away, it dawned on Harry that he was frozen in shock and made a pathetic keening noise while kicking into action. His hands formed fists around Draco's lapels, tugging him closer. He parted Draco's lips with his own, feeling goddamn euphoric at the sweet taste of him. This moment, this rush of his hips careening forward and his whole body flushing with intense passion, was nothing like Harry had imagined. It was rushed and frantic, biting and scratching and pulling and demanding. He couldn't fucking breathe but he didn't fucking
"Sometimes us great and honorable folk like to be pampered bottoms, too," Potter laughed, leaning in for another breath-stealing kiss. "I take it since that's what you were expecting, though, you're on board?"
rough) draft of Harry's soul-bearing letter. She scanned it over, her eyebrows rising higher into her fringe with every line. As she finished, she slowly passed the scrap of paper over to Luna and breathed a long sigh. "Harry." He winced at her earnest tone. "Malfoy's going to break up with you if you give him that."
Theo hadn't gone to Draco's apartment with bad intentions. But he sure as hell left with the foundations for some.
For a moment, Harry waited and thought. He didn't know much...and what he did know was vague. It was starting to appear like he didn't really know anything at all. "It was an arranged marriage and the two of you grew apart. Or never clicked in the first place? Scorpius was only a few months old when you filed for divorce."
"I think we're forgetting," Hermione cut in, her voice dripping in rationality, "that Malfoy is more likely to hex Harry than to allow himself to be completely ambushed with a non-consensual kiss."
Despite wanting to hold onto that feeling for as long as he could, he nodded and hitched his ankles up where his fingers were a moment previous. Arching up for a better angle. Knowing if he couldn't remain filled, at least he could let Potter try to hit him deeper.
Honestly, Draco would do anything for Harry. If he would go to prison for a friend, he would literally lie down and
His eyes scouring their surroundings with something like embarrassment, Draco rushed to shush him. "
"Er," Harry faltered and gestured towards the stairs at the end of the hall. "Yeah, it's just down there, but—"
"Oh, don't guffaw at me like that, Potter. You're the least subtle thing on the planet," Daphne continued, pulling her hair down from its messy bun before raking it back up again. "For the record, I am totally on board with the whole thing. Boy needs a proper snog, if you ask me. And the two of you really do have that tragic enemies-to-lovers thing going on that's so hot."
Harry had known Tonks (she preferred her maiden name over the one given to her and wasn't shy about expressing so) since he was a teenager. She was one of his favourite people with her wild magenta hair and brazen sense of humour. And she made his "uncle" Remus happier than he could ever recall, even if they did appear to be an oddly mismatched couple. Knowing her, even in the barest he did as the wife of his dad's best friend, Harry was flummoxed as to how she could be considered an "inappropriate" topic. Then again, Malfoy had stated Tonks' mother wasn't often discussed within the family.
With mild confidence and a bitten back smirk, Draco pulled in the familiar stench of Canadian whisky. "As are you…." With just the inkling of an upturned lip, Draco chanced a glance upward. Harry wasn't smiling and a second later neither was he. "Why'd you come back?"
As I've stated in my other works, this last year has been CRAZY and shitty.... So, I'm sorry for this late update to this work, but I definitely haven't forgotten about it. Please enjoy the new chapter and let me know what you're thinking!
Before he could stop himself, Draco lashed out, "What are you even doing here?" the implication of an accusation hidden behind his tone.
"Please feel free to tell me no — y'know, if you're not comfortable with it or something," Harry said, finishing off his proposal to Hermione and Luna who both sat before him wearing untelling pinched expression. "I just can't seem to manage more than 'Draco, you're pale like a ghost and I'm into it', and somehow that doesn't sound romantic."
didn't even seem like an option. The man was severely set in his quest to wear a path into the floor with his incessant pacing. Harry felt like he was watching a tennis match, his gaze ping-ponging back and forth across the room.
"Yeah…." DeWitt gave Harry a pointed look, well aware that the meaning behind his line of questioning was clear. Harry sighed and threw his hands up in the air. "I
Like he was sure that was going to be the answer, Malfoy flipped open the folder. "There's really no good place to start...," he mused as he dragged a fingertip down a detailed checklist. "Middle name?"
"How good is your memory?" Malfoy asked as he settled into the chair cater-cornered from Harry. Their knees brushed under the table, but he quickly readjusted to give them less intimacy.
"Oh, you brought them flowers." Draco felt his heart skip a beat— "That's really thoughtful of you. Neville will love them." —and then stop. Harry turned away from him and beckoned, walking down the hallway just as Draco opened his mouth to protest, deflating his confidence further with every step. "Thanks, by the way, for agreeing to be my 'date'—" he actually, physically used air quotes "—to their wedding. I had every intention of going out there to find someone to bring, but by the time I remembered…. Well, it was too late. I didn't want to just take anyone. And Luna would never let me live it down if I showed up alone. She's convinced I don't spend enough time these days with 'other adults'. And, well, Teddy was excited by the idea of you coming with us."
Perhaps that was why Harry loved him. He didn't have the luxury himself of even attempting anonymity. And Draco was always voluntarily right there with him.
Harry's strangled ostracization from all conversation continued through to the beginning of the main course — roasted pheasant and potatoes slathered in an onion gravy. Breaking the droning clink of silverware on fine china, Malfoy cleared his throat. Harry carefully watched him sidelong, gratefully shovelling in food while it tasted familiar.
In the most devious of self-sabotages, Draco fell asleep under Potter's soothing ministrations. His borrowed body eventually melted away, leaving him dangerously recognisable in pale skin illuminated by moonlight.
This man sat right before Harry had a complex of some kind. He was sure of it. Narrowing his eyes, he just barely uttered, "Also currently unemployed…."
Draco had never been a troubling thing to Teddy. He loved the man like a father. Of which he had far too many, already. But Draco was there before most of those others really made any sense to him. He was there when Teddy was a child, shaping who he grew to be. Those three years were deeply ingrained into his being. They weren't something he could just forget. They were a part of him. And that was comforting.
"Sit," was the first word this man – Draco – spoke to him in person. Like he was a dog. The voice definitely matched and so did the bossy tone. The overall appearance of him matched, as well. He looked like a right pompous git. His white-blond hair was slicked back into a low, fairly short ponytail. Not a single strand was out of place. He wore what seemed like an expensive suit, definitely tailored and probably handmade just for him. There were little silver pinstripes stitched into its black material that played nicely with his steel gray eyes. He was thin and sharp; his cheekbones looked as if they could cut a diamond. Every single bit of his looked poised and well-bred. Even though this café was decent and clean, he still looked massively out of place.
"Did something happen since we met last week?" Cheryl asked gently, seemingly taking literal notes of how he jiggled his leg to keep awake.
He swallowed, his throat thick with fear even despite his relaxed inhibitions. He could have easily answered with just one word. And, according to Luna, all it would have taken for Harry to understand were real, tangible words. If he could manage the conviction, his feelings would finally be obvious enough for Harry to either embrace or reject. It was so simple. It was so easy.
"If you sit down…I'll explain it all," Harry said gently, patting the stretch of mattress in front of him.
With a dramatic sigh, Scorpius leaned backwards into the house while holding firm to the door handle. "Mummy!" he shouted. When he didn't get the urgent response he was hoping for, he pronounced the word again, louder and more severe.
"Yeah, let's hear it," Ron added. His tone betrayed his desperation for a change of subject. Harry was willing to bet he had been losing whatever fight they were having.
Sorry in advance... But I've softened the thing I'm apologizing for with some smut! Would love to hear some reviews on this chapter - please don't be afraid to say whatever you're thinking!
Sure enough, the louder Harry's heart beat in his ears, the closer the green haze inched towards yellow. Once it reached a disconcerting shade of burnt orange, a concerned-looking woman was at Harry's other side. "Mr. Potter, I need you to calm down. Can you take deep breaths for me? Do you know where you are?"
"He means we're roasting our own dinner," Harry clarified in between muttering a retardant charm over Teddy's clothing. It was such a simple gesture, but one which made Draco's throat feel tight with emotion nonetheless.
Scrubbing a hand over his face, Draco pulled the photographs back. He was so grateful they weren't enchanted – they were lifelike enough and just touching them made him uneasy. "I learnt long enough ago, Mr. McClain, what exactly the right side of history is. Someone like you most certainly is not on that side." He shoved everything back into the file, tucking it under his arm. Hoping he never had to look through it again. "This is goodbye, Mr. McClain. I've no clue where you're to end up…but my hope is Azkaban. I've never known anyone to be more deserving of the Dementor's Kiss than you."
Even in isolation, left with nothing but his own thoughts, Harry didn't think of anything but Draco Malfoy. At least, not when he wasn't an anxious mess over what might be happening outside of those four walls. But most of the time he was able to calm himself down from that ledge by closing his eyes and remembering that moment between them on the day of the interview. Draco's feather-soft hair tickling his lips. The overwhelming scent of sandalwood and bergamot. His body filled with so much heat he thought he might burst. He could build a lifetime of fantasies out of those three seconds alone.
Today was no different. Harry walked in with a bag of pastries and introduced himself to their new assistant – Lexi – like he was damn pleased to meet her. Like he was trying to prove something. He did think his job was still in jeopardy, after all. His temporary one here, at least.
Settling into a bar stool at the counter, Teddy chirped a soft laugh. Apprehension still hung in every one of his limbs. "Dad likes ice cream, too. We should go get him." With how
"But I don't know the end? The end is the answer, but all I have are the questions. If I had the answer, I wouldn't be here murdering your poor flowers while I thought myself into circles."
It turned out the cook had quit. And it also turned out that, though Narcissa was aware of this, she didn't connect it to the absence of someone there to prepare their lunch. She didn't realize this until they'd been sitting there for over an hour. Harry couldn't help but to feel like this was the perfect example of rich privilege.
Slamming his hands hard upon the desk, Draco pushed into a standing position. He'd made up his mind. Or the ghost of Harry's strong will did it for him. Either way, it was high time he stopped pushing this off. It was high time he grew a pair and at least pretended to be the hero Harry Potter wanted him to be.
"Funny," Harry sighed, tugging at his beard to test the length. It had never been so long. He probably looked like a madman…. "How do you know where I live?"
But beyond all that, his friend spoke of a real and physical place for support. His heavy heart and muddled mind responded to the knowledge of this with relief. He felt lighter at the mere thought, making up his mind before he'd even had a proper think on it. "Sounds wonderful, Luna," he admitted on a sigh. He pulled her closer into his arms, going for a gentle embrace.
"And that's why you have the bell. Your body needs you to keep resting." Harry was prattling on like an overcautious mother. He felt it both in the look Draco had leveled at the back of his head and in the heavy sigh Teddy threw his way as he settled him back under the sheets. But he couldn't help it. "You still need more time," Harry whispered against the sweat-soaked hair at Teddy's temple. The color had slowly fallen back to his natural turquoise over the last few days of his recovery. The sight would have been comforting if it wasn't accompanied by persistent vomiting and terrible shakes. It seemed like they might finally be on the back end of this thing, however. The boy's fever had dropped a few days previous and the hospital finally felt confident enough to allow release. The chills seemed to be all he had left, alongside a still weak stomach, of course.
"Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there!" he shouted and flung his feet back to the floor. "Keep your pants on," he muttered while pulling his own back up and donning the shorts. He'd just torn open his bedroom door and made it three steps towards the entrance to his flat when whoever it was knocked a third time, rapidly and in loud succession like they were trying to bust it down. "I'm literally right here! Godric's sake, calm the fuck down!" Thrown by his own frustration, he neglected to look through the peephole and literally squealed when he finally pulled the door open.
Potter's lips worked up Theo's jawline in agonizingly slow motion. The scratch of his beard was just as intoxicating as Theo had imagined it. More, even.
"No." Draco kills the engine, yanks the keycard from his pocket and tosses it at Harry. It takes Harry a moment to register what's happening as Draco opens the door, steps out, and slams it shut.
“Roses,” he said, and Harry had nodded tiredly. Draco often mentioned roses. He never bothered to elaborate though, never explained.
Harry says his name, just once, and it's a light question that hangs in the air like a snow cloud. For a moment, Harry's standing on the Cornish coast again, calling out into the storm-tossed sea, listening to his voice echo across the cliffs.
“Oh, that’s a nice way to greet your oldest friend, isn’t it?” Ron drops into the chair opposite Harry’s desk.
“I’ve got another job at three, Butterworth,” she says. The man — Butterworth — gives her an irritated look.
"What petition?" Harry asks, confused, and Astoria looks at him as if he's just asked which direction the sun comes up.
Hermione bites her lip. "Remember when you told me about your dreams, a while ago? And it reminded me of those dreams you used to have — the ones that weren't really dreams, they were Legilimency — "
This is important, somehow. Like a fading voice, like a closing door, like the lights of a train fading into the distance.
"You said you found him?" she says breathlessly. Harry nods. He'd been deliberately vague in the letter, saying Draco had been found but was seriously ill and currently at St Mungo's.
Malfoy had an eagle owl during Hogwarts, Harry recalls. Strange for him to say he’s not fond of them.
He knows that feeling well. The empathy runs through his veins, threading its way beneath his skin. People wanting something, everything. Throughout the war, that feeling followed him like a distant Dementor, hovering over his thoughts and clouding his days with self-doubt and misery. The worst part was knowing they didn't want the real Harry. They wanted a charade, a false and brittle brightness. A normal person, a confident person who knew exactly what to do.
He sets off into the gardens, following a path that cuts directly across manicured lawns and past a weeping willow with a stone bench beneath it. He can see the stables, flanked by well-tended flowerbeds, and as he unlocks the bolted door and steps inside, he can still smell the rich aroma of riding leather. The hooks on the wall — no doubt once used to hold tack — now hold secateurs, hedge trimmers, trowels and grafters. Harry manages to squeeze past the bags of potting mix and fertilisers, making his way through a narrow doorway and into the main stables.
Harry reaches out, and for a moment he can almost feel the canola flowers feathering his fingers, the stars on his skin, a hand slipping through his.
Their reactions tell him everything he needs to know. Astoria blinks, looking completely bewildered. Narcissa begins to shake her head, and then a flash of realisation and then fear crosses her face.
He waited urgently on their doorstep, the rain lashing at his hastily flung-on coat, his hair uncombed and toes curling in damp shoes, socks forgotten in his haste. His fingers tapped along the timber frame in an odd, sporadic manner, as though he was playing an invisible piano.
So Harry does his best to enjoy the day and, in the evening, he Floos to the apartment. Ginny, left behind due to an apparently very absorbing conversation with Fleur, will no doubt return soon as well. For now, the apartment is completely dark save for the small Christmas tree. It's still sitting on the end of the counter, dusted in tiny lights.
He told the Healers. He wondered if anyone would conjure white and lovely stars to keep Draco's darkness at bay. And when he received the owl one week later, he knew immediately what it was. Draco's death notice was sealed with black wax.
“Look at them! So disapproving. Identical expressions,” Matthew says. “Like two angry peas in a pod.”
“It's just another silly argument,” Hermione said, a little unkindly. “Have a Calming Drought, go to bed. He'll be back tomorrow morning. He always is.”
At any moment, he thinks, Draco will notice him. But Draco's attention seems elsewhere, and Harry stands in the hallway for a long moment, watching Draco hunt through the mirror cabinet for floss. It's strange to watch him so unguarded. Many people, Harry has learned, have little tells and habits that give away their emotions or thoughts. Ron's ears reddening, for example, or Hermione chewing her lip. Narcissa playing with her jewellery, or Astoria tucking her hair behind her ears.
"Of course. That's what people do, isn't it? They judge. My parents adored Draco. If it were up to my mother, I'd be a widow forever, trailing about the place dressed in mournful black. She thought it was awful of me to remarry." She taps a fingernail against the rim of the mug. "I was very close to Draco, of course, and when he first went missing I was a mess." That matches the case officer's description of his interview with her, Harry thinks. "But we learn to pick up the pieces and move on, don't we?"
"I never said 'what's the point, sitting in a box' to you. I said it to Astoria. You just saw it in a memory."
Harry, long ago forgetting the purpose of the task and becoming absorbed in tiny details, finds himself poring over the Hogwarts textbooks.
The waitress arrives with the spiced mead and a cocktail the colour of a candy-cane. Harry sips at the mead if only to have something to do.
And, on the second of May — the eighth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts — Harry finds the time-turner.
Draco had a very limited range of possessions, Harry thinks an hour later. It's surprising; he assumed Draco would amass a number of expensive but useless things.
the blame. He sits in the driver's seat and places his hands on the wheel; he stares unseeingly at the road atlas; he leaves the car and paces restlessly around it.
Draco looked at her in disbelief. Very few times had he called on Ron and Hermione, distraught after an argument with Harry. Was there still a shade of school-day dislike in those cool brown eyes, in the impatient hand drumming on the doorframe? Her hand still rested on the doorknob, a determined resistance to any welcome.
Harry reaches out to take the keycard but before he realises what's happening, Draco's seized his hand and isn't letting go.
It was dark still and nobody was around. He wanted to sit there to see what it was like to be a Ravenclaw. The table felt different and he was right next to the staff tables now, close enough to see the engravings on the seats, the woodgrain in the table. If he glanced out the window he could see the lake stretching away. He was not used to windows. He settled down and had a piece of toast. Ravenclaws would eat toast.
He turns and nearly jumps. Astoria stands just behind him, her face pale. Her robes — black and plain — billow and snap in the wind like the sails of a storm-tossed boat.
Butterworth frowns. "I'll need to access the remains." He pauses. "Cremated or buried by now, most likely. We'll have to do it the Muggle way. Go and arrange the Muggle Liaison office to fetch the DNA sample." He waves a hand irritably. "Contact me when you have it."
He Disapparates to the apartment, appearing in the foyer, and takes the stairs rather than the elevator. Level one, level two, level three, level four...
Like the old Draco Malfoy. He's wearing well-tailored clothes and a set of neat black robes. His hair is neatly combed, his cloak pinned with a small gold owl. All that's missing is the air of faint contempt.
“I’m finished,” he said, and he was. No rough edges now, nothing left wanting. Perhaps some hairline cracks, some shards that had somehow gone astray. But for the most part, he felt everything again. Yes, he could feel now. He could feel every muscle working beneath his skin, the sinew and bone shifting with each other. He could feel his hands, hold them still. He could hold his wand straight. He could pour ingredients — carefully, tensely — but he could.
"This is amazing," Ginny says. "I'm on the reserves, of course, but it's generally a stepping stone to a full-time position. I know one of their Chasers is heading into early retirement from a bad back injury, and I've been told that if I prove myself in practice, I have a legitimate chance at filling the position."
It's like the first journey, or the last one, or every one. All the little familiarities, stepping into his heart like old friends. City lights, going past each side of him, a blur, a long stream of everlasting brightness. But he doesn't need the lights. He doesn't need to see. He knows the way, he'll always know the way home.
Malfoy left Eeylops, the original detective noted. No other witnesses. There's an interview with Malfoy's wife, Astoria Greengrass, who reported Malfoy missing after he didn't return home for the night. Typical interview, Harry thinks, reading the transcript. Astoria appeared 'in a state of distress' and proved to be of little use. Nevertheless, he reads it again and again. Visits the pensieve again and again until he has it memorised, until he knows the script by heart.
The song was on his lips at last. He knew it! He knew it now. Slow and perfect like a blooming rose. He could make a sound now. He could break this silence.
"An ivory merchant goes to Africa for a lovely little holiday," Draco says lightly. Harry gives him a look.
. Harry wonders if that's an invitation to speak about the last three years, about Draco being trapped in the past, about everything that happened.
“His hands shake all the time,” Harry said quietly. “When I go down there alone, it’s all I hear in that empty silence. Just a spoon, clinking on a bowl.”
"Scared the living daylights out of me! I taught you to drive — why d'you have to pop out of fireplaces, for heaven's sake?"
Harry waits. The wind nips at his face, a salt-tinted bite from the freezing Celtic Sea. He shivers and draws his cloak closer, fighting with the material as it slips from his numb hands.
to exist, stating that those who knew the whereabouts of felons — but didn't report them straight away — could be arrested for hindering prosecution. But the law has long since been abolished."
It has been a long time since Harry last cast that spell and he winces as soon as he says the word, waiting for the chaotic memories to smash into his mind, waiting to be caught helplessly in the riptide of someone else’s consciousness.
They've done this a thousand times before, but this time...Harry can't think of what to say for a long moment. He retrieves Draco's file and opens it, fumbling with the pages. "Male, aged twenty-three at time of disappearance. Went missing September 2003." After a long moment, he adds quietly, "Known to frequent the Cornish coast."
Ron looks abashed. “Sorry, mate. But this case...you’ve been a bit obsessed with it. I dunno, it can play tricks with your mind sometimes.”
Harry walks towards it. As he walks closer, he can see the faint outline of someone sitting in the driver's seat. He puts a hand on the passenger-side handle and opens the door, pausing a moment before getting in and shutting the door again.
But Draco sits on the passenger's side and opens the atlas, and so Harry takes his cue and sits in the driver's seat. He readjusts the mirrors slightly and reverses out, half-expecting Draco to say something about his inadequate driving skills. Harry's realised, over the course of their journey, that Draco is indeed a very skilled driver.
Then again, it seems everything reminds him of Draco these days. The nights remind him of the sea of stars in Snowdonia, and the lonely autumn winds remind him of the wave-lashed Cornish coast. The fair weather conjures the feel of butter-yellow canola flowers and pale blue skies, and the rain makes him think of falling asleep in the Renault, listening to the faint swish of the window wipers, seeing the water droplets stream across the windscreen. Watching Draco's wrists flex as he steered around the corners.
There's a lull in silence and Harry realises Astoria has fallen asleep. The memory should have ended. He glances away from her, then looks up and freezes. Draco's eyes, reflected in the rear-vision mirror, are locked on his.
Six years ago, he stood here and found a silver snitch clasp. Now, he finds the same clasp – but it’s been amended. Now, the silver snitch is set into a simple ring.
The trees bend their boughs all at once, bringing a great rush of water down upon them. After a moment, Hermione blinks at Harry through her mop of drenched hair. Then —
"That's brilliant news, Ginny," Harry says warmly. It's long been a dream of hers to gain a place on the English National Team.
The realisation dawns the day before, on the first day of the month. It's a mild spring day. Summer is beginning to approach the land again; he can feel it like the distant glow of a fire. There's warmth in the breeze that stirs the leaves of the trees, and he thinks a drive to Cornwall sounds nice. In the soft glow of a warm spring day, Helston looks far more friendly and cheerful, and the coastline itself seems gentler. The waves seem less furious and more playful as they roil and roll around the base of the cliffs. There's a young family taking photographs of the lighthouse, the children giggling and chasing each other around in circles.
Ginny looks away. "I thought we could," she says, "until the morning after, when I left for Quidditch practice. We'd just broken up, and I still got up and went to practice. And I realised that it's because to me, practice is more important than trying to fix this. My career is my first priority." She looks up at him, and it feels like they're being honest with each other for the first time in ages, and Harry's suddenly so sick of wearing masks and reciting from scripts someone else wrote, and so he speaks the truth, the thought that he's kept hidden for so long during the last year of their relationship.
Draco is standing beside it, the faint glow of the light dancing over his face like clouds drifting across the sky. Behind him, through the windows, Harry can see the London night illuminated. There's the lines of trains, moving slowly from station to station. High above, the crescent moon is struggling through the misty winter night.
And the rest is lost in a strangled cry before he vanishes with another sound like glass shattering.
"Said it was in the dresser," Hermione says conversationally, and Harry quickens his pace until he's standing in the room.
She seems casual. Never consciously aware of her movements, whether it's tucking her bare feet under the chair or tracing patterns on the mug. Quick to smile, Harry thinks, seeing the beginning of fine laugh lines around her eyes. Her light tan and sun-tinted hair suggest someone who enjoys being outdoors; a stack of books on the corner of the table with titles like
There was a click. His fingers paused in their noiseless tune. The light spilled out into the darkness, lighting him up, outlining his rough hair, illuminating his wild eyes.
Ginny leans over and pats Harry’s hand. “Sometimes,” she says fondly, “you have terrible taste. Just
But on and on they go. Fields and trees flash past, stars reflected in rivers, and every now and again they pass through a small village, a little collection of lights. They're in the heart of nowhere, Harry thinks, leaning his forehead against the cool glass of the window. They pass through another village and Harry sees a playground for a fleeting moment. Swings swaying slightly in the warm summer night, the chains creaking, and he wonders if this is the same place he parked the Renault so many months ago when Draco gave him memories. Harry smiles, thinking that Draco gave him more memories tonight. There was no Legilimens spell, no pensieve, but Draco gave him memories regardless.
Harry tries to say something casual, something nonchalant, but his mouth dries up and all he can do is nod once at Draco as he fetches the keys from his pocket and unlocks the door.
"Look...in a few seconds, he'll glance at his hand...I can't believe I didn't notice it earlier! Any moment..."
When Draco reached his common room he waited for his hands to stop trembling, then tried to take out some homework.
Because sometimes, that feels like his intentions. He wanted to hide Draco, just have a moment — maybe a bit longer. Just him and Draco. Driving and speaking about nothing important and falling asleep in the English midlands. Stars and rivers and fields, and if he closes his eyes he can remember the sun-warmed stone of the sea defence wall, solid and real beneath his skin. The breakers rolling in, quiet and constant. The dunes of the beach subsiding into long, smooth plains.
"I can't hear you," he says quietly, and Draco stops speaking. His shoulders slump slightly. He walks towards Harry, and the moonlight filters through him like he's no more substantial than water, and Harry realises that Draco is struggling just to exist here. Whatever is left of his strength is not enough to speak, not enough to appear solid. He's like a ghost. When he's just a few steps away from Harry he reaches out, and Harry responds without thinking, outstretching his own hand.
The last light always fades too soon. The dancing slows down into standing and swaying, and Sophie is sent to bed despite her half-hearted protests. The house settles into the night, comfortable and quiet, until even the warbled lyrics of ‘You’re My Cheering Charm’ seem sentimental rather than saccharine. Draco acquiesces at last for a dance with Harry, when the room is dark and lit only by dusk and a little lamp, and they hardly move anyway, just hold each other and stand in the middle of the room. Harry can hear the distant noises of others drifting through the home. Hermione and Ginny are in the sitting room, by the warm fire, reminiscing about old times, their voices rising and falling. Ron and Matthew are washing the dishes in the kitchen; Matthew is sagely passing along parenting advice to a mildly nervous Ron. Harry can hear the clink of dishes and the murmur of their voices. Astoria is coming down the hallway, humming to the music, having just finished Sophie’s bedtime stories.
“How do you expect to pass if you don’t even attend the classes?” he asked, frowning and looking at him expectantly.
Later that evening, they drive on to Southampton. It's a two-hour drive; Harry, who is the navigator for the journey, takes the direct route. He wonders if Draco would prefer the scenic and meandering side-roads, as he usually does, but Draco doesn't say anything about Harry's choice of road. They speed along the M27, Draco as confident as ever. In the hazy light of the summer dusk, a fox darts across the road and Draco swerves neatly around it.
“Yeah, well, I don’t like large groups of people skulking around and hissing like that,” Harry said.
“My life,” Harry said, “was always in a state of war.” He paused, pushing his plate away. “I can’t imagine a Before, and an After was something that happened to other people.”
She laughs. "Well, I can't do Saturday, we're attending a Holyhead match to take notes, so I'll be gone Friday night too. Sunday I've got debriefings."
Harry drives back Astoria and Matthew's home for the usual routine — a butterbeer or two in front of the roaring fire while Harry regales Matthew with stories of the wizarding world. Matthew seems to be quite fascinated with dragons.
“Lucius spent nearly all the family fortune acquiring it,” Narcissa continues. “It was madness, but he could not be dissuaded. He had already fled to Crete by then, but he frequently visited us to speak of his future plans.”
“I can’t sleep,” Draco said truthfully. “The Shadow follows me.” The only word he could think of for it.
Owls hoot softly; there's the smell of living creatures in the air. The rustle of feathers, the creak of sun-warmed wood. The smell of sawdust as the field mice nest in their cages. The shop is dark and enclosed, with overhead roosts dotted with owls and the walls lined with teetering boxes of pet supplies.
Draco watched them again at five o’clock in the morning, circling the lake. Not talking. No need to talk. Harry skimmed rocks. Hermione drew patterns in the snow with her wand. Ron methodically melted the leaves, one by one, from a tall tree that had not managed to shed its leaves in time for winter. The icicles melted away to reveal the rich gold beneath.
Harry pauses to study him. "You don't, you know. Quite surprising, really, but you don't." It's true, he thinks. Strange...in school, Draco always gave off that cold air. But now...sometimes he seems distant, but in a different way. Whether he's gazing silently at lighthouse diagrams or standing patiently in an inn's reception, he seems the sort of person who might not be a good conversationist, but certainly a good listener.
No. The sunlight, he thinks. It's fiercer, as if it's the light of a summer day. And the shopkeeper...his face seems different somehow, as if slightly more lined. His robes, too, seem somehow more worn, more creased.
"You'll have a good year," she said. "I know it. All your friends, darling, and all your classes..."
“You’re being very judgmental. You know, Birmingham has its charms. For example, Moseley Bog is quite nice this time of — ”
She had sold their manor. Too many memories, she said. Draco understood. He couldn’t enter the drawing room without gagging.
"I never thought about it like that," he says. "I never thought..." He glances at Narcissa. "Why are you telling me this?"
That night, however, after he's returned to the apartment and kissed Ginny goodnight, he sits at the kitchen counter and unpacks Draco's life again.
The stalls have been removed, but the sweet scent of hay still lingers. There's some gardening items in here too — rakes and brooms leaning against the wall — but most of the room is taken up by the car, hidden beneath a large swathe of canvas. Harry drags the canvas away, causing clouds of dust and dirt to drift into the air, and detects deterrence spells woven into the material. Most likely to stop rats and other vermin from getting near the car and chewing wiring, Harry thinks.
. The driver's licence will be a wonderful surprise — he can only imagine Ginny's expression — and there's so much more he wants to say. All the things they somehow never find the time to tell each other.
Harry wasn't away for long, but for some reason he has trouble remembering where everything is. Was the sugar kept on the second or third shelf? He opens a cupboard to fetch mugs, but it turns out to be full of glasses. He may as well be in the house of a stranger. While they're waiting for the kettle to boil, Draco takes a seat at the island counter and trails a hand along the edge of it.
Harry doesn't even think about Draco going to the papers. Draco wouldn't do that. He doesn't know why, but he just knows Draco wouldn't do it. When they go back...
"What were you thinking?" Ron adds. "Mum's going to completely lose it! She's already knitted matching Christmas jumpers!"
The faint pop of someone Apparating. Matthew — calm and steady, standing by the warm fireplace like an immoveable rock — speaks just as Astoria begins to rush away.
Harry looks up again. “I like to imagine the memories are all here. If you look hard enough. All the ghosts.”
He turns onto the road and accelerates until the scenery is flying past, until the dark fields wash away like tides, until it feels like he's driving through the night sky itself, and a thousand moments seem to come together in one rush of exhilaration: Draco and Astoria driving by the river, Harry standing in his apartment and watching the train lights disappear into darkness, and for a moment he sees everything perfectly.
He studies Draco's face. Whatever potions they've given him have transformed him into a blank canvas. In his sleep, Draco always looked faintly unhappy, as if he slept with purposeful focus, with deep concentration. But the potions have washed all of that away.
